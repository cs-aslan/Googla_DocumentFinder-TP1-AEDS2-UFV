I was forgotten  
Until you called my name  
Lost in the shadows  
Until you shined your light my way  
Now I believe again  
In all my dreams again  
Im wide eyed and innocent  
Those doubting days  
Are so far away and oh  
  
I will fall  
And you will catch me always  
Time has taught me this  
I will fly  
And youll be there to guide me  
Straight up to my hearts highest wish  
I feel you close to me  
And I know what love is  
  
Now theres no mountain  
Too high for me to climb  
No ocean so wide  
That I could not reach the other side  
Now I believe in me  
Cause you live and breather in me  
And nothing can come between  
We are one star  
No nigh can darken Oh  
  
I will fall  
And you will catch me always  
Time has taught me this  
I will fly  
And youll be there to guide me  
Straight up to my hearts highest wish  
I feel you close to me  
And I know what love is  
  
Its an unspoken thing  
A quiet opening  
There are no words that can go that deep  
But I know  
I know  
  
I will fall  
And you will catch me always  
Time has taught me this  
I will fly  
And youll be there to guide me  
Straight up to my hearts highest wish  
I feel you close to me  
And I know what love is
