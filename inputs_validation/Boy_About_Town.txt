See me walking around Im the boy about town that you heard of  
See me walking the streets Im on top of the world that you heard of  
Oh like paper caught in wind  
I glide upstreet I glide downstreet  
  
Oh and it wont let you go  
Till you finally come to rest or someone picks you up  
Upstreet downstreet and puts you in the bin  
See me walking around Im the boy about town that you heard of  
  
See me walking the streets Im on top of the world that you heard  
Oh Im sitting watching rainbows  
And watching the people go crazy  
Oh please leave me aside  
  
I want to be a I want to be  
I want to live in  
Upstreet downstreet like paper caught in wind  
Upstreet downstreet it wont let you go  
  
Na na na nah na na na nah  
Na na na na na na nah  
Na na na nah na na na nah  
Theres more than you can hope for in this world
