I will move my little self on  
It wont be very much longer  
One day soon he will find me  
I know this because I believe  
  
If I get to know myself better  
I will be a little bit stronger  
I wont forget everything you told me  
Yeah I miss the way youd hold me  
The words you told me  
  
Chorus  
Things happen for a reason youll become a stronger person  
When life tears you up then youll understand  
Its never easy but youll know when you get there  
As it tears you down it builds you up  
Well it built you up  
  
Some girls fall just like I did  
They break our hearts I shouldve broke his  
Get yourself up strut along further  
My advice you can do better  
Just say whatever  
  
Chorus  
  
Well you said you would love me forever  
Well blablablablablablabla  
You should maybe watch what youre saying  
Why why why  
  
Chorus 2x
