Little Suzie Greenberg with her head caved in  
Soon will let me drown beneath the undertow  
You better put that woman in a loony bin  
Cause you know Id really like to be a part of her show  
  
Suzie is an artist she paints quite a lot  
An artist she may be but a genius she is not  
She says she wants to be a sociologist  
But she better first get checked by a neurologist  
  
Suzie Suzie Suzie Suzie  
Suzie Suzie Greenberg  
  
Suzies bout as faithful as a slot machine  
Pays off once in a while but then shell rob you clean  
Shes always afraid that shes not sure what shes worth  
Shes out of her mind and shes not of this earth  
  
The woman walks the streets like shes the queen of the town  
Doesnt talk very much shes very profound  
Little Suzie Greenberg always playing the game  
But today Ill bet shes probably forgotten my name
