Oh you can be what you wanna be  
See what you wanna see  
Believe in yourself just believe in yourself  
You can go where you wanna go  
Do what you wanna do  
Believe in yourself just believe in yourself  
  
Some folks try to tell you there are things you shouldnt do  
But youre not strong enough or smart enough at all  
But what seems right to them quite often might be wrong for you  
So be sure you try to climb before you get to scare youll fall  
  
You can be what you wanna be  
Learn what you wanna learn  
Believe in yourself just believe in yourself  
You can try what you need to try  
No one should question why  
Believe in yourself just belive in yourself  
  
Folks may say youre different  
That youve gone and lost your senses  
But the world is your to walk  
Go ahead and leave the fences  
And youll seeand youll see  
Belive in yourself  
And the world belongs to you  
You and me  
And the world belongs to you and me
