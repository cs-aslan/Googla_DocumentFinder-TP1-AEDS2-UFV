Youre looking at foreclosure  
And doing time  
And it dont sound good this time  
They found the meth and the scales  
And the wife that made your life Hell  
All that time you were telling me  
You were fine  
Silly man  
So I got your dog  
How is that  
I made it nice I wrote a check  
You cut the weeds back on my drive  
cause youre a good guy  
Deep down inside  
What makes a boy like you go bad  
What makes a man so lonely and sad  
That hes poison all he knows  
And in one year just let it go  
And all that time you were telling me  
You were fine  
Silly man youre a silly boy  
Its been you and me on this frontier  
Trying not to be suburban pioneers  
Fightin off the pavers  
And the associations  
And the covenants against the trailers  
I remember how we use to laugh  
At all those rotten men in camo drag  
With their advantage and their guns  
Up in the deer stand shooting up a storm  
And all that time  
You were telling me all those lies  
Silly man Im a silly girl  
You and me  
We used to hibernate like bears  
And when we finally came up for air  
Everythings all marked and cleared  
Survey flags flying everywhere  
Once you told me what  
What Ill miss the most  
Is just being the only ones  
With our dirt and our dead ends  
And no one to turn us in  
Once you told me what  
What Ill miss the most  
Is just being the only ones  
With our dirt and our dead ends  
And no one to turn us in
