The moon was shining bright in Carolina  
The night we said goodbye so tenderly  
And now that Im away from Carolina  
Wont somebody tell the moon for me  
  
Oh Carolina Moon keep shining  
Shining on the one who waits for me  
Carolina Moon Im pining  
Pining for the place I long to be  
  
How Im hopin tonight youll go  
Go to the right window  
Scatter your light  
Say Im all right please do  
  
Tell her that Im blue an lonely  
Dreamy Carolina Moon  
  
Tell her that Im blue an lonely  
Dreamy Carolina Moon
