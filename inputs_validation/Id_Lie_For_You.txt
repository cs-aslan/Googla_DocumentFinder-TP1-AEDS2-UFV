Id never tell you one lie  
Id never let you down  
Id never leave  
Id be the one whod always be around  
Baby give me a chance  
Id pull the sun down from the sky  
To light your darkest night  
I wouldnt let one drop of rain fall down into your life  
Put your heart in my hands  
Baby believe me I could never do you wrong  
And I would never paint your world blue  
And if sometimes it seems I must have lost my mind  
I might be crazy but Im crazy about you  
Id lie for you and thats the truth  
Do anything you asked me to  
Id even sell my soul for you  
Id do it all for you  
If you just believe in me  
Just take a look in my eyes  
Youll see a love thats blind  
Just take a hold of my hand  
And Ill take you to paradise  
Aint a star thats too far  
Your every wish will be a wish  
That I will make come true  
And if you want the moon  
I swear Ill bring it down for you  
Let me into your heart  
Believe me baby got your name carved on my soul  
Cause youre the only one that Ill give it to  
Go let em say that Im a fool to act this way  
Cause if Im crazy Im just crazy bout you  
Id lie for you and thats the truth  
Do anything you asked me to  
Id even sell my soul for you  
Id do it all for you  
If you just believe in me  
Id lie for you and thats the truth  
Move mountains if you want me to  
Id walk across the fire for you  
Id walk on the wild for you  
If you just believe in me  
And you will never see a day Ill ever break your heart  
Youll see the sky fall down before it ever gets that far  
Ill show you Heaven every second that youre in my arms  
Baby Im crazy but Im crazy bout you  
Id lie for you and thats the truth  
Move mountains if you want me to  
Id walk across the fire for you  
Id walk on the wild for you  
If you just believe in me  
Id walk across the wild for you  
Move mountains if you want me to  
Id walk across the fire for you  
Do anything you asked me to  
Id lie for you and thats the truth  
Do anything you asked me to  
Id even sell my soul for you  
Id do it all for you  
If you just believe in me  
Id lie for you and thats the truth  
Move mountains if you want me to  
Id walk across the fire for you  
Id walk on the wild for you  
If you just believe in me  
Id lie for you and thats the truth
