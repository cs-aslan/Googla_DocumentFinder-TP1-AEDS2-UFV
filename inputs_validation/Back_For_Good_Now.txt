P Diddy  
Uhh yeah you know what it is  
  
Black Rob  
Hey  back on the scene  
Aint nuthin changed  
Still doin wild things  
Whippin something mean  
The whole shorts in the Rolls Royce is off  
For sure bouncin the bar on my next world tour  
When we hit the sick Im the cure  
We bout to pop it off so wild hit the floor  
Aint nobody botherin you  
All Im thinkin bout is clobberin you  
Immigration always sayin Im harboring a few  
Illegal aliens  
Females mostly Latins and Israelians  
The top story evening news  
Im the shit they been deceiving you  
Drop the roof on the Coupe DVille  
Shoot to kill  
Ask niggas Duke is real  
Stay lookin for the loot to steal  
He determined  
Dont try to touch Bad Boy cause we burnin  
I want my glory  
Duke is not a joke and I aint gotta story  
Every time I grab the mic its with the sole intent  
To rip shots and give you 2OO percent  
Man Im tired of doin dirt  
Tired of being on the the run from Wyatt Earp  
Rather be somewhere in a quiet church sayin prayers  
Not only sayin mine but sayin theirs  
Thats cause my dogs aint there  
  
Chorus x2  
The more hits we make more money to burn  
The more fame we get niggas get concerned  
It dont matter whos hot whos out  
Bad Boy is Back For Good Now  
  
Loon  
Hey yo Im fresh off the plane  
Trying to get a little bit of stress off my brain  
MIA  
Dom P palm trees 9O degrees  
Arm freeze mom please aint nothin but cheese  
Caribbean Sea Malibu breeze  
Watchin DVDs on 5O inch screens  
So cut it out you aint now Don Juan please  
I stay spillin Dom on my Sean John jeans  
I hit the bar yo its all on me  
Pop bottles models be all on me  
You all goin see how its all gon be  
Front on me and see where you all gon be  
Six feet deep  
When the heat seek niggas be misty  
From 155th to 11Oth Street  
Harlem bound Bad Boy who the fuck want a problem now  
  
Chorus x2  
  
P Diddy  
See this is the part I like right here  
I like when I see everybody on the dance floor  
Yeah I see why yall just shakin your asses  
See man hold on I need to break it down  
Yeah  
One time like this  
  
Now would you clap your hands  
Your hands you clap  
If your girls outta place then your girl get tapped  
Niggas keep thinkin Diddy aint on it like that  
But you never see me standing on the corner like that  
Cause Im talented yes Im gifted  
Never boosted never shoplifted  
Forget get the cash the money aint nothin  
Cause everything I talk about you know I aint fronting  
I rock Sean John everyday  
Boutiques from France to the USA  
And I make all the chips off the hits I invent  
So it really doesnt matter how much I spent  
Cause Im droppin hits  
Daily  
You burn me  
Really  
Think Bad Boy been played a million times  
And I dont care if niggas write a billion rhymes  
Damn we still payed  
  
We still payed  
Yeah we got it made  
  
Loon  
Hey yo this game aint stoppin  
We champagne poppin  
Girl I got shit that your man aint coppin  
You could hop in when your man aint watchin  
Give you one option temperatures droppin  
Gettin cold control your soul when Im locked in  
You the type of chick that fold when you boxed in  
Signals my watch and givin you more reasons to hop in  
This is a Bentley not a Datsun  
Dont confuse me with dude Im not him  
Your man got a lot to learn  
But you could leave with the cat if you that concerned  
One day you goin actually learn  
But not now cause girl I got tracks to burn  
I stay on my JObe  
Nigga me P Diddy B areObe  
  
P Diddy  
The fam baby Bad Boy  
  
Chorus x4  
  
P Diddy  
Yeah I want to dedicate this to everybody that been down with us  
From day one  
Shakin them asses on the dance floor  
Thats all were tryin to do  
Mo money no mo problems  
2OO1 Bad Boy forever
