Late at night when youre all alone  
Take a ride to the danger zone  
If someone wants to cut you down to size  
You never argue with a loaded 45  
  
Just when youve had enough  
Its really getting tough  
  
Im ready for that hit between the eyes  
Someone get me out of here alive  
Im ready for that hit between the eyes  
Cant you see Im much too young to die  
  
You can feel the tension in the street  
Theres no escape getting closer to the heat  
You play with fire get your fingers burned  
Its too late past the point of no return  
  
Just when youve had enough  
Its really getting tough  
  
Im ready for that hit between the eyes  
Someone get me out of here alive  
Im ready for that hit between the eyes  
Cant you see Im much too young to die
