This is my fathers world  
And to my listening ears  
All nature sings and round me rings  
The music of the spheres  
This is my fathers world  
The birds their carols raise  
The morning light the lily white  
Declare their makers praise  
This is my fathers world  
I rest me in the thought  
Of rocks and trees of skies and seas  
His hand the wonders wrought  
This is my fathers world  
Oh let me never forget  
That though the wrong seems oft so strong  
God is the ruler yet  
This is my fathers world  
Why should my heart be sad  
The Lord is king let the heavens ring  
God reigns let the earth be glad  
This is my fathers world  
He shines in all thats fair  
In the rustling grass I hear him pass  
He speaks to me everywhere  
In the rustling grass I hear him pass  
He speaks to me everywhere
