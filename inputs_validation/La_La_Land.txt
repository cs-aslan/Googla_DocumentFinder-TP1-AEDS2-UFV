I am confident but  
I still have my moments  
Baby thats just me  
  
Im not a supermodel  
I still eat McDonalds  
Baby thats just me  
  
Chorus  
Well some may say I need to be afraid  
Of losing everything  
Because of where I  
Had my start and  
Where I made my name  
But everythings the same  
In a la la land machine Machine  
  
Who said I cant wear my  
Converse with my dress  
Oh baby thats just me  
  
And who said I cant be single  
I have to go out and mingle  
Baby thats not me  
No no  
  
Chorus  
  
Tell me do you feel the way I feel  
Cause nothing else is real  
In the lala land appeal  
  
Chorus  
  
Well Im not gonna change  
In a la la land machine  
Well I will stay the same  
In la la land  
  
Machine  
  
I wont change anything of my life  
I wont change anything of my life  
Im staying myself tonight  
Im staying myself tonight
