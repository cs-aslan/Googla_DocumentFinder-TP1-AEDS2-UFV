Well the stage was set the sun was sinking lowdown  
As they came to town to face another showdown  
The lawmen cleared the people from the street  
All you blood thirsty bystanders will you try to find your seat  
  
Watch em duelin DoolinDalton  
High or low its all the same  
Easy money an faithless women  
You will never kill the pain  
  
Go down Bill Doolin dont you wonder why  
Sooner or later we all have to die  
Sooner or later thats a stone cold fact  
Four men ride out and only three ride back
