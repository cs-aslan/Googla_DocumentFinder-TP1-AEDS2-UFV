I snuck around the corner he had this guy down  
I through the first punch thats when he hit the ground  
To survive in the street you gotta win the first round  
cause if you want eat you gotta be the baddest one around  
Im a backstreet crawler  
  
Daddy paid for college I earned a degree  
Got a job up on Wall Street  
Where I learned to make the little man bleed  
Thats when I got stomped like a cattle stampede  
Had a nervous breakdown all my friends and family left me  
  
Yeah Im a backstreet crawler  
When you see them on the concrete its their spirit thats harder  
Yeah Im a backstreet crawler  
Where your ego meets defeat and your pride cant get no smaller  
Yeah Im a backstreet crawler  
Yeah Im a backstreet crawler  
  
I guess you might say it sure is a shame  
I used to have everything oh how my life has changed  
Yeah Im broken and torn Ive never been free  
Lost everything that meant a thing to me  
  
Yeah Im a backstreet crawler  
When you see them on the concrete its their spirit thats harder  
Yeah Im a backstreet crawler  
Where your ego meets defeat and your pride cant get no smaller  
Yeah Im a backstreet crawler  
Yeah Im a backstreet crawler
