Ive got a bird that whistles  
Ive got a bird that sings  
Ive got a bird that    Ive got a bird     
Im worried about that bird  
And I worry about everything  
And I worry when I see my subjects  
Bow down to the Worrier King  
Well Im hiding from the mailman  
And I hate to hear the telephone ring  
Im hiding from the mailman  
And I hate to hear the telephone  
Worried about the women  
And I worry about everything  
And I worry when I see my subjects  
Bow down to the Worrier King  
Ive been up all night  
Wondering what Novembers gonna bring  
Worried about my country  
And I worry about everything  
And I worry when I see my subjects  
Bow down to the Worrier King  
Worried about my bird  
And I worry about everything  
And I worry when I see my subjects  
Bow down to the Worrier King
