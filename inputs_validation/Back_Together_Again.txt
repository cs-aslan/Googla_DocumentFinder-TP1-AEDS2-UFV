Leaving aint fair you know  
Parting aint just  
People got to move on  
People got to do what they must  
And were back together again  
And Im never gonna lose you as a friend  
  
Growing up free  
Growing up wild  
If you want to know the secret behind the smile  
You got to ask a Tuesdays child  
And were back together again  
And Im never gonna lose you as a friend  
  
Well I guess that highway got a hold of me  
Thinking crazy thoughts like it was going to set me free  
  
This aint my place you know  
This aint my home  
And Im not going to feel right  
Til you get us back behind the microphones  
And were back together again  
And Im never gonna lose you as a friend  
No Im never gonna lose you as a friend  
No Im never gonna lose you as a friend
