m  grosskopf l  kiske  
  
Thunder flash and lightning  
Is working on my back  
The tables in the kitchen  
Are tryin to break my neck  
  
All the late night memories  
Are leaning in my shoes  
My mothers old grey  
Leather gloves are singing loud the blues  
  
I can taste whats in the sun  
No time to waste cause there is none  
When I feel blue I see it shine  
But still its true Im doin fine  
  
You cant see me  
cause now Im all free  
Now you know Im through  
An all thats not new  
  
Sitting on a paperback  
cause I dont know what really cracks  
Im trying to climb my pencil  
To get high  
  
No one tells me what to do  
cause no one knows what Ive been through  
You dont know a thing  
But you can learn  
  
Its time to touch the sky  
My mind is free I fly  
  
I can taste whats in the sun  
No time to waste cause there is none  
When I feel blue I see it shine  
But still its true Im doin fine  
  
You cant see me  
cause now Im all free  
Now you know Im through  
An all thats not new
