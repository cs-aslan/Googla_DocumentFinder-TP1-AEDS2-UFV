So youre a self proclaimed messiah  
Or maybe a blasphemes liar  
A clever hypnotic hoax  
A hallowed heretic coax  
Who tells these stories so old  
No never the same twice told  
Speaking in distorted truths  
I see that Thomas wants some proof  
Did you come to heal the sick  
With one more magicians trick  
Ye generation seeks a sign  
While blind keeps leading the blind  
  
So you say there is no god  
Just a clever mans charade  
A once upon a fairy tales fraud  
Has god made man or man made god  
  
There is no god  
Confused thy talk in parables  
Accused thou walk in parallels  
A simple game of Simon says  
This months flavor sciences  
Todays fact tomorrows fiction  
Leave the rest to superstition  
If knowledge comes from learning books  
Wisdom comes from discerning looks  
A fool that says there is no god  
Dont feel for that sorry sod  
Who needs proof then hell believe  
I wonder if hes been deceived  
  
There is no god
