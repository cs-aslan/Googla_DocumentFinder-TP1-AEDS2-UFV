We have the chance to turn the pages over  
We can write what we want to write  
We gotta make ends meet before we get much older  
Were all someones daughter Were all someones son  
How long can we look at each other Down the barrel of a gun  
Youre the voice try and understand it  
Make a noise and make it clear  
Ohwowowo ohwowowo  
Were not gonna sit in silence  
Were not gonna live with fear  
Ohwowowo ohwowowo  
This time we know we all can stand together  
With the power to be powerful  
Believing we can make it better  
Were all someones daughter  
Were all someones son  
How long can we look at each other  
Down the barrel of a gun
