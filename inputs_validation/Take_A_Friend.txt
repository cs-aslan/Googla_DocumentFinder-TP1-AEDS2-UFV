Well Im looking at you  
And Im wondering what youre gonna do  
Looks like you got no friends  
No one to stick with you till the end  
  
Take yourself a friend  
Keep em till the end  
Whether woman or man  
It makes you feel so good  
So good  
  
Yes you think youre all right  
And now youre lonely every night  
Well you need a friend  
Someone on whom you can always depend  
  
Take yourself a friend  
Keep em till the end  
Whether woman or man  
It makes you feel so good  
So good  
  
Yes you need some advice  
Well let me put it to you nice  
I said you need a friend  
Someone wholl stick with you to the end  
  
Take yourself a friend  
Keep em till the end  
Whether woman or man  
It makes you feel so good  
So good
