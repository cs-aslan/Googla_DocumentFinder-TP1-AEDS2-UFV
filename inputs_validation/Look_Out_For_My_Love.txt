Theres a lot to learn  
For wasting time  
Theres a heart that burns  
Theres an open mind  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
You own it  
You own it now  
You own it  
Theres a weight on you  
But you cant feel it  
Living like I do  
Its hard for you to see it  
Was I hurt too bad  
Can I show you daylight  
How can I be sad  
When I know that you might  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Its in your neighborhood  
I know things are gonna change  
But I cant say bad or good  
Theres a lot to learn  
For wasting time  
Theres a heart that burns  
Theres an open mind  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love
