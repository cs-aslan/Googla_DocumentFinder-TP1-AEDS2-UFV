Hush little baby dont you cry  
When we get to Tucson youll see why  
We left the snowstorms and the thunder and rain  
For the desert sun were gonna be born again  
Whats important in this world  
A little boy a little girl  
  
Hush little darling go to sleep  
Look out the window and count the sheep  
That dot the hillsides and the fields of wheat  
Across America as we cross America  
Whats important here today  
The broken line on the highway  
  
All the love in the world for you girl  
Thumbelina in a great big scary world  
All the love in the world for you girl  
Take my hand and well make it through this world  
  
Hush little baby my poor little thing  
Youve been shuffled about like a pawned wedding ring  
It must seem strange love was here then gone  
And the Oklahoma sunrise becomes the Amarillo dawn  
Whats important in this life  
Ask the man whos lost his wife
