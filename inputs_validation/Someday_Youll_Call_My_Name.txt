Someday youll F call my name and I wont Bb answer  
Someday youll F reach for me I wont be C7 there  
For youve grown F tired of all the love I Bb gave you  
But someF day youll C7 wish that I still F care  
  
C7 All these years how Ive F loved you  
Still I G know I claim you for my C7 own  
Someday youll F call my name and I wont Bb answer  
For someF day youll C7 find yourself aF lone  
  
When you hair has turned from Gold to Silver  
And your eyes are dimmed by passing years  
Youll remember darling what I told you  
Therell be no one then to dry your tears  
  
Therell come a time in your life dear  
When youll need someone who will care  
Someday youll call my name and I wont answer  
For someday youll find that Im not there
