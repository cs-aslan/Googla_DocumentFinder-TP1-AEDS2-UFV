Maybe Im insane  
Walking on a wire  
Maybe Im the same  
Nothing to take me higher  
Tell me where to start  
Think Im at the end  
Right now feeling pain  
Make it go away  
  
Maybe Im to blame  
Maybe Im a liar  
Maybe were the same  
Nothing can start the fire  
I cant feel my heart  
But I feel the shame  
Nothing left to say  
Soon Ill fade away  
  
These places all I ever think about is lost in time  
These faces haunting me  
Im looking back and they are mine  
  
Im hiding from the things they say  
Doing time and lead astray  
Thinking back to times of yesterday  
I could fly  
  
Im trying to find a better way  
But Im trapped  
Cant get away  
All I think is about yesterday  
I could fly  
  
Maybe Im insane  
Walking on a wire  
Maybe Im the same  
Nothing to take me higher  
I cant feel my heart  
But I feel the shame  
Nothing left to say  
Soon Ill fade away  
  
These places all I ever think about is lost in time  
These faces haunting me  
Im looking back and they are mine  
  
Im hiding from the things they say  
Doing time and lead astray  
Thinking back to times of yesterday  
I could fly  
  
Im trying to find a better way  
But Im trapped  
Cant get away  
All I think is about yesterday  
I could fly
