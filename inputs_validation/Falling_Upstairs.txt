Long before I ever saw your face  
I got to know you in a dream  
But things arent always what they seem  
You learn along the way  
  
I just cant stop myself from breaking down  
Its just no good unless you come around  
I turn into a monster  
all my friends agree  
  
So goodnight  
Im going to bed  
Im falling upstairs to meet you  
I wake up with memories in my head  
Im someone else instead  
Fallin upstairs to you  
  
You came to me from secret place  
Youre beautiful and strange to me  
Just like an antique melody  
Too sad for me to play  
  
I hope youll wait for me behind closed eyes  
I know Ill search for you all through the night  
Till when the dawn breaks in and throws its light  
Around the room  
  
Goodnight  
Im going to bed  
Im falling upstairs to meet you  
I wake up with memories in my head  
Im somewhere else instead  
Falling upstairs to you  
Falling upstairs to you
