Shut up  
Shut up  
Shut up  
Shut up  
When Im talkin to you  
Shut up  
Shut up  
Shut up  
Shut up  
  
Im about to  
Wasnt that fun  
Lets try something else else else else  
  
Point 45 caliber killer out of the filla  
Elevated show your brothas how your not a gorilla  
Smooth talking fully automatic weapon constiller  
Taste thrilla great filler  
Hit him like a Godzilla  
Filthy stinking standing on the side of the ground  
Still be sinking submerging in the parks  
Still be linking plucked beats when it starts  
Hope your thinking its not a mirage  
Im in a mother fucking tractor without a disguise  
Well if you could duck but its hard to dodge  
In the back of that spine where my darkness lies  
Flippin straight up ripping apart your side  
XEcutioners style cuts and blends  
Like a syringe banging you in each of your limbs  
See me coming through your party hard  
Without no body guard  
Smoking something stomping on each of your tims  
Im a B to the L to A to C king  
And when it comes around I hear the key thing its  
  
Shut up  
Shut up  
Shut up  
Shut up  
Shut up  
Shut up  
Shut up  
Shut up
