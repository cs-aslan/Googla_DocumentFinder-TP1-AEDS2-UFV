Chorus  
Just ball till you fall  
Cuz imma ball until I fall  
So youd better ball until you fall  
Just ball till you fall  
  
It dont stop yall x4  
  
Verse  
Im the substitution I came in this game as a helpin hand  
In the post when Im close Im like Elton Brand  
My passes go around the ball like a belt through pants  
And Im for the green yeah somethin like a Celtics fan  
Me and my team came in G4 dozen seaters  
Just in time call us the buzzer beaters  
Its big shot Fab I spin like vinyl records  
You could tell I want the ball in the final seconds  
I keep some change on me  
Im a winner I should be in the locker room lettin em pour champagne on me  
My hommies got a soft one throw me in a lob one  
Good on the first three Im Kobe on this fourth one  
  
Chorus  
Just ball till you fall  
Cuz imma ball until I fall  
So youd better ball until you fall  
Just ball till you fall  
  
It dont stop yall x4  
  
Verse  
Oh man the children have seen us  
We fill the arenas  
The hottest tour I wizz throughem like Gilbert Arenas  
Imma ball till I fall and Im restin in heaven  
In the 60 IL thats the best of the sevens  
No games played your boy dropped through like the  
In the passenger Im mashinem  
Dunkin off the glass onem  
These other players with full court press harassinem  
Yeah Im in the zone  
Colors in the stones  
They look they hookem sorta like they playbook  
Thats the flagrant foul that could get you a suspension  
They want me to dunk onem just to get them some attention  
  
Chorus  
Just ball till you fall  
Cuz imma ball until I fall  
So youd better ball until you fall  
Just ball till you fall

Verse  
And Im a baller  
Sawem carryin this shit  
My Suns with me like Stoudamire Marion and Nash  
Just like the Lakers during showtime  
With the slow rhyme you know Im gonna step it up during OTime  
Back like the Cavs with Lebron  
Your boy be havin it on  
White and gold gleam on the whole team  
I spin like a mixer  
Sorta like a trickster  
The SI to the X I callem the Sixers  
I beg your pardon I should live with the guards  
I spend my time point guardin  
Amx black car nothin with the plastic  
Its goes through like we cuttin to the basket lookin for the hoop  
  
Chorus  
Just ball till you fall  
Cuz imma ball until I fall  
So youd better ball until you fall  
Just ball till you fall
