Ive got the hair  
Ive got the teeth  
Ive got the eyes  
Well Peggy take a look outside the window  
  
Ive got the car  
Im the lead singer  
Im the man  
She she come to me and set me free  
  
That makes me feel good  
She shes New York grown Im all alone  
She makes me feel good  
Never going down a suckerpath baby  
  
She she makes me real and sex appeal  
That makes me feel good  
She she fills my soul it makes me whole  
That makes me feel good  
  
Never going down a suckerpath baby  
Now all day as youre calling me lazy  
Never going down the suckerpath baby  
Never go down never go down  
  
She treats me like a foolish child  
And laughing all the while  
Makes me want to be alive  
She sees me in a different light  
  
And knows Ill be alright  
Makes me want to be alive  
All the things I could have said  
Some days now I wish Im dead  
  
A foolish child an awesome dream  
I think you know just what I mean  
Never going down a suckerpath baby  
Come on come on  
  
You dont want to ride me I dont even care  
You dont even move my style now  
I dont even care now
