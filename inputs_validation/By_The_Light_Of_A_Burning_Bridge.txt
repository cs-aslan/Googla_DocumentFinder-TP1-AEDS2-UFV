Oh Ive been stumblin through the darkness  
Tryin to feel the ground beneath my feet  
Afraid of movin much in any direction  
Stuck where the past and the future meet  
  
But I finlly got my first good look  
A little fire was all it too  
An as the flames grew brighter  
I saw everything that Id missed  
Once you get your courage up  
You light a match an your eyes adjust  
Its amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin bridge  
  
An there were things I saw that Im not proud of  
Things that Id do diffrent now from then  
But when I really make myself get honest  
Its over and I cant go back again  
  
Cause I finlly got my first good look  
A little fire was all it took  
An as the flames grew brighter  
I saw everything that Id missed  
Once you get your courage up  
You light a match an your eyes adjust  
Its amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin bridge  
  
It sure is hard to let go and to leave the past behind  
But there aint no other way that you can find some peace of mind  
  
When I finlly got my first good look  
A little fire was all it took  
An as the flames grew brighter  
I saw everything that Id missed  
Once you get your courage up  
You light a match an your eyes adjust  
Its amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin bridge  
Its amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin bridge
