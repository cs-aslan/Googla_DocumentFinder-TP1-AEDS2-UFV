Making love in an ice cold room  
We start til the candle burns  gone  
Kissing each other til the moon says byebye  
And the sun says hello  
  
Lying here with no blanket  
The rooms temperature is subzero  
Baby bring your body closer  
Cause you keep me warm when youre naked  
  
Lets feed on love until we get freezer burn freezer burn freezer burn  
Making out in this ice box til we get freezer burn freezer burn freezer
burn  
Lets keep on keep on freezin  
Hold me tight oh Im not leavin  
Lets keep on loving til we get freezer burn freezer burn freezer burn  
  
Sweat drippin up our bodies breathin small  
While youre whispering to me  
Ice crystal in this small small bed  
But we make frost when were touching like that  
  
Laying here with no blanket  
The rooms temperature is subzero  
Baby bring your body closer  
Cause you keep me warm when youre naked  
  
Lets feed on love until we get freezer burn freezer burn freezer burn  
Making out in this ice box til we get feezer burn freezer burn freezer
burn  
Lets keep on keep on freezin  
Hold me tight oh Im not leavin  
Lets keep on loving til we get freezer burn freezer burn freezer burn  
  
Snowflakes at the tip of my fingers  
Frozen in time our love lingers  
Livin in a world so cold  
Sometimes our hearts are just like icicles  
  
Being with you is all I need  
Theres nothing we cant handle babe  
Lay on my chest please cover me  
Deep frost on this bed memories  
  
Lets feed on love until we get freezer burn freezer burn freezer burn  
Making out in this ice box til we get feezer burn freezer burn freezer

Lets keep on keep on freezin  
Hold me tight oh Im not leavin  
Lets keep on loving til we get freezer burn freezer burn freezer burn
