Is there a remedy for the passions of the soul  
Brother if there is one I dont really know  
Have I let my imagination run out of control  
Im a rainbow  
Just a rainbow  
  
Am I living here in this nameless state  
Its light on darkness sound of silence  
I just cant get it straight  
See I dont wanna be no one that I aint  
Im a rainbow  
Just a rainbow  
  
And all the colors that you see  
Are all part of me  
In this crazy world of mine  
  
Like the wind that blows  
The trees are sailing for the breeze  
Ever changing all the time  
  
Im a rainbow just a rainbow  
Ever changing all the time  
Im a rainbow colorful rainbow  
Sometimes I shine  
  
And all the colors that you see  
Are all part of me  
In this crazy world of mine  
  
Like the wind that blows  
The trees are sailing for the breeze  
Ever changing all the time  
  
Da da da dada  
  
Like the wind that blows  
The trees are sailing for the breeze  
Ever changing all the time  
  
Im a rainbow just a rainbow  
And sometimes I can shine  
Im a rainbow just a rainbow
