Just an old fashioned love song  
Playin on the radio  
And wrapped around the music  
Is the sound of someone  
Promising theyll never go  
Youll swear youve heard it before  
As it slowly rambles on and on  
No need in bringing em back  
Cause theyve never really gone  
  
Just an old fashioned love song  
Comin down in three part harmony  
Just an old fashioned love song  
One Im sure they wrote for you and me  
  
To weave our dreams upon  
And listen to each evening  
When the lights are low  
To underscore our love affair  
With tenderness and feelings  
That weve come to know  
Youll swear youve heard it before  
As it slowly rambles on and on  
No need in bringin em back  
Cause theyve never really gone  
  
Just an old fashioned love song  
Comin down in three part harmony  
Just an old fashioned love song  
One Im sure they wrote for you and me  
  
Hit it  
Wooh Just an old fashioned love song  
Comin down in three part harmony  
Just an old fashioned love song  
One Im sure they wrote for you and me  
  
Just an old fashioned love song  
Comin down in three part harmony  
Just an old fashioned love song  
One Im sure they wrote for you and me fade
