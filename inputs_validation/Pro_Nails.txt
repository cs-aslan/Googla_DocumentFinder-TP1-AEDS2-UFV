Shake it up up rock ya body  
Make it knock knock when you partyin  
Take a break break in the audience  
Do ya footwork break and stop again  
  
Im lookin sharp  
You cant compete with the champ  
Steady flickin  
Im holdin done that layaway rack  
  
Aye rhinestones all in they face  
Gold charms and paper chase  
Talk smack from around the way  
Gotta put these chickenheads in they place  
  
I aint rockin no stupid babes  
I aint trippin I juke all day  
I aint slippin cause either way  
When I hit the block all the people say

Aye yo this mothafucka jammin Im on it its a anthem  
Who is that in the Phantom Please no cameras  
They gone have me on concrete loot in my pajamas  
To hide the goods I would need pants big as Hammers  
  
I be tippin them dancers they be sayin Im handsome  
I was pretty before the dough but now Im just the man  
You remind me of my old chick on that 84 shit  
Oh shit did you see the way she got her toes did

Girls be so thirsty thirsty  
Fast forward to the end of my song  
And say third verse me verse me  
Whenever I hit the block I see  
  
Tricks try to rehearse me hearse me  
From manicure sets to silky weaves  
They be so grimy nasty bogus  
Turkey germy dirty  
  
Uh oh Shol did you aint slick no  
Let the pioneer blast my shit  
Wait a minute hold up nigga  
Bubble letters on my butt say fresh  
  
Oops Ima go nails like whoa  
Acrylic base top all gold  
Clothes on my back to the paint on my toes  
Stay fresh cause Im accustomed to gold  
  
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin

Toes toes done up with her fingernails matchin
