I went looking for someone I couldnt find  
Staring at faces by the Serpentine  
Walking slowly I realised  
Youd been and gone I know you lied  
Thats my impression Repeats  
  
The wind was chilly and the sky was dull  
I went for shelter to the temple  
Once inside I couldnt believe my eyes  
Youd been and gone I know you lied  
Thats my impression Repeats  
  
Go to a club you think Ill be there  
I dont go cause Im not a member  
You said you went to apologize  
Its plain to me thats one more lie  
Thats my impression Repeats  
  
I went looking for someone I couldnt find  
Staring at faces by the Serpentine  
Walking slowly I realized  
Youd been and gone I know you lied  
Thats my impression Repeats  
Its an expression  
And a suggestion  
I learned my lesson  
Thats my impression  
Thats my impression impression  
Thats my impression  
Thats my impression impression  
I learned my lesson  
  
I went looking for someone I couldnt find  
Staring at faces by the Serpentine  
Walking slowly I realized  
Youd been and gone I know  
You lied thats my impression  
I know you lied  
And thats my impression  
Thats my impression  
My impression  
Thats my impression
