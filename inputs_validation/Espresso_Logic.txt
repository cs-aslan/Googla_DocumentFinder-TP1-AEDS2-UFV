If you dont listen what the people say  
The people gonna have to take their own way  
You got to give the people what they need  
And only then will they begin to see  
  
Theres a world that we dont know  
Theres a world we never see  
Espresso  
  
I dont need this trouble I dont need the grief  
I dont need to feel this pressure down on me  
Every day theres something we dont really need  
Stop think walk away and let it be  
Stop think walk away and let it be  
Espresso  
  
Theres a world that we dont know  
Theres a world we never see  
Espresso
