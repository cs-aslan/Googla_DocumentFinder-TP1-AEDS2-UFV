Christmas day joyous feast of all peoples  
Heaven and earth resound with glad praise  
Angels descending sing forth His glory  
Bringing us faith hope love all our days  
Bringing us faith hope love all our days  
  
Bethlehems star with radiance beaming  
Fills human hearts with heavenly mirth  
Gods loving message brings new assurance  
So let the world proclaim Jesus birth  
So let the world proclaim Jesus birth  
  
In adoration widows and orphans  
Whose hearts are burdened turn unto Heavn  
In faith and hope and love they can pray now  
Since Jesus Savior is to them givn  
Since Jesus Savior is to them givn  
  
Joy we behold on earth and in Heaven  
Wonderful Yuletide blessings from Him  
Joy everlasting gladden all hearts now  
Bring to the world peace goodwill to men  
  
Bring to the world peace goodwill to men
