Exitin the shower  
I forgot to wash my heart  
Now the dust has turned to mud  
Since weve been apart  
This angel whispered in my ear  
As I brushed my teeth  
She said  
Muddy hearts work twice as hard  
And still can barely beat  
I know its true  
I exit through you  
  
You always did understand  
That time ticks away  
Everything you ever give  
To cure you of delay  
Weve both been here so very long  
Now we just pretend  
To be head over heels in love  
Like weve been saved again  
Its true  
I exit through you  
Exit through you  
  
What use is it to wash that stuff away  
In every place that we have run to  
All that weve begun with was here to stay  
  
Exitin the shower  
I forgot to wash my heart  
Now the dust has turned to mud  
Since weve been apart  
This angel whispered in my ear  
As I brushed my teeth  
She said  
Muddy hearts work twice as hard  
And still can barely beat  
  
Your eyes like brandin irons  
Make impressions on my skin  
I burn so very easy  
When Im proud of who I am  
It feels like rigor mortis  
But it tastes like bubblegum  
All these words you need to say  
Theyre on the tip of your tongue  
Its true  
I exit through you  
Exit through you  
  
What use is it  
To wash that stuff away  
In every place  
That we have run to  
All that weve begun  
With was there to stay  
  
When my days have been clocked  
And all the gates  
Have been locked  
When the way is all blocked  
I exit through you  
Theres only one way out  
  
Exitin the shower  
I forgot to wash my heart  
Now the dust has turned to mud  
Since weve been apart  
This angel whispered in my ear  
As I brushed my teeth  
She said  
Muddy hearts work twice as hard  
And still can barely beat  
  
Theres only one way out  
Only one way out  
  
Exitin the shower  
I forgot to wash my heart  
Now the dust is turned to mud  
Since weve been apart  
This angel whispered in my ear  
As I brushed my teeth  
She said  
Muddy hearts work twice as hard  
And still can barely beat  
  
Only one way  
I exit through you  
  
Exit through you  
  
One way out
