Oh it cant be GOOD music my Grammy Family  
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry  
Now Im hoppin out the limo or either the Lam B  
But you niggaz gon get in til you get to Miami  
  
GLC gon be stoned as Angie  
I be Don C Johnny Patrone and me  
Its a celebration bitches more bottles of champaign  
I aint in love with the same stripper that sprung T  
Pain and all this Louis Vuitton shit aint cheap man  
  
Dawg I cant keep sayin GOOD music the greatest latest  
Stuntin out the middle of nowhere like Vegas  
From the Chi the city of hella haters  
Where we keep risin to the top like elevators  
  
Hi haters Im back of hiatus  
I feel just like you I mean even I hate us  
Turn the radio down I mean every song  
Yeezy got a vision thats clearer than Evian  
Used to hit the radio them faggots aint let me on  
  
Until Khaled turned up the volume  
Hit the club wit it come on homie they wildin  
Nas done told you come on homie we major  
Really Doe told you hoes where we stayin  
GOOD music up in this bitch now quit playin  
  
Dawg it cant be GOOD music the Grammy Family  
A little bit a stuntin flickin dawg it aint deep  
Im only tryin to spend what they claim you cant keep  
Before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side  
Like Lake Shore Drive The Grammy Family  
  
Its the Cons fool word  
  
No it cant be GOOD music my Grammy Family  
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry  
Now we hoppin out the limo or either the Lam B  
And after music meeting wit evenings with Angie  
  
Its gon prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me  
And we be in Miami so when they spot me in Bentley  
Its gon be a stampede cuz we be racin Bentleys  
No different than Grand Prixs  
  
Fam please dont make my man squeeze  
And we can take it to the cars and Ill show you the hand speed  
I started independent with owners from land speed  
But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed  
  
And since I got my shot like I was call and man be  
I hope they lose they spot guarantee a plan B  
Well be waitin in the telly like Jamie and Fancy  
  
Prolly paintin they nails in nuthin but they panties  
And well be up town Jimmy and Camby  
Headed to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby  
  
They cant breathe or hardly catch they next breath  
And I know my nigga Ye told you we was the best dressed  
I know I got a buzz so plan up the next step  
  
So what yall wanna do when it comes to that next check  
And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is  
So open up them envelopes you know who the winners is  
  
The Grammy Family  
On Grammy night call it GOOD family night  
Celebrate tonight oh its alright its alright yeah
