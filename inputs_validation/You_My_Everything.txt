You my everything  
You my everything  
  
You are my only hope  
The truth that dealt the consequence  
I know you dont feel the same  
Youre sensible but it doesnt make sense  
I know Im gonna weep my heart out  
You know Im gonna try much harder  
But it isnt the shit in my head  
Pulling me under this time  
  
Could have given me something  
You my everything  
You left me kneeling  
I was one of those people  
You my everything  
You my everything  
You my everything  
  
You were my backbone when  
The truth that dealt the consequence  
You were my hometown when  
My heart was filled with loneliness  
Just as the dark was rising  
You know Im gonna try much harder  
But it isnt the shit in my head  
Pulling me under this time  
  
Could have given me something  
You my everything  
You left me kneeling  
I was one of those people  
You my everything  
You my everything  
You my everything  
  
Could have given me something  
You my everything  
You left me kneeling  
You my everything  
I was one of those people  
You my everything  
  
For what its worth  
For what its worth  
For what its worth  
  
You were my backbone when  
My body ached with wearyness  
You were my hometown when  
My heart was filled with loneliness  
Just as the dark was rising  
I heard you close the door again  
Just as the light turns out  
I know who I dream of
