Live your loving life  
Live it all the best you can  
And if you pay no attention darling  
To what you might ever hear from your man  
I think youre just like a servant  
  
And try to keep it all to yourself  
Dont you know it makes the world go round  
You gotta go and honey share everywhere else  
Come on come on come on  
  
As good as youve been to this world  
So good I want to be right back to you  
As good as youve been now  
As good as youve been to this whole wide world  
  
So good I want to be  
As good as youve been now say  
As good as youve been to this whole wide world  
As good as youve been babe  
So good I want to be here  
  
Aint no use in being faithful  
I see you look at the sky  
I know whats in it make you happy there  
But it only make you cry  
I think you got good intentions too  
  
They dont manage to show through  
Whatever you give to the world outside  
I want to give it right back to you yes I am  
Come on come on come on  
  
So you meet somebody on the street  
You know you treat him mighty fine  
Or you meet somebody on the street  
And you give him a real hard time
