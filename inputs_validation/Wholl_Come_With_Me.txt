Wholl come with me dont be afraid I know the way  
Wholl sing with me dont be afraid ill show the way  
Wholl dance with me all through the world dont be afraid I know the way  
Well come with you to search the way to find the star  
Wholl come with us dont be afraid we found the way  
Wholl come with me to reach my star dont be afraid ill show the way  
Wholl be my friend and walk with me and sing this song  
Wholl love will be well change the world and set it free  
Well walk with you  
Well be your friend  
Well sing your song  
We know the way
