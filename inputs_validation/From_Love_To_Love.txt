Well if you want me then just take my hand  
And if you dont I will understand  
Its just a call from deep within my soul  
The burning question I have got to know  
  
Take a message from love to love  
Take it down from love to love  
Girl its you Im thinking of  
Ill send this letter from love to love  
And if I ask you will you take this dance  
Please dont think youre taking some big chance  
Its just a fire and it burns for you  
You know theres one thing that youve got to do  
  
Take a message from love to love  
Take it down from love to love  
Girl its you Im thinking of  
Ill send this letter from love to love  
  
Ill share your secrets on a rainy day  
Cause if youll have me then well be away  
Oh theres a fire and it burns for you  
You know theres one thing that youve got to do  
  
Take a message from love to love  
Take it down from love to love  
Girl its you Im thinking of  
Ill send this letter from love to love
