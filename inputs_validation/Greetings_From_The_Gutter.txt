Thats what youve got to do when its all over  
Thats what youve got to do when its all over  
Thats what youve got to do when its all over  
Thats what youve got to do when its all over  
Greetings from the gutter  
Ive been here since yesterday  
Sweet dreams in the gutter  
All the skeletons come out to play  
At times I feel so logical inside  
So just give me the keys  
And Ill drive myself back home  
Thats what youve got to do when its all over  
Thats what youve got to do when its all over  
Thats what youve got to do when its all over  
Thats what youve got to do when its all over  
I stand in the mirror counting the scars I let you see  
A little soft edged but bitter  
Youre a star you dont talk to me  
Thats what youve got to do when its all over  
Thats what youve got to do when its all over  
Thats what youve got to do when its all over  
Thats what youve got to do when its all over
