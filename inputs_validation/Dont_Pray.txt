An extra mile across the line I kiss my Judas one more time  
I die for your sin  
Life is simple life is sweet  
The perspective from down on your knees will kill you from within  
Fortune and fame torture and shame  
Think twice before you speak  
Glory and blame its all the same  
My game is your defeat  
Chorus Dont pray for me  
I dont need your sympathy  
I dont want your god protecting me  
Dont pray for me  
I dont want your empathy  
I dont need your savior saving me  
Dont pray for me  
I dont care what book you quote  
Your poison is my antidote  
I dont burn and I dont bleed  
Wrap that guilt up deep inside  
Religion has an alibi  
What more could you need  
Fortune and fame torture and shame  
You still dont understand  
Glory and blame its all the same  
Some things go hand in hand  
Chorus Dont pray for me  
I dont need your sympathy  
I dont want your god protecting me  
Dont pray for me  
I dont want your empathy  
I dont need your savior saving me  
Dont pray for me  
Sacrifice the innocence  
Will you illiminate the decadance  
You celebrate the enemy  
Well blind your eyes and steal your dreams  
Chorus Dont pray for me  
I dont need your sympathy  
I dont want your god protecting me  
Dont pray for me  
I dont want your empathy  
I dont need your savior saving me  
Dont pray for me
