  
  
I cant go out no more  
  
I just better stay at home  
  
I just better stay all alone  
  
cause what am I gonna do  
  
if I see someone Id like to do  
  
something to  
  
what am I gonna say  
  
if I see someone Id like to say  
  
something to  
  
if I see someone whod like to do  
  
something too  
  
I cant help being careful  
  
did you notice the world  
  
that were living in  
  
did you notice did you see  
  
something might happen to me  
  
did you notice a chill in the wind  
  
people are dying  
  
just because they had a little  
  
girlfriend is not my girlfriend  
  
my neighbor is not my lover  
  
boyfriend is not my boyfriend  
  
my brother is not my lover  
  
behavior is not my behavior  
  
my neighbor is not my savior  
  
didnt you notice the world  
  
that were living in
