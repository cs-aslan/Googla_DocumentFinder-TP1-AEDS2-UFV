I need a drink  
Dont want to think  
I drink too much  
But whos to say  
Whats right or wrong  
  
I guess you think you see  
Youre tellin me  
That I dont know  
When its passed the point  
Of feelin good  
I run around and find  
I just cant get satisfied  
Tonight  
  
Now theres a phone  
I hear the sound  
I needed to talk  
But its too late  
For talkin now  
  
I guess Ill go alone  
I feel a glow  
Here I am  
Here I am  
Here I am  
What I need is a friend tonight  
What I need is a friend  
What I need is someone  
What I really deed is just one more drink  
Tonight  
Tonight
