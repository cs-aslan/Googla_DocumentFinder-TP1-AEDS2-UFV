Someones got it in for me theyre planting stories in the press  
Whoever it is I wish theyd cut it out but when they will I can only guess  
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy  
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me  
I cant help it if Im lucky  
  
People see me all the time and they just cant remember how to act  
Their minds are filled with big ideas images and distorted facts  
Even you yesterday you had to ask me where it was at  
I couldnt believe after all these years you didnt know me better than that  
Sweet lady  
  
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth  
Blowing down the back roads headin south  
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth  
Youre an idiot babe  
Its a wonder that you still know how to breathe  
  
I ran into the fortuneteller who said beware of lightning that might strike  
I havent known peace and quiet for so long I cant remember what its like  
Theres a lone soldier on the cross smoke pourin out of a boxcar door  
You didnt know it you didnt think it could be done in the final end he won
the wars  
After losin every battle  
  
I woke up on the roadside daydreamin bout the way things sometimes are  
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin me see
stars  
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies  
One day youll be in the ditch flies buzzin around your eyes  
Blood on your saddle  
  
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb  
Blowing through the curtains in your room  
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth  
Youre an idiot babe  
Its a wonder that you still know how to breathe  
  
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart  
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasnt enough to change my heart  
Now everythings a little upside down as a matter of fact the wheels have
stopped  
Whats good is bad whats bad is good youll find out when you reach the top  
Youre on the bottom  
  
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind  
I cant remember your face anymore your mouth has changed your eyes  
Dont look into mine  
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stonefaced while the
building  
Burned  
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress trees while the
springtime  
Turned Slowly into autumn  
  
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull  
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol  
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth  
Youre an idiot babe  
Its a wonder that you still know how to breathe  
  
I cant feel you anymore I cant even touch the books youve read  
Every time I crawl past your door I been wishin I was somebody else instead  
Down the highway down the tracks down the road to ecstasy  
I followed you beneath the stars hounded by your memory  
And all your ragin glory  
  
I been doublecrossed now for the very last time and now Im finally free  
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from
me  
Youll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above  
And Ill never know the same about you your holiness or your kind of love  
And it makes me feel so sorry  
  
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats  
Blowing through the letters that we wrote  
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves  
Were idiots babe  
Its a wonder we can even feed ourselves
