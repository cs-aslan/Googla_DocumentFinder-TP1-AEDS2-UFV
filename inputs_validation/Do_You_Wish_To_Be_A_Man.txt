Oh didnt you like to do  
An uneasy thing to do   
Are you troubled by the bad things in your life  
If youre worrying bout a verse  
And you cant get it off your chest  
Just lie down and try to ease your mind  
If your mother comes round the bend  
Come to give you a helping hand  
Do you wish to go and bury your head in the sand  
Oh do you wish to be a man  
Do you wish to be a man  
Do you wish to be the one to understand  
Oh do you wish to be a man  
Do you wish to be a man  
Oh do you wish to be a man  
Well the misery is yours  
If you hide behind that door  
If you hide behind the troubles in your life  
You havent got a friend  
And theres no one to take you in  
Will you come in stretch and stand up on your own  
When you know that your time has come  
And therell be no place to run  
There will be no time to bury your head in the sand  
So do you wish to be a man  
Do you wish to be a man  
Do you wish to be the one to understand  
Oh do you wish to be a man  
Do you wish to be a man  
Oh do you wish to be a man  
Do you wish to be a man  
Do you wish to be a man  
Oh do you wish to be a man
