She was fortyone and her daddy still called her baby  
Everyone in Brownsville thinks shes crazy  
cause she walks to the station with a suitcase in her hand  
And shes looking for a mysterious darkhaired man  
  
In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn  
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on  
But a man of low degree stood by her side  
And he promised he would take her for his bride  
  
Delta Dawn whats that flower you have on  
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by  
Did I hear you say he was meeting you here today  
To take you to his mansion in the sky  
  
Delta Dawn whats that flower you got on

Did I hear you say he was meeting you here today  
To take you to his mansion in the sky
