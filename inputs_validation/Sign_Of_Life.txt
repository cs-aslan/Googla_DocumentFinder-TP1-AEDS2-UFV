What did I just say  
Well I I cant remember  
The room is spinning and  
My heart is skipping beats  
Cause I finally cut all the ties  
That were hanging on me  
  
Its a sign of life  
To be so confused  
You jump and it feels  
Like youre falling  
  
Chorus  
You find the hope the  
strength the heart  
And just when you think  
theres nothing left  
Cause when it feels just like  
youre drowning  
Thats when you fight for  
every breath  
You find the faith the will  
the words  
To break through the silence  
and the pain  
Cause when it feels just like  
youre dyin  
Thats a sign of life  
  
Sooner or later  
You come to the point  
Where you have to choose  
Who and what you want to be  
And I made a decision  
Not so long ago  
To be happy  
  
Its a sign of life  
To be unafraid  
You jump and it feels  
Like youre flying  
  
Chorus  
  
Break down  
Shattered  
My reflection is scattered  
Like ashes in the wind  
Ill begin again  
  
Chorus
