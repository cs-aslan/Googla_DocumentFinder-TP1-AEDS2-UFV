Give me  
Your dirty love  
Like you might surrender  
To some dragon in your dreams  
Give me  
Your dirty love  
Like a pink donation  
To the dragon in your dreams  
  
I dont need your sweet devotion  
I dont want your cheap emotion  
Just whip me up some dragon lotion  
For your dirty love  
  
Give me  
Your dirty love  
Like some tacky little pamphlet  
In your daddys bottom drawer  
Give me  
Your dirty love  
I dont believe youve never seen  
His book before  
  
I dont need no consolation  
I dont want your reservation  
I only got one destination  
An thats your dirty love  
  
Give me  
Your dirty love  
Just like your mama  
Make her fuzzy poodle do  
Give me  
Your dirty love  
The way your mama  
Make that nasty poodle chew  
  
Ill ignore your cheap aroma  
And your littlebopeep diploma  
Ill just put you in a coma  
With some dirty love  
  
THE POODLE BITES  
Come on Frenchie  
THE POODLE CHEWS IT  
Snap it  
THE POODLE BITES  
Come on Frenchie  
THE POODLE CHEWS IT  
Snap it
