Which one of you has got to be so sad for  
And whatd ya look ashamed about  
Always on downerthat just sounds like you  
And your waiting for some things to jump out of that tree  
  
Havent got a clue about the next bit Im so green  
Ive got to be seen to believe  
I had to ask mister fix it  
Everybody on this stagecoach likes robbin an bashin  
  
Big blacks and blonds smokin miles and miles of hash  
Thats sweet  
The bigger the tree the better the time  
Yeah I can see now how your looking for someone still  
  
A lot more funkiera lot more oh  
Well thats the way it seems is what the way you are  
Dont know this bit and a roof drops in  
  
And said hello goodbyes and a few months later your mine  
At this rate even sooner  
Still a lot more funkier still a lot more you
