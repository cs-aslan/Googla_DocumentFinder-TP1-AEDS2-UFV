Id rather play noughts and crosses with you  
Than go to the pictures or the zoo  
Im very daft at dancing at moonlight or romancing  
Id rather play noughts and crosses with you  
  
Ive never been one for billiards or darts  
Im much too shy to play a game of hearts  
At dog tracks or the races I always lose my braces  
Id rather play noughts and crosses with you  
  
Here I am a funny sort of guy I wouldnt dare to hold your hand  
Lets begin maybe Ill let you win I hope that you understand  
Sitting around a table for two thats the only thing I want to do  
Theres something cute about you I couldnt do without you  
  
Playing a simple game tell me you feel the same  
Id rather play noughts and crosses with you  
  
Id rather play noughts and crosses with you  
Than take you to a French nonstop revue  
It may not be so funny but still it saves me money  
Id rather play noughts and crosses with you  
  
I havent the manly figure for sports  
I never think I look my best in shorts  
I lose my breath at biking and as for that mixed hiking  
Id rather play noughts and crosses with you  
  
One fine day if luck should come my way well have a little kitchenette  
You and me and when weve had our tea I hope that you wont forget  
  
Playing at noughts and crosses with you  
Thats the only way that I can woo  
Though now youre far above me in time youll learn to love me  
Isnt it bold and bad  but I feel a lad  
Playing at noughts and crosses with you
