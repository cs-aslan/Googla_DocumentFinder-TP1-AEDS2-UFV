We used to get crazy evry Saturday night  
Wed drive into town and get feelin right  
A child of the sixties in seventy four  
But Im not that way anymore  
  
Well I burned the tires off my chevrolet  
Tryin to impress the girls that I date  
And Id bet a gambler when I couldnt score  
But Im not that way anymore  
  
Chorus  
Im not that way anymore  
Times closin yesterdays door  
But Im just as happy as I was before  
Cause Im not that way anymore  
  
American bandstand the sullivan show  
I listened to the opry on my radeeIo  
Well dick clarks still lookin as young as before  
But Im not that way anymore  
  
Well I swapped my loafers for cowboy boots  
Bought me some jeans gave away all my suits  
My razor is rusted my barber is poor  
Cause Im not that way anymore  
  
Im not that way anymore  
Were not that way anymore
