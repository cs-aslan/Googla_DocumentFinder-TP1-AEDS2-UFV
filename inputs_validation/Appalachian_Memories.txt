Dolly Parton  
You oughta go north somebody told us  
Cause the air is filled with gold dust  
And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands  
Now I dont recall you said it  
But wed lived so long on credit  
And so we headed out to find our promised land  
Just poor Appalachian farm folk  
With nothing more than high hopes  
We hitched our station wagon to a star  
But our dreams all fell in on us  
Cause there was no land of promise  
And its a stuggle keepin sight of who you are  
Oh and these northern nights are dreary  
And my southern heart is weary  
I wonder how the old folks are back home  
But Ill keep leanin on sweet Jesus  
I know Hell love and guide and lead us  
Appalachian memories keep me strong  
Ya know Ive been thinkin a whole lot lately  
About whats been and what awaits me  
It takes all Ive got to give what life demands  
You go insane if you give in to it  
Lifes a mill and Ive been through it  
Im just thankful Im creative with my hands  
Oh and these northern nights are dreary  
And my southern eyes are teary  
Dont I wonder how the old folks are back home  
But Ill keep leanin on my Jesus  
I know hell love and guide and lead us  
Appalachian memories keep me strong  
Ill keep lookin to the Father  
Keep our heads above the water  
Appalachian memories keep me strong
