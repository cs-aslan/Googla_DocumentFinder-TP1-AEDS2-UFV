Standing here on sacred ground  
Some days its a mad world let it be  
Words of promise fill the air empty voices  
How long have we waited  
  
And every time I hold your hand  
You bring to me this promised land  
I live for you this promised land  
  
Take me there and back again  
Some days its a sad world let it be  
Whats the point of looking for this power divine  
Its already in my changes  
And every time I hear your voice  
I realize I have a choice  
To live again  
I deserve this choice  
To live again  
  
Our heaven will be now  
You are the song from the book of time  
To realize what is yours is mine  
We are meant to be  
All because our love has always been  
You are the center of my day  
You are my guide in every way  
We were meant to be  
All because our love has always been there  
Giving me the light yes its been there giving me the light  
Second nature sings to me  
Some days its a dark world let it be  
I define my right to be  
I cant follow those whove lost their vision  
And every time I hold your hand  
You redesign my promised land  
I live for you this promised land  
I live for you  
  
You are the song from the book of time  
To realize what is yours is mine  
We are meant to be  
All because our love has always been  
You are the center of my day  
You are my guide in every way  
We were meant to be  
All because our love has always been there  
Giving me the light giving me the light  
Yes its been there giving me the light  
  
You are the song from the book of time  
To realize what is yours is mine  
We are meant to be  
All because our love has always been  
You are the center of my day  
You are my guide in every way  
We were meant to be  
All because our love has always been there  
Giving me the light yes its been there giving me the light  
  
Give love each day  
Give love each day
