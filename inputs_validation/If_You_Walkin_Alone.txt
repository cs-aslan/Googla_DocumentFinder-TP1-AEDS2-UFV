When youre walking alone  
Cant fight the crowd  
And youre pushing the world behind you  
Hold dont lose yourself in a crowded place  
Or I doubt it if Ill find you  
When you have found things were getting you down  
Dont try to run away  
Just wait for me  
And baby youll see  
Well make it through the day  
When youre walking alone  
Cant fight the heat  
And the people you meet arent kind  
You just put your head out  
And take a step  
And theres no mountain we cant climb  
Oh when you have cried and the things on your mind  
Just seem to make you sad  
Forget everything  
Please come with me  
Well laugh and well be glad  
When you have found things were getting you down  
Dont try to run away  
Just wait for me and baby youll see  
Well make it through the day  
Through the day  
When youre walking alone  
Cant fight the crowd  
And youre pushing the world behind you  
Hold dont lose yourself in a crowded place  
So I doubt it if Ill find you  
When you have cried and the things on your mind  
Just seem to make you sad  
Forget everything please come with me  
Well laugh and well be glad  
Please come  
Please come  
Please come  
Yeah
