Alarm clock dingdong pants up boots on  
Coffee cigarette bluecollar breakfast  
Hard hat fork lift dragging through a swing shift  
Stacking up the boxes watching that clock  
Tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock  
Working for the man sure makes a man thirsty  
Need a little neon get a little drink on  
Friday cant come fast enough yall  
  
Nana nanana na  
Nana nanana na  
Let the good times roll when the guitars play  
Heres to another week gone  
Raise em up and sing along  
Friday cant come fast enough  
  
Babys on the cell phone calling from a tanning bed  
Hit the mall got a dress nails done hair did  
Running through my money like a water through a faucet  
Well so dry you can here those dollars  
Drip drop drip drop drip drop drip drop  
Payin them bills sure make a man thirsty  
Need a little neon time to get a drink on  
Friday cant come fast enough  
  
Nana nanana na  
Nana nanana na  
Let the good times roll when the guitars play  
Heres to another week gone  
Raise em up and sing along  
Friday cant come fast enough  
  
Nana nanana na  
Nana nanana na  
Nana nanana na  
  
We need a little neon  
Time to get your drink on  
Friday cant come fast enough  
Heres to another week gone  
Raise em up and sing along  
Friday cant come fast enough  
Yeah friday cant come fast enough
