On a Greyhound thirty miles beyond Jamestown  
He saw the sun set on the Tennessee line  
He looked at the young man who was riding beside him  
He said Im old kind of worn out inside  
I worked my whole life in the steel mills of Gary  
And my father before me I helped build this land  
Now Im seventyseven and with God as my witness  
I earned every dollar that passed through my hands  
My family and friends are the best thing Ive known  
Through the eye of the needle Ill carry them home  
  
Days turn to minutes  
And minutes to memories  
Life sweeps away the dreams  
That we have planned  
You are young and you are the future  
So suck it up and tough it out  
And be the best you can  
  
The rain hit the old dog in the twilights last gleaming  
He said son it sounds like rattling old bones  
This highway is long but I know some that are longer  
By sunup tomorrow I guess Ill be home  
Through the hills of Kentucky cross the Ohio river  
The old man kept talking bout his life and his times  
He fell asleep with his head against the window  
He said an honest mans pillow is his peace of mind  
This world offers riches and riches will grow wings  
I dont take stock in those uncertain things  
  
Days turn to minutes  
And minutes to memories  
Life sweeps away the dreams  
That we have planned  
You are young and you are the future  
So suck it up and tough it out  
And be the best you can  
  
The old man had a vision but it was hard for me to follow  
I do things my way and I pay a high price  
When I think back on the old man and the bus ride  
Now that Im older I can see he was right  
  
Another hot one out on highway eleven  
This is my life Its what Ive chosen to do  
There are no free rides no one said itd be easy  
The old man told me this my son Im telling it to you  
  
Days turn to minutes  
And minutes to memories  
Life sweeps away the dreams  
That we have planned  
You are young and you are the future  
So suck it up and tough it out  
And be the best you can
