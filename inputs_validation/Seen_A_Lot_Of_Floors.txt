Seen a lot of walls seen a lot of halls  
Got a lot of calls late at night  
Seen a lot of doors seen a lot of floors  
Done a lot of chores late at night  
So dont come in here walkin  
So innocent and talkin  
Tryin to make conversation  
Cause I know and you know  
That I know what youre here for  
Dont tell me bout your father  
Your sister or your mother  
Your great big brother  
Not tonight  
Dont want to hear about your hang ups  
Dont want know your favorite movies  
Dont want to hear about other rock bands  
Not tonight  
So dont come in here walkin  
So innocent and talkin  
Tryin to make conversation  
Cause you know and I know  
That I know what youre here for  
Seen a lot of floors  
Seen a lot of doors  
Done a lot of chores  
Late at night
