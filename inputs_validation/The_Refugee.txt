Woah woah  
Shes the refugee  
I see your face  
I see you staring back at me  
Woah woah  
Shes the refugee  
Her mama say one day shes gonna  
Live in America  
  
In the morning  
She is waiting  
Waiting for the ship to sail  
Sail away  
  
Woah woah  
Her papa go to war  
He gonna fight  
But he dont know what for  
Woah woah  
Her papa go to war  
Her mama say one day hes gonna  
Come back from far away  
  
Help me  
How can you help me  
  
In the evening  
She is waiting  
Waiting for her man to come  
And take her by her hand  
And take her to this promise land  
  
Woah woah  
Shes a pretty face  
But at the wrong time  
In the wrong place  
Woah woah  
Shes a pretty face  
Her mama say one day shes gonna  
Live in America  
Yeah America  
  
Woah woah  
Shes a refugee  
Shes coming back shes coming  
Keep you company  
Woah woah  
Shes a refugee  
Her mama say one day shes gonna  
Live in America
