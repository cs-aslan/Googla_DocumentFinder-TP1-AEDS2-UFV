The city is quiet too cold to walk alone  
Strangers in overcoats hurry on home  
Tonight Ive been walking in the rain  
Someones been talking and Ive got the blame  
  
Chained framed you know what I mean  
Push me in a corner and Ill scream  
Just give me one more one more chance  
One more one more chance  
  
I will find out wherever you are  
Drinking in another club or driving in your car  
Walking through empty streets  
Stupid fool that was yours for keeps  
  
Chained framed you know what I mean  
Push me in a corner and Ill scream  
One more one more chance  
Give me one more one more chance  
Give me one more one more chance  
Give me one more chance one more chance tonight

Youre so extreme  
I want to take you home with me  
Come on tell me one more time  
I dont mind baby I dont mind  
I dont mind  
  
Just give me one more   
  
Push me in the corner and Ill scream   
  
One more one more chance  
Give me one more one more chance  
Give me one more one more chance  
Give me one more chance one more chance  
Just give me one more  
One more  
One more one more chance  
Give me one more chance one more chance to  
  
I dont mind
