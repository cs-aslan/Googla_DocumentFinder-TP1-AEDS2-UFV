Dolly Parton  
Its all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from letting it show  
Yeah its all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from telling you so  
I wasnt looking for love when I found you  
Just someone to be with and have a good time  
But I get these strange funny feelings around you  
When youre not with me youre still on my mind  
And its all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from letting it show  
Yeah its all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from telling you so  
I had intended to wait for a long time  
I thought that love would just mess up my plans  
Cause I had big plans for a bright shining future  
Could this be my future thats holding my hand  
And its all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from letting it show  
Yeah its all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from telling you so  
I need to tell you how I feel about you  
But Im so afraid that you dont feel the same  
But if I dont tell you how I feel about you  
I just might lose you can I take that chance  
And its all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from letting it show  
Yeah its all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from telling you so
