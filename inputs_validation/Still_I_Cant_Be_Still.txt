Well I dont believe in god  
But she talks to me all the time  
And I banish my mother  
But she holds me when I cry  
And I have been unfaithful for  
With me hell spend the rest of his life  
  
Yet I have been forgiven  
By all whom Ive betrayed and loved  
And I have everything I want  
Is it ever enough  
  
Chorus Still I cant be still  
Still I cant be silent  
Still I cant be still  
Still I cant be saved  
Still I cant be still  
I cant be silent  
Still I  
Still  
  
Well I dont believe Im beautiful but  
At least I have my sisters smile  
And I resist the muses but  
They sing to me in exile  
And destiny is not deafening  
But it hushed me like a child  
And every time I feel as though  
Im closer to the eye  
The storm winds blow  
I run inside and though I feel revived  
  
Chorus  
  
The insatiable peace  
Of my quest for for true serenity  
No matter how hard the rain  
The thirst the thirst is never ending  
No matter how many friends  
For angels been sent down to take me away  
They cant make it okay  
  
And every time I feel as though Im  
Closer to the eye  
The storm winds blow  
I run inside and though I feel revived  
Yes every time I feel as though Im  
Closer to the eye  
The storm winds blow  
I run inside and though I feel revived  
I dont believe Im beautiful  
But least Ive got my sisters smile  
And I resist the muses but  
They sing to me  
Still  
Destiny is deafening
