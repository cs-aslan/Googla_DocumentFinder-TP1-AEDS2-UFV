Dont need your love  
On a silver platter  
Lets get down tot he nitty grit  
Lets cut out all the chatter  
Get to the ehart of the matter  
Honey lets get down to it  
  
Lets get down to some huggin and some squeezin  
Arm and arm  
Wed be a perfect fit  
So put a freeze on the teasin  
Lets get on with the pleasin  
Honey lets get down to it  
  
I know that you want to  
I can see it when I look into those bug green eyes  
Baby lets come to grits  
Dont play so hard to get  
Honey lets get down to it  
  
I get a chill every time your near me  
Youve got my heart doin flips  
I only aim to please  
If youd let go youd see  
Honey lets get down to it  
  
I know that you want to  
I can see it when I look into those bug green eyes  
Baby lets come to grits  
Dont play so hard to get  
Honey lets get down to it  
  
Honey lets get down to it
