Your everlasting summer  
You can see it fading fast  
So you grab a piece of something  
That you think is gonna last  
You wouldnt know a diamond  
If you held it in your hand  
The things you think are precious  
I cant understand  
  
Chorus  
Are you reelin in the years  
Stowin away the time  
Are you gatherin up the tears  
Have you had enough of mine  
  
You been tellin me youre a genius  
Since you were seventeen  
In all the time Ive known you  
I still dont know what you mean  
The weekend at the college  
Didnt turn out like you planned  
The things that pass for knowledge  
I cant understand  
  
Chorus  
  
I spend a lot of money  
And I spent a lot of time  
The trip we made in hollywood  
Is etched upon my mind  
After all the things weve done and seen  
You find another man  
The things you think are useless  
I cant understand  
  
Chorus
