Im going home  
There I am there in my bedroom  
Im safe and Im snug and snoring  
And so glad to be there  
  
Im going home  
None of this ever happened  
But God I really did it  
Still nothing has changed  
  
Chorus  
Im going home  
Im going home  
To my own room  
To all the mess  
To all the dirty laundry  
It looks so good I dont care  
Im just so glad to be home sweet home  
  
Wonder if anyone missed me  
Or have I been gone so far  
They thought that I died  
How many said  
I wonder what happened to Alice  
How many shrugged or laughed  
How many cried  
But I dont give a damn  
  
Chorus  
  
Im going home  
Nothing can stop me now  
repeat
