My head wont leave me crying  
And I lay this one  
She wont give me happy  
As I lie here alone  
My own will give you baby  
  
Call again  
Let me be the number  
You lead me away again  
It was anything I need to  
Find my way through this sand   
My baby lead my head away  
And calling by my head  
  
Boy  
When you away we go  
Sending me crawling back over  
And crawl back to say  
  
My head my head wont rely  
On the troubles today  
And my leave my head in worry  
Like the summer rolls  
My own wont leave me happy  
Dont make me give it back  
And on we will go  
  
And have you called me there way before  
And I leave this song with you  
Feeling colder  
Than I ever have  
She wont be my lady  
And some of you fall  
  
And I give you happy  
Fools you know  
My mind is wide and away  
And for well its gone  
And only leave me happy  
You wouldnt make me fall  
  
And when we call  
Maybe baby say  
And you call  
I dont know again  
Say too much
