The world was on fire  
No one could save me but you  
Its strange what desire  
Will make foolish people do  
I never dreamed that Id meet somebody like you  
I never dreamed that Id meet somebody like you  
  
No I dont want to fall in love  
this girl is only gonna break your heart  
And I dont want to fall in love  
this girl is only gonna break your heart  
With you  
this girl is only gonna break your heart  
  
What a wicked game to play  
To make me feel this way  
What a wicked thing to do  
To let me dream of you  
What a wicked thing to say  
You never felt this way  
What a wicked thing to do  
To make me dream of you  
  
And I dont want to fall in love  
this girl is only gonna break your heart  
No I dont want to fall in love  
this girl is only gonna break your heart  
With you  
  
The world was on fire  
No one could save me but you  
Its strange what desire  
Will make foolish people do  
No I never dreamed that Id love somebody like you  
And I never dreamed  
That Id lose somebody like you  
  
No I dont want to fall in love  
this girl is only gonna break your heart  
No I dont want to fall in love  
this girl is only gonna break your heart  
With you  
this girl is only gonna break your heart  
  
No I this girl is only gonna break your heart  
this girl is only gonna break your heart  
Nobody loves no one
