Scott became famous for freezing to death in Antartica  
Columbus made history thinking some island was India  
General Custers a national hero for not knowing when to run  
All these men are famous and theyre also very dumb  
  
History is made by stupid people  
Clever people wouldnt even try  
If you wanna place in the history books  
Then do something dumb before you die  
  
Nobility are famous for no reason  
Marie Antoinette enjoyed her cake  
She cause a Revolution when she would not share  
And her husband lost his head for that mistake  
  
The Hindenberg was a giant zeppelin  
Her makers made a minor oversight  
Before they filled it up with explosive gas  
They should have fixed the no smoking light  
  
Cause  
History is made by stupid people  
Clever people wouldnt even try  
If you wanna place in the history books  
Then do something dumb before you die  
  
TallyHo TallyHo  
Our king and countrys honor we will save  
TallyHo TallyHo  
Were marching into history and the grave  
  
So if your son or daughter seem too lazy  
Sitting there watching mad T V  
Just remember you should be quite grateful  
At least theyre not making history  
  
Ahhh  
History is made by stupid people  
Clever people wouldnt even try  
If you wanna place in the history books  
Then do something dumb before you die  
Do something dumb before you die  
Do something dumb before you die
