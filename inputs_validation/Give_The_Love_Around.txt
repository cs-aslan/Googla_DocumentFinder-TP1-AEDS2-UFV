To your brother to your sister to your misses to your mister  
To your friends to your foes give the love around and back around it goes  
It all comes from the top and it spreads right round  
Treat a man wrong hes gonna pass it on down  
To the next in line whos probably his wife bringing up his kids  
Now watchin mamma cry  
And they pick it up cause they learn everything  
Life has a funny way of going in a ring  
End up growing up in trouble with the law  
Standing in the cuffs that the father once wore  
Now it seems that every brand new generation  
Have all been growing up with cracks in the foundation  
Their trying to fill the holes of a whole damn nation  
Thats lost its trust thats lost its trust  
We gotta change before the train leaves the station  
And realize the revolution aint a revelation it takes bloodsweat tears
innovation  
It starts with us it starts with us  
  
Chorus  
Yeah it starts by giving love to your brother  
Giving love to your sister  
Giving love to your misses  
Love to your mister  
Giving love to your friends  
Love to your foes  
Give the love around and back around it goes  
Give the love around and back around it goes  
Round it goes round it goes  
Round it goes goes goes  
  
Give the love around and back around it goes  
Oh were all just folks working in a wheel  
Spinning all around lifes cruel battlefield  
Draw circles in the sand on a rainy day  
Watch it wash away  
I bet it shows up on a sunny beach a thousand miles away  
Flutter from a butterfly forms a storm  
Over half a million people die  
Oh we dont care because were all desensitized  
We dont realize were putting all this shit before our childrens eyes  
Now every brand new generation  
Have all been growing up with cracks in their foundation  
Were tryna fill a holes of a whole damn nation  
Thats lost its trust that lost its trust  
We gotta change before the train leaves the station  
And realize the revolution aint a revelation  
It takes blood sweat tears innovation  
It starts with us it starts with us  
  
Chorus  
  
Give the love around and back around it goes around it goes  
Give the love around and back around it goes around it goes  
Love to your friends around it goes  
To your foes around it goes  
Give the love around back around it goes  
See the thing about Karma is she loves a bit of drama yeah  
Loves to hunt you down and pay ya back for the things you did  
Before you turn a positive to a negative  
Better pray before you know exactly who the fuck youre dealing with  
This is not a dress rehearsal let me tell you kid  
Whatever you put out there is coming back again  
Years may burn ohh  
Tables gonna turn  
Karmas coming back around  
Either way youre gonna learn  
To give love to your neighbor love to yourself  
It dont matter bout your status  
Man your health is your wealth  
We can all point a finger but theres four pointing back at yourself  
Ill be the bigger man now  
Give a little help  
  
Chorus  
  
Give the love around back around it goes  
Around it goes x2  
Give the love around back around it goes  
Around it goes x4  
Give the love around back around it goes
