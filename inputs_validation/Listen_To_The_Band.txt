Hey hey mercy woman plays a song and no one listens  
I need help Im falling again  
  
Play the drum a little louder  
Tell me I can live without her  
If I only listen to the band  
  
Listen to the band  
Werent they good they made me happy  
I think I can make it alone  
  
Oh mercy woman plays a song and no one listens  
I need help Im falling again  
  
Play the drum a little bit louder  
Tell them they can live without her  
If they only listen to the band  
  
Listen to the band  
Now werent they good they made me happy  
I think I can make it alone  
  
Oh woman plays a song and no one listens  
I need help Im falling again  
  
Cmon play the drums just a little bit louder  
Tell us we can live without her  
Now that we have listened to the band  
  
Listen to the band
