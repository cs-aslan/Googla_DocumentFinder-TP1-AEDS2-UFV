The leaves were falling  
I was seventeen  
Wed been locking lips  
Grabbing hips  
Smoking cigarettes  
We took a drive in your 1990  
Had me down from out of town  
I was California  
Oh my legs were not shaved  
And you had dirt between your fingers  
They told us to behave  
But hey  
  
Its not like riding a bike  
Its not like flying a kite  
Its not as easy as pie  
Theres nothing like the first time  
Its not like taking a bath  
Its not like having a laugh  
Its not like reading a map  
Theres nothing like the first time  
  
I had seen it in the  
Magazines  
We would  
Change the chanel  
On the tv screen  
Cuz its such a sin  
What ya did to me  
Straight to hell its what they sell  
If youve done the deed  
Oh but what could be so bad  
Oh if everyone is guilty  
I guess we want what we cant have  
Cause Ive heard  
  
Its not like riding a bike  
Its not like flying a kite its not as easy as pie  
Theres nothing like the first time  
Its not like taking a bath  
Its not like having a laugh  
Its not like reading a map  
Theres nothing like the first time  
  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
  
La la la la la la  
Theres nothing like the first time  
La la la la la la  
Theres nothing like the first time  
  
Its not a walk in the park  
Its not a shot in the dark  
Its not a juvenile crime  
Theres nothing like the first time  
Its not like tying the knot  
Theres no connecting the dots  
And in case you forgot  
Theres nothing like the first time  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Theres nothing like the first time  
Oh oh ohhh  
Theres nothing like the first time  
Hey ey ey  
Theres nothing like the first time  
  
Its not like reading a map  
Oh I can give you that  
Theres nothing like the first time
