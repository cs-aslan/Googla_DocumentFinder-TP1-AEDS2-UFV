Ride it on baby  
Into my view  
Ride it on baby  
Into your side  
Ride it on baby  
Just like you used to do  
Did you want me to love you well  
Im just here for the call  
And you said that youre so low well  
I wont really do you any harm  
Wont you ride it on baby  
Just like you used to do  
Theres no love that youre over feeling  
And you still want to be with me  
But youre leaving like you said that you would  
Im waiting for the call  
And you love like you always say now  
But you know it wont do you any harm  
Ride it on baby  
Just like you said that you would  
Oh then ride it on baby  
Just like you know its understood  
Ride it on baby  
Its still into your view  
Ride it on baby  
I only want to be with you  
Im dreaming that youre going far  
And you lie take and whine  
Wont you ride it on baby  
But youre so heavy for the price  
Ride it on baby  
Just like you said that you would
