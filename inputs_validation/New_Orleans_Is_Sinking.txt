Bourbon blues on the street loose and complete  
Under skies all smoky bluegreen  
I cant forsake a Dixie deadshake  
So we danced the sidewalk clean  
My memory is muddy whats this river that Im in  
New Orleans is sinking man and I dont wanna swim  
  
Colonel Tom whats wrong Whats going on  
Cant tie yourself up for a deal  
He said hey north youre south shut your big mouth  
You gotta do what you feel is real  
Aint got no picture postcards aint got no souvenirs  
My baby she dont know me when Im thinking bout those years  
  
Pale as a light bulb hanging on a wire  
Sucking up to someone just to stoke the fire  
Picking out the highlights of the scenery  
Saw a little cloud that looked a little like me  
  
I have my hands in the river  
My feet back up on the banks  
Looked up to the Lord above  
And said hey man thanks  
Sometimes I feel so good I gotta scream  
She said Gordie baby I know exactly what you mean  
She said she said I swear to God she said  
  
My memory is muddy whats this river that Im in  
New Orleans is sinking man and I dont wanna swim  
Swim
