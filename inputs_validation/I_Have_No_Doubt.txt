Sometimes I dont know where Im going  
Where the road is leading me  
Life can be full of so many changes  
So Many uncertainties  
  
But theres one thing thats constant in this heart of mine  
Its knowing that Your gonna love me rain or shine  
  
Chorus  
I have no doubt  
That You will never leave me  
That Youll be there to keep me safe and warm  
I have no doubt  
No matter where You take me  
That nothing can separate me from You Lord  
  
I dont know what Youve planned for tomorrow  
Or what lies up ahead for me  
Pleasure pain worry or sorrow  
Today is as far as I can see  
You may see fit to take me through the valey Lord  
Or on the mountain  
It makes no difference where I go  
  
Chorus  
  
I want to run away  
From the voice that I hear calling  
But Ill be quick to answer and obey  
  
Chorus  
  
Nothing could ever separate me  
Nothing could ever separate me
