Well Im gone to  
Way down on Last Breath Farm  
Ive been rakin leaves with Liza  
Me and Liz clean up the yard  
  
Left my home in Music City  
In the back of a limosine  
Now Im doin my own laundry  
And Im gettin those clothes clean  
  
Growin fond of  
And this quiet life I lead  
But Im just dying to tell my story  
For all my friends to read  
  
Well its tough to be somebody  
And its hard to keep from fallin apart  
Up here on Rehab Mountain  
We gonna learn these things by heart  
  
Well Im gone to  
Way down on Last Breath Farm  
Ive been rakin leaves with Liza  
Me and Liz clean up the yard  
  
What goes on in  
Outside the rubber room  
We get therapy and lectures  
We play golf in the afternoon  
  
Well its tough to be somebody  
And its hard not to fall apart  
Up here on Rehab Mountain  
We gonna learn these things by heart
