Woke up this morning not feeling too well  
The man in my mirror looking mighty pale  
On this old CB calling for emergency  
But all of a sudden its dawning on me  
  
I dont need no doctor  
To tell me whats wrong  
Ive known my problem  
Ive been gone too long way too long  
  
Homesick fever running through my vein  
Lonely feeling love hungry pain  
You can say your daddy coming down with the blues  
Got this homesick fever mama missing you  
  
That old evening sun its going down on my right  
Baby Im southbound coming home tonight  
Im in the mountain mama headed up the hill  
The closer I get to you the better I feel  
  
thats just one gift mama  
She dont get my mind  
One once of your love honey  
And Ill be feeling fine so fine  
  
Homesick fever running through my vein  
Lonely feeling love hungry pain  
You can say your daddy coming down with the blues  
Got this homesick fever mama missing you  
  
Homesick fever lonely feelin  
  
Yes you can say your daddy coming down with the blues  
Homesick fever mama missing you
