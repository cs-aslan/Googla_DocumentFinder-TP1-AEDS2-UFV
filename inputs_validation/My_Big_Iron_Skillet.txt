You are doing wrong again its plain for all to see  
And you think here at home is where I ought to be  
Theres gonna be some changes made when you get in tonight  
Cause Im gonna teach you wrong from right  
With my big iron skillet in my hand  
Gonna show you how a little woman quits a great big man  
If you live through the fight were gonna have when you get home  
Youll wake up and find yourself alone  
 steel   
You say youre sick and tired of me and that I look a mess  
But its never done on you this is my only dress  
I have never met a man whos quite the likes of you  
I dont know why I ever said I do  
With my big iron skillet  
With my big iron skillet
