I was just a little girl  
Skinny legs a press and curl  
My mother always thought Id be a star  
But way before my record deal  
The streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill  
Made sure that Id never go too far  
Every ghetto every city and suburban place Ive been  
Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem  
Story starts at Hootaville grew up next to Ivy Hill  
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun  
Kill the guy in Carter park  
Rode a Mongoose til its dark  
Watching kids show off the stolen ones  
Every ghetto every city and suburban place Ive been  
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem  
  
You know its hot dont forget what youve got  
Looking back  
Looking back looking back looking back  
You know its hot dont forget what youve got  
Looking back  
Thinking back thinking back thinking back  
  
A bag of Bontons twenty cents and a nickel  
Springfield Ave had the best popsicles  
Saturday morning cartoons and KungFu  
Main street roots tonic with the dreds  
A beef patty and some coco bread  
Move the patch from my Lees to the tongue of my shoe  
Member FrelngHuysen used to have the bomb leather  
Back when Doug Fresh and Slick Rick were together  
Looking at the crew we thought wed all live forever  
  
You know its hot dont forget what youve got  
Looking back  
Thinking back thinking back thinking back  
You know its hot dont forget what youve got  
Looking back  
Thinking back thinking back thinking back  
  
Drill teams on Munn street  
Remember when Hawthorne and Chancellor had beef  
Moving Records was on Central Ave  
I was there at dancing school  
South Orange Ave at Borlin pool  
Unaware of what we didnt have  
Writing your friends names on your jeans with a marker  
  
July 4th races off of Parker  
Fireworks at Martin stadium  
The Untouchable PSP where all them crazy niggers be  
And car thieves got away through Irvington  
Hillside brings beef with the cops  
SelfDestruction record drops  
And everybodys name was Muslim  
Sensations and 88 attracted kids from outofstate  
And everybody used to do the wop  
Jack Jack Jack ya body  
Nah the Biz Mark used to amp up the party  
I wish those days they didnt stop  
Every ghetto every city and suburban place Ive been  
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem  
  
You know its hot dont forget what youve got  
Looking back  
Welcome back welcome back welcome back  
You know its hot dont forget what youve got  
Looking back  
Thinking back thinking back thinking back  
  
Thinking back thinking back thinking back
