Happiness comes with success  
And that I guess is true  
But success is more or less  
A point of view  
  
Im no millionaire  
But Im not the type to care  
Cause Ive got a pocketful of dreams  
Its my universe  
Even with an empty purse  
Cause Ive got a pocketful of dreams  
  
I wouldnt take the wealth of Wall Street  
For a road where nature trods  
And I calculate that Im worth my weight  
In goldenrods  
  
Lucky lucky me  
I can live in luxury  
Cause Ive got a pocketful of dreams
