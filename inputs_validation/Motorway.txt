Motorway food is the worst in the world  
Youve never eaten food like youve eaten on the motorway  
Motorway food is the worst in the world  
The coffee tastes weak and the cakes taste stale  
And gasoline fumes are the worst to inhale  
Your stomach rolls over and your face turns pale  
  
Oh that motorway livin  
Aint it a thrill to be so free yeh  
Riding down the motorway  
Got to charge up my batteries  
Rest my seat rest my eyes  
  
So tired tired of livin tired of livin this motorway livin  
  
Motorway tea is warm and wet  
The rain is a pouring and its four in the morning  
And its all I can get  
Youve never seen loos like motorway loos  
Thousands of people passing through  
Its enough to put you off of your motorway food  
  
Oh that motorway living  
Aint it a thrill to be so free yeh  
Got to get away from  
Cats eyes cold meat pies  
Thousand on raft cold French fries  
So tired tired of livin tired of livin this motorway livin  
  
Motorway food is invariably fried  
It keeps me and feeds me and helps me survive  
Oh that motorway aint it a thrill to be so free yeh  
Riding down the motorway cats eyes cold meat pies  
Thousand on raft cold French fries  
So tired tired of livin tired of livin this motorway livin  
  
Motorway food is the worst in the world  
Youll never eat food like youve eaten on the motorway  
Motorway food is the worst in the world  
  
My stomachs upset and I dont feel well  
Gotta get my head down stop for a while in a motorway hotel  
Mama oh mama my dear Suzi too  
This motorway message is sent just for you  
My headaches improved but my back really hurts  
I never thought Id travel so far to work
