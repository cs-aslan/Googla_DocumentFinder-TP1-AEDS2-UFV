Joe Mccann  
Eamon ODoherty  
Come all of you fine people wherever you may be  
Ill sing of a brave Belfast man  
Who scorned Britains might though theyd shoot him on  
Sight  
And the shot down Joe Mccann  
  
In a Belfast bakery in the August of that year  
When internment was imposed throughout the land  
Six volunteers from Belfast held 60 soldiers at bay  
And their leader was Joe Mccann brave Joe Mccann  
  
He fought for the people in the markets where he lived  
In defence of the rights of man  
But the undercover crew told the soldiers what to do  
They shot Joe Mccann brave Jpe Mccann  
  
He had no gun so he started to run  
To escape them as manys the time before  
One bullet brought him down as he lay on the ground  
They shot him ten times more  
  
He fought and he died for the people of this land  
The protestant and catholic working man  
He caused the bosses fear and for this they paid him dear  
When they murdered brave Joe Mccann  
When they murdered brave Joe Mccann
