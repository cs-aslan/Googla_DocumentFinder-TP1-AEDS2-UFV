Yo what up this Wyclef with Mary J  
I serenade the girls with my accoustic guitar  
You know what Im sayin  
Yo fellas havin problems with the chicks  
I want you right now to turn the lights down low  
Pull your girl up next to you  
I want you to sing this to her  
  
If death comes for me tonight girl  
I want you to know that I love you  
And no matter how tough I wouldnt dare  
Only to you I would reveal my tears  
So tell the police I aint home tonight  
Messin around with you is gonna get me life  
But when I look into your eyes  
Youre worth that sacrafice  
If this is the kind of love that my mom used to warn me about  
Man Im in trouble  
Im in real big trouble  
If this is the kind of love that the old folks used to warn me about  
Man Im in trouble

And the bullets in my heart  
And its piercin through my soul Im losin blood yo

Somone please call 911 pick up the phone yo  
The alleged assailaint is five foot one  
And she shot me through my soul  
Feel my body gettin cold  
  
So cold  
Sometimes I feel like Im a prisoner  
I think Im trapped here for a while  
but Im always right here with you girl  
And every breath I fight to take  
Is as hard as these four walls I wanna break  
I told the cops you wasnt here tonight  
Messin around with me is gonna get you life  
Oh yeah yeah  
But everytime I look into your eyes  
Then its worth the sacrifice
