I talk to jesus  
  
Its like trying to light a match in the rain  
Trying to find a way to explain  
I came to meet the face that graced me cable tv  
Im his biggest fan like this him and me  
  
Has he gone out is he in a meeting  
I know that you cant tell me for security reasons  
  
But Mister tell me are you one of the Saints  
Hey maybe I could take a number and wait  
  
I talk to Jesus you dont believe me  
I talk to Jesus I know he hears me  
And I talk talk I talk to Jesus  
  
See Ive got a picture of us here in my wallet  
Id really like to show you  
Oh I guess I forgot it  
But Ive got this bracelet Ive got this Id  
That the people down at county gave me  
  
I know you think Im special hear it all the time  
You dont have to V I P Me Im a regular guy  
Id really like to sit and talk sometimes  
But Im taping Sally Jesse at five  
  
I talk to Jesus you dont believe me  
I talk to Jesus I know he hears me  
I talk to Jesus and Elvis Presley  
I talk to Jesus the king can save me  
I talk talk talk I talk to Jesus  
  
Have you seen the papers today  
If I could Id get down and pray  
Tell me if the shepherds on the way  
  
You know Elvis Presley talks to me  
Through my school teacher  
Jon Lennon moved in down the street  
He bought the pizzeria  
  
And aliens control our lives  
And when we speak theyre in our minds  
And Heather Locklear is my wife  
And Man aint a lucky guy  
  
I talk to Jesus you dont believe me  
I talk to Jesus I know he hears me  
I talk to Jesus and Elvis Presley  
I talk to Jesus the king can save me  
I talk talk talk I talk to Jesus
