Im not trying to talk at all  
Cause Im trying to love you crazy  
Put some more inside your cup  
And drink till you numb the pain  
I got you touchin on your body  
These girls keep touchin on their body  
They got accustomed to the life we live  
These girls born in the 90s are dangerous  
I got em thinkin that they want me  
Although they know they not the only  
I got em wanting to embrace their sins  
These girls born in the 90s are dangerous
