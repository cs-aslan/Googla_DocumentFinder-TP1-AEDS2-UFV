Yes its dark sometimes  
When the people are shoving  
Pushing you into the ground  
And you cry in the daylight  
With the sun in your eyes  
Even though you know your not alone  
  
And its all been felt before  
You stare out through your window  
And wonder if theres gonna be more  
  
It brings you down  
Its like a war  
Who pays the price  
If you want more  
  
Quiet desperation of a million lives  
Gonna make you change your ways  
We got everything we wanted  
But forgot how we got it  
Just cant paint it golden anyway  
And the strength of all youre giving  
Is gonna make the changes  
Tomorrows gonna bring a new day  
  
It brings you down  
Its like a war  
Who pays the price  
If you want more  
  
As the years go by  
Will it show on your face  
Or stay hidden behind some door  
Yeah you made your resolutions  
With the will of a priest  
But your not so sure anymore  
  
And the reasons why youre living  
Keep changing  
Every time you find a key you find more  
  
Repeats  
It brings you down  
Its like a war  
Who pays the price  
If you want more
