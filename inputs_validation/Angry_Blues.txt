I cant help it if I dont feel so good  
I cant help it if I dont feel so good  
If I had my way Id be sitting on the top of the world  
I cant help it if I dont feel so good  
  
When the anger comes in  
And theres no place for a man to hide  
When the anger comes in  
And theres no place for a man to hide  
Would he do anything in the world  
To make him feel better inside  
When the anger comes in  
And theres no place for a man to hide  
  
Gonna sit back here  
And watch this cloud roll by  
Gonna sit back here  
And watch this cloud roll by  
The next time that you see me  
I should be shining like the Fourth of July  
Gonna sit back here  
Gonna watch this cloud roll by  
  
I aint looking for details  
Wont you just give me a clue  
Oh Lord what am I gonna do  
  
I cant help it if I dont feel so good  
I cant help it if I dont feel so good  
If I had my way Id be sitting on the top of the world  
I cant help it if I dont feel so good  
Dont feel so good  
I cant help it if I dont feel so good
