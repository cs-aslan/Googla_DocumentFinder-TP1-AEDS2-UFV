Forged in fire tempered in steel  
Children of the storm  
Never kneel  
  
Tear down the walls  
Break the chain The wicked wind is howling and its screaming out my name  
Above the ring of fire the necromancer reigns  
With thunder and lightning he enforces his command  
Of evil lust and violence destruction rules the land  
Children of the storm on and on we run  
Children of the storm trying to find the sun  
  
With wrathful hearts weve scaled the fortress  
Whose summits reach the sky  
In vain we roared and were defeated  
His majesty reigns high  
  
Weeping and wailing another maiden dies  
In the wind and ice we gather to blast this demon from the sky  
  
Children of the storm on and on we run  
Children of the storm trying to find the sun  
  
Shadows fly past but the Black Knight holds fast  
And Ill trust in the strength of my song  
Over the edge went the dark flame of dread  
And its all in the strength of my hand  
  
Children of the storm on and on we run  
Children of the storm trying to find the sun  
  
Children of the storm on and on we run  
Children of the storm trying to find the sun  
  
Keep on your guard trust in the sword face  
Face the flames  
Face the flames
