Never been a girl who used to cry  
Didnt show emotions dont know why  
Didnt wanna feel the pain inside I guess  
  
But as the years keep going by  
You came along and changed my mind  
I should leave the past behind me  
I should let you find me  
Supposed to stay beside me  
You were supposed to guide me  
Through the ups and downs  
You were always gonna be around until the end  
  
I still think we could  
Cause you and me were good  
And Ill tell you why this hurts cause Im sober  
  
But I just wanna be drunk  
So I can forget about you  
And all the stupid things that love has pulled me through  
Even when Ive had too much  
I still feel your touch  
Maybe this just means that Im not drunk enough  
  
So Im gonna get myself another drink  
Whenever I start to think about you  
Cause I do what I really dont want to  
But sometimes my dreams just come through  
  
And when I get there  
To a place where I see you in a kitchen  
I stop wishing but that thing and I dont need you  
I dont really wanna see youAnd I dont want you to see me  
You would think that I was crazy  
You might think that I wanna be close to you  
But Id rather wanna drink some Whisky  
And maybe have a little sip o wine  
Cause right now its the only thing that makes me forget you are mine  
But right now I am sober  
  
But I just wanna be drunk  
So I can forget about you  
And all the stupid things that love has pulled me through  
Even when Ive had too much  
I still feel your touch  
Maybe this just means that Im not drunk enough  
  
I still think we could  
Im not drunk enough  
Cause you and me were good  
Cause Im sober  
  
But I just wanna be drunk  
So I can forget about you  
And all the stupid things that love has pulled me through  
Even when Ive had too much  
I still feel your touch  
Maybe this just means that Im not drunk enough  
  
I still think we could  
But I just wanna be drunk  
So I can forget about you  
And all the stupid things that love has pulled me through  
cause you and me were good  
Even when Ive had too much  
I still feel your touch  
Maybe this just means that Im not drunk enough
