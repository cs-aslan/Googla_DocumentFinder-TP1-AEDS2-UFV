Spend you days just walking and shopping  
Depending on how much youre luck is in  
Spend the nightlife tablehopping  
And trying to keep that bag of bones in trim  
  
I dont mind not being immortal  
Cause it aint all that as far as I can tell  
I dont mind not going to heaven  
As long as theyve got cigarettes  
As long as theyve got cigarettes in hell  
  
And by the time we start getting used to it  
The dope thats forming on the windowsill  
Now we know weve got ourselves into  
The cage that keeps the mice on the treadmill  
  
I dont mind not being immortal  
Cause it aint all that as far as I can tell  
I dont mind not going to heaven  
As long as theyve got cigarettes  
As long as theyve got cigarettes in hell  
  
I dont mind not being immortal  
Because it aint all that as far as I can tell  
I dont mind not going to heaven  
As long as theyve got cigarettes  
As long as theyve got cigarettes in hell
