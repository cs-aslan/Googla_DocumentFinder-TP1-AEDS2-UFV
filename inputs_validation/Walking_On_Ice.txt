I walk on ice  
I play with fire  
For loving you baby  
I dance on wire  
Oh I cant sleep at night  
Loving you I pay that price  
Loving you is like walking on ice  
  
Who broke you down  
Whos there to blame  
Who tore you up inside  
And left the pain  
Oh someone burned your life  
And everyday I pay that price  
Everyday Im walking on ice  
  
Time after time I wake up and find  
I want you Im calling  
Like always Im falling on ice  
Walking on ice  
  
I cant blink an eye  
Loving you I pay that price  
Loving you is like walking on ice
