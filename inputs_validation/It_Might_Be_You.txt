Time Ive been passing time watching trains go by  
All of my life  
Lying on the sand watching seabirds fly  
Wishing there could be  
Someone waiting home for me  
Somethings telling me it might be you all of my life  
  
Looking back as lovers go walking past all of my life  
Wondering how they met and what makes it last  
If I found the place would I recognize the face  
  
Somethings telling me it might be you  
Its telling me it might be you  
So many quiet walks to take  
So many dreams to wake  
And theres so much love to make  
  
I think were gonna need some time  
Maybe all we need is time  
And its telling me it might be you  
All of my life  
  
Ive been saving love songs and lullabies  
And theres so much more  
No ones ever heard before  
Somethings telling me it might be you  
Yeah its telling me it must be you  
And Im feeling itll just be you all of my life  
Ive been waiting for  
All of my life  
  
Maybe its you maybe its you  
Ive been waiting for all of my life  
Maybe its you maybe its you  
Ive been waiting for all of my life  
Its you its you Ive been waiting for all of my life
