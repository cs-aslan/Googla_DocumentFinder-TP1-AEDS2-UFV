I dont need anyone  
To tell me how to run my life  
Got along alright so far  
I dont really think I need to hear your advice  
Ive got my mind made up know what I want to do  
Ill do it anyway I choose  
So just sit back shut up for a minute let me show you what Im gonna do  
  
I aint got no time to waste on you  
You aint got no time to give  
Too hung up on all you did  
  
If you dont like it  
If you dont like it I dont care  
If you dont like it  
Hit the road cause I just dont care  
If you dont like it  
If you dont like it I dont care  
If you dont like it  
Hit the road cause I justjustjust dont care  
  
Ive seen em come and go  
The kind that do it all for the show  
They got their walkin talkin built in jive  
I dont really think theyre workin nine to five  
Take it to your heart gonna tell ya from the start  
Gonna send a word or two your way  
So just sit back take a ride on your pony  
Itll all come back to you one day  
  
I aint got no time to waste on you  
You aint got no time to give  
Too hung up on all you did  
  
If you dont like it  
If you dont like it I dont care  
If you dont like it  
Hit the road cause I just dont care  
If you dont like it  
If you dont like it I dont care  
If you dont like it  
Hit the road cause I justjustjust dont care  
  
If you dont like it  
If you dont like it I dont care  
If you dont like it  
Hit the road cause I just dont care  
If you dont like it  
If you dont like it I dont care  
If you dont like it  
Hit the road cause I just dont care

If you dont like it
