They kill for a reason  
Theyll strike anyone  
Doesnt matter how old or young  
Payem big cash theyll giveem a slash  
Explain how it should be done  
A shot in the head  
The man cut in half  
Tortured till death  
Youll never see him back  
  
Chorus  
Underground killers  
They are everywhere  
Killing for money  
They dont care  
Leaving their victims covered with blood  
Underground killers  
Will make a mess  
Whose killing plans have been set  
Murdering their victims without mercy  
They promise to make it worse  
Tellem their next mission  
And theyll giveem death  
Burn him alive  
A high voltage jolt  
A stab in the back  
They pomise youll see him dead  
  
Lead  
  
Slay the victim to death  
Dead bodies everywhere  
Brutality is their authority  
Killers are not afraid of death  
  
Chorus  
Underground killers  
They are everywhere  
Killing for money  
They dont care  
Leaving their victims covered with blood  
Underground killers  
Will make a mess  
Whose killing plans have been set  
Murdering their victims without mercy  
They promise to make it worse  
More massacre for the long future generation  
Their customers are the only police source of information  
Youve paidem in full  
For the dirty job theyve done  
Now you must die  
Like the other ones
