You were right  
And I dont want to be here  
If youre gonna be there  
Was that supposed to happen  
  
Ill hold tight  
Ill remember to smile  
Though it has been a while  
And without you doesnt matter  
  
Theres no room  
No place to start  
When our souls are apart  
  
I want to travel through time  
See your surprise  
Hold you so tight  
Im counting down the days  
  
Tonight  
I just want to be  
A million miles away from here  
Im counting down the days  
  
How youve been  
Its just the usual here  
And days are feeling like years  
And every days without you  
  
Now I cry  
Just a little too much  
When I think of your touch  
And every thing about you  
  
I feel cold  
Im in the dark  
When our souls are apart  
  
I want to travel through time  
See your surprise  
Hold you so tight  
Im counting down the days  
  
Tonight  
I just want to be  
A million miles away from here  
  
I want to travel through time  
See your surprise  
Hold you so tight  
Im counting down the days  
  
Tonight  
I just want to be  
A million miles away from here  
  
Im counting down the days  
Im counting down the days  
  
Im counting down the days  
Im gonna be your surprise  
Im gonna hold you so tight  
  
I want to travel through time  
See your surprise  
Id hold you so tight  
Im counting down the days  
  
Tonight  
I just want to be  
A million miles away from here  
  
I want to travel through time  
See your surprise  
Id hold you so tight  
Im counting down the days  
  
Tonight  
I just want to be  
A million miles away from here  
  
A million miles away from here
