Im just a girl with a crush on you  
Dont care about money  
It doesnt give me half the thrill  
To the thought of you honey  
So tell me that you want me still  
If only I could trade the fancy cars  
For a chance today its incomparable  
I might be sitting with the movie stars  
Everybody say that I have it all  
  
Chorus  
But I cant make you love me  
Is it my life or the things I do  
Cant make you love me  
Im just a girl with a crush on you  
  
I have been through changes yeah  
But Im still the girl you used to know  
Its made me no different  
So tell me why you had to go  
Oh baby I will trade the fancy cars  
For a chance today its incomparable  
I might be sitting with the movie stars  
Everybody say that I just have it all  
  
Chorus  
  
Just the thought of being close to you  
Its incomparable  
Should be happy with the life I live  
And the things I do  
Seems like I have it all  
  
Cant make you make you love me baby  
Its my life what can I do  
Cant make you love me alright  
Im just a girl with a crush on you  
  
Chorus  
  
Im just a girl with a crush on you
