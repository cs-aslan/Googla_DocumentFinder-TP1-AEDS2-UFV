I must have been blind adoring the blues  
In everything lies a small kind of truth  
But than again  
Just when I thought you were staying for good  
You left for no reason was that all you could  
Youre still a man  
  
Its not what I want  
Its not what I need  
Nothing but lies and way too much heat  
Just when I thought you were telling the truth  
I caught you with her oh you fool  
  
You hurt me  
When Ive got so much more to give  
You hurt me  
When Ive got so much more to give  
  
We live in denial adoring whats new  
In everything lies a small kind of blues  
But than again  
Just when I thought you were leaving for good  
You stayed for no reason although we were through  
Youre still a man  
  
Its not what I want  
Its not what I need  
Nothing but lies and way too much heat  
Just when I thought you were telling the truth  
I caught you with her oh you fool  
  
You hurt me  
When Ive got so much more to give  
You hurt me  
When Ive got so much more to give  
  
But then again  
Its not what I want  
Its not what I need  
Nothing but lies and way too much heat  
Just when I thought you were telling the truth  
I caught you with her oh you fool  
  
You hurt me  
When Ive got so much more to give  
You hurt me  
When Ive got so much more to give  
  
An everytime again  
You hurt me  
When Ive got so much more to give  
  
Everytime again  
You hurt me  
When Ive got so much more to give  
  
But then again  
You hurt me  
When Ive got so much more to give
