Im feelin so good right now  
Theres a handsome boy tells me how I changed his past  
He buys me a brandy  
But could it be hes really just after my ass  
  
He likes the clothes I wear  
He says he likes a man whos dressed in season  
But noone else ever stares hes being so kind  
Whats the reason  
  
How many friends have I really got  
You can count em on one hand  
How many friends have I really got  
How many friends have I really got  
That love me that want me thatll take me as I am  
  
Suddenly its the silver screen  
And a face so beautiful that I have to cry out  
Everybody hears me  
But I look like a fool now  
With a cry and I shy out  
She knows all of my friends  
But its nice to find a woman whos keen on living  
Now I think Ive reached the end  
I wonder in the dead of night  how do I rate  
  
How many friends have I really got  
How many friends have I really got  
How many friends have I really got  
That love me that want me thatll take me as I am  
  
Its all like a dream you know  
When youre still up early in the morning  
And you all sit together to watch the 1 come through  
But things dont look so good  
When you could use a bit of warning  
Then you know that noone will ever speak the truth about you  
  
How many friends have I really got  
How many friends have I really got  
How many friends have I really got  
That love me that want me thatll take me as I am  
  
When I first signed a contract  
It was more than a handshake then  
I know it still is  
But theres a plain fact  
We talk so much shit behind each others backs  
I get the willies  
People know nothing about their own soft gut  
So how come they can sum us up  
Without suffering all the hype weve known  
How come they bum us up  
  
How many friends have I really got  
You can count em on one hand  
How many friends have I really got  
How many friends have I really got  
That love me that want me thatll take me as I am
