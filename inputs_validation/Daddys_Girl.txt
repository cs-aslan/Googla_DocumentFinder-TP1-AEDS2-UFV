Sweet little child  
You know nothing  
About a cold world outside  
Youre too young to realize  
What he wants from you tonight  
  
Poor little girl  
There is no one  
You can trust in the world  
In the darkness of the night  
What hes doing is a crime  
  
Your mother denies  
Theres a problem  
Shes looking away  
She dont wanna hear you cry  
She will pray  
That its over for a while

Theres a problem  
Shes looking away  
She dont wanna hear you cry  
She will pray  
That its over for a while  
  
An ocean of silence  
Is drowning your heart  
What never should be  
Will remain in the dark
