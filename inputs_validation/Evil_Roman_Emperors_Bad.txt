Lead 1  
The famous Roman Empire  
  
Lead 2  
Was the biggest meanest neighbourhood  
Lead 3  
We four were the baddest emperors  
  
Lead 4  
And by Bad we dont mean Good  
  
Lead 1  
My name is Caligula  
A rotten Roman pigula  
If you told me a fibula  
Id hack your hands to stumps  
One time I killed a priest  
Whod come to sacrifice a beast  
Youd think its sad that hes deceased  
We all laughed like chumps  
  
Im very hairy but take note  
If you so much as whisper Goat  
With an iron rod you will be smote  
In a good mood today so I wont slit your throat  
  
Im bad  
  
Lead 24  
Hes bad  
  
Lead 1  
A shameless rotten cad  
Do you still have limbs since meeting me  
Then I guess you should be glad  
  
Lead 2  
Your nastiness was fabulous  
But my names Elagabalus  
And I was far far worse  
Just listen to my verse  
I was quite notorious  
For catapaulting venomous  
Snakes at Romes enormous  
Crowds oh how they fled  
If you won a lottery prize  
Id give you bees dead dogs and flies  
My house guests got a nice surprise  
A lion in their bed  
  
Youd think to children Id be cuter  
No I was their biggest executor  
Used their guts to read the future  
Says here I should get a job as a school tutor  
  
Im bad  
  
Lead 134  
Hes bad  
  
Lead 2  
Could argue I was sad  
Hated through our empire  
From Great Britain to Baghdad  
  
Lead 3  
Afraid your claim is bogus  
Cause my name is Commodus  
And no one else could be  
A worse emperor than me  
There never was a greater  
Pretend gladiator  
If the booing got too loud  
Made the lions fight the crowd  
Just one man was grander  
Julius Alexander  
So I killed him see  
Cause Im the emperor me  
  
Im bad  
  
Lead 124  
Hes bad  
  
lead 3  
My actions truly rad  
You only got the emperor job  
Cause you were chosen by your dad  
  
Lead 4  
To me you all score zero  
My name is Emperor Nero  
Evil men youre not  
Im the worstest of the lot  
My rule was full of fearo  
Yes men from far and nearo  
Called me a fighting hero  
Or I would have them slayed  
Changed the Olympic season  
So the medals went to me son  
Burned Christians for no reason  
Just a fun game I played you know  
  
Poisoned my stepbrother  
Ordered men to kill my mother  
Tried to drown her but she fled  
So I had her stabbed instead  
Wait Theres more  
With my first wife dear Octavia  
I showed truly bad behaviour  
Chopped her head off gave it to  
My girlfriend who I then killed too  
  
Im bad So baddy  
Of badness Im the daddy  
Come on I want to see  
A more evil bloke than me  
  
Lead 123  
Youre bad Real bad  
Nothing more to add  
We all thought that we were awful  
But you were really truly mad  
  
Lead 4  
Im the baddest emperor the Romans ever had
