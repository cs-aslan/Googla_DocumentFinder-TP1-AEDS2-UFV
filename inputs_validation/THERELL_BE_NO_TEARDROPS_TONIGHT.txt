Ill pretend Im free from sorrow  
Make believe that wrong is right  
Your wedding day will be tomorrow  
But therell be no teardrops tonight  
  
Why oh why should you desert me  
Are you doin this for spite  
If you only want to hurt me  
Then therell be no teardrops tonight  
  
Ill believe that you still love me  
When you wear your veil of white  
But you think that youre above me  
So therell be no teardrops tonight  
  
Shame oh shame for what youre doin  
Other arms will hold you tight  
You dont care whose life you ruin  
But therell be no teardrops tonight
