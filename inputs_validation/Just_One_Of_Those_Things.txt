As Dorothy Parker once said to her boy friend  
Fare thee well  
As Columbus announced when he knew he was bounced  
It was swell Isabelle swell  
As Abelard said to Heloise  
Dont forget to drop a line to me please  
As Juliet cried in her Romeos ear  
Romeo why not face that fact dear  
  
It was just one of those things  
Just one of those crazy flings  
One of those bells that now and then rings  
Just one of those things  
  
It was just one of those nights  
Just one of those fabulous flights  
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings  
Just one of those things  
  
If wed thought a bit  
Of the end of it  
When we started painting the town  
Wed have been aware  
That our love affair  
Was too hot not to cool down  
So goodbye Dear and Amen  
Heres hoping we meet now and then  
It was great fun  
But it was just one of those things
