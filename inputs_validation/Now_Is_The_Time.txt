I can smile on a warm summer day  
I can laugh I can listen to the children play  
But Im going to miss the killer with the kiss  
He was a friend of mine  
Now is the time now is the time  
Its going to rain hope it dont rain on you  
Theres going to be a lot of pain before this thing is through  
If Jesus was alive hed be standing on the M5  
Holding up a neon sign screaming  
Now is the time now is the time  
Now is the time so many people cant see  
They think that love is blind but it aint free  
Theres a line so many people have crossed and now  
Their love is lost say Goodbye my funny valentine  
Now is the time now is the time  
Now is the time now is the time  
I can run just as far as my eyes can see  
And Im free yeah just as free as I want to be  
But I wont ever forget that crazy little planet  
He was a friend of mine  
Now is the time now is the time  
Now is the time now is the time  
Now is the time now is the time  
Now is the time
