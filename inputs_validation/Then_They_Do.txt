In the early rush of morning  
Trying to get the kids to school  
Ones hanging on my shirttail  
Anothers locked up  
In her room  
And Im yelling up the stairs  
Stop worrying bout your hair  
You look fine  
  
Then theyre fightin in the backseat  
Im playing referee  
Now someones gotta go  
The moment that we leave  
And everybodys late  
I swear that I cant wait  
Till they grow up  
  
Chorus  
Then they do  
And thats how it is  
Its just quiet in the morning  
Cant believe  
How much you miss  
All they do  
And all they did  
You want all the dreams  
They dreamed of  
To come true  
Then they do  
  
Now the youngest is starting college  
Shell be leavin in the Fall  
And Briannas latest boyfriend  
Called to ask if we could talk  
And I got the impression  
That hes about to pop the question any day  
  
I look over at their pictures  
Sittin in their frames  
I see them as babies  
I guess thatll never change  
You pray all their lives  
That someday they will find happiness  
  
Chorus  
Then they do  
And thats how it is  
Its just quiet in the morning  
Cant believe  
How much you miss  
All they do  
And all they did  
You want all the dreams  
They dreamed of  
To come true  
Then they do  
  
No more Monday ptas  
No carpools  
Or soccer games  
Your work is done  
Now youve got time  
Thats all your own  
Youve been waitin for so long  
For those days to come  
  
Chorus  
Then they do  
And thats how it is  
Its just quiet in the morning  
Cant believe  
How much you miss  
All they do  
And all they did  
You want all the dreams  
They dreamed of  
To come true  
Then they do
