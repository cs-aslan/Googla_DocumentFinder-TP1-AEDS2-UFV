Wake of the flood laughing water fortynine  
Get out the pans dont just stand there dreaming  
Get out the way get out the way  
Here comes sunshine  
Here comes sunshine  
Line up a long shot maybe try it two times maybe more  
Good to know you got shoes to wear when you find the floor  
Why hold out for more  
Here comes sunshine  
Here comes sunshine  
Asking you nice now keep the mother rollin  
One more time been down before  
You just dont have to go no more no more  
Here comes sunshine  
Here comes sunshine
