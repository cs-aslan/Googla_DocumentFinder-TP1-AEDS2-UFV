He stepped it off and marked it therestepped it off and marked it there  
To be his ugly thoroughfareto be his ugly thoroughfare  
And he blessed it with his handyes its a great land all of it is  
And as it blooms before our eyesas it blooms before our eyes  
Just like an eden paradiselike an eden paradise

Slowly from hiding but surely they come  
Back to the homeland their fathers will front  
Israel their citadel israel their home  
Now they are here at last never to roam  
Here they will stay and bring life to the land  
Its a new day and with boldness they walk tall and so straight  
See them stand

To be his ugly thoroughfareto be his ugly thoroughfare

Rich fertile valleys of russet and gold carpets of green over mountains

As ages in prophets fortold
