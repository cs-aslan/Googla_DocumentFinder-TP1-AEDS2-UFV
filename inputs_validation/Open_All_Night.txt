Exit 8  
Small cafe  
Georgia moonlight  
Its three A M  
Ive been driving all night  
Got a funny air  
Redbrown hair  
In the porch light  
She said Were open all night  
So wont you come inside  
Its gonna be all right  
She said tired  
I said Im a little bit unstable  
She said Honey I will help you if Im able  
Theres a bottle of relief upon the table  
And were open all night  
So wont you come inside  
Its gonna be all right  
She said i was born the year the rockets landed  
Circa 1969 and I got stranded  
Yeah but the comets getting close  
And I cant stand it   
She said Were open all night  
So wont you come inside  
Exit A  
Small cafe  
Smoke at three  
Georgia moonlight  
Its eight A M  
Ive been drinking all night  
And there is nothing I will not do to make it all right  
She said Were open all night  
So wont you come inside  
Its gonna be all right
