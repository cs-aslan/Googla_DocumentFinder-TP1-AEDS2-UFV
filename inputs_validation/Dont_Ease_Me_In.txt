Dont ease dont ease dont ease me in  
Ive been all night long commin home dont ease me in  
When I turned around sweet mama she was way across town  
So Im walkin down the street with a dollar in my hand  
Ive been lookin for a woman sweet mama aint got no man  
The girl I love shes sweet and true  
You the dress she wears sweet mama its pink and blue  
She brings me coffee she brings me tea  
She brings me bout every damm thing but the jailhouse keys
