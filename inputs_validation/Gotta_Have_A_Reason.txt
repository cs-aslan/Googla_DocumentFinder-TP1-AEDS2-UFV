Here we stand caught between the cradle and the grave  
In a world that gives you nothing but your name  
With every step you take you must be brave  
Nothing lost is nothing gained  
  
And I know lives are lost for crowns and kings  
We all know love is lost for lesser things  
And the angels here have broken wings  
Though I know somewhere a choir sings  
  
You gotta have a reason  
A reason to believe  
A reason just to dream  
Sometimes it takes blind eyes to see  
A reason to believe  
  
A hotheaded hero here you see Im just a man  
Comes a time a time to make a stand yeah  
So here I am with heart in hand  
Dont be afraid to understand  
  
You gotta have a reason  
One reason to believe  
A reason just to dream  
Sometimes it takes blind eyes to see  
A reason to believe in trust  
  
I believe in faith  
I believe in us  
Til my dying day  
You gotta have a reason  
Whoa you gotta have a reason yeah  
  
If all weve got is you and me  
Then what weve got is all we need  
  
You gotta have a reason  
One reason to believe  
A reason just to dream  
But sometimes it takes blind eyes to see  
One reason  
  
You gotta have a reason  
One reason to believe  
A reason just to dream  
But sometimes it takes blind eyes to see  
One reason  
  
You gotta have a reason  
Whoa you gotta have a reason  
One reason to believe  
A reason just to dream yeah
