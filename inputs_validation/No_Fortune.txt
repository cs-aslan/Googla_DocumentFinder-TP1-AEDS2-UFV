We were dancin in the middle  
We could hardly hold our heads up  
I think we had too much to drink  
I remember wondering what theyd think  
Da da da da da da da  
We were thinkin bout the future  
We were trying not to laugh  
Then you made me cry instead  
I remember wishing I was dead  
Da da da da da da da  
No fortune pays for wounds like these  
Its been too long a time now please  
Just say you will we can call it a day  
Its not as though we aint sinned  
Its just a game we all play  
There was nothing to win  
Well Im coming home lady  
Im your homecoming man  
Trying hard to stand the rain  
Gettin back on my feet again  
Da da da da da da da  
No fortune pays for wounds like these  
Its been too long a time now please  
Just say you will we can call it a day  
Its not as though we aint sinned  
Its just a game we all play  
There was nothing to win  
Da da da da da da da  
No fortune pays for wounds like these  
Its been too long a time now please  
Just say you will we can call it a day  
Its not as though we aint sinned  
Its just a game we all play  
There was nothing to win  
Da da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da da
