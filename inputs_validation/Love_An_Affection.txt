Well I love the way you walk  
With your skin tight stride  
You got my eyes wide open  
An my loose tongue tied  
A French kiss mouth  
An a smile so bad  
Youre the finest woman  
That I ever had  
So its alright  
Do anything you want to do  
  
Nobody had to tell you  
How to make a mans heart bleed  
Your mama always knew  
You was born to succeed  
I can see the honey juice  
Dripping off your lips  
Girl you got the Midas Touch  
Its in your fingertips  
But its alright  
Do anything you want to do  
  
Cause after midnight Ill be alright  
Riding on Cupids train  
You give me loving like Ive never had before  
Im back in the saddle again  
  
So give me love an affection  
Love an affection  
A little love an affection  
Sure nuff goes a long long way  
  
You put your arms around me  
Like a circle round the sun  
Your eyes turn on the hypnotizing game  
You play for fun  
Im caught in your spell  
Just like the spider an the fly  
An I cant break away from you  
No matter how I try  
But its alright  
Do anything you want to do  
  
cause after midnight Ill be alright  
Riding on Cupids train  
You give me loving like Ive never had before  
Im back in the saddle again  
  
So give me love an affection  
Love an affection  
A little love an affection  
Sure nuff goes a long long way  
  
cause after midnight Ill be alright  
Riding on Cupids train  
You give me loving like Ive never had before  
Im back in the saddle again  
  
So give me love an affection  
Love an affection  
A little love an affection  
Sure nuff goes a long long way  
  
Love an affection  
A little love an affection  
Baby baby love an affection  
Sure nuff goes a long long way  
  
Love love love  
Love love love  
I need love an affection  
Sure nuff goes a long long way
