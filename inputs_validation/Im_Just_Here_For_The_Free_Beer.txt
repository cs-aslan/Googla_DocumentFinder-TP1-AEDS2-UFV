Jumping off the rooftops  
Making all the clouds pop  
Come one and all  
Its time for a shake up  
  
Faking is the new wheel  
Liars make a new deal  
Watch it unravel  
How dumb do you feel  
  
I dont really care about society  
I dont really care go on and lie to me  
I dont really care if we dont agree  
I dont really care what you think about me  
  
Mic check 1 2  
Firewall break it through  
Molotovs are falling Pump up the volume  
A minor threat like you  
Paperweight torn in two  
Kill switch stalling Pump up the volume  
  
I dont give a fuck about your revolution  
I dont give a fuck about your institution  
I dont give a fuck and I aint gonna listen  
I dont give a fuck about your expectation  
I dont give a fuck about your motivation  
I dont give a fuck and I aint gonna listen  
  
Crashing in a new car  
Burning like an old star  
Rise for the fall of it all  
Its a new war  
  
Money makes a mean shield  
Bleed as your skin peels  
Knees cut in gravel  
How numb do you feel  
  
I dont really care about your anarchy  
I dont really care if youre judging me  
I dont really care about your jealousy  
I dont give a fuck what you think about me  
  
I really really care about what youre thinking  
All of your thoughts all the money youre making  
I really really care about what youre drinking  
How did you get so cool  
I really really care to hear about your day  
Of all the cool people that you met today  
Really really care what you have to say  
Nah Im just kidding  
Fuck off
