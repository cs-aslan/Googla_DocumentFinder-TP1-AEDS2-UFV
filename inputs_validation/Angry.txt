Angry please dont be angry  
Cause I was only teasing you  
I wouldnt even let you think of leavin  
Dont you know I love you true  
Just because I took a look at somebody else  
Thats no reason you should put poor me on the shelf  
Angry please dont be angry  
Cause I was only teasing you  
Dont believe a thing you hear just wait till you see  
Then youll find no cause to show that youre jealous of me  
Oh Angry please dont be angry  
Cause I was only teasing you  
Music by Henry Brunies and Jules Cassard
