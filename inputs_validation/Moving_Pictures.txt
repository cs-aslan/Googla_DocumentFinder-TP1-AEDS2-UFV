Last night I saw a movie  
And I thought about many movies Ive seen at your house  
Excuse me if Im rude  
But Id rather that we just strike from the record ones Id see again without
you  
Leaning on my shoulder  
Distracting me from the plot line  
  
Where can I go when I want you around  
But I cant stand to be around you  
Go home  
Ill walk myself to you  
Ill walk myself away from here  
  
Go to hell is all I thought for seven weeks  
But I grew out of that phase looking at these broken photographs of people  
Looking glossed just like a summer ago  
  
Where can I go when I want you around  
But I cant stand to be around you  
Go home  
Ill walk myself to you  
Ill walk myself away from here  
  
Call me back Im pleading with a cork in my head  
It wouldnt be the first time  
My pillow has been mistaken  
  
Where can I go when I want you around  
But I cant stand to be around you  
Go home  
Ill walk myself to you  
Ill walk myself away from here  
  
Cant stand to be around you  
Around you around you  
Cant stand to be around you  
Cant stand I cant stand  
To be around you  
Around you
