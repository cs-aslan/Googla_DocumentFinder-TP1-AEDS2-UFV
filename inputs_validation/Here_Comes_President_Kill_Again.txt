Here comes President Kill again  
Surrounded by all of his killing men  
Telling us who why where and when  
President Kill wants killing again  
  
Hooray ring out the bells  
King Conscience is dead  
Hooray now back in your cells  
Weve President Kill instead  
  
Here comes President Kill again  
Broadcasting from his killing den  
Dressed in pounds and dollars and yen  
President Kill wants killing again  
  
Hooray hang out the flags  
Queen Caring is dead  
Hooray well stack body bags  
For President Kill instead

Here comes President Kill again  
From pure White House to Number 10  
Taking lives with a smoking pen  
President Kill wants killing again

Now President Kill is dead  
Hooray Ill bet you cant wait  
To vote for President Kill instead
