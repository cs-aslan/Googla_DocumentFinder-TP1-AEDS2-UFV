Beautiful things  
Are comin my way  
Beautiful things  
I want them to stay  
But after a while  
My beautiful things  
Dont seem beautiful at all  
  
Terrible things  
Like when you wake up  
And all of your dreams  
Seem to crack up  
Like things you have done  
Like breakin my heart  
For you it dont seem  
Terrible at all  
  
Is there someone I can talk to  
Someone on the line  
Does anybody want to hear  
Whats on my mind  
  
Beautiful things  
Like leaves on a tree  
Beautiful things  
The sky and the sea  
Since youve been gone  
No beautiful things  
Seem beautiful to me  
  
Is there someone I can talk to  
Someone out there on the line  
Does anybody want to hear  
Whats on my mind  
  
Make the grass grow in the garden  
When the rain is passin by  
Does anybody want to know  
Whats on my mind
