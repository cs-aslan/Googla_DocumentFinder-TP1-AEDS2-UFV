I just cut the string  
On a dusty old shoe box  
And opened a door to the past  
Now Im sittin here with my souvenirs  
And these faded old photographs  
  
Fightin back tears  
Lookin back through the years  
And wonderin why dreams fade so fast  
Now the young boy I see  
Dont look like the me  
Reflected in this old looking glass  
  
The man in the mirror  
Sees things so much clearer  
Than the boy in the pictures  
With his eyes full of dreams  
Oh the men that Ive tried to be  
From fifteen to fortythree  
Never believed that theyd end up like me  
  
Theres that touchdown I caught  
Back when I thought  
Id play for the cowboys someday  
Theres you holding me in my faded fatigues  
Comin home to the you S A  
  
One after another  
All my sweet dreams and lovers  
Pass before my tear filled eyes  
Pictures of a fool  
Who was selfish and cruel  
Till the day he made you say goodbye  
  
The man in the mirror  
Sees things so much clearer  
Than the boy in the pictures  
With his eyes full of dreams  
Oh the men that Ive tried to be  
From fifteen to fortythree  
Never believed that theyd end up like me  
  
Oh I never believed Id be lonely like me
