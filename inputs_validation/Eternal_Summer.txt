I cant do this again  
I need more oxygen  
Our days were never numbered  
This is eternal summer  
I cant do this again  
I need more oxygen  
Our days were never numbered  
This is eternal summer  
  
When youre watching this  
Ill be in the desert just wishing on every star  
Scuba diving in the wishing well  
Just trying to save myself  
Hands in the air  
Hands in the air  
But Ill save the middle finger for you  
You get scared when you look at me  
Cause I Im so fine  
Miss me Me love Mr Superstar  
Hands in the air  
Hands in the air  
But Ill save the middle finger for you  
  
I cant do this again  
I need more oxygen  
Our days were never numbered  
This is eternal summer  
I cant do this again  
I need more oxygen  
Our days were never numbered  
This is eternal summer
