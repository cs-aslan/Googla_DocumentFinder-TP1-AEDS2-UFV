I got two hands  
I want to clap my hands together  
I got two legs  
I want to dance to heavens door  
I got one heart  
I gonna fill it up with up Jesus  
And I aint gonna think about trouble anymore  
  
Well now this old world sometimes it does get lonesome  
And its many a grown man has hung his head and cried  
Down in your soul theres one that wont desert you  
Aint it fine to have the Saviour by your side  
  
Now the Lord resides inside a house of golden  
And faith is the door and love is the key  
And warm is the light pouring from his mighty windows  
And that light my friend it shines on you and me  
  
When the wind blows on that faithful morning  
And I close my eyes Lord and fly my body home  
I dont want my friends to cry no tears about me  
Ill be batheing in the glory of the throne  
  
I got two hands  
I want to clap my hands together  
I got two legs  
I want to dance to heavens door  
I got one heart  
I gonna fill it up with up Jesus  
And I aint gonna think about trouble anymore
