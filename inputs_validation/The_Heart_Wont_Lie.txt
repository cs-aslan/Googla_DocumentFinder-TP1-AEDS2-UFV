Looking back over the years  
Of All the things Ive always meant to say  
But words didnt come easily  
So many times through empty fears  
Of all of the nights I tried to pick up the phone  
So scared of who might be answering  
  
You try to live your life from day to day  
But seeing you across the room tonight  
Just gives me away  
  
Chorus  
Cause the heart wont lie  
Sometimes life gets in the way  
But theres one thing that wont change  
I know Ive tried  
The heart wont lie  
You can live your alibi  
Who can see youre lost inside a foolish disguise  
The heart wont lie  
  
Long after tonight  
Will you still hear my voice through the radio  
Old desires make us act carelessly  
Long after tonight after the fire  
After the scattered ashes fly  
Through the four winds blown and gone  
Will you come back to me  
  
You try to live your life from day to day  
But seeing you across the room tonight  
Just gives me away  
  
Chorus
