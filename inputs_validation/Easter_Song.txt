Hear the bells ringing  
Theyre singing that you can be born again  
Hear the bells ringing  
Theyre singing Christ is risen from the dead  
  
The angel up on the tombstone  
Said He has risen just as He said  
Quickly now go tell his disciples  
That Jesus Christ is no longer dead  
  
Joy to the word He has risen hallelujah  
Hes risen hallelujah  
Hes risen hallelujah  
  
Hear the bells ringing  
Theyre singing that you can be healed right now  
Hear the bells ringing theyre singing  
Christ He will reveal it now  
  
The angels they all surround us  
And they are ministering Jesus power  
Quickly now reach out and receive it  
For this could be your glorious hour  
  
Joy to the world He has risen hallelujah  
Hes risen hallelujah  
Hes risen hallelujah hallelujah  
  
The angel up on the tombstone  
Said He has risen just as He said  
Quickly now go tell his disciples  
That Jesus Christ is no longer dead  
  
Joy to the world He has risen hallelujah  
Hes risen hallelujah  
Hes risen hallelujah  
Hallelujah
