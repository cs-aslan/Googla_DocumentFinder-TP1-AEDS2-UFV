george like to bring on a friend of us all mr Bob dylan  
  
Oh where have you been my blueeyed son  
And where have you been my darling young one  
Ive stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains  
Ive walked and Ive crawled on six crooked highways  
Ive stepped in the middle of seven sad forests  
Ive been out in front of a dozen dead oceans  
Ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard  
Its a hard and its a hard its a hard its a hard  
Its a hard rains agonna fall  
  
Oh what did you see my blueeyed son  
And what did you see my darling young one  
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it  
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it  
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin  
I saw a room full of men with their hammers ableedin  
I saw a white ladder all covered with water  
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken  
And its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard  
Its a hard rains agonna fall  
  
What did you hear my blueeyed son  
And what did you hear my darling young one  
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warnin  
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world  
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were ablazin  
Heard ten thousand whisperin and nobody listenin  
I heard one person starve I heard many people laughin  
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter  
And its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard  
Its a hard rains agonna fall  
  
Who did you meet my blueeyed son  
Who did you meet my darling young one  
I met a young child beside a dead pony  
I met a white man who walked a black dog  
I met a young woman whose body was burning  
I met a young girl she gave me a rainbow  
I met one man who was wounded in love  
I met another man who was wounded in hatred  
Its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard  
Its a hard rains agonna fall  
  
Oh whatll you do now my blueeyed son  
And whatll you do now my darling young one  
Im agoin back out fore the rain starts afallin  
Ill walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest  
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty  
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters  
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison  
The executioners face is always well hidden  
Where hunger is ugly where souls are forgotten  
Where black is the color and none is the number  
And Ill tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it  
Reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it  
Then Ill stand on the ocean until I start sinkin  
But Ill know my song well before I start singin  
And its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard  
Its a hard rains agonna fall  
  
Its a hard rains a gonna fall  
Its a hard rains a gonna fall
