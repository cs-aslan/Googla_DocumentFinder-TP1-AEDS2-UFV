Baby you look so good  
I knew you would  
Please dont go away  
Darling say its okay  
  
I want to make violent love  
To you by the moon above  
I want to make violent love to you  
  
I want to kiss every night  
To squeeze and hold you tight  
I want to make violent love to you  
  
I dont want seem frantic  
I dont want to cramp your style  
Youre driving me into a panic  
You just want to drive me drive me  
Drive me drive me wild
