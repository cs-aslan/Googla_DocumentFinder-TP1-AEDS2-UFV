Earth to Bella  
You think youve got it all figured in  
Earth to Bella  
Everything you know is wrong well almost  
Earth to Bella  
I see where you are not listening  
I bear the burden of being the voice that lets you know  
We all grow old  
And before you swim youve gotta be okay to sail  
  
Earth to Bella  
The world can be an unfriendly place  
So hold your head up  
And do your best to save some face  
Its not so hard  
Just undo yourself and see your second sun  
Escape  
  
Okay to sing  
Im okay to sing  
Im okay to sing  
Im okay to sing  
  
Earth to Bella  
I sense a quiet emergency  
Earth to Bella  
Theres so much more to get theyre wrong  
  
Earth to Bella  
Wading water successfully  
Or are you really  
Dont you want to see the deep  
Its not so hard  
Just forgive yourself and  
Feel the water over you
