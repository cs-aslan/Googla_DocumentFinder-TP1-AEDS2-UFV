My minds got a mind of its own  
It takes me out a walkin when Id rather stay at home  
Takes me out to parties when Id rather be alone  
My minds got a mind of its own  
  
Ive been doing things I thought Id never do  
Ive been getting into trouble without ever meaning to  
Id as soon settle down but Im right back up again  
I feel just like a leaf out in the wind  
  
chorus  
I seem to forget half the things I start  
I try to build a house and then I tear the place apart  
I freeze myself on fire and then I burn myself on ice  
I cant count to one without thinking twice  
  
chorus  
I tell myself to do the things I should  
And then I get to thinkin that them things aint any good  
I tell myself the truth but know Im lying like a snake  
You cant walk on water at the bottom of a lake
