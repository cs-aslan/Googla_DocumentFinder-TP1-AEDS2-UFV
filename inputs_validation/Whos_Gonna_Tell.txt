Whos gonna tell the orange  
Theyre actually brown  
Whos gonna mop up for grey  
When theyve painted the town  
  
Its the news that everyone dreads  
That were no longer painting it red  
That our gags still funny  
But theyve opted for a different clown  
  
You were great in the sixties  
But were gonna have to pull you down  
Nothing like the sound of the shallow  
Jumping in at the deep  
  
Royaltys balloon coming down  
Is a memorable shriek  
Nothing quite like the sickening clout  
Of the dive into pool drained out  
  
You excelled as a Queen  
But youll have to return the crown  
You were great in the sixties  
But were gonna have to pull you down  
  
Whos gonna tell the tall  
Theyre beginning to shrink  
Like whos gonna tell the Swiss  
Theyre no longer in sync  
  
Well have to get the maroon  
In a separate counselling room  
Say it may be your washer  
But you seem to be fading to pink  
  
Yesterdays ice cool  
Doesnt take long to melt and sink  
Whos gonna tell the cities  
That are acting like towns  
  
Theyre actually just a village  
That the posh surrounds  
The diplomatic answer  
To your 25 stone dancer  
  
Is your acts still great  
But we cant keep changing a pound  
You were Queen in your day  
But youre gonna have to give back the crown  
  
You were great in the sixties  
But were gonna have to pull you down
