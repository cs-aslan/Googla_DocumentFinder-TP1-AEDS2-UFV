When did life become so complicated  
Years of too much thought and time I wasted  
And in each line upon my face  
Is proof I fought and lived another day  
  
When did life become this place of madness  
Drifting on an empty sea of waves and sadness  
I make believe Im in control  
And dream it wasnt all my fault  
  
When your feet dont touch the ground  
When your voice wont make a sound  
Here its safe in this place up off the clouds  
  
When your feet dont touch the earth  
You cant feel the fates that hurt  
And youre free theres no need to come down  
When your feet dont touch the ground  
  
Everyday just feels a little longer  
Why am I the only one not getting stronger  
Running around pretending lifes a play  
It doesnt make the darkness go away  
  
I may be young but I can still remember  
Feeling full of joy crying tears of laughter  
Now all my tears are all cried out  
Makebelieve but count me out  
  
Cause my feet are on the ground  
And the inner voice I found  
Tells the truth Theres no use  
If your heads in the clouds  
  
With my feet on solid earth  
I can face the fates that hurt  
And in time Ill be fine  
Ill come round  
  
I was once like you  
Life was a maze  
I couldnt find my way out  
But what I say is true  
You will be amazed  
Makebelieve and you will find out that its true  
  
When your feet dont touch the ground  
When your voice wont make a sound  
Here its safe In this place  
Up off the clouds  
When your feet dont touch the earth  
You cant feel the fates that hurt  
And youre free theres no need to come down  
When your feet dont touch the ground
