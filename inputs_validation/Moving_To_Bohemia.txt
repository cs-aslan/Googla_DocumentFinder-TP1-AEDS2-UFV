Where the airs not clean  
Where the waters glowing green  
Where the dogs are mean  
  
Im Moving to Bohemia  
Taking you along  
Say goodbye to suburbia  
You dont have to cut the lawn  
  
I had a dream of a different place  
I had a dream that you had a different face  
I heard a scream of a desperate kind  
Ive got a feeling that youre going love what  
Youll find  
  
Where were on TV  
Where the money grows on trees  
Where the beer is free  
  
Moving to Bohemia  
Taking you along  
Say goodbye to Utopia  
Well wave before were gone  
  
I had a dream of a different place  
I had a dream that you had a different face  
I hear the beat of an anxious heart  
I feel the heat its time for us to start  
Time for us to start  
  
Im moving to Bohemia  
Where the literatures obscene  
Bathing in Euphoria  
Where the naked truth is on the screen  
  
I had a dream of a different place  
I had a dream that you had a different face  
I heard a scream of a desperate kind  
Ive got a feeling that  
Youre going love what youll find  
  
Youre going love what youll find
