Care not for the men who wonder  
Straw that broke your back youre under  
Cast all them aside who care  
Empty eyes and dead end stare  
  
Prechorus  
Dont you know that none are blind  
To the lie and you think I dont find  
what you hide  
  
Chorus  
What in Gods name have you done  
Stick your arm for some real fun  
  
For the horse youve grown much fonder  
Than for me that I dont ponder  
As the hair of one who bit you  
Smiling bite your own self too  
  
Prechorus  
And I think that youre not blind  
To the ones you left behind  
Ill be here  
  
Chorus  
What in Gods name have you done  
Stick your arm for some real fun AAH  
  
So be yearning all your life  
Twisting turning like a knife  
  
Prechorus  
Now you know the reasons why  
Cant get high or you will die  
Or youll die  
  
Chorus  
What in Gods name have you done  
Stick your arm for some real fun  
So your sickness weighs a ton  
And Gods name is smack for some
