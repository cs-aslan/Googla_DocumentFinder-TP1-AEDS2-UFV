I cant see your face in my mind  
I cant see your face in my mind  
Carnival dogs consume the lines  
Cant see your face in my mind  
  
Dont you cry  
Baby  
Please dont cry  
And dont look at me with your eyes  
  
I cant seem to find the right lie  
I cant seem to find the right lie  
  
Insanitys horse adorns the sky  
Cant seem to fing the right lie  
  
Carnival dogs consume the lines  
Cant see your face in my mind  
  
Dont you cry  
Baby  
Please dont cry  
I wont need your picture  
Until we say goodbye
