I used to live my life in vain  
Until today its been the same  
Ive gone away to disappear  
My life with you was just too dear  
A better life is all I need  
To free me from this naughty league  
Ive been and gone  
I wont be back  
Ill live my life without all that  
  
With my own eyes  
I realize  
It was time to say goodnight  
I was never really sure  
But now I know Im right  
  
I used to live my life in vain  
Until today its been the same  
Ive gone away to reappear  
My life with you was just too dear  
A better life is all I need  
To free me from this naughty league  
Ive been and gone  
And I wont be back  
And I wont be back
