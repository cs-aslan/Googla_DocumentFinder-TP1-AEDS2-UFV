Make me a deal and make it straight  
All signed and sealed Ill take it  
To Robert E Lee Ill show it  
I hope and pray he dont blow it cause  
Weve been around a long time just try try try tryin to  
Make the big time  
  
Take me on a roller coaster  
Take me for an airplane ride  
Take me for a six days wonder but dont you  
Dont you throw my pride aside besides  
Whats real and make believe  
Baby Janes in Acapulco We are flyin down to Rio  
Throw me a line Im sinking fast  
Clutching at straws cant make it  
Havana sound were trying hard edge the hipster jiving  
Last picture shows down the drivein  
Youre so sheer youre so chic  
Teenage rebel of the week  
Flavours of the mountain steamline  
Midnight blue casino floors  
Dance the chacha through till sunrise  
Open up exclusive doors oh wow  
  
Just like flamingos look the same  
So me and you just we two got to search for something new  
Far beyond the pale horizon  
Some place near the desert strand  
Where my Studebaker takes me  
Thats where Ill make my stand but wait  
Cant you see that Holzer mane  
Whats her name Virginia Plain
