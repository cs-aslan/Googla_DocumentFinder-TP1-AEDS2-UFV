Love  
Devotion  
Feeling  
Emotion  
  
Dont be afraid to be weak  
Dont be too proud to be strong  
Just look into your heart my friend  
That will be the return to yourself  
The return to innocence  
  
Chanting  
  
If you want then start to laugh  
If you must then start to cry  
Be yourself dont hide  
Just believe in destiny  
  
Dont care what people say  
Just follow your own way  
Dont give up and lose the chance  
To return to innocence  
  
Chanting  
  
Thats not the beginning of the end  
Thats the return to yourself  
The return to innocence  
  
Chanting
