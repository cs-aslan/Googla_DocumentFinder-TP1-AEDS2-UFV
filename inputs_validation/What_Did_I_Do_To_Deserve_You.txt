Unbelievable describes your smile so sweet  
Inconceivable that youre a part of me  
The innocent look in your eyes  
Love without compromise for me  
Its a mystery  
  
What did I do to deserve you  
Only Gods hands could have made you  
And brought this dream to life  
Always swore that I I would never fall  
I guess miracles happen after all  
And what did I ever do to deserve you  
  
Unconventional describes my love for you  
Unconditional cause theres nothing I wont do  
I pray as this feeling grows  
That youll always touch the heart and so love me  
Its a mystery  
  
What did I do to deserve you  
Only Gods hands could have made you  
And brought this dream to life  
Always swore that I I would never fall  
I guess miracles happen after all  
And what did I ever do to deserve you  
  
Ive waited all my life  
To hold such a treasure  
What is this feeling worth  
Theres no measure  
What did I do  
  
You brought this dream to life  
  
Always swore that I I would never fall  
I guess miracles happen after all  
And what did I ever do to deserve you  
  
To deserve you  
To deserve you
