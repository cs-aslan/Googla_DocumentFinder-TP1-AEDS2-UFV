In the night I hear you speak  
Turn around youre in my sleep  
Feel your hands inside my soul  
Youre holding on and you wont let go  
  
Ive tried running but theres no escape  
Cant bend them and I just cant break these  
  
Chorus  
Steel bars wrapped all around me  
Ive been your prisoner since the day you found me  
Im bound forever till the end of time  
Steel bars wrapped around this heart of mine  
  
Trying hard to recognize  
See the face behind the eyes  
Feel your haunting ways like chains  
Round my heart they still remain  
  
Chorus  
  
And with every step I take  
Every desperate move I make  
Its clear to me  
What can all my living mean  
When time itself is so obscene  
When time itself dont mean a thing  
Im still loving you  
  
Chorus
