Lookin so rambunctious  
Got me wide open to golf  
Im really anxious to get familiar  
Get in your subconscious and discuss  
The many different various  
Issues that affiliate the best of both of us  
Word the mother  
And as we ride up on the Bus  
Conversation is making the whole situation a plus  
Just figure it out  
Is we dealing wit us  
Or do we capture that feeling that  
Makes you curious  
About whether or not we minimize the fuss  
Just to move on you must trust in Bussa Bus  
And from the bus horse carriages carry us  
Singin Sarafina a little ghetto fabulous
