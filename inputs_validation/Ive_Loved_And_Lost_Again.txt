Ive loved and lost again  
Oh what a crazy world were livin in  
True love has no chance to win  
Ive loved and lost again  
  
I ask you what chance have I  
When each love I meet just makes me cry  
He loves awhile then says goodbye  
Ive loved and lost again  
  
CHORUS  
To be true to one alone  
Dont seem to matter anymore  
They tell you youre out of style  
Unless youve had three or four  
  
REPEAT FIRST VERSE  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
REPEAT FIRST VERSE
