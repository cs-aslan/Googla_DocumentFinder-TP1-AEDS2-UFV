Its no secret Ive been waiting  
But I didnt expect this  
Nothing will remain  
Nothing stays the same  
After you came  
  
Its no secret Ive been starving  
I never felt anything for years  
I sat up all night  
Just to watch your smile  
When youre sleeping  
  
I was so lucky you came by  
And turned a different corner  
I couldve been somewhere else  
You couldve passed by couldve passed by  
  
Come on and sail the sea with me  
Come on lets go around the world  
Maybe find a flat  
Or a canyon house  
For the season  
  
I was so lucky you came by  
And turned a different corner  
It couldve been someone else  
You had in mind  
I was so lucky you found me  
My rags turned gold and silver  
I couldve been somewhere else  
You couldve passed by couldve passed by  
  
What would you make of this my baby  
The sun through the trees  
Is there a better place to be  
  
I was so lucky you came by  
And turned a different corner  
It could have been someone else  
You had in mind oh my  
I was so lucky you picked me  
My trash turned to silver  
Yea I could have been somewhere else  
You couldve passed by couldbe passed by
