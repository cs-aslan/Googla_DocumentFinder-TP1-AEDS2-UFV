When will it stop raining When will these dark clouds go  
Some days I get so low but you turn me around you turn me around  
Wont you come down to my dark street and shine a light  
cause I need your sweet sunshine  
Wont you come down to my dark street and shine a light  
cause I need your sweet sunshine  
You take away my sadness and the pain inside my heart  
  
Sometimes I fall apart but you turn me around you turn me around  
Wont you come down to my dark street and shine a light  
cause I need your sweet sunshine  
Wont you come down to my dark street and shine a light  
cause I need your sweet sunshine  
Sunshine  
  
Wont you come down to my dark street and shine a light  
cause I need your sweet sunshine  
Wont you come down to my dark street and shine a light  
cause I need your sweet sunshine  
  
Oh yeah oh come on down come on down  
And never leave my sky again  
Shine your love light love light love light love light  
Down on me down on me
