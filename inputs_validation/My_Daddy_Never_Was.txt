My boss will tell you that Ive been to work all week on time  
That I aint had no liquor on my breathe  
Aint no kinda secret Ive been known to take a drink  
And its made me do some things that I regret  
  
Loretta said this aint no kind of way to raise a family  
And one night she called it quits and called a cab  
She left her clothes out on the clothes line  
And the dishes in the sink  
So I guess she knows that she aint coming back  
  
Well I just want to see my kids  
I just want to hold my girls  
Heaven knows I aint got much of nothing else in this ole world  
I just want to be around enough to know that theyve been loved  
I just want to be their daddy my daddy never was  
  
Now lately shes been knowin this old boy she met in church  
And I cant say shes wrong for wanting more  
I gave him the right to tell my wife that I cant come around  
The night I knocked a hole in her front door  
  
And Loretta took my keys and she made me wait outside  
But she didnt call the law she called a cab  
And as I pulled away I saw something in her eyes  
So I reckon that she knows I aint so bad  
  
I just want to see my kids  
I just want to hold my girls  
Heaven knows I aint got much of nothing else in this ole world  
I just want to be around enough to know that theyve been loved  
I just want to be their daddy my daddy never was  
  
Well my boss will tell you that Ive been to work all week on time  
And I aint had no liquor on my breathe
