Whos the one to knock me over  
Whos the one to take me by surprise  
Whos the one whos out to get me  
Who will share my fantasy tonight  
It could be you it could be me  
It could be anyone  
It could be you it could be me  
It could be you it could be anyone  
Do you really know the story  
Have you really come to see the band  
Can you reach out for the glory  
Can you feel the nearness of my hand  
It could be you it could be me  
It could be anyone  
If you look a little harder  
You can see were really all the same  
And if you look a little deeper  
Cant you see its really all a game  
It could be you instead of me  
It could be anyone  
It could be you it could be me  
It could be you it could be anyone
