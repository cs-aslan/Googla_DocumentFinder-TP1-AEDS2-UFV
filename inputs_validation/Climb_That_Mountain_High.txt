Red sun arising over the hill  
Ive had enough of this desert to last from now until  
Im tired of living daytoday and handtomouth  
This could be the day I finally find my way out  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna climb that mountain high  
Im gonna see whats on the other side  
Im gonna kiss this town goodbye  
Im gonna climb that mountain  
  
How I arrived here heaven only knows  
Seems more like the kind of place the devil wouldve chose  
To spend my life here is more than I can do  
I know somewhere down the road my dream will come true  
  
Chorus  
  
If I stay here forever  
What will I have to show  
But if I make it over  
Then everyone will know  
Im gonna climb that mountain high  
  
Chorus
