No future they say  
But must it be that way  
Now is calling  
The city is human  
  
Chorus   
Blind youth take hope  
Youre no Joe Soap  
Your time is due  
Big fun come soon  
Weve had it easy we should be glad  
Highrise livings not so bad  
  
Chorus  
  
Dehumanisation  
Is such a big word  
Its been around since  
Richard The Third  
Dehumanisation  
Its easy to say  
But if youre not a hermit  
You know the citys OK  
No future they say  
But must it be that way  
Now is calling  
The city is human  
  
Repeat chorus twice  
Weve had it easy we should be glad  
Highrise livings not so bad  
  
Repeat chorus three times
