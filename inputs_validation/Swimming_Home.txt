Way down  
Ive been way down  
Underneath this skin  
Waiting to hear my name again  
  
Im sorry  
Nothing can hold me  
I adore you still  
If I hear them calling  
And nothing can hold me  
  
Way down Do you really want me  
All the way down Do you really want me  
I will hear your voice Do you really want me  
But Ill no longer understand No ones really loved me  
  
Im sorry  
Nothing can hold me  
I adore you still  
But I hear them calling  
  
I was looking to the sky  
When I knew Id be swimming home  
And I cannot betray my kind  
They are here its my time  
  
Im sorry  
Nothing can hold me Do you really want me  
I adore you still  
But I hear them calling calling  
And nothing can hold me
