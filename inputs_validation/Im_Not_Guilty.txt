Hey little baby I dont want to talk  
I really like the way how you walk  
Ill tell you no lies I tell you the truth  
That Im hooked on you baby  
Oh let me know where we going girl  
More and more youre in my world  
Ill tell you no lies I tell you the truth  
That Im hooked on you my baby  
Oh I feel your heartbeat is true  
And Im so In love with you  
Cant you feel the rhythm of love  
Baby cant you see just for me heaven above  
  
Im not guilty baby Im not guilty  
for the moonlight  
Tell me tell me baby that its your night  
Baby show me heaven again again  
Im not guilty baby Im not guilty  
for the moonlight  
Do you do you do you feel it tonight  
Oh I want to making good love to you  
  
Hey little baby are you alone  
Its not far far from my home  
Ill tell you no lies I tell you the truth  
That Im hooked on you my baby  
Are you ready to play this game  
I show your love its not the same  
Ill tell you no lies I tell you the truth  
That Im hooked on you my baby  
Oh I feel your heartbeat is true  
And Im so in love with you  
Cant you feel the rhythm of love  
Baby cant you see just for me heaven above
