Verse  
My mind runs away to you  
With a thought I hope youll see  
Cant see where its wandered to  
But I know where it wants to be  
  
PreChorus  
Im waiting patiently  
Though time is moving slow  
I have one vacancy  
And I wanted you to know  
  
Chorus  
That youre the one  
Designed for me  
A distant stranger  
That I will complete  
I know youre out there  
Were meant to be  
So keep your head down  
And make it to me  
Make it to me  
  
Verse  
So sick of this loneliness  
It seems such a waste of breath  
So much that I need to say  
So much to get off my chest  
  
PreChorus  
Im waiting patiently  
Though time is moving slow  
I have one vacancy  
And I wanted you to know  
  
Chorus  
That youre the one  
Designed for me  
A distant stranger  
That I will complete  
I know youre out there  
Were meant to be  
So keep your head down  
And make it to me  
Make it to me  
And make it to me  
Make it to me
