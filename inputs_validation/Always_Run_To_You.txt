The clock strikes ten  
Out on the streets again  
I been looking for something to please me since I dont know when  
Out on the dark side of town  
Another rumbles gone down  
And life on the high side isnt what this boys about  
  
Shes got something I want man its something I need  
It takes more than the night to satisfy me  
I stand accused  
That I can always run to you  
Any road that you choose  
I can always run to you  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
I run to you  
Baby I can always run  
  
To a heart of chrome  
And a soul of steel  
Weve done more white lines than youll know any one we could steal  
And when I give her the gun  
You know she feels so right  
And we dont let go when were alone when Im holding her so tight  
  
Shes got something I want man its something I need  
It takes more than the night to satisfy me  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
Any road that you choose  
I can always run to you  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
I run to you  
Baby I can always run  
  
And when the morning comes and I go to sleep  
When I close my eyes shes waiting for me  
I know that tonight shell satisfy me  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
Any road that you choose  
I can always run to you  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
I run to you  
Baby I can always run
