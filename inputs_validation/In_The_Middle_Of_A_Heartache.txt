Im in the middle of a heartache half out half in  
Not quite out of love with you not too much in love with him  
Im in the middle of a heartache half way half blue  
Cant give all my love to him when Im still in love with you  
Just when I think that Ive forgotten you the memry of your love grows dim  
That old pain starts again of wanting you more than I ever wanted him  
Im in the middle of a haertache heart old heart new  
Cant give all my love to him when Im still in love with you
