Without me  
Maybe youd find somebody else  
A little wiser  
With a lot more wealth  
And without you  
Its true Id be free  
To go chasing all my dreams  
Without any strings  
  
But I wouldnt want it any other way  
Having you to come home to at the end of every day  
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face  
Wouldnt want it any other way  
  
Hard times  
May never let up on us  
And maybe all well ever have  
Will barely be enough  
And babe you know  
How cold the wind can blow  
Loves never let us down  
When we needed it the most  
  
And I wouldnt want it any other way  
Having you to come home to at the end of every day  
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face  
Wouldnt want it any other way  
  
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face  
Wouldnt want it any other way  
Wouldnt want it any other way  
Any other way  
Oh girl  
You know I love you more each day  
Any other way
