Why am I here all alone  
Im gettin growing pains  
And Im feeling so old  
Im gettin tired  
Walkin in the rain sleepin in the sand  
Now life has taken its toll  
And now my sanitys gettin harder to hold  
Im kinda tired  
Walkin in the rain sleepin in the sand  
Now dont take advice from a stranger  
You cant live your life by what others do  
Were all here alive for a reason  
Youll never know  
Youll never know just what it means  
Youll never know just what it was  
Youll never know just what it means  
Youll never know just what it was  
How can I make it alone  
Its such a crazy world  
And Im feelin so stoned  
Im kinda tired  
Walkin in the rain sleepin in the sand  
Just sleepin in the sand  
You cant see the light from an angel  
You cant add the price of what others do  
Were all here alive for a reason  
Youll never know  
Youll never know just what it means  
Youll never know just what it was  
Youll never know just what it means  
Youll never know just what it was  
Youll never know just what it means  
Youll never know just what it was  
Youll never know just what it means  
Youll never know just what it was
