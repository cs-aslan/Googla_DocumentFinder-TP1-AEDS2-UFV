Tonights the night well make history Honey you and I  
And Ill take any risk to tie back the hands of time  
And stay with you here tonight with you tonight with you tonight  
  
I know you feel these are the worst of times I do believe its true  
When people lock their doors and hide inside  
Rumor has it its the end of Paradise  
  
But I know if the world just passed us by baby I know  
I wouldnt have to cry  
  
Chorus  
The best of times are when Im alone with you  
Some rain some shine well make this a world for two  
Our memories of yesterday will last a lifetime  
Well take the best forget the rest and some day well find  
  
These are the best of times  
These are the best of times  
  
The headlines read These Are The Worst Of Times I do believe its true  
I feel so helpless like a boat against the tide  
I wish the summer winds could bring back paradise  
  
But I know if the world turned upside down baby I know  
Youd always be around  
  
Chorus  
  
When Im alone with you you brighten up the night   
When Im alone with you
