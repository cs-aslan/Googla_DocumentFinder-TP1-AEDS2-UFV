Its 99 degrees and the temperature is creeping up  
I felt your foundation via great amount in moderate  
Ive almost got you there so let me take you all the way  
a taste is stimulating keep you hot like  
  
Chorus  
What take it till youre high and low  
Like how system overload  
Like who sure your wanna rock the boat  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
What rock you from the left to right  
Like how electro paradise  
Like who if you wanna up your line  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
Taste the infinity and mysteries surrounding you  
Erotic stereo its in the bass and trebble too  
Come hold your hands above your head and let them  
levitate  
And be hypnotic and the trip wont stop  
  
Chorus  
Like what take it till youre high and low  
Like how system overload  
Like who sure you wanna rock the boat  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
What rock you from the left to right  
Like how electro paradise  
Like who if you wanna up your line  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
need you more than enough  
ecstasy till your insane  
find adrenaline rush  
feel the power through your vains  
and hit you with the real thing  
  
bring it till youre high and low  
system overload  
  
Im gonna show you how Im rocking the boat  
rock you from the left to right  
electro paradise  
Im gonna hit you with the real thing  
  
Its 99 degrees and the temperature is creeping up  
I felt your foundation via great amount in moderate  
Come hold your hands above your head and let them  
levitate  
And be hypnotic and the trip wont stop  
  
Like what take it till youre high and low  
Like how system overload  
Like who sure you wanna rock the boat  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
What rock you from the left to right  
Like how electro paradise  
Like who if you wanna up your line  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
Like what take it till youre high and low  
Like how system overload  
Like who sure you wanna rock the boat  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
What rock you from the left to right  
Like how electro paradise  
Like who if you wanna up your line  
And hit you with the real thing
