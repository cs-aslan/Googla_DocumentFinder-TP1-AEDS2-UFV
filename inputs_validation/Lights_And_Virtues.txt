Heres to lights and virtues  
Heres to truths yet to be known  
Knowledge to light the darkness  
The search for things of your own  
  
Heres to lights and virtues  
Heres to reaching higher ground  
A life of hope and purpose  
Heres to strength yet to be found  
Honor though it goes unrecognized  
And truth though liars abound  
  
The pleasure of love and friendship  
The courage to be alone
