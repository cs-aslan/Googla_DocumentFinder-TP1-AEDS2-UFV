Lucy sells her flowers for a quarter apiece  
She wound up on the streets  
She could not pay her lease  
She used to want to save the world  
But nothing to her matters now  
She lays bout the subway station  
Clad in dirty tatters now  
  
Lucys in the subway with daffodils  
She lost all her diamonds  
And she sold all her pills  
Shes been around the block  
But shes had too many thrills  
Lucys in the subway with daffodils  
  
Lucy holds a dixie cup  
Of sixty cents in change  
And if she looks you in the eye  
You see that shes deranged  
She flew too near the sun  
And fried her fragile wings  
But to her faithful whisky bottle she clings  
  
Lucys in the subway with daffodils  
She lost all her diamonds  
And she sold all her pills  
Shes been around the block  
But shes had too many thrills  
Lucys in the subway with daffodils
