Everyone round keeps putting us down let it go  
Its the same old play in a grown up day  
Its a stinging sensation  
Hanging round on every corner  
Where all the young kids I know want to be  
  
We only want to stay young we only want to be free  
He doesnt want to be you she doesnt want to be me  
Were all young heroes  
Were all young heroes  
  
Shouted down pushed and were gettin real bushed  
Just have your say and well do it your way  
If it makes you fell better  
Nothing much to add to what I say  
cause I know just how it fells to be  
  
We only want to stay young we only want to be free  
He doesnt want to be you she doesnt want to be me  
Were all young heroes  
Were all young heroes  
  
We only want to be free
