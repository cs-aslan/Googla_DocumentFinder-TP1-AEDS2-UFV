Down in Mississippi where the sun beats down from the sky  
They give it up and they give it up and they give it up  
But they never ask why  
Daddy was a rollin rollin stone  
He rolled away one day and he never came home  
  
It aint hard to understand  
This aint Hitlers master plan  
What it takes to be a man  
In my mind in my brain  
I roll it over like a steamin freight train  
It aint hard to ascertain  
  
You only see what you want to believe  
When you light up in the back with those tricks up your sleeve  
That dont mean I cant hang  
But the day that I die  
Will be the day that I shut my mouth and put down my guitar  
Sunday morning hold church down at the bar  
Get down on your knees and start to pray  
Pray my itchy rash will go away  
  
Back up yall it aint me  
Kentucky Fried Chicken is all I see  
Its a hellified way to start your day  
If I make you cry all night  
Me and daddy gonna have a fist fight  
It aint personal it aint me  
  
I only hear what you told me to be  
Im a backwardass hillbilly  
Im Dick Butkiss  
You know I lie  
I get mean Im a thief in the dark  
Im a ragin machine  
Im a triple rectified ass son of a bitch  
Rectitetm on my ass and it makes me itch  
I can see for miles and miles and miles  
My broken heart makes me smile  
  
In my mind in my brain  
I go back and go completely insane  
It aint personal it aint me  
If I make you cry I might  
Be your daddy at the end of the night  
Take a load from my big gun  
  
You only see what you want to believe  
When you creep from the back  
I got tricks up my sleeve  
Twenty four seven the devils best friend  
It makes no difference  
Its all the same in the end
