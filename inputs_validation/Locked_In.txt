I cant stand the way you move it  
You drive me crazy with that walk  
You get me so excited  
I tremble and I shake  
When you make the moves you make  
  
Youve got the key  
The key to my heart  
Go ahead and use it  
Drag me in slam the door  
Then Ill be yours for evermore  
  
Youve got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
Youve got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
  
I cant take it when you touch me  
Feels so good I could explode  
Youve got me in a frenzy  
I tremble and I quake  
When you shake the things you shake  
  
Youve got the key  
The key to my heart  
Go ahead and use it  
Drag me in slam the door  
Then Ill be yours for evermore  
  
Youve got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
Youve got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
Locked in  
Locked inside your love  
Youve got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
  
Youve got the key  
The key to my heart  
Go ahead and use it  
Drag me in slam the door  
Then Ill be yours for evermore  
  
Youve got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
Youve got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
Youve got me locked in baby  
Locked inside your love  
Youve got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
  
Youve got me locked in baby  
Locked inside your love  
Youve got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
Youve got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
Youve got me locked in  
Locked inside your love
