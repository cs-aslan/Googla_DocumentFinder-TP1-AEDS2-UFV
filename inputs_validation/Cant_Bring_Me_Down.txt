My chick is driving me crazy  
She thinks that Im lazy  
Just because Im good at nothing all day  
  
My baby dont get it  
So my job I quit it  
Bust my ass  
Hell I barely get paid  
  
People like to put me down  
And just because I hang around  
Dont they understand its my way  
  
Chorus  
Everybody tries to break me  
Say they love me when they hate me  
Baby you just cant bring me down  
Ive seen long and lonely days  
And I have lost and found my ways  
So baby you just cant bring me down  
  
Yeah bring me down  
  
Baby Im leaving  
Youve got my heart bleeding  
So Im taking the easier way out  
  
The angel in my head  
Is now the devil in my bed  
If my walls could talk they would shout  
  
Baby you can talk and talk  
The hurt you caused it just dont stop  
I think Im going out of my brain  
  
Chorus  
  
I got a car it go fast  
Cute fuzzy dice up on the dash  
Got a bumper sticker just say peace  
Keep a gun under my seat  
To protect me from the pain  
Should your words get in my brain  
Cant you love me just the same  
Cant you love me just the  
  
Chorus
