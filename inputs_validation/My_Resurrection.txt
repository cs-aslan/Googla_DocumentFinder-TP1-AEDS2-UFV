Im back to life  
From the walking dead  
No more demons in my head  
Im sick of ugly lies  
Leave this ball and chain  
As the hatred dies so does pain  
  
My soul is free  
Ive got wind beneath my wings  
Yesterdays gone  
My heart sings  
  
Time to believe  
In the better part of me  
Tomorrow is here  
Awaiting  
  
My resurrection  
My resurrection  
  
One chain dont make no prison  
Two wrongs dont make a right  
I have never felt so alive
