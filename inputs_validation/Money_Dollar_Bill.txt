Dollar dollar bills  
Deutch marks franks yens and pounds  
I rock the jocked up sounds  
From Devenshire Downs  
  
Out the Fordham Road  
Up top in the boogie  
I be loyal to my peeps  
Like budha stud doogie  
  
Never very bad news  
Payin crazy dues  
Im blowin out crews  
And tamin mad shrews  
  
Like Bill Shakespeare  
The fakes will disappear  
The flavor in your ear  
Is strong like Everclear  
  
Two hundred proofs  
So put the match to the roof  
And set this bitch on fire  
Get rich the empires  
  
About to strike back  
If you rock the mic wack  
And thats the way it is cause yo  
Its like that  
  
Sadat X  
Money money yall  
It be the root of all evil  
  
Sadat X  
Money money yall  
It makes you popular with people  
I go back to the 80s  
Like three times a lady  
  
When it was pussy for free  
And crack for currency  
It just occurred to me  
Its time for surgery  
  
I remove MCs like tumors  
The lies and the rumors  
Got me thinkin of this dub  
By Timex Social Club  
  
Yo word to my momma  
Im high off the trauma  
Whitey Ford gets deeper than subway trains  
And I serve lazy fools like fast food chains  
  
All pain no gain  
Makes the brain insane  
Life in the fast laneT  
He flakes the cash gains for real  
  
Sadat X  
Dollar bill yall  
Dollar bill yall  
Dollar dollar dollar dollar dollar bill yall  
It takes money  
  
Sadat X  
To get that fly ass ho  
It takes money  
  
Sadat X  
To see me rock a live show  
It takes money  
  
Sadat X  
To get that last bag of smoke  
Cause they kindly take from it when that ass was broke  
Hey yo Im about to goff  
Just like my name was Edo  
  
Black kids call me whitey  
Spanish kids wetto  
White kids call me the king of this be boy thing  
If its broke then fix it  
  
If its wack remix it  
Cant none of you MCs ever fuck with these  
You be crazy on my dick  
Like some porno chick  
  
For the style that Im blessin  
Aint no second guessin  
Kid heed the lesson subtraction addition  
Reward for submissionA  
  
In to no debate  
Wont stop till Im eatin off a platinum plate  
I want the stocks and bonds  
Plus the real estate  
  
I want the iron gates  
And low interest rates  
Plus a fly little spot to bring all my dates  
A little stash of the cash put aside in a safe  
  
When times get lean  
Yall know what I mean  
  
Sadat X  
Money money yall  
Some be callin it cream  
  
Sadat X  
Money money yall  
Some be callin it fame  
  
Sadat X  
Money money yall  
But once I get it Im J  
  
I want cash and checks  
I want diamond rings  
I want jewels on my neck  
And mad fly things  
  
I want a stack of fat chips  
So I can take long trips  
I want to sail the Bahamas  
On my own cruise ships  
  
I want acres of land  
I want papers in hand  
I want stocks and bonds  
All pros no cons  
  
Hey if it smells funny  
Then back it up honey  
I want the money yall  
I need the money yall
