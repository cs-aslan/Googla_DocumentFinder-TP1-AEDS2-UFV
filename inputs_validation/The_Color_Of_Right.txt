I dont have an explanation  
For another lonely night  
I just feel this sense of mission  
And the sense of what is right  
  
Take it easy on my now  
Id be there if I could  
Im so full of what is right  
I cant see what is good  
  
Its a hopeless situation  
Lie awake for half the night  
Youre not sure whats going on here  
But youre sure it isnt right  
  
Make it easy on yourself  
Theres nothing more you can do  
Youre so full of what is right  
You cant see what is true  
  
A quality of justice  
A quantity of light  
A particle of mercy  
Makes the color of right  
  
Gravity and distance  
Change the passage of light  
Gravity and distance  
Change the color of right
