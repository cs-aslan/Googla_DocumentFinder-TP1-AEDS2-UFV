Thirdclass ticket in his pocket  
Punching out the shadows underneath the sockets  
Tweed coat turned up against the fog  
Slow coaches rolling oer the moor  
Between the very memory  
And approaches of war  
  
Stale bread curling on a luncheon counter  
Loose change lonely not the right amount  
Forgotten man of an indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebodys calling you again  
The sky is falling  
Jimmies standing in the rain  
  
Nobody wants to buy a counterfeited prairie lullaby in a colliery town  
The hip flask and fumbled skein of some stage door Josephine is all hell get
now  
Eyes going in and out of focus  
Mild and bitter from tuberculosis  
  
Forgotten man  
Indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebodys calling you again  
The sky is falling  
Jimmies standing in the rain  
  
Her soft breath was gentle on his neck  
If he could choose the time to die  
Then he would come and go like this  
Underneath a painted sky  
  
She woke up and called him Charlie by mistake  
And then in shame began to cry  
Tarnished silver band peels off a phrase  
And then warms their hands around the brazier  
  
Forgotten man  
Indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebodys calling you again  
Its finally dawning  
Jimmies standing in the rain  
  
Brilliantine glistening  
Your soft plaintive whistling  
And your wan wandering smile  
Died down at The Hippodrome  
Now youre walking off to jeers the lonely sound of jingling spurs  
The toodleoos and Oh my dears down at The Argyle  
  
Vile vaudevillians applaud sobriety  
Theres no place for a halfcut cowboy in polite society  
  
Forgotten man  
Indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebodys calling you again  
Its finally dawning  
Jimmies standing in the rain  
Somebodys calling you again  
Its finally dawning  
Jimmies standing in the rain
