On the road  
But I wont be gone for long  
Babe Im leavin you tomorrow  
On my way  
And you know you make me strong  
Ill be thinkin about you all night long  
Mama take just a little bit  
Mama take just a little bit  
Mama take just a little bit from my heart  
Mama shake just a little bit  
Mama brake just a little bit  
Mama take just a little bit from my heart  
All alone  
And Im feelin down today  
Wont let nothin come between us  
Say the words  
And the words are meant to say  
Ill be thinkin about you everyday  
Mama take just a little bit  
Mama take just a little bit  
Mama take just a little bit from my heart  
Mama shake just a little bit  
Mama brake just a little bit  
Mama take just a little bit from my heart  
From my heart  
I believe that we belong beyond a doubt  
If we have a change of heart  
We can always change our mind  
And I know well work it out  
I can see that its the only way to go  
Its the only chance I get  
Its the only way youll know  
That I love to love you  
Mighty love  
Gettin hard to find today  
I believe in you forever  
Say the words  
And the words are meant to say  
Ill be thinkin about you everyday  
Mama take just a little bit  
Mama take just a little bit  
Mama take just a little bit from my heart  
Mama shake just a little bit  
Mama brake just a little bit  
Mama take just a little bit from my heart  
Mama take just a little bit  
Mama take just a little bit  
Mama take just a little bit from my heart  
Mama shake just a little bit  
Mama brake just a little bit  
Mama take just a little bit from my heart  
Mama take just a little bit  
Mama take just a little bit  
Mama take just a little bit from my heart
