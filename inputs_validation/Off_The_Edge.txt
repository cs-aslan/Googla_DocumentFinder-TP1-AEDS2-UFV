Lately it seems the world is going crazy  
It wont be long till they replace me  
And nothing seems to faze me anymore  
  
I cant take it I get the feeling I wont make it  
Im feeling bad and I cant shake it  
And now Im living just to fake it whats more  
  
Which way is right Come with me  
Which way is wrong Come with me  
Which way is up Come with me  
Which way is down  
  
Crazy Im going crazy this worlds gone crazy  
Im falling off the edge  
  
Lately I wake each morning feeling beat  
And now theres panic in the street  
Someone keeps turning up the beat everywhere  
  
Every day Im like an actor on the stage  
Ill never let you see my rage  
Im not at peace out of my cage anywhere  
  
Which way is right Come with me  
Which way is wrong Come with me  
Which way is up Come with me  
Which way is down  
  
Crazy Im going crazy this worlds gone crazy  
Im falling off the edge  
Crazy Were going crazy this worlds gone crazy  
Were falling off the edge  
  
Lately I cant believe the things I see  
This ignorance and apathy  
Brings out the lunatic in me if you care  
  
It blows my mind when you sneak off into the night  
Maybe its better that you lie  
Just dont forget to say goodbye if you dare  
  
Crazy Im going crazy this worlds gone crazy  
Im falling off the edge  
Crazy Were going crazy this worlds gone crazy  
Were falling off the edge
