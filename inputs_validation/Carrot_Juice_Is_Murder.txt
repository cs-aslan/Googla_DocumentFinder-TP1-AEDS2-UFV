Listen up brothers and sisters come hear my desperate tale  
I speak of our friends of nature trapped in the dirt like a jail  
Vegetables live in oppression served on our tables each night  
This killing of veggies is madness I say we take up the fight  
Salads are only for murderers coleslaws a fascist regime  
Dont think that they dont have feelings just cause a radish cant scream  
  
Chorus  
Ive heard the screams of the vegetables scream scream scream  
Watching their skins being peeled having their insides revealed  
Grated and steamed with no mercy burning off calories  
How do you think that feels bet it hurts really bad  
Carrot juice constitutes murder and thats a real crime  
Greenhouses prisons for slaves let my vegetables go  
Its time to stop all this gardening its dirty as hell  
Lets call a spade a spade is a spade is a spade is a spade  
  
I saw a man eating celery so I beat him black and blue  
If he ever touches a sprout again Ill bite him clean in two  
Im a political prisoner trapped in a windowless cage  
Cause I stopped the slaughter of turnips by killing five men in a rage  
I told the judge when he sentenced me This is my finest hour  
Id kill those farmers again just to save one more cauliflower  
  
Chorus  
How low as people do we dare to stoop  
Making young broccolis bleed in the soup  
Untie your beans uncage your tomatoes  
Let potted plants free dont mash that potato  
Oh spare the spud Eat a cow instead  
  
Ive heard the screams of the vegetables scream scream scream  
Watching their skins being peeled fates in the stirfry are sealed  
Grated and steamed with no mercy you fat gourmet slob  
How do you think that feels leave them out in the field  
Carrot juice constitutes murder V8s genocide  
Greenhouses prisons for slaves yes your composts are graves  
Its time to stop all this gardening take up macrame  
Lets call a spade a spade  
is a spade is a spade is a spade is a spade  
  
Power to the peas Give peas a chance  
all we are saying is give peas a chance
