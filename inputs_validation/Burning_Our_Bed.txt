Baby dont you shed a tear for me  
I wouldnt want to waste your time  
You talked a lot of trash and ya lied to me  
But babe you never even tried  
  
Oh oh oh  
You can hold my heart for ransom  
But youll never own my soul  
  
CHORUS  
Baby I might lose my mind  
Maybe I might lose my head  
But one thing Ill never do  
Is swallow my pride crawlin back to you  
Baby Im burning our bed  
  
There used to be a time when you were everything  
My flame through the night  
You got me hot  
Then you blew me out  
Like this match Im about to light  
  
Oh oh oh  
You can tear my heart to pieces  
Left me standing in the cold  
  
Baby I might lose my mind  
Maybe I might lose my head  
One thing I gotta do  
Is torch those sheets and pillows too  
Baby Im burning out bed  
  
Well I used to think your were so kind  
How could I be so blind  
  
Oh oh oh  
Im free  
But Im alone  
  
Baby I might lose my mind  
Maybe I might lose my head  
But one thing I swear to you  
Is youre gonna feel the heat before the night is through  
  
Baby youre burning me  
Sometimes a man can bleed  
Baby Im burning our bed  
  
Baby I might lose my mind  
Maybe I might lose my head  
But one thing Ill never do  
Is swallow my pride crawlin back to you  
Baby Im burning our bed
