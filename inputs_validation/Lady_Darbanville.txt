My Lady dArbanville why do you sleep so still  
Ill wake you tomorrow  
And you will be my fill yes you will be my fill  
  
My Lady dArbanville why does it grieve me so  
But your heart seems so silent  
Why do you breathe so low why do you breathe so low  
  
My Lady dArbanville why do you sleep so still  
Ill wake you tomorrow  
And you will be my fill yes you will be my fill  
  
My Lady dArbanville you look so cold tonight  
Your lips feel like winter  
Your skin has turned to white your skin has turned to white  
  
My Lady dArbanville why do you sleep so still  
Ill wake you tomorrow  
And you will be my fill yes you will be my fill  
  
La la la la la  
  
My Lady dArbanville why does it grieve me so  
But your heart seems so silent  
Why do you breathe so low why do you breathe so low  
  
I loved you my lady though in your grave you lie  
Ill always be with you  
This rose will never die this rose will never die  
  
I loved you my lady though in your grave you lie  
Ill always be with you  
This rose will never die this rose will never die
