Yes I am blind  
No I cant see  
The good things  
Just the bad things oh  
  
Yes I am blind  
No I cant see  
There must be something  
Horribly wrong with me  
  
God come down  
If youre really there  
Well youre the one who claims to care  
  
Loves young dream  
Im the one who shopped you  
Im the one who stopped you  
Cause in my sorry way I love you  
Loves young dream  
Are you sorry  
For what youve done  
Well youre not the only one  
And in my sorry way I love you  
  
Yes I am blind  
But I do see  
Evil people prosper  
Over the likes of you and me  
Always  
  
God come down  
If youre really there  
Well youre the one who claims to care  
  
Little lamb  
On a hill  
Run fast if you can  
Good Christians they want to kill you  
And your life has not even begun   
Youre just like me youre just like me  
Oh your life has not even begun   
Youre just like me youre just like me  
And your life has not even begun   
Youre just like me just like me  
And your life has not even begun   
Youre just like me youre just like just like me  
And your life has not even begun
