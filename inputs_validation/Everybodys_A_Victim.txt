Everybodys a victim  
Seems were going that way  
Everybodys a victim  
Were becoming like the USA  
Everybodys a victim  
Seems were going that way  
Everybodys a victim  
Were becoming like the USA  
  
I demand recompense  
For sitting on the fence  
Throughout my adult life  
Youve got to put my parents in jail  
For raising me in Fife  
It doesnt matter what I do  
You have to say its alright  
And I need you to send somebody around  
To tuck me in at night  
Because  
  
Everybodys a victim  
Seems were going that way  
Everybodys a victim  
Were becoming like the USA  
  
Well its not my fault  
That Im positive  
I just stuck a needle in my arm  
And nobody told me  
That sixty a day  
Would do me any harm  
My livers shriveling like a leaf  
But its not the whiskey that dos it  
Call me irresponsible  
And Im really going to lose it  
Because  
  
Everybodys a victim  
Seems were going that way  
Everybodys a victim  
Were becoming like the USA  
  
Wear a ribbon for this  
Hug a stranger for that  
Light a candle to the dead  
And soon youll forget  
That you ever had  
A brain inside our head  
We value everythin the same  
We turn it into farce  
So we dont know a crisis  
Till it kicks us up the are  
Because  
  
Everybodys a victim  
Seems were going that way  
Everybodys a victim  
Were becoming like the USA  
Everybodys a victim  
Seems were going that way  
Everybodys a victim  
Were becoming like the USA  
Everybodys a victim  
Seems were going that way  
Everybodys a victim  
Were becoming like the USA
