Through the darkness  
I can see your light  
And you will always shine  
And I can feel your heart in mine  
Your face Ive memorized  
Ive idolized just you  
  
I look up to everything you are  
In my eyes you do no wrong  
Ive loved you for so long  
And after all is said and done  
Youre still you  
After all youre still you  
  
You walk past me  
I can feel your pain  
Time changes everything  
One truth always stays the same  
Youre still you  
After all youre still you  
  
I look up to everything you are  
In my eyes you do no wrong  
And I believe in you  
Although you never asked me to  
I will remember you and what life put you through  
And in this cruel land  
The only world Ive found without hope  
Youre still you  
After all youre still you
