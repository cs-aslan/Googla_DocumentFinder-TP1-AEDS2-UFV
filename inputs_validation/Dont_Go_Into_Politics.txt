George Washington was the president  
But now hes dead dead  
Mackenzie King was Prime Minister  
But now hes dead dead  
  
So dont go into politics  
Youll end up dead  
Dont go into politics  
Youll end up dead  
  
Oppenheimer built the bomb  
But now hes dead dead  
Einstien was very very smart  
But not enough not to be dead dead  
  
So dont go into science  
Youll end up dead  
Dont go into science  
Youll end up dead  
And dont go into politics  
Youll end up dead  
Dont go into politics  
Youll end up dead  
  
Jimi Hendrix Janice Joplin Brian Jones Keith Moon  
Jim Morrison Roy Orbison  
John Lennon Bob Marley Leonard Bernstien Elvis Presley  
Well were not too sure about Elvis  
But I think you get the point  
  
Dont go into music  
Youll end up dead  
Dont go into music  
Youll end up dead  
And dont go into science  
Youll end up dead  
Dont go into politics  
Youll end up dead  
  
Break it down  
Youll be burned youll be fried  
Youll be buried alive  
And theres no hope thinkin  
That youre gonna survive  
Cause theres the drowning and choking  
And cancer from smoking  
And smothered while sleeping  
And blood will start seeping  
  
So I have found youll end up in the ground  
And youll be dead  
So I have found youll end up in the ground  
I wish there was an option instead  
But youll be dead  
Dead  
Maybe with a bullet in your head  
But youll be dead  
Dead  
Very very very very very very very very dead
