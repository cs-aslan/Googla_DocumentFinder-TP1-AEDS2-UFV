The minute youre gone I cry the minute youre gone I die  
Before you walked out of sight Im like a child all alone at night  
I stare into emptiness Im filled with such loneliness  
My world goes from right to wrong the minute youre gone  
The minute youre gone I see just how lonely Im gonna be  
My life would be oh so blue if I couldnt be with you  
The minute youre gone I pray the minute youre gone I say  
Please dont stay away too long the minute youre gone  
  
The minute youre gone I pray the minute youre gone I say  
Please dont stay away too long the minute youre gone
