This is a mercy mission  
From a faceless messenger who dont want to see you hit  
Heres the word listen to it  
Somebody that you used to know is back in town  
You better go  
  
This is a mercy mission  
A voice youll never hear again from a southside call box  
Winged demons are the hardest to outfox  
The same one you lost on the run  
Gonna show you that it aint no fun  
  
You better get out of town youre gonna get hit  
I didnt mean to get you  
  
This is a mercy mission  
Youll find your schedule underneath the door  
All of the arrangements have been made  
Major expenses have been paid as you know  
Dont forget the last details  
Accept no parcels in the mail
