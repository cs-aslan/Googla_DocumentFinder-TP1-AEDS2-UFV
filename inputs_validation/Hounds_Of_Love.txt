Its in the trees  
Its coming  
  
When I was a child  
Running in the night  
Afraid of what might be  
  
Hiding in the dark  
Hiding in the street  
And of what was following me  
  
Now hounds of love are hunting  
Ive always been a coward  
And I dont know whats good for me  
  
Here I go  
Its coming for me through the trees  
Help me someone  
Help me please  
  
Take my shoes off  
And throw them in the lake  
And Ill be  
Two steps on the water  
  
I found a fox  
Caught by dogs  
He let me take him in my hands  
  
His little heart  
It beats so fast  
And Im ashamed of running away  
  
From nothing real  
I just cant deal with this  
But Im still afraid to be there  
  
Among your hounds of love  
And feel your arms surround me  
Ive always been a coward  
And never know whats good for me  
  
Oh here I go  
Dont let me go  
Hold me down  
Its coming for me through the trees  
Help me darling  
Help me please  
  
Take my shoes off  
And throw them in the lake  
And Ill be  
Two steps on the water  
  
I dont know whats good for me  
I dont know whats good for me  
I need your love love love love love yeah  
Your love  
  
Take your shoes off  
And throw them in the lake  
  
Do you know what I really need  
Do you know what I really need  
I need love love love love love yeah
