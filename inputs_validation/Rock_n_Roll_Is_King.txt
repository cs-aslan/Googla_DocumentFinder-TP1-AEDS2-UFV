Listen everybody let me tell you bout the rock n roll  
Feel that rhythm and its really gonna thrill your soul  
She said come along with me to a land of make believe  
She said rock n roll is king  
  
She loves that rock n roll and she plays it all night long  
Thats all she ever tells me when I call her on the telephone  
She says feel that jumpin beat and git up on your feet  
She says rock n roll is king  
  
Oh let those guitars play  
Play for me play for me  
Oh let that song ring out  
Thats how its meant to be  
  
It rolls like a train thats comin on down the track  
She rolled over Beethoven and she gave Tchaikovsky back  
She loves that drivin beat she goes dancin on down the street  
She said rock n roll is king  
  
Oh let those guitars play  
Play for me play for me  
Oh let that song ring out  
Thats how its meant to be  
  
When she comes around and Im listenin to the radio  
She says you cant do that cause all I wanna do is rock n roll  
Now here Im gonna stay where that music starts to play  
She says rock n roll is king
