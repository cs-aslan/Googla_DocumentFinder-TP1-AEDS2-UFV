He was born so far away  
So the storys told  
We remember Christmas Day  
When winter days grow cold  
  
With the time it passes by  
We put away the trim  
Then we live and wonder why  
We cant remember Him  
  
The Christmas star shines once a year  
And then it fades away  
Keep the spirit in your heart  
Its Christmas everyday christmas everyday  
  
Its not the bells and its not the snow  
And its not the gifts we get  
But He was born so long ago  
Its easy to forget  
  
Peace on earth good will too men  
But men cant go alone  
We get lost along the way  
But He can bring us home  
  
Remember Him throughout the year  
Without the star above  
He left us all a Christmas gift  
He left the gift of love  
  
The Christmas star shines once a year  
And then it fades away  
Keep the spirit in your heart  
And its Christmas every day
