Now it looks to me like the same old place  
In the sky it looks like rain  
The same old town with the same old streets  
The address has not change  
You can find me there  
With the door shut tight  
And the one wish that remains  
  
Baby step back baby step back  
Either step up or step back  
  
No you know I dont write no bad checks  
I have no wish to repent  
Ive seen a few  
But whatever I do  
I dont cause no accidents  
Whiskey and wine help me pass the time  
I dont leave no evidence  
  
Baby step back baby step back  
Either step up or step back  
Baby step back baby step back  
Either step up or step back  
  
Still I dont kneel down  
I was born to fight  
So youd best leave me alone  
Maybe Ill get much more than I need  
Or much less than I should own  
Last of all let me say it again  
Either step up or step on  
  
Baby step back baby step back  
Either step up or step back  
Baby step back baby step back  
Either step up or step back  
  
Baby walk back baby walk back  
Either walk on or walk back  
Baby step back
