Enter Madam X painted in a shocking pink spangled dress  
Her teeth are perfect but her mouth is loose  
Rubbing their hands together she persuades them that its better to confess  
Which unpleasant fate theyd like to choose  
  
Chorus  
Every step might be your last  
Money signs are in your eyes sucker  
Youve been taken in this time  
You might just get out alive if youre lucky  
All the vultures tuning in to Glitter Gulch  
Are looking in on you  
And theyre hungry  
  
He stood five feet tall in his elevator shoes and stovepipe hat  
He was known by several different names  
Prompted by Madam X he answered all their questions  
And then after that he said Im sick and tired of stupid games  
  
Chorus  
  
Weve got prizes if you can afford  
Some small humiliation before you get your reward  
And Id rather be an outlaw than an inlaw to you  
And to live my life in miserable poverty  
Than to have to grovel to have some dream home hovel  
So watch me while I get away with prime time robbery  
  
As he enters Madam X he things of red raged faces and the sweet greenbacks  
He climbed upon his honey and he covered her with money  
As they do their victory dance  
He thinks I hope they choke upon their laughter tracks  
They can all go straight to hell while we howl down the whole hotel
