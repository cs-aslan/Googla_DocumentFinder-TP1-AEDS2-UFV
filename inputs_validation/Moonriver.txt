Moon river  
Wider than a mile  
Ill be crossing you in style  
Someday  
  
Oh dream maker  
You heartbreaker  
Wherever youre going  
Im going your way  
  
Two drifters  
Off to see the world  
Im not so sure the world  
Deserves us  
  
Were after  
The same rainbows end  
How come its just around the bend   
Its always just around the bend   
  
Moon river  
Wider than a mile  
Ill be crossing you in style  
Someday  
  
Oh dream maker  
You heartbreaker  
Wherever youre going  
Im going your way  
  
Two drifters  
Off to see the world  
Im not so sure the world  
Deserves us  
  
Were after  
The same rainbows end  
Its just around the bend  
Its just around the bend  
Its just around the bend  
Its just around the bend  
  
Oh
