Makin a livin the old hard way  
Takin and givin by day by day  
I dig snow and rain and the bright sunshine  
Draggin The Line  
  
My dog Sam eats purple flowers  
Aint got much but what we gots ours  
We dig snow and rain and the bright sunshine  
Draggin The Line  
Draggin The Line  
Draggin The Line  
Draggin The Line  
  
I feel fine Im talkin bout peace of mind  
Im gonna take my time Im gettin the good sign  
Draggin The Line  
Draggin The Line  
Draggin The Line  
Draggin The Line  
  
Lovin the free and feelin spirit of  
Hugging a tree  
When you get near it  
Diggin snow and rain and the bright sunshine  
Draggin The Line  
Draggin The Line  
Draggin The Line  
Draggin The Line
