I will answer the wind  
I will leave with the tide  
Ill be out on the road  
Every chance I can ride  
  
No matter how far  
No matter how free  
Ill be alone  
If youll wait for me  
  
Therell be times when Ill rise  
Therell be times when Ill fall  
Therell be times when its best to say nothing at all  
  
Knowing youre right  
Letting it be  
Ill be around  
If youll wait for me  
If youll wait for me  
  
And Ill fight for the right to go over the hill  
If itll only mean something to me  
I will not be persuaded  
I wont be still  
Ill find a way to be free  
  
In the cool of the night  
In the heat of the day  
If youre ever in doubt  
Ill be on my way  
Straight to your side  
I guarantee  
Ill be around  
If youll wait for me  
If youll wait for me
