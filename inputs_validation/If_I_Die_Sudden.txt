If I die sudden  
Please dont tell anyone  
There aint nobody that needs to know  
That Im gone  
Just put me in a pine box  
Six feet underground  
Dont be calling no minister  
I dont need one around  
  
Well my grandma she told me  
Shed be waiting at the gate  
She said that the fix was in  
And that shes already prayed  
And the rest of my family  
Will be waiting there for me too  
Theyd already taken care of my sins  
And theres was nothing for me to do  
  
Chorus  
So If I die sudden  
Please dont tell anyone  
There aint nobody that needs to know  
That Im gone  
Just put me in a pine box  
Six feet underground  
Dont be calling no minister  
I dont need one around  
I dont need no preacher around  
  
I got a little bit of money  
Some papers you might want to see  
I got a house down in Georgia  
But lets keep this brief  
Im not afraid of dying  
This lifes been right to me  
I got a whole bunch more than I deserve  
And now I will be free  
Yeah now I will be free  
  
Chorus
