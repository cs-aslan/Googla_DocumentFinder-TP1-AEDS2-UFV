Im scared of opening the can  
Scared of changing who I am  
Mightve taken all I can  
Im scared of everything I am  
  
Are you a natural woman  
I know Ive got it comin  
The scent in the air  
And the water running  
  
The damage  
She said shes not telling it today  
She said Come back when youre alone  
Come back when youre alone  
The damage The damage  
The damage The damage  
The damn damn dam damage  
  
Are you a natural woman  
I know Ive got it comin  
Dissent in the air  
And the water running  
  
Dont give me whats in the window babe  
I want the stuff you think would never sell  
Whatcha have under the counter on the bottom shelf  
Ill buy the lowdown deepdown primal truthful self  
  
I let the genie out of the box  
I let the genie out of the box  
  
Are you a natural woman  
I know Ive got it comin  
The scent in the air  
And the water running  
  
Are you a natural woman  
Tell me youre the milliontoone  
Are you a natural woman  
Are you a natural woman  
Im a natural man
