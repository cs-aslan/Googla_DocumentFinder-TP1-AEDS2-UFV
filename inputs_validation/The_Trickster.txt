Rust in the mountains  
Rust in the brain  
The air is sacred here  
In spite of your claim  
Up on the roof tops  
Out of reach  
Trickster is meaningless  
Trickster is weak  
Hes talking out the world  
Talking out the world  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
This is only halfway  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
This is only halfway  
  
I wanted you so bad  
And I couldnt say  
All things fall apart  
We wanted out so bad  
We couldnt say  
These things fall apart  
Were talking out the world  
Talking out the world  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
This is only halfway  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
This is only halfway  
  
Truant kids a can of brick dust worms  
Who do not want to climb down from  
Their chestnut tree  
Long white gloves  
Police tread carefully  
Escaped from the zoo  
The perfect child facsimile  
Its talking out the world  
Talking out the world
