Now when youre feelin low  
And the fish wont bite  
You need a little bit o soul  
To put you right  
You gotta make like you  
Want to kneel and pray  
And then a little bit o soul  
Will come your way  
  
Now when your girl has gone  
And youre broke in two  
You need a little bit o soul  
To see you through  
And when you raise the roof  
With you rock and roll  
Youll get a lot more kicks  
With a little bit o soul  
  
And if your party falls  
Cause theres nobody groovin  
A little bit o soul and  
It really starts movin yeah  
  
Now when youre in a mess  
And you feel like cryin  
Just remember this little  
Song of mine  
And as you walk through life  
Tryin to reach your goal  
Remember what I say bout  
A little bit o soul  
  
And if your party falls  
Cause theres nobody groovin  
A little bit o soul and  
It really starts movin yeah  
A little bit o soul  
A little bit o soul  
A little bit o soul
