Why does she even obsess about her life with me  
Shes like I dont need you Just let me be  
Why doesnt she ever care me you see  
Well Im done with her and shes done with me  
  
You know I thought of her as my love  
And I miss her now that shes gone  
Even though Im writing this song  
Shes not there any more  
Oh shes not there any more  
  
What does she want from me  
I guess its hard to see  
Everything she does  
I dont why shed fuss  
What does she want from me  
Dont wanna let her be  
Why is she so obsessed  
She cant avoid her stress  
  
Whoa Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 2x  
  
Flashback we were nice and cuddly then  
But then you broke my heart and let go of my hand  
Didnt this of this relationship to end like this  
You could have just gave me a hug or kiss on the cheek  
  
You know I thought of her as my love  
And I miss her now that shes gone  
Even though Im writing this song  
Shes not there any more  
Oh shes not there any more  
  
What does she want from me  
I guess its hard to see  
Everything she does  
I dont why shed fuss  
What does she want from me  
Dont wanna let her be  
Why is she so obsessed  
She cant avoid her stress  
  
Whoa Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 4x  
  
Hey  
What do you say  
That girl is never coming back today  
Hey  
What do you say  
She never wants to see me anyway  
  
You know I thought of her as my love  
And I miss her now that shes gone  
Even though Im writing this song  
Shes not there any more  
Oh shes not there any more  
  
What does she want from me  
I guess its hard to see  
Everything she does  
I dont why shed fuss  
What does she want from me  
Dont wanna let her be  
Why is she so obsessed  
She cant avoid her stress 2x  
  
Whoa Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Repeat until end  
What does she want
