I waited for a girl like you  
  
The light shines  
Its getting hot on my shoulder  
I dont mind  
This time it doesnt matter  
Cause your friends  
They look good and you look better  
  
Dont you know all night Ive been waiting for a girl like you to come around
round round  
  
Under the lights tonight  
You turned around and you stole my heart  
With just one look when I saw your face  
I fell in love  
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight  
With just one look yeah  
I waited for a girl like you  
  
Im weaker  
My worlds fall and they hit the ground  
Oh life come on head dont you fail me now  
I start to say  
I think I love you but I make no sound  
  
You know cause all my life Ive been waiting for a girl like you to come
around  
  
Under the lights tonight  
You turned around and you stole my heart  
With just one look when I saw your face  
I fell in love  
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight  
With just one look yeah  
I waited for a girl like you  
  
There is no other place that I would rather be  
Than right here with you tonight  
As we lay on the ground I put my arms around you  
And we can stay here tonight  
Cause theres so much that I wanna say I wanna say  
  
Under the lights tonight  
You turned around and you stole my heart  
With just one look when I saw your face  
I fell in love  
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight  
  
Under the lights tonight  
You turned around and you stole my heart  
With just one look when I saw your face  
I fell in love  
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight  
  
With just one look yeah  
I waited for a girl like you  
I waited for a girl like you
