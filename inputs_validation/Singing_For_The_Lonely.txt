Singing for the lonely  
Youre not the only ones who feel this  
So scared of what were doing  
All the time  
  
Here comes wasted headspace  
Paranoia  
Anger misplaced feelings  
Leave me nowhere  
All the time  
  
I dont wake up early in the morning  
Cause the more I sleep the the less I have to say  
Scared of you always thinking that Im boring  
Stop me yawning my life away  
  
Tender young confusion  
Send black mariah for blue delusions  
Lays heavy oh so heavy  
On my mind  
  
Im so sick of peoples expectations  
Leaves me tired all the time  
If your homes full of useless aggravation  
Then dont bring it to mine  
  
I seem to spend my life  
Just waiting for the chorus  
Cause the verse is never nearly  
Good enough  
  
The hooligan half of me  
That steals from Woolworths  
While the other lives for love  
  
Im so sick of peoples expectations  
Leaves me tired all the time  
If your homes full of worthless aggravation  
Then dont bring it to mine  
  
Singing for the lonely  
Were not the only ones who feel this  
So scared of what Im doing  
All the time  
  
Singing for the Lonely  
Were not the only ones who feel this  
Scared of what were doing  
All the time
