This Old Man  
He worked for thirty years with  
Two strong hands in the factory light his  
Lunch box held all his needs with  
Coffee sandwiches and dreams  
For Me  
  
This Old Man  
He taught me many times  
To undertand that showing love is simply  
Nothing you should have o hide  
Dont keep your feelings locked inside  
He said  
  
When I was young  
I dreamed a young mans dreams  
I saw in you reyes  
The things Id never seen  
But now I grow old  
But I dont really mind  
Cause cant you see with my family  
Well share these timeless memories
