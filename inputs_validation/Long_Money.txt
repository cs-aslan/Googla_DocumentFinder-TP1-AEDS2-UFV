Chorus  
Jacuzzi on the roof ugly hoes dont get the time of day  
Cheifin on sativa smell the reefa from a mile away  
Pistol in my coupe try my troops youll get blown away  
Gucci Mane got long money bitch thats all I gots to say  
Gucci Mane got long money thats what them bitches say x3  
I aint even gotta talk my money conversates  
  
Verse 1  
Bitches think I got a money tree I drown the bitch with money  
Ferrari with them bumble bees Four Giovanna sittin up under it  
How many karats in that bracelet baby I think about 200  
Plus I hit the club with 50k lets keep this shit 100  
I got a couple houses several spouses in my pent house smoking ounces  
Came up selling keys and ounce half a pound watch golden brown  
My pants sag grams weigh em down usta catch the train and go downtown  
Just to walk around and window shop now I shut the mall down in every town  
Everytime that I hit the scene fresher then I wanna be  
Cover of the magazines back of the limousines  
Stacks in my denim jeans hoes gon remember me  
Fo fifty eight ship to me from italy six 12 sittin outside the facilities  
911 Guccis ice game killing me  
Came along way from drug dealing waking up rich is a great feeling  
Couple mill stashed for my grandchildren  
Just hand counted me a coo half million  
Up on em pull up on em like a bird drop low and shit on em  
Pissed em spit on em Tell them haters Gucci got rich on em  
  
Chorus  
Jacuzzi on the roof ugly hoes dont get the time of day  
Cheifin on sativa smell the reefa from a mile away  
Pistol in my coupe try my troops youll get blown away  
Gucci Mane got long money bitch thats all I gots to say  
Gucci Mane got long money thats what them bitches say x3  
I aint even gotta talk my money conversates  
  
Verse 2  
Every city I make magic I make money disappear abra kadabra  
Cause its a tragedy how clear these diamonds blingin in my ear  
Its so many wanna marry me Im married to the game  
Cocaine put me in position swagga brought me outta frame  
I need accountants to help me count it Rolls Royce I mount it  
Corvette painted candy drop the top that bitch is crowning  
Houses in Zone 6 All my niggas Hustlas and robbers dont fuck with us  
Niggaz better off fucking with Angel Dust  
Im racked up like a pool table Stay draped up in Purple Label  
Drink purple drank smoke purple weed got a purple car and long paper  
Everyday thank the lord that I wake Everyday live it like its my last day  
Shine so bright rock stupid ice More karats in my chain then a carrot cake  
Money shout he running out Im bustin out cant close the vault  
Aint my fault its yo fault nobody stay here this my money house  
Stash house stocked up try fuck shit get chopped up  
Im rocked stay blocked up aint locked up but Im gwapped up  
  
Chorus  
Jacuzzi on the roof ugly hoes dont get the time of day  
Cheifin on sativa smell the reefa from a mile away  
Pistol in my coupe try my troops youll get blown away  
Gucci Mane got long money bitch thats all I gots to say  
Gucci Mane got long money thats what them bitches say x3  
I aint even gotta talk my money conversates

Jacuzzi on the roof ugly hoes dont get the time of day  
Cheifin on sativa smell the reefa from a mile away

Gucci Mane got long money bitch thats all I gots to say  
Gucci Mane got long money thats what them bitches say x3  
I aint even gotta talk my money conversates
