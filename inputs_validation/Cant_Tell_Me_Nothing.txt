La la la la  
Wait til I get my money right  
  
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven  
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace  
I told God Id be back in a second  
Man its so hard not to act reckless  
To whom much is given much is tested  
Get arrested guess until he get the message  
I feel the pressure under more scrutiny  
And whatd I do Act more stupidly  
Bought more jewelry More Louis V  
My mama couldnt get through to me  
The drama people suing me  
Im on TV talking like its just you and me  
Im just saying how I feel man  
I aint one of the Cosbys I aint go to Hillman  
I guess the money shouldve changed them  
I guess I shouldve forgot where I came from  
  
La la la la  
Wait til I get my money right  
La la la la  
Then you cant tell me nothing right  
Excuse me is you saying something  
Uh uh you cant tell me nothing  
You cant tell me nothing  
Uh uh you cant tell me nothing  
  
Let up the suicide doors  
This is my life homie you decide yours  
I know that Jesus died for us  
But I couldnt tell you who decide wars  
So I parallel doubleparked that motherfucker sideways  
Old folks talking bout back in my day  
But homie this is my day  
Class started two hours ago oh am I late  
No I already graduated  
And you can live through anything if Magic made it  
They say I talk with so much emphasis  
Ooh they so sensitive  
Dont ever fix your lips like collagen  
Then say something where you gon end up apologin  
Let me know if its a problem then  
Aight man holla then  
  
La la la la  
Wait til I get my money right  
La la la la  
Then you cant tell me nothing right  
Excuse me is you saying something  
Uh uh you cant tell me nothing  
You cant tell me nothing  
Uh uh you cant tell me nothing  
  
Let the champagne splash  
Let that man get cash let that man get past  
You dont need to stop to get gas  
If he can move through the rumors he can drive off fumes  
Cause how he move in a room full of Nos  
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes  
Must be the pharoahs he in tune with his soul  
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold  
Treasure whats you pleasure  
Life is a uh depending how you dress her  
So if the devil wear prada Adam Eve wear nada  
Im in between but way more fresher  
But way less effort cause when you try hard  
Thats when you die hard  
Yall homies lookin like Why God  
When they reminisce over you my God  
  
La la la la  
Wait til I get my money right  
La la la la  
Then you cant tell me nothing right  
Excuse me is you saying something  
Uh uh you cant tell me nothing  
You cant tell me nothing  
Uh uh you cant tell me nothing  
  
La la la la  
Wait til I get my money right  
La la la la  
Then you cant tell me nothing right
