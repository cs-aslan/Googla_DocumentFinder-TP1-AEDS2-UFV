She was the keeper of all my reason  
Possessor of all I owned  
She kept me on the edge of darkness  
With words as cold as stone  
Then you came along  
Your eyes were flashing with desire  
Oh babe you got me burning so much  
You got my soul on fire  
  
Honey you move me  
You got me so I cant sleep at night  
You tell me you believe in me  
And you say youre gonna treat me right  
  
You gave me the answer  
I knew right from the start  
Im gonna tell you holy roller  
They say that loves a gamble  
But I got the Queen of Hearts  
  
If I could touch the crystal silence  
That we have after making love  
Just to tell you I need you here  
In the glow of the stars above  
  
If you ever leave or deceive  
Or fool around  
You could be right  
You could be wrong  
But woman I know Ill miss you  
When youre gone  
  
Honey you move me  
Like the wind thro a willow tree  
Aint no doubt about it baby  
You make the blind man see  
  
You gave me the answer  
I knew right from the start  
Im gonna tell you holy Roller  
They say that loves a gamble  
But I got the Queen of Hearts  
  
You drive me crazy when you walk  
Crazy when you talk  
Crazy when you walk with me  
  
You gave me the answer  
I knew right from the start  
Im gonna tell you holy roller  
Gonna tell you holy roller  
Youre the Queen of Hearts  
  
You gave me the answer  
I knew right from the start  
Im gonna tell you holy roller  
Youre the Queen of Hearts
