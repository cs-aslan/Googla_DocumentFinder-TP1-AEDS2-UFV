Dont take her for granted  
She had a hard time  
Dont misunderstand her  
Or play with her mind  
Treat her so gently  
It will pay you in time  
Youve gotta know  
Shes the sensitive kind  
  
Tell her you love her each and every night  
You will discover she will treat you right  
If you believe I know you will find  
There aint nothin like the sensitive kind  
  
She gets so lonely waitin for you  
You are the only thing to help her through  
Dont take her for granted  
She has a hard time  
You got to know shes the sensitive kind  
You got to know shes the sensitive kind
