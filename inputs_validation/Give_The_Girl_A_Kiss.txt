I aint lookin for just excitement  
Baby thats just a fact  
If you want to get to her heart  
You better let her know just where youre at  
  
Chorus  
It aint written in the sky above  
No fortuneteller told me this  
You gotta tell her that you love her  
Tell her that you need her  
And give the girl a great big kiss  
Give the girl a great big kiss  
  
Now if youre such a fool you think  
It dont matter baby what you say  
maybe you better tell her how youre feelin  
It aint gonna happen any other way  
  
Chorus  
  
Now baby all I want to do  
Is darlin make sweet love to you  
  
Now I dont know what the meanin is  
Why you want to hide the things you feel and say  
But baby its just a natural fact  
Love was never meant to be that way  
  
Chorus  
  
Now baby all I want to do  
Is darlin make sweet love to you
