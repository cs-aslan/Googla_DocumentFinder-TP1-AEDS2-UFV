Behind the sun  I found some one  my china woman oh no  
Shes painting clouds  day in day out  my china girl dont go  
Oh I cant oh I cant oh I cant ignore  
The way she looks to me  
Oh I cant  oh I cant  oh I cant give her more  
Just my heart she is my destiny  
  
She has China in her eyes  cant you see it  
China in her eyes  cant you feel it  
China in her eyes  a secret smile  
Oh cant you see its you and me  my china woman oh no  
I miss you so cant let you go  my china girl  dont go  
  
Behind brown eyes shes mystify  my china woman oh no  
Its like a dream the moon turns green  my china girl dont go  
I believe I believe I believe Ill fly  
Im writing hearts to you  
And I wait and I wait see a rose in the sky  
Take my heart what have I got to do
