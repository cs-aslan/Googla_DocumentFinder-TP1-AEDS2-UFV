Well Im standing here looking at you  
What do I see  
Im looking straight through  
Its so sad  
When youre young  
To be told  
Youre having fun  
  
So unplug the jukebox  
And do us all a favour  
That musics lost its taste  
So try another flavour   
ant music ant music  
ant music ant music  
  
Well Im standing here what do I see  
A big nothing  
Threatening me  
Its so sad  
When youre young  
To be told  
Youre having fun  
  
So unplug the jukebox  
And do us all a favour  
That musics lost its taste  
So try another flavour   
ant music ant music  
ant music ant music  
  
So unplug the jukebox  
And do us all a favour  
That musics lost its taste  
So try another flavour   
ant music ant music  
ant music ant music  
  
Dont tread on an ant hes done nothing to you  
There might come a day  
When hes treading on you  
Dont tread on an ant youll end up black and blue  
You cut off his head  
Legs come looking for you  
  
So unplug the jukebox  
And do us all a favour  
That musics lost its taste  
So try another flavour   
ant music ant music  
ant music ant music  
  
So unplug the jukebox  
And do us all a favour  
That musics lost its taste  
So try another flavour   
ant music ant music  
ant music ant music  
ant music ant music
