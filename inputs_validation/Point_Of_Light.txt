There is a point when you cannot walk away  
When you have to stand up straight and tall  
And mean the words you say  
There is a point you must beside  
Just to do it cause its right  
Thats when you become a point of light  
  
There is a darkness that everyone must face  
It wants to take whats good and fair  
And lay it all to waste  
And that darkness  
Covers everything inside  
Until it meets a single point of light  
  
All it takes  
Is a point of light  
A ray of hope  
In the darkest night  
If you see whats wrong  
And you try to make it right  
You will be a point of light  
  
There are heroes  
Whose names we never hear  
A dedicated army of quiet volunteers  
Reaching out to feed the hungry  
Reaching out to save the land  
Reaching out to help their fellow men  
  
There are dreamers  
Who are making dreams come true  
Taking time to teach the children  
Theres nothing they cant do  
Giving shelter to the homeless  
Giving hope to those without  
Isnt that what this land all about  
  
One by one from the mountains to the sea  
Points of light are calling out to you and me  
  
All it takes  
Is a point of light  
A ray of hope  
In the darkest night  
If you see whats wrong  
And you try to make it right  
You will see a point of light  
  
If you see whats wrong  
And you try to make it right  
You will be  
A point of light
