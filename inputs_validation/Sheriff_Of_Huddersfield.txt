Iron Maiden  
  
Life in a city living in L A  
Is a long way from Huddersfield town  
The back of the Rainbows a long way from heaven  
But thats where he gets his pork pie  
Limos and ladies theyre driving him queasy  
Rugby and crickets unknown  
Baseball and football theyre making him lazy  
Your fan club says Rodney come home  
  
Chorus  
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle  
Look down on Hollywood Hills  
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle  
Youre our own Hot Rod on wheels  
  
A good game of arrows a few dozen barrels  
The Nautilus rusts in the yard  
But for Yorkshire hes yearning but because hes earning  
Hell always live in L A  
A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket  
And never comes out to pay bills  
Hes winning at poker and playing the Joker  
And he always cheats when he deals  
  
repeat chorus  
  
Rodneys rap  
Hello let me introduce meself  
My name is Rodney Im immensely strong  
When I were a lad I could lift up five  
Navies on an end of a shovel  
The reason I never took martial arts because  
I was immensely fearsome and  
Id probably kill everybody  
I came into contact with it  
I was phenomenally strong  
Pride and ego my lads pride and ego  
Is what makes the world rotate  
And everybody knows the centre of the universe is Huddersfield  
But I dont live there anymore  
I live in Los Angeles  
Its great I think  
  
Rufus the red has a crane by his bed  
To wrench himself up in the morn  
But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed  
Youll wish youd never been born  
A bear with a sore head we mean your forehead  
He slumbers for most of the day  
Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast  
Your problem Rodney L A  
  
repeat chorus
