Head on down the highway  
Across the county line  
Ive had my fill of small town thrills  
Gonna leave it all behind  
  
Free flight free flight  
  
Im careless in my loving  
Shameless in my style  
If I get caught by the short n curlies  
Ill just hide out for awhile  
  
Free flight free flight  
  
On an on the road goes on  
Itll go on forever  
An just the same Ill live my life  
Hell bent for leather  
  
Free flight free flight  
  
Heaven knows its driving me crazy  
Its a feeling inside  
Heaven knows its in my blood  
As long as I try I just cant deny  
  
Free flight come tomorrow dawn youll find me gone  
Free flight make no bones about it Im moving on  
  
Free flight free flight free flight  
Free flight free flight free flight  
  
Head on down the highway  
Suitcase in your hand  
When you get down with your feet on the ground  
I know youll understand  
  
Free flight free flight  
  
Heaven knows its driving me crazy  
Its a feeling thats driving me wild  
Heaven knows its in my blood  
Fool if you try you just cant deny  
  
Free flight come tomorrow dawn youll find me gone  
Free flight make no bones about it Im moving on  
  
Free flight free flight free flight
