Lord have mercy on my soul  
For I have walked the sinful road  
That Im down on my knees  
Lord have mercy on me please  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Jesus I must confess  
That in all my loneliness  
Ive forsaken and Ive sinned  
Leaving fragments of a man so broken  
  
I could tell you what Ive done  
Or should I tell you where I went wrong  
  
Well the more that I start to play  
My deceitful evil ways  
Keep on growing stronger by the day  
  
Oh lord have mercy on my soul  
For I have walked a sinful road  
So Im gonna get down on my knees  
Beg forgiveness to help set me free  
Lord have mercy on me please  
  
Mother Mary full of grace  
In my weakness Ive lost faith  
Ive been careless and I have been warned  
And the devil inside me is torn  
God bless the men that I have scorned  
  
Oh lord have mercy on my soul  
For I have walked the sinful road  
So Im gonna get down on my knees  
Beg forgiveness to help set me free  
Lord have mercy on me please  
  
Whoa whoa yeah yeah  
Whoa yeah yeah oh oh  
Ohoh yeah yeah yeah oh  
  
So dont let me fool around no more  
Send your angels down to guide me through that door  
Well Ive gone and confessed my regrets  
And I pray Im not held in contempt  
Im so lost and I need you to help me repent  
  
Oh lord have mercy on my soul  
Oh Im begging Im pleading Im needing  
I want you to know  
So Im down upon my knees  
Oh lord I need forgiveness  
I need forgiveness from you
