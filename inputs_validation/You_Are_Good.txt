When the sun starts to rise and I open my eyes  
You are good so good  
In the heat of the day with each stone that I lay  
You are good so good  
  
With every breath I take in  
Ill tell You I am grateful again  
When the moon rises high before each kiss goodnight  
You are good  
  
When the road starts to turn around each bend Ive learned  
You are good so good  
And when somebodys hand holds me up helps me stand  
You are so good  
  
With every breath I take in  
Ill tell You Im grateful again  
Cause its more than enough just to know I am loved  
And You are good  
  
So how can I thank You and what can I bring  
What can a poor man lay at the feet of a King  
So Ill sing You a love song its all that I have  
To tell You Im grateful for holding my life in Your hands  
  
When its dark and its cold and I cant feel my soul  
You are still good  
When the world is gone gray and the rains here to stay  
You are still good  
  
With every breath I take in  
Ill tell You I am grateful again  
And the storm may swell even then it is well  
And You are good  
  
So how can I thank You what can I bring  
What can a poor man lay at the feet of a King  
Ill sing You this love song its all that I have  
To tell You Im grateful for holding my life in Your hands  
  
So Ill sing You a love song its all that I have  
To tell You Im grateful for holding my life in Your hands  
You are holding my life in Your hands
