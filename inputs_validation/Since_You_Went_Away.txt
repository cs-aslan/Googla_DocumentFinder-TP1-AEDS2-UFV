You said you couldnt tell the doormat from my face  
You said if I had brains I would pawn them  
Could be Ive finally gotten up off of my thumbs  
Could be that youre the one that was on them  
  
Cause the plants have grown  
The dog came home  
The bills are all getting paid  
Things are much better since you went away  
And Ive changed my looks  
I read new books  
Ive got friends that mean what they say  
Things are much better since you went away  
  
You said without your help I couldnt tie my shoes  
You said without a doubt Id be stranded  
Could be that you were right and you had to fly the coop  
Could be the eagle finally has landed  
  
Cause the plants have grown  
The dog came home  
The bills are all getting paid  
Things are much better since you went away  
And Ive changed my looks  
I read new books  
Ive got friends that mean what they say  
Things are much better since you went away  
  
When I was younger I was told without another  
Id be incomplete and deflated  
My chosen one has chosen to befriend another  
And to my surprise  
Im elated  
  
Cause the plants have grown  
The dog came home  
The bills are all getting paid  
Things are much better since you went away  
And Ive changed my looks  
I read new books  
Ive got friends that mean what they say  
Things are much better since you went away
