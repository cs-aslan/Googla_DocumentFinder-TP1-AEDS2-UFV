Some folks trust to reason others trust to might  
I dont trust to nothing but I know it come out right  
Say it once again now whoa I hope youll understand  
When its done and over Lord a man is just a man  
  
Chorus  
Playing playing in the band  
Daybreak daybreak on the land  
  
Some folks look for answers others look for fights  
Some folks up in tree tops just to look to see the sights  
just looking for their kites  
I can tell your future whoa just look whats in your hand  
I cant stop for nothing Im just playing in the band  
  
Chorus  
  
Standing on a tower world at my command  
You just keep aturning while Im playing in the band  
If a man among you got no sin upon his hand  
Let him cast a stone at me for playing in the band  
  
Playing like a wave upon the sand
