It lay buried here It lay deep inside me  
Its so deep I dont think that I can speak about it  
It could take me all of my life  
But it would only take a moment to  
  
Tell you what Im feeling  
But I dont know if Im ready yet  
You come walking into this room  
Like youre walking into my arms  
What would I do without you  
  
Take away the love and the anger  
And a little piece of hope holding us together  
Looking for a moment thatll never happen  
Living in the gap between past and future  
Take away the stone and the timber  
And a little piece of rope wont hold it together  
  
If you cant tell your sister  
If you cant tell a priest  
Cause its so deep you dont think that you can speak about it  
To anyone  
Can you tell it to your heart  
Can you find it in your heart  
  
To let go of these feelings  
Like a bell to a Southerly wind  
We could be like two strings beating  
Speaking in sympathy  
What would we do without you  
Two strings speak in sympathy  
  
Take away the love and the anger  
And a little piece of hope holding us together  
Looking for a moment thatll never happen  
Living in the gap between past and future  
Take away the stone and the timber  
And a little piece of rope wont hold it together  
  
Were building a house of the future together  
What would we do without you  
  
Well if its so deep you dont think that you can speak about it  
Just remember to reach out and touch the past and the future  
Well if its so deep you dont think you can speak about it  
Dont ever think that you cant change the past and the future  
You might not not think so now  
But just you wait and seesomeone will come to help you
