Out of my head and delighted somebody knows how I feel  
If you ask me to play it you wont have to say it twice  
Cause Im goin to the head of the line Im takin my life away  
Im so glad you made it and now that youre ready  
Ill begin to tell you what you want but I know  
I feel I feel somebody knows I feel I feel somebody knows  
I feel I feel somebody knows I feel I feel  
Somebody knows what you want and what youre tryin to do  
Cause the same thing can happen to you  
A little smoke a little drink can make somebody start to think  
That he knows  
I feel I feel somebody knows I feel I feel  
Somebody knows what you want when you want it  
Somebody knows when youre doin it right  
Somebody sees with their feelings and feels what theyre being tonight  
And were doin it together I know  
I feel I feel somebody knows I feel I feel somebody knows  
I feel I feel somebody knows I feel I feel God I know  
I feel I feel somebody knows I feel I feel somebody knows  
I feel I feel somebody knows I feel I feel  
Got what you want on the run now keep it on in sight  
Make me crazy and you wont need me to tell you that youre doin it right  
Cause I know  
I feel I feel somebody knows I feel I feel somebody knows  
I feel I feel somebody knows I feel I feel
