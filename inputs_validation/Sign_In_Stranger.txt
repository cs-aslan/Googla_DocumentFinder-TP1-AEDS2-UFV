Have you heard about the boom on Mizar Five  
People got to shout to stay alive  
They dont even have policeman one  
Doesnt matter where you been or what youve done  
  
Do you have a dark spot on your past  
Leave it to my man hell fix it fast  
Pepe has a scar from ear to ear  
He will make your mug shots disappear  
  
Chorus  
You zombie  
Be born again my friend  
Wont you sign in stranger  
  
Do you like to take a yoyo for a ride  
Zombie I can see youre qualified  
Walk around collecting Turkish union dues  
They will call you sir and shine your shoes  
  
Or maybe you would like to see the show  
Youll enjoy the Cafe DEscargot  
Folks are in a line around the block  
Just to see her do the cancanJacques  
  
Chorus  
  
Love or leave her yellow fever  
Sure its all in the game  
And who are you  
Just another scurvy brother  
  
Chorus
