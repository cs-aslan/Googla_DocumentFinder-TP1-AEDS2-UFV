It was the last day of summer  
It was the first of a new romance  
He walked into her on the corner  
She said I dont dance  
  
He said Baby let me teach you  
She said OK when  
He said How can I reach you baby  
Id really like to see you again  
  
He picked her up on a Friday night  
He took her for a bite to eat  
His heart was beating and his hands were shaking  
She thought he was sweet  
  
And he stood on her shoes on the dance floor  
Well they were doing it cheek to cheek  
And he walked her home and he kissed her  
He was walking on air all week  
  
Well they couldnt stand to be apart  
They couldnt leave one another alone  
Her mama used to say Its getting late sweetheart  
Its time that boy went home  
  
And upstairs papa kissed mama  
And she gave him a sweet caress  
He said Heres to the two young lovers  
Lets wish em every happiness  
  
It was the last day of summer  
They came walking home hand in hand  
They went and told her mama  
They showed her the wedding band  
  
Mama cried and poured the wine  
Papa just said God Bless  
Now heres to the two young lovers  
Lets wish em every happiness
