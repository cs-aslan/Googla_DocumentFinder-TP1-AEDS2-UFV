If I give my heart to you will you handle it with care  
Will you always treat me tenderly and in every way be fair  
If I give my heart to you will you give me all your love  
Will you swear that youll be true to me by the light that shines above  
And will you sigh with me when Im sad  
Smile with me when Im glad  
And always be as you are with me tonight  
  
Think it over and be sure  
Please dont answer til you do  
When you promise all these things to me  
Then Ill give my heart to you
