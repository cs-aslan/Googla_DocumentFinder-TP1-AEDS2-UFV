See the light in the distance  
Ten seconds from sleep  
If you blink you could miss it  
Voluntarily  
If its home that youre missing  
Better call the police  
  
Chorus  
Hopelessly lost at sea  
The holes we dig to survive  
Like rabbits we run  
  
Gonna join the resistance  
Gonna tighten that leash  
Try and find some persistence  
Temporarily  
If its home that youre missing  
Better ramp up your speed  
  
Chorus  
  
Like rabbits we run  
  
Repeat x2  
The light of day  
The dark of night  
We hide in our heads keeping our dreams alive  
  
Repeat x3  
Like rabbits we run
