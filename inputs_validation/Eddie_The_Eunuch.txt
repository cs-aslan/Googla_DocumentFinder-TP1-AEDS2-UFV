Eddie the Eunuch was a weasel  
Nasty as an old mans nose  
Making believin he was evil  
Struttin in his mamas clothes  
  
You know that Eddie had a bad connection  
Never had a chance to ball  
Sleeping in the wrong direction baby  
Dreaming he was ten feet tall  
  
But now Eddie the Eunuch is a rock and roll critic  
Sucking like a super star  
Slicker than a shoeshine  
Quicker than a twotime  
  
Eddie what a thang you are  
Eddie makes a damn good livin baby  
Putting other people down  
  
Eddie couldnt ever forgive them baby  
Cause he wasnt Jackson Browne
