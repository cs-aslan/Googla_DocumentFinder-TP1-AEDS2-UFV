Goddamn you halfJapanese girls  
Do it to me every time  
Oh the redhead said you shred the cello  
And Im jello baby  
But you wont talk wont look wont think of me  
Im the epitome of Public Enemy  
Why you want to go and do me like that  
Come down on the street and dance with me  
  
Im a lot like you so please Hello Im here Im waiting  
I think Id be good for you and youd be good for me  
  
I asked you to go to the Green Day concert  
You said you never heard of them  
How cool is that  
So I went to your room and read your diary  
watching Grunge legdrop NewJack trough presstable  
And then my heart stopped  
Listening to CioCio San fall in love all over again  
  
How stupid is it I cant talk about it  
I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart  
How stupid is it wont you gimme a minute  
Just come up to me and say hello to my heart  
How stupid is it For all I know you want me too  
And maybe you just dont know what to do  
Or maybe youre scared to say Im falling for you  
  
I wish I could get my head out of the sand  
Cause I think wed make a good team  
And you would keep my fingernails clean  
But thats just a stupid dream that I wont realize  
Cause I cant even look in your eyes without shakin and I aint fakin  
Ill bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon
