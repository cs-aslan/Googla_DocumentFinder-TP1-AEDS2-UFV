I wont dance dont ask me  
I wont dance dont ask me  
I wont dance madame with you  
My heart wont  
Let me feet do things that they should do  
  
You know what youre lovely you know what youre so lovely  
And you know what you do to me  
Im like an ocean wave thats bumped on the shore  
I feel so absolutely  
Stumped on the floor  
  
When you dance youre charming and youre gentle  
Especially when you do the Continental  
But this feeling isnt purely mental  
For heaven rest us Im not asbestos  
And thats why I  
Wont dance why should I  
  
I wont dance how could I  
I wont dance Merci beau coup  
  
I know  
That music lead the way to romance  
So if I hold you in arms I wont dance  
  
I wont dance dont ask me  
I wont dance dont ask me  
I wont dance madame with you  
My heart wont let me feet do things that  
They want to do  
  
You know what youre so lovely ring a dingding youre lovely  
And you know what  
You do to me  
Im like an ocean wave thats bumped on the shore  
I feel so absolutely stumped on the  
Floor  
  
When you dance youre charming and youre gentle  
Especially when you do the Continental  
But this feeling isnt purely mental  
For heaven rest us Im not asbestos  
And thats why I wont dance  
I wont dance  
  
I wont dance Merci beau coup  
I know that music leads the way to romance  
  
So if I hold  
You in arms I wont dance
