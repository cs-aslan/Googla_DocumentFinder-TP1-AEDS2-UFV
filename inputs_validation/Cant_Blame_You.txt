Trying so hard not to cry  
Since they say man aint supposed to cry  
But these tears keep running from my eyes  
I remember the day I came to the city  
My children were crying  
My wife was crying  
Shes gonna lose me  
To the girls in the city  
To make her feel alright I  
said its impossible  
But I was wrong  
  
Chorus  
Cant blame you when youre going  
This is something youve got to do  
Youve got to go ho ho  
Youve been keeping me here all these years as your private lover  
Letters came from home  
But I never answered  
Till today when I got this letter  
From my little daughter saying  
Missing you daddy  
Its time to go  
  
Chorus  
  
Cant blame you as above  
See me now see me no more  
I heard that whistle blow  
I knew its time to go  
Sitting here in this train  
Going so fast past the trees  
Im thinking of words to apologize  
Cause sorry aint enough  
  
Chorus  
  
Cant blame you till fade
