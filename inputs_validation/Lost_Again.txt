I told you lady  
Take me for one day  
Please dont ask any questions  
You know I can stay  
  
I wish the wind was cold  
I want to hold you baby hold  
Only in your arms Im lost  
Dont look at me  
  
I wish the wind was cold  
I want to hold you baby hold  
Only in your arms Im lost  
Dont look at me  
  
I know isnt this crazy  
Lets have a last drink  
Dont ask where I come from  
And dont ask what I think  
I leave you lady  
Full of desire to stay  
  
I wish the wind was cold  
I want to hold you baby hold  
Only in your arms Im lost  
Dont look at me  
  
I told you  
Take me for one day  
Dont ask any questions  
You know I can stay  
  
I wish the wind was cold  
I want to hold you baby hold  
Only in your arms Im lost  
Dont look at me  
  
I wish the wind was cold  
I want to hold you baby hold  
Only in your arms Im lost  
Dont look at me  
  
I wish the wind was cold  
I want to hold you baby hold  
Only in your arms Im lost  
Dont look at me  
  
I wish the wind was cold  
I want to hold you baby hold  
Only in your arms Im lost  
Dont look at me
