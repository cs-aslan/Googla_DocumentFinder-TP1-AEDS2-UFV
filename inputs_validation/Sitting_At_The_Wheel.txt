I can hear the music playing  
I can hear the word that youre saying  
I can see the love life in your eyes  
Whats the use in looking for an answer  
I might find out  
It could be a disaster  
Hold on to your own time  
Dont let go  
Dont let go  
  
Im sitting at the wheel  
Watching the river roll roll on by by by  
Sitting at the wheel  
Dont let the river run dry  
  
I can see your face on a piece of tomorrow  
Ill hang my dream on a road I can follow  
I gotta touch the warmth of your love  
Need the warmth of your love not gonna  
Not gonna take a chance a  
Change of direction  
Gonna keep on rolling till I find the connection  
Hold on to your lifeline  
Dont let go  
Dont let go  
  
Im sitting at the wheel  
Watching the river roll roll on by by by  
Sitting at the wheel  
Dont let the river run dry  
Im sitting at  
Im sitting at the wheel  
  
Like a voyeur standing at the edge of time  
Looking for a reason  
Thats got no rhyme  
Love took a corner  
Shot off for a mile  
Im sitting at the wheel  
Rock onRocker  
  
I can feel the music playing Hold on
