There you go making mountains  
Out of such a little hill  
Here I go mixing mortar  
For another wall to build  
Theres a struggle in this life we lead  
Its partly you  
Its partly me but  
Every road thats traveled  
Teaches something new  
Every road thats narrow  
Pushes us to choose  
And Id be lying if I said  
I had not tried to leave a time or two  
But every road that leads me  
Leads me back to you  
Here we stand in the middle  
Of what weve come to know  
Its a dance its a balance  
Holding on and letting go  
But there is nothing that we cant resolve  
When loves at stake  
When loves involved
