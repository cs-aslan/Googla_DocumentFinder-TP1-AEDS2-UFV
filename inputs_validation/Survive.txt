Go on and admit it  
You cant take it anymore  
So why dont you quit it  
Your scratching off again  
Cant you see it  
Well the whole thing was such a surprise  
I know you and your hear crazy notions  
Your pretty girls and no devotions  
Down by the ocean middle class  
Down by the gulf side you let it all slide  
But now your saying that you dont  
Wanna be a sixteen year old girl aah  
But you dont want to turn twentyfive  
You never ever you never ever lied  
Where you been aahh  
You got to survive to keep yourself alive  
Yeahah yeah  
It aint no big deal if your attitude is wrong  
And you dont know how you feel  
You just cop someone elses ideas  
And masturbate yourself make them your own  
Well I I dont mean to tell you what to do  
Cause Ive scratched off myself a time or two  
Well it just leaves you blue with nothing to do  
And they think Im crazy when I stay up all weekend  
But now your saying that you dont  
Wanna be a sixteen year old girl oh yeah aah  
But you dont want to turn twentyfive  
You never ever you never ever lied  
Where you been aahh  
You got to survive to keep yourself alive  
Yeahah my na na no yeah  
So if Im walking down the street and you see me  
Dont walk on by say hey man  
You know your looking your looking so fine  
You dont have to mean it no no  
Its just one of the regular lies that weve lived with  
And this is a love song and  
Im writing it just to survive
