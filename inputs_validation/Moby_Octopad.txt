Locked in a kiss outsiders cease to exist  
Well shut it out of the fist  
Outsiders cease to exist  
Well shut it out  
Eight oclock the lights are on at Shea  
Phone turned down weve nothing much to say  
Dozing off the TV drones  
House key makes them turn and glance for home  
Locked in a kiss outsiders cease to exist  
Flayed of the fist  
Outsiders cease to exist  
Well shut it out
