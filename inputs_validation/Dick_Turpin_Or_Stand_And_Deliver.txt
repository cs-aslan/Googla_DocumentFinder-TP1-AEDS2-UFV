Everyone thinks they know the story  
Of Dick Turpins highway glory  
But my past was far more gory  
Was no saint  
  
You think life is one big antic  
My profession is romantic  
Hate to be pedantic  
But it aint  
  
HA  
  
As a butcher down in Essex I was handy with a knife  
Had a sideline as a poacher led a less than honest life  
  
The notorious gang of Gregory  
Liked my style and dedication  
They signed me up and gave me  
A real robbers education  
  
We rampaged through the Essex farms  
We stole and robbed and fought  
But when the law came for us  
I escaped and they got caught  
  
I became I highway man  
Was daylight robbery  
  
HA  
  
I was no prince charming  
Nothing dandy about me  
  
HA  
  
The truth is I was violent  
And with my good mate Matt King  
Robbed travelers at gunpoint  
Money watches anything  
  
My horse wasnt called Black Bess  
Although thats what youve read  
Was no romantic hero  
Shot not one but two men dead  
  
The legend that surrounds me  
Misses out the crucial part  
I was a ruthless killer  
With a ruthless killers heart  
  
Was a vicious highwayman  
A source of pain and tears  
  
HA  
  
When you hear how my story ends  
You wont believe your ears  
  
HA  
  
I ran away to Yorkshire  
Changed my name to John Palmer  
Was sent to prison  
After stealing chickens from a farmer  
  
Wrote a letter to my family  
A plea it did relate  
The postman saw the envelope  
And heres the twist of fate  
  
He had taught me how to write  
So hed knew Id lied  
thats not John Palmers hand  
Thats Dick Turpins he cried  
  
Was a vicious highway man  
My crimes had brought me fame  
  
HA  
  
Was stitched up by a postie  
Thats not glamorous  
THATS LAME  
  
HA  
  
No more stand and deliver  
Youll remember this I hope  
  
HA  
  
Its no fun hanging with highwaymen  
When youre  
  
Hanging from a rope
