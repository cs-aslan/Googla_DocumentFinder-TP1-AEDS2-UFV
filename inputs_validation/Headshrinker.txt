I know a girl whos lost and lonely  
Sits by the phone on her own  
But the phone dont ring  
And the birds dont sing in her tree  
She lost herself in a haze of pity  
And doesnt know where to run  
Shes a headshrinker now  
And I think its time we have some fun  
  
Lost in a fog  
Ive been treated like a dog  
And Im out of here  
I got no name  
And I feel no shame  
And I got no fear  
And I bow down  
To the tears of a clown  
Whatevers going down  
Is coming around  
I hope you dont regret today  
  
For the rest of your lives  
For the rest of your lives  
For the rest of your lives  
For the rest of your lives  
  
Lost in a fog  
Ive been treated like a dog  
And Im out of here  
I got no name  
And I feel no shame  
And I got no fear  
And I bow down  
To the tears of a clown  
Whatevers going down  
Is coming around  
I hope you dont regret today  
  
For the rest of your lives
