All is well  
Ive made my peace where highways never end  
Yesterdays a memory today is just a friend  
For the mountains and Marian are calling me again  
And the red pines will bow their heads  
The rivers and the watersheds will swallow up my tears  
All is well  
I left the cold midwestern towns behind  
Theres a semi up the road ahead Ill take him in my time  
For the hotblooded mountain love is calling me again  
And the vagabond within me cries  
The wind and rain might burn my eyes but I wont feel the pain  
For the mountains and Marian will greet me there as only she can do  
  
All is well  
As I swing up to the border bent for hell  
And the service station man agreed I didnt look too well  
But the mountains and Marian are calling out to me  
And I got my bedroll on my back  
And everything that I could pack to see me on my way  
  
All is well  
Ive made my peace and man Im feelin fine  
And the losers that I left behind Ill think about some other time  
For the border men were all my friends they couldnt find a dime  
And the prairie towns go sailing by  
Saskatchewan theres mud in your eye Im leavin you behind  
Therell be hotblooded mountain love to satisfy my soul  
And the red pines will bow their heads  
The rivers and the watersheds will carry us along  
And the mountains and Marian will greet me there as only she can do  
  
All is well  
The foothills are coming into sight  
Today is just a memory the future is tonight  
And the red pines will bow their heads  
The rivers and the watersheds will carry us along  
And the mountains and Marian will greet me there as only she can do
