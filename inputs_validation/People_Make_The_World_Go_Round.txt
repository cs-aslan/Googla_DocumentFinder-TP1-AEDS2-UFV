People  
Round and round and around  
People make the world go round  
Round and round and around  
  
Teachers on strike no more school today  
They want more money but the board wont pay  
People  
Everybodys talkin bout ecology  
The airs so polluted that its hard to breathe  
People  
  
Chorus  
But thats what makes the world go round  
The ups and downs a carousel  
Changing peoples heads around  
Go underground young men  
People make the world go round  
  
Old folks judge you by the clothes you wear  
Theyd swear youre a Hippy if you have long hair  
Young politicians fight for poverty  
While people still cry for equality  
  
Chorus x2
