Well I aint goin down that big long lonesome road  
Pretty baby dont you hear me talkin  
No I aint goin down that big road by myself  
If I cant carrry you baby  
Im gonna get me someone else  
Alright boys  
Well the sun is gonna shine in my back door some  
My back door some my door someday  
You know the sun is gonna shine in  
My back door some day  
That big wind is gonna come up and blow my blues away  
Now if you dont want me baby  
Now why dont you tell me  
Now why dont you tell me tell me so  
If you dont want me baby why dont you tell me so  
It aint like Im a woman who aint got no place to go  
Play it right now  
Now what good is a bulldog if he wont fuss or  
He wont fuss or fight pretty baby  
What good is a bulldog if he wont fuss or fight  
And what good is a man cant make his wolf stay all night
