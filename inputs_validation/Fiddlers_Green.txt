September seventeen  
For a girl I know its Mothers Day  
Here son has gone alee  
And thats where he will stay  
Wind on the weathervane  
Tearing blue eyes sailormean  
As Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain  
For a boy in Fiddlers Green  
  
His tiny knotted heart  
Well I guess it never worked too good  
The timber tore apart  
And the water gorged the wood  
You can hear her whispered prayer  
For men at masts that always lean  
The same wind that moves her hair  
Moves a boy through Fiddlers Green  
  
Nothings changed anyway  
Nothings changed anyway  
Any time today  
  
He doesnt know a soul  
Theres nowhere that hes really been  
But he wont travel long alone  
No not in Fiddlers Green  
Balloons all filled with rain  
As childrens eyes turn sleepymean  
And Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain  
For a boy in Fiddlers Green
