Communication always leaves me in incomplete  
The grass is greener but its grown beneath my feet  
Love inspiration is a message on a wing  
But I have left it in the words youll never sing  
Communication let me down  
And Im left here  
Communication let me down  
And Im left here Im left here  
Telex or tell me but its always secondhand  
Im incognito but no rendezvous been planned  
Dictate or relate I could send it to your home  
Return to sender I could sing it down the phone  
Communication let me down  
And Im left here  
Communication let me down  
And Im left here Im left here I I I  
Dictate relate  
Dictate relate  
Im sitting and waiting by the telephone  
Waiting for the bell to ring  
Short change fumble Dial a heart trouble  
And I aint got time for searching through the rubble oh no  
Well no  
Communication let me down  
And Im left here  
Communication let me down  
And Im left here Im left here I I I  
Im left here  
Im left here  
Im left here
