Well I think its really time again for a revolution  
Not to destroy at all costs but have a look at whats there  
Can you remember a time when water was still water  
Or are you too young to even know what we wont give to our heirs  
  
Inhale the bless of science through your lungs skin and brain  
Ill surely make our children feel a lot more sane  
  
Revolution now  
  
I was born when April guaranteed a sexual renaissance  
And today were all faced with death rubbers and AIDS  
In 68 some people went out to fight for freedom  
They would never ever have thought that their children wear ties  
  
And if you come to San Francisco  
Youre gonna meet some broken people there  
  
Revolution now
