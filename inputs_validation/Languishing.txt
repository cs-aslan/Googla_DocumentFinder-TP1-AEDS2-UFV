If you could only see  
That I was not put here for you  
To judge me and dispute my in most truth  
  
Ad after all these years of enmity envy and tears  
Its a shame you dont know me at all  
  
I was wondering would you cry for me  
If I told you that I couldnt breathe  
If I was drowning suffocating  
If I told you that I couldnt breathe  
  
Those ageless buried recollections  
We transform them and select them  
You have yours I have mine thats fine  
  
Why are we too torn to heal  
Our stitches never dissapear  
I have mine you have yours Im sure  
  
I was wondering  
Would you reach for me  
If you saw that I was languishing  
  
I was wondering would you cry for me  
If I told you that I couldnt breathe  
If I was drowning suffocating  
If I told you that I couldnt breathe
