27 years 27 years old  
Only thing I know the only thing that gets old  
I gotta sell out if I want to get sold  
Dont want the devil to be taking my soul  
I write songs that come from my heart  
I dont give a fuck if they get into the chart oh no  
Only way I can be is to say what I see  
And have my shadow hanging over me  
  
I dont know where Im running but I know how to run  
Cause runnings the thing Ive always done  
I dont know what Im doing but I know what Ive done  
Im a hungry heart Im a loaded gun  
  
27 years 27 years now only thing I know I know that I dont know how  
To please everybody all of the time  
Cause everybody always fucking changes their mind  
A little bit of faith and a little bit of chain  
Dont want to stop wont be persuaded  
To write words I cant believe in to see my face on a video screen  
  
I dont know where Im running but I know how to run  
Cause runnings the thing Ive always done  
I dont know what Im doing but I know what Ive done  
Im a hungry heart Im a loaded gun  
  
Oh oh oh ooooh ooh oh oh oh oooooh oh oh oooh  
  
27 years 27 years done  
Written 600 songs only 12 get sung  
87 000 cigarettes have passed through these lungs and  
Every single day I wish Id never smoked 1  
A week brushing my teeth and a week getting my haircut  
8 years sleeping Im still tired when I wake up  
A whole year eating and I still lost weight fuck  
5 proper girlfriends and 5 messy breakups  
27 birthdays 27 new years  
30 000 quid just so I could have a few beers  
Ever dying old hopes ever growing new fears  
Dont know how Im going but I know how Im going here  
  
Dont know where Im running but I know how to run  
Cause runnings the thing Ive always done  
Said I dont know what Im doing but I know what Ive done  
Im a hungry heart Im a loaded gun
