Doctor wheres your remedy  
Ive got enough to pay the fee  
Cant you see Im awful sick  
Ill pay you well to do the trick  
  
Doctor wheres your magic box  
Theres no one here to count the cost  
Name your price and make the sale  
Theres noone here to tell the tale  
  
Doctor please dont lock your door  
Ive never troubled you before  
Just a pinch to ease the pain  
Ill never trouble you again
