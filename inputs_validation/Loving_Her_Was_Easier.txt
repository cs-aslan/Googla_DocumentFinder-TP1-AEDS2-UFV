That Anything Ill Ever Do Again  
  
I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountains in the skies  
Achin with the feelin of the freedom of an eagle when she flies  
Turnin on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying  
Healin as the colours in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes  
  
Wakin in the mornin to the feelin of her fingers on my skin  
Wipin out the traces of the people and the places that Ive been  
Teachin me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying  
Talkin of tomorrow and the money love and time we had to spend  
  
Lovin her was easier than anything Ill ever do again  
  
Comin close together with a feelin that Ive never known before in my time  
She aint ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend  
I dont know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind  
But dreamin was as easy as believin it was never gonna end  
  
And lovin her was easier than anything Ill ever do again  
  
Oooooh  
Oooooh  
Ahhh
