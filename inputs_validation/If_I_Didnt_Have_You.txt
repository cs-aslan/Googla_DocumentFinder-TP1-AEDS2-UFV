Well I lost my heart on the day we met  
But I gained a lot and that I dont regret  
  
Then I hung around till you said I do  
  
I knew I wouldnt have nothing  
If I didnt have you  
  
Well it changed my thinking And it changed your name  
And Neither one of us will ever be the same  
  
And I swear Im never gonna be untrue  
Cause I wouldnt have nothing  
If I didnt have you  
  
If I didnt have you  
Id long ago  
Been left in the dark out in the cold  
  
Blowing around from town to town  
Like a feather in the wind  
  
If I didnt have you  
I know Id be  
Floundering around like a ship at sea  
Lost in the rain of a hurricane  
And thats where Id have been  
  
  
But I didnt get lost cause I saw your light  
Shining like a beacon on a cold dark night  
And The sun came up and The skies turned blue  
  
No I wouldnt have nothing  
If I didnt have you  
  
Well I count my blessings every night I pray  
That the lord lets me keep you just one more day  
And Every day he does cause God knows too  
  
That I wouldnt have nothing  
If I didnt have you  
  
If I didnt have you  
Id long ago  
Been left in the dark out in the cold  
Blowing around from town to town  
Like a feather in the wind  
  
If I didnt have you  
I know Id be  
Floundering around like a ship at sea  
Lost in the rain of a hurricane  
And thats where Id have been  
  
But I didnt get lost cause I saw your light  
Shining like a beacon on a cold dark night  
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue  
  
No I wouldnt have nothing  
If I didnt have you  
  
Well Ive already said it but I swear its true  
I know I wouldnt have nothing  
If I didnt have you
