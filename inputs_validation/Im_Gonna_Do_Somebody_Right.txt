Well I just found out you let your baby down  
So I made up my mind and my face and Im goin to town  
Im gonna pay you back by doin you the way youve done me  
And some dude dont know how lucky hes about to be  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna do somebody right just to do you wrong  
Im gonna make his day if it takes me all night long  
Im gonna pick him up love him up and really come on strong  
Im gonna do somebody right Im gonna break your heart tonight  
Im gonna do somebody right just to do you wrong  
  
Im gonna give you just what you deserve  
Cause the crime sure fits the sentence you must serve  
Then Im gonna make it twice as hard on you I know because  
Im gonna come back in the morning and tell you how it was  
  
Chorus
