You cant see what you mean to me  
I just cant get you out of my head  
You move me more than Ive ever been  
Like a wild supersonic jet  
But I cant see your love drifting away  
And I dont want your love ddddrifting away  
  
I got told by a friend of mine  
That you dont want me anymore  
Now my friends got a broken nose  
Sure and I got a broken jaw  
So dont push me around Im coming your way  
And I dont want your love ddddrifting away  
  
Dont you know what Im living for  
Dont you know what Im trying to say  
Dont try to shove me outta that door  
Cause youre mine and its staying that way  
Im giving you my love dont throw it away  
But I can see your love ddddrifting away  
Oh drifting away you got me drifting away  
Oh drifting away
