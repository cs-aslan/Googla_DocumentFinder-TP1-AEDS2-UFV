Viewed the scene on a black and white T V  
Choose your words hey mom I want to be  
So study hard  
Your work became your cell  
Dont you dare inhale or youll be damned to hell  
No Yes back and in your prime and things are in a swirl  
Solaced with your choice out pops a baby girl  
Family now complete and powers in your hands  
Youve won the greatest prize its time to take a stand  
Sphincter freed last on your common throne  
You think the kill weeds chompin at your noodles flow  
Theres somethin about the herb so fast hypnotize  
A ripened head change thatll pillow your eyes  
Will you be the superman inflicting drastic change  
The power of your name has spanded out a boundless range  
Will you meet the needs of a fast paced awkward  
Lifespan I call we  
Our trust is now within you  
So by soul cries let it be  
Pillow your eyes  
Yes I praise Jah
