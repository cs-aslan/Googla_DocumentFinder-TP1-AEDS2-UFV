Loveits a beginning  
A justifiable means to an end  
And happiness that triumphant feeling  
Only comes from within  
But youllnever make the grade  
No youll never ever reach that plateau  
Youre down below  
And its where your soul will forever glow  
But its not that ray of sunshine that feels so warm  
Its just that bottomless inferno  
  
Youre in the depths of hell  
And I think thats swell  
And I hope you get well  
  
Well done fried in and out  
Burned to a crisp if thats what I wish  
I didnt write the rules  
I just follow them to a tee  
Cause thats me Im evil  
Im hateful Im sinful forgetful mistrustful  
Im diseased and contagious  
Im suicide homicide genocide pesticide  
  
Im a human bomb  
Ill kill anyone  
And so are you So dont be coy  
Cause you too can destroy me like a toy  
Not like Mark Bowen  
He never done nothin to no one  
 That didnt deserve it
