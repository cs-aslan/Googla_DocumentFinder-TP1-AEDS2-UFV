Exotic cars scream down the sunset of dreams  
On a hot sunny afternoon  
Im in a hot dog stand  
With a strange love holding my hand  
And were both playin it real cool  
  
Chorus  
Its the summer of love  
Its the summer of love baby  
Its the summer of love  
Leastways Im hopin it is  
  
So we talk about her favorite movie star or something  
She says Ya know Ive never done this before Yeah sure  
I know it sounds strange but I cant remember your name  
But I remember last night on the floor  
And we both laughed like she told a joke or something  
She takes her neckerchief off and wraps it around my head  
And says Hey you  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X  
  
So we both walk along alone  
She says Hey Mister you sure make a strange kind of lover  
And I say yeah  
I say yeah  
  
Chorus  
Leastways Im thinkin it just might be
