And we swim forever  
Stay the same forever  
  
I talked to you today  
You didnt seem depressed  
The way I acted was  
Nothing for you to test  
And I feel so sad  
That Ive lost control  
  
So many chances I  
Feel like I must be wrong  
Im misdirected by  
Communications songs  
And I feel so sad  
That you wanted more  
  
And we swim forever  
Stay the same forever  
  
And were wasting over  
Barren something  
Over nothing  
Like before  
Weve been sidelined  
Resurrected  
Dont deserve it  
And what more  
  
And were wasting over  
Barren something  
Over nothing  
Like before  
Weve been sidelined  
Resurrected  
Dont deserve it  
And what more  
  
And we swim forever  
And we swim forever  
And we swim forever  
And we swim forever  
  
Wait until you  
Some know  
Whatd you say
