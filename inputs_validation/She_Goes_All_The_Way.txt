No limits no lines are drawn  
The whole world disappears when  
Were alone  
That thin white cotton dress is  
Blowin in the wind  
She takes my hand and the dance begins  
  
Chorus  
With every move she makes  
Im deeper than Ive been  
Holding on and letting go  
She just keeps givin in  
Takin me higher and further  
There she goes again givin more than  
She takes  
Cause its more than love she makes  
She goes all the way  
  
No questions no talking at all  
Only the sound of our hearts as the fall  
No matter what I need her answers  
Always yes  
I only have to dream and she does the  
Rest  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Oh oh oh  
My baby goes all the way the way  
She goes all the way  
My baby goes all the way  
Oh yeah yeah yeah
