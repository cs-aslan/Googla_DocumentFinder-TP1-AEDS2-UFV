Just starin at these four walls closin  
In on me feelin like times frozen  
Fadin in and out noddin and dozin  
Guilt tearin up my brain like erosion  
What I did to you was wrong I admit it  
I regret that I did it like a junkie when hes jonzin  
All alone in what used to be a home  
But you packed up our joy in that bag you put your clothes in  
The voice mail that you left me was scoldin  
Hot enough to burn a hole in a cauldron  
Cause it was all true thats why we all through  
Now your girls pickin up the cell when I call you  
Talkin slick like she aint here  
She dont want you no more punk disappear click  
I need to hit her with a brick  
But thatll only lead me to a worse predicament  
I hope your girlfriend aint got you on a liquor binge  
With her bitter attitude just cause shes sick of men  
But Ima keep on callin fightin til the end  
On my knees til they bleed to prove my love again  
  
Chorus  
I sit in front of yo crib in the pourin rain  
Whylin out screamin yo name  
And keepin ringin yo bell til you mad as hell  
And call the popo I aint afraid yeah yeah  
You can get yo folks and yo cousins and them  
And try to run me off yo blocka uhhuh  
But I aint scared I aint goin nowhere  
And I aint stoppin til I gotcha  
To show you I changed shawty  
  
I seen you at the movies with some tall cat  
So I bust his headlights with a ball bat  
When I was with you he would give me dap and all that  
Now you in his arms in the mall what you call that  
Thats what I get for creepin and crawlin  
Every other weekend gone until the mornin  
Sneakin out to my dirt dead wrong  
Comin back past dawn with the guilty mask on  
And I never counted the cost took heed to warnings  
Try to hurt a rose you get pricked by a thorn  
And it dont feel nice when you wake up nights  
Shakin in cold sweats and your whole lifes a wreck  
That was the old me the one I still regret  
The one you couldnt respect the one you should forget  
But Ima keep on callin fightin til the end  
On my knees til they bleed to prove my love again  
  
Chorus  
  
To show you I changed shawty  
I really did change shawty Im tellin you Ive changed  
I wanna show you I changed shawty  
i still love you cars peel  
  
I dont care if the cops got me surrounded  
Swat teams whatever tell em to send the hounds in  
My minds in an altered state  
Like Im headed for a wall top speed foot off the brake  
I make a fool of myself girl whatever it takes  
I already played the fool when I let you escape  
Youre as good as it gets your friendship your sex  
Everything about you and yours connects  
From your beautiful smile to the scent of your skin  
The sheets smell different this is not livin  
It feels like dyin god knows Im tryin  
Aint no sight sadder than a grown man cryin  
Please find it in your heart to forgive me  
Realize only god can convict me  
We all make mistakes so have you  
If god show mercy on me then you should too  
  
Chorus  
  
To show you I changed shawty  
I really did change shawty im tellin you Ive changed  
I wanna show you I changed shawty  
I still love you ow  
Im tellin you Ive changed
