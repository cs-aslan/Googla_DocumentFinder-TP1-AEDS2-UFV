For years Ive lived without a meaning  
Ive lost faith in dreams somehow  
Im so sick and tired of scheming  
I guess it just dont matter now  
All my life Ive been a loser  
It seems that fate has made a vow  
That I will never know contentment  
But it just dont matter now  
Yes I knew the day I lost you  
But could not face fact somehow  
And I knew just what it cost you  
But it just dont matter now  
All my heart has lost a feeling  
That meant more to me than thou  
And I will never say I blame you  
Cause it just dont matter now
