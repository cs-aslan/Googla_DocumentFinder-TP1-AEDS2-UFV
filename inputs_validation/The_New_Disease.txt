All about your new disease  
This is what you said you wanted  
When you walked away from me  
I heard the news today

That Im gonna go to hell theyre all probably right  
I just wanna go to hell my way  
I just wanna do it my way  
I heard the news today  
All about your new romance  
There is always gonna be someone better than me  
I guess I never had a chance  
Yes I heard the news today  
You were livin by the sound of the bell  
I still believe that life gets better when you tell the world to go to hell  
Oh I dont wanna play your game  
I dont wanna live that way  
I dont wanna do what you tell me to do  
I dont fit inside the box youve made  
No I dont wanna play your game  
No I will never live that way  
I dont wanna do what you tell me to do  
I just want to do it my way  
Yes I heard the news today  
Youve got scars on your hands and knees  
You never would have been so ovbious when I was a new disease  
Yes I heard the news today  
You were livin by the sound of a bell  
I still believe that life gets better when you tell the world to go to hell  
Oh I dont wanna play your game

I dont fit inside the box youve made
