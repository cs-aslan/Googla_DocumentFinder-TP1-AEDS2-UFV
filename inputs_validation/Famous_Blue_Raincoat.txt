Its four in the morning the end of December  
Im writing you now just to see if youre better  
New York is cold but I like where Im living  
Theres music on Clinton Street all through the evening  
  
I hear that youre building your little house deep in the desert  
Youre living for nothing now I hope youre keeping some kind of record  
  
Yes and Jane came by with a lock of your hair  
She said that you gave it to her  
That night that you planned to go clear  
Did you ever go clear  
  
Ah the last time we saw you you looked so much older  
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder  
Youd been to the station to meet every train  
And you came home without Lilly Marlene  
  
And you treated my woman to a flake of your life  
And when she came back she was nobodys wife  
  
Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth  
One more thin gypsy thief  
Well I see Janes awake  
  
She sends her regards  
And what can I tell you my brother my killer  
What can I possibly say  
I guess that I miss you I guess I forgive you  
Im glad you stood in my way  
  
If you ever come by here for Jane or for me  
Your enemy is sleeping and his woman is free  
  
Yes and thanks for the trouble you took from her eyes  
I thought it was there for good so I never tried  
  
And Jane came by with a lock of your hair  
She said that you gave it to her  
That night that you planned to go clear
