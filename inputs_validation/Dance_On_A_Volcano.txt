Holy Mother of God  
Youve got to go faster than that to get to the top  
Dirty old mountain  
All covered in smoke she can turn you to stone  
So you better start doing it right  
Better start doing it right  
  
Youre halfway up and youre halfway down  
And the pack on your back is turning you around  
Throw it away you wont need it up there and remember  
You dont look back whatever you do  
Better start doing it right  
  
On your left and on your right  
Crosses are green and crosses are blue  
Your friends didnt make it through  
Out of the night and out of the dark  
Into the fire and into the fight  
Well thats the way the heroes go Ho Ho Ho  
  
Through a crack in Mother Earth  
Blazing hot the molten rock  
Spills out over the land  
And the lavas the lover who licks your boots away Hey Hey Hey  
If you dont want to boil as well  
Bebebetter start the dance  
DDDo you want to dance with me  
  
The musics playing the notes are right  
Put your left foot first and move into the light  
The edge of this hill is the edge of the world  
And if youre going to cross you better start doing it right  
Better start doing it right  
  
Let the dance begin
