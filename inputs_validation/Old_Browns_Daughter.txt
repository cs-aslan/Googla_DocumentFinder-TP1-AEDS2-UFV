There is an ancient party at the other end of town  
And he keeps a little grocery store the ancients name is Brown  
And he has a lovely daughter such a treat I never saw  
Oh I only hope someday to be the old mans soninlaw  
  
Well Old Brown he sells from off his shelf most anything you please  
Hes got juice tarts for the little boys lollipops and cheese  
And his daughter minds the store and its a treat just to see her serve  
Id like to run away with her but I dont have the nerve  
  
Chorus  
And its old Browns daughter is a proper sort of girl  
Old Browns daughter is a fair as any pearl  
I wish I were a Lord Mayor a Marquis or and Earl  
And blow me if I wouldnt marry old Browns girl  
Blow me if I wouldnt marry old Browns girl  
  
Well poor old Brown now has trouble with the gout  
He grumbles in his little parlor when he cant get out  
Oh and when I make a purchase lord and she hands me the change  
That girl she makes pulverized I feel so very strange  
  
Chorus  
  
But Miss Brown she smiles so sweetly when I say a tender word  
Ah but old brown says that she must wed a Marquis or a Lord  
And I dont suppose its ever one of those things I will be  
But by jingo next election I will run for Trinity  
  
Chorus
