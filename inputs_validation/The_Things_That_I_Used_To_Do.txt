The things that I used to do Lord I wont do no more  
The things that I used to do Lord I wont do no more  
I used to sit and hold your hand darlin and cry oh babe do not go  
  
I used to search all night for you darlin  
Lord and my search would always end in vain  
I used to search all night for you darlin  
Lord and my search would always end in vain  
But I knew all the time darlin That you was hid out wit your other man  
  
Im goin to send you back to your mama darlin  
Lord and Im goin back to my family too  
Im goin to send you back to your mama darlin  
Lord and Im goin back to my family too  
Nothin I can do to please ya darlin I just cant get along with you
