I think its starting again  
The same thing that happens when  
Im sure what Im thinking about is right  
But I dont know anything  
The inhibitions decline  
Decided to make up my mind  
Im sure what Im thinking is right  
But I dont know anything  
  
So why are you loking to me for the answers  
Its only the truth if you want to believe in it  
  
Everyone wants to live another life  
So many aspirations have been placed upon you  
Everyone wants to live another life  
So many aspirations have been placed upon you  
  
Im not sure where to begin  
Ive taken a lot on the chin  
And everyone else seems to win  
And I dont have anything  
  
Convinced that this is what you want  
Are you really sure you know it all  
So willing to trust in anyone  
Confused by what they call the truth  
The only thing you know for sure  
Is you dont trust a single thing about yourself  
So who am I to decide  
Ive tried my best and Ive tried
