My Daddy told me lookin back  
The best friend youll have is a railroad track  
So when I was 13 I said Im rollin my own  
And Im leaving Missouri and Im never coming home  
  
And Im lost  
And Im lost  
Im lost at the bottom of the world  
Im handcuffed to the Bishop and the barbershop liar  
Im lost at the bottom of the world  
  
Satchel puddin and Lord God Mose  
Sittin by the fire with a busted nose  
That fresh egg yeller is too damn rare  
But the white part is perfect for slickin down your hair  
  
And Im lost  
And Im lost  
Im lost at the bottom of the world  
Im handcuffed to the Bishop and the barbershop liar  
Im lost at the bottom of the world  
  
Blackjack Ruby and Nimrod Cain  
The moons the color of a coffee stain  
Jesse Franks and Birdy Joe Hoax  
But who is the king of all of these folks  
  
And Im lost  
And Im lost  
Im lost at the bottom of the world  
Im handcuffed to the Bishop and the barbershop liar  
Im lost at the bottom of the world  
  
Well I dined last night with Scarface Ron  
On Telapia fish cakes and fried black swan  
Razorweed onion and peacock squirrel  
And I dreamed all night about a beautiful girl  
  
And Im lost  
And Im lost  
Im lost at the bottom of the world  
Im handcuffed to the Bishop and the barbershop liar  
Im lost at the bottom of the world  
  
Well Gods green hair is where I slept last  
He balanced a diamond on a blade of grass  
Now I woke me up with a cardinal bird  
And when I wanna talk he  
Hangs on every word  
  
And Im lost  
And Im lost  
Im lost at the bottom of the world  
Im handcuffed to the Bishop and the barbershop liar  
Im lost at the bottom of the world
