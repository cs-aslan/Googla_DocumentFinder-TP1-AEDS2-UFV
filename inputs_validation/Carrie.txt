When lights go down I see no reason  
For you to cry Weve been through this before  
In every time in every season  
God knows Ive tried  
So please dont ask for more  
  
Cant you see it in my eyes  
This might be our last goodbye  
  
Carrie Carrie things they change my friend  
Carrie Carrie maybe well meet again  
  
I read your mind with no intentions  
Of being unkind I wish I could explain  
It all takes time a whole lot of patience  
If its a crime how come I feel no pain
