Alamo  
Heard all about your fandango  
Banged on my knees on your back door  
Only to wake you to blues on the way  
Blues on the way  
Blues on the way  
  
Embarcar  
Figures youll see me as older  
Twentythree hours till the border  
Dont think Ill be going as fast as I came  
Fast as I came  
Fast as I came  
  
Tears on my pillow  
Of course theyre not mine  
Alter that altar  
Making a play  
Somebody invent the telephone line  
Ill take mine  
My chances  
  
Alamo  
Wish I could do what gold does  
Heard that the stars were in order  
Got yourself dealt a hand with  
Two queen of spades  
And blues on the way  
Blues on the way  
  
Tears on my pillow  
Of course theyre not mine  
Alter that altar  
Making a play  
Somebody just somebody invent the telephone line  
Ill take my chances
