Two weeks in a Virginia jail  
For my lover for my lover  
Twenty thousand dollar bail  
For my lover for my lover  
  
And everybody thinks  
That Im the fool  
But they dont get  
Any love from you  
The things we wont do for love  
Id climb a mountain if I had to  
And risk my life so I could have you  
You you you  
  
Everyday Im psychoanalyzed  
For my lover for my lover  
They dope me up and I tell them lies  
For my lover for my lover  
  
I follow my heart  
And leave my head to ponder  
Deep in this love  
No man can shake  
  
I follow my heart  
And leave my mind to wonder  
Is this love worth  
The sacrifices I make
