It dont really matter  
Youll find out for yourself  
No it dont really matter  
Youre gonna leave this thing to  
Somebody else  
  
If they missionaries  
Real time visionaries  
Sitting in a Chinese school  
To view my disinfatuation  
I know that Im a classic case  
Watch my disenchanted face  
Blame it on the Falun Gong  
Theyve seen the end and you cant hold on now  
  
Cause it would take a lot more hate than you  
To stop the fascination  
Even with an iron fist  
Our baby got to rule the nation  
But all I got is precious time  
  
It dont really matter  
Youre gonna find out for yourself  
No it dont really matter  
So you can hear now from  
Somebody else  
  
Cause it would take a lot more time than you  
Ive got more masturbation  
Even with your iron fist  
More than you got to rule the nation  
But all I got is precious time  
More than you got to rule the nation  
But all I got is precious time  
  
It dont really matter  
Gonna keep it to myself  
No it dont really matter  
So you can hear it now from  
Somebody else  
  
You think you got it all locked up inside  
And if you beat them all up theyll die  
Then youll walk them home for the cells  
Then now youll dig for your road back to hell  
And with your  makes you stop  
As if your eyes were their eyes you can tell  
In your lack of time
