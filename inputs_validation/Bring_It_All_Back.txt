Id been carving you  
To see what form youd take  
You were hiding in ivory  
I just wanted to free you shape  
  
Bringing me down its too quiet to breathe  
Who wants to hear their heart beat  
  
Its gotta be here  
In your spiderweb alphabets  
Did I read it all wrong  
Or have I just not gotten it yet  
  
You got what you want You wanted release  
Can you be appeased Can you bring it all back to me  
Bring it all back to me  
  
Bringing me down the obvious turned out to be true  
All that I couldnt see how it was turning me on  
I dont want to pare you down  
No I dont want to wear you down  
I dont want any more than whats here  
No I dont want to pare you down  
  
Well you got what you want You wanted release  
Can you be appeased Can you bring it all back to me  
Just bring Just bring it all back to me  
  
Its all that I want  
Its all that I need  
Its all that I want  
  
Bring it all back to me  
Bring it give it bring it
