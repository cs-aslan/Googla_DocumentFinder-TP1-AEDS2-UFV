Johnny come lately on a Saturday night  
Singin howdedo  
Backstreet boogie in the house of delight  
Where they steal the show  
The money come sour but the ladies are sweet  
And its a love affair  
Whole place rockin people stompin their feet  
When the gangs all there  
He gets his lovin every night for free  
Hes out there rockin like you wouldnt believe  
I sing na na na na na  
Na na na na na  
Johnny liked to gamble with his lady Louise  
She was a blackjack deuces are wild  
He got to thinkin bout his nose in the breeze  
Johnny looked and he smiled  
He started thinkin bout the fortune and fame  
And the young girls down at his knees  
He dug the money but forgot all the names  
So he knew just how to appease  
Lick and a promise  
Lick and a promise  
Lick and a promise  
He gave the ladies a lick and a promise  
Loose change clover in his early early years  
Had his poor mama pacin the floors  
He grabbed a guitar and a couple of beers  
Now the crowd keeps screamin for more
