Am I asking for the moon  
Is it really so implausible  
That you and I could soon  
Come to some kind of arrangement  
  
Im not asking for the moon  
Ive always been a realist  
When its really nothing more  
Than a simple rearrangement  
  
With one roof above our heads  
A warm house to return to  
We could start with separate beds  
I could sleep alone or learn to  
Im not suggesting that wed find  
Some earthly paradise forever  
I mean how often does that happen now  
The answers probably never  
But we could come to an arrangement  
A practical arrangement  
And you could learn to love me  
Given time  
  
Im not promising the moon  
Im not promising a rainbow  
Just a practical solution  
To a solitary life  
  
Id be a father to your boy  
A shoulder you could lean on  
How bad could it be  
To be my wife  
  
With one roof above our heads  
A warm house to return to  
You wouldnt have to cook for me  
You wouldnt have to learn to  
Im not suggesting that this proposition here  
Could last forever  
Ive no intention of deceiving you  
Youre far too clever  
But we could come to an arrangement  
A practical arrangement  
And perhaps youd learn to love me  
Given time  
  
It may not be the romance  
That you had in mind  
But you could learn to love me  
Given time
