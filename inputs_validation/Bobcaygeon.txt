I left your house this morning  
Bout a quarter after nine  
Coulda been the Willie Nelson  
Coulda been the wine  
  
When I left your house this morning  
It was a little after nine  
It was in Bobcaygeon I saw the constellations  
Reveal themselves one star at time  
  
Drove back to town this morning  
With working on my mind  
I thought of maybe quittin  
Thought of leavin it behind  
  
Went back to bed this morning  
And as Im pullin down the blind  
Yeah the sky was dull and hypothetical  
And fallin one cloud at a time  
  
That night in Toronto  
With its checkerboard floors  
Riding on horseback  
And keeping order restored  
Til The Men They Couldnt Hang  
Stepped to the mic and sang  
And their voices rang with that Aryan twang  
  
I got to your house this morning  
Just a little after nine  
In the middle of that riot  
Couldnt get you off my mind  
  
So Im at your house this morning  
Just a little after nine  
Cause it was in Bobcaygeon  
Where I saw the constellations reveal themselves  
One star at time
