Got me a date with a supermodel Ha ha ha  
I know I know I figured Fuck it  
Dinner at the hotel champagne bottle  
Steak and potatoes a feather in a bucket  
  
Tell me what is it were pretendin  
Not to know and who needs proof  
I dont need so much to remember  
No no Thats how it is when you tell the truth  
Woo  
  
How many times does somebody lie  
Til patience Ahhahhahh runs her course  
Keep that in mind when we say goodbye  
Cuz you cant Ahhahhahh get this stuff no more  
  
Thats the thing about selfimprovement  
Dont get me wrong I plan on gettin some soon  
Outside the wire somethins movin  
The barn burnt down now I can see the moon  
  
A slice at a time like a pizza pie  
You Ahhahhahh serve up the truth dont want it anymore  
Keep that in mind when we say goodbye  
Cuz you cant Ahhahhahh get this stuff no more  
  
Woo  
  
How many times does somebody lie  
Fore Ahhahhahh patience runs her course  
Keep that in mind when we say goodbye  
Cuz you cant Ahhahhahh get this stuff no more  
  
A slice at a time Whaoh yeah  
  
Whaoh Ahhahhahh Cant get that stuff no more  
Better keep that in mind Keep it in mind  
When we say our goodbyes  
Cuz you cant get this stuff no moreah
