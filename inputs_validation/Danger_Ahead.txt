Here she comes down the street and that look is in her eye  
And the way she looks if looks could kill they might  
All the kids down in the street run away  
When she goes by its the end of the day  
So believe what they say theres danger in the air  
  
Look through a window and youll see her standing there  
Shes the latest of the greatest with the wind blowin in her hair  
The prima donna shes back in town  
And you see her for miles around  
So believe what they say theres danger in the air  
  
Beware theres danger ahead  
The endless summer is dead  
Look out theres danger ahead  
  
Monday mornin shes already up and gone  
She knows what she wants and she knew it all along  
With her entourage on either side  
Just one look she cant be denied  
So believe what they say theres danger in the air  
  
Beware theres danger ahead  
The endless summer is dead  
Look out theres danger ahead  
  
Shes got a reputation thats way ahead of her time  
Shes got adulation thats way ahead of her mind  
Everybody runs around to please  
When she looks in the mirror she just has to freeze  
So believe what they say theres danger in the air  
  
Beware theres danger ahead  
The endless summer is dead  
Look out theres danger ahead
