Im going down to the river gonna take me my rocking chair  
Going down to the river gonna take me my rocking chair  
And if those blues dont leave me  
Gonna rock on away from here  
  
If you want me woman please dont act so shy  
If you want me woman please dont pass me by  
I love those sideways glances  
Your shoulder and your thigh  
  
I see inside your eyes the Babas Sai  
The reasons why I love you  
  
So if youre still busy hiding  
What it is youve got  
If youre frightened of losing  
What you like a lot  
You may be cruisin backwards  
While thinking that youre not  
  
I see into your eyes the Baba Sais  
The reasons why I love you  
  
So if you dont get the picture  
You wont know what I feel  
If you dont get the picture  
Then you wont have a depth of field  
You may be going someplace  
Someplace youve already been
