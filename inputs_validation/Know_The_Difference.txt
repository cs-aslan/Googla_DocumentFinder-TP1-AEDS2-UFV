Youre driving all over town  
In your big car  
Windows down  
Sweet perfume trails behind  
The impression is in my mind  
Its crazy how much I ache  
for the moments we could make  
Your girlfriends they like to talk  
Yeah they told me about your boy  
  
Chorus  
What you do and what you say  
Do you know the difference any way  
  
Could I show you whats in store  
Cause I know youll be wanting more  
Youre the kind of girl who knows  
What you want and where it goes  
  
You got instinct  
You got class  
Why dont you leave that guy on his ass  
Good intensions are not enough  
We should join hands and rise above  
  
Chorus  
  
Its crazy how much I ache  
For the moments we could make  
Your girlfriends they like to talk  
Yeah they told me about your boy  
  
Youre driving all over town  
In your big car  
Windows down  
Sweet perfume trails behind  
The impression is on my mind  
  
Chorus
