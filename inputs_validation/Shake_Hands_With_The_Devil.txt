I know some people say that Im the devil in disguise  
I wont try to tell you that I aint  
I dont like believing that Im evil in your eyes  
but I aint make believing Im a saint  
cause Ill do anything I can to win you from the world  
its something that my senses cant control  
And if thats sin then shake hands with the devil little girl  
I want your body and your soul  
  
CHORUS  
Shake hands with the devil dont be frightened I wont hurt you  
I dont want your silver or your gold  
Im not after anything that you dont want to give me  
I just want your body and your soul  
Other men can offer something peaceful and secure  
I cant offer anything but me  
I can take you higher than youve ever been before  
and show you things you never dared to see  
And hand in hand together we can laugh the world away  
Ill keep you from the hunger and the cold  
So let your love come easy you dont need to be afraid  
I just want your body and your soul  
  
CHORUS  
Shake hands with the devil
