Surrounded by people  
A real heavy crowd  
But inside I still feel lonely now  
  
Should I get away  
From the high heels so proud  
Is there something different life can show me now  
  
First chance  I blew it I better start it all again  
Second chance  Ooh I knew it wouldnt be as easy as they said  
Third chance  Im cut up lifes like a razors edge  
Fourth chance  Ooh Im all shut up and Im standing on the ledge  
  
And Im goin down Im goin down  
Goin down Im goin down  
Goin down Im goin down  
Ooh down  
  
Im not a loser  
But did I really win  
Can I afford to go through it all again  
  
I hope I dont sound  
As immature as I feel  
But when I get wise Ill give you a call my friend  
  
First chance  I blew it I better start it all again  
Second chance  Ooh I knew it wouldnt be as easy as they said  
Third chance  Im cut up lifes like a razors edge  
Fourth chance  Im all shut up and Im standing on the ledge  
  
Now Im goin down Im goin down  
Goin down Im goin down  
Goin down Im goin down  
Ooh down down  
  
Love is coming down on me ooh yeah  
Love is burning teaching turning out in me  
Love is coming down down  
Down down  
Down down  
  
Im not a loser  
But did I really win  
Im lookin forward to doin it all again
