Well sitting in a bar alone  
Where noone knows your name  
Is like laying in a graveyard  
Wide awake  
Youre scared that if you cough or yawn  
You might wake up the dead  
So pretend to read a paper  
Or just drink instead  
  
Im a standup comedian  
But Id sit down if I could  
The world just seems  
To want folk like me to stand  
And the punchlines seem to disappear  
Like clouds across the sky  
And the laughter could be real  
Or could be canned  
  
Rum by the kettle drum  
Whiskey by the jar  
At Liars Bar  
  
Well living with a lying man  
Could never really hurt  
But living with a drunk  
Well noone deserves  
And youre looking for your husband  
Youre not sure hes still alive  
Dont bother with the cemetery  
Hell be down at liars dive  
  
Im a traveling businessman  
I just stopped in for one drink  
Youll find  
That Im not like the other men  
Their noses are red  
Whilst mine is only pink  
And they didnt choose their drink  
Their drink chose them  
  
Rum by the kettle drum  
Whiskey by the jar  
At Liars Bar  
  
And the gravediggers smiling  
At his reflection in his spade  
Hes visiting the seediest  
The shallowest of graves  
The vocal chords of elephants  
And the characters of mice  
Theyre singing whiskey whiskey  
So good they named it twice  
  
Well dont pass buildings with lights on  
If I said that I did Id have lied  
Cause what looks like a Chinese restaurant  
May have Chinese New Year inside  
And son all my life Ive been searching  
The bars Ive been in I forget  
The lights outside ever brighter  
But a light on the inside not yet  
  
Rum by the kettle drum  
Whiskey by the jar  
At Liars Bar  
  
And hes a worldwide traveler  
Hes not like me or you  
But he comes in mighty regular  
For one whos passing through  
That one came in his work clothes  
Hes missed his last bus home  
Hes missed a hell of a lot of buses  
For a man who wants to roam  
  
If I look rough I am rough  
If I look sad I am  
If I look broke I am broke  
Just a broke down piece of man  
  
Ive turned over enough leaves  
To fill an autumn  
And if I had one final wish  
Id be your slave for a decade  
If you could take me away from this  
If you took me away from this  
Id be different youd see  
Cause I didnt choose the drink  
A drink just chose me  
  
Rum by the kettle drum  
Whiskey by the jar  
At Liars Bar  
  
Well Im smoking like a chimney  
And Im drinking like a fish  
At Liars Bar
