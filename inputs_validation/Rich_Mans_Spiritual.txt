Gonna buy me a long white robe  
Yes Lord to help me home  
Im gonna buy me a long white robe  
Yes Lord to get me home  
And when I get my heavenly gown  
And I lay my burden down  
Im gonna get me a long white robe  
To get me home  
  
Im gonna buy me two golden slippers  
Yes Lord to walk me home  
Im gonna buy me two golden slippers  
Yes Lord to walk me home  
And when I get my slippers of gold  
Then the Lord will have my soul  
Im gonna get me two golden slippers  
To get me home  
  
Im gonna buy me two wings of silver  
Yes Lord to fly me home  
Im gonna buy me two wings of silver  
Yes Lord to fly me home  
And when I get my silvery wings  
Then an angel choir will sing  
Im gonna get me two wings of silver  
To get me home  
  
Im gonna buy me a poor mans trouble  
Yes Lord to help me home  
Im gonna buy me a poor mans trouble  
Yes Lord to help me home  
And when I get my trouble and woe  
Then homeward I will go  
Im gonna get a little trouble  
And woe to get me home  
  
Im gonna find me a smilin angel  
Yes Lord to lead me home  
Im gonna get me a smilin angel  
Yes Lord to lead me home  
And when he takes me by the hand  
I know the Lord will understand  
Im gonna get me a smilin angel to lead me home  
Im gonna get me a smilin angel to lead me home
