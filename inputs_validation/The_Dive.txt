When I wake up feeling victimized  
There is nothing  
That can stop my eyes  
From crying  
  
When you put the pressure  
Down on me  
Cause I dont quite fit  
You imagery  
Im trying  
  
Baby Im no superman  
  
Chorus  
Eyes like a deep blue sea  
To dive in  
Love that you give to me  
Were surviving  
Surviving  
When love is gone  
I cant carry on  
  
When you know that love  
Is on my mind  
Its a perfect chance  
To be unkind  
You do it  
  
Being sly you take a chance  
On crime  
But the master has a new design  
On loving living  
Out and in the enemy  
  
Chorus  
  
Eyes that open wide  
Do you do  
Love you give the child  
Do you do  
Why do you do that to me  
  
When I wake up feeling victimized  
There is nothing  
That can stop my eyes  
From crying  
  
When you put the pressure  
Down on me  
Cause I dont quite fit  
Your imagery  
Im trying  
  
Im no superman  
  
Chorus
