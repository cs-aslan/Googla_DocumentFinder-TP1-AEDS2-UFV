When the darkness closes in  
And Im on my knees again  
  
I call Your Name  
I call Your Name  
Cause it is the sweetest Name I know  
Jesus  
  
When my soul begins to soar  
And my heart longs for more  
I call on Your Name  
I call on Your Name  
I call on Your Name  
Jesus  
  
Theres power in  
The Name above all other names  
Jesus  
  
Theres healing in  
The Name above all other names  
Jesus  
  
Theres freedom in  
The Name above all other names  
Jesus  
  
Theres power in  
The Name above all other names  
Jesus
