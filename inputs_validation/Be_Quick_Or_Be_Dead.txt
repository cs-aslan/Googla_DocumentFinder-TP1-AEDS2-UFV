Covered in sinners and dripping  
With gilt  
Making you money from slime  
And from filth  
Parading your bellies in ivory towers  
Investing our lives in your schemes  
And your powers  
  
You got to watch them  
Be quick  
Or be dead  
Snake eyes in heaven  
The thief  
In your head  
Youve got to watch them  
Be quick  
Or be dead  
Snake eyes in heaven  
The thief  
In your head  
Be quick  
Or be dead  
Be quick  
Or be dead  
  
See whats ruling all our lives  
See whos pulling the strings  
I bet you wont fall on your face  
Your belly will hold you in place  
  
The serpent is crawling inside of  
Your ear  
He says you must vote for what you  
Want to hear  
Dont matter whats wrong as long as youre  
Alright  
So pull yourself stupid and rob  
Yourself blind
