Ive got a lover way over there on the mountain side  
And I know thats where I should be  
Dont you know  
Ive got a lover way over there across the river wide  
I can hear her calling to me  
Oh shes calling my name  
So sweet so plain I can hear her saying  
Come to me baby  
Im on my way  
Come to me baby  
Im gonna stay  
Come to me baby  
  
They tell me that the rivers too deep  
And its much too wide  
Boy you cant get over to the other side  
But they dont know I got to get there  
And hold her in my arms just one more time  
Like I did before when she was mine all mine  
Cause I hear her saying  
Come to me baby  
Im on my way  
Come to me baby  
Im gonna stay  
Im gonna get to you  
No matter what I have to do
