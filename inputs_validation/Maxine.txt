I happened to notice a girl in a light shade of blue  
I happened to see her the sight of her leaves me confused  
  
She may not be you But she looks just like you  
She may not be you But she looks just like you  
  
You shouldve seen the way she wore her dress  
And her white stiletto shoes  
You shouldve seen the way they looked on her  
Just like the ones that I bought you  
I searched for days on end to no avail til I found them in Peru  
She mustve been to Lima just as well  
Because she had them too  
  
You shouldve seen her eyes her lips her face  
She looked as sweet as honeydew  
You shouldve seen the way she walked away  
Oh she swayed her hips like you  
  
I was only several steps from her but she never noticed me  
I took another sip of fine liqueur  
It was quite a sight to see  
  
I happened to notice the girl in the light shade of blue  
I happened to see her the sight of her leaves me confused  
  
She may not be you But she looks just like you  
She may not be you But she looks just like you  
  
Oh you shouldve seen the way he stroked her hair  
And the smile that lit her face  
You shoudve seen the way he kissed her lips  
Did it have the same sweet taste  
  
Though my mind it might be running wild in constant search of you  
Its funny how my eyes keep seeing things my heart would not believe are true  
  
I happened to notice a girl in a light shade of blue  
I happened to see her the sight of her leaves me confused  
  
She may not be you But she looks just like you  
She may not be you But she looks just like you  
  
I happened to notice a man in a dark shade of blue  
Who happened to be with a woman who leaves me confused  
She may not be you but she looks just like you  
  
Maxine she looks just like you  
Maxine she looks just like you  
Maxine Maxine Maxine Maxine  
Maxine Maxine Maxine Maxine
