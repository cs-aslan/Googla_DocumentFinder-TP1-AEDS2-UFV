Lyrics by Jimmy Buffett  
Music by Buffett Kunkel Guth P Mayer J Mayer  
Im a cultural infidel painting in the dark  
Im a cultural infidel singing in the park  
Socrates hypothesis the music of Mozart  
Im a cultural infidel coming from the heart  
  
Free thinkin hoodwinkin unblinkin man  
Start trouble burst bubbles join my caravan  
Someones got to talk about accountability  
Someones got to raise some hell I guess it could be me  
  
Im a cultural infidel trying to draw a crowd  
Im a cultural infidel singing right out loud  
Philosophy is not for me laughing is my game  
Im a cultural infidel slap me with the blame  
  
Loose cannon Armageddon preachers at the door  
Spittin poison at the boys n girls on dance floor  
I hear them in the congress I see them on TV  
I hope the Inquisition remains a memory  
  
AlDiablo Picasso AlDiablo Manet  
AlDiablo Fontainebleau AlDiable Hemingway  
ODiab Dr Thompson ODiab St Joan  
ODiab Village Paeople ODiab Rolling Stones  
Someones got to talk about accountability  
Someones got to raise some hell it might as well be me  
  
Im a cultural infidel believe in common sense  
Im a cultural infidel love the present tense  
But we have to keep a look out for those mean old backedup farts  
Im a cultural infidel comin from the heart  
  
My heart my heart mon coeur  
Will I see you in Heaven will I see you in Hell  
Will I see you in Rio only time will tell  
  
Will I see you in Heaven will I see you in Hell  
Will I see you tomorrow only time will tell
