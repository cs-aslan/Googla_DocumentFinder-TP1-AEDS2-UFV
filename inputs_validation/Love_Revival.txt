Now I know what you need  
And you know what I need  
The whole dang block knows this whole house needs  
A love revival love revival up in here  
Now I know Im preaching  
Cause Im certainly not leavin  
But its time to get excited and the neighbors arent invited  
To this love revival love revival up in here  
So sit up and listen boy  
Cause Im tired of being nice  
Now Mommas gonna tell you what she needs tonight  
  
Chorus  
Revival Revival  
Well give me something soulful  
Honey all I need are your two arms around me again  
So if youre in this till the end  
Then let the love revival begin  
  
I feel the spirit  
The spirits moving  
I feel the spirit movin  
  
So I pray you wont deny me  
Now that Ive said my peace  
And Ill say it again son  
Just in case you were asleep  
I want a love revival love revival up in here  
Cause I know what you need and you know what I need  
This whole dang block knows  
This whole house needs  
A love revival love revival up in here  
So sit up and listen boy cause Im tired of bein nice  
Now Mommas gonna tell you what she needs tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
Well were both in this till the end  
So let the love revival begin  
I feel the spirit  
The spirits moving  
I feel the spirit  
The spirits moving  
I feel the spirit  
The spirits moving  
I feel the spirit  
The spirits moving
