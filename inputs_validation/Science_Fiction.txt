Hm just like science fiction no one knows what the fuck theyre talking  
About heh theres always one in every crowd  
  
There is always one in every crowd  
You can hear the voices when youre alone  
They sound like metal on metal  
Obnoxious and loud  
  
Dont let go  
Dont listen to the sound  
Of those people you know  
Slowly falling apart  
And falling down now  
Everything is falling down now  
Now now now  
  
When I think Im alone  
I watch the news  
On my girlfriends TV  
Its like a bad Bmovie  
Aw sometimes I cant comprehend  
All the stupid things that I see  
  
So dont let go  
You cant believe your eyes  
Yeah when everything they show you  
Just makes you want to cry  
And you dont want to know  
That you need to remember  
Life is always getting better  
Better better  
So dont let go  
Go go go  
  
There is always one in every crowd  
Yeah you see them when you think youre alone  
It all just seems like science fiction  
No one knows what they are talking about  
  
So dont let go  
Dont listen to the sound  
Of those people you know  
Slowly falling apart  
And falling down now  
  
You need to remember  
Life is always getting better  
Life is always getting better  
Life is always getting better  
For a while
