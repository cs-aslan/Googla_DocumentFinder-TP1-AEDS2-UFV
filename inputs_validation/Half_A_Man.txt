I can chop wood from dusk till dawn  
I can swing a hammer till the daylights gone  
I can build a barn I can make a home with these two hands  
But if I didnt have all your love Id be half a man  
  
I can fly a plane up in the big blue sky  
Blaze a trail through the woods in my fourwheel drive  
With a team of horses or an old John Deere I can plow this land  
But if I didnt have all your love Id be half a man  
  
I can hang the stars I can rope the moon  
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots  
I can run a train till it runs out of track  
With the weight of the world laid across my back  
My life still wouldnt be worth a damn  
If I didnt have all your love Id be half a man  
  
I can build a fire with nothin but a stick  
If I put my mind to it there aint much I cant fix  
I can read an count I can figure things out if you give me a chance  
But if I didnt have all your love Id be half a man  
  
I can hang the stars I can rope the moon  
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots  
I can run a train till it runs out of track  
With the weight of the world laid across my back  
An my life still wouldnt be worth a damn  
If I didnt have all your love Id be half a man  
  
Whoa I can hang the stars I can rope the moon  
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots  
I can run a train till it runs out of track  
With the weight of the world laid across my back  
But my life still wouldnt be worth a damn  
If I didnt have all your love Id be half a man  
If I didnt have all your love Id be half a man  
Ah ha whoa yeah hmm hmm hmm
