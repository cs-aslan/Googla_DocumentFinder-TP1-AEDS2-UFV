Chorus x2  
I got my locs on  
I got my locs on  
And you cant see my eyes  
And you cant see my eyes  
I got my locs on  
I got my locs on  
And you cant tell Im high  
And you cant tell Im high  
  
Verse 1 Ice Cube  
I got my locs on welcome to the terror dome  
I got them carrots on givin off them pheromones  
Women love it when the see me on that motorcycle  
Niggas hate it cause they know Im makin more than Michael  
Been ballin since the word ballin played out  
They brought it back to describe me in that Maybach  
Me and Jeezy Jeezy rollin with our locs on  
Smokin somethin good fuckin up the ozone  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Verse 2 Young Jeezy  
Brand new Versaces ran me a buck 50  
They must have set you back no baby not really  
Switchin lanes yes yea the choppers just silly  
When its bustin at your ass we just laughin at ya really  
I got my locs on dickies on keep the workin niggas on  
Keep the cashmere vickis on yea she keep them vickis on  
Keep my locs on see you hatin mother fuckers keep my locs on you know they
match my bag suckers  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I got my locs on cause my eyes are burgundy  
And when I get home I dont want the third degree  
The verdict be urgently these niggas wanna murder me  
They scared of the consequences comin from my defenses  
It aint that expensive have your ass hoppin fences  
Lucky motherfucker missed your ass by some inches  
Next time understand what you fuckin with its legendary status  
Sittin behind these glasses nigga  
  
Chorus x2
