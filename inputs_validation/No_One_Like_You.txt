Girl its been a long time that weve been apart  
Much too long for a man who needs love  
I miss you since Ive been away  
Babe it wasnt easy to leave you alone  
Its getting harder each time that I go  
If I had the choice I would stay  
  
Theres no one like you  
I cant wait for the nights with you  
I imagine the things well do  
I just want to be loved by you  
  
No one like you  
I cant wait for the nights with you  
I imagine the things well do  
I just want to be loved by you  
  
Girl there are really no words strong enough  
To describe all my longing for love  
I dont want my feelings restrained  
Oh babe I just need you like never before  
Just imagine youd come through this door  
Youd take all my sorrow away  
  
Theres no one like you  
I cant wait for the nights with you  
I imagine the things well do  
I just want to be loved by you  
  
No one like you  
I cant wait for the nights with you  
I imagine the things well do  
I just want to be loved by you  
  
No one like you
