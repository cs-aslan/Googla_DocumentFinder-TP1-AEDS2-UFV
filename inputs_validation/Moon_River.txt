Moon River wider than a mile  
Im crossing you in style someday  
Oh dream maker you heartbreaker  
Wherever youre going Im going your way  
Two drifters off to see the world  
Theres such a lot of world to see  
Were after the same rainbows end  
Waiting round the bend  
My huckleberry friend Moon River and me  
Moon River off to see the world  
Theres such a lot of world to see  
Were after the same rainbows end  
Waiting round the bend  
My huckleberry friend Moon River and me
