Facing forwards sinking in thin air  
Help me to learn to breath again  
I know Ive lost my way  
So show me  
  
There are demons inside my head  
I always let them win  
I have to learn to suffocate them  
  
The lost ask for a hand  
But I cant stop I never stop  
  
Ive been losing my footing here  
Im all mixed up in this  
I need some kind of change  
God make it stop I cant make it stop  
This place is getting smaller  
  
Everything in your darkest thoughts about me might be true  
I hear the words you say I still feel nothing  
I put my voice out there for you to hear  
But the words never made much sense to you  
  
Ive lost my path  
Im fading fast  
  
Time is short  
Time is up  
  
Ive been losing my footing here  
Im all mixed up in this  
I need some kind of change  
God make it stop I cant make it stop  
This place is getting smaller  
  
This is really my plan  
To get out in one piece  
Is this really your plan  
To keep me lost and on my knees  
  
I say redemption  
Can someone help me hold on
