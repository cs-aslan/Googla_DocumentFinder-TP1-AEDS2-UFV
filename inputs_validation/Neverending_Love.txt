Chasing your shadow  
The senses together  
Fourleafed and clever  
I come from behind  
  
Chasing your shadow  
I wander in circles  
Youre one in a million  
Were two of a kind  
  
Its you that I long for  
Its you that I hunger  
Oh you are the maker of waves in my mind  
We dance in the moonlight  
  
A run on the wire  
Drawing a fine line  
A neverending love  
The fever turns slowly into a fire  
  
Drawing a fine line  
A neverending love  
Chasing your shadow  
Moon and the water  
  
Field and the reaper  
Star and the sky  
Chasing your shadow  
Hammer and heartbeat  
  
Clay and new concrete  
I follow the signs  
Its you that I long for  
Its you that I hunger  
  
And you are the maker of waves in my mind  
We dance in the moonlight
