Verse 1  
In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face  
From the deepest part of my regret  
I hear the words I wish Id said  
At the dawning of the day  
I cant wait to see the light  
Make up memories in my head  
They help to fill the emptiness youve left  
  
Hook  
I cant drown in your tears  
I wont face your fears  
I need to fight my own  
  
Chorus  
Youll never see me again oh baby in time  
Let the wait take me under  
I know Ill survive  
Youll never see me again
