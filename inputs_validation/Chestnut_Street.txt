Well Ive lived and breathed and been disbelieved  
In these small town streets too long  
Ive been up with the winners and down with the sinners  
And hung on this corner til dawn  
And my hands they have been tied  
To a life Ive been denied  
Im just a small town boy bein used like a toy  
And workin from nine to five  
  
By the end of the day all the kids would go play  
And Id come staggering home  
With a dream in my hand and a master plan  
That woulnt leave my mind alone  
I compromised all my schemes  
And flucturated all my dreams  
Im just a small town boy bein used like a toy  
And nothing is like it really seems  
  
Bridge  
  
But you must believe that when I walk down the tracks  
The young girls fall back and say  
There goes that sleek young silhouette  
He dont drive no Corvette  
But he stings just like a Sting Ray  
And thats my only redemption in this house of detention  
That keeps me from simply blowin it all away  
Cause when I walk down the street in the hot summer heat  
I say God dont take this away  
  
I keep hopin and wishin that these romantic positions  
Gonna help me hide my pain  
And all the hurt that Ive felt underneath my leather studded belt  
Of not finding fortune and fame  
But some day Ill blow em away with the things that I may sing and  
Might say  
Im just a small town boy bein used like a toy  
And waitin for my pay dirt day  
  
Im just a small town boy bein used like a toy  
And waitin for my pay day
