Ive been watching you from a distance  
That distance sees through your disguise  
All I want from you is your hurting  
I want to heal you  
I want to save you from the dark  
  
Give unto me your troubles  
Ill endure your suffering  
Place onto me your burden  
Ill drink your deadly poison  
  
Why should I care if they hurt you  
Somehow it matters more to me  
Than if I were hurting myself  
Save you save you  
Ill save you  
  
Give unto me your troubles  
Ill endure your suffering  
Place onto me your burden  
Ill drink your deadly poison  
  
Fear not the flame of my loves candle  
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness  
Give unto me all that frightens you  
Ill have your nightmares for you  
If you sleep soundly  
  
Give unto me your troubles  
Ill endure your suffering  
Place onto me your burden  
Ill drink your deadly poison  
  
Fear not the flame of my loves candle  
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness  
Give unto me all that frightens you  
Ill have your nightmares for you  
If you sleep soundly  
  
Fear not the flame of my loves candle  
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness
