Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass  
You know his faults now let the foibles pass  
Life is one long enigma my friend  
So read on read on the answers at the end  
  
Dont be so hard on the ones that you love  
Its the ones that you love we think so little of  
dont be so hard on the ones that you need  
Its the ones that you need we think so little of  
  
The speech of flowers excels the flowers of speech  
But whats often in your heart is the hardest thing to reach  
And life is one long mystery my friend  
So live on live on the answers at the end  
  
Dont be so hard on the ones that you love  
Its the ones that you love we think so little of  
dont be so hard on the ones that you need  
Its the ones that you need we think so little of  
  
Dont be so hard on the ones that you love  
Its the ones that you love we think so little of  
dont be so hard on the ones that you need  
Its the ones that you need we think so little of  
  
Oh we think so little of the ones that we love sometimes  
isnt it a pity how we hurt  
The ones that we love the most of all  
The ones we shouldnt hurt at all  
  
You know my faults now let the foibles pass  
cause life is one long enigma my friend  
Live on live on the answers at the end

The ones that we love  
We hurt the most of all sometimes  
And isnt it a pity how  
We hurt the ones that we love fade
