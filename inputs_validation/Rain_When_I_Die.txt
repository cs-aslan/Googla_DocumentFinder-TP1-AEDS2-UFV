Is she ready to know my frustration  
What she slippin inside slow castration  
Im a riddle so strong you cant break me  
Did she come here to try try to take me  
Did she call my name  
I think its gonna rain  
When I die  
Was it something I said held against me  
Aint no life on the run slowly climbing  
Caught in ice so she stares stares at nothing  
I can help her but wont now she hates me  
She wont let me hide  
She dont want me to cry  
Will she keep on the ground trying to ground me  
Slowly forgive my lie lying to save me  
Could she love me again or will she hate me  
Probly not I know why cant explain me  
Did she call my name  
I think its gonna rain  
When I die
