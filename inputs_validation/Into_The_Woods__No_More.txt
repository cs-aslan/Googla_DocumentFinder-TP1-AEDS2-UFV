Baker  
No more questions  
Please  
No more tests  
Comes the day you say What for  
Please no more  
  
Mysterious man  
They disappoint  
They disappear  
They die but they dont  
  
Baker  
What  
  
Mysterious man  
They disappoint  
In turn I fear  
Forgive though they wont  
  
Baker  
No more riddles  
No more jests  
No more curses you cant undo  
Left by fathers you never knew  
No more quests  
  
No more feelings  
Time to shut the door  
Just no more  
  
Mysterious man  
Running away lets do it  
Free from the ties that bind  
No more despair  
Or burdens to bear  
Out there in the yonder  
  
Running away go to it  
Where did you have in mind  
Have to take care  
Unless theres a where  
Youll only be wandering blind  
Just more questions  
Different kind  
  
Where are we to go  
Where are we ever to go  
  
Running away well do it  
Why sit around resigned  
Trouble is son  
The farther you run  
The more youll feel undefined  
For what you have left undone  
And more what youve left behind  
  
We disappoint  
We leave a mess  
We die but we dont  
  
Baker  
We disappoint  
In turn I guess  
Forget though we wont  
  
Both  
Like father like son  
  
Baker  
No more giants  
Waging war  
Cant we just pursue out lives  
With out children and our wives  
Till that happy day arrives  
How do you ignore  
All the witches  
All the curses  
All the wolves all the lies  
The false hopes the goodbyes  
The reverses  
All the wondering what even worse is  
Still in store  
  
All the children  
All the giants  
  
No more
