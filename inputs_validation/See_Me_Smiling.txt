The sun comes up and you are all over my mind  
Youre in my brain before I can open my eyes  
As I go on without you  
My heartbeat wont slow down  
I need you back like I need air to breath this out  
  
All I can do is keep you closer now  
Cause I know youre somewhere out there looking down  
Wherever you are wherever you are  
I hope you can see me smiling  
  
The sky gets dark  
I watch the water here at home  
Its ten years now and Im still learning to let go  
Its not the same without you  
Theres no one keeping time  
You were the rhythm that was bringing us to life  
  
All I can do is keep you closer now  
Cause I know youre somewhere out there looking down  
Wherever you are wherever you are  
I hope you can see me smiling now  
I hope you can see me smiling  
  
Sometimes I cant help but think that I  
Have you right behind me all the this time  
If only you could have a chance to see  
All the happiness you gave to me  
  
All I can do is keep you closer now  
Cause I know youre somewhere out there looking down  
Wherever you are wherever you are  
I hope you can see me smiling now  
I hope you can see me smiling now  
I hope you can see me smiling
