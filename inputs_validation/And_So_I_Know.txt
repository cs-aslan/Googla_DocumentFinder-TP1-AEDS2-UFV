And so I know its begun again  
Never be the same and with that I said  
Never ever be this way again Campfire girls make me feel alright  
Hold on till the end like its the last hello  
Whirlwinds and rollercoasters  
Long grass making shapes hello  
Disappearing disappearing floating graves  
  
Never ever ever ever be this way again  
Never ever be this way again  
  
And so I know Its begun again  
Never be the same again and with that I said  
  
Campfire girls make me feel alright  
Campfire girls make me feel alright
