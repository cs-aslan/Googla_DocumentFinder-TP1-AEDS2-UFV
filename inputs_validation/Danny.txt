Here in the dark  
Silence is much too hard to bear  
Dont know where to start  
Im hurtin everywhere  
If we dont stop now  
Were gonna lose  
We should try somehow  
Cause its too easy to bruise  
  
When you take your mark  
Danny with your aim  
Danny for my heart  
Its only pain  
What does it prove  
Again and again  
Danny nobody wins  
  
If its your pride  
Promise you wont let it keep us apart  
Deep down inside  
We can make a new start  
If we dont look back  
On the price we pay  
Well thats all I ask  
Cause well never make it this way  
  
When you take your mark  
Danny with your aim  
Danny for my heart  
Its only pain  
What does it prove  
Again and again  
Danny nobody wins
