Have you been listening  
Listen to the music  
Have you been sleeping  
The sermons in the music  
The man standing next to you  
He must surely be your brother  
So brother please  
Heed the call  
The piper hes still piping  
The magic in the music  
The drummer hes still drumming  
The message in the music  
Sweet songs of loving  
You should be singing  
So brother please  
Heed the call  
Listen to the music  
Listen to the music  
Listen to the music  
Heed the call of the music  
Listen to the music  
Heed the call of the music  
Listen to the music  
Heed the call of the music  
Heed the call of the music  
Its still early in our morning  
Theres still time for singing  
Lets not waste our morning  
Join in the singing  
The outlaw of the midnight  
He all too soon comes winging  
So brother please please  
Heed the call  
Listen to the music  
Listen to the music  
Yeah  
Listen to the music  
Listen to the music  
Oh oh  
Listen to the music  
Oh  
Listen to the music  
Incomprehensible  
Listen to the music
