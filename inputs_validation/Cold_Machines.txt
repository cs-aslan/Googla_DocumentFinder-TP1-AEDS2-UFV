I see you working at your station  
Radiation burns my eyes  
Loves forbidden so is passion  
This whole place is sterilized  
  
I just want to see tomorrow  
Day by day to just survive  
But this place is built to kill me  
No one here gets out alive  
  
I dont want to be  
I dont want to be  
Just a memory  
I dont want to be  
I dont want to be  
Gone  
  
You dont know my name  
You dont know my number  
You dont know my face at all at all at all at all  
We walk right past each other every single day  
Like cold machines were marching on and on and on and on and on  
  
Got your thumb print always with me  
Got your barcode memorized  
They came here to electroshock me  
But can they erase you from my mind  
  
I dont want to be  
I dont want to be  
Just a memory  
I dont want to be  
I dont want to be  
Gone  
  
You dont know my name  
You dont know my number  
You dont know my face at all at all at all at all  
We walk right past each other every single day  
Like cold machines were marching on and on and on and on and on  
  
I dont want to be  
I dont want to be  
Just a memory  
I dont want to be  
I dont want to be  
Gone  
  
You dont know my name  
You dont know my number  
You dont know my face at all at all at all at all  
We walk right past each other every single day  
Like cold machines were marching on and on and on and on and on
