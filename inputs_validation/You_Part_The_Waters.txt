The same ones that Im drowning in  
You lead your casual slaughters  
And Im the one who helps you win  
Youve got your grand piano  
  
You dont even play piano  
Im the one who plays piano  
You dont even play piano  
You part the waters  
  
The same ones that Im thirsty for  
You invite your friends to tea  
But when its me you lock the door  
Youve got your credit cards  
  
And you thank your lucky stars  
But dont forget the ones who foot the bill  
Youve got your grand piano  
And you dont even play piano  
  
Im the one who plays piano  
You dont even play piano  
But you part the waters
