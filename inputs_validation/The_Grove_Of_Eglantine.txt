Hey you there  
Cast an eye this way  
You with that young lust virgin smile  
Dont pretend that youre quickly melting before my eyes  
Thats a lie  
  
Cause I see all of you  
Quite clearly now  
I like our looks your moves you know everything  
So when I ring you up in the evening I shall meet you  
  
In the Grove of Eglantine  
Just south of mans delight  
Close to a soft flowing stream  
  
In the Grove of Eglantine  
We will join as lovers might  
Between the lines of a dream  
  
Your magic lips  
Have made me realize  
All of the pleasures man can fantasize  
So dont pretend that youre sad to see me say goodbye  
Thats a lie  
  
Youre a wicked wenchha  
But thanks for all the laughs  
You and your young lust virgin smile  
And when Im gone for awhile  
Ill once more want to meet you  
  
In the Grove of Eglantine  
Just south of mans delight  
Close to a soft flowing stream  
  
In the Grove of Eglantine  
We will join as lovers might  
Between the lines of a dream  
In the Grove of Eglantine  
Just south of mans delight  
Close to a soft flowing stream  
  
In the Grove of Eglantine  
We will join as lovers might  
Between the lines of a dream  
  
In Eglantine of a dream
