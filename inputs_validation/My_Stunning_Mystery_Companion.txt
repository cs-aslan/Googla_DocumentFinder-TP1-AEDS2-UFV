What with all my expectations long abandoned  
And a future I no longer saw my hand in  
How I found you is beyond my understanding  
My stunning mystery companion  
  
I know that you dont want to be  
Out here forever on this road  
Or live among the boxes  
Where all my past lives have been stowed  
Maybe youre thinking of someplace  
With a garden by the sea  
Where we could slow down  
And you could put a little more work in on me  
  
What with all my expectations long abandoned  
My solitary nature notwithstanding  
Youre the one who pulled me  
Out of that crash landing  
My stunning mystery companion  
  
Right now I cant quite remember  
The cause of all my tears  
I hear you laughing and somehow  
The past just disappears  
Maybe you were joking when you said  
Youd take me for ten years and no more  
Maybe youve had the best of me  
But you could take another ten years and be sure  
  
What with all my expectations long abandoned  
And a life that just gets more and more demanding  
Theres no doubt that youre the reason Im still standing  
My stunning mystery companion
