At the first bell of the day  
They rise up from where they lay  
And look down with the promise in their hands  
A promise to get out  
This aint what its all about  
Theres always lots of reasons for their plans  
When that golden sun shines through  
Theres always one more thing to do  
Just one more stab into the wishing well  
  
Thats what they always say  
Im getting out  
Thats what they always say  
Aint that just what they always say  
Thats what they always say  
Just one more little thing left in my way  
Thats what they always say  
Aint that just what they always say  
  
Im getting out Im holding on  
Im hanging in the time is wrong  
And every morning brings another reason  
A piece of cake no lion share  
Just one more dice and youll be there  
That golden bridge is just around the bend  
  
Thats what they always say  
Im getting out  
Thats what they always say  
Aint that just what they always say  
Thats what they always say  
Just one more little thing left in my way  
Thats what they always say  
Aint that just what they always say  
  
Tomorrow is another day  
The money junkie fades away  
That golden bridge is just around the bend  
  
Thats what they always say  
Im getting out  
Thats what they always say  
Aint that just what they always say  
Thats what they always say  
Just one more little thing left in my way  
Thats what they always say  
Aint that just what they always say
