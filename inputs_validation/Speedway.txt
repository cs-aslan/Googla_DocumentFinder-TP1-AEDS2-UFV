And when you slam  
Down the hammer  
Can you see it in your heart  
All of the rumors  
Keeping me grounded  
I never said I never said that they were  
Completely unfounded  
  
So when you slam  
Down the hammer  
Can you see it in your heart  
Can you delve so low  
And when youre standing  
On my fingers  
Can you see it in your heart Ah  
And when you try  
To break my spirit  
It wont work  
Because theres nothing left to break  
Anymore  
All of the rumors  
Keeping me grounded  
I never said I never said that they were  
Completely unfounded  
  
You wont sleep  
Until the earth that wants me  
Finally has me  
Oh youve done it now  
You wont rest  
Until the hearse that becomes me  
Finally takes me  
Oh youve done it now  
And you wont smile  
Until my loving mouth  
Is shut good and proper  
Forever  
  
All of the rumors  
Keeping me grounded  
I never said I never said that they were  
Completely unfounded  
And all those lies  
Written lies twisted lies  
Well they werent lies  
They werent lies  
They werent lies  
  
I never said  
I never said  
I could have mentioned your name  
I could have dragged you in  
Guilt by implication  
By association  
Ive always been true to you  
In my own strange way  
Ive always been true to you  
In my own sick way  
Ill always stay true to you
