Out here in the fields  
I fight for my meals  
I get my back into my living  
I dont need to fight  
To prove Im right  
I dont need to be forgiven  
  
Dont cry  
Dont raise your eye  
Its only teenage wasteland  
  
Sally take my hand  
Well travel south cross land  
Put out the fire  
And dont look past my shoulder  
The Exodus is here  
The happy ones are near  
Lets get together before we get much older  
  
Teenage wasteland  
Its only teenage wasteland  
Teenage wasteland  
Oh yeah teenage wasteland  
Theyre all wasted
