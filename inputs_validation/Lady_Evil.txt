Theres a place just south of Witches Valley  
Where they say the wind wont blow  
And they only speak in whispers of her name  
Theres a lady they say who feeds the darkness  
It eats right from her hand  
With a crying shout shell search you out  
And freeze you where you stand  
Lady Evil evil  
Shes a magical mystical woman  
Lady Evil evil in my mind  
Shes queen of the night  
All right  
In a place just south of Witches Valley  
Where they say the rain wont fall  
Thunder cracks the sky it makes you bleed yeah  
Theres a lady they say who needs the darkness  
She cant face the light  
With an awful shout shell find you out  
And have you for the night  
Lady Evil evil  
Shes a magical mystical woman  
Lady Evil evil on my mind  
Shes queen of the night  
So if you ever get to Witches Valley  
Dont dream or close your eyes  
And never trust your shadow in the dark  
Cause theres a lady I know who takes your vision  
Around  
The things you see are what to be lost and never found  
Lady Evil evil  
Shes a magical mystical woman  
Lady Evil evil on my mind  
Shes queen of the night  
Shes the queen of sin  
Look out shell pull you in  
Lady wonder
