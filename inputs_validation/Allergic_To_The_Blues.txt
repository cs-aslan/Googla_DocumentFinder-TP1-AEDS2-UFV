Yes I hid your car keys honey  
Yes I hid your suitcase  
And Im the reason you cant find  
Your makeup and your toothpaste  
And Ill do anything it takes  
To keep you here with me  
Losing yous a sure way  
To set off my allergies  
  
Chorus  
Im allergic to the blues  
I get these teardrops in my eyes  
You know Ive always had a bad reaction to goodbyes  
So till they find some injection  
To calm that love rejection  
All Ive got to save me now is you  
Im allergic to the blues  
  
It wont be five minutes  
After you walk out that front door  
Till Ill be fightin for my breath and  
Feelin like Im done for  
Well they might find me froze to death  
In our bed alone  
Now do you really want that  
On your conscience while your gone  
  
Chorus
