See the features of my rage  
Begin to shoot the fiend without a face  
My face  
  
The fever rots  
The brain goes numb inside  
I feel the blackout coming  
A boiled blister pops inside  
  
My ears still bleed  
With razorsharp precision  
Mouths that mouth the sweetness  
Dank of final breath upon my chest  
  
See the features of my rage  
Begin to shoot the fiend without a face  
My face  
  
We lasted all night  
The dogs keep up and snickering  
Just stay with me one moment  
Then Ill go away  
  
My ears still bleed  
With razorsharp precision  
Ill burn in hell  
Before I plunge into lifes darkness  
Darkness  
  
See the features of my rage  
Begin to shoot the fiend without a face  
See the features of my rage  
Begin to shoot the fiend without a face  
My face  
  
A fiend without a face  
A fiend without a face  
A fiend without a face  
A fiend without a face
