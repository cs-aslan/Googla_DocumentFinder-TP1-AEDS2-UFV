Well I was walking in the main land city  
And I was feeling so alone  
I was looking for someone or thing to remind me of my home  
What I wouldnt give to have somebody nod or wink at me  
Cause thats the way we say hello in my home down by the sea  
We never say hello or hows it going good day or any of that  
We just look at them and nod our heads and wink say Whaddya At  
CHORUS  
Whaddya At Hows she going buddy Whaddya At today  
Whaddya At Hows she going buddy Whaddya At today  
But then I walked into a shopping mall and much to my surprise  
An old friend from my hometown was a sight for my sore eyes  
And of all the people I met down in the city or in the mall  
I think I like my hometown friend the best one of them all  
Because he didnt say hello or hows it going today or any of that  
My old friend he just looked at me and smiled said Whaddya At  
CHORUS x 2  
Let this be a lesson to all our people who go away  
Remember if you meet someone the special words we say  
We dont ever say hello or hows it going good day  
Or any of that  
You just look at them and nod your head now wink say Whaddya At  
CHORUS
