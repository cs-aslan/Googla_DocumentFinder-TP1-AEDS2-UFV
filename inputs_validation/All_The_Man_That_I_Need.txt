I used to cry myself to sleep at night  
But that was all before he came  
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right  
But now hes here  
Its not the same  
Its not the same  
  
Chorus  
He fills me up  
He gives me love  
More love than Ive ever seen  
Hes all Ive got  
Hes all Ive got in this world  
But hes all the man that I need  
  
And in the morning when I kiss his eyes  
He takes me down and rocks me slow  
And in the evening when the moon is high  
He holds me close  
And wont let go  
He wont let go  
  
He fills me up  
He gives me love  
More love than Ive ever seen  
Hes all Ive got  
Hes all Ive got in this world  
But hes all the man that I need  
  
He fills me up  
He gives me love  
More love than Ive ever seen  
Hes all Ive got  
Hes all Ive got in this world  
But hes all the man that I need  
  
He fills me up  
He gives me love  
More more more love more love more love more than Ive ever seen  
Hes all Ive got  
Hes all Ive got in this world  
But hes all the man all the man
