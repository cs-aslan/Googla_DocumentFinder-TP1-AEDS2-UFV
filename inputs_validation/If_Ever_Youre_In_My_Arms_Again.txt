It all came so easy  
All the lovin you gave me  
The feelings we shared  
And I still can remember  
How you touched me so tender  
You told me you cared  
We had a once in a lifetime  
But I just didnt see until it was gone  
A second once in a lifetime  
Maybe too much to ask but I swear from now on  
If ever youre in my arms again  
This time Ill love you much better  
If ever youre in my arms again  
This time Ill hold you forever  
This time well never end oohooh  
Now Im seein clearly  
How I still need you near me  
I still love you so  
Theres something between us  
That wont ever leave us  
Theres no letting go  
We had a once in a lifetime  
But I just didnt know it till my life fell apart  
A second once in a lifetime  
Isnt too much to ask cause I swear from the heart  
If ever youre in my arms again  
This time Ill love you much better  
If ever youre in my arms again  
This time Ill hold you forever  
This time well never end  
Never end  
The best of romances  
Deserves second chances  
Ill get to you somehow  
Cause I promise now  
If ever youre in my arms again  
This time Ill love you much better  
If ever youre in my arms again  
This time Ill hold you forever  
This time well never end  
If ever youre in my arms again  
This time Ill love you much better  
If ever youre in my arms again  
This time Ill hold you forever  
This time well never end  
If ever youre in my arms again  
This time Ill love you much better  
If ever youre in my arms again  
This time Ill hold you forever  
This time well never end  
till fade
