Well my fraulein done told me  
When I was in goosesteps  
She said I would gas them  
And now Im a big man  
Filling up autos  
That beep at me often  
I drop what Im doing  
And wait on them cheerfullv  
Some choose the big pump  
And others the small  
Its a small small world  
And I hear dem autos call  
Well Im a big time pumper  
And I pumpem full of my gas  
And if you give me static  
Ill tell ya blow it up your ass  
My station is pretty  
I keep it in top shape  
The customers dig me  
cause I got the answers  
To all of their auto needs  
I fix em up often  
And relieve their tension  
cause no one wants an auto  
That threatens to lose it  
The autos come crawlin  
Into my station  
They beep at me always  
I stop what Im doing  
And greet them with smiles  
I call fill er up  
They yell back one dollar  
I wipe all the dead bugs  
And dirt off their windshield  
And connect my big hose  
Up to their gas tank  
The gas hums as it enters  
And fulls up their empty tank  
I do two at a time now  
Ive developed a technique  
My timing is very good  
If not always precise  
I give them a fair deal  
They drive off satisfied  
We need each others business  
Without which we could not survive  
We like to trade money  
Because it means honor  
Not like those people  
Who are sick and cant touch it  
Because theyre unhealthy  
They leave me cold  
I help who I can help  
And feel nothing for those who  
Dont come to my station  
For Ill only tow those who  
Show me their honor  
I cant help evervbody  
And Im not my brothers keeper  
We huddle together  
And those who come to me  
We huddle together  
And despite the weather  
We find strength in our circle  
Im very important  
To the big and the little guy  
We all need each other  
To keep ourselves going  
Their autos all need me  
My pumps need their empty tanks and  
If the good lord is willing  
We shall be here to the end
