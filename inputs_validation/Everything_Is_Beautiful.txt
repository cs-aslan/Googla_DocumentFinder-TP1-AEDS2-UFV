Everything is beautiful in its own way  
Like a starry summer night or a snow covered winters day  
And everybodys beautiful in their own way  
Under Gods heaven the worlds gonna find a way  
There is none so bling as he who will not see  
We must not close our minds gotta let our thoughts be free  
Every hour that passes by you know this world gets a little bit older  
Its time to realize that beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder  
And everything is beautiful  
We shouldnt care about the length of his hair or the color of his skin  
Dont worry about what shows from without but the love that lives within  
Were gonna get it all together now yeah everything will work out fine  
Just take the time to look on the good side my friend  
And straighten it out in your mind  
Everything is beautiful  
Everything is beautiful
