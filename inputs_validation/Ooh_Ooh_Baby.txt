The way you smile the way you taste  
You know I have an appetite for sexy things  
All you do is look at me its a disgrace  
Whats running through my mind is you  
Up in my face

Your voice is like music to my ears  
Whisper softly and the world just dissapears  
Take me high and just wipe away my fears  
When youre with me  
Oh boy its my heartbeat that i hear  
  
Ooh ooh baby  
Touch me and i come alive  
I can feel you on my lips  
I can feel you deep inside  
Ooh ooh baby  
In your arms I finally breathe  
Wrap me up in all your love  
Thats the oxygen I need yeah

The more you move  
The more I tense  
Its like you got me hypnotized  
Im in a trance  
Your jersey fits  
Its right at home between my hands  
And now I hope you know that Im  
Your biggest fan

Your voice is like music to my ears  
Whisper softly and the world just dissapears
