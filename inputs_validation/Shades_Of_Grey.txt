I watch the smoke drift from my cigarette  
I hear the roaches cross the floor  
Slam dance around me in my chair I sit  
The greys leakin through the door  
Theres a shade of grey Ive never seen before  
  
My gaze fixed on the space beneath the door  
My life flash before my eyes  
All this sweat grew from one solitary drop  
Greys movin cross the floor  
  
We walk alone no one beside us  
Its never simple as black or white  
We should have known no one would find us  
That we would all wind up in  
Shades of grey  
  
It seems like every time I get a chance is quite naked  
And as I turn around as I turn around and  
Inside theres no doubt its gonna happen again  
  
Nobody listenin so I talk to myself  
Sometimes I pay me no mind  
I lost this argument so very long ago  
The right words were so hard to find  
I cant breathe in the grey  
An I cant find the key to the door
