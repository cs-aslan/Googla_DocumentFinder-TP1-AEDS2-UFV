Chorus  
Keep on chooglin  
Keep on chooglin  
Keep on chooglin  
Chooglin  
Chooglin  
  
Maybe you dont understand it  
But if youre a natural man  
You got to ball and have a good time  
And thats what I call chooglin  
  
Here comes Mary lookin for Harry  
She gonna choogle tonight  
Here comes Louie works in the sewer  
  
He gonna choogle tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
primal screaming  
  
Chorus  
  
If you can choose it who can refuse it  
Yall be chooglin tonight  
Go on take your pick right from the git go  
You gotta choogle tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
more screaming  
  
Oh were Creedence  
Clearwater  
Revival
