We did some rock and roll up in Texas  
And the folks from the coast towns said  
You better watch yourself up in Texas  
Or you you might just end up dead boy  
But the people I found  
Grooving to the sound  
Of rock and roll music in the air  
We all had a ball  
With no hassles at all  
Pretty soon Im gonna go back there  
  
Im singing  
Rock and roll music to the world  
Rock and roll music to the world  
Aint no relation  
To the United Nations  
Keep rock and rolling to the world  
Give peace a chance  
Get up and dance  
  
When I sing  
Rock and roll music to the world  
Im gonna scream  
Im gonna shout  
Get my emotions  
And work them all right out  
  
I want to live  
Just like I give  
No need to fight  
Wait for tonight  
When I sing  
Rock and roll music to the world  
  
Rock and roll music to the world  
Rock and roll music to the world  
Aint got no calling  
Except for balling  
Rock and roll music to the world  
Dont need no boost  
Just turn me loose  
And I sing  
Rock and roll music to the world  
I tell the truth  
I aint no star  
I only shout  
And leave the rest to my guitar  
  
Rock and roll music to the world  
Rock and roll music to the world  
Aint no relation  
To the United Nations  
Keep rock and rolling to the world  
Dont need no boost  
Just turn me loose  
And I sing  
Rock and roll music to the world
