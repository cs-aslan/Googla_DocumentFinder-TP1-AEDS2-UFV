Something deep inside far from reality  
We pretend it never crossed our mind  
we feel but never sense  
Building up a strong defense  
Some say its our destiny Lord  
Were living on the faultline  
Get out of here  
Cry the prophets of our time  
Fear the signs  
Save those you love and all your children  
You life depends on castles in the sand  
Dont look back there is no promised land  
We dont want to hear that this could be the day  
So much for science fiction  
as you always say  
But soon the day will come  
Its only just begun  
For the people on the faultline  
its no use to pray  
Why living in danger  
Were living on the faultline  
Get out of here  
Cry the prophets of our time  
Fear the signs  
Save those you love and all your children  
You life depends on castles in the sand  
Dont look back there is no promised land  
We dont want to hear that this could be the day  
So much for science fiction  
as you always say  
But soon the day will come  
Its only just begun  
For the people on the faultline  
its no use to pray  
Why living in danger  
Why living in danger danger
