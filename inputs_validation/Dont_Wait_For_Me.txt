Dont wait for meIll be a long time comin  
Unless by then you have told me something  
To show how much you care  
Ive done much more than as a man I should have  
  
Why did you not do all you could have to show  
How much you care  
  
Over and again Ive wondered was I wrong  
Kept thinkin that I maybe shoulda come along  
But there comes a time in every mans life  
When he must be strong  
  
And my times come  
And if youre gone  
Then I guess Ill cry and hold to memories  
Of what might have beens  
  
Repeat x2  
And when I finally leave  
That will show how much I cared
