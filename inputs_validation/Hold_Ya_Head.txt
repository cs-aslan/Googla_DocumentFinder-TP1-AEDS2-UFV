Chorus  
Woman hold her head and cry  
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died  
  
Woman hold her head and cry  
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died  
  
When I die fuck it I wanna go to hell  
Cause Im a piece of shit it aint hard to fuckin tell  
It dont make sense goin to heaven wit the goodiegoodies  
Dressed in white I like black Tims and black hoodies  
God will probably have me on some real strict shit  
No sleepin all day no gettin my dick licked  
Hangin with the goodiegoodies loungin in paradise  
Fuck that shit I wanna tote guns and shoot dice  
All my life I been considered as the worst  
Lyin to my mother even stealin out her purse  
Crime after crime from drugs to extortion  
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin abortion  
  
Chorus  
  
I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit  
Throw the Magnum to my head threaten to pull shit  
And squeeze until the beds completely red  
Im glad Im dead a worthless fuckin buddah head  
The stress is buildin up I cant  
I cant believe suicides on my fuckin mind  
I want to leave I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin callin me  
Naw you wouldnt understand  
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack  
Except when I cross over there aint no comin back  
Should I die on the train track like Remo in Beatstreet  
People at the funeral frontin like they miss me  
My baby momma kissed me but she glad Im gone  
She knew me and her sister had somethin goin on  
I wonder if I died would tears come to her eyes  
Forgive me for my disrespect forgive me for my lies  
  
Chorus  
  
I reach my peak I cant speak  
Call my nigga Chic tell him that my will is weak  
Im sick of niggaz lyin Im sick of bitches hawkin  
Matter of fact Im sick of talkin echoes
