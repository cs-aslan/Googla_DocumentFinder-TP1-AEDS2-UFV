Come to me my melancholy baby  
Cuddle up and dont be blue  
All your fears are foolish fancies baby  
You know dear that Im in love with you  
Every cloud must have a silver lining  
Wait until the sun shines through  
Smile my honey dear while I kiss away each tear  
Or else I shall be melancholy too  
Every cloud must have a silver lining  
Wait until the sun shines through  
Smile my honey dear while I kiss away each tear  
Or else I shall be melancholy too
