Victim of temptation  
Cant make it go away  
You see it and you want it baby  
Never hear a word I say  
You know I dont want nothing I dont deserve  
Oh no I wont take less than I know Im worth  
  
All this talking makes me feel like a monkey in a cage  
Aint no point in trying to change a man of my age  
  
Love unemotional purely physical  
What Im staying fors a mystery to me  
Love unemotional the hearts invisible  
Love unemotional is what you want from me  
  
People say Im crazy  
Wonder why I play your game  
Sure beats feeling lonely baby  
But the story ends the same  
I want to feel like Im living in a fairy tale  
Dont want to be just another broken heart for sale  
  
Do I have to hit my knees and beg for something more  
Maybe this is not the love Ive waited for  
  
Love unemotional simply physical  
What Im staying for is a mystery to me  
Love unemotional the girls insatiable  
Love unemotional is what you want from me  
  
You feel no shame in being so unkind  
All touch and zero feeling  
I dont see a way of changing your mind  
  
Girl this kind of life is bound to leave you all alone  
The light inside your heart is on but no ones home  
  
Love unemotional purely physical  
What Im staying fors a mystery to me  
Love unemotional the hearts invisible  
Love unemotional is what you want from me  
  
Love unemotional simply physical  
What Im staying for is a mystery to me  
Love unemotional the girls insatiable  
Love unemotional is what you want from me
