And I can still feel the wind in my hair  
I can feel  
The road that youre travelling  
Takes you so far away  
Sometimes it wont hurt you  
And therell be times when you cry  
As long as youre with me  
I will be strong  
The bridge I have to cross  
Ive burned so many times before  
But with you by my side  
It feels like Im walking walking walking  
Walking on water with you by my side  
Yes Im walking on water and I know youre by my side  
Theres a place I wanna get to  
Where Im as free as a bird  
Where all my prayers will be answered  
And the truth is your to hold  
And the bridge I have to cross  
Ive burned so many times before  
But with you by my side  
Feels like Im walking walking walking  
Walking on water with you by my side  
Yes Im walking on water with you by my side  
Yes Im walking on water and I know  
That the bridge I have to cross  
Ive burned so many times before  
But with you by my side  
It still feels like Im walking walking  
Walking on water with you by my side  
And Im walking on water and youre still by my side  
And Im walking on water and I got so much tears in my life  
And Im walking walking walking on water  
And youre here by my side  
Walking on water and Im so full with pride  
Walking on water and I aint got no tears in my eye  
You by my side
