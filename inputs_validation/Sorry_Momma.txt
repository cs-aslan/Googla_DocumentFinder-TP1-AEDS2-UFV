Momma said I aint acting like her son  
Cause Im getting money Momma you aint giving me none  
You cant buy me them Js that come out tomorrow  
So get used to the things that Im doing for dollars  
You said Boy you better watch your back  
Your pops in jail remember that  
Momma it get like that  
You said Dont call me for no bail money  
Thought I could call for anything I thought you cared for me  
You said Keenon keep that bitch out my house  
I said Im eighteen  
You said This your place Nah this is Section 8  
Smacked me like bah you little disrespectful nigga  
Like mmm momma you lucky lucky I cant hit ya  
You gon treat me like this And you know I have seizures  
You know I take pain pills for headaches and fevers  
Damn now Im feeling less than a man  
Cause you birth me and I was actin like I couldnt understand  
Im sorry momma  
  
Momma  
Let me take some weight off your shoulders  
Im singing to momma  
You aint gotta worry now them days is over  
  
Im sorry momma I know I aint shit  
I know I lied a lot I know I aint slick  
Your last dollars  
Yeah that was me who stole em out your purse  
What yeah I know it hurts  
I remember days we used to go to church  
I used to fall asleep that shit used to work your nerves  
I remember when you had surgery  
In a wheelchair hooked to IVs that hurt me  
Youre like Superwoman in my eyes  
You do a lot to be blind out of one eye  
But you aint let that hold you back  
You win on your marathon and run your laps  
I broke into houses and sold stolen things for you  
I know that aint the type of things your son should do  
You gave birth to me I love you and thank you  
Just know youre wellappreciated  
  
Momma  
Let me take some weight off your shoulders  
Im singing to momma  
You aint gotta worry now them days is over
