Watcha playin in my ear  
You got a fix of what it is I wanna hear  
Coming through the frequencies  
And the airwaves  
  
You say Im acting like a fool  
Hey man back off cause you dont look so cool  
With your button down shirt tie smack  
Man your so wack  
  
Let the music play  
Let the good times roll  
We dont care what you say  
Were turnin up the radio  
  
Turn it turn it  
Got to get it louder  
Turn it turn it  
Let me hear you shout it  
Turn it turn it  
Get yourself together  
Turn it turn it  
Waking up your neighbor  
  
Listen as I start my jam  
Tuning into the stations on the stereo  
Dont you dare touch that dial  
Cause I got style  
For miles and miles  
  
Everybody clap your hands  
Grooving to the way I roll with my rock band  
You know were gonna turn back time  
To the 80s  
  
Let the music play  
Let the Mohawks grow  
  
We dont care what you say  
Were turnin up the radio  
  
Turn it turn it  
Got to get it louder  
Turn it turn it  
Let me hear you shout it  
Turn it turn it  
Get yourself together  
Turn it turn it  
Waking up your neighbor  
  
Its the rock its the roll  
Its the pop its the soul  
Its the funk the hiphop  
Oh DJ dont you stop  
  
Its the hits its the flops  
Billie Jean and She Bop  
Its the cream of the crop  
Oh DJ dont you top  
Turn it all the way  
  
Turnin turnin turnin up the radio  
  
Turn it turn it  
Got to get it louder  
Turn it turn it  
Let me hear you shout it  
Turn it turn it  
Get yourself together  
Turn it turn it  
Waking up the neighbor
