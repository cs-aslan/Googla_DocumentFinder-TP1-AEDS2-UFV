Show me a bar with a good lookin woman  
Then just get out of my way  
Show me the jukebox Ill tell you a song you should play  
Sooner a later a few shots of bourbon  
And Ill think of somethin to say  
Whoa I can take her or leave her  
But I like to take her away  
  
Liquor and music a good combination  
If youve got love on the brain  
I never knew two women who acted the same  
Some want a drink first  
And some want to just sit and talk  
Whoa oh its two in the morning  
Im running and she wants to walk  
  
Somethings got a hold on me  
Its cheap but it ain free  
Love or somethin like its got a hold on me  
  
Thats when I asked her  
My place or your place  
I hope Im not out of line  
I asked the wrong thing  
But just the right woman this time  
Cause she knew a hotel  
She even had a name we could sign  
Whoa oh the cheaper the grapes are  
The sweeter the taste of the wine  
  
Somethings got a hold on me  
Its cheap but it ain free  
Love or somethin like its got a hold on me  
  
Somethings got a hold on me  
Its cheap but it aint free  
Love or somethin like its got a hold on me  
Love or somethin damn near like its got a hold on me
