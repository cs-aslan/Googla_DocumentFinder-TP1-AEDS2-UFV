Hey baby watcha gonna do  
Now that Ive left you and I said were through  
All along you been runnin round  
But you aint the only game in town  
  
I dug your brush and your ass was fine  
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind  
But you rubbed it on another guy  
Youre history and this is why  
Youre just a dog a scurvy dog  
  
Hey baby when we got it on  
You made me feel like there aint nothin wrong  
Just dont bug me like youre so naive  
Im crackin up Im gonna take my leave  
  
I dug your brush and your ass was fine  
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind  
But you rubbed it on another guy  
Youre history and this is why  
Youre just a dog  
  
Hey baby well its over now  
Ill make my exit and Ill take a bow  
Your problems cured with a dollar bill  
And if it wont I know a flea collar will  
  
I dug your brush and your ass was fine  
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind  
But you rubbed it on another guy  
Youre history and this is why  
Youre just a dog a scurvy dog  
Arf arf  
  
Hey Get that dog out of my yard
