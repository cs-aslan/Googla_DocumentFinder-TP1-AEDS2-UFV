You point that little finger out  
You got four pointing back at you  
It goes everywhere you go  
Does everything you do  
  
He got roughed up on the inside  
Screaming that this aint fair  
And in a blocked moment alone on the inside  
Thought that no one cared  
You want me you need me you have me Im yours  
  
So he puts in a call to his only friend  
He dials 1800FEAR  
Then he hid his face inside his hands  
You know he wasnt very clear  
Said Im roughed up on the inside  
You know that this aint fair  
And in a new york minute he felt like a million  
Cause he knew somebody cared and said  
I have but a nation in me for everyone to see  
I am but a tribute to mediocrity  
Im your mother father brother son  
Im a little bit of everyone  
Hide in the shadow cast by the sun  
In constant misery Im fear  
You want meyou need me you have me Im yours  
  
Yes I know youve always loved me  
Call me now between the tears  
I know you put no one above me  
Call me now between the tears  
Im fear  
  
Call me now uncover me  
Watch me work its what I do  
Call me now uncover me  
Watch me work and watch what I undo  
  
So he brokenup all his fingers  
While pulling out his hair  
And he broke into a million pieces  
No nobody cared  
He was beatup on the inside  
Fighting  to survive  
Spent a long time dyin no not for tryin  
When you want to feel alive  
Seem like total chaos everywhere you turn  
  
When youre wiped out on the inside  
You cant catch your breath  
And in a black out moment  
Alone on the outside beat him right to dead  
You want meyou need me you have me Im yours  
  
Yes I know youve always loved me  
Call me now between the tears  
I know you put no one above me  
Call me now between the tears  
Im fear Repeat x2
