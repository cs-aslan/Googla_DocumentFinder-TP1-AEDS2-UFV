Traditional arranged  
By Arlo Guthrie  
Come all you old time cowboys  
And listen to my song  
Please do not grow weary  
Ill not detain you long  
Concerning some wild cowboys  
Who did agree to go  
And spend the summer pleasant  
On the range of the buffalo  
Well I found myself in Griffin  
In eighteen eightythree  
When a man by the name of Creagho  
Come awalkin up to me  
Sayin How do you do young fella  
And howd you like to go  
And spend the summer pleasant  
On the range of the buffalo  
Well me being out of work right then  
To that drover I did say  
My goin out on the buffalo range  
Depends upon the pay  
But if you pay good wages  
Transportation to and fro  
I think I might go with you  
On the range of the Buffalo  
Well yes I pay good wages  
And transportation too  
If youll agree to work for me  
Until the seasons through  
But if you do get homesick  
And you try and run away  
Youll starve to death out on the trail  
And youll also lose your pay  
Well with all the flatterin talkin  
He signed up quite a train  
Some ten or twelve in number  
Of able bodied men  
And our trip it was a pleasant one  
Through all New Mexico  
Until we crossed Pease River  
On the range of the buffalo  
It was there our pleasures ended  
And our troubles all begun  
A lightnin storm come up on us  
And made the cattle run  
We got full of the stickers  
On the cactus that did grow  
And the outlaws waited to pick us off  
In the hills of Mexico  
Well the working season ended  
But the drover would not pay  
He said You spent your money boys  
Youre all in debt to me  
But the cowboys never put much stock  
In a thing like a bankrupt law  
So we left the bastards bones to bleach  
On the range of the buffalo
