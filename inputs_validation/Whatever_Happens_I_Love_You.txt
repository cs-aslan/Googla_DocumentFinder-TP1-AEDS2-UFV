Names secret names  
But never in my favor  
But when all is said and done  
Its you I love  
  
Cold loving prose  
We stole each others clothes  
But when all is said and done  
Its you I love  
  
Yes yes yes oh yes  
Oh no yes yes yes yes yes yes  
Oh yes yes yes yes yes yes yes  
Oh  
Yes yes  
  
Fights for rights  
Everyones oh so quick with advice  
And when theyve all said their piece  
Its still you I love  
Now just like then  
  
Then then then  
Then then yes yes  
No yes yes yes yes yes  
Yes yes oh  
Mmm
