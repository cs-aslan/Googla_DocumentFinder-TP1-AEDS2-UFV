Makes me wonder if I ever said goodbye  
She at times still comes around  
Though shes someone elses now  
And I cant let down no matter how I try  
If I leave her then I find  
Shes no farther than my mind  
Makes me wonder if I ever said goodbye  
Night and day its all the same  
Pour some whiskey on my flame  
And burn another memory in my mind  
Through the years shes moved up town  
While I come a long way down  
Makes me wonder if I ever said goodbye  
Yes she always says hello  
The way she used to  
But Lord she only said goodbye one time  
Heaven knows I live in hell  
With a barroom for myself  
Makes me wonder if I ever said goodbye  
Makes me wonder if I ever said goodbye
