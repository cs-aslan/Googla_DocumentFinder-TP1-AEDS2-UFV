Christmas  
The snows coming down  
Christmas  
Im watching it fall  
Christmas  
Lots of people around  
Christmas  
Baby please come home  
Christmas  
The church bells in town  
Christmas  
All ringing in song  
Christmas  
Full of happy sounds  
Christmas  
Baby please come home  
  
Theyre singing Deck The Halls  
But its not like Christmas at all  
I remember when you were here  
And all the fun we had last year  
  
Christmas  
Pretty lights on the tree  
Christmas  
Im watching them shine  
Christmas  
You should be here with me  
Christmas  
Baby please come home  
  
Theyre singing Deck The Halls  
Not like Christmas at all  
I remember when you were here  
All the fun we had last year  
  
Christmas  
Oh if there was a way  
Christmas  
Id hold back this tear  
Christmas  
Oh but its Christmas day  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Oh come home  
Oh babe  
You know I need you  
Oh come home  
I gotta have you  
You know I need you

Its Christmas Christmas
