Open up your eyes looking at the people  
Wouldnt it be nice if they were always smiling  
Open up your eyes looking at the people  
Wouldnt it be nice if they were always smiling smiling  
  
Wake in the morning  
Look out of my window  
Down on the street as the people pass by  
Wonderful faces awake but asleep  
Rushing around with appointments to keep  
Rushing around with appointments to keep  
  
Baldheaded banker with bowler on head  
Credit for debit but still in the red  
Schoolgirl in pigtails and freckly nose  
Trying to remember her Latin prose  
Trying to remember her Latin prose  
  
Chorus  
Open up your eyes open up your eyes  
Open up your eyes open up your eyes  
Isnt it surprising what youll find  
  
Open up your eyes open up your eyes  
What are they thinking  
Whats on their minds  
Are they all looking for something to find  
Decreasing circles running around  
Searching for something theyve already found  
Searching for something theyve already found  
  
Chorus  
  
Open up your eyes looking at the people
