Sing sing a song  
Make it simple to last  
Your whole life long  
Dont worry that its not  
Good enough for anyone  
Else to hear  
Just sing sing a song  
  
Why do stars  
Fall down from the sky  
Everytime you walk by  
Just like me  
They long to be  
Close to you  
  
Just like me  
They long to be  
Close to you  
  
Oohahahahahah close to you  
Oohahahahahah close to you  
Ahahahahah close to you  
  
Lets take a lifetime to say  
I knew you well  
For only time will tell us so  
And love may grow for all we know  
  
Hes got a ticket to ride  
Hes got a ticket to ride  
Hes got a ticket to ride  
And he dont care Baby baby  
Dont care Baby baby  
  
Baby baby  
Feels like maybe things will be all right  
Baby baby  
Your loves made me  
Free as a song singin forever  
  
Only yesterday when I was sad  
And I was lonely  
You showed me the way to leave  
The past and all its tears behind me  
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today  
Since I threw my sadness away  
Only yesterday  
  
Guitar Solo  
  
When theres no gettin over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams wont come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I wont last a day without you  
  
I dont wanna talk  
About the things weve gone through  
Though its hurting me  
Now its history  
Ive played all my cards  
And thats what youve done too  
Nothing more to say  
No more ace to play  
  
I dont wanna talk  
If it makes you feel sad  
And I understand  
Youve come to shake my hand  
I apologize  
If it makes you feel bad  
Seeing me so tense  
No selfconfidence  
  
The winner takes it all oh  
  
Guitar Solo Continued  
  
The winner takes it all  
The loser standing small  
Beside the victory  
Thats her destiny hee  
  
I cant live if living is without you  
I cant live I cant give anymore The winner takes it all oh  
I cant live if living is without you  
I cant live I cant give anymore  
I cant live if living is without you  
I cant live I cant give anymore oh oh oh oh  
  
Guitar Solo Until End
