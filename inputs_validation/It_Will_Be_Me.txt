When you start falling  
Whos gonna catch ya  
Im willing to betcha  
It will be me  
Whos gonna love ya  
Like theres no other  
Search and discover  
It will be me  
  
When all the others  
Have gone and hurt you  
Who wont desert you  
It will be me  
Weighing the options  
So much to think of  
But when you think love  
It will be me  
  
Chorus  
You may not see it now  
Love is strange that way  
But someday someway  
Baby somehow  
  
When youve been broken  
And dreams dont oblige ya  
Whos that beside ya  
Oh it will be me  
  
Chorus  
You may not see it now  
Love is strange that way  
But someday someway  
Baby somehow  
  
Wholl be your only  
True romancer  
You know that answer  
It will be me  
What will it take to  
Bring you to your senses  
And finally convince you  
It will be me
