Dont thank me for what you got  
Ive given you love Ive given you too much thought  
Dont blame me for sinking the ship  
Youre a hopeless liar and a hypocrite  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
  
Dont thank me for what you got  
Ive given you love Ive given you too much thought  
Dont shame me for calling it quits  
Youre a hopeless sinner and an optimist  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
  
Hey dont hate me for what you got  
Ive given you drugs Ive given you too much fun  
Dont blame me for flunking the test  
I would rather think that you were honest  
Dont blame me cause you got caught  
Youve given me up youve taken everything I got  
Those lies came straight from your mouth  
I never dreamed that you would be a sellout  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
  
Dont use me as your last crutch  
Ive taken you in Ive trusted you way too much  
Dont wear me around your wrist  
You shouldve thought it through before you blew it  
Same day same life different person  
Your ghost my pride perfect  
Dont hate me for what you got  
Ive given you love Ive given you too much thought  
Dont shame me for sinking the ship  
Youre a hopeless liar and a hypocrite  
Dont hate me for what youre not  
Im aiming your gun  
Im lining up the perfect shot  
Dont waste me  
On something stupid like this  
  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know
