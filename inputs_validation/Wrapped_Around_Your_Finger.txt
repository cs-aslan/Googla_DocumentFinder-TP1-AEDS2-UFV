You consider me the young apprentice  
Caught between the Scylla and Charibdes  
Hypnotized by you if I should linger  
Staring at the ring around your finger  
  
I have only come here seeking knowledge  
Things they would not teach me of in college  
I can see the destiny you sold  
Turning into a shining band of gold  
  
Ill be wrapped around your finger  
Ill be wrapped around your  
Ill be wrapped around your finger  
Ill be wrapped around your  
  
Mephistopheles is not your name  
I know what youre up to just the same  
I will listen hard to your tuition  
You will see it come to its fruition  
  
Ill be wrapped around your finger  
Ill be wrapped around your  
Ill be wrapped around your finger  
Ill be wrapped around your  
  
Devil and the deep blue sea behind me  
Vanish in the air youll never find me  
I will turn your face to alabaster  
Then youll find your servant is your master  
  
Oh youll be wrapped around my finger  
Ill be wrapped around your  
Youll be wrapped around my finger  
Ill be wrapped around your  
Youll be wrapped around my finger  
Ill be wrapped around your  
Youll be wrapped around my finger  
Ill be wrapped around your finger
