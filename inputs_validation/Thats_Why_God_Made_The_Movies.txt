When I was born  
My mother died  
She saidBye bye baby bye bye  
I saidWhere you goin  
Im just born  
She saidIll only be gone for a while  
My mother loved to leave in style  
Thats why God made the movies  
  
Well I laid around  
In my swaddling clothes  
Until the doctor came and turned out the lights  
Then I packed my bag  
And my name tag  
I stole away into the night  
Hoping things would work out right  
Thats why God made the movies  
  
Say you will Say you will  
Say youll take me to your lovin breast  
Say youll nourish me  
With your tenderness  
The way the ladies sometimes do  
Say you wont Say you wont  
Say you wont leave me for no other man  
Say youll love me just the way I am  
Say you will baby now  
Say you will just say you will  
  
When I was born  
My mother died  
She saidBye bye baby bye bye  
And since that day  
Ive paid my way  
The notorious boy of the wild  
Adopted by the wolves  
When he was a child  
  
Thats why God  
Thats why God  
Thats why God made the movies
