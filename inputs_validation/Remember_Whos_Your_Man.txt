Sugar I want to know you know you inside out  
Mystery surrounds you got to figure it out  
Driving downtown to your house  
your lights are never on  
You got me hooked I wanna drown  
Without your hand Im going down  
  
And I cant stop dont help me out so lonely and Im bleeding from the
inside  
Oh no no no no  
I need you you need to remember remember remember whos your man  
  
Met you on the corner not so long ago  
You asked me where I was going  
I said I dont know  
Tell me how is it you came into  
my life so damn fast  
You blew my mind left me behind and now Im living in your past  
  
And I cant stop blow me out Im so lonely got me bleeding from the inside  
I need you and you need to remember  
remember cant you remember whos your man  
  
Whos your man  
  
You knocked me out so lonely  
got me bleeding from the inside  
Cause I need you and you need to remember  
I said cause I need you  
and you need to remember  
Can you do that Cause Im so high  
Remember cant you remember  
oh baby remember whos your man  
  
Whos your man Whos your man Whos your man
