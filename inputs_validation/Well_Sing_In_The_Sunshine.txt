Well sing in the sunshine well laugh every day  
Well sing in the sunshine then Ill be on my way  
I will never love you the cost of loves too dear  
But though Ill never love you Ill stay with you one year  
And we can sing in the sunshine  
Ill sing to you each morning Ill kiss you every night  
But darling dont cling to me Ill soon be out of sight  
But we can sing in the sunshine  
My daddy he once told me hey dont you love you any man  
Just take what they may give you and give but what you can  
And you can sing in the sunshine youll laugh every day  
Youll sing in the sunshine then be on your way  
Now when our year has ended and I have gone away  
Youll often speak about me and this is what youll say  
Oh we sang in the sunshine you know we laughed every day  
We sang in the sunshine then she went on her way
