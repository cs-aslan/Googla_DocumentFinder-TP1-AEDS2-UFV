You were always were so nice  
when it came to problems you knew  
I never did think twice about ever coming to you  
  
So granny what on earth can I do  
Granny granny what on earth can I do  
  
Cause this little girl this little girl shes a driving me wild  
Shes a driving me wild so wild so wild so wild  
  
You always straightened me out  
When I was feeling rough  
But this one I really doubt  
Cause this ones really tough  
  
Oh granny what on earth can i do  
Granny granny what on earth can i do  
  
Cause this little girl this little girl shes a driving me wild  
Shes a driving me wild so wild so wild so wild  
  
So granny what on earth can i do  
Granny granny what on earth can i do  
  
Cause this little girl this little girl shes a driving me wild  
Shes a driving me wild so wild so wild so wild
