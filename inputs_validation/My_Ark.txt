Please excuse my tendency  
To color everything I tell you  
You dont understand  
It takes me wherever I want to go  
  
This is surely what I need  
But I dont always think that way  
And in the end  
I cant help feeling  
  
I must sober into this  
Ive got time  
To build you up so tall  
You wont fall down on me  
  
Ive got time  
To build you up so tall  
You wont fall down on me down on me  
Please excuse  
  
My tendency  
To color everything I tell you  
But in my mind  
Theres nothing that really  
  
Ever holds us from the truth  
So I build My Ark for you  
And I hope you do the same for me  
In the end I cant feeling  
  
Just a sobering end to this  
Ive got time  
To build you up so tall  
You wont fall down on me  
  
Ive got time  
To build you up so tall  
You wont fall down on me down on me
