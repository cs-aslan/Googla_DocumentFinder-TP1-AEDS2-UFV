I heard the rumor that were callin it off  
And we wont last too long  
But I got this feelin when Im looking at you  
Baby  
They couldnt be more wrong  
Theyve been sayin its a shaky romance  
And they dont give the two of us too much of a chance  
  
Chorus  
But if the Grand Canyon is just some ditch  
Dorothy and Toto fought just some witch  
And if Babe Ruth was just a guy with a glove  
Then oh baby this is just some love  
Oh baby this is just some love  
  
I speak my mind baby thats the truth  
But youve got a temper too  
So when they see us start to fuss and fight  
I guess they think were through  
But if theyre judgin us by what they see  
Then they dont have a clue about you and me  
  
Cause if the Rocky Mountains are just some hills  
Niagara Falls is just some water spills  
And if Humphrey Bogart was just some tough  
Then oh baby this is just some love  
Oh baby this is just some love  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh baby this is just some love  
Oh baby this is just some love
