Man I aint gonna be shit in the morning after drinking that  
  
If I can sell you the American dream  
I can sell you anything  
  
I got to get out Im getting put out of my house  
I got to pack up my refrigerator and couch  
Its a set up but the bank wants me out  
Or the LAPD will smoke me out  
This suggestible weight it choke me out  
They gave me a loan and I had no clout  
They gave me a house for me and my spouse  
Call my momma and my aunt  
Yall should refinance  
I let them dance with the devil  
Dig their own grave and I gave them the shovel  
Fuck my daddy built that house  
And when he got drunk he almost killed that house  
Is this the American dream or the American scheme  
That got me walking in these American streets  
Its kinda sad when you have to get a hernia  
Cause you help your grand mama move her furniture  
  
If I can sell you the American dream  
I can sell you anything  
  
Look at this maggot with a stimulus package  
I can give a fuck about a Dow Jones average  
What the fuck you do when your paycheck is average  
Law abiding citizen turn into a savage  
Got to feed the children got to feed the habit  
Fell into a rabbit hole chasing that rabbit  
Now Im in wonderland feeling like the Son of Sam  
Im at your west coast branch gun in hand  
Ima feel like superman  
Walk by the teller better call the trooper man  
Its the revenge of the lambs  
big bad wolf were sick of these scams  
Sick of these plans sick of this dance  
Walk into his office took the nine out my pants  
Youre not a man youre a serpent  
Then I pray to God nigga nine get to workin  
  
I never get the working  
You know I heard they hood robbin  
Your money or your life and there aint no stoppin em  
I never get the working  
You know I heard they hood robbin  
Your money or your life and there aint no stoppin em  
Aint that a bitch  
When you got to steal from the poor  
And give to the rich  
Aint that a bitch  
When you got to steal from the poor  
And give to the rich  
  
Uh drug dealer MD  
Doctor feel good give you what you need  
In California prescribe that weed  
Oxycontin and codeine  
Turn your grand mama into a fiend  
And see the cyanide first hit aint free  
I know you bout to die but let me see your ID  
I know you bout to lie but can you pay this fee  
If you cant pay then please have a seat  
You cant see a doctor but you could see a priest  
We cant save your life until we get some insurance  
Your premium is paid add that insurance  
I hope you got endurance  
They got me on hold and Im under they influence  
Nurse high as a kite  
In charge with my life  
And everything is lost  
Without blue cross  
  
You know I heard they hood robbin  
Your money or your life and there aint no stoppin em  
You know I heard they hood robbin  
Your money or your life and there aint no stoppin em  
Aint that a bitch  
When you got to steal from the poor  
And give to the rich  
Aint that a bitch  
When you got to steal from the poor  
And give to the rich  
  
Whatever you need we got it for cheap right here baby  
This America it aint gon cost ya nothin  
But a arm and a leg  
Maybe one of them motherfuckin ears ha ha  
Dont trip just put in on ya credit card  
Put it in ya baby name ha ha
