Theres a Mountain Dew can with lipstick on it  
Rollin round his truck bed  
He just leaves it back there  
One of the things he has left of her  
When he drives into the late day sun  
You can see a set of footprints  
He aint going to clean that windshield  
Hed rather just live with the hurt  
  
Hes holdin on to the wheel  
To the way she made him feel  
To the shifter to the pictures  
Every precious moment with her  
Like the left behind colors in the sky  
When the sun is gone  
Hes holdin on  
Oh hes holdin on  
  
Theres that voice mail on his cell phone  
He dont dare erase  
She ended with I love you  
And he saves it just in case  
It might still be true  
No he aint through  
  
Hes holdin on to the wheel  
To the way she made him feel  
To the shifter to the pictures  
Every precious moment with her  
Like the left behind colors in the sky  
When the sun is gone  
Hes holdin on  
  
To the past  
To the last time he held her  
The breath on his neck  
The three words she said  
  
Oh oh oh  
  
Hes holdin on to the wheel  
To the way she made him feel  
To the shifter to the pictures  
Every precious moment with her  
  
Hes holdin on  
Yeah hes holdin on  
Hes holdin on  
Hes holdin on
