Violent J  
Sitting in the class with my head on the desk  
Teachers trying to talk but I could give a fuck less  
Im staring at the freak that I know Im in love with  
But she dont even know my name its always been the same  
I just lay my head down and drown in my spit  
Nobody even notices Im here cause I aint shit  
I hear voices but I dont know what they saying  
Sweat is on my forehead cause my brains inside decaying  
And this bitch that I love probably dont have no idea  
Shes talking to her friends Im in the corner and I see her  
Somethings happening but it isnt very clear  
Sounds like a bell sounds like an electric chair  
Next thing I know walking in the crowded hall  
So many different faces that I throw up on the wall  
Some are yelling sick and the others stop and stare  
But I dont care Im in a hurry going nowhere  
See my head is spinning cause Im lonely and Im twisted  
But I have a secret everybody missed it  
Just a nobody and I think its a drag  
But I got Mr Johnsons head in my bookbag  
Chorus 2x  
I couldnt stand the pressure not another day  
I didnt like the fucker Mr Johnson anyway  
I sat up in his class he hung a rebel flag  
I cut the bigots head off and I stuffed it in my bag  
Violent J  
I wish somebody knew me cause then they could say Im wrong  
But since nobody knows me I got it going on  
Im staring at the clock I listen for the tock  
I gotta couple food stamps folded in my sock  
I guess Im just a ghost cause everybody walks through me  
If I died in class they would probably say they knew me  
Or they wouldnt care they wouldnt even move  
A dead body rotting in the back of the room  
For weeks and months stinking up the class  
Until somebody noticed then they throw me in the trash  
I can hear the teacher man talking about Columbus  
He nothing but an old dead fuck with a compass  
Ran up on a beach and threw everybody off  
And then he claimed discovery and now we all applaud  
I dont give a fuck to learn your uncle went to hell  
Im trapped in mind and my brain is my cell  
But I have a key its called insanity  
I stick in my brain to unlock eternity  
Just a nobody and I think its a drag  
But I got Mr Johnsons head in my bookbag  
Chorus 2x  
Okay today were gonna learn about A Great Freedom If youll turn  
Your textbooks to Chapter Four well get started Americas the  
Land of the free all racists live together in harmony and we are all  
Treated equal we all live togerther in the same wealthy community  
And we are alternate equals Yes  
Man Mr Johnson already taught us this Aint he ever coming back  
Uh uh hes uh very ill right now  
Violent J  
No they can sit and front about it all day  
But I left his fucking body in the hallway  
And in the morning they opened up the door  
And seen his motherfucking carcass laying on the floor  
But they would never suspect me Im just a nerd  
I try to speak my word it always goes unheard  
I could chop my arms off and run around the class  
I doubt theyd even notice but Id be dying fast  
cause theyd rather learn about redneck chicker  
Who owned a couple slaves but I guess it doesnt matter  
Fuck Washington Benjamin fuck em all ah  
They can suck my nuts till they wood teeth fall out  
And the class wanna know who could it be  
But Im like Dewey Boodie you aint never heard of me  
Im just a nobody and I think its a drag  
But I got his motherfucking melon chilling in my bookbag  
Chorus 9x
