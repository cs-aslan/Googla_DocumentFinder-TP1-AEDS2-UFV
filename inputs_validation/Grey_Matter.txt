They say youre stupid  
That youre too young to vote  
They say youll swallow anything  
That they shove down your throat  
They say you cant think  
That you havent got a brain  
That youre just there to listen  
That youre just being trained  
CHORUS  
Theres something inside your head  
Theres something inside your head  
Theres something inside your head  
Theres something inside your head  
They say you lost the ability to even think  
That your tiny little brain  
Slipped down the kitchen sink  
They say that youll buy anything  
That they turn your way  
That youll listen to everything  
That they decide to play  
CHORUS  
Grey matter grey matter ooh     
Grey matter grey matter ooh     
Grey matter grey matter ooh     
Grey matter grey matter ooh     
BRIDGE  
I think you like itlike it  
To be told what to doisnt that true  
I think youre betterbetterbetter off  
Stone cold deadwithout your head  
They say youre stupid  
That youre too young to vote  
They say youll swallow anything  
That they shove down your throat  
If they say lie down youll do it  
If they saybuy it nowyoull do it  
If they sayturn aroundyoull do it  
If they sayhit the groundyoull do it  
If they saybite the big weenieyoull do it  
If they saywasnt that goodyoull do it  
If they saybend over babyyoull do it  
If they saytake it and like ityoull do it
