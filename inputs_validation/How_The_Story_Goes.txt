Telephone girl talkin to her mothers voice  
Yet she knows these days will soon be gone  
Cadillac crews take the band away tonight  
Aint it funny how the story goes  
Its a dream I had playin music in my band  
Its a dream I had to be happy with the woman I love  
Well if dreams came true  
And they definitely do  
For sayin Im a fool  
Aint it funny how the story goes  
Aint it funny how the story goes  
  
Hollywood queen lookin from her lacy tomb  
Its strange to know that I can laugh at you  
Flash guitar instead of an architects tool  
Aint it funny how the story goes  
Its a dream I had playin music in a band  
Its a dream I had to be happy with the woman I love  
But if dreams came true  
And they definitely do  
For sayin Im a fool  
Aint it funny how the story goes  
Aint it funny how the story goes
