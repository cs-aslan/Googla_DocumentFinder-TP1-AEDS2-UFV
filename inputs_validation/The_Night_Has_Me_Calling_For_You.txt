Im in love I cant lie  
Got a feeling that I just cant hide  
More than the world more than good  
You said you love me  
And I knew you would  
Somehow I knew you would  
Somehow I knew it oh yeah yeah  
Look what youre doing for me  
  
Chorus  
Well I found your love  
I wanna stay around your love  
I cant pretend to love  
Everything I say  
Im gonna use your love  
I dont wanna ever lose your love  
I cant refuse your love  
Youre everything I need to me  
And the night has me calling for you  
  
Its no dream I know its real  
No one tells me what it is I feel  
Let me know its understood  
You said you love me  
And I knew you would  
Somehow I knew it oh yeah yeah  
Look what youre doing to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gonna use your love  
I dont wanna lose your love  
I cant refuse your love  
Youre everything to me  
Dont wanna lose your love  
I never wanna lose your love  
Cause the night has me calling for you
