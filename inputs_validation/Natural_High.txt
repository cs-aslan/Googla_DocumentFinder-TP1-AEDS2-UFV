Ooh  
Who needs the sky  
Just watch me fly  
Im on a natural high  
  
Were on a natural high  
Who needs the sky  
You can just watch me fly  
On a natural high  
So you wont turn and sigh  
And I feel like Im 13  
  
Layin on the sky  
Feel like Im sailing through a fire  
Like a bird I can fly on a natural high  
Letting out a scream  
Like Im sailing through a dream  
Like a bird I can fly on a natural high  
  
Caught in the sky  
Who can I tie  
Ooh  
  
Letting out a scream  
Like Im sailing through a dream  
Bird I can fly on a natural high  
Letting out a scream  
Like Im sailing through a dream  
Bird I can fly on a natural high  
  
Caught in the sky caught in the sky  
Who can I tie who can I tie
