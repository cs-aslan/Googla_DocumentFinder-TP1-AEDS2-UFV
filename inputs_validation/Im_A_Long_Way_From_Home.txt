Im a long way from home and so all alone homesick like I never thought Id be  
Im a long way from home everything is wrong someone please watch over me  
Im not a custom to this feeling loneliness is burning in my soul  
Sometimes the mind is so mistreating I wish Id stayed at home like I was told  
  
I wish I knew the force within me that keeps my mind out of control  
What makes me reach for things that I cant see  
I wish Id stayed at home like I was told  
Im a long way from home
