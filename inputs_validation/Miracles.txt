Clouds drift away  
When they see you  
Rain wouldnt dare  
To fall near you here  
Miracles happen  
When youre around  
Somehow the grass is much greener  
Rivers flow faster and cleaner  
Being with you  
No matter where  
Sunlight breaks through  
And suddenly theres  
  
A bluer sky  
Whenever youre around  
You always bring  
A bluer sky  
A brighter day  
  
Thunder is silent before you  
Roses bloom more to adore you too  
Miracles happen  
When youre around  
The sunset is deeper and longer  
The scent of the jasmine is stronger  
Stray dogs dont bite  
Birds start to sing  
Lightening darent strike  
You suddenly bring  
  
A bluer sky  
Whenever youre around  
You always bring  
A bluer sky  
A brighter day  
Birds fly  
Even higher in the sky  
Sun shines  
Its a new day
