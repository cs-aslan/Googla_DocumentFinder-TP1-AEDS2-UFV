In this world o darkness  
Evil rules by night  
But somewhere in the shadows someone seeking light  
  
No one knows his neighbor here  
No one has the time  
No one cares for anyone else  
In a world where the sun dont shine  
  
Shamsia Repeat x2  
  
Some sons dream of leaving  
While theyre young at heart  
But few choose the path towards the land beyond the dark  
Who choose the path towards the land beyond the daaark
