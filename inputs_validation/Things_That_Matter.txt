Sometimes he lets that boss get in his head  
He cant see past that mountain of deadlines on his desk  
Five oclock hes that last one out of the gate  
And he gets cut off flipped off ticked off out on the interstate  
And he wonders why this world wont leave him alone  
Till he hears a little voice holler daddys home  
Things that matter  
Things that dont  
  
Shes held on to that grudge all her life  
Had thirty years of anger  
Since her dad walked out that night  
She thinks of all the moments that hes missed  
All the birthdays ballets first dates  
That seems too much to forget  
She gets that call that said he dont have long  
She walks in  
He starts crying  
The past is gone  
Things that matter  
Things that dont  
  
Time aint on my side  
Dont want to leave this world  
With why didnt I  
Why didnt I  
Yeah why didnt I  
  
Sometimes I take on this world by myself  
Thinking I got all the answers  
Dont need anybodys help  
Well god was right there waiting for me all along  
To fall down on my knees surrender all  
Things that matter  
Things that dont  
Things that matter  
Things that dont
