1  
I feel the ocean swaying me   
washing away all my pains  
See where I was wounded  
Remember the scar   
Now you cant see a thing   
And I feel no pain   
  
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets  
Green and blue  Canyons too  
Singing about Atlantis love songs  
The Valleys of Neptune is arising  
  
2  
  
Mercury liquid  Emeralds shining  
Telling me where I came from   
Honey Sun  Pourquise Bed he  
lays in   on the Burning  
edge Horizon  
  
Im sailing on the Bluebirds mission   
Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam   
See the wind make love to all  
the ocean  Joy spread and  
the massage got home   
  
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets   
Purple and gold  the Armies of the Lord  
Before ancient Egypt there were moon trips   
The Valleys of Neptune is arising

Look out East coast but youre  
gonna have a neighbor  
A rebirth land   
the praying Burning Sands  
  
We know there were worlds  
so much older   
And they shall rise and  
tell us much more the truth of man   
  
4  
  
I see visions of sleeping peaks  
erupting   
releasing all hell that  
will shake the Earth from end to end   
And this aint bad news good news  
or any news  its just the truth  
Better save your souls while  
you can   
  
Singing about the New Valleys  
of the Sunrise  Rainbow clean  
the world is gonna be   
Singing about getting ready for the new tide   
The Valleys of Neptune is arising
