Is it worth the can you even hear me  
Standing with your spotlight on me  
Not enough to feed the hungry  
Im tired and I felt it for awhile now  
In this sea of lonely  
The taste of ink is getting old  
Its four o clock in the fucking morning  
Each day gets more and more like the last day  
Still I can see it coming  
While Im standing in the river drowning  
This could be my chance to break out  
This could be my chance to say goodbye  
At last its finally over  
Couldnt take this town much longer  
Being half dead wasnt what I planned to be  
Now Im ready to be free  
  
So here I am its in my hands  
And Ill savor every moment of this  
So here I am alive at last  
And Ill savor every moment of this  
  
Wont you think Im pretty  
When Im standing top the bright lit city  
And Ill take your hand and pick you up  
And keep you there so you can see it  
As long as youre alive and care  
I promise I will take you there  
Well drink and dance the night away  
Well drink and dance the night away  
  
So here I am its in my hands  
And Ill savor every moment of this  
So here I am alive at last  
And Ill savor every moment of this  
Savor every moment of this  
  
As long as youre alive  
Here I am  
I promise I will take you there  
  
As long as youre alive  
Here I am  
I promise I will take you there  
  
Wont you think Im pretty  
When Im standing top the bright lit city  
And Ill take your hand and pick you up  
And keep you there so you can see it  
So long as youre alive and care  
I promise I will take you there  
So long as youre alive and care  
I promise I will take you there  
  
So here I am its in my hands  
And Ill savor every moment of this  
So here I am alive at last  
And Ill savor every moment of this  
Savor every moment of this  
Savor every moment of this
