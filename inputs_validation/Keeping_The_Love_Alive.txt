Both of us are holding back  
So afraid to fall in love and lose again  
Weve both been hurt before  
Saw love walk out the door  
In the end  
  
Actin as cold as ice when we wanna be  
Its just a foolish game we play  
You couldnt hurt me bad enough  
To make me give it up and walk away  
  
Chorus  
We cant stop the feelings too strong  
Weve got the will to hang on  
Cant stop we struggle and fight to survive  
Keepin the love alive  
  
We try to forget the past so many times  
Its hard to make those memories leave  
With all we have at stake  
Well bend until we break  
Cause we both believe  
  
Chorus  
  
If we stand the test of time  
Love will be the lasting kind  
  
Chorus
