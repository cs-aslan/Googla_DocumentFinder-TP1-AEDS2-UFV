Im wound tight  
Hotwired  
About to explode  
  
Im seein red  
All hopped up  
And ready to go  
  
Im hurtin and Im searchin for a place  
Where I can deliver  
  
I want to scoot so fast that my head snaps  
Back together  
Its OK not OK its OK not OK its ok  
Its OK not OK its OK not OK its ok  
Go monkey go  
MoJo JoJo  
Go monkey go  
MoJo JoJo  
Go Monkey go  
MoJo JoJo  
  
Tell me tell me where to go  
Tell me tell me where to go  
  
Theres nothing I can do  
To fix whats wrong with me
