ZRo  
Time and time again I try to cope with being poor  
But I had to say just what I feel so now Im kicking in your door  
My daughter needs pampers and milk  
And my mind is confused on how we gone survive  
So when you me strapped it looking with a bad one  
You looking at the face of a desperate man Im bringing the pain out with 45  
But then I fuck around and slip on my ski mask ready to blast  
Then I come through the door with a motherfucking 44  
I want the Rolex watches and cash and you can call the laws  
I got another clip in my drawers therell be screaming and officers down  
Because its all about the money aint a damn thing funny  
What you got Ima have out town fore they put my ass in the ground  
Chorus  2x  
Gotta get my pimp on pimp on  
When a nigga be hustling on them corners  
Gotta get my pimp on pimp on  
When a nigga be moving marijuana  
Gotta get my pimp on pimp on  
Better watch your back when it get mad  
Gotta get my pimp on pimp on  
Everything in front of mes up for grabs  
ZRo  
Hell of a hustler got to work my muscle  
got to be wondering around in the streets  
Got to feet my feet when I steel sweets  
on a solo creep nothing but a thug  
Should of drove to them hoes never wanted hoes  
Got to keep my mind on my money cause I got a dream  
While pulling up on the scene jumping out of paper land  
Tell me if Hilfiger chose those jeans  
Got a crease and it never ceased to amaze me  
By the individual hustle thatd pay me  
When I got to provide for my baby and maybe  
I be creaming the fucking music and deep got to hit the week  
Got to get a fat pocket on a get it out free  
Not the HPD even though Ft Baylow cant stop it  
Got to be true to the game never new to the game  
A nigga did two and a half of the game and I show no shame  
Creeping your hustle really means mess with the way that you make your change  
Got a set of pumps and a nigga fool come through and hit from the back  
Were you thinking you a g when you fucking that hoe  
But Im laving your frame and for chest matter of fact Im  
Ready for the money like a bombs so I said it be running out that chrome  
Niggas be coming to the serve when I slam  
But they better be ready to find them another way home  
When it should of got dark for the money  
Got to take a nigga life in the hustle  
Wondering brah I dont want to make no god damn headlines  
I dont want to do no god damn fed times  
Chorus  2x  
ZRo  
Could it be the worst nightmare hoping to God  
A motherfucker where a nigga dont fight fare  
Sticking and moving and bobbing and weaving  
Im lowered to a gauge hold it right there  
Selling my drugs and my gorilla thugs man it dont stop till a nigga get paid  
All in my homes what Im about trying to move an album funky like Dre  
But Im everyday thinking about my rent and my phone bill  
And my light bill and my water bill and I cant spill and my people peel  
Every other motherfucking day its a sequel heal but I keep on climbing  
I gotta get the diamonds in the grill and the creases  
And the clothes but the yellow bone hoes keep popping me and aint stopping
me  
And everyday cause a nigga be knocking me but Ima plant this on a nigga  
Even nigga want to try me fuck around and need me here I be  
Nigga wheres your Ridgemont id have a motherfucker hollering out why me  
And its plain to see me losing the game my life end  
Like a nigga been dying faster feeling the pain  
Im a pistol packing Christian  
Living the life of a hustler really dont give a  
Chorus  2x
