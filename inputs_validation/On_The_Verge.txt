Here we are now where are we  
Its like nothing Ive ever seen we got hoarsethroated hucksters whispered
gimmicks  
Rubbernecking the curious cynics and headlongwalkers  
One born every minute do I plug it in or do I stick it in  
  
I dont know what came over me Im too dumb for words  
I didnt think Id like it here at all but I swear I swear Im on the  
Verge  
  
Here we are now who are you the long lost queens of some hoodoo  
Well were the last of the bigtime penetrators playin  
Dead to fuck the undertaker the moviell come out a little bit later the men  
The legend the goat the satyr  
  
I dont know what came over me Im too dumb for words  
I didnt say Id like it here at all but I swear I swear Im on the verge  
  
Here we are now dont ask how the time to leave was kind now well dont cry  
Baby theres no cause for grief  
  
Deadheadings never gonna kill the chief its an empty road without relief  
And Im a highway romance milking thief  
  
I dont know what came over me Im too dumb for words  
I didnt think Id like it here at all but I swear I swear Im on the verge
