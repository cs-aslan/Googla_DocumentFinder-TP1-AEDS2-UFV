One shot  
Oh lord  
You know its gonna be a lot of negative things surrounding you  
Trying to pull you down  
But what you have to remember is  
Its up to you its your choice  
You only get one shot in life  
And you only get one shot at love  
  
Did you ever notice every time you fall in love  
And it seems like you finally met the perfect match  
Everything is perfect it seems divine  
But for some strange reason theres always a catch  
Its a oneway relationship it hurts inside  
One person smirks while the other one cries  
Butterflies in the stomach of the one whose in love  
It cuts like a knife the truth mixed with lies  
  
One shot one shot at love  
One shot at love one shot one shot at love  
One shot at love one shot one shot at love  
One shot at love one shot one shot at love  
Thats all you get  
  
Physical and mental those are two different loves  
Physicals a moment mental is forever  
If the physical fades and gets weak all of a sudden  
Remember its the mental love that keeps you together  
You gotta be strong and endure the hard times  
Cause after hard times good times always follow  
And when youre kissin and huggin and makin love  
Treat that person like theres no tomorrow  
  
One shot one shot at love  
One shot at love one shot one shot at love  
Thats all you get baby one shot at love one shot one shot at love  
One shot at love one shot one shot at love  
Thats all you get  
  
Jealousy dont let it interfere  
Dont let it come in between  
The love you two share cause jealousys a hateful God  
So merciless and mean  
And its only job in life is to ruin relationships  
And pit two people against one another  
And because of this God the one you love so much  
Will no longer be your lover  
  
One shot one shot at love  
Aw baby one shot at love one shot one shot at love  
Thats all we get one shot at love one shot one shot at love  
I mean this baby one shot at love one shot one shot at love  
Thats all  
  
I hope you understand what I just said  
All Im saying is that you only get one shot at love in life  
And you have to hold on to that shot take advantage of it  
Cause when you lose it its gonna hurt real bad  
Take it from me  
You only get one shot and I mean that  
One shot  
  
Repeat x4  
You only get you only get you only get one  
You only get you only get you only get one  
One shot at love
