While everybody else is getting out of bed  
Im usually getting in it  
Im not in it to win it  
And theres a thousand ways you can skin it  
  
My feet have been on the floor  
Flat like an idol singer  
Remember winger  
I digress  
I confess you are the best thing in my life  
  
But Im afraid when I hear stories  
About a husband and wife  
Theres no happy endings  
No Henry Lee  
But you are the greatest thing about me  
  
Chorus  
If its love  
And we decide that its forever  
No one else could do it better  
If its love  
And were two birds of a feather  
Then the rest is just whatever  
And if Im addicted to loving you  
And youre addicted to my love too  
We can be them two birds of a feather  
That flock together  
Love love  
Got to have something to keep us together  
Love love  
Thats enough for me  
  
Took a loan on a house I own  
Cant be a queen bee without a bee throne  
I wanna buy ya everything  
Except cologne  
Cause its poison  
We can travel to Spain where the rain falls  
Mainly on the plain sounds insane  
Cause it is we can laugh we can sing  
Have ten kids and give them everything  
Hold our cell phones up in the air  
And just be glad that we made it here alive  
On a spinning ball in the middle of space  
I love you from your toes to your face  
  
Chorus  
  
You can move in  
I wont ask where youve been  
Cause everybody has a past  
When were older  
Well do it all over again  
  
When everybody else is getting out of bed  
Im usually getting in it  
Im not in it to win it  
Im in it for you  
  
If its love  
And were two birds of a feather  
Then the rest is just whatever  
Then the rest is just whatever  
  
If its love  
And we decide that its forever  
No one else could do it better  
And if Im addicted to loving you  
And youre addicted to my love too  
We can be them two birds of a feather  
That flock together  
Love love  
Got to have something to keep us together  
Love love  
Got to have something to keep us together  
Love love  
Thats enough for me
