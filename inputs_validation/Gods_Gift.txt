Up up and away  
Would you trust me  
Would you love me  
Then it must be  
  
Worldwide stunner oh man Ima  
Reign on the game make it storm and thunder  
Grab an umbrella bitch and go stand under  
And bundle up its gonna be a cole ass summer  
You niggas so last summer  
Onto the new on onto the new shit  
Jigga wouldnt even take my CD when he seen me  
Two years later bitch we made it on onto the Blueprint  
Now hows that for persistence  
Cole World comin call back up assistance  
Same broads used to hang up on my walls  
Now they come up out their drawers hows that for a mistress  
Hell bent heaven sent Lord I repent if I ever sinned  
Now I know I aint the richest but I still wanna ball  
Put money over bitches but we still underdogs  
  
Chorus  
Did you miss me  
No I dont know where Im goin but Im goin now is you comin with me  
Up up and away hey do you trust me  
If I was on my last dollar dead broke assed out would you love me  
Then it must be a match made in heaven  
Gods Gift  
Gods Gift  
Gods Gift  
Motherfucker this is Gods gift  
  
Pussy my passion  
Man I just cant help it I see a cookie I grab one  
Lookin for some nookie Im tryna scoop me a bad one  
Every verse I spit it just like it could be my last one  
Ever since I got on  
Ive been on a mission to fuck the bitches I missed out on  
Excheerleader hollerin whats up  
Now her nigga beat her now thats fucked up  
What type of little fuck boy hitter  
Woman baby wouldnt put his hands on a nigga  
I aint bitter boy thats all you  
Plus I just fucked her fore she called you  
Dry your eyes baby Ill drive you home  
Older hoes sayin my how youve grown  
I came up fucked the game up  
Show my momma Ill survive on my own  
  
Chorus
