Take another bite  
Itll be alright  
Whats wrong will soon feel right  
Dangerous tonight  
  
Take another sip  
Let it kiss your lips  
And let a little drip on your thighs  
  
If you let me Ill untie your sensuality  
Ill open up your heart and satisfy my greed  
  
Chorus  
Im dangerous Im a dying breed  
Poisonous like a centipede  
Im capable of the foulest deed  
Dangerous at night  
Im dangerous like a razorback  
Deadly like a heart attack  
Well I dont bend and I dont crack  
Dangerous tonight  
  
Take another turn  
The rules have all been burned  
And youve got tricks to learn  
Dangerous tonight  
  
Play another role  
Try and lose control  
And stain your soul to red from white  
In my mind oh a million voices tell me no  
Its prime crime time and I gotta let it go  
  
Im dangerous like a broken glass  
Im a flesh fanatic psychopath  
I can cause you pain and make it last  
Dangerous tonight  
Im dangerous when the sun goes down  
So cross yourself dont fool around  
Ill drag your heart into the ground  
Dangerous tonight  
  
If you let me Ill untie your sensuality  
Ill open up your heart and satisfy my greed  
  
Chorus  
  
Im dangerous like a broken glass  
Im a blood bubonic psychopath  
I can cause you pain and make it last  
Dangerous tonight
