I know it doesnt seem that way  
But maybe its the perfect day  
Even though the bills are piling  
And maybe Lady Luck aint smiling  
  
But if wed only open our eyes  
Wed see the blessings in disguise  
That all the rain clouds are fountains  
Though our troubles seem like mountains  
  
Theres gold in them hills  
Theres gold in them hills  
So dont lose heart  
Give the day a chance to start  
  
Every now and then life says  
Where do you think youre going so fast  
Were apt to think it cruel but sometimes  
Its a case of cruel to be kind  
  
And if wed get up off our knees  
Why then wed see the forest for the trees  
And wed see the new sun rising  
Over the hills on the horizon  
  
Theres gold in them hills  
Theres gold in them hills  
So dont lose faith  
Give the world a chance to say  
  
A word or two my friend  
Theres no telling how the day might end  
And well never know until we see  
That theres gold in them hills  
  
Theres gold in them hills  
So dont lose heart  
Give the day a chance to start  
  
Theres gold in them hills  
Theres gold in them hills
