Who needs remote control  
From the Civic Hall  
Push a button  
Activate  
You gotta work an youre late  
  
Its so grey in London town  
With a panda car crawling around  
Here it comes  
Eleven oclock  
Where can we go now  
  
Cant make a noise  
Cant get no gear  
Cant make no money  
Cant get outta here  
  
Big business it dont like you  
It dont like the things you do  
You got no money  
So you got no power  
They think youre useless  
An so you are  puuuuuuunnnnnk  
  
They had a meeting in Mayfair  
They got you down an  
They want to keep you there  
It makes them worried  
Their bank accounts  
Thats all that matters  
And you dont count  
  
Cant make no progress  
Cant get ahead  
Cant stop the regress  
Dont want to be dead  
  
Look out those rules and regulations  
  
Who needs the Parliament  
Sitting making laws all day  
Theyre all fat and old  
Queuing for the House of Lords  
  
Repression  gonna start on Tuesday  
Repression  gonna be a Dalek  
Repression  I am a robot  
Repression  I obey
