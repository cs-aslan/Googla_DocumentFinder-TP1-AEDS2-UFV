Why doesnt she need him for a father  
Not only maidens can occupy my shack  
Goring my manhood turns a man off  
Like Pepe LePew would say  
Hey hey hey  then we clash  
  
I got my diddly spayed  
  
She laughs about it  
Shrinking inflections if the wind blows just right  
Jacking themselves off polyester  
I wanna jump this isnt right  
Hey when am I getting it back  
  
I dont know why  
I got a joke too silly to say  
Dont touch the balls  
I got a dick dick  hear my fucking hate  
  
If youre wondering its gaining monthly If your world is getting ugly  
Fiberglass insulated the sky is cotton candy  
Spawning downstream El Rancho Ovulate  
Feeling cant help me romp  
Bill just fuck me take me anal  
Billys slit reminds me of someone  
Im sick of paying for the love boat  
Tony and Tenille say wanna jump rope  
And I say look  
  
I got my penis spayed  
I got a little tail  
  
I got my dingaling spayed  
Nothing hard  
I gotta be around pussy  
Dont let me fall  
I got a hehhehwell you cant live  
We got my dingaling spayed  
When ya gonna learn
