I can remember when we first met  
We really had some times  
When the success started to kick in  
Life turned into a mess  
  
Why cant we still be friends  
Why judge me for what I am  
Cant we go back again  
Im still the same man  
  
You figured out really who I am  
Dont bet your life on that  
Why cant you see me for what I am  
Were human dont forget that that  
  
Why cant we still be friends  
Why judge me for what I am  
Cant we go back again  
Im still the same man  
  
Still around  
Dont follow me around  
Playin me like a clown  
Facing life not real not real  
  
Lifes not real Not real Repeat x 2  
Why cant we still be friends  
Why judge me for what I am  
Cant we go back again  
Im still the same man  
  
Same man Repeat x 4
