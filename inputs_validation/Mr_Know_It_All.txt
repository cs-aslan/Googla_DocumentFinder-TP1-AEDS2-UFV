Mr Know It All  
Well ya think you know it all  
But ya dont know a thing at all  
Aint it something yall  
When somebody tells you something bout you  
Think that they know you more than you do  
So you take it down another pill to swallow  
  
Mr bring me down  
Well ya like to bring me down dont ya  
But I aint laying down baby  
I aint going down  
Cant nobody tell me how its gonna be  
Nobody gonna make a fool out of me  
Baby you should know that I lead not follow  
  
Chorus  
Oh you think that you know me know me  
Thats why Im leaving you lonely lonely  
Cause baby you dont know a thing about me  
You dont know a thing about me  
You aint got the right to tell me  
When and where to go no right to tell me  
Acting like you own me lately  
Yeah baby you dont know a thing about me  
You dont know a thing about me  
  
Mr Play Your Games  
Only got yourself to blame  
When you want me back again  
But I aint falling back again  
Cause Im living my truth without your lies  
Lets be clear baby this is goodbye  
I aint coming back tomorrow  
  
Chorus  
  
So what youve got the world at your feet  
And you know everything about everything  
But you dont  
You still think Im coming back but baby youll see  
  
Chorus  
  
Mr Know It All  
Well ya think you know it all  
But ya dont know a thing at all  
Yeah baby you dont know a thing about me  
You dont know a thing about me
