Woke up into a dream  
And I was walking  
Up and down the streets  
Of Cairo  
  
And then I heard a voice  
That said I know you  
Its time for you to turn  
And face me  
  
Her hair was long  
Her eyes reached out and touched me  
She said I know just  
What it is youre after  
  
Death is all around you  
So you look for freedom  
I know where to find it  
Lets go to the river  
  
We sailed upon the Nile  
I was enchanted  
By the beauty in her magic  
She showed me that my fears were unimportant  
And then she touched me  
With her vision  
  
Her skin was dark  
Her voice was liquid fire  
She said I am your mate  
And souls desire  
  
Love is all around you  
Light is deep within you  
Life is always flowing  
Lets go down the river
