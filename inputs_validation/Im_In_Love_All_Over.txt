Well Im flying out of Tulsa  
Trying to get out to the coast  
Missing my connections  
But its you I miss the most  
  
Im in love all over echo  
Im in love all over echo  
Well Im in love all over  
Everywhere I go  
  
Well my heart feels like bursting  
When you walk into the room  
My lips just start thirsting  
For another kiss from you  
  
Im in love all over echo  
Yes Im in love all over echo  
Im in love all over  
From my head down to my shoes  
  
In search of true affection  
I found a new direction  
And thats straight to you  
Oh I use to like to play around  
But I can see thats all over now  
  
Oh my friends sure like to gossip  
Think they know the gospel truth  
Words leak like a faucet  
When it comes to me and you  
  
Im in love all over echo  
Oh Im in love all over echo  
Yes Im in love all over  
Everywhere I go  
Im in love all over  
From my head down to toes  
Im in love all over  
Everybody knows about me and you  
  
In search of true affection  
I found a new direction  
And thats straight to you  
Oh I use to like to play around  
But I can see thats all over now  
  
Oh my friends sure like to gossip  
Think they know the gospel truth  
Words leak like a faucet  
When it comes to me and you  
  
Im in love all over echo  
Oh Im in love all over echo  
Yes Im in love all over  
Everywhere I go  
Im in love all over  
From my head down to toes  
Im in love all over  
Everybody knows about me and you  
  
Oh yes they do  
Cause Im in love all over  
Im in love all over  
Yes Im in love all over  
Yes Im in love all over
