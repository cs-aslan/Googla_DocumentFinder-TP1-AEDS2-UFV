You say not now its too late  
Nows not the time it can wait  
You never listen to me  
Some things are hard to forget  
Its time to do something you might regret  
You never listen to me  
  
I think that you must be blind  
Havnt you noticed that Im not around  
Waisting your precious time  
  
All that I want  
Is knowing that someone will notice me  
I cant go on  
Knowing that you never bother to listen to me  
  
Losing the will to survive  
You never act like you know Im alive  
You never listen to me  
  
All that I need  
Is knowing that someone remembers me  
I cant go on  
Knowing that you never bother to listen to me
