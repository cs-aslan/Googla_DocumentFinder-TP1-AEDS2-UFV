You built me up with your wishing hell  
I didnt have to sell you  
You threw your money in the pissing well  
You do just what they tell you  
REPENT thats what Im talking about  
I shed the skin to feed the fake  
REPENT thats what Im talking about  
Whose mistake am I anyway  
Cut the head off  
Grows back hard  
I am the hydra  
Now youll see your star  
Prick your finger it is done  
The moon has now eclipsed the sun  
The angel has spread its wings  
The time has come for bitter things  
REPENT thats what Im talking about  
I shed the skin to feed the fake  
REPENT thats what Im talking about  
Whose mistake am I anyway  
Cut the head off  
Grows back hard  
I am the hydra  
Now youll see your star  
The time has come it is quite clear  
Our antichrist  
Is almost here  
Cut the head off  
Grows back hard  
I am the hydra  
Now youll see your star  
When you are suffering know that Ive betrayed you
