Im always at the place where your friends meet  
Its the long way home but I walk your street  
And when I trip and fall right at your feet  
Its not accidental  
  
I make it like luck is in the air  
Every time you turn Im standing there  
You look into the stars our names are clear  
Its not accidental  
  
And when you get a wrong number  
Dont hang up too soon and wonder  
  
You are the one thats meant for me  
Im twisting fate to make believe  
Its all accidental  
This was always meant to be  
When youre in my arms then you will see  
It wasnt accidental  
  
I know you like the kind of clothes I wear  
Think I threw them on without a care  
The styles from a book  
You read a magazine you left  
Its not coincidental  
  
And even when you hear your favorite song  
You dont know but I put it on  
You bought the record yesterday so I knew what to play  
Its not coincidental  
  
And when you get a wrong number  
Dont hang up too soon and wonder  
  
You are the one thats meant for me  
Im twisting fate to make believe  
Its all accidental  
This was always meant to be  
When youre in my arms then you will see  
It wasnt accidental  
  
This all feels right time right place whoa  
Cause every time I see you face to face  
Our future calls  
Not saying I bend the truth  
Just doing my best to get you oh make you my destiny  
  
You are the one thats meant for me  
Im twisting fate to make believe  
Its all accidental  
This was always meant to be  
When youre in my arms then you will see  
It wasnt accidental  
  
You are the one thats meant for me  
Im twisting fate to make believe  
Its all accidental  
This was always meant to be  
When youre in my arms then you will see  
It wasnt accidental  
  
Its not accidental  
Accidental
