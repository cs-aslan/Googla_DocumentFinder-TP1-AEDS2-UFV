Whisper in the night  
Over silent evening air  
Angels gown shines white  
All at once youre glad shes there  
Daughter of your dream shine a guiding light for me  
For Ill be here till light  
Whisper in the night  
Till she has forgiven me  
  
Night turns into gold  
So the tide may turn today  
Though God gave the world  
Its not mine to throw away  
Daughter of your dream shine a guiding light for me  
For Ill be here till light  
Whisper in the night  
Till she has forgiven me  
La da da  da  
Whisper in the night  
Till she has forgiven me  
  
Help to face what the day may bring  
Angels sing  
You were sent to make the night be kind  
What will I find  
  
Snowflake bird she came  
Taking grey clouds from your door  
Face the midnight sun  
You have something to live for  
Daughter of your dream shine a guiding light for me  
For Ill be here till light  
Whisper in the night  
Till she has forgiven me  
La da da  da  
Whisper in the night  
Till she has forgiven me
