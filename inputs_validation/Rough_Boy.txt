What in the worlds come all over me  
I aint got a chance of one in three  
Aint got no rap aint got no line  
But if youll give me just a minute Ill be feelin fine  
  
I am the one who can fade the heat  
The one they all zzay just cant be beat  
Ill shoot it to you straight and look you in the eye  
So gimme just a minute and Ill tell you why  
Im a rough boy Im a rough boy  
  
I dont care how you look at me  
Because Im the one and you will see  
We can make it work we can make it by  
So give me one more minute and Ill tell you why  
Im a rough boy Im a rough boy
