Heart sick at the sight of the  
Status Seeker  
In a sense Im not beyond reproach  
The aspiration to drop a name  
When any rose might smell the same  
Maybe youll figure it out someday  
I want to know you now  
You know Ive always believed in you  
  
Nothing is sacred  
You draw the bottom line  
With a dollar sign  
Change of opinion  
At the drop of a dime  
Graceless intrusion  
Are you sanctified in your  
Judgment of me  
All that I deserve is what you were  
Unable to see  
  
In a garden where the seeds were  
Spilled  
I favored the few that stood strong  
In the sun  
As I reached for the profit of my prize  
I found I had trampled the forgotten  
Ones  
  
Nothing is sacred  
You draw the bottom line  
With a dollar sign  
Change of opinion  
At the drop of a dime  
Graceless intrusion  
Are you sanctified in your  
Judgment of me  
All that I deserve is what you were  
Unable to see  
  
Youre running in circles  
And Im turning away  
You refused to believe  
Now Im turning away  
  
Nothing is sacred  
You draw the bottom line  
With a dollar sign  
Change of opinion  
At the drop of a dime  
Graceless intrusion  
Are you sanctified in your  
Judgment of me  
All that I deserve is what you were  
Unable to see  
  
Youre running in circles  
And Im turning away  
You refused to believe  
Now Im turning away
