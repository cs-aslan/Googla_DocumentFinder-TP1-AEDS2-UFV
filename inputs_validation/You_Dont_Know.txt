You dont know where you belong  
You should be more careful  
As you follow blindly along  
You just need to belong somehow  
  
Relying on rhetoric  
Not well versed on topics  
Any idea what youre talking about  
Revisions of history  
Fair well in some company  
But dont shove that bullshit down my throat  
  
You dont know where you belong  
You should be more careful  
As you follow blindly along  
To find something to swear to  
Till you dont know whats right from wrong  
You just need to belong somehow  
  
Left suppresses right  
Right suppresses left  
So whats the left and whats right  
Youre told what to wear  
Youre told what to like  
Id be nice if youd think for yourself sometime  
But you dont  
  
Now you dont know where you belong  
You should be more careful  
As you follow blindly along  
  
Mix sheer hypocrisy with mediocrity  
Youll play it safe every time  
So life turns up empty  
And youre so dissatisfied  
Who are you blaming this time  
Dont you know
