How could she dance that slow bandera  
Shuffle to some cowboy hustle  
How she makes those trophy buckles shine shine shine  
Wildeyed and Mexican silvered  
Trickin dumb ol Cousin Willard  
Into thinkin that hes got her this time  
  
Hill country holky tonkin Rita Ballou  
Every beer joint in town has played the fool for you  
Backslidin barrel ridin Rita Ballou  
Aint a cowboy in Texas would not ride a bull for you  
  
Shes a rawhide rope and velvet mixture  
Walkin talkin Texas texture  
High timin barroom fixture kind of a girl  
Shes the Queen of the Cowboys  
Look at ol Willard grinnin now boys  
Youd a thought theres less fools in this world  
  
Hill country holky tonkin Rita Ballou  
Every beer joint in town has played the fool for you  
Backslidin barrel ridin Rita Ballou  
Aint a cowboy in Texas would not ride a bull for you  
  
So good luck Willard and heres to ya  
And heres to Rita and I hope shell do ya  
Right all night  
Lord I wish I was the fool in your jeans  
  
Hill country holky tonkin Rita Ballou  
Every beer joint in town has played the fool for you  
Backslidin barrel ridin Rita Ballou  
Aint a cowboy in Texas would not ride a bull for you  
  
Hill country holky tonkin Rita Ballou  
Every beer joint in town has played the fool for you  
Backslidin barrel ridin Rita Ballou
