Babe I cant change my tune for you  
But Ill sing any melody you want me to  
Ill sing all the country and all of the blues  
But babe I cant change my tune for you  
So dont ask me to  
  
But babe I can pull some strings for you  
Ill pull them until each one is in tune  
Ill try to make things go like you want to  
But babe I cant change my tune for you  
But Ill pull strings for you  
  
Maybe Ill write a song about you  
Even though I am just passing through  
Ill sing you all the old songs and all of the new  
Cause babe I cant change my tune for you  
So dont ask me to
