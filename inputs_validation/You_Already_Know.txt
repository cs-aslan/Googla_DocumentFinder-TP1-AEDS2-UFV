This bipolar love affair  
It just aint where its at for me anymore  
So dont let the door hit you when you leave  
  
You throw me in the fire just to save my life  
A pretty little liar when I call you out  
Youd rather put up a fight  
Than just come clean  
  
Get on your way to making someone else feel loved  
And higher than they ever thought they could go  
You already know  
Im giving you up and letting me down  
Stop pretending that youre gonna turn yourself around  
You already know  
Know know know  
You already know  
Know know know  
Dont ask me why  
You already know  
  
I was a shoulder you leaned on  
You made me feel like the next James Bond  
Double Ohseven oh hell you were heaven to me  
but while you were singin what I wanted to hear  
You started breaking ground on a new frontier  
Always makin love but never with me  
  
So get on your way to makin someone else feel loathin  
And higher than they ever thought they could go  
You already know  
Giving you up and letting me down  
Stop pretending that youre gonna turn yourself around  
You already know  
Know know know  
You already know  
Know know know  
Dont ask me why  
You already know  
  
You already know that Im done waiting  
Going crazy hating myself for loving you  
At least the one side of you I thought I knew  
You already know  
  
You already know  
You already know  
Know know know  
You already know  
Know know know  
Dont ask me why
