I come to you sweet man  
And Im Im fallin on my knees  
I come to you pretty papa  
Fallin on my knees  
Ask if you dont have nobody  
Wont you kindly take me please  
Cause Im a mighty tight woman  
Im a real tight woman  
Lord Im a jack of all trades  
I can be your sweet woman  
Also be your slave  
Lord I can do things so good  
You will swear that I behave  
I got all of them sayin  
That Im tight in everything I do  
I got all the men cryin  
Im a broad that will never be blue  
What I need is a good man  
And I will make him happy too  
If youre a married man  
You aint got no business here  
Cause when youre out with me  
I might make your wife shed a tear  
Cause Im a mighty tight woman  
There is nothing nothing that I fear
