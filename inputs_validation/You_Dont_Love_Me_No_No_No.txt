Chorus  
No no no  
You dont love me and I know now  
No no no  
You dont love me so let me go now  
I cant let you go cant let you go  
If you ask me baby  
I shouldve left you a long time ago no  
  
Playas gonna play  
At least thats what they say  
Well I know that for myself now  
You know I love you  
You said you loved me babe  
Then you played your game  
A game that I know all too well now  
Well I used to buy your lines  
But its time for me to sail now  
  
Chorus  
  
First you tellin me no  
But please tell me yes  
Without some of this stress  
Straight up tell me yes  
Gimme the keys to ya chest  
Ya chest will rise neva rest  
As ya chest you got me feelin like im climbin on Mount Everest  
Hey Rihanna  
Your lovin really put me to the test  
But if you shoulda let me soon the answer will yes  
Yes to this yes to that yes to whateva you suggest  
So please say yes  
No no no  
  
Verse 2  
  
Haters gonna hate  
Let them hate  
I found out much to late  
I think I know were a little hot now  
The truth leads to the lies  
The heart aint always right  
And I see that love is blind now  
Boy you use to have my trust  
Without no trust there aint no us boy
