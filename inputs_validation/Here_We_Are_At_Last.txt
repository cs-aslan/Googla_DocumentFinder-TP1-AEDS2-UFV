Here we are at last  
Children in the dark  
Running from the past  
Into the unknown  
Secrets from the heart  
Promises we make  
Lips that never part  
Until the dawn breaks  
I cant remember feeling this familiar  
I see myself becoming his  
It frightens me to learn  
That love is  
Finally here at last  
No place left to hide  
Too powerful to fast  
To keep it inside  
Everythings so new  
So innocent so true  
Were reaching for that star  
cause darling here we are  
Here at last  
instrumental  
I cant remember feeling this familiar  
I feel myself becoming his  
It strengthens me to finally see that  
Love is here at last  
No place left to run  
The actors have unmasked  
The play has begun  
Every moment true  
Each day for lovers who  
Have never come this far  
But darlin here we are  
Here at last  
Here at last
