Come be my April Fool  
Come youre the only one  
Come on your rusted bike  
Come well break all the rules  
  
Well ride like writers ride  
Neither rich nor broke  
Well race through alleyways  
In our tattered cloaks so  
  
Come be my April Fool  
Come well break all the rules  
  
Well burn all of our poems  
Add to Gods debris  
Well pray to all of our saints  
Icons of mystery  
Well tramp through the mire  
When our souls feel dead  
With laughter well inspire  
Then back to life again  
  
Come youre the only one  
Come be my April Fool  
Come come  
Be my April Fool  
Well break all the rules
