If you listen to the night  
You can hear the darkness call  
I can barely stand to wait  
I can barely stand at all  
Cmon closer to me now  
Its like were sharing the same skin  
We gotta get out of this jail  
We gotta let the future in  
So many things in your life  
That your bound to regret  
Why didnt I do that  
Why didnt I do this  
So many chances you lost  
That youll never forget  
Why didnt I make it  
Why didnt I take it right there  
The loneliest words youll ever know  
If onlyif only it was so  
The emptiest words that therell ever be  
It could have been me it could have been me  
The loneliest words youll ever know  
If onlyif only it was so  
The emptiest words that therell ever be  
It could have been me it could have been me  
Youll have to pay for it later  
If you dont get it when its going for free  
Believe me  believe me   
  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
Its something thats always been so  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
  
And one of these nights  
Youre gonna show me that you already know  
Theres a feast waiting for you  
And youve never even gotten a taste  
Its later than you think and  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
You shouldnt tremble when we touch  
Theres no reason for these fears  
Its a promise that was made  
Weve been promised this for years  
I wanna show you it all  
What to do and where and how  
Cause well never be as young as we are right now  
Well never be as young as we are right now  
  
So many cries in the night  
That you try to ignore  
Why didnt I do this  
Why didnt I do that  
So many unanswered prayers  
So many unopened doors  
Why didnt I take it  
Why didnt I make it come true  
The loneliest words youll ever know  
If only  if only it was so  
The emptiest words that therell ever be  
It could have been me  
It could have been me  
The loneliest words youll ever know  
If only  if only it was so  
The emptiest words that therell ever be  
It could have been me  
It could have been me  
Youll have to pay for it later  
If you dont get it when its going for free  
Believe me believe me believe me  
  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
Its something that has always been so  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
  
And one of these nights  
Im gonna show you that you already know  
Theres a feast waiting for you  
And youve never even gotten a taste  
Its later than you think and  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
Theres a feast waiting for you  
And youve never even gotten a taste  
Its later than you think and  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
  
Tyre tracks and broken hearts  
Thats all were leaving behind  
It doesnt matter what were losing  
It only matters what were going to find  
Tyre tracks and broken hearts  
Thats all were leaving behind  
It doesnt matter what were losing  
It only matters what were going to find  
Tyre tracks and broken hearts  
Thats all were leaving behind  
It doesnt matter what were losing  
It only matters what were going to find  
Tyre tracks and broken hearts  
Thats all were leaving behind  
It doesnt matter what were losing  
It only matters what were going to find  
Theres a feast waiting for you  
And youve never even gotten a taste  
Its later than you think and  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste
