If this is paradise  
Then I dont recognize  
That subtle look thats in your eyes  
And in the distance now  
I hear your whispers love  
And see my dreams go fading by by  
  
Take me away  
From this moment  
  
I wanna shut the door  
Im not taking anymore  
Its me they want to give away  
  
And I dont want to know  
And I dont want to go  
All I want is home tonight  
All I want is home tonight  
  
A love so precious now  
Lights me up inside  
My darkest night could never hide  
Elegant and divine  
She wears a diamond smile  
The girls perfection guaranteed  
  
Dont take away  
This moment from me  
  
I wanna hold her close  
Its her I want the most  
Dont want to let her slip away  
  
And I dont want to know  
And I dont want to go  
All I want is home tonight  
All I want is home tonight  
All I want is home  
Tonight  
  
And I dont want to know  
And I dont want to go  
And I dont want to know
