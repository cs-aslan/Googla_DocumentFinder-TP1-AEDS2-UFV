Seasons come and seasons go  
But still the world she be turnin  
I often stop and wonder  
How long will God  
Keep the fire burnin  
Sometimes it seems the worlds gone mad  
But I know theres hope for our children  
Cause Jesus told us what to do  
And I know nows not the time to give in  
  
Long as we have breath  
Lets keep pushing  
Fighting to the death  
Stop at nothing  
His never ending flame  
Keep it burning Ooh  
Long as the big ball  
Long as the big ball is turning  
  
Time to feed the hungry heart  
Thats never tasted compassion  
Its the time to spread the word  
Hey theres a love that is everlasting  
Yellow line down an upon road  
Dont say where shes going  
Still we follow just the same  
Oh there is hope of a new horizon  
  
Long as we have breath  
Lets keep pushing  
Fighting to the death  
Stop at nothing  
His never ending flame  
Keep it burning Ooh  
Long as the big ball  
Long as the big ball is turning  
  
Round and round and round it goes  
But God is in control  
He knows just where were going  
Yes the futures in His hands  
I dont know when we will land  
Oh no  
But Ill keep right on trusting in the Masters plan  
  
Long as we have breath  
Lets keep pushing  
Fighting to the death  
Stop at nothing  
His never ending flame  
Keep it burning Ooh  
Long as the big ball  
Long as the big ball is turning
