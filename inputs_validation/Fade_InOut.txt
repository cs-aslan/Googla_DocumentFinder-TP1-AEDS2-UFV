Get on the rollercoaster  
The fairs in town today  
Youve gotta be  
Bad enough to beat the brave  
  
So get on the helter skelter  
Bowl into the fray  
Youve gotta be  
Bad enough to beat the brave  
  
You fade inout  
You fade inout  
Without a doubt  
I dont see no shine  
  
Today is just a daydream  
Tomorrow well be castaway  
Coming inout of nowhere  
Singin rhapsody  
  
Youve gotta be  
Bad enough to want to be  
Sitting upside a high chair  
The devils refugee  
  
Is gonna be blinded by the light  
That follows me  
She fade inout  
She fade inout  
  
Without a doubt  
I dont see no shine  
Today is just a daydream  
Tomorrow shell be castaway  
  
We fade inout  
We fade inout  
Without a doubt  
I dont see no shine  
  
Today is just a daydream  
Tomorrow well be castaway  
Get on the rollercoaster  
The fairs in town today  
  
Youve gotta be  
Bad enough to beat the brave  
Get on the helter skelter  
Step into the fray  
  
Youve gotta be  
Bad enough to beat the brave  
Youre fading out  
Youre fading out
