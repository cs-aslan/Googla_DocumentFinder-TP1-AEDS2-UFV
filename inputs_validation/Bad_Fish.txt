When you grab a hold of me  
Tell me that Ill never be set free  
But Im a parasite  
Creep and crawl I step into the night  
Two pints of booze  
Tell me are you a badfish too  
Are you a badfish too  
Aint got no money to spend  
I hope the night will never end  
Lord knows Im weak  
Wont somebody get me off of this reef  
  
Baby youre a big blue whale  
Grab the reef when all duck diving fails  
I swim but wish Id never learned  
The waters too polluted with germs  
I dive deep when its ten feet overhead  
Grab the reef underneath my bed its underneath my bed  
Aint got no quarrels with God  
Aint got no time to grow old  
Lord knows Im weak  
Wont somebody get me off of this reef  
  
Aint got no quarrels with God  
Aint got no time to get old  
Lord knows Im weak  
Wont somebody get me off of this reef
