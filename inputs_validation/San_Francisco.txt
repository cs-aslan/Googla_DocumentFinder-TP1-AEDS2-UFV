It only takes a tiny corner of  
This great big world to make a place you love  
My home up on the hill  
I find I love you still  
Ive been away but now Im back to tell you  
  
San Francisco  
Open your golden gate  
You let no stranger wait outside your door  
San Francisco  
Here is your wandering one  
Saying Ill wander no more  
Other places only make me love you best  
Tell me youre the heart of all the golden west  
  
San Francisco  
Welcome me home again  
Im coming home  
To go roaming no more
