I woke up this morning feeling so good feeling much better than I though I
could  
Bluebird would you lend me your wings today I feel like flying away  
I feel like flying away  
Fly up to Mexico maybe to Spain Ive got some good friends who live up in
Maine  
Fly up to Paris and sample the wine aint that a magnificient line  
Oh forgive me for saying Id always be blue  
I should have known better that sun has come through  
My silver lining is turned inside out theres the sun everyone shouts  
Oh I feel like flying away  
  
Fly up to Mexico maybe to Spain  
I feel like flying away
