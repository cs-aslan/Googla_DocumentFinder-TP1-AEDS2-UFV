Oh Carol  
Dont let him steal your heart away  
Yeah Ive got to love you darling  
If it takes me all night and day  
Beat cool down  
Over cool down  
I can hear that highway sound  
  
Carol  
Dont let him steal your heart away  
Well Im gonna love you darling  
If it takes me all night and day  
  
Whoa Carol  
Oh Carol  
Dont let him steal your heart away  
Yeah Im gonna love you darling  
If it takes me all night and day  
  
One more time  
Whoa Carol  
Come on Carol  
Oh yeah  
Oh right  
Well Im gonna love you darling  
If it takes me all night and day
