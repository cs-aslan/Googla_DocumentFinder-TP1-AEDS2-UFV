Well Im a middleaged teenager  
Im a man of angst and leisure  
Doin the best that I can do  
My problems are incorrect  
Ive always got it around my neck  
Hey Im just like you  
Yeah Ive done some good and Ive done some bad  
But the most fun that I ever had  
Was singing my songs for you  
And if I should go astray  
Id get down on my knees and pray  
Say God forgive me for what I do  
  
Oh in our lives  
Theres no right way for us to live it  
You know in our lives  
Theres a time to cry and a time to forget it  
  
Well Im a broke down humble man  
Baby thats just who I am  
And thats from me to you  
Well I feel good here  
Got about a million more years  
To do what it is I gotta do  
And if some day you happen to be passin my way  
Say hi hello how are you  
Well Ill return the gesture in kind  
And hope that things are fine  
And you all just do what you gotta do  
  
Oh in our lives  
Theres no right way for us to live it  
Oh in our lives  
Theres a time to cry and a time to get with it  
You know in our lives theres no right way for us to live it  
  
Well Im a broke down humble man  
Thats just who I am  
And thats from me to you  
Yeah Im a broke down humble man  
Yeah thats just who I am  
And thats from me to you  
  
Oh in our lives  
You know in our lives  
Yeah in our lives theres no right way for us to live it
