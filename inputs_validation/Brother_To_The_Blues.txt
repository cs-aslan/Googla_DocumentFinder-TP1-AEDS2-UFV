You and I dont need an introduction  
Neither one of us has that much to lose  
Cause youre just a sister to satisfaction  
And Im just a brother to the blues  
  
Now I dont have to tell you nights are lonely  
Theres a hunger in our eyes that tells the news  
And youre just a sister to satisfaction  
And Im just a brother to the blues  
  
Its hard to tell exactly which direction  
We might go at any given time  
Its just a constant search for affection  
And we need all the comfort we can find  
  
I know you can feel this attraction  
From a night of love that both of us could use  
Cause youre just a sister to satisfaction  
And Im just a brother to the blues  
  
Yes youre just a sister to satisfaction  
And Im just a brother to the blues
