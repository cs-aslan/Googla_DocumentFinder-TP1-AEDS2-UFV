Here we come  
Through the market square  
With our funny  
Clothes and hair  
  
Aristotle and Socrates  
Plato and Diogenes  
Four fab scholars  
With our Greek philosophies  
  
Hey hey  
Were the Thinkers  
Wondering what  
Life is for  
  
Were paid to  
Try and think up  
The answer  
To that and more  
  
People found me irritating  
Thanks to my interrogating  
Like a toddler was always asking why  
  
What is wisdom what is beauty  
What is nature what is duty  
Taught everything I know to  
This next guy  
  
Im Plato was his pupil thinker  
Ended up with inky fingers  
Writing every word he taught me  
Down  
  
Also had my own theory  
Like for everything that we see  
Theres a perfect version  
To be found Ooh  
  
Hey hey  
Were The Thinkers  
Mega brainy  
Ancient Greeks  
  
Were always  
Busy thinking  
Cause the truth is  
What we seek  
  
My name is Diogenes  
Im not one to say thanks or please  
Poked statues and walked barefoot  
In the snow  
  
Never believed in possessions  
Thought they gave the wrong impression  
Put faith in total freedom  
Dont you know  
  
I studied at Platos academy  
Taught Alex the Great I know everything me  
Intrigued by the world  
Wanted to show it all  
  
I took all their theories higher  
Discovered water ether earth air and fire  
Learned every science  
Im Mr KnowItAll  
  
Hey hey  
Were The Thinkers  
Very witty  
Very wise  
  
No one  
Can outwink us  
We are Athens  
Brainiest guys  
  
Not everyone likes smarties though  
Even Socrates had his foe  
When tried for treason  
He simply said Why  
  
They sentenced him to drink hemlock  
He said You know if I take stock  
I am annoying Ill take that  
And die   
  
Hey hey  
Were The Thinkers  
Politicians  
Gave us strife  
  
But we dont  
Give a tinkers  
Cause we taught them  
All about life  
  
Ooohhh
