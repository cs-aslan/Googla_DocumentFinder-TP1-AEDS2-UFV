Theres nothing you can say  
Nothing you can do  
Theres nothing in between  
You know the truth  
  
Nothing left to face  
Theres nothing left to lose  
Nothing takes your place  
  
When they say  
Youre not that strong  
Youre not that weak  
Its not your fault  
And when you climb up to your hill  
Up to your place  
I hope youre well  
  
Theres nothing left to prove  
Theres nothing I wont do  
Theres nothing like the pain  
I feel for you  
  
Nothing left to hide  
Nothing left to fear  
I am always here  
  
When they say  
Youre not that strong  
Youre not that weak  
Its not your fault  
And when you climb up to your hill  
Up to your place  
I hope youre well  
  
What you want  
What you lost  
What you had  
What is gone is over  
  
What you got  
What you love  
What you need  
What you have is real  
  
Its not enough  
Its not enough  
Its not enough  
Its not enough Im sorry  
  
Its not enough  
Its not enough  
Its not enough  
Its not enough  
  
When they say  
Youre not that strong  
Youre not that weak  
Its not your fault  
And when you climb up to your hill  
Up to your place  
I hope youre well  
  
Its not enough  
No  
Its not enough  
Its not enough
