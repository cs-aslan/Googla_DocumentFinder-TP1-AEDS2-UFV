Just a routine procedure  
Were watching you  
A sample of your dna  
The things you do  
Queuing to be fingerprinted  
You could be dangerous  
Going to the usa  
Another routine procedure  
Were on your case  
Driving in your car  
Weve seen your face  
Stopped and searched and questioned  
Some place before  
Can you prove who you are  
Hey hey  
Dont ask me how

Got the bus to the station  
Music playing in my head  
Ran to get on the tube train  
Police shot someone dead  
  
Dont ask me how Were all criminals now  
  
Hey hey  
Dont ask me how  
Were blamed  
Were all criminals now  
Hey hey
