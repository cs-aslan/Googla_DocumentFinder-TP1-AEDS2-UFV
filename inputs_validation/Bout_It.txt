Get your mind on top cause the hustle dont stop  
If the girl dont chew then my name aint Joc  
The money dont flip then the block aint hot  
If she dont scream your name then your game just shot  
I got a couple reasons you can call me the boss  
And I drop a couple stacks and watch your head get lost  
The Joc a real catch shorty better believe that  
If you aint a ride or die bring them car keys back  
Take your foot off the brake baby goon ride out  
If them sucka wanna hate put em in timeout  
I get that cake and youll soon find out  
If you ever cross me youll get crossed out

Get to the floor what you waitin for  
Cause we could ride the beat straight to the top  
Waitin too long and now its my time  
To show em all that its not a game  
Cause I dont care what Im looking like  
I just gotta show you that Im not going nowhere  
You think you know me but you have no idea

Respect my gangsta respect my shine  
Put your click in chick if you step outta line

Couple more album before I retire  
Most of these rappers aint nuttin but liars  
Hollered by the killers when they sang in the choir  
Straight from the bottom and Im trying to get higher  
Too many strikes got too many priors  
Messing with us like playing with fire  
Get your wicks split time to meet your messiah  
I seen it before aint runnin no more  
Its gonna catch up with me baby dont stop  
Get to the floor what you waitin for  
Cause we could ride the beat straight to the top  
Waitin too long and now its my time  
To show em all that its not a game  
Cause I dont care what Im looking like  
I just gotta show you that Im not going nowhere  
You think you know me but you have no idea  
Act like youre bout it well let me put this in your ear  
If you really bout it incomprehensible like you dont care  
If you bout it I dont doubt it  
Show me that youre sho nuff bout it bout it  
Now I been walking up this road trying to find which way to go  
Crying upon my face sometimes it seems like I dont know  
Now I got a chance to touch where things beyond my reach  
And the answers right in front of me  
Yeah yeah yeah yes it is yeah  
You think you know me but you have no idea  
Act like youre bout it well let me put this in your ear  
If you really bout it incomprehensible like you dont care

Show me that youre sho nuff bout it bout it  
You think you know me but you have no idea  
Act like youre bout it well let me put this in your ear
