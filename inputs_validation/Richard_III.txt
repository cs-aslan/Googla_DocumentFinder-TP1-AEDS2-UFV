I was sure that youd love me  
To that hope I did cling  
Cause Im Richard the third  
And Everybody loves a king  
  
Thought I did a good job  
Why do you disagree  
Theres a lot of people  
Spreading nasty rumors bout me  
Every word is a lie  
So Im singing this song  
Cause the history books  
Have been telling it wrong  
  
I Never had a limp  
Always walked my full height  
Never had a hump  
And my arm was all right  
Never took the crown  
With the ilegal power  
Never killed my nephews  
The princes in the tower  
Tudor propaganda  
Its all absurd  
Time to tell the truth  
Bout King Richard the third  
  
My brother Edward died  
His kids too young to rule  
So I took the throne  
Why not Im nobodys fool  
  
Thomas More wrote a history  
Said Id murdered Edwards boys  
Shakespeare said their death  
Was an evil ploy  
But I say those two  
Are historical vandals  
Theyve ruined my image  
I mean what a scandal  
  
Never bumped off  
Those harmless young heirs  
Never buried them  
Under the Tower of London stairs  
Never poisoned my wife  
Bumped off her daddy  
This is me sweet Richard  
Do I look like a baddy  
Never was twofaced  
Sure youll agree  
I was misunderstood  
King Richard three  
  
Can you imagine it  
Im the last Plantagenet  
Beaten by Henry  
In the Wars of the Roses  
The Tudor dynasty  
Didnt care that much for me  
Now Im painted as a baddy  
Thats why one supposes continues while next verse is sang  
  
Never forget  
When you hear of my crimes  
Never drowned my brother  
In a massive vat of wine  
Never said a horse  
My kingdom for a horse   
Who made that up  
Why William Shakespeare of course  
  
Now my tale is told  
You wont hear a bad word  
About a special ruler  
King Richard the third  
Arg its a wasp its a wasp
