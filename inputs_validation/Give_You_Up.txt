Ive been hiding lost in the love of another Ive followed the moon and a
song and I thought it would take me forever to find a place where I belong I
watch a rainbow rise I give you all iv  
  
  
I could never give you up the way you make my love shine I could never give
you up the way you make true love shine  
  
I believe you when you say you dont want to be lonely Ill carry your heart
like a bridge when you need all the time you can find to get the hurt out of
your mind Ill watch the rain go by an  
E you all Ive got  
  
Cause I could never give you up
