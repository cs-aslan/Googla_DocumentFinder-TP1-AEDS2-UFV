Raekwon  
High potency top smoke a bag of black  
And feel the vibe want to be wise  
We form on a rising corner mean five  
Laws in disguise throw on your slides  
Young niggas racist smokers is basic  
We seen the eyes laying up playing the cut  
What stay in the truck something told me duck  
Folding me up my shoulders struck  
Out of luck fuck the potters up  
Fell on a daze like a Golotta snuff  
Niggas tried to body me up  
Im in the lobby bleeding  
Niggas in the witness office probably eating  
And sprinting and beefing when they heard the shots  
Called the precinct and seen barber nieces beasting  
Niggas shot Shalar features and shocked her was a Elisis  
Bent the spinal cordless creatures  
Im gagging and flagging a cab down  
Guess who in the Benz wagon dragging my sound down  
Macking it was Dale Breedy the greedy  
Caniving ass snake genie  
Cop with a bikini will murder charge and benini  
Im feeling wheezy and the drain from the cheeba  
Grieving aint even looking decent  
Seeing police niggas reaching  
  
That splash against my hollow bones  
That rocks my  
  
Inspectah Deck  
Fleeing the crime scene speeding  
Beefing leaving behind cream  
Not even peeping that I was leaking  
Wont see the precinct just got a recent case beaten  
Still jakes are creeping  
Dont blow ya spot stay the weekend  
Keep the ruger peeling whos squealing  
Few knew the dealings  
Keep the steel concealed in  
Cause we got no time for feelings  
Eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing  
Million dollar block villain plotting on a killing  
Feel like a superhero talking like a true Deniro  
They boost his ego path and broke down  
Reduced to zero  
Cops feel we poors hoping Ill reveal my source source  
  
That splash against my hollow bones  
That rocks my soul  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Ghostface  
Outside the check cashing flashing  
Dipped in fashion  
Five cherryfaced fagots tried to cash in  
They keep laughing Ghost you get ya face bashed in  
Who gave you these privileges son why you maxing  
And we  
Feigning to take those move slow  
Im hearing how you broke Robs nose  
And I heard you keep a banging hammer  
Golden brass diamonds embroideries  
That was stolen that you havent reported g  
Make very little noise my shit hiccup  
Dont make this big stick up bigger  
Me and the boys I thought for a second then chose  
Rather than froze  
Had the Jim star on my hand  
Yo what the fuck yo thats when I ripped Timothy  
Snatch and dip john like imbaggable  
Had the mini axe tool faxed him  
Shots rang off bing bogglededumb  
  
That splash against my hollow bones
