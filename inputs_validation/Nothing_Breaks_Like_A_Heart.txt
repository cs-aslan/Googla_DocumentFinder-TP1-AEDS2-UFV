You dont love me anymore  
I can feel it  
But I want you more than before  
So I conceal it  
Walk on walk on baby  
Dont look back  
This happy face is just a disguise  
Oh baby  
When love dies  
  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
Glass shatters even cars fall apart  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
  
When you walked out  
At first I celebrated  
But this footloose fancy free stuffs overrated  
  
Oh I got my way  
Now Im free to roam  
These tears of laughter are just lies  
Oh baby  
When love dies  
  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
Glass shatters even cars fall apart  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
  
Oh oh oh  
I feel so bad bad bad  
Oh oh oh  
Im so sad sad sad  
I wasnt this shook in the LA earthquake  
How much can one heart break  
  
You dont love me anymore  
I can feel it  
But I want you more than before  
So I conceal it  
Walk on walk on baby  
Dont look back  
This crumbling heart is no surprise  
  
Oh baby when love dies  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
Glass shatters even cars fall apart  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
Oh nothing breaks like a heart  
Oh nothing breaks like a heart  
Oh nothing breaks like a heart
