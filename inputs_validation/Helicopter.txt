Oh heli Oh heli  
Im crouching here with a telescope in hand  
Looking across our lego land  
I really think its about time that she came down  
She a laughing giggly whirlybird  
She got to be obscene to be obheard  
I really think its about time that she came down  
  
And I object to all the air male that she pick up  
The air male that she pick up  
The air male that she pick up  
  
When shes up there twirling round  
Just like a helicopter  copter  
Shes landing on the town  
Its about time that I stopped her  stopped her  
When shes up there twirling round  
Just like a helicopter  copter  
Oh heli  Oh heli  
  
Now shes away from convent shes gone wild  
Grown from a nice young lady to a child  
I really think its about time that she came down  
She a laughing giggly whirlybird  
She got to be obscene to be obheard  
I really think its about time that she came down
