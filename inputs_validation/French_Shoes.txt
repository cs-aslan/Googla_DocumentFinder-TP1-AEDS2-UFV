He was a good lookin guy  
Stood about six foot three  
Long brown hair  
As nice as he could be  
Everybody liked him  
But he didnt have a clue  
He looked silly as hell  
In those funny French shoes  
  
You know the type  
Without any heels  
Leather soles  
Kind of a slip on deal  
He was cavalier  
Whether hed win or lose  
But he looked silly as hell  
In those funny French shoes  
  
I know its not right  
To judge a man by his clothes  
By the way that he looks  
Or the people he may know  
Im embarrassed to say  
If I had to choose  
I could never really trust  
Any man wearing those funny French shoes  
  
Funny French shoes  
Funny French shoes  
No man should be wearin  
Those funny French shoes  
They look good on a womans foot  
I must say that they do  
But no guy should be wearin  
Those funny French shoes  
  
Get some socks on man
