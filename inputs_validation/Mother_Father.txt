She sits alone an empty stare  
A mothers face she wears  
Where did she go wrong  
The fight is gone  
Lord help this broken home  
  
Chorus  
Hey mother father sister  
Hey come back tryin believein  
Hey mother father dreamer  
  
Dont you know that Im alive for you  
Im your sevenths son  
And when lightin strikes the family  
Have faith believe  
  
With dreams he tried lost his pride  
He drinks his life away  
One photograph in broken glass  
It should not end this way  
  
Through bitter tears  
And wounded years those ties  
Of blood were strong  
So much to say those yesterdays  
So now dont you turn away  
  
Chorus
