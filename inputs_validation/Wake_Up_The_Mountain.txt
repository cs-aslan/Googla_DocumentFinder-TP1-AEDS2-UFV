Some people die  
And even never realize  
Mans growing blind  
Is seeimg owly with the eyes  
We think were strong  
Belive we never could be wrong  
But we are fools  
Because were dying by the rules  
  
Though I cannot change the world were living in  
I can always change myself  
  
One more to count in  
Wake up the mountain  
All colours slowly  
Turning to gray  
All world is darkling  
Wake up the mountain  
And we will find it once more again  
  
Cash and carees  
Built on the countless sums of fears  
All goods of life  
Begin to vanish behimd tears  
How do we know  
Why did we choose the way we follow  
Why do we hurt  
Why do we hurt the ones we love  
  
Though I cannot change the worlg were living in  
I can always change myself  
  
One more to count in  
Wake up the mountain  
All colours slowly  
Turning to gray  
All world is darkling  
Wake up the mountain  
And we will find it once more again  
  
We made the rules and we can change them  
Break down the orders one by one  
We made the laws and we can break them  
Break down the mountain stone by stone by stone  
  
One more to count in  
Wake up the mountain  
All colours slowly  
Turning to gray  
All world is darkling  
Wake up the mountain  
And we will find it once more again
