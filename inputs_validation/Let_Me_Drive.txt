Honey youre from Detroit  
You know a lot about wheels  
Summertime hot rods givin me the brake job  
Dont stop til I start to squeal  
Cause baby I love your body  
As much as your automobile  
But I need more than a tune up  
Ill take you with the moon up  
  
Just let me drive mmm let me drive  
I want to feel the power comin alive  
Darlin let me drive mmm let me drive  
Let me behind the wheel  
I want to know how your hot rod feels  
  
Honey I hear youre the expert  
You can keep me at the edge of my seat  
Take me through a tight turn keep me at a slow burn  
Feet to the floor and I feel the heat  
And baby they say youll deliver  
Lovin up and down the street  
But its your turn to be driven  
Seemon and slide over  
  
Get in and let me drive mmm let me drive  
I want to feel all that power comin alive  
Darlin let me drive mmm let me drive  
Let me vehind the wheel  
I want to know how your hot rod feels  
  
Baby dont ask directions  
Who needs a map when theres time to ride  
Baby youre hands are shakin  
Give me the keys turn on the lights  
Im gonna burn out this road tonight  
  
Ooooh let me drive mmm let me drive  
I want to feel your power comin alive  
And darlin let me drive mmm let me drive  
Let me behind the wheel  
I want to know how your hot rod feels  
  
Let me drive oooh let me drive  
Let me behind the wheel  
I want to know how your hot rod feels  
Let me drive let me drive  
Let me behind the wheel
