Stay with me a while  
Rise above the vile  
Name my final rest  
Pored into my chest  
  
Chorus  
Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate  
Wilted scenes for us who couldnt wait  
Drained by the coldest caress stalking shadows ahead  
Halo of death all I see is departure  
Mourners lament but its me whos the martyr  
  
Pledge yourself to me  
Never leave me be  
Sweat breaks on my brow  
Given time ends now  
  
Chorus  
  
Spirit painted sin  
Embers neath my skin  
Veiled in pale embrace  
Reached and touched my face  
  
Chorus
