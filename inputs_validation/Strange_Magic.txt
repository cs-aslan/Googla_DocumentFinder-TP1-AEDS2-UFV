Youre sailing softly through the sun  
In a broken stoneage dawn  
You fly so high  
  
I get a strange magic  
Oh what a strange magic  
Oh its a strange magic  
Got a strange magic  
Got a strange magic  
  
Youre walking meadows in my mind  
Making waves across my tide  
Oh no oh no  
  
I get a strange magic  
Oh what a strange magic  
Oh its a strange magic  
Got a strange magic  
Got a strange magic  
  
Oh Im never gonna be the same again  
Now Ive seen the way its got to end  
Sweet dream sweet dream  
  
Strange magic  
Oh what a strange magic  
Oh its a strange magic  
Got a strange magic  
Got a strange magic  
  
Its magic its magic its magic  
Strange magic  
Oh what a strange magic  
Oh its a strange magic  
Got a strange magic  
Got a strange magic  
You know I got a strange magic
