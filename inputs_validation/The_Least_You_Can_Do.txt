I was lying awake last night waiting for your call  
But if the rumors are true that wont bother you at all  
Im trying hard to understand  
What it takes to be your man  
Now I dont have to wonder anymore  
  
Least you can do is say youre sorry  
Least you can do is give me back my heart  
Just give me back my heart  
  
Seems living in hope was wrong those years I was away  
Thinking your letters I never received had gone astray  
You said youd always be there for me  
Like a fool I thought youd be  
Now I dont know what I was thinking at all  
  
But the least you can do is say youre sorry girl  
Least you can do is give me back my heart  
I wont come around no more  
You wont find me standing outside your door  
Least you can do is tell me why tell me why  
  
The least you can do is say youre sorry girl  
Least you can do is give me back my heart  
I wont come around no more  
You wont find me standing outside your door  
But the least you can do is tell me why  
  
I wont be your fool anymore  
Theres no need to be cruel anymore no no  
Least you can do is say youre sorry girl  
The least you can do is give me back my heart  
Just give me back my heart
