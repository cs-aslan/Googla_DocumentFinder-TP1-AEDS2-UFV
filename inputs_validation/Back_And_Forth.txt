i dont like to be back  
  
You see things in life  
And youre bit surprise what you see  
Life your whole life is changes  
You go through changes in your life  
One second youve got it made  
Next second youre down in the dumps  
And it goes back and forth  
Throughout your whole life  
One second youve got the most beautiful girl in the world  
Next second you dont even have a girlfriend no more  
And it goes back and forth  
And back and forth you known  
And this is life man its changes  
This is what you gotta go through throughout your whole lifetime  
  
Im going through changes  
Im going through changes  
Im going through changes  
  
And it goes back and forth  
And back and forth you known  
  
Never  
Never  
Land
