I fell too hard and much too deep in love with you  
I let you come and go at will it seems  
Youre back again this time you say forever  
But I wonder just how long forever means  
How long is forever this time  
How long until one night you dont come home again  
How long is forever this time how long until Im all alone again  
  
People say Im foolish when I take you back  
And it could be theyre right but who can say  
Youll be welcome here within my arms forever  
Even when forever ends for me today  
How long is forever this time
