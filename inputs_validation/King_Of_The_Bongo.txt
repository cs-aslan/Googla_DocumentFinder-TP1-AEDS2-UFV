King of the Bongo  
M Chao  
  
Mama was queen of the mambo  
Papa was king of the Congo  
Deep down in the jungle  
I started bangin my first bongo  
  
Every monkeyd like to be  
In my place instead of me  
Cause Im the king of bongo baby  
Im the king of bongo bong  
  
I went to the big town  
Where there is a lot of sound  
From the jungle to the city  
Looking for a bigger crown  
  
Play my boogie  
For the people of big city  
But they dont go crazy  
When Im bangin in my boogie  
  
Im the king of the bongo king of the bongo bong  
Hear me when I come  
King of the bongo king of the bongo bong  
Hear me when I come  
  
Nobodyd like to be in my place instead of me  
Cause nobody go crazy when Im bangin on my boogie  
Im the king without a crown hanging loose in a big town  
Im the king of the bongo Im the king of the bongo bong  
King of the bongo king of the bongo bong  
Hear me when I come  
  
They say that Im a clown  
Making too much dirty sound  
They say there is no place for little monkey in this town  
Nobodyd like to be in my place instead of me  
Cause nobody go crazy when Im bangin on my boogie  
Im the king of the bongo king of the bongo bong  
  
Hear me when I come  
King of the bongo king of the bongo bong  
  
Bangin on my bongo all that swing belongs to me  
Im so happy theres nobody in my place instead of me  
Im a king without a crown hanging loose in a big town  
But Im the king of bongo baby Im the king of bongo bong  
King of the bongo king of the bongo bong  
Hear me when I come baby king of the bongo king of the bongo bong  
Hear me when I come  
  
Mama was queen of the mambo  
Papa was king of the Congo  
Deep down in the jungle  
I started bangin my first bongo  
  
Every monkeyd like to be  
In my place instead of me  
Cause Im the king of bongo baby  
Im the king of bongo bong  
  
King of the bongo king of the bongo bong  
Hear me when I come  
King of the bongo king of the bongo bong  
Hear me when I come
