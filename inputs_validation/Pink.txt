Pink its my new obsession yeah  
Pink its not even a question  
Pink on the lips of your lover  
Cause pink is the love you discover  
Pink as the bing on your cherry  
Pink cause you are so very  
Pink its the color of passion  
  
Cause today it just goes with the fashion  
Pink it was love at first sight  
Yeah pink when I turn out the light  
And pink gets me high as a kite  
And I think everything is going to be alright  
No matter what we do tonight  
  
You could be my flamingo  
Cause pink its a new kinda lingo  
Pink like a deco umbrella  
Ffff its kink that you dont ever tell her  
Yeah pink it was love at first sight  
Then pink when I turn out the light  
Yeah pink gets me high as a kite  
And I think everything is going to be alright  
No matter what we do tonight  
  
Yeah  
I want to be your lover  
Ffff I I wanna wrap you in rubber  
And its pink as the sheets that we lay on  
Cause pink Its my favorite crayon  
  
Yeah  
Pink it was love at first sight yeah  
Pink when I turn out the light  
Yeah pink its like red but not quite  
And I think everything is going to be alright  
No matter what we do tonight
