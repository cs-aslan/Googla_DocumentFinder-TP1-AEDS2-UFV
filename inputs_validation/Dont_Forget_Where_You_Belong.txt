Been a lot of places  
Ive been all around the world  
Seen a lot of faces  
Never knowing where I was  
  
On the horizon  
Oh well I know I know I know  
I know the sun will be rising  
Back home  
  
Living out of cases  
Packing up and taking off  
Made a lot of changes  
But not forgetting who I was  
  
On the horizon  
Oh well I know I know I know  
I know the moon will be rising  
Back home  
  
Dont forget where you belong home  
Dont forget where you belong home  
If you ever feel alone dont  
You were never on your own  
And the proof is in this song  
  
Ive been away for ages  
But Ive got everything I need  
Im flicking through the pages  
Ive written in my memory  
  
I feel like Im dreaming  
Oh so I know I know I know  
I know that Im never leaving  
No I wont go  
  
Dont forget where you belong home  
Dont forget where you belong home  
If you ever feel alone dont  
You were never on your own  
And the proof is in this song  
  
Lights off when they should be on  
Even stars and skies above  
Short days when the nights are long  
When I think of the days Ive gone  
Dont matter how far Ive gone  
Ill always be around oh  
  
Dont forget where you belong home  
Dont forget where you belong dont forget it home  
If you ever feel alone dont  
You were never on your own  
Never never  
  
Dont forget where you belong home  
Dont forget where you belong dont forget it home  
If you ever feel alone dont  
You were never on your own you were never  
And the proof is in this song  
  
Home  
Dont forget it  
Home  
If you ever feel alone dont  
You were never on your own you were never  
And the proof is in this song  
  
Never forget it  
This song  
Dont forget it  
No I never forget it  
This song  
You were never
