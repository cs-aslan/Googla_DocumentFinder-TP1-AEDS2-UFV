How could I be this at ease with him  
Pour out my heart as I please with him  
He isnt youhe isnt you  
When will I feel so in bloom again  
When will his voice warm the room again  
He isnt youhe isnt you  
Memories may fade in the shadows behind me  
But therell be the dream  
That will always remind me  a dream that  
Ill be forever comparing him to  
For love me he may even die for me  
Sweep every cloud from the sky for me  
He may be king  
But hell never be you
