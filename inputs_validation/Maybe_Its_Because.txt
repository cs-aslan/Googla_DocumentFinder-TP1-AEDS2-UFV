Maybe its because the kiss you gave me touched my heart and went right
through  
I cant tell you why I only know that I fell helplessly in love with you  
How I fell in love with you  
I could say youre grand and therefore I care for you so  
But there is a why and wherefore and Id like to know  
Maybe its because the star I wished on made a certain wish come true  
Or it just should be that you were meant for me and maybe I was meant for
you  
Maybe its because the song we danced to told a story old and new  
I cant figure out just why it came about
