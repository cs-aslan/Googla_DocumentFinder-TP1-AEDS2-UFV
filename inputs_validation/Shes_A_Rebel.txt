Shes a rebel  
Shes a saint  
Shes salt of the earth  
And shes dangerous  
  
Shes a rebel  
Vigilante  
Missing link on the brink  
Of destruction  
  
From Chicago to Toronto  
Shes the one that they  
Call old whats her name  
  
Shes the symbol  
Of resistance  
And shes holding on my  
Heart like a hand grenade  
  
Is she dreaming  
What Im thinking  
Is she the mother of all bombs  
Gonna detonate  
  
Is she trouble  
Like Im trouble  
Make it a double  
Twist of fate  
Or a melody that  
  
She sings the revolution  
The dawning of our lives  
She brings this liberation  
That I just cant define  
Nothing comes to mind  
  
Shes a rebel  
Shes a saint  
Shes salt of the earth  
And shes dangerous  
  
Shes a rebel  
Vigilante  
Missing link on the brink  
Of destruction  
  
Shes a rebel  
Shes a rebel  
Shes a rebel  
And shes dangerous  
Shes a rebel  
Shes a rebel  
Shes a rebel  
And shes dangerous
