Machines  
  
Its a machines world  
Dont tell me I aint got no soul  
When the machines take over  
It aint no place for rock and roll  
  
They tell me I dont care  
But deep inside Im just a man  
They freeze me they burn me  
They squeeze me they stress me  
With smoke blackened pistons of steel they compress me  
But no one but no one but no one can wrest me away  
Back to humans  
  
We have no disease no trouble of mind  
No thank you or please no regard for the time  
We never cry we never retreat  
We have no conception of love or defeat  
  
Whats that machine noise  
Its bytes and megachips for tea  
Its that machine boys  
With random access memory  
Never worry never mind  
Not for money not for gold  
  
Its software is hardware  
Its heartbeat is timeshare  
Its midwifes a disc drive  
Its sex life is quantised  
Its selfperpetuating a parahumanoidarianised  
  
Back to humans  
Back to humans  
  
Back to machines  
Machines  
  
Living in a new world  
Thinking in the past  
Living in a new world  
How you gonna last  
Machine world  
  
Back to humans  
  
Its a machines world  
Thinking in the past back to humans  
Living in a new world  
How you gonna last  
Machine world  
  
Its a machines world  
  
Back to humans  
Living in a new world  
How you gonna last  
Machine world  
Its a machines world
