Youre burnin my heart  
Youre burnin my mind  
Youre spoilin my art  
Youre wasting my time  
No taste in your actions  
No taste in your line  
No tears now  
Just dont do you ever mind  
  
You say you want to be a superstar  
Youre givin up half to get that far  
You say you want to ride a diamond car  
But i dont like your fancy car  
  
Hey hey hey dont you want to see  
Im not your steppin stone  
Hey hey hey ive gotta be free  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
  
Youre in love with success  
Youre spilling my wine  
No part of my address babe  
Your ways arent mine  
You may got the money  
But your wastin my life  
Im not your bugs bunny  
And youre not my wife  
  
You say you only do it for affect  
But you dont want to see what i detest  
I think youre depraved  
Im gonna leave you so  
But you cant see what i see so let me go  
  
Hey hey hey dont you want to see  
Im not your steppin stone  
Hey hey hey ive gotta be free  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
  
Hey hey hey dont you want to see  
Im not your steppin stone  
Hey hey hey ive gotta be free  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
  
Hey hey hey dont you want to see  
Im not your steppin stone  
Hey hey hey ive gotta be free  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone
