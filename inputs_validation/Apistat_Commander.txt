All  
All along the rocks  
Its good  
Its not so hard now  
  
I  
I bite my tongue  
Who cares  
Theres chance to draw on  
  
Once you left you left for someone  
All thats left has wilted up  
Oh this relief its the hardest thing  
Oh my God oh my God oh my God  
  
Once you left you left for someone  
All thats left has wilted up  
Oh this relief its the hardest thing  
Oh my God oh my God oh my God  
  
Children  
Hell never come  
I know its written  
I lost my thumb  
  
He  
Could talk me down  
Still lost it  
Its just her goal  
  
Once you left you left for someone  
All thats left has wilted up  
Oh this relief its the hardest thing  
Oh my God oh my God oh my God  
  
Once you left you left for someone  
All thats left has wilted up  
Oh this relief its the hardest thing  
Oh my God oh my God oh my God  
  
Once you left you left for someone  
All thats left has wilted up  
Oh this relief its the hardest thing  
Oh my God oh my God oh my God
