Live the lifestyles so the average dime piece  
Wanna have my lovechild and roll L style  
A man hostile but my Queens niggas run wild  
So when I skate through niggas strain to smile  
Peep my profile and my icedout dial  
I tap my horn say What up but never smile  
And deuce ass niggas is noodles  
And your broke ass stripper weave is lookin like a poodle

Then pour some Cristal for my foes that fell  
Hard as hell big fell I excel rock bells Im
