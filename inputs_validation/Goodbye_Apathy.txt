I cant sleep no not like I used to  
I cant breathe in and out like I need to  
Its breaking ice now to make any movement  
Whats your vice You know that mines the illusion  
  
All at once  
As Im trying  
I can help you out  
Just to keep things right  
Ill be what you need Ill do anything  
I kill myself to make everything perfect for you  
Goodbye apathy so long apathy  
  
So dont sit still  
Dont you move away from here  
  
So goodbye apathy  
As Im trying  
So long fancy free  
Just to keep things right  
Goodbye apathy I dont wanna be you  
Kill myself to make everything perfect for you  
  
I dont walk right not like I used to  
Theres a jump in my step as I rush to see you  
I could be happy here as long as youre near to me  
As long as youre close to me  
  
Now that Im alright  
As Im trying  
I can help you out  
Just to keep things right  
Ill be what you need Ill do anything  
I kill myself to make everything perfect for you  
Goodbye apathy so goodbye apathy  
  
So dont you stop pushing me

So goodbye apathy

So long fancy free  
Just to keep things right  
Goodbye apathy I dont wanna be you
