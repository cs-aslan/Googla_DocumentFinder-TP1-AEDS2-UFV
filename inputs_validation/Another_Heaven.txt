He lived his life in isolation a man without a name  
Saddled with a reputation from cheyonne he came  
He moved down south when the money ran out  
Turned to a life of crime  
Things werent all that different then  
Theyd kill you for a dime  
  
Never showed no mercy had a heart of stone  
His hands were dirty stained to the bone he said  
  
Chorus  
Turn back its too late  
All I can do is pray theres another heaven  
Turn back its too late  
Sinners like me need another heaven  
Turn back its too late  
Ive run out of time    
  
He lived at least a dozen lifetimes luck was on his side  
The only friend he ever had  
Was his trusty fortyfive  
His final words to my grandaddy were  
Son you must be brave  
All thats left of what he was  
Is in this texas grave  
  
He could smell the danger  
He knew the end was near  
Thru the smoke and whiskey one thing was clear  
  
Chorus  
Turn back its too late  
All I can do is pray theres another heaven  
Turn back its too late  
Sinners like me need another heaven  
Turn back its too late  
All I can do is pray theres another heaven  
Turn back its too late  
Ive run out of time    
Look me in the eyes I wanna see it comin  
  
Never showed no mercy had a heart of stone  
His hands were dirty stained to the bone  
  
Chorus  
Turn back its too late  
All I can do is pray theres another heaven  
Turn back its too late  
Sinners like me need another heaven  
Turn back its too late  
All I can do is pray theres another heaven  
Turn back its too late  
Sinners like me need another heaven yeah yeah  
Turn back its too late  
Ive run out of time    
Look me in the eyes I wanna see it comin
