He is three  
Ones in the middle unmoved  
Waiting  
To show what he sees  
To the other two  
To the one attackingso afraid  
And the one that keeps trying to love and trust  
And getting himself betrayed  
In the planoh  
The divine plan  
God must be a boogie man  
  
Ones so sweet  
So overly loving and gentle  
He lets people in  
To his innermost sacred temple  
Blind faith to care  
Blind rage to kill  
Whyd he let them talk him down  
To cheap work and cheap thrills  
In the plan oh  
The insulting plan  
God must be a boogie man  
  
Which would it be  
Mingus one or two or three  
Which one do you think hed want the world to see  
Well world opinions not a lot of help  
When a mans only trying to find out  
How to feel about himself  
In the planoh  
The cockeyed plan  
God must be a boogie man
