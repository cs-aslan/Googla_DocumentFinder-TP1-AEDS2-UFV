One oclock in the morning  
People piling into the door  
Drinks are still coming in and  
Im barely humming and the  
Audience is screaming for more  
Somebodys locked in the bathroom  
Manager cant find the key  
I pay that man but from where I stand  
Its looking like a prisoner is me  
  
Chorus  
  
So wont you kick it in second wind  
We got two more hours to go  
Is there anymore hope of scoring anymore coke  
And weve still got to do another show  
  
My mind started to wander  
In the middle of the second song  
Dreaming I was at sea just my baby and me  
When the words started coming out wrong  
Waitresses are picking up glasses  
The bartender screamed last call  
When I looked to my right I saw a terrible sight  
And the bass man took a bad fall  
  
Its three oclock in the morning  
Running on adrenalin  
What Im trying to say is that tomorrows the day  
And weve got to do it over again
