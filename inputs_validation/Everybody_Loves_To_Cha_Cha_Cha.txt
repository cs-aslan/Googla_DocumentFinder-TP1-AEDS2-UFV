Took my baby to the hop last night  
What to my surprise  
When we got there she hit me  
With the news right between the eyes  
She said she couldnt do the cha cha cha  
  
I told her not to worry now  
Theyd play some other dance  
But we sat there for an hour and a half  
And we never got a chance  
Cause every song they played  
Was the cha cha cha  
  
I told her not to worry  
Theres still one thing we can do  
Let me take you by your hand tonight  
I want to teach this dance to you  
I taught my baby how to cha cha cha  
  
We kept on dancing for an hour or two  
What do you think Id see  
We hadnt practiced for a time or two around  
She was doing it better than me  
You know my baby loves to cha cha cha  
  
Everybody loves to cha cha cha  
Little children love to cha cha cha  
Everybody loves to cha cha cha  
Sam Cooke himself in the midnight hour  
Everybody loves to cha cha cha
