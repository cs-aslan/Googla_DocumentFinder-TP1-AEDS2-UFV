jack hues  
Well Im sitting on a hillside  
On the warmer side of cool  
With the future laid before me  
Like a green and misty jewel  
And to climb above the tree line  
Is only for the fools  
So they say  
So they say  
Chorus  
On the warmer side of cool  
What you feel in your heart is all  
On the warmer side of cool  
Being cool its so easy to be cold  
Well Im sitting by the seaside  
On the warmer side of cool  
With the ocean spread before me  
Like a blue and misty jewel  
And if I jump into the water  
Would an angel break my fall  
So they say  
So they say  
On the warmer side of cool  
What you feel in your heart is all  
Im sorry if I offend you  
If Im a little bit intense  
But I never did intend us  
To be sitting on the fence  
And even though Im guilty  
Of making total sense  
Im happy when its all  
On the warmer side of cool  
Repeat chorus  
It aint cool to be cold
