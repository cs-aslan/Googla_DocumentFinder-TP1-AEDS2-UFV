When I was seventeen found out just what it means  
If you can get it free it just aint worth a damn  
When I heard the preacher say dont throw your life away  
I got that message and I wrote it on the wall  
I dont want anybody tellin me lies no I dont want your diamond ring  
Cause you aint got my size  
  
I want money money thats what I need  
I got Cadillac dreams please mister dontcha take it from me  
Give me money money more than I need I got Cadillac dreams waitin on me  
Cadillac dreams Cadillac dreams  
  
When I had the young boy blues I paid some young boy dues  
I learned the hard way theres a heartbreak every day  
Stone cold reality came crashing down on me  
Well life was hard on me but I still dont give a damn  
When I was seventeen I was an angry young man  
But I wont let just anybody tell me who I am  
  
I just want money money thats all I need  
I got Cadillac dreams hey mister dontcha take it from me  
Give me money money more than I need these Cadillac dreams are waitin on
me  
Didnt have the time of day till this dream was born  
You cant take that away you cant take that away from me  
  
When I was seventeen there was this beauty queen  
Checked in a one room suite the back seat of my car  
When you want all the best things money can buy  
You gotta reach down inside of you to reach up to the sky  
  
Yeah I want money money thats all I need  
I got Cadillac dreams hey mister you cant take that from me  
I want money money more than I need I got Cadillac dreams waitin on me  
Money money thats what I need  
Were drivin in my Chevy with my Cadillac dreams  
Someday one day just you and me  
Well ride inside these Cadillac dreams
