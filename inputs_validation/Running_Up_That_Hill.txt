It doesnt hurt me  
Do you want to feel how it feels  
Do you want to know that it doesnt hurt me  
Do you want to hear about the deal that Im making  
You its you and me  
  
And if I only could  
Id make a deal with God  
And Id get him to swap our places  
Be running up that road  
Be running up that hill  
Be running up that building  
If I only could oh  
  
You dont want to hurt me  
But see how deep the bullet lies  
Unaware Im tearing you asunder  
Ooh there is thunder in our hearts  
  
Is there so much hate for the ones we love  
Tell me we both matter dont we  
You its you and me  
Its you and me wont be unhappy  
  
And if I only could  
Id make a deal with God  
And Id get him to swap our places  
Be running up that road  
Be running up that hill  
Be running up that building  
Say if I only could oh  
  
You  
Its you and me  
Its you and me wont be unhappy  
  
seemon baby seemon darling  
Let me steal this moment from you now  
seemon angel seemon seemon darling  
Lets exchange the experience oh  
  
And if I only could  
Id make a deal with God  
And Id get him to swap our places  
Be running up that road  
Be running up that hill  
With no problems  
  
And if I only could  
Id make a deal with God  
And Id get him to swap our places  
Be running up that road  
Be running up that hill  
With no problems  
  
And if I only could  
Id make a deal with God  
And Id get him to swap our places  
Be running up that road  
Be running up that hill  
With no problems
