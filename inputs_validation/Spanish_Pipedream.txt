She was a levelheaded dancer on the road to alcohol  
And I was just a soldier on my way to montreal  
Well she pressed her chest against me  
About the time the juke box broke  
Yeah she gave me a peck on the back of the neck  
And these are the words she spoke  
  
Chorus  
Blow up your tv throw away your paper  
Go to the country build you a home  
Plant a little garden eat a lot of peaches  
Try an find jesus on your own  
  
Well I sat there at the table and I acted real naive  
For I knew that topless lady had something up her sleeve  
Well she danced around the bar room and she did the hoochycoo  
Yeah she sang her song all night long tellin me what to do  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I was young and hungry and about to leave that place  
When just as I was leavin well she looked me in the face  
I said you must know the answer  
she said no but Ill give it a try  
And to this very day weve been livin our way  
And here is the reason why  
  
We blew up our tv threw away our paper  
Went to the country built us a home  
Had a lot of children fed em on peaches  
They all found jesus on their own
