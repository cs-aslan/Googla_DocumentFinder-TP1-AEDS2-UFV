Im doing you a favor  
As Im taking all your money  
I guess I should feel sorry  
But I dont even trust me  
Theres bad news creeping up  
And you feel a sudden chill  
How do you do My name is trouble  
Im coming in for the kill  
And you know I will  
Set the ball arollin  
Ill be clicking off the miles  
On the Train of Consequences  
My boxcar life of style  
My thinking is derailed  
Im tied up to the tracks  
The Train of Consequences  
There aint no turning back  
No horse ever ran as fast  
As the money that you bet  
Im blowing on my cards  
And I play them to my chest  
Lifes fabric is corrupt  
Shot through with corroded thread  
As for me I hocked my brains  
Packed my bags and headed West
