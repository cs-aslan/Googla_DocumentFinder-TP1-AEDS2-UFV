We knew it must have been late  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
We had no time to wait  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
I went to light the fireplace  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
I planned it all this way  
And  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
  
I snuggled close to her  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
Her heart began to purr  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
I held my breath inside  
And then  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
I put my arms around her  
Ticktock  
  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo go away silly bird  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo go away silly bird  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo go away silly bird  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo  
  
I put that birdie away  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
His cuckoo was gone to stay  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
We both apologized for why  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
Forgave that doggone cuckoo  
  
I went back to her side  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
I had to swallow my pride  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
The fire had almost died away  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
We just got situated  
Ticktock  
  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo go away silly bird  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo go away silly bird  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo go away silly bird  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo  
  
I took that clock apart  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
I broke the cuckoos heart  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
Hell never bother us again  
Ticktock  
Ticktock  
We just forgot about him  
Ticktock  
  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo go away silly bird  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo go away silly bird  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo go away silly bird  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo
