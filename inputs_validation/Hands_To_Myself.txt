Verse 1  
Cant keep my hands to myself  
No matter how hard Im trying to  
I want you all to myself  
Youre metaphorical gin and juice  
So come on give me a taste  
Of what its like to be next to you  
Wont let one drop go to waste  
Youre metaphorical gin and juice  
  
PreChorus  
Cause all of the doubts and the outbursts  
Keep making love to each other  
And Im trying trying Im trying trying  
All of the doubts and the outbursts  
Keep making love to each other  
And Im trying trying Im trying but I  
  
Chorus  
Cant keep my hands to myself  
My hands to myself  
Cant keep my hands to myself  
My hands to myself

But people say what they wanna say  
And you should know if I could

All of the doubts and the outbursts  
Keep making love to each other
