Hide in your shell cause the world is out to bleed you for a ride  
What will you gain making your life a little longer  
Heaven or hell was the journey cold that gave your eyes of steel  
Shelter behind painting your mind and playing joker  
  
Too frightening to listen to a stranger  
Too beautiful to put your pride in danger  
Youre waiting for someone to understand you  
But youve got demons in your closet  
And youre screaming out to stop it  
Saying lifes begun to cheat you  
Friends are out to beat you  
Grab on to what you scramble for  
  
Dont let the tears linger on inside now  
Cause its sure time you gained control  
If I can help you if I can help you  
If I can help you just let me know  
Well let me show you the nearest signpost  
To get your heart back and on the road  
If I can help you if I can help you  
If I can help you just let me know  
  
All through the night as you like awake and hold yourself so tight  
What do you need a secondhandmoviestar to tend you  
I as a boy I believed the saying the cure for pain was love  
How would it be if you could see the world through my eyes  
  
Too frightening the fires getting colder  
Too beautiful to think youre getting older  
Youre looking for someone to give an answer  
But what you see is just an illusion  
Youre surrounded by confusion  
Saying lifes begun to cheat you  
Friends are out to beat you  
Grab on to what you can scramble for  
Dont let the tears  
Just let me know  
I want to know  
I want to know you  
Well let me know you  
I want to feel you  
I want to touch you  
Please let me near you  
Can you hear what Im saying  
Well Im hoping Im dreamin Im prayin  
I know what youre thinkin  
See what youre seein  
Never ever let yourself go  
  
Hold yourself down hold yourself down  
Why dya hold yourself down  
Why dont you listen you can  
Trust me  
Theres a place I know the way to  
A place there is need to feel you  
Feel that youre alone  
Hear me  
I know exactly what youre feelin  
Cause all your troubles are within you  
Please begin to see that Im just bleeding to  
Love me love you  
Loving is the way to  
Help me help you  
Why must we be so cool oh so cool  
Oh were such damn fools
