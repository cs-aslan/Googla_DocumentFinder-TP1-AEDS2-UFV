Cry to me those were your very words  
You said cry to me cry to me  
There you stood laughing at my tears  
You said silly boy forget your childhood fears  
But you dont realize how strange it makes me feel  
Now were exchanging parts  
Stop youre breaking my heart  
Whos the crybaby now  
Cry to me cry to me youre the crybaby now  
Cry to me cry  
Whos the crybaby whos breaking my heart  
  
Lie to me you know that I know you too well  
So dont you lie to me lie to me  
I watch you from afar crying up your sleeve  
When they turn away
