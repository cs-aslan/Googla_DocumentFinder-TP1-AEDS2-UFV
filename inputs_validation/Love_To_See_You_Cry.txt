Come on Let me tell you  
  
Maybe I just want to touch you for your warm inside again  
Maybe I just want to let you the sweetest pleasure is me  
I dont know why why but I love to see you cry  
I dont know why why it just makes me feel like  
  
Are you coming to the moment  
When you know your heart can break  
Im inside you  
Im around you  
  
Just want to hear you cry again  
I dont know why why but I love to see you cry  
I dont know why why it just makes me feel like  
I dont know why why but I love to see you cry  
I dont know why why but it just makes me feel like  
  
You dont know how much it hurts when you fall asleep in my arms  
Before the morning comes  
I want to run away I want to run away  
I dont know why  
I dont know why  
I dont know why  
  
I dont know why why but I love to see you cry  
I dont know why why it just makes me feel like  
I dont know why why but I love to see you cry  
I dont know why why but it just makes me feel like
