Im looking for a Miracle Man that tells me no lies  
Im looking for a Miracle Man whos not in disguise  
  
I dont know where hell come from and I dont know where hes been  
But its not our Jimmy Sinner because hes so obscene  
  
Miracle Man got busted  
Miracle Man got busted  
  
Today I saw a Miracle Man on TV cryin  
Such a hypocritical man born again dying  
  
He dont know where hes goin but we know just where hes been  
Twas was our little Jimmy Sinner our eyes are on the screen  
  
Miracle Man got busted Miracle Man got busted  
Miracle Man got busted Miracle Man  
  
A Devil wears a crucifix brimstone and fire  
He needs another carnal fix to take him higher and higher  
  
  
Now Jimmy he got busted with his pants down  
Repent ye wretched sinners self righteous clown  
  
Miracle man got busted miracle man got busted miracle  
Man got busted miracle man got busted miracle man got  
Busted miracle man got busted miracle man got busted
