PreChorus  
When I was younger I couldnt wait for the days to pass  
Now I know theyll never last  
And I just want my childhood back  
I just want my childhood dead  
I just wanna take it back  
  
ChorusX2  
Cargo and despair  
All american made  
Lets see who burns the truest in the flame  
  
Huh

I just wanna take it back
