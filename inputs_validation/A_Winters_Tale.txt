Its winterfall  
Read skies are gleaming oh  
Seagulls are flyin over  
Swans are floatin by  
Smoking chimneytops  
Am I dreaming  
Am I dreaming  
  
The nights draw in  
Theres a silky moon up in the sky yeah  
Children are fantasizing  
Grownups are standin by  
What a super feeling  
Am I dreaming  
Am I dreaming  
Wohwohwohwoh  
  
Dreaming So quiet and peaceful  
Dreaming Tranquil and blissful  
Dreaming Theres a kind of magic in the air  
Dreaming What a truly magnificent view  
Dreaming A breathtaking scene  
With the dreams of the world  
In the palm of your hand  
  
Dreaming A cozy fireside chat  
Dreaming A little this a little that  
Dreaming Sound of merry laughter skippin by  
Dreaming Gentle rain beatin on my face  
Dreaming What an extraordinary place  
And the dream of the child  
Is the hope of the hope of the man  
  
Its all so beautiful  
Like a landscape painting in the sky yeah  
Mountains are zoomin higher uh  
Little girls scream an cry  
My world is spinnin and spinnin and spinnin  
Its unbelievable  
Sends me reeling  
Am I dreaming  
Am I dreaming  
  
Oooh  its bliss
