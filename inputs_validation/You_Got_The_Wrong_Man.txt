Your eyes say that youve been hurt before  
And you cant take the heartache anymore  
You think Ill do what hes done to you  
Break your trust and be untrue  
But baby this is me youre talkin to  
  
You got the wrong man its not me  
A case of mistaken identity  
I didnt break your heart you see  
What can I do to make you understand  
You got the wrong man  
  
I know you think that love will never last  
And you see your future like the past  
You dont want to make the same mistake  
You think that Im one more to make  
But baby Im not him for goodness sake  
  
You got the wrong man its not me  
A case of mistaken identity  
I didnt break your heart you see  
What can I do to make you understand  
You got the wrong man  
  
You think Ill do what hes done to you  
Break your trust and be untrue  
But baby this is me youre talkin to  
  
You got the wrong man its not me  
A case of mistaken identity  
I didnt break your heart you see  
What can I do to make you understand  
You got the wrong man
