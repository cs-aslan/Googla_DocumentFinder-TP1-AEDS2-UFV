This heart is empty  
Ive barely hidden memories  
Ive found a picture that haunts me again  
  
Ive no sad expression  
Ive no tears in my eyes  
But I am the clown who forgot how to laugh  
  
I wonder does she think of me  
I wonder I wonder  
I wonder does she call my name  
I cried  
Dont leave me here alone  
I cried  
Dont leave me dont leave me  
  
Love is like clock law  
Tick tock my heartbeat  
I was a passion that passed her spare time  
  
This room is prison  
Love doesnt come here  
These quiet nights will slowly kill me  
  
I wonder does she think of me  
I wonder I wonder  
I wonder does she call my name  
I cried  
Dont leave me here alone  
I cried  
Dont leave me here alone  
I cried  
Dont leave me dont leave me  
Dont leave me dont leave me  
I cried  
Dont leave me dont leave me here  
Im quite alone
