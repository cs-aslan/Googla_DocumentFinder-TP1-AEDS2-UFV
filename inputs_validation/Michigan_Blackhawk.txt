Flyin down the highway lookin for a place to land  
Need to leave the speed in the city  
And people comin goin theres no time to understand  
And I keep movin down the road taking notes in a trembling hand  
  
Asked Sally to go with me but she made it very clear  
She said Youve got your problems and I have mine tonight  
  
Up to the sunlit mountains down by the silver sea  
Well the tale is told from memory of a finely woven symphony  
Forever heard without a word to disturb its melody  
Still Id like to have someone along to share the air with me  
  
Oh Sally why not come with me you know Id like be with you  
You cant be all that busy you dont have that much to do  
And you know Id like to be with you
