I am the modren man  
With this guitar in hand  
Ill do my best and try  
To keep rock and roll alive  
Keep it alive  
Keep it alive  
Keep it alive  
  
Dont let it end  
Dont let it end  
Dont let it end  
Dont let it end  
  
Im gonna keep on rockin all through the night  
Shake it shake it baby cause it feels so right  
Motivate your body gonna cure your soul  
Keep on rockin til I lose control  
  
Dont let it end  
I shake to soul music  
Dont let it end  
I gotta gotta have that music  
Dont let it end  
Chuck Berry  
Dont let it end  
The Platters  
Dont let it end  
Little Richard  ahoo  
Dont let it end
