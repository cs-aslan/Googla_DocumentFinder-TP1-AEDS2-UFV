Well dont you want to climb a mountain  
Yeah dont you want to ride the river  
Drink from a magic fountain  
Give your woman all the love that you can give her  
Well dont you want to be an outlaw  
Dont you want to ride the range  
Dont you want to be an outlaw children  
Just like jesse like jesse james  
  
Well now dont you want to swim the ocean  
Dont you want to climb the highest tree  
Drink some of mommas lovin potion  
Get your woman till she just cant see  
Dont you want to be an outlaw  
Just a poor boy out on the skids  
Dont you want to be an outlaw children  
Just like billy just like billy the kid  
  
Well now billy he was a bad boy he won the wild west  
By the year of 21 as many notches on his gun  
But someone laid him to an early rest

As many notches on his gun as the years of 21  
But someone laid him to an early rest
