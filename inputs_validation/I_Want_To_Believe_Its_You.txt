So many years Ive been waiting alone  
So many days in blue  
Thinking that life maybe passed me by  
Then suddenly I found you  
And now all of my life seems to change overnight  
And I dont know what to do  
You say you want to be mine  
That its love this time  
I want to believe its true  
I want to believe its you  
  
Its never easy for me in love  
I never can find what I need  
I need a lover thats lost but hasnt lost touch  
Someone whos lost like me  
And then I come on too strong and I play it all wrong  
I dont know why I do  
But something tells me tonight  
That this might be right  
I want to believe its true  
I want to believe its you  
  
OhI want to believe its true  
OhI want to believe its you  
I keep having this dream that I go through  
A man holds me close but I never see who  
Babe cant you see that  
I want to believe its you  
  
Its easy to hide your heart away  
Its easy to never choose  
Ive loved and Ive lost and Ive lost my way  
And now Im afraid to lose  
But when you say that its right  
That its here tonight  
Im ready to see it too  
Like a prisoners release  
Like a promise of peace  
I want to believe its true  
I want to believe its you
