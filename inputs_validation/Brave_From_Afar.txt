Brave from afar  
When I hold you for country  
Saved by a star  
Can I hold you to one thing  
Do you feel safe when  
They tell you they sell you  
Pray for your children  
The shelter theyre building  
  
Prime time the perfect crime  
Bow my head the axe we grind  
Ruse cruise Ps and Qs  
I got beat up by the evening news  
Deep hits the media blitz  
Lost my mind to keep my wits  
Maintain the same old same  
Goodbye shiz and so long game  
  
Brave from afar  
When I hold you for country  
Saved by a star  
Can I hold you to one thing  
Do you feel safe when  
They tell you they sell you  
Pray for your children  
The shelter theyre building  
  
Plain Jane the big campaign  
Last detail has been restrained  
Fraud fraud the lightening rod  
See that sign time to applaud  
  
Brave from afar  
When I hold you for country  
Saved by a star  
Can I hold you to one thing  
Do you feel safe when  
They tell you they sell you  
Pray for your children  
The shelter theyre building
