I never thought life would be easy  
Take it from me its not easy  
When youre living on your own  
And now I face it and even now I take it  
One day at a time one step at a time  
  
Then I try to rise  
Each time I fall  
Try to find a way  
Of getting through it all  
  
I used to believe in you  
Now I need someone else to turn to  
Any though its only a matter of time  
  
That when you lose the magic  
Suddenly your world comes falling down  
All around you  
And though it seems so tragic  
Even when theres no one else around  
You hear the sound  
Of another world falling down  
  
Leaving your memories behind me  
Hoping that nothing reminds me  
Praying that I can forget  
And even now I take it  
One step at a time and now I  
  
Face the future eye to eye  
I know it wont be easy but Ill get by
