This is just a nightmare  
Soon Im gonna wake up  
Someones gonna bring me round  
  
Running from the bombers  
Hiding in the forest  
Running through the fields  
Laying flat on the ground  
  
Just like everybody  
Stepping over hills  
Running from the underground  
  
This is your warning  
4 minute warning  
  
I dont wanna hear it  
I dont wanna know  
I just wanna run and hide  
  
This is just a nightmare  
But soon Im gonna wake up  
Someones gonna bring me round  
  
This is our warning  
4 minute warning
