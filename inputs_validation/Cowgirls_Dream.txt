I fell head over heels in Tucson  
Til the neon lights shined on his wedding band  
And once a handsome Cherokee  
He nearly swept me off my feet  
And we danced the night away in old Cheyenne  
  
Yeah but something in my heart  
Says Ill know him in the dark  
When at last he comes along  
  
Weeooo weedle edeoh  
I see him ridin through my dreams  
Weewhoo weedle edeoh  
Were ridin double as he sings  
Weewhoo weedle edeoh  
Its a sagebrush moonlight scene  
Weewhoo hes the answer to a cowgirls dream  
  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee eehe  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee eehe  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay eeheeee  
  
Ah deedle lo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee eehe  
Ah deedle lo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee eehe  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay eehe  
  
Weewhoo weedle edeoh  
I see him ridin through my dreams  
Weewhoo weedle edeoh  
Were ridin double as he sings  
Weeeeee ooooooo weedle edeoh  
Its a sagebrush moonlight scene  
Weeooo hes the answer to a cowgirls dreams
