Its too bad things are going so tough with me  
Well its too bad things are going so tough with me  
Well no matter what I do seem like evrything happen to me  
I used to have a car and it was painted white an black  
I used to have a car and it was painted white an black  
Well I couldnt keep up the payments and the man he took it back  
Yeah  
Now I used to smoke cigars  
The very best in town  
But bad luck an trouble  
Is bound to get me down  
Its too bad things are going so tough with me  
Well no matter what I do  
Seem like evrything I do happen to me
