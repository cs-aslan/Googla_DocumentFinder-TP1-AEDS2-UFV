Memories light the corners of my mind  
Misty watercolored memories of the way we were  
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind  
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were  
  
Can it be that it was all so simple then  
Or has time rewritten every line  
If we had the chance to do it all again  
Tell me would we  
Could we  
  
Memories may be beautiful and yet  
Whats too painful to remember  
We simply choose to forget  
So its the laughter we will remember  
Whenever we remember  
The way we were  
The way we were
