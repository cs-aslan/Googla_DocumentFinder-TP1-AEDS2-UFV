Stashed his trash in Ecuador bought a good suit of clothes  
Flew on up to Mexico standin by the shore  
Waiting for some mystery man to pay him for his time  
Thinkin about all the money he made  
couldnt help to ease his mind  
Havana daydreamin oh hes just dreamin his life away  
  
Daddy shucked that sugar cane  
One day he fell dead  
Jesus had a wanderin feelin  
Swimmin around in his head  
Sailin on a midnight boat  
There were no questions asked  
Waters so green and the air was so clean  
That he stuck right to his task Havana daydreamin  
Oh hes just schemin his life away  
  
Ceilin fan stirs the air  
Cigar smoke did swirl  
A fragrance on the pillow case  
And he thinks about the girl  
Spillin wine wine and sharin good times  
She sure could make him smile  
He pays her well but what the hell  
Hell be movin in a little while Havana daydreamin  
Havana daydreamin  
Oh hell be dreamin his life away
