They call her the lady of the night  
Shes a woman of the world  
And easyliving girl with love for sale  
  
Thats what they call her the lady of the night  
No one seems to know her name  
And even less about the place  
From where she came  
  
Every evening when the night is close at hand  
Youll find the lady on the rue davignon  
In a half lit hotel doorway the lady advertises warmly  
Its just a job but shell do the best she can  
  
Dont try to change this lady of the night  
Shes a lot like you and me  
And less than what she seems to be  
  
she is the lady of the night  
And easyliving girl  
she is the lady of the night  
Shes a woman of the world  
she is the lady of the night  
With lots of loving for sale  
she is the lady of the night  
Lady lady of the night  
  
Round here they call her the lady of the night  
In a perfume hotel room  
Shadows dance upon the wall and fate at dawn  
Shes no beginner this lady of the night  
Never try that funny stuff  
cause lady can be tough  
Be warned  
  
she is the lady of the night  
Shes a lot like you and me  
she is the lady of the night  
And never just what she seems  
she is the lady of the night  
No one seems to know her name  
she is the lady of the night  
Or the place from where she came
