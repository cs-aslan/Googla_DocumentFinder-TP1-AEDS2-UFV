A lonely avenue its raining in my heart  
No name no number girl how can I try a start without you  
Im as lonely as a cloud oh when your love falls down  
You make the sun keep shining oh when youre just around  
And whenever will be I promise your love forever my love  
  
Dont let me go little darling  
Oh nonononono little darling  
That Im so in love with you  
Dont let him know little darling  
Oh nonononono little darling  
That Ill never let you go  
Were flying high and flying low  
Oh babe theres one thing you should know  
Ill never ever let you go  
  
And when the sun goes down my world is in your hands  
On silver clouds well fly just to the rainbows end you and I  
Only my shadow knows love is on my side  
Ill fly around the moon only to hold you tight  
And whatever will be I promise your love forever my love
