Ive had all I can take  
Ive taken just too much  
Ive made a big mistake  
That put me out of touch  
I dont think I can face  
Another single day  
Without a call from you  
To take this pain away  
  
So many tears ago  
You turned and walked away  
It couldve been the end  
But I knew better  
I had to tell myself  
Therell be another day  
She wants to call it quits  
But dont you let her  
  
Cant you see  
Theres a chance for you and me  
Think it over  
Dont believe  
In the things that may not be  
Think it over  
  
Why dont you think it over  
Forgetting you is out  
I aint givin in  
The fuss was down to you  
But its not over  
You have to face the truth  
Im still in love with you  
I have to make you see  
That its not over  
  
Why dont you think about it babe
