Though some things in life are hard to bear  
Dont let it bring you down  
  
Should the sand of time run out on you  
Dont let it bring you down  
  
Dont go down  dont go underground  
Things seem strange but they change  
How they change  
  
Up and down your carousel will go  
Dont let it bring you down  
  
Dont go down  dont get out of town  
Get to know how it goes how it goes  
  
When the price you have to pay is high  
Dont let it bring you down
