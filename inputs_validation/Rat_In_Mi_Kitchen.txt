Chorus  
Theres a rat in me kitchen what am I gonna do  
Theres a rat in me kitchen what am I gonna go  
Im gonna fix that rat thats what Im gonna do  
Im gonna fix that rat  
  
When you open your mouth you dont talk you shout  
And you give every body the blame  
But when they catch you up  
They will shut you up  
And you got no one to blame  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a rat in me kitchen  
  
When you out on the street  
You practice lies and deceit  
And you scandalize my name  
But when I catch you up  
Im gonna pull you up  
Im gonna checkout inside your brain  
  
Chorus  
  
When yo deh pon the scene  
You make everyone scream  
Because they know your so unjust  
But when they catch you up  
They will kick you up  
Because you someone they cannot trust  
  
Chorus  
  
You invade my space  
Make me feel disgraced  
And you just dont give a damn  
If I had my way  
If I had my say  
Id like to see you hang  
  
Chorus
