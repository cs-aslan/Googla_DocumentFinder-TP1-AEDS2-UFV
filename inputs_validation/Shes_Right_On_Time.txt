Turn on all the Christmas lights  
Cause babys coming home tonight  
I can hear her footsteps in the street  
Turn the choral music higher  
Pile more wood upon the fire  
That should make the atmosphere complete  
Ive had to wait forever  
But better late than never  
Shes just in time for me  
Shes right on time  
Shes right where she should be  
Shes right on time  
Im a man with so much tension  
Far too many sins to mention  
She dont have to take it anymore  
But since she said shes coming home  
Ive torn out all my telephones  
Soon she will be walking through that door  
I may be going nowhere  
But I dont mind if shes there  
Shes just in time for me  
Shes right on time  
Shes right where she should be  
Shes right on time  
Left to my own device  
I can always make believe  
That theres nothing wrong  
Still I will chose to live  
In the complicated world  
That we shared for so long  
Good or bad  
Right or wrong  
And it occurred to me  
While I set up my Christmas tree  
She never missed a cue  
Or lost a beat  
Everytime I lost the meter  
There she was when I would need her  
Greeting me with footsteps in the street  
I guess I should have known it  
Shed find the perfect moment  
Shes just in time for me  
Shes right on time  
Shes right where she should be  
Shes right on time  
Turn the choral music higher  
Pile more wood upon the fire  
That will make the atmosphere complete  
Ive had to wait forever  
But better late than never  
Shes just in time for me  
Shes right on time  
Shes right where she should be  
Shes right on time  
Shes right on time  
Shes right on time
