We have no way to see eye to eye  
Through all the walls in their mind  
These are the pleasures that terrify  
So leave them behind  
You keep the chains that are in your life  
Well take flight of the dove  
Theres only one way to satisfy  
This feeling thats love  
And Ill say it again and Ill say it again  
And if the power comes between us  
Oh Ill know what to do  
Im gonna say it to you  
Cross the line tonight  
Take this chance and show your might  
All the worlds on the other side  
Cross the line  
Raise a flag to a moral crime  
Well light a fire for this  
Make the papers by morning time  
And lay in our bliss  
So come on darling and share my mind  
There is no need to stay hid  
cause all we are now is two of a kind  
Can you believe what we did  
And Ill say it again oh and Ill say it again  
That when the power comes between us  
Oh Ill know what to do  
Im gonna say it to you  
Cross the line tonight  
Take this chance and show your might  
All worlds on the other side  
Cross the line  
Mother come to me now  
Take this hand now Im afraid  
Mother come to me  
Im bleeding  
We had no way to see eye to eye  
Through all the walls in their mind  
These were the pleasures that terrified  
We left them behind  
And Ill say it again and Ill say it again  
And if the power comes between us  
Oh Ill know what to do  
Im gonna say it to you  
Cross the line tonight  
Take this chance and show your might  
All the worlds on the other side  
Cross the line
