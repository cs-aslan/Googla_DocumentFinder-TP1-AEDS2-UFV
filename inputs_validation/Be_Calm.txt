As I walk through the streets of my new city  
My back feeling much better I suppose  
Ive reclaimed the use of my imagination  
For better or for worse Ive yet to know  
But I always knew youd be the one to understand me  
I guess thats why it took so long to get things right  
Suddenly Im lost  
On my street  
On my block  
  
Oh why Oh why  
Oh why havent you been there for me  
Cant you see Im losing my mind this time  
This time I think its for real I can see  
  
All the tree tops turning red  
The beggars near bodegas grin at me  
I think they want something  
I close my eyes I tell myself to breathe  
  
And be calm  
Be calm  
I know you feel like you are breaking down  
Oh I know that it gets so hard sometimes  
Be calm  
  
Im scared that everyone is out to get me  
These days before you speak to me you pause  
I always see you looking out your window  
After all you lost your band you left your mom  
Now every single crack every penny that I pass  
Says I should either leave or pick it up  
But with every single buck Ive made  
Im saddled with bad luck that came  
  
The moment I was baptized  
Or when I found out one day Im gonna die  
If only I could find my people or my place in life  
A when they come acarolin  
So loud so bright the theremin  
Will lead us to a chorus  
Where well all rejoice and sing a song that goes  
  
Oh be calm  
Be calm  
I know you feel like you are breaking down  
I know that it gets so hard sometimes  
Be calm  
Take it from me Ive been there a thousand times  
You hate your pulse because it thinks youre still alive  
And everythings wrong  
It just gets so hard sometimes  
Be calm  
  
I dont remember much that night  
Just walking thinking fondly of you  
Thinking how the worst is yet to come  
When from that street corner came a song  
And I cant remember the man  
The panhandler or his melody  
The words exchanged had far exceeded any change Id given thee  
  
Oh be calm  
Be calm  
I know you feel like you are breaking down  
Oh I know that it gets so hard sometimes  
Be calm  
Take it from me Ive been there a thousand times  
You hate your pulse because it still thinks youre alive  
And everythings wrong  
It just gets so hard sometimes  
Be calm  
Be calm
