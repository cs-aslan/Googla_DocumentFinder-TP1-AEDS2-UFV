In a flat FortyOne with my strat on the door  
We was goin to the country for what we came for  
Im sure youve smelled the trees in the air  
The best of motor cruisins just the joy to get there  
  
I was approachin Simonton down by the cotton gin  
There was old man Berkman trying to flag me in  
He asked if I would stay awhile and if I needed gas  
I said No thanks anyhow I dont drive too fast  
  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
Ride my Chevrolet  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
Ride my Chevrolet  
  
I took the road down to Cinco  
Through that red Brazos River land  
Done hit that freeway at sunset  
Now the big city lights are at hand  
  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
Ride my Chevrolet  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
Ride my Chevrolet
