I found a reason to keep livin  
Oh and the reason dear is you  
I found a reason to keep singin  
Wowwoh and the reason dear is you  
  
Oh I do believe  
if you dont like things you leave  
For someplace youve never  
gone before

Honey I found a reason to keep livin  
And you know the reason dear its you  
And Ive walked down lifes lonely highways  
hand in hand with myself  
And I realize  
how many paths have crossed between us  
  
Oh I do believe  
you are what you perceive  
What comes is better than what  
came before  
  
Oh I do believe

What comes is better than what
