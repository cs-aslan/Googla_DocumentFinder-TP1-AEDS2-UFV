What a problem you know hes fit to be tied  
He tried to solve it that was his only crime  
Well I aint got no inhibitions  
And my daddy gets left alright  
The time for him to make the decision  
If this is still the place Im gonna spend the night  
He says get out your no son of mine  
What a problem you know hes fit to be tied  
You dont understand he thinks hes always right  
He says your lust is the toy of confliction  
And you think you got fun all the time  
In school you aint got no direction  
He thinks Im just a kid that aint got no mind  
I say no way are you gonna run my life  
What a problem you know hes fit to be tied  
On my way he pushed me over the line  
What a problem Im only one of a kind  
He says get out your no son of mine  
I say no way are you gonna run my life  
Packed my bags wont even say goodbye  
Ill show you a thing or two you know Ive got my pride  
What a problem you know hes fit to be tied
