You want commitment and take a look into these eyes  
They burn with fire Yeah until the end of time  
And I would do anything Id beg Id steal  
Id die to have you in theses arms tonight  
  
Baby I want you like the roses want the rain  
You know I need you like a poet needs the pain  
And I would give anything My blood my love my life  
If you were in these arms tonight  
  
Id hold you Id need you  
Id get down on my knees for you  
And make everything alright  
If you were in these arms  
Id love you Id please you  
Id tell you that Id never leave you  
And love you till the end of time  
if you were in these arms tonight  
Oh yeah  
  
We stare at the sun and we made a promise  
A promise this world would never blind us  
And these were our words  
Our words were our songs  
Our songs are our prayers  
These prayers keep me strong and I still believe  
If you were in these arms  
  
Id hold you Id need you  
Id get down on my knees for you  
And make everything alright  
If you were in these arms  
Id love you Id please you  
Id tell you that Id never leave you  
And love you till the end of time  
if you were in these arms tonight  
  
Your clothes are still scattered all over our room  
This whole place still smells like your cheap perfume  
Everything here reminds me of you  
Theres nothing I wouldnt do  
And these were our words they keep me strong baby  
  
Id hold you Id need you  
Id get down on my knees for you  
And make everything alright  
If you were in these arms  
Id love you Id please you  
Id tell you that Id never leave you  
And love you till the end of time  
if you were in these arms tonight  
  
If you were in these arms  
Baby like the roses need the rain  
Like the seasons need to change  
Like the seasons need to change
