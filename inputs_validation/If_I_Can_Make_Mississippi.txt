If I can make Mississippi  
Then Ill be alright  
These ol white lines are lonely  
On this twolane tonight  
Ive got just enough whiskey  
To keep me warm till the mornin light  
If I can make Mississippi  
Mississippi tonight  
I headed out west  
To seek my fortune and fame  
I sure made a mess  
It took it all but my name  
Why I ever left  
I can never explain  
If I can make Mississippi  
Through this pouring rain  
If I can make Mississippi  
Then Ill be alright  
These ol white lines are lonely  
And the headlights are bright  
Ive got just enough whiskey  
To keep me warm till the mornin light  
If I could make Mississippi  
Mississippi tonight  
She said she would wait  
She said our love was strong  
Well Im just so afraid  
Ive been gone for too long  
When I walk through that gate  
Will she be there or long long gone  
If I can make Mississippi  
If I can make it back home  
If I can make Mississippi  
If I can make it back home
