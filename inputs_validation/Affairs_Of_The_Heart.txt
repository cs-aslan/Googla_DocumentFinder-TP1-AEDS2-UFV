One set of doors was the color of honey  
One set of doors was pink and grey  
Well I wonder which set is mine said she  
As she walked down the long hallway  
  
Well I wonder which set of rooms are mine  
For in these rooms she would live and die  
  
Well its better to have loved and lost  
Ah but its better not to lose  
Than to never have loved at all  
Never have loved never have loved at all  
Well its better to have loved and lost  
Ah but its better not to lose  
Than to always be alone  
Always be alone  
In your heart  
  
I thought that there was more involved  
Through all that time and all these  
months  
I stopped many times to question you  
Well I told you that it was the right  
thing to do  
  
Well its better to have loved and lost  
Ah but its better not to lose  
Than to never have loved at all  
Never have loved never have loved at all  
Yes its better to have loved and lost  
Ah but its better not to lose  
Than to always be alone  
Always be alone  
In your heart  
  
But I knew that this was just for now  
And the time would take its toll upon  
us all  
Well it would break our hearts  
Tear it apart  
But no one understood  
The affairs of the heart  
  
Well its better to have loved and lost  
Than to never have loved at all  
Never have loved never have loved at all  
Well itll break your heart tear it apart  
But no one understands  
No one understands  
The affairs of the heart
