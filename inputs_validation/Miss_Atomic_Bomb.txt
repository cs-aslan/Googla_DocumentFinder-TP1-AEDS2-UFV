You were standing with your girlfriends in the street  
Falling back on forever I wonder what you came to be  
I was new in town the boy with the eager eyes  
I never was a quitter oblivious to schoolgirls lies  
  
When I look back on those neon lights  
The leather seats the passage rite  
I feel the heat I see the light  
  
Miss Atomic Bomb  
Making out weve got the radio on  
Youre gonna miss me when Im gone  
Youre gonna miss me when Im gone  
  
Racing shadows under moonlight  
Through the desert on a hot night  
And for a second there wed won  
Yeah we were innocent and young  
  
Cast out of the night well youve got a foolish heart  
So you took your place but the fall from grace was the hardest part  
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back  
You run for cover but you cant escape the second attack  
Your soul was innocent she kissed him and she painted it black  
You should have seen your little face burnin for love  
Holdin on for your life  
  
All that I wanted was a little touch  
A little tenderness and truth I didnt ask for much no  
Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time  
  
Miss Atomic Bomb  
Making out weve got the radio on  
Youre gonna miss me when Im gone  
Youre gonna miss me when Im gone  
  
Racing shadows under moonlight  
Were taking chances on a hot night  
And for a second there wed won  
Yeah we were innocent and young  
  
The dust cloud has settled and my eyes are clear  
But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear  
Miss Atomic Bomb Im standing here  
Sweat on my skin  
And this love that Ive cradled  
Is wearing thin Miss Atomic Bomb  
But Im standing here and you re too late  
Your shockwave whisper has sealed your fate  
  
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back Its so cruel  
You run for cover but you cant escape the second attack and you turn your
back youre so  
Your soul was innocent she kissed him and she painted it black on a losing
game  
You should have seen your little face burning for love  
Miss Atomic Bomb  
  
Holdin on for your life  
But you cant survive All that I wanted was a little touch  
When you want it all A little tenderness and truth I didnt ask for much  
Theres another side Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time
