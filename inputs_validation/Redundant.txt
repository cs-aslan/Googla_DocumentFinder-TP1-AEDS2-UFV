Were living in repetition  
Content in the same old shtick again  
Now the routines turning to contention  
Like a production line going over and over and over  
Roller coaster  
Now I cannot speak I lost my voice  
Im speechless and redundant  
Cause I love yous not enough  
Im lost for words  
Choreographed and lack of passion  
Prototypes of what we were  
Went full circle til Im nauseous  
Taken for granted now  
Now I waste it faked it ate it now I hate it  
Now I cannot speak I lost my voice  
Im speechless and redundant  
Cause I love yous not enough  
Im lost for words now I cannot speak
