That long thin dawn that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Ive seen the hills of Frisco and the streets of Montreal  
In every town Ive been to Ive had someone to call  
From Winnipeg to Edmonton Vancouver to St Paul  
Ive had so many good friends I couldnt miss them all  
In that long thin dawn that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Last night I came to Denver beneath the snowcapped ridge  
I thought about my darling as I stood beneath the bridge  
And there were times I made her cry but I guess by now shes learned  
That any time Ive wandered I always have returned  
In that long thin dawn that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Right now Im on a highway just east of Omaha  
Riding shotgun on the biggest rig you ever saw  
With forty tons of pig iron and a trucker known as Bill  
All the way to Windsor weve got some miles to kill  
In that long thin dawn that long thin dawn is coming on again  
While climbing up a hillside Bill drops her down a gear  
And the engine sings so sweetly tis music to my ear  
I tell him how I long to be just like him if I can  
Driving like the restless wind across this precious land  
In that long thin dawn that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Says Bill The air is clean tonight as he puffs a big cigar  
And if this rig keeps rolling my boy youll travel far  
But when you are a trucker youll come to realize  
The only thing a man can do is watch the world go by  
In that long thin dawn that long thin dawn is coming on again  
That long thin dawn that long thin dawn is coming on again
