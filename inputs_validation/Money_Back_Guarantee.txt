Shes on the left Im on the right  
Oh here comes trouble and I  
Aint even seen her yet  
Oh shes something Ill regret  
Shes got it good I got it bad  
Cant seem to get her walk  
And her talk outta my head  
Oh you know Im just a mess  
  
Chorus  
Give it up give it up  
Give it to me  
Cant you see honey

Wanna feel your touch  
I need you so much  
Dont you know I come with  
A money back guarantee  
Oh you aint gonna get my money  
  
Ill buy the house you drive my car  
Ill take you anywhere  
Oh you can call my bluff  
I will shower you with  
Diamonds and rings  
Ill feel a little angel baby  
Cant you see  
  
Wanna feel your touch  
I need you so much  
Dont you know I come with  
A money back guarantee  
Oh you can have it all baby  
Here it comes here it comes
