Zaytoven on the track  
Zaytiggy  
Gucci  
Gucci  
  
So Watch Entertainment  
Lets Go  
  
Chorus  
They call me ChefBoyRG  
But hold that thought  
Its a Kodak Moment  
But hold that thought  
Hurricane wrist game  
Turn that junk off  
Hot as piggly wiggly  
Cant Kermit the frog dog  
  
Early in the morning  
I aint even yawning  
  
Cooking up a cake  
Like Im doing a performance  
When it come to flossing  
I aint even talking  
Diamonds on my joint  
Got my Chevy moon walking  
10 bricks on my Bart Simpson just look  
My watch 35 pounds of kush  
My ring 36 ozs my nig  
My bracelet 500 lbs of mid  
A Gucci wrapped tour bus  
Yall hoes follow us  
Party pack pills man  
Hoes gonna swallow us  
Naturally a loner  
But love my kid  
Mix the soda with the cola  
I can buy me a friend  
New swag something like  
Trap House times 10  
Every nigga round me  
Bust heads YADig  
Iced out grill  
I cant buy that bullshit  
Im wit some street shit  
Like a reverend in the pulpit  
  
Chorus  
  
Like ya boy Rip Ham  
I got a real good jay a real good jay  
1 gram for the 80  
Thats some real good play  
Got them Vince Carter quarters  
Add soda and water  
Im not athletic  
But Ima straight balla  
The Spud Webb ticket  
With the lamburg yay  
And its jumping from the free throw  
Like MJ  
Sees nothing pass by  
Like Steve and Pass  
Say boy you lightning fast  
On the Utah Jazz  
Like Dr J shorts  
My work real tight  
You got that Atlanta Hawks yay  
It wont get right  
Catch me on the rebound  
Like Bo Outlaw  
Ima Mikey Vickit whip it  
Cook it southpaw  
36 hoeszos  
Trying to make the end zone  
Make no hard move  
And use my cell phone  
Worth scrabbling in the pot  
Just like Steve Young  
5 for the Keyshawn  
7 for the Dion  
  
Chorus  
  
Gucci on fire  
Like mojo crack pot  
Fell ova a joint  
Like back like crack rock  
Money stupid dumb  
Just like Cold Blood  
Just Young Hot  
I show no love  
Money getter like Cheeba  
Minds like Fat  
And my trap roll hard  
Just like Shorty Black  
Ima country ass nigga  
Just like Ace  
Gotta fetish for the stones  
Just like Four Trey  
Money tall like Broah  
Yours like D  
And my patience very short  
Just like Courtney C  
Angie B Russell P  
But its your choice  
My girl Angel pussy deep  
Like Slick Man voice  
Like Red 03  
Man I got bread  
My pocket on swole  
Like HP forehead  
Ima money go getter  
So I contest  
Gotta a hundred hoes jockin  
Just like Throw Back  
  
Chorus
