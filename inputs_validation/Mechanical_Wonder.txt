The mechanical wonder is  
Its just a noise in my room  
And Im chasing the wonder and  
Its just a hole in my tune  
  
And the radio plays but it  
But it dont sing a song  
And the mechanical thunder is  
What is all going wrong  
  
And I walk down the road and I  
I awake in a tune  
But the mechanical thunder is  
Its just a noise in my room  
  
And we rode it once  
On a thundering night  
So I walk with you  
Where the locks take flight  
  
All machines make our lives today  
And I like them the best  
But the mechanical thunder is  
Its just a noise in my head  
  
And the radio plays at me  
But it dont sing a song  
But the mechanical wonder is  
Ah its all going wrong  
  
And they rode it once and we rode it once on last chorus  
On a thundering night  
So I walk with you  
Where the locks take flight  
And we keep on through  
Its where the road dont roar  
Where the farm once stood  
Where the union crawls big time  
  
The machines that Im walking from  
Though they play in the songs  
And the dreams that your holding on  
Dont run for so long  
  
So Im hiding machines away  
But I keep them for you  
But the things that you want to say  
Its just a noise in my room  
  
And I look at the picture now  
And theres a weight on us all  
But the mechanical wonder is  
Its a cure one and all
