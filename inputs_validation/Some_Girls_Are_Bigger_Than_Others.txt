From the iceage to the doleage  
There is but one concern  
I have just discovered   
  
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girls mothers are bigger than  
Other girls mothers  
  
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girls mothers are bigger than  
Other girls mothers  
  
As Anthony said to Cleopatra  
As he opened a crate of ale   
  
Oh I say   
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girls mothers are bigger than  
Other girls mothers  
  
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girls mothers are bigger than  
Other girls mothers  
  
Send me the pillow  
The one that you dream on  
Send me the pillow  
The one that you dream on  
And Ill send you mine
