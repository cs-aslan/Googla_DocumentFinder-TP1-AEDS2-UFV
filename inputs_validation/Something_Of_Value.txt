All that I need to hear from you  
something of value but something untrue  
All that I wished that Id find within you  
  
See how what she wanted and she needed  
Tore it all down in the end  
Some how like a sickness she infects me  
Shes simple but deadly my friend  
  
All that I needed to hear from you  
Something of value but something untrue  
All that I wished that Id find within you  
Stings when I see all the ways that you  
  
Took me for granted and told me its through  
Picked from my pockets and smiled  
Empty is nothing and nothing is you  
Think Ill just sit for a while  
  
See how what I wanted and I needed  
It wasnt enough in the end  
somehow with a quickness I forgot her  
I realized she wasnt my friend
