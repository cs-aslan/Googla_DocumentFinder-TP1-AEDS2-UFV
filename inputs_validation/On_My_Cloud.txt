Love is moving faster but Im taking my time  
Im gonna be there when I get there  
You just follow the signs  
Im making something out of nothing  
And if you want a ride  
Get your self together  
And well leave the world behind  
  
Get up get on my cloud  
Lift your feet right off the ground  
Nothing gonna stand in our way Oh  
Get up get on my cloud  
Im not gonna let you down  
Lets make it happen today  
  
Ill be busy doing nothing  
And its starting to show  
But lets turn nothing into something  
I cant do it alone  
So if you wanna make it happen  
And you got time to do  
Get your self together  
And well leave it all behind  
  
Get up get on my cloud  
Lift your feet right off the ground  
Nothing gonna stand in our way Oh  
Get up get on my cloud  
Im not gonna let you down  
Lets make it happen today  
  
Can we just float away  
Ive got a plan to make you stay  
I know you feel the same  
Get your self together  
Leave the world behind  
  
Get up get on my cloud  
Lift your feet right off the ground  
Nothing gonna stand in our way Oh  
Get up get on my cloud  
Im not gonna let you down  
Lets make it happen today  
  
Get up get on my cloud  
Get up get on my cloud  
Get up get on my cloud Yeah  
Get up get on my cloud  
Get up get on my cloud  
Lets make it happen today
