Were rolling everybody  
It starts with bass  
  
EIOIEIA  
When you give your love away  
You get a feeling for  
EIOIEIA  
Live to love another day  
Even when you feel unsure  
More and more I wanna raise  
Raise my bar and raise your stay  
EIOIEIA  
When I lie theyre wide awake  
For my son I make  
  
Tell my boy I love him so  
Tell him so he know  
Lost in Ethiopia  
Walk out in that road  
  
EIOIEIA  
Something good gon come your way  
Just look out your door  
EIOIEIA  
Tell him what you wanna say  
No matter whatcha mad at girl  
  
Tell my boy I love him so  
Tell him so he know  
Lost in Ethiopia  
Walk out in that road  
  
EIOIEIA  
Steal my heart to give away  
Make me wanna say  
EIOIEIA  
You and I are so no same  
More and more and more each day  
  
Tell my boy I love him so  
Tell him so he know  
Lost in Ethiopia  
Walk out in that road
