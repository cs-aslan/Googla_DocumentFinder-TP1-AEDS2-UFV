Sparkling trees of silver foam cast shadows in winter home  
Swaying branches breaking sound lonely forest trembling ground  
Masquerading leaves of blue run circles round the morning dew  
Patterns understood by you reaching out beyond and before  
  
Time like gold dust brings mind down to hidden levels underground  
Say a few words to the wind thats all thats left of winters friend  
  
Reaching the snow in the days of the cold casting a spell out of ice  
Now that youre gone  
The summers too long and it seems like the end of my life  
Beyond and before  
Time like gold dust brings mind down
