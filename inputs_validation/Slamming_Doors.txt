You closed every door right in my face  
You chose to ignore my presence in this place  
You thought Id never make it without you  
And now youre watching me from your living room  
  
You left me on the outside looking in  
You saw me as a risk not worth takin  
You slammed the door before you could realize  
Behind this average girl theres a fire inside  
  
Hear me I bet you hear me now  
See me youre seein clearer now arent you  
Treat me a little better now  
Now that Im here whos lookin down on who now  
  
You led me to think I was a fool  
The only words from you were stupid little girl  
You tried your best to kill my hopes and my dreams  
Too bad you couldnt see the strength inside me  
  
You pushed and pushed me out thinking youd win  
Feeding me lies about a world Id never fit in  
Why would I ever wanna just fit in  
I know Im better than that  
Im something worth remembering  
  
Hear me I bet you hear me now  
See me youre seein clearer now arent you  
Treat me a little better now  
Now that Im here whos lookin down on who now  
  
Hear me creepin through your stereo  
See me not bad for a small town girl  
You cant escape me Im all around  
Everywhere you turn my voice my face my sound  
  
Hear me I bet you hear me now  
See me youre seein clearer now  
Treat me a little better now  
Now that Im here whos lookin  
  
Hear me  
See me youre seein clearer now  
Treat me a little a little better now  
Now that Im here whos lookin down on who now  
  
Hear me  
See me  
Treat me youre treatin me better now  
Now that Im here whos lookin down on who now
