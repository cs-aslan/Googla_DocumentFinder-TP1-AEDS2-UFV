The hardest thing in the world  
  
Holland it dont please  
I never wanted to leave  
Searching for a perfect day  
It never happens that way  
Ahey hey hey  
  
Im sick and tired  
Its so obscene  
Will heaven help me be clean  
Searching for a perfect day  
It never happens that way  
Ahey hey hey  
  
Cut away I know no one wants you around  
  
You never heard a word I said  
Its seems simple to me  
That if you knew you wouldnt say  
It never happens that way  
Ahey hey hey  
  
And the impression I get  
As the story unfurls  
Is that youre the hardest thing in the world  
  
Cut away I know no one wants you around  
  
What you feel might not be  
It seems softer to me  
I cannot climb to touch your spire  
Im getting higher and higher  
  
Cut away I know no one wants you around  
The hardest thing in the world
