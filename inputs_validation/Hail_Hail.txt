Ah is there room for both of us Both of us apart  
Are we bound out of obligation Is that all weve got  
I get the words and then I get to thinkin  
But I dont want to think I want to feel  
How do I feel And how do I  
If youre the only one well Ill never be enough yeah  
Hail hail the lucky ones I refer to those in love yeah  
A how I love you till the day I dieah and beyond  
Are we going to the same place If so can I come  
Its egg rollin thick and heavyall the past we carry  
Oh I could be newyou underestimate me  
If youre the only one well Ill never be enough yeah  
Hail hail the lucky ones I refer to those in love yeah  
I sometimes realizeI could only be as good as youll let me  
Are you woman enough to be my man Bandaged hand in hand  
Yeah  
I find it on my run in a race that cant be won yeah  
All hail the lucky ones I refer to those in love yeah  
If youre my only oneso good you only one  
I want to be your oneenough you wonyour oneyour hun
