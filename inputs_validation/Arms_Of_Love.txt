Maybe tonight youre achin  
For someone youre dreamin of  
Tomorrow youll be wakin  
Into the Arms into the arms of Love  
Maybe tonight youre cryin  
Like a poor wounded dove  
Tell me youll soon be flying  
Into the Arms into the arms of love  
Maybe tonight youre takin  
You couldnt get enough  
Honey youll soon be wakin  
Into the Arms into the arms of Love  
Maybe the world is falling  
It wasnt strong enough  
Tell me youll soon be crawling  
Into the Arms into the arms of Love  
repeat to end
