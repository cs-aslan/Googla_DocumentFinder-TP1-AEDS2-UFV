Was he a saint  
Was he a worm  
Shes telling lies  
Thats what I heard  
Nbcs pissed  
Hes bringing them down  
His cannibal kiss  
Is all over town  
In his room at night  
Marv bites Marv bites  
Marv Albert in the night  
He bites  
If youre just friends  
Marvin will strip  
Grab your rear end  
Bite through your slip  
Up in his room  
Wont get to sleep  
Hes after a thrill  
Here come the sheep  
In your bed at night  
Marv bites Marv bites  
Be afraid tonight  
Marv bites you invites you to feast on his pipe  
Then he wines you then dines on you with his pearly whites  
Marv bites  
So cover your back  
Cause hes got the nerve  
Dont go upstairs  
Or youre the hors doevures  
In the dead of night  
Marv bites he bites  
Speak into his mike  
Or Marv bites  
 And it hurts
