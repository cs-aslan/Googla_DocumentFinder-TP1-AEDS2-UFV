Well I know its kind of late  
I hope I didnt wake you  
But what I got to say cant wait  
I know youd understand  
Every time I tried to tell you  
The words just came out wrong  
So Ill have to say I love you in a song  
  
Yeah I know its kind of strange  
But every time Im near you  
I just run out of things to say  
I know youd understand  
Every time I tried to tell you  
The words just came out wrong  
So Ill have to say I love you in a song  
  
Every time the time was right  
All the words just came out wrong  
So Ill have to say I love you in a song  
  
Yeah I know its kind of late  
I hope I didnt wake you  
But theres something that I just got to say  
I know youd understand  
Every time I tried to tell you  
The words just came out wrong  
So Ill have to say I love you in a song
