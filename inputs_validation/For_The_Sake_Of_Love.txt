I forgive I forgive  
I forgive all my friends who left me alone I forgive the wall that it had so
many stones  
I forgive the lord that he never sent a priest I forgive the hangman I
forgive the beast  
I forgive the winter that it was so cold I forgive my father that he was so
bold  
I forgive the ashes that they couldnt stay flames I forgive the acid I
forgive the rains  
I forgive James Joyce that I couldnt read his books  
I forgive that youve never given back what you took  
  
I forgive the puzzle that I didnt fit I forgive the shit that I couldnt
write a hit  
I forgive the dog that she never came home I forgive all the ways that they
always lead to rome  
I forgive the worm in the very last tree I forgive the girls who havent
forgiven me  
I forgive inspiration when it came to late I forgive all the ladies when I
had to wait  
I forgive superman that I didnt stay clean I forgive I forgive anyone
anything  
For the sake of love for the sake of love  
For the sake of love  
  
I forgive the angels who could never take me high  
I forgive all my dreams that I couldnt really fly  
I forgive the thought that I couldnt stop thinking  
I forgive all the drinks that I couldnt stop drinking  
  
I forgive the clock that it didnt wake me up I forgive the driver I forgive
the cab  
I forgive all the moments that they wouldnt stay I forgive all the years
that theyve flown away  
I forgive the promises that theyve been broken I forgive the curses that
they have been spoken  
I forgive all the prophets and the saints of the past I forgive the stars
when they fell too fast  
I forgive the joke that it didnt make me laugh I forgive desire that I had
to starve  
I forgive all the love for the sake of love I forgive all sakes for the fake
above  
For the sake of love for the sake of love  
For the sake of love
