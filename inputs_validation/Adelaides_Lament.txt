From Guys And Dolls  
  
The average unmarried female  
Basiclly insecure  
Due to some long frustration  
May react  
With psychosomatic symptoms  
Difficult to endure  
Affecting the upper respiratory tract  
In other words  
Just from waiting around  
For that little band of gold  
A person can develop a cold  
You can spray her wherever you figure  
The streptococci lurk  
You can give her a shot  
For whatever shes got  
But it just wont work  
If shes tired of getting the fisheye  
From the hotel clerk  
A person  
Can develop a cold  
The female remaining single  
Just in the legal sense  
Shows a neurotic tendency  
See note  
Note Chronic organic syndromes  
Toxic and hypertense  
Involving the eye  
The ear and the nose and throat  
In other words  
Just from worrying  
Whether the wedding is on or off  
A person  
Can develop a cough  
You can feed her all day  
With the Vitamin A  
And the Bromo Fizz  
But the medicine never  
Gets anywhere near  
Where the trouble is  
If shes getting a kind  
Of name for herself  
And the name aint his  
A person  
Can develop a cough  
And further more  
Just from stalling  
And stalling and stalling  
The wedding trip  
A person  
Can develop La grippe  
When they get on a train  
For Niagra  
And she can hear church bells chime  
The compartment is air conditioned  
And the mood sublime  
Then they get off at Saratoga  
For the fourteenth time  
A person  
Can develop La grippe  
La grippe La post nasal drip  
With the wheezes  
And the sneezes  
And a sinus thats really a pip  
For a lack of community property  
And a feeling shes getting too old  
A person  
Can develop  
A bad bad cold
