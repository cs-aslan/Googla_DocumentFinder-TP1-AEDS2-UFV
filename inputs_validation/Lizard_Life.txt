I got the attitude  
And thats all I ever say  
Dont have to tell nobody  
How their tail ought to lay  
  
Had a sudden revelation  
The heights that Ive sunken down to  
And I dont mind I cant find  
My way out of this witchs brew  
  
Livin for the lizard life  
Livin for the lizard life  
I stumbled on the way around  
My own reality  
  
Gettin righttightly wound  
Past the pale of normality  
I like big loungin every day  
On the iguana side of town  
  
The lizard love it mighty deep  
Talkin way underground  
  
Livin for the lizard life  
Livin for the lizard life  
Livin for the lizard life  
Livin for the lizard life  
  
I be a reptile all day  
And its so fine  
Aint no other way  
Like a life minus mind  
  
I prefer reclinin  
Beatin that conga drum  
And waitin for a threepoint landin  
On my sticky tongue  
  
Livin for the lizard life  
Livin for the lizard life  
Livin for the lizard life  
Im livin with a lizard life
