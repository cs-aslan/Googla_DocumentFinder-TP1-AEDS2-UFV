In this world  I am gonna walk  
Until my feet  refuse to take me any longer  
Yes Im gonna walk  and walk some more  
And I will ask  everyone I meet  
  
Ask til they tell me  theres no answers anymore  
Yes Im gonna ask  more and some more  
And I will love somebody somewhere  
Til my heart breaks  until its done  
  
Until it explodes  from out of nowhere  
Like the sun  like the sun  
In this world  I am gonna sing  
Until my voice  wont be singing any longer  
  
Yes Im gonna sing  more and some more  
And I will love somebody somewhere  
Til my heart breaks  until its done  
Until it explodes  from out of nowhere  
  
Like the sun  like the sun  
I will be looking  at everyone  
Until my eyes  refuse to see them any longer  
And though it hurts me so  gonna keep on looking  
  
Looking looking at me  
And I will love somebody somewhere  
Til my heart breaks  until its done  
Until it explodes  from out of nowhere  
  
Like the sun  like the sun  
In this world  I will love no more  
So love cant hurt me  hurt me any longer
