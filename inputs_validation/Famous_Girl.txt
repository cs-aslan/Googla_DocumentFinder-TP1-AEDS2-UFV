Yea woulda said youre so amazing  
So how could you be so heartless girl  
Live Your Life take TIME  
Day and Night just like Kid Cudi  
Youll think of me you will oh  
Drake would say that youre The Best He Ever Had  
Rumors come and go but you keep your shadow  
Everywhere you go it follows  
Cant understand I still love you  
Watch the thugs talk about this one  
  
Cause I thought I found the right woman  
There were other guys who thought the same thing about her  
Like damn you let me down down down  
Youre famous girl for breaking hearts  
  
Youre famous girl girl girl  
Youre famous girl girl girl

Shoulda known youd break my heart heart heart  
  
Keri wouldve said my love knocks her down  
Keisha wouldve told me I was sent from heaven  
Sorry B I dont wear no Halo  
You were first to play the game though  
Sorry I bust the windows out your car  
I might of cheated in the beginning  
I was wrong for writing Disturbia  
But I meant it in Forever  
We were supposed to be together  
And I cant let you go  
  
Said you thought you find the right man  
There were other girls who thought the same thing about me  
Like damn I let you down down down

Many hearts we shoulda left unbroken  
Empty words are better left unspoken  
Too much pressure I wished I was frozen  
See we lost our way now  
I hope youre happy being famous girl
