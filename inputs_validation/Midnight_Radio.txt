Rain falls hard  
Burns dry  
A dream  
Or a song  
That hits you so hard  
Filling you up  
And suddenly gone  
  
Breath Feel Love  
Give Free  
Know in you soul  
Like your blood knows the way  
From you heart to your brain  
Know that youre whole  
  
And youre shining  
Like the brightest star  
A transmission  
On the midnight radio  
And youre spinning  
Like a 45  
Ballerina  
Dancing to your rock and roll  
  
Heres to Patti  
And Tina  
And Yoko  
Aretha  
And Nona  
And Nico  
And me  
  
And all the strange rock and rollers  
You know youre doing all right  
So hold on to each other  
You gotta hold on tonight  
  
And youre shining  
Like the brightest stars  
A transmission  
On the midnight radio  
  
And youre spinning  
Your new 45s  
All the misfits and the losers  
Yeah you know youre rock and rollers  
Spinning to your rock and roll
