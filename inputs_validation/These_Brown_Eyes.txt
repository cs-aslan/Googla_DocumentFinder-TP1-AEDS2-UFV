These brown eyes of mine  
Theyve been doin some powerful cryin  
Thinkin bout all those years  
That always bring back the tears  
  
Winters come and gone  
And Ive been left alone  
Now Im here home with you Im here home with you  
I do all the things that you do  
  
Then I stop and I look around  
I never know if my feet touch the ground  
But oh baby I know youre right  
  
Seems like a long long time  
Since Ive held you in these arms of mine  
Thinkin bout all those years Thinkin bout all those years  
That always bring back the tears  
  
The winters come and gone  
And Ive been left all alone  
But oh baby I know youre right  
  
And now that youre far away  
I think of your love  
And Im praying that youre still mine  
  
These brown eyes of mine  
Theyve been doin some powerful cryin  
Thinkin bout all those years Thinkin bout all those years  
That always bring back the tears  
  
Then I stop and I look around  
I never know if my feet touch the ground  
But oh baby I know youre right  
Baby I know youre right  
Baby I know youre right
