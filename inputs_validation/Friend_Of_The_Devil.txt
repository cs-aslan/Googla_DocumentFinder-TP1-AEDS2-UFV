I lit up from Reno  
I was trailed by twenty hounds  
Didnt get to sleep that night  
Till the morning came around  
  
I set out running but Ill take my time  
A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine  
If I get home before daylight  
I just might get some sleep tonight  
  
I ran into the Devil babe  
He loaned me twenty bills  
I spent that night in Utah  
In a cave up in the hills  
  
I set out running but I take my time  
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine  
If I get home before daylight  
I just might get some sleep tonight  
  
I ran down to the levee  
But the Devil caught me there  
He took my twenty dollar bill  
And he vanished in the air  
  
I set out running but I take my time  
A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine  
If I get home before daylight  
I just might get some sleep tonight  
  
Got two reasons why I cry  
Away each lonely night  
The first ones named sweet Anne Marie  
And shes my hearts delight  
Second one is prison baby  
The sheriffs on my trail  
And if he catches up with me  
Ill spend my life in jail  
  
Got a wife in Chino babe  
And one in Cherokee  
First one says shes got my child  
But it dont look like me  
  
I set out running but I take my time  
A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine  
If I get home before daylight  
I just might get some sleep tonight  
  
Got two reasons why I cry  
Away each lonely night  
The first ones named sweet Anne Marie  
And shes my hearts delight  
Second one is prison baby  
The sheriffs on my trail  
And if he catches up with me  
Ill spend my life in jail  
  
Got a wife in Chino babe  
The one in Cherokee

But it dont look like me

A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine

I just might get some sleep tonight
