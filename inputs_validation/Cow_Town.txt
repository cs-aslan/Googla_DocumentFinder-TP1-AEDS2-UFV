Cmon along and well go down  
To a place in Texas called Cow Town  
Youll never meet a stranger there  
Everybody knows if youre in town  
  
Theyll meet you with a smile and a  
Howdy how you all and just a little while  
Youll get that Texas drawl  
The hats are wide and the boots are brown  
Youll just love this place called Cow Town  
  
No matter where I may wonder  
No matter where I may roam  
Theres a place way down yonder  
Im goin there and make it my home  
  
Cmon along and well go down  
To a place in Texas called Cow Town  
Youll never meet a stranger there  
Everybody knows if youre in town  
  
Theyll meet you with a smile and a  
Howdy how you all and just a little while  
Youll get that Texas drawl  
The hats are wide and the boots are brown  
Youll just love this place called Cow Town  
  
Youll just love this place called Cow Town
