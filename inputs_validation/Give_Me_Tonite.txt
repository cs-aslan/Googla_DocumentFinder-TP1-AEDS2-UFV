Verse 1 Will Smith  
Uh check check  
Yo yo yo  
Across the room shared a little gaze with me  
Crazy mama how your scent played with me  
Eyes never hiding your heart angelic looking  
Faking disinterest but I can tell youre looking  
Face to face her eye to eye stance with me  
Didnt even say nothing I felt you want to dance with me  
You push me back a little when I kissed your hand  
Said you was attracted to me truly but you had a man  
I put my finger up dont say nothing  
He aint here is he We can play or something  
He at the crib oh I see you live with him  
What you gone get married to him and have some kids with him  
Us could be just a weekend thing  
Just a weekday thing just a thing ma  
Look we can have everything else  
But for tonight let me have you for myself  
Girl holla at me  
  
Chorus TraKnox  
You can have the rest of your life  
Give me tonight  
You can have the rest of your life  
Give me tonight  
You can have the rest of your life  
Just give me tonight  
You can have the rest of your life  
Just give me tonight give me tonight

Verse 3 Will Smith  
Thinking of living your life as a hundred yards long  
Give me a quarterinch thats all Im asking  
Do the math Im the sun you the earth  
Its youNIverse and its the worst  
Cause I thirst to tape connect her  
I know you got a life momma  
Trust me I dont want to bring your life drama  
I can barely hear my think slide with me  
Dip out the side door take a ride with me  
Let me hear about Uh  
What you think about Uh  
What you need to do Uh  
The things you dream about  
Your Body with me but I know where your hearts at  
Let it ring ma call him back  
Wishing I could stop the clock to make it last with you  
Am I goin be at home alone with a glass slipper  
Is it a sin to pretend with another fella  
Midnight the story ends like Cinderella  
  
Chorus x2
