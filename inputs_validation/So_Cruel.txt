We crossed the line  
Who pushed who over  
It doesnt matter to you  
It matters to me  
  
Were cut adrift  
Were still floating  
Im only hanging on  
To watch you go down  
My love  
  
I disappeared in you  
You disappeared from me  
I gave you everything you ever wanted  
It wasnt what you wanted  
  
The men who love you you hate the most  
They pass through you like a ghost  
They look for you but your spirit is in the air  
Baby youre nowhere  
  
Ohlove  
You say in love there are no rules  
Ohlove  
Sweetheart  
Youre so cruel  
  
Desperation is a tender trap  
It gets you every time  
You put your lips to her lips  
To stop the lie  
  
Her skin is pale like Gods only dove  
Screams like an angel for your love  
Then she makes you watch her from above  
And you need her like a drug  
  
Ohlove  
You say in love there are no rules  
Ohlove  
Sweetheart  
Youre so cruel  
  
She wears my love like a seethrough dress  
Her lips say one thing  
Her movements something else  
Oh love like a screaming flower  
Lovedying every hourlove  
  
You dont know if its fear or desire  
Danger the drug that takes you higher  
Head in heaven fingers in the mire  
  
Her heart is racing you cant keep up  
The night is bleeding like a cut  
Between the horses of love and lust  
We are trampled underfoot  
  
Ohlove You say in love there are no rules  
Ohlove  
Sweetheart  
Youre so cruel  
  
Ohlove  
To stay with you Id be a fool  
Sweetheart  
Youre so cruel
