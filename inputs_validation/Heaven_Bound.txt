Darlin theres a thing or two  
I want to take the time to say  
Every moment here with you  
Puts heaven in my day  
  
Im mystified by the smile that blossoms on your face  
And the magic seems to lift me to a cloud where we embrace  
I dont have to dream no more no  
Now I believe in miracles  
Your love turned my world around  
  
Heaven bound  
Heaven bound  
Heaven bound  
Heaven bound  
  
Oh I simply must confess  
Im glad to be a girl  
Youve got to be an angel  
Cause you put heaven in my world  
  
Your shadow is my tropic sun  
And its summer all year long  
Your presence is my paradise  
How could anything go wrong  
  
Now Im absolutely sure  
That youre all Ive been living for yeah  
Your love turned my world around  
  
Heaven bound  
Heaven  
  
Im in Im in heaven  
Im in Im in heaven  
Im in Im in heaven  
  
Every time Im near you my heart just wont keep still  
The closer that I get to you the better that I feel  
I dont have to dream no more no no  
  
Now youre all Im living for yeah  
Cause your love turned my world around  
  
Heaven bound  
  
repeat
