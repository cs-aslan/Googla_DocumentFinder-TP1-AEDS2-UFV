Well I met this old woman  
She was hard as nails  
I think that she just come out  
Of the County jail  
  
But I loaned her some money  
Just to pay her rent  
If I would she would put me  
In her last will and testament  
  
Well I got lots of children  
An exwife or two  
I never hear from them  
Till the bills are due  
  
The money I gave her  
They already spent  
If I could just help em out  
They would put me in their last will and testament  
  
You know Im goin over sixty  
Im older than most  
It wont be long now  
Ill be nothin but a ghost  
  
My intentions  
Its my intent  
To live on a little deeper  
Havin my last will and testament  
  
And when its all over  
They put you in the ground  
Send my belongings  
To the Lost And Found  
  
My intent  
To leave all the little people  
Out of my last will and testament
