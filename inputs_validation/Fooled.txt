Fooled maybe Im just being fooled  
Maybe Ill be ridiculed but I adore you  
If Im fooled then its heaven being fooled  
For you taught a heart unschooled to live just for you  
  
Those who act cautious and wise  
Never have stars in their eyes  
If Im in a fools paradise  
Keep me there for I dont care  
  
If Im fooled and my mind is overruled  
Still my heart has not been fooled  
Cause Ill always love you
