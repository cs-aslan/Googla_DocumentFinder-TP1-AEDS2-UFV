Cant you see this is me  
Cant you see this is me  
  
Dont walk crowded streets  
Choose every dream from a magazine stand  
I dont buy into that  
Allday TV shows  
Sell their souls just to make living easy  
I dont buy into that  
I dont need satin and lace no no no  
Ill bring a smile to your face  
  
Ill never be a fire but I will be the flame  
Ill never be a diamond but Ill never be fake no  
Ive never been a winner but I still play the game  
Cant you see that this is me  
Im all the woman that I want to be  
  
Cant you see this is me a woman  
Cant you see this is me  
  
Good times cant get enough  
Life can be tough but its all for a reason  
I sure buy into that  
Life goes around and around  
We seek what we found cause its all an illusion  
I sure buy into that  
I know the waters of fate yeah yeah  
Will keep on flowing my way  
  
Ill never be a fire but I will be the flame  
Ill never be a diamond but Ill never be fake no no  
Ive never been a winner but I still play the game  
Baby cant you see that this is me  
Im all the woman that I want  
  
Ive never been affraid of myself  
I dont buy into that I dont buy into that  
I dont want to be nobody else  
I dont buy into that I dont buy into that I dont buy into that  
  
Ill never be a fire but I will be the flame be the flame  
Ill never be a diamond but Ill never be fake oh no no no  
Ive never been a winner but I still play the game  
Baby baby cant you see that this is me  
Im all the woman that I want all I want to be  
Ill never be a fire but I will be the flame be the flame  
Ill never be a diamond but Ill never be fake oh no no no
