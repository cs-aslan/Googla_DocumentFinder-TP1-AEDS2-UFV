I look around me  
Im not the only  
Hungry for the love  
My heart needs to find  
But Ive learned now  
You have to want to  
Find yourself inside  
To carry on  
  
Chorus  
Cause it hurts to love sometimes  
Oh it hurts to love someone  
Yes it hurts to lose sometimes  
Oh it hurts to lose someone  
  
So many hearts are broken  
So unnecessary  
And Im afraid to fail  
Again and again  
I keep on searchingand I keep on fighting baby  
To learn to love myself like a child  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gonna scram my pain out loud  
Im gonna run  
Im gonna free myself and fly  
Just like a baby birds first flight  
I will fall  
But Ill pick myself up and head to the sky  
  
Chorus  
  
Its all inside of you  
Its all inside of me  
Its all inside of everything you will see
