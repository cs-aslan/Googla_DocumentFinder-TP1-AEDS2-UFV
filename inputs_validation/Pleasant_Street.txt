You dont remember what to say  
You dont remember what to do  
You dont remember where to go  
You dont remember what to choose  
You wheel you steal you feel you kneel down  
  
All the stony people  
Walking round in Christian licorice clothes  
I cant hesitate  
And I cant wait  
For Pleasant Street  
  
The sunshine reminds you of concreted skies  
You thought you were flying but you opened your eyes  
And you found yourself falling back to yesterdays lies  
Hello Pleasant Street you know shes back again  
You wheel you steal you feel you kneel down  
  
All the stony people  
Walking round in Christian licorice clothes  
I cant hesitate  
And I cant wait  
For Pleasant Street  
  
At twilight your lover comes to your room  
Hell spin you hell weave you round his emerald loom  
And softly youll whisper all around his ear  
Sweet lover I love Pleasant Street  
I wheel I steal I feel my way down to kneel  
  
All the stony people  
Walking round in Christian licorice clothes  
I cant hesitate  
And I cant wait  
For Pleasant Street  
  
You dont remember what to say  
You dont remember what to do  
You dont remember which way to go  
You dont remember who to choose  
You wheel you steal you feel you kneel down
