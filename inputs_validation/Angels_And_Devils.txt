Planning permission tied to post  
We read when were waiting for bus  
Is always doublechecked cause we so often suspect  
They plan to build something on us  
  
What theyll build neither here nor there  
Its what theyll bury that counts  
And how far down theyll push us this time  
And how far back up well bounce  
  
Angels are born with wings not springs  
Devils always born with horns  
And beautiful bird only bothers to sing  
If beautiful day ever dawns dawns  
  
Angels and devils aint so easy to spot  
As movies like to portray  
A devil appears with a cunning veneer  
You often only notice too late  
  
If he says hes got wings keep an eye out for springs  
Make sure your angel is real  
And of all of these things its the song that he sings  
And how the song makes you feel  
  
Angels are born with souls not goals  
Devils always search for the high  
So beautiful birds sing from telegraph poles  
And devils song fills the whole sky sky  
  
Yes birdsong belongs in the highest  
Of places not where devil performs  
Beautiful bird and song shouldnt bother  
To sing if audience mutters and yawns  
  
Mutters and yawns mutters and yawns  
Mutters and yawns it yawns it yawns  
Mutters and yawns mutters and yawns
