They couldnt see what I thought would be so obvious  
They hide behind the laws they made for all of us  
The ministry of truth that deals with pretense  
The ministry of peace that sits on defense  
Im washing my hands of what theyre trying to do  
Its for me its for me its for you its for you  
  
Im just a rock n roll rebel  
Ill tell you no lies  
They say I worship the devil  
They must be stupid or blind  
Im just a rock n roll rebel  
  
They live a life of fear and insecurity  
And all you do is pay for their prosperity  
The ministry of fear that wont let you live  
The ministry of grace that doesnt forgive  
Do what you will to try and make me conform  
Ill make you wish that you had never been born  
  
Cause Im a rock n roll rebel  
Ill do what I please  
Yes Im a rock n roll rebel  
And Im as free as the breeze  
Im just a rock n roll rebel  
  
Theyll try playin win your heart  
They know it rules your head  
If they could read between the lines  
You know theyd see the real day  
  
God only knows why they couldnt see the obvious  
Is it because they manifest the incubus  
The ministry of war that got caught in the draft  
The ministry of joy that still hasnt laughed  
When its all boiled down and the days at an end  
Ill give you no bullshit and Ill never pretend  
  
Cause Im a rock n roll rebel  
Ill tell you no lies  
They say I worship the devil  
Why dont they open their eyes  
Im just a rock n roll rebel  
A rock n roll rebel  
Im just a rock n roll rebel
