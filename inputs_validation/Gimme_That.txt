Storch oh  
S Dot Yea  
  
Ooh Ohh  
  
The dynamic duo  
  
Wow womp womp wompits what your body sayin  
Chris Brown is in the building  
  
The young boy just turned sixteen  
And I got six fours and hot bikes that I rock  
Keep three or four sweeties on my clock  
But all that swinging in that bikini just might convince him  
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop  
Cause you speaking that slang that I talk  
That sassy tempo with that walk  
Maybe the reason that all this teenies may never see me  
  
Chorus x2  
Momma you may be three years older but you hot gimme that  
You be talking like you like what I got gimme that  
I know you like it how I lean in the lac  
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme gimme  
  
Ma take a break let me explain to you  
What ya body got a young boy ready to do  
If you take a chance to let me put them things on you  
I could show you why I make them straight As in school  
Im a hustler Trust my frame and age  
Got you thinking that Im just too young to turn your page  
I can picture us switching lanes in the coupe  
With you on the phone screaming my name  
  
Chris
