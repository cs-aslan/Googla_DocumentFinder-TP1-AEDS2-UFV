If you want to go riding  
In the tall green grass  
Try to not spook the horse  
  
If you want to pet  
That old hound dog  
Make sure he aint  
Rolled in shit  
  
Theres a pretty little girl  
And shes living down there  
Down on her daddys farm  
  
If youre going to mess  
Around with that chick  
Be sure to close the barn door  
  
Try to not spook the horse  
Make sure she aint  
Rolled in shit  
  
Theres a field of green  
And an old red barn  
Deep in the valley of hearts  
  
If you want to go riding  
In the tall green grass  
Try to not spook the horse  
  
Try to not spook the horse  
Try to not spook the horse
