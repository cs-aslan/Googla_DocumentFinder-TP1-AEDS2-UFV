Somethings goin on its the middle of the night  
And my esp woke me up  
  
I know whats going on girl you aint been treating me right  
And your sweet talking aint enough  
I know youre messing with at least two other guys  
You fooled me a long time but the kid is gettin wise  
  
Dont hug me dont kiss me dont love me down  
Excuse me but you see this love affair is  
  
Over now  
You did me bad  
Over now  
Its over now  
You treated me so bad  
Over now  
Its all over baby  
  
I didnt know it when I walked into the house  
But you were on the telephone  
Thats when I heard you tell him to come over tonight  
Said you were gonna be alone  
  
I heard you mention that I had some place to go  
You helped me pack my things but its you whose got to go  
  
Youre busted You must have fooled me for a while  
But honey as they say Hit the road Its all  
  
You can go now keep your voice down  
Theres no need to fuss and shout  
Use the back door I dont want no  
Nosy neighbors to see you checkin out  
  
Get out  
  
Bye baby so long its been Oh wow  
If you really loved me I wouldnt say its
