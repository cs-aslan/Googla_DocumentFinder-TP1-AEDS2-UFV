Waiting I got no town to hide in  
The countrys got a hold of my soul  
TVs dead and there aint no war in my head  
And you seem very beautiful to me  
  
Sleeping but my works not done  
I could be lying on an atom bomb  
Ill take care  
Cause I know youll be there  
You seem very beautiful to me  
  
It is the rest of your life keeps a rolling and rolling  
Picture in my pocket looks like you  
It is the rest of your life keeps a rolling rolling rolling along
