Im not as crazy as I used to be  
Some of my devils upped and left me free  
To find a quiet space  
Im not as out of place  
  
Im not as lonely as I was before  
I dont go in less theres an open door to leave by  
Im starting to believe my own existence has a right to be  
  
And Im comin home again  
Its been too long a time  
Gettin back whats mine  
And I cant remember why I went away  
But its lookin now like maybe I can stay  
  
The poets cried for dreams they never saw  
The only certainty is nothins sure  
And most things stay the same  
Or go back where they came  
  
And though my answers still are undefined  
By takin chances I can start to find some reasons  
Somethin to believe in  
I can make it through  
I can make it through  
  
And Im comin home again  
Its been too long a time  
Gettin back whats mine  
And I cant remember why I went away  
But its lookin now like maybe I can stay  
  
Oh and Im comin home again  
Its been too long a time  
Gettin back whats mine  
And I cant remember why I went away  
But its lookin now like maybe I can stay
