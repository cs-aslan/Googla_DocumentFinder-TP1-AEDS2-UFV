Evry night I watch the lights from the house upon the hill  
I love a little girl who lives up there and I guess I always will  
But I dont dare knock upon her door cause her daddy is my boss man  
So I got to try to be content to see her whenever I can goin  
Chorus  
Down in the boondocks down in the boondocks  
People put me down cause thats the side of town I was born in  
I love her she loves me but I dont fit in her society  
Lord have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks  
But I need money honey give me money honey  
Money honey I need enough money honey  
Ill take it to the bank Ill take it all down just say it to me oh man  
chorus  
One fine day Ill find a way to move from this old shack  
Ill hold my head up like a king and I never will look back  
Until that day Ill work and slave and Ill save every dime  
But tonight shell have to steal away to see me one more time goin  
chorus repeats 2x  
Lord have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks  
Mama have mercy on a boy from down in the  ooh  
Have mercy baby a little mercy hang around all day take me  
Down in the boondocks dadadown in the boondocks repeats out
