I was born to sing a good time song  
You know that nothin used to bring me down  
Til the day I fell in love with you  
And baby thats the day I found  
  
You had me singin the blues  
Singin the blues  
But a good time man like me  
Aint got no business singin the blues  
  
Go on woman get out of here  
You know that I dont wanta see your face  
Cause the things youre doin to this boys mind  
Is just an absolute disgrace  
  
You got him singin the blues  
Singin the blues  
But a good time man like me  
Aint got no business singin the blues  
  
Never gonna fall in love again  
You know I learned my lesson well  
I played the game of love and lost my heart  
You can believe me when I tell you  
  
That Im singin the blues  
Singin the blues  
But a good time man like me  
Aint got no business singin the blues  
  
You got me singin the blues  
Singin the blues  
But a good time man like me  
Aint got no business singin the blues  
  
You had me singin the blues  
Singin the blues  
And a good time man like me  
Aint got no business singin the blues
