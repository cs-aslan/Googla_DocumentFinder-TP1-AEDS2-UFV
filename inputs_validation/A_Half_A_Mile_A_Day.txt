Im comin Lord for my heavenly reward  
Im comin home to you can you see me comin thru  
Thru clouds of persecution and stumblin on my way  
I spect Im only makin bout a half a mile a day  
  
The road to heaven doesnt have a rapid transit plan  
Its one way with no changes heading to the promised land  
But I believe that if Ill heed the things He had to say  
Even I might get to heaven at a half a mile a day  
  
Lord when I let you lead I never make much speed  
Cause I have to stop and touch the ones who need so much  
Then sometimes others pull me off of Your narrow way  
And by my mistakes I barely make a half a mile a day  
  
The road to heaven doesnt have a rapid transit plan  
Its one way with no changes heading to the promised land  
But I believe that if Ill heed the things He had to say  
Even I might get to heaven at a half a mile a day
