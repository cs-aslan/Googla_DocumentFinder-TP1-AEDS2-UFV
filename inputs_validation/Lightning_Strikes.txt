Ok ah were back again and of course youre listening to WBAI in New
York and this program is labrish  
My name is Hab Salashi and were speaking with Baba or maybe Rash Baboa  
Can I try and give a message Hallo  
Go go ahead man  
Yeah I just like to say uhm lets have some music now eh  
Ok ok thank you  
Yo right  
  
Now lightning strikes in old New York  
It may be dark but I wanna talk  
It might rain it might snow  
Theres too many things I got to know  
If this is spring than its time to sing  
Never mind the lil birdies wing  
Look out look out old New York  
New Yorks coming and New York talks  
Hey strike  
Not once strike but twice  
Get out your money peel a slab  
Roll some notes and hail a cab  
Drive in church drive in back  
Drive down Seventh in a tank  
Take in the sights feel the breeze  
See New Yorks one and only tree  
It can be found in Garbage park  
But dont inspect it after dark no  
Strike  
New York  
Lightning  
Not once but twice  
Accidental hike in the transit strike  
Roller skate or ride a bike  
Three to a car Brooklyn Bridge  
You wont get far if youre privileged  
Graffiti Jack sprays in black  
An Englishman can he read it back  
Deli Joe he ought to know  
He runs the gang on Pastrami Row  
Strike  
Lightning  
Strike  
Because glass to glass street to street  
Buildings touch St Peters feet  
From car to bar from prez to shah  
Everything is in the jar  
The four winds blow cause the four winds know  
Takes a special hustle to make a roll  
Honey girl on her feet  
I wish everything to make her sweet  
Strike Strike  
Yeah strike hits twice  
Not once but twice Strike  
Ok so roll  
Yall  
Serieus  
Yall  
From Harlem  
Strike one  
Lightning strike  
  
Harlem slum to penthouse block  
On every door I already knocked  
There wasnt anybody that I didnt leave alone  
Somebody lying under every stone  
Everything that a man could need is in a bag down by my knee  
That looks good and this aint got seeds  
Cheaper than booze down in the bowery  
Lightning strike Strike  
Old New York  
Everythings light  
Bumb oh he touched you there  
Strike Strike  
Hey ho such a night  
Ill see yall when the lightning strike  
A polaroid caught in the act  
Youre married too and thats a fact but I wont peek and I wont squeek  
Down by the trucks on Christopher Street  
Its Cuban Day  
Oi Vey  
Chinese New Year lets call it a day  
Look out lightning strike  
Tootsie  
Fox fox what whatve you got  
Hey bully  
Oh strike  
Lightning  
  
Hey Chi man  
That melody is Puerto Rican  
Hey Chi man is what hes speaking  
And theres the road down into London Town where many cars get broken down  
Its the Westway from Ladbroke Grove  
Runs down to Old Hounslow  
Hash my brother caught a fuff  
Because because you know it  
Just thought Id mention the new extention that runs down the 59th street
intersection  
Did you hear the news yall  
London Town on the Broadway  
Strike
