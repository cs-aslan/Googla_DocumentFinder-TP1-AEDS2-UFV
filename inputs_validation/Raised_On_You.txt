You are the only ones  
You save me from myself  
My company shows on me  
Ive been raised on you  
  
And when it just aint fair  
Nothings left to do  
But sit down here  
And have a beer  
Whatever the world wants to choose  
  
Dont let it fade  
Dont trade love away  
Just keep a sweet dream true  
Lets go tell the world  
To quit turning cold  
Just let me be raised on you  
  
We dont have to change just now  
We can laugh about the load  
I can see us later  
Lighted eyes  
Likely be laughing  
Down the road
