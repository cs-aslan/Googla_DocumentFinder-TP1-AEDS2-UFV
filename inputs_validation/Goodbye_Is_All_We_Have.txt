Im soaring the sky  
I can hear the birds and man they dont lie  
How you gonna catch me when Im this high  
  
Im moving on  
I got the words to a brand new song  
How you gonna catch me when Im this close  
  
Chorus  
Gone tomorrow here today  
Just in case you got somethin to say  
Ill be leaving with the breast of  
Goodbye is all we have  
  
I disconnected the phone  
Told the neighbors Ill be heading home  
As soon as the light hits the morn  
  
Im heading north  
Gonna see what this hearts really worth  
I guess its time to be on my own  
  
Chorus  
  
I sure would love to see you tonight  
Maybe try to end this fight  
If I dont hear you knockin on my door  
Then Ill know for sure  
  
Chorus
