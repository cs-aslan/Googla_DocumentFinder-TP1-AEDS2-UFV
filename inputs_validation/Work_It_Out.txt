Day and night black and white  
You take it all for granted  
Im the one who turns you on  
  
When you dont know where you belong  
And nothin seems to matter  
Im the one whos holding on  
  
Its alright to be wrong  
All we needs a little time  
But nothing here can last that long  
  
We show the world a brand new face  
Its taken us all this time  
All this time  
All of this doubt  
We get to work it out  
All of this doubt  
We get to work it out  
  
Yesterday lost your way  
Still looking for an answer  
Im the one who holds the key  
  
When you dont know where you belong  
And nothing seems to matter  
Ill unlock this mystery  
  
All of this doubt  
Day and night black and white  
Take it all for granted  
We get to work it out  
Im the one who turns you on  
Turns you on turns you on  
All of this doubt  
  
When you dont know where you belong  
And nothin seems to matter  
We get to work it out  
Im the one whos holdin on  
Holdin on holdin on
