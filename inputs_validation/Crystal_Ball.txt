Well Ive heard it Ive heard it all  
Ive heard it all before  
I dont need no gypsy  
I dont need no crystal ball  
  
Since you started messin round on me darlin  
Now the phones ringing off the wall  
And everybody says its so  
I got a broken heart comin and they want me to know  
  
And Ive heard it all  
I dont need a crystal ball  
I got a lady across the hallway  
I got another one way across town  
  
All the people at your birthday party  
You should hear the way theyre puttin me down  
It seems the whole worlds out to spy  
Its like the CIA meets the FBI  
  
And Ive heard it all  
I dont need a crystal ball  
Well Ive heard it all  
I dont need a crystal ball  
  
Well Ive heard it all  
It aint no surprise to me  
I dont watch no television  
I dont read the daily news  
  
Im afraid if I listen to the radio  
Ill hear about the latest things you do  
I dont want no explanation  
Nothin you could say could be a revelation  
  
And Ive heard it all  
I dont need a crystal ball
