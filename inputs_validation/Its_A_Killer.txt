Theres a rumor goin round on the backside of town  
Jake is out to get some revenge  
Has fire in his eyes since his brother died  
Shot down by a socalled friend  
  
For a fifty dollar gram is what the neighbors say  
Drugs had control of his life  
Caught up on crack youre tryin to think back  
The devil had him hooked you could see it in his eyes  
Its a killer  
  
Theres a cold house at the corner of the street  
The kids come and go there at night  
Jerry drove up in front of the house  
Somebody pulled out a knife  
Jerry freaked out and went for his gun  
Shot him right between the eyes  
All he ever wanted was a twenty dollar high  
But now hes locked up for the rest of his life  
  
Chorus  
Its a killer theres no way out baby once your in  
Its a killer steal from your family  
Then youll turn on your friends  
Its a killer it can happen to you  
  
So dont you never never give in  
Its a killer  
  
The neighborhood I used to call home  
These days its lookin like a war zone  
Unemployment on the rise but the black market thrives  
Money just keeps changin hands  
The laws are gettin tough sometimes its not enough  
To satisfy supply and demand  
  
Trouble breaks out theres fightin in the streets  
Bullets flyin all around  
An innocent child caught in the line of fire  
All because there werent enough drugs to go around  
  
Chorus x2
