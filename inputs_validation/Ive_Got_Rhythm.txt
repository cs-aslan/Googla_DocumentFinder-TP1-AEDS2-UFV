Days can be sunny  
With never a sigh  
Dont need what money can buy  
Birds in the trees sing  
Their day full of song  
Why shouldnt we sing along  
  
Im chipper all the day  
Happy with my lot  
How do I get that way  
Look at what Ive got  
  
I got rhythm  
I got music  
I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more  
Ive got daisies  
In green pastures  
I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more  
  
Old Man Trouble  
I dont mine him  
You wont find him  
Round my door  
  
I got starlight  
I got sweet dreams  
I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more  
  
I got rhythm  
I got music  
I got my man  
Who could ak for anything more  
I got daisies  
In green pastures  
I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more  
  
Old Man Trouble  
I dont mind him  
You wont find him  
Hangin round my front or back door  
  
Who could ask for anything more  
Who could ask for anything more
