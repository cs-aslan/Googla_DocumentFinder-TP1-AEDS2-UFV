No more carefree laughter  
Silence ever after  
Walking through an empty house tears in my eyes  
Here is where the story ends this is goodbye  
  
Knowing me knowing you ahhaa  
There is nothing we can do  
Knowing me knowing you ahhaa  
We just have to face it this time were through  
This time were through this time were through  
This time were through were really through  
Breaking up is never easy i know but i have to go  
I have to go this time  
I have to go this time i know  
Knowing me knowing you  
Its the best i can do  
  
Memries memries good days good days bad days bad days  
Theyll be theyll be with me with me always always  
In these old familiar rooms children would play  
Now theres only emptiness nothing to say  
  
Knowing me knowing you ahhaa  
There is nothing we can do  
Knowing me knowing you ahhaa  
We just have to face it this time were through  
This time were through this time were through  
This time were through were really through  
Breaking up is never easy i know but i have to go  
I have to go this time  
I have to go this time i know  
Knowing me knowing you  
Its the best i can do
