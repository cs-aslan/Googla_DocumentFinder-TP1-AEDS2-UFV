Tell you how the story stands  
Im a victim in your hands  
Got me pleading on my bended knees  
Thats the way the picture reads  
Its a horror show  
Its a body blow  
And its gone too far  
  
Tell me a reason  
Well give me a sign  
Somebody somewhere  
Throw me a line  
Somebody down there  
Looking for blood  
Off with the horses  
Into the flood  
  
Now youve made a big mistake  
Spoiled the icing on the wedding cake  
Killed the goose that laid the golden egg  
This time babe youre going to have to beg  
Its a crying shame  
Its a dying flame  
And its gone too far  
  
Tell me a reason  
Give me a sign  
Somebody somewhere  
Throw me a line  
Somebody down there  
Looking for blood  
Off with the horses  
Yeah into the flood  
  
So you pulled the perfect crime  
Turned the water into wine  
  
Got me on my bended knees  
Nows the time to make me squeeze  
  
Came in from the freezing cold  
Turned the glitter into gold from the barbican  
  
Its a bloody mess  
Its a bodyblow  
And its gone too far
