Your love is fading I can feel your love fading  
Woman its fading away from me  
Cause your personal touch has grown cold  
As if someone else controls your very soul  
I fooled myself long as I can  
I can feel the presence of another man  
  
Its there when you speak my name  
Its just not the same  
Oh honey Im losing you  
I can feel it in the air its there everywhere  
Oh Im losing you  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
Any day youll be up and gone  
Oh Im losing you  
Its all over your face someones takin my place  
Could it be that Im losing you  
  
When I look into your eyes a reflection of a face I see  
Oh Lord Im losing you  
Im hurt downhearted and worried girl  
Cause that face doesnt belong to me  
  
Your love is fadin I can feel it fadin  
Oh away from me  
I can feel it in the air its there everywhere  
Oh Im losing you  
I dont wanna lose you  
But I know Im gonna groove you  
Oh Lord Im losing you  
  
I dont wanna lose you  
But I know Im gonna groove you  
Oh Lord Im losing you and Im a losin you  
  
Your love is fadin I can feel it fadin  
Oh Lord Im losing you
