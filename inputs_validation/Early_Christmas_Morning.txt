Listen to the children sing  
Watch them dancing all round the Christmas tree   
Waiting for the opening  
Early Christmas morning   
  
All around the world is sleeping  
Little children theres no peeping  
Wait and see what Santas bringing  
Early Christmas morning   
  
Icicles and breakfast cakes   
Friends and family we will celebrate  
Sounds that joy and laughter make  
Early Christmas morning   
  
All around and far off places  
Angels waken smiling faces  
Wrapping us with love and graces  
Early Christmas morning   
Early Christmas morning
