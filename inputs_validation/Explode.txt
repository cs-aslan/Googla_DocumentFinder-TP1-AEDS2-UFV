Theirs something I should get off my chest  
Im losing my mind and my lifes a mess  
Well everyone says do this and do that  
Maybe theyre right  
I feel like Im gonna  
Explode Im gonna explode  
It is so big yet I feel so small  
Its even in your shopping mall  
Is my life wasting away  
Dont throw it away thats what they say  
I dont want to go out and fail  
Yet I fail at home every day  
I wonder someday if Ill look back  
With regrets on how I lived  
Each way I turn I turn my back  
Each time I turn I always look back  
Im trying to please everyone I dont know how  
I feel like Im gonna  
Explode Im gonna explode  
What should I do I really dont know  
Should I stay home or should I go  
Well Im struggling with my sanity  
Is my life crumbling in front of me  
Oh  
Do you know how it feels  
To feel like your gonna explode  
Do you ever feel  
Like your gonna explode  
Explode
