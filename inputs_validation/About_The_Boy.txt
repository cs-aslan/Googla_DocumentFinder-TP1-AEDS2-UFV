Its the verse in my head  
The words that make me stutter  
The swag in my step  
The change from gray to color  
A guaranteed bet  
Oh I found my lucky number  
The feeling that you get  
Cant help but make me wonder  
  
No need to try  
Hes just right  
Hes got that something  
I cant let nobody tell me no  
No I dont mind  
Takes me high  
I wont stop until the boy is mine  
  
He got me good  
Ive got it bad  
He got me feeling like a girl gone mad  
Got me running around like Im a lovefool  
Taking me down I cant stop  
He got me up  
I cant come down  
He got me locked and I dont want out  
I know hes playing my heart and I aint got no choice  
Theres just something about the boy  
Something about

Its the first time we met  
The lightening to my thunder  
The green light on red  
The kiss that pulls me under  
Its only for me  
If youre the test I got the answer  
And Im all that you need  
Now you finally get the chance to  
  
No need to try

But Im running out of time  
Its like I lost my self control  
Cause you are the one  
And you know what youve done  
My poor hearts come undone
