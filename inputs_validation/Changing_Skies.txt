I need somebody who calls my name  
When clouds are smokin up my way  
You get me through these chchanging skies  
  
I dont wanna be afraid again  
Its just that I could use a friend  
You get me through these chchanging skies  
  
Give me something that I  
Can wrestle to the ground  
There isnt anything that I cant handle now Were out  
Believe me when I say  
That I Will Be Okay  
And listen thats advised  
And my ChChanging skies

Dont wanna be the kind to cry  
I wanna dance right through the night  
You get me through these chchanging skies  
  
Know that I am not emotional  
Its just that I dont wanna fall  
Without my parachute tonight  
  
Give me something that I  
Can wrestle to the ground  
There isnt anything that I cant handle noweow  
Believe me when I say  
That I Will Be Okay  
And listen thats advised  
And my chchanging skies
