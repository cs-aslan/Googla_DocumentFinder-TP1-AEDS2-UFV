When you come back I wont be here  
She said and gently pulled me near  
If you want to talk you can call  
I know its not your fault  
  
I just smiled and said let go of me  
But theres something that Ive just gotta know  
Did someone else steal my part  
She said its not my fault  
  
Then my heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
Cause its all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesnt want you too  
  
I was drifted in between  
Like I was on the outside looking in yeah yeah  
In my dreams you are still here  
Like youve always been  
  
Oh yeah my heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
Cause its all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesnt want you too  
  
I gave myself away completely  
But you just couldnt see me  
Though I was sleeping in your bed  
Cause someone else was on your mind  
In your head  
  
When I came back she wasnt there  
Just a note left on the stairs  
If you want to talk give me a call  
  
My heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
Cause its all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesnt want you too  
When the one that you want doesnt want you  
  
My heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
Cause its all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesnt want you too  
  
Siberia Siberia  
When the one you want doesnt want you too
