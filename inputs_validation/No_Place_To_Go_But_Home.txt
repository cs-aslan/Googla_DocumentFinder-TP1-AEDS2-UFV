They turned out the lights friends have said there goodnight  
Now theres no place to go but home  
Ive had a beautiful evening for awhile Ive forgot you were gone  
Now youre back on my mind how I hate closing time  
For theres no place to go but home  
No place to go but home and nobody home when I get there  
They turned out the lights friends have said their goodnight  
Now theres no place to go but home  
  
 acguitar  steel   
  
I drive through this ghost of the city and Ive never felt so alone  
Its the worlds time to sleep and my time to weep  
For theres no place to go but home for theres no place to go but home
