With a wink  
And a smile  
You toss your instructions on  
How to catch a train  
While its moving  
You always were the one  
That kept us all guessing  
How you could survive  
The fall you had  
  
from medicine men  
To my DJ friends  
They all have said  
Hes got to watch his back  
  
theyre trapping angels  
By the Potomac  
But its not how you think  
Youd be surprised  
They liberate  
Your dreamscape  
Till you cant remember  
To recall  
Where your wings  
Have gone  
Tell me where theyve gone  
  
From Jordan to Chicago  
Another child is born  
Trusting that well get it  
Right this time  
I shouldve worn my glasses  
You said just to trust  
Then you chose  
To sign the dotted line  
  
From modern Magdalenes  
To my DJ friends  
They all have said  
Hes got to watch his back  
  
Theyre trapping angels  
By the Potomac  
But its not how you think  
Youd be surprised  
They liberate  
Your dreamscape  
Till you cant remember  
To recall  
Where your wings  
Have gone  
  
Before I close my eyes at night  
I can still see you smilin  
Before the truth was  
Buried alive  
Did we prize it  
Before you change the world  
Maybe boy you should change  
Your girl  
  
Theyre trapping angels  
By the Potomac  
Theyre trapping angels  
Lord I know this  
Theyre trapping angels  
By the Potomac  
But were getting closer  
I said were getting closer  
To where theyve gone  
Tell me where theyve gone  
  
Now it wont be long
