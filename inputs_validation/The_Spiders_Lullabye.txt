In a little cottage in the country side  
Lives a man called harry and he is losing his mind  
Listen hear the spiders lullabye  
Its really sad for harry he finds a spider scary  
Even the smallest species will make him feel uneasy  
Oh they live in every corner  
Oh and here comes the summer  
Theres another spider on his wall gotta kill it  
Soon to be another creamy spot  
As he woke up this morning there was a spider crawling  
He felt the big surprise before it caught his eyes  
Oh in between his face  
Oh and his pillow case  
Theres another spider on his wall gotta kill it  
Soon to be another creamy spot  
Here comes another one hahahahaha  
Hes got to find a doctor a very special doctor  
Someone who can cure his mind  
Someone who knows harrys kind  
Listen hear the spiders lullabye  
Those creepy crawly creatures  
With all their hairy features  
Hoping to catch a fly  
Singing itss deadly lullabye  
Oh oh no  
Theres another spider on his wall gotta kill it
