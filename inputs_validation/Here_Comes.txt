Here comes the rationalization  
Here comes the song I know  
Theres a change of weather coming  
Theres a change in me and you  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
Freedom is intoxicating  
Its a lizard in your hand  
Dont you worry about the future  
I need some in my plan  
  
Here comes my kamikaze  
Here comes Gods top ten  
Nothing to be done to stop it  
Nothing to get in its way
