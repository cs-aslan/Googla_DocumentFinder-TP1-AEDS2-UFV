Its been one week since we got to see  
Cheatin lovers and cousins that marry  
Five days since they had the show  
With the hermaphrodite the slut and the crack ho  
Three days since we heard the tale  
About the guy who learned his woman was a shemale  
Yesterday it occurred to me  
That Ive been watchin a bit too much Jerry Springer  
  
Holy cow dyou see it last week  
Well they had this one freak  
Who suckerpunched his whole family  
Do you recall when the brawl  
Became a total freeforall  
And Jerrys in the middle tryin to be the referee  
Hey see the stripper with the implants  
She likes to lap dance  
And date the boyfriend of her mother  
Now here comes Jerrys next guest  
And its a slugfest  
Cause its her trailer trash brother  
Nymphomaniac is back on crack  
Its like When Animals Attack  
They all exhibit reprehensible behavior  
Hit em in the nose tear off their clothes  
Step on their toes thats how it goes  
They get so violent they have to sign a waiver  
  
Theyre always swearin cursin kickin butt and pointin blame  
On the air They dont care theyve got no shame  
There was one guy who Im sure felt a little strange  
When he found out that his wife had a sex change  
They have a tendency to scream and yell constantly  
They have a history of ripping off their shirts  
  
Its been one week since they had the fight  
With the Siamese twins and the transvestite  
Five days since that awful brawl  
They still havent got the blood off the wall  
Its been three days since the bitter feud  
Between the KKK and that gay Jewish black dude  
Yesterday finally dawned on me  
Im spendin way too much time on that Jerry Springer  
  
Baby Ive been sleepin with your sister  
Oh which one  
All of em  
Ah well Ive been sleepin with your best friend Jake  
Yeah WWell me too And Ive been sleepin with your dog Woofie  
Woofie you bitch Well Im also sleepin with your pet goat  
That goat doesnt love you  
  
Once you start watchin theres just no stoppin  
Your brain shuts down then your IQs droppin  
Jerrys the king of confrontation  
Hes a sensation  
He puts the sin in syndication  
Its totally worthless like a bad check  
Its like a train wreck  
Dont want to stare but you cant look away  
Like Sally Jesse he does talk shows  
But with more weirdos  
The ratings jumpin higher every day  
If youve seen the show well then you know  
Its just as low as you can go  
The guests are tacky and theyre lacking in their hygiene  
And pretty soon some ugly goon  
Comes in the room and then its BOOM  
In the face of some unsuspecting drag queen  
  
Well its the kind of show where people scream obscenities  
Yankin hair throwin chairs at their hubbies  
Jerry Jerry Now the crowd starts their favorite chant  
Should I turn off my TV I just cant  
I have a tendency to watch it religiously  
I have a history of taping each one  
  
Its been one week since the show about  
Psycho killers with problems they should work out  
Five days since the big surprise  
When some losers wife said that shes still dating twenty guys  
Three days since he interviewed  
A bunch of psychic porn star midgets who were all nude  
Yesterday it occurred to me  
That Ive been watchin a bit too much Jerry Springer  
Tired of wastin my time on that Jerry Springer  
Ive got way too much class to watch Jerry Springer  
Come over here and pull on my finger
