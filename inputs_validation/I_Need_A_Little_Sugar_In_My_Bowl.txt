Tired of bein lonely tired of bein blue  
I wished I had some good man to tell my troubles to  
Seem like the whole worlds wrong since my mans been gone  
I need a little sugar in my bowl  
I need a little hot dog on my roll  
I can stand a bit of lovin oh so bad  
I feel so funny I feel so sad  
I need a little steamheat on my floor  
Maybe I can fix things up so theyll go  
Whats the matter hard papa come on and save you mamas soul  
Cause I need a little sugar in my bowl doggone it  
I need a little sugar in my bowl  
I need a little sugar in my bowl  
I need a little hot dog between my rolls  
You gettin different Ive been told  
Move your finger drop something in my bowl  
I need a little steamheat on my floor  
Maybe I can fix things up so theyll go  
spoken Get off your knees I cant see what youre drivin at  
Its dark down there  
Looks like a snake seemon here and drop somethin here in my bowl  
Stop your foolin and drop somethin in my bowl
