Baby dont you be so mean  
I try to keep my conversation clean  
But you the flyest thing Ive seen yeah  
Since I came up in here youre a superstar my dear  
I dont wanna waste your time  
With no corny player lines corny player lines  
But girl if you dont mind  
I would love to occupy the space right by your side  
  
Chorus  
Girl can we chill  
Talk about leavin together sure we will  
But just for now dont let my champagne spill on you  
As you make your move to the floor floor floor floor  
Girl can we chill  
Talk about leavin together sure we will sure we will  
Later Ill do everything you want me to  
Makin love to you  
Beg for more more more more  
  
Shawty speakin honestly speakin honestly  
I can picture you and me picture you and me  
Bein ever so discreet ever so discreet  
Disappearin to the back of this club imagine that baby  
Dont get mad at me  
No baby girl I was just playin  
Hey unless you really wanna go  
Youre in control just let me know  
But right now my song is playin  
Lets take it to the floor  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
Ooo dont wanna rush  
Lets take it slow  
Enjoy the night babe  
Then you decide if you want to  
Get to know me on a physical side  
Baby tonight Oh baby tonight  
Lets get right Lets get it right  
  
Chorus
