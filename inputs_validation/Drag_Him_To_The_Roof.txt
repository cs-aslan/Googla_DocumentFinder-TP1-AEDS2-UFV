They keep looking through the window  
A cathode glaze across their eyes  
Now that Ive been betrayed  
I must be well behaved  
Ill drink corruption with their lies  
  
Why was I hiding out  
What am I running from  
Why are they waiting  
Have I always been the chosen one  
  
Drag him to the roof  
Just push me over  
Ive got no better place to be  
Drag him to the roof  
Lets get it over  
Its a perfect day to punish me  
  
I wish that lady would defend me  
I cant abide by all the laws  
Ill buy the magistrate cant be a second late  
I anxiously await his call  
  
Who made this jigsaw puzzle  
Wholl put the pieces back  
Wholl come and get me when I have fallen through the cracks  
  
Drag him to the roof  
Just push me over  
Ive got no better place to be  
Drag hime to the roof  
Lets get it over  
Its a perfect day to punish me
