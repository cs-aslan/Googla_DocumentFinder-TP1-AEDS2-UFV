Sometimes we make it harder than it is  
Well take a perfect night  
And fill it up with words we dont mean  
Dark sides best unseen  
And we wonder why were feeling this way  
  
Sometimes i wonder if we really feel the same  
Why we can be unkind  
Questioning the strongest of hearts  
Thats when we must start  
Believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far  
  
Thats what love is for  
To help us through it  
Thats what love if for  
Nothing else can do it  
  
Melt our defenses  
Bring us back to our senses  
Give us strength to try once more  
Baby thats what love is for  
  
Sometimes i see you  
And you dont know i am there  
And im washed away by emotions  
I hold deep down inside  
Getting stronger with time  
Its living through the fire  
And holding on we find  
  
Thats what love is for  
To help us through it  
Thats what love if for  
Nothing else can do it  
  
Melt our defenses  
Bring us back to our senses  
Give us strength to try once more  
Baby thats what love is for  
  
Believing in the one thing  
That has gotten us this far  
Thats what love is for  
To help us through it  
Thats what love if for  
Nothing else can do it  
  
Round off the edges  
Talk us down from the ledges  
Give us strength to try once more  
Baby thats what love is for  
Thats what love if for  
  
Thats what love if for  
Melt our defenses  
Bring us back to our senses  
Give us strength to try once more  
  
Baby thats what love is for  
Thats what love if for  
Thats what love if for  
Thats what love if for
