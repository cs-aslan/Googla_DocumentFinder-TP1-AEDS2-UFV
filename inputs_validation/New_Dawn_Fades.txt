A change of speed a change of style  
A change of scene with no regrets  
A chance to watch admire the distance  
Still occupied though you forget  
Different colors different shades  
Over each mistakes were made  
I took the blame  
Directionless so plain to see  
A loaded gun wont set you free  
So you say  
  
Well share a drink and step outside  
An angry voice and one who cried  
Well give you everything and more  
The strains too much cant take much more  
Oh Ive walked on water run through fire  
Cant seem to feel it anymore  
It was me waiting for me  
Hoping for something more  
Me seeing me this time hoping for something else
