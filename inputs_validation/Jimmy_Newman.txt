Get up Jimmy Newman the morning is come  
The engines are rumbling  
The coffees all brewed  
Get up Jimmy Newman theres work to be done  
And why do you lie there still sleeping  
Theres a waiting line forming  
To use the latrine  
And the sun is just opening the skies  
The breakfast theyre serving just has to be seen  
And youve only to open your eyes  
Get up Jimmy Newman my radios on  
The news is all bad but its good for a laugh  
The tent flap is loose and the peg must be gone  
And why do you lie there still sleeping  
The night nurse is gone  
And the sexy ones here  
And she tells us such beautiful lies  
Her uniforms tight  
Oh her marvelous rear  
And youve only to open your eyes  
Get up Jimmy Newman youre missing the fun  
Theyre talking us next Jim  
Its time to go home  
Its over for us theres no more to be done  
And why do you lie there still sleeping  
Its state side for us Jim  
The folks may not know  
And well let it be such a surprise  
Theyre loading us next Jim were ready to go  
And youve only to open your eyes  
And youve only to open your eyes  
Get up Jimmy open your eyes
