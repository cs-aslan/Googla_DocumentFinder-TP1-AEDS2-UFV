A church is burning  
The flames rise higher  
Like hands that are praying aglow in the sky  
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying  
You can burn down my churches but I shall be free  
  
Three hooded men through the back road did creep  
Torches in their hands while the village lies asleep  
Down to the church where just hours before  
Voices were singing and hands were beating  
And saying I wont be a slave any more  
  
And a church is burning  
The flames rise higher  
Like hands that are praying aglow in the sky  
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying  
You can burn down my churches but I shall be free  
  
Three hooded men their hands lit the spark  
Then they faded in the night and they vanished in the dark  
And in the cold light of morning theres nothing that remains  
But the ashes of a bible and can of kerosene  
  
And a church is burning  
The flames rise higher  
Like hands that are praying aglow in the sky  
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying  
You can burn down my churches but I shall be free  
  
A church is more than just timber and stone  
And freedom is a dark road when youre walking it alone  
But the future is now and its time to take a stand  
So the lost bells of freedom can ring out in my land  
  
And a church is burning  
The flames rise higher  
Like hands that are praying aglow in the sky  
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying  
You can burn down our churches but I shall be free
