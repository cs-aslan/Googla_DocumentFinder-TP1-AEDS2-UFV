Red ribbons hanging up  
Tennessee Square  
Old people laughing and singing  
And dancing down there  
Id like to join them  
I got no money to spare  
So I sit here and watch from the porch  
Drinking whiskey in granddaddys chair  
Ferris wheel lights look like pictures  
Id seen in a book somewhere  
Vacant parking lots across the street  
Remind me Im going nowhere  
Id like to join them  
I got no money to spare  
So I sit here and watch from the porch  
Drinking whiskey in granddaddys chair  
Its difficult to go on  
Knowing youre out there somwhere  
Vacant parking lots across the street  
Remind me Im going nowhere
