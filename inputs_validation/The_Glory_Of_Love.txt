This is a song Ive been singing for a long time  
Its like an old friend  
But you know I think it  
Its only recently that I discovered what its really about  
  
Youve got to give a little take a little  
And let your poor heart break a little  
Thats the story of thats the glory of love  
  
Youve got to laugh a little cry a little  
Until the clouds roll by a little  
Thats the story of thats the glory of love  
  
As long as theres the two of us  
Weve got the world and all its charms  
And when the world is through with us  
Weve got each others arms  
  
Youve got to win a little lose a little  
Yes and always have the blues a little  
Thats the story of thats the glory of love  
Thats the story of thats the glory of love
