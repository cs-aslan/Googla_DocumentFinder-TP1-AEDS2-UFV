You crawled away from me  
Slipped away from me  
I tried to keep a hold  
But there was nothing I could say  
You slid and crept away  
And there was nothing I could say  
So what youre trying to say  
Is you dont wanna play  
But what you want and what you need  
Doesnt mean fuck to me  
Because I can see your back is turning  
If I could Id stick the knife in  
This is love  
This is my love for you  
Get up  
Now  
Say you wont go
