The love the love is  
Bigger  
The love the love is  
Bigger  
The love the love is  
Bigger  
Big  
  
Gotta believe in me  
Believe me like a fairytale  
Put your tooth under your pillowcase  
And know I wont I wont  
Ever ever let you down no  
Like a seesaw let you down oh  
You know why  
Cause we aint in the playground no more baby  
  
Were big enough  
To stand in the picture  
Were big enough  
To stand next to love  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now Im bigger  
Im bigger  
A heartbreaker  
When I was little  
But now Im bigger  
Im bigger  
And all the haters  
I swear they look so small from up here  
Cause were bigger  
And loves bigger  
Im bigger and youre bigger  
  
Whoa oh  
Remember when my heart was young  
You were still bigger than me  
Is that the reason that you stayed  
Most wouldve got rid of me  
Now the bullys in the school yard  
Cant take our hugs and our kisses from us  
Because we aint pushovers no more baby  
  
Were big enough  
To stand in the picture  
Were big enough  
To stand next to love  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now Im bigger  
Im bigger  
A heartbreaker  
When I was little  
But now Im bigger  
Im bigger  
And all the haters  
I swear they look so small from up here  
Cause were bigger  
And loves bigger  
Im bigger and youre bigger  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now Im bigger  
Im bigger  
A heartbreaker  
When I was little  
But now Im bigger  
Im bigger  
And all the haters  
I swear they look so small from up here  
Cause were bigger  
And loves bigger

Remember those stroll down street I remember that  
Dont like Edle Lane Like yesterday  
They shine on me We were little then  
In class I dreamed about you My baby  
You wow wow You wow wow  
Since then all I can remember is the love only got bigger  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now Im bigger
