Lets take a map of the world  
Tear it into pieces  
All of the boys and the girls  
Will see how easy it is  
  
Chorus  
To put it all down and start again  
From the top to the bottom and then  
Ill have faith or I prefer  
To think that things couldnt turn out worse  
  
All that we need at the starts  
Universal revolution thats all  
And if we trust in our hearts  
Well find the solutions  
  
Chorus  
  
Took a plane across the world  
Got in a car  
And when I reached my destination  
I hadnt gone far  
  
Lets take the whole of the world  
The mountains and the sand  
Let all the boys and the girls  
Shape it in their hands  
  
Chorus
