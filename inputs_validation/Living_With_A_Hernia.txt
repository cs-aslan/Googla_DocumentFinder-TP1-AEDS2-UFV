All I do is grunt and groan  
Hurts me to walk anywhere  
Went to see my physician Dr Jones  
He took my trousers off told me to cough  
Doctor says there aint nothin to discuss  
He tells me any day I might have to wear a truss  
  
Living with a hernia  
All the time such aggravation  
Living with a hernia  
Gonna be my ruination  
Living with a hernia  
Got to have an operation  
Feel so old  
  
Too much bad pain  
Good gawd drives me insane  
Cant run barely crawl  
Got a bulge in my intestinal wall  
Walk real funny bless my soul  
Cant play tennis and its hard to bowl  
You cant even do the splits now better call it quits now  
Im sick of all this dancin anyhow  
  
Living with a hernia  
Hurts me bad in a tender location  
Living with a hernia  
Had enough humiliation  
Living with a hernia  
Got to have an operation  
  
I live with a hernia  
Cant get up cant bend over  
Now I live with a hernia  
Wait a minute

Of hernias that you could get
