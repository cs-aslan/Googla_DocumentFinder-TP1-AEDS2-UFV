Hook  
Thats not love  
Thats not love  
Thats not love  
  
Lil Wayne  Verse 1  
Snakes in the grass so I stay in the pavement  
Survived the battle with animals and cavemen  
And dead animals and dead men  
Im all in and my only friend is Amen  
Keep your mouth cosed you wanna know why you die  
The answers right under your nose  
Exposed to the street in the game I dont cheat  
I just play my position get mvp  
I get money dont shit come free  
Its my life and I run it even when  
Keep my business in my pockets dont wash with bleach  
And I never show my hand not even to me  
See  
  
Hook  
  
Fabolous  Verse 2  
Say whats on your heart if youre real  
Cause the scars you cant see be the hardest to heal  
And I used to chase money now I have it brought  
Cause you can only chase something that you havent caught  
If theres a summertime in hell its not as hot  
You empty clip niggas aint got a shot  
  
These diamonds on my neck are an eyesore  
Now you decide if their to die for  
Advice to my haters do what I say now  
Report to the nearest roof and take the fast way down  
Thought it was love how foolish of us  
I do me she do her sometimes we do eachother  
  
Hook  
  
Lil Wayne  Verse 3  
Look as the crooked World revolves  
Love spelt backwards is evol evolve  
And Evil spelt backwards is live or live  
And when death comes you better have lives to give  
I spit that real talk like knives to ribs  
And rats die ugly die with kids  
These niggas is snitching and still living  
I hope my words are like razors to the bitches  
Niggas pretend like they actually in  
But when it go down they fck around and be them  
That blood look familiar when its leaking  
If you scared go see a Deacon nigga  
That aint love  
  
Hook  
  
Fabolous  Verse 4  
Life is but a dream  
Aint always what it seems  
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream  
Raise your glass and lets toast to when we didnt have  
Hustle plus muscle equal success I did the math  
I see these haters in passing yeah they round  
I be on the way up they be on the way down  
Now I can sit and talk shit like Skip Bayless  
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless  
Lifestyle Alist young black and famous  
Bunch of bad bitches in an Ipod playlist  
Just anothger page in my success story  
I make my worst enemies wish the best for me
