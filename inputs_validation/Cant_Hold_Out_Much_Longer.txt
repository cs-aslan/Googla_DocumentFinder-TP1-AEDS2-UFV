You know Im just crazy about you baby  
Wonder do you ever think of me  
You know Im crazy about you baby  
But you dont care nothing in the world for me  
  
Well I cant sleep at night  
I just catch naps through the day  
I cant hold on much longer  
Lord living this away  
  
You know Im crazy about you baby  
Wonder do you ever think of me  
You know Im in love with you darling  
But you dont care nothing in the world for me  
  
Now aint but the one thing baby  
Really makes your daddy drink  
You say that you dont love me  
Lord and I begin to think  
  
You know Im crazy about you baby  
Wonder do you ever think of me  
You know Im just wild about you baby  
But you dont care nothing in the world for me
