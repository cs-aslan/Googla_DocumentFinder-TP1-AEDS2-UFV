Oh dont sell me out only love  
You dont get it so well  
  
Please tell someone  
Everything is gone  
Dream less of me less to guess on you  
I felt so much  
Every tick and tussle  
Heart torn because its a kissin time  
  
So pass on by  
Youll never find out  
I love someone else  
Find your God  
Youll find yourself  
But he falls  
Im confessing to you  
Just my guess  
Its a kissin time  
  
He cant pass on you  
Oh no I see far right through you  
  
Please understand my kissin song  
Think for yourself  
Its a lesson guess its kissin time  
Heart torn because  
Parts of me Id sell myself  
Oh just in time Im assessing myself  
  
Someone told me  
Keep on hold me  
Dont let go until I reach the other side  
  
Your time will come  
Your time will come again  
Your time will come  
Your time will come again  
Your time will come  
Your time will come again  
Your time will come  
Your time will come again  
Your time will come  
Your time will come again  
Your time will come  
Your time will come again  
  
Someone told me keep on hold me  
Dont let go until I reach the other side  
  
Your time will come  
Your time will come  
Your time will come  
Your time will come  
  
Time  
Time  
Time
