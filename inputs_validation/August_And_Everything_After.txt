Theyre wakin up Maria cause everybody else has got some place to go  
She makes a little motion with her head  
Rolls over  
And she says shes gonna sleep for a couple minutes more  
Ive said Im sorry to Maria for the cold hearted thing that I have done  
Ive said Im sorry by now at least once to just about everyone  
She says Ive forgotten what Im supposed to do today  
And it slips my mind what Im supposed to say  
Were getting older and older and older  
And always a little further out of the way  
You look into her eyes and its more than your heart will allow  
In August and Everything After you get a little less than you expected
somehow  
  
I stumbled into Washington Square just as the sun began to rise  
I lay down on the lawn of the cathedral  
Right down with the shadow of St Marys in the sky  
And Im just one of these late model children waiting for the king  
Yeah but there aint no sign of Elvis in San Fransisco  
Its just me and Im playing this rock and roll thing  
And She wants to be just like me  
And I want every damn thing I can see  
One day youre Daddys little angel  
The next day youre everything he wanted you to be  
They dress you up in white satin  
And they give you your very own pair of wings  
In August and Everything After Im after everything  
  
I said and la la la la  
  
Well now I got my reservations and I got my seven milliondollar home  
And I got I got the number of some girl in New York City  
Whos always wide awake so I never have to spend the night alone  
I got this nasty little habit of peeking down the shirts  
Of all the little girls as they pass me by  
And I wonder if it all catches up to me  
Do you think theyll take me down  
Do you think Im gonna cry  
Well Ive already got your disease  
So take your fucking filthy hands off of me  
Well I hope you werent expecting me to be crucified  
The best that they can do is just to hang me from the nearest tree  
  
Its midnight in san francisco  
and I am waiting here for jesus on my knees  
in august and everything after  
I want somebody else to bleed for me  
I said la la la la Na na  
  
Well I came down from north dakota  
cause I had confidence in the military mind  
and now everyone I know is turning show girl  
and is dancing with their shirt off in some las vegas hotel line  
so Im going to new york city cause it gotta little sleazy here for me  
when I find myself alone I know Im never going home  
I make the changes the changes that I need  
but I no longer know how to pray  
and Im living in A dog town and its A dalmation parade  
I change my spots over and over  
but they never seem to fade away  
now I am the last remaining indian  
looking for the place where the buffalo roam  
in august and everything after man them buffalo aint never coming home  
I said in august and everything after man them buffalo aint never coming
home  
I said na na La la
