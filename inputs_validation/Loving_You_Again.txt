Its been so long now since we first met  
But the time and place I will never forget  
Darling never  
  
Trough good and bad we stood the tested time  
You say Im yours and darling youre still mine  
Forever  
  
So smile for me  
Cause its there for all to see  
After all this time  
Through the rain and tears  
After all this time  
After all these years  
Im only loving you again  
  
And Ill keep holding on girl I wont let go  
I want you near me where ever I go  
Please say forever  
  
And I give thanks for what youve given me  
And in my heart girl therell always be  
A light  
That shines through the darkest night  
After all this time  
Through the rain and tears  
After all this time  
After all these years  
Im only loving you again  
  
So smile for me  
Cause its there for all to see  
After all this time  
Through the rain and tears  
After all this time  
After all these years  
Im only loving you again  
  
Through the rain and tears  
Till the sun dries up the sea  
Till the rivers they run dry  
Im gonna be loving you again
