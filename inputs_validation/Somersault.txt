Youre the prince to my ballerina  
Youll feed all the peoples parking meters  
You encourage the eating of ice cream  
And you would somersault in sand with me  
  
You talk to loners  
You ask hows your week  
You give love to all  
And give love to me  
Youre obsessed with hiding  
The sticks and stones  
And feel the unknown  
You feel like home  
You feel like home  
  
You put my feet back on the ground  
Oh did you know you brought me home  
Yeah you were sweet and you were sound  
Can you save me  
  
Youre the wars in my summers breeze  
Youre the ivories in my ebony key  
You would share your last jelly bean  
And you would somersault in sand with me  
  
You put my feet back on the ground  
Oh did you know you brought me home  
Yeah you were sweet and you were sound  
You save me  
  
You put my feet back on the ground  
Oh did you know you brought me home  
Yeah you were sweet and you were sound  
See I have tried  
You still bring me around n around n around  
  
n around n around n around  
Yeah yeah oh oh  
You brought me around  
Yeah yeah oh oh
