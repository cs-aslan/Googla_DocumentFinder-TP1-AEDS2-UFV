MamaI found someone  
Like you said would come along  
Hes a sight so unlike  
Any man Ive known  
I was afraid to let him in  
Cause Im not the trustin kind  
But now Im convinced  
That hes heaven sent  
And must be out of his mind  
  
Chorus  
Mama hes crazy  
Crazy over me  
And in my life is where he says  
He always wants to be  
Ive never been so in love  
He beats all Ive ever seen  
Mama hes crazy  
Hes crazy over me  
  
And Mama youve always said  
Better look before you leap  
Maybe so but here I go  
Lettin my heart lead me  
He thinks I hung the moon and the stars  
I think hes a livin dream  
Well there are men  
But ones like him  
Are few and far between  
  
Chorus
