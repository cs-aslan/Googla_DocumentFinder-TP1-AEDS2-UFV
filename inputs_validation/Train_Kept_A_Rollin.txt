Well on a train I met a dame  
She rather handsome we kinda looked the same  
She was pretty from New York City  
Im walkin down that old fair lane  
Im in heat Im in love  
But I just couldnt tell her so  
I said train kept arollin all night long  
Train kept arollin all night long  
Train kept arollin all night long  
Train kept arollin all night long  
With a heave and a ho  
But I just couldnt tell her so no no no  
Well get along sweet little woman get along  
On your way get along sweet little woman get along  
On your way  
Im in heat Im in love  
But I just couldnt tell her so no no no

Well we made a stop in Albequerque  
She musta thought I was a real cool jerk  
Got off the train and put her hands up  
Lookin so good I couldnt let her go  
But I just couldnt tell her so
