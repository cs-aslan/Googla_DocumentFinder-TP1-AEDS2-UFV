My numbers up  
My time has come  
Sounds like theyre playing my song  
On the altar  
My picture  
Will be there while Im gone  
Therell be time for laughing  
There is no time to cry  
Soon I will be leaving  
Look me in the eye  
No matter whats in front of me  
Its your face that Ill see  
And the future of our young one  
And this is what fuels me  
Theres no time for laughing  
Theres no time to cry  
Soon I will be leaving  
Look me in the eye  
The oath I took  
Not so seriously  
The worlds gathered steam  
And caught up with me  
And my decisions been made  
Some other place  
By someone I dont know  
And they dont know me  
This is no time for laughing  
Theres no time to cry  
Soon I will be leaving  
Look me in the eye
