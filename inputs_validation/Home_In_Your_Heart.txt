Dont you know I got to find me a home  
Right now in your heart  
  
Ill travel over miles and down the highways babe  
Through the valleys every byway  
Just to find me a home right now in your heart  
  
Ill bring you to the music refueling  
Everything you want to  
Everything you need babe  
Just to have me a home right now in your heart  
  
Baby Ill travel for you over miles and  
Through the valley babe  
Down all the highways  
Through the valleys honey  
Just to find me a home right now in your heart  
  
I gotta gotta gotta have it baby  
Gotta find me a home  
Ive got to have a big beautiful home  
Somewhere in your heart
