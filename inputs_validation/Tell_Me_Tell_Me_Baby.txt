Oh oh  
Hold on  
Ah you know what  
Can we back it up just a little bit  
Rewinding noises various vocal sounds  
  
I said why  
I said why why  
Tell me tell me tell me tell me  
Oh oh yeah  
We were born the same day  
We even think the same way  
It couldnt be more right  
We are what they call a perfect match  
Its something that you cant touch  
Down to the last bone youre my baby  
But to be honest  
Theres just one thing  
A part that is missin  
You dont seem to care at all  
  
Tell me tell me baby  
How come you dont wanna love me  
Dont you know that I cant breathe without you  
Tell me tell me just how  
What am I supposed to do right now  
Why cant you love me  
Whyy tell me my baby  
  
Now from the moment we met  
I thought that I was all set  
How could I be so wrong  
Now Im hearing that youre seeing someone new  
And I wanna know who  
But does he love you love like I do  
Youre my baby  
But I promise you this one thing  
Whatever thats missing  
I will make it up to you  
So tell me baby  
  
Tell me tell me baby  
How come you dont wanna love me  
Dont you know that I cant breathe without you  
Tell me tell me just how  
What am I supposed to do right now  
Why cant you love me  
Whyy tell me my baby  
  
Youre getting under my skin  
Youre messing up with my mind  
Youre never letting me into your life  
Tell me baby how come you dont you wanna love me  
And am I supposed to live without  
If there is no way to make you feel the same way too  
Oh you  
  
Tell me tell me tell me tell me  
  
We were born the same day  
We even think the same way  
We are what they all call a perfect match  
Tell me baby  
  
How come you dont wanna love me  
Dont you know that I cant breathe without you  
Tell me tell me just how  
What am I supposed to do right now  
Why cant you love me  
  
Tell me baby

How come you dont wanna love me  
Dont you know that I cant breathe without you
