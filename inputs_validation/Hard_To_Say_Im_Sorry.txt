Everybody needs a little time away  
I heard her say  
From each other  
Even lovers need a holiday  
Far away from each other  
Hold me now  
Its hard for me to say Im sorry  
I just want you to stay  
  
After all that weve been through  
I will make it up to you  
I promise to  
And after all thats been said and done  
Youre just a part of me I cant let go  
  
Couldnt stand to be kept away  
Just for the day  
From your body  
Wouldnt want to be swept away  
Far away from the one that I love  
  
Hold me now  
Its hard for me to say Im sorry  
I just want you to know  
  
Hold me now  
I really want to tell you Im sorry  
I could never let you go  
After all that weve been through  
I will make it up to you  
I promise to  
  
And after all thats been said and done  
Youre just a part of me I cant let go  
After all that weve been through  
I will make it up to you  
I promise to  
  
And after all thats been said and done  
Youre just a part of me I cant let go  
  
Youre gonna be the lucky one  
  
Everybody needs a little time away  
I heard her say
