The joint was jumping on the corner down on Honky Tonk Street  
All of a sudden up pulled a Cadillac and out stepped a can named Pete  
A diamond on every finger he wore he wore a tailor made suit  
Black cigar he wore a Stetson hat  
He wore a pair on cowboy boots  
Busted on through the door mad as he could be  
Dont mess around Ill cut you down cause my name is Big Boy Pete  
The music stopped there wasnt a sound  
Up in the corner stood Bad Man Brown  
He smiled and grinned he said you know my friend  
Take two steps further Im going kick you in the hide  
FortyFive keep it alive seven bullets on my side  
Brown pulled a knife jumped on Pete  
Fought from the counter right on out to the street  
They swung from the north swung from the south  
Pete got the blackjack out  
Brown went out his mind yes he did now we deeply see  
If youre ever down on the corner down on Honky Tonk Street  
Dont mess around hell cut you down  
Take a lesson from Big Boy Pete
