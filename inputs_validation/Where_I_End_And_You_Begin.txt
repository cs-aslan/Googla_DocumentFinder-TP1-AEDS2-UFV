Theres a gap in between  
Theres a gap where we meet  
Where I end and you begin  
  
And Im sorry for us  
The dinosaurs roam the earth  
The sky turns green  
Where I end and you begin  
4 5 6 7  
  
I am up in the clouds  
I am up in the clouds  
And I cant and I cant come down  
  
I can watch and not take part  
Where I end and where you start  
Where you you left me alone  
You left me alone  
  
X will mark the place  
Like the parting of the waves  
Like a house falling in the sea  
In the sea  
  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
  
And therell be no more lies  
Therell be no more lies  
Therell be no more lies  
Therell be no more lies  
  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
  
And therell be no more lies  
Therell be no more lies  
Therell be no more lies  
Therell be no more lies  
  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
  
And therell be no more lies  
Therell be no more lies  
Therell be no more lies  
Therell be no more lies  
  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive
