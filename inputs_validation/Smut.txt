I do have a cause though it is obscenity Im for it laughter Thank you  
Unfortunately the civil liberties types who are fighting this issue have to
fight it  
Owing to the nature of the laws  
As a matter of freedom of speech and stifling of free expression and so on  
  
But we know whats really involved dirty books are fun  
Thats all there is to it  
But you cant get up in a court and say that  
I suppose  
  
Its simply a matter of freedom of pleasure  
a right which is not guaranteed by the Constitution unfortunately  
Anyway since people seem to be marching for their causes these days  
I have here a march for mine Its called  
  
Smut  
Give me smut and nothing but  
A dirty novel I cant shut  
If its uncut  
And unsubtle  
  
Ive never quibbled  
If it was ribald  
I would devour  
Where others merely nibbled  
  
As the judge remarked the day that he acquitted my Aunt Hortense  
To be smut  
It must be ut  
Terly without redeeming social importance  
  
Por  
Nographic pictures I adore  
Indecent magazines galore  
I like them more  
If theyre hardcore  
  
Bring on the obscene movies murals postcards neckties samplers stained  
Glass windows tattoos anything  
More more Im still not satisfied  
  
Stories of tortures  
Used by debauchers  
Lurid licentious and vile  
Make me smile  
  
Novels that pander  
To my taste for candor  
Give me a pleasure sublime  
Lets face it I love slime  
  
Old books can be indecent books  
Though recent books are bolder  
For filth Im glad to say  
Is in the mind of the beholder  
  
When correctly viewed  
Everything is lewd  
I could tell you things about Peter Pan  
And the Wizard of Oz  theres a dirty old man  
  
I thrill  
To any book like Fanny Hill  
And I suppose I always will  
If it is swill  
And really filthy  
  
Who needs a hobby like tennis or philately  
Ive got a hobby rereading Lady Chatterley  
But now theyre trying to take it all away from us unless  
We take a stand and hand in hand we fight for freedom of the press  
  
In other words Smut I love it  
Ah the adventures of a slut  
Oh Im a market they cant glut  
I dont know what  
Compares with smut  
Hip hip hooray  
Lets hear it for the Supreme Court  
Dont let them take it away
