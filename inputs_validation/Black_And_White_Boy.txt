Black and white boy  
Black and white boy  
Youre so extreme  
Youre so confused  
Color me in whatever mood Im in  
I could be still in touch with you  
And youre full of the wonder of spring  
Its all sweetness and lightness you bring  
And a room full of people fall to your infinite charm  
But when darkness should quickly descend  
You go quietly my miserable friend  
To the depths of despair you will crawl  
Black and white boy  
  
Black and white boy  
Black and white boy  
Youre so extreme  
Youre so confused  
Color me in  
Whatever mood Im in  
I could be still  
In touch with you  
  
When you shake off the shadows of night  
And your eyes are so clear and so bright  
Youll make fools of the liars and creeps  
Put a rose in my cheeks  
But when demons have climbed on your back  
You are vicious and quick to attack  
And you put on a wonderful show  
Do you really really think I dont know  
Black and white boy  
  
And you run like a cat to the cream  
And youre acting so nice its obscene  
You put on a wonderful show  
Do you really really think I dont know  
Black and white boy
