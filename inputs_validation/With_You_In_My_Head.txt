You keepin on a holdin  
A holdin on a keepin  
No giving into taking more but still still feedin  
You keepin on a holdin  
Aholdin on akeepin  
No giving into taking more but still still feedin  
Youre clearly disturbed  
All you want is allegiance  
Hear them what you saw  
You hear them what you saw  
You hear them what you saw  
You hear them with believin  
Oh holy holy water washing over the soul  
  
Collecting all the people you love to sing you a song  
Even if they stick to humming  
Holding on a song to see them  
When youre really sicka sicka sick of love  
Leaving with their heart  
To shape them within  
Even if they stay to running  
Hold em on the soul believing  
Till you wanna sticka sticka stick to love  
  
When you went down the men came callin  
Changing to stone as you wept from fallin  
When you went down the men came callin  
Speaking in tongues weve all been summoned  
Ride you wait to hug the shoal you hate the thought youre soso  
You seem so dark to cry  
  
Oh were ready honey  
I got all the skills  
Youve given all our love for you  
Everything you taught me honey  
It never even mattered really  
Its all about my love for you  
  
With you in my head  
With you in my head  
With you in my head  
  
When you went down the men came callin  
Faded in stone as you wept from fallin  
When you went down the men came callin  
Singing in tongues it makes things summoned  
  
Oh were ready honey  
I got all the skills  
Youve given all our love for you  
Everything you taught me honey  
It never even mattered really  
Its all about my love for you  
  
I hope that Im ready honey  
I got all the skills  
Youve given all our love for you  
Everything you taught me honey  
It never even mattered really  
Its all about my love for you
