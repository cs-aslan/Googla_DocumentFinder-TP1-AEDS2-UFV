Because its real you think its a joke  
Because its on your doorstep you have to have a poke  
At someone  
Its only a cliche because its all true  
Time after time it happens through and through  
To a new generation  
  
Youre just so smug in your elected seat  
Youve got your papers sorted out but you cant find your feet  
Well Im not surprised  
  
Hey mister with your head in the clouds  
You cant see further than the shillings and pounds  
The things that you say dont mean nothing anymore  
You have no control theyve broken down all the doors  
And the only way that youll fix them up  
Is another war  
  
If you think Im gonna die in a financial war  
Youve got another thing coming and  
And whats more theres lots like me  
  
You juggle lives around with the stroke of a pen  
But weve paid to see that move and now we wont pay again  
The cost is too high  
  
Hey mister your smiles been erased  
You cant understand why were losing face  
Perhaps its the promises that you never kept
