Do you wanna wind up in a graveyard  
Like a number on a scorecard  
Theyre gonna wrap you up in corn silk  
Theyre gonna cry like you were spilled milk  
Youd better take another Quaalude  
And get yourself corkscrewed  
I understand that you got cold feet  
Whyd you have to take em down a side street  
I must be dumber than a spit curl  
Cause I got hung up on a showgirl  
Now I look like Im a scarecrow  
I might as well go on a talk show  
And this aint a home anymore  
Well its just four walls and a floor  
Home is where you get the girls for free  
This is just the house that used to be  
Oh the house that used to be  
Do you wanna wind up in a graveyard  
Just another girl who costarred  
Theyre gonna wrap you up in corn silks  
Theyre gonna cry like you were spilled milk  
And in the far off wail of freight trains  
And in the lonely howl of great danes  
I hear the girl I lost forever  
I hear the girl I lost forever  
And this aint a home anymore  
Well its just four walls and a floor  
Home is where you get the girls for free  
This is just the house that used to be  
Oh the house that used to be
