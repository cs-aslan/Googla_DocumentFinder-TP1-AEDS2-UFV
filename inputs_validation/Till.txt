You are my reason to live  
All I own I would give  
Just to have you adore me  
  
Till the moon deserts the sky  
Till the all the seas run dry  
Till then Ill worship you  
Till the tropic sun turns cold  
Till this young world grows old  
My darling Ill adore you  
  
You are my reason to live  
All I own I would give  
Just to have you adore me  
  
Till the rivers flow upstream  
Till lovers cease to dream  
Til then Im yours be mine
