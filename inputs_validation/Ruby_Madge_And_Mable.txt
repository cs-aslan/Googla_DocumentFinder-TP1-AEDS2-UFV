Sometimes true love has to choose to do what it dont want to do  
And sometimes patience has to give up a hanging on  
Darling Ill be far away and youll be wishing I had stayed  
After Ruby Madge And Mable send you home  
After Ruby settled down and Madge moved back to her hometown  
After Mable says youre fool leave me alone  
Youll find out how much it hurts and just how much a dream is worth  
After Ruby Madge And Mable send you home  
 piano   
Youll find out what lonely mean but you wont find the broken chain  
That once bound our love together proud and strong  
You start talking to the walls and count every tear that falls  
After Ruby Madge And Mable send you home  
After Ruby settled down
