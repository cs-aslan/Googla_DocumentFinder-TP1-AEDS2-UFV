Some fools dont know whats right from wrong  
But somehow those folks belong  
Me I try for all Im worth  
But I still remain a stranger on this earth  
  
Some people gloom other folk cry  
Me I have to struggle to keep alive  
Ever since the day of my birth  
Ive been a stranger stranger on this earth  
  
I try to be what all folks should  
Forgetting the bad and doing good  
But no matter how I try  
My troubles always multiply  
  
Now Ive been doing the best I can  
Ever since life began  
Some day when I prove my worth  
I wont be a stranger on earth  
  
Now Ive been living the best I can  
Ever since my life began  
The days gonna come when I prove my worth  
And I wont be no stranger  
No I wont be a stranger  
On this earth
