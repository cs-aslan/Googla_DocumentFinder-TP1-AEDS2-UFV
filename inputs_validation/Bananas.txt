Chorus x2  
Who you gonna call when its time to brawl  
Standin round waitin for my queendom to fall  
Well I think not styles are pipin hot  
Blazin amazin I give it all I got  
  
Im tellin you straight up all sleepin beauties better wake up  
Ill tear your state up so set the date up  
And Im a rip it what if it what was it  
Who did it who does it  
From private to public  
Anywhere Im in there and been there  
So recognize this who the nicest  
Sit down and settle for your constellation prizes  
Whatever you want I got  
Whether you ready or not  
Its about to get hot when I drop  
So notes pause another spot  
To do you dont get me in a corner make me do you  
Dont try to be me do you  
Be coo to you and do you  
Im on a higher level with different class another plane  
I am the queen thats my name time to explain  
That I spit game with dames  
Leave em all with shit stains  
Split frames hopin you hopin that Im jokin  
Dont know but still blink off like forfos  
But soso slow mos comin in like the popos  
Dont want rocks comin at me the wrong way  
Packin much rocks its gonna be a long day  
And for real spittin on imbessiles and spinnin wheels  
On my 600 you want it you must be blunted  
Ill take it to your stomach run it give me all  
Mic for mic steppin to me you gonna fall we brawl  
Throwin a twopiece so loose leafs  
Its the qyoudoubleen  
You know how Im mcin  
  
Chorus x2  
  
See physically you not ready  
Lyrically you not ready  
Mentally maybe  
Who talks tough time to get the baby  
No threats or small bets on my bond we can get it on  
From dusk til dawn from night til mourn  
Some bubble hard squads are gone no gimmicks no tricks  
Til one of us admits its a battle a whisk  
So look Im off the hook while you off the rocker  
Thinkin Im shook get the phone book call the doctor  
Are you out of your mind doubtin mines out of line  
Talkin out your behind shoutin rhymes out of time  
Its all over whats up yeah what what now you tough now  
Now you hush hush now aint sayin too much now  
Thought so haunt yo sleepin ass creepin fast  
Like you was doin somethin now I gotta ruin somethin  
You image your career lookie here you whole life is hangin in the air  
Like a chandilier poppin off like a can of beer understand is it clear  
If not let me put it in your ear that Im royalty  
Even though Im lowkey you know me  
You be singin over my tracks like its kareoke  
If you dont know the half you gon feel the wrath  
Represent the rugged path the flavor unit staff  
Droppin mathmatics layin you out like craftmatic  
Ill let you have it so you dont want the static
