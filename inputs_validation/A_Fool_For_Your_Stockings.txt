Is it you again outside  
Just banging on the front door  
You say you had enough  
Now youre comin back for more  
But thats alright  
I said that Thats alright  
I may not want to admit it  
Im just a fool for your stockings I believe  
Now I dont mind when you send money  
And bring your girlfriends with you  
But how could one be so thoughtless to try  
And handle less than two  
But thats alright  
I said that Thats alright baby  
I may not want to admit it  
Im just a fool for your stockings I believe yea  
Now Im tellin everybody  
It seems too good to be true  
Sweet things can always get sweeter  
I know mine did how about you  
Yes its alright  
I said Yes it yes it is thats alright  
I may not want to admit it  
Im just a fool for your stockings I believe  
Admit it
