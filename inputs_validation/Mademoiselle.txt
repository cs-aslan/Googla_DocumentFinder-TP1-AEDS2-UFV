Tell me where are you going  
Sweet mademoiselle  
To London or Paris  
To the Grand Hotel  
  
Where do you go at the end of the day  
Where do you go when you spend time away  
To islands in the tropic sands  
Or pleasure trips to distant lands  
Youre searching for a dream  
Well maybe its me  
  
I tell you hello  
And what do you say  
As I stop you go  
Theres no reason to stay  
  
It all began so harmlessly  
You gave me love so easily  
I never realized you were just spending time  
  
Tell me where are you going  
Sweet mademoiselle  
To London or Paris  
To the Grand Hotel  
  
Even though youre far away  
I think about you every day  
And wonder if youre thinking of me  
In a fond memory  
Sweet mademoiselle  
  
Tell me where are you going  
Sweet mademoiselle  
To London or Paris  
Ou Montreal  
Sweet Mademoiselle
