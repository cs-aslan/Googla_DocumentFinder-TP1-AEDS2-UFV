Chorus  
This is how we roll  
We stay in the street  
And get it all week cause  
This is how we roll  
We gotta get out  
Cant stay in the house cause  
The party dont end  
Every weekend  
Turn up baby burn up  
Again and again  
This is how we roll  
We rollin we rollin we rollin  
  
Verse 1  
Everybody in the party  
If you came here to party  
Better move your body  
Damn look at that body  
Everybody in here  
Put your hands in the air  
Wave em like you dont care  
Let me hear you say yeah  
  
PreChorus  
This place is jumpin  
We keep it bumpin  
The boys keep watchin  
Wanna leave with something  
We makin it clap  
Clap clap clap clap  
We dont need hands for that  
That that that that  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 2  
Get wild and crazy

All the boys over there  
Keep lookin over here  
But we dont care  
  
PreChorus  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
Pull your camera out  
Cause someones gonna wanna see this  
Take a picture snap it  
Aye post it for the world
