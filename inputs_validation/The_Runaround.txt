But you been sleepin and youre creepin babe  
But you been creepin and youre sleepin baby  
  
Its Friday night and Ive been freakin out  
900 times I know I called your house  
So many times your momma cursed me out  
But Im not sorry  
  
Saturday morning I aint slept at all  
I smelled her perfume and your alcohol  
They say that you and her have had a ball  
Dont you dare lie to me  
  
Chorus x2  
I know Im gettin the runaround  
I know that you sleep around  
So dont try and play it down  
I know youre givin it I know shes gettin it  
  
I grabbed my keys and I jumped in my ride  
I may be hurt but I aint gonna cry  
Just want to find out what you did last night  
Before I leave you  
  
I found her number and I know her name  
I gotta front this girl make her explain  
I cant believe she dipped into my thing  
Yet shes getting over  
  
Chorus  
  
It took a lot for me to give you all my loving yeah  
And just to think I gave you everything for nothing  
I tried my best to satisfy you  
All the times that I stood right by you  
I think that Ill be better on my own baby  
  
Oh baby  
I know your givin it I know shes gettin it  
  
But you been sleepin and youre creepin babe  
But you been creepin and youre sleepin baby  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Now I cant believe that you did this to me  
Well you better leave  
You go tell whats her name that it isnt a game  
Boy you messed up your thang
