Ive got the village I love  dig everything  
I walk along beside the garbagemen and I dig everything  dig everything  
I wave to the policemen but they dont wave back  
They dont dig anything  dig everything  
Aint had a job for a year or more and I dont know a thing  dig everything  
Everythings spent and I dig everything  
Everythings spent and I dig everything  
Dig  
I feed the lions in trafalgar square and I dig everything  dig everything  
Ive sit just behind my window till my cigarettes were low and dug  
Everything dig everything  
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and I dig everything  dig

Id see people in the street below who dont know where theyre going  
They dont dig anything  dig everything  
Everythings spent and I dig everything  
Everythings spent and I dig everything  
Dig  
Ive got more friends than I had out for dinners  
Some of them were losers but the rest of them are winners

Holy low on money their intentions are tall  
We smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything  
Dig
