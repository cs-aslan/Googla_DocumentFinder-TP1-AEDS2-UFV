Have you ever been down to Texas  
Down around San Antone  
They love to go all night and treat you right  
And party till the cows come home  
  
I love it when the let their hair down  
And dance real close to you  
You know Im a sucker baby for what the cowgirls do  
What the cowgirls do  
  
They aint no different up in Oklahoma  
They aint afraid to stay up til dawn  
They love to cut a run and chug a lug  
Longnecks til their moneys all gone  
  
I love it when the let their hair down  
And dance real close to you  
You know Im a sucker baby for what the cowgirls do  
What the cowgirls do  
  
Theres cowgirls all across the country  
From Baton Rouge to Bangor Maine  
It aint hard to see theyll be the death of me  
Theyre gonna drive my little heart insane  
  
I love it when the let their hair down  
And dance real close to you  
You know Im a sucker baby for what the cowgirls do  
What the cowgirls do
