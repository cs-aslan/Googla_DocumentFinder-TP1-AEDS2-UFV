Do you believe in heaven above  
Do you believe in love  
Dont tell me a lie  
Dont be false or untrue  
It all comes back to you  
  
Open fire on my burning heart  
Ive never been lucky in love  
My defenses are down  
A kiss or a frown  
I cant survive on my own  
  
If a girl walks in  
And carves her name in my heart  
Ill turn and run away  
Everyday weve all been led astray  
  
Its hard to be lucky in love  
  
It gets in your eyes  
Its making you cry  
Dont know what to do  
Dont know what to do  
Looking for love  
Calling heaven above  
  
Send me an angel  
Send me an angel  
Right now right now  
  
Empty dreams can only disappoint  
In a room behind your smile  
But dont give up dont give up  
You can be lucky in love
