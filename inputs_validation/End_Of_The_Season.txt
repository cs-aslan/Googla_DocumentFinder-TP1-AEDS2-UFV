Winter time is coming  
All the sky is grey  
Summer birds arent singing  
Since you went away  
Since youve been gone end of the season  
Winter is here close of play  
I get no kicks walking down Saville Row  
Theres no more chicks left where the green grass grows and I know that  
Winter is here end of the season  
My reasons gone close of play  
I just cant mix in all the clubs I know  
Now Labors in I have no place to go  
Youre on a yacht near an island in Greece  
Though you are hot forget me not  
I will keep waiting until your return  
Now you are gone end of the season  
Winter will come any day  
Back in the scrum on a wet afternoon  
Down in the mud dreaming of flowers in June  
End of the season  
End of the season
