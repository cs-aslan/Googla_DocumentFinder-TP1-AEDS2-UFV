I can almost hear you sigh  
I can almost hear you cry  
On every crowded street  
All the places we would meet  
  
What will I do without ya  
They say that life goes on  
Im feeling sorry for myself  
I cant believe youre gone  
  
And you acted much too calm  
You turned on all the charm  
You had a cold look in your eyes  
  
I can feel your tongue on mine  
Silky smooth like wine  
Im living with these memories  
Thats all thats left of you and me  
  
I can almost hear you sigh  
Almost hear you cry  
When you made sweet love to me  
And you turned on all the charm  
Acted much too calm  
You had a cold look in your eyes  
  
Did it mean nothing  
Was it all in vain  
Was I just your fool  
Or was the pleasure pain  
  
Have you set me free  
Or will I wake up  
In the morning  
And find out its been a bad dream  
  
Come on I beg you  
I want to be your main man  
  
I can almost hear you sigh  
Almost hear you cry  
When you make sweet love to me  
Almost see your smile  
It stretched half a mile  
You had a stone cold look in your eyes
