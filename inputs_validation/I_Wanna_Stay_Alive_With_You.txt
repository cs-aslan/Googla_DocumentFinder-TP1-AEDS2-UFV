Im not one to judge that much  
And anyway I just wanna get high on you  
But thirteen year old girls in hotels on the other side of the world  
Seems a little much for me  
  
Yeah I wanna stay alive with you  
  
But they look you in the eye  
And anyway theyll always slip a smile at you  
But thirteen year old girls in ratholes on the other side of the world  
Theyre gonna lie to you  
  
Yeah I wanna stay alive with you  
  
Freeruns in a town where the boys and girls are settling down for the night  
To make up and make eyes at you  
  
Yeah I wanna stay alive with you
