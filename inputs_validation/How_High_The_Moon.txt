Somewhere theres music  
How faint the tune  
Somewhere theres heaven  
How high the moon  
There is no moon above when love is far away  
Too  
  
Till it comes true that you love me as I love you  
Somewhere theres music  
Its where you are  
  
Somewhere theres heaven  
How near  
How far  
The brightest night would shine if you would come to me soon  
  
Until you will  
How still my aching heart  
How high the moon  
  
Somewhere theres music  
Its where you are  
  
Somewhere theres music  
Music in the air  
Oh  
I love this heaven when youre near  
I want to hear the music  
I want to be where you are
