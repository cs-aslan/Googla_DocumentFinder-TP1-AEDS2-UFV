Its not unusual to be loved by anyone  
Its not unusual to have fun with anyone  
But when I see you hanging about with anyone  
Its not unusual to see me cry  
Oh I wanna die  
  
Its not unusual to go out at any time  
But when I see you out and about its such a crime  
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone  
Its not unusual  
  
It happens every day  
No matter what you say  
  
You find it happens all the time  
Love will never do what you want it to  
Why cant this crazy love be mine  
  
Its not unusual to be mad with anyone  
Its not unusual to be sad with anyone  
But if I ever find that youve changed at anytime  
Its not unusual to find out that Im in love with you  
Whoaohohohoh
