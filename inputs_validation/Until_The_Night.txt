I never ask you where you go  
After I leave you in the morning  
We go our different ways to separate situations  
Its not that easy anymore  
Today I do what must be done  
I give my time to total strangers  
But now it feels as though the day goes on forever  
MOre than it ever did before  
CHORUS  
Until the night until the night  
I just might make it  
Until the night until the night  
When I see you again  
Now youre afraid that we have changed  
And Im afraid were getting older  
So many broken hearts so many lonely faces  
So many lovers come and gone  
Ill have my fears like every man  
Youll have your tears like every woman  
Today well be unsure is this what we believe in  
And wonder how can we go on  
CHORUS  
When the sun goes down  
And the day is over  
When the last of the light has gone  
As they pour into the street  
I will be getting closer  
As the cars turn their headlights on  
While theyre closing it down  
Were gonna open it up  
And while theyre going to sleep  
Well just be starting to touch  
Im just beginning to feel  
Im just beginning to give  
Im just beginning to feel  
Im just beginning to live  
Before I leave you again  
Before the light of the dawn  
Before this evening can end  
I have been waiting so long  
CHORUS
