Those boon times went bust  
My feet of clay theyve dried to dust  
The red isnt the red we painted  
Its Just Rust  
That signature thing that used to bring a following  
I have trouble now even remembering  
  
So why did I kiss him so hard late last friday night  
And keep on letting him change all my plans  
Im either so sick in the head  
I need to be bled dry to quit  
Or I just really used to love him  
I sure hope thats it  
  
I knew that to keep in touch would do me deep in dutch  
Cause it isnt the rush of remembering its just mush  
And that signature thing is only growing harrowing  
I should have no trouble now to keep from following  
  
So why did I kiss him so hard late last friday night  
And keep on letting him change all my plans  
Im either so sick in the head  
I need to be bled dry to quit  
Or I just really used to love him  
I sure hope thats it
