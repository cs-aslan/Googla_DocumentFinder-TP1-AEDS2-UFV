Chorus x2  
Oh  
Girl you better oh  
StStop playin oh  
Bitch whatcha waitin for  
Get your ass on the floor  
  
You know the night was good  
When you wake up in the morning  
With a cloudy piss  
You know how I do  
Gimme the vodka skip the cris  
Im at the bar feelin like 50 takin like 9 shots  
I got like 9 broads takin em with me why stop  
Now Im bouncin from broad to broad  
This thing is thick from wall to wall  
Ive never read the book  
But its like I mastered the art of war  
So if anybody thinks they can take advantage  
cause Ive had a couple of drinks think again  
Ill have you like kanye west  
With a brand new jaw and a metal chin  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Excuse me Im takin over  
Im sick like Ebola  
I dont know what they told ya  
But bitch this chicos a soldier  
Get the crip and roll up  
Or drop the E and roll out  
Most of these bustas fold up  
When its time to thug out  
Im a take it to the club  
Where them freaks be takin it off and backin it up  
Im a make ya so hot as soon as these mamis walk in they ready to fuck  
Every every body body listen listen closely  
cause imma do whats never been done  
The games been fucked but its never been sprung  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Oh oh oh  
Get your ass on the floor  
Oh oh  
Get your ass on the floor  
Oh oh  
Get your ass on the floor  
Oh oh oh  
Get your ass on the floor  
  
Oh

StStop playin oh  
Bitch whatcha waitin for  
Get your ass on the floor  
Get your ass on the floor
