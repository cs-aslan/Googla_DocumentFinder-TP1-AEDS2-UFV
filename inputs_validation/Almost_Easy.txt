Pick it up dont put it down  
Do you recognize the feeling that Im passing around  
Like your all lit up feet on the floor  
Everywhere you go feel like youve been there before  
  
Its almost easy  
To believe this is how it could be  
Just to easy  
To see it could happen to me  
  
What a feeling when it takes control of you  
Everything you need is back ten fold  
Like a feeling do it comes and goes  
Then its gone  
  
Oh no  
  
Then the rain came knocked me sideways  
Hope the wind will break my fall  
I know we all deserve a couple scars  
Its just getting old  
  
When the rain just knocked me sideways  
I dont know what I dont know  
I know we all deserve a couple scars  
Its just getting old  
  
Damn its getting old  
  
Im all locked up I mean I did it again  
Couldnt recognize the feeling that you tried to fit in  
So I might kick back  
I think Im taking my time  
Underneath the sun without a cloud in the sky  
  
Its almost easy  
Its got to easy  
To see it could happen to me  
  
What a feeling when it takes control of you  
Everything you need is back ten fold  
But like a feeling do it comes and goes then its  
Gone  
  
Oh no  
  
Then the rain came knocked me sideways  
Hope the wind will break my fall  
I know we all deserve a couple scars  
Its just getting old  
  
When the rain just falls on Sunday  
I dont know what I dont know  
Spend my days looking down a highway  
Its just getting old  
Damn its getting old  
  
You told me youd break my heart  
Sounds like something you say  
When you knew it from the start  
And it didnt matter anyway  
  
You told me youd break my heart  
I didnt believe you then  
So why would I hear you now  
Youre undecided  
  
I know the rain may knock you sideways  
Hope the wind will break your fall  
I know we all deserve a couple scars  
Damn its getting old  
  
When the rain just falls on Sunday  
I dont know what I dont know  
Spend my life looking down a highway  
Now its getting old  
  
When the rain just knocks you sideways  
Ive been lost since I dont know  
I know we all deserve a couple scars  
Its just getting old  
  
Oh how it gets old  
Damn its getting old
