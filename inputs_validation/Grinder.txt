Never straight and narrow  
I wont keep in time  
Tend to burn the arrow  
Out of the line  
  
Been inclined to wander  
Off the beaten track  
Thats where theres thunder  
And the wind shouts back  
  
Grinder  
Looking for meat  
Grinder  
Wants you to eat  
  
Got no use for routine  
I shiver at the thought  
Open skies are my scene  
Thats why I wont get caught  
  
Refuse to bite the mantrap  
Be led to set the snare  
I love to have my sight  
Capped everywhere

Looking for meat  
Grinder  
Wants you to eat  
  
solo glenn  
  
Ive held my licence  
It came with birth  
For self reliance on this earth  
You take the bullet  
On which my name  
Was etched upon in your game  
  
Day of independence  
Stamped us like a brand  
Round the necks of millions  
To the land  
  
As the mighty eagle  
I need room to breathe  
Witness from the treadmill  
I take my leave  
  
Grinder  
Looking for meat
