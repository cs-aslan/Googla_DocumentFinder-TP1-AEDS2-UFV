Dont mind if I do dont mind if I  
Dont care much at all cant think that much  
Im climbing the walls losing my touch  
You dont give a damn  
  
When you are out there on your own  
Saying you cant find your way home  
Do you think you know what is real  
And do you know what you want from me  
Im being the best that I can be  
Now I know nothing feels the same  
  
Dont mind if I do dont mind if I  
Dont care much at all cant think that much  
Im climbing the walls losing my touch  
Im all in a jam  
I dont lie to you I dont need to  
I wont cry for you I dont feel to  
Dont you cry to me Ive seen through you  
You dont give a damn  
  
Can I be honest with you now  
Im feeling a fool again somehow  
Maybe I should be moving on  
  
Dont mind if I do dont mind if I  
Dont care much at all cant think that much  
Im climbing the walls losing my touch  
Im all in a jam  
I dont lie to you I dont need to  
I wont cry for you I dont feel to  
Dont you cry to me Ive seen through you  
You dont give a damn  
  
Take it or leave it seems to be  
The only way open left for me  
Should I be feeling how I feel  
  
Dont mind if I do dont mind if I  
Dont care much at all cant think that much  
Im climbing the walls losing my touch  
Im all in a jam  
I dont lie to you I dont need to  
I wont cry for you I dont feel to  
Dont you cry to me Ive seen through you  
You dont give a damn
