Maybe the hardest thing Ive ever done  
Was to walk away from you  
Leaving behind the life that wed begun  
I split myself in two  
  
Proud and alone cold as a stone  
Rolling down that hill into the night  
I could see the surprise and the hurt in your eyes  
From behind each flashing city light  
  
Love needs a heart and I need to find  
If loves needs a heart like mine  
  
Love wont come near me she dont even hear me  
She walks past my vacancy sign  
Love needs a heart trusting and blind  
I wish that heart was mine  
  
Proud and alone cold as a stone  
Im afraid to believe the things I feel  
I can cry with the best I can laugh with the rest  
But Im never sure when its real  
And it may be the hardest thing Ive ever done  
But apart from all that I hope to find  
Wheres the heart thats been looking for mine  
I hope it finds me in time  
  
Love needs a heart and I need to find  
If love needs a heart like mine
