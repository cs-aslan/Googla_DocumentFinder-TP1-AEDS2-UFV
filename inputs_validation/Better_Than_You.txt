I look at you then you me  
Hungry and thirsty I wait  
Holding the lions share  
Holding the key  
Holding me back cause Im striving to be  
Better than you better than you  
Better than you better than you  
Lock homes I push and I strive  
Somehow I feel more alive  
Bury the deep forest  
Bury the sea  
Bury me deep when theres no will to be  
Better than you better than you  
Oh better than you better than you  
Oh cant stop this train from rolling  
Oh yo nothing brings me down  
No cant stop this train from rolling on and on on  
No no forever on and on  
Oh cant stop this train from rolling  
Oh yo you cant take it down  
No never stop this locomotion on and on and on  
No no you cant bring me down cause Im  
Better than you better than you  
Better than you better than you  
Oh better than you better than you  
Better than you better than you  
Much better than you  
Better than you better than you  
Oh better than you better than you  
Better than you better than you  
Better than  
Better than  
Better than  
Better than you  
Yeah  
Cant stop this train from rolling  
Forever on and on and on and on and on  
Forever on and on and on  
Better than you  
Yeah  
Haha  
Better than you
