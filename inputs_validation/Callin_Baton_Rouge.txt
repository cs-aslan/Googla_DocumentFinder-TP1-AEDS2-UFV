I spent last night in the arms of a girl in Louisiana  
And though Im out on the highway my thoughts are still with her  
Such a strange combination of a woman and a child  
Such a strange situation stoppin every hundred miles  
Callin Baton Rouge  
  
A replay of last nights events roll through my mind  
Except a scene or two erased by sweet red wine  
And I see a truck stop sign ahead so I change lanes  
I need a cup of coffee and a couple dollars change  
Callin Baton Rouge  
  
Operator wont you put me on through  
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge  
Hurry up wont you put her on the line  
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time  
  
Hello Samantha dear I hope youre feelin fine  
And it wont be long until Im with you all the time  
But until then Ill spend my money up right down to my last dime  
Callin Baton Rouge  
  
Operator wont you put me on through  
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge  
Hurry up wont you put her on the line  
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time  
Callin Baton Rouge  
  
Sweet Baton Rouge
