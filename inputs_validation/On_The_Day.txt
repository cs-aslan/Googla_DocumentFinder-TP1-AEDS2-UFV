Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
You really need someone on your side  
But you run away and hide  
Whenever somebodys gonna get through  
Youve got this wall in front of you  
You put your arm around me and smile  
But youre thinking all the while  
Yeah your friends only go so far  
However close friends think they are  
On the day  
On the day you fall in love  
Gonna pray  
Youre gonna pray that your love is enough  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Youve had the world in the palm of your hand  
Since you turned from child to man  
No one can tell you a thing you dont know  
You see your life as a one man show  
But youre not whole  
There are things you dont control  
Youre gonna know what Im talking about  
On the day love finds you out  
On the day  
On the day you fall in love  
Gonna pray  
You better pray  
Its your life you try to know  
Which way the answers lie which way to go  
Cause you survive dont mean you grow  
Open your eyes look out below look out  
On the day  
On the day you fall in love  
Gonna pray  
You better pray yeah  
On the day  
On the day you fall in love  
Gonna pray  
You better
