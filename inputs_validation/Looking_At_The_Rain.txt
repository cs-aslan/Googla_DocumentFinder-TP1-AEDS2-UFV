Looking at the rain  
Feeling the pain  
Of love lost running though  
My brain  
Looking at the wind  
Watching it spin  
The leaves along the street  
You win  
  
Waiting for a line to fall  
Telling you its all a big mistake  
  
Looking at a face  
So out of place  
Inside that picture frame  
Of lace  
Looking at the wall  
Wishing youd call  
And tell me youre okay  
Thats all  
  
Wishing this was all a dream  
And Id find you sleeping when I wake  
  
Looking at the trees  
So ill at ease  
From sleep that will not come  
Thats me  
Looking at the dawn  
Knowing its wrong  
Still thinking of your love  
Thats gone  
  
Wishing this was all a dream  
And Id find you sleeping when I wake  
  
Looking at the rain  
Feeling the pain  
Of love lost running though  
My brain  
Looking at the wind  
Watching it spin  
The leaves along the street  
You win  
  
Waiting for a line to fall  
Telling you its all a big mistake  
But the words wont come  
I know Id feel the same  
Looking at the rain
