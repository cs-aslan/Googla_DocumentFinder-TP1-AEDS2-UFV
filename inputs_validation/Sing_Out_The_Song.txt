Remember the bar garden  
Glass filled with beer  
Nothing to lose only good times to gain  
A friend to help along  
When the words wouldnt come  
CHORUS  
Sing out the song brother  
Sing it loud and clear  
Then well laugh together  
Like the old days so dear  
The rusty guitar  
Its sound filled the air  
Out of tune choruses  
That didnt sound quite there  
How about the joker  
He got his laugh and then he said  
CHORUS  
The way the things are now  
Its not the same anymore  
And I sometimes wish that  
We could all sit down together  
And sing it all again
