Im patient of this plan  
As humble as I can  
Ill wait another day  
Before I turn away  
But know this much is true  
No matter what I do  
Offend in every way  
I dont know what to say  
  
Im coming through the door  
But theyre expecting more  
Of an interesting man  
Sometimes I think I can  
But how much can I fake  
Ill speak until I break  
With every word I say  
Offend in every way  
  
You tell me to relax  
And listen to these facts  
That everyones my friend  
And will be till the end  
But know this much is true  
No matter what I do  
No matter what I say  
Offend in every way
