Some say money is bad for the soul  
Bad for the rock bad for the roll  
Bad for the heart bad for the brain  
Bad for damn near everything oh  
Yeah

Come on pay the rent  
Telephone telefax telefunkin  
Teletrash  
Tell a cop tell a friend  
Think weve hit the stoney end  
Nothing left nothing right  
Now they want a bigger bite  
Everybody wants some  
Everybody wants big money oh yeah  
They want big fat money  
Thats what I want  
Big fat money  
Too much temptation

Space station starvation premature
