I just dont know what to do with myself  
Dont know just what to do with myself  
Im so used to doing everything with you  
Planning everything for two  
And now that were through  
I just dont know what to do with my time  
Im so lonesome for you its a crime  
Going to a movie only makes me sad  
Parties make me feel as bad  
When Im not with you  
I just dont know what to do  
Like a summer rose needs the sun and rain  
I need your sweet love to ease all the pain  
I dont know just what to do with myself  
I dont know just what to do with myself  
Baby if your new love ever turns you down  
Come back I will be around  
Just waiting for you  
I dont know what else to do  
Like a summer rose needs the sun and rain  
I need your sweet love to ease all the pain  
I dont know just what to do with myself  
I dont know just what to do with myself  
Baby if your new love ever turns you down  
Come on back I will be around  
Just waiting for you  
I dont know what else to do  
No no no  
I dont know what else to do  
Im just so crazy for you  
No no no no  
I dont know what else to do  
I dont know what else to do
