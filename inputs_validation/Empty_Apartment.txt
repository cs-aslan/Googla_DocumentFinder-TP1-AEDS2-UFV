Call me out  
You stayed inside  
One you love  
Is where you hide  
Shot me down  
As I flew by  
Crash and burn  
I think sometimes  
You forget where the heart is  
Answer no  
To these questions  
Let her go  
Learn a lesson  
Its not me  
Youre not listening now  
Cant you see  
Somethings missing  
You forget where the heart is  
  
Take you away  
From that empty apartment  
You stay  
And forget where the heart is  
Someday  
If ever you loved me  
Youd say  
Its okay  
  
Waking up  
From this nightmare  
Hows youre life  
Whats it like there  
Is it all  
That you want it to be  
Does it hurt  
When you think about me  
And how broken my heart is  
  
Take you away  
From that empty apartment  
You stay  
And forget where the heart is  
Someday  
If ever you loved me  
Youd say its okay  
  
Its okay to be angry and never let go  
It only gets harder the more that you know  
When you get lonely if no ones around  
You know that Ill catch you when youre falling down  
We came together but you left alone  
And I know how it feels to walk out on your own  
Maybe someday I will see you again  
And youll look me in my eyes and call me your friend  
  
Take you away from  
That empty apartment  
You stay and forget where the heart is  
Someday  
If ever you loved me  
Youd say its okay  
Its okay its okay
