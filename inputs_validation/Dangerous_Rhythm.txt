Chorus  
Dangerous rhythm  
Dangerous rhythm  
Dangerous rhythm in the air  
  
Stranger to stranger  
Were both dressed for danger  
Something is generating here  
  
Oh take off your halo  
For the allnight inferno  
Something is happening in the air  
  
Its not like anything Ive ever known before  
And I dont care  
  
Chorus  
  
Surging and merging  
Urgent and urging  
Soft as a footstep on the stair  
  
The red light is on now  
My gravitys gone and how  
I can feel something in the air  
  
Its not like anything Ive ever known before  
And I dont care  
  
Chorus x2
