I took him for granted  
Now looking back at it  
Hes not the only one to blame  
Between the jobs and the kids  
Wasnt much time for him  
We let the fire slip away from the flame  
  
Guess I shouldnt be surprised  
But as hard as I try  
I cant believe its happened to me  
But I know where hes at  
And I know its a fact  
Id have to be blind not to see  
  
Chorus  
Hes out buying her roses  
And where that leaves me God only knows  
I know I should tell him  
To leave me forever  
But whatll I do if he goes  
  
Should I put up a fight  
Does it matter whos right  
Should I ruin my life or my pride  
Can we save what we had  
And if he comes back  
Will I ever get it out of my mind  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Whatll I do if he goes  
Whatll I do if he goes
