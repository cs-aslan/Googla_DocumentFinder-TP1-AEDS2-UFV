Go on  
Hes romancing you  
And chancing his arm  
Hell be here  
Smiling on time  
Hes romancing you  
And chancing his arm  
Hell be here  
Smiling on time  
Roys keen oh Roys keen  
Roys keen oh Roys keen  
Weve never seen a  
Keener windowcleaner  
Back up the ladder  
Into each corner  
Dunking the chamois  
Just think of the goodwill  
The ladders a planet  
Roy is a star and  
I am a satellite  
But thats alright  
He can hold a smile for as long  
As you require even longer  
He can hold a smile for as long  
As you require even longer  
Roys keen oh Roys keen  
Roys keen oh Roys keen  
Weve never seen a  
Keener windowcleaner  
Back up the ladder  
Into each corner  
Dunking the chamois  
Just think of the goodwill  
The ladders a planet  
Roy is a star and  
I am a satellite  
I will be set alight  
Dont say youll hold it steady  
Then you let it go  
Dont say youll hold it steady  
Then you let it go  
Oh  
  
Youre up the ladder  
Into each corner  
Foot in a bucket  
We trust you to wreck it  
Even when its under your nose  
Well you just cant  
See it can you  
Well its here  
Right under your nose  
And you just cant  
See it can you  
La la la la  
Roys keen Roys keen  
La la la la  
Roys keen Roys keen  
La la la la  
Roys keen Roys keen  
La la la la  
Roys keen Roys keen  
Weve never seen a  
Keener windowcleaner  
Oh  
La la la la
