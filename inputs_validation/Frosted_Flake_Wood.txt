Johnny went to frosted flake  
To go for a walk in the frozen wood  
He bumped into a mushroom  
That sold his body for some warm food  
Eat me my friend youll be the leader of the band  
Johnnys hand reached out  
Luckily there was Mr Doubt  
Mr Doubt the old man was the surveyor  
Of frosted flake wood  
He tried to sell hesitation wherever he could  
Buy some doubt  
Feel free he yelled loud  
Friends it wont hurt  
Luckily there was big bird  
For Gods sake run away  
Or it wont be your lucky day  
Leave this forest behind  
This aint a place for human kind
