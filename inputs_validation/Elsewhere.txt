Seems like were done here  
Looks like thats everything  
She walks by one last time  
Checks for her things and leave the keys behind  
There will be more tears  
As shes beginning to drive away  
Its all clear now theres no real reason to have the pain  
Now I know love has kept me here and my pride has kept me here  
And hope keeps singing its alright Ill be fine  
  
But shell be going elsewhere  
And shell be lying else where  
And shell be wanted elsewhere  
And Ill be somewhere thinking about her  
And shell be living elsewhere  
And shell be laughing elsewhere  
And shell be happy elsewhere  
And Ill be just fine without her someday  
  
Thats what I keep telling myself  
  
Was it the right thing  
Was this our biggest mistake  
Still call sometimes but shes got nothing to say And still she stays away  
Its got me questioning if I ever meant the same to her  
How could she Why would she  
Do these things put me through this pain now  
If love is what we have then how could it have been so bad  
That she dont think its not worth a fight she wont try  
  
But shell be trying elsewhere  
And shell be loving elsewhere  
And shell keep secrets elsewhere  
And Ill be somewhere thinking about her  
And shell be willing elsewhere  
And shell be giving elsewhere  
And shell have feelings elsewhere  
But hope keeps saying kells you can make it  
  
But in the meantime I cant sleep I cant think  
Theres so many things in my head  
Things she said things that she meant  
Things that I started feeling the day that she left  
Things that I slept on  
Things that I should have accepted  
Things I expected and the things I neglected  
I better get up off my ass  
Get first flight out and get her back  
  
Or else  
  
Shell be living elsewhere  
And shell be crying elsewhere  
And shell be feeling elsewhere  
And Ill be somewhere thinking about her  
Shell be smiling elsewhere  
And shell be laughing elsewhere  
Giving all of my sweet love away elsewhere  
Thats the reason why I gotta catch that flight  
 Im out of time
