You wake up in the middle of  
The thunder of a scream  
And you realise that it was yours  
You dont know what to tell them  
Cause you dont know where youve been  
And youve been late so many times before  
  
Its only natural to feel like youre sinking  
Its only human to be so unprepared  
  
Dont worry baby  
If you get a little high  
Its just a phase to get you through  
Getting by  
So you get a little restless  
And you get a little wasted  
Its just a little light entertainment  
Embrace it  
It might just save your life  
  
You always say youre sorry  
But you never know what for  
And its been happening more and more  
Act your age and not your shoe size  
And blah blah blah blah blah  
Thats your role model  
  
Slammin the door  
  
So its only natural to feel  
The guilt of a nation  
Its only human when your young  
Youre gonna cry  
  
Dont worry baby  
If you get a little high  
Its just a phase to get you through  
Getting by  
So you get a little restless  
And you get a little wasted  
Its just a little light entertainment  
Embrace it  
It might just save your life  
  
So where else can you go to  
Cause no ones given you the book  
About what to say and how to feel  
And what you should and shouldnt have took  
Its feelings that your fearing  
Thats why you step outside your mind  
  
Dont look back  
Cause if you dont crack  
You get to sing this lullaby  
You get to sing this lullaby
