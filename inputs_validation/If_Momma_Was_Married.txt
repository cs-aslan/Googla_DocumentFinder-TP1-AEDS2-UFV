If Momma was married wed live in a house  
As private as private can be  
Just Momma three ducks five canaries a mouse  
Two monkeys one father six turtles and me  
If Momma was married  
If Momma was married Id jump in the air  
And give all my toe shoes to you  
Id get all those hair ribbons out of my hair  
And once and for all Id get Momma out too  
If Momma was married  
Momma get out your white dress  
Youve done it before without much success  
Momma Godspeed and God bless  
Were not keeping score whats one more or less  
Oh Momma say yes  
And waltz down the hall while you may  
Ill gladly support you Ill even escort you  
And Id gladly give you away  
Oh Momma get married today  
If Momma was married there wouldnt be anymore  
Lets me entertain you Let me make you smile  
I will do some kicks I would do some tricks  
Sing out Louise smile baby  
Momma please take our advice  
We arent The Lunts Im not Fanny Brice  
Momma well buy you the rice  
If only this once you wouldnt think twice  
It could be so nice if Momma got married to stay  
But Momma gets married and married and married  
And never gets carried away  
Oh Momma oh Momma oh Momma get married today
