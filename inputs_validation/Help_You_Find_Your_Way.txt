It can be wise  
Or it can be a paradox  
To seek solace in your solitude  
And when it feels  
Like youre living in a box  
You need someone who believes in you  
A promise true when tried  
Ill be right here by your side  
So whenever your need be  
Know that you can lean on me  
  
Chorus  
Ill help you find your way  
Ill help you find your way  
When youre lost in all the madness  
When youre blinded by your doubt  
When you need someone to be there for you  
Ill help you find your way  
  
Dont keep your thoughts  
Locked behind your cellar door  
All shrouded in a mystery  
Just let them out  
Thats what friends are for  
To give without giving the third degree  
No need to be ashamed  
Ive been through it just the same  
So when your path misleads  
Know that you can call on me  
  
Chorus
