Shes older than me  
I dont care about them talkin  
Why cant they see  
Ive got all that I need  
  
All the pretty young things  
Seem suddenly boring  
When I look in her eyes  
All the world is behind  
  
Every line on her face  
Is a place and a memory  
When our fingers touch  
All the years fall away  
  
Mistakes that she made  
Are lessons she carries  
And still shes prepared  
To tell me shell stay  
  
Shes older than me  
Shes shown me the heaven  
And were gonna be over the hill  
And far away
