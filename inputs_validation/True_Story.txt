Now listen to me people  
Cause I want to tell you something  
Every single day  
I go on my way  
And I wont worry about my baby  
Worry about my girl  
Cause shes a pretty one  
Yeah yeah  
Whoa yeah  
  
Find me another woman  
My love for her is gone  
And I dont worry about my baby  
Worry about my girl  
Oh yeah  
Just have to tell me true  
Oh yeah  
  
If she had to do the thing she done  
She might have used more tact  
I cant be responsible  
For all the love she lacked  
  
Yeah yeah  
This is a true story people  
  
Thats a pretty tune  
Im a telling you  
  
Cause every single day  
When I go on my way  
I wont worry about my baby  
Yeah shes in another town  
Ill tell you baby  
Whoa yeah
