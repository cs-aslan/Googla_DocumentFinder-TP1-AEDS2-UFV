Between yesterday and tomorrow  
There is more there is more than a day  
Between day and night between black and white  
There is more there is more than gray  
  
Between the question and the answer  
Theres the silence of the sea  
Between the cradle and the grave  
There is the someone that is me  
  
Between yesterday and tomorrow  
There is more there is more than a day  
  
Theres every dawn youve ever seen  
And every thing youve ever known  
Theres every hand youve ever touched or that ever was  
Or that could have been or that should have been  
  
Between yesterday and tomorrow  
There is more there is more than a day  
Between day and night between black and white  
There is more there is more than gray  
  
Between the summer and the winter theres a multitude of falls  
Between the entry and the exit theres a labyrinth of halls  
Between yesterday and tomorrow  
There is more there is more than a day  
  
Theres every plan youll dare to make  
And every dream youll dare to dream  
Theres every word youll hope to say  
All thats yet to be all that ought to be all that has to be  
  
Between yesterday and tomorrow  
Between yesterday and tomorrow
