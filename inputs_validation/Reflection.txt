I have come curiously close to the end down  
Beneath my selfindulgent pitiful hole  
Defeated I concede and  
Move closer  
I may find comfort here  
I may find peace within the emptiness  
How pitiful  
  
Its calling me  
  
And in my darkest moment fetal and weeping  
The moon tells me a secret my confidant  
As full and bright as I am  
This light is not my own and  
A million light reflections pass over me  
  
Its source is bright and endless  
She resuscitates the hopeless  
Without her we are lifeless satellites drifting  
  
And as I pull my head out I am without one doubt  
Dont want to be down here feeding my narcissism  
I must crucify the ego before its far too late  
I pray the light lifts me out  
Before I pine away  
  
So crucify the ego before its far too late  
To leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical  
And you will come to find that we are all one mind  
Capable of all thats imagined and all conceivable  
Just let the light touch you  
And let the words spill through  
And let them pass right through  
Bringing out our hope and reason  
Before we pine away
