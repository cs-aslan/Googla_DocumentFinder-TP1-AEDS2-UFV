Im drinkin again  
Thinkin of when  
You left me  
That happened once so long ago  
  
Ive been havin a few  
And wishin that you  
Were right here by my side  
  
Well Im makin the rounds  
And settin them up  
A total stranger to myself  
Im just makin a fool of myself  
  
Im just hopin  
That youll come right back once someday  
But I know I know I know  
That theres no second time around  
  
Now listen  
I know I know I know I know  
  
Sure I know I can borrow a smoke  
Or sit here all night long and tell a joke  
But after all is said and done whos gonna laugh  
Whos gonna laugh at a broken a broken heart  
  
Ive been drinkin again  
And thinkin of when  
Of when you left me  
And that werent so long ago  
  
Ive been havin a few  
You know that you know  
And wishin that you  
Were here right by my side  
  
Now listen one time  
  
Ive been drinkin again  
Ive been drinkin again  
Sometimes I cant help myself
