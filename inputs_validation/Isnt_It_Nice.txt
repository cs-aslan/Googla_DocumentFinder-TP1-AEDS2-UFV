Isnt it nice to be someone  
Someone you dream that you are  
Isnt it such a nice feeling  
The feeling you wished on a star  
  
You have slipped down a rainbow  
Discovered your own pot of gold  
You are living your wildest dreams  
Use them youll never grow old  
  
Just like Cinderella  
But your clock will never strike twelve  
You have something to envy  
That everyone wants for themselves  
  
You have slipped down a rainbow  
Discovered your own pot of gold  
Chasing moonbeams and catching the wind  
And living stories youve been told  
  
You have slipped down a rainbow  
Discovered your own pot of gold  
You are living your wildest dreams  
Use them youll never grow old  
  
Isnt it nice to be somewhere  
In places youve dreamed that youve seen  
Isnt it such a nice feeling  
Being where youve never been  
  
Isnt it nice to be someone  
Someone you dream that you are  
Isnt it such a nice feeling  
The feeling you wished on a star  
  
Isnt it nice to be someone  
Someone you dream that you are  
Isnt it such a nice feeling  
The feeling you wished on a star
