May the trail rise up to meet you  
May your heart rejoice in song  
May the skies be fair above you  
As you journey ever on  
  
Ever onever on  
Ever onever on  
  
And in this planetary circle  
We are but a single stone  
Spinning on our fragile axis  
Through the endless night along  
  
Ever onever on  
  
May your love be there to guide us  
May it always keep us strong  
May we walk within your footsteps  
As you lead us ever on  
  
Ever onever on
