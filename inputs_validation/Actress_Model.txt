Dear Mom  
Im dating an actress  
And Im just writing to let you know  
Why Im so far from home  
  
I followed her to Stella Adler  
A method man was what she was after  
She musta seen them on TV  
  
Chorus  
Shes my  
Actress model dancer whatever  
Ive been watching you  
Ive been wanting you  
Actress model dancer whatever  
Youre so over there  
Youre so everywhere  
  
I met her over a cigarette  
And though I dont really know her yet  
I could see  
She sees something in me  
  
A thousand bucks wont pay the rent  
And I know where the moneys spent  
But it shows Lord  
cause nothings free  
  
Chorus  
  
She made a promise  
Shed never act with me now  
But I saw her move her lips  
They were reading scripts  
  
She made a promise  
Shed never act with me now  
And I saw her move her lips  
Line please  
Line please  
  
Dear Mom  
Im dating an actress

Chorus  
  
Dear Mom

Dear Mom
