Feather in your cap if you catch a robber  
Dirt in your face if your scheme falls through  
Pay close attention to my story  
Youll find every word is true  
Junk man standing on the corner  
Selling death no conscience has he  
  
In the name of God wont somebody stop him  
Stop him think about the children  
Its a matter of life and death you see  
Aint no time to stand back and point your finger  
Weve got to face reality  
No no no no no  
  
Dont turn your back on this problem people  
Too much depends on you and me  
Desperate with no sense of value  
Just an evil mind lurking through the night  
  
Because of you the streets aint safe no more for walking  
Cause youre feeling so uptight  
Take a look around
