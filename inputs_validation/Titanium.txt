You shout it out but I cant hear a word you say  
Im talking loud not saying much  
Im criticized but all your bullets ricochet  
You shoot me down but I get up  
  
Im bulletproof nothing to lose  
Fire away fire away  
Ricochet you take your aim  
Fire away fire away  
You shoot me down but I wont fall  
I am titanium  
You shoot me down but I wont fall  
I am titanium  
  
Cut me down but its you who has further to fall  
Ghost town haunted love  
Raise your voice sticks and stones may break my bones  
Im talking loud not saying much  
  
Im bulletproof nothing to lose  
Fire away fire away  
Ricochet you take your aim  
Fire away fire away  
You shoot me down but I wont fall  
I am titanium  
You shoot me down but I wont fall  
I am titanium  
I am titanium  
I am titanium  
  
Stonehard machine gun  
Firing at the ones who run  
Stonehard thus bulletproof glass  
  
You shoot me down but I wont fall  
I am titanium  
You shoot me down but I wont fall  
I am titanium  
  
You shoot me down but I wont fall  
I am titanium  
You shoot me down but I wont fall  
I am titanium  
  
I am titanium
