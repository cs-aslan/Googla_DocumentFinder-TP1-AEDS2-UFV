Youre everything I want and more  
Oh I adore your mystery  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
I cant complain no more  
Thats how its supposed to be  
Im not in pain no more  yeah  
Cause hes so close to me  
It doesnt matter what they say  
Ill be a fool for you  
But is it possible to say  
Oh if they cant be cool with you  
  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
  
I dont get it wrong at all  
Im in no empty conversations  
I cant be strong at all  
Oh with that vain imagination  
Oh I wont even tolerate  
None of their insane expectations  
What youve given me already  
Oh has me free from obligation  hey  hey  
  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
  
See it dont bother me at all  
because Im free from obligation  
Oh I dont even entertain  
None of their insane expectations  
See what youve given me already  
Oh its enough to satisfy  
See youve forgiven me for getting  
All of the pride I had inside  
See now our living can begin  
Because all thats been left behind  
See now our living can begin  
Because that chance has left and I  I  I  
And now I just belong to you  
Theres no one else to satisfy  
Oh baby Ill be strong for you  
Until they come to realize  realize  realize that  
  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
  
I have no fear at all  
No fear at all  
I have no fear at all  
No fear at all  
I have no  fear at all  
I have no  fear at all  
I have no fear  at all  
I have no fear  at all
