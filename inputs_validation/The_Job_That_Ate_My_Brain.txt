Out of bed at 615 In a rush and you cant think  
Gotta catch the bus and train  
Im in a rush and feelin insane  
  
I cant take this crazy pace  
Ive become a mental case  
Yeah this is the job that ate my brain  
  
Go to work its such a drag  
Face the boss hes such a nag  
In a suit and in a tie  
  
I look so late I wanna die  
  
I cant take this crazy pace  
Ive become a mental case  
Yeah this is the job that ate my brain  
  
I punch the clock at 905  
I know Im late but still alive  
Everyone just stares at me  
Im last in line for this party  
  
I cant take this crazy pace  
Ive become a mental case  
Yeah this is the job that ate my brain  
  
Five oclock rolls around  
I feel so glad I kiss the ground  
Aint enough hours in the day  
Theres go to be a better way  
  
I cant take this crazy pace  
Ive become a mental case  
Yeah this is the job that ate my brain
