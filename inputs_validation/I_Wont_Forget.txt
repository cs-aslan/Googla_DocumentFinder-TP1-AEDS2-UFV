It mightve been a Saturday night  
It aint clear it was so long ago  
It was somewhere across the county line  
A dance or a party I dont know  
But I do know you looked like an angel  
And your eyes were the color of your dress  
  
Theres a million things I dont remember  
But thats the one thing that I wont forget  
  
It mightve been a Saturday night  
It was either my folks car or yours  
I know that we went to some drivein  
What was playing that night Im not sure  
But I am sure you whispered you loved me  
As my lips softly pressed against your neck  
  
Theres a million   
  
After a while I guess we agreed  
We had wings we needed to test  
Somehow we talked ourselves out of love  
That such close to love as Ive gotten yet  
  
It was 221 on a Sunday  
And I found myself standing in the rain  
You blew me a kiss through the window  
As your greyhound was pulling away  
Inside I was dying to stop you  
I shouldve listened to my heart  
And not my head
