There aint no man gonna invade my territory  
There aint nobody out there gonna mess with me  
Because Im big and hard and battlescarred  
And getting long in the tooth desperate and hungry  
And got nothing to loose  
  
Yeah Im a lone wolf Ive been chased  
And Ive been bit Yeah Im a lone wolf  
They like to shoot at me but they miss  
Yeah Im a lone wolf and I aint never been trapped  
And God help the people that think they got me cornered at last  
  
Ive been huntingIve been tracking  
Ive been running since I was 3 born in Louisiana Swamp  
Moved with the pack to Tennessee  
Raised by black and white dogs to some country some rocknroll  
They said now boy your gonna have to quit your houlling so  
Staying up all night and chasing Lassies by the moon  
Laying up all day on the porch playing guitar tunes  
  
Yeah Im a lone wolf and I no longer run with the pack  
Yeah I am a lone wolfI dont ever look back  
Hey I am a lone wolf out here on the prowl  
And most of us have been penned up but Im still running wild  
  
Hey Im a lone wolfIve been chased and Ive been bit  
Yeah I am a lone wolf this ole dog knows all the tricks  
Hey Im a lone wolf Still hungry and Im on the prowl  
And most of us have been penned up but  
Bocephus is running wild  
You better watch out because Im hungry and Im on the prowl
