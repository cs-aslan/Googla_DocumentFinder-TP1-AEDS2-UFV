Do I make you feel like Christmas time  
Put me in a party dress one time  
Love me till I see the sunshine  
Say youll never leave me  
Say youll never leave me  
  
Who has the face like smarty does  
Who has the voice like smarty does  
Who has the choice like smarty does  
Nobody nobody  
Who has the face like smarty does  
Who has the voice like smarty does  
Nobody  
Who has the choice like smarty does  
Nobody nobody  
  
Say I make you feel like christmas time  
Say I make you feel like christmas time  
Tell me that I feel like christmas time  
Put me in a party dress one time  
Baby if you love me youll call me a bunny  
Tell me Im just a baby honey  
Meet me and tell me no one will love me  
Better than you do  
Better than you do  
  
Dance me all around the room  
Dance me around the room  
Keep out the stars turn out the lights  
This little world is yours tonight  
Dance me all around the room  
Say youll never leave me  
  
Who has the face like smarty does  
Who has the voice like smarty does  
  
Who has the choice like smarty does  
Nobody nobody  
Who has the face like smarty does  
Who has the voice like smarty does  
Nobody  
Who has the choice like smarty does  
Nobody nobody  
  
Say I make you feel like  
Like you did like you did when you were thirteen  
Say I make you feel like  
When you were the dirty heavy metal king  
Say I make you feel alright alright alright  
  
Kissing me till I see the sunshine  
Kissing me till I see the sunshine  
Keep out the stars turn out the lights  
This little world is yours tonight  
Is yours tonight  
This little world is yours tonight  
Say youll never leave me  
Say youll never leave me  
  
Who has the face like smarty does  
Who has the voice like smarty does  
Who has the choice like smarty does  
Nobody nobody  
Who has the face like smarty does  
Who has the voice like smarty does  
Nobody  
Who has the choice like smarty does  
Nobody nobody  
Nobody nobody  
Nobody nobody
