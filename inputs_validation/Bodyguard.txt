It hurts me when you cry  
When you feel the love is gone  
Dont give up on us  
When you got so much to believe in  
And I beg you please stay  
Strangers in the night  
A flame that never dies  
In a world of lonely faces  
You need someone to survive  
A heart like yours  
Should never live alone  
  
Chorus  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
Lost inside  
Its only you and me  
  
Theres things you shouldnt do  
You lose your self control  
Should the eyes of a perfect stranger  
Take you down to a new sensation  
Just turn back to me  
Dont wait till its gone  
Dont go where you dont belong  
In this world of pain and sorrow  
Every wish is your command  
A heart like yours  
Should always find a home  
  
I know the signs and Im telling you  
Youre living on borrowed time  
But a heart needs love  
Like a flower needs rain  
Like Im making you mine  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far my love my life  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
What we had never known all our lives  
I pray its not too late  
I would die by your side my love  
Im the life that you save  
In this world of pain and sorrow  
Every wish is your command  
A heart like yours should never live alone  
  
I used to dream of a special one  
And now I feel it coming true  
But I couldnt let go Im a jealous guy  
What youre putting me through  
Im begging you  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far my love my life  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
Stop before we go too far  
  
Stop before we go too far my love my life  
Stop before we go too far my love my life  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far my love my life  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
Stop before we go too far my love my life  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far
