Crafty friends whered they all go  
Try and find but no one ever knows  
You fall down makes you want to stay  
Who the hell would want to anyway  
Well Im leaving  
  
And I want it all  
Forgot it all  
Better find this all  
And I found out where its all at  
  
Better now than Im before  
Tried it once now I want it more  
Memories of cut in half  
Tell the truth then I want you to laugh  
Were not laughing  
  
And I want it all  
Forgot it all  
Better find this all  
And I found out where its all at  
  
Knew it all  
Whats it like  
Sell it all  
Whats your price  
  
Steal a car were all headed south  
You know the score so just shut your mouth  
One more run then I want out  
Not like them Id rather go without  
Without needing  
  
And I want it all  
Forgot it all  
Better find this all  
And I found out where its all at  
  
Well I knew it all  
Better than before  
Better find this all  
And I found out where its all at
