You told me I was one in a million  
Everything you wanted in this world  
Every time I turn around  
I hear tell you paint the town  
With one of this million other girls  
  
Oh watcha do to me is not the question  
I swear I felt the magic from the start  
I see the promise of a legendary love  
But I am not about to share your heart  
  
Chorus  
Id do almost anything just to make you mine  
But I wont stand in line  
I wont stand in line waiting for your call  
I wont take a number just to take a fall  
So make up your mind  
I wont stand in line  
  
Oh how long do you think that you can handle  
Keeping all those hearts up in the air  
Dont you know in time youre bound to stumble  
And when that day comes it wont be my affair  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Oh I wont stand in line  
I wont stand in line  
I wont stand in line  
Id do almost anything if I could make you mine  
I wont stand in line  
I wont stand in line  
Id do almost anything if I could make you mine  
I wont stand in line  
I wont stand in line  
I wont stand in line  
I wont stand in line  
Id do almost anything if I could make you mine  
I wont stand in line
