Woke up this morning  
Something robbed me of my sleep  
Reached for you but all I felt  
Was a cold empty sheet  
Three nights on the road babe  
I dont know where you been  
Say youre working late  
Could it be you got another man  
Somebody said they saw you  
In a little club downtown  
Arms around a stranger  
You were really goin to town  
You say theyre just jealous  
That youll always be mine  
Nighttime has a thousand eyes  
Could they all be blind  
Or am I a fool Am I a fool  
Cause this confusion oh its killing me  
They all say that youre doing me wrong  
But our love is much too strong  
Somebody tell me somebody tell me  
Who to believe  
Baby I really need you  
Though I love you like a child  
But I wont have no cheatin woman  
Tellin lies and runnin wild  
I really want to believe you  
When you say that youre bein true  
But everywhere I look  
Like the finger points to you  
Or am I a fool Am I a fool  
Cause this confusion always killing me  
They all say that youre doing me bad  
Youre the best thing Ive ever had  
Somebody tell me somebody tell me  
Who to believe  
Or am I a fool Am I a fool  
Cause this confusion always killing me  
They all say that youre doing me wrong  
But our love is much too strong  
Somebody tell me somebody tell me  
Am I a fool Am I a fool  
Cause this confusion always killing me  
They all say that youre doing me bad  
Youre the best thing Ive ever had  
Somebody tell me somebody tell me  
Who to believe
