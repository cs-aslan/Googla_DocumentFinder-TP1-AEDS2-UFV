Yes I hate the way I feel and it makes no sense  
Five months gone and all I got  
Pretty pink flowers on my chain link fence  
I dont like what it means  
Cause I know theres more to come  
I cant go home without  
Chrysanthemum  
  
I walk around lost and I dont know why  
I dont see the faces or the places I should recognize  
Its like that dream where it feels like home but it dont look right  
Yes I will look everywhere tonight  
I will not stop till I make things right  
And I cant go home till I see the sun  
I cant go home without  
Chrysanthemum  
No I cant go home without  
Chrysanthemum
