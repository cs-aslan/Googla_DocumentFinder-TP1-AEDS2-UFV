Oh oh  
Oh I cant get it back  
But I dont want it back  
I realized that she  
Dont know how to act  
Never been a dumb dude  
No Im not dense  
I just had a slight lack of common sense  
I was the good guy  
She was the bad girl  
Im thinking one girl  
She thinking me Earl James and Jimmy  
Yep she had plenty  
But love for me she didnt have any  
  
Bridge  
I was inviting her into my heart  
But she was out riding in some other mans car  
She was my night time thought I was her star  
Guess I was wrong but see Im strong  
Wont take me long for me to move on  
  
Chorus  
Please dont worry bout me Im fine  
Please dont worry bout me Im fine  
Only gonna play the fool one time  
Only gonna play the fool one time  
Trust me when I say that Ill be okay  
Go on girl  
Go on girl  
Go on girl  
Go on girl  
Go on girl  
  
I cant get it back  
But I dont want it back  
I realized that she  
Dont know how to act  
Tried to settle down and look what I get  
Thought it was my time but I guess not yet  
She at the bar getting drinks from many men  
Im in the house thinking shes with her girlfriends  
Just not knowing truly not knowing  
I look back now like man I was open  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooo the mistake I made was clear  
We never shouldve been together  
Thats the reason youre not here  
I know that I can do much better  
Not a single salty tear  
Not a feeling in my chest  
Baby Im feeling no stress  
Im too fly to be depressed  
  
Go on girl go on girl  
Go on girl go on girl  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Go on girl go on girl go on girl  
Ill be fine
