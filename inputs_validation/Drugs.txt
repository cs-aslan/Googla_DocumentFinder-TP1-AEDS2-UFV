And all I see is little dots  
Some are smeared and some are spots  
Feels like a murder but thats alright  
Somebody said theres too much light  
Pull down the shade and its alright  
Itll be over in a minute or two  
  
Im charged updont put me down  
Dont feel like talkingdont mess around  
I feel meanI feel ok  
Im charged upelectricity  
  
The boys are making a big mess  
This makes the girls all start to laugh  
I dont know what theyre talking about  
The boys are worried the girls are shocked  
They pick the sound and let it drop  
Nobody know what theyre talking about  
  
Im charged upIm kinda wooden  
Im barely movingI study motion  
I study myselfI fooled myself  
Im charged upits pretty intense  
Im charged updont put me down  
Dont feel like talkingdont mess around  
I feel meanI feel ok  
Im charged upelectricity
