Dear when I dance with you  
We move like the sea  
You youre all I want to know  
I feel free  
I feel free  
I can walk down the street  
Theres no one there  
The pavement is one huge crowd  
I can drive down the road  
My eyes cant see  
But my mind wants to cry out loud  
I can walk down the street  
Theres no one there  
The pavement is one huge crowd  
I can drive down the road  
My eyes cant see  
But my mind wants to cry out loud  
My mind wants to cry out loud  
I feel free  
Dance floor is like the sea  
The ceiling is the sky  
Youre the sun and as you shine on me  
I feel free  
I feel free  
I feel free
