When I lose my smile  
When my thoughts get jumbled  
When the air and bs get too thick  
Cant take a breath without getting sick  
Ive had enough with this concrete jungle  
I drop my truck in drive  
I pick up my baby  
She jumps in with a kiss and a hey  
We exit off that old highway  
Sometimes you gotta go beyond the pavement  
  
Chorus  
You gotta go deep  
Way on back  
Cross a few creeks  
And a couple little shacks  
You gotta get lost  
Way on out  
Crickets and frogs  
Yeah youre gettin close now  
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road  
And you go and you go and you gogogo  
Til you hear a banjo ah there it is  
  
It aint on no map  
And Im glad it isnt  
Leave the phone and the GPS  
Those satellites aint found it yet  
Got our own little piece of heaven hidden  
  
You gotta go deep  
Way on back  
Cross a few creeks  
And a couple little shacks  
You gotta get lost  
Way on out  
Crickets and frogs  
Yeah youre gettin close now  
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road  
And you go and you go and you go go go go  
Til you hear that banjo yeah woo  
  
You gotta go deep  
Way on back  
Cross a few creeks  
And a couple little shacks  
Hell you gotta get lost  
Way on out  
Yeah crickets and frogs  
Hey youre gettin close now  
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road  
And you go and you go and you go and you go and you go and you go woo oo  
Til you hear that banjo kick it  
  
Gotta go deep  
A way on back  
Yeah cross a few creeks  
And a couple little shacks  
Four wheel drive when you run out of road  
And you go and you go and you go  
Til you hear that til you hear that til you hear that banjo  
  
Thats nice  
Lets go  
Kick that thing into four wheel drive  
Lets go  
Til you hear that  
  
Until you hear that banjo  
Until you hear that banjo
