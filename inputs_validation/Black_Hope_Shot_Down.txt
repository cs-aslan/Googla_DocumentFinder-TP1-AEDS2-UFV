Get get get get your widowmaker  
And put your children back inside  
Yet yet yet yet another failure  
In this life of the free  
Black hope shot down  
Theres a gun in his hand  
That souls divine  
Theres a hole in his head  
Back back back back off for I break you  
And thats how everything goes down  
Run run run run away dont stay here  
Or theyll say its your time  
Black hope shot down  
Theres a gun in his hand  
That souls divine  
Theres a hole in his head  
Black hope shot down  
Theres a gun in his hand  
Shot down  
  
Black hope shot down  
Theres a gun in his hand  
That souls divine  
Theres a hole in his head
