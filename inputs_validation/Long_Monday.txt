You and me sittin in the back of my memory  
Like a honey bee buzzin round a glass of sweet Chablis  
Radios on windows rolled up and my minds rolled down  
Headlights shining like silver moons rollin on the ground  
We made love in every way love can be made  
And we made time look like time could never fade  
Friday Night we both made the guitar hum  
Saturday made Sunday feel like it would never come  
Gonna be a long Monday  
Sittin all alone on a mountain by a river that has no end  
Gonna be a long Monday  
Stuck like the tick of a clock thats come unwound again  
Soul to soul heart to heart and cheek to cheek  
Now come on baby give me a kiss thatll last all week  
The thought of you leavin again brings me down  
The promise of your sweet love brings me around  
Gonna be a long Monday  
Sittin all alone on a mountain by a river that has no end  
Its gonna be a long Monday  
Stuck like the tick of a clock thats come unwound again and again
