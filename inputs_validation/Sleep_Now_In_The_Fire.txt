The world is my expense  
The cost of my desire  
Jesus blessed me with its future  
And I protect it with fire  
So raise your fists  
And march around  
Dont dare take what you need  
Ill jail and bury those committed  
And smother the rest in greed  
Crawl with me into tomorrow  
Or Ill drag you to your grave  
Im deep inside your children  
Theyll betray you in my name  
  
Sleep now in the fire  
  
The lie is my expense  
The scope of my desire  
The Party blessed me with its future  
And I protect it with fire  
I am the Nina The Pinta The Santa Maria  
The noose and the rapist  
And the fields overseer  
The agents of orange  
The priests of Hiroshima  
The cost of my desire  
  
Sleep now in the fire  
  
For its the end of history  
Its caged and frozen still  
There is no other pill to take  
So swallow the one  
That made you ill  
The Nina The Pinta The Santa Maria  
The noose and the rapist  
The fields overseer  
The agents of orange  
The priests of Hiroshima  
The cost of my desire  
  
Sleep now in the fire
