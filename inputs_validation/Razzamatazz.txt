Dont believe those clouds in the sky  
Cause theyll be moving on and the sun will shine  
If the worlds been passin you by  
Just reach out for a star and youll realize  
  
Got to put back all the good times that we had  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz  
  
If you feel your lifes in a rut  
Just come on out tonight and well pull you up  
Aint no use in draggin your feet  
Cause somethings in the air that just cant be beat  
  
Got to put back all the good times that we had  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz  
  
Bring out the rides with all those white walled tires  
Lets go out cruisin like we used to do  
Get suited down lets set the town on fire  
Jump out your seat and let the music pull you through  
  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz  
  
Got to put back all the good times that we had

Lets go out cruisin like we used to do  
Get suited down lets set the town on fire  
Jump out your seat and let the music pull you through  
  
You can lay your soul on the line  
Cause we can make it work  
If we do it right  
Got to spread the message around  
The people of the world should be getting down  
  
Got to put back all the good times that we had  
  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz  
  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz
