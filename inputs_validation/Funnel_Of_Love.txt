Here I go  
Falling down down down  
My mind is a blank  
My head is spinning around and around  
As I go deep into the funnel of love  
  
Its such a crazy crazy feeling  
I get weak in the knees  
My poor old head is a reelin  
As I go deep into the funnel of love  
  
I tried and I tried to run and hide  
I even tried to run away  
You just cant run from the funnel of love  
Its gonna get you someday  
  
Its such a crazy crazy feeling  
I get weak in the knees  
My poor old head is a reelin  
As I go deep into the funnel of love  
  
I tried and I tried to run and hide  
I even tried to run away  
You just cant run from the funnel of love  
Its gonna get you someday  
  
Here I go falling down down down  
My mind is a blank  
My head is spinning around and around  
As I go deep into the funnel of love  
Deep into the funnel of love  
Deep into the funnel of love
