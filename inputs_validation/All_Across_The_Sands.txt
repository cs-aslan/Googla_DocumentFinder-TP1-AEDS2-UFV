But of an impressive romance  
Scattered all across the sands  
A secret safe with all the world  
Too vain to seem so capable  
  
Chorus  
Can you hear it calling  
Do you feel warmer  
As the hired hands exposed  
  
How can a pretty painting show  
Send them all packing out to Hell  
A freight train laughs and rattles by  
You kissed the girls and made them die  
  
Chorus  
  
And Ill never come here again  
Ah we will never come here again  
Ah we will never play here again again  
  
Chorus  
  
After her call  
After her call  
After sic her call  
And she calls
