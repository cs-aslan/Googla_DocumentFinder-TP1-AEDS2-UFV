Its only perfection  
Youre only running scared  
You just might get there  
You burn it  
Deserve it  
Its got a rope around your neck  
It wants your last breath  
God save you  
Save you  
Save you  
God save you  
Save you  
Youre bleeding  
Receding  
Believing every little lie  
Youre so tired  
And its hurting me  
And its hurting you  
And it burns through  
Every thing you touch  
I miss you so much  
God save you  
Save you  
Save you  
Im not blaming you  
Blaming you  
Blaming you  
God save you  
Save you  
Shes an innocent freak  
Shes an innocent freak  
Shes an innocent freak  
And Im bored  
God save you  
Save you  
Save you  
God save you  
Save you  
Im not blaming you  
Blaming you  
Blaming you  
God save you  
Save you  
Save you  
God help me  
Help you
