I cant keep this from you  
Ive held it in so long  
Its time to tell the truth  
Keeping it from you is wrong  
  
I cant keep this from you  
Its so simple Im afraid  
When I tell you how I feel  
Youll just laugh and call me crazy  
  
And I cant keep  
This love a secret  
And I dont want  
To go on longing  
I just want a chance for me to prove  
My love and I cant keep this from you  
  
I cant keep this from you  
Its hard to breathe in here  
I just seem to act the fool  
Every time I feel you near  
  
I cant keep this from you  
No matter what you say  
Anything is better now  
Than going through my life this way  
  
And I cant keep  
This love a secret  
And I dont want  
To go on longing  
I just want a chance for me to prove  
My love and I cant keep this from you  
  
And I love every move you make  
Cant you hear every heart you break  
And dont you know when I hear your name  
Just the sound of it shoots me down in flames  
  
And I cant keep  
This love a secret  
And I dont want  
To go on longing  
I just want a chance for me to prove  
My love and I cant keep this from you  
  
I cant keep  
This love a secret  
And I dont want  
To go on longing  
I just want a chance for me to prove  
My love and I cant keep this from you  
  
I just want a chance for me to prove  
My love and I cant keep this from you  
Oh no  
I just cant keep this from you
