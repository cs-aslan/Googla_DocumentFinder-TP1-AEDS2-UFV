Sunrise through the evergreens  
Another day is born  
The hills take on a golden glow  
A Carolina morn  
  
I used to see you in her eyes  
Now I just got to know  
Oh Carolina how could you let her go  
  
Chorus  
Oh Carolina if Id only known  
Oh Carolina I would have never gone  
  
I thought the beauty of your hills  
Would hold her here for me  
I never dreamed while I was gone  
Youd ever set her free  
I trusted you with all my heart  
And the only love Ive known  
Oh Carolina how could you let her go  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I would have never gone
