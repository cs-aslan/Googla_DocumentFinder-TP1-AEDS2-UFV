Even now  
After all these years  
I think about you with both joy and pain  
Even now  
I remember when you left  
I walked all night through the rain  
Broken and lost swearing Id never love that way again  
  
Even then you were aiming much higher  
Somewhere higher  
Then you thought i could fly  
  
Even then you were looking for rainbows  
Something more  
Then the cloudless blue sky  
  
Now you tell me you were wrong  
You never should have left me for an empty dream  
And now you spill out your regrets  
A mighty river to a bitter stream  
Lying awake thinking about all that might have been  
I guess were even now  
I guess were even now  
  
Even now  
More often then Id like  
I think of you and the place we used to share  
  
Even now  
I remember all the songs  
And the perfume in your hair  
I was carried away until you cut me down in mid air  
  
Even then  
There was something inside you  
Something bright  
That was burning so cold  
  
Even then  
There was something about you  
Something dark  
That I couldnt hold  
  
And now you tell me that your life  
Has never been the free flight you thought it would be  
And now you know its way to late  
All weve got is history  
You know that when I lost you you lost me  
I guess were even now  
Oh  
I guess were even now  
I think were even now  
  
Even then  
You were looking for rainbows  
Even then  
In a perfect blue sky  
  
I guess were even now  
I guess were even now  
I think were even now  
Could be were even now  
I think were even now  
I think were even now  
I think were even now  
  
All that summer  
In the moonlight  
You were dreaming  
I was believing  
  
All that summer  
All that summer  
In the moonlight  
In the moonlight  
You were dreaming  
You were dreaming  
I was believing
