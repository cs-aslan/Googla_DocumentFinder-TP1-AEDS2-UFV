I need your love so badly  
I love you oh so madly  
But I dont stand a  
Ghost of a chance with you  
I thought at last Id found you  
But other loves surround you  
And I dont stand a  
Ghost of a chance with you  
  
If youd surrender  
Just for a tender kiss or two  
You might discover  
that Im the lover meant for you  
And Id be true  
But whats the good of scheming  
I Know I must be dreaming  
For I dont stand a  
Ghost of a chance with you
