Blue river it cant be found on any map that I know  
But its the place where lonely lovers all go  
To cry their tears blue river  
  
It winds along a path of heartache and pain  
Of broken dreams from lovin someone in vain  
Like I loved you and baby I still do  
  
I held you so tight  
You were out of my sight  
Im feelin so low  
But I gotta go  
  
Blue river because you never really cared about me  
From now on baby thats where Im gonna be  
Cryin over you by the river of blue
