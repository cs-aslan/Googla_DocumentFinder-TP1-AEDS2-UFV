I know you want your money girl  
Cause you do this every day okay  
The way you doubt your feelings  
And look the other way  
Well its something I relate to  
Your gift of nonchalance  
Nobodys ever made me fall in love  
With this amount of touch  
  
Well Im not a fool  
I just love that youre dead inside That youre dead inside  
Im not a fool Im just lifeless too  
  
But you to taught me how to feel  
When nobody ever would Nobody ever would  
And you taught me how to love  
What nobody ever could  
  
Ooh girl I know I should leave you  
And learn to mistreat you  
Cause you belong to the world  
And ooh girl I want to embrace you  
Domesticate you  
But you belong to the world you belong to the world  
  
And I know that Im saying too much  
Even though Id rather hold my tongue yeah  
And Ill pull you closer holding on to  
Every moment till my time is done yeah  
And this aint right youve been the only one to make me smile  
In such long Ive succumbed to what Ive become baby  
  
Im not a fool  
I just love that youre dead inside that youre dead inside  
Im not a fool Im just lifeless too Im just lifeless too  
  
But you to taught me how to feel You taught me how to feel  
When nobody ever would Nobody ever would  
And you taught me how to love You taught me how to love  
What nobody ever could  
  
Ooh girl I should leave you I know I should leave you  
And learn to mistreat you And learn to mistreat you  
Because you belong to the world oh yeah  
And ooh girl I wanna embrace you I wanna embrace you  
Domesticate you Domesticate you  
But you belong to the world  
You belong to the world  
You belong to the world  
  
You belong to the loneliness of filling every need  
You belong to the world you belong to the world  
You belong to the temporary moments of a dream  
  
Ooh girl I know I should leave you  
And learn to mistreat you  
Cause you belong to the world  
And ooh girl I want to embrace you  
Domesticate you  
But you belong to the world you belong to the world  
You belong to the world you belong to the world  
You belong to the world
