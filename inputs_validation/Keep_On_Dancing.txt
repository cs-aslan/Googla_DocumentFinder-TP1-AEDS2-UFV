I got a friend who loves the music  
He got a red hot groove  
But he dont use it  
I get so afraid hes gonna lose it  
If you gotta gift  man dont abuse it  
  
Keep on dancing  
  
The experts say they really care  
They dont have a clue whats out there  
The teachers tell the children not to swear  
And the drunken lawyes  
Leaves the kid  
To pop something in  
To kill the fear its not fair  
  
Keep on dancing  
  
Im a frightened Dad worried sick  
Hear what I say  
I could put something in here  
You know what rhymes with it  
The whole world seems to end  
In cked  
You aint fooling me anyway  
  
Keep on dancing  
  
Are you ready here comes  
Steve Gadd  
  
Keep on dancing  
  
See em run for the books cause  
They just dont get it  
They throw it at me  
But Ive already read it  
Before they speak  
Someone already said it  
  
We cant be friends  
cause Karl Marx dont rhyme  
With MercedezBenz  
I need credit  
You can shove it  
You know why  
cause I love it  
  
Keep on dancing
