How can I say how much youve done for me  
How much I have just knowing I had you  
You touched my world and Ill never be the same  
You touched my heart and now everything has changed  
You are the one in this life Ill remember  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
Wherever you are  
My heart is with you  
No matter how far  
Ill always be near  
Whenever you need me  
I will be right here  
Therell always be a part of you with me  
I hope therell be a part of me with you  
Just call my name and Ill hear you on the wind  
Just close your eyes and Ill find you once again  
Just know that Im on your side and remember  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
Wherever you are  
My heart is with you  
No matter how far  
Ill always be near  
Whenever you need me  
I will be right here  
And when the wind touches you  
It will touch me too  
And the same star you see  
Will be the one that shines on me  
Ill be here when you need me  
Ill be here anytime  
Baby Im your side so remember  
I will be right here  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
Wherever you are  
My heart is with you  
No matter how far  
Ill always be near  
Whenever you need me  
I will be right here  
I will be right here  
I will be right here
