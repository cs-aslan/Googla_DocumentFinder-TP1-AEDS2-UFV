I got no diamond though Im shy  
Still I think Im a lucky guy  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Got no mansion got no yacht  
Still Im happy with what Ive got  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Sunshine gives me a lovely day  
Moonlight gives me the milky way  
Got no checkbook got no bank  
Still Id like to express my thanks  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
And with the sun in the morning and the moon in the evening  
Im all right
