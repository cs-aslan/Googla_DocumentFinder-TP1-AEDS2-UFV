Where do you think youre going  
Dont you know its dark outside  
Where do you think youre going  
Dont you care about my pride  
Where do you think youre going  
I thing you dont know  
You got no way of knowing  
Theres really no place you can go  
  
I understand your changes  
Long before you reach the door  
I know where you think youre going  
I know what you came here for  
And now Im sick of jocking  
I know I like you to be free  
Where do you think youre going  
I think you better go with me girl  
  
You say there is no reason  
But you still find cause to doubt me  
If you aint with me girl  
Youre gonna be without me  
  
Where do you think youre going  
Dont you know its dark outside  
Where do you think youre going  
Dont you care about my pride  
And now Im sick of jocking  
I know I like you to be free  
Where do you think youre going  
I think you better go with me girl
