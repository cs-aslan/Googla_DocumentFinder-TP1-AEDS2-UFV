A little girl a little small for her age  
A little too slow for the field day race  
Mommas waiting at the finish line  
And wipes the teardrops from her eyes  
She says You did just fine honey thats okay  
Sometimes lifes just that way  
Youre gonna lose the race from time to time  
But youre always gonna find  
  
You cant lose me  
Bet your life  
I am here and I will always be  
Just a wish away  
Wherever you go  
No matter how far  
My love is where you are  
You wont be lost if you believe  
You cant lose me  
  
Momma use to say Girl it wont be long  
Til its time to go out on your own  
Chase your dreams find your place in life  
I know youll do just fine  
When that day finally came  
There were things she needed to but could not say  
So I whispered softly as I wiped  
The tears from Mommas eyes  
  
You cant lose me  
Bet your life  
I am here and I will always be  
Just a wish away  
Wherever I go  
No matter how far  
My love is where you are  
You wont be lost if you believe  
You cant lose me
