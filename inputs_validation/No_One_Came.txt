Maybe its because Im only starting  
That I think it wont take too long  
Maybe its because I can see you laughing  
That I think youve got it wrong  
Maybe I could be like Robin Hood  
Like and outlaw dressed all in green  
Someone said whats he gonna turn out like  
And someone else said never mind  
Well I was big and bold and more than twice as old  
As all the cats Id ever seen  
I grew my hair and bought a suit  
Of shiny white or was it cream  
I shook and shivered danced and quivered  
And stood on a mountain top  
  
No one came from miles around and said  
Man your music is really hot  
  
Well I knew what they meant because I was a freak  
My throat was tired and worn  
My pretty face just looked out of place  
As they poured on the scorn  
I wrote on yellow paper from a man who was the king  
He said my boy well have some crazy scenes  
There werent any scenes at all like he was talkin about  
He mustve been the king of queens  
Well I could write a million songs about the things Ive done  
But I could never sing them so theyd never get sung  
Theres a law for the rich and one for the poor  
And theres another one for sing  
Its die young and live much longer  
Spend your money and sit and wonder  
  
No one came for miles around  
And said man your music is really funky  
  
I believe that I must tell the truth  
And say things as they really are  
But if I told the truth and nothing but the truth  
Could I ever be a star  
Nobody knows whos real and whos fakin  
Everyones shouting out loud  
Its only the glitter and shine that gets through  
Wheres my Robin Hood outfit  
Well Ive come and Ive gone before you wink an eye  
No one ever cared enough to say goodbye  
The moneys good and the time you have  
Fun and games galore  
But you spend your money and lie in bed forgotten  
And you wonder what you did it for  
  
No one came from miles around  
And said man whos he
