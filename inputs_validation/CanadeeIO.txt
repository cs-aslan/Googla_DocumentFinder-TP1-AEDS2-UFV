Well its all of fair and handsome girl  
Shes all in her tender years  
She fell in love with a sailor boy  
Its true she loved him well  
For to go off to sea with him  
Like she did not know how  
She longed to see that seaport town  
Of Canadeeio  
  
So she bargained with the sailor boy  
All for a piece of gold  
Straightaway then he led her  
Down into the hold  
Sayin Ill dress you up in sailors clothes  
Your jacket shall be blue  
Youll see that seaport town  
Of Canadeeio  
  
Now when the other sailors heard the news  
Well they fell into a rage  
And with all the ships company  
They were willing to engage  
Saying Well tie her hands and feet my boys  
Overboard well throw her  
Shell never see that seaport town  
Called Canadeeio  
  
Now when the captain he heard the news  
Well he too fell in a rage  
And with the whole ships company  
He was willing to engage  
Sayin Shell stay in sailors clothes  
Her color shall be blue  
Shell see that seaport town  
Call Canadeeio  
  
Now when they come down to Canada  
Scarcely bout half a year  
Shes married this bold captain  
Who called her his dear  
Shes dressed in silks and satins now  
She cuts a gallant show  
Finest of the ladies  
Down Canadeeio  
  
Come all you fair and tender girls  
Wheresoever you may be  
Id have you to follow your own true love  
Wheneer he goes to sea  
For if the sailors prove false to you  
Well the captain he might prove true  
Youll see the honor I have gained  
By the wearing of the blue
