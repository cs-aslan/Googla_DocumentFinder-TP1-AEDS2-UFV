Was in the merry month of May  
When all gay flowers were a bloomin  
Sweet William on his deathbed lay  
For the love of Barbara Allen  
  
He sent his servant to the town  
To the place where she was dwelling  
Said You must come to my masters house  
If your name be Barbara Allen  
  
So slowly slowly she gets up  
And to his bedside going  
She drew the curtains to one side  
And says Young man youre dying  
  
I know Im sick and very low  
And sorrow dwells within me  
No better no better I never will be  
Til I have Barbara Allen  
  
Dont you remember last Saturday night  
When I was at the tavern  
You gave your drinks to the ladies there  
But you slighted Barbara Allen  
  
He reached up his pale white hands  
Intending for to touch her  
She turned away from his bedside  
And says Young man I wont have you  
  
He turned his cheek into the wall  
And bursted out a crying  
What I do to thee I do to all  
And I do to Barbara Allen  
  
She had not walked and reached the town  
She heard the death bells ringing  
And as they rolled they seemed to say  
Hardhearted Barbara Allen  
  
Oh Mother oh mother go make my bed  
Make it both long and narrow  
Sweet William died for me today  
Ill die for him tomorrow  
Sweet William was buried in the old church yard  
  
And Barbara there anigh him  
And out of his grave grew a red red rose  
And out of hers a briar  
They grew and grew to the old churchyard  
  
Where they couldnt grow no higher  
And there they tied in a true loves knot  
The rose wrapped around the briar
