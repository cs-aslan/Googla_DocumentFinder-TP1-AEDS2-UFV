Today I dont feel like doing anything  
I just wanna lay in my bed  
Dont feel like picking up my phone  
So leave a message at the tone  
Cause today I swear Im not doing anything

Turn the tv on  
Throw my hand in my pants  
Nobodys gon tell me I cant no

Flip to MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie
