Its time to make the Christmas punch  
Lets hang the streamers from the ceiling  
Bring out the old cheer  
Ring in the new year  
And get that Christmas feeling  
  
Chorus  
I wish you joy that never ends  
Happy times with all your friends  
Come on and hold my hips a little longer  
As we do the Christmas Conga  
Bonga bonga bonga bonga  
Do the Christmas Conga  
  
The old white tree still looks good  
And Grandmas angels got me thinking  
String up the new lights  
Brighten the cold nights  
And get those baubles blinking  
  
Chorus  
I wish you joy that never ends  
Happy times with all your friends  
Come on and hold my hips a little longer  
As we do the Christmas Conga  
Bonga bonga bonga bonga  
Do the Christmas Conga  
  
And then well put on party hats  
As the year comes to a conclusion  
Turn on the yule log  
Spike up the egg nog  
And break those resolutions  
  
Chorus  
I wish you joy that never ends  
Happy times with all your friends  
Come on and hold my hips a little longer  
As we do the Christmas Conga  
Bonga bonga bonga bonga  
Do the Christmas Conga
