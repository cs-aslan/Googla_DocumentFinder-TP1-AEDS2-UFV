A little love goes a long way  
And the little heart has a lot to say  
Loves like a song that is here to stay  
A little love goes a long long way  
Good things are for those who are willing to wait  
And when your true love comes heaven knows its great  
Give a little love and just watch it grow  
When good things happen then the heart will know  
  
Chorus  
Your heart can sing  
Loves do re mi  
Your heart can know  
Loves a b c  
Love can be what its got to be  
  
Its so easy to learn like 1 2 3  
Do re mi a b c 1 2 3  
A little love goes a long way  
A little love goes a long long way  
Just listen to what your heart can say  
Love can go stronger day by day  
A little love goes a long long way
