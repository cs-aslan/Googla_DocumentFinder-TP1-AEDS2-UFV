Feelins just lead us on  
Till we know where were goin mhmm  
  
If I told you that I loved you  
Could we slip away where the lightsre low  
And if I put my arms around you  
And held you close could you tell me no  
Well you know that Id be lyin  
If I said I was a tryin to let you know Id go  
  
Yes love take me where weve never been before  
Feelins just lead us on  
Till we know where were goin mhmm  
  
You dont know how long I wanted  
To have you where you are right now  
With you looking soft and pretty  
Aint no telling where weve found  
Now here we are together  
Too close with talkin I cant tell you no  
  
Yes love take us where weve never been before  
Feelins just lead us on  
Till we know where were goin mhmm  
  
Feelins mhmm feelins
