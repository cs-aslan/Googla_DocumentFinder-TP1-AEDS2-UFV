When April showers may come your way  
They bring the flowers that bloom in May  
So when its raining have no regrets  
Because it isnt raining rain you know  
Its raining violets  
  
And when you see clouds up on a hill  
You know theyll bring crowds of daffodils  
So just keep looking for a bluebird  
And listening for his song  
Whenever April showers come along  
  
And when you see clouds up on the hill  
You know therell be crowds of daffodils  
So just keep looking for a bluebird  
And listening for his song  
Whenever April showers come along
