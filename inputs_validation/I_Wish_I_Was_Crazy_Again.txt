I met an old friend this morning  
And I stopped him and called him by name  
I said The years havent changed you  
But he said Good Lord how youve changed  
  
So we stood there and talked on the corner  
And remembered the good times we had  
Then he asked if were happy together  
And I only smiled and I said  
  
Yes she keeps me off the streets  
And she keeps me out of trouble  
Sometimes at night Lord when I hear the wind  
I wish I was crazy again yes I wish I was crazy again  
  
Then we stopped in at a tavern  
We had us a round or two  
We called ourselves old desperados old desperados  
As old friends are likely to do  
  
We sat for a while and remembered  
Then he said Lets have just one more  
I said Id sure like to join you  
But best be goin on home  
  
Yes she keeps me off the streets  
She keeps me off the streets
