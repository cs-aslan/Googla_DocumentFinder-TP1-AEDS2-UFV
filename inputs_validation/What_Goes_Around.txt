A halfass commitment a casual act  
Shows me the decency that you lack  
Youre fucking with feelings and fucking with heads  
And live for the moment is all that youve said  
What goes around comes around  
So watch yourself cause youre falling down  
Abusing misusing youre out of control  
Your mind spirit and body will take their toll  
A slave to your senses I see nothing more  
Cause temporary pleasure is what you strive for  
Taken what youve wanted stepped on whats in your way  
But there will be a price that youll have to pay  
Easy acquaintances broken friends  
Happy now but the loser in the end  
Broken promises broken hearts  
Walk away when the pain starts  
You take whats yours you still want more  
If you only knew whats in store
