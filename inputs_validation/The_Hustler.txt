Time to get up  
Make a move  
Put the brain in gear  
Cut the groove  
Moving slow  
With a smiling face  
Never look like you want it  
Til its right in your face  
  
Im the hustler  
Playing my favorite game  
Yeah Im the hustler  
Everybody knows my name  
  
Well I can get all around you  
While I think you stand still  
The way you tell me you wont  
Lets me know that you will  
Last thing you tell them  
Is what you came here for  
Theyre never going to find out  
Til you way out the door  
cause Im the hustler  
Playing my favorite game  
Yeah Im the hustler  
Everybody knows my name  
  
You got to love the work you do  
How long it takes  
Aint important to you  
Dont care whats in it  
Loving every minute  
Every minute every hour  
Every second of the day  
Little by little  
I see it coming my way  
  
Im the hustler  
Playing my favorite game  
Yeah Im the hustler  
Everybody knows my name
