Chorus  
Yeah Im throwed off  
Aint about the money Ima blow it off  
I made my own lane lets roll lets roll  
Yeah Im going off  
Aint got a whole lot but Ima show it off  
Better recognize game lets roll lets roll  
  
Yeah now let me welcome you to my small town  
Big trucks in the yard big bucks on the wall country folks all around  
How I was raised eight oh eight drums quaking they shake that box eighty
eight  
Yeah and the dope boys hotter than hells gate but I still in the shade  
With a fold out chair a thirty pack on the back of that tailgate  
ALA BAMA Im off I might pee in the lake  
I might go to Talladega and see me a race  
And bring me case yeah Im bringing a case Im gettin throwed off  
  
Chorus  
  
And Im all the way throwed off  
Zseventy one take the bow off  
Dipped in mossy oak with a mullet Mohawk  
Yeah with a bright orange hat and a bag underneath that Chevy seat  
Yeah buddy might go off split you like a bowling ball  
Split you in my overalls  
Yeah home of the gumbo got a couple folks thatd do it to you for hundo  
And when them elephant feet rumble  
That Dixie cups gonna fall off the console  
You dont wanna have a convo and not understand that Bama slanguage  
Like hollerin aint it but I come to paint it so it wont be throwed off  
  
Chorus  
  
Im just a kid that rocks  
Im just a boy with a dream  
That bet it all with the last bill that I had hid in my socks  
Used to keep a twenty two in a shoebox  
Now I bang Beretta  
Shes 22 and I keep her in a tube top  
White trash and all take us all the way to the top and then laugh it off  
Like how the fuck did I get a catalog with more hits than a fucking jackhammer
dog  
Cause I planned it all Crimson tide standing tall  
Shit Im another lit cannon ball  
Fuck around and Im going off and Im getting throwed off  
  
Chorus
