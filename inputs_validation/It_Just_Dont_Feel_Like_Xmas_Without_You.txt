Another day another reminder that your not here with me  
I watch the snowflakes falling from the sky then I get lost in memories  
The time we tried to build a snowman  
The time we tried to count the stars  
Its crazy how we didnt know then  
That wed ever be apart  
  
I can hear the music playing  
See the lights upon the tree  
I can feel the joy in every soul  
But for me its incomplete  
And I try my best to play the part but no matter what I do  
No it just dont feel like Christmas without you you  
  
Another tear another regret boy that youre so far away  
Can it be that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day  
Remember when we took the sleigh ride  
Remember singing by the fire  
Theres to much thats in the daylight  
I keep reliving you and I  
  
I can hear the music playing  
See the lights upon the tree  
I can feel the joy in every soul  
But for me its incomplete  
And I try my best to play the part but no matter what I do  
No it just dont feel like Christmas without you

But for me its incomplete  
And I try my best to play the part but no matter what I do  
It just dont feel like Christmas  
No it just dont feel like Christmas without you ooh baby  
  
See I tried but it just aint right right without you
