Again we stalk the stage  
At mach speed we engage  
Feeding peoples rage  
The big cats left its cage  
Back in the bus again  
To catch another plane  
This behaviors quite insane  
But we do it for the fame yeah  
I lost my mind I lost all my money  
I lost my life to the Killing Road  
The road will never end  
It always starts again  
Another shows around the bend  
Another long lost friend  
Faceless as the snow  
Theres nothing special about the road  
Its just another haul  
Its just too damn long thats all yeah
