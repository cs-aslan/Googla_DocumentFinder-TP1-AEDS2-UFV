Yesterday I saw a whore  
Lookin out for more  
While she makes my body ache  
Still I walk in then I say  
  
A Well uh  
Im on the mic doin uh  
The things you like and Im uh  
Ras MG and Im uh  
Treat you right  
  
Cause all the ladies and me  
You see we both agree  
That uh Im goin down in world history well yo  
  
Whoa she makes my body ache  
And you know I live for more  
I wont flake or perpetrate  
I wont front no funky ho  
  
Dont get me wrong Im just uh  
Singin my song  
Im just like you  
I like to ball my freaks all night long  
  
Not only do I rhyme  
I also cut so nice  
And all the fightin perpetratin DJs want my slice  
Cause Im select  
  
Perpetratin DJs come and look for me  
Rock me rubadub rock and roll MC  
So sweet and so nice  
They call me delight  
  
Goahgoahgoahgoahgoahgo go  
  
Go Eric  
Think of somethin  
Sing somethin  
  
My name is Eric I have nothing to say  
Because I am not a fucking DJ  
And if you wanna come talk to me  
Then you gotta talk to my man Bradley  
Ha ha ha ha ha  
  
Oh yeah  
Hold up the lyrics  
Round in the come and I see  
Because Im not from yall  
Now man I feel it come from us  
Be yourself  
So if my lyrics are for your fuck  
Combit for it for my lone man  
See thats why yall come to see it  
My rock it come forward on the mic style  
See our kooky fuckin place  
You in our scene  
  
Uh uh elected  
My rhymes will be perfected  
The fightin MCs will be dissected and rejected  
I am the most impressive  
Aspective and progressive  
Motivating innovating chillin and digested  
  
Its obvious as ever  
It will be specialized  
If your trying to proclaim uh  
It cant be compromised  
I am a fresh MC  
As you can plainly see  
You wont regret a dj fresh until you soon agree  
So take a seat and feel the beat  
Of course it is okay uh uh  
  
Yes I still rock MC Not Judgement Day  
Yo Youre no jumpin Jay  
Thats right We outta here  
5000 G 5000 G  
We outta here we outta here  
Peace  
Peace nothing but peace and unity  
Seen love and no fight can go in the middle  
Say  
  
All right
