Im not part of your elite  
Im just alright  
Class structure waving colors  
Bleeding from my throat  
Not subservient to you Im just alright  
Down classed by the powers that be  
Give me loss of hope  
Cast outburied in a hole  
Struck downforcing me to fall  
Destroyedgiving up the fight  
I know Im not alright  
Whats my price and will you pay it if its alright  
Take it from my dignity  
Waste it until its dead  
Throw me back into the gutter  
Cause its alright  
Find another pleasure fucker  
Drag them down to hell
