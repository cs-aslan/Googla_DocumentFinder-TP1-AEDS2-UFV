Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning in the beginning  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning long time ago  
He saw an animal that liked to growl  
Big furry paws and he liked to howl  
Great big furry back and furry hair  
Ah think Ill call it a bear  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning in the beginning  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning long time ago  
He saw an animal up on a hill  
Chewing up so much grass until she was filled  
He saw milk coming out but he didnt know how  
Ah think Ill call it a cow  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning in the beginning  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning long time ago  
He saw an animal that liked to snort  
Horns on his head and they werent too short  
It looked like there wasnt nothing that he couldnt pull  
Ah think Ill call it a bull  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning in the beginning  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning long time ago  
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail  
Real dirty face and a curly tail  
He wasnt too small and he wasnt too big  
Ah think Ill call it a pig  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning in the beginning  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning long time ago  
Next animal that he did meet  
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet  
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep  
Ah think Ill call it a sheep  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning in the beginning  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning long time ago  
He saw an animal as smooth as glass  
Slithering his way through the grass  
Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake
