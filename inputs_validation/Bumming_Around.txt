I got an ol slouch hat  
Got my roll on my shoulder  
Im as free as a breeze  
An Ill do as I please  
Just a bummin around  
  
Got a million friends  
Dont feel any older  
Ive got nothin to lose  
Not even the blues  
Just a bummin around  
  
Whenever worries start  
To botherin me  
I grab my coat my ol slouch hat  
Hit the trail again you see  
  
I aint got a dime  
Dont care where Im goin  
Where Im as free as a breeze  
An Ill do as I please  
Just a bummin around  
  
Ive got nothin to lose  
Not even the blues  
Just a bummin around  
  
Whenever worries start  
To botherin me  
I grab my coat my ol slouch hat  
Hit the trail again you see  
  
I aint got a dime  
Dont care where Im goin  
Cause Im as free as a breeze  
An Ill do as I please  
Just a bummin around  
Just bummin around
