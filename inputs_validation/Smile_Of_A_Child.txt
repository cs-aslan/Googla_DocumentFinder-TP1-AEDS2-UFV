Chorus  
Theres no song like a love song  
love song  
No love like true love  
true love  
No smile  
Like the smile of a child  
  
  
Be like a child  
Welcome each day one at a time  
Dont be a afraid  
do be do do be do  
To say youre sorry when youre wrong  
Be a better you  
Be like a child  
  
  
Be like a child  
Dont loose yourself in a world of cares  
Let yourself go  
do be do do be do  
Oh be happy and be loved  
Be a better you  
Be like a child  
  
  
Chorus  
  
  
Be like a child  
Welcome each day  
And dont loose yourself
