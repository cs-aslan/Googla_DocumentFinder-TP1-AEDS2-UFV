Thank youthis is Wes Johnson comin live from the streets of the ATL  
Gettin the view of the public about the Brian Nichols case  
  
Excuse me miss whats your outlook  
  
Well I personally think its very sad that someone decided to kill someone  
Because they dont wanna take responsibility for what theyve done  
And for this to happen to the courthouse  
It just doesnt feel safe anymore
