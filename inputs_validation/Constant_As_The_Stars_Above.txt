Constant as the stars above  
Always know that you are loved  
And my love shining in you  
Will help you make your dreams come true  
Will help your dreams come true  
  
The lamb lies down and rests its head  
On its mothers down in bed  
Dolphin plays in the moonlights glow  
And butterfly dreams of a violet rose  
Dreams of a violet rose  
  
Ill cradle you in my arms tonight  
A sun embraces the moonlight  
The clouds will carry us off tonight  
Our dreams will run deep like the sea  
Our dreams will run deep like the sea  
  
Constant as the stars above  
Always know that you are loved  
And my love shining in you  
Will help you make your dreams come true  
Will help your dreams come true
