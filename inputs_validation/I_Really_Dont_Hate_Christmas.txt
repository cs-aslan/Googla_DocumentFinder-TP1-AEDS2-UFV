You see Valentines is torture  
And my birthday is a mess  
New Years is a lot of noise  
And Arbor Days a pest  
Halloweens a horror  
But I guess I must confess  
That I really dont hate Christmas  
  
You see Flag Day is infernal  
April Fools is just a bore  
Mardi Gras a waste  
Unless you own a candy store  
All these other holidays  
I can admit that I abhor  
But I really dont hate Christmas  
  
Now it isnt that I like it  
At the most I feel ambivalence  
But should I really just destroy it  
Ill admit that Im still on the fence  
It makes me tense  
  
From the evil scientist community  
Im sure to get ejected  
But for Christmas I can seem to summon  
Any true invective  
Because what is there to hate  
I mean its really so subjective  
Though I really dont hate Christmas  
  
I hate puppy dogs and kittens  
I hate flowers in the Spring  
I even hate the sunshine  
And the birdies when they sing  
I can work up animosity for almost anything  
Tell me why I dont hate Christmas  
  
Though my childhood was atrocious  
Christmas never was that bad you see  
So the best that I can muster  
Is complete and total apathy  
Whats wrong with me  
  
How can I prove that Im  
An evil villain worth his salt  
When with a holiday so jolly  
I cant even find a fault  
If I didnt feel ambiguous  
Id launch a big assault  
But I really dont hate Christmas  
  
 Ah what the heck Kick line  
  
No I really  
No I really dont hate Christmas  
  
I have an intense burning indifference
