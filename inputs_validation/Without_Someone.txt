I watch the cars move I watch the lights up on the window  
I walk along the street Im only thinking of you  
I watch the clock staring from the wall it hardly moves at all  
Its you Im waiting for  
Without someone I can depend on  
Im lost without someone  
As I go on I hope youre remembering  
Im lost without someone  
All alone no one around I watch the shadows falling faster  
The city lights begin to glow and then I start to realize  
I count the hours as they slip away into another day  
Wondering where youll stay  
Without someone I can depend on  
Im lost without someone  
As I go on I hope youre remembering  
Im lost without someone  
Still watching the cars move still watching the lights  
Upon the window  
Im walking down the street Im only thinking of you  
I hear the night as it calls to me it plays a symphony  
It says youre gone from me  
Without someone I can depend on  
Im lost without someone  
As I go on I hope youre remembering  
Im lost without someone
