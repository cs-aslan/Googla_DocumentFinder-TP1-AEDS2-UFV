If I could change the things Ive done  
Would I be the only one  
To with again if only I could take your pain away  
And think of better better things to say  
The highest price Id gladly pay  
For you to live just golden days golden days golden days  
So celebrate the moment now have all that you desire  
Chorus  
Well keep each other warm together well weather the storm  
The children are dying and nobodys crying  
Theres got to be something out there someone who cares  
Got to be something out there  
Give me real life the worry and the strife  
Ill throw it out of the window to the dogs below  
So come with me Ill guide you through wardrobes of fantasy  
And treasure chests of what could be  
A world without anxiety  
A legacy of golden days golden days golden days  
Leave it all behind the blind leading the blind  
Have all that you desire  
Gotta be gotta be someone out there  
Lets break the rules scattering the jewels  
Of joy amongst ourselves  
The lonely lonely of the shelves  
Feel good about yourself Ill drink to your health  
Have all that you desire  
Chorus  
Im looking for something and I dont know what it is
