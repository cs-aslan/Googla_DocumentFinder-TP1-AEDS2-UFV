Hearts of darkness  
Falling down  
Its raining stones  
Fate is driving  
Now theres no meat  
On the bone  
Theres a hurricane coming  
What a bitter pill  
Theres a distant drumming  
Coming over the hill  
She took everything  
Got my jack in her hand  
I was born so now  
Im just a fighting man  
A fighting man  
  
Cold Wild Turkey  
Drives a spike right through my brain  
Bar room mothers  
Waiting for the gravy train  
  
Its a cold wind a blowing  
Gone out of control  
Time is a running  
Touching my very soul  
She took everything  
Got my jack in her hand  
I was born so now  
Im just a fighting man  
A fighting man  
  
Solo  
  
Ashes to ashes  
Trash is still trash  
Its only a moment now  
And were gone in a flash  
  
Silver lining  
Wheres the man  
With the master plan  
Hearts of darkness  
Spreading out  
All across this land  
  
Theres a hurricane acoming  
What a bitter pill  
Theres a distant drumming  
Coming over the hill  
She took everything  
Got my jack in her hand  
I was born so now  
Im just a fighting man  
A fighting man  
  
She took everything  
Got my jack in her hand  
I was born so now  
Im just a fighting man  
A fighting man  
Just a common man  
Just a common man
