Whats wrong with the world today  
Things just got to get better  
Sho aint what the leaders say  
Maybe we should write a letter  
  
Dear Mr Man  
We dont understand  
Why poor people keep struggling  
But you dont lend a helping hand  
  
Matthew 55 say  
The meek shall inherit the earth  
We wanna be down that way  
But you been tripping since the day of youre birth  
  
Who said that to kill is a sin  
Then started every single war  
That youre people been in  
Who said that water  
Is a precious commodity  
Then dropped a big old black oil slick  
In the deep blue sea  
  
Who told me Mr Man  
That working round the clock  
Would buy me a big house in the hood  
With cigarette ads on every block  
  
Who told me Mr Man  
That I got a right to moan  
How bout this big ol hole in the ozone  
  
Whats wrong with the world today  
Things just got to get better  
Dear Mr Man we dont understand  
Maybe we should write a letter  
  
Listen aint no sense in voting  
Same song with a different name  
Might not be in the back of the bus  
But it sho feel just the same  
Aint nothin fair about welfare  
Aint no assistance in AIDS  
Aint nothing affirmative about youre actions  
Till the people get paid  
  
Youre thousand years are up  
Now you got to share the land  
Section one the fourteenth Amendment says  
No state shall deprive any person  
Of life liberty or property  
Without due process of law  
  
Mr Man  
We want to end this letter with 3 words  
We tired you all
