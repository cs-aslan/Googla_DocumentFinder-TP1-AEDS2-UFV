I dont know just what to make of this world  
My friends are wonderin too  
I got some doubt about the state of this world  
N what were gonna do  
  
All I know is you  
N the feelin I feel is the truth  
Im in love with you  
N I dont need to figure it out  
  
Chorus  
All I know now is that  
I got No Doubt About Love  
Hesitation is out  
Now that I got No Doubt About Love  
  
Youre never sure about your place in this world  
Or what you need to survive  
Some people say that  
What it takes in this world  
Is constant compromise  
  
But your loves so fine  
And I must have done somethin so right  
To be in love with you  
And I aint givin up what I got  
  
Chorus  
  
Can it be  
Certainty  
Has taken ahold in my life  
Imagine my surprise  
No doubt Big Love has arrived  
Every day I thank God Im alive  
  
Chorus
