When you do know what you dont know  
When you cant tell what you do know  
And it gets so very hard to see  
  
And if you werent expecting trouble  
And I burst your little bubble  
Well Im sorry babe but you can count on me  
  
I know I get a little crazy sometimes  
I know you think Im driving you out of my mind  
I know you love me and I dont make it easy but you can count on me  
  
You can count on me  
To do the wrong thing at the right time  
Say the right thing at the wrong time  
I have a hard time with my synchronicity  
  
And I know I should remember  
Never never lose my temper  
But you know it isnt easy being me  
  
Im always early or too late  
I know I often make you wait  
I dont mean to get you in a state  
No you can count on me darling  
You can count on me  
  
And if I seem to see the hours go so quick like summer flowers  
I have a problem with the bright side  
You can see  
So if I seem a little stateless sometimes  
Rest assured that Im just unsure of just where I should be  
And dont mistake me for faithless no no  
I promise you now you can count on you can count on me  
  
And so I get a little crazy sometimes  
But theres so much of this world that I want to see  
And if you want to come with me now  
I wont let you down  
No you can count on me
