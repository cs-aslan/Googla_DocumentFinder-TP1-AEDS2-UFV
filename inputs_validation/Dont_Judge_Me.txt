I dont wanna go there  
We should never go there  
Why you wanna go there  
I guess I gotta go there  
Youre hearing rumors about me  
And you cant stomach the thought  
Of someone touching my body  
When you so close to my heart  
I wont deny what they saying  
Because most of it is true  
But it was all before I fell for you  
  
So please babe  
So please dont judge me  
And I wont judge you  
Cause it could get ugly  
Before it gets beautiful  
Please dont judge me  
And I wont judge you  
And if you love me  
Then let it be beautiful  
Let it be beautifuuul  let it be beautiful  
Let it be beautifuuul  let it be beautiful  
  
Everything I say right now  
Is gonna be use in another fight  
And Ive been through this so many times  
Can we change the subject  
You gonna start asking me questions like  
Was she attractive was she an actress   
Baby the fact is youre hearing rumours about me  
And saw some pictures online  
Saying things they got you so angry  
Making you wish you were mine  
Before we start talking crazy  
Saying some things well regret  
Can we just slow it down and press reset  
  
Youre beautiful  
So babe  
So please dont judge me  
And I wont judge you  
Cause it could get ugly  
Before it gets beautiful  
Please dont judge me  
And I wont judge you  
And if you love me  
Then let it be beautiful  
  
Just let the past  
Just be the past  
And focus on things  
That are gonna make us laugh  
Take me as I am not who I was  
Ill promise Ill be the one that you can trust  
  
So please  
So please dont judge me  
And I wont judge you  
Cause it could get ugly  
Before it gets beautiful  
So please dont judge me  
And I wont judge you  
And if you love me  
Then let it be beautiful  
Let it be beautifuuul  let it be  
Let it be beautifuuul  aye let it be beautiful yeah yeah yeah  
  
I dont wanna go there baby  
We should never go there
