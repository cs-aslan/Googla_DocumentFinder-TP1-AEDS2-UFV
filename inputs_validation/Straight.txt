You sleep better when youre  
You eat better when youre  
You sing better when youre  
You need me more when youre straight  
Is this the weekend  
Is that your girlfriend  
Shes green and innocent  
You smoke her like shes incense  
Shes smilin  
  
Ill wait til summers over  
Ill love you through October  
Ill give you everything  
Ill trade you anything for her  
Stay straight for me  
Stay straight for me  
Stay straight for me  
Stay straight for me
