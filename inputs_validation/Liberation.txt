Take my hand  
Ive changed my mind again  
Really I believed it true  
That all who fell in love were foolish  
But I was wrong  
Ive learned that lesson well  
All the way back home at midnight  
You were sleeping on my shoulder  
  
Take my hand  
Dont think of obligations  
Now right now  
Your love is liberation  
  
To free in me  
The trust I never dared  
I always thought the risk too great  
But suddenly I dont hesitate so  
  
Take my hand  
Dont think of complications  
Now right now  
Your love is liberation  
Liberation  
  
Ta ra ra ra ra ra  
Ta ra ra ra ra ra  
  
The night the stars  
Our light shone through the dark  
All the way back home at midnight  
You were sleeping on my shoulder  
  
Take my hand  
Dont think of hesitation  
Now right now  
Your love is liberation  
Liberation  
  
Ta ra ra ra ra ra  
  
Ta ra ra ra ra ra  
  
Back home at midnight  
All the way back home at midnight
