I never seen you looking so bad my funky one  
You tell me that your superfine mind has come undone  
  
Chorus  
Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you my friend  
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again  
When the demon is at your door  
In the morning it wont be there no more  
Any major dude will tell you  
  
Have you ever seen a squonks tears Well look at mine  
The people on the street have all seen better times  
  
Chorus  
  
I can tell you all I know the where to go the what to do  
You can try to run but you cant hide from whats inside of you  
  
Chorus
