These clouds arent going nowhere baby  
Rain keeps coming down  
I just thought Id try to call you baby  
for you got too far out of town  
And I hope that you get this message  
That Im leaving for you  
Cause I hate that you left without hearing  
The words that I needed you to  
  
And hope you find it  
What youre looking for  
And I hope its everything you dreamed your life could be  
And so much more  
And I hope youre happy  
Wherever you are  
I wanted you to know that  
And nothings gonna change that  
And I hope you find it  
  
Am I supposed to hang around and wait forever  
Last words that I said  
But that was nothing but a broken heart talking baby  
You know that wasnt what I meant  
Call me up let me know that you got this message  
That Im leaving for you  
Cause I hate that you left without hearing  
The words that I needed you to  
  
And I hope you find it  
What youre looking for  
And I hope its everything you dreamed your life could be  
And so much more  
And I hope youre happy  
Wherever you are  
I wanted you to know that  
And nothings gonna change that  
And I hope you find it  
  
Whatever it is out there  
That you miss it here  
  
And I hope you find it  
What youre looking for  
And I hope its everything you dreamed your life could be  
And so much more  
And I hope youre happy  
Wherever you are  
I wanted you to know that  
And nothings gonna change that  
  
No no no  
And I hope you find it  
I hope you find it
