The sea it swells like a sore head  
And the night it is aching  
Two lovers lie with no sheets on their bed  
And the day it is breaking  
  
On rainy days we go swimming out  
On rainy days swimming in the sound  
On rainy days we go swimming out  
  
Youre in my mind all of the time  
I know thats not enough  
If the sky can crack there must be some way back  
For love and only love  
  
Car alarm wont let you back to sleep  
Youre kept awake dreaming someone elses dream  
Coffee is cold but itll get you through  
Compromise thats nothing new to you  
  
Lets see colors that have never been seen  
Lets go to places no one else has been  
  
Youre in my mind all of the time  
I know thats not enough  
But if the sky can crack there must be some way back  
To love and only love  
  
Electrical storm  
Electrical storm  
Electrical storm  
Baby dont cry  
  
Its hot as hell honey in this room  
Sure hope the weather will break soon  
The air is heavy heavy as a truck  
We need the rain to wash away our bad luck  
  
Well if the sky can crack there must be some way back  
For love and only love  
  
Electrical storm  
Electrical storm  
Electrical storm  
  
Baby dont cry  
Baby dont cry  
Baby dont cry  
Baby dont cry
