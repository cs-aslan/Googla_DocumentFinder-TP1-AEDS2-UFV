Shes so strange  
And she wore a black mustache  
And pilfered all the petty cash  
She went to Birmingham  
Shell soon be in the can  
  
Shes so cruel  
And she knew what just what to do  
And while the cats were all sniffing glue  
They played their silly games  
And now theyll take the blame  
  
What shed done  
And she didnt know quite what she did  
And they told her that she better had  
So now she starts to cry  
Without a reason why  
  
Shes so poor  
And only now shes looking back  
Sees her story on a paperback  
What will become of her  
Theres not much left for her
