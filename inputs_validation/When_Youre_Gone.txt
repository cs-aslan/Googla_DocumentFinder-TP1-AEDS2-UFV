Well look at me the guy whos got it all  
Tryin to read my own writing on the wall  
Not happy til the sadness comes  
To keep me company  
Oh but what becomes of fools who love like me  
  
Whos gonna dry my tears  
When Im crying  
Whos gonna hold my hand  
When Im dying  
Whos gonna set me right when  
Everything is wrong  
Whos gonna love me  
When youre gone  
  
Sure as winter goes and comes around again  
I will be my own undoing in the end  
Ill find the answers Ive been searching for  
In your goodbye kiss  
Cause I dont deserve you and you dont deserve this  
  
Whos gonna dry my tears  
When Im crying  
And whos gonna hold my hand  
When Im dying  
Whos gonna set me right when  
Everything is wrong  
Yeah whos gonna love me  
When youre gone  
  
Never happy til the darkness comes  
And rains down on me  
Down on me  
  
And whos gonna dry my tears  
When Im crying  
And whos gonna hold my hand  
When Im dying  
Whos gonna set me right when  
Everything is wrong  
Whos gonna love me  
When youre gone  
  
Whos gonna love me when youre gone  
Baby when youre gone  
Yeah whos gonna love me  
When youre gone  
Whos gonna love me when youre gone  
Whos gonna love me
