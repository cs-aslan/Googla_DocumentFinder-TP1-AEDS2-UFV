Pour shame all over us  
Harden into a crust  
Cement  
Forget the glamor and  
Mumble a jackhammer  
Under your breath  
Hide your face in the curtains  
Better unsaid so close  
And it rolls off the tongue  
Almost  
The world expects the pose  
Perfectly natural  
Loosen up  
Smearing wet concrete  
And swearing youll never be  
Caught  
At your weakest etched in stone  
And were frozen here peeking  
Almost sweet talk caffeine  
Make contact  
Up to my neck  
I confess in quicksand  
But its so easy for you  
Theres always one thing  
Do you have something to tell me  
Say something  
Anything  
Im warning you  
Im warning you  
Im fucking you  
Im warning you  
Relax  
Its just a phase  
Youll grow out of it  
Believe anything anyone ever tells you  
Its not funny anymore  
Its thing you hate the most  
The thing you hate the most  
The thing you hate ALMOST
