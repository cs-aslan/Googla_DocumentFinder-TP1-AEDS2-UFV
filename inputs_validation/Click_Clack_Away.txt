You got weapons of mass seduction

Or give it all then I give you more

Winter summer fall April May and June  
You shot me through the heart but I dont have a wound  
You got a good aim cause I couldve sworn I moved  
When it comes to relationships I dont have a clue  
  
Love at first sight I dont know I zoom  
You put a hit on me ba da bing ba da boom  
If this is pain let me hurry up and let me suffer  
What doesnt kill me should make my love tougher
