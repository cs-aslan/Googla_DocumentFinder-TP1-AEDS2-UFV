Verse 1  
Evil is but a shadow  
That always accompanies the good  
You can try to have a world  
A world without the shadow  
But itll be a dark dark and cold place world  
Cause it would be a world a world without light too  
Oh ohh oh  
  
Verse 2  
The lights of nature  
The light of the true  
The light of silence  
The light of all I do  
The brigter it shines from the mountain  
The more evil hides in its hole  
Enjoy soo hard to defeat us  
A world starting to lose your control  
Oh ohh oh  
Trol lose your control  
Trol lose your control  
Trol lose your control  
Trol lose your control  
  
Bridge

Howd it get to be so obvious  
Ill have fun  
We wont stop  
Well let it fucking drop  
We wont stop oh  
Ill have fun  
  
Outro

A shadow in this world  
Evil is but a shadow  
A shadow in this world  
Evil is but a shadow  
A shadow in this world
