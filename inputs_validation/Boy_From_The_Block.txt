Chorus  
Im the boy from the block boy from the block block  
Im the boy from the block boy from the block block  
Im the boy from the block boy from the block block  
Im the boy from the block boy from the block block  
With the very large knots  
Im the boy from the block boy from the block block  
Im the boy from the block boy from the block block  
Im the boy from the block boy from the block block  
Im the boy from the block boy from the block block  
With the very large knots  
  
I pull up in that Spyder strapped up like McGyver  
Should have brought my phantom na but Im mad at my driver  
He so fuckin turnt up ridin on auto pilot smokin kush and smilin  
He drinkin while he drivin  
Gucci please excuse me  huh all my goons got jewelry on em  
All my niggas booked up paper they get it on there own  
I dont think you know me homie I suggest you leave me alone  
I got so much jewelry on that I think I need a clone  
I pull up to the traffic light icy as a blood light  
Shinin like a flash light I might damage ya eye sight  
Gucci got that real ice dont it look real nice  
I dont want your girlfriend homie but my bitch might  
  
Chorus  
  
Now straight to the channel shop thats how she shop  
500 for the flip flops cause they aint Reebok  
Im the boy from the block with the very large knots  
Gotta spot in the hood no sofa just pot  
Im hot so hot stand next get shocked  
I got Caucasian neighbors thats just how I rock  
If you talkin to me tell me somethin that I wanna know  
If she aint got no money know you gotta have some doe  
Then she ask me for a drank so I bought a bottle  
She was flexin really hard now she flexin harder  
You a bitch one more bitch I only fuck with starters  
So if you aint a dime piece aint no need to bother  
  
Chorus  
  
I want the money I smell like a pocket full of hundreds  
A whole bag full of Kush I been buckin since a youngin  
I know you need a man right now because you strugglin  
So if he isnt helpin then theres no need for discussion  
In Houston Texas I can spend fifty thousand on a Monday  
I got fifty woman with me fifty more that aint comin  
My pocket do the conversation make all the decisions  
I only fuck with bad bitches cause Im very picky  
He cant buy a drink so he dont deserve ya digits  
Im polar bear laflare wrist and ear is very frigged  
My charm big as a midget  
I give yo ass the business  
So if you got yo swag right you know that you can get it
