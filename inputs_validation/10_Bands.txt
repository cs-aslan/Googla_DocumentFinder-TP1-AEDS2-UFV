Verse 2  
I been in the crib with the phones off  
I been at the house taking no calls  
I done hit the stride got my shit going  
In the six cooking with the wrist motion  
Drapes closed I dont know what time it is  
Im still awake I gotta shine this year  
I could never ever let the streets down  
Havent left the condo in a week now

Verse 3  
I been on a mission havent left the condo  
This that OvO that SZN this that new Toronto  
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina  
How much I make off the deal how the fuck should I know  
All my watches always timeless you can keep the diamonds  
Treating diamonds of Atlanta like its king of diamonds  
Take a flick I look like Meechy look like blue DaVinci  
I treat V Live like its 07 in Magic City  
Man I told my city Id be gone till November then November came  
Then I came right back on my worst behav  
6 God put both hands together thats amazing grace  
6 God selfish with the love I need all the praise  
Woo  
They got me feeling like the one again  
Woo  
They got me feeling like the one again
