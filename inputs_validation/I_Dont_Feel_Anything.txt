I dont feel anything what was I worried for  
I dont feel love or hate or anything that I felt before  
Why was I so afraid of seeing you again  
Cause its the strangest thing I dont feel anything  
How I must have loved you once upon a time  
And I cant seem to feel emotion now of any kind  
Why was I so afraid of seeing you again  
Cause its the strangest thing I dont feel anything  
  
You look the same as always times been good to you  
But I must confess that time has done a few things for me too  
Why was I so afraid  
But its the strangest thing I dont feel anything
