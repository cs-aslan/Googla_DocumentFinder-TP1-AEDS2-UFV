Ive got the fever poison in my veins  
My mind aint working right  
I know the answer the way to ease this pain  
Only got myself to fight  
I can see clearly but choose to be blind  
A slave to desire  
Holding me scolding me changing your mind  
Youre like playing with fire  
  
Chorus  
I need you  
I want to stay on this soul motin ride  
There is no danger when youre here by my side  
  
Given some distance just a little time  
Right and wrong seems clear  
But my sense of reason is nothing but unkind  
Every time that youre near  
Over and over I say to myself  
Ooh shes only playing  
Ten thousand reasons to find someone else  
Still I hear myself saying  
  
Chorus  
  
Im out here on the edge  
And I know whats in store  
It should be over and done just let go and run  
But Ive tasted too much  
Nothings the same anymore  
  
Chorus
