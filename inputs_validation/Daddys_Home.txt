Youre my love  
Youre my angel  
Youre the girl of my dreams  
And Id like to thank you  
For waiting patiently  
  
Daddys home  daddys home  to stay  
  
How Ive waited for this moment  
To be by your side  
Your best friend wrote and told me  
You had tear drops in your eyes  
  
Daddys home  daddys home  to stay  
  
It wasnt on a Sunday  
Monday and Tuesday went by  
It wasnt on a Tuesday afternoon  
All I could do was cry  
But I made a promise  
That you treasure  
And I made it back home to you  
  
How Ive waited for this moment  
To be by your side  
Your best friend wrote and told me  
You had tear drops in your eyes  
  
Daddys home  daddys home  to stay  
Daddys home  to stay  
Im not a thousand miles away
