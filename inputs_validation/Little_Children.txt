Were living in a worried world  
A world thats full of fears  
But theres one hopeful peace eternal  
I hope that its very near  
  
Little children are the hope of the world  
So guide them day and night be sure you teach them right  
You can teach them by the things you do and say  
The way you live today the way you pray  
  
Suffer the little children to come unto me  
For such is the kingdom of heaven God made it plain to see  
Little children are the hope of the world  
Se help us teach them Lord to walk with Thee  
  
Suffer the little children to come unto me  
Such is the kingdom of heaven God made it plain to see  
Little children are the hope of the world  
Se help us teach them Lord to walk with Thee
