anatano yume ni watashi wo tamoteru  
Can you hold me in your dreams  
watashi wo kanjiru koto ga dekiruno  
Watashi ga anata wo kanjiru youni  
Can you feel me like I feel you  
anatano yume ni watashi wo tamoteru  
Can you hold me in your dreams  
anatano yume ni watashi wo tamoteru  
Can you hold me in your dreams  
watashi wo kanjiru koto ga dekiruno  
Watashi ga anata wo kanjiru youni  
Can you feel me like I feel you  
Goodbye mother earth  
Goodgoodbye mother earth  
Can you feel me like I feel you  
I dont want to kill time  
I want it to live  
Im not wasting this life  
Im letting it in  
You  
Just rip off the planet  
And take what you want  
Im  
Coming to get you  
If you give up  
Beautiful destination  
Whats it worth  
Beautiful destination  
Goodbye mother earth  
I  
Am all that surrounds you  
The earth and the sky  
You  
Youre the mouth and the money  
Thats bleeding me dry  
Why  
I am not a spirit of the world  
I heal the spirit of the world  
I am not a spirit of the world  
Goodbye mother earth
