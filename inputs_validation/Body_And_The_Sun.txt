Verse  
Its a shame how winter came too soon  
Tried to love you but the love falls too  
Should we let it go let it go let it go  
  
Chorus  
Ive been thinking bout you  
Youve been thinking bout me  
All the things that weve done  
Oh how I miss your body and the sun  
Ive been thinking bout you  
Youve been thinking bout me  
We were nothing but fun  
Oh how I miss your body and the sun
