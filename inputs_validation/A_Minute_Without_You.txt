Well I woke up this morning  
And the night had been so long  
Seems that I had had my mind on you  
Well the day it has begun  
And I cant get a minute  
Cant get a minute without you  
Youre always on my mind  
Youre always in my head  
And I cant live  
I cant live another day without you  
  
Chorus  
Cause when the minutes seem like hours and the hours seem like days  
Then a week goes byyou know it takes my breath away  
All the minutes in the world could never take your place  
Theres onethousandfourhundredforty hours in my day  
  
Ive been trying to call you all day  
Cause I got so many things that I want to say  
Im going crazy cause all my thoughts are filled with you  
Theres got to be some way I can get through to you oh  
  
Chorus  
  
I cant keep myself from thinking about you  
Its because I love you and I know that its true whoa  
Ill call it desperation  
Cant you see it in my eyes  
That I want be with you until the sun falls from the sky  
  
Chorus x2
