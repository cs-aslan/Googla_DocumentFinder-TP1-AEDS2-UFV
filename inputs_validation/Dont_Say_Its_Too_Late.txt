It doesnt take much to learn  
when the bridges that you burn  
Leave you stranded feeling alone  
It doesnt take much to cry  
when youre living in a lie  
And deceiving that someone who cares  
If I could turn back the time  
I would put you first in my life  
  
And I would risk it all for you  
to prove my love is true  
Ill build a wall around my heart  
that would only break a part for you  
Can change the way I feel  
so tell me whats the deal  
Dont say dont say its too late  
  
And now the hills are getting hard to climb  
Im runnin out of time  
my decisions are pending on you  
And I will accept the blame  
for burnin out the flame  
Hoping the story will twist once again  
If I could turn back the time  
I would put you first in my life  
  
And I would risk it all for you  
to prove my love is true  
Ill build a wall around my heart  
that would only break a part for you  
Can change the way I feel  
so tell me whats the deal  
Dont say dont say its too late  
  
Now Im layin it all on the line for you  
  
And I would risk it all for you  
to prove my love is true  
Ill build a wall around my heart  
that would only break a part for you  
Can change the way I feel  
so tell me whats the deal  
Dont say dont say its too late
