Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels  
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields  
In sixtyfive I was seventeen and running up oneonone  
I dont know where Im running now Im just running on  
  
Running onrunning on empty  
Running onrunning blind  
Running onrunning into the sun  
But Im running behind  
  
Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive  
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive  
In sixtynine I was twentyone and I called the road my own  
I dont know when that road turned into the road Im on  
  
Running onrunning on empty  
Running onrunning blind  
Running onrunning into the sun  
But Im running behind  
  
Everyone I know everywhere I go  
People need some reason to believe  
I dont know about anyone but me  
If it takes all night thatll be all right  
If I can get you to smile before I leave  
  
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels  
I dont know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels  
I look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through  
Looking into their eyes I see them running too  
  
Running onrunning on empty  
Running onrunning blind  
Running onrunning into the sun  
But Im running behind  
  
Honey you really tempt me  
You know the way you look so kind  
Id love to stick around but Im running behind  
You know I dont even know what Im hoping to find  
Running into the sun but Im running behind
