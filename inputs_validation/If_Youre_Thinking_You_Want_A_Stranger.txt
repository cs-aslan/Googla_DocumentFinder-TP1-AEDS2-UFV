Lately youve been showin all the signs  
Of a woman with someone else on her mind  
Its not your fault  
Some nights Ive left you alone  
And if youre thinking you want a stranger  
Theres one coming home  
  
Chorus  
If youre thinking you want a stranger  
Ill soon be there  
Youre gonna see a change in me  
This time I swear  
No more late nights  
Comin in at daylight  
And no more doin you wrong  
And if youre thinking you want a stranger  
Theres one coming home  
  
Bought you a silk gown and perfume today  
Picked up some roses and champagne on the way  
Oh I called to ask you to put some soft music on  
Cause if youre thinking you want a stranger  
Theres one coming home  
  
Chorus  
  
If youre thinking you want a stranger  
Theres one coming home
