The middle of December aint the time to be alone  
Its just too close to Christmas  
And too far to go home  
I ran in to a friend of a friend  
Standing in checkout line  
She said Ive spent too much already  
And theres gifts I just cant find  
I walked her home and when she opened up her door  
Im not sure what happened then  
Guess magic took its course  
  
Blame it on the mistletoe  
Cause what happened here nobody knows  
How could something simple as a kiss  
Change my holiday like this  
And we held each other all night long  
And we fell asleep to a Christmas song  
Playin on the radio  
Blame it on the mistletoe  
  
I woke up she was wrappin gifts beneath the tree  
She said I know its early so I thought Id let you sleep  
Then she insisted I get up and take a look outside  
Hey sleepyhead it must have snowed at least a foot last night  
Thats when I saw it hangin up above my head  
She threw her arms around my neck  
Laughin as she said  
  
Blame it on the mistletoe  
Cause what happened here nobody knows  
How could something simple as a kiss  
Change my holiday like this  
And we held each other all night long  
And we fell asleep to a Christmas song  
Playin on the radio  
Blame it on the mistletoe
