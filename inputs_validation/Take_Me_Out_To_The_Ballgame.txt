Take me out to the ballgame  
Take me out with the crowd  
Buy me some peanuts and crackerjack  
I dont care if I never get back  
  
With our root root root for the home team  
If they dont win its a shame  
For its one two three strikes  
Youre out at the old ballgame  
  
Take me out to the ballgame  
Take me out with the crowd  
Buy me some peanuts and crackerjack  
I dont care if I never get back  
  
With our root root root for the home team  
If they dont win its a shame  
For its one two three strikes  
Youre out at the old ballgame
