So many years have gone by  
Always strong tried not to cry  
Never felt like I needed any man  
To comfort me in life  
But Im all made up today  
A veil upon my face  
But no father stands beside me  
To give this bride away  
  
Well Im standing in the chapel  
Wearing my white dress  
I have waited for this moment  
With tears of happiness  
Here I leave behind my past  
By taking the chance  
Ive finally found the right man  
  
Thoughts racing fast through my mind  
As Im gazing down the aisle  
That my future will mend the memories  
Torn between father and child  
  
My emotions overload  
Cause there is no hand to hold  
Theres no shoulder here to lean on  
Im walking all on my own  
  
Here I go  
  
Now Im standing at four corners  
To have and to hold  
Now my love you stand beside me  
To walk lifes winding road  
And I owe it all to you  
For taking that chance  
Youve shown me theres a right man  
Cause I never knew the right man  
  
Well Im standing in the chapel  
Ready to confess  
That Ive waited for this moment  
With tears of happiness  
Now I leave behind my past  
By taking the chance  
Whoa  
  
Well Im standing at four corners  
To have and to hold  
Now my love you stand beside me  
To walk lifes winding road  
And I owe it all to you  
For taking the chance  
  
And one day my little girl  
Will reach out her hand  
Shell know I found the right man
