If you think you can depend on me  
Your right you can  
If you think that Im in love with you  
Your right I am  
But nuthin lasts forever  
All good things must end  
And its only a matter of time  
Day after forever  
Im out that door  
One way or the other  
To return never more  
Dont count on me baby  
For I will be gone  
Day after forever  
Honey youre on your own  
If you think I love you more than life  
Youre right I do  
If you think your in my heart and soul  
Your right its true  
But I must leave you someday  
Although I worship you  
And its only a matter of time  
Day after forever  
Im out that door  
One way or the other  
To return never more  
Dont count on me baby  
For I will be gone  
Day after forever  
Honey youre on your own  
Day after forever  
Honey youre on your own
