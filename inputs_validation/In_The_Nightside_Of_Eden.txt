Divided we stand in the light of a frozen sun  
Cursing the Gods we have become  
We steal the fire from a sacred heart  
And bleed the wine unholy  
We fall in love with the serpents song  
And fear nothing  
  
In the nightside of Eden  
Were born again   
Dead  
  
Forever we are  
Forever weve been  
Forever will be crucified to a dream  
  
Deranged were tearing away the petals of desire  
Learning the mathematics of evil by heart  
We deceive ourselves to start a war  
Within the realm of senses  
And descend to the circle number four  
Where we are nothing  
  
In the nightside of Eden  
Were born again   
Dead  
  
Forever we are  
Forever weve been  
Forever will be crucified to a dream
