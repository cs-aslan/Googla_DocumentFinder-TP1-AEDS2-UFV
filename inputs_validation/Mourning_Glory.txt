These three little these three little fuckers  
These three little pumpkin patch  
These three little pumpkins went into the woods and they said  
  
They said today were gonna find something really good to look at  
And they went into the woods and they looked at all the little trees  
And they said this woods is really continuous little trees  
You know cause nature is just as part of us as we are to the earth

And the pumpkins the pumpkins went further into the woods  
And they came across this little man with a big big head  
And the little man said Whats your fucking idea you fuckers

The two pumpkins looked at the little man and they said  
Why why would he be such a why would he be such a jerk  
And the only thing he does is smoke drugs  
And he doesnt do cocaine  
And he doesnt shoot smack  
And he doesnt even drink beer  
Why would he be such a fucker to me  
Why would he be such fuckers  
All they wanted to do was pumpkins  
All they wanted to laugh at was the pumpkins
