I saw him standin there  
In the parkin lot  
He asked if I  
Came here a lot  
And this is how  
I responded  
  
Chorus  
I forgot my name  
I forgot my telephone number  
If he wanna see me  
He dont even know it  
I forgot my address  
Damsel in distress  
I forgot my boyfriend  
Was the one who had bought me this rock  
  
I get amnesia  
When Im standin next to yououou  
Hes been with me for several years  
I know this much is true  
Didnt know it was over  
Till you came on over  
And told me that you just just cant  
Forget about me  
  
I talk to my girls  
I can talk to my girls like crazy  
To anyone I speak my mind  
I tell them mother dont phase me  
Im not lazy  
But boy lately  
When I see you I stuutter  
Watch you slip away like butterflies  
  
I saw you standin there  
In the VIP on Friday  
We conversate up in my  
Fantasies like every day  
But Im a dud  
Whenever you approach  
Like yesterday when you just  
Came to say hello  
  
Chorus  
  
I get amnesia  
When Im standin next to yououou  
Hes been with me for several years  
I know this much is true  
Didnt know it was over  
Till you came on over  
And told me that you just just cant  
Forget about me  
  
Me  
Me  
This is how I do  
  
I talk to most guys  
I can talk to most guys like crazy  
To anyone Ill speak my mind  
I tell them mother dont phase me  
But you shake me  
Boy you make me  
Stoooop and stutter  
When we touch I melt like butter  
  
I saw you standin there  
In the VIP on Saturday  
Now that I know you got a  
Thing for me I should be straight  
Not the kinda girl wholl just let  
Any guy get close  
I like him so Im gon tell my guy  
He should just effin go  
  
Chorus  
  
I get amnesia  
When Im standin next to yououou  
Hes been with me for several years  
I know this much is true  
Didnt know it was over  
Till you came on over  
And told me that you just just cant  
Forget about me  
  
Me  
Me  
This is how I do
