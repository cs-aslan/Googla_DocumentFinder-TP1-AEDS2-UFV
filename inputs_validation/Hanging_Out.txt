Everytime you go away  
It actually kinda makes my day  
Everytime you leave you slam the door  
You pick your words so carefully  
You hate to think your hurting me  
You leave me laughing on the floor cuz  
  
Chorus  
I dont give it up  
I dont give a damn  
What you say about that  
You know I dont give it up  
I dont give a damn  
What you say about that  
You know Im not gonna cry  
About some stupid guy  
A guy who thinks hes all that  
  
I thought we were just hanging out  
So whyd you kiss me on the mouth  
You thought the way youd taste would get me high  
You went to all your friends to brag  
Guys are always such a drag  
Dont you know the reason that I kissed ya was to say goodbye cause  
  
Chorus  
  
Hanging hanging out I am simply hanging hanging out  
I am simply hanging so whyd you kissed me on the mouth  
Dont you know that I  
  
I dont give a damn about you I wont give it up not for you  
I dont give a damn about you I wont give it up not for you  
Im not gonna cry about some stupid guy a guy who thinks hes all that  
  
chorus slowly fades
