One into one wont go  
Two out of three dont know  
Time and tide in mans affairs  
Trouble always comes in pairs  
Wonder where the picture went  
What we got aint worth a cent  
What we got aint worth a damn  
Someones screwed the master plan  
  
The pursuit of happiness  
Its a common goal  
The pursuit of happiness  
Doing what were told  
The pursuit of happiness  
To the very end  
It goes round and round and round and round again  
  
Bite the bullet in the dust  
Got to take their word on thrust  
No use counting down your prayers  
All Gods children running scared  
No use howling at the moon  
Planet Earth is going soon  
Starving children stand on line  
Living now on borrowed time  
  
The pursuit of happiness  
Its a common goal  
The pursuit of happiness  
Doing what were told  
The pursuit of happiness  
To the very end  
It goes round and round and round and round again
