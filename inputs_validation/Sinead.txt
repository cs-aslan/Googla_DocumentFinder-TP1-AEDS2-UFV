Ive gotta try  
Its not over yet  
No signals of love  
Have you left  
My heart is bleeding just for you  
Bleeds for only you  
  
And it hurts to know the truth  
  
Are you looking for saviours  
Chasing a dream  
Love turned to hate  
  
Now Im crossing the border  
See then I fade  
But Im not afraid  
  
Oh Sinead  
For the first time  
Love is gonna turn around  
Im telling you  
You will like it I know  
  
Oh Sinead  
Its the first time  
Only you can set it free  
Oh Sinead  
Come break away with me  
  
This second chance I know wont last  
But its OK  
Got not regrets  
And I I feel the end here  
Im a fool  
Getting closer  
  
But Im doing what I should  
I been drowning in sorrow  
Chasing tomorrow  
Running away  
  
Now youre crossing the border  
See no tomorrow  
But youre not afraid  
  
Oh Sinead  
For the first time  
Love is gonna turn around  
Im telling you  
You will like it I know  
  
Oh Sinead  
Its the first time  
Only you can set it free  
Oh Sinead  
Come break away with me  
  
But Im doing what I should  
Ive been drowning in sorrow  
Chasing tomorrow  
Running away  
  
Now youre crossing the border  
See no tomorrow  
But youre not afraid  
  
Oh Sinead  
For the first time  
Love is gonna turn around  
Im telling you  
You will like it  
  
Oh Sinead  
For the first time  
Love is gonna turn around  
Im telling you  
You will like it I know  
  
Oh Sinead  
Its the first time  
Only you can set it free  
Oh Sinead  
Come break away with me
