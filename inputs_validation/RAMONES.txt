New York City NYC  
Pretty mean when it wants to be  
Black leather kneehole pants  
Cant play no high school dance  
Fuzz tone hear em go hear em on the radio  
  
Chorus  
Misfits twilight zone  
AreAMONES areAMONES  
RAMONES  
  
Bad boy rock bad boy roll  
Gabba gabba see them go  
C Jay now hit the gas  
Hear Marky kick some ass  
Go Johnny go go go go  
Tommy owayo  
  
Chorus  
  
Bad boys then bad boys now  
Good buddies mau mau mau  
Keep it up rock n roll good music save your soul  
Dee Dee he left home  
Joey call me on the phone  
  
Chorus
