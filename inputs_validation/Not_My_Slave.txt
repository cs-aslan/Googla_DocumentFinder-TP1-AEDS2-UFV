With sadness in my heart and joy in my mind  
I thought about the ghost that we left behind  
With everyone around telling us what to do  
With deafening sound whisper I love you  
The fire in your eyes may it never go out  
The sweetness of your tears make it feel like night  
I see no escape from the roles we always play  
What do we have to prove on this judgement day  
Youre missing the whole point youre not my little pet  
Dont throw away your life The games not over yet  
I do not own your souldont want you in a cage  
I only want your heart to find a special place  
Youre mine now But youre not my sister  
Youre mine now But youre not my slave  
Youre mine But youre not my child  
Youre mine now But youre not my slave  
Youre mine now But youre not my slave  
With sadness in my heart and clounds in my head  
I thought about us both and the lives we led  
The pages on a book and pictures on a screen  
We shape ourselves like clay from someone elses dream  
One second you are cast just like stones at my feet  
But I am not a king please dont worship me  
With everyone around telling us what to do  
With deafening sound whisper I love you  
Youre missing the whole point youre not my little pet  
Dont throw away your life The games not over yet  
I do not own your souldont want you in a cage  
I only want your heart to find a special place  
Youre mine now But youre not my sister  
Youre mine now But youre not my slave  
Youre mine But youre not my child  
Youre mine now But youre not my slave  
Youre mine But youre not my sister  
Youre mine now But youre not my slave  
Youre mine But youre not my child  
Youre mine now But youre not my slave  
Youre mine now But youre not my slave  
Youre mine now But youre not my slave  
Youre mine now But youre not my slave
