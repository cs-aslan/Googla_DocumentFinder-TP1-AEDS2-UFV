I work all day to make a livin  
No one needs  
Your kind of attitude  
Your sharp tongue  
It cuts me like a razor  
Lip service gets you nowhere  
No no no  
Back talk I dont need it  
Be be be back talk I dont need it  
No no no back talk  
Dont want to hear it  
Dont give me no back talk  
Watch that temper  
You watch what youre sayin  
  
Dont talk to me  
With that tone of voice  
Your act is pushin me  
To the limit  
Cant stand it cant stand it  
Cant take it any more  
Dont want back talk  
I dont need it  
Dont give me back talk  
I dont want to hear it  
Dont give me back talk  
Dont need it no  
I believe you enjoy  
This aggravation  
Lately thats all I get from you  
You were born to drive me crazy  
Cant take it cant take it any more from you  
No no more  
Back talk I dont need it  
Back talk I dont need it  
Back talk Dont want to hear it  
Dont give me no back talk  
Sassy back talk  
Dont give me no sassy back talk  
No I dont want to hear it  
No dont really need it  
No dont give me no  
Give me no dont you give me no
