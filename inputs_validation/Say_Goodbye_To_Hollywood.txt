Bobbys driving through the city tonight  
Through the lights  
In a hot new rentacar  
He joins the lovers in his heavy machine  
Its a scene down on Sunset Boulevard  
  
Chorus  
Say goodbye to Hollywood  
Say goodbye my baby  
Say goodbye to Hollywood  
Say goodbye my baby  
  
Johnnys taking care of things for a while  
And his style is so right for troubadours  
They got him sitting with his back to the door  
Now he wont be my fast gun anymore  
  
Chorus  
  
Moving on is a chance that you take every time you try to stay together  
Say a word out of line and you find that the friends you had are gone  
Forever forever  
So many faces in and out of my life  
Some will last some will just be now and then  
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes  
Im afraid its time for goodbye again  
  
Chorus  
  
Moving on is a chance that you take every time you try to stay together  
Say a word out of line and you find that the friends you had are gone  
Forever forever  
So many faces in and out of my life  
Some will last some will just be now and then  
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes  
Im afraid its time for goodbye again
