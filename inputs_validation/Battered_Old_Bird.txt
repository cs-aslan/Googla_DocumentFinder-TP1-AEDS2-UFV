The landladys husband came up to town today  
Since he left them both ten years ago to serve the ministry  
The dark down road of his approach in constant rain was drenched  
The tenants boy said How dya do then swore in French  
Did you teach this little child these curses on my soul  
You should both be shut down in the coalhole  
Thats the way to treat a child who cries out in the night  
And a woman who teaches wrong from right  
  
Chorus  
Hes a Battered Old Bird  
And hes living up there  
Theres a place where time stands still  
If you keep taking those little pink pills  
  
Hush your mouth you hypocrite  
His humour cut her deep  
The tight lipped leer of judgement  
That had seen her love desert her just like sleep  
Filthy words on childrens lips are better my dear spouse  
Then if I were to speak my mind about this house  
  
Chorus  
  
On the first floor there are two old maids  
Each one wishing that the other was afraid  
And next door to them is a man so mild  
Til he chopped off the head of a visitors child  
He danced upon the bonfire  
Swallowed sleeping pills like dreams  
With a bottle of sweet sherry that everything redeems  
  
Chorus  
  
And on the second floor is the Macintosh Man  
Hes in his overcoats more than out of them  
And the typewriters rattling all through the night  
Hes burgundy for breakfast tight  
He says One day Ill throw away all of my cares  
And it is always Christmas in a cupboard at the top of the stairs  
  
Chorus  
  
Well heres a boy if ever there was  
Whos going to do big things  
Thats what they all say and thats how the trouble begins  
Ive seen them rise and fall  
Been through their big deals and smalls  
Hed better have a dream that goes beyond four walls  
You think he should be sent outside playing with the traffic  
When pieces of him are already scattered in the attic
