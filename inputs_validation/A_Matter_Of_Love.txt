All I really had to sing was somebody there for me  
And if we stay right here all night  
  
Dont you know its a matter of love  
Dont you know its a matter of trust  
A connection between you and me  
Cant you see its a matter of trust matter of us matter of love  
  
Weve got magic here its the power of love I know  
Its dancing in the air I can feel the feeling grow

Nothings ever gonna separate us  
You and me its a matter of trust matter of us matter of love  
  
Put your defenses down

And I wont ever let you go  
  
Say everything about you feels so right

All I really had to sing was somebody there for me  
And if we stay right here all night
