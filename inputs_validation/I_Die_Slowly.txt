The tower Ive been  
A brick I am  
A statue so grand  
I feed your sun  
But I never thought  
That I would be burned like this  
  
Your rays of evil licking my skin  
So hear my prayer now  
Teach me to win  
Or Ill be gone  
  
Blinded by false innocence  
Steal my wings  
And I die slowly  
Cracked smile deceivable eyes  
Im burned by the wind  
And I die slowly  
  
These days Im dirt  
Bring the rain  
Because I am the desert  
I feed your sun but I never thought  
Ill be burned like this
