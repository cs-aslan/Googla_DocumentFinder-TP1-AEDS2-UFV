Ill walk across a river without any thought  
So it for you baby  
  
Just as long as you are there my love  
Just a long as you are there  
  
Ill go up to the mountain  
Go into the sea  
Gonna save you baby  
Alright you and me  
Just as long as you are there  
  
Just as long as you are there my love  
Just a long as you are there  
  
Boy you know I wont be far  
And if you call me Ill be there  
And well leave all our troubles behind  
As I walk through life I see that life  
Has taken me through so many changes  
But as long as we can learn to love  
I know everythings gonna be alright  
So take hold of my hand baby  
  
Just as long as you are there my love  
Just a long as you are there  
  
So baby just call me  
And you know that Ill be there  
And you dont have to beg or plead  
Just call my name  
  
Ill walk across the river  
Ill walk across the water
