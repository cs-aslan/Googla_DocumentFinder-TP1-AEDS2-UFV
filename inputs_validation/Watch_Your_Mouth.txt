I get up in the morning and what do I find  
You been talkin all night on a party line  
  
You better watch your mouth watch your mouth  
I said watch your mouth watch your mouth  
Watch your mouth well did you What did you say  
Watch your mouth  
  
Always tellin everybody things I do  
Well now you can tel em that Im through with you  
  
You better hear big mama cause I want it understood  
A looselipwoman just aint no good  
  
Everytime I see you walkin down the street  
Your big mouth is movin just as fast as your feet  
  
Always talkin about me I know  
If you dont shut your mouth go on get out that door
