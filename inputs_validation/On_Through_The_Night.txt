The wait is done the battles won  
So count the cost before you run  
Cause on and on your time was power  
The clock on the wall ticks away the hours  
Come on down youre flyin high  
Youll never win if you never try  
Stop the hate and carry the load  
Come on get this show on the road  
  
On through the night you cant stop me now  
On through the night you wont stop me anyhow  
  
The stakes are high and gettin higher  
Im flat on my face and you call me liar  
Im watching you youre watching me  
Youre watching every move that I can see  
My reputations still at stake  
I play it safe for safetys sake  
Your ego and your promises  
Are gonna fade again and again  
  
On through the night you wont stop me now  
On through the night you wont stop me anyhow  
Not anyhow  
  
All you want to hear is the audience applause  
You cant get on stage for a country clause  
And the road ahead seems a little rough  
If you want to know my feelings Id say thats tough  
And thats tough  
  
Your wheels aint turnin youre out of gas  
You pay by check but they take cash  
Two roads ahead but which to take  
And you cant see its your mistake  
Theyre waitin for you  
Theyre waitin for me  
And what seems like eternity  
Its all tradition itll get you yet  
In rocknroll theres no safety net  
  
On through the night you cant stop me now  
On through the night you cant stop me anyhow  
On through the night goin on and on on and on  
On through the night you cant stop me anyhow  
No no not anyhow
