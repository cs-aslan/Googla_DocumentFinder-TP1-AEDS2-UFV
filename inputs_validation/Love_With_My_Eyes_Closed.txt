I close my eyes  
And now I pray  
That you are out there  
Doing the same  
Long for the touch  
It stands alone  
It needs no vision  
To find its home  
  
Ive seen beauty in the mountains  
Ive seen rivers meet the sea  
Ive seen light above the horizon  
Shining down all over me  
Ive seen beggars turn to rich men  
Seen the birth of my own child  
  
I dont wanna find this feeling  
Just to let it go  
  
Wanna love with my eyes closed  
Wanna feel you inside my soul  
Want your warm body next to me  
So I can feel what my heart knows  
Wanna love with my eyes closed  
  
Deep in my mind  
I touch your skin  
The risk of emotions  
In life so thin  
And will you love me  
When I am old  
When Im no longer  
Strong to hold  
  
Ive seen beauty in the mountains  
Ive seen rivers meet the sea  
Ive seen light above the horizon  
Shining down all over me  
Ive seen beggars turn to rich men  
Seen the birth of my own child  
  
I dont wanna find this feeling  
Just to let it go  
  
Wanna love with my eyes closed  
Wanna feel you inside my soul  
Want your warm body next to me  
So I can feel what my heart knows  
  
Wanna love with my eyes closed  
Wanna live in the afterglow  
Wanna trust then I can believe  
Everything that my heart knows  
Wanna love with my eyes closed yeah  
  
I dont wanna find this feeling  
Just to let it go  
  
I wanna love with my eyes closed yeah  
I want your warm body next to me  
So I can feel what my heart knows  
  
Wanna love with my eyes closed  
Wanna live in the afterglow  
Wanna trust then I can believe  
Everything that my heart knows  
Wanna love with my eyes closed  
  
Ive seen beauty in the mountains  
Ive seen rivers meet the sea  
Ive seen light above the horizon  
Shining down all over me  
Ive seen beggars turn to rich men  
Seen the birth of my own child  
  
I dont wanna find this feeling  
Just to let it go  
  
Wanna love with my eyes closed
