If I make a mark in time I cant say the mark is mine  
Im only the underline of the Word  
Yes Im like him just like you I cant tell you what to do  
Like everybody else Im searching through what Ive heard  
  
Chorus  
Whoa Where do you go  
When you dont want no one to know  
Who told tomorrow Tuesdays dead  
  
Oh preacher wont you paint my dream wont you show me where youve been  
Show me what I havent seen to ease my mind  
Cause I will learn to understand if I have a helping hand  
I wouldnt make another demand all my life  
  
Chorus  
  
Whats my sex whats my name all in all its all the same  
Everybody plays a different game that is all  
Now man may live man may die searching for the question why  
But if he tries to rule the sky he must fall  
  
Chorus  
  
Now every second on the nose the humdrum of the city grows  
reaching out beyond the throes of our time  
We must try to shake it down Do our best to break the ground  
Try to turn the world around one more time  
Yeah we must try to shake it down do our best to break the ground  
Try to turn the world around one more time  
  
Chorus
