I saw you coming  
With that poison in your hand  
Now youre acting kind of funny  
Like you dont seem to understand  
  
Stop complaining  
Youve been caught fair and square  
I saw you coming  
I was guarding you that day  
  
I saw you coming  
Golden rule you disobeyed  
You were too busy showing off  
How you gave yourself away  
  
Stop complaining  
Youve been caught fair and square  
I saw you coming  
I was guarding you that day  
I saw you coming
