Broken down in paradise  
Im heavy like Im hypnotized  
And I am sure  
The sheep are all asleep by now  
Cause I was such a fool for you  
I held my breath till I turned blue  
I loved you so much better  
When you werent around  
  
You know I hate to say goodbye to you  
But but it feels like its the only thing that I can do  
You know I hate to say goodbye to you  
But goodbye to yous the only thing it feels like I can say  
  
Absence makes the heart so fond  
Now youre back Im paralyzed  
Been sleeping with your skeletons inside my bed  
Cause I was such a fool for you  
All those things I said were true  
I just cant seem to get those feelings back again  
  
You know I hate to say goodbye to you  
But but it feels like its the only thing that I can do  
Oh you know I hate to say goodbye to you  
Oh goodbye to yous the only thing it feels like I can say
