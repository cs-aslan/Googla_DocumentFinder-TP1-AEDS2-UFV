Chorus  
Halloween Halloween night  
Halloween Halloween night  
  
Encourage your children to make up their own verses to reflect the costumes
theyll be wearing  
Below are some sample verses for inspiration  
  
Im gonna be a ghost gonna wear a funny sheet  
Gonna scare everybody I meet along the street  
Youll see me at the door with all my spooky friends  
Screaming for candy with wide open hands  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gonna be a fairy princess as pretty as can be  
Dancing from door to door youll really love me  
Im looking for a prince who wont give me a fright  
Well live happily ever after well at least for tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gonna be a cavegirl living years ago  
Playing with the dinosaurs its fun to watch them go  
Youll see me on the street with clothing made of fur  
With all my spooky monster friends who are gonna cause a stir  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gonna be a witch put snakes in my hair  
Everyone will run away but I dont really care  
Ill look really freaky riding on my broom  
My cat will be behind me screeching at the moon  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gonna be a cowboy aridin on the range  
Ill be ridin on my horse and Ill be acting really strange  
I wont be making spooky sounds I wont be saying boo  
But Ill be riding  
  
Rap  
Spooky spooky very spooky  
Dont look at me cause Im too kooky  
Kooky kooky very kooky  
Give me a treat give me a cookie  
Cookie cookie come and lookie  
Look at the way I eat my cookie
