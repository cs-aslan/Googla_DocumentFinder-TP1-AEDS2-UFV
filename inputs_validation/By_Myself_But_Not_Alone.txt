Yes Ill be here where I belong  
And Ill be here where Im strong  
Never to go  
Never to leave you all alone  
  
The love I found I wont let go  
With space and time it will grow  
Searching the heart for treasures  
I know now that I have  
  
Im by myself but not alone  
I have a family and a home  
Im by myself but not alone  
I have my family and a home  
  
The road was long but I was strong  
And through the storms I carried on  
To keep on the dreams that we have had all along  
  
Yes Ill be here where I belong  
And Ill be here where Im strong  
Never to go  
Never to leave you all alone  
  
Im by myself but not alone
