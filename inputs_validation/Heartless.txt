Chorus  
In the night I hear em talk  
The coldest story ever told  
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul to a woman so heartless  
How could you be so heartless  
Oh how could you be so heartless  
  
How could you be so cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo  
Just remember that you talkin to me though  
You know need to watch the way you talkin to me yo  
I mean after all the things that weve been through  
I mean after all the things we got into  
Hey yo I know of some things that you aint told me  
Hey yo I did some things but thats the old me  
And now you wanna get me back and you goin show me  
So you walk around like you dont know me  
You got a new friend well I got homies  
But in the end its still so lonely  
  
Chorus  
  
How could be so Dr Evil you bringin out a side of me that I dont know  
I decided we werent goin speak so  
Why we up three AM on the phone  
Why does she be so mad at me for  
Homie I dont know shes hot and cold  
I wont stop I wont mess my groove up  
Cause I already know how this thing go  
You run and tell your friends that youre leaving me  
They say that they dont see what you see in me  
You wait a couple months then you gon see  
Youll never find nobody better than me  
  
Chorus  
  
Talkin talkin talkin talk  
Baby lets just knock it off  
They dont know what we been through  
They dont know bout me and you  
So I got something new to see  
And you just goin keep hatin me  
And we just goin be enemies  
I know you cant believe  
I could just leave it wrong  
And you cant make it right  
Im goin take off tonight  
Into the night  
  
Chorus
