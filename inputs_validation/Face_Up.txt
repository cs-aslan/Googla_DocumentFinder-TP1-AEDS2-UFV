You turn my head  
I spin my wheels  
Running on empty  
You know how that feels  
  
Im on a roll now  
Or is it a slide  
Cant be too careful  
With that dangerous pride  
If I could only reach that dial inside  
And turn it up  
  
Face up or you can only back down  
Face up hit the target or you better hit the ground  
Face up theres still time to turn the game around  
Face up turn it up or turn that wild card down  
Turn it up  
  
Dont complain  
Dont explain  
I dont think my new resolve  
Can stand the strain  
  
Im in a groove now  
Or is it a rut  
I need some feedback  
But all the lines are cut  
I get so angry but I keep my mouth shut  
And turn it up  
  
You get all squeezed up inside  
Like the days were carved in stone  
You get all wired up inside  
And its bad to be alone  
  
You can go out you can take a ride  
And when you get out on your own  
You get all smoothed out inside  
And its good to be alone  
Turn it up
