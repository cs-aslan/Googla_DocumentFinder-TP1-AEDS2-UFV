Kiss me each morning for a million years  
Hold me each evening by your side  
And tell me youll love me for a million years  
If it dont work out if it dont work out  
Then you can tell me goodbye  
  
Sweeten my coffee with a mornin kiss  
Soften my dreams with a sigh  
After youd loved me for a million years  
If it dont work out if it dont work out  
Then you can tell me goodbye  
  
If you must go no I wont grieve  
If you wait a lifetime before you leave  
  
But if you must go I wont tell you no  
Just so we can say that we tried  
Tell me youll love me for a million years  
If it dont work out if it dont work out  
Then you can tell me goodbye  
  
But if you must go I wont tell you no  
Just so we can say that we tried  
Tell me youll love me for a million years  
Then if it dont work out and if it dont work out  
Then you can tell me goodbye  
Then you can tell me goodbye
