Well what I like to do on formal occasions like this is to take some of the
various types of songs that we all know and presumably love and as it were
to kick them when theyre down I find that if you take the various popular
song forms to their logical extremes you can arrive at almost anything from
the ridiculous to the obscene or  as they say in New York  sophisticated
Id like to illustrate with several hundred examples for you this evening
first of all the southern type song about the wonders of the American south
But its always seemed to me that most of these songs really dont go far
enough The following song on the other hand goes too far Its called I
want to Go Back To Dixie  
  
I want to go back to Dixie  
Take me back to dear ol Dixie  
Thats the only lil ol place for lil ol me  
Old times there are not forgotten  
Whuppin slaves and sellin cotton  
And waitin for the Robert E Lee  
It was never there on time  
  
Ill go back to the Swanee  
Where pellagra makes you scrawny  
And the honeysuckle clutters up the vine1  
I really am afixin  
To go home and start amixin  
Down below that MasonDixon line  
  
Oh poll tax2  
How I love ya how I love ya  
My dear ol poll tax  
  
Wontcha come with me to Alabammy  
Back to the arms of my dear ol Mammy  
Her cookins lousy and her hands are clammy  
But what the hell its home  
  
Yes for paradise the Southland is my nominee  
Jes give me a ham hock and a grit of hominy  
  
I want to go back to Dixie  
I want to be a Dixie pixie  
And eat corn pone3 till its comin outta my ears4  
I want to talk with Southern gentlemen  
And put that white sheet on again5  
I aint seen one good lynchin in years  
  
The land of the boll weevil  
Where the laws are medieval  
Is callin me to come and nevermore roam  
I want to go back to the Southland  
That yall and shetmamouth land  
Be it ever so decadent  
Theres no place like home
