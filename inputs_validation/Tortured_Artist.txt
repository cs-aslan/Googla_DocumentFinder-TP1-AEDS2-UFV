Feelin ticklish just met a new girl  
Shes got a tattoo said she remembers you  
Oh one day waitin out the rain  
  
She embroidered the portrait of a tortured artist on your sleeve  
  
Laugh at your own jokes ooh wouldnt dare laugh at yourself  
What a surprise  
Happy happy birthday to you  
Oh youre mamas little dream come true  
  
She painted the colors of the sunset with her fingers on my teepee  
  
Likes cold cold wine cradled in the evening sky  
Drinks in the deep dark reds of romance and poetry  
Laughs out loud as movie stars shed their tears  
In her sleep she dreams with melancholoy  
  
And I know I know Im just like you  
I was leaving in a way Im already gone  
Still young though oozing to the radio  
Oh like poetry a tired cowboy  
Who just let his horse run free  
  
I know ooh Im just like you  
Not goin anywhere  
Feel near gone  
Theres a van passing fast  
Moving in stereo  
  
Barely see her face  
Or maybe outline  
Im not I can barely see  
  
Even as she sleeps oh she laughs so long  
Laughing loud
