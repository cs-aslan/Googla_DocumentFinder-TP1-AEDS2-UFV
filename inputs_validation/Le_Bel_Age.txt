There comes a time  
When you should see things clear  
Free from my innocence  
There is no circumstance too severe  
Only the need for us for us to believe again  
  
There is a time temptations on the run  
Dreamer youve had your way  
Soldier youve had your day in the sun  
Now its time oh its time for us to begin again  
  
Le bel age  
Only our love will remain  
Le bel age  
Close to the truth once again  
  
There comes a time  
When you must find your way  
Beggar has made his bed  
Wrapped in a silhouette of gold and gray  
Now its time yes its time for us to believe again  
  
Le bel age  
Only our love will remain  
Le bel age  
Close to the truth once again  
  
Le bel age  
Only our love will remain  
Le bel age  
Close to the truth once again  
  
Standing so close to me the possibility  
To change our destiny  
I see it perfectly moving so naturally  
Nothing can stand in our way  
  
Le bel age  
Only our love will remain  
Le bel age  
Close to the truth once again  
  
Le bel age  
Only our love will remain  
Le bel age  
Close to the truth once again  
  
Le bel age  
Only our love will remain  
Le bel age  
Close to the truth once again
