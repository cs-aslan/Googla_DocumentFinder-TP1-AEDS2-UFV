Dont tell me the story of your life  
Ive heard too much already  
You said youve got problems with your wife  
Id say the problems you  
Cause you never grew up  
And youre running away  
But youre gonna get caught some day  
  
Tell me about it  
Oh thats tough  
Tell me about it  
Oh thats tough  
  
So dont tell me the story of your life  
Id rather watch a movie  
Your Hollywood smile is not enough  
Youre giving me the blues  
So when are you going to understand  
Im not the woman to make you a man  
So if youve got a wife you can talk to you might  
Tell me about it  
Oh thats tough  
Tell me about it  
Oh thats tough  
  
I dont want to hear about the time  
You crashed your new Ferrari  
Dont try to impress me with your lies  
Ive no respect for you  
Cause you try to make out  
That youre somebody else  
But youll never escape yourself  
So when are you going to understand  
I dont intend to be part of your plans  
Youve got an obsession youd like to call love  
Tell me about it  
Oh thats tough  
Tell me about it  
Oh thats tough  
  
Dont tell me dont tell me dont tell me  
Thats tough  
I dont wanna hear you tell me  
Thats tough  
Dont tell me dont tell me dont tell me dont tell me  
Thats tough  
So I dont want to hear you tell me thats tough  
Dont tell me dont tell me dont tell me  
Thats tough  
Thats tough  
So I dont want to hear you tell me thats tough  
Dont tell me dont tell me dont tell me  
Thats tough  
Oh thats tough  
  
Tell me about it  
Oh thats tough  
Tell me about it  
Oh thats tough  
So I dont want to hear you tell me thats tough  
Dont tell me dont tell me dont tell me  
Thats tough  
Oh thats tough
