ZRo  
Im sick of being lied to giving it my all you know I tried to  
Maintain in the family is a must I would of died to  
Do anything for my peeps  
But it seems they would rather see me sleep six feet deep  
But when Im on my feet somebody got they hand out though  
Thatll feel me broke the heat be hiding the rain watch me soke  
Thats the millennium love if you can pay your way maybe you can stay  
In the mean time they hate you everyday  
Want to see me and my baby girl break it off  
Hatersll stop they selfdefense friends every ten minutes drop its off  
When threes company and four is a crowd  
And my situation is seven everybody else can move around  
Look at your friends and your friends peeping they burn bridges  
In they household come into your home and try to repeat it  
Got you looking at your people meaning shit  
When its over youre lonely talking about I should of seen that shit  
  
Chorus  2x  
Take a look at my life everybody around here so shife  
No love no sacrifice fellas in the street aint acting right  
  
ZRo  
Watch your enemies dog keep them close like your block  
Most of the ones closest to you cause they want what you got  
Long as you spending money on them and your buying the drugs  
They gone be down like four flats and aint trying to budge  
Say they love you everytime you rolling up the doedoe  
But when your ends dont spend they tend to leave you solo  
I know thats why I love ZRo cause aint nobody else gone love me  
I think of myself whyall dont think of me  
Im all alone but guess what thats alright  
Even though they use me for a punching bag thats alright  
Even if my woman dont want me no more thats alright  
I got Jesus and I can conversate with him all night  
Give me a split thats what Im asking  
Cause I get reary ducking haters as they passing  
I wish I was a sociable person but socializing aint for me  
I want to die by myself in these streets cause thats love  
  
Mr 32  
It aint no love no more everybody about the dollar  
Thats why when I pass by the GOV dont holler  
I pop my collar and dont follow nobody  
Keep god first and dont need no killumanati  
To put it on your mind cause I say on no pages  
Stacking big faces and travel to many places  
Sipping ski tastes straight out the gallon  
Why dont you take a lick and dont swallow   
The games is backstabbing crooked it aint right  
Friends or kin folk it dont matter we can fight  
Its whenever when we were boss want to do  
Cause Ima pull dollar prime till Im dead and Im through  
  
Chorus  2x  
H2O  
A lot of friends turn to foes over money and hoes  
I cant believe my best homie aint my nigga no more  
Remember days of playing hookie in the streets for fun  
Now Im getting dirty looks got me clutching my gun  
On the one Ima shine like the sun my nigga  
If Im so low when Im riding with some thugging niggas  
Family members even say that I aint use to shit  
Cause I stay high all day straight abusing shit  
  
ZRo  
Cause lord knows ZRo aint got no regular living  
Even though Im trying I feel as if Im headed to prison  
Or headed to the grave could it be Im running out of time  
Feeling hopeless I lost my mama then I lost my mind  
Will I heal in time scarred up with bruise and shot  
But see the pain is in my brain hitting like a stash spot  
My life my life full of drama and bullshit  
We burn this out of my foes pull quick where the love at  
  
Chorus  6x
