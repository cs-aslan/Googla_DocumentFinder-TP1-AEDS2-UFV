Slim Jim was a stool pidgeon  
On the payroll of the fbi  
Reverend Fred sold instant religion  
With a license from the man in the sky  
Billy the kid was a gunslinger  
Edgar Wallace was a dead ringer  
Me Im just a rocknroll singer  
  
Keyhole Pete was a keen watcher  
Had a telephoto lens in each eye  
Jack the ripper was a cool stalker  
But his birds no longer fly  
James Joyce was a mudslinger  
Jesus Christ was a forgiver  
Me Im just a rocknroll singer  
  
Im not fakin it  
Foolin myself that Im makin it  
Im not fakin it  
  
Tricky dicky was a fast talker  
But his promises were always a lie  
Nostradamus was a doomwatcher  
Predicted when were gonna die  
Cleopatra was a love giver  
Jesse James was a born killer  
Me Im just a rocknroll singer
