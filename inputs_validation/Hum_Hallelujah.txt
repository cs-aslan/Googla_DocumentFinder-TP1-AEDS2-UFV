Its all a game of this or that  
Now verses then  
Better off against  
Worse for wear  
And youre someone  
Who knows someone who knows someone I once knew  
And I just want to be a part of this  
  
The road outside my house  
Is paved with good intentions  
Hired a construction crew  
Cause its hell on the engine  
And you are the dreamer  
And we are the dream  
I could write it better than you ever felt it  
  
Chorus  
So hum hallelujah  
Just off the key of reason  
I thought I loved you  
But its just how you looked in the light  
A teenage vow in a parking lot  
Till tonight do us part  
I sing the blues and swallow them too  
  
My words are my faith  
To hell with our good name  
A remix up your guts  
Your insides xrayed  
And one day well get nostalgic for disaster  
Were a bull  
Your ears are just a china shop  
  
I love you in the same way  
Theres a chapel in a hospital  
One foot in your bedroom  
And one foot out the door  
Sometimes we take chances  
Sometimes we take pills  
I could write it better than you ever felt it  
  
Chorus  
  
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelu hum hallelujah  
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelu hum hallelujah  
  
A teenage vow in a parking lot  
Till tonight do us part  
I sing the blues  
And swallow them too  
  
So hum hallelujah  
Just off the key of reason  
I thought I loved you  
Its just how you looked in the light  
A teenage vow in a parking lot  
Till tonight do us part  
A teenage love in a parking lot  
Till tonight do us part  
A teenage vow in a parking lot  
Till tonight do us part  
I sing the blues and swallow them too
