Summer time kids in the street  
We were up on the roof laughing at the heat  
That was the last I ever saw of you  
  
Now its December cold and dark  
No more rainbows over Central Park  
In this house no window has a view  
Theres no love here without you  
  
Chorus  
When you gonna come back home  
When you gonna see its been too long  
When you gonna come back home to me  
  
Standin at the door and I turn the key  
Im holding my breath half expecting to see  
You lyin on the bed smilin up at me  
Im goin crazy cause I just dont know  
Which way your hearts gonna go  
I only pray it leads you back to me  
Darlin let your heart  
Lead you back to me
