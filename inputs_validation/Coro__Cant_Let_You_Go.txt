I should have known youd be this way  
Serves me right to fall in love  
  
You brought me love then you took it back  
We had it all and thats a fact  
Love is a game that we all play  
Theres one thing Ive got to say  
I gave you my heart and I gave you my world  
I spent those lonley nights right here in the cold  
Everytime you touch me my body starts to quiver  
All I want to do is love you all night long  
  
Chorus  
Cant let you go my love  
Its you that I need  
You keep me wanting you  
You push my love aside  
Repeat 1x  
  
I cant help but think of how you made me feel  
Everytime I think of the two of us  
Cant realize  
Cant realize  
Cant seem to buy it  
Now that youre gone  
Now that youre gone  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
Cant let you go my love  
You fit me like a glove  
Cause when you hold me tight  
The feelings oh so right  
Just cant foget those times  
When you were mine all mine  
This love I have for you is true  
So come back to the one who loves you  
  
Cant let you go  
Cant let you go  
  
Everytime you touch me my body starts to quiver  
All I want to do is love you all night long  
  
I should have known that youd be this way  
Serves me right to fall in love  
I cant help but think how you left me feeling  
Everytime I think about the two of us  
Cant realize  
Cant seem to buy it  
Now that youre gone  
Now that youre gone  
  
Chorus 3x  
  
I cant let you go
