Well I know that youre tired of living this way  
Weve been trying to get high without having to pay  
  
The walls are all empty its not a permanent state  
Just let me tell you that its not too late  
  
Chorus  
Youre a brain drain you go on and on like a blood stain  
Youre a drain brain you go on and on like a blood stain  
  
Well you know I aint selfish theres always a way  
If a thing aint worth having youre having to pay  
  
Chorus  
  
Got so much to offer but I cant pay the rent  
I cant buy you roses cause the moneys all spent  
  
Well you sat in my car you drank my champagne  
You stole all my silk but you gave me no change  
  
Chorus  
  
Got so much to offer but I cant pay the rent  
I cant buy you roses cause the moneys all spent  
  
Well you sat in my car you drank my champagne  
You stole all my silk you left me no change  
  
Chorus x2
