Here I sit and watch the crowds go by  
Papa da papa papa yeah  
But theres only one face I can see  
If only they would understand  
Papa da papa papa yeah  
Id open the door and let him in  
  
Chorus  
How long can I hide what Im feeling inside  
My love is a river thats got to make its way into sea  
This feeling cant hide Lord knows Ive tried  
Beneath the surface  
Beneath the surface  
  
I try though I know Im hanging on a string  
Papa da papa papa yeah  
Youre the only one thing on my mind  
Keeps floating to a distant shore  
Papa da papa papa yeah  
As I go on denying myself  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh keeps turning round in my mind  
Oh round and round in my mind  
  
Here I sit and watch the crowds go by  
Papa da papa papa yeah  
But theres only one face I can see  
  
Chorus x 2
