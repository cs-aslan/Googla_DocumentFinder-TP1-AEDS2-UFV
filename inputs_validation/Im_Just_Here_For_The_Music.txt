Spinnin to the sound  
Like a record going round  
Lets hear the music  
We could be making out  
But all I really want right now  
Is just the music  
Im only here to dance  
Im not looking for romance  
So watch me work it  
I gotta get a fix  
Of my daily megamix  
So keep it groovin  
  
Im just here for the music  
I really didnt mean to turn you on on  
Boy you know I like the way you move it  
So if you wanna wait for me  
Im gonna need someone to take me home  
  
Im diggin on your scene  
But music gets the best of me  
Im so addictive  
No need to save my seat  
Cause Im not gonna miss a beat  
I wanna freak it  
Your conversations fine  
But save it for some other time  
Right now Im dancing like a dancin machine  
Get with my bangin beat  
If you know what I mean  
I wanna do it  
  
Im just here for the music  
I really didnt mean to turn you on on  
Boy you know I like the way you move it  
So if you wanna wait for me  
Im gonna need someone to take me home  
  
Im just here for the music  
I really didnt mean to turn you on on  
Boy you know I like the way you move it  
So if you wanna wait for me  
Im gonna need someone to take me home  
  
I really didnt mean to turn you on  
  
Im just here for the music  
Music  
Music  
I really didnt mean to turn you on  
Music music  
Music  
So if you wanna wait for me  
Im gonna need someone to take me home  
  
Im just here for the music  
I really didnt mean to turn you on on  
Boy you know I like the way you move it  
So if you wanna wait for me  
Im gonna need someone to take me home
