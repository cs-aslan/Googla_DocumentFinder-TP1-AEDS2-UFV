Ya he icky thump  
Whod a thunk  
Sittin drunk  
On a wagon to Mexico  
  
Her hair  
What a chump  
And my head  
Got a bump  
When I hit it on the radio  
  
Redhead senorita  
Lookin dead  
Came to said  
I need a bed in Espanol  
  
So I gave a drink of water  
Im gonna sing around the collar  
Well I dont need a microphone  
  
Yeah  
Icky thump  
With the lump  
In my throat  
Grab my coat  
And now its reckoned  
I was ready to go  
  
Yeah I swam beside the hair  
She had one white eye  
One blank stare  
Lookin up lyin there  
  
On a stand in her hair  
Was a candy cane  
Black rum sugar cane  
Dry eye  
Somethin strange  
  
La la  
La la la la la la la la la la la la  
  
Well Americans  
What nothin better to do  
Why dont you kick yourself out  
Youre an immigrant too  
  
Whos usin who  
What should we do  
Well you cant be a pimp  
And a prostitute too  
  
Icky thump  
Handcuffed to a bunk  
Robbed blind  
Looked around  
And there was nobody else  
  
Left alone  
I hit myself with a stone  
Went home  
And learned how to clean up after myself
