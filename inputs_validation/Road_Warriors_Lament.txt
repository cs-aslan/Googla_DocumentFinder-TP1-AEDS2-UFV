Theres a silence full of stars for as far as I can see  
In the silence where you are do you ever dream of me  
The moon is dark the night is silver wild perfume is on the breeze  
I feel the stars cold as forever half as true as you and me  
And Ill be your friend Ill be your lover Ill be whatever you ever need  
Right to the end until its over I swear to you you can count on me  
But my heart is breaking here tonight my soul is weary from the fight  
My God Ive tried and Ive been true my love Im coming home to you  
 harmonica   
Ill be your friend
