Jimmy Buffett  
What could I do  
Thats never been done before  
What can I say  
That hasnt been said by scores  
  
If I was a designer I could do nothing finer  
Than dress you in style  
But Im a hopeless romantic still  
Behind all these antics  
Is a heart full of smiles  
  
So Ill just keep on dreamin  
The thoughts that are in my brain  
You just keep on being  
The lady I cant explain  
  
I know that Ive  
The imagination of a child  
And there are times  
When I let it all run wild  
  
But if I hurt you forgive  
Still you wont let me live  
Some of those episodes down  
  
Thats why I love you  
And put no one above you  
Love your sights and your sounds  
  
So Ill just keep on movin  
When the forecast calls for rain  
You just keep on being  
The lady I cant explain  
  
So Ill just keep on movin  
When the forecast calls for rain  
You just keep on being  
The lady I cant explain  
Yes I love you  
Put no one above you  
Youre the lady I cant explain
