Youve got no reason  
To say youre all alone  
There will be a change of season  
Thatll win a heart of stone  
  
Chorus  
Love is just around the corner  
And standing out of view  
Love is just around the corner  
For you  
  
I can see a smile tomorrow  
A reason to go on  
Cause the sky is always darkest  
Before the new day dawns  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont ever stop believing  
The sun is going to shine  
Cause its worth giving and receiving  
If you only give it time  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont think youve found salvation  
Or that the day is won  
When you reach your destination  
The journeys just begun  
  
Chorus  
  
Love is just around the corner  
For you  
For you
