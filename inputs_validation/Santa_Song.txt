So many presents  
So little time  
Santa wont be coming around my house this year  
Cause I tried to drown my sister and I pierced my ear  
Oh mama made it perfectly clear  
Santa dont like bad boys Especially jewish ones  
  
Gnipgnop and lego blocks are all that I desire  
So why did I have to set the pizza guys hair on fire  
I told him I was sorry  
Im a liar  
So no toys for me I dont deserve them  
  
I couldnt wait for a big wheel as the holiday neared  
But then I told my grandma that she had a beard  
  
Dear santa  
  
I know what my problem is why I cant be good its a fear of intimacy  
You see my whole life whenever Ive met someone really great like you and  
I keep feeling like Im getting close to them something inside me makes  
Me want to screw it up So in a weird way the reason Im so bad is because  
I love you santa  
  
Rockem sockem robots is what I was hoping for  
But then I made a death threat to vice president gore  
Oh santa wont be knocking on my door  
Cause hes a big fat whore What made me say that  
  
Chutes and ladders would be so good indeed  
So whyd I have to sell that cop a bag of weed  
So santa please give me that easy bake oven  
I swear I thought billy goats were made for lovin  
  
So santa wont you accept my apologies  
Santa cant you see Im begging you please  
Oh santa next year Ill do you right  
Live from new york its saturday night
