Hard bodies soft emotions  
So fast so smart  
The worlds at your feet  
But what about your heart  
Fame and power cant hold you tight  
In the late hours of the night  
  
How do you stop How do you stop  
Before its too late  
You choose and you lose if you hesitate  
How do you stop How do you stop  
Before its too late  
You think love will wait  
So you dont hold on and then its gone  
Then its gone  
  
Youve had some success  
A new group of friends  
You called it the good life  
Thought it would never never end  
One minute youre too young  
Then youre in your prime  
Then youre lookin back  
Through the hands of time  
  
How do you How do you stop  
Before its too late  
You choose and you lose if you hesitate  
How do you stop How do you stop  
Before its too late  
You think love will wait  
You dont hold on and then its gone  
  
How do you stop a runaway train  
How do you stop the pouring pouring of rain  
How do you stop the night turning to day  
How do you stop love from slipping away  
How do you stop from believing  
How do you stop lovers from deceiving  
How do you stop the tide from coming in  
How do you stop the cold cold wind  
  
How do you stop  
Before its too late  
You choose and you lose if you hesitate  
How do you stop How do you stop  
Before its too late  
You think love will wait  
So you dont hold on and then its gone  
Then its gone  
  
How do you stop  
A runaway train  
How do you stop pouring pouring rain  
How do you stop a heart with wings  
How do you stop everything  
How do you stop before its to late  
Choose and you lose if you hesitate  
How do you stop before its to late  
Its your life
