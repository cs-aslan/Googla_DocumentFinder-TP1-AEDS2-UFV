I dont know nothing and I dont know a thing  
But if we just keep on listening together well sing  
  
Ive been walking for about a thousand years  
My feet are tired of crying all the painful tears  
And my sight is going blind my soul is way down low  
And I havent heard a thing so thats all that I can know  
  
Cause I dont know nothing and I dont know a thing  
But if we just keep on listening together well sing well  
  
But Ive been thinking and losing lots of sleep  
My life is getting longer Winter snows come kind of deep  
But I keep my feet on strong Im moving right along  
But I havent seen a thing so thats all that I can know  
  
Cause I dont know nothing and yall dont know a thing  
But if we just keep on listening together well sing well  
  
Well I dont think that its going that good today  
I cant take my eyes off of the rain and everybodys going insane  
And I dont think that its going that good today  
I cant take my eyes off of the rain and everybodys running away  
I ran away to the top of the world today  
  
Ive been drinking to drown away my fear  
The days are getting shorter theyre getting short  
But I still move along and I still dont sing my song  
But I havent heard a thing so I play until I rhyme  
  
Cause I dont know nothing yall dont know a thing  
But if we just keep on listening together well sing well  
  
Well I dont think that its going that good today  
I cant take my eyes off of the rain and everybodys going insane  
And I dont think that its going that good today  
I cant take my eyes off of the rain and everybodys running away  
I ran away to the top of the world today  
  
Run away from run away from run away from you  
Run away from run away from run away from you  
Run away from run away from run away from you
