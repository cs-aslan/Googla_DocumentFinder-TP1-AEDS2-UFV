I gotta find out whats in my mind  
Im a little mixed up but it feels so fine  
Why does love have to come and go  
If its got to leave why does it go so slow  
  
Just tell it  
Tell it like it is  
Tell it  
Tell it like it feels  
Tell it to my baby  
  
I have a feelin that Im goin insane  
Ive fallen in love but cant remember her name  
She probably stepped out and shes coming back again  
but if I dont know her how can I let her in  
  
Just tell it  
Tell it like it is  
Tell it  
Tell it like it feels  
Tell it to my baby  
  
Fine  
So fine  
  
How could this ever have happened this way  
Well sometimes love turns out that way  
Sometimes its cold and sometimes its hot  
But its better to have it than to need it and not
