Though youve played at love and lost  
And sorrows turned your heart to frost  
I will melt your heart again  
Remember the feeling as a child  
When you woke up and morning smiled  
Its time you felt like you did then  
Theres just no percentage in remembering the past  
Its time you learned to live again at last  
  
Come with me leave yesterday behind  
And take a giant step outside your mind  
  
You stare at me in disbelief  
You say for you theres no relieve  
But I swear Ill prove you wrong  
Dont stay in your lonely room  
Just staring back in silent gloom  
Thats not where you belong  
Come with me Ill take you where the taste of life is green  
And everyday holds wonders to be seen  
  
Come with me leave yesterday behind  
And take a giant step outside your mind
