Druscilla Penny what a name  
Are you sure you didnt make it up yourself  
Youre very pretty yes you are but with all the junk you wear its hard to
tell  
  
Man you must work hard to get your hair to look like that  
I dont need a horoscope to tell me where youre at  
Your familys probably given up on you  
Since you began to follow groups of long  haired rock and rollers  
I can hear your mother crying for her daughter  
Ah Ah Ah Ah  
  
Druscilla Penny what a girl  
Wheres the purpose to the crazy life you lead  
It doesnt matter after all youre so sure that instant love is all you tell  
  
Ive seen your face at least a thousand times  
Youre always standing there behind the stages at the concerts  
Waiting for an offer to be with someone after  
Ah Ah Ah Ah  
  
Druscilla Penny hows your head  
Do you ever wake up lonely in the night  
It isnt easy for a girl when she cant decide if love is wrong or right  
I hope I live to see a change  
Could you ever really love ever really care  
Ever really get it together  
No
