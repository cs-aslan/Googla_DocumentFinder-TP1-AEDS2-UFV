Hello again its you and me  
Kinda always like it used to be  
Sippin wine killin time  
Tryin to solve lifes mysteries  
  
Hows your life Its been a while  
God its good to see you smile  
I see you reaching for your keys  
Looking for a reason not to leave  
  
If you dont know if you should stay  
If you dont say whats on your mind  
Baby just breathe  
Theres nowhere else tonight we should be  
You wanna make a memory  
  
I dug up this old photograph  
Look at all that hair we had  
Its bittersweet to hear you laugh  
Your phone is ringing I dont wanna ask  
  
If you go now Ill understand  
If you stay hey Ive got a plan  
Were gonna make a memory  
You wanna steal a piece of time  
You can sing the melody to me  
And I could write a couple of lines  
  
You wanna make a memory  
If you dont know if you should stay  
And you dont say whats on your mind  
Baby just breathe  
Theres nowhere else tonight we should be we should be  
You wanna make a memory  
  
You wanna steal a piece of time  
You can sing the melody to me  
And I could write a couple of lines  
  
You wanna make a memory  
You wanna make a memory
