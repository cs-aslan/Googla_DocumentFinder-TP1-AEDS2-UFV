Dreaming nothing to do  
Dreaming nothing to say  
Can I say theres nothing to dream about  
But something keep us moving away  
  
I said Land ho will I be sailing forever  
Oh oh I need some wind to take me to my goal  
Land ho will I be giving forever  
Oh oh I gotta find an anchor for my soul  
  
Wind is all far I can see  
When Im feeling to strife  
For theres something thats calling me  
Oh something thats so hard to find  
  
I said Land ho will I be sailing forever  
Oh oh I guess Ill feel my ship is getting old  
Land ho will I be dreaming forever  
Oh oh I gotta find an anchor for my soul  
  
I said When youre alone theres not a sail in sight  
Theres a great sky and you may just try to take a life  
Oh well there once was a lady made me feel alright  
But she couldnt stay she just sailed away  
Now this only waves to see me through the night  
  
Maybe Ill always be sad  
And maybe therell always be strife  
Drifting alone with a saddened tone  
Afloat in the ocean of life  
  
I said Land ho youre sailing ship on forever  
Oh oh I need some wind to take me to my goal  
Land ho will I be searching forever  
Oh oh I gotta find an anchor for my soul  
  
Will I be sailing forever  
Will I be dreaming forever  
Will I be searching forever  
Forever forever forever  
Forever forever forever
