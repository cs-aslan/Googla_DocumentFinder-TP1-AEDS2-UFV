Another sad day another lonely day  
For all we know some people only cry  
They have no good times no poetry rhymes  
They dont know how or when or if or why  
Why the goodness never stays  
Or why love didnt come again today  
  
Isnt there someone who knows theyre in trouble  
Isnt there someone who sees  
Ill be the someone who cares that youre dying for love  
I can be the someone that you need  
  
I know you dream at night and lay your feelings down  
And you wish your life could be more like your dreams  
What a moonlit sound your voice is not too loud  
But somehow I hear it coming through to me  
I pray you hang on to your dream  
And I hope it gives you all the love you need  
You need  
  
Isnt there someone who knows that youre hurting  
Is there someone to believe  
Well Ill be the someone who cares that youre dying for love  
I can be the someone that you need  
  
Dont you miss love I know I often do  
Thats why Im pulling you closer to me  
But like anything you cant see  
Its just a little harder to believe  
  
Isnt there someone who loves you completely  
Isnt there someone like me  
Well Ill be the someone who cares that youre dying for love  
I can be the someone that you need  
I can be the someone that you need
