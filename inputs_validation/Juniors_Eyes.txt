Juniors eyes looked up to the skies in tears  
He prayed that his maker the giver and taker would pear  
Junior sighed as his hands reached out to the sky  
Junior cried the day that his best friend died  
Yeah  
  
Theyre coming home again tomorrow  
Im sorry it wont be for long  
With all the pain Ive watched you live within  
Ill try my hardest not to cry  
When it is time to say goodbye  
  
Juniors eyes they couldnt disguise the pain  
His father was leaving and Juniors grieving again  
Innocent eyes watched the man who had gave everything  
Juniors sorrow who knew what tomorrow would bring  
Yeah  
  
Theyre coming home again tomorrow  
Im sorry it wont be for long  
With all the pain Ive watched you live within  
Ill try my hardest not to cry  
When it is time to say goodbye  
  
Juniors eyes looked into the skies once more  
Now he knew well this life was hell for sure  
He desperately tried his fingertips stretched to the stars yeah  
Reaching for reason along with the time and the stars  
Yeah  
  
Theyre coming home again tomorrow  
Im sorry it wont be for long  
With all the pain Ive watched you live within  
Ill try my hardest not to cry  
When it is time to say goodbye
