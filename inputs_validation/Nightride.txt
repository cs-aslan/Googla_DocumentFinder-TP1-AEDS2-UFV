Dreamin goin on a night ride hopin its gonna be the right ride  
Feelin so well Im in tune cant you tell that Im groovin  
Cant you tell Im in tune and Im movin so much closer to you  
Leanin hopin for a straight line meanin hopin for the right rhyme  
Im in tune to the room cos my head just went boom and Im movin  
Cant you tell Im in tune and Im movin so much closer to you  
Cant you tell Im in tune and Im movin so much closer to you  
You you you you you move me  
You you you you you move me  
You you you you you move me  
You you you you you move me  
Scheming thinking of the right place beamin laughin at my own face  
Weve got a long way to go cos you make like youre so disapproving  
But cant you tell Im in tune and Im movin so much closer to you  
Cant you tell Im in tune and Im movin so much closer to you  
You you you you you move me  
You you you you you move me  
You you you you you move me
