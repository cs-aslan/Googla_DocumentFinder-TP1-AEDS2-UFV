Verse 1 Fabolous  
It wont stop till these young cowards bleed  
So if you see the kid spittin shells it aint gon be sunflower seeds  
Ya rims are too small rocks are too little  
When ya talk to birds and rats like Dr Dolittle  
I barely reloads  
I got those  
Slugs thatll hit you in different area codes  
Keepin mine homie  
I aint Scarface Im the quiet dude that creep behind Tony  
I do it for fifty thousand  
Im the kid involved with more projects than New York City Housing  
I get in ya girlys hiney  
Cause they aint seen the Jordans on my feet since the early ninetys  
Since Box Beamers  
I been bustin on chicks faces till they look like they covered in Noxzema  
Im still be stashin the sket  
Even after my soundscan numbers look like the national debt holla
