Like a flower waiting to bloom  
Like a lightbulb in a dark room  
Im just sittin here waiting for you  
To come on home and turn me on  
  
Like the desert waiting for the rain  
Like a school kid waiting for the spring  
Im just sitting here waiting for you  
To come on home and turn me on  
  
My poor heart its been so dark  
Since youve been gone  
After all youre the one who turns me off  
But youre the only one who can turn me back on  
  
My Hifi is waiting for a new tune  
My glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes  
Im just sitting here waiting for you  
To come on home and turn me on turn me on
