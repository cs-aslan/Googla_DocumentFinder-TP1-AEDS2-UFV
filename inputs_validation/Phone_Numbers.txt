Fabolous  Intro  
Yall niggas better stop playin with me  
Yall know ya aint bout that life  
SOUL tape  
Niiiccee  
  
Chorus  
Im callin them out  
I got they phone numbers x2  
When that money callin everything gon on hold x2  
  
Fabolous  Verse 1  
Im having doubts what they really believe  
Starting with these Stefan Urquelle who really be Steve  
Photoshop dont make it better it really deceive  
Long hair dont care but it really be weave  
Lets get back to this real shit  
That life Im bout  
Anytime that Im out I keep ballin like theres no time out  
On the kush Im stoned out  
  
On you haters I zone out  
Yall opinions dont make me money  
So what yall thinkin dont count  
I mean the nerve of these niggas giving me attitude  
When I be serving these niggas  
You rappers platter food  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Verse 2  
Saying they overrated is a understatement  
Them niggas is broke look like they under maintanence  
They rapping bout mansions but from they mommas basement  
Swear they in phantoms but drive a honda station  
Lets get back to this real shit  
Stay away from that counterfeit  
That fakeit till you makeit life really dont amount to shit  
Talkin never bothers us sometimes it do bore me  
So if ya makin movies hope it based on a true story  
Freck said nothings worse than a rich hater  
When money call pick it up n call that bitch later  
  
Chorus x2
