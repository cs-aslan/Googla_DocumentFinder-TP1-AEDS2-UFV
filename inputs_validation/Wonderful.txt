I close my eyes when I get too sad  
I think thoughts that I know are bad  
Close my eyes and I count to ten  
Hope its over when I open them  
  
I want the things that I had before  
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door  
I wish I could count to ten  
Make everything be wonderful again  
  
Hope my mom and I hope my dad  
Will figure out why they get so mad  
Hear them scream I hear them fight  
Say bad words that make me want to cry  
  
Close my eyes when I go to bed  
And I dream of angels that make me smile  
I feel better when I hear them say  
Everything will be wonderful someday  
  
Promises mean everything when youre little  
And the worlds so big  
I just dont understand how  
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes  
Tell me everything is wonderful now  
  
Na na na na na na na  
  
Please dont tell me everything is wonderful now  
  
I go to school and I run and play  
I tell the kids that its all okay  
I like to laugh so my friends wont know  
When the bell rings I just dont want to go home  
  
Go to my room and I close my eyes  
I make believe that I have a new life  
I dont believe you when you say  
Everything will be wonderful someday  
  
Promises mean everything when youre little  
And the world is so big  
I just dont understand how  
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes  
When you tell me everything is wonderful now  
  
I dont want to hear you tell me everything is wonderful now  
  
I dont want to hear you say  
That I will understand someday  
No no no no  
I dont want to hear you say  
We both have grown in a different way  
No no no no  
I dont want to meet your friends  
And I dont want to start over again  
I just want to my life to be the same  
Just like it used to be  
Some days I hate everything  
I hate everything  
Everyone and everything  
Please dont tell me everything is wonderful now  
  
I dont want to hear you tell me everything is wonderful now
