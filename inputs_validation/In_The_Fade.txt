Cracks in the ceiling crooked pictures in the heart  
Countin and breathin Im leaving here tomorrow  
Way down low I never do you any good  
Laughin is easy I would if I could  
  
Aint gonna run  
Just live till you die want to drown  
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone  
Theres nothing to save I know  
You live till you die  
  
Live till you die I know  
  
Loosing feelin but I couldnt get the way   
Countin and breathin disappearin in the fade  
Lay down low I never do you any good  
Stoppin and stayin I would if I could  
  
Aint gonna run  
Just live till you die want to drown  
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone  
Theres nothing to save I know  
You live till you die
