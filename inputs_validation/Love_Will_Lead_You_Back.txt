Saying goodbye is never an easy thing  
But you never said you stay forever  
So if you must go darling Ill set you free  
But I know in time well be together  
I wont try to stop you now from leaving  
Cause in my heart I know  
Love will lead you back someday I just know that  
Love will lead you back to my arms where you belong  
Im sure sure as stars are shining  
One day you will find me again it wont be long  
One of these days our love will lead you back  
One of these nights Ill hear your voice again  
Youre gonna say how much you miss me  
You walked out this door but someday youll walk back in  
Darling I know I know this will be  
Sometimes it takes sometime out on your own now  
To find your way back home  
Love will lead you back someday I just know that  
Love will lead you back to my arms where you belong  
Im sure sure as stars are shining  
One day you will find me again it wont be long  
One of these days our love will lead you back  
I wont try to stop you now from leaving  
Cause in my heart I know  
Love will lead you back I just know that  
Love will lead you back to my arms where you belong  
Im sure sure as stars are shining  
One day you will find me again it wont be long  
One of these days our love will lead you back  
Love will lead you back someday I just know that  
Love will lead you back to my arms it wont be long  
One of these days my love will lead you back
