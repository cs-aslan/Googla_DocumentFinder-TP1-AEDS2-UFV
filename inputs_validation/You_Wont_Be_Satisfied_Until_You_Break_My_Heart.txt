Oh you wont be satisfied until you break my heart  
Youre never satisfied until the teardrops start  
I tried to shower you with love and kisses  
But all I ever get from you is naggin and braggin  
My poor heart is saggin  
  
The way you toss my heart arounds a cryin shame  
Ill bet you wouldnt like it if I did the same  
Youre only happy tearin all my dreams apart  
Oh you wont be satisfied until you break my heart  
  
No you wont be satisfied until you break my heart  
Youre never satisfied until the teardrops start  
I tried to shower you with love and kisses baby  
All I ever get from you is naggin and braggin  
My poor heart is saggin  
  
The way you toss my heart arounds is a cryin shame  
Ill bet you wouldnt like it if I did the same  
Youre only happy tearin all my dreams apart  
Babe you wont be satisfied until you break my heart  
  
The way you toss my heart arounds a cryin shame  
Oh yes  
Ill bet you wouldnt like it if I did the same  
You only tearing all my little dreams apart  
Oh you wont be satisfied until you break my heart
