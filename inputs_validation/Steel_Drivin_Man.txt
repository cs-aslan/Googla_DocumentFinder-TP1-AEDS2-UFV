There once was a time when the country was wide A time before cars and planes
and minivans So to move things from one place to the other the railroad was
built But it just didnt up and build itself Nope it was built by the
railroad men And among these men was a man among men among men among men
among men among men a man as tall as the sky and as wide as the land A man
who could lay track faster than anyone else could run A man with the strength
of ten men His name was John Henry and Im not gonna sing about him No Im
gonna sing about a lesser know figure one who doesnt deserve a song A man
as lazy as a thousand men A man who could barely raise his own body off the
ground A man who was barely a man at all His name was Mike McCormick  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin man  
Who never really gave a damn  
Only thing he worked on was his tan

Hed get up in the morning to hammer in them spikes  
Unless hed been up drinking the previous night  
Or if his bones werent feeling right  
Or if it looked like it was going to rain  
He had a tendency of being late for work  
And everyone around thought he was a jerk  
Hed take long breaks and say his back was hurt  
Then hed have a drink to ease the pain

Only thing he worked on was his tan  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin man

His arms were like twigs and his legs were like straws  
His hands were like a babys bum they were so soft  
Hed wheeze and moan and whine and cough  
Then go home and take a little nap  
He never got fired cause he was the boss son  
He just hung around and bothered everyone  
Never drove a spike not a single one
