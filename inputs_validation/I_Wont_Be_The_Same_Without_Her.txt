Life is hard for me to touch now  
I just dont enjoy it as much now  
When she left something inside of me died  
And I wont be the same without her  
No I wont be the same without her  
By my side  
  
Theres no end end to my sorrow  
Im afraid to face tomorrow  
When she left she took much more than my pride  
And I wont be the same without her  
No I wont be the same without her  
By my side  
  
It isnt easy to forget her  
And the way it used to be  
She changed my life the day I met her  
And I wont be the same without her  
No I wont be the same without her  
Close to me  
  
Life is hard for me to touch now  
I just dont enjoy it as much now  
When she left something inside of me died  
And I wont be the same without her  
No I wont be the same without her  
By my side
