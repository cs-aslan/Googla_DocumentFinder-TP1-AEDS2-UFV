Ive looked under chairs  
Ive looked under tables  
Ive tried to find the key  
To fifty million fables  
  
Chorus  
They call me The Seeker  
Ive been searching low and high  
I wont get to get what Im after  
Till the day I die  
  
I asked Bobby Dylan  
I asked The Beatles  
I asked Timothy Leary  
But he couldnt help me either  
  
Chorus  
  
People tend to hate me  
Cause I never smile  
As I ransack their homes  
They want to shake my hand  
  
Focusing on nowhere  
Investigating miles  
Im a seeker  
Im a really desperate man  
  
I wont get to get what Im after  
Till the day I die  
  
I learned how to raise my voice in anger  
Yeah but look at my face aint this a smile  
Im happy when lifes good  
And when its bad I cry  
Ive got values but I dont know how or why  
  
Im looking for me  
Youre looking for you  
Were looking in at other  
And we dont know what to do  
  
Chorus
