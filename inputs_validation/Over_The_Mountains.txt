Ive made up my mind Ive packed my bags  
Im not returning home until someone will give me reason to  
I lock the door and take a breath  
Im ready to let go I know youre somewhere out there too  
Theres only one thing for me to do and I go  
  
Chorus  
Over the mountains and over the sea  
To find a heart that belongs to me  
Anywhere in the world I go  
Anywhere til I find you  
I run through the valleys  
I run through the fields  
Id do anything I am hard to please  
And anywhere in the world I go  
Anywhere til I find you  
  
I fly like the wind I dont know where my heart will lead the way  
I need someone to love and hold on to  
But the road is long Ive had my doubts  
But nothing lets me down cause  
I know youre somewhere out there too waiting for me to get to you and I go  
  
Chorus  
  
It doesnt matter what  
The time will tell  
Cause I will be here waiting  
For you for you and me  
It doesnt matter what the others say  
Cause I will keep on searching  
And I go and I go and I go and I go  
  
Chorus x2
