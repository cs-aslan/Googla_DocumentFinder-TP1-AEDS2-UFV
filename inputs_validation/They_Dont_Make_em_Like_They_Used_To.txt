Its every young boys fancy  
Its there hidden deep in the heart of a man  
Its just a feeling  
They wont ever understand  
  
They know they gotta have one  
A brand new model and its here today  
And dont you know that shes made right here in the USA  
  
Chorus  
Dont ever stop trying  
Dont let her get away  
They dont make em like they used to  
I think theyre better than before  
Its more than physical attraction  
Keeps you coming back for more  
  
Shes a home grown beauty  
Shes born and raised with a mind of her own  
And once you find her  
Youll never want to leave her alone  
  
Shes making you crazy  
You cant live without her shes here to stay  
Dont you know that she lives right here in the USA  
  
Chorus  
  
They dont make em like they used to  
Theyre so much better than before  
  
Im so tired of hearingIm so tired  
Some people saywhat people say  
Everything is moving much too fast  
Things were better in the good old days  
  
Let them have their opinionslet them have  
Never gonna change their mindtheyll never change  
They lived a long time ago  
When times were tough  
And a real good woman was hard to find  
  
They dont make em like they used to  
I think theyre better than before  
Its more than physical attraction  
That keeps you coming back for more  
  
Chorus  
  
They dont make em like they used to  
Theyre so much better than before
