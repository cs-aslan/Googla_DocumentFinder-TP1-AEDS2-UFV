When I feel the worlds against me  
Left me in the cold  
Thinking Ive been forgotten  
Out there on my own  
I close my eyes and in the silence  
Hear a voice so clear  
Reminding me your love  
Is always right here  
Within methen all of my doubts disappear  
And theres nothing to fear your loves  
Within me  
You gave me strength to believe  
That all that I am and all that Ill ever need is  
Within me  
When my spirits all but broken  
Im humbled to the bone  
Searching for the grace  
To find my way home  
I take a breath a slow deep breath  
And feel a sense of calm  
Then the hurt in my heart is suddenly gone  
Within me you wiped away all my tears  
Theres nothing to fear your loves within me  
It gives me the strength to believe  
That all that I am and all that Ill ever need is  
Within me
