Dont really know who sent me  
To raise my voice and say  
May the lights in The Land of Plenty  
Shine on the truth some day  
  
I dont know why I come here  
Knowing as I do  
What you really think of me  
What I really think of you  
  
For the millions in a prison  
That wealth has set apart  
For the Christ who has not risen  
From the caverns of the heart  
  
For the innermost decision  
That we cannot but obey  
For whats left of our religion  
I lift my voice and pray  
May the lights in The Land of Plenty  
Shine on the truth some day  
  
I know I said Id meet you  
Id meet you at the store  
But I cant buy it baby  
I cant buy it anymore  
  
And I dont really know who sent me  
To raise my voice and say  
May the lights in The Land of Plenty  
Shine on the truth some day  
  
I dont know why I come here  
Knowing as I do  
What you really think of me  
What I really think of you  
  
For the innermost decision  
That we cannot but obey  
For whats left of our religion  
I lift my voice and pray  
May the lights in The Land of Plenty  
Shine on the truth some day
