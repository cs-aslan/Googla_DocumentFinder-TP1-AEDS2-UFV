Lets get to it  
Make it happen  
Need your touch oh so much  
Dont you see  
Lets get to it right away  
  
Lets get the sun in our day  
Lets turn a spark to a flame  
Lets get this thing on the move  
My heart is longing to prove  
  
That maybe without you  
The world will grow colder  
Come on lets do it  
Before were much older  
  
Chorus  
Lets get to it right now  
Make it happen somehow  
Need your touch oh so much  
Dont you see what Im trying to say  
Lets get to it right away  
  
Lets get the show on the road  
Our love would be solid gold  
Lets put the key to the door  
Dont put it off anymore  
  
Til now its only been dreams  
I have lived for  
Come one lets do it  
cause I want to give more  
  
Chorus  
  
Til now its only been dreams  
I have lived for  
Come one lets do it  
cause I want to give more  
  
Chorus x2
