I bought a bonnet to suit my face  
I had my petticoat trimmed with lace  
I looked at the mirror around I twirled  
And then I went out in the wide wide world  
  
I dreamed of gentlemen I would meet  
I saw them all kneeling at my feet  
I cant understand it my hair is all curled  
But my goodness me its a great big world  
  
Chorus  
And its a cold cold cold and well soon be old  
Alas and a lack its a great big world  
  
I learned to sew and I learned to bake  
I even frosted an angel cake  
On Saturday evening when folks dropped in  
My house was as neat as a brand new pin  
  
I thought by learning each social grace  
A chap might learn to forget my face  
I cant understand it Ive knitted and pearled  
But my goodness me its a great big world  
  
Chorus  
  
I had no petticoat trimmed with lace  
My angel cake was a sure disgrace  
My face was my fortune my mother said  
And my dancing slippers of bright bright red  
  
A million miles Ive danced or more  
In hopes Prince Charming would cross the floor  
I cant understand it Ive Waltzed and Ive whirled  
But my goodness me its a great big world  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
But Ill keep on knitting and doing it well  
My slippers are one thing I never will sell  
My petticoats waiting because who can tell  
Its a great big world its a great big world
