Shes a little girl  
In a rich mans world  
Everything shell do  
Shell do for you  
  
Hes a monster mash  
Living on fame and cash  
Badly spoiled  
A loving dad  
  
Some might say just give it up  
Theres no more hope no fair  
Move the limits  
Ooh wake up the animal in you  
  
Some might say just give it up  
Theres no more hope no fair   
Move the limits  
Ooh wake up the animal in you  
  
Girl cant you see  
Come on now set him free  
Try open up his eyes  
And make him realize his misery  
  
He do not care  
Sittin over there  
Get up stand up now  
Wake up the animal inside of you  
  
I think it should be inside
