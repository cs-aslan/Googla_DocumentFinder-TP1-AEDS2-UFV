Nothing suffocates you more than  
The passing of everyday human events  
Isolation is the oxygen mask you make  
Your children breath into survive  
  
But Im not a slave to god  
That doesnt exist  
And Im not a slave to world  
That doesnt give a shit  
  
And when we were good  
You just closed your eyes  
So when we are bad  
Well scar your minds  
  
Fight Fight Fight Fight  
Fight Fight Fight Fight  
  
Youll never grow up to be a bigrockstar  
Celebratedvictimofyourfame  
Theyll just cut our wrists like  
Cheap coupons and say that death  
Was on sale today  
  
And when we were good  
You just closed your eyes  
So when we are bad  
Well scar your minds  
  
But Im not a slave to god  
That doesnt exist  
And Im not a slave to world  
That doesnt give a shit  
  
The death of one is a tragedy  
The death of one is a tragedy  
The death of one is a tragedy  
The death of millions is just a statistic  
  
But Im not a slave to god  
That doesnt exist  
And Im not a slave to world  
That doesnt give a shit  
But Im not a slave to god  
That doesnt exist  
And Im not a slave to world  
That doesnt give a shit  
  
Fight Fight Fight Fight  
Fight Fight Fight Fight
