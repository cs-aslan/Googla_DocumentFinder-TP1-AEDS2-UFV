Krakatoa youve changed your ways  
from evil days  
Oh I know a once violent isle  
and gentle smile  
When the dust and lava cooled  
you were sterile as the rock from which the earth was tooled  
Was mans beginning a wind borne spore  
to fly no more  
Natures winning her docile spree  
has set her free  
Seeds were wafted on the wind  
forming heavy undergrowth for species winged and finned  
Tangled mangles rebuilt your soil  
from age dead toil  
Sheltered bay coves protecting life  
from Satans knife  
Grow and island in the sun  
where the hell fire belching earth had destructively left none
