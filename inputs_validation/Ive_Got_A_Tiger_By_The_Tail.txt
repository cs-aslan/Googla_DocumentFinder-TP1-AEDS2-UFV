Ive got a tiger by the tail its plain to see  
I wont be much when you get through with me  
Im losing weight and turning mighty pale  
And it looks like Ive got a tiger by the tail  
  
Well every night you drag me where the bright lights are found  
There aint no way to slowin you down  
Im about as helpless as a leaf in a gale  
And it looks like Ive got a tiger by the tail  
  
Ive got a tiger by the tail its plain to see  
I wont be much when you get through with me  
Im losing weight and turning mighty pale  
And it looks like Ive got a tiger by the tail  
  
I thought the day I met you you were meek as a lamb  
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans  
Now the pace weve been living takes the wind from my sails  
And it looks like Ive got a tiger by the tail  
  
Ive got a tiger by the tail its plain to see  
I wont be much when you get through with me  
Im losing weight and turning mighty pale  
And it looks like Ive got a tiger by the tail
