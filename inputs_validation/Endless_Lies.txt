Bye bye pretty woman  
Ive got to leave you now  
I find you never really cared  
  
Stand back take a look at you  
You couldnt care if you wanted to  
You keep saying its gonna change  
But every time it comes back again  
Its a merrygoround  
  
Endless lies shine in your eyes  
  
Its alright count to ten  
It will all be better then  
Its alright the world will go away  
  
Stand back take a look at you  
You couldnt care if you wanted to  
You keep saying its gonna change  
But every time it comes back again  
Its a merrygoround  
  
Endless lies I can see it in your eyes  
The heartbreak is if you could only see  
Thats not the way its supposed to be  
Endless tears that flowed through the years  
You take it all and then you take some more  
Then you come running back to me  
  
Play on pretty music  
Play on and on for me  
Shine on silver stars  
Over the sea  
  
Endless lies I can see it in your eyes  
The heartbreak is if you could only see  
Thats not the way its supposed to be  
  
Endless lies shine in your eyes
