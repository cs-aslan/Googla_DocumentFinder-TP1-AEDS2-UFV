Stars shining bright above you  
Night breezes seem to whisper I love you  
Birds singing in the sycamore tree  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Say nightynight and kiss me  
Just hold me tight and tell me youll miss me  
While Im alone and blue as can be  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Stars fading but I linger on dear  
Still craving your kiss  
Im longing to linger till dawn dear  
Just saying this  
  
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you  
But in your dreams whatever they be  
Dream a little dream of me
