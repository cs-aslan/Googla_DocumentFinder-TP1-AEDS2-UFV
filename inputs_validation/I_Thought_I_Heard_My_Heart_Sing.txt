Well I do what my heart says do  
And right now its pointing at you  
Hey girl youre tuggin on my heart strings  
Well Ive seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
  
I went home flying high  
I met the girl of my dreams tonight  
A wild fire screamin inside  
I know its real cause my heart dont lie  
  
Well I do what my heart says do  
And right now its pointing at you  
Hey girl youre tuggin on my heart strings  
Well Ive seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
  
Well here I am knocking on your door  
This old hound wants to talk a little more  
The TVA and the hoover dam  
Dont turn me on like holding your hand  
  
I do what my heart says do  
And right now its pointing at you  
Hey girl youre tuggin on my heart strings  
Well Ive seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
  
Well I do what my heart says do  
And right now its pointing at you  
Hey girl youre tuggin on my heart strings  
Well Ive seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
  
Well Ive seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
Well Ive seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
Heart sing  
Heart sing  
Heart sing
