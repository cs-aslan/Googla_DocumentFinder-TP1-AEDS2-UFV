Well she first caught my eye a runnin round in shorts  
But she never bothered with her hair  
Just a barefooted chick with all skinned up knees  
Yeah she didnt care what shed wear  
All dressed up for school  
  
Dressed up for school ooo what a turn on  
Dressed up for school ooo what a turn on  
Dressed up for school ooo what a turn on  
All dressed up for school  
  
All summer long she had a crush on me  
But I just couldnt care at all  
But new to school threads really did it for me  
Yeah shes turned into a doll  
All dressed up for school  
  
Dressed up for school ooo what a turn on  
Dressed up for school ooo what a turn on  
Dressed up for school ooo what a turn on  
All dressed up for school

And the guys cant leave her alone  
Now she hardly finds the time to talk to me  
Shes not the little girl Ive always known  
All dressed up for school
