I know this guy  
If Im the mayonnaise hes the cream  
Some sit and wait for the ride  
While others become the scene  
And he can see a Wednesday morning  
Like others see Friday night  
Its all an open book  
Its just how you vandalize  
A double on the shirttail  
While the rest of us split on the seams  
He talks about Art Blakey  
And I pretend to know what he means  
  
So now its three gigs a night  
While your girl digs up the UAE  
And burn up like a matchstick  
The whole damn city can see  
The sun caught me hiding  
Just enough for someone to see  
My heart in my hands the tracks of my glands  
Cracking through the grit in my teeth  
So when did you decide  
That theres only so much you can lose  
The best choices come  
Just when theres nothing left to choose  
  
So you blow up letterboxes and chlorine bombs  
Coz its a weekend blitz on the dicks who just cant whistle the tune  
Yeah and yeah hit while I sit here on my hands  
Measuring compliments with a spoon  
And Im never too far away  
I know this guy  
If Im the mayonnaise hes the cream  
Some sit and wait for the ride  
While others become the scene  
And he can see a Wednesday morning  
Like others see Friday night  
Its all an open book  
Its just how you vandalise
