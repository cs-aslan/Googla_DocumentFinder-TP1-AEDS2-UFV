Send her your love  
With a dozen roses  
Make sure that she knows it  
With a flower from your heart  
  
Show him your love  
Dont hold back your feelings  
You dont need a reason  
When its straight from the heart  
  
Ive heard so many say that the days of romance are no more  
And people falling in love is so old fashioned  
But waiting are they the day they once let slip away  
Hiding need to fulfill their hearts desire for loves passion  
  
Send her your love  
With a dozen roses  
Make sure that she knows it  
With a flower from your heart  
  
Show him your love  
Dont hold back your feelings  
You dont need a reason  
When its straight from the heart  
  
I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal  
And can only happen in make believe stories  
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see  
For around us are miracles of loves glory  
  
Show him your love  
Dont hold back your feelings  
You dont need a reason  
When its straight from the heart
