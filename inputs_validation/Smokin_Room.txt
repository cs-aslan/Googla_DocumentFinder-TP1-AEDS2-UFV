Here we are alone in this old smokin room again  
If your highness is your pleasure its alright  
Cause theres an extra added goodness  
In my heart for you tonight  
If theres any such a thing as god  
He must be here tonight  
  
Aint sayin Im right  
Aint sayin Im wrong  
Aint sayin theres any such a thing as short or long  
It seems you been here many times before  
Its too beautiful but true  
And Im glad I got the chance tonight  
To share my now with you  
  
I used to be locked in a closet and I couldnt find the key  
Used to be youd look my way but not see me  
But its happiness to know that from yourself you cannot hide  
And that heres where I am and its you thats by my side  
  
Aint sayin Im right  
Aint sayin Im wrong  
Aint sayin theres any such a thing as short or long  
It seems you been here many times before  
Its too beautiful but true  
And Im glad I got the chance tonight  
To share my now share my now  
Oh baby baby  oh yeah  
  
So glad I gotcha spend some time  
Spend some time glad I gotcha baby repeat  
  
So glad I gotcha share my life  
Share my life glad I gotcha baby repeat
