There are no monks in my band  
There are no saints in this land  
Ill be doin all I can  
If I die an honest man  
  
Confusion is my middle name  
Ask me again Ill tell you the same  
Persuaded by one sexy dame  
No I do not feel no shame  
  
You are on the road  
Can I get a little lovin from you  
Can I get a little bit of that done did do  
You are on the road  
Tell me now girl that you need me too  
Tell me now girl cause Ive got a feeling for you  
  
Every man has certain needs  
Talkin bout them dirty deeds  
To these needs I must concede  
Livin by my lowly creed  
  
Woman please know that Im good  
Know that I did all I could  
But yes its true likelihood  
Of being great is not so good  
  
You are on the road  
Can I get a little lovin from you  
Can I get a little bit of that done did do  
You are on the road  
Tell me now girl that you need me too  
Tell me now girl cause Ive got a feeling for you  
  
There are no monks in my band  
There are no saints in this land  
Ill be doin all I can  
If I die an honest man  
  
Virtue slipped into my shoe  
No I will not misconstrue  
More rockin more rockin now doobley do  
Dancin down your avenue  
  
You are on the road  
Can I get a little lovin from you  
Can I get a little bit of that done did do  
You are on the road  
Tell me now girl that you need me too  
Tell me now girl cause Ive got a feeling for you
