The hardest thing you ever do is love yourself that gal dont love you  
Shell cause you sleepless nights and endless pain  
But if you dont like the rules dont play the game  
Every time that girl walks by your heart will ache your very soul will die  
But love one sided its just yourself to blame  
And if you dont like the rules dont play the game  
  
You think by now I see the fool Ive been given my heart a chance to win  
Well I do but I dont I will but I wont deep inside I know Ill do again  
The hardest thing you ever do is love yourself that gal dont love you  
With love one sided its just yourself to blame  
And if you dont like the rules dont play the game  
If you dont like the rules dont play the game
