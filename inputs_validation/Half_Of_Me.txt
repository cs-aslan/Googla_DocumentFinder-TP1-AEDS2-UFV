You saw me on the television setting fire to all the buildings  
Yeah I guess you saw me stealing but youve no idea what Ive been needin  
Talk about when we were children not the kind of kid that you believe in  
You saw me on the television saw me on the television  
But thats just the half of it yeah you saw the half of it  
This is the life I live and thats just the half of it  
  
Saw me on the television hanging out my dirty linen  
Youre entitled to your own opinion  
Sit and shake your head at my decision  
I guess the kind of songs that Ive been singing  
Make it seem as if Im always winning  
But you saw me on a television  
Yeah you saw me on a television  
  
But thats just the half of it  
You saw the half of it  
This is the life I live  
And thats just the half of it  
  
Oh you know me Im the life of the party  
Beautiful people surround me  
Everybody falling in love  
Oh you know me everybody knows that Im crazy  
Sticks and stones they never break me  
And Im the type that dont give a fuck  
  
And thats just the half of it  
You saw the half of it  
Yeah this is the life I live  
And thats just the half of it  
  
Yeah you saw the half of it  
And this is the life I live  
You saw the half of it  
Only the half of it  
Eh oh no  
  
You saw me on the television  
Saw me on the television
