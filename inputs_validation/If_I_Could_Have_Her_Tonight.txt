All of a sudden she was on my mind  
I wasnt ready for her kind  
And she was taking her time  
  
What if she came to me  
Would she be kind  
And if she stayed with me  
Do you think that shed like to do anything  
I would or would she leave me  
  
Lately Ive found myself losing my mind  
Knowing how badly I need her  
Its something hard to find  
  
What if she came to me  
Would she be kind  
And if she stayed with me  
Do you think that shed like to do anything  
I would or would she leave me  
  
If I could have her tonight  
Does she want to go  
Look at those eyes  
Does she want it  
If I could have her tonight  
  
If I could have her tonight  
If I could have her tonight
