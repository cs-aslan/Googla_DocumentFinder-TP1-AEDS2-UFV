I came back to my old city  
With fierce determination  
And I couldnt find my way out of the station  
  
Its all changed  
You were there  
Departing starting  
A trek I had once took  
With that noones gonna stop me when I feel this way look  
  
Apparent apparent  
Heir apparent  
You think its so easy I tell you  it isnt  
But you may change minds with your winning smile  
  
I fell down in my old city  
Such sad degradation  
So I tried to make my way back to the station  
  
You were still there  
Gleaming and leaving  
Wideeyed and awestruck  
Saying How can anybody hate me  
If I love them first off   
  
Apparent apparent  
Heir apparent  
You think its so easy I tell you  it isnt  
But you may change minds with your winning smile  
  
Heir heir heir  
Heir heir heir  
Heir heir heir  
Heir heir heir  
But you may be OK I dont know  
  
Ill see you back here  
In a few bruised years  
Pray  
Ill see you here  
Ill see you here  
Ill see you here  
  
Apparent apparent  
Heir apparent  
You say that you want it Im sure that youll get it  
Theyll seduce your heart and then theyll slap your arse  
  
Heir heir heir  
Heir heir heir  
Heir heir heir  
Heir heir heir
