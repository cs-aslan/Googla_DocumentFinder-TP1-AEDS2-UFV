You shouldve told me when it all began  
You shouldve told me long ago  
Someday I know youre gonna find  
Just one mistake is not enough to change my mind  
  
Whats now is now  
And Ill forget what happened then  
I know it all  
And we can still begin again  
  
And if the doubting faces made you go  
Its only mine that matters now  
Those looks will soon begin to fade  
If you come back and show them all youre not afraid  
  
Whats now is now  
And Ill forget what happened then  
I know it all  
And we can still begin again  
  
Now that you know how much I understand  
You have no reason to be gone  
And if you feel at all like me  
Just let me know Ill make it like it used to be  
  
Whats now is now  
And Ill forget what happened then  
I know it all  
And we can still begin again  
Whats now is now  
And Ill forget what happened then  
I know it all I know it all  
And we can still begin again  
Whats now is now now is now
