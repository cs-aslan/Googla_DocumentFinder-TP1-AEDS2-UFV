Well I lived on the outskirts of town  
In an eight room farmhouse baby  
When my brothers and friends were around  
There was always somethin doin  
Had me a couple of real nice girlfriends  
Stopped by to see me every once in a while  
When I think back about those days  
All I can do is sit and smile  
  
Chorus  
Thats when a sport was a sport  
And groovin was groovin  
And dancin meant everything  
We were young and we were improvin  
Laughin laughin with our friends  
Holdin hands meant somethin baby  
Outside the club Cherry Bomb  
Our hearts were really thumpin  
Say yeah yeah yeah  
Say yeah yeah yeah  
  
The winter days they last forever  
But the weekends went by so quick  
Went ridin around this little country town  
We were goin nuts girl out in the sticks  
One night me with my big mouth  
A couple guys had to put me in my place  
When I see those guys these days  
We just laugh and we say do you remember when  
  
Chorus  
Thats when a sport was a sport  
And groovin was groovin  
And dancin meant everything  
We were young and we were improvin  
Laughin laughin with our friends  
Holdin hands meant somethin baby  
Outside the club Cherry Bomb  
Our hearts were really thumpin  
Say yeah yeah yeah  
Say yeah yeah yeah  
  
Alright  
  
Say yeah yeah yeah  
Say yeah yeah yeah  
  
Seventeen has turned thirtyfive  
Im surprised that were still livin  
If weve done any wrong  
I hope that were forgiven  
Got a few kids of my own  
And some days I still dont know what to do  
I hope that theyre not laughing too loud  
When they hear me talkin  
Like this to you  
  
Chorus  
Thats when a sport was a sport  
And groovin was groovin  
And dancin meant everything  
We were young and we were improvin  
Laughin laughin with our friends  
Holdin hands meant so much baby  
Outside the club Cherry Bomb  
Our hearts were really thumpin  
Say yeah yeah yeah  
Say yeah yeah yeah
