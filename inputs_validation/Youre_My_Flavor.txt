The way you love me  
Is like a needle in my vein  
When youre not around me  
You know it just dont feel the same  
  
And Ive waited a long time  
Just to feel the way I do  
Just give me the reason  
And I will be all over you  
  
Cause youre my flavor of love  
Youre my flavor Im dreaming of  
Youre my flavor of love  
Youre my flavor Im dreaming of  
  
The way you touch me  
Somehow it takes away the pain  
And now Im a junkie  
Im running around without a brain  
  
I got the jones deep inside me  
And you are what I want to do  
You give me this feeling  
You always make me feel brand new  
  
Cause youre my flavor of love  
Youre my flavor Im dreaming of  
Youre my flavor of love  
Youre my flavor Im dreaming of  
  
Flavor Ouh come on  
Cause youre my flavor Im dreaming of  
Youre my flavor of love  
Youre my flavor Im dreaming of
