First you say you want me  
Then you dont want me really  
Baby do I scare you  
Am I talkin too freely  
  
I got no perspective  
On the things that you lack  
Baby I dont care  
Just lie on your back  
  
Baby Im crazy  
But lady Im lazy  
Amaze me  
Baby Im fading  
My mind is all jaded  
Amaze me  
  
Im so superstitious  
So theres something you should know  
The reason Im doing you is  
Cause your friend said no  
  
Ive been suicidal since  
God I dont know  
So get down on your knees  
Say your prayers Amen  
  
Baby Im crazy  
Lady Im lazy  
Amaze me  
Baby Im faded  
My mind is all jaded  
  
Give me Texas wisdom  
Massive systems  
And a luscious behind  
Mother said Son if you do  
It too long youll go blind  
  
Baby Im lazy  
But lady Im crazy  
Amaze me  
Baby Im faded  
One two  
  
Everybody getting cash for the bung  
Everybody wants to know how Im hung  
You can read it in the papers  
Im a giver not a taker  
But it wont be the same  
  
Everybody getting cash for the bung
