Im a broken biscuit  
From the cookie jar  
Im a total misfit  
In the puzzle thats so far  
Careful not to crush me  
In those hungry hands  
Careful not to rush me  
Into this fine romance  
  
Chorus  
I stand under the weight of your words  
Hoping you wont find me  
Im terrified of everything Ive heard  
Dont swallow  
  
Im a damaged dollar  
That no one wants to change  
Im a bunch of flowers  
That need to be arranged  
Careful what you wish for  
Careful what you say  
Ive lowered all my armor  
Risking the pain again  
  
Chorus  
  
Im standing on the edge of your words  
That is where youll find me  
Im paralyzed by all the things that hurt  
But Im coming  
  
Chorus  
  
Im standing on the edge of your words  
Standing on the edge of your words  
Im paralyzed by all the things that hurt  
But Im coming
