a capella she said boy your luck is running out She make me feel like a
stranger In my own house  
I come stumbling in at a quarter to three  
To the sound of my own dog growlin at me  
Im scared to move or turn on a light  
Youve got me creepin around in the dark  
Like a thief in the night  
Ive got no excuse I should have known  
Ive got no place to live  
I never feel at home  
  
I walk into the kitchen to see whats there  
Im tired and Im hungry but the cupboards bare  
Ive been working all day and all night too  
I cant believe this is all I have to come back to  
  
I guess Ill take a look upstairs in the danger zone  
I wonder what Im doing here  
When I never feel at home  
  
Im a stranger in my own house  
Ive got the keys to the door  
But Im still locked out  
Im a stranger in my own house  
Ill huff and Ill puff and Ill blow this house down  
Cant be a stranger in my own house  
  
I see the do not disturb sign on my bedroom door  
What is this sheet and pillow laying on the floor  
I wore out my welcome  
I hear you loud and clear  
Its time to get a few things straight around here  
  
Ive got no excuse I should have known  
Ive got a place to live but I never feel at home  
Im just a stranger in my own house  
Ive got the keys to the door  
But Im still locked out  
Stranger in my own house  
Ill huff and Ill puff and Ill blow this house down  
Cant be a stranger in my own house  
  
Ive got no excuse I should have known  
With a woman like you Im better off alone  
Im a stranger in my own house  
Ive got the keys to the door  
But Im still locked out  
Im just a stranger in my own house  
Oh honey Im home  
Im just a stranger in my own house  
Im just a stranger in my own house  
You got a lion on your hands girl not a mouse  
Im just a stranger in my own house  
Im just a stranger in my own house  
Well somebodys got to go  
Stranger  
Stranger
