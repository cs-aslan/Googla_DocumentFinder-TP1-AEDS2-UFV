Yeah  
Slow French kissing with the Dauphins daughter  
If I fall in love now Ill be floating in Seine  
Plastered in Paris Ive had an Eiffel  
Gonna make my escape on the midnight train  
Choo choo to you  Choo choo to you  Charting the single  
Schnapping my fingers on an alcoholiday  
Sniff round a Fraulein when Im scent to Cologne  
All night hotel Liebling make your mark  
Let sugar daddy melt in his home sweet home  
Home is where the heart lies but if the heart lies  
Where is home is where the heart lies but where is home  
  
Get a pizza the action when I Romeo again  
Chianti see you with me so just let him wine  
Juliet on the balcony its pasta serenade  
Wedding rings I know when Venice time Venice time  
To chart the single to chart the single  
  
Charting the single charting the single  
The chicks are getting cheaper on the not so common market  
Stockpile experience before the blond hairs turn to grey  
Before the blond hairs turn to grey  
I like to train express myself in the universal language  
Ego on my face in the nicest possible way  
Its absolutely the nicest possible way  
  
Charting the single  
I got no clause in my contract got no shares in my name  
Im just charting the single in a bachelors game  
Charting the single  
Its a solo performance on a one way street  
Youll never have the chance again and never again well meet  
Charting charting charting charting the single
