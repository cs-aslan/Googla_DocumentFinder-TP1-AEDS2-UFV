I just looked to see the sun outside  
  
Its shining so bright  
  
A sun the clouds cant hide  
  
Do you remember the time that you hear me say  
  
  
  
I like to play games that two can play  
  
Ah ha ha ha haaa  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Whoa whoa whoa  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
  
  
No more  
  
  
  
The juke box daddies been blowin my mind  
  
I aint goin nowhere I got lots of time  
  
Im fat as a cow oh howd I ever get this way  
  
  
  
I like to play games that two can play  
  
Ah ha ha ha haaa  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Whoa whoa whoa  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
  
  
No more  
  
  
  
In the morning people are so happy  
  
And thats the time when Im a mister bussinessman  
  
Later on I really get to goin yeah  
  
I get my motor runnin  
  
I get my legs to movin  
  
  
  
Its just no good unless two can play  
  
Ah ha haaaa  
  
  
  
I was layin on my back  
  
Relaxin in the night  
  
I played my radio  
  
It was out of sight  
  
Joe South was singing  
  
Games People Play  
  
  
  
And I like to play games that two can play  
  
Ah ha ha ha haaa  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Whoa whoa whoa  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
  
  
Yeaheeah  
  
Ah ha ha ha haaa
