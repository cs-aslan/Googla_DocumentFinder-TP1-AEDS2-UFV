Peaceful like heaven on a Sunday  
Wishful not thinking what to do  
Weve been calling it love  
But its a dream were going through  
  
And if I only had one love  
Yours would be the one Id choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one Id choose  
  
Restful like Devon on a Monday  
Cooling my fingers in the bay  
Weve been learning a song  
But its a long and lonely blues  
  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one Id choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one Id choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one Id choose  
  
Its peaceful like heaven on a Sunday  
Wishful not thinking what to do  
Weve been calling it love  
But its a dream were going through  
  
And if I only had one love  
Yours would be the one Id choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one Id choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one Id choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one Id choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one Id choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one Id choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one Id choose  
If I only had one love
