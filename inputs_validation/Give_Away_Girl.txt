Not long ago while dancin  
Our eyes by chance did meet  
Though you were with your boyfriend  
You swept me off my feet  
  
So foolishly as I cut in  
To hope for new romance  
I hardly had you in my arms  
When someone sought your glance  
  
Your just a giveaway giveaway giveaway girl  
Youre careless with your charms  
Just like a giveaway giveaway giveaway girl  
Youll never get in anyones arms  
  
Youre everybodys sweetheart  
You never stick to one  
Youll play the field forever  
As long as you have fun  
  
Youll take almost and bandit  
You love variety  
Whoever might be handy  
Youll fall for stupidly  
  
Your just a giveaway giveaway giveaway girl  
Youre careless with your charms  
Just like a giveaway giveaway giveaway girl  
Youll never get in anyones arms  
  
You give your kisses freely  
You throw your heart away  
You never stopped to think  
That someday you will have to pay  
  
But by the time you wake up  
Youre best days will be gone  
The sweetest words that you will hear  
Will be please leave me along
