I dream of birds birds without wings  
Children who grew up to be dangerous things  
I was known as the postman I worked through the night  
I made my deliveries sink out of sight  
  
We would wrap them wrap them up  
Anything to shut them up  
Had to stitch them stitch them up  
See how they fly  
See how they fly  
  
Wed hold them in the center till we were all done  
Wed turn up the music and have some fun  
Youre on your way out thats what they were told  
And wed mock them and drug them till our stupor took its hold  
  
We would wrap them wrap them up  
Anything to shut them up  
Had to stitch them stitch them up  
See how they fly  
See how they fly  
  
Fly out low some way offshore  
The sacking covers up their heads  
Dont want to look into their eyes  
As I push them through the open door
