From where I stand  
I can see through you  
From where youre sitting pretty one  
I know it got to you  
  
I see the stars in your eyes  
You want the truth but you need the lies  
Like Judy Garland like Valentino  
You give your life for rock n roll  
Uh huh  
  
Stand were on a landslide of love  
You got everything you want  
But what you need you give away  
  
For primitive love  
And a ride on the mystery train  
A primitive love  
A room at the Heart  
The Heartbreak Hotel  
A room at the Heartbreak  
Heartbreak Hotel  
A room at the Heartbreak  
Heartbreak Hotel  
  
You say its love its not the money  
You let them suck your life out like honey  
Turning tricks youre on the street  
Selling your kisses so bittersweet  
  
Gospel voices  
  
A primitive love  
A and a ride on the mystery train  
A primitive love  
A room at the Heart  
The Heartbreak Hotel  
  
A room at the Heartbreak the Heartbreak  
The Heartbreak Hotel Hotel  
Repeat until end
