Writhing and screaming the pain just wont go  
Hell show you no mercy  
Your image in his hands its useless to try  
Escaping his curses  
  
The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls  
  
Tourted and flaming youll give birth to hell  
Living a nightmare  
It is a pity youll pray for your death  
But hes in no hurry  
  
The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls  
  
Chorus  
Nowhere to run  
Your fate is in his hands  
Your time has come  
Youll live to his command  
Im warning you  
The worst is yet to come  
The killer who  
Remains a mystery  
  
I that believe in the stories of old  
Would never fight it  
Demons and curses that play on your soul  
Like something ignited  
  
You never imagined such a fate could follow you  
You never thought it was true  
And when its your time I wonder how  
And what youll do  
Your kinds of troubles running deeper than the sea  
So what you gonna do about it  
You brokethe rule  
Youve beena fool  
The little doll is you yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Writhing and screaming the pain just wont go  
Hell show you no mercy  
Your image in his hands its useless to try  
Escaping his curses  
  
Chorus
