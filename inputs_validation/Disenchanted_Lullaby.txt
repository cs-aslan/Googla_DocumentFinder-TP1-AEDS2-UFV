Disenchanted Lullaby  
Sing me yours Ill sing you mine  
Sing with me now whats a boy to do  
Whats a boy to do  
Sing along for yesterday  
Sing along my soul today  
Sing along another song for you  
Whats a boy to do  
  
I may be scattered  
A little shattered  
What does it matter  
No one has a fit like I do  
  
I may be scattered  
A little shattered  
What does it matter  
No one has a fit like I do  
Im the only one thats fits you  
  
Whispering to pass the time  
Whisper for the days gone by  
Whisper with the voice inside of you  
With this ring you will be mine  
With this ring Ill multiply  
With this ring surrendering to you  
Whats a boy to do
