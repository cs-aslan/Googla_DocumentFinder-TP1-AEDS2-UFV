In my perfect isolation  
I can stay here for awhile  
Antidotes and revelations  
Just extend my own exile  
  
Wasting away  
The worlds right in front of me  
Funny you should say  
That its all in my head  
Wasting away  
Were hitting rock bottom  
And going down in flames  
Well its not that bad  
  
With my lack of observation  
I can stay in here for days  
Could you find my motivation  
I cant see it through this haze  
  
Wasting away  
The worlds right in front of me  
Funny you should say  
That its all in my head  
Wasting away  
Were hitting rock bottom  
And going down in flames  
Well its not that bad  
  
Wishing away  
The worlds right in front of me  
Call me anyway  
Cause its all in my head  
Wasting away  
Were hitting rock bottom  
And going down in flames  
Well its not that bad  
  
Wasting all my days  
What would Ivan say  
Wasting all my days  
What would Ivan say  
  
Wasting away  
Were hitting rock bottom  
Call me anyway  
Cause I got two friends  
Wasting away  
Were going down together  
And all in all its not so bad  
All in all its not so bad  
  
Its hard to know  
Where to start and where to go  
I will never say these words again
