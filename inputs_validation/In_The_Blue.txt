Some days I barely miss you some days Im almost alright  
And some nights I turn to kiss you but youre not beside my side  
Got this same damn conversation playing over and over in my mind  
Yeah my heart is wet and heavy but my bodys on the run  
Cause the night is gonna get me and its only just begun  
I keep livin on the memory of you and me you me in the Sun  
  
No matter where you are  
A little piece of my heart  
Will be forever with you  
In the blue in the blue  
In a thousand years  
Well be far from here  
Ill be forever with you  
In the blue in the blue  
  
Yeah Im runnin from this city like a diamond in the sky  
And Im tryna count my blessings stead of all the tears Ive cried  
I keep driving in this darkness to get you to get you off my mind  
Ill start over in a new place put my feet back on the ground  
Cant believe the mess that Ive made just tryna drown you out  
Baby one day I wont miss you Ill stop looking for you in the crowd  
  
No matter where you are  
A little piece of my heart  
Will be forever with you  
In the blue in the blue  
In a thousand years  
Well be far from here  
Ill be forever with you  
In the blue in the blue  
  
I see your face in every stranger  
Footsteps down the hall  
Warm breath back of my neck  
Shadows on the wall  
And your voice is loud as thunder  
I can hear it crashing in my head  
  
No matter where you are  
A little piece of my heart  
Will be forever with you  
In the blue in the blue  
In a thousand years  
Well be far from here  
Ill be forever with you  
In the blue in the blue
