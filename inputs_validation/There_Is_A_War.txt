There is a war between the rich and poor  
A war between the man and the woman  
There is a war between the ones who say there is a war  
And the ones who say there isnt  
Why dont you come on back to the war thats right get in it  
Why dont you come on back to the war its just beginning  
  
Well I live here with a woman and a child  
The situation makes me kind of nervous  
Yes I rise up from her arms she says I guess you call this love  
I call it service  
  
Why dont you come on back to the war dont be a tourist  
Why dont you come on back to the war before it hurts us  
Why dont you come on back to the war lets all get nervous  
  
You cannot stand what Ive become  
You much prefer the gentleman I was before  
I was so easy to defeat I was so easy to control  
I didnt even know there was a war  
  
Why dont you come on back to the war dont be embarrassed  
Why dont you come on back to the war you can still get married  
  
There is a war between the rich and poor  
A war between the man and the woman  
There is a war between the left and right  
A war between the black and white  
A war between the odd and the even  
  
Why dont you come on back to the war pick up your tiny burden  
Why dont you come on back to the war lets all get even  
Why dont you come on back to the war cant you hear me speaking
