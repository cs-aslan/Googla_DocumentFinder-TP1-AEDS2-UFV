The vow of love you broken  
The law of love has spoken  
to you  
  
Oh why couldnt you be true Why couldnt you be true  
Why couldnt you be true Why couldnt you be true  
  
So long baby  
You know its so hard

I guess its just meant for me to be unhappy  
But I believe I really do believe that somewhere someone is waiting for me
