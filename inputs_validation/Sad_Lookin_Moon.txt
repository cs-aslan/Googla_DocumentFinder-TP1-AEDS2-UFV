Written by randy owen teddy gentry and greg fowler  
I thought that you could fly i thought that you had wings  
I guess that i believed youd never say goodbye  
But my world stopped turnin round the stars turned upside down  
It knocked me to the ground on my knees  
  
Chorus  
Now theres a sad lookin moon shinin down on me  
Theres a sad lookin sky as far as i can see  
I always believed and i thought the stars could see  
But theres a sad lookin moon shinin down on me  
  
I shared with you my dreams i gave you everything  
I opened up my heart and i gave you my ring  
Well i spent days and nights just thinkin about the time  
When you would be mine all my life  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a sad lookin moon  
A sad lookin moon  
Theres a sad lookin moon  
Shinin down on me
