Also released on the From Dusk Till Dawn soundtrack  
  
Everything about her was natural  
Everything about her was cool  
But Im a little partial for beautiful girls  
Even if they blood runs blue  
  
I think I see her  
I think I want her  
I think I love her  
Shes just killing me  
I think shes killing me  
  
Her castanets are enormous  
Her bongo beat absolute  
And when she doin midnite performances  
Shes got a secret somethin to boot  
  
I think I see her  
I think I want her  
Oh I think I love her  
But shes just killing me  
I think shes killing me  
  
Miss Satanic Pandemonia  
Dont get any lower or slower  
What you see is what you get conmigo  
And the bonus of an albino boa  
  
I think I see her  
I think I want her  
Yes I think I love her  
Shes just killing me  
Shes just killing me  
Thats some time I had  
  
I think I see her  
I know I love her  
Yes I might love her  
Shes just killing me  
She want to be killing me  
Suck my blood
