Lyin alone in this big old bed  
I got you on my mind  
I said when you left  
I could make it by myself  
But it gets harder all the time  
And I cant take it no more  
I see your face  
Every time I close my eyes  
So Im goin out now  
And Im lookin for you  
Some winter night  
I want you out of my head  
And back in my bed  
Before the mornin sun comes up  
I cant stand another night  
Without holdin me tight  
How I miss your lovin touch  
Im goin searchin  
Everywhere that a you might be  
When I find you Im a bringin you home with me  
I want you out of my head  
And back in my bed  
Before the mornin comes  
Well I might find somebody new  
To share my misery  
But no other man  
Can do what you can  
When it comes to lovin me  
I dont want nobody to say that I was a fool  
For bein cool  
I wont be satisfied till youre back in my arms  
And Im lovin you  
I want you out of my head  
And back in my bed  
Before the mornin sun comes up  
I cant stand another night  
Without you holdin me tight  
How I miss your lovin touch  
Im goin searchin  
Everywhere that a you might be  
And when I find you  
Im a bringin you home with me  
I want you out of my head  
And back in my bed  
Before the mornin comes  
I want you out of my head  
And back in my bed  
Before the mornin sun comes up  
I cant stand another night  
Without you holdin me tight  
How I miss your lovin touch  
Im goin searchin  
Everywhere that a you might be  
FADES  
A when I find you  
Im a bringin you home with me  
I want you out of my head  
And back in my bed  
Before the mornin comes
