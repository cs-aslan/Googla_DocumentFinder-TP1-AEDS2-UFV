You dont know what I feel I get behind the wheel  
A fuel in my soul  
I hyperventilate as I accelerate  
Till Ive lost all control  
  
My speed becomes relentless  
And testing all my senses  
White line appearing faster  
Prompting death and disaster  
  
My supersonic machine  
Get out of my  
  
Fast lane like a jet plane  
Like a freight train Im driving insane  
Addicted to the fast lane  
Rushing to my brain  
No time to explain this is my domain  
Addicted to the fast lane  
  
I look into mirror red lights are drawing nearer  
They think Ive met my match  
But I shift into high gear soon they just disappear  
You cant jail what you cant catch  
  
My speed becomes relentless  
And testing all my senses  
White line appearing faster  
Prompting death and dddisaster  
  
I hear the engines screaming  
Im burning up the  
  
Fast lane like a jet plane  
Like a freight train Im driving insane  
Addicted to the fast lane  
Rushing to my brain  
No time to explain this is my domain  
Fast lane  
  
Fast lane like a jet plane  
Like a freight train this is my domain
