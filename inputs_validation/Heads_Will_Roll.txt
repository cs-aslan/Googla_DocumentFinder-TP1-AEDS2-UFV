Off with your head  
Dance til youre dead  
Heads will roll  
Heads will roll  
Heads will roll  
On the floor  
  
Glitter on the west streets  
Silver over everything  
The rivers all wet  
Youre all chrome  
  
Dripping with alchemy  
Shiver stop shivering  
The glitters all wet  
Youre all chrome  
  
The men cry out the girls cry out  
The men cry out the girls cry out  
The men cry out oh no  
  
The men cry out the girls cry out  
The men cry out the girls cry out  
The men cry out oh no  
  
Off off with your head  
Dance dance til youre dead  
Heads will roll  
Heads will roll  
Heads will roll  
On the floor  
  
You came last  
Take the past  
Shut your eyes  
Realize  
  
You came last  
Take the past  
Shut your eyes  
Realize  
  
Glitter on the west streets  
Silver over everything  
The glitters all wet  
Youre all chrome  
Youre all chrome  
  
Oh oh  
Oh  
Oh oh  
  
Off off off with your head  
Dance dance dance til youre dead  
Off off off with your head  
Dance dance dance til youre dead  
Off off off with your head  
Dance dance dance til youre dead  
  
Off off off with your head  
Dance dance dance til youre dead  
Off off off with your head  
Dance dance dance til youre dead  
Off off off with your head  
Dance dance dance til youre dead
