On the Chisholm Trail it was midnight Carmela was strong on his mind  
Because of the life he had chosen Carmela had left then behind  
Too long hed been a bandito Carmela had left him alone  
But today someone brought a message shed be seen in old San Antone  
Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn  
Cross the Brazos at Waco Im safe when I reach San Antone  
  
He glanced back over his shoulder the posse were nowhere in sight  
Hed sent for Carmela to meet him at the banks of the Brazos tonight  
She was waiting and he kept the promise hed made such a long time ago  
As he dropped the guns that she hated in the mighty Brazos below  
Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn  
Cross the Brazos at Waco Ill walk straight in old San Antone  
  
Then the night came alight with gun fire he knew that at last hed been found  
As the rangers band shoot brightly and bandito laid on the ground  
Carmela knew he was dying that all of her dreams were in vain  
As she kissed his lips for the last time she heard him whisper again  
Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn  
Cross the Brazos at Waco Im safe when I reach San Antone  
  
Im safe when I reach San Antone
