Marigolds are very much in love but he doesnt mind  
Picking up his sister he makes his way into the seas or land  
All the way she smiles  
She goes up while he goes down down  
Sits on a stick in the river  
Laughter in his sleep  
Sisters throwing stones hoping for a hit  
He doesnt know so then  
She goes up while he goes down down  
Another time another day  
A brothers way to leave  
Another time another day  
  
Shell be selling plastic flowers on a Sunday afternoon  
  
Picking up weeds she hasnt got the time to care  
All can see hes not there  
She grows up for another man and hes down  
Another time another day  
A brothers way to leave  
Another time another day  
Another time another day  
A brothers way to leave
