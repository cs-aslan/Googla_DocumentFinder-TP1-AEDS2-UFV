In the later forties  
When Diddy Levine lived with Eunice King  
He gave her the ring that she wore  
Janice the smiling daughter  
Who came from a marriage way before  
But Eunice was the father that she always saw  
Though they never never never never never never told her  
She always knew the score  
You see kids were so much wiser after the wars  
But Diddy hadnt had enough she had to get some more  
On a ration piece of paper  
She wrote Eunice Im not sure  
And with her child in her arms  
She went looking for a fling  
Besides she didnt like the name Mrs King  
The first time that she heard Damper Dan  
Was on the radio  
Crooning at a volume that was way way down low  
Diddy was surprised to hear that Dampers name was Dan  
Soon after he was a calling  
And he asked begged and pleaded for her hand  
Dampers heart was dampened  
When Diddy answered No no no no no  
But if she changed her mind she said Dan Ill let you know  
With her child in her arms  
She went looking for a man  
Besides she didnt like the name Damper Dan  
Janice the smiling daughter grew up to be a teenage queen  
Through all of her mothers lovers  
She kept the name Levine  
Behind the picture house she first made her scene  
Liked a boy called Allister  
Who was dating a friend called Celine  
And Celine wasnt mad when Janet came in between  
But Allister got scared when he heard  
And he joined the USA Marines  
Inheritance you see runs through every family  
Who is to say what is to be is any better  
Over and over it goes goodness and badness wind blow  
Over and over over and over  
Over and over and over and over and over and over and over  
The good wind and the bad wind blow
