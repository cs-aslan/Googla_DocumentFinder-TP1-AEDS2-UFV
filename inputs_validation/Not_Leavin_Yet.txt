Come lie next to me Jesus Christ  
Holes in hand where a cross used to fit just right  
The meeting called the topic a ladies fate  
You dont have to remind me  
I wont be late  
  
Please excuse me Im sorry I just cant wait  
And dont use grandfather as the bait  
  
Down the hall the baby boy just born  
Rosary around a crown of thorns  
  
Please excuse me Im sorry I just cant wait  
And dont use grandfather as the bait  
  
Cant you see the ladys not ready  
Hands and fee are bound and unsteady  
In the hall the familys grieving  
Im the one who stays  
Im not leavin yet
