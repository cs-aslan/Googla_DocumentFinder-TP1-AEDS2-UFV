Though men may strife to go  
Beyond the reap of space  
To walk beyond the distance shining stars  
This worlds a room so small  
Within my masters house  
The open skys but a portion of his yard  
How big is God how big and wide is his domain  
To try to tell these lips can only start  
Hes big enough to rule the mighty universe  
Yet small enough to live within my heart  
  
As winter chill may cause the tiny seed to fall  
To lie asleep till wake by summers rain  
The heart grown cold will warm  
And trod with life anew  
The Masters touch will bring the glow again  
How big is God
