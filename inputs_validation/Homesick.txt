Homesick and lonely Im worried and blue  
I want to see the baby and the babys mama too  
Im so tired of roamin Im about to lose my mind  
Homesick and lonesome for that gal of mine  
Mean old trouble is all that Ive known  
Im missing my honey and boys Im going home  
If shell just let me tarry when I come draggin in  
You couldnt take a shotgun and run me off again  
This old boys got misery deep down in his soul  
This old worlds too big and this old worlds too cold  
Ill be ridin that freight train when she comes down the tracks  
And next time you see me leave Ill be flat on my back  
  
Fiddle  
  
I never knew a body could ever feel so low  
I have often asked myself why did I ever go  
Im a headin home and this time there Im gonna park  
And if she wants a new dog then Im gonna learn to bark  
Homesick and lonely  
Homesick and lonesome for that gal of mine
