When I was young times were hard  
When I got older it was worse  
First words I ever heard  
Nobody move nobody get hurt  
  
Its the long arm its the strong arm  
Its the long arm of the law  
Its the long arm its the strong arm  
Its the long arm of the law  
  
After the war in Paraguay  
Back in nineteen ninetynine  
I was laying low in Lima  
Working both sides of the borderline  
  
Its the long arm its the strong arm  
Its the long arm of the law  
  
You can run but you cant hide  
  
Well I have to live like a fugitive  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
Someones coming after me  
And Im running running yeah  
  
Now dont protest your innocence  
Only the dead get off scott free  
And when the judge says Whodunit  
Youll be crying Not me Not me
