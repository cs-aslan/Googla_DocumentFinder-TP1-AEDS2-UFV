I send flowers everyday  
But you just turn them away  
And my letters go unanswered  
So it seems  
  
Was I just too blind to see  
That youd given up on me  
And its over now  
Your broken heart wont mend  
  
Just one more dance  
Why dont we try  
Holding each other  
While the world stands still  
  
You and I were so much in love  
And I would give anything  
For the chance at romance  
Just one more dance  
  
Well I know Ive been a fool  
And I know that Ive been cruel  
When you give your love completely  
Heart and soul  
  
Let it slipped right through my hands  
Cant you ever understand  
Ive never felt this kind of love before  
  
Just one more dance  
Why dont we try  
Holding each other  
While the world stands still  
  
You and I are so much in love  
And I would give anything  
For the chance at romance  
Just one more dance  
  
My love has no pride  
Im dying inside  
Im down on my knees  
Im down on my knees  
For your love  
  
Just one more dance  
Why dont we try  
Holding each other  
While the world stands still  
  
You and I are so much in love  
And I would give anything  
For the chance at romance  
Just one more dance  
  
Why dont we try  
For the chance at romance  
Just one more time  
  
Why dont we try  
For the chance at romance  
Just one more time
