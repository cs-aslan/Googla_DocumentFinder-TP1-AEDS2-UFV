Im not much for making little wishes  
But Id like a little wish  
To come true for you  
Im not talking about loaves and fishes  
But I wish that there was something  
I could do for you  
Heres a little bit of cheap advice  
To be taken in an hour of need  
Dont assume that the life you left  
Is the life you have to lead  
  
When you come home what you gonna do  
Oh brother oh brother  
Dont you try to deny what you know to be true  
The same mess of misery  
That you done been through  
Standing in line and its waiting for you  
One kiss leads to another brother  
When you come back home  
  
Id like to know whos knocking on door  
Id like to know what they come here for  
Youd like to say no but the words wont come  
Come in and sit down  
Seem to roll off your tongue  
You forget to remember  
To never die young  
One kiss leads to another  
Brother when you come back home  
Standing in line all of your friends  
Standing in line party never ends  
Standing in line the river flows  
The river bends  
Standing in line all of your friends  
  
When you come home what you gonna do  
Oh brother oh brother  
Dont you try to deny what you know to be true  
The same mess of misery  
That you done been through  
Standing in line and its waiting for you  
One kiss leads to another brother  
When you come back home  
  
And that moon will be shining in  
The trees all night long  
Something bound to happen for sure  
Soon youll be stopping by  
Talking to a friend again  
Swear you aint never tasted nothing so pure  
  
When you come home what you gonna do  
Oh brother oh brother  
Dont you try to deny what you know to be true  
The same mess of misery  
That you done been through  
Standing in line and its waiting for you  
One kiss leads to another brother  
When you come back home  
  
When you come home  
Your friends are dropping by  
When you come home  
The moon is gonna shine  
When you come home  
I tell you no lie  
When you come home  
Theyre gonna offer you a line  
Standing in line all of your friends  
Standing in line party never ends now  
Standing in line the river flows  
The river bends  
Standing in line all your so called friends  
Standing in line when you come home  
Standing in line oh brother oh brother now  
Standing in line when you come home  
Standing in line what youre gonna do now
