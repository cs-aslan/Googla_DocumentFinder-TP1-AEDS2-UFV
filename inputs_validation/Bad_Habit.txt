Hey man you know Im really okay  
The gun in my hand will tell you the same  
But when Im in my car  
Dont give me no crap  
  
Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap  
When I go driving I stay in my lane  
But getting cut off makes me insane  
I open the glove box  
  
Reach inside  
Im gonna wreck this fuckers ride  
I guess I got a bad habit  
And it aint goin away Yeah  
  
Well they say the roads a dangerous place  
If you flip me off Im the danger youll face  
You drive on my ass  
Youre foots on the gas  
  
And your next breath is your last  
Drivers are rude  
Such attitudes  
But when I show my piece  
  
Complaints cease  
Somethings odd  
I feel like Im God  
You stupid dumb shit god damn mother fucker  
  
I open the glove box  
Reach inside  
Im gonna wreck this fuckers ride
