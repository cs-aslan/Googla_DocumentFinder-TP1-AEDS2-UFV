I can tell him his toy gun wont kill Indians  
And the towel around his neck dont make him strong  
I can tell him theres no Easter bunny  
But I dont know how to tell him that youre gone  
He still looks for you every morning hes cried every night weve been alone  
I can tell him theres no real Santa but I dont know how to tell him that
youre gone  
  
I can tell him his broomsticks not a pony  
And wearin daddys boots dont make him grown  
I can tell him theres no to ferry  
But I dont know how to tell him that youre gone  
Cause he still looks for you  
I dont know how to tell him that youre gone
