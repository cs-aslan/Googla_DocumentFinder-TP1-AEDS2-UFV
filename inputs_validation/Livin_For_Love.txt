Who do you love when your heart has had enough  
And its just another lie and all you can do is cry  
Where can you go when youre left with just too much  
And its more than you can take gotta find another way  
  
Cause weve all been there before and our hearts keep wanting more  
But no matter how Im beat down broke down tore down wore down  
Fed up messed up I still get up Im gonna keep on  
livin for love no one can stop me from livin for love hey hey hey  
livin for love who do you trust when youve given all youve got  
  
And theres nothing left inside but another damn goodbye  
Hey how do you know if its just another night  
And youre heart wont be betrayed then you face another day  
cause weve all been there before and our hearts keep wanting more
