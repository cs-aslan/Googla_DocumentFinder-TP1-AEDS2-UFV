Were taught unconditional love  
That blood is thicker than water  
That a parents world would revolve  
Always around their son or their daughter  
You pretend I was your own  
And even believed that you loved me  
But were always threatened by some  
Invisible blood line that only you could see  
  
You took advantage of an outreached hand  
And twisted it to meet your every need  
Gimme time to recharge my batteries  
Ill see her when shes older  
And Ill bounce her on my knee  
  
Well listen to me you ungrateful fool  
Here comes a dose of reality  
Youll go to your grave a sad and lonely man  
The door is now closed on your  
Pathetic little plan  
  
On and on and on an don it goes  
Its so easy to run away with  
Nothing in tow  
  
How can you ever sleep a wink at night  
Pretending that everything is alright  
And have the nerve to blame this mess on me  
Never in my life have I seen someone  
So Ignorant to the damage he has done  
Youre the rotted root in the family tree  
  
I tried your 4 bill therapy  
I tried to make amends  
But nothing could lure you out of your  
Selfish shell again  
Expecting everyone  
To bow and kiss your feet  
Dont you see respect is not a  
One way street  
Blaming everyone  
For all that youve done wrong  
Ill get my peace of mind when you  
Hear this song  
  
On and on and on and on it goes  
And with every passing day  
True colors show  
  
How can you ever sleep a wink at night  
Pretending that everything is alright  
And have the balls to blame this mess on me  
Never in my life have I seen someone  
Oblivious to the damage he has done  
Youre the rotted root in the family tree  
  
Watch where you walk  
Dont you dare cross the crooked step  
Watch the way you talk  
  
Dont cross the crooked step  
  
On and on and on and on it goes  
Chauvinistic heartless selfish  
Cold  
  
How can you ever sleep a wink at night  
Pretending that everything is alright  
And have the balls to blame this shit on me  
  
Never in my life have I seen someone  
So fucking blind to the damage he has done  
Youre the rotted root in the family tree
