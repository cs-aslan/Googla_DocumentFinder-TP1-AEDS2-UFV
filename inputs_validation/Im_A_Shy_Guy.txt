Im just a shy guy  
My Im a fraidtotry guy  
No lie  
Theres a gal that I idolize  
But I just cant seem to hypnotize  
And when she pets me  
You betcha it gets me  
And everytime I hold her hand  
Im just too shy to say the things I plan  
Everytime shes close to me  
My heart is filled with ecstasy  
And like a dope I let the chance slip by  
There I should have told her then  
But all I did was sit and grin  
And I ended up so mad that I could cry  
Cause Im a shy guy  
Wish I was a sly guy  
Then I could say Baby baby I love you  
Just like those guys in moving pictures all do  
Im just a shy guy  
Wish I was a sly guy  
Then I could say Baby baby I love you  
Just like those guys in moving pictures all do
