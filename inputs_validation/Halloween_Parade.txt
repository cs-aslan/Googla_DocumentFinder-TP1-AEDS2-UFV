Theres a down town fairy singing out Proud Mary  
as she cruises Christopher Street  
And some Southern Queen is acting loud and mean  
where the docks and the Badlands meet  
  
This Halloween is something to be sure  
Especially to be here without you  
  
Theres a Greta Garbo and an Alfred Hitchcock  
and some black Jamaican stud  
Theres five Cinderellas and some leather drags  
I almost fell into my mug  
  
Theres a Crawford Davis and a tacky Cary Grant  
And some Homeboys lookin for trouble down here from the Bronx  
  
But there aint no Hairy and no Virgin Mary  
you wont hear those voices again  
And Johnny Rio and Rotten Rita  
youll never see those faces again  
  
This Halloween is something to be sure  
Especially to be here without you  
  
Theres the Born Again Losers and the Lavender Boozers  
and some crack team from Washington Heights  
The boys from Avenue B and the girls from Avenue D  
a Tinkerbell in tights  
  
This celebration somehow get me down  
Especially when I see youre not around  
  
Theres no Peter Pedantic saying things romantic  
in Latin Greek or Spic  
Theres no Three bananas or Brandy Alexander  
dishing all their tricks  
  
Its a different feeling that I have today  
Especially when I know youve gone away  
  
Theres a girl from Soho with a teeshirt saying I Blow  
shes with the jive five 2 plus 3  
And the girls for pay dates are giving cut rates  
or else doing it for free  
  
The past keeps knock knock knocking on my door  
And I dont want to hear it anymore  
  
No consolations please for feelin funky  
I got to get my head above my knees  
But it makes me mad and mad makes me sad  
and then I start to freeze  
  
In the back of my mind I was afraid it might be true  
In the back of my mind I was afraid that they meant you
