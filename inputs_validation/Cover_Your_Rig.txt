If you been out messin and actin a fool  
You best be confessin hey dont be cruel  
Just callin attention you probably know  
Dont hold on to nuthin its time to let go  
Lay baby I want cha Im hurtin so big  
Take out some insurance and cover your rig  
We talkin resurrection to shred your head  
That certain possession you keep in yo shed  
Dont want to confuse you muddy up yo mind  
Let nothing abuse you or come from behind  
Say baby I want cha Im hurtin so big  
Take out some insurance and cover your rig  
If theres ever a question take care of yourself  
Use your protection be respecting yoself  
Make no obligations you can throw em to the wind  
Blind infatuations the means to an end  
Say baby I want ya Im hurtin so big  
Take out some insurance and cover your rig
