Every road that I walk  
Every single flight I ever take  
Though Im thousands of miles away  
In my mind every journey leads me closer to you  
Ive been all around this world  
Ive been in far too many states  
But Im under your spell  
Ive made my mistakes oh you can probably tell  
  
Youre every dream that I dream  
Youre every beautiful thing Ive ever seen  
Im always singing your praises  
Counting the days away  
I would be your slave  
Id even be your fool  
Im so in love with you  
Im in love with you baby  
Im gonna break every rule  
  
I hope you can forgive  
Every white lie Im forced to tell  
They say that everythings fair in love and in war  
And Im not above cheating for you  
One night Ill catch you off your guard  
And youll finally fall so hard  
Strategically speaking Im already beaten  
Ill surrender to you  
  
Youre every dream that I dream  
Youre every beautiful thing Ive ever seen  
Im always singing your praises  
Counting the days away  
I would be your slave  
Id even be your fool  
Im so in love with you  
Im in love with you baby  
Im gonna break every rule  
  
Every road that I walk on  
Every flight that I ever take  
Every dream that I dream of  
Every journey brings me closer
