I dont know why Im frightened  
I know my way around here  
The cardboard trees the painted seas the sound here  
Yes a world to rediscover  
But I m not in any hurry  
And I need a moment  
  
The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways  
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always  
Feel the early morning madness  
Feel the magic in the making  
Why everythings as if we never said goodbye  
  
Ive spent so many mornings just trying to resist you  
Im trembling now you cant know how Ive missed you  
Missed the fairy tale adventure  
In this ever spinning playground  
We were young together  
  
Im coming out of makeup  
The lights already burning  
Not long until the cameras will start turning  
And the early morning madness  
And the magic in the making  
Yes everythings as if we never said goodbye  
  
I dont want to be alone  
Thats all in the past  
This worlds waited long enough  
Ive come home at last  
  
And this time will be bigger  
And brighter than we knew it  
So watch me fly we all know I can do it  
Could I stop my hand from shaking  
Has there ever been a moment  
With so much to live for  
  
The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways  
So much to say not just today but always  
Well have early morning madness  
Well have magic in the making  
Yes everythings as if we never said goodbye  
Yes everythings as if we never said goodbye  
We taught the world new ways to dream
