Ive gone mental  
Ive gone mental  
  
Out of the hospital  
Out against my will  
Life is so beautiful  
Ive gone mental  
Mental mental  
  
Ive killed my family  
They thought I was an oddity  
Life is so beautiful I am a vegetable  
Mental mental  
  
Ive gone mental  
Ive gone mental  
Staring at my goldfish bowl  
Popping phenobarbital  
Life is so beautiful  
Ive gone mental  
Mental mental  
  
Sitting on my window sill  
Life is so beautiful  
Ive become irrational  
Ive gone mental  
Mental mental  
Ive gone mental
