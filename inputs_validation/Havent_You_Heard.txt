Havent you heard Daddys gone crazy  
Havent you heard Mama is gone  
  
Here I stand with my finger on his doorbell  
My mind goes back to what I did last night  
You see I finally talked his wife into leaving him  
And Im just trying to convince my conscience that its alright  
  
Well I can see my old friend sittin there just starin  
And his little boy is cryin words that are welded in my mind  
  
Havent you heard Daddys gone crazy  
Havent you heard Mama is gone  
And either way I am the loser  
And Ive been crying all night long  
Mister havent you heard
