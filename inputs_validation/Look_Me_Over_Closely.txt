Look me over closely  
Tell me what you see  
The lady likes to look her best  
Before she pours the tea  
You said Im   
That makes the evening sun go down  
Oh look me over closely  
Tell me what you find  
But dont be over anxious  
Im not the marryin kind  
Im a poor in a storm  
Youll harbor where its warm  
In my arms you will hide  
From the great big world outside  
Oh but when you come and see me  
Dont try to change my ways  
Youll have a part within my heart  
And there youll always stay  
Theres room for all  
Not for all  
But dont blame me  
If you fall  
So look me over closely  
And then make up your mind  
But darling please remember this  
Im holding you before we kiss  
So look me over closely  
Because I may be the marryin kind  
Oh well I may be the marryin kind  
Oh well I may be the marryin kind  
Oh
