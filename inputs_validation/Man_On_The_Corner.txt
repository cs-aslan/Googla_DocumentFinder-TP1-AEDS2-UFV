See the lonely man there on the corner  
What hes waiting for I dont know  
But he waits every day now  
Hes just waiting for something to show  
  
And nobody knows him and nobody cares  
Cause theres no hidin place  
Theres no hidin place  
For you  
  
Lookin everywhere at no one  
He sees everything and nothing at all oh  
When he shouts nobody listens  
Where he leads no one will go oh  
  
Hes a lonely man there on the corner  
What hes waiting for I dont know  
But he waits every day now  
Hes just waiting for something to show  
  
And nobody knows him and nobody cares  
Cause theres no hidin place  
Theres no hidin place  
For you and me  
  
Are we just like all the rest  
Were lookin too hard for somethin hes got  
Or movin too fast to rest  
But like a monkey on your back you need it  
But do you love it enough to leave it all  
  
Just like the lonely man there on the corner  
What hes waiting for I dont know  
But he waits every day now  
Hes just waiting for that somethin to show
