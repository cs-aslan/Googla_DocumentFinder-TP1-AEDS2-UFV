Well I know a cool cat from way downtown  
Hes been boppin all around  
In this ole world hes livin fast  
Someday Im afraid hes gonna run outta gas  
So if youre travelin that way too  
I tell you friend what you better do  
  
Ya gotta stop look and listen  
Hey ya dont know what youre missin  
Ya gotta stop look and listen  
Cause ya might be missin kissin  
If youre travlin slow youll go a long long way  
  
Now Farmer Jones he came to town  
And saw that boppin all around  
He learned to do it theres no doubt  
Im afraid someday hell burn his motor out  
So if youre travelin that way too  
I tell you friend what you better do  
  
First came the boogie then the bunny hop  
Now the rhumba samba then the bop  
Well I dont know whats acomin next  
But this ole worlds in a terrible fix  
So if youre travelin that way too  
I tell you friend what you better do  
  
Ya gotta stop look and listen  
Ya gotta stop look and listen  
Ya gotta stop look and listen  
Ya gotta stop
