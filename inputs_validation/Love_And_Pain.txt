I see the clouds and I feel the rain  
Its all coming down to you again  
And I take the ashes  
Though memories stays the same  
Its all coming down to love and pain  
  
Headin for the coast  
Trying to make the most of this misery  
Cause theres a pain in my heart  
And its tearing me apart  
Well I guess it all comes down to loving you  
Do you see the clouds can you feel the rain  
Its all coming down to love and pain  
  
On the road again thinking about you baby  
Tomorrow I will play L A  
But theres a pain in my heart  
And its tearing me apart  
Well I guess thats just the ay my story goes  
  
Well theres a hunger in my veins  
And its driving me insane  
But I guess it all comes down to love and pain  
  
Well theres a hunger in my veins  
And its driving me insane  
So wont you help me so wont you help me  
Ah wontcha help me help me help me help me  
  
But theres a hunger in my heart  
And its tearing me apart  
Well I guess thats just the way my story goes  
And theres a hunger in my veins  
And its driving me insane  
Well I guess it all comes down to loving you  
Oh I guess its all coming down to love and pain
