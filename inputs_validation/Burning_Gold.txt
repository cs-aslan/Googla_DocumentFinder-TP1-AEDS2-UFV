Looking for an exit in this world of fear  
I can see the path that leads away  
Mama never left and daddy needs me here  
I wish the wind would carry a change  
Looking through the window to a world of dreams  
I can see my future slip away  
Honey you wont get there if you dont believe  
I wish the wind would carry a change  
  
Ive had enough  
Im standing up  
I need I need a change  
Ive had enough  
Of chasing luck  
I need I need a change  
  
Im setting fire to the life that I know I know  
Lets start a fire everywhere that we go we go  
We starting fires  
We starting fires till our lives are burning gold  
Till our lives are burning gold  
  
Looking for my ticket to a higher place  
I can see my chance begin to fade  
One step forward and two back again  
I wish the wind would carry a change  
  
Ive had enough  
Im standing up  
I need I need a change  
Ive had enough  
Of chasing luck  
I need I need a change  
  
Im setting fire to the life that I know I know  
Lets start a fire everywhere that we go we go  
We starting fires  
We starting fires till our lives are burning gold  
Till our lives are burning gold  
  
Looking back I see I had the flame in me  
Im the wind thats carrying a change  
  
Ive had enough  
Of chasing luck  
I need I need a change  
  
Im setting fire to the life that I know I know  
Lets start a fire everywhere that we go we go  
We starting fires  
We starting fires till our lives are burning gold  
  
Im setting fire to the life that I know I know  
Lets start a fire everywhere that we go we go  
We starting fires  
We starting fires till our lives are burning gold  
Till our lives are burning gold
