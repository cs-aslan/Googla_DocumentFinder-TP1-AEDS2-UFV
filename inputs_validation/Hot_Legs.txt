Whos that knocking on my door  
Its gotta be a quarter to four  
Is it you again coming round for more  
Well you can love me tonight if you want  
  
But in the morning make sure youre gone  
Im talkin to you  
  
Hot legs wearing me out  
Hot legs you can scream and shout  
Hot legs are you still in school  
I love you honey  
  
Gotta most persuasive tongue  
You promise all kinds of fun  
But what you dont understand  
Im a working man  
  
Gonna need a shot of vitamin E  
By the time youre finished with me  
Im talking to you  
  
Hot legs youre an alley cat  
Hot legs you scratch my back  
Hot legs bring your mother too  
I love you honey  
  
Imagine how my daddy felt  
In your jet black suspender belt  
Seventeen years old  
Hes touching sixty four  
  
You got legs right up to your neck  
Youre making me a physical wreck  
Im talking to you  
  
Hot legs in your satin shoes  
Hot legs are you still in school  
Hot legs youre making me a fool  
I love you honey  
  
Hot legs making your mark  
Hot legs keep my pencil sharp  
Hot legs keep your hands to yourself  
I love you honey  
  
Hot legs youre wearing me out  
Hot legs you can scream and shout  
Hot legs youre still in school  
I love you honey
