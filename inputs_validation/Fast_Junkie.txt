Lean in  
Take it right  
Down one  
No kissin concrete  
Im awake Im awake Im awake  
Too alive Its comin  
Let it go  
  
My strip  
My bank  
My rubber rut steel my tank  
I can kill Too alive Let it go  
  
No time for thinking a full out fast junkie  
Puchin the red Hey full out speed monkey  
  
Head shake  
  
With thoughts fixed upon the fix inside the vein  
With thoughts fixed not so easily explained  
  
Let it out  
Let it go  
What you do not what you know  
One more Fix clean  
Im one I am a machine  
I am a machine  
  
No time for thinking a full out fast junkie  
Pushin the red hey Full out speed monkey  
I am  
Head shake  
  
Wide Fucking Open
