I hate hoes  
I hate hoes  
I hate hoes  
Oh  
  
Chorus  
All these hoes is the motherfucking same  
Play you to the left like a motherfucking lame  
Call you out you motherfucking name  
Fuck you all lames  
I got game  
I hate hoes hoes hate me  
I hate hoes hoes hate me  
I hate hoes hoes hate me  
I hate hoes hoes hate me  
  
For real bitch dont take the shit wrong  
Thinking Im nice Ill break you jawbone  
Get the fuck on  
Leave me alone  
Bitch you better go on  
See you all hoes aint optimistic  
Cockblockin bitches  
You unproper bitches  
Whats the problem bitches  
You say your nigga hurt your feelins  
Well hoes done hurt mine  
Not once not twice  
But bitch all the time  
So Im a dog to a broad  
Have em all crying  
I done cried before  
That dont make me a hoe  
That just show me where my feelins aint supposed to go  
See I got the magic stick you dumb bitch  
Other nigga you fuck with be on some punk shit  
And Im gonna show you all I dont need no help  
Just as soon as I loosen my belt  
Bitch  
  
Chorus  
  
I need a moment  
I cant stand bitches and hoes  
cause a bitch is a bitch and a hoe gonna hoe  
But a woman hold her own  
She got her own home  
She drive her own car  
Buying drinks at the bar  
Take a nigga out to eat  
Take a nigga to the mall  
Treat a nigga good  
And wash a nigga draws  
But bitches aint shit  
Always talking shit  
They wanna be the shit  
But is they shit No  
And hoes they fuck off the god damn chain  
Everything and everything but dont take names  
So thats a nasty hoe and I cant do shit wit it  
Please get out my face I dont need a case  
Yeah I love you all respectful women  
Independent women  
I takes em out all the time  
But you all hit the baggage need to keep on tracking  
I aint speaking I aint talking to nothing  
cause  
  
Chorus  
  
Just keep my name out you mouth  
Before you find out how a down south hoe will out  
Youre a hater shes a hater three a hater for  
Everywhere I go I see some hating ass hoes  
Southern Belle Jazzy Belle Never Monogamous  
 be hot because my deeper esophagus  
Still they run up on me smile and phone me  
Laugh cause soon as I turn my back they stab it  
Learn to play fair  
Stop trying to care  
Two hoes to one nigga  
Bitch learn to share  
Baby you dead ass broke  
For hating on the rich chicks  
See how I flow  
Bitch put it on you wish list  
Two seater wit the chill on  
My baby daddy put the grill on  
Fixing to put the heels on  
Chrome spokes with the low pros  
And the trunk funk blows up the cedar on the dashboard  
  
Chorus  
  
This is the mens national anthem for this year  
All you real women  
You all can sing this shit too  
If you a hoe and you hate another hoe  
You can sing this shit too  
If you a bitch and you hate and bitch  
You can sing this shit too  
So everybodys gonna sing this shit  
I hate hoes they hate me too  
Yup  
Yup  
Yup  
Yup  
Yup  
Bitch
