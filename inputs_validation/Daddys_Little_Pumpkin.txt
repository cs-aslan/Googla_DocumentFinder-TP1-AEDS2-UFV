You must be daddys little pumpkin  
I can tell by the way you roll  
You must be daddys little pumpkin  
I can tell by the way you roll  
Why its quarter past eleven  
And youre sleeping on the bedroom floor  
  
I can see the fire burning  
Burning right behind your eyes  
I can see the fire burning  
Burning right behind your eyes  
You must of swallowed a candle  
Or some other kind of surprise  
  
Im going down to Memphis  
I got three hundred dollars in cash  
Im going down to Memphis  
I got three hundred dollars in cash  
All the women in Memphis  
Want to see how long my money will last  
  
Im going downtown  
Im gonna to rattle somebodys cage  
  
Im going downtown  
Im gonna rattle somebodys cage  
Im gonna beat on my guitar  
And strut all around the stage  
  
If you see my baby coming  
Dont tell her that her daddys in jail  
If you see my baby coming  
Dont you tell her that her daddys in jail  
Shed sell her little pumpkin just to raise  
Her sweet daddys bail  
  
You must be daddys little pumpkin  
I can tell by the way you roll  
You must be daddys little pumpkin  
I can tell by the way you roll  
You never do nothing  
To save your doggone soul
