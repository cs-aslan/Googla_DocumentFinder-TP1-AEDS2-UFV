Verse 3  
My cousin said I made it big and its unusual  
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandmas funeral  
Used to roam on Queen now I sing Queen street anthems  
Used to hate attention now I pull up in that wagon  
And I was broken I was broken I was so broke  
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless  
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans  
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix  
Now we get faded when we want girl we got choices  
Lay them on the fuckin table we got choices  
And if they wanna fuck my niggas they got choices  
They told me not to fall in love that shit is pointless  
Yeah that shit is pointless  
They told me not to fall in love that shit is pointless  
Yeah that shit is pointless  
They told me not to fall in love that shit is pointless
