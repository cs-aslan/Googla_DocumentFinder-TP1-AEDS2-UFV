I got your letter today  
And I miss you all so much here  
I cant wait to see you all  
And Im counting the days here  
  
I still believe that theres gold  
At the end of the world  
And Ill come home to Illinois  
On the day after tomorrow  
  
It is so hard and its cold here  
And Im tired of taking orders  
And I miss old Rockford town  
Up by the Wisconsin border  
  
What I miss you wont believe  
Shovelling snow and raking leaves  
And my plane will touch down  
On the day after tomorrow  
  
I close my eyes every night  
And I dream that I can hold you  
  
They fill us full of lies everyone buys  
Bout what it means to be a soldier  
I still dont know how Im supposed to feel  
Bout all the blood thats been spilled  
Will god on this throne  
Get me back home  
On the day after tomorrow  
  
You cant deny the other side  
Dont want to die anymore then we do  
What Im trying to say is dont they pray  
To the same god that we do  
  
And tell me how does god choose  
Whose prayers does he refuse  
Who turns the wheel  
Who throws the dice  
On the day after tomorrow  
  
Im not fighting for justice  
I am not fighting for freedom  
I am fighting for my life  
And another day in the world here  
  
I just do what Ive been told  
Were just the gravel on the road  
And only the lucky ones come home  
On the day after tomorrow  
  
And the summer it too will fade  
And with it brings the winters frost dear  
And I know we too are made  
Of all the things that we have lost here  
  
Ill be 21 today  
I been saving all my pay  
And my plane will touch down  
On the day after tomorrow  
And my plane it will touch down  
On the day after tomorrow
