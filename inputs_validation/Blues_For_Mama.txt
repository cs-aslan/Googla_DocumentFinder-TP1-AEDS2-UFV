Hey Lordy mama  
I heard you wasnt feeling good  
Theyre spreadin dirty rumors  
All around the neighborhood  
They say youre mean and evil  
And dont know what to do  
Thats the reason that hes gone  
And left you black and blue  
Hey yeah  
Tell me what you gonna do now  
  
They say hes left you all alone  
To weather this old storm  
Hes got another woman now  
Hangin on his arm yeah yeah yeah  
That old fools tellin everybody  
Hes sick and tired of you  
Hey Lordy Lordy mama  
What you gonna do  
Hey yeah  
Tell me what you gonna do  
  
They say you love to fuss and fight  
And bring a good man down  
And dont know how to treat him  
They say you aint behind him  
And just dont understand  
And think that youre a woman  
But actin like a man  
Hey Lordy mama  
What you gonna do now  
  
Get your nerves together baby  
And set the record straight  
Set it straight  
Let the whole round world know  
It wasnt you  
That cause his bitter fate  
All these years you loved him  
And he knows its true  
Cause what youre wantin  
For your man  
Is what hes wantin too  
Hey yeah  
Tell me what you gonna do now  
  
When you love a man enough  
Youre bound to disagree  
Cause aint nobody perfect  
Cause aint nobody free  
Hey Lordy mama  
Tell me what you gonna do  
What you gonna do
