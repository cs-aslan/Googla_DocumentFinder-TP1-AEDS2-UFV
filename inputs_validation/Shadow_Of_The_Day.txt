I close both locks below the window  
I close both blinds and turn away  
Sometimes solutions arent so simple  
Sometimes goodbyes the only way oh  
  
Chorus  
And the sun will set for you  
The sun will set for you  
And the shadow of the day  
Will embrace the world in gray  
And the sun will set for you  
  
In cards and flowers on your window  
Your friends all plead for you to stay  
Sometimes beginnings arent so simple  
Sometimes goodbyes the only way oh  
  
Chorus  
  
And the shadow of the day  
Will embrace the world in gray  
And the sun will set for you  
  
And the shadow of the day  
Will embrace the world in gray  
And the sun will set for you
