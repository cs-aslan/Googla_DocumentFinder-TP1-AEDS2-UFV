Shout  
Shout  
Look in these eyes  
These eyes dont lie  
And they say that if you dont blink  
Then you dont die  
  
Now feel this heart  
It beats so tough  
And if you ever gonna doubt my faith  
Then Ill call your bluff  
Cause you aint that tough  
  
The lies in your eyes cant defeat me  
I aint ever goin down  
I was down on my knees completely  
And you will never take my crown  
But I rise from my feet you cant beat me  
Oh and thats why I gotta stay  
And thats why I gotta say  
  
Im undefeated  
And standing tall tall  
I dont want to be the loser  
When the winner takes it all  
Im undefeated  
I got this scar scar  
I will wash this blood away  
Live to fight another day  
Undefeated  
Shout  
Im undefeated  
Shout  
  
I feel your pain  
I hear your words  
But there aint nothing you can say to me  
I aint already heard  
  
These cuts run deep  
Close to the bone  
But I gotta keep getting up  
Cause I been down so long  
So lets get it on  
  
The lies in your eyes cant defeat me  
I aint ever goin down  
I was down on my knees completely  
And you will never take my crown  
But I rise from my feet you cant beat me  
Oh and thats why I gotta stay  
And thats why I gotta say  
  
Im undefeated  
And standing tall tall  
I dont want to be the loser  
When the winner takes it all  
Im undefeated  
I got this scar scar  
I will wash this blood away  
Live to die another day  
  
I walk through the fire  
With the flames on my skin  
I wanna be the last man standing  
Ill never surrender Ill never give in  
I just got to win  
  
The lies in your eyes cant defeat me  
I aint ever goin down  
I was down on my knees completely  
And you will never take my crown  
But I rise from my feet you cant beat me  
Oh and thats why I gotta stay  
And thats why I gotta say  
  
Im undefeated  
And standing tall tall  
I dont want to be the loser  
When the winner takes it all  
Im undefeated  
I got this scar scar  
I will wash this blood away  
Live to fight another day  
Im undefeated  
  
Its stand or fall fall  
You can laugh and walk around me with my back against the wall  
Im undefeated  
I got the prize prize  
If you got the will to win  
You got to take it on the chin  
Stay undefeated  
Shout
