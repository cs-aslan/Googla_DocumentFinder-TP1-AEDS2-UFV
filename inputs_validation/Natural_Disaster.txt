Had lips like candy  
Hair flowing like water  
Skin like velvet made  
The whole damn world slow down  
She was a preachers daughter  
Never did what daddy taught her  
And the rebel in her soul  
Brought her to me  
  
The river was cold  
And the river was wide  
She flowed from the mountain  
Straight across the great divide  
And her heart ran cold  
But her love runs deep  
Shes fire on the mountain  
Wrecking everyone she meets  
  
Shes like rain when she rolls in  
But that sunshine in her thunder  
Makes the loneliest heart wonder  
If the ride is worth the pain  
Might not be stone clouds inside  
Oh but dont you worry friend  
Shes coming around the bend  
Shes holding lightning in both hands  
  
Lord please know  
Its that time for me to go  
The river has my heart  
Shes the keeper of my soul  
On one side of the water  
Sweet everlasting grace  
The other side could end your life  
Or steal your breath away  
  
Shes like rain when she rolls in  
But that sunshine in her thunder  
Makes the loneliest heart wonder  
If the ride is worth the pain  
Might not be stone clouds inside  
Oh but dont you worry friend  
Shes coming around the bend  
Shes holding lightning in both hands  
  
Shes a natural disaster  
Shell tear the land in two  
Shes running to be running  
Cause its all she knows to do  
Shes a tumbleweed rolling  
A river running wild  
A hurricane blowing  
Shes the calm after the storm  
Under an Appalachian sunset sky  
  
Shes like rain when she rolls in  
But that sunshine in her thunder  
Makes the loneliest heart wonder  
If the ride is worth the pain  
Might not be stone clouds inside  
Oh but dont you worry friend  
Shes coming around the bend  
Shes holding lightning in both hands  
  
Shes like rain  
Shes rolls in  
But theres sunshine in her thunder  
Shes coming around the bend  
Shes holding lightning in both hands
