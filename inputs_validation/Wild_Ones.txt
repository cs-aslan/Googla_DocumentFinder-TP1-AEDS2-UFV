Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh  
If I took you home itd be a home run  
Show me how you do  
  
I want to shut down the club with you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones wild ones wild ones ooh  
  
I like crazy foolish stupid  
Party going wild fist pumping  
Music I might lose it  
Blast to the roof that how we doz it doz it doz it  
I dont care the night she dont care we like  
Almost dared the right five  
Ready to get live aint no surprise  
Take me so high jump and dont stop  
Surfing the crowd ooh said I gotta be the man  
When they heading my van mic check one two  
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it and yall get lose lose  
Out the bottle we all get bent and again tomorrow  
Gotta break loose cause thats the motto  
Club shuts down a hundred super models  
  
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh  
If I took you home itd be a home run  
Show me how you do  
  
I wanna shut down the club with you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones wild ones wild ones ooh  
  
Party rocker fashow stopper more shampoo  
Number one club popper  
Got a hangover like too much vodka  
Cant see me with ten binoculars so cool  
No doubt by the end of the night  
Got the clothes coming off til I make that move  
Somehow someway gotta raise the roof roof  
All black shades when the sun come through  
Oh its on like everything goes round up baby til the freaky show  
What happens to that body its a private show  
Stays right here private show  
I like em untamed dont tell me hide pain  
Tolerance bottoms up with the champagne  
My life coming harder when we hit fame  
Do you busy with the bail we get insane  
  
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh  
If I took you home itd be a home run  
Show me how you do  
  
I want to shut down the club with you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones wild ones wild ones ooh  
  
I am a wild one break me in  
Saddle me up and lets begin  
I am a wild one tame me now  
Running with wolves and Im on the prowl  
  
Show you another side of me  
A side you would never thought you would see  
Tear up that body dominate you til you had nough  
I hear you like the wild stuff  
  
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh  
If I took you home itd be a home run  
Show me how youll do  
I want to shut down the club with you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones wild ones wild ones ooh  
  
I am a wild one break me in  
Saddle me up and lets begin  
I am a wild one tame me now  
Running with wolves and Im on the prowl
