You and I travel to the beat of a different drum  
Oh cant you tell by the way I run  
Every time you make eyes at me  
  
You cry and moan and say it will work out  
But honey child Ive got my doubts  
You cant see the forest for the trees  
  
Oh dont get me wrong  
Its not that I knock it  
Its just that I am not in the market  
For a boy who wants to love only me  
  
Yes and I aint saying you aint pretty  
All Im saying is Im not ready  
For any person place or thing  
To try and pull the reins in on me  
  
So goodbye Ill be leaving  
I see no sense in this crying and grieving  
Well both live a lot longer  
If you live without me  
  
Oh dont get me wrong  
Its not that I knock it  
Its just that I am not in the market  
For a boy who wants to love only me  
  
Yes and I aint saying you aint pretty  
All Im saying is Im not ready  
For any person place or thing  
To try and pull the reins in on me  
  
So goodbye Ill be leaving  
I see no sense in this crying and grieving  
Well both live a lot longer  
If you live without me
