Why do hearts feel the way they do  
Why does men wanna say that I love you  
Till the end of time  
Till I lose my mind  
Till its over and left so far behind  
  
I just cant keep it all inside  
So unbelievable how much Ive tried  
Yet I call for you  
I long for you  
And I say the words I wish youd want to here  
Though youre never here  
  
Chorus  
Our heats and though they beat as one  
But in time the time for us will never come  
So I I just go on  
And just remember those eyes  
That look right through my heat  
The smile that shows whats in you  
That makes me wanna cry  
Coz I know  
Ill never have you even for a while  
  
Now all is said and done it seems  
I keep remembering what I would call a dream  
Where you came true  
For a minute or two  
That was all the time it took  
To make me know you had to go  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Cause I know  
Ill never have you  
And I know  
Ill never have you  
Even for a while
