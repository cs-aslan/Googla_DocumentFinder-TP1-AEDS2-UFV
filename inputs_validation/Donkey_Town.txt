feat Mark Knopfler  
  
Ive been around in Donkey Town  
Too long baby too long  
Checking out of Donkey Town  
So long so long so long  
  
Her pretty eyes are pretty still  
But Jims got a kind of a squint Yeah  
I dug up my last check from out of the mine  
Now I feel like Ive done my stint  
Jim got an army pension  
When he walked from the military court  
No body ever mentioned  
The medical report  
  
She does little things for me  
She likes to get the both of us high Yeah  
She says Im a tenderhearted man  
Prince charming yeah sure Im the guy  
He likes the wreckers dogs on chains  
And the smoke from the company fires  
Diesel oil in the trucks and cranes  
And the smell of burning tires  
  
But Ive been around in Donkey Town  
Too long baby too long  
Checking out of Donkey Town  
So long so long so long  
  
Theres a purple heart in a silver tin  
And a grey 45 in a drawer  
Most of the time you can drink with him  
But some other time hes just sore  
On days when she says she cant think straight  
Or she feels like shes getting the jumps  
Shell go shoot off her 38  
At cans on a Donkey Town dump  
  
It was Friday late and she crossed those legs  
She told me flat out she would Yeah  
If I could pull up my trailer pegs  
We could get away together for good  
I sure wish her the best of luck  
Shes going to need it thinking of Jim  
I dont like to leave her stuck  
But shes near as bad as him  
  
But Ive been around in Donkey Town  
Too long baby too long  
Checking out of Donkey Town  
So long so long so long  
Checking out of Donkey Town  
So long so long so long
