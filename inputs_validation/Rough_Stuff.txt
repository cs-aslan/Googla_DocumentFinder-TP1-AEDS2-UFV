Rough stuff  
Your cheatin lips taste sweet when they are pressed to mine  
Rough stuff  
I wish that I could break a leg but youre too fine  
You said you love me but its plain to see youre not mine  
Rough stuff  
You got me in your spell Im just the same to you  
Rough stuff  
Why cant you settle down and give a love thats true  
I have lost my strut and I cry inside Im so blue  
Woowoowoo I tried to tame you but it cant be done  
Woowoowoowoo I oughta hate you but I love you  
Youre the only one oh rough stuff  
You know I couldnt live if we should ever part  
Rough stuff  
Im such a fool and you been foolin from the start  
Still I hope and pray you will give your heart someday
