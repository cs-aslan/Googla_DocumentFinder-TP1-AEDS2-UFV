What makes you think shell go with you  
What makes you think youre better than me  
You think you can read her mind  
Maybe youre just looking for a good time  
Maybe you can give her more  
Tell me what youre doing this for  
Stay away from her  
Cause its making me angry  
  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
She belongs to me  
  
You come around looking for kicks  
But I know all about your dirty tricks now  
You think you took away my dream  
Aint gonna be easy cause I get real mean  
Get out of here get out of my life  
Youre gonna be sorry if we have to fight  
Stay away from her  
Cause its making me angry  
  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
She belongs to me  
  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
Dont tell me how to love my baby  
She belongs to me  
She belongs to me  
She belongs to me
