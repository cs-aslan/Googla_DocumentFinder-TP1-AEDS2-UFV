Cant move my arms  
Cant move my legs  
Cant say no  
I cant say yes  
Cant help myself  
I need your help  
  
We go  
Oh ooh what do we do  
Now we just cant move  
Were calling out for Middle Street  
  
Oh ooh what do we do  
Now we just cant move  
We hang on to every line  
And walk straight down the middle of it  
  
He thought he was gonna die  
But he didnt  
She thought she just couldnt cope  
But she did  
We thought it would be so hard  
But it wasnt  
It wasnt easy though  
  
Cant say yes  
I cant say no  
Cant begin  
Cant let go  
Help me now  
  
We go  
Ooh ooh what do we do  
Now we just cant move  
Were calling out for Middle Street  
  
Ooh ooh what do we do  
Now we just cant move  
We hang on to every line  
And walk straight down the middle of it  
  
He thought he was gonna die  
But he didnt  
She thought she could never cope  
But she did  
We thought it was all over  
But it wasnt  
It hadnt started yet  
  
And walk straight down the middle of it  
And walk straight down the middle of it  
Calling out for Middle Street  
Calling out for Middle Street  
Walking straight down the middle of it
