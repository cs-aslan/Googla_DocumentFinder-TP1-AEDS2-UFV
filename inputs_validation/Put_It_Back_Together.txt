I was moving forward  
From the point Ive come from  
I was rolling lowly  
This is our song now  
  
I was moving forward  
From the point Ive come from  
I was rolling lowly  
This is our song now  
  
Gotta see it  
Nothing means I gotta gotta  
Feel it  
Everything is out I gotta  
Hold out  
Everything is out I gotta  
Day out  
Just invite them  
Gotta  
Bore them  
Till I take us out  
I gotta feel like  
Every single line  
I gotta  
Clean it out to the side  
When were not down and out  
  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Burning down the city  
Warning out of something  
But I need to find it  
Cause I got no sun down  
  
Dug a whole was so fun  
And a taste thats floating  
What it doesnt meet no  
Place to silent sleep now  
  
I gotta feeling  
Doesnt mean I sad because I  
Love me  
Everything around it isnt  
Better  
If you sing it loud and I  
Jam myself to dawn  
I got  
So much dissing at the side and  
When its  
Just another ride and you  
Sow yourself to the cat  
Bet it  
  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah
