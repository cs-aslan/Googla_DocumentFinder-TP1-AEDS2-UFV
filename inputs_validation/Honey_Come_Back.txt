Honey I know Ive said it too many times before  
I said Id never say it again  
I guess I shouldnt say anything at all since youre supposed to belong to
him  
But I just cant let you go without telling you just how much I love you  
  
So that is why Im gonna say it one more time  
  
Chorus  
Honey come back I just cant stand  
Each lonely days a little bit longer  
Than the last time I held you  
Seems like a hundred years ago  
Back to his arms and never know  
The joy of love that used to taste like  
Honey come back where you belong to only me  
  
Well I guess thats about all I gotta say  
So Im just gonna take my bags and Im gonna walk  
I know those bright lights are callin ya honey  
Big fine cars and fancy clothes  
But if you ever want somebody to just love ya and some day you  
Just may just give me a callyou know where I am  
  
And here is what Ill say  
  
Chorus  
  
Honey come back where you belong to only me  
Honey come back  
  
Where you belong to only me  
Honey come back where you belong to only me
