Oh you make me feel  
Like no one ever will  
Why do you bore me  
Until my heart stands still  
  
Then you confuse me  
That makes me hateful  
When I get hateful  
I say stupid things about you  
  
All those things I know about you  
Oh its the strangest feeling to know  
There are a billion people just like you  
Feeling like you in their own way theyre  
  
Just as mixed up as you  
Poor little mixed up you  
Poor little mixed up you  
And all those things  
  
I said about you  
I take them back  
I eat my words  
I didnt mean them  
  
I mean so little  
Im so fickle  
I forget you  
I forget you  
  
Oh its the strangest feeling to know  
There are a billion people just like you  
Feeling like you  
And in their own way theyre  
  
Just as mixed up as you  
Poor little mixed up you  
Poor little mixed up you  
Oh its the strangest feeling to know  
  
There are a billion people just like you  
They all feel like you  
And in their own way theyre just as
