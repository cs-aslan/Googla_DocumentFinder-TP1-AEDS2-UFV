Im back in my babys arms again Im thankful too  
Im back in my babys arms again that love is true  
Im back in my babys arms again where I should be  
Cause I know where Ive been I was lost in sin  
But Im back in my babys arms again  
  
Well I hurt her so that I had to hide I would stay away not to face my pride  
But she saw me through to the truth inside  
And Im back in my babys arms again with the love that I stole  
Im back in my babys arms again God bless her soul  
Im back in my babys arms again and I know its real  
  
I pray the Lord I remember when cause its better now than its ever been  
He came back to me like a long lost friend and Im back in my babys arms
again  
Im back in my babys arms again Im thankful too  
Im back in my babys arms again
