My time my patience my love  
My blood my sweat my tears  
My burdens my drama my pain  
My car my money my home  
My ups my downs my fears  
And my hours my work my strength  
My fault my this my that  
Nigga please  
  
Chorus  
If you dont stop  
This is a warning  
Someones gonna lay in your bed  
This is a warning  
And someones gonna eat your food  
This is a warning  
And someones gonna wear your clothes  
This is a warning  
And someones gonna fit your shoes  
This is a warning  
And someones gonna get your keys  
This is a warning  
And someones gonna open your doors  
This is a warning  
Someones gonna get your check  
This is a warning  
This is a womans threat  
Baby this is a womans threat  
  
My shakin my sleep my stress  
My days my night my rest  
My dos my donts my dares  
And my church my pastor my prayers  
My all my faith my powers  
And my kitchen my sink my towels  
My joy my sad my hate  
And my sister my cousin my friends  
My lights my gas my bills  
My role my way my will  
My hollerin my fussin my fights  
Nigga please  
  
Chorus  
  
My future my hopes my dreams  
My panties my socks my things  
My flowers my dress my ring  
My man my lover my king  
My live my chance my fault  
And my guts my courage my wounds  
My fence my neighbors my yard  
My chains my lock my guards  
My win my lose my gain  
And my credit my card my name  
Myself my freedom my roof  
Nigga please  
  
Chorus  
  
Listen  
Whoa whoa  
Have you ever heard the story  
About the three little bears  
See they papa was gone  
For a long long long long time  
When he returned  
To his sweet little home  
He had come to find  
That all of his porridge was gone  
  
Chorus
