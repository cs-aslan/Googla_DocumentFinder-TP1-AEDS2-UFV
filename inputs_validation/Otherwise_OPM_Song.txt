We all have raised our voices  
We all have done our crimes  
Weve been excused of every lie  
Theres no such thing as perfect  
So we could make those plans  
Would you have it otherwise  
  
Refrain  
And on the fulcrum we stand on we aim for better view  
Then you trip over fault lines of which you never knew  
Then you start to mail all of the blame  
Find it back on your door next day  
  
Chorus  
Like twists and turns in radio plays and movies  
Mount the script in your autobiography  
Take the heros place and the heros name  
Manufacture spiels for a strangers sake  
Oh you bitch for truth  
And you damn well know youre fake  
  
We all have minced our words  
Even exchanged euphemisms  
Then we say we must go for truth  
We have an ear for envy  
Never a tongue for praise  
Cant we have it otherwise  
  
Repeat refrain  
Repeat chorus four times  
  
Coda  
Damn well know youre fake
