She lays in bed at night and that is when I make my call  
But when she stares at me she cant see nothing at all  
Because you see I cant take no shape or form  
Its been three long years since Ive been gone  
  
I cant get used to purgatory you know it really makes me cry  
Ill never know the reason why I had to go  
Oh oh Im crying  
Oh oh oh deep inside of me  
Oh oh oh cant you see me  
Ah cant you see me  
  
Im looking forward to her spirit coming over to me  
I feel tempted to bring her over to see just what its  
Like to be hanging on the other side  
I feel so lonely its a long time since I died  
  
I try to show her that shes never gonna be alone  
Because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone  
Oh oh Im crying  
Oh oh oh deep inside of me  
Oh oh oh cant you see me  
Ah cant you see me
