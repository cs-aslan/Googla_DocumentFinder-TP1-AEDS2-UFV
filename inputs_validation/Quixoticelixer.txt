Kick back a little bit just to watch and see  
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery  
Whatever your pleasure Im your punk  
Gonna bring the second bait thats not yet sunk  
How I listen below when you told me  
That I was all you had to hold  
I wish you were sober when you told me  
That you were solid gold  
Gravityfree is she look at her  
Hottest on the map shes full of antimatter  
You never look at very mellow impressions  
Smell you with your going to hell expression  
Quixoticelixer might  
But it will probably not fix your bite  
Tell me now tell me how  
Did I your lipstick on my kite  
  
I love this weather  
Its the perfect storm  
Just keep it coming  
In its perfect form  
I love this weather  
Cause it keeps me warm  
Just keep it coming  
In its perfect form  
  
Everyday depression in a beautiful dress  
Lady made a beautiful mess I guess  
Dedicated mind did a medicated state  
Is a highly overrated fate  
Terrabulb is a soul  
When she told me there is such a thing  
Do you know that you glow when you go  
From winter to the spring  
  
I love this weather  
Its a perfect storm  
Just keep it coming  
In its perfect form  
I love this weather  
Cause it keeps me warm  
Just keep it coming  
In its perfect form  
  
The madder the boy the sadder the song  
Thats a wicked fate but the sick gets strong  
Mad boy sad song  
A wicked fate but the sick gets strong  
Nobodys right and everyones wrong  
I refuse to punt on fourth and long  
Mad boy sad song  
Wicked fate but the sick gets  
  
Kick back a little bit just to watch and see  
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery  
Whatever your pleasure Im your punk  
Gonna bring the second bait thats not yet sunk  
How I listen below when you told me  
That I was all you had to hold  
I wish it was so when you told me  
That you were solid gold  
  
I swear to god I could not hurt you  
Ive got to be inside your virtue  
I cant contain my urge to search you  
  
I stand before you theres no curfew  
I long to be inside your virtue  
My heart is swollen when I search you  
  
I swear to god I could not hurt you  
My heart is swollen when I search you  
I swear to god I could not hurt you  
  
I swear to god I could not hurt you  
Ive got to be inside your virtue  
I cant contain my urge to search you
