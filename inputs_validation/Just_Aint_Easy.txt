You ride on down the same old street youve seen a thousand times  
That overflows with neon lights and enormous signs  
My God how you want to leave there Well well  
Your head severely poundin from the night before  
Baby you just keep goin back goin back for more  
Cause midnights callin Well well  
You want so bad to leave this whirlwind storm  
But you cant find no place to grab on  
So round and round you go again and it just aint easy  
You want so bad to leave this whirlwind storm  
But you cant find no place to grab on  
So round and round you go again and it just aint easy  
No it just aint easy  
Lovely ladies all dressed in silk and lace  
While youre there oh it seems like such a lovely place  
But when you leave there  
You got your hat down on your face Well well  
But oh when you leave there got your hat down on your face well well  
Ohh when you leave there you got your hat pulled down on your face well  
repeat and fade
