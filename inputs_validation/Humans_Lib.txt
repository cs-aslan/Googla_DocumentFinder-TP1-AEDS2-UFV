Sometimes Id like to go to bed  
With a hundred women or men  
And lose my mind in lust and drink  
And to hit some people into feeling good oh  
  
Sometimes Id like to dance in the street  
Dont wanna go to work just wanna lay in bed all day  
  
Why dont you then  
Why dont you then  
  
Life just seems oh so meaningless  
And who can blame us for wanting these things  
But you just try being free my friend  
And everyone will hate your guts I only want to free
