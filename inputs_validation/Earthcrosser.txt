Sleep little flea  
  
Little boy me  
  
A freak  
  
Am I clean  
  
background whisper sleep  
  
I feel like men  
  
sleep little flea  
  
I feel like boys  
  
little boy me  
  
I think Im peeling  
  
And the ring in my ears  
  
From playing too loud  
  
I hear the ocean  
  
I hear the crowd  
  
Disconnected  
  
I am unattached  
  
Unmade bed makes me feel like a failure  
  
Bedroom eyes lead to blurry vision  
  
Blurry vision  
  
Oh  
  
Oh  
  
And the ring in my ears  
  
From playing too loud  
  
I hear the ocean  
  
I hear the crowd  
  
Too pale too sick  
  
Too scrawny  
  
But Ill sleep here anyway  
  
And the sheets smell like bodies  
  
Not mine  
  
Not yours  
  
Not yours  
  
Its 2 am  
  
And its quiet again  
  
Wheres my lip gloss  
  
And the ring in my ears  
  
From playing too loud  
  
I hear the ocean  
  
I hear the crowd  
  
And the ring in my ears  
  
From playing too loud  
  
I hear the ocean  
  
I hear the crowd  
  
And the ring in my ears  
  
From playing too loud  
  
I hear the ocean  
  
I hear the crowd
