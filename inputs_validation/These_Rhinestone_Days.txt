Now we live our lives so nonchalant  
We spend our time so bon vivant  
Our Spanish nights so well arranged  
Those tasteful words that we exchanged  
We know its all a passing phase  
  
We light our lamps for atmosphere  
And hang our hopes on chandeliers  
I dont know why we even care  
We try and try and get nowhere  
Well change our minds we changed our ways  
These Rhinestone Days  
  
So go our lives so nonchalant  
We spend our time so bon vivant  
I dont know why we even care  
We try and try and get nowhere  
Well change our minds we changed our ways  
These Rhinestone Days
