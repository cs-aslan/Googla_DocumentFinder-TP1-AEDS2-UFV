I want to be your driver I want to be your driver  
I would love to ride you I would love to ride you around  
Well be ready when you want me to drive you on downtown  
  
Yeah I want to drive your your long and beautiful  
Your roundedbody wheeltoroll limousine  
Ive never had the thrill of riding such a wonderful machine  
  
Well roll round the mountain drive down in the valley  
I would drive it all over I would ride you home with ease  
You will enjoy every journey it will be my aim to please  
  
So let me be your driver let me be your driver  
I would love to ride you I would love to ride you downtown  
Drive you so slow and easy you wont want to put me down
