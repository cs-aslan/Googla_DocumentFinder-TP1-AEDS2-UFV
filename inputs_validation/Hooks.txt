Talk about lovers  
Theyre bothyoung and very pretty  
Theyre in love but he betrays her  
He says sorry and so she wants  
To believe him that its why  
Hes got her on his hooks  
Bridge  
What you do to me I can do to you  
Babe set me free then Ill let you be  
Come on come on nowdont you fool around  
Cause youre hurting me  
Wont you let me be  
Chorus  
You got me on your hooks  
Youre a bastard  
You got me on your hooks  
Youre a bastard  
You know its true  
You got me on your hooks  
Then one day he decides to marry her  
She doesnt want to  
Because she doesnt believe him  
I saw you kissing that girl last week  
But I still think you love me  
That why you got me  
Bridge  
Chorus  
I know its crazy  
But I know it wont be long  
I know its crazy  
But I know I will survive lalala lalala  
Bridge  
You got me on youre hooks
