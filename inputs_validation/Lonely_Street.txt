Wheres this place called Lonely Streeeeeeeet  
Im looking for that lonely street  
Ive got a sad sad tale to tell  
I need a place to go and weep  
  
Wheres this place called Lonely Streeeeeeeet  
A place where theres just loneliness  
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness  
Where broken dreams and memries meet  
  
Wheres this place called Lonely Streeeeeeeet  
Perhaps upon that lonely street  
Theres someone such as I  
Who came to bury broken dreams  
  
And watch an old love diie  
If I could find that lonely street  
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness  
Where broken dreams and memries meet
