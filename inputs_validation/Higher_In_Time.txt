The mountain is steep  
the ditches are deep  
The task in hand  
is making us weep  
But heres a promise  
I intend to keep  
  
That I mean to keep  
Seed it in your mind  
and say it each night  
Before you sleep  
we will climb higher in time  
och  
  
Youve got a head full of trouble  
and a ship to build  
You think you wont make it  
but you know you will  
You feel you need your  
cup refilled  
Fill it out of mine  
well drop the defenses  
Pool our skill  
  
Your heart youre hiding  
its making you ill  
You feel like you want to have your  
sporran refilled  
Well fill it out of mine  
let the soulful water  
Overspill  
and we will climb higher in time  
  
Ive been to the bottom  
Ive been on the train  
Ive slept in the gutter  
with my head in a drain  
Ive been brutally proud  
Ive been mortally shamed  
But this is not a crime  
Im just learning my friends  
That its all in the game  
and we will climb higher in time  
Och  
  
Climb higher in time  
climb higher in time
