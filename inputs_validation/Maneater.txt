Turn loose the lightning metal hawgs  
And set me free  
Turn loose my crying metal hearts  
1200 CC  
Cold steel forever Im gonna ride  
And burn the flame  
That breaths the fire  breaths the fire  
And cant be tamed  
  
Thunder rolling down the highway  
These wheels of fire eat you alive  them  
Outlaw riders going my way  
A Harley child until I die  
  
Maneater  born free I ride  
Maneater  wings of freedom  
Born the line for metal minds  
  
Run to the scorching desert sun  
Vtwins will scream  
Into the blackness of the night at twisting speed  
High on the hawg Im riding on  
Engines explode  
It feels like thunder its breathing fire  
It rules the road  
Milwaukee metal on the highway  
These wheels of fire eat you alive  them  
Outlaw riders going my way  
Only the strong here will survive  
  
Maneater  born free I ride  
Maneater  wings of freedom  
Born the line for metal minds  
  
Them bad boys riding on forever  
When they die they ride in Harley heaven  
  
Maneater  born free I ride  
Maneater  wings of freedom  
Born the line for metal minds  
  
Maneater  born free I ride  
Maneater  wings of freedom  
Born the line for metal minds
