My mind is clearer now  
At last all too well I can see  
Where we all soon will be  
  
If you strip away  
The myth from the man  
You will see where we all soon will be  
  
Jesus Youve started to believe  
The things they say of you  
You really do believe  
This talk of God is true  
  
And all the good Youve done  
Will soon be swept away  
You begun to matter more  
Than the things You say  
  
Listen Jesus I dont like what I see  
All I ask is that You listen to me  
And remember Ive been Your right hand man all along  
You have set them all on fire  
They think theyve found the new Messiah  
And theyll hurt You when they find theyre wrong  
  
I remember when this whole thing began  
No talk of God then we called You a man  
And believe me my admiration for You hasnt died  
But every word You say today is twisted round some other way  
And theyll hurt You if they think Youve lied  
  
Nazareths your famous Son  
Should have stayed a great unknown  
Like His father carving wood  
Hed have made good tables chairs and oaken chests  
Would have suited Jesus best  
Hed have caused nobody harm no one alarm  
  
Listen Jesus do You care for Your race  
Dont You see we must keep in our place  
We are occupied have You forgotten how put down we are  
I am frightened by the crowd for we are getting much too loud  
And theyll crush us if we go too far if we go too far  
  
Listen Jesus to the warning I give  
Please remember that I want us to live  
But its sad to see our chances weakening with every hour  
  
All Your followers are blind too much heaven on their minds  
It was beautiful but now its sour yes its all gone sour  
God Jesus its all gone sour  
  
Listen Jesus to the warning I give  
Come on come on listen to me  
Wont you listen to me
