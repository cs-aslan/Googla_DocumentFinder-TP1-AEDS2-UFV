Theres always one of the girls that all  
  
The guys dream about  
  
And you hold her in your heart  
  
Imagining how youll work it out  
  
So you meet her evry place you can devise  
  
Cause from the start you knew  
  
The one she wants is you  
  
  
  
I know its right when it comes as easy  
  
As apple pie  
  
When you just cant do it wrong  
  
Shes going for evrything you try  
  
If she chose you over all those other guys  
  
It must be luck or simply fate  
  
But its sure worth the wait  
  
  
  
Thats the way I feel about it  
And theres no one who should ever doubt it  
You cant stop a star  
When love is on the rise  
  
  
  
Thats what I believe  
  
Love could be round the corner  
  
All youve got to do is dream  
  
And never compromise  
  
Thats what I believe  
  
  
  
I found the world in my arms the moment  
  
I lost my heart  
  
And the bond is much too strong for  
  
Anyone else to put apart  
  
So I cherish evry moment that shes near  
  
You see the best things in your lives  
  
If you just close your eyes  
  
  
  
Thats the way I feel about it  
  
And she maybe out there  
  
Waiting just like you  
  
Cause at the strangest time and place  
  
Youll find youre face to face  
  
Thats the way I feel about it
