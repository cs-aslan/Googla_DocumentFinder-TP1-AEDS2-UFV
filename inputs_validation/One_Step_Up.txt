Woke up this morning my house was cold  
Checked out the furnace she wasnt burnin  
Went out and hopped in my old Ford  
Hit the engine but she aint turnin  
Weve given each other some hard lessons lately  
But we aint learnin  
Were the same sad story thats a fact  
One step up and two steps back  
  
Bird on a wire outside my motel room  
But he aint singin  
Girl in white outside a church in June  
But the church bells they aint ringing  
Im sittin here in this bar tonight  
But all Im thinkin is  
Im the same old story same old act  
One step up and two steps back  
  
Its the same thing night on night  
Whos wrong baby whos right  
Another fight and I slam the door on  
Another battle in our dirty little war  
When I look at myself I dont see  
The man I wanted to be  
Somewhere along the line I slipped off track  
Im caught movin one step up and two steps back  
  
Theres a girl across the bar  
I get the message shes sendin  
Mmm she aint lookin to married  
And me well honey Im pretending  
Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms  
The music was neverending  
We danced as the evening sky faded to black  
One step up and two steps back
