Turn the pages of this old book  
Sounds familiar it may be worth a second look  
Wrapping up dope in a paper bag  
Talking to yourself taking a drag  
  
What does it matter the things you say  
Theyll never hear it anyway  
Gotta get past the negative things  
Lawyers and business you get what you bring  
  
No ones sorry you did it yourself  
Its time to relax now and then give it hell  
  
Someday youll find what youre looking for  
Someday youll find everything youre looking for  
  
You didnt bet on the Dodgers to beat the Giants  
And David came up  
Now you gotta pay up  
You didnt count on that  
  
Geez half the moneys gone  
The month is still young  
Where are you gonna go now  
You gotta trust someone  
  
Trust someone  
Someone to trust  
Cant go to your brother  
Cause that moneys all gone  
Cant go to your friends  
  
Someday youll find what youre looking for  
Someday youll find everything youre looking for  
Someday youll find everything youre looking for  
Someday youll find everything youre looking for yeah  
  
Made out like a bandit for so many years  
Whatre you looking for  
One more big score  
Whatre you trying to prove  
  
Try to get closer but not too close  
Try to get past it but not too far past it  
Try to get through but not be through  
  
No one can touch you now  
No one can touch you now  
I can touch you now  
Nobody can see you now But I can see you  
  
Youre invisible youve got too many secrets  
Bob Dylan said that  
Or something like that  
  
Someday youll find what youre looking for  
Someday youll find everything youre looking for  
Someday youll find everything youre looking for  
Someday youll find everything youre looking for yeah
