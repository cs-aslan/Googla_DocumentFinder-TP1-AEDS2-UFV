I got an old slouch hat  
Got my roll on my shoulder  
Im as free as a breeze  
And do as I please  
Just to bumming around  
  
Got a million friends  
I dont feel any older  
Ive got nothing to lose  
Not even the blues  
Just to bumming around  
  
Whenever worries start  
To bothering me  
I grab my coat my old slouch hat  
Hit the trail again  
  
You see I aint got a dime  
Dont care where Im going  
Im as free as a breeze  
And do as I please  
Just to bumming around  
  
I hit the trail again  
  
You see I aint got a dime  
Dont care where Im going  
Im as free as a breeze  
And do as I please  
Just to bumming around  
  
Just to bumming around  
Just to bumming around  
Just to bumming around
