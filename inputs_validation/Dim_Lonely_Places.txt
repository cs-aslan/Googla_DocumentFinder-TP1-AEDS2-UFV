Dim lonely places old familiar faces  
Stand out in my memory  
In her eyes the reflection of love and affection  
A picture of what used to be  
  
I still remember that night in December  
When she walked right out of my world  
And now its all over its ending its over  
When I want to be with my girl  
  
I go back to those dim lonely places  
Old familiar faces stand out in my memory  
In her eyes the reflection of love and affection  
A picture of what used to be  
  
I still remember that night in December  
When she walked right out of my world  
And now its all over its ending and its over  
When I want yo be with my girl  
  
I go back to those dim lonely places  
Old familiar faces stand out in my memory  
In her eyes the reflection of love and affection  
A picture of what used to be
