No pot of gold at the end of the rainbow  
No social ladder to climb around here  
No panhandlers going to stake any claim here  
Goldmine is not what its worth know the score  
  
No carpetbaggers come in and take it  
That just doesnt exist anymore  
Rugs and the furniture just cant be lifted  
Everything now has got to be nailed to the floor  
  
So much for capitalism so much for materialism  
Every penny now has got to be earned  
Everyone has got to be here at the coalface  
Taking coals to Newcastle youre going to get burned  
  
No gravy train that stops at your station  
Every penny has got to be earned  
Everyone now has got to be at the coalface  
Try taking coals to Newcastle youre going to get burned  
  
No pot of gold at the end of the rainbow  
No social ladder to climb anymore  
No panhandler can stake a claim here  
Goldmine is not what its worth know the score  
  
No carpetbaggers come in and take it  
Its not there for the taking no more  
Rugs and the furniture cannot be lifted  
Everything has got to be nailed to the floor  
  
No pot of gold end of the rainbow  
No pot of gold end of the rainbow no more  
End of the rainbow no more  
No pot of gold at the end of the rainbow  
No social ladder to climb anymore  
No pot of gold end of the rainbow  
No social ladder to climb  
Know the score
