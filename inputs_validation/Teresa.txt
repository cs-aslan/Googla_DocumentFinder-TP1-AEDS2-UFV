Hey Teresa I saw you in school today  
This is what I got to say  
Mmm youre a honey worth more to me than money  
Cuter to me than a rosebud  
Ill love you forever if youll be my girl  
Oh Im gonna ask you out  
Thats what Im talkin about  
I wanna make a date mmm Id better not wait  
Hey Teresa right away  
Youve got eyes that sparkle  
Hair thats soft like an angel  
I love you Teresa Teresa hope youll be my girl
