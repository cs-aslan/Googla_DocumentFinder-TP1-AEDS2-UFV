I dont know why I feel this way today  
The sky is blue the table is laid  
The trees are heavy with yellow fruit  
And in their shade children happily play  
  
The pears have fallen to the ground  
My child places one in my hand  
The sun is warm upon my face  
And I dream of a burning land  
  
Mother of famine take this pear  
Upon an arrow through the rings of time  
This small fruit this golden prayer  
May it pass from this hand to thine  
  
If I were rain Id rain on somalia  
If I were grain for somalia Id grow  
If I were bread I would rise for somalia  
If I were a river for somalia Id flow  
  
All the mothers will dream of thee  
All the mothers bless thy empty hand  
All the mothers will grieve for thee  
All the sorrow a mother can stand  
  
If we were rain we would rain on somalia  
If we were grain for somalia wed grow  
If we were bread we would rise for somalia  
If we were a river for somalia wed flow
