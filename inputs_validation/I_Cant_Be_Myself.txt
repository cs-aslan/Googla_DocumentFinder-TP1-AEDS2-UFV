Its the way of mine to say just what Im thinking  
And to do the things I really want to do  
And you want to change the part of me Im proud of  
So I cant be myself when Im with you  
Oh you never like the clothes I wear on Sunday  
  
Just because I dont believe the way you do  
But I believe the Lord knows Im unhappy  
Cause I cant be myself when Im with you  
No I cant be myself and be what pleases you  
And down deep inside I dont believe that you want me to  
And its not my way to take so long deciding  
That I cant be myself when Im with you  
No its not my way
