Haunted nights for haleyon days  
Cant sleep to the scraping of his voice  
Natures way struck grief in me  
And I became a ghost in sickness  
  
Willingly guided into heresy  
Beneath the surface stark emptiness  
And youd pity my conviction  
Whereas I thought of myself as a leader  
  
Youd cling to your pleasant hope  
It is twisted fascination  
While Id ruin the obstacles into despair  
And Im praising death  
  
Lost love of the heart  
In a holocaust scene memory  
  
Decrepit body wearing transparent skin  
Inside the smoke of failure  
  
Wept for solace and submit to faith  
In his shadow Im choking  
Yet flourishing  
  
Master  
  
A delusion made me stronger  
Yet Im draped in pale withering flesh  
I sacrificed more than I had  
And left my woes beneath the mire
