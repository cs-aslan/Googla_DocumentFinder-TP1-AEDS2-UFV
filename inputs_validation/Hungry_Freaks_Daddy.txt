Mr america walk on by your schools that do not teach  
Mr america walk on by the minds that wont be reached  
Mr america try to hide the emptiness thats you inside  
But once you find that the way you lied  
And all the corny tricks you tried  
Will not forestall the rising tide of hungry freaks daddy  
They wont go for no more  
Great midwestern hardware store  
Philosophy that turns away  
From those who arent afraid to say whats on their minds  
The left behinds of the great society  
Hungry freaks daddy  
Mr america walk on by your supermarket dream  
Mr america walk on by the liquor store supreme  
Mr america try to hide the product of your savage pride  
The useful minds that it denied  
The day you shrugged and stepped aside  
You saw their clothes and then you cried  
those hungry freaks daddy  
They wont go on four no more  
Great midwestern hardware store  
Philosophy that turns away  
From those who arent afraid to say whats on their minds  
The left behinds of the great society
