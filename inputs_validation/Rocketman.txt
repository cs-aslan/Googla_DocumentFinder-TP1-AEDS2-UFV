She packed my bags last night preflight  
Zero hour nine am  
And Im gonna be high as a kite by then  
I miss the earth so much I miss my wife  
Its lonely out in space  
On such a timeless flight  
  
And I think its gonna be a long long time  
Till touch down brings me round again to find  
Im not the man they think I am at home  
Oh no no no Im a rocket man  
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone  
  
Mars aint the kind of place to raise your kids  
In fact its cold as hell  
And theres no one there to raise them if you did  
And all this science I dont understand  
Its just my job five days a week  
A rocket man a rocket man  
  
And I think its gonna be a long long time
