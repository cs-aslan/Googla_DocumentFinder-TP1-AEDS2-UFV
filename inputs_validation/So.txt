So you make a little money  
Off of somebody elses sweat  
So some people starve a little  
While you get fat  
While you get fat  
So you grind and grind  
And you push and shove  
And claim that those most worthy  
Will get what they deserve  
What they deserve  
  
It cant be true  
It cant be true  
Because Ive seen too many hungry faces  
Ive seen too many with the likes of you  
It cant be true  
  
For you everything has its price  
You give nothing away for free  
If silence were truly golden  
I guess no one could sleep  
No one could sleep  
  
You have money at your fingertips  
People at your beck and call  
And youre fool enough  
To think for a price  
You can have the whole wide world  
  
For all our sakes  
And all our lives  
We must hope the words  
That come from your lips  
We must hope those words are lies  
  
For all our sakes  
And all our lives  
We must hope the dreams  
Soulless visions that you have  
Are never realized  
  
So  
Youve got a big house  
And you drive a fancy car  
So what if your pockets are full  
If you have an empty heart  
  
You snap your fingers  
And all the waters part  
So what if the people bow down  
If they show you no regard  
  
Your left hand  
Always watches your right  
So what if you trust in god  
If you cant sleep at night  
  
You think youve made it  
You think youve got what everyone wants  
So what if youre a big fat man  
With an empty little heart  
  
Who has made a little money  
Off of somebody elses sweat  
Who watched the people starve  
While you got fat  
While you got fat  
You got fat  
You got fat
