I will not let you go I will not let you go I will not let you go  
You know I love you and I want you and I need you more and more  
No I cant I just cant let you go  
Lord knows we were born to be with each other and I aint gonna let you go  
Were sposed to spend our lives together and I just cant let you go  
Because I love you and I want you and I need you more and more  
No I cant darling I just cant let you go  
I know I love you in vain little girl but I still cant let you go  
Im tied to you with chains of love but I just cant let you go  
Because I love you and I want you and I need you more and more

Somebody tell me  
How can my heart withstand so much pain  
And still keep on beating and loving you in vain   
Because I love you and I want you and I need you more and more  
Lord I just cant I just cant let you go  
Well that is why

Because I love you and I want you and I got to have you more and more  
No darling I will not I will not let you go
