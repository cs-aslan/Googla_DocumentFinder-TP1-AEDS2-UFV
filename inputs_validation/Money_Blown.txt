Dont let it fool you brother  
Beware of what you see  
Youve been consumed by all your visions of luxury  
Betrayed your friends and burned the  
Bridges that carry you  
But when you need them later they wont be there for you  
  
Youre so high now  
You think youll never fall  
But when you come down who will you call  
  
Chorus  
Whatcha gonna do when your moneys blown  
Your friends are gone and youre all alone  
Now you barely hanging on with no one else to run to  
You should know it wont make you whole  
You gain the world but lose your soul  
Spend your life in the search for dough  
Youll find out it just wont save you  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
You think that having money brings joy and peace to you  
But the pursuit of it might bring out the beast in you  
Chase the American Dream but cant face reality  
That what youre chasing only lasts temporarily  
  
Youre so high now  
You think youll never fall  
But when you come down who will you call  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
  
Whatcha gonna do when theres nowhere Nowhere to run to oh  
I think youre gonna find that it just wont Just wont save you oh
