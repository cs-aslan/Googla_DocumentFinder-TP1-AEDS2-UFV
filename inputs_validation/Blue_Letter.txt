It was a blue letter  
She wrote to me  
Its silver words she told  
want to be on the road to paradise  
I want to lover who dont get old  
  
Do I read a message in your eyes  
You want to love to stay another night  
Baby when your day goes down  
I wont be waitin around for you  
  
For every voice youve ever heard  
Theres a thousand without a word  
Redbird dont say you told me so  
Just give me one more song to go  
  
Do I read a message in your eyes  
You want to love to stay another night  
Baby when you day goes down  
I wont be waitin around for you
