Swingin my sweet chariot low  
Gotta make it home to georgia  
Excise lawman on my trail  
Im a silver dollar forger  
I see a road block on my right  
Engine take me through the night  
Gotta make it home to the arms of my sweet baby  
  
Twenty miles from that Georgia state  
I can hear the sirens wailing  
If only I can cross that line  
And leave the police trailing  
I see a red light at my rear  
Now Im sweatin cold steel fear  
Gotta make it home to the arms of my sweet baby  
  
Im tired of all this running  
Hiding from the light  
I want to walk out in the sun  
  
Ill soon be home I can see the clay  
Ill soon be in Atlanta  
If only I can hold that line  
I can live just how I want to  
I see the state line in my lights  
Engine take me through the night  
Gotta make it home to the arms of my sweet baby
