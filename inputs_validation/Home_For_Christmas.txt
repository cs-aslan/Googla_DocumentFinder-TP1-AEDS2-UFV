You know that Ill be waiting  
To hear your footsteps saying  
That youll be coming home for Christmas  
  
Please say you wont forget me  
That every moments empty  
But only til youre coming home for Christmas  
  
If I only had wings  
Then I would fly to you  
Through all the snowy weather  
Wed be together  
No one makes me feel the way you do  
  
You know that Ill be waiting  
To hear your footsteps saying  
That youll be coming home  
  
Home for Christmas
