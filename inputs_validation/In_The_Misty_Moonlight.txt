In the misty moonlight  
By the flickering firelight  
Any place is all right  
Long as Im with you  
  
In a far away land  
On a tropic sea sand  
If your hands in my hand  
I wont be blue  
  
Way up on a mountain  
Way down in a valley  
I know Ill be happy  
Any place anywhere  
I dont care  
  
In the misty moonlight  
By the flickering firelight  
Any place is all right  
Long as you are there  
  
In the misty moonlight  
By the flickering firelight  
Any place is all right  
Long as Im with you  
In a far away land  
On a tropic sea sand  
If your hands in my hand  
I wont be blue  
  
Way up on a mountain  
Way down in a valley  
I know Ill be happy  
Any place anywhere  
I dont care  
In the misty moonlight  
By the flickering firelight  
Any place is all right  
Long as you are there  
  
In the misty moonlight  
By the flickering firelight  
Any place is all right  
Long as Im with you  
  
In the misty moonlight  
By the flickering firelight
