Birds and butterflies  
Rivers and mountains she creates  
But youll never know  
The next move shell make  
You can try  
But it is useless to ask why  
Cannot control her  
She goes her own way  
  
She rules until the end of time  
She gives and she takes  
She rules until the end of time  
She goes her own way  
  
With every breath  
And all the choices that we make  
We are only passing through on her way  
I find my strength  
Believing that your soul lives on  
Until the end of time  
Ill carry it with me  
  
Once you will know my dear  
You dont have to fear  
A new beginning always starts at the end  
Until the end of time  
She goes her own way
