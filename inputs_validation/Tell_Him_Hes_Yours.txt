Love the one thats right  
Not the one you keep thinking of  
Open your eyes  
Take a look let him in  
Dont let your life go by dreamin  
Bout some other guy when you are dancin  
With him cheek to cheek  
  
Flying around in a jet  
Champagne and limos you bet  
Laughing and having some fun  
Though hes not even the one  
  
Love the one thats right for love  
Not the one you keep thinking of  
Open your heart  
Take a chance let him in  
Dont try to say that hes not  
Cause of all the things that hes got  
  
For hes just a guy that wants you and hell be true  
And although he just tries to explain  
That all of this funs not a game  
Hell turn around and walk out that door  
Just tell him hes yours
