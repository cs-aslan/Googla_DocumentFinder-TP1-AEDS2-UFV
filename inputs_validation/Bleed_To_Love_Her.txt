Once again she steals away  
Then she reaches out to kiss me  
And how she takes my breath away  
Pretending that she wont miss me  
  
Oh I would bleed to love her  
Bleed to love her  
Oh I would bleed to love her  
  
And once again she calls to me  
Then she vanishes in thin air  
And how she takes my breath away  
Pretending that shes not there  
  
Oh I would bleed to love her  
Bleed to love her  
Oh I would bleed to love her  
  
Somebodys got to see this through  
All the world is laughing at you  
Somebodys got to sacrifice  
If this whole things going to turn out right  
  
Oh I would bleed to love her  
Bleed to love her  
Oh I would bleed to love her
