Such a lovely world was made for you and me  
Wondrous life for us to taste touch smell hear and see  
But one glance from outside looking at our world state  
Clearly displays we dont appreciate it at all  
  
Rain your love down wont you rain down your love  
Let it drench us like the sun from above  
  
Such ability inside you and me  
Made to do anything and be all we can be  
But one birds eye view at us does show oh it shows  
That against Gods Plan weve let it go oh no  
  
Rain your love down wont you rain down your love  
Let it drench us like the sun from above  
Rain your love down let it rain down today  
So that it may wash all our sins away  
  
Youd think the signs would make a difference  
oh make a difference  
Youd think fire next time instead of rain  
Would cause us to make a change  
The world has gone insane  
  
Rain rain your love down wont you rain down your love  
Let it drench us like the sun from above  
Rain your love down let it rain down today  
So that it may wash all our sins away let it rain  
  
Rain your love down let it pour on us please  
Cleansing us from hunger hate war and greed  
Rain your love down wont you let it start over again  
So we can live up to your Master Plan  
  
Rain your love down oh wont you let it start  
Wash the wicked minds and the  
I know theyre sick you know theyre sick we know theyre sick at heart
yeah  
  
Rain your love down wont you let it rain  
Rid this world of drugs disease crime and pain  
Clear our spirits give our minds new software  
With your lesson on honor respect trust and care  
  
Rain your love down I beg for human sake  
For only you can get us out of this state  
Rain your love down rain down on all mankind  
Cause we are out of order and so out of line
