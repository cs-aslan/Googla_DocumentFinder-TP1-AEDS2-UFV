Confusion in her eyes that says it all  
Shes lost control  
And shes clinging to the nearest passer by  
Shes lost control  
  
And she gave away the secrets of her past  
And said Ive lost control again  
And a voice that told her when and where to act  
She said Ive lost control again  
  
And she turned around and took me by the hand and said  
Ive lost control again  
And how Ill never know just why or understand  
She said Ive lost control again  
  
And she screamed out kicking on her side and said  
Ive lost control again  
And seized up on the floor I thought shed die  
She said Ive lost control  
  
Shes lost control again  
Shes lost control  
Shes lost control again  
Shes lost control  
  
Well I had to phone her friend to state my case  
And say shes lost control again  
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes  
And said Ive lost control again  
  
But she expressed herself in many different ways  
Until she lost control again  
And walked upon the edge of no escape  
And laughed Ive lost control  
  
Shes lost control again  
Shes lost control  
Shes lost control again  
Shes lost control
