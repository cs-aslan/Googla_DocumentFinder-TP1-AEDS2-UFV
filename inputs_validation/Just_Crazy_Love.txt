Youve got a sweet sweet way  
You know youll always be the only one  
And if youll let me say  
Youll never be a lonely one  
Well youve just got something  
Makes a girl start feeling crazy  
And Ill do anything if youll let me be your baby  
Even when everybody tells me  
Im just being a fool  
Something inside says Ive got to have you  
And I cant play by the rules  
Ooh baby baby tell me theres a chance for me  
cause Im crazy about you and I know this is love for me  
Well you just got something  
Makes a girl start feeling crazy  
And Ill do anything if youll let me be your baby
