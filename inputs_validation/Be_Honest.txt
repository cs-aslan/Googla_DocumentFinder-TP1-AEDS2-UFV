Okay go go hang your heart on any tree  
You can make yourself available to anybody  
Cause every livin person knows you are a prize  
Whichever way you go Ill be easy to find  
I dont ask for much just be honest with me  
I dont ask for much be honest  
  
Think of this song as a promise you can do what you want  
If you decide you wanna move into a new stage  
Deleting me from pages in your mission statement  
My love is unconditional make no mistake  
I dont ask for much just be honest with me  
I dont ask for much just be honest with me  
  
Who we are when love is what it wants to be  
We are free and we are having the best day ever by far  
Being treated to the light like a superstar  
  
I can hold space while you see what your heart has to say about me  
Theres no dotted line to sign away your freedom  
Ill acknowledge you for what you do to keep strong  
Ill always get behind you dont get me wrong  
I dont ask for much just be honest with me  
I dont ask for much just be honest with me  
I dont ask for much just be honest with me  
  
Who we are when love is what it wants to be  
We are free and we are having the best day ever by far yes we are
