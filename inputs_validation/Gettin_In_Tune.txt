Im singing this note cause it fits in well  
With the chords Im playing  
I cant pretend theres any meaning here  
Or in the things Im saying  
  
But Im in tune  
Right in tune  
Im in tune  
And Im gonna tune  
  
Right in on you  
Right in on you  
Right in on you  
  
I get a little tired of having to say  
Do you come here often  
But when I look in your eyes and see the harmonies  
And the heartaches soften  
  
Im getting in tune  
Right in tune  
Im in tune  
And Im gonna tune  
  
Right in on you right in on you  
Right in on you right in on you  
Right in on you  
  
Ive got it all here in my head  
Theres nothing more needs to be said  
Im just bangin on my old piano  
Im getting in tune with the straight and narrow  
  
Getting in tune with the straight and narrow  
Getting in tune with the straight and narrow  
Getting in tune with the straight and narrow  
Yeah Im getting in tune with the straight and narrow  
Getting in tune with the straight and narrow  
  
Im singing this note cause it fits in well  
With the way Im feeling  
Theres a symphony that I hear in your heart  
Sets my head areeling  
  
But Im in tune  
Right in tune  
Im in tune  
And Im gonna tune  
  
Right in on you right in on you  
Right in on you right in on you  
Right in on you  
  
Baby with you  
Baby with you  
Baby with you  
Baby with you  
Baby with you  
  
Ive got it all here in my head  
Theres nothing more needs to be said  
Im just bangin on my old piano  
Im getting in tune with the straight and narrow  
  
Repeat x2  
Getting in tune with the straight and narrow
