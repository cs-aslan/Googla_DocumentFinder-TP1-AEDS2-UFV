Everyone comes from  
One father one mother  
So why do we complicate  
Our lives so much  
By being at war with each other  
  
Mm maybe Im crazy  
But I dont understand it  
Why do we seem to vote  
To dig more holes  
Its such a waste of a planet  
  
There must be a reason  
That I cant see  
Maybe somebody else now  
Knows better than me  
  
All I know is  
Everyone else is  
A sister or a brother  
So weve got to look around  
Again and stop  
Being at war with each other  
Being at war with each other  
  
Oh  
Maybe Im crazy  
But I dont  
No I dont understand it  
There must be a reason  
There must be a reason  
There must be a reason  
There must be a reason  
  
That I cant see  
Somebody else must be  
Better than me  
All I know is  
Everyone else is  
A sister or brothers  
So weve got to look around  
Again and stop  
Being at war with each other  
Being at war with each other
