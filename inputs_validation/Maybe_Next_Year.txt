MAYBE NEXT YEAR  
  
When you turn on the radio  
You hear the cheerful sound  
Of Christmas carols old and new  
Sung out loud  
  
When you look around  
You can see the decors Hanging bright  
People in panic but smiling  
Rushing around laughing out loud  
  
Its not the best of times to say  
Were better off apart  
Its not the best of times to tell  
The people we both love  
That its over  
That its over  
  
CHORUS  
But since this is the season of cheer  
Well just brush away our tears  
And go on our way pretending  
That were together still  
Well tell tem tomorrow  
Or may be another day  
Maybe we wont have to say a single thing  
Maybe next year well say hello again  
Instead of goodbye
