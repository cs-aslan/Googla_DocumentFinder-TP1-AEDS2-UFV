Yeah yeah yeah  
  
I have not come yeah  
To testify  
About our bad bad misfortune  
And I aint here a wondrin why  
But Ill live on and Ill be strong  
Cause it just aint my cross to bear  
  
I sat down and wrote you a long letter  
It was just the other day  
Said sure as the sunrise baby  
Tomorrow Ill be up and on my way  
But Ill live on and Ill be strong  
Cause it just aint my cross to bear  
Oh no  
  
Oh but Ill live on and Ill be strong  
Cause it just aint my cross to bear  
Yes now baby  
  
But in the end baby  
Long towards the end of your road  
Dont reach out for me babe  
Cause Im not gonna carry your load  
But Ill live on and Ill be strong  
Cause it just aint my cross to bear  
Yeah yeah
