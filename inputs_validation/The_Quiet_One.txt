Chorus  
Everybody calls me the quiet one  
You can see but you cant hear me  
Everybody calls me the quiet one  
You can try but you cant get near me  
I aint never had the gift of gab  
But I cant talk with my eyes  
When words fail me you wont nail me  
My eyes can tell you lies  
  
Still waters run deep so be careful I dont drown you  
Youve got nothing to hear Ive got nothing to say  
Sticks and stones may break your bones  
But names can never down you  
It only takes two words to blow you away  
  
Chorus  
Everybody calls me the quiet one  
But you just dont understand  
You cant listen you wont hear me  
With your head stuck in the sand  
I aint never had time for words that dont rhyme  
My head is in a cloud  
I aint quiet  everybody else is too loud  
  
Still waters run deep so be careful I dont drown you  
Youve got nothing to hear Ive got nothing to say  
Sticks and stones may break my bones  
But names can never down you  
It only takes two words to blow you away
