Hey daddy just lost his pay  
What did he do it for  
It never made it through our door  
He drank the whole week away  
And what can a family say  
There must be a better way  
Now mama dont start to cry  
Lets give him another try  
  
Pick up the telephone  
Tell him you want him home  
To sit and watch the evenings pass  
And readin the leaves of grass  
  
Im caught in a closing door  
Its pinning me to the floor  
Now mama dont start to cry  
Lets give him another try  
  
Im caught in a closing door  
Its pinning me to the floor  
Now mama dont start to cry  
Lets give him another try  
  
When were old and gray  
And the things we say are the things we really mean  
So why cause a scene  
When things aint what they seem  
cause the end results the same  
Now what can a family say  
There must be a better way  
Now mama dont start to cry  
Lets give him another try
