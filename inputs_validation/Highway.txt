Its a long long highway  
Will this road of life lead me to someone  
Who sees the world in a grain of sand  
Who holds the future in the palm of their hand aaah  
  
No one else can see things like I do  
Its a long long highway  
Looking for a home where the seed was sown  
And the harvest was young  
  
Will this road of life lead me to someone someone  
The rays of sun and the light of dawn  
My inspriation since the day I was born aaah  
No one else can see things like I do  
  
Its a long long highway  
But dont make the start on an empty heart  
When you think youve begun  
Let the road of life lead you to someone someone  
  
Nothing is serious to me  
I live for what will be listen to me  
I can always be a dreamer  
So trust your heart  
  
Dont fall apart  
Youll see  
At your journeys end  
You will find a friend in me  
  
Its a long long highway  
Will this road of life lead me to someone  
You touched the dream that was in your eyes  
You took so long only to realize oooh  
  
No one else can love you like I do  
Its a long long highway  
Looking for a home where the seed was sown  
And my harvest was young  
  
Will this road of life lead me to someone  
Its a long long highway  
But dont make a start  
On an empty heart  
  
Its a long long highway  
Let this road of life lead you to someone someone
