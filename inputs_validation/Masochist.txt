She says youre a masochist for falling for me  
So roll up your sleeves  
And I think that I like her cause she tells me things I dont want to hear  
Medicinal tongue in my ear  
  
When will it stop When will it stop  
  
When will I feel all soft on the inside  
When will I feel all soft on the inside  
When will I feel soft soft  
  
You say that my skin feels like no one elses  
That its different somehow  
But I dont understand isnt a hand just a hand  
No you dont understand  
  
When will it start My broken part  
  
When will I feel all soft on the inside  
When will I feel all soft on the inside  
When will I feel soft soft  
  
Oooo  
  
When will I feel all soft on the inside  
When will I feel all soft on the inside  
When will I feel soft soft  
  
She says youre a masochist for falling for me
