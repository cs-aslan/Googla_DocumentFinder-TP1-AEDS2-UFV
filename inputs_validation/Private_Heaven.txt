Ah what happened to our little girl  
She doesnt sing like she used to do  
Ah why wont she say it to the world  
She doesnt want us anymore She is gone  
  
In a private heaven  
They may try  
But nobody can find you  
In a private heaven  
  
Close your eyes  
Its waiting right behind you  
Ah when did her laughter fly away  
She doesnt smile like she used to do  
  
Ah where is her happy yesterday  
She doesnt want us anymore She is gone  
In a private heaven  
They may try  
  
But nobody can find you  
In a private heaven  
Close your eyes  
Its waiting right behind you  
  
You cant take our love away  no you cant  
You cant take our love away  please dont take  
You cant take our love away  no you cant now  
You cant take our love away  please dont take it  
You cant take our love away  no you cant  
You cant take our love away  please dont take  
You cant take our love away  cant take it away  
You cant take our love away  cant take it away  
You cant take our love away  you cant take it away  
  
Ah will you be coming home again  
She doesnt have somewhere else to go  
Ah who will become your special friend  
I will be taking her away She is gone  
In a private heaven  
They may try  
But nobody can find you  
In a private heaven  
Close your eyes  
Its waiting right behind you
