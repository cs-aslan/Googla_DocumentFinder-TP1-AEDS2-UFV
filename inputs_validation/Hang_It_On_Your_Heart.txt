Am I 12 am I 104  
I am the hanging man and thats for sure  
I know for sure  
Follow your heart  
Dont mess around  
Follow your heart  
  
Doesnt matter where you catch a start  
You take the future and you pin it pin it hang it on your heart  
Wishing on a star  
No use your wishing on a star  
If you wanna know where to start yeah  
If you wanna know where to start  
Hang it on your heart  
Hang it on your heart  
  
Double vison is the state of the art  
Indecision tearing me apart  
Dont fall apart  
Follow your heart  
Dont muck around  
Follow your heart  
Wishing on a star  
Dont do your wishing on a star  
If you wanna know where to start yeah  
If you wanna know where to start  
Hang it on your heart  
Hang it on your heart  
  
Clocks tick around in your town  
Sleep clocks around in a sleepy town  
Cant keep a good thing down  
You cant keep a good thing down  
  
If you wanna know where to start yeah  
If you wanna know where to start  
Hang it on your heart  
Hang it on your heart  
  
Hang it on your heart  
Hang it on your heart  
Hang it on your heart  
Hang it on your heart  
  
Hang it on your heart  
Hang it on your heart  
Hang it on your heart  
Hang it on your heart
