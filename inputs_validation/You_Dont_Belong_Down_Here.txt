Sky rise so haunting on the other side of the street  
Two thin white lines between where you are and where you should be  
I know sometimes when you fly you think youre larger than life  
But then you come crashing down and youre asleep on the ground  
A king without his crown  
Chorus  
You dont belong down here  
You dont belong down here  
You dont belong down here  
Anymore not ever  
This park is an island in a sea of despair  
In the heart of the city of angels who arent even there  
I see you praying for hope while you keep worshipping dope  
The devil right by your side and I see death in your eyes  
Will you live or do you have the will to die  
CHORUS  
Doo doo doo doo  
I want to do things before they become  
The things I should have done in my life  
CHORUS  
We dont belong down here  
You dont belong down here  
You dont belong and we dont belong  
We dont belong down here  
We dont belong down here  
We dont belong  
No one belongs down here anymore  
Not ever
