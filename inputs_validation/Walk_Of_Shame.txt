One step two steps  
Counting tiles on the floor  
Three steps four steps  
Guess this means that Im a whore  
Uhoh  
Hell no  
How long til I reach the door  
Fuck me  
My feet are sore  
  
Im wearing last nights dress and I look like a hot ass mess  
Although my hair looks good cause I havent slept yet  
  
Make the elevator come a little faster  
Im pushing all the buttons but nothings happening  
Please God dont let anybody see me  
Please God Ill do anything you ask of me  
I promise no more walks of shame  
  
So walk this way were walking were walking  
Walk this way were walking were walking  
  
Last nights bubblegum  
No more bubbles no more yum  
Whered I get the wristband  
Tell me theres no tramp stamp  
One two three shoot  
No I know that shit aint cute  
But damn the man it sure is fun  
To party til the sun wakes up  
  
Okay now raise two hands if youve ever been guilty  
And clap clap clap clap clap it out if youve walked with me  
  
Make the elevator come a little faster  
Im pushing all the buttons but nothings happening  
Please God dont let anybody see me  
Please God Ill do anything you ask of me  
I promise no more walks of shame  
  
So walk this way were walking were walking  
Walk this way were walking were walking  
  
I shouldnt have let em take my keys take my keys  
They left me here  
With too much beer  
My friends they hung me out to dry  
Its not my fault and thats why  
Im doin the walk of shame  
  
Make the elevator come a little faster  
Im pushing all the buttons but nothings happening  
Please God dont let anybody see me  
Please God Ill do anything you ask of me  
I promise no more walks of shame  
  
So walk this way were walking were walking  
Walk this way were walking were walking  
  
So walk this way were walking were walking  
Walk this way were walking were walking
