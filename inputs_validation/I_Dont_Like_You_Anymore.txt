Yeah you told me youd meet me at a movie show  
I waited and I waited but I had to go  
Youre not the only girl in town  
I wont stand for your foolin around  
Ohno ahah I dont like you no more  
Well we went to a party last Saturday night  
Thought that everything would be all right  
But you had to go and put me down  
I just wont stand for your foolin around  
Ohno ahah I dont dig you no more  
Remember baby when we first met  
You said youd be my by in pet  
Then you turned around just like that  
Youre treatin Eddie like a wornout hat  
Youre a twotime lover and a fulltime flirt  
You aint nothin but a schemer in a very tight skirt  
But Im gonna go and do the town  
I wont stand for your foolin around  
Ohno ahah I dont dig you no more
