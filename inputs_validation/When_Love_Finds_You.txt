Love sure is something no one can explain  
It can bring you such joy it can bring you pain  
And with every emotion love puts us through  
Theres nothing you can say when love finds you  
  
Love is the power that makes your heart beat  
It can make you move mountains make you drop to your knees  
When it finally hits you you wont know what to do  
Theres nothin you can say when love finds you  
  
Chorus  
Give it all you can give it when your love comes around  
If you put your heart in it then it wont let you down  
Youll find out its true baby someday when love finds you  
  
And when you least expect it it will finally come true  
Theres nothing you can say when love finds you  
  
Chorus  
  
Youll find out its true baby someday when love finds you
