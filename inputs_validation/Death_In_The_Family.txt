Fabolous talking  
I dont got time for all this  
Just fast forward to the part where he start killing shit  
Yeah like right here  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
  
Fabolous  
Tough times dont last but tough people do  
I father nggas the way wayne and puff reproduce  
Lil rap bastards  
Running round with your snapback caps backwards  
Should be in rap caskets  
Who you think showed them the go hard with stunting  
And who you think showed em that those broads was nothing  
And who you think showed em that those cars was something  
And when fathers day came I got no card or nothing  
So I aint out here trying to expose frauds for nothing  
And I aint out here pulling these hoes cards for nothing  
They was bitches on deck yall made em queens  
Watching sports with a chick that got ball player dreams swish  
Im watching these dogs play with my old bones  
I feel like nggas done found one of my old phones  
We in the house yall looking to hold loans  
And when the market was up you wouldnt have sold homes  
So this the foreclosure of the wannabe  
If you cant be yourself then who you gonna be  
Dad to your swag your style was like a son to me  
Your stylist got thank yous you never sent one to me  
Lets pray for em  
Yall repeat this one with me  
now I lay me down to sleep I pray for those who run with me  
If I die before I wake arrest the girl I brung with me  
I give the Lord my swag to take whenever God is done with me  
  
Hook  
I be saying to myself as I put on da gloves  
It hurts when you gotta kill a ngga you love x4  
  
Paul Cain  
Yeah  
Its painful when bestfriends become ya enemies  
And you finding out that they not who they pretend to be wow  
The whole time you conspired to put an end to me  
And Im still trying to show this ngga love silly me  
So I might shed tears as I put on my gloves  
But I wont show emotions when I fill him with slugs  
Cause nggas die everyday here  
And you can get hit picking ya seed up from daycare  
Nggas dont play fair  
Thats why Im straightforward fck being all discrete  
If I can knock em off quick fck beefing all for weeks  
So we was up late night hunting yall was sleep  
Cause we the wolves hiding in clothes yall the sheep  
Who taught ya the game who showed yall the streets  
And who bought em them things they sold yall for cheap  
And who came up the bill when them hoes called police  
Now you fronting so I gotta expose yall to see  
Ungrateful motherfcker who fed you when you was hurting me  
Whenever drama came up who was putting the work in me  
I was spitting live on hot 9  
You was still rehearsing  
Already my son and this was before I met you in person  
So no matter how many colorful fake chains you purchase  
Like that bullshit you wearing  
Youre always gonna b worthless  
You just spit it I lived it  
Whos really writing the verses  
Lose put em in the casket who you think driving the hearses
