Theres a little girl out lyin on her own  
Shes got a broken heart  
Shes not the kind to take you down for long  
She knows and plays it smart  
  
Ah And if shes comin shes showed no mark  
Shes heard no whistle blowin from the dark  
She feels like leavin and she dont know why  
Without no bridges shes trapped so I sigh  
  
Dont cross the river if you cant swim the tide  
Dont try denyin livin on the other side  
All your life  
You were on your own  
  
If you want you can ride my train  
And soon forget the reason that youre leaving  
Youll lose yourself and then sometime  
Maybe even save yourself some grievin  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Dont cross the river if you cant swim the tide  
Dont try denyin livin on the other side  
Dont cross the river if you cant swim the tide  
Dont try denyin livin on the other side  
Dont cross the river if you cant swim the tide  
Dont cross the river if you cant swim the tide  
Dont cross the river if you cant swim the tide
