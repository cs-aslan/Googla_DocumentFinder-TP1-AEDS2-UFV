Well now friends just lend an ear  
For youre now about to hear the ballad of Cat Ballouou  
Its a song thats newly made and Professor Sam the Shade  
And the Sunrise Kid are singin it for you  
Cat Ballou  Cat Ballou  
  
Its a hangin day in Wolf City Wyomin  
Wolf City Wyomin eighteenninetyfour  
Theyre gonna drop Cat Ballouou  
Through the gallows floor  
  
She killed a man in Wolf City Wyomin  
Wolf City Wyomin killed a man its true  
And that is why theyre ahangin hangin Cat Ballou  
  
She has the smile of an angel Fights like the Devil  
The eyes of an angel Bites like the Devil  
The face of an angel I say shes the Devil  
Shes mean and evil through and through  
  
Cat Ballou Cat Ballououou  
Shes mean and evil through and through  
  
With her outlaw band theyre now tellin a story  
Now tellin a story how she rode the plain  
The wildest gal in the Weest since Calamity Jane  
  
And todays the day that shes goin to glory  
Shes goin to glory for the way she sinned  
Theyll be aspeedin her sououl on the wayward wind  
  
She has the smile of an angel Fights like the Devil  
The eyes of an angel Bites like the Devil  
The face of an angel I say shes the Devil  
Shes mean and evil through and through  
  
Cat Ballou Cat Ballou  
Cat Ballououou Cat Ballououou  
Shes mean and evil through and through  
Cat Ballou Cat Ballououou  
Shes mean and evil through and through
