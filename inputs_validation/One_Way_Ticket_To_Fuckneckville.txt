No sleep til Fuckneckville its kind of funny you may not realize it until  
Phone call stop cant get laid you find out where the parties were some time
the next day  
  
One way ticket to seclusion now your losin  
One way ticket to alienation youre an inside joke  
  
Is everybody supposed to be impressed with your ability to make us feel less
significant than you  
Were all chippin in the purchase you a one way first class ticket outta town  
  
Millions sold a mega star theres a million assholes with ten million
guitars  
Enjoy it now soon it ends suddenly you find yourself without any friends  
  
One way ticket to isolation you can hang with you  
Youve been given a citation for excessive social faux pas and obnoxiousness  
  
Go ahead keep telling us your fifteenminute stories about what you had for
breakfast then for lunch  
Were all chippin for one big humble pie were gonna smash it in your face  
Go ahead tell us about your last great sold out concert and how your new
records gonna top the charts  
We dont care bout your expenses we just wanna have a laugh at your expense
