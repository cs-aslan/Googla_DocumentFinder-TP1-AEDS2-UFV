Well Jesus was an only son  
As he walked up Calvary Hill  
His mother Mary walking beside him  
In the path where his blood spilled  
Jesus was an only son  
In the hills of Nazareth  
As he lay reading the Psalms of David  
At his mothers feet  
  
A mother prays Sleep tight my child sleep well  
For Ill be at your side  
That no shadow no darkness no tolling bell  
Shall pierce your dreams this night  
  
In the garden at Gethsemane  
He prayed for the life hed never live  
He beseeched his Heavenly Father to remove  
The cup of death from his lips  
  
Now theres a loss that can never be replaced  
A destination that can never be reached  
A light youll never find in anothers face  
A sea whose distance cannot be breached  
  
Well Jesus kissed his mothers hands  
Whispered Mother still your tears  
For remember the soul of the universe  
Willed a world and it appeared
