Now youre gone  
I can feel my heart is breaking  
An I cant go on  
When I think of the love that youve taken  
  
In the night I pray for your embrace  
Every time I close my eyes  
I cant escape your face  
Youre out of sight  
But always on my mind  
I never realized  
My love could be so blind  
  
Youre all I want  
Cant you feel the love  
In this heart of mine  
Youre all I need  
So maybe we could turn back  
The hands of time  
Maybe we could give it another try  
One more time  
  
But now youre gone  
Theres an emptiness closing around me  
An I cant go on  
When all I have left is the memory  
  
In the night I call out your name  
I wake up in a cold sweat  
An Im all alone again  
I need your love  
Much more than I can say  
I realize without you  
I cant face another day  
  
Youre all I want  
Cant you feel the love  
In this heart of mine  
Youre all that I need  
Since I lost you girl  
Ive been losing my mind  
Youre all that I want  
So maybe we could turn back  
The hands of time  
Maybe we could give it  
Another try  
One more time  
Baby just one more time  
  
Now youre gone  
I can feel my heart is breaking  
An I cant go on  
When all of my love has been taken  
  
Youre all I want  
Cant you feel the love  
In this heart of mine  
Youre all that I need  
Since I lost you girl  
Ive been losing my mind  
  
Youre all I want  
Cant you feel the love  
In this heart of mine  
Youre all that I need  
Since I lost you girl  
Ive been losing my mind
