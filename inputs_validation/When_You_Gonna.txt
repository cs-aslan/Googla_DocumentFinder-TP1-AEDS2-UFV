Rick  
Love is a special thing  
It means more to me than just a wedding ring  
When two people join as one  
They dont know just what has begun  
  
It comes to love honor cherish and obey  
You promised girl that you would not go away  
  
When you gonna come back home girl  
You know Im all alone girl  
When you gonna come back home  
When you gonna come back home girl  
You know Im all alone girl  
When you gonna come back home  
  
Lisa  
Love is a precious thing  
So cant you see the joy that it can bring  
So how can you be so cruel  
Youve gone and broken every rule  
  
You promised to love honor cherish and obey  
You promised me youd never go away  
  
When you gonna stay at home boy  
You see I was alone boy  
When you gonna stay at home  
When you gonna stay at home boy  
You see I was alone boy  
When you gonna stay at home  
  
Rick
