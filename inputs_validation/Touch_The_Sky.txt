Used to carry this big old world  
On my shoulders and back  
I used to lie inside my room  
Wondering where I am at  
  
I felt a chill running through my veins  
And wondered would I be saved  
I felt the ice building in my soul  
Would it melt away  
  
Hes a warm breeze  
Breathing life into me  
Hes the sunlight  
Shining down on me  
  
I used to worry my life away  
Counting every dime  
Shutting out the ones I loved  
Never finding the time  
  
And then one day I was overcome  
By loneliness and despair  
And deep inside I thought I heard  
Lean on me Im here  
  
Hes a warm breeze  
Breathing life into me  
Hes the sunlight  
Shining down on me  
I pulled the burden from off my back  
And tossed it into the wind  
And stretched my arms toward the sky  
And let my life begin  
  
And like a tree I have measured up  
Best when Ive been cut down  
And like a tree I can touch the sky  
With my feet on the ground  
  
Hes a warm breeze  
Breathing life into me  
Hes the sunlight  
Shining down on me  
  
Hes a warm breeze  
Breathing life into me  
Hes the sunlight  
Shining down on me yeah  
Shining down on me  
Shining down shining down  
Shining down on me
