How many times must I tell her  
How many times must I say  
I wont be around to pick her up again  
From now on shell have to find her own way  
  
How many years have I loved her  
While she stood by so unconcerned  
But the things she dont know Ill teach her when I go  
Shes been wrong and I think its time she learned  
  
I think its time she learned  
Love cant live when love is not returned  
She thought that I would always stand by  
But shes been wrong and I think its time she learned  
  
I think its time she learned  
Love cant live when love is not returned  
She thought that I would always stand by  
But shes been wrong and I think its time she learned  
  
Shes been wrong and I think its time she learned
