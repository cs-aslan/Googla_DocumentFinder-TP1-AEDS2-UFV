Verse 1  
For all the times that you rain on my parade  
And all the clubs you get in using my name  
You think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness sake  
You think Im crying on my own well I aint  
  
PreChorus  
And I didnt wanna write a song cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still
care  
I dont but you still hit my phone up  
And baby I be movin on and I think you should be somethin  
I dont wanna hold back maybe you should know that  
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone  
And I never like to admit that I was wrong  
And Ive been so caught up in my job didnt see whats going on  
And now I know Im better sleeping on my own  
  
Chorus  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin  
You should go and love yourself  
  
Verse 2  
But when you told me that you hated my friends  
The only problem was with you and not them  
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong  
And tried to make me forget where I came from  
  
PreChorus  
And I didnt wanna write a song cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still
care  
I dont but you still hit my phone up  
And baby I be movin on and I think you should be somethin  
I dont wanna hold back maybe you should know that  
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone  
And I never like to admit that I was wrong  
And Ive been so caught up in my job didnt see whats going on  
And now I know Im better sleeping on my own  
  
Chorus  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin  
You should go and love yourself  
  
Bridge  
For all the times that you made me feel small  
I fell in love now I fear nothin at all  
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable  
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls  
  
Chorus  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin  
You should go and love yourself  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin  
You should go and love yourself
