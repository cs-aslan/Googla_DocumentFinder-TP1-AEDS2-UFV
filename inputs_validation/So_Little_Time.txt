Took a while to drag me out of bed  
Aim some coffee at my head  
Saw the clock Im running late  
Its an ordinary day  
And Im like a dog on head  
Knock one out and then fall asleep  
Its sad but true  
Id rather be with you  
Dont you forget about me  
When youre a celebrity  
It will be only you and me before too long  
So little time so much to do  
Id rather spend my days with you  
So little time so much to do  
Id like to spend one day with you  
And if that day is not enough  
Maybe we can stay in touch  
But Im not making plans for tomorrow  
For tomorrow nevre comes  
Said Ive been celibate for years  
Not out of chance theres noone here  
See I cant get my end away  
Another ordinary day  
And Id love to see a little more of you  
Your clothes would look better on my bedroom floorbedroom floor  
Dont you forget about me  
When youre a celebrity  
I know youre busy  
But we all need somebody  before too long  
Its in your eyes oooooh
