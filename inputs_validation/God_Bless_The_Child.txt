Them thats got shall get  
Them thats not shall lose  
So the Bible says  
And it still is news  
  
Chorus  
Your mama may have  
Your papa may have  
But God bless the child  
Whos got his own  
  
The strong get more  
The weak ones fade  
Empty pockets  
Well they dont ever make the grade  
  
Chorus  
  
When youve got money  
Youve got lots of friends  
Theyre always hangin around your door  
But when the moneys all gone  
And the spending ends  
They dont come around much anymore  
  
Rich relations give  
A crust of bread and such  
You can help yourself  
But you better not take too much no  
  
Chorus  
  
Them thats got shall get  
Them thats not shall lose  
So the Bible says  
And it still is news  
  
Chorus
