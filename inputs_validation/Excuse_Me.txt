Excuse me  
Youre wearing out my joie de vie  
Grabbing those good years again  
I want to be alone  
  
Excuse me  
Im not the man I used to be  
Someone else crept in again  
I want to be alone  
  
Excuse me please  
Im looking for Lost Angeles  
Soaking up the sin again  
I want to be alone  
  
You got the money back thats okay  
Who needs a Cadillac anyway  
I got the medicine make you see the light  
Call me in Alaska if it all turns out right Alright  
  
Excuse me please  
Youre standing on my memories  
Stealing souvenirs again  
I want to be alone  
  
Leave me alone I want to be alone  
repeated several times  
  
You got the money back thats okay  
Who needs a Cadillac anyway  
I got the medicine make you see the light  
Call me in Alaska if it all turns out right
