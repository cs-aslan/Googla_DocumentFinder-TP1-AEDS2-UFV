Here it go  
See this is the part I was worried about  
Everybody thinks that my career was down the tubes  
And I must be in some dusty garage  
Inhalin the carbon monoxide fumes  
And everyones tellin me what I should do and how I should come out or what
to rap about  
And I know that I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out  
And Im not sure how this is gonna come off  
Theyre probably gonna think that Im comin off as cocky  
Like I just started givin a fuck what you really think about me worship  
See the thing about me is you dont really know a thing about me  
Everyones makin a stink about me  
Like its some kind of a aura of that up that came around me  
Surround me with nothin but gangsters killers and bangers
