Somewhere in the night  
Theres a heart that beats so fast  
I can feel the heat  
Of the fire in your eyes  
Burning like a naked flame  
Waiting for the ice to break  
Counting down the days  
Waiting for the weekend  
Lonely is the night  
Silence is a friend to walk with  
With no one else to talk to  
  
But on a Friday night  
Its alright its alright  
You can be who you want to be  
Take off for the weekend  
If you can dance you can dance with me  
cause its Friday night  
  
Its alright its alright  
Nothings gonna stop me now  
Im all wired up and ready to go  
Im on my way  
Lets get on with the show  
  
Here comes the weekend  
Here comes the weekend  
  
Somewhere in the heat  
Theres a heart that beats so fast  
I can hear your voice  
Talk to me tonight  
Taking a different face  
Every time I hear your name  
Im counting down the days  
Waiting for the weekend  
  
Lonely is the night  
When all are sleeping  
Silence is a friend you walk with  
With no one else to talk to  
  
But on a Friday night  
Its alright its alright  
You can be who you want to be  
Take off for the weekend  
If you dance you can dance with me  
cause its Friday night  
Its alright its alright  
  
Nothings gonna stop me now  
Im all wired up and ready to go  
And Im on my way  
Its the weekend  
And its starting today  
  
Here comes the weekend  
Here comes the weekend
