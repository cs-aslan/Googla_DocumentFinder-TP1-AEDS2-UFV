Theres a silent movie  
Running off its reel inside my mind  
As I try to fall asleep tonight  
On prescription lullabies  
In the darkness theres a doorway  
That leads me back to you forever  
But these days theres only  
You and I in photographs  
Ambitions and dreams weve shared  
Now I wonder who has got the last laugh  
Cause I know youre crying  
And you know Im cold inside  
Got no expectations for my pride  
And I reach for that glittering prize  
I remember on our wedding day  
Looking back at you  
Our eyes met and we said goodbye  
As we both said I do  
Didnt I make a promise baby  
I would stand by you forever  
But sometimes the bestlaid plans  
Flare up and blow away  
And fairytale logic comes  
Sweeps you heart  
Your soul your world away  
Cause I know youre crying  
And you know Im cold inside  
And Im tired of living with that lie  
And now time is flying  
And you know I miss that fire  
But I feel for you  
Ive got desire  
So I reach for that glittering prize  
No dolls house dreams  
Or valentines  
Just the future at the door  
Just leaving trains and empty rooms  
A broken band of gold  
Cause love dont live here anymore  
And some nights Ill come and see you  
And I know youll let me in  
Two strangers in silence now  
Cause you know in love  
We could never win  
I know youre crying  
And you know Im cold inside  
And Im tired of living with this lie  
These days  
Cause now time is flying  
And you know I miss that fire  
Cause I feel for you  
Ive got desire  
Baby baby  
In my world in your world tonight  
Reach for that glittering prize in my world  
Thats all I ever seemed to do in your world tonight  
Was reach for the glittering prize in my world  
I lost myself when I lost you in your world tonight  
As I reached for that glittering prize in my world  
And I hope that all your dreams come true in your world tonight  
When you reach for that glittering prize in my world  
In your world  
In my world tonight
