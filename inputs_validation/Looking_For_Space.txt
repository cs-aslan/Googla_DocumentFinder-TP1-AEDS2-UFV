On the road of experience Im trying to find my own way  
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away  
When I think that Im moving suddenly things stand still  
Im afraid cause I think they always will  
  
And Im looking for space  
And to find out who I am  
And Im looking to know and understand  
Its a sweet sweet dream  
Sometimes Im almost there  
Sometimes I fly like an eagle  
And sometimes Im deep in despair  
  
All alone in the universe sometimes thats how it seems  
I get lost in the sadness and the screams  
Then I look in the center suddenly everythings clear  
I find myself in the sunshine and my dreams  
  
And Im looking for space  
And to find out who I am  
And Im looking to know and understand  
Its a sweet sweet dream  
Sometimes Im almost there  
Sometimes I fly like an eagle  
And sometimes Im deep in despair  
  
On the road of experience join in the living day  
If theres an answer its just that its just that way  
  
When youre looking for space  
And to find out who you are  
When youre looking to try and reach the stars  
Its a sweet sweet sweet dream  
Sometimes Im almost there  
Sometimes I fly like an eagle  
But sometimes Im deep in despair  
Sometimes I fly like an eagle  
Like an eagle  
I go flying flying
