Oh yeah yeah  
Aint that bad aint that black aint that fine yeah  
Aint that bad aint that black and aint that fine  
Sunday after meetings and Saturday with a man  
Sweet potato pie when you eat from the pan  
Aint that bad aint that black and aint that fine  
Aint that bad and aint that black and aint that fine  
Can you dig it  
Dancing the latest dance and eating ribs and tips  
Digging all the new sounds and drinking gin in sips  
Aint that bad aint that black and aint that fine baby  
Aint that bad aint that black aint that fine  
I could go for a ride on your sweet jelly roll  
But I wouldnt give nothing for my juicy juicy soul  
I could go for a ride on your sweet jelly roll  
But I wouldnt give nothing for my juicy juicy soul  
Aint that bad aint that black and aint that fine  
Aint that bad and aint that black and aint that fine  
Lets go lets go lets go  
To tie up my do right  and tighten up my fro  
Wrapping myself in black and still I shine and glow  
Aint that bad aint that black and aint that fine  
Aint that bad aint that black and aint that fine
