So you came from New York city  
And you want to see the sights  
Youve heard all about those cowboys  
And their crazy Texas nights  
  
I see youve got your eye on something  
Leaning on the bar  
But the toughest ride hes ever had  
Was in his foreign car  
  
So dont call him a cowboy  
Until youve seen him ride  
Cause a Stetson hat and them fancy boots  
Dont tell you whats inside no  
  
And if he aint good in the saddle  
Lord you wont be satisfied  
So dont call him a cowboy  
Until youve seen him ride  
  
He was a Hollywood idea  
Of the wild and wooly west  
In his French designer blue jeans  
And his custom tailored vest  
  
Youre thinkin hes the real thing  
But I think you oughta know  
He cant even make it through  
A one night rodeo no  
  
So dont call him a cowboy  
Until youve seen him ride  
Cause a Stetson hat and them fancy boots  
Dont tell you whats inside no  
  
And if he aint good in the saddle  
Lord you wont be satisfied  
So dont call him a cowboy  
Until youve seen him ride  
  
Dont call him a cowboy  
Until youve seen him ride  
Cause a Stetson hat and them fancy boots  
Dont tell you whats inside no  
  
And if he aint good in the saddle  
Lord you wont be satisfied  
So dont call him a cowboy  
Until youve seen him ride  
Dont call him a cowboy  
Until youve seen him ride
