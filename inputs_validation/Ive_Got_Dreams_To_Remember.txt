Ive got dreams dreams to remember  
Ive got dreams dreams to remember  
Honey I saw you there last night  
Another womans arms holding you tight  
Nobody knows what I feel inside  
All I know that I walked away and cried  
Ive got dreams dreams to remember  
Ive got dreams oh nothin but dreams to remember  
I know you said she was just your friend  
But I saw you kiss her again and again and again  
These eyes of mine they dont fool me  
Why did she hold you so tenderly  
Cause Ive got dreams dreams to remember  
Ive got dreams oh dreams to remember  
Hey and I and I still want you to stay  
I still love you anyway anyway  
I dont want you ever to leave  
Cause boy you satisfy me oh  
I know you said she was just a friend  
I saw you kiss her again and again and again  
And these eyes of mine they dont fool me  
Why did she hold you so tenderly  
Cause Ive got dreams dreams dreams to remember  
Oh Ive got dreams oh Ive got dreams to remember  
Ive got dreams oh oh oh oh baby  
Beautiful wonderful dreams Ive got em to remember  
And Ive got dreams dreams to remember
