Will there be tomorrow  
Tell me how can you be sure  
There aint always next season  
There aint always an open door  
  
Life is dear dont you waste it  
The future no one can see  
So step aside and let it be  
Tomorrow may wash away  
Dont put off what you do today  
Take advantage while you are here  
Cause this moment is all there is  
  
Do you smell the flowers  
While they are still here in bloom  
Does there have to be a reason  
If you dont think well be gone real soon  
  
Life is here can you taste it  
The future no one can see  
So step aside and let it be  
Tomorrow may wash away  
Dont put off what you do today  
Take advantage while you are here  
Cause this moment is all there is  
  
Dont live in fear and weakness  
Dont live and hide it all does your  
Your ability to taste the sweetness Sweetness  
And that is what we are here for  
  
Life is real dont you fake it Oh  
The future no one can see  
So step aside and let it be  
Tomorrow may wash away  
Dont put off what you do today  
Take advantage while you are here  
Cause this moment is all there is There is  
  
This moment The future no one can see  
So step aside and just let it be  
Dont wait for tomorrow
