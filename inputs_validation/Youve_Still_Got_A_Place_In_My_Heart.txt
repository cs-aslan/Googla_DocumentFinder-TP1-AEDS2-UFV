If the one youd think is true ever turns his back on you  
Youve still got a place in my heart  
If every road you take proves you made a big mistake  
Baby youve still got a place in my heart  
  
If Im a fool to pray that youll return some day  
Well then Ill know of million fools that love has made that way  
If the years should make you cry dont go on and live a lie  
Baby youve still got a place in my heart  
  
If the years should make you cry
