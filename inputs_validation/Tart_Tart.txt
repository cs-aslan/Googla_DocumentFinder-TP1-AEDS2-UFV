When he came out to the lockup  
He said Im looking for something better  
He made his shock announcement  
And backed off backed down backed off  
  
And then he got up off the floor  
He said Im wealthy enough not to do this no more  
And he made it all known with his hands held up palm out  
  
And she said dont know if I should  
Cause I worry too much about the tests on the blood  
And at first it was a yes and then a no then a yes  
  
A maggot sleeps on her desk  
H wears a sleeping bag as his vest  
And hes getting too too bothered  
About the spots on his chest chest chest  
  
Now TT she laid it on  
And a few days later shes gone  
So its back to the womb  
To get drowned drowned drowned drowned warm
