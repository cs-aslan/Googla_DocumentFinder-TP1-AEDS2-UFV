Ive been watching you now  
Ive been caught in these hours  
Days are turning to nights  
Out of where theres no  
  
No rules for strangers  
When I see you again  
Will you still feel the same way  
Understand  
  
In your eyes  
I cant get nothing right  
All day  
All night  
  
Make it happen  
Make me feel alright  
All day  
All night  
  
Make it happen  
Make me feel alright  
Oh yeah  
When I see you walk by  
  
Turn my head want to break down  
Ive been living alone  
Ive been living a lie  
I get so scared of my fears  
  
Theres a space in my life  
For just one time  
Or baby forever  
Understand  
  
Its in your eyes  
I cant get nothing right  
All day  
All night  
  
Make it happen  
Make me feel alright  
All day  
All night  
  
Make it happen  
Make me feel alright  
Ive been watching you now  
And Ive been living in a daydream  
  
Its that I miss you so  
Cant think of words  
I break down  
Ive been lonely  
  
When I see you again  
Will you still feel the same way  
Understand  
In your eyes  
  
I cant do nothing right  
All day  
All night  
Make it happen  
  
Make me feel alright  
All day  
All night  
Make it happen  
  
Make me feel alright  
All day  
All night  
Make it happen  
  
Make me feel alright  
All day  
Make it happen  
Make me feel alright  
  
All day  
Make it happen
