If you knew Susie like I know Susie  
Oh oh oh what a girl  
Theres none so classy  
As this fair lassie oh oh  
  
Holy Moses what a chassis  
We went riding she didnt balk  
Back from Yonkers  
Im the one that had to walk  
  
If you knew Susie like I know Susie  
Oh oh oh what a girl  
She wears long tresses  
And nice tight dresses oh oh  
  
What a future she possesses  
Out in public how she can yawn  
In a parlor you would think  
The war was on  
  
If you knew Susie like I know Susie  
Oh oh oh what a girl
