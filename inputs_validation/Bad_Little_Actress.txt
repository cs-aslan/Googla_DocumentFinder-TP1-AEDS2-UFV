I cant carry on  
This play is too long  
I must be going  
Extend my regrets  
  
I gave it my best  
But now Im going  
This is too much for me to take  
Something tells me that shes faking it  
  
She says she dont care  
She wants to be fair  
She must be joking  
Its simple she said  
  
Lets not lose our head  
Tell me shes joking  
This is too much for me to take  
But somebody isnt faking  
  
Someones heart is breaking  
And if you see her give her my critique  
Shes a bad little actress  
Gets no curtain call  
  
But the worst of all  
When the curtain falls  
Theres no one at the backstage door  
Im more than her friend  
  
Cause I knew her when  
She was no sensation  
Shes wasting our time  
Repeats all her lines  
  
Whats her motivation  
Now she wont share her stage with me  
Her performance was outrageous  
Put me through some changes  
  
So if you see her give her my critique  
Shes a bad little actress  
Her delivery dont come naturally  
Anyone could see she doesnt mean a word she says  
  
Her mascara ran  
And the show was panned  
But Im still her biggest fan  
So when you see her give her my critique  
  
Shes a bad little actress  
Gets no curtain call  
But the worst of all  
When the curtain falls  
Theres no one at the backstage door
