I had a good life  
Before you came  
I had my friends and my freedom  
I had my name  
Still there was sorrow and emptiness  
Til you made me glad  
Oh in this love I found strength I never knew I had  
  
Chorus  
And this love  
Is like nothing I have ever known  
Take my hand love  
Im taking you home  
Im taking you home  
  
There were days lonely days  
When the world wouldnt throw me a crumb  
But I kept on believing  
That this day would come  
  
Chorus  
  
Where we can be with the ones who really care  
Home where we can grow together  
Keep you in my heart forever  
  
And this love  
Is like nothing I have ever known  
Oh no no baby  
Take my hand love  
Im taking you home  
Taking you home  
  
And this love  
Is like nothing I have ever known  
Oh no baby  
Take my hand  
Im taking you home  
Yes I am  
Im taking you home  
Taking you home baby  
Taking you home
