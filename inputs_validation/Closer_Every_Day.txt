Patrick Simmons  
I just looked in the mirror was that me  
Im older now than I used to be  
The sky above me lord its turnin red  
Theres a hard rain fallin round my head  
Oh lord fallin round my head  
Oh lord fallin round my head  
Oh lord fallin round my head  
Oh lord fallin round my head  
  
The road Im standin on it twists and turns  
The soles of my feet lord theyre bout to burn  
The reaper beckons and he points the way  
Oh lord Im gettin closer every day  
Oh lord closer every day  
Oh lord closer every day  
Oh lord closer every day  
Oh lord closer every day
