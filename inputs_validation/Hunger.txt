Tell you a story  
Bout a friend of mine  
Woke up in this room  
Looked like black and white movies  
No light  
And someone strange in the bed  
She said  
You could be here forever  
Can you feel me  
Im the new disease  
Im like a hunger  
That youve never known  
Do you want me  
Ill take everything  
Im like a hunger  
Lying in your heart  
He made excuses  
Tried to leave the room  
She said  
Im the disease and the cure  
Skin mechanics  
Couldnt help you here  
The nature of need  
Leaves you junk sick and lonely  
Trick it up  
Trick it up good  
She moved  
Like a ghost to the door  
She said  
This is a real love story  
I heard his voice  
And walked in on it all  
She said  
You could be here forever
