Loving Each Other  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
Your eyes are brown  
My eyes are blue  
But that doesnt mean  
That I cant love you  
Youve found a place here in my heart  
So take my hand and we can start  
CHORUS  
Loving each other loving the Lord  
Serving together in one accord  
Theres no young or old here  
Theres no rich or poor  
Loving each other loving the Lord  
Your eyes are brown  
My eyes are blue  
He gave His life for me and for you  
We all have a place here in His heart  
So give me your hand and we will start  
CHORUS  
The colors of the sunset  
Of eyes and of skin  
They were all created to glorify Him  
CHORUS  
Your eyes are brown  
My eyes are blue  
That doesnt mean I cant love you
