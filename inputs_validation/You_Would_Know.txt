Me just happy robot  
Live on hill of beans  
You and I cut from same cloth  
Rippin at the seams  
Cut snip cut  
  
Dont forget to remember  
The devils got pills in his eyes  
Look laugh but dont touch  
Cut you down to size  
Cut up cut shut up  
Cut up cut  
  
You would know  
  
My girls all out of focus  
I aint no big surprise  
Daddy got his gun loaded  
Got cross hairs in his eyes  
Shut up oh  
Shut up oh  
  
You would know  
  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know
