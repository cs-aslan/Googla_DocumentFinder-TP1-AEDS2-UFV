Uh I live it up in these like my last days  
If time is money Im an hour past paid  
Ugh gunpowder in my hourglass  
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag

Im on a natural high but I land perfect  
Some of us are lovers most of yall haters  
But I put up a wall and they just wallpaper  
So love or hate me I stay hatefree  
They say we learn from mistakes well thats why they mistake me  
I got some weight on my shoulders to me its like feathers  
All hail Weezy call it bad weather

Cause life is a movie that Ive seen too many times  
Youre on the outside looking in close the blinds
