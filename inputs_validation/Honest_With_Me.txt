Well Im stranded in the city that never sleeps  
Some of these women they just give me the creeps  
Im avoidin the Southside the best I can  
These memories I got they can strangle a man  
  
Well I came ashore in the dead of the night  
Lot of things can get in the way when youre tryin to do whats right  
You dont understand it  my feelings for you  
Youd be honest with me if only you knew  
  
Im not sorry for nothin Ive done  
Im glad I fought  I only wish wed won  
The Siamese twins are comin to town  
People cant wait  theyre gathered around  
  
When I left my home the sky split open wide  
I never wanted to go back there  Id rather have died  
You dont understand it  my feelings for you  
Youd be honest with me if only you knew  
  
My woman got a face like a teddy bear  
Shes tossin a baseball bat in the air  
The meat is so tough you cant cut it with a sword  
Im crashin my car trunk first into the boards  
  
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice  
Well Ill sell it to ya at a reduced price  
You dont understand it  my feelings for you  
Youd be honest with me if only you knew  
  
Some things are too terrible to be true  
I wont come here no more if it bothers you  
The Southern Pacific leaving at nine fortyfive  
Im having a hard time believin some people were ever alive  
  
Im stark naked but I dont care  
Im going off into the woods Im huntin bare  
You dont understand it  my feelings for you  
Well youd be honest with me if only you knew  
  
Im here to create the new imperial empire  
Im going to do whatever circumstances require  
I care so much for you  didnt think that I could  
I cant tell my heart that youre no good  
  
Well my parents they warned me not to waste my years  
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears  
You dont understand it  my feelings for you  
Well youd be honest with me if only you knew
