Work work work  
Big pile of it and the boss is a jerk  
I just want to disappear  
Wishin I was somewhere other than here  
  
Livin for the weekend  
Jumpin off the deep end  
With just enough money to buy  
A license to chill  
And I believe I will  
  
Let the rat race run roll around in the sun until  
Trouble turns funny songs get sung  
A little bit of money the nights still young  
Leave me alone Ive got a license  
A license to chill  
  
Girls girls girls  
Aint nothin like them in the whole wide world  
So damn smart and cute  
And its amazing what they pass off as a bathing suit  
Winners and losers  
Sailors and cruisers  
Were all qualified for a license to chill  
And I believe I will  
  
Let the rat race run roll around in the sun until  
Trouble turns funny songs get sung  
A little bit of money the nights still young  
Leave me alone Ive got a license  
A license to chill  
  
License to chill  
And I believe I will  
Let the rat race run roll around in the sun until  
Trouble turns funny songs get sung  
One good song will last all night long  
Leave me alone Ive got a license  
A license to chill  
  
A license to chill  
  
Ramos go rent me a coupe Deville  
Hey KL wheres that barbecue grill  
Head on down to Margaritaville  
Have me a cheeseburger with a big pickle dill  
Jesus I sound kinda mentally ill  
I guess I better go turn on Dr Phil
