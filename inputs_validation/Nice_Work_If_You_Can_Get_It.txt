The man who only lives for making money  
Lives a life that isnt necessarily sunny  
Likewise the man who works for fame  
Theres no guarantee that time wont erase his name  
The fact is the only work that really brings enjoyment  
Is the kind that is for girl and boys meant  
Fall in love you wont regret it  
Thats the best work of all if you can get it  
  
Holding hands at midnight  
Neath the starry sky  
Nice work if you can get it  
And you can get it if you try  
Scrolling with the one girl  
Sighing after sigh  
Nice work if you can get it  
And you can get it if you try  
  
Just imagine someone waiting at the cottage door  
Where two hearts become one  
Who could ask for more  
Loving one who loves you  
And taking that vow  
Nice work if you can get it  
And you can get it if  
Wont you tell me how
