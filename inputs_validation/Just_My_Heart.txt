The way I feel when Im in doubt  
Is the way I feel when Im without  
The way you kiss when were alone  
The way you wont pick up your phone  
  
But she works on that garden alone like her father  
All day long all day long  
And I think that shes thinking of me but you know I may be wrong I may be
wrong  
  
Its only just my heart  
Its only just my veins  
Youve been swimming in so long  
Slowly killing all this pain  
  
Dont you know I like the way she makes me laugh out loud  
The way she makes me think about  
The perfect way to turn her on  
The way that I slip off her tongue  
  
But she works on that garden alone like her father  
All day long all day long  
And I think that shes thinking of me but you know  
I may be wrong I may be wrong  
  
Its only just my heart  
Its only just my veins  
Youve been swimming in so long  
Slowly killing all this pain  
But its only just the sun  
That takes away the rain  
Suddenly Im not as sad as yesterday  
Whats left to say when youve said all youve said  
Take down the picture by my bed  
Whats left to bleed when youve bled all youve bled  
I keep on thinking about  
  
The way I feel when Im out of luck  
The way that I cant live without you  
  
Whats left to take when you have nothing left  
You took all the best  
  
Its only just my heart  
Its only just my veins  
Youve been swimming in so long  
Slowly killing all this pain  
But its only just the sun  
That takes away the rain  
Suddenly Im not as mad  
Suddenly Im not as bad  
  
Suddenly Im not as sad as yesterday  
Suddenly Im not as sad as yesterday
