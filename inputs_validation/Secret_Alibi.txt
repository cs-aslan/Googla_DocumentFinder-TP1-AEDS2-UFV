Piece by piece youre tearin me apart  
Give to me and try another start  
Brick by brick you really love this game  
Things from which I cant refrain  
  
So many stories have been told  
I give a damn theyre much too old  
How often will we face the end of our dreams  
When will I see it all come true  
A splendid time for me and you  
Can we expect it bein nice as it seems  
  
Will you be my secret alibi  
Angel of my nights  
Can we do it right  
Lets just try each others love so sweet  
Till we cant deny my secret alibi  
  
Ding by ding can you dig my dong  
It may come short but it might come long  
Limb by limb youre climbing on my tree  
Making things more fun for me  
  
So many stories Ive been told  
I give a damn theyre much too old  
How often will we face the end of our dreams  
When will I see it all come true  
A splendid time for me and you  
Can we expect it being nice as it seems  
  
Will you be my secret alibi  
Angel of my nights  
Can we do it right  
Lets just try each others love so sweet  
Till we cant deny my secret alibi  
  
SOLO  
  
Will you be my secret alibi  
Angel of my nights  
Can we do it right  
Lets just try each others love so sweet  
Till we cant deny my secret alibi
