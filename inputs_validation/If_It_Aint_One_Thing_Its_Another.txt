I got up this morning tried to get off of work  
I couldnt even find not one clean shirt  
There was no hot water when I jumped in the shower  
I know my boss is gonna dock me an hour  
The older I get the more I discover  
If it aint one thing its another  
  
I got the car I tried to get motivated  
Now Im stuck in the traffic all Im doing is waiting  
The fool behind me keeps blowin his horn  
I got my top laid back and its coming up a storm  
The older I get the more I discover  
If it aint one thing its another  
  
Light bill phone bill water and gas  
Pay day comes and it goes so fast  
Theres no way out and Im telling you brother  
If it aint one thing its another  
  
I got to the job and I tried to explain  
The boss said you wont have to do that again  
I called home just to tell her the news  
She said bye bye baby Im leaving you  
She took the kids and shes gone to her mothers  
If it aint one thing its another  
  
Light bill phone bill water and gas  
Pay day comes and it goes so fast  
Theres no way out and Im telling you brother  
If it aint one thing its another  
If it aint one thing its another
