You hit the street you feel them staring  
You know they hate you you can feel their eyes a glarin  
Because youre different because youre free  
Because youre everything deep down they wish they could be  
Chorus  
Youre lookin back lookin back theyre lookin back lookin back  
Too many people lookin back  
Youre lookin back lookin back theyre lookin back lookin back  
Too many people lookin back  
They watch the news see young men dying  
They watch them bleedin and listen to them lyin  
And if theyre normal if they can see  
They just reach out and change the channel on the TV  
Chorus  
When they could vote and end the war  
Theyre much too busy fittin locks upon the back door  
Give you a foxhole a place to hide  
Cause when the war come the copsll be on their side  
Chorus
