Lets put a new coat of paint  
On this lonesome old town  
Set em up well be knockin em down  
You wear a dress  
Baby Ill a tie  
Well laugh at that old bloodshot moon  
In that burgundy sky  
  
All our scribbled love dreams are lost or thrown away  
Here amidst the shuffle of an overflowin day  
Our love needs a transfusion lets shoot it full of wine  
Fishin for a good time starts with throwin in your line  
  
So lets put a new coat of paint  
On this lonesome old town  
Set em up set em up well be knockin em down  
You wear a dress baby  
Ill wear a tie  
Well laugh at that old bloodshot moon  
In that burgundy sky
