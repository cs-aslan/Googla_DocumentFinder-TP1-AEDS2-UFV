I never said that every choice I made everyone was gonna like  
I never said that satisfying the masses was how I would live my life  
I never once did I say all of my decisions would be right  
I never said I would ignore my heart and listen with just my mind  
  
Hmm and I know it looks like Ive gone crazy  
But in the way of love and what it does Ill be crazy for us  
  
So call me a fool call me insane
