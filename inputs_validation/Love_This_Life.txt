Seal my fate  
I get your tongue in the mail  
Noone is wise  
Until they see how it lies  
Love this life  
Dont wait till the next one comes  
Pedal my faith  
The wheels are still turning round turn round  
And maybe the day will come  
When youll never have to feel no pain  
After all my complaining  
Gonna love this life  
Gonna love this life  
And so they threw you in jail  
Whatever youve done  
It was a million to one  
And dont you just love this life  
When its holding you down  
Pedal my faith  
The wheels are still turning round turn round  
And maybe the day will come  
When youll never have to feel no pain  
After all my complaining  
Gonna love this life  
Gonna love this life  
Theres something that you can do  
Even if you think that I hate you  
Stop your complaining leave me defenseless  
When you love this life  
Gotta love this life  
Love this life though youll never know why  
Gonna love this life  
Gonna love
