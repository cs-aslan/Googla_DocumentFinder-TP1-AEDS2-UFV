You belong  
To somebody else and not to me  
Right or wrong  
Thats not the way that its going to be  
I want you so much inside  
Im throwing away all my conscience and pride and  
  
Ill try anything to get you  
Ill do anything I can  
Ill try anything to get you  
Ill cheat and Ill lie  
And Ill try til I die  
Till I make you my man  
Going to make you my man  
  
Ive been burned  
Whenever Ive followed all the rules  
So Ive learned  
That playing it fair is just for fools  
Im fighting and win or lose  
Im not minding my Ps and Qs and  
  
Ill try anything to get you  
Ill do anything I can  
Ill try anything to get you  
Ill cheat and Ill lie  
Try til I die  
Till I make you my man  
My man hey ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
I want you so much inside  
Im throwing away all my conscience and pride and  
  
Ill try anything to get you  
Ill do anything I can  
Ill try anything to get you  
Ill cheat and Ill lie  
Try til I die  
Till I make you my man  
Going to make you my man  
Going to make you my man yeah  
Make you my man  
Going to fight til I die  
Going to cheat and lie
