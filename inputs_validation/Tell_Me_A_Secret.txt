I got 5 kisses where you want em at  
Either one on your lips  
Your ear your neck  
Your stomach or your back  
  
Your inner thigh right on your knee cap  
Or your belly button  
These other guys be out here talkin  
But they steady frontin  
  
They dont know what they want  
Thats why I tell you put your trust in me  
Share all your secrets  
Your desires and your fantasies  
  
I aint gon tell nobody baby  
Im an only child  
Id keep it to myself  
Cause all I wanna do is see you smile  
  
Knowin that you got someone to talk to  
Aint that what you want  
Ill be your lover  
Your provider and your confidante  
  
And I wont judge you  
Cause I know that aint nobody perfect  
But you got some perfect imperfections  
And that makes you worth it  
  
I wanna see your body in all  
The positions that you like it in  
We could do it slow or have some drinks  
And it gets enticin when  
  
You like it rough I give it rough  
And I start to pull your hair  
Cause ecstasys your destination  
And Imma take you there  
Tell me a secret baby  
  
Tell me somethin that nobody else knows  
And Ill think about it just soon as the door closes  
Tell me a secret baby  
Tell tell tell me a secret baby  
  
Show me somethin that nobody else sees  
Tell me all the things that you would do if it was you and me  
Tell me a secret baby  
Tell tell tell me a secret baby  
  
There aint nobody in the universe  
That competes with you  
Imagine the possibilities  
And other little freaky thangs that we could do  
  
Blind folded handcuffed to the head board  
Never let you go until you scream my name  
Maybe you think Im playin  
But this is really far from a motherfuckin game  
  
Aint a damn thang changed  
Still nasty as I wanna be  
And I got just what you been lookin for  
Babygirl you want it see  
  
Itll turn you on and its gonna be on  
Soon as I take it off  
Just give me your body its guaranteed that  
Imma break it off  
  
Off off off  
Off until the sun rise  
And Im not here to disappoint  
Just give me one try  
  
One kiss one pinch  
And you could take it or leave it  
But before you make up your mind  
Just tell me one secret  
NeYo holla at em  
  
Tell me somethin that nobody else knows  
And Ill think about it just soon as the door closes  
Tell me a secret baby  
Tell tell tell me a secret baby  
  
Show me somethin that nobody else sees  
Tell me all the things that you would do if it was you and me  
Tell me a secret baby
