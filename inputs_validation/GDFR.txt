Verse 1 Flo Rida  
Your girl just kissed a girl  
I do bi chicks  
Shake for a sheik  
Im throwing these Emirates in the sky  
Spending this Assalamu alaykum  
Peace to MONEY  
I love my beaches south beaches  
Surfboard in high tide  
I could just roll up  
Cause Im swole up  
So that birthday cake get the cobra  
Bugatti for real Im cold bruh  
That autobiography rover  
Got the key to my city its over  
Its no thots only Anna Kournikovas  
I set records ratchets hold up  
I set records ratchets hold up

Girls get wetter than Katrina

We the plus your man a minus  
My team blowing on that slam  
Make you coughcough thats Bronchitis  
Put your hands up

Get that ass on the floor

Double entendre double entendre  
While youre hating I get money  
Then I double up tonkers
