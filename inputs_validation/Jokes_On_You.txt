You niggas are comical who me

They looking at a pimp funny Im Katt Williams

And some say Im wildn out  
Bacardi styling out pushing seven digits dialing  
But I aint gotta fucking choice  
My money talks in a Chris Tucker voice

You a stand up rapper hip hop comedian  
I start laughing as soon as I put your cd in  
You joke you joke you kid you kid  
Should have went to comedy central with the vids you did  
But OK you bet only if its comic view  
Promise you Im funny style I can be a comic too

Verse Pusha ts  
The jokes on you niggas  
See the figures dont add up to the claims  
You Sam Kinnison you just screaming names  
My brother my partner for real like the wayans  
Plus everything in live in living color  
High rise checks diamonds the size of Robin Harris  
I Bebe kids my neck  
You call it a tribute a proof that I distribute  
Sales was slow I got Paco to contribute  
Some morals in each state move weight get caught dont talk Dave Chappelle
niggas might break  
So hilarious how the chariots carry us  
Phantom is light gray sort of like ashy Larry is  
King of the one liner lil rhymers watch what you say  
You just a potty mouth like Andrew dice clay  
I pop collars on niggas I drop dollars on niggas  
I jell os together I bill Cosby on niggas  
Got you lost in the smoke I Micheal Connelly you niggas  
I watch u verse from the fire I Richard Pryor you niggas  
Said enough nigga sort of like Kramer  
Im joking you dont wanna see the anger Fab tellem  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 2 Fabolous  
Mane look the diamonds in your chain look  
Funnier than Dane Cook you hit the Sufi  
I am to fly in the booth I  
Make joke of them I aint the richest nigga but I aint broke as them  
Im serious petty worth will make a man delirious like Eddie Murph  
Girls get curious  
Is he really funny dont be silly honey  
Im the burner packing  
Bernie macing  
I aint scared of you mafuckers kick ass  
Hon stack thick ass  
A deck of card vip section hard  
They try to holla at me you know the heckler broads  
Im popping rose I dont the neck to god  
Dont front yo I be in the front row  
Watch your wise cracks or Ill be at your front door  
And I push up on a female smoothly in a GL but keep that on the DL Hughley  
Lol this is Los  
Oh no your money coming so slow guess this mafuckers a no show oh oh oh  
  
Chorus
