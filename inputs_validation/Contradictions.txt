Seventeen years in a dead end job  
Telling his dreams to a deafeared god  
Hanging on tight by a single thread  
Praying for a change  
Everything you couldve sacrificed  
Your flesh and blood had its own sweet price  
Babys all grown up and moved away  
Wheres that leave you now  
It was your own decision  
You made my life a mission  
Somebody tell me  
It doesnt make any sense at all  
Somebody tell me  
Why were living in a world of contradiction  
Somebody tell me  
It doesnt make any sense at all  
Somebody tell me  
Why were living in a world of contradiction  
Working so hard to be understood  
Doing so much for the common good  
Sorry if I didnt see the truth  
The sadness in your eyes  
I wanted to stand on my own two feet  
Looking at life as a oneway street  
Thinking that I had all worked out  
Wheres that leave me now  
We lost communication  
Too many expectations  
Somebody tell me  
It doesnt make any sense at all  
Somebody tell me  
Why were living in a world of contradiction  
Somebody tell me  
It doesnt make any sense at all  
Somebody tell me  
Why were living in a world of contradiction  
Everything I have inside  
I kept it wrapped up tight  
All I know is  
All I want to know is  
Somebody tell me  
Somebody tell me  
It doesnt make any sense at all  
Somebody tell me  
Why were living in a world of contradiction  
In a world of contradiction  
Seventeen years in a dead end job  
Telling his dreams to a deafeared god  
Hanging on tight by a single thread  
Wheres that leave you now
