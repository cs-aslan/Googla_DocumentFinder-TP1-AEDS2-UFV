I know the world is a mess  
I like the patterns on your dress  
Would you have a drink with me please  
Have a couple or three  
I see you walk by  
I dont speak but try  
Have a drink with me please  
Dont say anything  
I look like a mess  
The patterns of your dress  
They blind me  
  
Heres to the rest of the world  
I guess that you deserve something  
You work so hard at  
Trying to be just like everyone else  
Except people like me  
  
Well the lights shining down onto the street  
The city lingers as it overheats  
Im on idle right now  
Dont feel so proud  
Wait for the others to join the crowd  
  
And they come  
Ones  
Threes  
Heres to the rest of the world  
Oh I dont know  
Heres something that you deserve  
A drink or two  
Come on and sit down with me  
And well pretend everything  
Well pretend everything  
Its easy
