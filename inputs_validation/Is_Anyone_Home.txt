Talking in my sleep next to no one  
Never never say never again  
I cant rise and shine  
No I wont even try  
  
My rainy windows are crying crying  
Shoulda woulda coulda been  
Like it shoulda been  
A contender like Marlon Brando  
  
Eani Meani Minei Mo  
Caught a virus wont let go  
Been down so long it looks like up to me  
Im so lonely I can almost taste it  
  
In a perfect world Id just be wasted  
Send me an angel wrap me in her wings  
Hello Hello Hello  
Is anyone home  
  
Well people love to talk  
When I can hardly walk  
To them Im probably just the News at Eleven  
Its the edge of night  
  
As the world turns  
Misunderstood its just the wrong medication  
I wish I wish upon a star  
I wish it hadnt gone this far  
  
Been up so long it looks like down to me  
Im so lonely I can almost taste it  
In a perfect world Id just be wasted  
Send me an angel wrap me in her wings  
  
Hello Hello Hello  
Is anyone home  
Hello Hello  
Im really really wasted  
  
I live in a big doll house  
And nobodys home  
Just me and my mouse  
I live in a big dark house  
  
And nobodys home  
Just me and my mouse  
Im so lonely I can almost taste it  
In a perfect world Id just be wasted  
  
Send an angel my own little angel  
Hello Hello  
Is anyone home  
Is anyone home  
  
Hello Hello  
Is anyone home  
Hello Hello Hello  
Is anyone home  
  
Hello Hello

Hello Hello Hello
