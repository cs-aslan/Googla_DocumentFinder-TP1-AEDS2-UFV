Meet me in a restaurant  
Meet me on the top of the world  
Meet me and well talk the language of love  
  
Ill meet you anywhere you want  
Ill meet you on a ballroom floor  
Meet me and well float to a level above  
  
I wish youd drop what youre doing  
And get on the case  
We could blow this existence  
Right out into space  
And share a sweet isolation  
Lets go there today  
Go today go today  
Everyway rightaway  
Oh lets go  
  
Lets go baby lets go baby come on  
Lets go baby lets go baby come on  
Lets go baby lets go baby come on  
Lets go cause we cant hold back no more  
Theres no way theres no way  
No no way  
  
Meet you on a mountain top  
Meet you at the end of the block  
As long as we can talk the language of love  
  
Ill take you in my arms again  
Ill take you to the edge of time  
Together we can reach for the heavens above  
  
I wish youd drop what youre doing  
And get on the case  
We could blow this existence  
Right out into space  
And share a sweet isolation  
Lets go there today  
Go today go today  
Everyway rightaway  
Oh lets go  
  
Lets go baby lets go baby come on  
Cause baby I want your love  
Lets go baby lets go baby come on  
Cause baby Im saying  
Take your cue from me now  
Im saying baby lets go  
Will you listen to me  
Im saying baby come on now  
Lets go cause we cant hold back no more  
Theres no way  
  
Meet me on the dance floor and well dance to the rhythm  
Get you feet in motion and well dance to the rhythm  
Dance to the rhythm  
Dance to the rhythm of love  
  
Ohbaby  
Lets go baby lets go baby come on  
Cause baby I want your love

Lets go cause we cant hold back no  
Lets go cause we cant hold back no more
