Theres noone coming with that freedom train  
Theres nowhere you can go where you feel no pain  
Take the blinkers off you eyes  
The power is in your hand  
Stop waiting for your ticket to the promised land  
There aint no heaven and there aint no hell  
Except the one were in and you know to well  
Theres noone waiting on  
Waiting on a higher high  
Dont let the only world youre ever gonna live in pass you by

And the rhythm a no partial go deh  
Seh the rhythm a the marshall

Gone in the blues
