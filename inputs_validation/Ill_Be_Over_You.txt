Some people live their dreams  
Some people close their eyes  
Some peoples destiny  
Passes by  
  
There are no guarantees  
There are no alibis  
Thats how our love must be  
Dont ask why  
  
It takes some time  
God knows how long  
I know that I can forget you  
  
As soon as my heart stops breakin  
Anticipating  
As soon as forever is through  
Ill be over you  
  
Remembering times gone by  
Promises we once made  
What are the reasons why  
Nothing stays the same  
  
There were the nights holding you close  
Someday Ill try to forget them  
Someday Ill be over you
