Tonight Im burning old love letters  
Photographs and memories of you  
Hoping somehow Ill feel better  
And that when the smoke is gone I wont want you  
  
Burning memories  
Teardrops fall while I am  
Burning memories  
Burning all the memories of you that I cant lose  
  
My heart to you no longer matters  
And I cant live alone with memories  
Into the fire those dreams that youve shattered  
And when the smoke is gone then Ill be free  
  
Burning memories  
Teardrops fall while I am  
Burning memories  
Burning all the memories of you that I cant lose
