Well I got a problem  
And it just wont wait  
Ive been getting on one  
With the man who guards your gate  
When he says youre sleeping  
In your hideaway  
It is what hes keeping back  
That gives your game away  
Come quit your crazy lowdown ways  
Youre walking astray  
Come quit your weary worn out ways  
Youre walking astray  
And Id like to say that I like this  
More than I do today  
Yes I got a problem  
Like youve never seen  
Ive been getting bothered  
By the man who locks your screen  
When he says youre hiding  
And in your room youll stay  
It is what hes holding back  
That says what he cant say  
Come quit your crazy lowdown ways  
Youre walking astray  
Come quit your weary worn out ways  
Youre walking astray  
And Id like to say that I like this  
More than I do today  
Im just a lazy man  
Who has to hear the truth  
And I hear whats true from you  
Come quit your crazy lowdown ways  
Youre walking astray  
Come quit your weary worn out ways  
Youre walking astray  
And Id like to say that I like this  
More than I do today
