Watch how I put it on  
Kitty collar tight  
Make it sing its song  
Make it fight  
Make it fight fight  
Watch how I put it on  
Kitty collar tight  
Make it sing its song  
Make it fight  
Make it fight fight  
I hold your history  
And I kiss the map  
Im looking back forwards  
Your tap drips i Catch  
Watch how I put it on  
Kitty collar tight  
Make it sing its song  
Make it fight  
Make it fight fight  
Watch how I put it on  
Kitty collar tight  
Make it sing its song  
Make it fight  
Make it fight fight  
Your skin my nails  
Your mirror my face  
Your skin impaled  
For your scars are my grace  
Watch how I put it on  
Kitty collar tight  
Make it sing its song  
Make it fight  
Make it fight fight  
Watch how I put it on  
Kitty collar tight  
Make it sing its song  
Make it fight  
Make it fight fight  
Watch how I put it on  
Kitty collar tight  
Make it sing its song  
Make it fight  
Make it fight fight  
Make it fight  
Make it fight fight  
Make it fight  
Make it fight fight  
Make it fight  
Make it fight fight  
Make it fight  
Make it fight fight
