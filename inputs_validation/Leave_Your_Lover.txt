Verse 1  
I dont have much to give but I dont care for gold  
What use is money when you need someone to hold  
Dont have direction Im just rolling down this road  
Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold  
  
PreChorus  
Youll never know the endless nights  
The rhyming of the rain  
Or how it feels to fall behind  
And watch you call his name  
  
Chorus  
Pack up and leave everything  
Dont you see what I can bring  
Cant keep this beating heart at bay  
Set my midnight terror free and I will give you all of me  
Just leave your lover leave him for me  
Leave your lover Leave him for me  
  
Verse 2  
We sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old  
Im in love with you and you will never know  
But if I cant have you Ill walk this life alone  
Spare you the rising storms and let the river flow  
  
PreChorus  
Youll never know the endless nights  
The rhyming of the rain  
Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name  
  
Chorus  
Pack up and leave everything  
Dont you see what I can bring  
Cant keep this beating heart at bay  
Set my midnight terror free and I will give you all of me  
Leave your lover leave him for me  
Leave your lover leave him for me
