Burn the witches burn the witches  
Dont take time to sew your your stitches  
Burn the witches burn the witches  
Good is the thing that you favor evil is your sour flavor  
You cannot sedate all the things you hate  
Burn your bridges burn your bridges  
Dont take time to sew your stitches  
Burn your bridges burn your bridges  
Good is the thing that you favor evil is your sour flavor  
I dont need your hate I decide my fate  
You cannot sedate all the things you rape
