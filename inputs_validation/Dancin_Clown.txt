No you couldnt call Jesse a babe in the woods  
Hes just weak in selfdefense  
Cause hes so thin skinned  
He cant take a joke at his expense  
Youre a push down window says Rowdy Yates  
I can run you up and down  
Anytime I want  
I can make you my dancin  
My dancin clown  
Youre my dancin clown  
Dancin dancin  
My dancin clown  
Dancin  
Youre my dancin clown  
Dancin dancin dancin  
My dancin clown  
  
Rowdy Yates is as bold as Jove  
Hes all chide and snide and bluff  
Stuck in the romantic tradition  
Of acting rough and tough  
Youre always charging through says Jesse  
Nervous lookin all around  
To see whos seein him bein a dancin  
A dancin clown  
Hes a dancin clown  
Dancin dancin  
A dancin clown  
Dancin  
Hes a dancin clown  
Dancin dancin dancin  
A dancin clown  
  
Cherchez la femme  
Whenever love comes around  
Someones a dancin clown  
Cherchez la femme  
Whenever hearts start to pound  
Someones a dancin clown  
  
Down the street comes lastword Suzie  
Shes high yellow lookin top nice  
You hear the swoosh of jungle blades  
And the crackle of northern ice  
Hot damn says Rowdy lookin up  
Yum says Jesse lookin down  
How would you like to be her dancin  
Her dancin clown  
Be her dancin clown  
Dancin dancin  
Her dancin clown  
Dancin  
Be her dancin clown  
Dancin dancin dancin  
Her dancin clown  
  
Cherchez la femme  
Whenever love comes to town  
Someones a dancin clown  
Cherchez la femme  
Wherever hearts start to pound  
Someones a dancin clown
