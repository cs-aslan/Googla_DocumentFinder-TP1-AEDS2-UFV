Spiders in the night  
Creeping round the walls  
Now youll feel him  
Crawling over you  
  
Creepy crawly things  
Filling up your bed  
Soon youll feel him  
Crawling through your brains  
  
You think hes there  
Beware his bite  
But when you look  
The spiders not in sight  
  
Spiders reappear  
Taking peoples names  
Everything is taken down insane  
  
Theres no way out  
And theres no key  
But heres a clue  
The spiders really me  
  
Youre written in his book  
The spider wont forget  
You wont forget  
The spiders in the night  
  
The end is going night  
Itsy bitsy friends  
The spiders disappearing from the night  
  
You think hes gone  
You think hes dead  
Theres no escape  
The spiders in your head  
  
All the spiders in the night Repeat x 3
