Baby I dont want to spend my life on trial  
For something that I did not do  
And maybe if you stopped and looked around some time  
I wouldnt pass right by you  
  
Maybe its because you are so insecure  
Maybe your plain dont care  
Maybe its the chase that really gets me off  
I fall so when its just not there  
  
Burn another bridge break another heart  
Try again it will only fall apart  
  
Infatuation  
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me  
Its such a shame that you shot me down  
It would have been nice to be around  
Im touching your skin  
If its only a fantasy then why is it killing me  
I guess this must be infatuation I want it  
  
Try to put my finger on what burns me up  
It always seems to escape me  
And when you have decided that youve had enough  
Just tell me where I need to be  
  
Now her face is something that I never had  
To ever deal with before  
She left me with the feeling that shed had enough  
And Im the one wanting more  
  
Burn another bridge break another heart  
Try again it will only fall apart  
  
Infatuation  
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me  
Its such a shame that you shot me down  
It would have been nice to be around  
Im touching your skin  
If its only a fantasy then why is it killing me  
I guess this must be infatuation I want it  
  
Im so attracted to you  
The feelings mutual too  
And I get scared the moment you leave  
Get so hot I forget to breathe yeah  
  
Infatuation  
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me  
Its such a shame that you shot me down  
It would have been nice to be around  
Im touching your skin  
If its only a fantasy then why is it killing me  
I guess this must be infatuation I want it  
  
Oh I want it  
Oh I want it  
Yeah I want it
