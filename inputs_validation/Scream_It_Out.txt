Verse 1  
I think Ill let fate just take me home  
Because over pain love is outgrown  
Ive never won a fight to understand  
I just move as my heart commands  
  
PreChorus  
Ive always had a thing for silence  
But lately I just need a voice I recognise  
Baby its perfect timing now to  
  
Chorus  
Scream it out out  
I wont let you down down  
So scream it out out  
I wont let you down down  
  
Verse 2  
Have you found peace with your mistakes  
Breathing on the glass as it breaks  
Have you found the words to save her  
And keep your heart out of danger  
  
PreChorus  
Ive always had a thing for silence  
But lately I just need a voice I recognise  
Baby its perfect timing now to  
  
Chorus  
Scream it out out  
I wont let you down down  
So scream it out out  
I wont let you down down  
  
PreChorus  
Ive always had a thing for silence  
But lately I just need a voice I recognise  
Baby its perfect timing now to  
  
Chorus  
Scream it out out  
I wont let you down down  
So scream it out out  
I wont let you down down
