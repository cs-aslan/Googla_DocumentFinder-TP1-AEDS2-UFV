Said you came from a Mining Town  
Til they closed the mining down  
Said your daddy was a drinker  
He had a picture of Jesus on his sinker  
  
Maybe I  
Maybe Im coming for you tonight  
This towns only five miles wide  
Look everywhere theres a road sign  
  
Pawn shops and places to hide  
And cops sit around hungry  
Waiting to dine  
Maybe I  
  
Maybe Im coming for you tonight  
Maybe I  
Maybe Im coming for you tonight  
Said you came from a Mining Town  
  
Til they closed the mining down  
Said your momma was a drinker  
She had a picture of Jesus on her sink  
And Maybe I  
  
Maybe Im coming for you tonight  
Maybe I  
Maybe Im coming for you tonight  
Maybe I  
  
Maybe Im coming for you tonight
