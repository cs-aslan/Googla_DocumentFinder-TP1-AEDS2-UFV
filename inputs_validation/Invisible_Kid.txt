Invisible kid  
Never see what he did  
Got stuck where he hid  
Fallen through the grid  
  
Invisible kid  
Got a place of his own  
Where hell never be known  
Inward hes grown  
  
Invisible kid  
Locked away in his brain  
From the shame and the pain  
World down the drain  
  
Invisible kid  
Suspicious of your touch  
Dont want no crutch  
But its all too much  
  
I hide inside  
I hurt inside  
I hide inside  
But Ill show you  
  
Im ok just go away  
Into distance let me fade  
Im ok just go away  
Im ok but please dont stray too far  
  
Open your heart  
Im beating right here  
Open your mind  
Im being right here right now x2

Oooh what a good boy you are  
Out of the way and youre kept to yourself  
Oooh cant you see that hes not here  
He doesnt want the attention you give  
Oooh unplugging from it all  
Invisible kid floats alone in his room  
Oooh what a quiet boy you are  
He looks so calm floating round and around in himself
