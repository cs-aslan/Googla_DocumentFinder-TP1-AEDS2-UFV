Im holding on your rope  
Got me ten feet off the ground  
And Im hearing what you say  
But I just cant make a sound  
  
You tell me that you need me  
Then you go and cut me down but wait  
You tell me that youre sorry  
Didnt think Id turn around and say  
  
That its too late to apologize its too late  
I said its too late to apologize its too late  
Too late oh  
  
Id take another chance take a fall  
Take a shot for you  
And I need you like a heart needs a beat  
But its nothing new yeah yeah  
  
I loved you with a fire red now its turning blue  
And you say sorry like the angel  
Heaven let me think was you  
But Im afraid  
  
Its too late to apologize its too late  
I said its too late to apologize its too late whoa whoa  
  
Its too late to apologize its too late  
I said its too late to apologize its too late  
  
I said its too late to apologize yeah too late  
I said its too late to apologize yeah too late  
  
Im holding on your rope  
Got me ten feet off the ground
