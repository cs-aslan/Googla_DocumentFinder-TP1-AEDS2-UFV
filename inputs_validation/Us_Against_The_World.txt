What do you need to get high for  
When your babys so die for  
Quit your job lets make a ride for it  
  
If you want it supersize  
I can do that for you  
If you want it double fries  
I can do that for you  
  
If you wanna good surprise  
I can do that for you  
If you wont believe your eyes  
I can do that for you  
  
What do you need to get high for  
When your babys so die for  
Quit your job lets make a ride for  
Its us against the world  
  
If you want a cola  
I can make it colder  
If you want a bad girl  
Nobodys bolder  
And if you want the Queen  
Of New York then you  
Better call me call me  
  
If you want some dirty lies  
I can do that for you  
Watch me dance for other guys  
I can do that for you  
  
Tell you everythins alright

Never ever leave your side  
I can do that for you

There aint no reason to cry for  
Quit your job lets make a life

If you want a bad girl  
Nobodys bolder  
And if you want the Queen  
Of New York then you  
Better call me call me

Buy me Coca Cola  
In the middle  
Of the night
