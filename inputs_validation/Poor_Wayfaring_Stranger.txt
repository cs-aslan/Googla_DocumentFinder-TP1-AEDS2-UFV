I am a poor wayfaring stranger  
Wandering oer this world of woe  
And theres no sickness toil or danger  
In that bright land to which I go  
Im going home to see my father  
Im going home no more to roam  
Im only going over Jordan  
Im only going over home  
I know dark clouds will gather round me  
I know my way is rough and steep  
But beautious fields lie just before me  
Where men redeemed their vigils keep  
Im going home to see my mother  
Im going there no more to roam  
Im only going over Jordan  
Im only going over home
