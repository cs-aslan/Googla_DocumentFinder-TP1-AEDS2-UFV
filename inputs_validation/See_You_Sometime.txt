Where are you now  
Are you in some hotel room  
Does it have a view  
Are you caught in a crowd  
Or holding some honey  
Who came on to you  
Why do you have to be so jive  
OK hang up the phone  
It hurts  
But something survives  
Though its undermined  
Id still like to see you sometime  
  
Im feeling so good  
And my friends all tell me  
That Im looking fine  
I run in the woods  
I spring from the boulders  
Like a mama lion  
Im not ready to  
Change my name again  
But you know Im not after  
A piece of your fortune  
And your fame  
Cause I tasted mine  
Id just like to see you sometime  
  
Pack your suspenders  
Ill come meet your plane  
No need to surrender  
I just want to see you again  
  
Were in for more rain  
I could sure use some sunshine on my apple trees  
It seems such a shame  
We start out so kind and end so heartlessly  
I couldnt take them all on then  
With a heedful of questions and hypes  
So when the hopes got so slim  
I just resigned  
But Id still like to see you sometime  
Id sure like to see you
