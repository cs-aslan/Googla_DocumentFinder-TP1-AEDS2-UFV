Wyclef Yo Serj pass me that lighter  
Serj Here you go man  
  
Yeah yeah  
  
Both Yeah  
  
Serj The power is smiling through the battle field  
  
The break is over man  
Im fat with the ink pen  
Like Ali Boom Bayay  
Okay Im on my second wind  
Used to roll dice when the love was on my side man  
Four five six walked away with the Grammy  
Seen many blocks turn to the Twilight Zone  
DA on a case like Sherlock Holmes  
My old high school sweetheart started sniffin a bone  
For the right bag she deep blow deeper than the baritone  
I caught you off guard this verse is unexpected  
Check it  
Like when I rhyme dont big punch wreck it  
Check it  
I got a swagger that cut any rapper mind over matter  
Lyrical dagger like alcohol I got pull your liver  
  
Quiver shiver body temperature can found in Hudson River  
Deliver a message to your miss you wont be commin over  
And if you on a street tonight  
See that refugee local  
We beam around the world like satellite  
  
Chorus 1  
Its the hip hop boys turn your radio down  
Its the rock and roll boys turn your radio down  
Its the reggae boys turn your radio down  
Neighbors mind your business  
  
Chorus 2  
Its a riot Trouble comin again your bodys getting nervous  
See were trouble comin again body so unconscious  
You see were trouble comin again your bodys getting nervous  
See were trouble comin again body so unconscious  
  
Sizzla  
Come rock with me  
I got the music on the block with me  
Come chill on the spot with me  
  
Im just laughin spree  
  
Yeah youre right we got enough for everyone  
So get all your friends and your families and come along  
Move to the beat thats all we do  
We got Jerusalem  
Everyday we offer praises like King Soloman  
  
Dont be nervous  
Im your guardian angel I know youre nervous  
And if I look at you now  
If I should make it  
Believe me  
I leave you show you how to make it  
  
Pump up high  
N M I  
Double S  I  
S  S  I  
P  P  I  
Three peace child  
Want to see me die  
So the heavens get cry  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Its a riot  
Riot  
Riot  
Riot  
From the train to the plane  
Security check  
From the bridge to the tunnel  
Security check  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Wyclef Serj  
Lets go to Texas  
Driving wreckless  
Police stop me  
Ask me for my license  
Oh yeah  
Registration so I played him some Elvis  
He let me go  
Then I lit on the challas  
I said if things dont change  
We headed for the Armageddon  
Armageddon  
And the great dragon with seven heads ten horns  
At the Armageddon  
Listen to the choired church  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Serj  
The matterings of all matter  
Masters and their extended batters  
Internet intelligence firm  
Investments for the natural world  
Their divestments  
Truth is knowledge  
Although bipolar if its attainment is equitable  
Mans mirrors face the flesh  
But hide the spirit  
In opposite worlds  
Vision can only be attained universally  
Lamps of varied sizes and shapes carrying different shades  
All having the propensity to illuminate  
Lets ruminate on realization  
That the means is the end  
The earths water is mirroring the stream of consciousness  
The dead being reborn  
As flowers smiling through the battlefields  
  
Its the hip hop boys turn your radio down  
Its the rock and roll boys turn your radio down  
  
Serj Power is smiling through the battle field  
  
Chorus 2
