Once more the pain is thrown my way  
Cant she stay away  
Every single time  
Shes fucking with my mind  
Built up all this rage  
Im trapped inside some cage  
While she sits and smiles  
Layla  
Layla  
Once more incomprehensible face  
Why am I the one to blame  
Every single time  
Shes screwing up my mind  
A pest in a locked up cage  
In your life born and aged  
Why cant I stand up and just say good bye  
Layla  
Layla  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage  
Once more pain is thrown my way  
Cant she stay away  
Every single time  
Shes fucking with my mind  
Built up all this rage  
Trapped inside some cage  
Lifes not meant this way  
Layla  
Layla  
Inside Im afraid  
Afraid of who I am  
Cant you even feel  
Youve taken who I am  
I have fought to find a way  
I am afraid  
To feel who I am  
Fuck  
Layla  
Layla  
Thats why I cry  
This lie I drown
