Dont mind me  
Im half crazy about you  
I dont mean to doubt you  
But ooh I got an anxious heart  
  
You been gone so damn long  
That it seems  
Ive fallen for a bad dream  
I guess I got an anxious heart  
  
Ooohh put me away  
Tell me I dont deserve you  
But you aint got the nerve too  
Oh wooh wooh  
  
I dont mind the times  
You lied its alright  
Just come home to me tonight  
Take away my anxious heart  
  
Ooh ooh  
  
Ooohhh put me away  
Tell me I dont deserve you ah  
You aint got the nerve too  
Oh wooh wooh  
  
I dont mind the times  
You lied its alright  
Just come home to me tonight  
And take away my anxious heart take away  
Take away my anxious heart take away  
Please take away my anxious heart take away  
Baby take away my anxious heart take away  
Ooohh  
Take away my anxious heart  
Take away  
Take away
