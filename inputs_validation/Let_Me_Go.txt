Well some wear their feelings right on their sleeve  
And some want to feel whats inside of me  
But Ive been here twice before oh  
Ive been here twice before  
And I notice you  
Spy satellite snapping shots from the skylight  
Endo you know buffers up to a highlight  
Ink to the skin tight burned in the sunlight  
If present lived hindsight you would be dynamite  
Butterfly crucify yourself straight gemini  
Checking out grey clouds burning out blue skies  
Even high tides rail slides break for landslides  
Just another ride got shot goodbye side  
Dont let me go  
I know Im always late to see you  
I cant wait to see you again and  
Dont let me go  
I know Im always late to see you  
I cant wait to see you here again

You wanted something different  
You confused the lines  
And now youre trying youre trying to make this  
Better cause you know you cant rewind  
Cant go back if thats what youre doing  
Cause everything looks dope in slow motion  
But you got taxed in all the commotion  
Then you got waxed for all your devotion  
Floating in space  
No locomotion
