Young teacher the subject  
Of schoolgirl fantasy  
She wants him so badly  
Knows what she wants to be  
Inside him theres gnawing  
This girls an open page  
Book marking  shes so close now  
This girl is half his age  
  
Dont stand dont stand so  
Dont stand so close to me  
  
Her friends are so jealous  
You know how bad girls get  
Sometimes its not so easy  
To be the teachers pet  
Temptation frustration  
So bad it makes him cry  
Wet bus stop shes waiting  
His car is warm and dry  
  
Dont stand dont stand so  
Dont stand so close to me  
  
Loose talk in the classroom  
To hurt they try and try  
Strong words in the staffroom  
The accusations fly  
Its no use he sees her  
He starts to shake and cough  
Just like the old man in  
That book by Nabakov  
  
Dont stand dont stand so  
Dont stand so close to me  
  
Dont stand dont stand so  
Dont stand so close to me
