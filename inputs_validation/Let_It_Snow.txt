Let is snow let is snow  
  
The weather outside is frightful  
The fire is so delightful  
Weve got no place to go  
Let it snow let it snow let it snow  
  
Let is snow  
  
It doesnt show sings of stopping  
Ive brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow let is snow let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I hate going out in the storm  
If youll really hold me tight  
All the way home Ill be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying oh my dear  
Were still goodbyeing  
As long as you love me so  
Let it snow let it snow let it snow  
Let it snow let it snow let it snow  
Let is snow let is snow let is snow  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I hate going out in the storm  
If youll really hold me tight  
All the way home Ill be warm  
  
The weather outside is frightful  
The fire is so delightful  
As long as you love me so  
Let it snow let it snow let it snow  
Let it snow let it snow let it snow  
  
Let is snow let is snow  
Let is snow let is snow
