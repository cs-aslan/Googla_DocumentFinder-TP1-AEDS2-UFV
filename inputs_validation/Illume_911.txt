Illume says the candle that I burn  
A reflection in the window  
All the way to Point Dume  
Illume like it dances  
I am a cliff dweller  
From the old school  
  
I like the coastal cities  
I like the lights  
I like the way the ocean blends  
Into the city at night  
Its like living on a working river  
The coastline is glittering  
Like a diamond snake  
In a black sky  
  
Im alone now  
With my thoughts  
Of how we could make it  
Of how we could get out  
What weve been through  
All of the trauma  
The smell of Nag Champra  
Shadow of a stranger  
  
I will not take you for granted  
I wouldnt trade you for jade  
Or for diamonds  
Not for one minute  
Not for anything  
I need you to be there  
Just remember when I am haunted  
That I was just so scared  
  
Im alone now  
With my thoughts  
Of how we could make it  
Of how we could get out  
What weve been through  
All of the trauma  
The smell of Nag Champra  
Shadow of a stranger  
  
What I saw on this journey  
I saw history go down  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
Its just like a river  
Ooh its never ending  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
  
Because its just like a river  
Its never ending  
Its just like a river  
Its never ending  
  
Im alone now  
With my thoughts  
Of how we could make it  
Of how we could get out  
What weve been through  
All of the trauma  
The smell of Nag Champra  
Shadow of a stranger  
  
What I saw on this journey  
I saw history go down  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
Its just like a river  
Ooh its never ending  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
  
Im alone now  
With my thoughts  
Of how we could make it  
Of how we could get out  
What weve been through  
All of the trauma  
The smell of Nag Champra  
Shadow of a stranger  
  
What I saw on this journey  
Is what legends are made of  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
Its just like a river  
Ooh its never ending  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
  
Because its just like a river  
Its never ending  
It falls away  
Like a river  
Its never ending
