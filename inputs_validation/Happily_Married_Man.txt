Awwwwww  
I aint seen my wife for two or three years  
Im a happily married man  
Since she left Ive been running wild  
Jumping all the women I can  
Gave me some trouble for a little while  
But now Im back to my old style  
I aint seen my wife for two or three years  
Im a happily married man  
Oh yes I am and further more  
  
Aint got no home no children no pets  
Im a happily married man  
When I get tried I just lay down  
I sleep where ever I am  
Now my plate and my pot are gone from my sink  
And I dont have to worry bout taking a drink  
I aint seen my wife for two or three years  
Im a happily married man  
  
Come on in there youall  
  
Whooa now let me get in there  
  
Now my new old lady is outta sight  
Im a happily married man  
Shes a loving me a every day and a every night  
Just as much as she can  
Now I dont have to worry about sleeping pill  
Knives Guns or doctor bill  
No I aint seen my wife for two or three years  
Im a happily married man  
Happily married man  
Parting with you was such a sweet sorrow  
Whooa awww come on
