To touch each others hearts  
Does anything last forever  
I dont know  
Maybe were near the end  
  
So darlin oh how can we go on together  
Now that weve grown apart  
Well the only way to start  
Is heart to heart  
  
One by one  
Were collecting lies  
When you cant give love  
You give alibis  
I wanna do right  
This time I gotta do right

I dont wanna say goodbye  
But sooner or later  
Baby there comes a time  
Oh When I gotta do right

Now that weve grown apart  
Well the only way to start  
Is heart to heart

I need a little more lovin in my heart  
People say that love will grow  
So how was I to know  
Love thats come through years and years  
Cant find a way back home anymore  
  
Darlin tell me the truth

To touch each others hearts
