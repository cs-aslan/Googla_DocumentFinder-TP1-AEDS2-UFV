You can make me free  
You can make me smile  
You can make me be  
Like a little child  
  
You can melt the ice that chills my body  
You can dry my every tear  
You make the lonely hours disappear  
  
You can make me free  
You can make me rise  
You can make me see  
So open up my eyes  
  
Dont you know my only real moments  
Are the ones I spend with you  
How I long to drink some wine again with you  
  
I can take to the skies  
I can soar like a bird with its heart full of song  
Wont you color my eyes  
Ive been waiting so long  
  
You can make me free  
You can make me cry  
You can make it so much better  
If you would only try  
  
And if I must wait a lonely lifetime  
Until I am with you my love  
I will wait but youll be what Im dreamin of  
  
I can take to the skies  
I can soar like a bird with his heart full of song  
Wont you cover my eyes  
Ive been waiting so long  
  
You can make me free  
You can make me cry  
You can make it so much better  
If you would only try  
  
And if I must wait a lonely lifetime  
Until I am with you my love  
I will wait but youll be what Im dreamin of  
  
I can take to the skies  
I can soar like a bird with his heart full of song  
Wont you cover my eyes  
Ive been waiting so long  
  
You can make me free  
You can make me cry  
You can make it so much better  
If you would only try  
  
And if I must wait a lonely lifetime  
Until I am with you my love  
I will wait but youll be what Im dreamin of  
  
You can make me free  
You can make me cry  
You can make it so much better  
If you would only try
