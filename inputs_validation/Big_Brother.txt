Your name is big brother  
You say that youre watching me on the tele  
Seeing me go nowhere  
Your name is big brother  
You say that youre tired of me protesting  
Children dying everyday  
My name is nobody  
But I cant wait to see your face inside my door  
  
Your name is big brother  
You say that you got me all in your notebook  
Writing it down everyday  
Your name is Ill see ya  
Ill change if you vote me in as the pres  
The President of your soul  
I live in the ghetto  
You just come to visit me round election time  
  
I live in the ghetto  
Someday I will move on my feet to the other side  
My name is secluded we live in a house the size of a matchbox  
Roaches live with us wall to wall  
  
Youve killed all our leaders  
I dont even have to do nothin to you  
Youll cause your own country to fall
