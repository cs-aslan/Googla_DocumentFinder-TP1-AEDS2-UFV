Dont call it a comeback  
Ive been here for years  
Im rocking my peers  
Puttin suckers in fear  
Makin the tears rain down like a monsoon  
Listen to the bass go boom  
Explosions overpowerin  
Over the competition Im towerin  
Wrecking shop when I write these lyrics  
Thatll make you call the cops  
Dont you dare stare you better move  
Dont ever compare  
Me to the rest thatll all get sliced and diced  
Competitions payin the price  
  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
  
Dont you call this a regular jam  
Im gonna rock this land  
Im gonna take this ittybitty world by storm  
And Im just gettin warm  
Just like Muhammed Ali  
They called him Cassius  
Watch me bash this beat like a skull  
That you know Ive beef with  
Why do you riff with me  
The maniac psycho  
And when I pull out my jammy get ready  
Cause I might go Blaw  
How you like me now  
The Ripple will not allow  
You to get with Mr Swift or Rift  
Listen to my gears shift  
Im blasting Im blasting  
Kinda like shaft so you can say Im shafting  
Olde English filled my mind and I came up with a funky rhyme  
  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
  
Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio UH  
I just dont know  
What made you forget that I was raw  
But now I gotta new tour  
Im going insane  
Startin the hurricane  
Releasin pain  
Lettin you know  
You cant gain or maintain  
Unless you say my name  
Rippin  
Killin  
Diggin and drillin a hole  
Pass the Old Gold  
  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
  
Shotgun blasts are heard  
When I rip and kill at will  
The man of the hour tower of power  
Ill devour  
Im gonna tie you up and let you understand  
That Im not your average man  
When I gotta jammy in my hand  
Damn  
Oh  
Listen to the way I slay  
Your crew  
Damage  
Damage  
Destruction terror and mayhem  
Pass me a sissy so sucker Ill slay him  
Farmers what  
Farmers what  
Im ready were ready  
I think Im gonna bomb a town  
Get down  
Dont you never ever  
Pull my lever  
Cause I explode  
And my nine is easy to load  
I gotta thank God  
Cause he gave me the strength to rock Hard  
  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
Im gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out
