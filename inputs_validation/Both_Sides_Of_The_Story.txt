Though we might hate to admit it  
There are always two sides to every story  
  
Find yourself in the gutter in a lonely part of town  
Where death waits in the darkness with a weapon to cut some stranger down  
Sleeping with an empty bottle hes a sad and an empty hearted man  
All he needs is a job and a little respect so he can get out while he can  
  
We always need to hear both sides of the story  
  
A neighborhood peace is shattered its the middle of the night  
Young faces hide in the shadows  
While they watch their mother and father fight  
He says shes been unfaithful she says her love for him has gone  
And the brother shrugs to his sister and says  
Looks like its just us from now on  
  
We always need to hear both sides of the story  
  
And the lights are all on the world is watching now  
People looking for truth we must not fail them now  
Be sure before we close our eyes  
Dont walk away from here  
Til you hear both sides  
  
Here we are all gathered in what seems to be the centre of the storm  
Neighbours once friendly now stand each side of the line that has been drawn  
Theyve been fighting here for years but now theres killing on the streets  
While small coffins are lined up sadly now united in defeat  
  
We always need to hear both sides of the story  
  
And the lights are all on the world is watching now  
People looking for truth we must not fail them now  
Be sure before we close our eyes  
Dont walk away from here  
Til you see both sides  
  
White man turns the corner finds himself within a different world  
Ghetto kid grabs his shoulder throws him up against the wall  
He says would you respect me if I didnt have this gun  
Cause without it I dont get it and thats why I carry one  
  
We always need to hear both sides of the story
