Can anyone explain the thrill of a kiss  
No No No  
But when two eager lips are pressed against yours  
Youll know yes youll know  
  
Can anyone explain the glow of romance  
No No No  
But when you hear the phrase Its you I adore  
Youll know yes youll know  
  
And you will find to give love a start  
Dont think with your mind just feel with your heart  
  
Can anyone explain the wonder of love  
No No No  
But now that you and I are sharing a sigh  
We know yes we know  
  
And you will find to give love a start  
Dont think with your mind just feel with your heart  
  
Can anyone explain the wonder of love  
No No No  
But now that you and I are sharing a sigh  
We know yes we know
