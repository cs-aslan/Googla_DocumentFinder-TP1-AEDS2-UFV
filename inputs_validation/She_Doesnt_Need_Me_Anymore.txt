Dont know when she started changing  
Dont know how its come to this  
Seems like yesterday she was in my arms begging for a kiss  
Now the winds of change are blowin  
And theyre taking her away  
I will do my best not to hold her back  
But theres nothing more to say  
  
She doesnt need me  
Shes gonna leave me  
She needs some time on her own  
I should have told her  
Now I cant hold her  
Wish it could be like before  
But she doesnt need me anymore  
  
Its so hard to watch believe me  
Its so hard to be alone  
I just hope and prey that therell come a day  
Shell find the road back home  
  
She doesnt need me  
Shes gonna leave me  
She needs some time on her own  
I should have told her  
Now I cant hold her  
Wish it could be like before  
But she doesnt need me anymore  
  
If I pretend to be happy Id only be fooling myself  
Cause here in my heart I know that Im dying  
And its tearing me apart baby Im crying  
  
I should have told her  
Now I cant hold her  
Wish it could be like before  
But she doesnt need me now  
  
Wish it could be like before  
But she doesnt need me anymore
