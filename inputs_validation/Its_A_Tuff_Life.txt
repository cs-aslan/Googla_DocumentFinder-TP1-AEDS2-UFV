Isnt it a tuff life  
You race your Mercedes through the park after midnight  
Hopin for a few cheap thrills  
Theres always someone around to lift your spirits up  
All along just pumpin up your attitude  
Dont believe a word they say  
Cause its never true  
Isnt it a tuff life  
You got a tuff life  
If you cant have it then you dont want it  
You dont need no steady job  
Well isnt it a tuff life  
You got a tuff life  
  
You thought youd move to Jamaica  
So you packed up your bags and headed south to get an even tan  
But you didnt count on rain  
  
You were perfect for the script  
So you bought the best selling novel  
Knowing that you couldnt miss  
But you never got the part  
  
Isnt it a tuff life  
You got a tuff life  
If you cant have it then you dont want it  
You dont need no steady job  
Well isnt it a tuff life  
  
It dont get any easier  
And you know sometimes it can get pretty ruff  
  
Well isnt it a tuff life  
You got a tuff life  
  
Isnt it a tuff life  
You got a tuff life  
Isnt it a tuff life  
Youve got such a tuff life  
Isnt it a tuff life  
You got a tuff life  
Isnt it a tuff life  
You got such a tuff life
