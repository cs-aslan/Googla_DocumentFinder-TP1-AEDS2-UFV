Hung around with big shots  
Never knew love was in the sights  
I guess I missed the target  
Caught up in a different line of fire  
  
But I know since Ive been aiming  
For the sweetness in your soul  
Your name is on the bullet  
And its gettin ready to explode  
  
Theres been a change inside my life  
And I just wanna let you know  
  
Ive got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
Ive got my finger on the trigger  
I aint lettin go  
  
Mama used to tell me  
Girl you better load your gun up right  
She said ya ya gotta come out smokin  
Hit it with your best shot every time  
  
Well I I didnt understand her  
Til you walked right into range  
I saw your love at twenty paces  
And I knew Id won the game  
  
You better raise your heart up high  
Or love will blow you right away  
  
Ive got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
Ive got my finger on the trigger  
I aint lettin go  
  
Ive got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
Ive got my finger on the trigger  
I aint lettin go  
  
Leave off that safety catch  
There aint no risk were gonna have some fun  
Ive got cha loves begun  
So stay with me until the mornin sun  
  
Youre super bullet number one  
  
Theres been a change inside my life  
And I just wanna let you know  
  
Ive got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
Ive got my finger on the trigger  
I aint lettin go  
  
Ive got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
Ive got my finger on the trigger  
I aint lettin go  
  
Ive got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
Ive got my finger on the trigger  
I aint lettin go
