When this world is caught on fire  
I wanna be caught in your will  
No I never will give up no no  
No I never will no no  
No I never will give up no no  
No I never will no no  
And when this world is caught on fire  
I wanna be caught in your will  
I never will give up no no  
No I never will No no no no no  
  
Ill always remember ya ya  
You know I always will ya ya  
Ill always remember ya ya  
Ya know I always will ya ya  
When they crucified my Lord up on Calveries hill  
Ill always remember ya ya  
Ya know I always will ya ya ya ya ya

And when this world is caught on fire  
I wanna be caught in your will  
I never will give up no no  
No I never will No no no no no

Ya know I always will ya ya  
Ill always keep singin ya ya  
Ya know I always will ya ya  
And when they crucified my Lord up on Calveries hill
