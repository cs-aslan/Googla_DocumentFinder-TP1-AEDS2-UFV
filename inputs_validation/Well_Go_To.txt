To boldly clap in a room full of nothing  
You never know it could be one of those  
Poignant evenings  
Museums locked and its long since past  
Closing  
You cannot know you cannot not know  
What youre knowing  
What can you do theyre all gone  
And well go too  
The curtain climbs over me every morning  
I dont know why Im so immunized  
Against reforming  
To coldly slap at a face full of nothing  
You never know it couldve been one of those  
Looks of longing  
What can you do theyre all gone  
And well go too
