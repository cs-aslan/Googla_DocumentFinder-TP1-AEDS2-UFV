We are going down Jordan  
We are going down Jordan  
We are going down Jordan  
Lets walk the heavenly road  
I was livin me life as an Anglican  
Let me tell you how I changed to a Baptist man  
I was livin me life as an Anglican  
Let me tell you how I changed to a Baptist man  
One night I was walking down Fredrick street  
Poor and hungry no shoes on me feet  
I passed a door that said Down with sin  
It was the smell of food that pull me in  
We are going down Jordan  
We are going down Jordan  
We are going down Jordan  
Lets walk the heavenly road  
Well the leader walked up and he shook my hand  
Said I want you to be a holy man  
Right away I made a big decision  
Me stomach was a growling for this new religion  
I started over to get some food  
When some sisters approached me in a mystic mood  
They dunked me in the water bout four five times  
I couldnt see a thing cause I was almost blind  
Singing Ive got a sword in my hand  
Im going to use it well  
I was drenched to me skin and I was feeling cold  
But the sight of the food made me take a hold  
The sisters started to break away  
They said Kneel believers kneel and pray  
I prayed and I prayed in a newfound style  
In the meantime me taste buds was running wild  
I was about to fall clear out of me seat  
When a man jumped up and said Before you eat  
You got to mourn children mourn  
You got to mourn children mourn  
And if you want to go to Heaven when you die  
You got to mourn children mourn  
Well before I baptized I had plenty pain  
Now I find myself a free man again  
Well before I baptized I had plenty pain  
Now I find myself a free man again  
Dont talk
