We both went a little crazy  
We both did each other wrong  
Dont think its too late baby  
Dont think that all hope is gone  
  
Chorus  
We need a little more love  
To get us through the night  
Just a little more love  
And well be all right  
  
Itd be easy to say it doesnt matter  
To walk away and wish you the best  
But I know wed feel a whole lot better  
If we tried a little tenderness  
  
Lets put our differences aside  
We can make it baby you and I  
Lets give it just one more try  
We cant let this thing die
