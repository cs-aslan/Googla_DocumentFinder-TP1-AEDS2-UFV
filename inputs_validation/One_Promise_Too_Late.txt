I would have waited forever  
If Id known that youd be here  
We could have shared our lives together  
And held each other close all through the years  
But Ive met someone before you  
And my heart just couldnt wait  
So no matter how much I adore you  
Ive got to stand behind the promise that I made  
  
Chorus  
Where were you  
When I could have loved you  
Where were you  
When I gave my heart away  
All my life Ive been dreaming of you  
You came along one promise too late  
You came along one promise too late  
  
I wont say that Im sorry that I met you  
I cant have you but I never will forget you  
  
Chorus x2
