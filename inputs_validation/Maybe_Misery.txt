Can you answer me  
No more time for questioning  
My cars outside I want to leave  
Dont you think Im interesting  
Well Im listening  
  
Everythings obvious  
The way you put your hand on me  
The way you talk so easily  
The way your lips are glistening  
Well Im listening  
  
You get around  
You want me  
You come around  
You need me  
This time around  
I wont be back at all  
  
Maybe misery is  
What I need to keep my sanity  
And I dont mean if things dont go my way  
Ill be pleased to meet you  
  
And maybe yesterday  
Was a day that I could get away  
Now today Im stuck in sanity  
And Im pleased to meet you  
  
Right now I think Im sane  
But Im really just anxious  
To cross that bridge  
The subconscious oasis  
Where right is right  
And wrong is wrong  
And you werent there  
To build me up  
  
You get around  
You want me  
You come around  
You need me  
This time around  
I wont be back at all  
  
Maybe misery  
Is what I need to keep my sanity  
And I dont mean if things dont go my way  
Ill be pleased to meet you pleased to meet you  
  
And maybe yesterday  
Was a day that I could get away  
Now today Im stuck in sanity  
And Ive seen it all  
Ive seen it all  
Many times before  
  
Maybe misery  
Is what I need to keep my sanity  
And I dont mean if things dont go my way  
Ill be pleased to meet you  
  
And maybe yesterday was a day that I could get away  
Now today Im stuck in sanity  
And Ive seen it all  
Ive seen it all  
Many times before  
  
Maybe misery many times before  
Is what I need to keep my sanity many times before  
And I dont mean if things dont go my way many times before  
Ill be pleased to meet you many times before  
  
And maybe yesterday many times before  
Was a day that I could get away many times before  
Now today Im stuck in sanity many times before  
And Ive seen it all  
Ive seen it all  
Many times before
