Dont makes no difference  
If you lay down and cry  
You know that you lied to me  
And if you come to me  
With tears in your eyes  
Dont say goodbye  
Just leave  
  
Chorus  
Cause Im in the middle of something  
I dont understand  
How can my reasons for living  
Slip right through my hands  
Im in the middle of something  
I dont understand  
And if looks like I lose again  
  
Dont make no difference  
What you think of me  
You know that Im restless and afraid  
And if you love me  
I know that you will see  
You cant keep me  
To the promises that I made  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont make no difference  
What you think about me  
After all you took me for a ride  
Now every night with you  
I still seem to find  
I just cant keep you satisfied  
  
Chorus x2
