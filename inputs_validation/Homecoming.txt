I guess I shouldve written dad  
To let you know that I was coming home  
Ive been gone so many years  
I didnt realize you had a phone  
  
I saw your cattle coming in  
Boy theyre looking mighty fat and slick  
I saw fred at the service station  
Told me that his wife is awful sick  
  
You heard my record on the radio  
Oh well its just another song  
But Ive got a hit recorded  
And itll be out on the market fore too long  
  
I got this ring in mexico  
No it didnt cost me quite a bunch  
When youre in the business that Im in  
The people call it puttin up a front  
  
I know Ive lost a little weight  
I guess I am looking kind of pale  
If you didnt know me better dad  
Youd think that Id just gotten out of jail  
  
No we dont ever call them beer joints  
Night clubs are the places that I work  
You meet a lot of people there but no  
There aint much chance of gettin hurt  
  
Im sorry that I couldnt be there with you all when momma passed away  
I was on the road and when they came and told me it was just too late  
  
I drove by the grave to see her boy  
That really is a pretty stone  
Im glad that fred and jan are here  
Its better than you being here alone  
  
Well I knew yous gonna ask me  
Who the lady is thats sleeping in the car  
Thats just a girl who works for me  
And man she plays a pretty mean guitar  
  
We worked in San Antone last night  
She didnt even have the time to dress  
She drove me down from nashville and  
To tell the truth I guess she needs the rest  
  
Well dad I gotta go  
We got a dance to work in cartersville tonight  
Let me take your number down  
Ill call you and I promise you Ill write  
  
Now you be good and dont be chasin  
All those pretty women that you know  
And by the way if you see barbara walker  
Tell her that I said hello
