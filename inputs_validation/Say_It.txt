Funky is as funky does  
Walked on over there she was  
Standing by the jukebox  
With her ear up against refused to hear  
  
What Im sayin Im only prayin  
I just want to make sweet love to you  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
Understand  
I wanna be your man  
I got a plan  
She said speak to the hand  
She said Im gonna rock your world yall  
Oh oh oh

Chorus  
Black or white love or hate  
You should get it off your chest  
Before its too late  
Say it if you got something on your mind  
Say it  
  
You must learn to release your  
I got a car it go fast  
Keep fuzzy dice on the dash  
Gotta bumper sticker it says peace  
Keep a gun under my seat  
To protect you in case one of them bad guys come along  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Am I too rough not rough enough  
You like whips and chains Ill buy that stuff  
Oh oh oh  
  
Chorus  
Love or hate skin black or white  
Gonna eat you up if you keep it inside  
So say it  
Girl you got something on your mind say it  
Baby am I not your type say it  
Like wow do you love me know say it

Get up the nerve gonna make a scene  
Walk it on over like a sex machine  
Takin it to the floor doin my funky dance  
Show her the tiger thats in my what what  
Everybody funny now you actin funny too  
Was it something I said something Ive done  
Something that I do
