Things like this  
Can always take a little time  
I always thought  
Wed be together down the line  
We start to fight  
And cant get over what was said  
Cause you see black and white  
And I see red  
  
And I wonder who let in the rain  
You know without you  
Im not the same  
When love gets strong  
People get weak  
Sometimes they lose control  
And wind up in too deep  
They fall like rain  
Who let in the rain  
  
I make the bed and cover  
Where you used to sleep  
Im smoothing over promises  
Made in these sheets  
I envy lovers passing by  
Out on the street  
Cause what they have  
I couldnt keep  
  
And I wonder who let in the rain  
You know without you  
Im not the same  
When love gets strong  
People gets weak  
Sometimes they lose control  
And wind up in too deep  
They fall like rain  
Who let in the rain
