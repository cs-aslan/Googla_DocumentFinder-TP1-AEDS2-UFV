Maybe you bought all the lines that she told you  
Maybe they tore you apart  
Maybe she shrugged off your finest emotions  
Carelessly walked on your heart  
Life aint for sissies and you aint no sissy boy  
And only the strongest survive  
Bad love is better than no love at all  
At least you know youre alive  
  
Chorus  
And just thank God you still got your feelings  
And youre free to be easy and warm  
But from here to the end is what matters my friend  
And youre right at the peak of your form  
Still in the eye of the storm  
  
Maybe you tried somethin too hard to handle  
And maybe you took you a fall  
Is it true that if not for the pain that youre feelin  
It wouldnt have mattered at all  
Tell the truth  
All there is left between living and dying  
Is loving or leaving alone  
You can take it or leave it but make up your mind  
Or fall on your ass on your own  
  
Chorus  
And just thank God you still got your feelings  
And youre free to be easy and warm  
Cause from here to the end is what matters my friend  
And youre right at the peak of your form  
Still in the eye of the storm
