Uh yes I am often imitated  
But I am never duplicated yeah  
Yes I am often imitated  
But I am never duplicated  
  
I cant deny it yous a dick rider  
You can never flow like me blow like me  
Why would a bitch like ya  
She can see that Im a fucking rider you a hitch hiker  
Im walking in some shoes they cant make fit ya  
Got millions of paper that you cant take with ya  
I dont want to talk and I cant take pictures  
Listen to your demo Ill handshake with ya  
Excuse you whos you  
If I need a stunt double Ill use you  
Pardon yall I dont want to step on yall toes  
separate the authentic from the replica flows  
And the kid be places you could never be at  
So that can never be this and this can never be that  
These niggas got some audacity  
Sell some records as fast as me  
Or sell some tickets out as fast as me  
Motherfucker  
  
Chorus x2  
Yes I am often imitated yes he is often imitated  
But I am never duplicated but he is never duplicated  
  
So all that yall can do is hate it  
  
None of these wannabes really come close  
I feel like Im watching the MTV show Christina Milian hosts  
Everybody know this brother got it  
Way before everybody and their mother got it  
They still wonder how he sound like he do  
If I was you Id want to sound like me too  
Cause I got Ms they got Gs and they all right  
But they not me  
They hear how I spit it on a station  
Now they want to put me on they singles just to get an imitation  
No I cant make an appearance  
Give you a cheap fee or break on a clearance  
Im what your label hoped it could be  
Thats why they trying to mould your little ass into a sculpture of me  
With the ladies itll be like leader she like real  
yall trying to be like me and be like ill  
  
Chorus x2  
  
So all that yall can do is hate it  
  
Im real  
Its the way I talk the way I walk  
It aint my fault  
I wont let nothin on two legs stop me  
Cause the real is always better than the bootleg copy  
Like I aint show em the white and yellows at the same time  
Throw backs and pin wheels at the same time  
Like Im scared to drop at the same time  
Ill show you how to do this youngn  
I aint frontin  
These Jordans aint comin  
It aint nothin  
Keep the complaints comin  
Cant hop on my bandwagon  
Jump in my blue flames  
You should not try you are not I  
Its the dude with the Grammy grin  
Its no relation if it aint a street family kin  
So wont the real Fabolous please stand up  
Please stand up  
Please stand up  
  
Chorus x2  
  
So all that yall can do is hate it
