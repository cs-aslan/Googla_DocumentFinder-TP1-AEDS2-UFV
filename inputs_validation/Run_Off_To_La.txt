This here aint no love song  
And it aint for you  
Its for the folks that relate to  
What Ive been going through  
  
Its for the 40 hour overtime  
Workin man  
And too the good women out there  
I know youll understand  
  
Why dont you run off to LA  
And lose your mind  
And get some energy docter to tell  
You everything is fine  
  
We can still be friends like you talk about  
But first give me back them pearls  
And the keys to my fuckin house  
Get out  
  
They say all wee need is just a little patience  
But what do you do when your woman  
Is too high maintenance yea  
Im hatin to admit it  
Even if its your wife  
Tell her pack your shit  
And take the first train out of my life  
  
Its a classic line baby  
I just want to be friends  
But baby my friends dont haver the keys to my mercedes benz no  
I think I know what you mean  
  
You want to talk and such  
Tell me all your problems  
But we dont fuck  
Aint that right  
  
I had plenty of friends before I met you  
I dont need no more  
So now I thinks its time you started headin out for that doorand even tho I
feel real bad tonight  
Please pack your shit  
And take the first train out of my life  
  
They say all we need is juat a little patience  
Yea  
But what do you do when your woman is too high maintenance  
I know  
Im hatin to admit it even if its your wife  
Tell her to pack your bags  
And take the first train out of my life  
  
Why dont you run off to LA  
And lose your mind  
Youve got 15 minutes and  
I think your wasting time yea  
  
Its easy to see when youve lost your mind  
But here ill be when you decide to come back blind  
You were a midwest girl who says  
She liked to drink beer and hang  
  
And now your walkin red carpets talkin new york hip hop slang  
And even though I might break down  
And cry tonight  
Please pack your shit  
And take the first train out of my life oh yea yea  
  
Why dont you run off to LA
