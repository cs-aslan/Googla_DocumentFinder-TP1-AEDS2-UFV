Well I was driving in my car  
With fourteen women after me  
Down Fifth Avenue  
A Friday night it just to be  
She was standing on the corner  
Thumbing a ride  
I said Hop in baby  
Scoot closer by my side  
Honey lets go riding you look so exciting  
Where have you been hiding  
CHORUS  
Friday night feeling tight  
Friday night think she might  
Friday night Friday night  
Theres no telling what youll find  
Cruising on a Friday night  
She didnt say a word  
She just kept those big blue eyes on me  
I wondered what she could be thinkin  
As she put her little hand on my knee  
I took another sip of malted brew  
And then I looked in her eyes  
And as I sank into her bbaby blues  
I thought My oh my  
Theres no use in fighting you look so exciting  
Where have you been hiding girl  
CHORUS  
Cruising on a Friday night  
Cruising on a Friday night  
Cruising on a Friday night
