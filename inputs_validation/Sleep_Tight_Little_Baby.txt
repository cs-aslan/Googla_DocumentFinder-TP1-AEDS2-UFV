Lucy its time for bed now and you need your rest  
So lie down in your coffin dear and sleep tight  
Ill wake you when Daddys here alright  
No no dont dont cry little girl  
Little girl from head to toe  
Deep into the ground you go down down  
  
Sleep tight little baby sleep tight below the ground  
Sleep tight little baby nowhere to run around  
  
OH The worms oh the worms  
  
Is that your Daddy your Daddy  
  
Sleep tight little baby sleep tight below the ground  
Sleep tight little baby nowhere to run around  
  
Oh The worms oh the worms  
  
Is that your Daddy your Daddy  
  
And as Im waiting by the cemetery gates  
For her father to show  
Somethings pounding at my head  
Its like I I I can still hear her SCREAMING  
  
SOLO Andy  
  
Oh Lucy Im doing all this for you  
Oh Lucy I didnt mean to I didnt want to  
But youve got to  
  
Sleep tight little baby sleep tight below the ground  
Sleep tight little baby nowhere to run around  
  
OH The worms Oh The worms  
  
Is that your Daddy your Daddy   
  
So you came at last  Let me see your heart  
Let me see your face you son of a bitch  
  
SOLO Herb  
  
I see a baby crying I see a little tear  
Oh yeah I know youre trying  
But you cant stop the fear DADDY  
  
If you ever want to see your little girl again  
You better do as I say  
Dear Mr Mayor welcome to my humble tomb  
Come inside you know you have to
