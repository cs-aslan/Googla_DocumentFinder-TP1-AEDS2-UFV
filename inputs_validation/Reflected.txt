Look upstanding with your head held high  
You will be reflected  
You look outstanding with your eyes in disguise  
Just beyond your masks  
  
Holy Hollywood he its divine  
Im surely glad Im surely all the time  
And even though Im you will always hear  
  
Very rarely worry utmost constantly  
Could you be receptive  
Our lifes outstanding in a shower please  
Wet my skids a plenty  
  
Baby what a day all over town  
Im surely glad Im surely all around  
And even since I knew its all so clear  
  
You will be reflected  
You will be reflected  
You will be reflected  
You will be reflected reflected  
  
Yeah
