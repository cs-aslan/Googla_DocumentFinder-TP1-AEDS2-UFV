Here comes that song again  
Soft in your arms I hear the words begin  
They promise this time the melody wont end  
Here comes that song again  
  
Theres a tender song inside me  
Only your sweet voice can play  
I heard it once but it disappeared  
On the day you went away  
  
As time slipped by  
I thought that Id forgotten all the lines  
But then last night we met again  
And I heard them one more time  
  
Here comes that song again  
Soft in your arms I hear the words begin  
They promise this time the melody wont end  
Here comes that song again  
  
With the early mornin raindrops  
Dancin on my window pane  
You hold me and I hear my song  
Keepin time with the fallin rain  
  
Now I dont know what made you go  
Or brought you back last night  
I only know my love for you  
Is a song that feels so right  
  
Here comes that song again  
Soft in your arms I hear the words begin  
They promise this time the melody wont end  
Here comes that song again  
  
Here comes that song again  
Soft in your arms I hear the words begin  
They promise this time  
The melody wont end
