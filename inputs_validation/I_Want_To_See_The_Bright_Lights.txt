Im so tired of workin everyday  
Now the weekends come Im gonna throw my troubles away  
If youve got the cab fare Mister youll do alright  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
Meet me at the station dont be late  
I need to spend some money and it just wont wait  
Take me to the dance and hold me tight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
Theres crazy people runnin all over town  
Theres a silver band just marchin up and down  
And the big boys are all spoilin for a fight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
Meet me at the station dont be late  
I need to spend some money and it just wont wait  
Take me to the dance and hold me tight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
A couple of drunken nights rollin on the floor  
Is just the kind of mess Im looking for  
Im gonna dream till Monday comes in sight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
Meet me at the station dont be late  
I need to spend some money and it just wont wait  
Take me to the dance and hold me tight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
Take me to the dance and hold me tight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight
