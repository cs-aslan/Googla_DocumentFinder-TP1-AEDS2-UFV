The backroom boys are playin real hard  
Theres a lot of money rollin on the next card  
Some are goin up some are goin down  
Somell never make it to the next round  
  
Stone me it dont come free  
You gotta be a winner  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
  
They gota room full of women  
A table full of booze  
Gettin meaner with the dealercause he cant lose  
Someone shouts outits a goddamn shame  
The dealers gettin meaner with the cocaine  
  
Stone me it dont come free  
Gotta be a winner  
If you want to be a backroom boy

The backroom boys are all the same  
Even take your money when they play games  
Take you when youre up kick you when youre down  
Youll always be a loser in their town
