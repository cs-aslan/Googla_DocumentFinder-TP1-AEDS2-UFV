I mustve stumble out of the plane  
Cause I freefell all year  
My shoot is illuminous like spring  
And Im nowhere now but here  
  
But Ive seen your long hair come down  
It turned my head inside out  
And I want you I want you  
I still do  
  
Your wrists were bound in my hands  
While I wash around my naked feet  
Your blue jeans over in the sand  
We were wrestling up in the blanket sheets  
  
But Ive seen your long hair come down  
seen your long hair come down  
Turned my head inside out  
turned my head inside out  
  
And I want you I want you  
I still do  
I still I still do  
  
Ive seen your long hair come down  
And turned my head inside out  
But Ive seen your long hair come down  
Turned my head inside out
