Oh oh just as sure as the stars in the sky  
I need you to shine in my life  
Not just for the meanwhile for a long long time  
Better believe it  
  
Oh oh whenever youre not in my presence  
It feels like Im missing my blessings yeah  
So I sleep through the daylight stay awake all night  
Til youre back again oh yeah yeah  
  
You think Im biased  
To my significant other  
You hit it right on the head  
Only been missing my lover  
Got a whole lotta texts in my phone and I dont reply  
The next eight bars tell you why  
  
Youre all that matters to me yeah yeah  
Aint worried about nobody else  
If it aint you I aint myself  
You make me complete  
  
Youre all that matters to me yeah yeah  
Whats a king bed without a queen  
There aint no I in team  
You make me complete  
Youre all that matters to me  
  
Take the gas out the car it wont drive  
Thats how I feel when youre not by my side  
When I wake up in the morning up under you and only you  
  
Oh oh grateful for your existence  
Faithful no matter the distance  
Youre the only girl I see  
From the bottom of my heart please believe  
  
Youre all that matters to me yeah yeah  
Aint worried about nobody else  
If it aint you I aint myself  
You make me complete  
Youre all that matters to me yeah yeah  
Whats a king bed without a queen  
There aint no I in team  
You make me complete  
Youre all that matters to me  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Youre all that matters to me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Youre all that matters to me
