There must be a million there must be a million  
Teardrops falling down theyre falling down  
Yes there must be a million yes theres one million  
Ill forget somehow Ill forget somehow  
How long I am crying still Im yours to commend  
Take this love that I give you heres my heart in my hand  
  
Alone alone I am crying Oh how I cry  
I am yours to commend Im yours to commend  
Take this love that I give you my my love I give you  
Heres my heart in my hand
