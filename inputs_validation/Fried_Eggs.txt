We had an apartment in the city  
Me and my husband liked living there  
Its been years since the kids have grown  
A life of their own left us alone  
  
John and linda live in omaha  
Joe is somewhere on the road  
We lost davy in the korean war  
I still dont know what for dont matter any more  
  
You know that old trees just grow stronger  
And old rivers grow wilder every day  
But old people they just grow lonesome  
Waiting for someone to say  
hello in there hello  
  
Me and my husband we dont talk much anymore  
He sits and stares through the backdoor screen  
And all the news just repeats itself  
Like some forgotten dream  
That weve both seen  
  
Someday ill go and call up judy  
We worked together at the factory  
Ah but what would I say when she asks whats new  
Say nothing whats with you  
Nothing much to do   
  
You know that old trees just grow stronger  
And old rivers grow wilder every day  
Ah but old people they just grow lonesome  
Waiting for someone to say  
hello in there hello  
  
So if youre walking down the street sometime  
And you should spot some hollow ancient eyes  
Dont you pass them by and stare  
As if you didnt care  
Say hello in there hello
