Im sitting here alone up In my room  
Thinking about the times that weve been through oh my love  
Im looking at a picture In my hand  
Trying my best to understand  
  
I really want to know what we did wrong  
With the love that felt so strong  
If only you were here tonight  
I know that we could make It right  
  
I dont know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
Cause your the only one within my heart  
I was born to make you happy  
  
Always and forever you and me  
Thats the way our life should be  
I dont know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
  
I know Ive been a fool since youve been gone  
Id rather give It up then carry on oh my love  
Cause livin In a dream of you and me  
Is not the way my life should be  
  
I dont want to cry a tear for you  
So forgive me If I do  
If only you were here tonight  
I know that we could make It right  
  
I dont know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
Cause your the only one within my heart  
I was born to make you happy  
  
Always and forever you and me  
Thats the way our life should be  
I dont know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
  
Id do anything  
Id give you my world  
Id wait forever to be your girl  
Just call out my name just call out my name  
  
I will be there and I will be there  
Just to show you how much I care  
I dont know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
  
Cause your the only one within my heart  
I was born to make you happy  
Always and forever you and me  
Thats the way our life should be  
  
I dont know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
I was born to make you happy  
Always and forever you and me  
  
Thats the way our life should be  
I dont know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy
