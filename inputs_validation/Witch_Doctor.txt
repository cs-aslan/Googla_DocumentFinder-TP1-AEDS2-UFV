I told the witch doctor I was in love with you  
I told the witch doctor you didnt love me too  
And then the witch doctor he told me what to do  
He said that  
  
Chorus

Walla walla bing bang  
Ooo eee ooo ah ah ting tang  
Walla walla bing bang  
Ooo eee ooo ah ah ting tang  
Walla walla bing bang

Walla walla bing bang  
  
I told the witch doctor you didnt love me true  
I told the witch doctor you didnt love me nice  
And then the witch doctor he game me this advice  
He said to  
  
Chorus  
  
Now youve been keeping love from me  
Just like you were a miser  
And Ill admit I wasnt very smart  
So I went out and found myself  
A guy thats so much wiser  
And he taught me the way to win your heart  
  
My friend the witch doctor he taught me what to say  
My friend the witch doctor he taught me what to do  
I know that youll be mine when I say this to you  
Oh Baby  
  
Chorus
