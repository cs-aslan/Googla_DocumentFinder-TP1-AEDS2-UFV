Pack up Ive had enough thats it I quit  
Give up you win I lose you win  
You choose you stay  
Ill go you stay I lose  
  
I used to be a dreamer  
But I realize that its not my style at all  
In fact it becomes clearer that a dreamer  
Doesnt stand a chance at all  
  
Get out of here  
Get out of here  
Get out  
Do I make myself clear  
  
No way I must go cant stay must run  
No chance I cant give a second chance  
No hope theres no hope for you now  
No romance no more romance  
  
No how no how could we stay together  
No need I have no need for you now  
No fear no fear of you no more  
  
Get out of here  
Get out of here  
Do I make myself clear  
  
Pack up give in go home get out  
  
I used to be a dreamer  
But I realized that its not my style at all  
In fact it becomes clearer that a dreamer  
Doesnt stand a chance at all  
  
And Ive become bitter  
For I believe that this is better  
No matter whatever whenever  
We can never ever stay together  
  
Get out of here  
Go  
  
Do I make myself plain  
I dont want to ever see you again  
Get out of here  
  
Pack up give in get out of here  
Rev up go away get out of here  
Give in go home right away get to  
Pack up give in give up rev up  
Go away out
