Condemned to violence  
Arrested by pain  
Inside the soul lies a man insane  
Conceived in anger  
Addicted to hate  
The mutant child of a twisted state  
  
Beware the contradiction  
Beneath the crimson void  
Cause in the world of fiction  
My Jekyll doesnt hide  
  
A killers smile with  
A psycho star dream  
Behind the mask things arent what they seem  
Unholy soldier  
Disciple of sin  
What kind of mind are you living in  
  
Youre preaching revolution  
Dont you mean genocide  
Behind this resolution  
My Jekyll doesnt hide  
  
Waiting to die for the every first time  
All right thats right  
Waiting to die for the every first time  
I dont give a damn cause I think its my time my time  
  
The symbiosis  
Of murder and lies  
What do I see looking through your disguise  
Fourth Reich dementia  
Subversion ideals  
God only knows what your secret conceals  
  
Wholl be the first offender  
Who will be victimized  
In your perverse agenda  
My Jekyll doesnt hide
