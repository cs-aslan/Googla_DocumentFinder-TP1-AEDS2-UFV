News in the city breaks without pity  
Long after the war has ended  
Were still in fatigues  
Up against it  
The higher you fly the further you fall  
Up against it  
Wondering why we fought after all  
Such a cold winter with scenes  
As slow as Pinter  
Synchronise your watches  
Theres still time to kill  
Up against it  
Drinking this swill to sweeten the pill  
Up against it  
The more that it hurts  
The less that it works  
Wrapped in nostalgia to queue for a show  
Back to Trafalgar one kiss then Ill go  
So deep in quicklime  
The bones of an old crime  
I knew a man who raked them over  
Hes still suffering  
Up against it  
Buried so deep  
It gives me the creeps  
Up against it  
The longer you hate  
The more that it grates  
Up against it  
Look left then right  
And run for your Life  
Up against it  
The more that it hurts  
The less that it works
