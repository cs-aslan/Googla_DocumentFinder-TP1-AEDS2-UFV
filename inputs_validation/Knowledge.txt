I know that things are getting tougher  
When you cant get the top off from  
The bottom of the barrel  
Wide open road of my future now  
Its looking fucking narrow  
  
All I know is that I dont know nothing  
We get told to decide  
Just like as if Im not going to change my mind  
  
All I know is that I dont know nothing  
Whatcha gonna do with yourself  
Boy better make up your mind  
  
Whatcha gonna do with yourself boy  
Youre running out of time  
  
This time I got it all figured out  
All I know is that I dont know nothing  
And thats fine
