Everytime I try to read between the lines  
Im left wondering what I did so wrong  
Everytime I try try to rationalize  
When everyone went wrong why didnt we die  
Everytime I think about what it would be like  
  
Without all the things you give to me  
All these thoughts keep running through my head  
Nothing to believe  
Look back find the things I lost  
  
Theres nothing left there so it seems  
Up hill both ways  
Nothing left to say  
I dont know how I made it this far  
  
I dont know how I made it last this long  
I dont know why I try  
All these things keeps going through my head  
Dont know which way to turn  
  
Each path goes up hill both ways  
Nothing but dust  
Since I learned up hill both ways  
Nothing left to say  
  
I dont know how I made it this far  
I dont know how I made it last this long  
I dont know why I try  
Up hill both ways  
  
Nothing left to do now  
I dont want nothing today
