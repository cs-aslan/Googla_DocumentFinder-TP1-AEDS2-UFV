Dont turn your head  
Back to the wall  
Dont close your eyes  
And wait for your fall  
  
If you believe that you know in this time  
Youve got anything to win  
If you believe that you know  
Then I say Youll lose all again  
  
In this time theres nothing to get for you  
You cannot really do what you want  
Youre a child a prisoner in your mind  
You are a victim of this hopeless time  
  
You better believe all you do has a sense  
Its not for nothing  
You better believe all the troubles you have  
Will play you someday  
  
Why dont you help yourself and do the best  
Put all the bombs back up their builders ass  
Why dont you stand up to say who you are  
To show the people that paradise is not far  
  
Chorus  
Oh cant you see we got the right  
To look into the future without no need to hide  
No we wont accept what you do  
We stand up cause were not the people you can abuse  
Oh cant you see we got the right  
To say we are here to see the light  
No we dont want to lose all again  
Stand up you people to save the world  
As good as you can  
  
We are credulous idiots  
And wont understand what they plan  
We march with the times  
Its what they expect and we do  
  
Why dont you open your eyes  
To undercover all of these lies  
I think you wont accept this  
Go oppose with your fist  
Fight for your rights  
  
Chorus
