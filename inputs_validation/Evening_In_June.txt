By the light of the moon  
When the night holds the secrets  
Of the sleepy lagoon  
Im contemplating moonlight  
On the water  
When Im walking with you  
On an evening in June  
  
On an evening in June  
It can get so sentimental  
When Im thinking of you  
And I cant think of anything  
Except being with you  
When the summer is through  
On an evening in June  
  
On an evening in June  
Well it lifts me up  
When Im talking to you  
On an evening in June  
When the flowers are in bloom  
And the sky is so blue  
  
Well theres so many things  
Taking place  
That its hard to keep up with it all  
Keep your eye on the ball  
And to make the right call  
When were longing for fall  
On this evening in June  
  
On an evening in June  
Well it lifts me up  
When Im talking to you  
On an evening in June  
When the flowers are in bloom  
And the sky is so blue  
  
Well theres so many things taking place  
That its hard to keep up with it all  
Keep your eye on the ball  
And to make the right call  
When were longing for fall  
On this evening in June  
By the sleepy lagoon  
On an evening in June  
By the light of the moon  
By the sleepy lagoon  
On an evening in June  
On an evening in June  
By the sleepy lagoon  
By the light of the moon  
By the sleepy lagoon  
On an evening in June
