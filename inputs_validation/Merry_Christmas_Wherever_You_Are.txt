I had no reason for shopping this season  
But I hung your stocking today  
It makes me feel better  
Though were not together  
Youll always be in my heart  
Merry Christmas wherever you are  
Since it was Christmas  
I thought you might call  
Or have you stopped thinkin about me at all  
Itd be a perfect white Christmas  
A storybook picture  
If I could just share it with you  
Though youre not here with me  
Ive got your memories  
They keep me goin sweetheart  
Merry Christmas wherever you are  
Though youre not here with me  
Ive got your memories  
Youll always be in my heart  
Merry Christmas wherever you are

Merry Christmas wherever you are
