Isnt it like me  
To want to say  
Things I cant explain   
In simple ways  
  
Why should I be sane  
Why cant I be crazy  
  
Sometimes Im up  
Sometimes Im down  
I choke on words  
And make no sound  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes Im weak  
Sometimes Im strong  
Living with the fear I dont belong  
Sometimes  
  
Why is it so hard  
To know myself  
Underneath this skin youll find  
Someone else  
  
Dont be so surprised  
When you look inside me  
Inside me  
  
Sometimes Its black  
Sometimes Its white  
You hide behind electric light  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I swear  
Sometimes I pray  
Suddenly the guilty disobey  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes Im weak  
Sometimes Im strong  
Living with the fear I dont belong  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I stand  
Sometimes I fall  
I throw myself against the wall  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I sink  
Sometimes I swim  
Tell me why my world is caving in  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes its sweet  
Sometimes its raw  
Trying to get so high like I did before  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes in love  
Sometimes in hate  
Sometimes its all a big mistake
