Some folks like to get away  
Take a holiday from the neighborhood  
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood  
But Im takin a Greyhound on the Hudson River line  
Im in a New York state of mind  
  
Ive seen all the movie stars in their fancy cars and their limousines  
Been high in the Rockies under the evergreens  
I know what Im needin and I dont want to waste more time  
Im in a New York state of mind  
  
It was so easy livin day by day  
Out of touch with the rhythym and blues  
But now I need a little give and take  
The New York Times the Daily News  
  
It comes down to reality and its fine with me cause Ive let it slide  
I dont care if its Chinatown or on Riverside  
I dont have any reasons  
I left them all behind  
Im in a New York state of mind  
Oh yeah  
  
It was so easy living day by day  
Out of touch with the rhythym and blues  
But now I need a little give and take  
The New York Times the Daily News  
Who oh oh whoa who  
  
It comes down to reality and its fine with me cause Ive let it slide  
I dont care if its Chinatown or on Riverside  
I dont have any reasons  
I left them all behind  
Im in a New York state of mind  
  
Im just taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River line  
Cause Im in a Im in a New York state of mind
