Well Im sittin at the crowded bar  
To get a little glimpse of your face  
Your profile and your hip style  
Your definition  
Somethin I dont know all about  
So confident in your own space  
  
As you move to look at me  
I lose cause I look away  
Cause you could never ever  
Be just plain old lookin at me  
So I turn to confirm  
That your smile is the same  
  
I cant believe youre lookin at me  
I dont dare  
To turn around to see  
I just have to imagine the youre  
Only lookin through me  
And suddenly youre  
Right here with me  
  
Cause you are this moment yeah  
One minute of one hour of one night  
You might be the center  
Fresh face for my fantasy  
  
You play the perfect part of  
Someone whos a part of me  
Youd help repeating  
The haunting of heart  
So perfectly  
  
I cant believe  
Youre lookin at me lookin at me  
I dont dare to turn around to see  
I have to imagine that youre  
Only lookin through me  
Then suddenly  
Youre right here with me  
  
Said youre right on  
Said youre right on  
Said youre right on  
Oh ill go home and cry  
Oh I saw heaven  
Oh Ive seen so many tragedies  
Oh lord Im feeling  
Oh lord I said its real and  
Oh I say Im feelin alright
