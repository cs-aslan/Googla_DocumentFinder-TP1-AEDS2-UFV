Speaking of which what is your choice  
Your conversation will suffice  
I feel the need thats known to all  
Better use it up before the levels fall  
You can take me back to the primal drive  
You can carry on until we arrive  
Hypnotized inside  
Now Im not young and youre not old  
Id rather purchase than be sold  
Crazed friends so bold  
  
Its not easy to conceal  
When youre so touchable  
People will hide indifference  
Just to be touchable  
They still emit split second screams  
When they are touchable  
Under the surface just for kicks  
Sincerely touchable  
You say its okay but what do I feel  
Guilt compassion or Achilles Heel  
Little feet march down grey matter hill  
Then panic occurs no seeds to spill  
Whats the matter now  
Please look up and speak  
Your spirits wilting and your flesh is weak  
Eight days a week  
I cant imagine whatll happen now  
I wonder when and I wonder how  
The end will come  
  
Its not easy to conceal  
When youre so touchable  
People will hide indifference  
Just to be touchable  
  
Its not easy to conceal  
When youre so touchable  
People will hide indifference  
Just to be touchable  
They still emit split second screams  
When they are touchable  
Under the surface just for kicks  
Sincerely touchable  
  
The final answer to all our fears  
Abrupt conclusion to all our years  
Still touchable but no one hears  
They carry on hypnotized inside
