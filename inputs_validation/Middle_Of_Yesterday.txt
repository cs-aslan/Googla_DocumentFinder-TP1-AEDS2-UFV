Oh well I woke up in hell today  
I woke up depressed and drained  
But thats OK cause I promised  
Not to hurt you again  
And apparently Im to blame  
But apparently Ive been framed  
By a memory that  
Wont help me when its happening  
Out of the mind  
Out of the soul  
Out of the light  
Out of control  
Standing in the middle of yesterday  
Where it all went wrong  
Where we made the mistakes  
Im sorry for the things I forgot to say  
But it wont be long  
Until it will be okay  
Well I promised you I would I change  
But Im an asshole and Im ashamed  
And Im upset cause  
I betrayed everything that you gave  
Will you ever let me explain  
Can I beg you to let me stay  
Dont quit me cause ill never let this happen  
Out of the mind  
Out of the soul  
Out the light  
Out of control  
Standing in the middle of yesterday  
Where it all went wrong  
Where we made the mistakes  
Im sorry for the things I forgot to say  
But it wont be long  
And itll be okay  
  
Standing in the middle of yesterday  
Where it all went wrong  
Where we made the mistakes  
Im sorry for the things I forgot to say  
But it wont be long  
And itll be okay  
Standing in the middle of yesterday  
Where it all went wrong  
Where we made the mistakes  
Im sorry for the things I forgot to say  
But it wont be long  
And itll be okay  
Oh I want to make it up to you  
Make it up to you  
Im gonna make it up to you  
Oh oh  
Oh I want to make it up to you  
Make it up to you  
Im gonna make it up to you  
Oh oh
