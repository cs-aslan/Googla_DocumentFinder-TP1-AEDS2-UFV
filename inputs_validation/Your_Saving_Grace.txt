Winters people watching  
As I sail from seasons four  
To join some crazy ladies  
In a game upon the shore  
None of them with broken wings  
But still refuse to fly  
So with sweetness on my lips  
I smile a last goodbye  
And now I spend my life  
On the velvet side of hell  
Aimlessly here searching  
For what I cannot tell  
The quietness is terrible  
Its more than I can stand  
But thousands now stand cheering  
As my blood flows in the sand  
Spoken Youre not the child  
You thought you were  
You wake up in the night  
And know youre blind  
And yet they keep on pushing  
Trying the insides of your mind  
Forever forever arresting to control  
Until the emptiness of heaven welcomes your weary soul  
Rise up with the new dawns early morning  
Feel the sunshine warm upon your face  
Tomorrows come a long long way to help you  
Yes its your saving grace  
Every day every way  
Tomorrow its your saving grace  
Well now got no time to worry  
Cause Ive got no time to hurry  
Baby its your saving grace  
Now dont you lay those blames on me  
Dont you play those games on me  
Cause baby its your saving grace  
You got to need a little lovin  
Now baby its your saving grace  
Hey I feel alright  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Your saving grace  
Ah hey hey hey  
Your saving grace  
La la la la la la la la  
Oh baby its your saving grace
