On the eastside thats where I met my Ramona  
I wanna go to a party thats what she said  
Lonely thats what I been  
  
Heres my telephone number call me  
And to a party a house party  
Whole lotta people just rallyroundme and love  
She send a message of love  
She said I love up the way you move I love the way you rap BAH BAH  
Ramona please step back  
  
Cause shes my Ruca Im barely waiting for my hiena  
She moved from Long Beach down to LA  
Right now she selling oranges by the freeway  
I wanna know Ramona am I the only one tell me  
And she said Your not the only one but your the best Bradley  
And know now I waiting for my Ruca and I barely pulled up with my hiena  
I know tonight I be behind her dont fuck around with my hiena
