I lie awake late at night  
I just dont seem to sleep at all  
Got so high dont I know why  
Said man I got that Moondog call  
Stepping out into the street  
  
Gonna dance till my legs fall off  
Mister policeman say whats wrong with you  
Why you behaving this way  
I said Im hung on her sweet kiss  
  
My mama told me that the day would come  
So I dont need no alibi  
The judge looked down with a pointed frown  
And said boy you got to explain why  
Out on the street late at night  
Dancing like a crazy fool  
Laughing and singing whats wrong with you  
Why you behaving this way  
I said Im hung on her sweet kiss  
  
And all the boys theyre gonna laugh  
And all the girls gonna talk in class  
But I dont care theres just no way  
Im gonna let this feeling fade away  
I said Im hung on her sweet kiss
