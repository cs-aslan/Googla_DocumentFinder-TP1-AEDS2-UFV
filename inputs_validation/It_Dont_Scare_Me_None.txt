Well it dont scare me none  
Ive been there before  
Sideswiped an old Oak tree  
In a rustedout old Ford  
Shot at guys who were shootin back  
In the Second World War  
And it dont scare me none  
Ive been there before  
  
Well I fell in love with a woman  
Who did not love me back  
Barehandled rattle snakes  
And threw em in a sack  
Honkey tonked with strangers  
Who were eating broken glass  
Well it dont scare me none  
Cause Ill be comin back  
  
I take from my loved ones  
To gamble on my friends  
I take the long way home  
And the fun never ends  
Woke up blurryeyed  
Wonderin where Ive been  
Ive wrestled with my conscience  
But my conscience never wins  
  
No you dont scare me none  
Ive been there before  
Sideswiped an old Oak tree  
In a rustedout old Ford  
Shot at guys who were shooting back  
In the Second World War  
And it dont scare me none  
Ive been there before  
  
Well the preacher man he told me  
Id better change my ways  
Put a lid on the boilin pot  
Or thered be Hell to pay  
Hell aint no place  
For a guy to jump the track  
But it dont scare me none  
Cause man Im coming back  
  
Well it dont scare me none  
Ive been there before  
Sideswiped an old Oak tree  
In a rustedout old Ford  
Shot at guys who were shooting back  
In the Second World War  
And it dont scare me none  
Cause Ive been there before
