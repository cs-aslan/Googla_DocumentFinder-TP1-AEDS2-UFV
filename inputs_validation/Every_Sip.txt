Sip somethin  
Uh sip somethin  
Sip somethin  
I wouldnt drink that if I was you  
  
Chorus  
With every sip of my drink uh  
I get a little bit closer uhhuh  
And when Im tryin to rethink yeah  
I cant really get focused uh uh  
I wasnt tryin to be mean  
I can see that its hopeless uh  
Cause your persistence overpowers me  
I know you rollin out with me  
  
I was stayin at the Shore Club leanin in the red room  
Seen this tan mami she was fresh off the sand dunes  
Big bottles and models and poompooms  
Surroundin my table watchin me like cable  
My Dolce hat was low Versace shades  
Had the Prada shoes on cause the world is a stage  
Lahlah in the air its a sky bar affair  
The glamorous life I had my glass in the air  
When my eyes connected with somethin real real nice  
Like she finished her drink and started chewin on my ice  
Her smile was bananas teeth was pearly white  
Thats when I realized itll be a long night  
The vibe was right she was laced in all white  
Her French manicure traced the crown on my mic  
You ever try to focus resist with all your might  
But every sip you take pulls you deeper in the hype  
  
Chorus  
Im talkin tan lines belly rings and things  
DJ rubbin my thing makin my head swing  
All the honies was schemin  
Cause the rocks in my ears was gleamin oh God I must be dreamin  
My vision was blurry the party was rockin  
The tools was knockin honey want to get it poppin  
Try my best to chill she was fresh out of Brazil  
People was walkin by makin our drinks filled  
What would you do if you was a Don  
In a position to wild out with a Brazilian blond  
Or maybe you a honey and its hard to keep calm  
Cause you sippin on somethin and homeboys the bomb  
You dancin in your seat and singin along  
And every sip makes you feel like you need to perform  
The party is packed its just a little too warm  
But you take another sip to prove that you strong  
  
Chorus  
  
Take it to the bridge  
  
I cant call it I cant tell  
Honestly Im drunk as hell uhhuh  
And me I can not believe lay back baby  
This night out is windin down uh  
You keep buyin all these rounds for me aw man  
I know what you want from me yeah  
I know what you want  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Rollin out with me roll out  
Rollin out with me uh roll out  
Roll out roll out  
Yeah uh uh roll out  
uh uh roll out  
uh uh roll out  
uh uh roll out

Yo Timbo Bars on you baby hahahaha
