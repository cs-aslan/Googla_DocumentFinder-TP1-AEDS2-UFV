I was deprived of a young girls dream  
By the cruel force of nature from the blue  
Instead of a night full of romance supreme  
All I got was a running nose and Asiatic flu  
  
Its raining on prom night my hair is a mess  
Its running all over my taffeta dress  
Its wilting the quilting on my maiden form  
And mascara flows right down my nose because of the storm  
  
I dont even have my corsage oh gee  
It fell down a sewer with my sisters ID  
  
Yes its raining on prom night oh my darling what can I do I miss you  
Its raining rain from the skies  
And its raining real tears from my eyes over you  
Oh dear God make him feel the same way I do right now  
Make him want to see me again  oh what can I do  
  
Its raining rain from the skies its raining tears from my eyes over you  
Raining ooh tears from my eyes over you  
Raining ooh raining on prom night  
Ooh raining ooh tears from my eyes over you  
Ooh raining ooh raining on prom night
