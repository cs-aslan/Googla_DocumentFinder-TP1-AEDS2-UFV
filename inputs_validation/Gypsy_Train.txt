Telephone your baby tell her that youre working late

Sit back and let us do the rest were the best yeah

Gotta get up gotta get in gotta get out just look for me Im always there  
  
Chorus  
  
Come on lets ride ride that gypsy train  
All aboard now dont you be afraid  
Come on lets ride ride that gypsy train  
Feed the fire lets go one mo time again  
  
Medication little love and sympathy cool libation its complimentary  
Play a little poker love when the stakes are high
