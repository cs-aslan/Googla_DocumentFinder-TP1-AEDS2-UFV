Well I think that theres a problem here  
Her voice just dont sound right  
Left a message on the answering machine  
Said Im back in town tonight  
I feel Ive stepped out of the wilderness  
All squinteyed and confused  
But even babies raised by wolves  
They know exactly when theyve been used  
  
See when it starts to fall apart  
It really falls apart  
Like boots or hearts oh when they start  
They really fall apart  
  
Fingers and toes fingers and toes  
Forty things we share  
Fortyone if you include  
The fact that we dont care  
Now youve blocked off most of main street  
For your faith parade  
Everyone in town now they probably all agree  
Im lying in the bed I made  
  
Now you wont even let me talk to you  
We got some air to clear  
Wed probably only agree on one thing anyway  
Thats what the hell is happening here  
Finger and toes fingers and toes  
Forty things we share  
Fortyone if you include  
The fact that we dont care
