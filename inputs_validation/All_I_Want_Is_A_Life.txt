I just want to get a little more out of my payday  
Finally own a car that doesnt break down on the freeway  
A little vacation aint asking very much  
  
I keep coming home to this old broken down apartment  
I wish I had a dime for every hole thats in the carpet  
Well I dont want it all but I aint got enough  
  
CHORUS  
All I want is a life  
To drink from the glass from the well that aint dry  
Im sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie  
All I want is a life  
  
I dont mind the hours and the pain that comes from workin  
But its enough to kill me when I see my baby hurtin  
Want to give her that diamond I never got to buy  
She keeps tellin me that everything is getting better  
But one step up the wrung and someone knocks me off the ladder  
Just want to break even someday before I die  
  
All I want is a life  
To drink from the glass from the well that aint dry  
Im sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie  
All I want is a life  
  
All I want is a life  
To drink from the glass from the well that aint dry  
Im sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie  
All I want is a life
