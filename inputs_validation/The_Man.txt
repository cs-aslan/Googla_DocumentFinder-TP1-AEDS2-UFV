Verse  
I paid my dudes  
I made some money living the dream and its life that I made  
I lost some friends yeah lifes been funny  
But I dont regret any car that I paid  
I thought I had it all  
I was wrong  
I thought I had everything I needed  
But I wasnt true cuz I didnt have you  
And now I have someone to believe in  
And strong enough to offer something new  
To the man that has everything  
The man that has everything  
  
Verse 2  
I face this world and move some mountains  
Gather my strengh from the lessons Ive learned  
I lost my faith  
I think god you found it and all that you asked is my love in return  
  
I thought I had it all  
I was wrong  
I thought I had everything I needed  
But I wasnt true cuz I didnt have you  
And now I have someone to believe in  
And strong enough to offer something new  
To the man that has everything  
The man that has everything  
  
I thought I had everything I needed  
But I wasnt true cuz I didnt have you  
And now I have someone to believe in  
And strong enough to offer something new  
To the man that has everything  
The man that has everything
