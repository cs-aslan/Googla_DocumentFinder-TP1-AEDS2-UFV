Risin above the city blocking out the noonday sun  
It dwarfs the mighty redwoods and it towers over everyone  
I still remember when that delivery truck came down our block  
What a lucky guy I hear he got the last one in stock  
And the neighbors are just green  
They say Thats the biggest screen weve ever seen

Cause Franks the one in charge and he decides what everybody sees  
The pictures crystal clear and everything is magnified  
Robert DeNiros mole has got to be ten feet wide  
Everybody in the town  
Can hear those 90000 watts of Dolby sound  
And Im mighty proud to say  
Now I can watch The Simpsons from thirty blocks away
