Chorus  
  
You supply the night  
Baby Ill supply the love  
You supply the night  
Baby Ill supply the love  
  
I see a horseman in the sky  
It makes me turn and wonder why  
I hear the same old fourteen reasons  
Must be the changing of the seasons  
  
I met the girl across the sea  
She saved my life and came with me  
A tender night of dark persuasion  
Could be my first and last occasion  
  
Baby Ill supply the love  
baby Ill supply the  
Ill supply the love
