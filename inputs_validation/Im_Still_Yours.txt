Been a lot of places  
And met a lot of guys  
One didnt have curly hair  
And one had pretty eyes  
But I dont know whats wrong with me  
I couldnt seem to care  
I just could not accept the love  
They offered me to share  
And Im still yours  
Im still yours  
I never thought when we broke up  
That youd be haunting me  
I thought that when you let me go  
That I would just be free  
But I cant seem to tell my heart  
I cant make it understand  
There may be someone else for me  
Youre not the only man  
And Im still yours  
Im still yours  
Oooh Im like a slave  
Whos master  
Cause he no longer reigns  
Although your gone  
My heart and my mind  
Are still walked by your chain  
If you cant leave my heart alone  
And stop toying with my soul  
Then please come back  
Youve got my life to mold  
To have to hold  
And Im still yours  
Im still yours  
I will always be your baby  
Xs 6 till fade out
