SINCE I LOST MY BABY  
William Robinson Jr and Warren Moore  
album Forever For Always For Love  1982  
  
  
The sun is shining theres plenty of light  
A new day is dawning sunny and bright  
But after Ive been crying all night  
The sun is cold and the new day seems old  
Since I lost my baby  
Oh since I lost my baby  
  
The birds are singing and the children are playing  
Theres plenty of work and the bosses are paying  
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying  
But fun is a bore and with money Im poor  
Since I lost my baby Since I lost my baby  
Oh since I lost my baby  
My baby my baby my baby  
Next time Ill be kinder to my baby  
Wont you please help me find her Ive got to find that girl

My determination is fading fast  
So fast so fast so fast
