Verse 1 Gucci Mane  
1017 Dreamteam  
Eating them percocetes like they was baked beans  
I just got out found out who got clean lean  
And gas weed and Miley C  
Peewee Longway with me thats my blood brother  
Two pints of Ps on us so we mud brothers  
My lifes a gangsta movie man I love colors  
Im in a red bentley Brooklyn its just me and Thugga  
They say Im getting skinny but all of my blunts stuffed  
Aint nuthin skinny but them skinnies on my bentley truck  
This molly really got me thowd up in a Mulsanne backseat  
Powd up two threes of the codeine  
And feel Im bout to OD  
Im in a rari but Im runnin from the police  
A carbon 15 on me and an ounce of OG  
These niggas say they know Guwop but they dont know me  
Ten Gs of molly on me so I brought sand to the beach  
  
Chorus  
Im in a ghost same color dope  
Feel like I just came here on a banana boat  
Come to my store knock on my door  
Soon as I get rid of them I got plenty more  
Like Curtis Blow I got to blow  
Like Bruce Leroy I got to gloat  
I do a show like Im selling dope  
I rep for the hood its a dope show  
  
Verse 2 PeeWee Longway  
Me and big Guwop servin them bricks of duwop  
Them drummers south bricks to dblock  
They bookin those shows for rerock  
Money four door so now Im reroutin  
Looking at a real dope boy with cleeves out  
Lebron James shooter trekkin what the heat brought  
Real dope boy finnessing with the sheet rock  
Feeling like Wayne put it on mamacita  
Hit the block break it down serve James Ether  
Fuck a thought with drop with the egg beater  
Pull up in a drop top but I damn need her  
CNote say we not done counting 20s

Pourin mud so dark think we sippin henny  
Got a bitch so bad call her dream of Jeannie  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
Dope show doing shows like Im sellin dope  
Im counting 300 000 now while she snorting coke  
She mix her coke with heroine then she call it speed ballin  
I miss my cooking with OG I hear that weed callin  
Im on the phone slurring my words because the lean talking  
Sipping champagne shoppin for jeans Im in mini markets  
Trying on giuseppes with a niff and with a beam on it  
Smelling like I just smoked a half a pound of green homey  
The choos got me looking lean homey  
They say the robins looking mean homey  
But I aint sticky cut some lean on it  
They say Im picky bout my weed homey  
These niggas trick u with the lean I put PTs on it  
These niggas killin what they eat homey  
Theyll treat you like a piece of meat homey  
So dont get butchered in the street homey  
I aint had no work in like 2 weeks homey  
I gotta feed the streets plus Guwop gotta eat homey  
  
Chorus
