I would like to leave this city  
This old town dont smell too pretty and  
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind  
And when I leave this island Ill book myself into a soul asylum  
Cause I can feel the warning signs running around my mind  
  
So here I go Im still scratching around in the same old hole  
My body feels young but my mind is very old  
So what do you say  
You cant give me the dreams that are mine anyway  
Half the world away half the world away  
  
Ive been lost Ive been found but I dont feel down  
  
And when I leave this planet  
You know Id stay but I just cant stand it and  
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind  
And if I could leave this spirit  
Ill find me a hole and I will live in it and  
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind  
  
Here I go Im still scratching around in the same old hole  
My body feels young but my mind is very old  
So what do you say   
You cant give me the dreams that are mine anyway  
Half the world away half the world away  
Half the world away  
Ive been lost Ive been found but I dont feel down  
  
No I dont feel down  
No I dont feel down  
I dont feel down  
I dont feel down  
Dont feel down  
I dont feel down
