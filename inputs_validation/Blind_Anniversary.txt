From Demo  
  
Well I want to know whats happening  
I want to know the time  
Youre talking to God and looking the other way  
Youre losing your mind  
  
And when you close your eyes  
The celebration ends  
And therell be no more lies  
Its just another blind blind anniversary

Well I want to know where the country is  
And I want the other side  
Youre fighting the pain  
And fighting the push and pull  
And leave it behind

But Im too limb to celebrate this blind blind anniversary
