Lets have a hand for that young cowboy and wish him better luck next time  
I hope well see him up in Fargo or somewhere farther down the line  
This time he sure drew a bad one one that nobody could ride  
By the way he pulled his hat on you know hed be there for the fight  
And its the classic contradiction the unavoidable affliction  
And it dont take much to predict son the way it always goes  
Cause one day shell say she loves you and the next shell be tired of you  
And pushll always come to shove you on that midnight rodeo  
  
He almost made it to the buzzer somehow he gave up in the end  
He put one hand around the other and let that pick up man on in  
It was his last chance to ride it now hell have to move along  
But he knows back in his mind that he wont be away for long  
And its the classic contradiction  
So lets have a hand for that young cowboy and wish him better luck next time  
I hope well see him up in Fargo or somewhere farther down the line
