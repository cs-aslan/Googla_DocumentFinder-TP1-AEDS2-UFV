Well I was ruling the roost had all the chicks to myself  
And suddenly it happened that funny little feeling I felt  
Well I tried to outrun it but it finally caught up with me  
Tell me how can I run from something that I cant see  
  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug  
Nobodys ever seen it but its got the whole world shook up  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug  
Its a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug  
  
Well I always thought that I had me a pretty good style  
But I lost that race by a good old country mile  
Well I was walking all around with my head held way up high  
And it fooled me hit me really took me by surprise  
  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug  
Nobodys ever seen it but its got the whole world shook up  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug  
  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug  
Nobodys ever seen it but its got the whole world shook up  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug  
Its a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug  
  
Its a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug  
Nobodys ever seen it but its got the whole world shook up  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug  
Its a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug  
  
Its a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug
