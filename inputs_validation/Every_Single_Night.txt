Every single night  
I endure the flight  
Of little wings of white flame  
Butterflies in my brain  
These ideas of mine  
Percolate the mind  
Trickle down my spine  
Swarm the belly swelling to a blaze  
Thats where the pain comes in  
Like a second skeleton  
Trying to fit beneath the skin  
I cant fit the feelings in no  
Every single nights alright with my brain  
  
Whatd I say to her  
Whyd I say it to her  
What does she think of me  
That Im not what I ought to be  
That Im what I try not to be  
Its got to be somebody elses fault  
I cant get caught  
If what I am is what I am cause I does what I does  
Then brother get back cause my breasts gonna bust open  
The rib is the shell and the heart is the yolk and  
I just made a meal for us both to choke on  
Every single nights a fight with my brain  
  
I just want to feel everything  
I just want to feel everything  
I just want to feel everything  
  
So Im gonna try to be still now  
Gonna renounce the mill a little while and  
If we had a double kingsized bed  
We could move in it and Id soon forget  
That what I am is what I am cause I does what I does  
And maybe Id relax let my breast just bust open  
My hearts made of parts of all that surround me  
And thats why the devil just cant get around me  
Every single nights alright every single nights a fight  
And every single fights alright with my brain  
  
I just want to feel everything  
I just want to feel everything  
I just want to feel everything  
I just want to feel everything
