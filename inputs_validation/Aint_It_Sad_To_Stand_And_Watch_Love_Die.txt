Aint it sad to stand and watch love die  
Aint it sad to stand and watch love die  
Unfaithful life I took her life in the twinklin of an eye  
And aint it sad to stand and watch love die  
I found her in the arms of my best friend  
And I vowed shes never gonna hurtin me again  
And in a bitter anger I shoot them where they lied  
And the last words she spoke God forgive me then she died  
And aint it sad to stand and watch love die

The neighbors gathered round so they could see  
Oh my God what have you done they started asking me  
So I placed a gun up to my head and this was my reply  
Neighbor aint it sad to stand and watch love die  
Aint it sad to stand and watch love die  
Neighbor aint it sad to stand and watch love die  
Oh aint it sad to stand and watch love die
