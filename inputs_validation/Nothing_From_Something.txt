Things are coming down on me  
They never seem to let it be  
It seems like everything I say just starts another fight  
The pressures building up inside  
  
I gotta let it out tonight  
Shattered glass will cure my ills and make me feel alright  
  
Chorus  
Gonna break it  
And never stop running  
Making nothing from something  
Making nothing from something  
  
Cut me for the lions share  
Its mindless but I dont care  
Cause no matter what I say  
Im in a another fight  
  
Take more shit Ive had enough  
Tonight Im gonna rip it up  
Broken windows cure my ills and make me feel alright  
  
Chorus
