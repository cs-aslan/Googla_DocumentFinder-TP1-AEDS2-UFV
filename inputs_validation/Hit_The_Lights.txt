Its the boy you never told I like you  
Its the girl you let get away  
Its the one you saw that day on the train  
But you freaked out and walked away  
  
Its the plane you wanna catch to Vegas  
Things you swear youll do before you die  
Its the city of love that waits for you  
But youre to damn scared to fly  
  
Hit the lights let the music move you lose yourself tonight  
Come alive let the moment take you lose control tonight  
Hit the lights let the music move you lose yourself tonight  
Come alive let the moment take you lose control tonight  
  
Its the time that you totally screwed up  
Still youre trying to get it out your brain  
Its the fight you had when you didnt make up  
Its the past that youre dying to change  
Its all the money that youre saving  
While the good life passes by  
Its all the dreams that never came true  
Cause youre too damn scared to try Scared to try  
  
Hit the lights let the music move you lose yourself tonight  
Come alive let the moment take you lose control tonight  
Hit the lights let the music move you lose yourself tonight  
Come alive let the moment take you lose control tonight  
  
Its a mad mad world gotta make an escape  
Its a perfect world when you go all the way  
Hit the lights let the music move you lose yourself tonight  
  
So lets go go go go all the way  
Yeah lets go go go go night and day  
From the floor to the rafters people raise your glasses  
We could dance forever  
  
Hit the lights let the music move you lose yourself tonight  
Come alive let the moment take you lose control tonight  
Its a mad mad world gotta make an escape  
Its a perfect world when you go all the way  
Hit the lights let the music move you lose yourself tonight
