Touch touch in the flames desires  
Feeling the pains denial  
And your fingers in the fire  
  
Look look in the candlelight  
See in the flame of life  
And my spell is our lie  
  
Chorus  
Taste the love  
The Lucifers magic that makes you numb  
The passion and all the pain are one  
Youre sleeping in the fire  
Taste the love  
The Lucifers magic that makes you numb  
You feel what it does and youre drunk on love  
Youre sleeping in the fire  
  
I gaze and the flame and fire burn  
And cry out the name of which I yearn  
  
Chorus  
  
Taste the love  
The Lucifers magic that makes you numb  
The passion and all the pain are one  
Youre sleeping in the fire
