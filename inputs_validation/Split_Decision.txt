Whos gonna take the blame tomorrow  
If we break up tonight  
If we break up  
Whos gonna stop this stupid war  
That nobodys gonna win  
The jurys still out on us  
Split decision split in two  
By the things that came between us  
  
So unimportant now  
All of those fights  
Why do we always hurt the ones  
We care the most about  
The jurys still out on us  
Split decision split in two  
By the things that happened  
And the dreams that came apart  
  
Do you still want me in your life  
I need to know so tell me  
Can we still make it in this life  
Or is it too late for us  
How long is time about to wait  
  
Whos gonna say theyre sorry first  
And put this hurt away  
The jurys still out on us  
Split decision  
Split in  
Its not so easy putting back the pieces  
Of a broken heart  
Getting back where we started  
  
Its not so easy picking up the pieces  
Of a broken heart  
And get it back get it back  
Get it back where we started where we started  
Oh oh oh no but if we hold on  
But if we hold on we we can try to make it  
Can try to make it  
Maybe mend this heart and get it back  
Get it back where we started where we started  
Oh oh oh its not so easy its not so easy  
picking up picking up the pieces the iddy bitty pieces  
Of a broken heart  
  
Get it back get it back where we started  
Get it back where we started  
But if we hold on if we hold on  
Were we can try to make it gonna make it  
Maybe mend this heart  
Get it back where we started
