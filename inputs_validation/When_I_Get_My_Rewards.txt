Oh the the night is so still not a baby will cry  
Not a chill wind will blow disturbing the sky  
But theres no peace in me Im burning for you  
Im walking the floor in the devils shoes  
  
When I get my rewards I will bring them to you  
I shall ask for your love and swear mine is true  
Will you cast me aside and see me no more  
How can I win your heart when I get my rewards  
  
They say that your hair can never touch mine  
That a poor boy cant hope for a woman so fine  
But I work till I fall determined to win  
Driven by need to see you again
