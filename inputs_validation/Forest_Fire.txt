She crossed herself as she put on her things  
She has promised once before not to live this way  
If she dont calm down she will burn herself out  
Like a forest fire well doesnt that make you smile  
  
If you dont slow down I swear that Ill come round  
And mess up your place lets go for a spin  
They say we shouldnt even know each other  
And that well be undone  
Dont it make you smile like a forest fire  
  
I believe in love Ill believe in anything  
Thats gonna get me what I want and get me off my knees  
Then well burn your house down dont it feel so good  
Theres a forest fire every time we get together  
  
Hey pick you up put you down  
Rip you up and spin you round  
Just like we said we would  
Cause were a forest fire  
Believe you me well tear this place down  
  
If we get caught in this wind then we could burn the ocean  
If we get caught in this scene were gonna be undone  
Its just a simple metaphor  
Its for a burning love  
Dont it make you smile like a forest fire
