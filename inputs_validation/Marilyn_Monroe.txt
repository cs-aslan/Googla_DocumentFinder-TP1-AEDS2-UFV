Different oh yeah yeah  
This one goes out to all the lovers  
What can we do Were helpless romantics  
We can not help who were attracted to  
So lets all dance and elevate each other  
  
Dear diary its happenin again  
This energy like Im bout to win  
I just close my eyes and visions appear  
Shes everything I want and its crystal clear  
Not even Marilyn Monroe  
Who Cleopatra please  
Not even Joan of Arc  
That dont mean nothin to me  
I just want a different girl  
Girl girl girl girl  
Girl girl cant another good boy keep it this thorough  
  
Why why do I have to lie  
Pretend make believe or hide her  
When I love what Ive described  
But then again I dont need no adjectives for this girl  
  
Dear diary its happenin again  
This energy like Im bout to win

Girl girl girl girl

Whats wrong with that Yeh  
Whats wrong with that  
Whats wrong with that  
  
In honor of the groove and all whos surrendered to it  
We say thank you and we take it back  
  
Wished so hard I wished so hard that it came true  
Then my lucky star I guess you came from behind the moon  
I put my arms around her and I promise not to abuse you  
Since now I found you why the hell would I want to lose you
