Sometimes I get impatient  
Be she cools me without words  
And she comes so softly  
My hummingbird  
And have you heard  
I thought my life had ended  
But I found that its just begun  
Cause she gets me where where I live  
Id give her everything Ive got to give  
All for that hummingbird  
Oh shes little and she loves me  
Too much for words to say  
I see her in the morning sleeping  
Yeah shes little and she loves me  
Its my lucky day  
Hummingbird dont fly away  
When Im feelin wild and lonesome  
She knows just what to say  
She gives me so much understanding  
In her little way  
Lord I gotta say  
In my life Im gonna love no other  
Shes more than I deserve  
She gets me where where I live  
Id give her everything thats mine to give  
All for that hummingbird  
Oh shes little and she loves me  
Too much for words to say  
I see her in the morning sleeping  
Yeah shes little and she loves me  
Its my lucky day  
Hummingbird dont fly away
