Shaolin shadowboxing and the WuTang sword style  
If what you say is true  
The Shaolin and the WuTang could be dangerous  
Do you think your WuTang sword can defeat me  
  
En garde Ill let you try my WuTang style  
  
Chorus  
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus  
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus  
Bring da mother bring da motherfuckin ruckus  
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus  
  
Ghostface catch the blast of a hype verse  
My glock bursts leave in a hearse I did worse  
I come rough tough like an elephant tusk  
Ya head rush fly like Egyptian musk  
Aw shit WuTang Clan spark the wicks an  
However I master the trick just like Nixon  
Causin terror quick damage ya whole era  
Hardrocks is locked the fuck up or found shot  
PLO style hazardous cause I wreck this dangerous  
I blow sparks like Waco Texas  
  
I watch my back like Im locked down hardcore  
Hittin sound watch me act bugged and tear it down  
A literate type asshole songs goin gold no doubt  
And you watch a corny nigga fold  
Yeah they fake and all that  
Carryin gats but yo my Clan  
Rollin like forty Macs  
Now ya act convinced I guess it makes sense  
WuTang yo sew represent  
I wait for one to act up  
Now I got him backed up  
Gun to his neck now react what  
And thats one in the chamber  
WuTang banger 36 styles of danger  
  
Chorus  
  
I rip it hardcore like pornoflick bitches  
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits  
Check it my method on the microphones bangin  
WuTang slangll leave your headpiece hangin  
Bust this Im kickin like Segal Out For Justice  
The roughness yes the rudeness ruckus  
Redrum I verbally assault with the tongue  
Murder one my style shot ya knot like a stungun  
Im hectic I wreck it with the quickness  
Set it on the microphone and competition get blown  
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga the RZA  
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigga  
So bad stabbin up the pad with the vocab crab  
I scream on ya ass like your dad bring it on  
  
Chorus  
  
Yo Im more rugged than slave man boots  
New recruits Im fuckin up MC troops  
I break loops and trample shit while I stomp  
A mud hole in that ass cause Im straight out the swamp  
Creepin up on site now its Fright Night  
My WuTang slang is mad fuckin dangerous  
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe  
Choppin through ya back swish  
Givin bystanders heartattacks  
Niggas try to flip tell me who is him  
I blow up his fuckin prism  
Make it a vicious act of terrorism  
You want to bring it so fuck it  
Come on and bring the ruckus  
And I provoke niggaz to kick buckets  
Im wettin cream I aint wettin fame  
Who sellin gain Im givin out a deadly game  
Its not the Russian its the WuTang crushin  
Roulette slip up and get fucked like Suzette  
Bring da fuckin ruckus  
  
Chorus  
  
So bring it on  
So bring it on  
So bring it on  
So bring it on  
So bring it on  
So bring it on  
So bring it on  
  
Punk nigga
