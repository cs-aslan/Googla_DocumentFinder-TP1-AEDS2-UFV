There are planes coming in  
And theres planes going out  
One piece of luggage  
Goes around and round  
A lady cleans the floors  
A night guard checks his watch  
Theres two lonely faces  
And one of thems the clock  
What crumbs of joy can I steal from this day  
She didnt have the time to call me and say  
If the things Id heard were valid and true  
Ive got everything in the world but you  
Everything in the world but you  
  
I drive against traffic  
People race in to work  
Ive got this expression  
That I know I deserve  
The key slides in the lock  
Whos been here in my bed  
Whos been drinking coffee  
Whats this paper and pen  
  
My nerves are ripped to shreds  
The phone rings on the floor  
But I cant pick it up  
I cant take any more  
There are planes flying in  
And there are planes flying out  
I look up to the sky  
And Im left in no doubt
