Now just look the whole towown  
Has turned out today  
To say a last prayer for me  
And Lord only knows  
How surprised they would be  
If they knew I could see them  
And I could hear what they say  
Whoa if they knew I could see them  
And I could hear what they say  
  
Some say I was a good maan  
Some disagreeeeee  
Some folks are sad  
Soome are glad  
To see the last of meeeee  
I know I was happy maan  
Most of my dayayays  
And through it all  
If I had a time or two  
It was worth it to me  
  
Im the last of my famly  
So Im takin my name  
No children do I leave behiiind  
To sing Rock Of Ages  
For an old warn out cowboy  
You can take away my body  
But the spirit is mine  
Woh you can take away my body yeah  
But the spirit is mine  
  
Some say I was a good maan  
And some disagreeeeee  
Some folks are sad  
And some are glad  
To see the last of meeeee  
I know I was happy maan  
Most of my dayayays  
And through it all  
If I had a time or two  
It was worth it to me  
  
Some say I was a good maan  
Some disagree
