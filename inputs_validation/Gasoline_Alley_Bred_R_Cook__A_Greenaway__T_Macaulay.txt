Woman get your hair out of curlers  
Time to get your butt out of bed  
Get down your hats and your baggage my child  
Goin back home gettin back to the homestead  
  
Im agonna heat me some water  
Put a shine upon my shoes  
Telephone my ma keep the room above Joes  
Cause were coming back coming back to the homestead  
Everything is packed gettin back to the homestead  
This time this time well stay baby  
  
I know that we could have made it  
We had ideas in our heads  
And I wish somehow we could have saved it  
But were Gasoline Alley bred  
Yet the years havent really been wasted  
And I know it in my head  
We did good for the life that weve tasted  
Cause were Gasoline Alley Gasoline Alley bred  
  
Woman you can really believe it  
I did everything a man could do  
Breaking my back just to make us a dime  
That wont mean a damn when no one wants to know you  
  
Woman I know how you feel it  
Ive seen the hurt upon your face  
How many time do you think that Ive cried  
Knowing every day that your heart was getting broken  
Holding back your pride till you were nearly choking  
Oh lets get away baby  
  
I know that we could have made it  
We had ideas in our heads  
And I wish somehow we could have saved it  
But were Gasoline Alley bred  
Yet the years havent really been wasted  
And I know it in my head  
We did good for the life that weve tasted  
Cause were Gasoline Alley Gasoline Alley bred  
  
Gasoline Alley Gasoline Alley Bred  
Gasoline Alley Gasoline Alley Bred  
Gasoline Alley Gasoline Alley Bred  
Gasoline Alley Gasoline Alley Bred
