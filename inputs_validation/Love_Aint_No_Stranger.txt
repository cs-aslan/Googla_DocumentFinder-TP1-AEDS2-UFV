Who knows where the cold wind blows  
I ask my friends but nobody knows  
Who am I to believe in love  
Oh love aint no stranger  
  
I looked around an what did I see  
Broken hearted people staring at me  
All searching cause they still believe  
Oh love aint no stranger  
  
I was alone an I needed love  
So much I sacrificed all I was dreaming of  
I heard no warning but a heart can tell  
Id feel the emptiness of love I know so well  
  
Love aint no stranger  
I aint no stranger  
Love aint no stranger  
I aint no stranger to love no no no  
  
Cant hold the passion of a soul in need  
I look for mercy when my heart begins to bleed  
I know good loving an Im a friend of pain  
But when I read between the lines its all the same  
  
Love aint no stranger  
I aint no stranger  
Love aint no stranger  
I aint no stranger to love  
  
So who knows where the cold wind blows  
I ask my friends but nobody knows  
Who am I to believe in love  
Lord have mercy  
Love aint no stranger  
I aint no stranger  
  
I was alone an I needed love  
So much I sacrificed all I was dreaming of  
Cant hold the passion of a soul in need  
I look for mercy when my heart begins to bleed  
  
Love aint no stranger  
I aint no stranger  
Love aint no stranger  
I aint no stranger to love  
  
Love aint no stranger  
Love aint no stranger  
I aint no stranger
