You talk too much  
You talk too much  
You talk too much to me  
  
Dear father dont mother me  
Dear mother dont bother me  
If I ever needed your advice oh  
I would have called you on the telephone  
Ive been wrong maybe once or twice  
And thats when I was listenin to you  
  
You talk too much  
You talk too much  
You talk too much to me  
  
Dear preacher you wont reach me  
Dear teacher dont preach to me  
If I ever needed your advice oh  
I would have called you on the telephone  
Ive only been wrong maybe once or twice  
And thats when I was listenin to you  
  
Oh shut up  
  
You talk too much  
You talk too much  
You talk too much oh yeah
