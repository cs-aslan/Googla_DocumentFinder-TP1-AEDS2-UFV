When paradise is no longer fit for you to live in  
And your adolescent dreams are gone  
Through the days you feel a little used up  
And you dont know where your energys gone wrong  
Its just your soul feelin a little downhearted  
Sometimes life is too ridiculous to live  
You count your friends all on one finger  
I know it sounds crazy just the way that we live  
  
Between a laugh and a tear  
Smile in the mirror as you walk by  
Between a laugh and a tear  
And thats as good as it can get for us  
And there aint no reason to stop tryin  
  
When this cardboard town can no longer amuse you  
You see through everything and nothin seems worthwhile  
And hypocrite used to be such a big word to you  
And it dont seem to mean anything to you now  
Just try to live each and every precious moment  
Dont be discouraged by the future forget the past  
Thats old advise but itll be good to you  
I know theres a balance see it when I swing past  
  
Between a laugh and a tear  
Smile in the mirror as you walk by  
Between a laugh and a tear  
And thats as good as it can get for us  
And there aint no reason to stop tryin  
  
Between a laugh and a tear  
Smile in the mirror as you walk by  
Between a laugh and a tear  
And thats as good as it can get for us  
And there aint no reason to stop tryin  
  
When paradise can no longer amuse you
