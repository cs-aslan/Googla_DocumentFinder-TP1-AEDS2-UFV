You wont take my love for tender  
You can put your money where your mouth is  
But youre so unsure  
I could be a miser or a big spender  
But you might get much more than you bargained for  
Check in on a checkmate  
Grassing on a classmate  
So beautiful and fortunate  
Youre the one who hates to love  
But hes the one who loves to hate  
He can fix you all for good  
Because he is the neighbourhood  
You can get money for blood  
Blood money for doing no good  
  
Better tell me now have you made your selection  
Are you ready for correction  
Cause the wages of sin are an expensive infection  
Itll make you bankrupt  
Better pay up now dont interrupt  
So in love Im so sincere  
Just like a wellknown financier  
You know Ive never been corrupt  
  
Ill pay you a compliment  
And youll think I am innocent  
You can total up the balance sheet  
And never know if Im a counterfeit  
You wont take my love for tender
