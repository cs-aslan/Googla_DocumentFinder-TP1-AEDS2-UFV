Well there will be times  
When the memories fade  
There will be words weve said  
We just cant take away  
Im only saying  
That as time goes sailing on  
Nothing is forgotten baby  
Nothing is really gone  
I remember the nights in Estoril  
A kiss and oh the never ending thrill  
And I remember the coming storm  
Oh and you my love how you kept me warm  
Well there will be times  
When we cant agree  
We cant help but see things  
A little differently  
Im only saying  
That as time goes sailing on  
How can something so right  
Ever be wrong  
I remember the nights in Estoril  
A kiss and oh the never ending thrill  
And I remember the coming storm  
Oh and you my love how you kept me warm  
Your hand reaching out to me  
Dark clouds gathering in their wake  
Ive seen it all before  
But Ive never felt it more  
This time there is no mistake  
Oh I remember  
And I remember the coming storm  
Oh and you my love how you kept me warm  
I remember the nights in Estoril  
A kiss and oh the never ending thrill  
And I remember the coming storm  
Oh and you my love how you kept me warm  
I remember  
Remember
