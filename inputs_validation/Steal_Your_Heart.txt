I dont mean to be the teardrop spilling over your resentments  
Dont intend to be the cry with which you voice your discontent  
I dont wanna be a picture fading slowly from your memory  
Dont intend to be a shadow simply darkening your passage  
Only wanna lose myself behind the mirror of your eyes  
Be the only balm that soothes the secret passions in your life  
Only want to lose my senses lose your sorrow calm this madness  
Be the only one you count on to alleviate your sadness  
Ill steal your heart and set it free  
Tear down the walls that would surround you  
I may hold you close to me  
But these ties will never bind you  
I dont mean to be the fire thats igniting your temptations  
Dont intend to be the sword that runs you through with adoration  
I dont want to be a whisper my emotions wrapped in silence  
Dont intend to be the shout reminding you that time is priceless  
Only want to be the wind that lifts you high above the ground  
Living only to unleash the sacred powers that weve found  
Only want to breathe your essence be your comfort fill with laughter  
Every moment that we live from this day on forever after  
Ill steal your heart and set it free  
So free Im sure it will astound you  
Without my love youll never be  
In some way Ill always find you  
Ill steal your heart and set it free  
Tear down the walls that would surround you  
I may hold you close to me  
But these ties will never bind you  
Only want to be the wind that lifts you high above the ground  
Living only to unleash the sacred powers that weve found  
Only want to breathe your essence be your comfort fill with laughter  
Every moment that we live from this day on forever after  
Ill steal your heart and set it free  
So free Im sure it will astound you  
Without my love youll never be  
In some way Ill always find you  
Ill steal your heart and set it free  
Tear down the walls that would surround you  
I may hold you close to me  
But these ties will never bind you  
Ill steal your heart and set it free
