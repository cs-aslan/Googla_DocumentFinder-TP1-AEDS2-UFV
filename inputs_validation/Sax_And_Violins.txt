Falling falling  
Gonna drop like a stone  
Im falling through the atmosphere  
On a warm afternoon  
If lovers discover  
That everyone dies  
So dont tell me please hold me  
Its a dangerous life  
  
Daddy dear  
Lets get outta here  
Im scared  
Ten oclock  
Nighttime in New York  
Its weird  
  
If youre looking for trouble  
Well thats what you will find  
  
Mom and Pop  
They will fuck you up  
For sure  
Love so deep  
Kills you in your sleep  
Its true  
  
Love keeps us together  
And love keeps us alive  
  
And we  are criminals that never  
broke no laws  
And all  we needed was a net  
to break our fall  
  
Theyre searching for diamonds  
Theyre grabbin at straws  
Sex n sin  
Sax n violins  
Its hell  
Wooden heads  
Furniture with legs  
For sale  
  
Love keeps us together  
And love will drive us insane  
  
And we  are criminals that never  
broke no laws  
And all  we needed was a net  
to break our fall  
  
Going home  
Back where I belong  
To stay  
Rays of light  
They will turn the light  
To day  
  
Birds travel together  
Birds follow the sun  
And I  am watching as the birds go flying home
