Its true you got me wrapped around your finger  
Ah honey it seems thats where I belong  
You know how to hold me thrill me and control me  
Just enough just enough to keep me hangin on  
Ah honey just enough just enough to keep me hangin on  
  
My heart is like a yoyo string  
Im tied to you Im tied to you right or wrong  
My love keeps on growing  
Cause your love keeps right on showing  
Just enough just enough to keep me hangin on  
Oh baby just enough just enough to keep me hangin on  
  
A love as true as mine will make you do most anything  
Like hiding tears and heartaches  
And dreaming all those silly dreams  
Ah honey you got me you got me where you want me  
And you keep me stringing along  
  
Just enough just enough to keep me hangin on  
Ah baby just enough just enough to keep me hangin on  
Ah honey just enough just enough to keep me hangin on  
Oh tell me why just enough
