Here I come  
  
Do you think I could ever care  
Bout a girl whos never there  
Do you think I could ever care  
Bout a girl whos never there  
I saw her on the subway  
Saw her on the Dtrain  
Saw her in the afternoon  
After all the Giants games  
Saw her on the freeway  
Saw her on a highway  
Gimme a break I need a Yellow Cab  
Help me get outta this rain  
  
Do you think I could ever care  
Bout a girl whos almost never there  
Do you think the clothes she wears  
Would change my mind  
Or turn my hair  
I saw her on a freeway  
Saw her on a Atrain  
Saw her hangin out  
On 52nd and Broad  
Saw her on a highway  
Saw her on a skyway  
Ahhhh need a Yellow Cab Ronnie  
Let me get outta the rain  
  
Yeah ghead  
Good job  
Yeah  
  
I saw her on a highway  
On a Dtrain  
I saw her eatin a pizza  
On 75th and Broadway  
Saw her on a subway  
On a biplane  
Ahh Im getting tired o this shit  
I need a Yellow Cab  
Help me get outta this rain  
  
Do you think I could ever care  
Bout a girl whos almost never there  
Do you think could ever care  
Bout a girl who cares about thethe clothes she wears  
Do you think I could ever care  
Bout a girl that even dyes her hair  
  
The song  
Do you think  
Whooo  
Oh no  
Whooo  
  
Ohhh do you think I would really care  
Bout a woman whos never there  
Do you think Id ever care  
Bout a woman the clothes she wears  
  
Bout a girl whos hardly ever there  
Whooo Whooo  
Well thats alright  
Whooo
