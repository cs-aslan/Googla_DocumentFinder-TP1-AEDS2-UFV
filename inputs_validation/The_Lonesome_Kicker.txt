Me Im the Lonesome Kicker  
Extra points field goals at your service  
One might think it comes with glory  
You might think different after you listen to my story  
  
My helmet is equipped with a tiny face mask  
What it possibly could protect I do not know  
The other guys on the team  
Like to make fun of my little shoulder pads  
And also like to hide the special shoe  
I need to kick in the snow  
  
People think its so easy  
To kick a field goal from the 30 yard line  
They forget to add seven yards for the snap  
And 10 more cause the goal posts are pushed way back  
  
In 1974 the uprights were right on the goal line  
But some of the players were running into them  
And getting hurt  
So screw the kicker  
Who cares about the kicker  
  
But I kick that ball  
And I pray it goes straight  
If it does  
The coach says Good job number 8  
He doesnt even know my name is  
Andre Kristacovitchlalinski Jr  
But thats the life I live  
The Lonesome Kicker  
  
Kickoffs can be so very scary  
Especially if the returner breaks on through  
And Im the only guy on the playing field left to tackle him  
I dont want to get hurt  
So I pretend to tie my shoe  
  
Once again Im ignored by my teammates and all my coaches  
Go back where you came from  
Scream 70000 fans  
Well I know I could win their love back  
By catching a winning touchdown  
But unfortunately I was born with these very small hands  
  
And I hope that the cameras dont come in too close  
Cause they might see the tears in my eyes  
As I sit on this bench made of coldhearted wood  
And the splinters go deep in my thighs  
And the towel boy snickers as he walks by  
The Lonesome Kicker  
  
Another blocked kick  
And everybody blames me  
But it was the Left Guard  
Who didnt pick up his man  
Oh why cant they see  
  
In my home country  
I could have been a minor league soccer player  
But I came to America  
Seeking fortune and seeking fame  
I didnt realize that if I shanked one  
And blew the point spread  
Some drunk guys would push me into their hibachi  
After the game  
  
So I go home at night  
Cause I never get invited  
To go drinking with the other guys  
And I sit in my chair and I soak my foot  
As I eat a plate of cold french fries  
And my wifes out with her quoteunquote friend  
And my son cant look me in the eyes  
But thats the life I live  
The Lonesome Kicker  
  
Kicking for you  
They took my snow shoe  
Theyre going for two
