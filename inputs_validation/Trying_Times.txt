If my feet dont fail and my heart gets well  
Ill be out of here by noon  
Packin my load on the road  
You can color me gone  
  
Settlin in for a long hard ride  
Miss you sittin on the shotgun side  
Difficult journey when your navigator is gone  
  
Its Trying times when the Ill winds blow  
Trying times when the rivers wont flow  
Trying times when the heartbreak starts to show  
Trying times when the going gets tough  
Trying times when you pack it all up  
Trying times when you lose somebody you love  
Lose somebody you love  
  
The suns coming up on the Interstate now  
In the eastboud lane Im facin the crowd  
Wishing I could jump up out of this traffic and fly  
Got a pain in my heart and Im flat on my back  
Like a blind horse walkin down a railroad track  
I didnt know nothing till the train came whistlin by  
  
Its Trying times when the Ill winds blow  
Trying times when the rivers wont flow  
Trying times when the heartbreak starts to show  
Trying times when the going gets tough  
Trying times when you pack it all up  
Trying times when you lose somebody you love  
Lose somebody you love Repeat 3x
