Even when youre lifted by the lie  
Heaven sent and giftedask them why  
Never give it all upnever try  
All their hearts are breaking  
Unspirited  
The less than life you live  
The lessons make you lame boy  
The same boy  
Everywhere that you go Im with you now  
When you lose it all youll think of me  
When you take the fall youll drink to me  
Im the one who did it painlessly  
Im the one that does it  
Unspirited
