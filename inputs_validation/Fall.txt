Let me tell you a story  
About a girl and a boy  
He fell in love with his best friend when shes around  
He feels nothing but joy  
But she was already broken  
And it made her blind  
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right  
But did you know that I loved you  
Or were you not aware  
Well youre the smile on my face  
And I aint going nowhere  
Im here to make you happy  
Im here to see you smile  
But Ive been wanting to tell you this for a long while  
  
Whos gonna make you fall  
In love  
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart  
Dont have to be scared at all oh my love  
But you cant fly unless you let your  
You cant fly unless you let yourself fall  
  
Well I can tell youre afraid of  
What this might do  
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you dont wanna lose  
Well I dont wanna lose it either  
But I dont think I can stay sitting around while youre hurting babe  
So take my hand  
Well did you know youre an angel  
Who forgot how to fly  
And did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry  
Cause I know that it piece of you is gone every time he done wrong  
Im the shoulder youre crying on  
And I hope by the time that Im done with this song I figure out  
  
Whats gonna make you fall in love  
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart  
You dont have to be scared at all oh my love  
But you cant fly unless you let your  
You cant fly unless you let yourself fall  
  
I will catch you if you fall  
I will catch you if you fall  
Well I will catch you if you fall  
And if you spread your wings  
You can fly away with me  
But you cant fly unless you let your  
You cant fly unless you let yourself fall  
  
In love  
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart  
Dont have to be scared at all oh my love  
But you cant fly unless you let your  
Let yourself fall oh baby
