No he is not extraspecial  
At time he stress another face in the clouds  
But each time he smiles thats when I stumble  
Im so proud hes the one that I love  
Refrain  
Oh hes good hes my boy  
True his strength I could not explain just  
Why I loved him  
Yes he may be so oldfashioned  
At times he dresses in a way out of style  
Oh each time he holds me and thats when I stumble  
Im so proud hes the one that I love  
Repeat Refrain  
Hes my boy  
I could not explain just  
Why I loved him  
Yeah hes not rich neither handsome  
Then Im not myself a queen nor a star  
Oh but I know for sure  
I know that he cares for me  
Im so proud hes the one  
Im so glad Im the girl that he chooses to have  
Im so proud hes the one  
Hes the one that I love
