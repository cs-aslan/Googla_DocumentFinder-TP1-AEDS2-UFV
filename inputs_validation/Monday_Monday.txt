Monday Monday  
So good to me  
Monday Monday  
It was all I hoped it would be  
  
Oh Monday morning  
Monday morning couldnt guarantee  
That Monday evening  
You would still be here with me  
  
Monday Monday  
Cant trust that day  
Monday Monday  
Sometimes it just turns out that way  
  
On Monday morning  
You gave me no warning  
Of what was to be  
On Monday Monday  
How could you leave  
And not take me  
  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Of the week is fine yeah  
  
But whenever Monday comes  
But whenever Monday comes  
You can find me crying  
All of the time  
  
Monday Monday  
So good to me  
Monday Monday  
It was all I hoped it would be  
Oh Monday morning  
Monday morning couldnt guarantee  
That Monday evening  
You would still be here with me  
  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Of the week is fine yeah  
  
But whenever Monday comes  
But whenever Monday comes  
You can find me crying  
All of the time  
  
Monday Monday  
Cant trust that day  
Monday Monday  
Just turns out that way  
  
Oh Monday Monday  
Dont go away  
Oh Monday Monday  
Its here to stay  
Monday Monday  
Oh dont go away
