A Rose and a Baby Ruth  
Doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo  
  
We had a quarrel  
A teenage quarrel  
Now Im as blue as I know how to be  
I cant call you on the phone  
I cant even see you at your home  
  
So Im sending you this present  
Just to prove that Im telling the truth  
Dear I believe you wont laugh when you receive  
This rose and a Baby Ruth  
  
Doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo ahh  
  
I could have sent you an orchid of some kind  
But thats all I had in my jeans at the time  
  
But when we grow up  
Some day Ill show up  
Just to prove I was telling the truth  
Ill kiss you too then Ill hand to you  
This rose and a Baby Ruth  
  
Doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo
