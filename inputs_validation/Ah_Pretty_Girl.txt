Ah pretty girl  ah pretty girl  
Just you and me pretty girl  
No ones gonna see pretty girl  
Well I feel so good when you hold me tight  
So lets make love till the broad daylight  
Cause I love you mmm pretty girl  
Dont you be so tame pretty girl  
You drive me insane pretty girl  
Everytime your lips meet mine  
A funny chill runs up my spine  
Cause I love you mmm pretty girl  
Come on let me hold you let me squeeze you tight  
Let my arms unfold you youre mine tonight  
Just you and me pretty girl  
No ones gonna see pretty girl  
Well I feel so good when you hold me tight  
So lets make love till the broad daylight  
Cause I love you men pretty girl
