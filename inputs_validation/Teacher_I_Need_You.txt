I was sitting in the classroom  
Trying to look intelligent  
In case the teacher looked at me  
She was long and she was lean  
Shes a middleaged dream  
And that lady means the whole world to me  
  
Its a natural achievement  
Conquering my homework  
With her image pounding in my brain  
Shes an inspiration  
For my graduation  
And she helps to keep the classroom sane  
  
Oh teacher I need you  
Like a little child  
You got something in you  
To drive a schoolboy wild  
  
You give me education  
In the lovesick blues  
Help me get straight come out and say  
Teacher I teacher I teacher I  
Teacher I need you  
  
I have to write a letter  
Tell about my feelings  
Just to let her know the scene  
Focus my attention  
On some further education  
In connection with the birds and the bees  
  
So Im sitting in the classroom  
Im looking like a zombie  
Im waiting for the bell to ring  
Ive got John Wayne stances  
Ive got Erroll Flynn advances  
And it doesnt mean a doggone thing
