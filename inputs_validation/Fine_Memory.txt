Last night I saw you walking  
Past my bed late at night  
And the moon shone  
Through your gown  
Such a fine memory  
I think Im gonna take it with me  
And later as you were sleeping  
Sleeping next to me  
I felt your hair on my skin  
Such a fine memory  
I know Im gonna take it with me  
Im going to take it  
Far as I go  
Im going to take it  
Far as I go  
And later as I was driving  
And the sky was getting light  
And the sun came  
Through the trees  
I had a fine memory  
Such a fine memory
