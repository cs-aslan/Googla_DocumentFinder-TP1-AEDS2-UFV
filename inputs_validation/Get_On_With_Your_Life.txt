I went around to your house  
Found you laid up in the bed  
By early afternoon you were so sloppy drunk  
You couldnt even raise up your head  
  
So get on with your life baby  
Please let me get on with mine  
These days and your ways are so painful  
Youre just wasting all our precious time ohhh  
  
Since first I knew your name  
I wasnt sure that you really cared  
Spent most of your time with the other boys  
And its been all down hill from there  
  
So get on with your life baby  
Please let me get on with mine  
Each day brings a new confusion  
Another way to break this poor heart of mine  
  
I cant begin to count the times that Ive told ya  
You better change all your wicked ways  
But Im real sure whatever the number  
Ah its the same as the times you laughed in my face  
  
Wont somebody please wake me from this bad dream  
I remember my grandmama told me  
Things aint always what they seem  
  
So get on with your life baby  
Please let me get on with mine  
Cause each day brings another confusion  
Its about to break this poor heart of mine  
Ohha gonna lose my only mind oh baby  
Dont you break this poor heart of mine
