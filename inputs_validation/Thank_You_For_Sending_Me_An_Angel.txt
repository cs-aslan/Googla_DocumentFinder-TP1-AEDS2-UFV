Oh Oh baby you can walk you can talk just like me  
You can walk you can talk just like me  
You can look tell me what you see  
You can look you wont see nothing like me  
If you look around the world  
  
Oh baby you can walk you can talk just like me  
With a little practice you can walk like talk just like me  
If thats what you want to do  
Well you can look youll walk in circles around me  
But first Ill walk in circles round you  
But first Ill walk around the world  
  
Im walking round the world  
Iyou can  
But first show me what you do
