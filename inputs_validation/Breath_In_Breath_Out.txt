feat Ludacris  
Hook Ludacris  
Yeah breathe in breathe out  
If ya iced up pull ya sleeves out  
Push a big truck pull ya keys out  
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out  
Breathe in breathe out  
Let them hoes fight pull her weave out  
If a nigga act up pull a Desert Es out  
When I pull the piece out niggas like Peace out  
Verse 1 Kanye West  
Golly more of that bullshit ice rap  
I got to pologize to Mos and Kweli probably  
But is it cool to rap about gold  
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali Mali  
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack  
Ice chain Cardi lens and a knapsack  
Always said if I rapped Id say somethin significant  
But now Im rappin bout money hoes and rims again  
And its still about the Benjamins  
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms  
Strippers named Cinnamon  
More chips than Pentium  
Whatcha gon buy next Whatever new trend it is  
Im tryin to spend my stacks  
And Im so broke I look back like Damn was I on crack  
I mean twelve platinum chains was I on that  
What the hell was wrong with me dog  
Sing along with my yall

Yeah breathe in breathe out  
If ya iced up pull ya sleeves out  
Push a big truck pull ya keys out  
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out  
Breathe in breathe out  
Let them hoes fight pull her weave out  
If a nigga act up pull a Desert Es out  
When I pull the piece out niggas like Peace out  
Verse 2 Kanye West  
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick  
I always had a Ph D a Pretty Huge dick  
Ladies tired of gettin ripped off by guys like
