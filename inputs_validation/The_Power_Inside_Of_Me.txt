Seek and you shall find what you may already have  
Sometimes its your own shadow standing in your path  
I have spent my life with a vision of myself  
But I may have been somebody somebody else  
I feel a change in the tide  
As I hold my heart open wide  
  
Never  
Knew what I could be  
I never felt the power inside of me  
Now I stand in all the wonder  
That the mirror couldnt see  
I have the power inside of me yeah  
I have the power inside of me  
  
Every time I held a rose I only felt the thorns  
I feel like todays the day I finally was born  
Now that I see me through these eyes  
I can do more than fantasize  
Never  
Knew what I could be  
I never felt the power inside of me  
Now I stand in all the wonder  
That the mirror couldnt see  
I have the power inside of me oh woah  
Inside of me  
Inside of me  
Yeah
