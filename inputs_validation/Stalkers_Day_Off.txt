Ive been hanging around just in case you fall in love with me  
I know you have doubts I hear when you shout  
cause I understand you see  
  
I was concerned when youre sad  
Youd rather wake up dead to spend a day with me  
I know thats not you I know and its true  
They dont understand you like I do  
  
Ive been hanging around just in case you fall in love with me  
I know you have doubts I hear when you shout  
cause I understand you see  
  
Hi Its me again  
Yeah I got out on parole  
Yeah erm erm you can just er pick up the phone  
d like to talk to you please  
  
Ive seen misery and have a strange empathy  
With a woman who kidnaps her lover  
This love aint a dream I know its obscene  
The calls that I left for your mother  
  
Ive been hanging around just in case you fall in love with me  
I know you have doubts I hear when you shout  
cause I understand you see  
  
I love you too And erm perhaps one day we can meet  
Face to face this time  
Ha Im sorry about that letter I sent you  
The newspaper cuttings and stuffs and blood ha
