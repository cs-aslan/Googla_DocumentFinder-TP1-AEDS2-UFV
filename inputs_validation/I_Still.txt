Who are you now  
Are you still the same  
Or did you change somehow  
What do you do  
At this very moment when I think of you  
And when Im looking back  
How we were young and stupid  
Do you remember that  
  
No matter how I fight it  
Cant deny it  
Just cant let you go  
  
I still need you  
I still care about you  
Though everythings been said and done  
I still feel you  
Like Im right beside you  
But still no word from you  
  
Now look at me  
Instead of moving on I refuse to see  
That I keep coming back  
And Im stuck in a moment  
That wasnt meant to last to last  
  
Ive tried to fight it  
Cant deny it  
You dont even know  
  
That I still need you  
I still care about you  
Though everythings been said and done  
I still feel you  
Like Im right beside you  
But still no word from you  
  
No no  
I wish I could find you  
Just like you found me  
Then I would never let you go without you  
  
Though everythings been said and done yeah  
I still feel you I still feel you  
Like Im right beside you like Im right beside you  
But still no still no word word from you
