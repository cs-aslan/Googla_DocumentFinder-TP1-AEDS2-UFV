1  Shorty you keep playin with my mind  
You tease me all the time but I had enough  
Maybe I should ask your girlfriends why  
Why you are so afraid to fall in love  
  
Girl I wont get next to you  
You know I dont like sweatin you  
But something bout the way you make me feel  
You got me in this fantasy  
And all my friends keep tellin me  
Shortys kinda hot so whats the deal  
  
2  Cuz we been spendin rollin livin showin  
We got some time for play  
But youve been player hatin waitin  
For this rhyme to pass away  
  
Repeat 1  
  
You only get the best with me  
I wanna give you everything  
And anything you ask of me I will  
And I dont want to front on you  
So tell me what you wanna do  
And if Im not the one  
Just keep it real  
  
Repeat 2  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Keith Murray  
Now first of all baby whats my name  
Spell it backwards you read game  
Im known for splittin wigs and readin brains  
And when I say splittin wigs and readin brains  
I mean breakin it down conversationwise  
Let me explain  
  
Im in your corner girl be on my team  
Together we could fulfill each others life dream  
We both Gemini so we got 2 sides  
Our zodiac sign is the perfect sign  
Cuz she replied All Geminis lie  
I guess this is what it feels like when doves cry  
Your attitude is deep cover  
Wont give me the number  
Cold play me out like a foul a bleep or a blunder  
Its like a burnin in the chest a cardiac arrest  
You look like you havin fun puttin me thru stress  
So in between time and in the meantime  
You do your thing and I do mine  
But dont play wit my mind  
  
Shorty shorty  
Wont you please get naughty with me  
And if you really wanna  
I can be your fantasy  
You are so afraid oh baby  
  
Repeat 1 until fade
