I just got into this town  
But it already seems such a bore  
Not what you call a small town  
But Ive seen a hundred like it before  
  
So dont try to take advantage  
I just want you to show me the sights  
My temperatures up my energys high  
Gonna cause an explosion tonight  
  
Chorus  
Show me around Im looking for a lover  
Show me around Ive seen it all before  
Show me around Im searching for a brother  
Going over the top and I sure as hell aint going alone  
  
Im not staying forever  
Just long enough to see a little more  
I might be new to this place  
But I aint new to the score  
  
So dont try to take advantage  
Thought I aint one for acting coy  
Im gonna dress up  
Im gonna show you tonight  
That I aint no country boy  
  
Chorus  
  
So dont try to take advantage  
I just want you to show me the sights  
My temperatures up my energys high  
Gonna cause an explosion tonight
