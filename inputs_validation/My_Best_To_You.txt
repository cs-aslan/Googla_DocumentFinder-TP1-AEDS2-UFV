So heres to you  
May your dreams come true  
May old father time  
Never be unkind  
And through the years  
Save your smiles and your tears  
Theyre just souvenirs  
Theyll make music in your heart  
Remember this  
Each new day is a kiss  
Sent from up above  
With an angels love  
So heres to you  
May your skies be blue  
And your love blessed  
Thats my best to you  
  
Remember this  
Each new day is a kiss  
Sent from up above  
With an angels love  
So heres to you  
May your skies be blue  
And your love blessed  
Thats my very best to you
