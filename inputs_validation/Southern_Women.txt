Im the kind of man that loves all the girls  
From debutantes to honkytonk queens  
Ive tasted every brand all around the world  
But all I see are peaches in my dreams  
Im talkin bout Im talkin bout them southern women  
Its a well known fact across the Dixie line  
And if a man dont agree I can tell you hes blind  
They can drink with the best and the hell with the rest  
And if she takes you home you aint gettin no rest  
  
Chorus  
Im talkin bout Im talkin bout them southern women  
Im talkin bout theyll love you so slow them southern women  
  
Them southern girls  
They look like angels on Saturday night ohlord they got a wild side  
Take you places that youve never been make a man come back again  
Talk about mamas southern belle little girl learned her lesson well  
Aint no others can cast a spell like the sweet southern women  
  
Chorus  
  
They can make a man feel so proud they can capture him with a southern style  
Little girl learned her lesson well aint no others can cast a spell  
Like the sweet southern women them southern girls
