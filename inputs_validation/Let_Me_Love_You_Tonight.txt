Its midnight  And I dont want to see you leaving  
Thought of you  going back  back to him  is killing me  
Baby please  how can you torture my heart  
We both know  where we belong  
we belong here in each others arms  
  
Chorus  
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing  
Cant deny the forces that you feel within  
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing  
Let me love you tonight  
Let me love you tonight  
  
if you  
Go well never know  what tomorrow brings  
Got to be a way to end this  suffering  
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing  
Let me love you tonight  
Let me love you tonight  
  
Baby I  I dont want to see you hurtingno more  
Gotta do whats right  cause we cant  cant go on  
like this anymore  
Im on my knees  you know its over with him  
So why go back  when all that you need  
You know that its right here with me  
  
Chorus  
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing  
Cant deny the forces that you feel within  
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing  
Let me love you tonight  
Let me love you tonight  
  
if you  
Go Well never know  what tomorrow brings  
Got to be a way to end this  suffering  
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing  
Let me love you tonight  
Let me love you tonight
