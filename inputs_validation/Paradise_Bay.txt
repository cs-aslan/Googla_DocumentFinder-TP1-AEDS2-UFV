Lay your hand upon my shoulder say something  
That I want to hear  
Time will wash out every trace of sadness  
If only you are near  
Ive tried so hard just to be somebody  
But now Im found  
And we can be together  
And travel far away  
And we can love forever  
In some old paradize bay  
Carry me oh bring me out of fantasy  
And tell me this is real  
Tell me that you wont give up  
And tell me its a good thing to feel  
The wind is carrying your voice  
The message is  dont ever walk away   
And the only answer I can give to you  
Is that Im always gonna stay
