Need a reason to be here hoping to find it tonight  
Walking alone on Broadway watching the people watching the town go down  
Broadways a river to me fat fish in the big city sea taxi cabs limousines
submarines  
  
Got my mind on a sweet dream keeping an eye on this street scene  
Cause Im open for love in the middle of town tonight  
Had my fill of selfpity I brought all my blues to the city  
Guess Im pressing my luck in the middle of town tonight  
See me waiting on you to smile back on me child  
  
It looks like tomorrow it seems like the end of a dream  
Dawning on me on Broadway in the morning light its a dream  
And Im just a fool looking for love on Broadway
