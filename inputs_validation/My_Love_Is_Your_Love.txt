Clap your hands yall its alright  
  
If tomorrow is judgment day Sing Mommy  
And Im standing on the front line  
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life  
I will say I spent it with you  
  
If I wake up in World War III  
I see destruction and poverty  
And I feel like I want to go home  
Its okay if youre coming with me  
  
Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldnt hold us  
Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldnt hold us  
  
If I lose my fame and fortune  
And Im homeless on the street  
And Im sleeping in Grand Central Station  
Its okay if youre sleeping with me  
  
As the years they pass us by  
We stay young through each others eyes  
And no matter how old we get  
Its okay as long as I got you baby  
  
Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldnt hold us  
Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldnt hold us  
  
If I should die this very day  
Dont cry cause on Earth we werent meant to stay  
And no matter what the people say  
Ill be waiting for you after the judgment day  
  
Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldnt hold us  
Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldnt hold us
