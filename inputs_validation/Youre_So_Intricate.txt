Like I said  
Leave your baggage at the back door  
Im leaving you the way I think it should be  
Were always pulling into spaces that we cant back out of  
Starting fights we cant talk our way out of them  
How does it feel to be on the receiving end of this one  
This night will swell with us this night will run with us  
This is our last surviving chance I wanna survive 2x s  
Feast your eyes swell with us I dont care  
Ill fantasize of being manic  
And leaving us behind  
In your eyes you were the one that tried  
Acceptance is what holds us here  
And you my dear are the one I fear tonight  
Well try just one more time  
This is the moment that we all live for  
Are you ready Are you ready  
This night will swell with us this night will run with us  
This is our last surviving chance I wanna survive 2x s  
Feast your eyes run with us I dont care I dont care I dont care  
And Ill never care  
I cant see past your waving hand  
Just running away again  
I cant see past your waving hand  
Just running away again  
You think so loud it hurts my ears  
I wanna know how to get through this how to get  
Through this with out choking up 2x s  
I cant feel you your so far from me
