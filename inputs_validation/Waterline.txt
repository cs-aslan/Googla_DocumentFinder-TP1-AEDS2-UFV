Well it used to be everything was fine  
Everything this all was mine  
All I had to do was write it down  
Youd just be there with your perfect frown  
I made up my mind  
I traded holy water for cheap wine  
I ran out of time  
Well it used to be everything was fine  
Everything this all was mine  
But one fine day you might say  
That I I threw it all away  
cause I made up my mind  
I traded holy water for cheap wine  
I ran out of time  
Or something that I cant define  
I traded my whiskey for your wine  
Leaving my river running dry  
And a waterline  
You might say Im wasting my time  
You might say well I dont mind  
I ran out of time  
Or something that I cant define  
I traded holy water for cheap wine  
Leaving my river running dry  
Leaving just a waterline  
Just a waterline
