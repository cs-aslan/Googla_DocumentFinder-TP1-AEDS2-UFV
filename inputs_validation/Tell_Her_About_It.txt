Listen boy  
Dont want to see you let a good thing  
Slip away  
  
You know I dont like watching  
Anybody make the same mistakes  
I made  
  
Shes a real nice girl  
And shes always there for you  
But a nice girl wouldnt tell you what you should do  
  
Listen boy  
Im sure that you think you got it all  
Under control  
  
You dont want somebody telling you  
The way to stay in someones soul  
  
Youre a big boy now  
Youll never let her go  
But thats just the kind of thing  
She ought to know  
  
Tell her about it  
Tell her everything you feel  
Give her every reason to accept  
That youre for real  
  
Tell her about it  
Tell her all your crazy dreams  
Let her know you need her  
Let her know how much she means  
  
Listen boy  
Its not automatically a certain guarantee  
To insure yourself  
Youve got to provide communication constantly  
  
When you love someone  
Youre always insecure  
And theres only one good way  
To reassure  
  
Tell her about it  
Let her know how much you care  
When she cant be with you  
Tell her you wish you were there  
  
Tell her about it  
Every day before you leave  
Pay her some attention  
Give her something to believe  
  
Cause now and then  
Shell get to worrying  
Just because you havent spoken  
For so long  
Though you may not have done anything  
Will that be a consolation when shes gone  
  
Listen boy  
Its good information from a man  
Whos made mistakes  
  
Just a word or two that she gets from you  
Could be the difference that it makes  
  
Shes a trusting soul  
Shes put her trust in you  
But a girl like that wont tell you  
What you should do  
  
Tell her about it  
Tell her everything you feel  
Give her every reason  
To accept that youre for real  
  
Tell her about it  
Tell her all your crazy dreams  
Let her know you need her  
Let her know how much she means  
  
Tell her about it  
Tell her how you feel right now  
Tell her about it  
The girl dont want to wait too long  
You got to tell her about it  
Tell her now and you wont go wrong  
You got to tell her about it  
Before it gets too late  
You got to tell her about it  
You know the girl dont want  
To waityou got to  
Tell her about it
