My jeans cost a thousand  
My whip from the old school  
Nothin but bosses around us  
And you aint got no pool  
So much champagne I drowned in it  
OG rolled a pound of it  
Keep it G you like the sound of it  
Came to spend money whos countin it  
Im the realest in the drop just left the dealer  
In this outfit Im a killer tell the coppers I aint innocent  
If its poppin then Im in it  
Own it all you probably rent it  
When I talk you niggas listen  
Thirty thousand Imma spend it  
  
Hella bottles in my section  
Throwin money on the floor  
No I aint on the guest list  
I walk right in through the door  
Im so turnt up so turnt up Get higher  
Im so turnt up so turnt up Get higher  
Im so turnt up so turnt up Get higher  
Im so turnt up so turnt up Get higher  
  
Mixing gin up with the Tequila  
Smokin reefer  
Got it twisted thinkin I dont get fucked up  
Make you a believer  
Cameras outside there go young Khalifa  
No keys left the 69 inside  
Cuz my license just expired  
Im in my Cadillac I dont drive  
Hit the club and get so high  
And I dont really know about yall  
But all of my niggas got bank  
Im payin for all of these bottles  
Im a boss nigga fuck you think  
Good weed good drink better clothes  
Fast cars club owners let us smoke  
Grind hard you dont work hard youll never know  
How it feel to have a couple niggas thats real  
  
Hella bottles in my section  
Throwin money on the floor  
No I aint on the guest list  
I walk right in through the door  
Im so turnt up so turnt up Get higher  
Im so turnt up so turnt up Get higher  
Im so turnt up so turnt up Get higher  
Im so turnt up so turnt up Get higher  
  
Get higher  
Get higher  
Get higher
