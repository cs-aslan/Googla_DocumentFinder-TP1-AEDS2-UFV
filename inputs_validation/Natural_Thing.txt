Winter and moonlight  
Its an oldfashioned song  
Julies in blue jeans  
Now her love has gone  
  
Shes an oldfashioned feelin  
Shes an oldfashioned song  
Julies in love now but love has gone  
  
Its a natural thing  
Its a natural thing  
  
I never knew her  
I never tried  
Julie would run by  
Cryin tearyeyed  
  
She was oldfashioned feelin  
She was oldfashioned song  
Julies in blue lace  
And love has gone  
Her love has gone  
  
Its a natural thing  
Its a natural thing  
Its a natural thing  
  
Oh she was oldfashioned feelin  
She was oldfashioned song yes Julie  
Now Julies in blue lace  
And love has gone  
Well love has gone  
Well love has gone  
  
Its a natural thing  
  
Julie Julie
