You tell me that its over  
Im just someone you think of now and then  
And you say that you once loved me  
But the love you had for me came to an end  
  
And you tell me that my memory  
Is just a dying ember not a flame  
Well you can call it what you want to  
Its still love by any other name  
  
Call it what you want to  
I still bring out the want to in your eyes  
Every time that Im around you  
The desire that surrounds you just cant be disguised  
  
You can call it anything at all  
But what youre telling me dont change a thing  
You can call it what you want to  
I still bring out the want to in your eyes  
  
Every time that Im around you  
The desire that surrounds you just cant be disguised  
You can call it anything at all  
But what youre telling me dont change a thing  
  
Baby call it what you want to  
Its still love by any other name
