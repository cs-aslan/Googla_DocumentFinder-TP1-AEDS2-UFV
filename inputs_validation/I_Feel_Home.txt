There are few things pure in this world anymore  
And home is one of the few  
Wed have a drink outside  
Maybe run and hide if we saw a couple men in blue  
  
To me its so damn easy to see  
That true people are the people at home  
Well Ive been away but now Im back today  
And there aint a place Id rather go  
  
I feel home  
When I see the faces that remember my own  
I feel home  
When Im chillin outside with the people I know  
  
I feel home  
And thats just what I feel  
Home is reality  
And all I need is something real  
  
Feelin alright headin out tonight  
Maybe out to a dark driveway  
I say now some feel bored  
And some are lookin for more  
  
Well we all just decide to stay  
We got nothin to do  
And I look at you  
I see something that I know and love  
  
And with the crack of a smile we all stay a while  
We know from home there aint nothing above  
Well in the end we can all call a friend  
Well thats something I know as true  
  
And then a thousand years and a thousand tears  
I come to findinginsomethings wrong here my original crew  
Cause to me throughout eternity  
Theres somewhere where youre welcome to go  
  
I said its something free that means a lot to me  
When Im with my friends I feel home  
I feel home  
When I see the faces I remember my own  
  
I feel home  
When Im chillin outside with the people I know  
I feel home  
And thats just what I feel  
  
Home is reality  
And all I need something real  
Home is reality  
And all I need something real  
I feel home
