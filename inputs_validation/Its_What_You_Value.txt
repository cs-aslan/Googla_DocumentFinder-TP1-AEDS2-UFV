Someones driving a 450  
And his friends are so wild  
Theyre still in their stick shifties  
But they feel they have much more style  
But Ive found     
  
Its all up to what you value  
Down to where you are  
It all swings on the pain youve gone through  
Getting where you are  
  
Its all up to what you value  
In your motor car  
It all rests on what its cost you  
Getting where you are  
Its what you value  
  
Someones driving a 6wheeler  
Seems the world is all blurred  
Knows hes in a show stealer  
With a sound thats uncompared  
And Ive found  
  
Its all up to what you value  
Down to where you are  
It all swings on the pain youre gone through  
Getting where you are  
  
Its all up to what you value  
In your motor car  
It all rests on what it costs you  
Getting where you are  
Its what you value
