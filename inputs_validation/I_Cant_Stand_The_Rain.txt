I cant stand the rain  
Against my window  
Bringing back sweet memories  
I cant stand the rain  
Against my window  
Cause he aint here with me  
  
Hey window pain  
Tell me do you remember  
How sweet it used to be  
  
When we were together  
Everything was so grand  
Now that weve parted  
Theres just one sound  
That I just cant stand  
  
I cant stand the rain  
Against my window  
Bringing back sweet memories  
I cant stand the rain  
Against my window  
Cause he aint here with me  
  
Hey hey rain  
Get out of my window  
Cause he aint here with me  
I cant stand the rain  
Against my window  
Bringing back sweet memories
