Where am I going  
Have I gone to far  
Have I lost my mind  
Where are my eyes  
Oh have I seen to much  
Have I lost my touch  
Losing directions from growing infections  
Poisoned desires of reaping life so young  
  
What will I be like  
When my head is bear  
And my legs are weak  
Will I be strong or barely keep alive  
When Im thirtyfive  
Reaching dimentions that shatter conventions  
Leads me to fear that Im growing old too soon  
  
With every step and every breath  
Its farther from youth and closer to death  
And that things Ive realized  
Now beckon me to shut my eyes  
And I will grow to the age of maybe eighty years  
In such little time  
With this venturous mind  
  
What am I saying  
Dont I know myself from experience  
Ill never change  
Nor cease to sail the sky  
Till the day I die  
Ill come to conclusion with fear or illusion  
Ill live how I feel  
Cause no matter how fast or how slow  
Youth will go
