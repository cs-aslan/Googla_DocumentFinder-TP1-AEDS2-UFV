Yeah  
  
Desert sky  
Dream beneath a desert sky  
The rivers run but soon run dry  
We need new dreams tonight  
  
Desert rose  
Dreamed I saw a desert rose  
Dress torn in ribbons and in bows  
Like a siren she calls to me  
  
Sleep comes like a drug  
In Gods country  
Sad eyes crooked crosses  
In Gods country  
  
Set me alight  
Well punch a hole right through the night  
Everyday the dreamers die  
See whats on the other side  
  
She is liberty  
And she comes to rescue me  
Hope faith her vanity  
The greatest gift is gold  
  
Sleep comes like a drug  
In Gods country  
Sad eyes crooked crosses  
In Gods country  
  
Naked flame  
She stands with a naked flame  
I stand with the sons of Cain  
Burned by the fire of love  
Burned by the fire of love
