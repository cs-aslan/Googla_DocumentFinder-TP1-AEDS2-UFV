Youve been teaching me a lesson  
That Ive never learned  
You never make it through a lifetime  
Without being burned  
Everything I ever thought you were  
You turned out to be  
Since you gave your love to me  
  
When I met you on a Monday  
My life just stood still  
I belong in every moment  
That your love can fill  
Let me be the only heart you can mend  
Turn out the light and take it right to the end  
  
Chorus  
Living with you  
In the madness of my mind  
In a world I could not find  
But you knew what to do  
Living with you  
Theres a full moon on the rise  
Theres a fire in your eyes  
And I was born to be  
  
Loving you under my skin  
Youre everything to me  
I could not love you more  
And you know that you are mine  
And thats what Im living for  
  
There will never be a question  
Of somebody new  
I could make it through a lifetime  
With someone like you  
Let me be the only heart
