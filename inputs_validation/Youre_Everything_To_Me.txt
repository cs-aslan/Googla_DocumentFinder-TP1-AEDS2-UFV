I sometimes sit and wonder just why I am able to get the lucky breaks I do  
Im luckier than Roosevelt or Nuffield or Gable theyve never been in love
with you  
They may have lots of money and importance I know Id fail where they
succeed  
But though my worldly wealth are only  fourpence what more do I need  
They can take away the chairs the carpet from the stairs and all that they
can see  
It wont mean anything so long as Ive got you youre everything to me  
  
They can take away the slates the number from the gate and even take the key  
It wont mean anything so long as Ive got you youre everything to me  
I can do without cigars and Rolls Royce motor cars and walk the way Ive done  
And although the weathers damp I can do without my gamp  
When you re everything rolled into one  
  
I can give up all I bought without a single thought its not so hard you
see  
It wont mean anything so long as Ive got you youre everything to me  
I can do without my fags or the bottom to my bags Id even go TT  
I dont need anything so long as Ive got you youre everything to me  
I can get along with nowt  aye and can even de without my Auntie Maggies
Remedy  
I dont need anything so long as Ive got you youre everything to me  
  
Id give up without a shock my stick of Blackpool Rock  
Although it gives me lots of fun  
I can do without my pipe or my weekly plate of tripe  
For youre everything rolled into one  
I can do without my boots or without my swimming suit  
Id undress in the sea brrrrr  
I dont need anything so long as Ive got you youre everything to me  
You see  youre everything to me
