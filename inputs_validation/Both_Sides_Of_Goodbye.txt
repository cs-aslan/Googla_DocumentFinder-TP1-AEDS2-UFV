When you pack your clothes tonight dont pack up all the blame  
Your not the first to walk away and leave someone in pain  
I know how much its hurting you hurting me this way  
Believe me Ive been in your shoes and I know you cant stay  
  
  
Ive been on both sides of goodbye I know there aint no easy side Ive
loved and Ive been loved but not at the same time Ive been on both sides of
goodbye  
  
  
Dont feel so bad for doing what youve got to do  
You cant make your heart love me if it dont want to  
When love just dont work both ways and someones got to go  
So close that door and dont look back believe me girl I know  
  
  
Ive been on both sides of goodbye and I know there aint no easy ride Ive
loved and Ive been loved but not at the same time Ive been on both sides of
goodbye  
Ive loved and Ive been loved but not at the same time Ive been on both
sides of goodbye  
goodbye
