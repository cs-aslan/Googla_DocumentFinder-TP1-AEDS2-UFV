What are you gonna do when they tell you what to do  
Taught at a young age to respect the men in blue  
And due their fucking state control your forced to go into their schools  
Where they teach us twisted history and make us pledge allegiance to their
flag  
Its time that the next generation learned to think for themfuckingselves  
  
What are you gonna do  
When they tell you what to do Repeat x 4  
  
Taught at a young age what was wrong and what was right  
And as they impose their rules of suspension they hope we wont put up a fight  
Well they teach us twisted history and make us pledge allegiance to their flag  
You dont need a paper to say youre smart if you can think for yourself  
  
What are you gonna do  
When they tell you what to do Repeat x 4  
  
Dont let them tell to you what to do  
The teachers in your class or the bullies in your school  
Dont let them tell you how to think  
Your parents or some fucking shrink  
Dont let the tell you how to act  
Wait till they see that youre dropping out of class  
Dont let the school district tell you what to do  
Tell everybody Fuck you
