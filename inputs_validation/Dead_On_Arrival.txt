I hope this is the last time  
Cause Id never say no to you  
This conversations been dead on arrival  
Theres no way to talk to you  
This conversations been dead on  
  
A rivalry goes so deep  
Between me and this loss of sleep over you  
  
This is side one  
Flip me over  
I know Im not your favorite record  
The songs you grow to like  
Never stick at first  
So Im writing you a chorus  
And here is your verse  
  
No its not the last time  
Cause I never say no to you  
This conversations still dead on arrival  
Theres no way to talk to you  
When youre dead on  
  
A rivalry goes so deep  
Between me and this loss of sleep over you  
  
This is side one This is my side one  
Flip me over  
I know Im not your favorite record  
The songs you grow to like songs you grow to like  
Never stick at first  
So Im writing you a chorus  
And here is your  
  
This is side one  
Flip me over  
I know Im not your favorite record  
So  
  
This is side one  
Flip me over  
  
This is side one  
Flip me over  
I know Im not your favorite record  
The songs you grow to like  
Never stick at first  
So Im writing you a chorus  
And here is your verse  
Here is your
