Look at me bitch  
Look at me bitch  
Look at me bitch  
Im an American superstar  
  
Chorus x2  
I got guns for the snitches  
Roses for the bitches  
Hop up off the whip  
Paparazzi taking pictures  
I got guns for the snitches  
And roses for the bitches  
Hop up off the whip  
Paparazzi taking pictures  
  
Heavy metal for them boys  
Slanging pedals for the cash  
Got an appetite for destruction  
You can call me excel  
Ask me bout what a nigga done done  
Ask me bout what a nigga do well  
Ask me were the bricks come from  
Thats what a snitch nigga do they tell  
I dont want nothing to do with that deal  
If its selected Im bringing them shells  
Only position for me is a player  
Thats right player  
Better get it right player  
I have to be in emergency  
Lucky for you if Im blowing my trees  
Come on my nerve  
No regular me  
Its somebody shawty with me on her knees  
Im ready if theres a problem  
She sexy Flo Rida holla  
Dont test me get that bro harda  
Get messy just like a mobster  
My brawls deserve lobsters  
You clowns deserve choppas  
You serve like jimmy hoppa  
American showstoppa  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Look at me bitch  
Look at me bitch  
I got money on money on money on money  
On top of more money on top of my shit like flies  
Open that Ferrari f5 like eyes  
Up and down ocean drive  
Jumping out that Maybach  
With a bitch way back to tease them thighs  
She got a tattoo on her booty and it say 305  
DJ Khaled say its a movie now dont forget your line  
Cause you dont want me to edit before we roll the credits  
Bitch give me my credit  
Im so energetic  
Im fucking like rabbits smoking on lettuce  
But what ever I want I get it  
I meant it if I said it  
And I say I keep pumping I aint talking unleaded  
If you want it come get it  
Cause boy Im ready  
I get it fast fetty  
They should call me Tom Petty  
Got two bitches one peanut butter jelly  
Im an American gangsta already  
And Im an American superstar  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Im an American superstar  
Yeah

Baby Im an American superstar
