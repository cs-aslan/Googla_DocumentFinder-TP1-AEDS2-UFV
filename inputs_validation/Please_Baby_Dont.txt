Please baby dont baby dont  
Dont fall in love with me  
Please baby dont baby dont  
You know my history  
See honey I honey I  
Im just trying to warn you let me warn you  
Please baby dont baby dont  
Dont fall in love with me  
  
Ive been cruisin down this road for a while now  
I should tell the truth  
Girl youve been so good to me but I know  
Im no good for you  
You should run while you can  
Find yourself a better man  
Cause Im known for brief romance  
And breakin hearts across the land  
  
Yes Ive been known to have a few temptations  
Out there on the road  
And lets say hypothetically Ive slipped and  
Took a couple home  
Girl I know thats not fair  
You need someone wholl be there  
So just get away before its too late  
And youre pain is too much to bear  
  
Please baby dont baby dont  
Dont fall in love with me  
Please baby dont baby dont  
You know my history  
See honey I honey Im  
Im just trying to warn you let me warn you  
Please baby dont baby dont  
Dont fall in love with me

Please baby dont baby dont  
Dont fall in love with me  
Please baby dont baby dont  
You know my history  
See honey Im honey Im  
Im just trying to warn you let me warn you  
Please baby dont baby dont  
Dont fall in love with me  
  
Now on second thought maybe well give  
This love another try  
Cause I cant see you with no one else  
Im selfish I cant lie  
So lets go lets go slow  
You know all you need to know  
It could end one day but  
Lets just say well see how far it goes  
  
Please baby dont baby dont  
Dont fall in love with me  
Please baby dont baby dont  
You know my history  
See honey Im honey Im  
Im just trying to warn you let me warn you  
Please baby dont baby dont  
Dont fall in love with me
