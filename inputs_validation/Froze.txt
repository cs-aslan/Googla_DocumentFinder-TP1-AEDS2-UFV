Ive lost my temperature  
Whereve all my sunny days gone  
Is there any place to stay warm  
Its not easy when your gone  
Tell me how Im spose to go on  
Right now I dont be strong  
  
With the rain  
Comes more pain  
You never know damn the weather  
Hard to hide  
When I cry  
This pain inside aint gen better  
Body shakes  
I feel so numb nuuumb  
Im shiverin  
Why did you gochorus  
My body is froze  
Every part of me cold  
My hearts achin  
And I cant breathe  
Souls breakin  
Minus 31 degrees  
Nowhere else to go  
Froze  
  
My heart struggles to beat yeah  
I need a life line  
And I would rather die  
Before I start to freeze yeah  
Live my life in fear no way  
  
With the rain  
Comes more pain  
You never know damn the weather  
Hard to hide  
When I cry  
This pain inside aint gen better  
Body shakes  
I feel so numb nuuumb  
Im shiverin  
Why did you gochorus  
My body is froze  
Every part of me cold  
My hearts achin  
And I cant breathe  
Souls breakin  
Minus 31 degreese  
Nowhere else to go  
Frozebridge  
I am so cold  
My bodys frozen  
I am so cold  
Frozen  
  
Froze my body is froze  
X8Chorus  
My body is froze  
Every part of me cold  
My hearts achin  
And I cant breathe  
Souls breakin  
Minus 31 degreese  
Nowhere else to go  
Froze
