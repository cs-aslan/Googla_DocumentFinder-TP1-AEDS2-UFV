I got troubled thoughts  
And the selfesteem to match  
What a catch what a catch  
Whoa  
  
Youll never catch us  
So just let me be  
Said Ill be fine  
Till the hospital or American Embassy  
Miss Flack said I still want you back  
Yeah Miss Flack said I still want you back  
  
Chorus  
I got troubled thoughts  
And the selfesteem to match  
What a catch what a catch  
And all I can think of  
Is the way Im the one  
Who charmed the one  
Who gave up on you  
Who gave up on you  
  
They say the captain  
Goes down with the ship  
So when the world ends  
Will God go down with it  
Miss Flack said I still want you back  
Yeah Miss Flack said I still want you back  
  
Chorus  
  
What a catch  
What a catch  
What a catch  
What a catch  
  
I will never end up like him  
Behind my back I already am  
Keep a calendar  
This way you will always know  
  
Chorus  
  
Where is your boy tonight  
I hope he is a gentleman  
Maybe he wont find out what I know  
You were the last good thing  
Were going down down in an earlier round  
And sugar were goin down swinging  
Dance dance were falling apart to halftime  
Dance dance and these are the lives youd love to lead  
Dance this is the way theyd love  
If they knew how misery loved me  
This aint a scene its a goddamn arms race  
This aint a scene its a goddamn arms race  
One night and one more time  
Thanks for the memories  
Even though they werent so great  
He tastes like you only sweeter  
Growing up growing up  
  
I got troubled thoughts  
And the selfesteem to match  
What a catch what a catch
