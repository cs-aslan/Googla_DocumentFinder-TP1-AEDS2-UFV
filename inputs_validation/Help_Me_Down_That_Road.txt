I feel so close to you  
Cause you know you always do  
Help me down that road  
  
I go to sleep at night  
Feeling that its alright  
Cause you help me down that road  
  
When I feel Ive been beat  
You get me on my feet  
You help me spread that heavy load  
  
Now that I realize  
Just where our friendship lies  
It will help me down that road  
  
You think youve seen my best  
But you aint seen nothin yet  
Since you help me down that road  
  
When life is a bitter sweet  
You mix it up a treat  
Yeah youre the best pick up I know  
  
If you dont satisfy  
Dont give me the evil eye  
It wont help me down that road  
  
When I aint doin so well  
You never kiss and tell  
You just help me down that road  
  
Just when Im feelin sick  
You give my heart a kick  
Then I dont feel so all alone  
  
When I cant get it right  
Just when the ends in sight  
Yes you help me down that road  
  
I know youll be callin me  
To see you that Im OK  
I know that you will always be  
With me night and day  
  
I could live in poverty I could be in pain  
I know that youd be there with me  
To you its all the same
