A Scotsman clad in kilts left the bar one evening fair  
And one could tell by how he walked hed drunk more than his share  
He staggered on until he could no longer keep his feet  
Then he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street  
Oh Ringding diddle diddle ayedeeoh  
Ring dididdle oh day  
He stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street  
  
Well later on two young and lovely girls just happened by  
And one says to the other with a twinkle in her eye  
Oh see yon sleepy Scotsman so strong and handsome built  
 I wonder if its true what they dont wear beneath the kilt  
Oh Ringding diddle diddle ayedeeoh  
Ring dididdle oh day  
 I wonder if its true what they dont wear beneath the kilt  
  
So they creeped up to the sleeping Scotsman quiet as could be  
And they lifted up his kilt above the waist so they could see  
And there behold for them to view beneath his Scottish skirt  
Twas nothing but what God had blessed him with upon his birth  
Oh Ringding diddle diddle ayedeeoh  
Ring dididdleoh day  
Twas nothing but what God had blessed him with upon his birth  
  
Well they marveled for a moment then one said We best be gone  
But lets leave a present for our friend before we move along  
So as a gift they left a blue silk ribbon tied into a bow  
Around the bonnie star the Scots kilt lifted showed  
Oh Ringding diddle diddle ayedeeoh  
Ring dididdleeoh day  
Around the bonnie star the Scots kilt lifted show  
  
When the Scotsman woke to natures call he stumbled towards the trees  
Behind the bush he lifts his kilt and he gawks at what he sees  
And in a startled voice he says to whats before his eyes  
My friend I dont know where youve been but I see you won first prize  
Oh Ringding diddle diddle ayedeeoh  
Ring dididdleeoh day  
My friend I dont know where youve been but I see you won first prize
