When she said Dont waste your words theyre just lies  
I cried she was deaf  
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes  
Then said What else you got left  
It was then that I got up to leave  
But she said Dont forget  
Everybody must give something back  
For something they get  
  
I stood there and hummed  
I tapped on her drum  
And asked her how come  
And she buttoned her boot  
And straightened her suit  
Then she said Dont get cute  
So I forced my hands in my pockets  
And felt with my thumbs  
And gallantly handed her  
My very last piece of gum  
  
She threw me outside  
I stood in the dirt where evryone walked  
And after finding Id forgotten my shirt  
I went back and knocked  
I waited in the hallway she went to get it  
And I tried to make sense  
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair  
That leaned up against  
  
Her Jamaican rum  
And when she did come I asked her for some  
She said No dear  
I said Your words arent clear  
Youd better spit out your gum  
She screamed till her face got so red  
Then she fell on the floor  
And I covered her up and then  
Thought Id go look through her drawer  
  
And when I was through  
I filled up my shoe and brought it to you  
And you you took me in  
You loved me then you never wasted time  
And I I never took much  
I never asked for your crutch  
And I dont ask for mine
