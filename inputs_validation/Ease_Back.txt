Say what yea now ease back  
To the rear you hear  
Eardrums drown the bass pound  
Really stupid we gonna loop this  
 scoop it is that we rock it  
While ducks jock this  
Biting and writing and fighting for this  
Beats and wax rhymes are facts  
Biting acts  
How we did it for this one that one  
Biters around check out the sound  
In town to the rhythm that we give em  
In fact you lack  
Ultramagnetic skills  
Cause your records no frills  
Heres your bill now ease back  
Ease back  
  
Kool Keith  
  
Im back  
Back to smack attack  
Those who wack and lack my experience  
On the microphone holding my own ground  
Dominating forces  
Change the sources punks takes losses  
Enough cause its me on the mic  
Feeding on words small like a nerd  
Havent you heard this change of rhyme  
Continuing the land of time  
For my incredible highly elevated  
Smooth in the mind more sophisicated  
Motivated as I relate it verbal  
Dissing a mouse and smacking any gerbel  
I bought a Saab a 1990 Turbo  
Shining fog lights in the front  
Im by myself no seats for a stunt  
Cause I want it like that I got it like that  
I have it like I need it like that  
Its better like that I made it like that  
I bought it like that Im living like that  
For you wack MCs  
Who go on the mic and blow on the mic  
And perpetrate frauds and making mistakes  
Like an amateur but Im a 20 year veteran  
And better than including the rest of them  
I chew em all and spit out the best of them  
One by one Im teaching my son  
To ease back  
Ease back  
  
Seth G  
  
Whats up its me again  
Im Seth G wit a funky blend  
Of beats and rhymes on time wit my DJ  
Hes not weak wit anything he plays  
Rocking slicing rep is treacherous  
Like a professor he had perfected this  
Simple potion through devotion  
Wit his blends his motions and fastly approaching  
Coasting reaching higher levels  
So when you see em you best say hello  
Im a take out a knifepen and paper and write  
A rhyme so dope you cant think cant cope  
Ducks who are you really kidding  
You say youre dope well youre admitting  
That you cant compete because youre rhymes are weak  
Full of more nonsense past tense incomplete  
Weap and learn a new rap style  
From Seth G the wizard of know how  
An innovation elevation psyching the nation  
When I ease back  
Ease back
