She was beautiful as southern skies the night he met her  
She was married to someone  
He was doggedly determined that he would get her  
He was old she was young  
  
From time to time  
Hed tip his heart  
But each time she withdrew  
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance  
Everybody thinks its true  
  
Well eventually the boy and the girl get married  
Sure enough they have a son  
And though they were both occupied with the child she carried  
Disagreements had begun  
  
And in a while  
They fell apart  
It wasnt hard to do  
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance  
Everybody thinks its true  
  
Two disappointed believers  
Two people playing the game  
Negotiations and love songs  
Are often mistaken for one and the same  
  
Now the man and the woman they remain in contact  
Let us say its for the child  
With disagreements about the meaning of a marriage contract  
Conversations hard and wild  
  
But from time to time he makes her laugh  
She cooks a meal of two  
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance  
Everybody thinks its true  
  
What is the point of this story  
What information pertains  
The thought that life could be better  
Is woven indelibly  
Into our hearts and our brains
