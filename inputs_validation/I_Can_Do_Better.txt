Uh yeah you can do it  
  
I couldnt give a damn what you say to me  
I dont really care what you think of me  
Cause either way youre gonna think what you believe  
Theres nothing you could say that would hurt me  
Im better off without you anyway  
I thought it would be hard but Im okay  
I dont need you if youre gonna be that way  
Cause with me its all or nothing  
  
Im sick of this shit  
Dont deny  
Youre a waste of time  
Im sick of this shit  
Dont ask why  
  
Chorus  
I hate you now  
So go away from me  
Youre gone  
So long  
I can do better  
I can do better  
Hey hey you  
I found myself again  
Thats why  
Youre gone  
I can do better  
I can do better  
  
Youre so full of shit  
I cant stand the way you act  
You just cant comprehend  
I dont think that you can handle it  
Im way over over it  
I will drink as much Limoncello as I can  
And Ill do it again and again  
I dont really care what you have to say  
Cause you know you know youre nothing  
  
Im so sick  
Im sick of your shit  
Dont deny  
Youre a waste of time  
Im sick of your shit  
Dont ask why  
  
Chorus  
  
Whatd you say  
I told you so  
You know that cause I always know  
Get outta my face  
Hey hey  
Youre not my taste  
Hey hey  
I am so sick of you  
Youre on my nerves  
I want to puke  
Get outta my face  
Hey hey  
Youre not my taste  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey  
  
Chorus x 2
