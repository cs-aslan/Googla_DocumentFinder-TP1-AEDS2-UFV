Well youve started again  
With the wife of a friend  
On another night you hope you wont recall  
And the wine that youre drinkin  
Doesnt keep you from thinkin  
Of the bitter taste that lingers in your soul  
As you listen to your lies  
Once again you realize  
That she doesnt mean a thing to you at all  
And I watch you climb that stairway  
To the bottom  
Every evening in that mirror on the wall  
  
You take pride in deceiving  
One who tried hard believin in you  
Even after all the lies you told  
But each lie that youve spoken  
And each vow that youve broken  
Was a new nail in the coffin of your soul  
If you think someones cryin  
For the love that is dyin  
With the trust that you betray each time you fall  
Look around you on that stairway to the bottom  
No ones watchin but that mirror on the wall  
  
Look around you on that stairway to the bottom  
No ones watchin but that mirror on the wall
