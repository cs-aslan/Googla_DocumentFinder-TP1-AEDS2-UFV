Just when the sun shines the brightest and the world looks all right again  
The clouds fill the skies you cant believe your eyes sometimes you just cant
win  
My love never meant much to you dear and to you I was always a friend  
Oh why did I fall youd have no heart at all sometimes you just cant win  
 acguitar   
I cant live like this any longer not knowing just where I stand  
I know I shouldnt care but sweetheart it dont seem fair  
Sometimes you just cant win  
And then when the sun shines the brightest  
Yeah sometimes you just cant win
