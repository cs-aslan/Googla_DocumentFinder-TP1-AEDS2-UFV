Green shadow water weight all overall over me  
The end will shelter me away  
Can we meet again meet and meet and meet again  
Can ya fill the can if ya cant fill me  
  
Who ya following  
Who ya starting to move like  
Who ya falling for who ya falling for  
Whose lies  
Who ya following who ya falling for  
This sounds on your side  
  
Secret blue purple pink and green right over it  
Hold on cuz the coldest hasnt fought yet  
Well if we meet again meet and meet and meet again  
Can ya catch the can if you cant will it  
  
How will you want something to hit with  
Spinning again and again and again and again  
Whats your crime

Well how will you want

How will she spin  
Shes spinning again and again and again and again  
Whats your crime  
Whats your whats your whats your whats your  
Whats your crime crime crime  
Whats your whats your whats your whats your
