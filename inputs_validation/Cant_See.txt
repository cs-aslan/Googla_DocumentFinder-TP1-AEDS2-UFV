We were both cast forth from the same pale hand  
And we both moved freely in the shadowlands  
And we both were sculpted by the same cold wind  
And we both had armor that was made of tin  
And i tried to find you but its useless  
And i tried to speak but it was useless  
And i felt so bad and i didnt know why  
And it didnt get better as time went by  
I was there for you but you turned away  
And i tried to find you but you turned away  
And i tried to find you but its useless  
And i tried to speak but was useless  
And i tried to find you but its useless  
And youre so close but i cant see you  
And youre right there but i cant see you  
And i feel so dumb and i didnt know what to do  
You were right there but i cant see you  
And i realize that its useless  
And i want to fight but its useless  
And i know youre there but its useless  
And youre everywhere but its useless  
And i tried to say it but my tongue got tied  
And i tried to say it but i was numb inside  
And i cant see you anymore  
And my peace of mind has gone through the door  
And i realize that its useless  
And i thought i was right but it was useless  
And i know youre there but its useless  
And youre everywhere but its useless  
And i cant see now in front of my nose  
And i know youre there and i know youre close  
And youre fading away  now you disappear  
And i try to focus but i cant see clear  
And i dont know why i feel this way  
And i cant control myself anyway  
And i dont know why i feel this way  
And i cant control myself anyway  
And i feel so bad but its useless  
And i feel so bad but its useless  
And i feel so bad but its useless  
And i cant see now in front of my face
