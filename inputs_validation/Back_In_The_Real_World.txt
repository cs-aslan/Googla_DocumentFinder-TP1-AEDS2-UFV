You tell us how youll make it to the top  
But you dont try  
Your bullshit makes us sick  
We just laugh until we cry  
Weve heard it all before  
And we dont care  
Dont talk to me no more  
Life just aint fair  
Now that youve patronised us humiliated us  
Please go away  
I hope youre satisfied come back  
Say I told you so one day  
Weve heard  
Look before you leap  
Think before you speak  
Wait before you move  
How many times must you tell us of your  
Stupid pointless dreams  
Wake up and realise that life  
Is not as easy as it seems  
Weve heard  
Look before
