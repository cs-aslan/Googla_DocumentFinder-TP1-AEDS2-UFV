Lady luck never smiles  
So lend your love to me awhile  
Do with me what you will  
Break the spell take your fill  
On and on we rode the storm  
The flame has died and the fire has gone  
Oh this empty bed is a night alone  
I realized that long ago  
  
Is anybody out there anybody there  
Does anybody wonder anybody care  
  
Oh I just gotta know  
If youre really there and you really care  
Cause baby Im not  
  
Ffffoolin ah fffoolin  
Ffffoolin ah fffoolin  
Wont you stay with me awhile  
  
Close your eyes dont run and hide  
Easy love is no easy ride  
Just wakin up from what we had  
Could stop good love from going bad  
  
Is anybody out there anybody there  
Does anybody wonder anybody care  
  
Oh I just gotta know  
If youre really there and you really care  
Cause baby Im not  
  
Ffffoolin ah fffoolin  
Ffffoolin ah fffoolin  
  
Oh I just gotta know  
If youre really there and you really care  
Cause baby Im not  
  
Ffffoolin ah fffoolin  
Not ffffoolin ah fffoolin  
  
Im not foolin myself  
Im not foolin myself  
Im not foolin myself  
Im not foolin myself
