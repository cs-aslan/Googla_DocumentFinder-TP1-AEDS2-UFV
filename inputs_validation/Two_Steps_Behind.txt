Walk away if you want to  
Its OK if you need to  
You can run but you can never hide  
From the shadow thats creeping up beside you  
Theres a magic running through your soul  
But you cant have it all  
  
Chorus  
Whatever you do  
Ill be two steps behind you  
Wherever you go  
And Ill be there to remind you  
That it only takes a minute of your precious time  
To turn around and Ill be two steps behind  
  
Take the time  
To think about it  
Walk the line you know you just cant fight it  
Take a look around and see what you can find  
Like the fire thats burning up inside me  
Theres a magic running through your soul  
But you cant have it all  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a magic running through your soul  
But you you cant have it all  
  
Chorus  
  
Two steps behind  
Yeah baby  
Two steps behind  
Ohh sugar  
Two steps behind
