You say I get around but  
Im gonna hit the ground  
I dont hear a word youre sayin  
Going out of my head and  
The worlds turnin red  
Dont think Ill be stayin  
You got your fancy pants now  
Wear em to the dance  
All I got is what Im playin  
But the trouble with you is there aint just a few  
Dont take the ride unless youre payin  
  
Like a hot burnin fire  
Blazin out of control  
I couldnt get much higher Im  
  
Freewheelin  
Nothin gets in my way  
When Im freewheelin  
Im free yea  
  
Take a look around cause its all fallin down  
Fallin from the dream that we created  
Im lookin up at the sky and Im wondering why  
Why its all deflated  
You got a million and one ways to have fun  
Everything Ive done is overrated  
So take a step back cause I dont need the flack  
I can see your promises a fadin  
  
Like a hot burnin fire  
Blazin out of control  
I couldnt get much higher Im  
  
Freewheelin  
Nothin gets in my way  
When Im freewheelin  
Im free yea  
  
Like a hot burnin fire  
Blazin out of control  
I couldnt get much higher Im  
  
Freewheelin  
Nothin gets in my way  
When Im freewheelin  
Im free yea  
  
Freewheelin  
Nothing get in my way  
When Im freewheelin  
Im free yea  
  
Freewheelin  
When Im freewheelin  
Im free yea
