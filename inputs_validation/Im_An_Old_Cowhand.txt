Oh step aside yall ornery tenderfeet  
Cause Im about to sing my song  
Im an old cowhand from the rio grande  
But my legs aint bowed and my cheeks aint tan  
Well Im a cowboy who never saw a cow  
Never roped a steer cause I dont know how  
And I sure aint fixin to startin now  
Oh yippeeiokiay yippeeiokiay  
  
Im an old cowhand from the rio grande  
And I learned to ride before I learned to stand  
Well Im a ridin fool who is up to date  
I know every trail in the lone star state  
cause I ride the range in a ford v8  
Oh yippeeiokiay yippeeiokiay  
  
Look out Im gonna show yall how to ride now  
Here we go  
  
Im an old cowhand from the rio grande  
And I come to town just to hear the band  
I know all the songs that the cowboys know  
bout the big corral where the dogies go  
cause I learned them all on the radio  
Oh yippeeiokiay yippeeiokiay  
  
Now my storys almost done so listen up  
You aint got much longer now  
  
Im an old cowhand from the rio grande  
Where the west is wild round the borderland  
Where the buffalo roam around the zoo  
And the indian make you a rug or two  
And the old barx is the barbecue  
Oh yippeeiokiay yippeeiokiay  
  
Im just an old cowhand
