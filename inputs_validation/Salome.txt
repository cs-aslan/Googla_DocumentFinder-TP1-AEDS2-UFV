Baby please  
Baby please dont go  
I got lies to feed  
They want skin and seed  
And dont make me crawl  
  
Please  
Baby dont bite your lip  
Give you half what I got  
If you untie the knot  
Its a promise  
  
Salomesalome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Salomeshake it shake it shake it salome  
  
Baby please  
Baby whats that tune  
Well I heard it before  
When I crawled from your door  
And my blood turned blue  
  
Please  
Baby please slow down  
Baby I feel sick  
Dont make me stick to my promise  
  
Salomesalome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Salomeshake it shake it shake it salome  
Salomeshake it shake it shake it salome  
  
Baby please  
Baby dont say no  
Wont you dance for me  
Under the cherry tree  
Wont you swing down low  
  
Please  
Baby please say yes  
Baby dont go away  
Youre spilling me  
And your precious love  
  
Salomesalome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Salomeshake it shake it shake it salome  
Salomeshake it shake it shake it salome  
Salomeshake it shake it shake it salome
