You say youre so tired youre never satisfied  
But I cant seem to make you understand  
I see your point of view but lifes been to good to you  
Just stand up and face things like a man  
  
You better get your act together  
If you ever want to take it on the road  
You cant sit around  
Or the bad times are gonna get to you  
And youre never gonna see it through  
  
I know that things dont seem so good right now  
But you gotta move along some how  
Try to do the best you can  
Sure nuff thins will slowly turnaround  
You wont always be so down  
I know that its true  
  
It wont always be such stormy weather  
It may be a cliche but the sun is gonna shine  
So you cant sit around  
Or the bad times are gonna get to you  
And youre never gonna see it through  
  
It dont matter where youve been  
Its where youre going to  
Yeah and it wont do you no good  
Just livin in the past  
You know you cant sit around  
Cause the bad times are gonna get to you  
And youre never gonna see it through  
  
And theyre never ever gonna go  
Yeah theyll be here to stay  
Yeah its always gonna be that way
