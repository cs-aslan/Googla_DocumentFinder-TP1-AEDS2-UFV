Ladies and gentlemen  
The moment youve all been waiting for  
In this corner weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds  
With a record of seventeen rapes four hundred assaults and four murders  
The undisputed most diabolic villain in the world  
Slim Shady  
  
Chorus  
So crack a bottle let your body waddle  
Dont act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto  
Ooh ooh bitches hopping in my Tahoe  
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes  
Now wheres the rubbers Whos got the rubbers  
I noticed theres so many of them  
And theres really not that many of us  
Ladies love us my posses kicking up dust  
Its on till the break of dawn  
And were starting this party from dusk  
  
OK lets go  
  
Back with Andre the giant mister elephant tusk  
Picture us youll just be another one bit the dust  
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus  
Kiss my butt Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts  
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks  
Its a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed  
Bitches lust Man they love me when I lay in the cut  
Fist the cup The lady gave her eighty some paper cut  
Now picture us Its ridiculous you curse at the thought  
Cause when I spit the verse the shit  
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce  
If I could fit the words as picture perfect works every time  
Every verse every line as simple as nursery rhymes  
Its elementary The elephants have entered the room  
I venture to say were the center of attention its true  
Not to mention back with a vengeance so heres the signal  
Of the bat symbol The platinum trios back on you hoes  
  
Chorus  
  
Ladies and gentlemen Dr Dre  
  
Dr Dre  
They see that low rider go by theyre like Oh my  
You aint got to tell me why youre sick cuz I know why  
I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre  
Im an itch that they cant scratch they sick of me  
But hey what else can I say I love LA  
Cause over and above all its just another day  
And this one begins where the last one ends  
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again  
Ill be dammed just fucked around and crashed my Benz  
Driving around with a smashed front end  
Lets cash that one in  
Grab another one from out the stable  
The Monte Carlo El Camino or the El Dorado  
The hell if I know  
Do I want leather seats or vinyl  
Decisions decisions  
Garage looks like Precision Collision  
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco  
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though  
  
Chorus  
  
And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent  
  
Its bottle after bottle  
The money aint a thing when you party with me  
Its what we into its simple  
We ball out of control like you wouldnt believe  
Im the napalm the bomb the don Im King Kong  
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on  
Im so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm  
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want  
Nigga on and on till the break of what  
Get the paper man Im caking you know I dont give a fuck  
I spend it like it dont mean nothing  
Blow it like its supposed to be blown  
Motherfucker Im grown  
I stunt I style I flash the shit  
I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick  
Fat ass burgundy bags classy shit Jimmy Choo shoes  
I say move a bitch move  
  
Chorus
