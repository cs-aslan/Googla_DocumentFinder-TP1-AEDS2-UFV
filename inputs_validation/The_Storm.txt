She sits among the pieces of broken glass and photographs  
Reluctantly releases the last of what was her past  
It struck without a warning or did she just ignore the signs  
In those dark clouds forming behind her silver lines  
  
Then the door it slammed like thunder and the tears they fell like rain  
And the warnings from her family whirl like a hurricane  
Oh shes drowning in emotions and she cannot reach the shore  
Shes alive but can she survive the storm  
  
A broken jewel box dancer lies in pieces down the hall  
Shes finding out the answers dont change nothing at all  
Its time that she stopped searching for whos to blame or what went wrong  
The only thing for certain is hes gone  
shes got to move on  
  
Then the door it slammed like thunder and the tears they fell like rain  
And the warnings from her family whirl like a hurricane  
Shes drowning in emotions and she cannot reach the shore  
Shes alive but can she survive the storm  
  
Someday days just roll on by without a gray cloud in the sky  
She keeps telling herself I will make it on my own  
And her friends theyve all gone back to their lives  
Thinking she will be alright  
As she races through the night to make it home  
  
The door it slams like thunder and the tears they fall like rain  
And the warnings from her family whirl like a hurricane  
Oh shes drowning in emotions and she cannot reach the shore  
Shes alive but can she survive the storm
