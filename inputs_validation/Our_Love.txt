Chorus  
Our love I could never live without it  
Our love call my name and Ill be there  
Our love no one here could ever doubt it  
Our love your heart our love  
  
Time has said that when were together  
There wont be a never to keep us apart  
I believe this love will grow stronger  
Our days will grow longer  
Your loves in my heart  
There were times when I thought that we would never be  
Two hearts that beat as one  
Now I know that its real  
The way that I feel  
And baby I want to say that you make my life a joy  
  
Chorus  
  
Now I know that well be together  
Forever and ever till the end of time  
Heres a love that burns like a fire  
Yet filled with desire  
And sweeter than wine  
Could it be that we are living in a fantasy  
Some say it cant be true  
Now I just cant conceal  
All this passion the thrill  
Come let me show me that I love you  
Its true I do  
  
Chorus  
  
My love and your love  
I said together not without it  
Not anyone could ever doubt it  
Said our love together forever and ever  
In love the sky I fly above  
And I cant fly without our love
