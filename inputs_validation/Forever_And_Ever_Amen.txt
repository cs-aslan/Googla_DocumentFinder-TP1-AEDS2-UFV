You may think that Im talking foolish  
Youve heard that Im wild and Im free  
You may wonder how I can promise you now  
This love that I feel for you always will be  
But youre not just time that Im killin  
Im no longer one of those guys  
As sure as I live this love that I give  
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die  
  
Oh baby Im gonna love you forever  
Forever and ever amen  
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather  
As long as old women sit and talk about old men  
If you wonder how long Ill be faithful  
Ill be happy to tell you again  
Im gonna love you forever and ever  
Forever and ever amen  
  
They say time take its toll on a body  
Makes a young girls brown hair turn gray  
Well honey I dont care I aint in love with your hair  
And if it all fell out well Id love you anyway  
They say time can play tricks on a memry  
Make people forget things they knew  
Well its easy to see its happenin to me  
Ive already forgotten evry woman but you  
Oh darlin Im gonna love you forever  
Forever and ever amen  
  
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather  
As long as old women sit and talk about old men  
If you wonder how long Ill be faithful  
Well just listen to how this song ends  
Im gonna love you forever and ever  
Forever and ever amen  
Im gonna love you forever and ever  
Forever and ever forever and ever  
Forever and ever amen
