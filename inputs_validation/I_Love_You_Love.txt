Hush my baby Dont you cry  
Ill dry your eyes Fulfill your hearts desire  
Lets go in Try again  
Careful this time Broken promises linger in our mind  
  
Ill give in completely Hearts break so easy  
I know Believe me Oh Ive tried  
But my arms can hold you My kiss console you  
Ill come and love you tonight  
  
Chorus  
And I  
I love I love I love  
Love hurts sometimes  
But this feels right  
You  
You love you love you love  
Though youve been burned  
You still return  
  
Come and share my house my home and all I own  
Id love to give to you  
Arent you tired of going along this lonely road  
It takes its toll on you  
  
Give me your emotion your hearts devotion  
Give anything you like  
And Ill give understanding Lifes so demanding  
Im all you need to get by  
  
Chorus  
  
I love I love I love  
  
Love hurts sometimes  
But this feels right  
  
And You  
You love you love you love  
Though youve been burned  
You still return  
  
Still return  
Still return to love Oh  
Keep coming back to love Ah oh
