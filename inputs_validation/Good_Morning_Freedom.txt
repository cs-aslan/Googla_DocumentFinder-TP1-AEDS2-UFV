Well good morning freedom  
Ive been woken to a brand new day  
Good morning freedom  
Now it seems that you have a different way  
Starts today  
  
So now Im free  
And now youre ready to take my chance again  
So come with me  
And Ill take you to the rainbows end  
  
Oh good morning freedom  
Id like to take you by the hand  
And if you doubt me  
Just listen to the fan  
And youll understand  
  
So now Im free  
And now youre ready to take my chance again  
So come with me  
And Ill take you to the rainbows end  
  
So now Im free  
And now youre ready to take my chance again  
So come with me
