Ive been told a rumour thats been going round  
You got a reputation and it wont lay down  
But while youre feelin the way you do  
You can keep me guessing like I keep on guessing bout you  
I keep on hearing you done me wrong  
Dont make no difference it wont be long  
Ill play your games Youre soon gonna see  
You can fool yourself you can fool yourself  
You can fool yourself oh no no you cant fool me  
Oh oh I know what you want  
I know what you want and thats all right baby  
Oh oh I know what you want  
I know what you want you give it all right  
Oh oh I know what you want  
I know what you want and thats all right baby  
Oh oh I know what you want  
I know what you want you give it all right  
Your mama gave you some good advice  
If you love this man then you wont look twice  
Baby and if youre feeling the way you do  
Gonna keep me guessing gonna keep me guessing  
Gonna keep me guessing like I keep on guessing bout you  
Gonna keep me guessing  
Gonna keep me guessing
