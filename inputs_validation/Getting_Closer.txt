I went searching for the truth  
But in my innocence I found  
All the con men and their acrobats  
Who stomped me in the ground  
If I count up their percentages  
I know theyre getting rich  
But they havent taken everything  
Those paybacks are a bitch  
Though Ive lost quite a lot  
I am still in control  
They can keep what theyve got  
But they cant have my soul  
And if I dont have this all worked out  
Still Im getting closer getting closer  
I still have far to go no doubt  
But Im getting closer getting closer  
What was ripped off by professionals  
Is not all that it seems  
While I must live up to contracts  
I did not give up my dreams  
If I see it as experience  
It hasnt gone to waste  
Lately all the missing pieces  
Have been falling into place  
And if I could go back and start over somehow  
I would not change that much  
Knowing what I know now  
Thought there have been sins  
I will regret  
Still Im getting close getting closer  
I dont have all the answers yet  
But Im getting closer getting closer  
Im a mark for every shyster  
From Topanga to Berlin  
And I should have learned to kick them out  
As soon as they crawled in  
So to every bank in Switzerland  
That stores my stolen youth  
Im alright because despite the laws  
You cannot hide the truth  
And although you will say  
I am still too naive  
But I have not lost faith  
In the things I believe  
And if I dont have this all worked out  
Still Im getting closer getting closer  
I still have far to go no doubt  
But Im still getting closer getting closer
