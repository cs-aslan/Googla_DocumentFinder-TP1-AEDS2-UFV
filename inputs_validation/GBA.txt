I know I see I feel and yes I fear it everyday  
These egos there minds and games  
With all their power could end our days  
Still the sun it shinesand the moon it sinks with grace  
Its such a shame that all this shit exists  
Here on this earth this magical place  
Im doing fine  
Yes you have the funds and size and power to make some change  
What you have will break their smiles  
So many people so many ways  
Each Child who walks their line  
Should be free to run their race  
Its such a shame that all this shit exists here on this earth this magical
place  
Im doing fine
