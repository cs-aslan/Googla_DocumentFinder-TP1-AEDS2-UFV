Standing like a sore thumb out  
Notice your image is different  
Traits that change its just too quick  
Follow on clues and guess what  
  
Thats what its like  
Follow your ups and downs  
Its safe to say that I cant tell  
All sense aside  
  
Left out in the cold  
Sight of your routine getting old  
Blame some indifference inside  
Taken on shapes not to selective  
  
Just what you find  
Looking for seconds of peace of mind  
Pieces of something to hold on to  
A job that you just cant hold down  
  
Distracted for seconds youre gone  
Follow your ups and downs  
Its safe to say that I cant tell  
All sense aside  
  
Left out in the cold  
Sight of your routine getting old  
Blame some indifference inside  
Taken on shapes not to selective  
  
Just what you find  
Where you find it  
Needing to find something  
Is everything ok  
  
I hope you find your niche someday soon  
Easy to change your phase  
To move from where you stand  
But you got to keep that face  
  
Each change you plan  
Wonder is everything ok  
The problem is hesitation
