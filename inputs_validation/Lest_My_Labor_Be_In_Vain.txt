Verse 1  
Justice beckons for those who glory in their shame  
Hell enlarges for sinners to quickly claim  
And while this happens e pray to be blessed  
With eyes ignoring the ripe harvest  
  
Chorus  
Lord give me a piece of your desire  
And let it become all mine  
Take the eyes off me so I can see souls dying  
Let me labor for this gospel  
Without a pause or refrain  
Give me love for the harvest  
Lest my labor be in vain  
Lest my labor be in vain  
  
Verse 2  
And its almost time for Gabriels trumpet to resound  
Heralding the time when the saints of God receive a crown  
And as I step forward to receive my lifes reward  
I must have a soul with me to present to the Lord  
  
Bridge  
Its harvest time Harvest time  
The grain is falling the Saviors calling  
Oh do not wait its growing late  
Behold the fields are white  
Its harvest time  
  
Chorus 2  
Lord give me a piece of your desire  
And let it become all mine  
Take the eyes off me so I can see souls dying  
Open my eyes Lord  
Let me labor for this gospel  
Without a pause or refrain  
  
Vamp  
Give me a love for the harvest 2x  
We need a love for the harvest 4x  
He is the Lord of the harvest 2x  
Give me a love for the harvest  
  
Ending  
Lest my labor be in vain  
Lest my labor be in vain
