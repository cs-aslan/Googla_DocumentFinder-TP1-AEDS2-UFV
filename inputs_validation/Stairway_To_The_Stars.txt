Intro  
Theres a silver trail of moonlight leading upward to the sky  
And the night is like a velvet lullaby  
Theres a heaven of blue  
And well go there just you and I  
  
Lets build a stairway to the stars  
And climb that stairway to the stars  
With love beside us to fill the night with a song  
  
Well hear the sound of violins  
Out yonder where the blue begins  
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along  
  
Chorus  
Cant we sail away on a lazy daisy petal  
Over the rim of the hill  
Cant we sail away on a little dream  
And settle high on the crest of a thrill  
  
Lets build a stairway to the stars  
A lovely stairway to the stars  
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you  
  
Lets build a stairway to the stars  
A lovely stairway to the stars  
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you
