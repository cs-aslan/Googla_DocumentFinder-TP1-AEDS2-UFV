Why cant it stay like this forever  
Why does it always have to change  
  
Everytime you think youve paid the price  
Seems youve always got to pay it twice  
Everytime you think youre near the end  
You turn around and find another ticket  
  
Oh my love time is running out  
Oh my love time is running out  
  
Why must we wait until tomorrow  
When we already know the score  
  
Everytime you think youve paid the price  
Seems youve always got to pay it twice  
Everytime you think youve got it made  
Seems youre only lying in the shade  
  
Everytime you think youve run the course  
Seems youve got to ride another horse  
Everytime you think youre near the end  
You turn around and find another ticket  
  
Why must we wait until tomorrow  
When we already know the score
