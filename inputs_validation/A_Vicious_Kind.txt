Let me say this first  
I was on your side  
Before the war began  
My gloves came off when the ring went  
On and on and on  
  
You can tune me out  
You can turn me down  
And try to cut me off  
But you will not stop me singing  
On and on and on  
  
For a while you danced with us and  
We were all alone  
But the beat kept getting faster  
And you lost control  
  
I want you to know Im  
Not sorry at all  
You cant buy forgiveness  
Or blame me for the fall  
All I ever wanted was  
For us to beat the odds  
I thought we were lucky ones  
But all your luck is gone  
  
Youre a vicious kind  
Cause youve lived this life  
Where youre allowed to win  
Even when youre long you still keep  
On and on and on  
  
So I think its time  
That we said goodbye  
Cause all your talent lies in the way  
Youre always moving  
On and on and on  
  
Oh the beat kept getting faster  
And you lost control  
  
I want you to know Im  
Not sorry at all  
You cant buy forgiveness  
Or blame me for the fall  
All I ever wanted was  
For us to beat the odds  
I thought we were lucky ones  
But all your luck is gone  
  
Oh the beat kept getting faster  
And you lost control  
  
I want you to know Im  
Not sorry at all  
You cant buy forgiveness  
Or blame me for the fall  
  
I want you to know Im  
Not sorry at all  
You cant buy forgiveness  
Or blame me for the fall  
All I ever wanted was  
For us to beat the odds  
I thought we were lucky ones  
But all your luck is gone
