Living  
Running  
Out on the streets at night  
Searching  
Hoping  
For the right connection coz  
Need it want it  
You know Ive got to have it  
Takes me higher than anything I know  
  
Angel dust  
Need a shot to see me through the day  
Angel dust  
Want a lot Ive got to get away  
  
I live my life  
Like theres no tomorrow  
Take no chances  
Im drowning all my sorrows coz I  
Need it want it  
You know Ive got to have it  
Takes me higher than anything I know  
  
Laughing  
Crying  
Every night and day  
I know  
You know  
That Im a different man because I  
Need it want it  
You know Ive got to have it  
Takes me higher than anything I know
