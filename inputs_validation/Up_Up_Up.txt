My grandpa died from asbestos  
My daddys name was Estes  
And I dont know if that messed us up  
Or what it did  
  
My brother wasa workin as an boiler  
He was glad he wasnt workin as an oiler  
One day my sister went and lit up a match  
And up is where they went  
  
They went up Up Up  
Like a guy on a rocket  
Up Up Up  
Keep your luck dont hock it  
Up Up Up  
Put your finger in a socket  
Dont you know thats up Jack  
  
Aaah now that leaves me with my cousins  
You know I got em by the dozens  
Well they brought home a bomb and they didnt act calm  
cause up is where they went  
  
Ah but now everything is satisfactory  
Im on the swing shift at the big factory  
Oooh I keep cuttin I just keep struttin  
cause up is where Im goin  
  
Im goin up Up Up  
Push the elevator button  
Up Up Up  
Like supermans cousin  
Up Up Up  
Ooh fella now Im buzzin  
Dont you know thats up Chuck  
All right Chuck  
  
While gossiping over the back fence  
My aunt was talking in her accents  
The fickle finger of fate paced a well placed goose  
And up is where she went  
  
While visiting a funeral parlor  
Uncle Louie he let out a holler  
A stiff went and winked at him  
And guess where he went  
  
He went up Up  
Make the north pole my landin  
Up Up  
Talk frivolous abandon  
Up Up  
Boom From sitting to standing  
Dont you know thats up  
  
Goin up and up and up  
And up and up and up and up  
Doodliedoda do
