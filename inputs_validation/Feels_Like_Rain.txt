Here I go again  
Hanging on to the bitter end  
All alone  
Nothing left to lose  
Dont want to face tomorrow  
I cant sleep tonight  
Blame it on the weather  
Till I get over you  
Chorus  
Feels like rain  
Feels like Ill never fall in love again  
Theres a cold wind blowing every cloud my way  
And it feels like rain today  
Taking down every picture  
Hanging on every wall  
Broken dreams painfull memories  
Like the times I never listened  
And the times I didnt try  
Its gotta be the weather  
Cause youre not here with me  
Chorus  
Feels like rain  
Feels like Ill never fall in love again  
Theres a cold wind blowing every cloud my way  
And it feels like rain today  
Regretting every minute  
Since I watched you walk away  
Cause its not the same without you  
And now the clouds are hiding  
Every sunny day  
I guess Ill stay inside again  
Cause it feels like rain today  
Feels like rain  
Feels like well never fall in love again  
Theres a cold wind blowing every cloud my way  
And the clouds are hiding every sunny day  
And the storm is coming so Im here to stay  
Cause it feels like rain today  
Yes it feels like rain today
