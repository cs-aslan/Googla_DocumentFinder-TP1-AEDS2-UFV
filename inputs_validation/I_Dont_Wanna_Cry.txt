Once again we sit in silence  
After all is said and done  
Only emptiness inside us  
Baby look what weve become  
We can make a million promises  
But we still wont change  
It isnt right to stay together  
When we only bring each other pain  
  
Chorus  
I dont want to cry  
Dont want to cry  
Nothing in the world  
Could take us back  
To where we used to be  
Though Ive given you my heart and soul  
I must find a way of letting go  
Cause baby I dont want to cry  
  
Too far apart to bridge the distance  
But something keeps us hanging on and on  
Pretending not to know the difference  
Denying what we had is gone  
Every moment were together  
Is just breaking me down  
I know we swore it was forever  
But it hurts too much to stay around  
  
Chorus  
  
All the magics gone  
Theres just a shadow of a memory  
Something just went wrong  
We cant go on makebelieving  
  
Chorus
