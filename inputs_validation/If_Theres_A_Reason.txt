If you should need me deep in the night  
My arms around you in shades of twilight  
If theres a reason for livin without me  
Just let me know and Ill move on  
  
Down to the station with the big wheels burnin  
Gonna get my ticket to play out that role which Ive been given  
  
Home is where the heart is  
But at times a good home must be broken  
The wine has grown bitter  
From the harsh words we have spoken  
  
If theres a chance for someone else  
To make you feel life is worth livin  
Give it a try oh lady  
Just let me know and Ill move on  
  
Home is where the heart is  
But at times a good home must be broken  
The wine has grown bitter  
From the harsh words we have spoken  
  
If you should need me deep in the night  
At shades of twilight  
If theres a reason for livin without me  
Just let me know and Ill go on livin
