Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
How to choose  
Who to be  
Well lets see  
There are so many choices now  
Play guitar be a movie star  
In my head a voice says  
Why not try everything  
Why stop reach for any dream  
I can rock cause its my life  
And nows the time  
  
Chorus  
Who will I be  
Its up to me  
All the never ending possibilities  
That I can see  
Theres nothing that I cant do  
Who will I be  
Yes I believe  
I get to make the future what I want to  
If I can become anyone and know the choice is up to me  
Who will I be  
  
Yeah yeah  
  
If I decide  
Im the girl to change the world  
I can do it any time  
Opportunity right in front of me  
And the choice is all mine  
  
Why not try everything  
Why stop reach for any dream  
I can rock cause its my life  
And nows the time  
  
Chorus  
  
I wanna find the who I am inside  
Who will I be  
I wanna show the the way that I can shine  
Yeah Oh yeah yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Who will I be  
Who will I be
