And I never really sleep anymore  
And I always get those dangerous dreams  
And I never get a minute of peace  
And I gotta wonder what it means  
And I gotta wonder what it means  
Maybe its nothing and Im under the weather  
Maybe its just one of those bugs going round  
Maybe Im under a spell and its magic  
Maybe theres a witch doctor with an office in town  
  
Is this a blessing Or is it a curse  
Does it get any better Can it get any worse  
Will it go on forever Is it over tonight  
Does it come with the darkness Does it bring out the light  
Is it richer than diamonds  
Or just a little cheaper than spit  
  
I dont know what it is but it just wont quit  
I dont know what it is but it just wont quit  
I dont know what it is but it just wont quit  
I dont know what it is but it just wont quit  
  
And there used to be such an easy way of living  
And there used to be every hope in the world  
And I used to get everything that I went after  
But there never used to be this girl  
No there never used to be this girl  
  
Maybe Im crazy and Im losing my senses  
Maybe Im possessed by a spirit or such  
Maybe Im desperate and I got no defenses  
Can you get me a prescription for that one perfect touch  
  
Is this a blessing Or is it a curse  
Does it get any better Can it get any worse  
Will it go on forever Is it over tonight  
Does it come with the darkness Does it bring out the light  
Is it richer than diamonds  
Or just a little cheaper than spit  
  
I dont know what it is but it just wont quit  
I dont know what it is but it just wont quit  
I dont know what it is but it just wont quit  
I dont know what it is but it just wont quit  
  
There was a time when nothing ever really mattered  
There was a time when there was nothing I didnt know  
There was a time when I knew just what I was living for  
There was a time and the time was so long ago  
There was a time and the time was so long ago  
And I never really sleep anymore
