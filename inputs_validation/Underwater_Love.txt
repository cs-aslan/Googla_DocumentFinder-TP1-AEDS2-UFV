Looking down into the water  
Its hard to make your face  
If our love is drowning then why  
Do I feel so out of place  
Bubbling up to the surface  
Are you getting a breath of fresh air  
Forever longing to make you mine  
But I cant escape your stare  
Liquid seeps into your lungs  
But your eyes look so serene  
Its wonderful how the surface ripples  
But youre perfect and I cannot breathe  
Forever longing to make you mine  
But I cant escape your stare  
Hold me closer keep me near  
Ill never get enough  
Touch me from below  
Ill never let you go  
But I cant escape
