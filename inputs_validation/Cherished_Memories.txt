Youre goin away away from me  
But here in my heart is a memory  
The way we met the way we kissed  
The way we fell in love  
Oh the little secrets that we shared  
When I was sad the way you cared  
To let me know youd understand  
The way youd hold my hand  
Cherished memories the things that a fellow cant forget  
Cherished memories youre leaving but I love you yet  
And now you say that we must part  
And even though it breaks my heart  
Theres one thing you cant take from me  
Thats my cherished memories
