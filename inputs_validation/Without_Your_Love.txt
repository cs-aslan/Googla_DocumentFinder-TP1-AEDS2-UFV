Its late at night nothins feelin right  
Since youve gone away  
I think I know why you left this time  
But its still hard to say  
I nearly lost it when he came around you  
Now Im holdin it all inside and its killin me  
  
We used to meet at an old cafe in ChiTown  
At first you could hear the wind stop  
Then my heart would pound  
I remember everything you used to do girl  
Now Im learning something that you already knew  
  
Chorus  
Its not the same without your love  
Every night and every day girl  
Its not the same without your love  
You dont have to be afraid  
Its not the same without your love  
Every night and every day girl  
Its not the same without your love  
  
I see you through the door with your motor runnin  
I can still hear the sound  
I knew then when you asked him in you let your guard down  
Youre talking soft dont tell me  
I know youre sincere  
I just called to tell you Im the only one here  
  
Chorus
