Hurry sundown let the weary day be over  
Im so tired of hurt Ive been taken  
My heart has been aching so  
Dont mind struggling dont mind livin a little  
If someday my kids are laughing together  
And have things I never own  
I can feel many changes are coming  
Beat them drums in a distance a drumming  
Telling the world a new future has begun  
Yes you got to hurry sundown  
I cant wait to see the morning  
Theres a lot of work I must lend a hand to  
So bring on that brand new day  
Afraid tomorrow is on its way  
So hurry down hurry down sweet sun
