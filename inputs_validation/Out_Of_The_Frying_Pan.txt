Out of the frying pan and into the fire  
  
Its only two oclock and the tempertures beginning to soar  
And all around the city you see the walking wounded and the living dead  
Its never been this hot and Ive never been so bored  
And breathing is just no fun anymore  
And then I saw you like a summer dream  
And youre the answer to every prayer that I ever said  
I saw you like a summer dream  
And youre the answer to every prayer that I ever said  
  
You can feel the pulse of the pavement racing like a runaway horse  
The subways are steaming and the skin of the street is gleaming with sweat  
Ive seen you sitting on the steps outside  
And you were looking so restless and reckless and lost  
I think its time for you to come inside  
Ill be waiting here with something that youll never forget  
I think its time for you to come inside  
Ill be waiting here with something that youll never forget  
  
Come on come on  
And therell be no turning back  
You were only killing time and itll kill you right back  
Come on come on  
Its time to burn up the fuse  
Youve got nothing to do and even less to lose  
Youve got nothing to do and even less to lose  
  
So wander down the ancient hallway  
Taking the stairs only one at a time  
Follow the sound of my heartbeat now  
Im in the room at the top youre at the end of the line  
Open the door and lay down on the bed  
The sun is just a ball of desire  
  
And I wanna take you out of the frying pan and into the fire  
Out of the frying pan and into the fire  
Out of the frying pan and into the fire  
  
And I wanna take you out of the frying pan and into the fire  
Out of the frying pan and into the fire  
Out of the frying pan and into the fire  
  
And into the fire fire fire  
And into the fire fire fire  
And into the fire fire fire  
And into the fire  
  
Its only two oclock and the tempertures beginning to soar  
And all around the city you see the walking wounded and the living dead  
Its never been this hot and Ive never been so bored  
And breathing is just no fun anymore  
And then I saw you like a summer dream  
And youre the answer to every prayer that I ever said

Out of the frying pan and into the fire

Out of the frying pan and into the fire  
Out of the frying pan and into the fire  
  
And into the fire fire fire  
And into the fire fire fire  
And into the fire fire fire  
And into the fire
