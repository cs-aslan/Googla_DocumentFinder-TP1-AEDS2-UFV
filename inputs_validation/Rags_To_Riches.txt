Its a sign of the times standing in line  
Quietly waiting to go out of your mind  
Theres nothing to say no reason to stay  
To fight for the right that they have taken away  
Get what you get not what you need  
Time after time  
  
1 Rags to riches all fallen down  
Rags to riches tied up and bound  
Theres no going under  
When youre kicked to the ground  
Rags to richesrags to riches  
  
Youre down on your knees caught in the freeze  
Crying inside but theres no easy release  
Radical viewsin yesterday news  
Giving the reason with another excuse  
Out on your own cut to the bone  
Time after time  
  
repeat 1x2
