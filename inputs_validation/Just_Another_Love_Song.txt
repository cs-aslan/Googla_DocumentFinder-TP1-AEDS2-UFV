Sit alone waiting on the morning  
Woman leaving her whole life behind  
train rolling on taking mamas baby home  
no one knows whats going through her mind  
  
Just another love song Im singing  
And you know people sing them all of the time  
Just another lonesome guitar ringing  
The only difference is this one is mine  
  
Freedom Lord what a funny word  
We search for it just like some kind of fool  
Woman leaving home man sits there all alone  
Little child is paying all the dues
