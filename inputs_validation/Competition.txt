Yeah youre such a gentleman  
You always open doors for me  
But you see us kind of different  
Its like you always have to be  
The first one to open his mouth  
The last one to throw in the towel  
Its time to show your selfout  
Boy youre trying  
  
Just a little bit too hard  
I thought I told you when we met  
That all I get for who you are  
But I treat you like an argument  
I dont need to speak in my mind  
Im too grown Im taking my time  
Im sick of hearing you rhyme  
Listen baby  
  
You dont have to come first  
Second is okay cause you aint never beated me  
  
I say it once  
You say it twice  
You know I like a little competition from time to time  
You think Im wrong when I know Im right  
You lose this aint no kind of competition  
I like a man with ambition  
For when you gonna know its time to let go  
Cause I think Im about to lose my mind  
  
Tell me does this scare you  
That Im living my dream  
Now I dont mean to hurt you  
But you make me wanna scream  
You smile while grinding your teeth  
You clap and stomping your feet  
You act about 17  
Im so tired  
  
You dont have to come first  
Second is okay cause you aint never beated me  
  
I say it once  
You say it twice  
You know I like a little competition from time to time  
You think Im wrong when I know Im right  
You lose this aint no kind of competition  
I like a man with ambition  
For when you gonna know its time to let go  
Cause I think Im about to lose my mind  
  
I can do it better  
You know I can do it better  
  
What are you trying to prove  
What is it with you  
Always thinking  
  
I can do it better  
You know I can do it better  
  
Baby I cant stand  
Always argument  
Why you wanna fight  
Why you always fight  
  
You aint always right  
I can do it better every day and every night  
I can do it better every day and every night  
  
I say it once  
You say it twice  
You know I like a little competition from time to time  
You think Im wrong when I know Im right  
You lose this aint no kind of competition  
I like a man with ambition  
For when you gonna know its time to let go  
Cause I think Im about to lose my mind
