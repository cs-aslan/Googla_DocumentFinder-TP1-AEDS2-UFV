Damnation Religion Salvation Fire and steel  
  
I have seen the fire  
Of a thousand suns pass by  
While blasphemers fill the air  
Bearing false witness  
Now we rise  
All ye children of the wild  
Fists like hammers fill the air  
Vast legions all immortal  
Smash the stilness everywhere  
  
HolyHoly War  
  
Holy  
We are fightingfigthing a Holy War  
Holy War  
See us fly on winds of doom  
Holy War  
Baptized in fire and steel  
Holy War  
For the end we bring is soon  
Holy War  
Now face the storm  
A Holy War  
  
Brothers of metal know no masters  
Metals our religion  
Take it to the grave  
Rulers of the earth  
Our down of glory  
All Rebornwe live again  
Hold trueye sacred army  
Our last battle is at hand  
Sweep these dogs from our kingdom  
Bless this ground our holy land  
  
HolyHoly War  
  
Holy  
We are fightingfigthing a Holy War  
Holy Way  
See us fly on winds of doom  
Holy War  
Baptized in fire and steel  
Holy War  
For the end we bring is soon  
Holy War  
Now face the storm  
A Holy War
