What you been doin aint you got no one  
Where you been keepin yourself my friend  
Have you been hidin underground riding  
Foolin yourself in your special way  
Wheres your old lady  
She was a nice girl  
Maybe its best that she went away  
You have been losin nothing can change you  
Hapiness spits in your face always  
Where are you going what will you see there  
You never learn nothin by runnin away  
What you been doin aint you got no one  
Where you been keepin yourself my friend  
Loneliness growin emptiness showin  
Finding your peace two or three times a day  
Three times a day
