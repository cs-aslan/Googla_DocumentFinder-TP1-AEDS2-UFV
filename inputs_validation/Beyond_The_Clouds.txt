So long ago has it been that long  
Since we felt the sun  
Where has it gone to  
Has it hid from the world  
Have we lost our way  
  
I can remember it filling the sky  
And itd warm my face  
The summers were endless  
But theyre over now  
That was yesterday  
  
I know well find love again  
If we all pray a little  
The heart will break free  
  
Beyond the clouds  
Thats where my soul waits  
Shes waiting now  
Beyond the clouds  
  
Sorrow seems endless  
Now theres only so much  
That a man can bear  
Hold on so tender  
To a glimmer of faith  
Gets me half way there  
I know it will shine again  
With some prayer and some patience  
Well find our way home  
  
Beyond the clouds  
Thats where my soul waits  
Shes waiting now  
Just beyond  
  
Beyond anything youve ever known  
Oh so beautiful  
Like a summer sky  
Oh you know it wont be long  
If we find the strength I know  
There beyond the clouds  
Well find the sun  
  
Beyond the clouds  
Thats where my soul waits oh yeah  
Shes waiting now  
Beyond  
  
Beyond the clouds  
Thats where my love waits  
Shes waiting now  
Beyond the clouds  
  
Yeah thats it now oh  
Oh thats it now baby oh  
Beyond everything youve ever known  
Oh if I could find the strength I know  
Well find the sun
