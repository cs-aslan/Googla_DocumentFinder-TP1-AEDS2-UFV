Anything for my baby  
I would steal anything for my baby  
Id wheel and deal anything for my baby  
  
Oh  
Im in love and it feels so good  
Cause I need her dont mistreat her  
And I tell her so  
  
When I saw her and she looked my way  
I was lonely shes my only  
And Ive gotta say that  
  
I would steal anything for my baby  
Id wheel and deal anything for my baby  
Crawl or kneel anything for my baby  
  
In the morning when I raise my head  
Shes beside me she can hide me  
When Im feelin low  
  
If Im thinkin everythings all wrong  
My girl shakes me she awakes me  
Then I really know that  
  
I would steal anything for my baby  
Id wheel and deal anything for my baby  
Crawl or kneel anything for my baby  
  
Dont you know that  
I would steal anything for my baby  
I would wheel and deal anything for my baby  
I would crawl or kneel anything for my baby  
Id do anything  
  
I would give anything for my baby  
I would die or live anything for my baby  
I would tttttake or give anything for my baby  
  
Yes I would take anything for my baby  
I would build or break anything for my baby  
I would rob or take anything for my baby  
  
I would do anything for my baby  
I would steal anything for my baby  
I would wheel and deal
