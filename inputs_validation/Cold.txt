The coldest shoulder cast in metal  
Frozen to the bone  
To rely on hook line and sinker  
What a sinker  
Sinking like a stone  
Youd be better off alone  
She saw me on the television underneath the sun  
Thought that I was warm like mother lover brother  
Brother she was wrong  
Me I dont long to belong  
Cold been excommunicated cause Im cold  
My temperatures been rated and Im cold  
Bring to me my big old sweater  
Nothing more will make me better  
I met her on Monday and my heart did nothing new  
Seems she thought of me as some mystic fatalistic mystical guru  
Me I havent got a clue  
But floating on a magic carpet high above the earth  
You can see the world like a Buddha bread and Buddha  
Bigger than you hurt  
Dont you know that love is work  
Cold no heat on the horizon guess Im cold  
And Capricorn is rising yes Im cold  
Listened to my old Nockles  
Hoped that it would warm the cockles  
You cant fight the fear you cant this is the road youre on  
You dont belong to me you dont belong to any one  
Your reputation lies not in your eyes but those who dare  
Will bite the hand that feeds when it dont meet your needs  
When you got blood to bleed you got a life to lead  
In the flood with my blood I can hold you  
Cold been excommunicated cause Im cold  
My temperatures been rated and Im cold  
Bring to me my big old sweater  
Nothing more will make me better  
Cold no heat on the horizon guess Im cold  
Therell be no compromising cold cool cold  
Stone cold  
Stone cold  
Cold  
Cold  
Cold
