The streets were cold and barren  
The nights were dark and dank  
And the sky hadnt had a rain cloud in it for 25 years  
The buildings were dead and the alleys  
Stunk from things that used to live there  
Ahhh that wasnt the city I remembered  
  
A Child in the street barefoot pullin at his  
Mamas tattered coattails like a rat dogs existence  
With not a scrap left on the plate  
And so much like a fable their lives so unstable  
Cause the only thing left was their faith  
And there sure as hell aint much I can do  
About it  
  
Theres a Meltdown in the sky  
Theres a new day comin and I dont know why  
Theres a fear that gets me high  
And the cold night numbs as the Jet Black clouds roll on by  
  
So sad was the scene that my eyes did behold  
Made me wonder just who was the foe  
And was it all to come true what Nostradamus  
Had predicted such a long long time ago  
You could hear screams and moanin  
From the people atoning  
For their sins of a guilt ridden life  
And the final door shuts  
From the wind that leaves cuts  
From the edge on the blade of Gods knife  
And there sure as hell aint much I can do about  
  
Theres a Melt Down in the Sky  
Theres a new day comin and I dont know why  
Theres a tear stuck in my eye  
Theres a new day comin and I dont know why  
  
Battle lines had been drawn  
Mother nature how she cried  
By her side till the dawn  
Couldnt kill her if they tried  
How they tried open eyed genocide  
Then She died
