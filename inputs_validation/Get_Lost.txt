I dont want to feel all cooped up  
I feel like Im on a chain  
I got my ride all souped up  
Were never coming back again  
Time it dont mean nothing  
Money means even less  
Dont bring nothin baby  
Youre better then all the rest  
I wanna go get lost  
I wanna go get lost  
I wanna go get I wanna go get lost  
  
When you wear that real tight sweater  
You know I cant resist  
Its been that way forever baby  
Ever since we kissed  
Roll down all the windows  
Turn up Wolfman Jack  
Please please love me tender  
Aint nothin wrong with that  
Lets go get lost yeah  
Lets go get lost yeah  
Lets go get lost  
I wanna go get lost yeah  
  
Whatever that they told you about me  
Well all of its true  
Youre never gonna be with out me baby  
Im never gonna be without you  
Top it off fill it with high test  
Think about it what cha gonna tell your boss  
Think about it what cha gonna tell your boss  
Think about it what cha gonna tell your boss  
Think about it what cha gonna tell your boss  
  
And get lost  
I just wanna get I just wanna get lost  
I wanna get lost  
I just wanna get  
I just wanna get  
I just wanna get  
I want to get  
I just wanna get  
I just wanna get lost  
All night long  
All night long  
All night long  
All night long  
  
I wanna get lost  
Just wanna get lost  
I wanna get lost  
I wanna get lost
