This hot night wind is mine I know  
This gust of love aint no liar  
Steamed up blown up stoked from below  
Im a ready to cook with fire  
  
She cattin around to catch you man  
And butters you up to buy her  
Darling shes just a flash in the pan  
Dont you want to cook with fire  
  
Im talkin bout kickin the role  
I want to give you whole thing  
Yes she gonna burn ya  
She gonna make you a fool  
But itll learn ya  
Way way better than school  
That I got a soul thats got a spark  
Oh yeah holdin a real hot wire  
You got a hungry flame in the dark  
And lord we gonna cook it with fire  
  
That I got a soul thats got a spark  
Oh yeah holdin a real hot wire  
You got a hungry flame in the dark  
And lord we gonna cook it with fire  
  
Cookin with fire fire fire
