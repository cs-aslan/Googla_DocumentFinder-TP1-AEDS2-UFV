He followed her to work this morning  
Hed never seen that dress before  
She seemed to sail right through  
Those dark clouds forming  
That he knows hes headed for  
After seven years of marriage  
He wanted out  
Now after seven months of freedom  
Its clear that theres no doubt  
Shes gonna make it  
And he never will  
Hes at the foot of the mountain  
And shes over that hill  
Hes sinkin at sea  
And her sails are filled  
Shes gonna make it  
And he never will  
And you know its not like shes forgot about him  
Shes just dealing with the pain  
And the fact that shes survived so well without him  
You know its driving him insane  
And the crazy thing about it  
Is shed take him back  
But the fool in him that walked out  
Is the fool who just wont ask  
Shes gonna make it  
And he never will  
Hes at the foot of the mountain  
And shes over that hill  
Hes sinkin at sea  
And her sails are filled  
Shes gonna make it  
And he never will  
Shes gonna make it  
He never will
