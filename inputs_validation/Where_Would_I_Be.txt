Ive been waiting  
For so long  
Ive been hoping  
Your loves not gone  
Houses are sliding in the mud  
Rivers are raging in your blood  
Where would I be  
Without your love  
Where would I be  
Without your arms around me  
You were to be  
  
The only one  
If I knew you  
I would not run  
You have been  
Cloudy distant and dark  
Im thinking of  
Noah and the ark  
Where would I be  
Without your love  
Where would I be  
Without your arms around me
