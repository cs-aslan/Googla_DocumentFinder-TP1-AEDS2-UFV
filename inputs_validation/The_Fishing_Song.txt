Its early in the morning way before dawn  
I down a cup of coffee put my lucky hat on  
Get down to the water before all the crowds  
Gonna have more fun than the law allows  
With my hot rod I go out to prove  
When Im on the prowl I never lose  
I fire up my Merc and put the throttle down  
Cause Ive got the fastest fishing boat in town  
I open up my tackle box its so big  
Crank baits sink baits beer and jigs  
Got my bobbers on and my 10 pound test  
Gonna catch me a lunker gonna be the best  
Gonna go fishing Gonna have some fun  
Gonna go fishing Cause its number one  
Gonna go fishing Gonna sit on my butt  
Gonna catch a fish And scrape out its guts  
Ahhh fishing  
I fish on the lake by the sunken tree stump  
Between the sewage output and the chemical dump  
Dont swim in the lake says a sign on a tree  
Its a good thing that fish cant read  
I got my 10 dollar lure the one that floats  
And I make a big cast from my 20 grand boat  
With my thousand dollar rod or maybe its more  
Gonna catch me a fish thats 5 bucks at the store  
Gonna go fishing Gonna have some fun  
Gonna go fishing Cause its number one  
Gonna go fishing Gonna sit on my butt  
Gonna catch a fish And scrape out its guts  
Ahhh fishing  
I feel something tugging on the end of my line  
Tug tug tug tug tug that line  
Im gonna catch a fish its gonna be so fine  
Fish fish fish fish fish so fine  
Oh it feels so good to touch fish slime  
Slime slime slime slime fishy slime  
Theres nothing else to do with my free time  
Time time time time waste of time  
Guitar solo
