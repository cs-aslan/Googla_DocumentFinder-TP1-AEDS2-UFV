Im a pretty pretty rebel  
I know youll never find another girl like me  
I want it on another level  
No youll never find a girl who rides like me  
I called you on the phone and youre hiding oh  
I know you locked the door boy let me in Oh  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know  
Im gonna come and take control  
You cant leave  
Im gonna start from down bellow  
And Ill be done before you know  
Im gonna come and take control  
You wont breathe  
Oh Ill eat you up alive  
Swallow all your pride  
Im gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know  
Im gonna come and take control  
Thats the deal  
Im a black widow  
Im a black widow  
  
With my eight hands I can hold you  
Theres no way I will ever let you go  
All your friends tried to warn you  
Boy you had to take a chance and now you know  
Just another name crossed off the list oh  
And when its over theres no goodbye kiss  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know  
Im gonna come and take control  
You cant leave  
Im gonna start from down bellow  
And Ill be done before you know  
Im gonna come and take control  
You wont breathe  
Oh Ill eat you up alive  
Swallow all your pride  
Im gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know  
Im gonna come and take control  
Thats the deal  
Im a black widow  
Im a black widow  
  
No theres no time for rescuing  
Know you were just a fling yeah  
Now that the dark is settling  
You can go you can go you can  
You can go you can go  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know  
Im gonna come and take control  
You cant leave  
Im gonna start from down bellow  
And Ill be done before you know  
Im gonna come and take control  
You wont breathe  
Oh Ill eat you up alive  
Swallow all your pride  
Im gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know  
Im gonna come and take control  
Thats the deal  
Im a black widow  
Im a black widow
