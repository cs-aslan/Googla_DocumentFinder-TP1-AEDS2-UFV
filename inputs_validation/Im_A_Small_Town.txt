Well Ive been around  
Since before the trains came through  
Well Ive seen a lot  
But the first time my heart broke in two  
Was when they brought those Johnson brothers back  
To their momma with a flag  
  
Well Im a small town  
  
Theres hundreds just like me  
Yeah but Im the one  
Well you happen to be  
When you learned how to ride your first bike  
Up and down my street  
Well you grew up  
And couldnt wait to just get out  
  
Im a small town  
  
Where everyone knows everyone  
There aint no secrets around here  
Sonny there you love me  
You hang me for everything I am  
Either I hold your heart  
Or I hold you down  
  
Im a small town  
Just a dot there on the map  
If you blink you miss me  
Yeah well go ahead and laugh  
But Im where you kissed your first someone  
Im where you hit your last home run  
Im where you lay your grandpa in the ground  
  
Yeah Im a small town  
  
Where everyone knows everyone  
There aint no secrets around here  
Sonny there you love me  
You hang me for everything I am  
Either I hold your heart  
Or I hold you down  
  
Im a small town  
  
You left in a cloud of dust  
Big city bound  
But I never once gave up  
And when you looked into that newborn angels eyes  
And it occurred  
There was only one place good enough for here  
  
Where everyone knows everyone  
There aint no secrets around here  
Sonny there you love me  
You hang me for everything I am  
Either I hold your heart  
Or I hold you down  
  
Im a small town  
  
Im a small town  
  
Im a small town  
Im a small town  
Im a small town  
Yeah Im a small town
