I cant be cool or nonchalant  
Call me an impulsive fool  
Youre all I want  
You may be right  
Its too much to soon  
To talk of love all night  
In your bedroom  
I dont know why  
It always comes as a surprise  
To find Im here with you  
You smile and I am rubbing my eyes  
At a dream come true  
I wont play games or waste your time  
But I wont feel ashamed to speak my mind  
So just relax  
Dont question why for calculated facts  
Will not apply  
I dont know why  
It always comes as a surprise  
To find Im here with you  
You smile and I am rubbing my eyes  
At a dream come true  
In my life thereve been few  
Whove affected me the way you do  
You do you do  
Ill tell no lies I wont pretend  
But if youve a broken heart  
Ill help it mend  
I dont know why  
It always comes as a surprise  
To find Im here with you  
You smile and I am rubbing my eyes  
At a dream come true  
Smile and I am rubbing my eyes  
At a dream come true
