Oh oh oh oh  
The waters getting deep  
And I cant swim  
Because its dirty dirty water  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Manys the times Ive asked you to say  
Why do you feel so bad day to day  
Could it be youre wrong  
To push yourself along  
I say its not a guess  
You make yourself a mess  
And get yourself in deeper water  
  
Why do you think its all wrong for you  
Maybe its in some things that you do  
Baby its allright  
To stay out evry night  
If I could change your mind  
Id bring you back in line  
To do the things you really oughta  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
The waters getting deep  
And I cant swim  
And if I could then Id come in  
Oh oh oh oh  
The waters getting deep  
And I cant swim  
Because its dirty dirty water  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh why do you think its all wrong for you  
Maybe its in some things that you do  
Baby its allright  
To stay out evry night  
If I could change your mind  
Id bring you back in line  
To do the things you really oughta  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
The waters getting deep  
And I cant swim  
If I could then Id come in  
Oh oh oh oh  
The waters getting deep  
And I cant swim  
Because its dirty dirty water  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
The waters getting deep  
And I cant swim  
Because its dirty dirty water
