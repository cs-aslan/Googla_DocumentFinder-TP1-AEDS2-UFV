You can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul  
Like she does  
And shed be the one to swear that he hung  
The moon above  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
  
She knows him inside out  
The things he dreams about  
And makes them come true when she can  
She knows all of his faults  
The demons hes fought  
With nothin but his hardworkin hands  
  
And he calls out her name  
In passion and pain  
She makes him stronger each time  
Yeah its there on her lips  
And her fingertips  
That shes with him to til end of the line  
  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves yes you can  
Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul  
Like she does and shed be the one to swear that he hung  
The moon above  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
  
You can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul  
Like she does  
And shed be the one to swear that he hung  
The moon above  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves

By the woman he loves  
He loves  
He always loves
