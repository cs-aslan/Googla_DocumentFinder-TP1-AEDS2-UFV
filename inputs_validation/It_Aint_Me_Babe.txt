Go way from my window  
Leave at your own chosen speed  
Im not the one you want babe  
Im not the one you need  
You say youre lookin for someone  
Whos never weak but always strong  
To protect you an defend you  
Whether you are right or wrong  
Someone to open each and every door  
But it aint me babe  
No no no it aint me babe  
It aint me youre lookin for babe  
  
Go lightly from the ledge babe  
Go lightly on the ground  
Im not the one you want babe  
I will only let your down  
You say youre lookin for someone  
Who will promise never to part  
Someone to close his eyes for you  
Someone to close his heart  
Someone who will die for you an more  
But it aint me babe  
No no no it aint me babe  
It aint me youre lookin for babe  
  
Go melt back into the night  
Everything inside is made of stone  
Theres nothing in here moving  
An anyway Im not alone  
You say youre looking for someone  
Wholl pick you up each time you fall  
To gather flowers constantly  
An to come each time you call  
A lover for you life an nothing more  
But it aint me babe  
No no no it aint me babe  
It aint me youre lookin for babe
