They shot my homie for nothing killed my homie for nothing  
I smoke blunts everyday to try to wish it didnt happen  
But I cant bring him back cause I am only a mortal  
People think Im a god but to me Im only normal  
I used to trap on the corner trap  with the thermal  
I had that TEC in the bushes run up on me I burn you  
Folks they come to Atlanta just to ride through my zone  
Wanna see where I trapped at they wanna see whats my home  
In the place that I said everything that I meant  
I got so many pounds in the apartment think I got dreads  
I got money in the bed so I sleep with the bread  
If you play with Bricksquad them might take off your head  
  
Im so high fuck nigga Im so high  
Im so high baby girl Im so high  
She get high your baby girl she get fucked up  
And he get high you know that nigga fuck his nose up  
Im so high fuck nigga Im so high

She so high but bitch with me so she good night  
And you so broke you looking at us with all this ice

Bigger nigga get a bigger gun hit his ass in his bigger face  
Bigger  and I fuck with him half the niggas he with her dont like  
That young nigga bout trigger play and my section Lil Jay like nigga day  
Reiterate Im bout pistol play anything with my pistol say  
Shoulder deep in this cocaine but nigga I can hold the weight  
Appraise me Im a mill today  
A mill and a mill made a mill today  
Say you wanna do a show whats the rate  
Told a nigga fifty with a steel face  
Smoking on kush and Im drinking on grapes I feel just like Im Pimp C  
Say Gucci Mane you a murderer so you cant get a sponsor like Pepsi  
Say Pepsi fuck you cause I fuck with the CocaCola anyway  
On check day its booming but its real slow on rent day

And he get high you know that nigga fuck his nose up

She so high but bitch with me so she good night  
And you so broke you looking at us with all this ice
