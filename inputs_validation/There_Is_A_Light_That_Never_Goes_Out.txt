Take me out tonight  
Where theres music and theres people  
And theyre young and alive  
Driving in your car  
I never never want to go home  
Because I havent got one  
Anymore  
  
Take me out tonight  
Because I want to see people and I  
Want to see life  
Driving in your car  
Oh please dont drop me home  
Because its not my home its their  
Home and Im welcome no more  
  
And if a doubledecker bus  
Crashes into us  
To die by your side  
Is such a heavenly way to die  
And if a tenton truck  
Kills the both of us  
To die by your side  
Well the pleasure  the privilege is mine  
  
Take me out tonight  
Take me anywhere I dont care  
I dont care I dont care  
And in the darkened underpass  
I thought oh God my chance has come at last  
But then a strange fear gripped me and I  
Just couldnt ask  
  
Take me out tonight  
Oh take me anywhere I dont care  
I dont care I dont care  
Driving in your car  
I never never want to go home  
Because I havent got one  
Oh I havent got one  
  
And if a doubledecker bus  
Crashes into us  
To die by your side  
Is such a heavenly way to die  
And if a tenton truck  
Kills the both of us  
To die by your side  
Well the pleasure  the privilege is mine  
  
Oh there is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out
