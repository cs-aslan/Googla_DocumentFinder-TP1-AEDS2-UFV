I can imagine nothing more tedious  
Than trying to have fun with you again  
Maybe its just something in my mind  
But I hate feeling like Im trying all the time  
Its a kind of lie  
When we pretend that were still friends  
  
Im sure youre not exactly short of people to  
hang out and laugh at your jokes  
Tell you you look great  
You wouldnt want me around  
Making it all feel forced   
And put down  
  
And every time I smile to wonder if Im laughin at you  
And with every little grin you dont want to be wonderin  
Just exactly what it is Im taking pleasure in  
  
Although I always said  
We were basically the same and all one  
All one  
Its so easy to persuade myself  
Im clockwork and youre quartz  
  
I guess that irony  
Will surely be  
The death of me  
  
And every time I smile dyou wonder if Im laughin at you  
And with every little grin you dont want to be wonderin  
  
Although I always said  
We were basically the same and all one  
All one  
Its so easy to persuade myself  
Im clockwork and youre quartz  
  
Youre only happy when youre oiled and jewelled  
Youre only happy when you wind me up and I know  
Youre so reliable it isnt true  
And its so easy for me to break down  
If I could jump a ride between the skin and silicon then  
We could join hands and understand Hallelujah  
But I listen  
to the ticking  
I guess were worlds apart  
Its so hard  
So hard  
  
I know theres no going back  
And you know theres no going back  
  
Youre only happy when youre oiled and jewelled  
Youre only happy when youre oiled and jewelled  
Youre never happy  
  
I need maintenance  
I need patience  
Im not foolproof  
Im not waterproof  
Im not shockproof  
Bombproof  
Bulletproof  
Fireproof  
Leakproof  
Childproof  
Stainproof  
Pressureproof  
  
I know I told myself  
Were all basically the same and all one all one  
whyknow sometimes I just cant help myself  
Im clockwork and youre quartz  
Im clockwork and youre quartz  
  
I know I never get the balance right  
And turn up half an hour late night after night  
And being totally dependable is so very commendable  
Although youre never wrong  
One of these days youre just gonna stop
