I leave the gas on  
Walk the allies in the dark  
Sleep with candles burning  
I leave the door unlocked  
Im weaving a rope and  
Running all the red lights  
Did I get your attention  
Cause Im sending all the signs and  
The clock is ticking  
And Ill be giving my two weeks  
  
Pick your favorite shade of black  
Youd best prepare a speech  
Say something funny  
Say something sweet  
But dont say that you loved me  
  
Chorus  
Cause Im still breathing  
But weve been dead for awhile  
This sickness has no cure  
Were goin down for sure  
Already lost a grip  
Best abandon ship  
  
Maybe I was too pale  
Maybe I was too fat  
Maybe you wanted better better luck in the sack  
No formal education  
I swear way too much  
I swear you didnt care  
Cause we were in love  
  
So as I write this letter and shed my last tear  
No its all for the better  
That we end this here  
Lets close this chapter  
Say one last prayer  
But dont say that you loved me  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Im still breathing  
Im still breathing
