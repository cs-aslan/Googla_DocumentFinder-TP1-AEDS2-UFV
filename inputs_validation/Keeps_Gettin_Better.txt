Step back gonna come at ya fast  
Im driving out of control  
And getting ready to crash  
Wont stop shaking up what I can  
I serve it up in a shot  
So suck it down like a man  
So baby yes I know what I am  
And no I dont give a damn  
And youll be loving it  
  
Some days Im a super bitch  
Up to my old tricks  
But it wont last forever  
Next day Im your super girl  
Out to save the world  
And it keeps gettin better  
  
Kiss kiss gonna tell you right now  
Ill make it sweet on the lips as it can knock you out  
Shut up I dont care what you say  
Cuz when we both in the ring youre gonna like it my way  
Yeah baby theres a villain in me so sexy sour and sweet  
And youll be loving it  
  
Some days Im a super bitch  
Up to my old tricks  
But it wont last forever  
Next day Im your super girl  
Out to save the world  
And it keeps gettin better  
  
Hold on  
It keeps gettin better  
Hold on  
It keeps gettin better  
  
In the blink of an eye  
In the speed of the light  
Ill hold the universe up  
And make your planets collide  
When I strap on my boots  
And I slip on my suit  
You see the vixen in me  
Becomes an angel for you  
  
Some days Im a super bitch  
Up to my old tricks  
But it wont last forever  
Next day Im your super girl  
Out to save the world  
And it keeps gettin better  
  
Some days Im a super bitch  
Up to my old tricks  
But it wont last forever  
Next day Im your super girl  
Out to save the world  
And it keeps gettin better  
  
Hold on  
Keeps gettin better  
Hold on  
Keeps gettin better
