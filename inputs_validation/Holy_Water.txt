Holy water on the brain  
And Im losing sleep  
Holy bible on the night stand  
Next to me  
As Im raped by another  
Monkey circus freak  
Trying to take my  
Indigence away from me  
  
Holy water is rusting me  
Bloody murder is the best  
Ive heard her scream  
Holy devil in the flesh  
Some might believe  
And they take thine  
Majesty so seriously  
Its the big lies  
That are more likely to be believed  
  
Holy water is rusting me  
Damn the water if its life  
You want to drink  
Mind your mother if  
It makes you feel at ease  
As youre raped by another  
Monkey circus freak  
Its the big lies that are  
More likely to be believed
