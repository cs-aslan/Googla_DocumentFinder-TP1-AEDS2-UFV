Run run til you drop  
Hide everyone knows  
We all trade in neverbefores  
Selling out for the score  
  
Prey squeal when youre caught  
Cry its not my fault  
Time to trade in neverbefores  
Selling out for the score  
  
It seems you prophesized  
All of this would end  
Were you burned away  
When the sun rose again  
  
Hate long wearing thin  
Negative all youve been  
Time to trade in neverbefores  
Selling out for the score  
  
It seems you prophesized  
All of this would end  
Were you burned away  
When the sun rose again
