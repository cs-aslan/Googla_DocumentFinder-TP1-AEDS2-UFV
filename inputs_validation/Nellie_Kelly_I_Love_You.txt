Chorus  
  
Its the same old song they sing  
I love you  
The boys are all mad about Nellie  
Daughter of officer Kelly  
And its all day long they bring  
Flowers all dripping with dew  
And they join in the chorus of Nellie Kelly  
I love you  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Dance with me  
You know Id adore it with  
Dance with me  
Im thrilled to death oare it  
Dance with me  
Ive been waiting for it with you  
  
Its a lovely night when we are dancing together  
Its a lovely night but the forecast says stormy weather  
  
All of you  
Id like to be dancing with  
All of you  
Perhaps be romancing with  
All of you  
It would be entrancing  
Thats true  
But it isnt quite fair to the rest  
So if you will all line up abreast  
I will dance with the one I like best  
  
Repeat Chorus
