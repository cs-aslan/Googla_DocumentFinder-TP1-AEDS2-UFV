Friday finally came around  
This girls ready to paint the town  
Tonight aint nothin gonna slow me down  
  
I did my time workin all week  
Tonights all mine tomorrow Ill sleep  
I want to hear a band with a country sound  
  
Well Ive been couped up all week long  
Ive been workin my fingers to the bone  
  
Chorus  
Well its a girls night out  
Honey there aint no doubt  
Im gonna dance every dance til the boys go home  
Well its my night to rock  
No watchin that ol clock  
Oh aint no doubt Lordy its a girls night out  
  
Two step or the Cotton Eye Joe  
They can play em fast or they can play em slow  
I can do em all just show me the floor  
You can give me a little rock n roll  
Or even a waltz with the lights down low  
Ill still be dancin when they close the door  
  
Chorus
