Chorus  
Im all lost in the supermarket  
I can no longer shop happily  
I came in here for that special offer  
A guaranteed personality  
  
I wasnt born so much as I fell out  
Nobody seemed to notice me  
We had a hedge back home in the suburbs  
Over which I never could see  
  
I heard the people who lived on the ceiling  
Scream and fight most scarily  
Hearing that noise was my first ever feeling  
Thats how its been all around me  
  
Chorus  
  
Im all tuned in I see all the programs  
I save coupons from packets of tea  
Ive got my giant hit discotheque album  
I empty a bottle and I feel a bit free  
  
The kids in the halls and the pipes in the walls  
Make me noises for company  
Long distance callers make long distance calls  
And the silence makes me lonely  
  
Chorus  
  
And its not hear  
It disappear  
Im all lost
