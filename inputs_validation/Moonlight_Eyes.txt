Moonlight eyes I see you smile  
It lightens up my night  
Your smile takes all the fight out of me  
Moonlight eyes I hear you cryin  
It robs me of my pride  
Theres nothing I can hide from moonlight eyes  
I got no control  
You just roll me like the sea  
Oh moonlight eyes  
  
Mooonlight eyes youre grown now  
Ill soon be out of touch  
Youll lose that innocence  
That cost so much  
Moonlight eyes youll find your pain  
Youll say that Im all wrong  
Therell always be a place where you belong  
I got no control  
You just roll me like the sea  
Oh moonlight eyes  
Tell your sweet lies only to me only to me  
  
Moonlight eyes you soothe me  
Moonlight eyes youre easy on my soul  
Moonlight eyes you are the reason  
The meaning in the words  
The words to every song Ive ever heard  
Paralyzed in sweet surprise  
Your every wrong is right  
One look into your night  
Oh moonlight eyes  
I got no control  
You just roll me like the sea  
Oh moonlight eyes  
Tell your sweet lies only to me only to me  
Moonlight eyes
