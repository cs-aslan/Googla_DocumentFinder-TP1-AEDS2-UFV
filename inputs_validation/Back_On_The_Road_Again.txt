Please dont hate me mama for what Im about to do  
But the good times weve had together are just about now through  
Please dont misunderstand me I hate to see you cry  
But I think that it might look better if I told you now goodbye  
  
Im back on the road again its time I leave you now  
And maybe Ill see you next time that Im around  
Until then I hope your happy baby and good times come your way  
Im back on the road again Im on my way  
  
Well Ive loved you since the day I met you and Ill love you till the day I
die  
But we both know the life Im livin and we both know the reason why  
That Ive got to leave ya mama and Ive got to leave today  
But you know that Ill see you next time that I come through your town to play  
  
Chorus  
Ooh byebye baby
