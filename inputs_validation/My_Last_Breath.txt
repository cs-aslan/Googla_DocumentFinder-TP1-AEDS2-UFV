Hold on to me love  
You know I cant stay long  
All I wanted to say was  
I love you and Im not afraid  
Can you hear me  
Can you feel me in your arms  
  
Holding my last breath  
Safe inside myself  
Are all my thoughts of you  
Sweet raptured light  
It ends here tonight  
  
Ill miss the winter  
A world of fragile things  
Look for me in the white forest  
Hiding in a hollow tree come find me  
I know you hear me  
I can taste it in your tears  
  
Holding my last breath  
Safe inside myself  
Are all my thoughts of you  
Sweet raptured light  
It ends here tonight  
  
Closing your eyes to disappear  
You pray your dreams will leave you here  
But still you wake and know the truth   
No ones there  
  
Say goodnight dont be afraid  
Calling me calling me as you fade to black  
  
Say goodnight Holding my last breath  
Dont be afraid Safe inside myself  
Holding me Are all my thoughts of you  
Sweet raptured light  
It ends here tonight  
  
Holding my last breath  
Safe inside myself  
Are all my thoughts of you  
Sweet raptured light  
It ends here tonight  
  
Holding my last breath
