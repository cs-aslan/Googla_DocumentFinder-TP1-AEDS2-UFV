You must be walking  
On shaky ground  
Youre always jumping  
At every sound  
  
Youve been a hustler for all your days  
A real motherfucker in every way  
  
When youre a loser youre all alone  
So you made up for everything  
That you thought youd lost  
But you paid a cost  
Hey   
  
You can live your life for so long  
But when youre walking on thin ice you will fall  
You can live your life for so long  
But when youre walking on thin ice you will fall  
  
Youre always running  
With every game  
First youre pushin coke and then youre hoin dames  
You say you cant give nothing better back  
  
Than you got back at home  
Well I tell you thats bullshit brother  
And thats a heavy load  
  
Its an illusion when you think youre the boss  
Oh no no no  
Cause you really aint got a thing  
But the crumbs youre tossed  
  
But dont you feel the frost  
Hey   
  
You can live your life for so long  
But when youre walking on thin ice you will fall  
You can live your life for so long  
But when youre walking on thin ice you will fall  
  
You can live your life for so long  
But when youre walking on thin ice you will fall  
You can live your life for so long  
But when youre walking on thin ice you will fall
