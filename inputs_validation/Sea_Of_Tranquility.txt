I live in the light of the bright silver moon  
Ill take you off sailing from midnight till noon  
Ill show the Sea of Tranquility  
You can have any flavor you happen see  
  
I live in the shade of a forest of green  
In the wildest of woodlands that youve ever seen  
Theres rabbits and quail and tender young snails  
As brown as the seaweed on old rusty nails  
  
Theres fireflies dancing in the cool evening breeze  
Theres love and romancin as nice as you please  
Theres otters and frogs and spotted ground hogs  
And wiley old weasels in rotted out logs  
  
Theres rivers of rainbow and grey mountain trout  
And little dark holes where the varmints hang out  
Theres foxes and hares in traps and in snares  
And lots of bald eagles so youd better take care  
  
So if youve got the time and youd like to pass by  
Come down around midnight and give us a try  
Well show you the Sea of Tranquility  
You can have any flavor you happen to see
