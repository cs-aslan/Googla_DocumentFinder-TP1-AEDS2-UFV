Wanna see my passin flames  
Dont waste a drop baby I aint first  
Where I was born no escape  
There aint even no good bad drugs  
In the city is it true  
If you dont you act like you do  
Feast of fools I cant wait  
Give em a taste of my misfit love  
  
Complicate  
Incarcerate  
Feel my heart wake up  
  
Aint born to lose baby  
Im born to win  
Im so goddamn sick baby its a sin  
Its a sin  
  
Transforming is becoming  
Transforming is becoming on me  
  
Do me first do your worst  
Gimme what I want some of  
Onetrack mind no time to waste  
  
Sidewalks feel me strut so good  
Gutter dont forget this face  
Let em taste my misfit love  
Ill show you all my dirty tricks  
Then show em again Im so proud of em  
Its cruel to be constantly  
Feel my heart play dumb  
  
Aint born to lose baby  
Im born to win  
Im so sick baby its a sin  
Its a sin  
  
Just a dead man walking through the dead of night  
And if youre going anywhere tonight  
Just a dead end walking through the dead of night  
And if you are going can I get a ride  
Just a dead man walking through the dead of night  
Its impossible to wait until the light  
Cause Im already gone  
If you bet on me youve won  
Cause Im already gone  
If you bet on me youve won  
Cause Im already gone  
If you bet on me youve won  
Cause Im already gone  
If you bet on me youve won
