Reading old magazines  
Im on the road no one to save me girl  
I wish you were here tonight  
Theres a knock on my door  
Yes its time to give another show  
I wish you were here tonight  
Chorus  
My love is all imagination  
Just a dream without you to make it real  
And baby I got a dream  
Burning inside  
No one else around  
Just you and I  
Loving in the fire  
It made us so right  
And I wish you were here tonight  
The TV is a friend  
cause I can choose the show with a happy end  
That never ends  
Forever and ever more  
If I make believe your on the show  
Your the lover that says she has to go  
And I end up wishing you were here tonight  
Chorus
