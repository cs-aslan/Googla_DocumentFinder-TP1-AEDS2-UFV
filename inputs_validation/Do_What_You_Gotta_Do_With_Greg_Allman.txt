Do what you gotta do  
With greg allman

Girl I can understand how it might be kinda hard to love a guy like me  
I dont blame you much for wanting to be free  
I just wanted you to know  
I love you better than your own kin did from the very start  
Its my own fault for what happens to my heart  
You see Ive always known youd go  
But you just do what you gotta do  
My wild sweet love  
Though it may mean Ill never kiss your sweet lips again  
Pay that no mind  
Just find that dappled dream of yours  
Come on back and see me when you can  
Well I know they make you sad  
They make you feel so bad  
They say you dont treat me like you should  
Folks got ways to make you feel no good  
I guess they got no way to know  
Ive had my eyes wide open from the start  
And boy you never lied to me  
And the part of you theyll never see  
Is the part youve shown to me  
So you just do what you gotta do  
My wild sweet love  
Though it may mean Ill never kiss those sweet lips again  
Pay that no mind  
Just find that dappled dream of yours  
Come on back and see me  
Come on back and see me  
Come on back see me when you canoooooooooh
