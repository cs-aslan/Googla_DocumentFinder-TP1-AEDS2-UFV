Save us from the ball and chain  
Save us from the ball and chain  
Save us from the ball and chain  
Oh yeah  
The diggers and the tower cranes  
The diggers and the tower cranes  
  
Dont want demolition  
Dont want your compensation  
Its not just bricks and mortar  
We are lambs to slaughter  
  
Save us from the ball and chain  
Save us from the ball and chain  
Save us from the ball and chain  
Oh yeah  
The diggers and the tower cranes  
The diggers and the tower cranes  
  
Must we live in fear  
From those who shed no tears  
Our one and only shelter  
Your games your helter skelter  
  
Motorways and office blocks  
Theyre standing on the spot  
Where stood a home  
Crushing on the memories of people  
Who have since turned to stone  
Ahh  
Theyve turned to stone  
Ahh  
Theyve turned to stone  
  
Save us from the ball and chain  
Save us from the ball and chain  
Save us from the ball and chain  
Oh yeah  
The diggers and the tower cranes  
The diggers and the tower cranes
