Well Im sick and tired of hearing bout the world and its hang ups  
Gonna get myself together take a ride downtown  
Gotta see my RocknRoll doctor  
Gotta see my RocknRoll doctor  
Gotta see my RocknRoll doctor  
Gotta see him see him today  
Hes gonna blow me away  
  
He makes me happy when Im feeling down  
Take away my worry takes away my frown  
Gotta see my RocknRoll doctor  
Gotta see my RocknRoll doctor  
Gotta see my RocknRoll doctor  
Gotta see him see him today  
He gonna blow me away  
  
If you wanna feel groovy give the doctor a call yeah  
Doctor rock will help you anytime at all  
Gotta see my RocknRoll doctor  
Gotta see my RocknRoll doctor  
Gotta see my RocknRoll doctor  
Gotta see him see him today  
He gonna blow me away  
Oh right away
