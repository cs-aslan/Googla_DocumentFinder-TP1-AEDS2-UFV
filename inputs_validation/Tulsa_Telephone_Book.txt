Have you read any good telephone books lately  
If you aint then let me recommend one  
Ive already read that Tulsa telephone book through thirteen times  
If you dont know any last names it aint much fun  
  
Readin that Tulsa telephone book can drive a guy insane  
Especially if that girl youre lookin for has no last name  
I gotta find her and tell her I dont want our love to end  
So Im readin that Tulsa telephone book again  
  
Well I was in Tulsa and didnt have anything goin  
She lived in Tulsa and didnt have anything on  
She said My name is Shirley and I said My name is T  
I woke up the next mornin and she was gone  
  
All of the Tulsa operators know my voice now  
And they gotta know how long Ive been alone  
If you meet a girl named Shirley with some ribbons in her hair  
Would you tell her that shes wanted on the phone  
  
Readin that Tulsa telephone book can drive a guy insane
