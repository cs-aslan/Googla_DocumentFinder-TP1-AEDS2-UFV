If you could press rewind and do it all again  
Would you change your mind would you change a thing  
Would you make it easy would you make it hard  
Would you play the game under another name  
Or ask the dealer for one more card  
  
Bang your drum sing your song  
Dont give up keep the faith it wont be long  
Youve been high youve been low  
Press rewind and let it go  
  
Have you had your say seen all you wanted to see  
Or did your dream give way to reality  
Dont think its all too late for you to even try  
Before you clip your wings see what this life brings  
Youve waited too long its time to fly  
  
Chorus  
  
Do you believe in fate and what is meant to be  
Could you imagine life without a guarantee  
Would you appreciate that time was on your side  
A flash of second sight a chance to do it right  
Is something money just cant buy  
  
Chorus
