My head is saying no  
But my heart keeps giving in  
So hard to let it go  
When its there under my skin  
  
Well if this is the face of a sinner  
And if heaven is only for winners  
Well I dont care cause I wont know anybody there  
  
Thought Id let it slide  
But its me thats slipping in  
Thought that Id go for a ride  
Before this crash Im dying in  
  
Well if Im judged on the life Ive been living  
And if heaven is not so forgiving  
Well I dont care cause I wont know anybody there  
I dont care cause I wont know anybody there  
  
My head is saying

And if heaven is not so forgiving  
Well I dont care cause I wont know anybody there  
I dont care cause I wont know anybody there  
Oh I dont care cause I wont know anybody there  
  
Is there anybody there  
Is there anybody there  
Is there anybody there
