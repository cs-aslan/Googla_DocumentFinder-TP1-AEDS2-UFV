Living up while were going down  
Everything that we dont know now  
Goodbyes and golden nights sing woh oh oh  
Youre the one with pioneer heart  
Im the one in the brand new start  
I feel it coming like oh oh oh  
  
Headlights  
Heartbreak  
Well go  
Our own way  
We got one life today  
  
So when the lights go out and the sun burns down  
Were gonna climb this night singing woh oh oh  
  
Its the last time now  
In this one night town  
To sing woh oh oh oh oh oh  
Were singing woh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Light up our memory  
Never knew what they meant to me  
Hold on like you gotta let me go  
Youre the one with the cavalier smile  
Im the one with the open mile  
Bright lights with no regrets  
Sing woh oh oh  
  
Headlights  
Heartbreak  
Well go  
Our own way  
We got one life today  
  
So when the lights go out and the sun burns down  
Were gonna climb this night singing woh oh oh  
  
Its the last time now  
In this one night town  
To sing oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Were singing oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Weve been running since the day were born  
Day were born  
Weve been running since the day were born  
  
We keep running till the day were gone  
Day were gone  
We keep running till the day were gone  
  
So when the lights go out and the sun burns down  
Were gonna climb this night singing oh oh oh  
  
Its the last time now  
In this one night town  
To sing woh oh oh  
  
So when the lights go out and the sun burns down  
Were gonna climb this night singing oh oh oh  
  
Its the last time now  
In this one night town  
To sing woh oh oh oh oh oh  
Were singing woh oh oh oh oh oh  
Woh oh oh oh oh oh  
Were singing woh oh oh oh oh oh  
Woh oh oh oh oh oh
