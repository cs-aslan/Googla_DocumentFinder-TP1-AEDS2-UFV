Shes standing at the front door  
With a suitcase in her hand  
Im staring down the hallway  
Frozen where I stand  
She says she doesnt love me anymore  
Oh Lord what can I do  
Its gonna take a miracle to make us stay  
Thats why Im asking you  
  
So please dont you have a miracle just laying around  
One small miracle nobody needs  
Send it on down  
Ill never make it through this night  
Thinking shes with someone else  
Please dont you have just one small miracle left  
  
I know I havent been a saint  
And asking you for anything takes nerve  
Cause youve already blessed me with so much more in life than I deserve  
But if you can make a blind man see  
And change the water into wine  
Then surely you can keep her from tearing out this ol heart of mine  
  
Please dont you have just one small miracle left
