Brother youve fallen far behind  
What is it thats on your mind  
Sister oh how do you decide  
What do you see through your clouded eyes  
On every corner I turn to  
Some variation of help me please  
Cant pretend I dont see you there  
How should I feel  
Brother youve fallen to your knees  
What do your children need  
The distance is never out of reach  
Theres only inches between you and me  
On every corner I turn to  
Some variation of help me please  
Cant pretend I dont see you there  
How should I feel  
Hey mister well Im lookin your way you know  
I wouldnt ask if things werent like they were today  
Count up the corners of em add up the dollars for em  
Hey mister well Im lookin your way you know  
Ten thousand of em all over town  
I wouldnt ask if things werent like they were today  
But is it really helpin whatever I do  
Hey mister well Im lookin at you you know  
Will I feel good about it will I feel a fool  
I hate to beg cause I feel like such a fool  
On every corner I turn to  
Some variation of help me please  
Cant pretend I dont see you there  
How should I feel
