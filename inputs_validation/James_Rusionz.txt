Im sick and tired hearing all these people study about  
Whats the deal with this school life and when is it gonna fade out  
The thing youve got to realise what were doing is James Ruse trend  
Weve got the books til insanity were gonna study to the end  
  
Cmon now  
It doesnt matter  
Bout the textbooks that I balance on my head  
All that matters  
Is that you recognize that its just about results  
It doesnt matter  
Bout the books I read or what I learn and why  
All that matters  
Is that were the best and we top you every time  
  
Cmon now  
Do you every wonder why  
The study gets you high  
It takes you on a ride  
You feel it when your  
Brain starts to fry  
Your social life will die  
And the books are all youve got  
This must be Ruse

Now why is the highest uai your passion through and through  
Why cant you chill and do the things you once used to do  
If a day without your math book will cut like a knife  
Drop your pens and burn your notes and go and get a life  
  
It doesnt matter  
That I dont need a calculator  
All that matters  
Is that you recognize its just about results  
It doesnt matter  
Bout the news I watch or news I read and why  
All that matters  
Is that were the best and well top you anytime
