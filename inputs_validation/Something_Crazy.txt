Wait I think its time  
Your fires lit and so is mine  
Go turn out the light  
Dont be afraid tonights the night  
  
And I wont I wont try to change you  
But I will I will if I want to  
Yeah it always brings me down  
When youre not around  
I still need you  
  
Oh You do something for me baby  
I cannot control it baby  
You do something for me  
Oh You do something crazy to me  
I cannot control it baby  
You do something for me  
  
And I feel so down  
When youre not around  
  
Boy were almost there  
Ill lay your clothes over my chair  
Pull the shades down low  
Were both ready so lose control  
  
And I wont I wont try to tame you  
But I will I will if you want to  
Yeah it always brings me down  
When youre not around  
I still need you  
  
Oh You do something for me baby  
I cannot control it baby  
You do something for me  
Oh You do something crazy to me  
I cannot control it baby  
You do something for me  
  
And I feel so down  
When youre not around  
  
And I wont I wont try to tame you  
But I will I will if you want to  
Yeah it always brings me down  
When youre not around  
I still need you  
  
Oh You do something for me baby  
I cannot control it lately  
You do something for me  
Oh You do something for me baby  
I cannot control it lately  
You do something for me  
  
Oh You do something crazy to me  
I cannot control it baby  
La la la la la la la la  
You always bring me down
