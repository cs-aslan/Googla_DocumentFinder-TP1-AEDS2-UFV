Do you suppose she could change your life  
If she could then I wish she would  
Do you suppose she could save my life  
If she could then I think she should  
  
Its another busy day for the cutout witch  
Silver threads for our heads need another stitch  
Golden needles in our eyes then we realize  
Its another busy day for the cut out witch  
  
And could she change this wrong into a right  
Say pretty please and I think she might  
Cause if she wont then youll fall and bust  
And turn to dust and so I think she must  
  
Its another busy day for the cutout witch  
Silver threads for our heads need another stitch  
Golden needles in our eyes then we realize  
Its another busy day for the cutout witch  
  
Do you think she can change your life  
Do you think she can change your life  
Do you think she can change your life
