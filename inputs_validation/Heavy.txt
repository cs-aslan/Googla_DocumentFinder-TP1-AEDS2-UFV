Home all night nothings wrong  
Just my nature got me holding on too tight  
So you say youre on the way  
Got me feelin like I should be holdin on this tight  
  
Im heavy on my knees  
Oh my slip and slide  
Hope they gonna make you feel  
Like someday I will I know  
Cause every girl I know has to go out to dance  
Before my butterfly has its chance to fly fly fly fly fly  
  
And I know that Ill fall in too deep  
And youll wait till I fall asleep  
Before you fade away fade away  
And I know that it wont take too long  
Before you find something wrong  
And fade away fade away  
  
Im heavy on my knees yeah  
Im heavy on my knees yeah  
  
Oh you what you do  
Seems you got me feelin like you want me to  
Fade  
But its all right how well be  
Nothing that you want from me  
Fade  
  
And I know that Ill fall in too deep  
And youll wait till I fall asleep  
Before you fade away fade away  
And I know that it wont take too long  
Before you go and find something wrong  
And fade away fade away  
And I know that Ill fall in too deep  
And youll wait till I fall asleep  
Before you fade away fade away  
  
Im heavy on my knees yeah  
Im heavy on my knees yeah  
Im heavy on Im heavy on  
Im heavy on my knees yeah
