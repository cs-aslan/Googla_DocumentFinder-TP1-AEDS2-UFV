Go ahead  
Go ahead  
And smash it on the floor  
Take whatevers left  
And take it with you out the door  
  
See if I cry  
See if I shed a single sorry tear  
I cant say  
That its been that great  
No  
In fact its been a wasted year  
  
Everybody sees and everyone agrees  
That you and I are wrong  
And its been that way too long  
Take it as it comes  
And be thankful when its done  
Theres so many ways to act  
And theres many shades of black  
Theres so many shades of black  
Theres so many shades of black  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Let it out  
Lett it all out  
Say whats on your mind  
You can kick and scream  
And shout and say things  
That are so unkind  
  
Yeah  
See if I care  
And see if I stand firm  
Or if I fall  
Cause in the back of my mind  
And on the tip of my tongue  
Is the answer to it all  
  
Everybody sees and everyone agrees  
That you and I are wrong  
And its been that way too long  
Take it as it comes  
And be thankful when its done  
Theres so many ways to act  
And theres many shades of black  
Theres many shades of black

And its been that way too long  
Baby take it as it comes  
And be thankful when its done

And you cannot take it back  
Many shades of black
