I thought You knew guess I assumed to much  
I dont know how but now where so far out of touch  
And I never planned to so miss understand  
But what you needed you never asked me to give  
And I swear as I live  
  
I thought you knew my heart was yours  
And that we were so together  
That we would always be  
I dont believe you leavin me is the answer  
  
Im not askin you to let me rush back in and fail again  
Im askin for one chance not to assume  
So I can say and do all the things I thought you knew  
  
So far where still so far  
From where we know we should be  
Im searching for words  
And you havent heard  
  
I thought you knew my heart was yours  
And that we were so together  
That we would always be  
I dont believe you leavin me is the answer  
  
Im not askin you to let me rush back in and fail again  
Im askin for one chance not to assume  
So I can say and do all the things I thought you knew  
  
I thought you knew  
  
Oh god I thought you knew
