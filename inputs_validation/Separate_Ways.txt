Here we stand  
Worlds apart hearts broken in two two two  
Sleepless nights  
Losing ground  
Im reaching for you you you  
  
Feelin that its gone  
Can change your mind  
If we cant go on  
To survive the tide love divides  
  
Someday love will find you  
Break those chains that bind you  
One night will remind you  
How we touched  
And went our separate ways  
If he ever hurts you  
True love wont desert you  
You know I still love you  
Though we touched  
And went our separate ways  
  
Troubled times  
Caught between confusions and pain pain pain  
Distant eyes  
Promises we made were in vain in vain in vain  
  
If you must go I wish you love  
Youll never walk alone  
Take care my love  
Miss you love  
  
Someday love will find you  
Break those chains that bind you  
One night will remind you  
How we touched  
And went our separate ways  
If he ever hurts you  
True love wont desert you  
You know I still love you  
Though we touched  
And went our separate ways  
  
Someday love will find you  
Break those chains that bind you  
One night will remind you  
If we ever hurt you  
True love wont desert you  
You know I still love you  
  
I still love you girl  
I really love you girl  
And if he ever hurts you  
True love wont desert you  
No no
