By Bob Dylan  
  
I was sittin on a stump  
Down in New Orleans  
I was feelin kinda low down  
Dirty and mean  
Along came a fella  
And he didnt even ask  
He says I know of a woman  
That can fix you up fast   
I didnt think twice  
I said like I should  
Lets go find this lady  
That can do me some good   
We walked across the river  
On a sailin spree  
And we came to a door  
Called oneohthree  
  
I was just about ready  
To give it a little knock  
When out comes a fella  
Who couldnt even walk  
Hes linkin and aslinkin  
Couldnt stand on his feet  
And he moaned and he groaned  
And he shuffled down the street  
Well out of the door  
There comes another man  
He wiggled and he wobbled  
He couldnt hardly stand  
He had this frightened  
Look in his eyes  
Like he just fought a bear  
He was ready to die  
  
Well I peeked through the key crack  
Comin down the hall  
Was a longlegged man  
Who couldnt hardly crawl  
He muttered and he uttered  
In broken French  
And he looked like hed been through  
A monkey wrench  
  
Well by this time  
I was ascared to knock  
I was ascared to move  
Is in a state of shock  
I hummed a little tune  
And I shuffled my feet  
And I started walkin backwards  
Down that broad street  
Well I got to the corner  
I tried my best to smile  
I turned around the corner  
And I ran a bloody mile  
Man I wasnt runnin  
Cause I was sick  
I was just arunnin  
To get out of there quick  
  
Well I tripped right along  
And Im awheezin in my chest  
I musta run a mile  
In a minute or less  
I walked on a log  
And I tripped on a stump  
I caught a fast freight  
With a onearm jump  
So if youre travelin down  
Louisiana way  
And you feel kinda lonesome  
And you need a place to stay  
Man youre better off  
In your misery  
Than to tackle that lady  
At oneohthree
