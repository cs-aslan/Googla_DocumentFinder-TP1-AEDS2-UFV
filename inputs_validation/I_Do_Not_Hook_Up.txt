Oh sweetheart put the bottle down  
Youve got too much talent  
I see you through those bloodshot eyes  
Theres a cure youve found it  
Slow motion sparks youve caught that chill  
Now dont deny it but boys will be boys oh yes they will  
They dont wanna define it  
Just give up the game and get into me  
If youre looking for thrills then get cold feet  
  
Oh no I do not hook up up I go slow  
So if you want me I dont come cheap  
Keep your hand in my hand your heart on your sleeve  
Oh no I do not hook up up I fall deep  
Cause the more that you try the harder Ill fight to say goodnight  
  
I cant cook no but I can clean  
Up the mess she left  
Lay your head down and feel the beat  
As I kiss your forehead  
This may not last but this is now  
So love the one youre with  
You wanna chase but youre chasin your tail  
A quick fix wont ever get you well  
  
Oh no I do not hook up up I go slow  
So if you want me I dont come cheap  
Keep your hand in my hand your heart on your sleeve  
Oh no I do not hook up up I fall deep  
Cause the more that you try the harder Ill fight to say  
  
Cause I feel the distance  
Between us could be over  
With the snap of your finger Oh no  
  
Oh no I do not hook up up I go slow  
So if you want me I dont come cheap  
Keep your hand in my hand your heart on your sleeve  
Oh no I do not hook up up I fall deep  
Cause the more that you try the harder Ill fight  
To say cause the more that you try the harder Ill fight to say goodnight  
  
Oh sweetheart put the bottle down  
Cause you dont wanna miss out
