The closer you get the further I fall  
Ill be over the edge now in no time at all  
Im fallin faster and faster and faster with no time to stall  
The closer you get the further I fall  
  
The things that you say to me  
The look on your face  
Brings out the man in me  
Do I see a trace in your eyes of love  
  
The closer you get the further I fall  
Ill be over the edge now in no time at all  
Im fallin faster and faster and faster with no time to stall  
The closer you get the further I fall  
  
Could I be dreamin  
Is this really real  
Cause theres something magic  
The way that I feel in your arms tonight  
  
The closer you get the further I fall  
Ill be over the edge now in no time at all  
Im fallin faster and faster and faster with no time to stall  
The closer you get the further I fall

The closer you get the further I fall  
Ill be over the edge now in no time at all  
Im fallin faster and faster and faster with no time to stall  
The closer you get the further I fall  
  
The closer you get the further I fall  
Ill be over the edge now in no time at all  
Im fallin faster and faster and faster with no time to stall  
The closer you get the further I fall
