Someday some way youll realize that youve been blind  
Yes darling youre going to need me again  
Its just a matter of time  
Go on go on until you reach the end of the line  
But I know youll pass my way again  
Its just a matter of time  
After I gave you everything I had You laughed and called me a clown  
Remember in your search for fortune and fame  
What goes up must come down  
I know I know that one day youll wake up and find  
That my love was a true love  
Its just a matter of time
