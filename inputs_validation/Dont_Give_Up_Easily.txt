If a foolish fool like me  
Can read you easily  
Then something must be wrong  
  
Somethings different when we speak  
It seems the past few weeks  
Our loves not been so strong  
  
Lovers have always had this problem  
Ask anyone youll see  
Weve got to hang on til it passes  
Dont give up easily  
  
If we say whats on our minds  
Wed save a lot of time  
Dont give up easily  
  
I know youre feeling bad  
Sometimes I make you sad  
But when youre feeling sad  
Im feeling just as bad  
  
During the good times its so easy  
You are in love like me  
Sometimes we feel we want to leave it  
Dont give up easily  
  
If we say whats on our minds  
Wed save a lot of time  
Dont give up easily  
Ask anyone youll see  
Theyll say the same as me  
Dont give easily
