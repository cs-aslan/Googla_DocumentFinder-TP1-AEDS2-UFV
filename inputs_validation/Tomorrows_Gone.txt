In a dark and deserted land  
Lives a race of forgotten man  
With a will never seen before  
Do we dare to unlock the door  
  
In his world theres so much to fear  
And all the pain that hes made to bare  
One desire thats his will to live  
  
Not destroy but to give  
  
Hes been lost for so many years  
By his choice he has disappeared  
From a world that is closing in  
As the end of this race begins  
  
All he wants is to be left free  
No other land does he want to see  
In his heart he knows it wont be long  
He wont give up he must stay strong  
  
As he tries to hide from the madness  
Theres no hope in hell for tomorrow wont live on  
  
What is gone may never have been  
Another world now hes fallen in  
All his dreams how theyve disappeared  
Now he lives all he feared  
  
He only wanted to be left free  
This other land that hes forced to see  
In his mind his will always be  
A place that hell never leave  
  
As he tries to hide from the madness  
Theres no hope in hell its gone  
Tomorrow wont live on
