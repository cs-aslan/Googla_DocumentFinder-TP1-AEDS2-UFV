I used to think one day wed tell the story of us  
How we met and the sparks flew instantly  
People would say theyre the lucky ones  
  
I used to know my place was a spot next to you  
Now Im searching the room for an empty seat  
Cause lately I dont even know what page youre on  
  
Oh a simple complication  
Miscommunications lead to fall out  
So many things that I wish you knew  
So many walls up I cant break through  
  
Now Im standing alone  
In a crowded room  
And were not speaking  
And Im dying to know  
Is it killing you  
Like its killing me yeah  
I dont know what to say  
Since a twist of fate  
When it all broke down  
And the story of us  
Looks a lot like a tragedy now  
Next chapter  
  
Howd we end up this way  
See me nervously pulling at my clothes  
And trying to look busy  
And youre doing your best to avoid me  
Im starting to think one day Ill tell the story of us  
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here  
But you held your pride like you should have held me  
Oh Im scared to see the ending  
Why are we pretending this is nothing  
Id tell you I miss you but I dont know how  
Ive never heard silence quite this loud  
  
Now Im standing alone  
In a crowded room  
And were not speaking  
And Im dying to know  
Is it killing you  
Like its killing me yeah  
I dont know what to say  
Since the twist of fate  
When it all broke down  
And the story of us  
Looks a lot like a tragedy now  
  
This is looking like a contest  
Of who can act like they care less  
But I liked it better when you were on my side  
The battles in your hands now  
But I would lay my armor down  
If youd say youd rather love than fight  
So many things that you wish I knew  
But the story of us might be ending soon  
  
Now Im standing alone  
In a crowded room  
And were not speaking  
And Im dying to know  
Is it killing you  
Like its killing me yeah  
I dont know what to say  
Since the twist of fate  
When it all broke down  
And the story of us  
Looks a lot like a tragedy now now now  
  
And were not speaking  
And Im dying to know  
Is it killing you  
Like its killing me yeah  
I dont know what to say  
Since the twist of fate  
Cause were going down  
And the story of us  
Looks a lot like a tragedy now
