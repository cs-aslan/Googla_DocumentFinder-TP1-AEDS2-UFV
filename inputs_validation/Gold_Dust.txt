Sights and sounds  
Pull me back down  
Another year  
  
I was here  
I was here  
  
Whipping past  
The reflecting pool  
Me and you  
Skipping school  
  
And we make it up  
As we go along  
We make it up we  
Go along  
  
You said  
You raced from Langley  
Pulling me underneath  
A cherry blossom  
Canopy  
do I have  
Of course I have  
Beneath my raincoat  
I have your photographs  
And the sun on your  
Face  
Im freezing that frame  
  
And somewhere Alfie cries  
And says enjoy his every smile  
You can see in the dark  
Through the eyes of Laura mars  
How did it go so fast  
Youll say  
As we are looking  
Back  
And then well  
Understand  
We held gold dust  
In our  
Hands  
  
Sights and sounds  
Pull me back down  
Another year  
  
I was here  
I was here  
  
Gaslights  
Glow in the street  
flickering past  
Twilight held us  
In her palm  
As we walked along  
  
And we make it up  
As we go along  
We make it up as we go along  
  
Letting names  
Hang in the  
Air  
What color hair  
auburn crimson  
Autumn knowingly  
Stared  
And the day that  
She came  
Im freezing that  
Frame  
Im freezing that frame  
  
And somewhere Alfie  
Smiles  
And says enjoy her  
Every cry  
You can see in the  
Dark  
Through the eyes  
Of Laura mars  
  
How did it go so  
Fast  
Youll say as we are looking back  
And then well understand  
We held gold dust  
In our  
Hands  
  
In our  
Hands
