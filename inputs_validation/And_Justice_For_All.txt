Halls of justice painted green  
Money talking  
Power wolves beset your door  
Hear them stalking  
Soon youll please their appetite  
They devour  
Hammer of justice crushes you  
Overpower  
  
The ultimate in vanity  
Exploiting their supremacy  
I cant believe the things you say  
I cant believe  
I cant believe the price you pay  
Nothing can save you  
  
Justice is lost  
Justice is raped  
Justice is gone  
Pulling your strings  
Justice is done  
Seeking no truth  
Winning is all  
Find it so grim  
So true  
So real  
  
Apathy their stepping stone  
So unfeeling  
Hidden deep animosity  
So deceiving  
Through your eyes their light burns  
Hoping to find  
Inquisition sinking you  
With prying minds  
  
The ultimate in vanity  
Exploiting their supremacy  
I cant believe the things you say  
I cant believe  
I cant believe the price you pay  
Nothing can save you  
  
Justice is lost  
Justice is raped  
Justice is gone  
Pulling your strings  
Justice is done  
Seeking no truth  
Winning is all  
Find it so grim  
So true  
So real  
  
Lady justice has been raped  
Truth assassin  
Rolls of red tape seal your lips  
Now youre done in  
Their money tips her scales again  
Make your deal  
Just what is truthI cannot tell  
Cannot feel  
  
The ultimate in vanity  
Exploiting their supremacy  
I cant believe the things you say  
I cant believe  
I cant believe the price we pay  
Nothing can save you  
  
Justice is lost  
Justice is raped  
Justice is gone  
Pulling your strings  
Justice is done  
Seeking no truth  
Winning is all  
Find it so grim  
So true  
So real  
Seeking no truth  
Winning is all  
Find it so grim  
So true  
So real
