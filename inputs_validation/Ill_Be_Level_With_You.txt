Little guy little hands little eyes and lots of time  
What you gonna be what you gonna see  
When your eyes are level with mine  
  
Ill be level with you  
I dont know what I would do  
If I had to face the things that youve got coming down the line  
  
Lots of luck lots of health lots of wealth little pain  
Thats what I want for you but theres little I can do  
To put you on the gravy train  
  
Ill be level with you  
Youll always end up coming through  
But youll find yourself lost in space now and again  
  
But you have to have a world you can live in  
Not a world where all the hope is gone  
And as long as we are here together  
We must build a home for the free  
  
Filled with pity  
Not pain  
Thats loving and sane  
Not divided by hate  
And living in spite  
Til its too late  
  
Life is here  
Love will come in the end give it time  
Theres wonders still to do and I know youll find its true  
That yours will be bigger than mine  
  
Ill be level with you  
The one thing I hope you will do is tell me about what  
Youre doing from time to time
