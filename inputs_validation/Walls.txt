Dont you know its my way out  
To be on my own  
When I feel like crying out I do it best alone  
Can you give me love and  
Protection to shield my heart  
All the fear I feel from doubt  
Is tearing me apart  
  
Chorus  
I want to love I want to give  
I want to find another way to live  
Another shout another cry  
And the walls come tumbling down  
  
Dont you know theres now way out  
Your pains your own  
And the more we scream and shout  
The more we feel alone  
I can feel my anger rising  
Am I to blame  
And Im not gonna keep it inside me  
Do you feel the same  
  
Chorus  
  
And Im calling you
