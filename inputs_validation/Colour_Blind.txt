Mercedes  
When the world is seeing yellow  
I only see gray  
When everybody sees the rainbow  
Im stuck in the rain  
You take a little piece of me  
Every time you leave  
I dont think that Ill  
Ever find that silver lining  
Or a reason to smile  
  
You know I used to paint such vibrant dreams  
Now Im colour blind colour blind  
When did my heart  
Get so full of never mind never mind  
Did you know  
That you stole the only thing I needed  
Always black and white in my eyes  
Im colour blind  
  
Aint it funny that you managed  
To just wash away  
Even pictures that youre not in  
Have started to fade  
I try to play my favorite songs  
But I cant sing along  
The words dont feel the same  
Youve taken all the best things from me  
And thrown them away  
  
You know I used to paint such vibrant dreams  
Now Im colour blind colour blind  
When did my heart  
Get so full of never mind never mind  
Did you know  
That you stole the only thing I needed  
Always black and white in my eyes  
Im colour blind  
  
Ill wait  
For roses to be red again  
And I hate  
That you took my blue from the ocean  
Give me back green greens and goldens  
My purples my blues you stole them  
How long will I be broken  
  
You know I used to paint such vibrant dreams  
Now Im colour blind colour blind  
When did my heart  
Get so full of never mind never mind  
Did you know  
That you stole the only thing I needed  
Only black and white in my eyes  
Im colour blind  
Its only black and white in my eyes  
Im colour blind
