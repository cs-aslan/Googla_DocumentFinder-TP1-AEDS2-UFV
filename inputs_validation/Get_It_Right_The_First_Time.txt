I dont believe in first impressions  
But just this once I hope that looks dont deceive  
I aint got time for true confessions  
Ive got to make the move right now  
Got to meet that girl somehow  
Ive gotta get it right the first time  
Thats the main thing oohh oohh  
I cant afford to let it pass  
You get it right the next time thats not the same thing ooh ooh  
Gonna have to make the first time last  
La la la la la Repeat  
  
Im not much good at conversation  
I was never too smooth at comin on real strong  
If all it takes is inspiration  
Then I might have just what it takes  
If I dont make no bad mistakes and I get it right the first time  
Thats the main thing  
Cant afford to let it pass  
You get it right the next time thats not the same thing  
Have to make the first time last  
La la la la la la la la Repeat  
  
I might find the courage yeah  
I might get up the nerve  
But if my timing aint just right  
What purpose would it serve  
I dont know I dont know  
I dont know how to say those first few words  
If I want to put myself in touch  
The first few moments mean so much  
  
So I suppose its now or never  
Before that woman walks right out of my life  
Just let me pull myself together  
Ive got to give it one good try  
Gotta take my chance tonight  
Ive gotta get it right the first time  
Thats the main thing  
I cant afford to let it pass  
You get it right the next time its not the same thing  
Gonna have to make the first time last  
La la la la la la la la Repeat
