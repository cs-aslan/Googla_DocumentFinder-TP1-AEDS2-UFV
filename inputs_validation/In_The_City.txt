Come along  
Into the city  
Where the girls are pretty  
And you cant go wrong  
  
Take your time  
No need to hurry  
Dont have to worry  
Cause it wont take long  
  
Well you can surf in the city  
You can swim in the pools  
Do anything you want  
Because there aint no rules  
Drive your superstock carbur to the long highway  
And you can drag  
  
In the city in the falling right  
The kids are hip and they can dance all night  
In the city all the girls are pretty and they go  
Come along  
Into the city  
Where the girls are pretty  
And you cant go wrong  
  
Well you can surf in the city  
You can swim in the pools  
Do anything you want  
Because there aint no rules  
Drive your superstock carbur to the long highway  
And you can drag  
  
In the city in the falling right  
The kids are hip and they can dance all night  
In the city all the girls are pretty and they go  
  
In the city into the city
