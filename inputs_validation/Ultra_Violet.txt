Sometimes I feel like I dont know  
Sometimes I feel like checkin out  
I want to get it wrong  
Cant always be strong  
And love it wont be long  
  
Oh sugar dont you cry  
Oh child wipe the tears from your eyes  
You know I need you to be strong  
And the day is as dark as the night is long  
Feel like trash you make me feel clean  
Im in the black cant see or be seen  
  
Baby baby baby Light my way  
Alright now  
Baby baby baby Light my way  
  
You bury your treasure  
Where it cant be found  
But your love is like a secret  
Thats been passed around  
There is a silence that comes to a house  
Where no one can sleep  
I guess its the price of love  
I know its not cheap  
  
Oh come on  
Baby baby baby Light my way  
Oh come on  
Baby baby baby Light my way  
  
Oh Ultraviolet  
Ultraviolet  
Ultraviolet  
Ultraviolet  
  
Baby baby baby Light my way  
  
I remember  
When we could sleep on stones  
Now we lie together  
In whispers and moans  
When I was all messed up  
And I had opera in my head  
Your love was a light bulb  
Hanging over my bed  
  
Baby baby baby Light my way  
Oh come on  
Baby baby baby Light my way  
  
Ultraviolet  
Repeat 4 times  
  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby Light my way  
Repeat 3 times  
  
Baby baby baby Light my way
