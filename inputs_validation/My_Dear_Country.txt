Twas Halloween and the ghosts were out  
And everywhere theyd go they shout  
And though I covered my eyes I knew  
Theyd go away  
  
But fears the only thing I saw  
And three days later twas clear to all  
That nothing is as scary as election day  
  
But the day after is darker  
And darker and darker it goes  
Who knows maybe the plans will change  
Who knows maybe hes not deranged  
  
The news men know what they know but they  
Know even less than what they say  
And I dont know who I can trust  
For they come what may  
  
Cause we believed in our candidate  
But even more its the one we hate  
I needed someone I could shake  
On election day  
  
But the day after is darker  
And deeper and deeper we go  
Who knows maybe its all a dream  
Who knows if Ill wake up and scream  
  
I love the things that youve given me  
I cherish you my dear country  
But sometimes I dont understand  
The way we play  
  
I love the things that youve given me  
And most of all that I am free  
To have a song that I can sing  
On election day
