I didnt want to see you  
Not when youre at your best  
And talk about the weather  
I couldnt pass the test  
  
So many things I do  
So many things I say  
Give you the wrong idea  
So many things I do  
So many things I say  
Just make a fool of me  
  
Then you turn away  
Then you turn away  
  
I couldnt help but call you  
I waited almost all the week  
I didnt want to hear you  
Laughing aloud at me  
  
So many things I do  
So many things I say  
Give you the wrong idea  
So many things I do  
So many things I say  
Just make a fool of me  
  
Then you turn away  
Then you turn away  
  
Theres people saying that its obvious  
That Im wasting my time on you  
And people saying that its obvious  
That Ive fallen in love its not true  
  
So many things I do  
So many things I say  
Give you the wrong idea  
So many things I do  
So many things I say  
Just make a fool of me  
  
Then you turn away  
Then you turn away
