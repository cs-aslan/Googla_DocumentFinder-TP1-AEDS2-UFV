I remember when your head caught flame  
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain  
Well you laughed baby its okay  
Its buzz cut season anyway  
Well you laughed baby its okay  
  
Explosions on TV and all the girls with heads inside a dream  
So now we live beside the pool where everything is good  
  
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in  
People should see how were living  
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in  
Shut my eyes to the song that plays  
Sometimes this has a hot sweet taste  
Shut my eyes to the song that plays  
  
The men up on the news they try to tell us all that we will lose  
But its so easy in this blue where everything is good  
  
And Ill never go home again place the call feel it start  
Favorite friend and nothings wrong when nothings true  
I live in a hologram with you  
Were all the things that we do for fun and Ill breathe and it goes  
Play along makebelieve its hyper real  
But I live in a hologram with you  
  
Cola with the burntout taste  
Im the one you tell your fears to  
Therell never be enough of us  
  
Explosions on TV and all the girls with heads inside a dream  
So now we live beside the pool where everything is good  
  
And Ill never go home again place the call feel it start  
Favorite friend and nothings wrong when nothings true  
I live in a hologram with you  
Were all the things that we do for fun and Ill breathe and it goes  
Play along makebelieve its hyper real  
But I live in a hologram with you
