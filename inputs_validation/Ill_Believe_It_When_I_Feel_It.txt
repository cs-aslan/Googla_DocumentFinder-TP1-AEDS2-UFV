Now when you left everybody told me  
That Id find another to take the place of you  
And they all said someone else would hold me  
And Id have a lover to love like I loved you  
  
Chorus  
Ill believe it when I feel it  
When somebody makes me feel the way you did  
They say hes out there  
They tell me someday Ill forget  
Ill believe it when I feel it  
But I havent felt it yet  
  
Ive heard in time  
Time is going to heal me  
Its been forever  
And I still need you now  
Maybe I will someday find that feeling  
We had together  
Oh but Ive got my doubts  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill believe it when I felt  
But I havent felt it yet
