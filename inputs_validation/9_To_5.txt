Tumble out of bed  
And stumble to the kitchen  
Pour myself a cup of ambition  
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life  
  
Jump in the shower  
And the blood starts pumpin  
Out on the streets the traffic starts jumpin  
For folks like me on the job from 9 to 5  
  
Workin 9 to 5  
What a way to make a livin  
Barely gettin by  
Its all takin and no givin  
  
They just use your mind  
And they never give you credit  
Its enough to drive you  
Crazy if you let it  
  
9 to 5  
For service and devotion  
You would think that I  
Would deserve a fat promotion  
  
Want to move ahead  
But the boss wont seem to let me  
I swear sometimes that man is  
Out to get me hmmm  
  
They let you dream  
Just a watch em shatter  
Youre just a step on the boss mans ladder  
But you got dreams hell never take away  
  
In the same boat with a lot of your friends  
Waitin for the day your shipll come in  
And the tides gonna turn  
And its all gonna roll you away  
  
Workin 9 to 5  
What a way to make livin  
Barely gettin by  
Its all takin and no givin  
  
They just use your mind  
And you never get the credit  
Its enough to drive you  
Crazy if you let it  
  
9 to 5  
Yeah they got you were they want you  
Theres a better life  
And you think about it dont you  
  
Its a rich mans game  
No matter what they call it  
And you spend your life  
Putting money in his wallet  
  
9 to 5  
Oh what a way to make a livin  
Barely gettin by  
Its all takin and no givin  
  
They just use your mind  
And they never give you credit  
Its enough to drive you  
Crazy if you let it  
  
9 to 5  
Yeah they got you where they want you  
Theres a better life  
And you dream about it dont you  
  
Its a rich mans game  
No matter what they call it  
And you spend your life  
Putting money in his wallet  
  
9 to 5
