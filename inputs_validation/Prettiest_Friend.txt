This is what I look like today  
And Im trying not to pull out my hair  
Im trying hard to grow it but Im far too shy to grow it back there  
That is probably why I like wearing hats  
Theres no denying Im deferring the facts  
Avoiding confrontation  
Lacks tact in a situation  
Behind every line is a lesson yet to learn  
  
But if you asked me  
The feeling that Im feeling is overwhelming  
And oh it goes to show  
Theres so much to know  
  
I wrote this for my prettiest friend  
But while trying not to prove that I care  
I was trying not to make all my moves in one motion and scare her away  
She cant see shes making me crazy now  
I dont believe she knows shes amazing how  
She has me holding my breath  
So Id never guess that Im a nonesuch unsuitable suitor for her  
  
And if you ask me  
The feeling that Im feeling is complimentary  
And oh it goes to show  
The moral of the story is boy loves girl  
And so on but the way that it unfolds is yet to be told  
  
I know that I should be brave  
Even pretty can be seen by the blind  
I know that I cannot wait  
Until the day we finally learn how to find each other  
Redefining open minds  
  
And if you ask me  
The feeling that Im feeling is overjoyed  
And its golden it goes to show then  
The ending of this song should be left alone  
And so on cause the way it unfolds is yet to be told
