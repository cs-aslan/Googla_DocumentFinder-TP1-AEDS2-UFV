What what what what YEEEAAA  
Pitbull in this This Lil Jon Chekin in where my T golds at  
  
Chorus  
Twentyfos on my truck thats nasty  
They spin when you stop thats nasty  
Twentyfos on my truck thats nasty  
They spin when you stop thats nasty  
  
WHAT WHAT AAAA LETS GO  
  
Pitbulls chillin the bottom wit no deals  
If them boys talk a lot then its no reals  
Shimmya whyall shimmy yay shimmy yayo  
Catch me wit picolo riding on them thangs  
Word of mouf theres a drought on the streets  
So who ever sitting on them ks is looking at some cheezle  
But dont let them boys find out where the safe house is at  
And if its where you lay your head what kinda safe house is that  
You dont deserve to hold weight you deserve to get robbed  
Your the first to turn state  
Those who got snitched on relate to  
No matter what you do heffer damn gon hate ya  
Thats just mother nature  
Aint she a mother  
I know these bitches named bullets and they loved to date ya  
Or better said they love to rape ya  
From the bottom to Atown the game is ours now  
  
Chorus  
  
WHAT WHAT AAAA LETS GO  
  
I from the land where you name it everythings crooked  
Watch what you do cause everythings looking  
Man these streets got ears and eyes  
And they want to know its all who what when and whyz  
So when you see me on them twenty fours spinning  
You know the cut me a serious check  
But for now Im still grindin fiending for a legging  
Thats some serious shit ya  
Im involved in some serious shit ya  
Im like TIIm serious bitch  
Im giving Miami a facelift  
Whyall just face it  
Dont believe its wrong just taste it  
  
Chorus  
  
WHAT WHAT AAAA LETS GO  
  
When I came in Mami you know you nasty  
Them bitch ass niggaz want to blast me  
Still punkn gettin crunked off that crunk juice  
Hatin cause your girl on me and she hate you  
We gotta do nigga what cutlass dropped down on dz  
If you pump it relocate your soul from the streets  
Remember me lil g Atown to the O OOOO

What you hate dawg my dawg got rhymes on singing  
Get your hatin dawg my twentyfos keep spinning
