Oh my God  
Tell me this wont last forever  
Tell me that Im not alone  
Tell me this will come together now  
  
Packed my things up just the other day  
Said my goodbyes to all these things Ive sayed  
Out in the driveway we laugh under the moon  
Among my friends for now but Ill be leavin soon  
  
Many days from now Im sure  
Ill be back among your graces  
And with you I wont pretend  
No not at all Oh  
  
Crack the morning up and running quick  
No sleep again last night  
Thats the way it is  
Out in the open under broken skies  
I feel every foot step I see everybodys eyes  
  
Oh and this is summer in another world  
Far from the driveway and my baby girl  
Soon come the winter and with it quiet nights  
And darker days and darker fights  
  
Many days from now Im sure  
Ill be back among your faces  
And with you I wont pretend  
No not at all  
  
Oh the theater is burnin over at midnight  
But never like this  
Hot under the fire the stars are a fallin  
But never like this  
No I hope you never see this  
  
Wait wait for my love  
Dont forget me never let me go  
If you wait wait for my love  
Ill remember never let you go  
  
Until Im fine fine fine  
Until Im fine fine fine  
  
To be back in my room  
I have the same dream every night  
Just me among my things  
No one else is there theres no one left to fight just me  
  
Among my things  
Many nights from now I know  
Ill be back among your graces  
Until then Ill just pretend  
That Im not cold  
  
Oh my god tell me this wont last forever  
And tell me that Im not alone  
Tell me this will come together  
Oh my God you know  
  
Wait wait for my love  
Dont forget me never let me down  
And just wait wait for my love  
Ill remember every one of you  
  
And just wait wait for my love  
Wait wait for my love  
Wait for my love  
  
Until Im fine fine fine  
Until Im fine fine fine  
Ill be fine fine fine  
Ill be fine fine fine
