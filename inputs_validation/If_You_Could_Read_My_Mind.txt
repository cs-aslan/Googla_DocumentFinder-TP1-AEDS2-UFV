If you could read my mind love what a tale my thoughts could tell  
Just like and oold time moovie bout a ghost from a wishin well  
In a castle dark or a fortress strong with chains upon my feet  
You know that ghost is me  
And I wont ever be set free as long as Im a ghost that you cant see  
  
If I could read your mind love what a tale your thoughts could tell  
Just like a paper back novel the kind the drug store sells  
When you reach the part where the heartaches come  
The hero would be me but heroes often fail  
And you wont read that book again because the endings just too hard to take  
  
Id walk away like a movie star who gets burned in a three way script  
Enter number two  
A movie queen to play the scene f bringing all the good things out in me  
But for now love lets be real  
I never thought I could feel this way and Ive got to say that I just dont
get it  
I dont know where we went wrong but the feelings gone and I just cant get it
back  
  
If you could read my mind love what a tale my thoughts could tell  
Just like and oold time moovie bout a ghost from a wishing well  
In a castle dark or a fortress strong with chains upon my feet  
Girl but stories always end  
If you could read between the lines youd know that Im just tryin to
understand  
The feelings that you lack  
I never thought I could feel this way and Ive got to say that I just dont
get it  
I dont know where we went wrong but the feelings gone and I just cant get it
back
