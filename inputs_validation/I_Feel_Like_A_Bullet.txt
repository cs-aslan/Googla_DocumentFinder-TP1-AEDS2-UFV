Lyrics by bernie taupin  
Available on the album rock of the westies  
  
Like a corn in a field I cut you down  
I threw the last punch too hard  
After years of going steady well I thought that it was time  
To throw in my hand for a new set of cards  
  
And I cant take you dancing out on the weekend  
I figured wed painted too much of this town  
And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon  
And I knew then I had lost what should have been found  
I knew then I had lost what should have been found  
  
And I feel like a bullet in the gun of robert ford  
Im low as a paid assassin is  
You know Im cold as a hired sword  
Im so ashamed cant we patch it up  
You know I cant think straight no more  
You make me feel like a bullet honey in the gun of robert ford  
  
Like a child when his toys been stepped on  
Thats how it all seemed to me  
I burst the bubble that both of us lived in  
And Im damned if ill ever get rid of this guilt that I feel  
  
And if looks could kill then Id be a dead man  
Your friends and mine dont call no more  
Hell I thought it was best but now I feel branded  
Breaking ups sometimes like breaking the law  
Breaking ups sometimes like breaking the law
