Nobodys blamin you  
Dont get me wrong  
I know so many things you done for me  
But you got your life that you gotta live  
And Ill get along  
I just wonder who you wanted me to be  
And I just cant believe that you still dont believe in me  
Or hold a clue to who I am  
I just hope to God that I still got the heart to take it  
And prove it to you one more time again  
So many lies weve told so many times  
Maybe its too late to make it love again  
If we got a choice then we gotta chance  
We gotta try  
And do the story true right to the end  
And I cant believe that you still dont believe in me  
And you still dont understand me  
I just hope to God that I still got the heart to take it  
And prove it to you one more time again
