Seems like Ive been here before  
Fuzzy then and still so obscure goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye  
And I dont want to see anybody cry  
Meet me some mornin in the sweet by and by by and by by and by  
  
Song commin on  
So pleasin to see come and gone goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye  
You dont have to tell me why  
Meet me some mornin in the sweet by and by by and by by and by  
  
It aint cause Im the only one left darlin  
Bout the time the sun rises west  
Feelin groovy lookin fine  
  
Think Ill come back here again  
Every now and then from time to time  
My how lovely you are my dear  
The ball game has gone much too far my dear  
Sing to me do your thing to me  
Ill meet you some mornin meet you some mornin  
In the sweet by and by by and by by and by
