Blue skies in my rearview mirror  
Well Ive got you on my mind  
Road sign says Im getting nearer  
And now its just a matter of time  
Well now I get to wonder  
Do you take me for a fool  
Do I have to take a number  
And wait in line  
Just to get to you  
You got the time I got the money   
This aint workin at all  
Its no joke and it aint funny   
I think Im losing control  
Like tumbleweed thats blowin free  
You change direction with the wind  
We both know that this may never be  
Nothing more than someplace to begin
