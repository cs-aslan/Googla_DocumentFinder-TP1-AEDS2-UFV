Well youve grown up all wrong  
Well youve grown up all wrong  
You come on too strong  
Well youve grown up all wrong  
Well you were easy to fool when you were in school but  
Youve grown up all wrong  
  
Well youve grown up on me  
Well youve grown up on me  
Dont believe what I see  
Well youve grown up on me  
Well you look so sweet when youre in your jeans but  
Youve grown up on me  
  
Well youve grown up too fast  
Well youve grown up too fast  
Dont forget about the past  
Girl youve grown up too fast  
Well you wont be a fool but Im through with you  
Well youve grown up too fast  
Well youve grown up too fast
