Flying when all I want to do is die  
Feels like your flyin  
Oh God I wish that I could fly  
You want to lift me up  
But you dont know and you dont see  
Im stuck in my ways stuck in my ways oh  
Breathing when all I want to do is drown  
You keep on breathing and I keep on sinking down oh oh  
You want to lift me up  
But you dont know and you dont see  
Im stuck in my ways stuck in my ways  
Im stuck in my ways oh  
You want to lift me up  
But you dont know and you dont see  
Im stuck in my ways stuck in my ways  
Im stuck in my ways oh
