Next to you next to me  
Next to you next to me  
Next to you next to me  
Baby next to you next to me  
  
Ridin down the road in my pickup truck  
Ya better be ready cause Im pickin you up  
With a full moon shinin and a little bit a luck  
Well run outta gas and maybe get stuck  
  
We can get lost baby I dont care  
I aint worried as long as youre there  
Aint no place that Id rather be  
Next to you sittin next to me  
  
Barbecue chicken in aluminum foil  
Just enough money for my gas and oil  
Who needs your shrimp and your caviar  
Id sooner have you just the way you are  
  
Rich people got their money to hold  
Mansion on the hill with diamonds and gold  
Cant compare as far as I can see  
Next to you sittin next to me  
Aint no place that Id rather be  
Next to you sittin next to me  
  
Radio playin our favorite song  
Well Ill change the station if the news comes on  
The signal aint comin in too strong  
Make our own music honey all night long  
  
If the Good Lords willin when were old and gray  
The kids are grown up and moved away  
Well be rockin there side by side  
With a barbeque chicken and the TV guide  
  
Well there aint no place that Id rather be  
Next to you sittin next to me  
Aint no place that Id rather be  
Next to you sittin next to me  
Aint no place that Id rather be  
Next to you sittin next to me  
  
Next to you next to me  
Next to you next to me  
Next to you next to me  
As long as youre next to me baby  
  
Next to you oh sittin next to me  
Id sooner have you just the way you are  
Aw there aint no place that Id rather be  
Next to you sittin next to me  
  
And if the Good Lords willin when were old and gray  
The kids are grown up and moved away  
Well be rockin there side by side  
With a barbecue chicken and the TV guide  
Oh yeah  
There aint no place that Id rather be  
Next to you sittin next to me
