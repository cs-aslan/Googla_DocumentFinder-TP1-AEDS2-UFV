Sitting at the kitchen table Monday afternoon  
House is so quiet  
I spent the morning looking for a job  
But the job markets pretty tight  
  
And Im wondering  
Just what Im gonna do  
Someone to hold and the rent  
I owe are long overdue  
  
Seems like everything comes down  
To money and love in my life  
It seems like everything comes down  
To money and love in my life  
  
Im used to having a woman around  
Cooking for me and when I lay down to love  
I got used to having a woman around  
Looking to me to rise above  
  
Ive got a lonely heart two open arms  
And a pillow I never use  
I know it aint much to offer  
But its the best I can do  
  
Seems like everything comes down  
To money and love in my life  
  
Ive loved a lot of good women  
And I could sure love one now  
Ive had more than enough money  
In my bank account  
  
But where they went and how they got spent  
Isnt really clear  
They just left me here  
And it all disappeared  
  
Sitting in another office Tuesday morning  
Application filled  
I doubt theyll ever call me  
But I cant keep from hoping that they will  
  
I know I need to keep my chin up  
But Im telling you the truth  
If theres no one else to live for  
Is there anything left to lose  
  
It seems like everything comes down  
To money and love in my life  
Seems like everything comes down  
To money and love in my life in my life
