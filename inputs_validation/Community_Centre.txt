Well the skys turning purple  
Above the community centre  
And Im sitting in a circle  
Telling my secrets to strangers  
And they say Ive got a problem  
But I dont know that Ive got one  
Cause you never know that youve got one  
Til someone comes along and spots one  
  
They say its the hardest step  
But its the first one of many  
And my feet are stuck to the ground  
And I cant seem to take any  
I could tell them I just came  
For the free cup of tea and the biscut  
And make my way towards the door  
But I dont think I can risk it  
  
Cause I never wanted to stay  
But the morning came so soon  
And we all know the words  
But we just sing them out of tune  
  
Cause I had my first drink when I was fourteen  
And I knew that I was in trouble  
Cause I woke up the next morning  
With my face down in the rubble  
And everyone was drinking singles  
I pour myself a double  
I just needed a little bit more  
  
And now Im sitting here with my name badge  
And Im listening to the same sad stories  
About their old dads  
Whore making all the same  
Bad turnings at their crossroads  
And drowning all their sorrows  
Without any lifeguard around  
  
Oh no I never wanted to stay  
But the morning came so soon  
And oh we all know the words  
But we just sing them out of tune  
And oh oh no  
  
And the skys turning dark  
So we step out into the carpark  
And I see you all same place same time next week  
But before we go our separate ways  
Theres just one thing Id like to say is  
Anybody up for a drink
