I hear that some playboy has kidnapped your heart  
With his plane and his plans for games after dark  
Just a pain in his pocket and the price of a room  
Where the second hand sheets smell of stale perfume  
  
If theres sharks in the water dont swim where its deep  
For the taste of success can be bitter and sweet  
It could be all right that I act like a child  
But youll be the loser when the jokers run wild  
  
Youre just playing the game but the stakes are too high  
What will you do when the chips start to fly  
When the decks stacked against you and the living gets hard  
Oh its four walls of madness in this house of cards  
  
Common you call me but I know theres time  
In a handful of diamonds a hearts hard to find  
And your house of cards starts weighing you down  
Your nights become restless when the clubs start to pound
