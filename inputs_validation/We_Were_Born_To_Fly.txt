Hello again  
Youve been alone awhile  
And I can use a friend  
Your shades are down  
And Ive been waiting here for you to come around  
And its not about forgiveness  
Cause its all about the love anyhow  
  
We were born to fly  
To reach beyond the sky  
To carry on forever after  
You and I  
You keep my faith alive  
With you Im not afraid  
To rise and fall and face disaster  
You and I  
We were born to fly  
  
Take another breath  
Just close your eyes my love let nature do the rest  
Open up your wings  
And with the wind well rise above to higher things  
Well forget about tomorrow  
And well live another day today  
  
We were born to fly  
To reach beyond the sky  
To carry on forever after  
You and I  
You keep my faith alive  
With you Im not afraid  
To rise and fall and face disaster  
You and I  
We were born to fly  
We were born to fly  
  
We were born to fly  
To reach beyond the sky  
To carry on forever after  
You and I  
You keep my faith alive  
With you Im not afraid  
To rise and fall and face disaster  
You and I  
We were born to fly  
We were born to fly  
We were born to fly  
To reach beyond the sky  
To carry on forever after  
You and I  
You keep my faith alive  
With you Im not afraid  
To rise and fall and face disaster  
You and I  
We were born to fly
