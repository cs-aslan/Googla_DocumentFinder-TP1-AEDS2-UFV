I know that youre leavin  
As soon as the sun  
Comes through the window  
Theres no talking this over  
The damage is done  
Theres just too much hurt  
Too much to forgive  
Oh but we both know  
We werent always like this  
  
Chorus  
Help me remember  
The way that we used to be  
When nothin else mattered  
cause you were lovin me  
Just for the night one last time  
One more good memory  
When I look back  
Thats what I wanna see  
  
Oh help me remember  
  
Those days that were so good  
Those nights that we held  
Held on forever  
When we werent pretenders  
We were as real as we felt  
Oh I dont want to fight anymore  
Dont want the last thing I hear tonight  
To be a slammin door  
Baby let it be like before  
  
Chorus  
  
This could be the last time  
I look in your eyes  
  
Help me remember  
The way that it used to be  
When nothin else mattered  
Cause you were lovin me  
Oh help me remember  
Oh help me help me  
Oh oh oh oh
