Well Im a runnin down the highway  
Got the road beneath my wheels  
Said Im runnin down the highway  
Got the road beneath my wheels  
Aint nobody in this whole wide world  
Who knows the way I feel  
Said my woman up and left me  
Left me for some other guy  
Said my woman up and left me  
Left me for some other guy  
You know I never understand it  
Though I try and I try and I try  
Well Im a runnin down the highway  
Got the road beneath my wheels  
Said Im runnin down the highway  
Got the road beneath my wheels  
Aint nobody in this whole wide world  
Who knows the way I feel
