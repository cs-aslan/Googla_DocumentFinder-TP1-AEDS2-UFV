I had a dream  
You walked away  
You couldnt hear what I wanted to say  
I had a dream  
I was alone  
Nowhere was mine  
No one was home  
  
Sunshine dont you wake me  
Darkness come and take me  
You light my life darling  
You light the night  
Darling dont go  
  
I closed my eyes  
You came to me  
I was in love  
I held a dream  
Fragile and brief  
A wonderful thing  
Like a new leaf  
But only a dream  
  
Sunshine dont you wake me  
Nighttime dont forsake me  
You light my life darling  
You light the night  
Darling dont go  
  
I had a dream  
Whispers and sighs  
Walk in the stream  
Look in my eyes  
Sunshine dont you wake me  
Darkness come and take me  
You light my life darling  
You light the night  
Darling dont go home
