Youll have to be a little more standoffish  
When fellers offer you a buggy ride  
  
Ill give an imitation of a crawfish  
And dig myself a hole where I can hide  
  
I heard how you was kicken up some capers  
When I was off in Kansas City Mo  
I heard some things you couldnt print in papers  
From fellers who been talkin like they know  
  
Foot  
I only did the kind of things I orta sorta  
To you I was as faithful as can be for me  
Them stories bout the way I lost my bloomersrumors  
A lot of tempest in a pot o tea  
  
The whole dont sound very good to me  
  
Well you see  
  
I go and sow my last wild oat  
I cut out all shenanigans  
I save my money dont gamble or drink  
In the back room down at Flannigans  
I give up lotsa other things  
A gentleman never mentions  
But before I give up any more  
I wanna know your intentions  
  
With me its all er nuthin  
Is it all or nuthin with you  
It caint be in between  
It cant be now and then  
No half and half romance will do  
  
Im a one woman man home lovin type  
All complete with slippers and pipe  
Take me like I am er leave me be  
If you cant give me all give me nuthin  
And nuthins what youll git from me  
  
Not even somethin  
  
Nuthins what youll git from me  
  
It caint be in between  
  
Nnnmmm  
  
It caint be now and then  
  
No half and half romance will do  
  
Would you build me a house  
All painted white  
Cute and clean and purty and bright  
  
Big enough fer two but not fer three  
  
Suposin that we should have a third one  
  
Hed better look a lot like me  
  
No spittin image  
  
Hed better look a lot like me  
  
With you its all er nuthin  
All fer you and nothin fer me  
But if a wife is wise shes gotta realize  
That men like you are wild and free  
  
So I aint gonna fuss aint gonna frown  
Have your fun go out on the town  
Stay up late and dont come home til three  
And go right off to sleep if youre sleepy  
Theres no use waitin up fer me  
  
Oh Ado Annie  
  
No use waitin up fer me  
  
Come back and kiss me
