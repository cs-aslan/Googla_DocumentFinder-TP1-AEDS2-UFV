You were a child reaching out brave and true  
For big thins in the next room  
And I couldnt step into such open sky  
Where on the crest of uncertainty you loom  
Im learning to hunt for you  
Say that youll never run too far away  
Even with all the answers out there  
Where its brighter but no one will care  
Half as much as I care about you  
Im learning to hunt for you  
back inside ordinary
