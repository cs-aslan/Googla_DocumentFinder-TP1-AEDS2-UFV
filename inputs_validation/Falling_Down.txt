Where does the time go  
Spinning my wheels  
Standing still  
Its like Im running on ice  
I only gain a little distance when I fall  
How did I become a molecule  
In the concrete of this city  
Indifference to my endless motion  
In a space to small to see  
Nonetheless expected to be  
I only get a little attention when I fall  
  
Chorus  
And Im falling  
Falling down  
Falling  
Falling down  
  
Cursed with reason  
In a world so defiant  
Without conclusion  
This is the story  
The story we live out  
And it is the moral too  
Look at me Im falling for you  
  
Shaking crying  
Hating lying to myself  
Im tired of telling myself its OK  
To be this tired  
This sick and tired of the turns the world takes  
And the people that it makes us be  
And lately it appears to me that Im  
  
Chorus  
  
Im falling down
