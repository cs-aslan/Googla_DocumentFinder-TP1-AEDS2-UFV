I hear tell theres big fun tonight  
On the corner of Main and DogMeatBite  
Friday midnights would not be right  
Without Redds hot party and a nasty fight  
  
But Ill be in your corner  
Ill be in your corner if they do  
Ill be in your corner  
Ill be in your corner if they do  
  
You cant renege cause its goin be live  
Fine women lots of liquor and stuff for your mind  
Now where were goin they dont like your kind  
But theyll cool when you tell them youre a friend of mine  
  
Cause Ill be in your corner  
Ill be in your corner if they do  
Ill be in your corner  
Ill be in your corner if they do  
  
You cant tell your pa and mama  
Where were goin til after weve been there  
Cause that might make their poor heads worry  
And worrying can cause grey hair  
And one thing just might lead to another  
And if theres any trouble theyll blame it on me  
  
I think we just might have two to go  
The prettys lookin over here from the middle of the floor  
Well make a be line to Hotel La Sin  
Where youll do the talkin to get us in  
  
And Ill be in your corner  
Ill be in your corner if they do  
  
We should a been long gone cause this place is hot  
Cause in the corner there are two brothers who are undercover cops  
If they stop us for questioning mum is the word  
Cause a question not answered is a answer not heard  
  
And Ill be in your corner  
Ill be in your corner if they do  
Ill be in your corner  
Ill be in your corner if they do  
  
You cant tell your pa and mama  
Where were goin til after weve been there  
Cause that might make their poor heads worry  
And worrying can cause grey hair  
And one thing just might lead to another  
And if theres any trouble theyll blame it on me
