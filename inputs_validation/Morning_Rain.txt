Clear as the morning rain  
Seeing it very plain  
Weve got to start again  
  
Whats that you do  
Whats that you say  
Theres no use complaining  
Its the only way  
Theres no use feeling dissatisfied  
Cause how can you know until youve tried  
  
Clear as the morning rain  
Seeing it very plain  
Weve got to start again  
  
Everthings going around in my head  
The futures new and the past is dead  
Pull out the stops turn on the light  
Cause away from the darkness everything seems bright  
  
Clear as the morning rain  
Seeing it very plain  
Weve got to start again  
  
Do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do
