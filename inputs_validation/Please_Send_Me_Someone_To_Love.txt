Heaven please send to all mankind  
Understanding and peace of mind  
But if its not asking too much  
Please send me someone to love  
  
Show all the world how to get along  
Peace will enter when hate is gone  
But if its not asking too much  
Please send me someone to love  
  
I lay awake night and ponder world troubles  
My answer is always the same  
That unless men put an end to all of this  
Hate will put the world in a flame oh what a shame  
Just because Im in misery  
Im not begging for no sympathy  
But if its not asking too much  
Just send me someone to love  
  
Heaven please send to all mankind  
Understanding and peace of mind  
But if its not asking too much  
Please send me someone to love  
  
Learn to love me or leave me either one you wanna do  
Learn to love me or leave me either one you wanna do  
Because strange things are happenin babe an somethin might happen to you  
  
If you know you dont love me why dont you let me be  
If you know you dont love me why dont you let me be  
Because its better to be without you then to live on in misery  
  
Hey  
  
Midnight find me cryin daylight find me cryin too  
Midnight find me cryin daylight find me cryin too  
You better change your ways pretty baby or somethin might happen to you
