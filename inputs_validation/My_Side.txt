Hook 1  
Why you never come to where I stay  
Always hiding out in your New York condo  
Why you never come to where I stay  
If anybody knows girl you know I know  
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship  
Why are we rushing and forcing it This isnt making sense  
Why are we focused on things that dont even mean nothing girl  
Why can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it girl  
Let me at least tell you my side of things man  
Aw man aw man  
Aw man  
  
Verse  
Me and you are playing house start think that Im losing touch  
Got a tight grip on ya now maybe I should loosen up  
When I leave you and I go home I start forgetting what it is  
Start to think I got to get it how I live  
We too busy for a wedding or a kid  
If Im working then I know you working  
Keep in touch with other women cause you make me nervous  
I empower girls that dont deserve it  
I dont mean to do that shit on purpose  
Its just that when I go home I start forgetting what it is  
The dream is over I get lost up in the 6  
  
Hook 2  
You dont ever come to where I stay  
You just rather stay up in your New York condo  
You dont ever come to where I stay  
If anybody knows girl you know I know  
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship  
You know how sticky these situation get  
You go up higher than me some days  
You know what I think we could be some day  
Let me at least show you my side of things man  
Aw man aw man  
Aw man
