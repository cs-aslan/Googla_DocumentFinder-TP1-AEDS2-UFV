The sun comes up and brings the dawn to a new day  
The kids run out to play the games like kids all play  
To a child the world is milk and honey  
A dime is a lot of candy money  
Oh aint it funny now aint it funny  
Running barefoot through the fields in the rain  
Chasin pretty butterflies in the lane  
The worlds a mess and they wonder why  
Oh what a pretty blue blue sky  
Gee aint it funny now aint it funny  
The kids all say grown ups are strange and arent they  
They teach their kids not to do as I do but as I say  
They cry for peace and then make war  
And wonder what theyre fighting for  
Oh aint it funny now aint it funny  
Oh gee aint it funny now aint it funny
