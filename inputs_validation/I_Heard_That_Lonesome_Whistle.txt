I was riding Number Nine  
Heading south from Caroline  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
Got in trouble had to roam  
Left my gal an left my home  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
Just a kid acting smart  
I went and broke my darlings heart  
I guess I was too young to know  
They took me off the Georgia Main  
Locked me to a ball and chain  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
All alone I bear the shame  
Im a number not a name  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
All I do is set an cry  
When the evening train goes by  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
Ill be locked here in this cell  
Till my bodys just a shell  
An my hair turns whiter than snow  
Ill never see that gal of mine  
Lord Im in Georgia doing time  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
