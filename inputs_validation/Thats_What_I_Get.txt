Just when everything was making sense  
You took away all my self confidence  
Now all that Ive been hearing must be true  
I guess Im not the only boy for you  
  
Chorus  
But thats what I get  
Thats what I get  
Thats what I get  
Thats what I get  
  
How could you turn us into this  
After you just taught me how to kiss you  
I told you Id never say goodbye  
Im slipping on the tears you made me cry  
  
Chorus  
  
For trusting you  
Thats what I get  
Why does it come as a surprise  
To think that I was so naive  
Maybe didnt mean too much  
But it meant everything to me  
  
Chorus
