Sailin around sailin around sailin around  
Ive been out sailin around again  
Ive been sailin around  
But I cant get back to you  
Hangin around hangin around hangin around  
Ive been out hangin around again  
Ive been hangin around  
But I cant get back to you  
  
Chorus  
So tell where you been so long sailin around  
What have I done so wrong sailin around  
Well Im so glad I finally found you  
I cant wait to put my arms around you  
Sailin around but I cant get back to you  
  
Shoppin around shoppin around shoppin around  
Ive been shoppin around again  
Ive been shoppin around  
But I cant get back to you  
  
Chorus  
  
Sailin around sailin around sailin around  
Ive been sailin around again  
Ive been sailin around but I cant get back to you  
Ive been sailin around but I cant get back to you  
Ive been sailin around but I cant get back to you
