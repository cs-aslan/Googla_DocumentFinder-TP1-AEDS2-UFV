Its only sane to be insane  
Psychotic builds a castle  
And neurotic lives in it  
I dont know what to do with my sanity  
When the worlds at the verge of calamity  
  
O sanity o sanity  
What am I to do with you  
Drink up shoot up anything you please  
But youre always standing behind me like a devil in hell  
  
O sanity o sanity  
Why dont you let me go  
Let go let go cut it out
