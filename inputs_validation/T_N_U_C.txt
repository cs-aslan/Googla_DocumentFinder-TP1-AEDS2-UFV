You wont find me  
Knockin at your door  
Ive known forever  
You dont love me no more  
  
If you dont want to lay there  
With your mouth shut tight  
Im gettin myself together  
Yes Im leavin tonight  
  
You aint gonna find nobody  
To treat you like I do  
I bend down on my knees  
You treat me like a fool  
  
Now I know what youre tryin to do  
Awww it aint gonna happen  
Cause I just done got hip to you  
Im a walk out laughin
