Cherry oh Cherry oh baby  
Dont you know Im in need of thee  
If you dont believe its true  
What have you left me to do  
So long Ive been waiting  
For you to come right in  
And now that we are together  
Please make my joy run over  
  
Chorus  
Oh oh ee oh oh ee oh  
Oh oh ee oh ee oh ee oh  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Oh yeah

Cherry oh Cherry oh baby  
Dont you know Im in love with you  
If you dont believe I do  
Then why dont you try me  
Im never gonna let you down  
Never make you wear no frown  
If you say you love me madly  
Then I will receive you gladly  
  
Chorus  
  
Cherry oh Cherry oh baby  
Dont you know Im in love with you  
If you dont believe I do  
Then why dont you try me  
Im never gonna let you down  
Never make you wear no frown  
If you say you love me madly  
Then why do you treat me badly  
  
Chorus
