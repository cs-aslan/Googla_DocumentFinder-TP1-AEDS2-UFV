Body count  
Laying down mutilated  
Its your time to die  
Desolate  
Lurk your satisfaction climax with your death  
All alone  
Youre praying intimidated with my lust for fear  
Dehumanize  
Crying out stimulated  
Your screams fill my soul  
  
Systematic death  
A physical fear  
Psychopathy red  
After death gratification  
  
Graphic dreams  
Played out fucking sick  
Cant control the urge  
Innocent  
Drop dead suicidal pain that I posses  
Vindictive  
Past crimes insidious  
This is my redemption  
Violate  
Force down penetrate as eyes reflecting horror  
  
Systematic death  
A physical fear  
Psychopathy red  
After death gratification  
  
Perversion  
Slow death agonizing  
Stab around the eyes  
Flowing blood  
Will take something pleasure  
Eclipsing our reason  
Whipping burn  
In high imitation  
Scream for an act in vein  
All of these cuts  
Bled out hopelessly  
Now Im an act of rage  
  
Systematic death  
A physical fear  
Psychopathy red  
After death gratification
