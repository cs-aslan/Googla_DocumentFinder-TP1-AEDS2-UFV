I had no reason to believe that love was true  
Infatuation was a game for lonely fools  
I wanted freedom but I guess I always knew  
You love would entangle my emotions  
I feel the power when I hold you close  
Got to feel you near me baby  
You take me higher than I thought I could go  
Cant hide it any longer I need you to know  
Now Im touched by your magic  
At last I can breathe in all of your love  
I couldnt hide from the feelings here inside  
cause Ive waited so long  
This is some kind of magic  
I know that to lose your love would be  
More than I could bear  
I would follow you anywhere  
I cant imagine I could change the way I feel  
When I paint a picture of love its you Im thinking of  
No hesitation when you call me Ill be there  
You know weve got something to believe in  
I never knew it was so easy to love  
But I just cant help it baby  
This love is moving and its out of control  
Cant try it any harder I need you to know  
Now Im touched by your magic  
At last I can breathe in all of your love  
I couldnt hide from the feelings here inside  
cause Ive waited so long  
This is some kind of magic  
I know that to lose your love would be  
More than I could bear  
I would follow you anywhere  
Even when the clouds drift across the sky  
I know that youll make it somehow  
Together well share our dreams  
I know well survive if we only believe in love  
This love is moving and its out of control  
Cant try any harder I need you to know  
Now Im touched by your magic  
At last I can breathe in all of your love  
I couldnt hide from the feelings here inside  
cause Ive waited so long  
This is some kind of magic  
I know that to lose your love would be  
More than I could bear  
I would follow you anywhere  
At last I can breathe in all of your love  
I couldnt hide from the feelings here inside
