You were the one who made me lose control  
Just when I needed to be on my own  
You had an answer but no alibi  
Youre fellin sorry cause theres no time to lie  
So what you deserve everything that you got  
You think Im gonna be there but Im not  
So Take It Any Way You Want It  
Take It Any Way You Please  
Take It Any Way You Want It  
But I dont think you want to bother me  
  
Dont bother runnin through the old routine  
Your words are weak and they dont mean a thing  
You had your chances and you threw em away  
You said the turnaround was in fair play  
So what you deserve everything that you got  
Ya think Im gonna be there but Im not  
  
So Take It Any Way You Want It  
Take It Any Way You Please  
Take It Any Way You Want It  
But I dont think you want to bother me  
  
I dont want to be the one accused  
You never thought youd see the day  
Itd come back on you  
  
You hate to say that maybe you were wrong  
You want contentment but ya cant be that strong  
You see the shadow on the window blind  
But that shadow will never be mine  
So what you deserve everything that you got  
Ya think Im gonna be there but Im not  
  
So Take It Any Way You Want It  
Take It Any Way You Please  
Take It Any Way You Want It  
But I dont think you want to bother me  
  
Take It Any Way You Want It  
Take It Any Way You Please  
Take It Any Way You Want It  
But I dont think you want to bother me
