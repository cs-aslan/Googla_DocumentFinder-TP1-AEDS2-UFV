In the shadows it awakes the desire  
But you know that you cant realize  
And the pressure will just keep rising  
Now the heat is on  
  
Its too late there is no way around it  
You will see for yourself many times  
In the end you will give up the fight  
Unescapable  
  
Cause youre losing your mind and you sleep  
In the heart of the lies  
  
Where is the edge  
Of your darkest emotions  
Why does it all survive  
Where is the light  
Of your deepest devotions  
I pray that its still alive  
  
Its the rule that you live by and die for  
Its the one thing you cant deny  
Even though you dont know what the price is  
It was justified  
  
So much more that youve got left to fight for  
But it still doesnt change who you are  
There is no fear youll ever give in to  
Youre untouchable  
  
Cause youre losing your mind and you sleep  
In the heart of the night  
  
Where is the edge  
Of your darkest emotions  
Why does it all survive  
Where is the light  
Of your deepest devotions  
I pray that its still alive  
  
You cant stop yourself  
Dont want to feel  
Dont want to see what youve become  
You cant walk away  
From who you are  
Never give in  
  
Where is the edge  
Of your darkest emotions  
Why does it all survive  
Where is the light  
Of your deepest devotions  
I pray that its still alive
