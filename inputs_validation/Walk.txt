Cant you see Im easily bothered by persistance  
One step away from lashing out at you  
You want in to get under my skin and call yourself a friend  
Ive got more friends like you  
What do I do  
Is there no standard anymore  
  
What it takes who am I where Ive been belong  
You cant be something youre not  
  
Be yourself by yourself stay away from me  
A lesson learned in life known from the dawn of time  
  
Respect Walk  
  
Run your mouth when Im not around its easy to acheive  
You cry to weak friends that sympathize Can you hear the  
Violins playing your song Those same friens tell me your  
Every word  
  
Are you talking to me  
  
No way punk
