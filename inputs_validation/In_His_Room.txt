He is gonna chase you in and out of a dream  
Youre not gonna thank him and Im tired of this dream  
Take him on occassion in the back of the room  
If they dont show any affection hell died in June  
  
See the stab wounds in his hands  
See him dying in his room  
Hes dying in his room  
Hes dying in his room  
Heading for me heading this way  
He is coming I dont care  
  
I dont want to thank you well I dont mind  
Gave his only pleasures to a friend of mine  
Hes not gonna catch you in a lighted room  
You dont thank him I know I should  
  
See the stab wounds in his hands  
You killed him I dont care  
Keep a promise you would too  
Keep a promise you would too  
See the silence in his head  
He is coming I dont care  
  
Were not gonna make it well I dont mind  
They dont want to thank him they dont have any time  
In a conversation whom they dont know  
They dont have any patience theyre becoming slow  
  
See a famine in his head  
See him coming at their heels  
He loves you give him a chance  
I dont love him I dont care  
See him starving give her hell  
It is over we dont care In His Room
