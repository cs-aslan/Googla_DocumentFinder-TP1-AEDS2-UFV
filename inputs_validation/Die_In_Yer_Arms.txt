Chorus  
Girl I wanna die in your arms tonight  
I really dont care about the wrong or right  
The fruit is forbidden but its sweet and ripe  
I think Im gonna pick me some and take me a bite  
  
Baby girl looks so good she walk so mean  
Got a vicious little sway I think shes semiobscene  
Shell pick your bones clean oh my god shes so fine  
Shes sweeter than the dew out on the grapes on the vine  
Im gonna pick her gonna squeeze her Im gonna make me some wine  
Im a drinker till Im a crazy Ima drink till Im blind  
Im gonna touch her so good Im gonna treat her so fine  
Im gonna make love to her soul Im gonna fuck all with her mind  
  
Girl I wanna die in your arms tonight  
I really dont care about the wrong or right  
The fruit is forbidden but its sweet and ripe  
I think Im gonna pick me some and take me a bite  
  
Baby girl acts so proper like daddys little daughter  
A wolf in sheeps clothing leading lambs down to the slaughter  
Shes looking so young shes smelling so pretty  
Shes a junkie on a binge and her drug is the city  
Shes a vicious little bitty attitude is shitty  
If I get my way shes probably gonna come home with me  
Talk aint good for nothing  
Eyes are made for crying  
Bombs are made for dropping  
Your arms aint made for dying  
  
Chorus Repeat 3X
