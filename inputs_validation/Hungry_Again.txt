The thrill the desire the excitement is gone  
We seem to have found a safe comfort zone  
We worked so hard to get where we are  
That romance got lost on the way  
  
It used to be never enough  
Wed melt with each look and each burning touch  
We laughed and we loved and we just ate it up  
Back when we were hungry that way  
  
Lets love like were hungry again  
Bring back the passion we had back then  
The time has gone by we forgot what it meant  
Lets love like were hungry again  
  
Dont you miss those feelings we had at the start  
And that fire that got started from each little spark  
Oh its good where we are but I miss where weve been  
Lets love like were hungry again now and then  
  
Lets love like were hungry again  
Bring back the passion we had back then  
The time has gone by now weve grown too content  
Lets love like were hungry again now and then  
Lets love like were hungry again
