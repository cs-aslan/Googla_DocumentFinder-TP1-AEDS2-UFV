Its been a cold cold cold cold night tonight  
And I cant get you off my mind  
God knows Ive tried  
Did I throw away the best part of my life  
When I cut you off did I cut myself with the same damn knife  
Hide my tears in the pouring rain had my share of hurt and pain  
Dont say my name run away cause its all in vain  
  
My hearts breaking even now theres no use we even try  
Hey I cried Yeah I lied Hell I almost died  
Both got our reasons lets just fold the cards and say goodbye  
Its all right just two hearts breaking even tonight  
  
Its been a long long long long long time  
Since Ive had your love here in my hands  
We didnt understand it we couldnt understand it  
But nothings fair in love and hate  
You lay it all down and walk away  before its too late  
We danced all night as the music played  
The sheets got tangled in the mess we made  
There in the stains  we remain  
No one left to blame  
  
My hearts breaking even now theres no use we even try  
Hey I cried Yeah I lied Hell I almost died  
Both got our reasons lets just fold the cards and say goodbye  
Its all right just two hearts breaking even tonight  
  
Go on get on with your life Yeah  Ill get on with mine  
Broken hearts cant call the cops yeah its the perfect crime  
Twisting and turning the night keeps me yearning  
Im burning alive  
Im paying the price again  
But Ill see the light again  
  
My hearts breaking even now theres no use we even try  
Hey I cried Yeah I lied Hell I almost died  
Both got our reasons lets just fold the cards and say goodbye  
Its alright just two hearts breaking even tonight  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Oh Im going gonna walk out the door  
Saying you dont care for me anymore  
Thats alright just two hearts breaking even tonight
