Ive seen your picture  
Your name in lights above it  
This is your big debut  
Its like a dream come true  
And when you smile for the camera  
I know theyre love it  
  
I got your pin shot  
I keep it with your letter  
Done up in blueprint blue  
It sure looks good on you  
So wont you smile for the camera  
I know Ill love you better  
  
Peg  
It will come back to you  
Peg  
It will come back to you  
Then the shutter falls  
You see it all in 3D  
Its your favorite foreign movie
