She shines  
In a world full of ugliness  
She matters when everything is meaningless  
  
Fragile  
She doesnt see her beauty  
She tries to get away  
Sometimes  
Its just that nothing seems worth saving  
I cant watch her slip away  
  
I wont let you fall apart  
  
She reads the minds of all the people as they pass her by  
Hoping someone can see  
If I could fix myself Id  but its too late for me  
  
I wont let you fall apart  
  
Well find the perfect place to go where we can run and hide  
Ill build a wall and we can keep them on the other side  
but they keep waiting  
and picking  
  
Its something I have to do  
I was there too  
Before everything else  
I was like you
