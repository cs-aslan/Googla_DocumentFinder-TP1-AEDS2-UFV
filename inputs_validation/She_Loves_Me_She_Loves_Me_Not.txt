Im here alone on the telephone line  
Im right where you want me to be  
And Ill wait alone and never ask why  
Ill be where you want me to be  
  
And I know  
Ive been here before and I know your kind  
Youre right where I want you to be  
Now Ill say what I think  
Ill never be what you want me to be  
Just to be who I am  
What do you want me to be  
  
Youll be on your knees  
  
Tell me  
Tell me its not true
