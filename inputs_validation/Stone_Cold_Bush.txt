Shes stone cold bush yea  
And baby thats alright  
Shes stone cold bush yea  
And thats alright with me  
Get up off your knees come on walk with me  
Tell me what you need to get along  
  
A statue come to life  
I cut you with my knife  
Bleeding to the tune of dolly dagger  
Shes stone cold bush  
Haight Street got nothing to show  
Except the skirt on your ass  
When youre livin on the streets  
Youve got to let it roll  
Get on with what youve got  
Awe everybody knows that its alright  
Youve got no secrets to tell  
But when you smoke that rock and suck that cock  
  
You do it oh so well  
Shes stone cold bush  
Shes got marble eyes  
Sweet china doll her thighs  
And animal in pain she starts to cry  
  
Her pipes are open wide  
She blows more than my mind  
Echo sounds of soul  
Time after time  
Shes stone cold bush
