If I told you that I lie sometimes  
If I told you that Id run away  
If I told you who I was before  
Would you follow me  
  
If I told you that I sneak sometimes  
If I told you that I love too much  
If I showed you the other side  
Would you follow me  
  
Cause Im shedding my skin  
So you can see my face  
I need you to know who I am  
Im ready to go where Ive never been  
Will you stay around and follow me  
  
Yeah  
If I told you the earth was square  
If I told you water wasnt wet  
If I told you life was fair  
Would you follow me  
  
Oh  
Cause Im shedding my skin  
So you can see my face  
I need you to know who I am  
Im ready to go where Ive never been  
Will you stay around and follow me  
  
To the furthest moon and back  
Jupiter and Mars and all that  
To the middle of a galaxy  
On the smallest raft  
I dont know if I can be sure  
Of anything I believed before  
Will you follow me  
  
Cause Im shedding my skin  
So you can see my face  
I need you to know who I am  
Im ready to go where Ive never been  
Will you stay around and follow me  
  
To the moon and back  
Jupiter and Mars and all that
