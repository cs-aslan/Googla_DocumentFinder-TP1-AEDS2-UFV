Diana  
So anyway Im leaving  
I thought youd like to know  
You faithful comewhatmay  
But clearly I cant stay  
Wed both go mad that way  
So here I go  
And anyway Im leaving  
I guess that you can see  
Ill try this on my own  
A life Ive never known  
Ill face the dread alone  
But Ill be free  
  
With you always beside me  
To catch me when I fall  
Id never get to know the feel  
Of solid ground at all  
With you always believing  
That we can still come through  
It makes me feel the fool  
To know that its not true  
  
What doctors call dysfunction  
We tried to call romance  
And true its quite a trick  
To tell the dancers from the dance  
But rather than let chance take me  
Ill take a chance  
Ill take a chance on leaving  
Its that or stay and die  
I loved you once and though  
You love me still I know  
Its time for me to fly  
I loved you once and though  
I love you still I know  
Its time for me to go  
And so goodbye
