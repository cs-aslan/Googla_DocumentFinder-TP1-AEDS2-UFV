Youve got legs just like a long neck bottle  
And lips just like strawberry wine  
You might be a lifetime of trouble  
But still I cant get you out of my mind  
  
Out of my mind Im goin out of my mind  
And I see what Ive been missin all this time  
Oh sweet neon angel dont leave me behind  
No I cant get you out of my mind  
  
Youre bringin on a honkytonk heartache  
And I know youd never walk the line  
To let you slip away its a chance I wont take  
Still I cant get you out of my mind  
  
Out of my mind Im goin out of my mind  
And I see what Ive been missin all this time  
Oh sweet neon angel dont leave me behind  
No I cant get you out of my mind  
No I cant get you out of my mind
