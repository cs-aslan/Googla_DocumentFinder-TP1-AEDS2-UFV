When I was just a little baby  
I didnt have many toys  
But my mama used to say son  
You got more than other boys  
Now you may not be good looking  
And you may not be too rich  
But youll never ever be alone  
Cause youve got lucky lips  
  
Lucky lips are always kissing  
Lucky lips are never blue  
Lucky lips will always find  
A pair of lips so true  
Dont need a fourleaf clover  
Rabbits foot or a good luck charm  
With lucky lips youll always have  
A baby in your arms  
  
I never get heartbroken  
No Ill never get the blues  
And if I play that game of love  
I know I just cant lose  
When they spin that wheel of fortune  
All I do is kiss my chips  
And I know Im bound to win yeah  
cause Ive got lucky lips  
  
Lucky lips are always kissing  
Lucky lips are never blue  
Lucky lips will always find  
A pair of lips so true  
Dont need a fourleaf clover  
Rabbits foot or good luck charm  
With lucky lips Ill always have  
A baby in your arms
