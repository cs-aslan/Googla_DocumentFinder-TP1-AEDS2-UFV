You and me are old  
You and me are young  
You and me have always  
Let words go unsung  
  
Nothing left to see  
Nothing left to do  
Nothing left to talk about  
  
How I intrude  
This impossible room  
I still believe  
That great American smile  
  
Nothings ever right  
Nothings ever wrong  
But nothings ever quite like  
The stories and songs nothings ever  
  
Heroes always bleed  
But heroes never cry  
Heroes always get the best girl  
And then die nothings ever  
  
How I intrude  
This impossible dream  
I still believe  
That great American smile
