There is someone walking behind you  
Turn around look at me  
There is someone watching your footsteps  
Turn around look at me  
  
There is someone who really needs you  
Heres my heart in my hand  
Turn around turn around look at me look at me

Turn around look at me  
And theres someone wholl love and guide you  
Turn around look at me

Look at someone look at someone  
Who really loves you yeah really loves you  
Turn around look at me
