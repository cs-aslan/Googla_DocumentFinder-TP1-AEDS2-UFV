Let me tell you bout a friend of mine  
Hes a short order cook  
Long on speed and hes short on spice  
He reads his customers like a book  
Hes seen this and hes done that  
And now hes makin fried eggs an art  
But theres one thing he cant fix no how  
Theres a longing in his heart  
Tried for years to work it out  
At the grill and at his home  
Talks to his friends he talks to himself  
Hed talk the chicken right off the bone  
Talks to his woman and she understands  
You know theyre always eye to eye  
Well she runs the joint they live out back  
Its a small house under a big sky  
And even the stars at night agree  
The sky is fallin apart  
And she knows cause she can feel it too  
Theres a longing in her heart  
Longing in her heart  
Well you and me were just like them  
We never wanted to be alone  
So we made a pact sealed with desire  
For a happier house and home  
Only to find it doesnt untie  
The knot where feelings die  
Theres a longing deep inside our hearts  
Oh and no one to tell us why  
Well our friends aint lookin for anything new  
You know they wouldnt know where to look  
Well her she likes runnin that joint  
And he likes bein a cook  
Together theyre doin very well  
You know theyre mighty glad they could  
Well theres a fire burnin and its towards them now  
Comin from a distant wood  
Even the stars at night agree  
The sky is fallin apart  
We know cause we can feel it too  
Theres a longing in our hearts  
Longing in our hearts longing in our hearts
