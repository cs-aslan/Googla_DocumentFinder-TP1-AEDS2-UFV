Always late with your kisses  
Wont you come to my arms  
Sweet darling and stay  
Always late with your kisses  
Why oh why do you want to do me this way  
How long do you think that I can wait  
When you know youre always late  
Always late with your kisses  
Why why why do you want to do me this way  
  
How long do you think that I can wait  
When you know youre always late  
Always late with your kisses  
Why why why do you want to do me this way
