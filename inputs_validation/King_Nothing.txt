Wish I may  
Wish I might  
Have this I wish tonight  
Are you satisfied  
Dig for gold  
Dig for fame  
You dig to make your name  
Are you pacified  
All the wants you waste  
All the things youve chased  
Then it all crashes down  
And you break your crown  
And you point your finger but theres no one around  
Just want one thing  
Just to play the King  
But the castles crumbled and youre left with just a name  
Wheres your crown King Nothing  
Wheres your crown  
Hot and cold  
Bought and sold  
A heart as hard as gold  
Yeah Are you satisfied  
Wish I might Wish I may  
You wish your life away  
Are you pacified  
All the wants you waste  
All the things youve chased  
Then it all crashes down  
And you break your crown  
And you point your finger but theres no one around  
Just want one thing  
Just to play the King  
But the castles crumbled and youre left with just a name  
Wheres your crown King Nothing  
Wheres your crown  
Huh  
Spoken  
Wish I may wish I might  
Have this wish I wish tonight  
I want that star I want it now  
I want it all and I dont care how  
Careful what you wish  
Careful what you say  
Careful what you wish you may regret it  
Careful what you wish you just might get it  
Then it all crashes down  
And you break your crown  
And you point your finger but theres no one around  
Just want one thing  
Just to play the King  
But the castles crumbled and youre left with just a name  
Wheres your crown King Nothing  
Wheres your crown  
Oh Youre just nothing  
Wheres your crown King Nothing  
Oh youre just nothing  
Absolutely nothing  
Off to never never land
