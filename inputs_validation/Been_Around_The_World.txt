Chorus  
I been around the world  
And gets nothing but love  
For who I am  
I thank my fans so much  
Even though some may hate  
Still I appreciate  
All my friends and family  
That kept it real with me  
  
I been around the world and back like what up  
East side to west side touring like what up  
And even though the price for the house was so much  
I still roll with them from the hood like what up  
Cause when it comes to being the realest Im sure nough  
Im a straight up industry villain for sure nough  
And I cant satisfy some a yall no matter what  
And some of yall cats are so jealous  
Said we livin in a cold cold world  
Aint nothin but fake faces fake people fake friends  
Said we living in a cold cold world  
Where there aint nuttin but envy wannabees playahatas  
Yea I know I need a hug but yall need a hug too  
cause god gunna judge me the same day he judge you  
And even though we have our struggles thats alright  
You know we get our folks and find a way to shine  
  
Chorus  
  
Ja Rule  
Sometimes this world can be so cold  
When you looking through the windows of the soul  
I been looking to see the truth as it unfolds  
Cause I been around this globe and back  
Enough to know the fact  
Who loves me  
And who loves me not  
We be shits so hot  
You could put it in red tops  
And pump it through every hood ghetto and block  
Until they heart stops  
Thats why they fiend for me  
And I thank you for every blessing that you giving me lord  
And Im grateful for all my talent and my vocal accords  
And all these haters I keep shaking em off  
Rubbing they face in fame  
Im sorry I changed the game  
But its mine and I cant complain  
Rule and are Kelly  
Been around the world  
Putting it on women  
Bumping and grinding these bitches  
But we always on time when a woman fed up  
And thats love  
Thats why they all fuck wit us  
  
Chorus  
  
Said my lyrics is my testimony  
Thats how I live  
I had to get rid of a lot of fake homies  
Over the years  
You see me on TV sometimes  
Not how it is  
Yall gotta start learning how to separate me from showbiz  
When Im rolling through your city  
Show me love  
And ladies when you see a boy  
Give me love  
And though Im not conceited right  
Its just my space sometimes I need it right  
Said I got so many friends in them area codes  
That I hand out them tickets when it comes to my shows  
Ja lets break bread together  
Pray together  
That we grow strong together  
Its clear forever  
Help each other through the stormy weather  
Lets hurt together  
Lets cry together  
And even if we grow together  
Then together well make it better  
  
Chorus  
  
Said I been around the world  
And gets nothing but love  
For who I am  
I thank my fans so much  
Even though some may hate  
Still I appreciate  
All my friends and family  
That kept it real with me
