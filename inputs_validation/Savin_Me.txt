Prison gates wont open up for me  
On these hands and knees Im crawlin  
Oh I reach for you well Im terrified of these four walls  
These iron bars cant hold my soul in  
All I need is you come please Im callin  
And oh I scream for you  
Hurry Im fallin Im fallin  
  
Chorus  
Show me what its like  
To be the last one standing  
And teach me wrong from right  
And Ill show you what I can be  
Say it for me say it to me  
And Ill leave this life behind me  
Say it if its worth saving me  
  
Heavens gates wont open up for me  
With these broken wings Im fallin and all I see is you  
These city walls aint got no love for me  
Im on the ledge of the eighteenth story  
And oh I scream for you come please  
Im callin and all I need from you hurry Im fallin Im fallin  
  
Chorus  
  
Hurry Im fallin  
And all I need is you  
Come please Im callin  
And oh I scream for you  
Hurry Im fallin Im fallin Im fallin  
  
Show me what its like  
To be the last one standing  
And teach me wrong from right  
And Ill show you what I can be  
And say it for me say it to me  
And Ill leave this life behind me  
Say it if its worth saving me hurry Im fallin  
  
Say it for me say it to me  
And Ill leave this life behind me  
Say it if its worth saving me
