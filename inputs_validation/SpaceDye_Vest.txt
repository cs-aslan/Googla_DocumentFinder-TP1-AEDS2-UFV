Falling through pages of Martens on angels  
Feeling my heart pull west  
I saw the future dressed as a stranger  
Love in a spacedye vest  
  
Love is an act of blood and Im bleeding  
A pool in the shape of a heart  
Beauty projection in the reflection  
Always the worst way to start  
  
But hes the sort who cant know  
Anyone intimately least of all a  
Woman  
He doesnt know what a woman  
Is  
He wants you for a possession  
Something to look at like a painting or an ivory box  
Something to own and to display  
He doesnt want you to be real  
Or to think or to live  
He doesnt love you but I love you  
I want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and  
Feelings even when  
I hold you in my arms  
Its our last chance  
Its our  
Last chance  
  
Now that youre gone Im trying to take it  
Learning to swallow the rage  
Found a new girl I think we can make it  
As long as she stays on the page  
  
This is not how I want it to end  
And Ill never be open again  
  
I was gonna move out get  
Get a job get my own place  
But I go into the mall where I  
Want to work and they tell me Im  
I was too young  
  
Some people gave advice before  
About facing the facts about  
Facing reality And this is this  
Without a doubt is his biggest  
Challenge ever Hes going to have to face it  
Youre gonna have to try hes gonna to have to try and  
Uh and and and get some help here I mean no one can  
Say they know how he feels  
  
That so they say that in ya know  
Like Houston or something youd  
Say its a hundred and eighty degrees  
But its a dry heat  
In Houston they say that  
Oh maybe not Im all mixed up  
Dry until they hit the swimming pool  
  
I get up with the sun listen  
You have your own room to sleep in  
I dont care what you do I dont  
Care when That door gets locked  
That door gets locked at night by nine oclock  
If youre not in this house by nine oclock then youd  
Better find some  
Place to sleep Because youre not going to be a bum in  
This house  
Supper is ready  
  
Theres no one to take my blame  
If they wanted to  
Theres nothing to keep me sane  
And its all the same to you  
Theres nowhere to set my aim  
So Im everywhere  
Never come near me again  
Do you really think I need you  
  
Ill never be open again I could never be open again  
Ill never be open again I could never be open again  
  
And Ill smile and Ill learn to pretend  
And Ill never be open again  
And Ill have no more dreams to defend  
And Ill never be open again
