Now warning lights are flashing down at Quality Control  
Somebody threw a spanner and they threw it in a hole  
Theres rumors in the loading bay and anger in the town  
Somebody blew the whistle and the walls are closing down  
Theres a meeting in the boardroom theyre trying to trace the smell  
Theres leaking in the washroom theres a stinking personnel  
Somewhere in the corridors someone was heard to sneeze  
Goodness me could this be Industrial Disease  
  
The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post  
Theyre refusing to be pacified its him they blame the most  
The watchdogs got rabies the foremans got fleas  
And everyones concerned about Industrial Disease  
Theres panic on the switchboard tongues are in knots  
Some come out in sympathy some come out in spots  
Some blame the management some the employees  
Everybody knows its the Industrial Disease  
  
The work force is disgusted downs tools and walks  
Innocence is injured experience just talks  
Everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees  
That these are classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze  
On ITV and BBC they talk about the curse  
Philosophy is useless theology is worse  
History boils over theres an economics freeze  
  
Sociologists invent words that mean Industrial Disease  
Doctor Parkinson declared Im not surprised to see you here  
Youve got smokers cough from smoking brewers droop from drinking beer  
I dont know how you came to get the Betty Davis ease  
But worst of all young man youve got Industrial Disease  
  
He wrote me a prescription he said you are depressed  
But Im glad you came to see me to get this off your chest  
Come back and see me later  next patient please  
Send in another victim of Industrial Disease  
I go down to Speakers Corner Im thunderstruck  
They got free speech tourists police in trucks  
Two men say theyre Jesus one of them must be wrong  
Theres a protest singer singing a protest song  he says  
They want to have a war to keep their factories  
They want to have a war to keep us on our knees  
They want to have a war to stop us buying Japanese  
They want to have a war to stop Industrial Disease  
Theyre pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind  
They want to sap your energy incarcerate your mind  
They give you Rule Brittania gassy beer page three  
Two weeks in Espana and Sunday striptease  
Meanwhile the first Jesus says Id cure it soon  
Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons  
The other ones out on hunger strike hes dying by degrees  
How come Jesus gets Industrial Disease
