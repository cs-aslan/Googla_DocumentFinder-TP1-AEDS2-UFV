No she not gone forever  
Shes just playing one of her games  
And tonight when I get home  
Everything will be the same  
  
Cause when I woke up this morning  
Yes I found her goodbye note  
It just a game shes plays  
It just a goodbye joke  
  
Shes just goin downtown shopping  
Shell bring me back some sporty clothes  
Cause Im always on her mind  
No matter where she plans to go  
  
If I thought she was gone forever  
Lord Id find me a hangin rope  
Thats why Im drifting now  
Its just a goodbye joke  
  
Aint it funny the sense of humor  
A woman can have sometimes  
Especially that lovely woman of mine  
Hey bartender wont you bring me a drink  
  
Cause I still like unknown  
On the words she wrote  
In her little goodbye joke
