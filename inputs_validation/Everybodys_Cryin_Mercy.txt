I dont believe the things Im seein  
Ive been wonderin bout some things Ive heard  
Everybodys crying mercy  
When they dont know the meaning of the word  
  
  
A bad enough situation  
Is sure enough getting worse  
Everybodys crying justice  
Just as soon as theres business first  
  
Toe to toe touch and go  
Give a cheer and get your own souvenir  
  
Well you know the people running round in circles  
Dont know what theyre headed for  
Everybodys crying peace on earth  
Just as soon as we win this war  
  
Straight ahead gotta knock em dead  
So pack your kit choose your own hypocrite  
  
You dont have to go to offBroadway  
To see something plain absurd  
Everybodys crying mercy  
When they dont know the meaning of the word  
  
Nobody knows the meaning of the word
