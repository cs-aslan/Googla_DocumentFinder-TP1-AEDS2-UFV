Aint no job too big or small  
Just one sweep of the wreckin ball  
Put em up well knock em down  
Or knock em up then leave town  
Demolition of the mind  
Desolation left behind  
Light the fuse dynamite  
Light the sky in the night  
  
We will walk  
All over you  
Cause we are  
The wreckin Wreckin crew  
We are the wreckin crew  
  
Wreckin crew  
We are the wreckin crew  
  
Destruction is a way life  
Destruction mayhem havoc strife  
Crack a smile here the sound  
Watch em crumble to the ground  
Innocence aint no excuse  
Slip your neck inside the noose  
Pay in blood I demand  
The wreckin crew is outta hand  
  
Well wreck your neck  
Wreckin crew  
Get wrecked  
  
Turn to ashes turn to dust  
Were the ones that you can trust  
Evil smile wicked grin  
Tear it down begin to sin  
Think that you will end it all  
Theres no one left to ball or call  
When there aint nothin left to do  
Call upon the wreckin crew  
  
Well wreck your neck  
Wreckin crew  
Yer wreck  
Ah Wreckin crew  
Wreck Wreck
