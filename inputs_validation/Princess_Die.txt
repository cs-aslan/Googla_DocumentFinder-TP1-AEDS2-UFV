Leave the coffin open when I go  
Leave my prose and lipstick on so everybody knows  
Pretty will be the photograph I leave  
Laying down on famous knives so everybody sees  
  
Bleach out all all the dark  
Ill swallow each peroxide shot  
Someone Ill know could love and save me from myself  
Maybe Ill just clean the shit of these fancy shoes  
Ill be a princess di and die with you  
  
Chorus  
I wish that I was strong  
I wish that I was wrong  
I wish that I could cope  
But I took pills and left a note  
  
Im hungry from an anorexic heart  
Ive been trying to tell you how I feel  
But was never very smart  
Im wrapped in silks made for egyptian queens  
Ill do it in the swimming pool  
So everybody sees  
  
Bleach out all the dark  
Ill swallow each peroxide shot  
Volumes I know will love and save me from myself  
Maybe Ill just keep clean the shit off of these fancy shoes  
Ill be a princess di and die with you  
  
Princess die  
I want to see her cry  
Princess die  
Princess die  
We want to watch her cry  
Princess die  
  
Chorus  
I wish that I was strong  
I wish that I was wrong  
I wish that I could cope  
But I took pills and left a note  
  
Bridge  
But I took pills and left a note  
I wish that I could go in my rich boyfriends limo  
Right after he proposed with a 16carat stone wrapped in rose gold  
With the paparazzi all swarming around  
In my louis vuiton white buttoned down  
Oh its not that deep  
So bob your head for another dead blonde  
Whos real prince is in heaven  
She just wants to sleep  
  
The final act of life will be my own hands to do  
Ill be a princess die and die with you  
Applaud Approve
