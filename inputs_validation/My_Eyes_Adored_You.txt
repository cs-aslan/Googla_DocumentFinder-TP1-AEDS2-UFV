My eyes adore ya  
  
Girl youre deep inside each day  
Waiting for the courage  
That never came  
  
So on you went without a clue  
That these adoring eyes they long for you  
I tried to get real close to you  
Hoping that you would see through  
My disguise  
And somehow you know that I  
  
Chorus  
  
I adored ya  
Though I never laid my hands on you  
My eyes adored ya  
My eyes adored ya  
Like you couldnt see  
A millions miles away  
How I adored ya  
So close so close  
So close and yet so far  
  
You looked at me  
And saw a friend  
You told me things  
And Id have to pretend  
That you didnt mean  
The world to me  
And all the while  
Behind the scenes  
I cried with you  
And lived your every dream  
Yes I did  
  
The reality  
The hopes still there  
And dreams run wild  
Ill make time to  
So tell me tell me baby  
Was I a fool  
Do your eyes adore me too
