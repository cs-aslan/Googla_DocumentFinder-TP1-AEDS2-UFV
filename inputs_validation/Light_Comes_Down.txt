When the light comes down  
Were gonna cuddle up close  
Gonna paint this town  
Were gonna rub their noses  
Hey mama want to know  
Why Im never lonely  
want to know  
Why Im never sad  
  
When the night comes out  
And the sandman rides  
Were gonna sing and shout  
Im gonna take you places  
Hey mamma then Ill show you  
Why youll never be lonely  
Then youll know  
How youll never be sad  
  
On your marks with the sun still pouring in  
Hold steady till were ready for the evening  
Gettin set for a ride all around the town  
Then you take me where you want to go  
  
On your mark with the sun still pouring in  
Hold steady till were ready for the evening  
Gettin set take a ride all around the town  
Then you tell me where you want to go  
  
When the light comes down  
Were gonna button up tight  
And lose this daytime frown  
Were gonna smile all night long  
Hey mamma and I know  
That youll never be lonely  
want to show you  
That youll never be sad  
  
When the light comes down  
Were gonna cuddle up close  
Were gonna paint this town  
Were gonna rub their noses  
  
Baby when the light comes down  
Yes when the light comes down  
Baby when the light comes down  
Yes when the light comes down  
Yes when the lights come down  
When the light comes down
