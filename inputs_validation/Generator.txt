We generate heat  
We generate emotion  
We generate a feeling  
That is better left here  
Than a memory on a wall  
  
Id rather cry than forget you  
  
We generate pain  
We generate suspicion  
We generate a rumour thats sick  
But a rumour that is probably true  
  
Id rather die than forget you  
  
I wont let my dreams slip away from me  
Im talking sex motion  
Im talking bout fashion  
Im talking bout skin games  
Im talking bout secrets  
  
And I wont let my heart run away with me  
Im talking temptation  
Im talking bout memories  
Im talking bout feelings  
Im talking bout emotion  
  
We generate lies  
We generate pictures  
We generate a video film  
That I couldnt let my best friend see  
  
Id rather lose than forgive you  
  
We generate shame  
We generate secrets  
We generate a reason for living  
And we generate a reason for not  
  
Id rather hurt than forget you  
  
I cant believe that Im here  
I cant believe what Ive seen  
I cant believe what Im doing to you
