Through the corridors of sleep  
Past the shadows dark and deep  
My mind dances and leaps in confusion  
I dont know what is real  
I cant touch what I feel  
And I hide behind the shield of my illusion  
So Ill continue to continue to pretend  
My life will never end  
And Flowers Never Bend With The Rainfall  
The mirror on my wall  
Casts an image dark and small  
But Im not sure at all its my reflection  
I am blinded by the light  
Of God and truth and right  
  
And I wander in the night without direction  
So Ill continue to continue to pretend  
My life will never end  
And Flowers Never Bend With The Rainfall  
Its no matter if youre born  
To play the King or pawn  
For the line is thinly drawn tween joy and sorrow  
So my fantasy  
Becomes reality  
And I must be what I must be and face tomorrow  
So Ill continue to continue to pretend  
My life will never end  
And Flowers Never Bend With The Rainfall
