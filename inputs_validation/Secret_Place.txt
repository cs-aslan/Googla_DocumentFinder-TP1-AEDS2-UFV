In the secret place  
I find You  
In Your sweet embrace  
In the stillness Lord  
Im waiting  
Here to hear Your voice  
Calling me  
Youre drawing me  
Jesus Youre all I need  
  
You are all I need my Jesus  
Youre my everything  
  
You are all I ever wanted  
All I ever need my Jesus  
  
Take me to the secret place Lord  
Youre all I need  
Into the secret place Lord  
  
Just one moment here with You  
Means more than anything to me
