When you spend your whole life  
Building stone castles  
When the walls start to crumble  
Exposed to the world  
When the wind burns my face  
And the smoke burns my eyes  
I cant ever cry  
I cant ever cry  
CHORUS  
You gotta help     
To make me somebody  
You gotta help     
To open my eyes  
The temperatures rising  
How a cool drink would help  
Ive been thirsty for years  
Ive been thirsty for years  
Im hungry for something     
Just the touch of your flesh  
To sooth and refresh     
To sooth and refresh  
CHORUS
