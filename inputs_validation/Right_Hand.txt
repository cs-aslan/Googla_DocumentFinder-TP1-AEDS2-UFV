But I swear you gotta chill  
You wanna grip Benz wheel  
And I know you cant wait  
You dream big and sleep late  
You got a lot on your plate  
Thats why youre always working out  
Taking pictures of yourself

Youre like fuck it oh well  
My past behind me like a pony tail

Verse 2  
Ok I know you want the Audi  
I know you want to go to Maui  
You and all your girlfriends  
The ones you never bring around me  
Cause you dont trust me like your last man  
Did he open doors for ya  
Buy the things he cant afford for ya  
Cause he must have did a lot for ya  
I just fell back with it  
And now your past is behind you  
Like the car with the strap in it  
Thank god thats finished  
Cause now its back to business  
Any more henny and youre past the limit  
You told me about the picture  
Now you have to send it  
I would never put you on blast when I get it
