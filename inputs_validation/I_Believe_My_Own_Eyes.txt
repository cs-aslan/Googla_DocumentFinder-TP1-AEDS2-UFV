As performed in the musical tommy  
With alistair robins as mr walker  
Written by pete townsend  
  
Alistair this cant continue  
It makes no sense  
Were getting nowhere  
Ive lost all my confidence  
The boy wants something  
Unsatisfied  
He needs attention  
And care our love cant provide  
  
And then theres the matter of us  
  
Id like to prove  
That I dont think youve seen the best of me  
Ive stood up for the boy  
And Ive clung to the hopes and the lies  
  
I wished that the pain in your gaze  
Could again be a test of me  
But when I look in the mirror  
I believe my own eyes  
  
I believe my own eyes  
Now Ive come to the end  
All my patience is gone  
When Im doubtful I tend  
To believe my own eyes  
  
Kim Id like to declare  
This devotion and care is a life to live  
That nothing has changed  
And the time isnt passing us by  
But I have to say here  
That for us there is a clearcut alternative  
When we look at eachother  
We believe our own eyes  
  
Both I believe my own eyes  
Now Ive come to the end  
All my patience is gone  
When Im doubtful I tend  
To believe my own eyes  
  
This has gone far enough  
After all weve been through  
We can be brave  
We done all we can humanly do  
Its a time to be tough  
A time to be wise  
We must stop chasing our dreams and recover our lives  
  
I believe my own eyes  
Now Ive come to the end  
All my patience is gone  
When Im doubtful I tend  
To believe  
  
Id like to believe  
But I dont think that weve seen the best of us  
And a way to believe is to see where the real future lies  
I hope that the pain in your gaze can again be a test of me  
And when I look in the mirror  
I believe my own eyes  
  
Lets believe our own eyes  
No weve come to the end  
All our patience is gone  
Lets admit we intend to believe our own eyes  
  
Kim  to believe our own eyes
