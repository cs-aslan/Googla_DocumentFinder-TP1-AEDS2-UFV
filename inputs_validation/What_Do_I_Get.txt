I just want a lover like any other what do I get  
I only want a friend who will stay to the end what do I get  
  
What do I get whoa what do I get  
What do I get whoa what do I get  
  
Im in distress I need a caress what do I get  
Im not on the make I just need a break what do I get  
  
What do I get whoa what do I get  
What do I get whoa what do I get  
  
I only get sleepless nights  
Alone here in my halfempty bed  
For you things seem to turn out right  
I wish theyd only happen to me instead  
  
What do I get whoa what do I get  
What do I get whoa what do I get  
  
I only get sleepless nights  
Alone here in my halfempty bed  
For you things seem to turn out right  
I wish theyd only happen to me instead  
  
What do I get whoa what do I get  
What do I get whoa what do I get  
  
I just want a lover like any other what do I get  
I only want a friend who will stay to the end what do I get  
  
What do I get whoa what do I get  
What do I get whoa what do I get  
  
Well let me tell you now  
What do I get  
No love  
What do I get  
No sleep at night  
What do I get  
Nothing thats nice  
What do I get  
Nothing at all at all at all  
  
Cause I dont get you
