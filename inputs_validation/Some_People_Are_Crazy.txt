Some people are crazy about him  
Some people cant stand his face  
Some people they smile when they know hes coming  
Some people chase him out of the place  
  
But this loving kind of business  
Might make your poor heart glad  
Yes this loving kind of business  
Might be the best find you ever had  
The best find you ever had  
  
Some people are crazy  
Some people are just plain good  
Some people talk wouldness and couldness  
Some people dont do as they should  
  
But this loving kind of business  
Might make your poor heart glad  
Yes this loving kind of business  
Might be the best thing that you ever had  
The best find you ever had  
  
Some people got a glass eye  
Some people got a window to watch  
Some people draw conclusions like curtains  
Dont they draw them tight  
  
Dont they draw them tight  
Dont they draw them tight  
Dont they draw them tight  
  
Some people are crazy about him  
Some people they cant stand his face  
Some people they laugh when they know hes coming  
Some people chase him out of the place  
  
Some people are crazy  
Some people are just like me  
Some people are crazy  
Some people are just like me
