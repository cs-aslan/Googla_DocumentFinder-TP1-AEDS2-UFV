Were here because of grace  
A part of Your great plan  
We have come to seek Your face  
Not the wonders of Your hands  
And yes we need Your touch  
But Youve given us so much  
That we just want to thank You  
For all Youve done for us  
  
Chorus  
Weve come to bless Your name  
King of kings and Lord of lords  
Weve come to give You praise  
You are the One that we adore  
O Lord cleanse our hearts with fire  
And fill us with desire for Your courts  
For Your presence in our lives  
  
Lord Youve made a way  
Because of Your great love  
And our hearts are filled with praise  
For all that You have done  
There is none like You  
So faithful and so true  
And we just want to thank You  
For all Youve brought us through  
  
Chorus  
Weve come to bless Your name  
King of kings and Lord of lords  
Weve come to give You praise  
You are the One that we adore  
O Lord cleanse our hearts with fire  
And fill us with desire for Your courts  
For Your presence in our lives 2x  
  
Chorus  
Weve come to bless Your name  
King of kings and Lord of lords  
Weve come to give You praise  
You are the One that we adore  
O Lord cleanse our hearts with fire  
And fill us with desire for Your courts  
For Your presence in our lives 2x
