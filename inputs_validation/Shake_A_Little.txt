In the shadow of your father  
Sweet brown eyes of the one I love  
I cant wait another minute baby  
To do the things that we never done  
Everybody gets hungry sometimes  
Your love is like a kettle on  
In the shadow of your father  
Guess I get a little sad sometimes  
Shake a little for me baby  
Take me to the water when my well runs dry  
Shake a little for me baby  
Just a little now  
Just a little now  
Everybody gets lonely sometimes  
Guess a stranger is a friend in need  
In the shadow of this New York skyline  
All these stories looking down on me  
Everybody feels the water rising  
Could go under Ill enjoy the ride  
Ah when youre dancing for me now baby  
I dont feel so small against the tide  
Shake a little for me baby  
Take me to the water when my well runs dry  
Shake a little for me baby  
Shake a little for me baby  
Take me to the water when my cup runs dry  
Shake a little for me baby  
Just a little now  
Just a little now  
Just a little now
