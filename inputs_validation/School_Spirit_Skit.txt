Now beat that  
And your mothers saying go to college  
So you finish college and its wonderful  
You feel so good  
And after all the partying and crazing  
And dont forget about that drug habit you picked up at school being around
your peers  
Hey now youll get that 25 thou job a year and  
Youll spend all your money on crack cocaine but itll be youre your money  
No more borrowing money from mom for my high  
So now you get youre degree tattooed on your back your so excited about it  
If you continue to work at the GAP after several interviews Oh my god  
Youll come in at an entry level position and when you do that  
If you kiss enough ass youll move up to the next level  
Which is being a secretarys secretary  
And boy is that great you get to take messages for the secretary  
Who never went to college  
Shes actually the bosses niece so now your apart of the family  
You know what college does for you  
It makes you really smart man  
All you kids want to talk in the back of the class not me I listened ok  
I was a hall monitor This was meant to be  
You know how many classes I took extra classes extra classes  
No Ive never had sex but you know what my degree keeps me satisfied  
When a lady walks to me says hey you know whats sexy  
I say no I dont know what it is  
But I bet I can add up all the change in your purse really fast
