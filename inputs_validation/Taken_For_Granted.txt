Im sitting in the car again  
Waiting for you  
You said youd be a minute  
But youve been twenty two  
See youve got to do your hair  
And get it just right  
Sometimes youre in the bathroom  
For half of the night  
  
And Im waiting for you again  
Yes Im waiting for you  
And Im waiting for you again  
Tell me what can I do  
And Im waiting for you again  
Yes Im waiting for you  
And Im waiting for you again  
Tell me what can I do  
  
Now Im sitting by the phone again  
Waiting for your call  
Youd said youd phone at two  
And its a quarter past four  
Now Im standing out the front  
Again  
Its late at night  
And Im truly sick to death of  
Sleazy men  
Undressing me with their eyes  
  
And Im waiting for you again  
Yes Im waiting for you  
And Im waiting for you again  
Tell me what can I do  
And Im waiting for you again  
Yes Im waiting for you  
And Im waiting for you again  
Tell me what can I do  
  
Now Im back back from  
The theater  
I watched the show alone  
I waited for you and  
I missed half act one  
Have you never heard  
Of the phone  
I dont like being  
Taken for granted  
Im too nice for my own good  
See I do what I say  
And I say what I do  
Is it too much to expect  
That you could  
I wish you would  
  
I aint waiting for you no more  
I aint waiting for you  
I aint waiting for you no more  
Go find another fool  
I aint waiting for you no more  
I aint waiting for you  
I aint waiting for you no more  
Its the usual coup  
I aint waiting for you no more  
I aint waiting for you  
I aint waiting for you no more  
May I show you the door  
I aint waiting for you no more  
I aint waiting for you  
I aint waiting for you no more  
I aint missing nothing for you
