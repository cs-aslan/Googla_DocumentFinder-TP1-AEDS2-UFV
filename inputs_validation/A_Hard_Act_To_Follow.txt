Well I can see youre advertisin cause you keep givin me the eye  
It wont take long till your in my song I want to be with you tonight  
Ive been battlin needin bookins and you the best contract Ive known  
Im a gonna be a hard act to follow if you keep comin on  
  
Im a gonna be a hard act to follow since you have set the stage  
Take the key and unlock door let the tiger out of his cage  
Just one more big rehearsal another night with you alone  
And Im a gonna be a hard act to follow if you keep a comin on  
  
Well the introductions over we got our hearts in tune  
Let me know before we start the show am I fallin in love to soon  
I got a heart nearly as big as Texas about the size of the astrodome  
And Im a gonna be a hard act to follow if you keep a comin on  
  
Im a gonna be a hard act to follow since you have set the stage  
Take the key and unlock door let the tiger out of his cage  
I dont want no double feature cause my heart just thinks that wrong  
But Im a gonna be a hard act to follow if you keep a comin on  
Yeah Im a gonna be a hard act to follow if you keep a comin on
