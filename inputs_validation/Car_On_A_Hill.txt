Ive been sitting up waiting for my sugar to show  
Ive been listening to the sirens and the radio  
He said hed be over three hours ago  
Ive been waiting for his car on the hill  
He makes friends easy  
Hes not like me  
I watch for judgement anxiously  
Now where in the city can that boy be  
Waiting for a car  
Climbing  
Climbing  
Climbing the hill  
  
Hes a real good talkerI think hes friend  
Fast tires come screaming around the bend  
But theres still no buzzer  
They roll on  
AndIm waiting for his car on the hill  
It always seems so righteous at the start  
When theres so much laughter  
When theres so much spark  
When theres so much sweetness in the dark  
Waiting for a car  
Climbing  
Climbing  
Climbing the hill
