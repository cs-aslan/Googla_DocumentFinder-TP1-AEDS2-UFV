A one two a one two yeah yeah  
Id like to introduce to you  
Wyclef jean with gloria estefan  
When the cubans meet the haitians and sicilians  
  
Hold your corner hold your corner  
For all the thugs whove ever been in love  
Hey yo this one goes out for the Cuban kings and queens  
You ever fell in love with a pretty serpentine  
  
I met her at the club yes down with my pager  
Asked her whats her name she said Gloria  
Where you from Cuba  
What do you do Im a singer  
  
I pulled out my stash  
She said are you a dealer from Havana  
No no  
Yo can I buy you a tequila  
  
She said hell no Ill take a pina colada  
Now with one drink Ill put her in a spell  
Im huntin the kid  
Like a cheetah hunts a gazelle  
  
I know its wrong but Im waiting for her mistake  
So I can take over like the devils advocate

And I dont want to come down
