Ill send her a rose and I wonder  
Will she cry or will she smile  
Darling dont let me down  
Dont get some other one  
cause Im for you  
  
Youre my sweetest angel you go to my heart  
Youre my sweetest angel youve got the touch to my heart  
Baby yeah  
  
I took her hand and she smiled  
Darling I feel true love  
Damn it I wont  
Damn it I wont let you down  
cause Im for you  
  
Youre my sweetest angel you go to my heart  
Youre my sweetest angel youve got the touch to my heart  
Baby yeah  
  
I only need my little room  
A mirror and a brush  
Dont forget the nicest pillowcase  
  
Youre my sweetest angel you go to my heart  
Youre my sweetest angel youve got the touch to my heart  
Baby yeah
