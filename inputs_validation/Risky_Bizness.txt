Eight ounce gloves now its title time  
You can use your chosen tools and Ill choose mine  
Im afraid weve gone and laid it on the line its a risky bizness  
Oh in the garden time to go show them crazies whos the one who runs the show  
While they gamble in your corner for your robe its a risky bizness  
And the best that you can do is buy some time till they can find somebody
better  
It dont matter what they call you  
When you know youve been the best that you could be  
Give em hell boy while you can make em fight to take the title you defend  
Till they nail you with some doublecross again its a risky bizness
