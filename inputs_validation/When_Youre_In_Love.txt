When youre in love  
You dont know much about it  
Not in your mind  
Romantic love  
Rots the brain  
No doubt about it  
Youre out of your mind  
Youre out of your mind  
  
Seeing things like your heart with wings  
Then you hear violin strings playing  
Feel all the things that you feel you should  
You would lie you would kill you would die  
At least thats what youre saying  
The worst thing is that you really would  
  
When youre in love  
You dont know much about it  
Not in your mind  
Romantic love  
Rots the brain  
No doubt about it  
Youre out of your mind  
Youre out of your mind  
  
Six thousand million people in the world  
And you say theres just one  
The only one and you must be together  
And if they love you the pain is so sweet  
And it just gets better and better  
And if they dont  
You want them more than ever  
  
When youre in love  
You dont know much about it  
Not in your mind  
Romantic love  
Rots the brain  
No doubt about it  
Youre out of your mind  
Youre out of your mind
