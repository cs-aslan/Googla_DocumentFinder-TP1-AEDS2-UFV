Verse 1  
Ive been spinning now for time  
Couple women by my side  
I got sinning on my mind  
Sipping on red wine  
Ive been sitting here for ages  
Ripping out the pages  
Howd I get so faded  
Howd I get so faded  
  
PreChorus  
Oh no no dont leave me lonely now  
If you loved me howd you never learn  
Ooh coloured crimson in my eyes  
One or two could free my mind  
  
Chorus  
This is how it ends I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
Fading out again I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
So tell me when it kicks in  
So tell me when it kicks in  
  
Verse 2  
Ive been looking for a lover  
Thought Id find her in a bottle  
God make me another one  
Ill be feeling this tomorrow  
Lord forgive me for the things Ive done  
I was never meant to hurt no one  
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover  
  
PreChorus  
Oh no no dont leave me lonely now  
If you loved me howd you never learn  
Ooh coloured crimson in my eyes  
One or two could free my mind  
  
Chorus  
This is how it ends I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
Fading out again I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
So tell me when it kicks in  
So tell me when it kicks in  
  
Bridge x5  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
  
Outro x6  
Tell me when it kicks in  
I saw scars upon her  
Tell me when it kicks in  
Broken hearted
