Ive seen you in black and white  
Like a silent movie  
But your colours came through tonight  
You really threw me  
Wings of desire will carry us to where we want to be  
Wings of desire will keep us flying for eternity  
Im riding on a wave of love too blue to lose me  
I just cant get enough  
You really knew me  
Wings of desire will carry us to where we want to be  
Wings of desire will keep us flying for eternity  
How many times have I told you  
Whenever you ask me why  
How many times can I hold you  
You always know when I try  
We connect without a single word  
Like a book you read me  
One look the message heard  
With you its easy  
Im riding on a wave of love  
And I see you in black and white  
But your colours came through tonight
