Now dis one dedicated to de man dem call MacGyver bo  
And all doubleohseven James Bond man e from de area gunshot gunshot  
Maximum respect to de man dem call Ice Cube bo bo  
And a bust a deucedeuce or treyeight bout to get WICKED  
  
One two three and I come with the wicked  
style and you know that Im from the wicked  
crew act like you knew  
Cause I got everybody jumpin to the voodoo kick it  
Wicked rhymes picket signs  
While me and the Mob gotta trunk fulla 9s  
Play ya and Ill slay ya  
I got thugmade dough by the hair  
Ready to BUCK BUCK BUCK and its a must  
to DUCK DUCK DUCK before I bust  
Lookin for the one that did it  
but like En Vogue no youre never gonna get it  
Cos Im the one with the fat mad skills  
and I wont choke like the Buffalo Bills  
Sittin at the pad just chillin  
cause Larry Wilkins just got two million oh what a feelin  
So shake that nigga and pass me the pill  
and Ill slam dunk ya like Shaquille ONeal  
Like it dig it maybe and watch that ass get   
Kick it cause I get wicked  
  
Wont say nuttin just listen  
Got me a plan to break Tyson outta prison  
Come my way and get served  
Still got a duece thatll bunny hop the curb  
Nappy head nappy chest nappy chin  
Never seen with a happy grin  
Show the fat foul cause Im down  
Take a look around  
and all you see is big black boots steppin  
Use my steel toe as a weapon  
Kick ya and flip ya now they want to  
label this nigga tape with the sticker  
Kickin out girls thats nicety  
Yo I gotta body count like IceT  
From here to New York  
I get skins and aint talkin bout pork  
Swine pig dick  
Listen to the flow of a socalled negro  
who didnt know I was funky as Wilson Pickett  
Dig it cause I get wicked  
  
People wanna know how come  
I gotta gat and Im lookin out the window like Malcolm  
Ready to bring that noise  
Kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys  
April 29th was power to the people  
and we might just see a sequel  
cos police got equal pay  
A horse is a pig that dont fly straight  
Doin Darryl Gates but is Willie Williams  
down with the pilgrims  
Just a super slave  
Well have to break his ass up like Super Dave  
Im wicked enough to board this  
Cos now its on to the fullest  
Gorilla straight from the mist  
But I dont miss when it comes to this  
Bring the yellow tape  
The white cape cause Im so straight  
Thru with the picket signs take his job and stick it  
Bigot cause I get wicked
