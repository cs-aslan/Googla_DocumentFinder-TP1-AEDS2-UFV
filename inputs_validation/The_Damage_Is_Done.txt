Is there a reason  
For things that you say  
The way youre treating me  
All the games I wont play  
Well its too late no longer one  
Dont want you the damage is done  
  
Will you miss me  
When I leave you behind  
Will you tell your friends  
I treated you unkind  
Well its over now and Im on the run  
I dont want you the damage is done  
  
There have been rumors  
That my sense of humor is lacking in some ways  
To me thats no reason its tantamount to treason  
See what the judge has to say  
You need to find someone half as blind  
As I am to your games  
And maybe youll find out what its all about  
And it can drive you insane  
  
Ooh the damage is done  
And now I feel its too late  
The damage is done  
Its over  
Now Im on the run  
And baby you and I know  
The damage is done  
  
I feel its too late  
The damage is done
