A flock of birds hovering above  
Just a flock of birds  
Thats how you think of love  
  
And I always  
Look up to the sky  
Pray before the dawn  
Cause they fly always  
Sometimes they arrive  
Sometimes they are gone  
They fly on  
  
A flock of birds hovering above  
Into smoke Im turned and rise following them up  
  
Still I always  
Look up to the sky pray before the dawn  
Cause they fly away  
One minute they arrive next you know theyre gone  
  
They fly on  
Fly on  
  
So fly on ride through  
Maybe one day Ill fly next to you  
Fly on ride through maybe one day I can fly with you  
Fly on  
Fly on  
Fly on
