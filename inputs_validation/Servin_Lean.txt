Verse 1 Peewee Longway  
I aint neva seen a nigga like me where he at where he from Id like to meet
him  
Im a rolling stone cookin with the rolly on 32 shots in my nina  
Im a rolling stone got my rolly pollie on fuck it not Kafima and Katrina  
Shots of gas bags in the beamer  
Pussy bald head like leukemia  
Watch me set it off like Khadijah  
Stuffing my cigar with the diesel  
Pull up jump off with the Keisha  
See you out dea I need my moneyfa  
Puerto Rican dont need a visa  
Dope white name Mona Lisa  
Frank white head shot Tito  
Longway not Carlito  
Boot up off the molly I dont fuck with the easy hoes  
Porsche 911 got it out the repo  
Trap house naw bitch Im trappin rollin stizzle  
Gas bags I got them bitches going for the lizzo  
Fake shot glass and have them Js at the dizzo  
Im runnin them Im a mob boss calling me Sunny  
Im connected with the pharmist got them pints by the hundreds  
Whole lot of C notes rubberbandin my hunnits  
Still makin drug deals out the trunk of my Honda  
Leanin of a double seal like Im dumber than dumber  
Rollin off a molly pill tryna fuck on your mama  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Verse 2 Peewee Longway  
Im servin you Xanax to lean the neighborhood pharmist Ill serve you coedine  
My bitch she servin up Ps and buy different bags then go by Saline  
She speak different languages but she Portuguese  
She drop in the fishes then whip it up in grease  
My trap house but her name on the lease  
We might get married like Nas and Kelis  
My bad Im trippin Im back on my G  
Mad black the forgies and srt8 the jeep  
Just got an endorsement from servin the lean  
Thanks to extortion Im cleaning the streets  
Double are Royces I roll them in fleets  
My trap house stay rollin Im never off beat  
Im baggin up pounds to a new C Note beat  
Trapper and rapper still strapped with them hammer  
I make the dope dance like Im mc Hammer x2  
Chopin up pharmists Im servin you the grammar  
And lean I get it from over the counter  
Chopin up pharmists with cameras like Tony Montana  
And choppas with clips like bananas  
  
Chorus x2
