There were the trees see the grass a thing gets inspired  
Said This is the place I will try and he did  
Stood in the dark sat a man who beckoned him in  
But leaving his grass was a sin but he did  
  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble its home  
He saw the light in the cellar reflect in his eyes  
Yet early that morning was he to receive a surprise  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble its home  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble its home  
  
Said Are you leaving or are you receiving my friend  
Doesnt need any money till then and he did   
He said Im the ownernot you and this is my stead  
So give it to me now Im dead and he did  said  
  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble its home  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble its home
