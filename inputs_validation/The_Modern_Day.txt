I stand up for my pride  
I dont wanna be just like anyone  
In this world I cannot hide  
I must finish what I have begun  
  
Thats the way I play  
In the modern day  
Cause I wanna stay  
In the modern day  
  
Got a picture in my mind  
Of the way that I wanna be  
So I search until I find  
The power inside of me  
  
Its another phase  
Of the modern day  
  
Gotta face up to this life  
Cant let it get the best of me  
So I make a sacrifice  
If thats the way it has to be  
  
Im doin what I feel is right  
Im ready if I need to fight  
  
In the modern way  
In the modern day  
  
Gotta face up to this life  
Cant let it get the best of me  
If I make a sacrifice  
Thats the way it has to be  
  
Like a motor in overdrive  
I feel good and I feel alive  
I got no need to beg or borrow  
Got a shortcut to tomorrow  
  
And Im on my way  
To the modern day  
Got a lot to say  
In the modern day  
  
Cause I need to stay  
In the modern day  
  
In the modern day
