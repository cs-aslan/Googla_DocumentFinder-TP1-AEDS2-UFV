There is a time when a man needs somebody to talk to  
Someone to talk to somebody wholl always be there  
All alone Nothin seemed to matter  
So alone Doesnt get much better  
Cant explain Something that youre feeling  
For the very first time  
  
There was a time when you needed someone to hold on to  
Someone to hold you somebody whos always sincere  
All alone Suddenly you see her  
So alone You know youre gonna meet her  
Cant explain Something that youre feeling  
For the very first time  
  
Then along comes a woman  
Theres a change in the way  
That youre feeling tonight  
Then along comes a woman  
And you know that its right  
  
There was a time that you needed somebody to count on  
You needed someone to count on somebody to care  
Now shes here Nothin seems to matter  
Shes so near Everything is better  
Cant explain Something that youre feeling  
For the very first time  
  
Then along comes a woman  
Theres a change in the way  
That youre feeling tonight  
Then along comes a woman  
And you know that its right  
And you know that its right  
  
Then along comes a woman  
Theres a change in the air  
That youre breathing tonight  
Then along comes a woman  
And youre holding her tight  
  
Then along comes a woman  
Theres a change in the way  
That youre feeling tonight  
Then along comes a woman  
And you know that its right  
And you know that its right  
  
Then along comes a woman  
Theres a change in the air  
That youre breathing tonight  
Then along comes a woman  
And youre holding her tight
