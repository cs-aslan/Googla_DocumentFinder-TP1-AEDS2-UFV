Verse 1  
  
Is This the end is this all thats left of me  
Tell me when when did I lose touch with reality  
Fading in and out in and out till I lose my mind  
Im so tired of trying tired of trying  
To find something inside to see Im  
  
Chorus  
  
Just an empty shell  
Of my old self  
Can you replace the brokenness with your love  
Can you refill  
My void soul with something thats above myself  
Something just to fill this empty sell  
  
Verse 2  
  
Now I can see this as a new beginning for me  
Empty page to create a new life story yeah  
But I dont know how to begin again  
I fall back on the same old lines  
Ideas cant flow from head to pen  
And it makes me wonder why just why Im  
  
Chorus  
  
Just an empty shell  
Of my old self  
Can you replace the brokenness with your love  
Can you refill  
My void soul with something thats above myself  
Something just to fill  
  
Bridge  
  
Sins of my past have left me Void  
With everything that I myself destroyed  
But I belong to you and you alone  
And I know that you have made me whole  
  
Im not an empty shell of my old self  
Cause youve replaced my brokenness with your love  
Im not an empty shell of my old self  
Cause youve replaced my brokenness with your love  
God youve refilled my void soul  
With something thats above myself  
Something just to fill this empty sell
