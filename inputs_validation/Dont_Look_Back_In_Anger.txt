Slip inside the eye of your mind  
Dont you know you might find  
A better place to play  
You said that youd never been  
But all the things that youve seen  
Will slowly fade away  
  
So I start a revolution from my bed  
Cos you said the brains I had went to my head  
Step outside summertimes in bloom  
Stand up beside the fireplace  
Take that look from off your face  
You aint ever gonna burn my heart out  
  
And so Sally can wait she knows its too late as were walking on by  
Her soul slides away but dont look back in anger I heard you say  
  
Take me to the place where you go  
Where nobody knows if its night or day  
But please dont put your life in the hands  
Of a Rock n Roll band  
Wholl throw it all away  
  
Im gonna start a revolution from my bed  
Cos you said the brains I had went to my head  
Step outside cos summertimes in bloom  
Stand up beside the fireplace  
Take that look from off your face  
Cos you aint ever gonna burn my heart out  
  
So Sally can wait she knows its too late as shes walking on by  
My soul slides away but dont look back in anger I heard you say  
  
So Sally can wait she knows its too late as were walking on by  
Her soul slides away but dont look back in anger I heard you say  
  
So Sally can wait  
She knows its too late as shes walking on by  
My soul slides away  
But dont look back in anger  
Dont look back in anger  
I heard you say  
  
At least not today
