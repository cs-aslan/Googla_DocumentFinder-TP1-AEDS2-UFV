I cannot stop this child from touching me  
I see not fault in watching her bloom  
She knows where fire begins and where sparks might fly  
Yet I feel she may be consumed  
She done turns on the be stage  
She shook hands when the shoe fit  
I wanna know how the land lies  
Ill let you in on a secret  
I did not steal away when love rode by  
I did not let myself be unkind  
Its so heard to say where love meets lust  
I often think Im losing my mind  
I trade notes with the press league  
They send back their suggestions  
I wanna know where I come from  
But all I get are directions  
Chorus  
I cant get started cant get pain  
Whats wrong  
Big ideas the find intentions  
Theyre all gone  
It takes two flagons of courage  
Pounds shillings and pence  
You wind up going nowhere  
It doesnt make sense  
I see my brothers face grow dark with care  
I spend my time avoiding his gaze  
I pray that God might make his dreams come true  
Id give so much to feel hes been saved  
A bright spark in the playground  
Dead loss as an anchor  
You dont call him a misfit  
Hes just stuck for an answer  
Chorus 2
