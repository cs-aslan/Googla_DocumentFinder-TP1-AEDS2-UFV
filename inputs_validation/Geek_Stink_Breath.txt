Im on a mission  
I made my decision  
To lead a path of self destruction  
A slow progression  
Killing my complexion  
And its rotting out my teeth  
  
Im on a roll  
No self control  
Im blowing off steam with methamphetamine  
Dont know what I want  
Thats all that Ive got  
And Im picking scabs off my face  
  
Every hour my blood is turning sour  
And my pulse is beating out of time  
I found a treasure  
filled with sick pleasure  
And it sits on a thick white line  
  
Im on a roll  
No self control  
Im blowing off steam with methamphetamine  
Dont know what I want  
Thats all that Ive got  
And Im picking scabs off my face  
  
Im on a mission  
Ive got no decision  
Like a cripple running the rat race  
Wish in one hand shit in the other  
And see which one gets filled first  
  
Im on a roll  
No self control  
Im blowing off steam with methamphetamine  
Dont know what I want  
Thats all that Ive got  
And Im picking scabs off my face
