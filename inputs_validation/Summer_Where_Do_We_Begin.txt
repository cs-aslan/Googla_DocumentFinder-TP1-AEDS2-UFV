Verse 1  
Phineas Summer is runnin through the sprinklers in your Tshirt shoes and
jeans  
Rolling down a grassy hill yeah thats what summer means to me  
Its true  
Theres so much more to do  
  
Phineas The days are longer  
The nights are shorter  
The sun is shining  
Ferb Its noticeably warmer  
  
Chorus  
Phineas Summer every single moment is worth its weight in gold  
Summer its like the worlds best story and its waiting to be told  
Its ice cream cones and cherry soda dripping down your chin  
Its summer man where do we begin  
  
Verse 2  
Summer is ponds and pools and garden hoses tryin to beat the heat  
Summer bicycles and roller skates and even just bare feet  
Its also Surfing tidal waves creating nanobots  
Or locating Frankensteins brain  
Finding a dodo bird painting a continent  
Or driving our sister insane  
Oh wait Maybe were going too fast  
  
Summer its crickets and cicadas and a glass of lemonade  
Summer its sitting with your brother in the backyard under the shade of a  
Big tree  
Thats what it means to me  
  
The days are longer  
Phineas and 2nd Dimension Phineas The nights are shorter  
The sun is shining  
2nd Dimension Ferb Its noticeably warmer  
  
Phineas Summer every single moment is worth its weight in gold  
Summer its like the worlds best story and its waiting to be told  
Its ice cream cones and cherry soda dripping down your chin  
Its summer man where do we begin  
Its summer man where do we begin  
Its summer man where do we begin  
  
Summer  
Where do we begin  
Summer  
Where do we begin
