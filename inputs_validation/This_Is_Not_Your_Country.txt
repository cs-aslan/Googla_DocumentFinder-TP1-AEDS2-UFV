Road blocks and fire  
Barb wire upon barb wire  
This is not your country  
  
Armoured cars corrugated scars  
Graffiti scrawls  
This is not your country  
  
Home sweet fortress  
Gunshot  we hate your kind  
Get back  
This is not your country  
  
I need some air  
And Im stopped and repeatedly questioned  
Born and braised  
But this is not my country  
  
Were old news  
Alls well  
Say BBC scum  
One child shot but so what  
  
Laid my son  
In a box three feet long  
And I still dont know why  
  
A short walk home becomes a run  
And Im scared  
In my own country  
  
Were old news  
Alls well  
Say BBC scum  
Everybodys under control  
Of our surveillance globes  
  
Were old news  
Alls well  
And thirty years could be a thousand  
And this Peugeot ad  
Spins round in my head  
British soldier pointing a gun  
And Im only trying to post a letter  
A short walk home becomes a run  
And Im scared and Im scared I am scared  
  
Old news  
Alls well  
BBC scum  
  
Youve got more than the dead so zip up your mouth  
Zip up your mouth  
Zip up your mouth  
Zip up your mouth repeated
