Cant you see your love is all I need  
Without you Im nothing so please dont ever leave  
  
Baby I think you should take the time alone  
To sort out your feelings and be sure youre not going wrong no  
You see I know you hear many things that make you cry  
But our love is too strong to be ruined by a lie  
Cant you see your love is all I need  
Without you Im nothing so please dont ever leave  
  
Now tell me how I could ever live without you  
I cant live without you  
If you left me now I dont know what I would do  
Ive never known anyone who could love me like you do  
You mean the world to me and I feel I mean as much to you  
  
Cant you see your love is all I need  
Without you Im nothing so please dont ever leave  
  
Ive never known anyone who could love me like you do  
You mean the world to me and I feel I mean as much to you  
  
Cant you see your love is all I need  
Without you Im nothing so please dont ever leave  
Cant you see your love is all I need  
Without you Im nothing so please dont ever leave  
  
No I just cant live without you  
Cant live without your love  
So baby please dont leave  
You should take some time to realise  
Youre the only one Im thinking of  
Baby please dont leave  
Thought our love was too strong to fall  
I need you baby so please dont go
