I remember walking through flowers  
In a garden of a memry Im thinkin of  
I remember being in heaven  
Some other place some other time some other love  
I remember walking on silver sand  
With a mid summer moon shining above  
And I remember the taste of her sweet lips  
Some other place some other time some other love  
I remember holding her close to me  
And I can picture the nights we shared alone  
When Im dreaming it all seems so real to me  
Then I wake up and find its all done  
Tomorrow I may be holding another girl  
But tonight shes not the one Im thinkin of  
Could it be my life would just be a memry  
Of some other place some other time some other love  
Of some other place some other time some other love  
Of some other place some other time some other love
