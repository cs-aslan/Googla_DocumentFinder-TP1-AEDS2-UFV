Im the writer got a front page cover  
Hot gossip bout whos with their latest lover  
I write all chapters by the second scene  
I call the shots dont need a Fleet Street team  
I am a writer and Im the news  
You cross me you know youre gonna lose  
Ill do the story if youre dead or alive  
If seconds out or if youre gonna take a dive  
Slip out the news or a piece of scandal  
Dont toe the line cause nothings too hot to handle  
I am the writer and Im the news  
If you cross me you know youre gonna lose  
Yeah youre gonna lose  
  
I am a writer and I am the news  
If you cross me you know youre gonna lose  
And where you are its because of me  
Cause overnight you know it dont come free  
Ill put you up there or Ill bring you down  
Cause nothing moves without me in this town  
I am a writer and I am the news  
If you cross me you know youre gonna lose  
Boy youre gonna lose I said youre gonna lose  
I write the news I am the news  
Got to got to lose  
Oh yeah youre gonna lose  
So dont step on my blue suede shoes
