You want me to be your friend  
Stick by you through thick or thin  
  
Whats in it for me  
Whats in it for me  
  
Youd like me to deal you in  
Hold your hand right to the end  
  
Whats in it for me  
Whats in it for me  
  
You want me to be your friend  
You want me and you want him  
This aint for me  
This aint for me  
  
You want someone you can trust  
You want love  you dont want much  
  
Whats in it for me  
Whats in it for me  
  
You want my name on the line  
I dont feel that way inclined  
  
Whats in it for me  
Whats in it for me  
  
You want me to be your friend  
You want me and you want him  
This aint for me  
This aint for me
