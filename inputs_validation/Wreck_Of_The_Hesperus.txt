Im not the wreck of the Hesperus  
Feel more like the Wall of China  
Getting old as Methuselah  
Feel tall as the Eiffel Tower  
Im not a power of attorney  
But I can rock as good as Gibraltar  
Aint no more no spring chicken  
Been plucked but Im still kicking  
But its alright its alright  
  
Poison penmen sneak have no nerve to speak  
Make up lies then they leak m out  
Behind a pseudonym the rottenness in them  
Reaching out trying to touch me  
  
Met some Oscars and Tonys  
I slipped on a pavement oyster  
Met a snake climbing ladders  
Got out of the line of fire  
But its alright  
  
Brainless writers gossip nonsenses  
To others heads as dense as they is  
Its the same old malady  
What they see is faulty  
  
Im not the wreck of the Hesperus  
Feel more like Big Bill Broonzy  
Getting old as my mother  
But I tell you I got some company  
But its alright  
  
But its alright its alright  
But its alright its alright  
Its alright alright  
Its alright
