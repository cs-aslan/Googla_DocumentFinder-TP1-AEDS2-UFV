They tell me little darlin  
That to morrow youll be wed  
You thought that you would hurt me  
But you hurt yourself instead  
  
Ill always be the same old pal  
Just as in years gone by  
Ill just set back and watch you  
While you set alone and cry  
  
Chorus  
Tears fallin down your pretty cheeks  
Tears you cannot hide and tears you cannot keep  
They are tears of sorrow and tears of delight  
I wish I had a nickel for every tear you shed last night  
  
I just dropped by to tell you that I wish you happiness  
I hope that youll forgive me for intruding like this  
I hope my dear your happiness will follow through the years  
Ill just set back and watch you while you shed those bitter tears  
  
Chorus
