Greensboro woman dont you smile on me  
I do not feel like being comforted  
and anyway Ill be home soon  
for once is someone waitin there  
and if you dont mind  
I just think on her instead  
  
Your face shes a picture babe  
pictures aint what I crave  
I dont feel this way most generally  
I just pit a thousand miles tween me  
and where my thoughts do lie  
and I thank you kindly baby to kindly let me be  
  
Your car shes smooth and fast  
babe your bourbons fine  
but I aint feelin free and clear today  
Texas loving laying on my mind  
I couldnt do you right babe spinnin round this way  
  
Greensboro woman dont you smile on me  
I do not feel like being comforted  
and anyway Ill be home soon  
for once is someone waitin there  
and if you dont mind  
I just think on her instead
