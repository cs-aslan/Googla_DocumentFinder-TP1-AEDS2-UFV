We close our eyes  
We close our eyes and dream and the world has turned around again  
  
When everybody is running in the big race  
And having a good time  
Who am I to cast a shadow  
Who am I  
I looked Death in the face last night  
I saw him in a mirror  
And he simply smiled  
He told me not to worry  
He told me just to take my time  
  
Chorus  
We close our eyes and the world has turned around again  
We close our eyes and dream and another year has come and gone  
We close our eyes and the world has turned around again  
We close our eyes and dream   
  
And if you come to me  
And if you touch my hand  
I might just slip away  
I might just disappear  
Who am I  
And if you think Im worth it  
And if you think its not too late  
We might start falling  
If we dont try to hard  
We might start falling in love  
  
Chorus  
  
Were on the healing path  
Were on a roller coaster ride  
That could never turn back  
And if you love me  
And if you really try  
To make the seconds count  
Then we can close our eyes  
  
chorus  
  
We close our eyes and the world has turned around again
