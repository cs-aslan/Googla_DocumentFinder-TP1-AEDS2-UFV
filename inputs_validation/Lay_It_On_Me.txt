Dont you drink with me cause you know that Im a loser  
And Im proud of that fact as you can plainly see  
Never did what people said I shouldve  
Im just a low down critter who never did any good  
Im just a low down critter who never did any good  
  
I spend my life working up a sweat to be a bad boy  
Getting girls into trouble every day  
Going from town to town  
Now I tell you Ive been around  
Im just a low down critter who never did any good  
Im just a low down critter who never did any good  
  
Lay it on me yeah  
Dont you drink with me cause I tell you that Im a loser  
And Im proud of that fact as you can plainly see  
Going from town to town Now I tell you Ive been around  
Im just a low down critter who never did any good  
Im just a low down critter who never did any good
