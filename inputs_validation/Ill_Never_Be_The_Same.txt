Ill never be the same  
Stars have lost their meaning for me  
Ill never be the same  
Nothings what it once used to be  
  
And when the song birds that sing  
Tell me its spring I cant believe their song  
Once love was king  
But king can be wrong yes  
  
Ill never be the same  
There is such an ache in my heart  
Never be the same  
Since were apart  
  
Cause theres such a lot a smile can hide  
I know down deep inside  
Ill never be the same  
Never be the same again  
  
And when the song birds that sing  
Tell me its spring I cant believe their song  
Once love was king  
But kings can be wrong oh yes  
  
Ill never be the same  
There is such an ache in my heart  
Never be the same  
Since were apart  
  
Though theres such a lot a smile can hide  
I know down deep inside yes  
Ill never be the same  
Never be the same again
