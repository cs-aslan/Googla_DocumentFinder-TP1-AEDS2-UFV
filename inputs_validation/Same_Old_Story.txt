Born to open for mankind natures door  
A life known by a few  
And those who knew that shared  
Their knowledge fewer cared about what plants could do  
For most felt it was mad to conceive  
That plants thought felt and moved quite like we  
But with instruments Bose would devise  
Would take science itself by a surprise so  
On we go to where who knows  
To a place where theres still nonbelievers  
What will it take for heaven sakes  
For those who find whats real too hard to believe in  
Its that same old story again  
Born of slaves who died too soon to realize  
The need his life would be  
Selflessly he gave  
His wisdom to a way where first no minds would see  
He said If farm land was to be rich  
We must plant crops to replenish it  
But it took him persuasion and tests  
To convince them Canvers way was best so  
On we go to where who knows  
To a place where theres still nonbelievers  
What will it take for heaven sakes  
For those who find whats real too hard to believe in  
Its that same old story again
