Paris rooftops were lovely to see  
Switzerlands vertical landscape  
Crossed my minds eye just now  
Canadas shoreline has been calling out to me  
But its been too long a time  
Since last I crossed  
That vast nantucket sound  
Refrain  
Hello old friend  
Welcome me home again  
Well Ive been away  
But thats all over now  
Say I can stay for October now  
Stay a while and play  
Little dog david  
I must look like a fool  
I shouldve remembered  
Youd be forgetting my smell well  
Give me a week or two to recapture my cool  
Ive got stories to tell  
About how I snatched the devils catch  
And out ran the hounds of hell  
Refrain
