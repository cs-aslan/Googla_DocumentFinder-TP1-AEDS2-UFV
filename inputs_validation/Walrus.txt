Hey  
  
Well I read the news today  
And the walrus said the lucky man made the grade yea  
Well aint that great  
You say  
Well about the rest of that news left me empty and mad  
Singing the blues yeah  
Its sad but true  
  
cause  
Everything gets old everyone is dumb  
So I keep changing  
Everything is gay everyone is fake  
So I cant hang around  
  
SiSiSitting back look with on your face  
Like Im a piece of crap  
And youre a fucking ace well  
Its time to go  
You know  
Hit the road jack  
Like the song goes you aint ever coming back  
Because the world turned black  
Well dont you know  
  
cause  
Everything gets old everyone is dumb  
So I keep changing  
Everything is gay everyone is fake  
So I cant hang around  
  
Oh oh  
  
Well dont you know  
Everything gets old everyone is dumb  
So I keep changing  
Everything is gay everyone is fake  
So I cant hang around  
Everything gets old everyone is dumb  
So I keep changing  
Every word they say  
Every word is fake  
  
So I wont be around  
  
Everything gets old everyone is dumb  
Everything gets old everyone is dumb  
Everything gets old everyone is dumb
