Broke the Breadline Nobody Knows  
I walked the frontline Still got far to go  
I mixed the water I drank the water  
I broke the breadline Dont wanna know  
  
Its staring me down Wearing a crown of apathy  
Im standing around Dressed like a clown  
Dont know my name You know where to find me  
  
I killed the manchild Ill fast alone  
I had the midwife Naked and alone  
I mixed the water I drank the water  
I killed the brainchild Ill fast alone  
  
Its staring me down  
  
Dont wanna let me be a man  
Dont wanna lead me to your home  
  
Its staring me down  
  
I killed the manchild  
I had the midwife  
I drank the water  
I stand alone  
  
I broke the breadline  
I walked the frontline  
Dont know my name You know where to find me  
  
Dont wanna let me be a man  
Dont wanna lead me to your home
