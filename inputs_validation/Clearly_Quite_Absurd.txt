After all we said today  
The strangest thought occurred  
I feel I ought to tell you  
But its clearly quite absurd  
  
Wouldnt it be wonderful  
If you could read my mind  
Imagine all the stuff  
That we could leave behind  
  
How many words you waste  
Before youre understood  
Or simply sow some seeds  
Youd do it if you could  
  
Let me take a moment  
Of your time  
Inside you mind  
  
I know what youre thinking  
But I dont know what to say  
The turmoil and the conflict  
You dont have to feel that way  
  
Look into my eyes  
And feel my hand upon your heart  
Holding us together  
Not tearing us apart  
  
How many words we waste  
To justify a crime  
Compare it to an act of love  
That really takes no time  
  
Why not take a moment  
Of your time  
Inside your mind
