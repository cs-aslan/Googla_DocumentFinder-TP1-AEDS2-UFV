Out there are silver dressed darlings  
And ramen mein delights  
When ginger hair gets all fired up  
She beats them in the night  
That redhead walking uh  
  
Dont get close  
Shell warn you with her growl  
Shes a bud cuttin star studded leather chested girl  
Out there a redhead walkin  
Redhead walkin  
The redhead walkin  
Better listen keep your distance from the crimson crime warpath  
  
O kiss that girl  
Kiss that girl  
Kiss that girt  
  
Yeah shell cut your heart like diamonds  
End of story  
You bet youre gonna lose it to that hellbound crimson glory  
  
There  a redhead walkin  
A redhead walkin  
A redhead walkin  
Heed what this wise man says  
Keep away from redheads
