Got a kiss on the neck from a mornin cartoon  
Pullin out the knot I just cant lose  
Grabbin my shoulder turned out the night  
Like a smile after youve cried  
  
The lady out walkin with her popcorn pup  
To get out and smoke before her husband wakes up  
Eyes to the asphalt plastic bag hands  
Just get on outta there just get away from that man  
  
Well Im all thumbs and toes  
With the way that it comes and the way that it goes  
  
Get up get up  
I gotta loosen this load  
Get up get up  
Get some fire in my throat  
Get up get up  
  
See the man in the corner tryin to make em all smile  
And missin the one who matters all the while  
And shell beat him senseless but he just cant see  
It aint for the crowd that you bleed  
  
So be good to your barkeep man  
Its more than yer drink hes got his hand  
Can see that your nervous and it shits him to tears  
Yeah he just dont want to wait and he dont care about your band  
  
Well Im all thumbs and toes  
With the way that it comes and the way that it goes  
  
Get up get up  
I gotta loosen this load  
Get up get up  
And put some fire in my throat  
Get up get up  
  
I need a life dedicated  
Not this endless parading  
Help me alright  
  
Get up get up  
Yeah I gotta loosen this load  
Get up get up  
And get some fire in my throat  
Get up get up  
  
I want a life dedicated  
Not this endless parading  
Help me alright  
  
I need to do more but I aint been sleeping  
For the longest time  
For the longest time  
For the longest time  
  
If I could live for one day without being sorry I know  
One day without being sorry I know  
One day without being sorry I know  
One day without being sorry
