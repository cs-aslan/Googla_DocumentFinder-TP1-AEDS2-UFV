Growin up in a biosphere  
With no respect for bad weather  
Theres still roaches and ants in here  
So resourceful and clever  
Her great grandfather saw the future  
Didnt know nothing bout panic  
He certainly probably thought  
That it was unthinkable  
Theres a trace oh mint wafting in from the north  
So we dont fuck with the 401  
Its bigger than us or larger than we bargained  
I guess its just not done  
His great grandfather worked for Goodyear  
Hed see the blimp on Sundays  
Wonder what the driver knew  
About making rubber tires  
Terrarium  
Oh Terrarium  
Theres submarines out there under the ice  
Avoiding and courting collision  
An accidents sometimes the only way  
To worm our way back to bad decisions  
My great grandfather was a welder  
He helped to build the Titanic  
He didnt certainly think  
That it is was unsinkable  
Building up to the larger point  
With an arrogance not rare or pretty  
We dont declare the war on idleness  
When outside its cold and shitty  
We stay inside and try to conjure  
The fathers of the injured and faking  
If theres glory in miracles  
Its that theyre reversible  
Terrarium  
Oh terrarium
