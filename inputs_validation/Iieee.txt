With your Es  
And your ease  
And I do much more  
Need a lip gloss boost  
In your America  
Is it Gods  
Is it yours  
Sweet saliva  
With your Es  
And your ease  
And I do one more  
I know were dying  
And theres no sign of a parachute  
We scream in cathedrals  
Why cant it be beautiful  
Why does there gotta be a sacrifice  
  
Just say yes  
You little arsonist  
Youre so sure you can save  
Every hair on my chest  
Just say yes  
You little arsonist  
With your Es  
And your ease  
And I do one more  
  
Well I know were dying  
And theres no sign of a parachute  
In this chapel little chapel of love  
Cant we get a little grace  
And some elegance  
No we scream in cathedrals  
Why cant it be beautiful  
Why does there gotta be a sacrifice
