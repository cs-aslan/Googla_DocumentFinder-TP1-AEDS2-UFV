There is a spider in my dreams  
long and silent is his name  
cold as lightning is his smile  
final is his sting  
  
His curse is deep as seven skies  
boys I wouldnt tell you lies  
the legends say he never sleeps  
hes never hungry long  
  
Hes got us boys I believe its true  
but Im fighting till he lays me down  
run his foul black body through  
cleave him all asunder  
  
Think your women wont you boys  
think your mother growing old  
think about your darling son  
spittin the spiders eye  
  
Up at ease against him ride  
well not take him by surprise  
give a scream down in your dreams  
let him know were comin  
  
There is a spider in my dreams  
long and silent is his name  
cold as lightning is his smile  
final is his sting
