So your friends been telling me  
Youve been sleeping with my sweater  
And that you cant stop missing me  
Bet my friends been telling you  
Im not doing much better  
Cause Im missing half of me  
  
And being here without you is like Im waking up to  
  
Only half a blue sky  
Kinda there but not quite  
Im walking around with just one shoe  
Im half a heart without you  
Im half a man at best  
With half an arrow in my chest  
I miss everything we do  
Im half a heart without you  
  
Forget all we said that night  
No it doesnt even matter  
Cause we both got split in two  
If you could spare an hour or so  
Well go for lunch down by the river  
We can really talk it through  
  
And being here without you is like Im waking up to  
  
Only half a blue sky  
Kinda there but not quite  
Im walking around with just one shoe  
Im half a heart without you  
Im half a man at best  
With half an arrow in my chest  
Cause I miss everything we do  
Im half a heart without you  
  
Half a heart without you  
Im half a heart without you  
  
Though I try to get you out of my head  
The truth is I got lost without you  
And since then Ive been waking up to  
  
Only half a blue sky  
Kinda there but not quite  
Im walking around with just one shoe  
Im half a heart without you  
Im half a man at best  
With half an arrow in my chest  
I miss everything we do  
Im half a heart without you  
  
Without you without you half a heart without you  
Without you without you Im half a heart without you
