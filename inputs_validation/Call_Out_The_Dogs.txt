Here am I  
Like a target in flesh  
One more time  
For you to call out the dogs  
Passengers  
With a ticket to burn and burn and burn  
You will learn  
Im still waiting for you you know  
  
Im a slogan an old story  
A disease never again  
I dont like this new anger  
These young boys just make me laugh  
This picture Im so nervous  
The DJ says who are you  
Look at me Im shaking  
I dont know if I can move  
  
I dont need  
This attention again  
Ive lost time  
I could lose everything  
You will learn  
That youve nowhere to go so go
