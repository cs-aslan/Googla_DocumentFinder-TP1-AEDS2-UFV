Win Toronto yelled the Queen of the Furrows  
This is how we farm hens cluck and roosters crow  
You are my heart staring down from the bureau  
To be apart is that why you have to go  
  
To Conversation City everybodys talking  
You must have something to say  
Conversation City making conversation  
Working at it night and day  
  
Watch yourself I say to my Toasted Western  
This is how I feel and its when I learn the most  
You are my heart youre my Queen of the Furrows  
This is how I feel hens cluck and roosters crow  
  
Im in the night fields  
Everything dark yellow  
Im making my way by feel  
By my neighbors glow  
  
You are my heart oh my Queen of the Furrows  
This is how I farm eyes up and ears down low  
You are my heart youre my Queen of the Furrows  
This how I feel hens cluck and roosters crow  
  
This is how I feel  
  
But in Conversation City everybodys talking  
You must have something to say  
Conversation City making conversation  
Working at it night and day  
  
You are my heart oh my Queen of the Furrows  
This is how I farm eyes up and ears down low  
You are my heart youre my Queen of the Furrows  
This how I feel hens cluck and roosters crow  
  
You are my heart this is how I feel  
This is how I feel
