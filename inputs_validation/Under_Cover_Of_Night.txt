Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
  
Truth is youve been waiting so long  
Youre ripe and so insane  
Can the tentacles of your mind stop the pain  
  
How long will you sit there wondering  
Whats happening to your heart  
Cant you fell the love surround you  Thats a start  
  
Chorus  
Ill take to the road in a little while  
Under cover of night  
You come or you stay  
Whatever seems right  
  
I aint looking for friends or lovers  
Aint looking for a pot of gold  
Had it all when I was younger  It got old  
  
Who will leave this world of sorrow  
Who will die to all the fears  
Kowning Ill be gone tommorow  Gone for years  
  
Chorus  
  
Somewhere the suns just rising  
And the road comes in to view  
Theres a wanderer freed from dying  Could be you  
  
Who will pay the price for freedom  
Learn the disciplines of the road  
Many tried but few succeed  So Im told
