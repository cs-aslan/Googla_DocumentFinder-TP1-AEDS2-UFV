Twenty four hours ago  
No one could help me  
Im alone in life  
No where to go  
  
So I picked up the phone  
Called out for help  
Some one please help me  
Im afraid and alone  
  
Weasel face  
Weasel face  
Weasel face  
  
Its way past midnight  
TV set is on  
Its my only friend  
One crisis after another  
  
Aint no loser or quitter  
Its all or nothing baby  
Cause we fought so hard  
For our piece of this world  
  
Weasel face  
Weasel face  
Weasel face
