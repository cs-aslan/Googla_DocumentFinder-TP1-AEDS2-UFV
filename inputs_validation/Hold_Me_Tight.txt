I dont want to hear it no more fussin and a fightin baby hold me tight  
Just let bygones be bygones lets think about tomorrow our futures bright  
I know I was wrong I was just a fool too blind to see you were the only one
for me  
But now I see the light and everythings gonna be alright baby hold me tight  
 Pa pa pa pa pa pa   
I know I was wrong I was just a fool too blind to see  
 Pa pa pa pa pa pa
