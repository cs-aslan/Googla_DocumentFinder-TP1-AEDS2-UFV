You were the apple of the publics eye as you cut the ribbon at the local mall  
A mirage for both you and us How can it be real  
We love your body in that photograph your home state sure must be proud  
The queen of the United States or have you lost your crown  
  
Well arent you Miss America  
Dont you Miss America  
Wont you Miss America  
Our love  
  
Well are you really who we think you are  
Or does that smile seem to wear you down  
This girl who you once were is screaming jump out  
This dream that you must live a disease for which there is no cure  
This roller coaster ride youre on wont stop to let you off  
  
Well arent you Miss America  
Dont you Miss America  
Wont you Miss America  
Our love  
  
Miss America Miss America  
Miss America Miss America  
  
Well its true just take a look  
The cover sometimes makes the book  
And the judges do they ever ask to read between your lines  
And in your cage at the human zoo they all stop to look at you  
Next year what will you do when you have been forgotten  
  
Well arent you Miss America  
Dont you Miss America  
Wont you Miss America  
Our love
