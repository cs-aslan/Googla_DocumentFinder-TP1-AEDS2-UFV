Your picture of yourself is a media myth  
Underneath this floor were on the edge of a cliff  
Someone told me Jesus was the Devils lover  
While we masturbated on a magazine cover  
Chorus  
Dead in the streets  
Whos that girl  
Ireland screams  
Africa burns  
Suburbia stumbles  
The tides are turned  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western  
The Western world  
Mamas still on valium Daddy puts the news on  
TV orphans laugh at the confusion  
The audience finds itself on the stage  
Fifty million people in a state of decay  
Chorus  
The party goes on behind elevator doors  
While the elevator plummets from the 69th floor  
All the cars lost in the scrapyards of paradise  
The newspaper photographs have all come alive  
Chorus  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western  
The Western world
