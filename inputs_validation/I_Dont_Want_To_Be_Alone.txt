My nerves are shot the coffees cold  
Wish that I could be so bold as to  
Walk right up to you and say what I think  
I dont now what you think  
Of me  
And I know everyone can see Im crazy  
About you and always will be  
  
Wheres womens lib when you need it the most  
Or was it mama who said  
Youre not suppose to flaunt yourself like that  
As if theres no in between  
Or maybe its not that Im afraid its just that the last move I made  
Embarrassed me to death and made me want to hide  
  
So if youve ever been embarrassed before meet me half way  
And Ill know for sure  
At least  
Well still be friends if I mess up again  
Cause it aint easy meeting  
Someone new  
Especially when that someone is you  
It aint easy by being by yourself  
Its no fun to be alone  
And I dont want to be alone  
Cause it aint easy meeting someone new  
Especially when that someone is  
You  
It aint easy by being by yourself  
Its no fun to be alone  
And I dont want to be alone  
  
My nerves are shot the coffees cold  
Wish that I could be so bold as to walk  
Right up to you and say what I think
