Its not a question of love  
Cause our love has never changed  
But all the little things keep piling up  
And life keeps getting in the way  
  
Dont make this harder than it is  
We both knew itd come to this  
Better now than in a year  
With lots of tears  
And we both hate each other  
The fuse has already left  
So how about a final kiss  
And just let it go  
  
Stop the madness  
Before it explodes  
Before its out of our control  
Lets stop the madness  
Before it explodes  
We gotta let it go  
Before it all explodes  
  
Some things we wont understand  
And were both so tired of being misunderstood  
So lets just turn and walk away  
And hold on to what was good  
  
Dont make this harder than it is  
We both knew itd come to this  
Better now than in a year  
With lots of tears  
And we both hate eachother  
The fuse has already left  
So how about a final kiss  
And just let it go  
  
Stop the madness  
Before it explodes  
Before its out of our control  
Lets stop the madness  
Before it explodes  
We gotta let it go  
Before it all explodes  
  
Before it explodes  
Before its out of our control  
Lets stop the madness  
Before it explodes  
We gotta let it go  
Before it all explodes
