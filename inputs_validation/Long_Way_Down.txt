Its a long way down  
Above the two tone town  
And its no funny when youre stuck in the middle  
Im coming up for air  
I could be anywhere  
It makes no difference when you live in a puddle  
Now that I see it  
How can I breath  
When my hearts in my mouth  
And not on my sleeve  
Better run little rabbit  
Back to your hole in the ground  
Its a long way down  
Its a long way down  
The people look so small  
Sliding off the wall  
Getting dizzy as the fall in the gutter  
I watch the seagull  
Swooping past the steeple  
Crying for his dinner as he shits on the sinners  
Now that I see it  
How can I breathe  
When my hearts in my mouth  
Instead of my sleeve  
Better run little rabbit  
Back to your hole in the ground  
Its a long way down  
Mama  
An eye for an eye  
Youd say youd never take a side  
Papa  
Im too young to die  
Theyre never taking me  
Theyre never taking me alive  
Theyre never taking me alive  
Theyre never taking me alive
