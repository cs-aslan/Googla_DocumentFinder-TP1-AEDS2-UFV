Weird goingson at the county jail  
Prisoners reading the sheriffs mail  
Hes strapped down to a swivel chair  
Trying to swivel right out of there  
Pinstriped sweets in cell 15  
Convinced his self its all a dream  
Hes got a pet black tabby cat  
That carries a gun and wears a stetson hat  
The door flies open in strides geek  
Looking like the front page of newsweek  
He says to lou in a voice of glee  
whats the matter aint you glad to see me   
Lous on the floor cause he cant stand up  
As green as a leaf in a teacup  
When on to geeks back jumps a stetsonhatted cat  
Which breaks geeks neck like he was a rat  
Long gone geek
