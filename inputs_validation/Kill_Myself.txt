Im gonna clean the house  
Im gonna fix the fence  
With my final hours  
Im gonna tie up these loose ends  
I wont leave a note for anyone to find  
Tomorrow theyll know what Ive done here tonight  
  
The drastic steps Ive taken  
Are just an act of desperation  
I knew no one would miss me so what the hell  
I fought and lied I drank too much  
Hurt everyone Ive ever touched  
And just how much Ive hurt you its hard to tell  
This is not some cry for help  
Its goodbye I wish you well  
Because I love you Im gonna kill myself  
  
Now who is that in my easy chair  
Now wait a minute thats the old me sitting there  
And I thank God the devil in me died  
Cause I stand before you now a man changed and alive  
  
The drastic steps Ive taken  
Are just an act of desperation  
I knew no one would miss me so what the hell  
I fought and lied I drank too much  
Hurt everyone Ive ever touched  
And just how much Ive hurt you its hard to tell  
This is not some cry for help  
Its goodbye I wish you well  
Because I love you I had to kill myself  
  
Im gonna clean the house  
Im gonna fix that fence  
In my final hours Im gonna tie up these loose ends
