Would you love me tomorrow  
Like you say you love me now  
Would you love me would you love me tomorrow  
Like you say you love me now  
When the flames of our flesh have stopped burning  
  
And the fire of our love has cooled down  
Too many times Ive given too much  
Baby give me your love to me in return  
Too many times Ive given too much  
  
Baby give me your love in return  
Give me your mind and your heart  
But please dont leave me with a love that burns  
And dont use me as your fool  
  
Cause my heart cant stand another lie  
Please dont use me dont use me as your fool  
Baby cause my heart cant stand another lie  
And if you cant love me tomorrow  
Please leave me now in my room to cry
