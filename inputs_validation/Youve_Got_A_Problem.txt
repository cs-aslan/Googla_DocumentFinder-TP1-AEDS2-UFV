so whats the problem this time  
I thought youd learn by now that nothing ever works out right  
you want to take away the edge  
you tell me its the only thing that helps you forget  
youve made your promises  
thats not enough this time  
theres only so much you can squander from a feeble mind  
  
youve got a problem with your life  
youve got a problem with your mind  
  
dont try to tell me that you think its going to work out fine  
so go ahead and try to hide  
the world around you watches on as you destroy you life  
do what your problem says  
theres not a lot of time  
theres only so much you can squander from a feeble mind  
  
youve got a problem with your life
