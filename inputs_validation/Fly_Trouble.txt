Did you ever sit straight up in bed  
With somethin a circlin round ya head  
An ya swat at it as it wizzes by  
And its just one pesky little fly  
  
You shake ya head an twitch ya nose  
And settle down to sweep ya floors  
And when ya just about to dose fly trouble  
  
Buzz buzz buzz goes that busy little fly  
Buzz buzz buzz hes takin off an hide  
  
You roll the paper up nice and tight  
And wait around for him to light  
But theirs a fly thats a liven right  
Buzz buzz buzz  
  
Now the toughest hide grows on a mule  
Cause hes a bulky stubborn fool  
He likes to look at you and glare  
An never even move a hair  
  
But when his muscles start to twitch  
An when his tail begins to swish  
That mule aint bothered with an itchfly trouble  
  
chorusbuzz buzz buzz goes that busy little pest  
buzz buzz buzz that mule cant get no rest  
  
He shakes his head an bats his eye  
An kicks his heels up to the sky  
Did you ever see a jass ack cry  
Buzz buzz buzz  
  
Now you pick a perfect night in June  
When flowers are bloomin beneath the moon  
And ya light of love is shinin bright  
An you tell ya self tonights the night  
  
Ya brace ya self an ya courage grows  
An on ya knees where you would propose  
When somethin bights you on the nose fly trouble  
  
Buzz buzz buzz goes that busy little thing  
Buzz buzz buzz you swat an loose the ring  
  
You fan the air as he goes by  
An stick ya finger in your eye  
Hit everything except that fly  
Buzz buzz buzz
