I gave up the fight for love whoa oh oh  
Walked away to calm for gloves  
No more wishing on a star  
Waiting for someone whoa  
What if no one ever comes  
  
So I kept my eyes closed hands up dancing by myself  
Oh I never felt nothing better  
Baby how could I know youd come crashing down from Heaven  
Now my heart is open forever  
  
I dont have to sleep to dream  
I can hardly believe what I see  
When you stand before me  
Youre everything I never thought  
That I would ever find  
Now I dont have to sleep to dream  
Youre a dream to me  
  
Theres a cure for bleeding hearts whoa  
Think you showed me where to start  
Every time I lose my grip  
You keep me hangin on whoa oh oh  
You remind that Im strong  
  
So I kept my eyes closed hands up dancing by myself  
Oh I never felt nothing better  
Baby how could I know youd come crashing down from Heaven  
Now my heart is open forever  
  
I dont have to sleep to dream  
I can hardly believe what I see  
When you stand before me  
Youre everything I never thought  
That I would ever find  
Now I dont have to sleep to dream  
Youre a dream  
  
I dont have to sleep to dream  
I can hardly believe what I see  
When you stand before me  
Youre everything I never thought  
That I would ever find  
Now I dont have to sleep to dream  
Youre a dream to me  
  
Youre a dream  
  
I dont have to sleep to dream  
I can hardly believe what I see  
When you stand before me  
Youre everything I never thought  
That I would ever find  
Now I dont have to sleep to dream  
Youre a dream dream  
Youre a dream to me
