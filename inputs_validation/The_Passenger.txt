I am a passenger  
And I ride and I ride  
Ride through the citys back sides  
See stars come out of the sky  
Yeah the bright and hollow sky  
You know it looks so good tonight  
I am a passenger  
I stay under glass  
I look through my window so bright  
See the stars come out tonight  
I see the bright and hollow sky  
Over the citys red back side  
And everything looks good tonight  
  
Sing it  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la  
  
Get into the car  
Well be the passengers  
Well ride through the city at night  
See the citys red back side  
See the bright and hollow sky  
See the stars that shine so bright  
The stars made for us tonight  
  
Oh the passenger  
How how he rides  
Oh the passenger  
He rides and he rides  
Looks through his window  
What does he see  
Sees the bright and hollow sky  
Sees the stars come out tonight  
Sees the citys red back side  
Sees the winding ocean drive  
And everything was made for you and me  
All of it was made for you and me  
It just belongs to you and me  
So lets take a ride  
See whats mine  
  
Sing it  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la  
  
Sing it  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la
