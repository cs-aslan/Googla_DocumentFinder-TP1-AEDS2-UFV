I cant help myself  
Im addicted to a life  
Of furretrial  
Its some kind of joke  
Im obsessively opposed to the  
Canine  
  
All we care about is  
Garbage cans kitty beds and fishy foods  
Give me something I wannabe  
Feline Hollywood yes we live for the  
  
Cats doin it for the cats  
Cause we wanna live the life  
Of the spoilt and lazy  
Cats doin it for the cats  
Cause we gotta taste for fishy treats  
And endless spoiling  
  
Cats cats baby  
The cats cats  
We live for the cats cats baby  
The cats cats  
Isnt it a shame shame baby  
A shame shame  
In it for the cats cats baby  
The cats cats  
  
Cats
