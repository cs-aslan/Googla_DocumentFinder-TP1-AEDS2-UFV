Im better off without you  
Im better off you know  
Were nothing more than strangers  
With nowhere else to go  
But like a fool Ill stay by your side  
Knowing that you wont believe me  
When I say Ive tried  
A heart will break tonight  
Make no mistake Ill lie awake tonight  
A heart will break and I wont feel the same  
cause you stay just the same as you are  
And a heart will break tonight  
We made no commitment  
We made only words  
Its no consolation that were free like the birds  
cause who needs to fly like they do  
Theres only one reason Im staying  
Its cause I love youi do  
A heart will break tonight  
Make no mistake Ill lie awake tonight  
A heart will break and I wont feel the same  
cause you stay just the same as you are  
And a heart will break tonight  
A heart will break tonight  
Make no mistake Ill lie awake tonight  
A heart will break and I wont feel the same  
cause you stay just the same as you are  
And a heart will break tonight  
Tonight its gonna break  
Dont know if Ill make it  
Through the nightoh oh oh oh
