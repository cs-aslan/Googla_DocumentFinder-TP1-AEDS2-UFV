Cant ever get it right  
No matter how hard I try  
And Ive tried  
Well I put up a good fight  
But your words cut like knives  
And Im tired  
As you break my heart again this time  
  
Tell me Im a screwed up mess  
That I never listen listen  
Tell me you dont want my kiss  
That you need your distance distance  
Tell me anything but dont you say hes what youre missing baby  
If hes the reason that youre leaving me tonight  
Spare me what you think and  
Tell me a lie  
  
Well youre the charming type  
That little twinkle in your eye  
Gets me every time  
And well there must have been a time  
I was the reason for that smile  
Keep in mind  
As you take whats left of you and I  
  
Tell me Im a screwed up mess  
That I never listen listen  
Tell me you dont want my kiss  
That you need your distance distance  
Tell me anything but dont you say hes what youre missing baby  
If hes the reason youre leaving me tonight  
Spare me what you think and  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me Im a screwed up mess  
That I never listen listen  
Tell me you dont want my kiss  
That you need your distance distance  
Tell me anything but dont you say hes what youre missing baby  
If hes the reason youre leaving me tonight  
Spare me what you think and  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me a lie
