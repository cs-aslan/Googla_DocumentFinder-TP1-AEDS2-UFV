Youre kind youre so kind  
You rescued me when I was blind  
And you put me on your pillow  
When I was on the wall  
Youre kind so kind so kind  
And youre good youre so good  
You introduced me to your neighborhood  
Seem like I aint never had so many friends before  
Thats because youre good youre so good  
Why you dont treat me like the other humans do  
Is just a mystery to me  
It gets me agitated when I think that  
Youre gonna love me now indefinitely  
So goodbye goodbye  
Im gonna leave you now  
And heres the reason why  
I like to sleep with the window open  
And you keep the window closed  
So goodbye goodbye goodbye
