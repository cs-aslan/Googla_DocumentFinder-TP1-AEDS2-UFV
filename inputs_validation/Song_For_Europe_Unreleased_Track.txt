Here  
As I sit  
At this empty cafe  
Thinking of you  
I remember  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That well never  
Find again  
Though the world  
Is my oyster  
Its only a shell  
Full of memories  
Here by the Seine  
NotreDame casts  
A long lonely shadow  
Now only sorrow  
No tomorrow  
Theres no today for us  
Nothing is there  
For us to share  
But yesterday  
This is my song  
This is my song  
This is my song  
These cities may change  
But there always remains  
My obsession  
Through silken waters  
My gondola glides  
And the bridge  
it sighs  
I remember  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That well never  
Find again  
Theres no more time for us  
Nothing is there  
For us to share  
But yesterdays  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That well never  
Find again  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That well never  
Find again  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That well never  
Find again
