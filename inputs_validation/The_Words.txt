All of the lights land on you  
The rest of the world fades from you  
And all of the love I see  
Please please say you feel it too  
And all of the noise I hear inside  
Restless and loud unspoken and wild  
And all that you need to say  
To make it all go away  
Its that you feel the same way too  
  
And I know  
The scariest part is letting go  
Cause love is a ghost you cant control  
I promise you the truth cant hurt us now  
So let the words slip out of your mouth  
  
And all of the steps that led me to you  
And all of the hell I had you walk through  
But I wouldnt trade a day for the chance to say  
My love Im in love with you  
  
And I know  
The scariest part is letting go  
Cause love is a ghost you cant control  
I promise you the truth cant hurt us now  
So let the words slip out of your mouth  
  
I know that were both afraid  
We both made the same mistakes  
An open heart is an open wound to you  
And in the wind theres a heavy choice  
Love has a quiet voice  
Still you mind now Im yours to choose  
  
And I know  
The scariest part is letting go  
Let my love be the light that guides you home  
  
And I know  
The scariest part is letting go  
Cause love is a ghost you cant control  
I promise you the truth cant hurt us now  
So let the words slip out of your mouth
