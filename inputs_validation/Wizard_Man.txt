Wizard mans got a magic tooth  
Carry it low but keep it loose  
Dont wait for christmas when the four winds blow  
When they carry you out youre gonna have to go  
Wizard mans got a pocketful of lead  
Keep a clear eye and a steady head  
Dont wait for christmas cause its bound to snow  
When they carry you out youre gonna have to go  
Wizard mans got an angels heart  
Show it slow but do it sharp  
Dont wait for christmas join a travelling show  
When they carry you out you wont want to go
