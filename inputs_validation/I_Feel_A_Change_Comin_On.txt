Well Im lookin the world over  
Looking far off into the east  
And I see my baby comin  
Shes walking with the village beast  
I feel a change comin on  
And the last part of the days already gone  
  
We got so much in common  
We strive for the same old ends  
And I just cant wait  
Wait for us to become friends  
I feel a change comin on  
And the fourth part of the days already gone  
  
Well life is for love  
And they say that love is blind  
If you wanna live easy  
Baby pack your clothes with mine  
I feel a change comin on  
And the fourth part of the days already gone  
  
Well now whats the use in dreaming  
You got better things to do  
Dreams never did work for me anyway  
Even when they did come true  
  
You are as porous as ever  
Baby you can start a fire  
I must be losing my mind  
Youre the object of my desire  
I feel a change comin on  
And the fourth part of the days already gone  
  
Im listening to Billy Joe Shaver  
And Im reading James Joyce  
Some people they tell me  
I got the blood of the land in my voice  
  
Everybody got all the money  
Everybody got all the beautiful clothes  
Everybody got all the flowers  
I dont have one single rose  
I feel a change comin on  
And the fourth part of the days already gone
