Verse 1Drake  
  
I Forgot To Call You On Your Birthday  
You Swear Youre The Last Thing On My Mind  
There Is Nothin I Can Do To Fix It  
All You Ever Asked Me For Was Time  
When The Lights Dont Glow The Same Way That They Used To  
And I Finally Get A Moment To Myself  
I Will Realize You Were Everything Im Missing  
And Youll Tell Me Youre In Love With Someone Else  
  
ChorusDrake  
  
So Can You Do Me A Favor If I Pull It Together  
Make It Sooner Than Later  
We Wont Be Here Forever And I Realized I Waited Too Long  
But Please Dont Move On  
You Dont Need No One Else  
You Dont Need No One ElElElElElse  
You Dont Need No One Else  
You Dont Need No One ElElElEl Oh Ho Ho  
You Dont Need No One Else  
  
Verse 2Drake  
  
You Just Changed Your Hair And It Looks Perfect  
Wish I Was The First To Let You Know  
Every Chance I Get To Make It Better  
I Just Find A Way To Let It Go  
When The Lights Dont Glow The Same Way That They Used To  
And I Finally Get A Moment To Myself  
I Will Realize You Were Everything Im Missing  
And Youll Tell Me Youre In Love With Someone Else  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3Drake  
  
The Girl Of The World You See Someone Gotta Lose  
I Thought I Can Have It All Do I Really Gotta Choose  
What Good Is All The Cash If It Doesnt Buy Time  
And What Good Is Bein Famous If Im Never On Your Mind  
Nights Fallen Lights Glowin And Im Just Tryna Pay The Price Owin  
And I Dont Wanna Feel The Comfort From My Ice Showin  
And I Aint Tryna Be Without You At The Right Moments  
Nigga Nice Goin  
Is It Worth It That Decision  
Cause Hearts Breakin I Aint Tryna Be In That Collision  
So Imma Dust My Shirt And Fix My Pants  
Cause I Better Look Good Girl If This My Chance I Swear  
  
Chorus
