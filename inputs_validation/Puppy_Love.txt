Its not puppy love  
Puppy puppy puppy love  
Its not puppy love  
Puppy puppy puppy love  
  
You make me wanna be like one of those girls  
From the 1950s wearing those big pearls  
Ill cook you breakfast  
Coffee on your desk yes  
I might burn your toast  
But baby Im still the bestest  
  
Its not puppy love  
Puppy puppy puppy love  
Its not puppy love  
Puppy puppy puppy love  
  
You make me wanna be like one of those girls  
On the colored tv it was a new world  
The dick Van Dyke Show  
Were Cher and Bono  
The way I sing i Got You Babe  
Makes you say oh no  
Cause youre the class president  
Without Jackie O  
And Im singing Happy Birthday  
Like Marilyn Monroe  
  
One this is not a school girl crush no  
Two this is not puppy love uhuh  
Its the real thing  
When you told me you loved me  
Promise Ill never see Arthur or Bobby baby  
  
One this is not a school girl thing no  
Two what about the diamond ring Uhuh  
Everyone knows Im like Jessica Rabbit  
Im your leading lady I gotta have it baby  
  
Its not puppy love  
Puppy puppy puppy love  
Its not puppy love  
Puppy puppy puppy love  
  
You make me wanna be like one of those girls  
Calendar pinup queen in platinum curls  
Ill do my summer pose  
Golden sand between my toes  
You can pack my favorite snack  
A Veuve Clicquot and Ho Hos  
Youre everybodys hero and youre hitting it home  
While Im singing for the soldiers  
Like Marilyn Monroe  
  
One this is not a school girl crush no  
Two this is not puppy love uhuh  
Its the real thing  
When you told me you loved me  
Promise Ill never see Arthur or Bobby baby  
  
One this is not a school girl thing no  
Two what about the diamond ring Uhuh  
Everyone knows Im like Jessica Rabbit  
Im your leading lady I gotta have it baby  
Baby baby  
  
And if I call you on the telephone  
I might overdose  
Cause Im strong but Im lonely  
Like Marilyn Monroe  
  
This is not a school girl crush  
This is not puppy love  
Its the real thing  
When you told me you loved me  
What ever happened to hold me and trust me baby  
  
One this is not a school girl crush no  
Two this is not puppy love uhuh  
Its the real thing  
When you told me you loved me  
Promise Ill never see Arthur or Bobby baby  
  
One this is not a school girl thing no  
Two what about the diamond ring Uhuh  
Everyone knows Im like Jessica Rabbit  
Im your leading lady I gotta have it baby  
  
Its not puppy love  
Puppy puppy puppy love  
Its not puppy love  
Puppy puppy puppy love  
  
Its not puppy love  
Puppy puppy puppy love  
Its not puppy love  
Puppy puppy puppy love
