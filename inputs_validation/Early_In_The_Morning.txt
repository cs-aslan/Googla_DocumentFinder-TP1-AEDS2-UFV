Early in the morning and I cant get right  
Had a little date with my baby last night  
  
Now its early in the morning  
Ooh in the morning  
Early in the morning  
And I aint got nothing but the blues  
  
I went to all the places where we used to go  
I went to our house but she dont live there no more  
  
Now its early in the morning  
Ooh in the morning  
Early in the morning  
And I aint got nothing but the blues  
  
I went to your girlfriends house but she was out  
I knocked on her mothers door and she began to shout  
Get away mad boy  
  
Yes early in the morning  
Ooh in the morning  
Early in the morning  
And I aint got nothing but the blues  
  
I went to Incomprehensible to get something to eat  
The waitress looked at me and said  
Pops you sure look beat  
  
Now its early in the morning  
Ooh in the morning  
Early in the morning  
And I aint got nothing but the blues  
  
I had a lot of money when I started out  
Couldnt find my baby now my moneys run out  
  
Now its early in the morning  
Ooh in the morning  
Early in the morning  
And I aint got nothing but the blues  
  
In the morning  
Yeah so early in the morning  
Come back to me baby  
In the morning  
Early in the morning  
Come back to me baby
