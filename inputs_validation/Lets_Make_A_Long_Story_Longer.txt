Everybodys lookin for a happy ending  
Before the real story even begins  
Its so easy to pretend youre not pretending  
Till the naked truth comes walkin on in  
  
But we aint runnin when the truth gets hot  
Thats how ya find out just how much youve really got  
  
Chorus  
Lets make a long story longer  
Lets make this strong love a little bit stronger  
Our star is gonna shine shine even brighter  
Believe what we feel keep it real  
Make a long story longer  
  
The seed of love is so deeply planted  
Inside the heart is where it lives and grows  
Well keep it safe cause we dont take it for granted  
Let the hard rains fall let the cold wind blow  
  
Every storm is just a lesson to learn  
Just bring us closer with every page we turn baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Ya gotta stand the test of time  
If ya want to keep the treasure you find  
Some can only dream about forever  
But look at us baby were creatin it together  
  
Chorus  
  
Lets make a long story longer  
Lets make this strong love a little bit stronger  
Baby live what we feel keep it real  
Make a long story longer  
Lets make a long story longer
