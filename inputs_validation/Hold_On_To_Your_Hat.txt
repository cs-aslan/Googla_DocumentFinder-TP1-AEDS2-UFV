Hold on to your head  
Hold on to your hat  
Youre screaming down the alley  
And never coming back  
Get out of my bod  
Get out of the sack  
Dont give me no lip  
Dont give me no crap  
No way  
  
Get out the madhouse  
Tear it all down  
Get out the madhouse  
Burn it to the ground  
Got to got to get out  
  
Get out of my face  
Get out of my shack  
Now youve had a fair share  
You had a fair whack  
Hold on to your butt  
Hold on to your hat  
Youre heading out of here  
And never coming back  
  
Get out the madhouse  
Tear it all down  
Get out the madhouse  
Burn it to the ground  
Well never make it  
Dont you fake it  
Youre getting loaded  
Im getting goaded  
Got to got to get out  
  
Hold on to your heart  
Hold on to your hat  
Dont give me no shit  
Dont give me no crap  
Hold on to your head  
Dont give me no rap  
Ive had it up to here  
With your yaketyyak  
  
Youre getting loaded  
Im getting goaded  
Well never make it  
Dont fake it  
Get out the madhouse  
Tear it all down  
Get out the madhouse  
Burn it to the ground  
Got to got to get out  
Got to got to get out  
  
Come on baby  
Come on baby  
Burn it all down  
Im over with ya baby
