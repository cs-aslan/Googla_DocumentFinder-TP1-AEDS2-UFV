Im still here but yet Im gone  
I dont play guitar or sing my songs  
They never defined who I am  
The man that loves you til the end  
  
Youre the last person I will love  
Youre the last face I will recall  
And best of all Im not gonna miss you  
Not gonna miss you  
  
Im never gonna hold you like I did  
Or say I love you to the kids  
Youre never gonna see it in my eyes  
Its not gonna hurt me when you cry  
  
Im never gonna know what you go through  
All the things Ill say or do  
All the hurt and all the pain  
One thing selfishly remains  
  
Im not gonna miss you  
Im not gonna miss you
