Teacher  
J do you have a Halloween story for the class  
Violent J  
whywhyyeah um there was this boy and he lived in his house  
and he went to bed one day and then when he woke up um  
when he woke up he was buried up to his head in the dirt  
and he couldnt move and this man came walking along  
but instead of the man helping him out the man just started  
kicking him and kicking him in his face over and over  
and then he got the lawnmower and then he  
Dick or treat bon appetit  
All the little kiddies running down my street  
Gathering candy treats door to door  
But they walk past mine what for  
Probably cause the pumpkins on my porch are real  
Real human heads carved out with steel  
Cut out the eyes man it takes but a minute  
Rip out the be be be be brains and put a candle in it  
Maybe they run cause I take em inside  
Come and meet Mother two years ago she died  
Little boys laugh cause they think its just a dummy  
But then the smell hits em MMMMM smells yummy  
Open your bags and Ill give you my treat  
Crusty yellow toes off a dead womans feet  
Take me by the hand and Ill lead you downstairs  
And that little chickies is where youll spend the next seven years  
Starving and weakening chained to a wall  
Staring at a roach hoping it will crawl  
Into your mouth for a tasty cuisine  
Yes my little friends its a Dead Pumpkins Halloween  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
Awwwwwwwwww yeah its that special time of year boys and girls  
so come to the pumpkin patch and bring your pantysacks so I can shit in it  
you beeeeeyitch  
Violent J  
Well I love all the kiddies but I cant fuck around  
Dont come to my door dressed as a clown  
cause you never know I might take it the wrong way  
cause Im the real wicked juggalokaro Violent J  
All year round but I love my Halloween  
Youll never get an apple or a purple jelly bean  
Dropping some chocolates a licorice snack  
Instead you get a deepfried French poodle nutsack  
Peeking out my door I see no children in sight  
Perhaps theyre all dead yesterday was Devils Night  
They burn down the city and they leave it crispycharred  
I light myself on fire and I dance around my backyard  
Hungry bellies I can see where youre at  
Sitting on my window I can turn into a bat  
Watching you remove all your little clothesies for bed  
I crash through the window and land on your head  
Drinking the blood blood is gone to the bone  
But now I must leave Mothers calling me home  
Up to the moonlight Im gone from the scene  
Peace to Detroit City and have a Dead Pumpkins Halloween  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
Yeeeeeeeeah Im gonna smash your little candy bags  
only Im gonna tie em around your muthafuckin necks  
and choke you with em Wicked Clown style muthafucka  
Violent J  
Detroits in this bitch
