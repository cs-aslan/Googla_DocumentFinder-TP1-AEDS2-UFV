In my life  
Ive felt so self assured  
But suddenly its all changed  
Shes a cloud that hangs above my world  
And I find myself wondring in the rain  
And now I cant go on  
Cause I am lost  
Living inside myself  
Living inside this shell  
Living outside your love  
I am lost somewhere inside my own dreams  
Afraid of what life really means  
Living without your love  
I need a guiding light  
To shine on my darkest days  
I was young and time was on my side  
But like a fool I let it slip away  
And now those days are gone  
And I am lost  
Living inside myself  
Living inside this shell  
Living outside your love  
I am lost somewhere inside my own dreams  
Afraid of what life really means  
Living without your love  
In my life  
Ive felt so selfassured  
But oh how all the seasons change  
And now Im not that strong  
  
Cause I am lost  
Living inside myself  
Living inside this hell  
Living outside your love  
I am lost somewhere inside my own dreams  
Afraid of what life really means  
Living without your love  
I am lost  
Living inside myself
