Today we stood on the wall  
We laughed at the sun  
We laughed at the guns  
We laughed at it all  
And when they they told us to go  
We paid them no mind  
Like any other time  
But little did we know  
  
Today I look for a sign with flames in my hands  
A line in the sand between yours and mine  
And it came like fire from below  
Your greed led the call my flag had to fall  
But little did you know  
  
Another day your truth will come  
Youre gonna pay for what you  
Pay for what youve done  
Youll get whats yours  
And face your fraud  
Youre gonna give me back whats mine  
Give me back whats mine  
  
I aint never been a coward I aint never seen blood  
You had sold me an ocean and I was lost in the flood  
We were counting on a leader  
We were driven by need couldnt take temptation  
And we were blinded by greed  
You were steady as a sniper  
We were waiting on a wire  
So we never saw it coming  
When you ran from the fire  
You can try intimidation  
Or you can try to roar  
But when the time comes calling  
Yeah You are gonna get yours  
  
Another day your truth will come  
Youre gonna pay for what you  
Pay for what youve done  
Youll get whats yours  
And face your fraud  
Youre gonna give me back whats mine  
Give me back whats mine  
  
And so today your truth has come  
Youre gonna pay for what you  
Pay for what youve done  
Youll get whats yours  
Youre out of time  
And you will give me back whats mine  
Give me give me back whats mine  
  
Give me give me back whats mine  
Whats mine give me give me back whats mine  
Whats mine Whats mine  
Give me back whats mine  
  
Today we stood on the wall  
We laughed at the sun we laughed at the guns  
We laughed at it all  
And when they they told us to go  
We paid them no mind like any other time  
But little did we know
