Whos gonna tell you when its too late  
Whos gonna tell you things arent so great  
  
You cant go on thinking nothings wrong  
Whos gonna drive you home tonight  
  
Whos gonna pick you up when you fall  
Whos gonna hang it up when you call  
Whos gonna pay attention to your dreams  
Whos gonna plug your ears when you scream  
  
You cant go on thinking nothings wrong  
Whos gonna drive you home tonight  
  
Whos gonna hold you down when you escape  
Whos gonna come around when you break  
  
You cant go on thinking nothings wrong  
Whos gonna drive you home tonight  
  
You cant go on thinking nothings wrong  
Whos gonna drive you home tonight  
Whos gonna drive you home tonight
