Girl youre getting that look in your eyes  
And its starting to worry me  
See I aint ready for no family ties  
No womans gonna hurry me  
  
Just keep it friendly girl  
cause I dont wanna leave  
If you start clinging to me  
You know that I cant breathe  
  
Baby Baby dont get hooked on me  
Baby Baby dont get hooked on me  
Cause Ill just use you and Ill set you free  
Baby baby dont get hooked on me  
  
Youve been my hot lovin woman  
And its hot where youve been touching me  
And I can tell by your trembling lips  
Youve been seeing just a little too much of me  
  
Now dont let your life get all tangled up in mine  
Cause Ill just use you I cant take no clinging vine  
  
Baby Baby dont get hooked on me  
Baby Baby dont get hooked on me  
Cause Ill just use you and Ill set you free  
Baby Baby dont get hooked on me  
  
Baby Baby dont get hooked on me  
No no no Baby Baby dont get hooked on me no  
Cause Ill just use you and Ill set you free set you free  
Baby baby dont get hooked on me
