My Amazon sixtriggered bride  
Now searching for a place to hide  
Still sees the truth quite easily  
But shrouds all else in mystery  
While madmen in top hats and tails  
Impale themselves on sixinch nails  
And some Arabian alsoran  
Impersonates a watering can  
  
Some Santa Clauslike face of note  
Entreats my ears to set afloat  
My feeble sick and weary brain  
And I am overcome with shame  
And hide inside my overcoat  
And hurriedly begin to quote  
While some Arabian sheikh most grand  
Impersonates a hotdog stand  
  
The Red Cross ambulance outside  
Can only mean that I must hide  
Til dusk and finally the night  
When I will make a hasty flight  
Across the sea and far away  
To where the weary exiles stay  
And some Arabian oilwell  
Impersonates a padded cell
