All he could think about was Im to young for this  
Got my whole life ahead  
Hell Im just a kid myself  
Howm I gonna raise one  
  
All he could see were his dreams going up in smoke  
So much for ditching this town and hanging out on the coast  
Oh well those plans are long gone  
  
And he said  
There goes my life  
There goes my future my everything  
Might as well kiss it all goodbye  
There goes my life  
  
A couple years of up all night and a few thousand diapers later  
That mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigerator  
Oh yeahhe loves that little girl  
  
Mommas waiting to tuck her in  
As she stumbles up those stairs  
She smiles back at him dragging that teddy bear  
Sleep tight blue eyes and bouncing curls  
  
He smiles  
There goes my life  
There goes my future my everything  
I love you daddy goodnight  
There goes my life  
  
She had that Honda loaded down  
With Abercrombie clothes and fifteen pairs of shoes and his American express  
He checked the oil and slammed the hood said your good to go  
She hugged them both and headed off to the west coast  
  
He cried  
There goes my life  
There goes my future my everything  
I love you  
Baby goodbye  
  
There goes my life  
There goes my life
