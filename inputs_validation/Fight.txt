We wake up different rifle through our dreams another placid day ripples at
the seams  
  
Do you think I bow out cause I think youre right  
Or cause I dont want to fight

Do you think I bow out cause I think youre right  
Or cause I dont want to fight we get so weary  
Taking fish off hooks its not as effortless as it may look  
  
Do you think I bow out cause I think youre right  
Or cause I dont want to fight  
We lay down seething smell our pillows burn and drift off to the place where
youd think wed learn  
  
Do you think I bow out cause I think youre right  
Or cause I dont want to fight I said I give
