Thinking positivity  
If you want to be with me  
Ill take you to the promised land  
Come on baby take my hand  
  
Stop draggin around  
  
Higher and higher and higher we get  
Ill freak you like a sexolette  
You say you want to be my wife  
Ill take you to another life come on  
  
Stop draggin around  
  
Come on baby take my hand  
Ill take you to the promised land  
  
Stop draggin around
