Down over the window  
From the dazzling sunlit rays  
Through the back alleys through the blinds  
Another one of them endless days  
  
Honey bees are buzzing  
Leaves begin to stir  
Im in love with my second cousin  
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her  
  
I keep listening for footsteps  
But I aint never hearing any  
From the boat I fish for bullheads  
I catch a lot sometimes too many  
  
A summer breeze is blowin  
A squall is setting in  
Sometimes its just plain stupid  
To get into any kind of wind  
  
Well the old men round here  
Sometimes they get on bad terms  
With the younger men  
Old young age dont carry weight  
It doesnt matter in the end  
  
One of the boss hangerson  
Sometimes comes to call  
At times you least expect  
Tryin to bully you strongarm you  
Inspire you with fear  
It has the opposite effect  
  
Theres a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town  
The old one is long gone  
10 foot 2 foot 6 across  
Burns with the bark still on  
  
They say times are hard  
If you dont believe it you can follow your nose  
It dont bother me times are hard anywhere  
Well just have to see how it goes  
  
My old man hes like some feudal lord  
Hes got more lives than a cat  
Ive never seen him quarrel with my mother even once  
Things come alive or they fall flat  
  
You can smell the pine wood burnin  
You can hear the school bell ring  
Got to get up near the teacher if you can  
If you wanna learn anything  
  
Romeo he said to Juliet you got a poor complexion  
It dont give you an appearance or a youthful touch  
Juliet said back to Romeo  
Why dont you just shove off  
If it bothers you so much  
  
They got outta here any way they could  
Cold rain can give you the shivers  
They went down the Ohio the Cumberland the Tennessee  
All the rest of them rebel rivers  
  
If you ever try to interfere with me  
Or cross my path again  
You do so at the peril of your life  
Im not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound  
Ive seen enough heartache and strife  
  
My grandfather was a duck trapper  
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes   
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth  
I dont know if they had any dreams or hopes  
  
I had em once though I suppose  
To go along with all the ring dancing  
Christmas carols and all the Christmas eves  
I left all my dreams and hopes  
Buried under tobacco leaves  
  
Not always easy kicking someone up  
Got to wait awhile it can be an unpleasant task  
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up  
And tears or not its too much to ask
