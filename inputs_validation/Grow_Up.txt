I thought about you the other day  
What the hell happened with you and me  
Cause oh aint no loving no more  
  
You aint as cool as you used to be  
Closer to the mirror than you are to me  
I said oh had to show you that door  
Someday I hope that we can fix it cos I aint too proud to try  
Say hi to your friends and if they ever ask you why We dont talk  
  
chorus  
Know you gotta grow up  
Aint you sick of being immature  
Talking loud cos youre insecure  
You always turn it up turn it up turn it up Cmon  
Why you always gotta show off  
Its something that I already know  
That when you hear this on the radio  
Youre gotta turn it up turn it up turn it up  
Cause its all about you  
Its all about you  
  
Now you said some stuff that you cant take back  
How did you think that I would react  
Cause you you must be outta your mind  
How did we go straight from love to hate Now its so deep that we cant be
mates  
I said oh we should give it sometime  
  
Someday I hope that we can fix it cos I aint too proud to try  
Say hi to your friends and if they ever ask you why We dont talk  
  
Chorus  
  
Ohhhhhhhhhh  
Anytime you start it  
Grow up a little darlin x2  
  
Chorus  
  
Ohhhhhhhhhh  
Anytime you start it  
Grow up a little darlin
