You dont have to try so hard  
Whats with the attitude  
All I want is who you are  
All you gotta do is  
  
Love me like you mean it  
Every day I really want to know  
Thats youre willing to lay your heart on the line  
Talking is fine but feeling is believing  
Love me like you mean it  
  
You can try the latest style  
But that wont turn my head  
If you want to drive me wild  
And keep me interested  
Theyll try to tell you  
That the secret to the mind of a man  
Is to be some kind of fantasy  
But what Im needing  
You aint ever gonna find in a magazine  
Its in between you and me
