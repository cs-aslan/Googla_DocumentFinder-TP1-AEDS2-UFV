Dont believe me if I tell you  
Not a word of this is true  
Dont believe me if I tell you  
Especially if I tell you that Im in love with you  
  
Dont believe me if I tell you  
That I wrote this song for you  
There might be some other silly pretty girl  
Im singing it to  
  
Dont believe a word  
For words are only spoken  
Your heart is like a promise  
Made to be broken  
  
Dont believe a word  
Words can tell lies  
And lies are no comfort  
When theres tear in your eyes  
  
Dont believe me if I tell you  
Not a word of this is true  
Dont believe me if I tell you  
Especially if I tell you that Im in love with you  
  
Dont believe a word
