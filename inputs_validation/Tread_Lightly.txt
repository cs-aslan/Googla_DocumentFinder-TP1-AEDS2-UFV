Another time another day  
Another baby on the way  
A dreamboy for your nightmare nights  
Who never shouts and never fights  
Happy with your 22  
What else is there for you to do  
But turn and wet the babys head  
And pray he will be happier than you or me  
Thats how its meant to be  
Its called a lifetime  
At first you never notice  
Then the years go flying by and I say  
Tread lightly in your dreams  
They might come true for you tomorrow  
  
Say sorry to the boys and girls  
Youre sorry for this bloody world  
Sorry for the sick and old  
And sorry for the lies you told  
Sorry for the things I did  
The thighs we should have left unsaid  
And walked away instead of  
Rubbing salt on all those open sores and wounds  
We should have left to heal  
I never knew just what to feel or to expect  
I tried to stretch my mind but Id just  
Get my body wrecked and now I  
Tread lightly in my dreams  
They might come true tomorrow  
And I dont sleep at night in case  
I dont wake up tomorrow  
I curse the day I met you  
But I wont forget you  
Not in my lifetime  
  
Another time another day  
Youd never give your heart away  
Youd never think and never cry  
Youd look the devil in the eye  
And tell him to be gone bye bye  
Hell never get you in this lifetime  
Hed love to touch you but his hands are tied  
So just tread lightly in your dreams  
They might come true for you tomorrow  
Tread lightly in your dreams  
They might come true for you tomorrow  
They might come true for you tomorrow  
They might come true tomorrow
