Chorus  
Love talk about love  
Why do you always  
want to talk about love  
Love talk about love  
Why do you always  
want to talk about it  
  
I say that love  
Is something you feel  
You know in your heart  
If its real  
But youve got to analyze  
Organize synchronize formalize  
And compromise  
  
Chorus  
  
I say love  
Its like when you sing  
You move to the music  
When the words dont mean a thing  
But know youve got to clarify  
Define it and refine it  
Align and realign it  
  
Chorus  
  
You dont have to understand  
Every little thing between  
A woman and a man  
True love  
Comes from deep inside  
Try to use your logic  
And youll only lose your mind  
  
Chorus
