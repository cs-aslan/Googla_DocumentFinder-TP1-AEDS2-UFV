Theres a howlin at my window baby  
I hear him closin in  
That greeneyed jackals got the scent  
Knows Ill let him in  
He slinks in by me at the fire  
More bitter than the cold  
And its a rage as old as Hades  
Thatll sputter on these coals  
Im callin on the Furies to let the toast begin  
Im roasting on the spit of love again  
I never have believed you  
But I stick around for more  
Somethin bout that hollow in your eyes  
Theres a darkness at the core  
Well its got me slowly turnin  
Im basting on the bone  
Im skewered like some drunken fool  
In juices all my own  
Callin the Furies carrion choir  
Singin me back upon the pyre  
Im roasting on that spit of love again  
You can call it what you want  
But its lyin just the same  
Theres no mercy in these ashes baby  
When your loves a cryin shame  
And theyre howlin in moonlight baby  
Theyre here to call my bluff  
theyre wonderin if therell ever come a day  
When Ill have finally had enough  
Im callin on the Furies to let the toast begin  
Im roasting on that spit of love again
