Youre on top of the world  
On top of the world and you cant  
Get any higheryoure on top of the world  
Youre on top of the world tonight  
It wasnt easy it was hard as hell  
You didnt get luck in a wishin well  
Never worked so hard had so much pain  
Wouldnt change for anything  
Learned love from a movie screen  
He was tough she was wild at fifteen  
Quit school and had no dreams  
Wasnt going very far  
  
Then he got religion and she got a god  
Its on her back and its in his job  
And it costs lots of money honey oh no  
Breakdown nearly every day  
Shoulda known couldnt get away  
Got lucky with the girl next door  
She was lonely and didnt care  
  
She was young she was dark she was fair  
Wrapped herself around you with her stare  
Youd explode if she would touch you there  
Touch you there touch you there  
Tonight tonighttonighttonight  
Youre on top of the world  
On top of the world and you cant  
Get any higher  
Youre on top of the world  
Youre on top of the world tonight  
  
can you hear me can you see me youre on top of the world tonight  
can you hear me can you see me youre on top of the world tonight  
can you hear me can you see me youre on top of the world tonight  
can you hear me can you see me youre on top of the world tonight
