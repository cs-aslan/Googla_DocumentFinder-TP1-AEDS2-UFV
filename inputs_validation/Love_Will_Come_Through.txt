If I told you a secret  
You wont tell a soul  
Will you hold it and  
Keep it alive  
  
Cause its burning a hole  
And I cant get to sleep  
And I cant live alone  
In this lie  
  
So look up take it away  
Dont look down  
The mountain  
  
If the world isnt turning  
Your heart wont return  
Anyone anything anyhow  
  
So take me dont leave me  
Take me dont leave me  
Baby love will come through  
Its just waiting for you  
  
And you stand at the crossroads  
Of highroads and low roads  
And Ive got a feeling  
Its right  
  
If its real what Im feeling  
Theres no make believing  
The sound of the wings  
Of the flight  
  
Of a dove take it away  
Dont look down  
The mountain  
  
If the world isnt turning  
Your heart wont return  
Anyone anything anyhow  
  
So take me dont leave me  
Take me dont leave me  
Baby love will come through  
Its just waiting for you  
  
Oh look up take it away  
Dont look down  
  
If the world isnt turning  
Your heart wont return  
Anyone anything anyhow  
  
So take me dont leave me  
Take me dont leave me  
Baby love will come through  
Its just waiting for you  
  
Love will come through  
Love will come through  
Love will come through
