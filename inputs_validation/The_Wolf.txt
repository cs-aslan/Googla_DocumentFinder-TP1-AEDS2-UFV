Watch out children theres a wolf out there  
Open up your eyes son  
Cause hes gonna get you  
Lock your door at night  
Cause hes gonna eat you  
Dont try fighting beasts  
Cause hes gonna beat you  
Watch out children theres a wolf out there  
Never run against the wind  
Cause hes gonna win  
If theres any doubt in your mind  
Check and see if its full moon out tonight  
Check and see if hes got a tail  
Dont forget to check his nails  
Guardian angel  
Guardian angel stay with me  
Im on my knees  
Watch out children theres a wolf out there  
He aint got no sweet mercy  
Hes only crazy  
Dangers got you running scared  
Can you tell me why youre going  
Take a good look in his eyes  
Dont shake his hand to tight  
Be aware of Greek gifts  
Hes a son of a bitch  
Your taste is in his mouth  
He wants to have you now  
Yeah what are we gonna do  
With this big mean wolf  
What are we gonna do  
Were gonna whack him  
Smack him spank him yeah  
Watch out children theres a wolf out there  
Open up your eyes son  
Guardian angel  
Watch out children  
He is somewhere I can see him  
Carry guns and knives tonight  
Save your ass tonight  
Watch out children
