Ive got a story to tell would you mind listening  
I can always count on  
You were such good friends  
And I need to talk about my situation and  
Youre the only one wholl understand  
Now someones got designs on my baby  
Shes making her intentions very plain  
  
Chorus  
We both know this ole gal  
That Im talking about but I dont  
Want to mention any names  
Well shes asked him to slow dance way too often  
Shes made suggestions I dont like at all  
Im trying to let her know that  
Im wise to her game but I  
Dont want to mention any names  
  
Well I can understand why shed want him  
Oh youve even said yourself hes quite a prize  
Shes about a good of friend as you are  
Come to think about it shes just about your size  
If she dont back off theres gonna be some trouble  
Im prepared to make that very plain  
I sure hope Ive said enough and just between the two of us  
  
Chorus
