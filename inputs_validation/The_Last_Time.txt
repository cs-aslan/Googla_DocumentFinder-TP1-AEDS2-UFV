Now its the last time to remember what you said to me  
And Im the last person in the world I thought Id be  
And now its high time to be something bigger than we are  
Its never too late to reverse a thing thats gone too far  
  
1st Chorus  
And I think the whole worlds laughing at us  
But I dont care thats not the point  
Theres so much more  
Theres so much more than meets the eye  
Oh when youre around Im blind  
  
Now its the last time to leave the shadows far behind  
And its the last time to clear the cobwebs from our mind  
And its the last time to bury all our memories  
And its the last time before everything just fades away  
  
2nd Chorus  
And I wish that you were here with me  
And I wish that somehow things would change  
Youd lose your fear of me  
And I feel that things might be okay  
Oh wouldnt that be strange  
  
Now its the last time to reconsider what weve done  
And its the last time to start all over from day one  
  
Repeat 2nd Chorus  
  
Repeat 1st Chorus
