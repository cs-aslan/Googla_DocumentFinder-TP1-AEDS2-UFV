Maybe Ive been on the road too long  
Living my life through these songs  
I guess loving a music man  
Really wasnt in your plans  
  
Does it matter if Im sorry again  
And why should I apologize  
You knew all along this was my life  
You know my ins and outs  
  
All of my fears and doubts  
Its the life I love but its you I cant live without  
  
And this whole world seems cold and empty  
Someone please turn on the lights  
Lord if theres an angel you could send me  
I could use one here tonight  
  
Where am I supposed to go  
My only home was in your soul  
I know that I cant stay here  
And drown in a pool of tears  
Should I pack my pride and face this life alone  
  
And this whole world seems cold and empty  
Someone please turn on the lights  
Lord if theres an angel you could send me  
I could use one here tonight  
  
Maybe its me whos cold and empty  
And in my darkness I cannot see the light  
Please God if theres an angel you could send me if theres an angel  
Cause theres one missing from my life  
  
You are my heart you are my soul  
Wherever you are thats where I go  
You know my ins and outs  
All of my dears and doubts  
  
Its the life I love but its you I cant live without  
Its the life I love but its you I cant live without  
Baby its the life I love but its you I cant live without  
Yeah the life I love the life I love but its you I cant live without
