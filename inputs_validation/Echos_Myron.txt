Tower to the skies  
An academy of lies  
And what goes up  
Surely must come down  
And we felt the mighty blowup  
With the walls coming down  
Or something like that  
most of us are quite pleased  
With the same old song  
And all of a sudden Im relatively sane  
With everything to lose and nothing to gain  
Or something like that  
man of wisdom and man of compromise  
Man of weak flesh in an armored disguise  
All fall down  
  
if its right you can tell echos myron like a siren  
With endurance like the liberty bell  
And he tells you of the dreamers  
But hes cracked up like the road  
And hed like to lift us up but were a very heavy load  
And were finally here and shit yeah its cool  
And shouldnt it be  or something like that
