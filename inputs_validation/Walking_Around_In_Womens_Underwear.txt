Lacey things the wife is missing  
Didnt ask for her permission  
Im wearing her clothes  
Her silk panty hose  
Walking around in womens underwear  
  
In the store theres a teddy  
With little straps like spagetti  
It holds me so tight  
Like handcuffs at night  
Walking around in womens underwear  
  
In the office theres a guy named Melvin  
He pretends that I am Murphy Brown  
Hell say Are you ready  
Ill say Woah man Lets wait untill the wife is out of town  
Later on if you wanna  
We can dress like Madonna  
Put on some eye shade and join the parade  
Walking around in womens underwear  
  
Lacey things missing  
Didnt ask permission  
Wearing her clothes silk panty hose  
Walking around in womens underwear  
Walking around in womens underwear
