I remember you like it was yesterday  
Remember the time you said youd find me  
I remember the songs that you used to play  
I hear them still and it reminds me  
My runaway you know youve gone wrong for so long  
So glamorous at the outset  
Now youre almost done  
  
Youre not free  
Youre only lost  
Time to get home  
And count up the calls  
Livin on dreams  
That never were real  
Get down to the touch  
Because you cant feel  
Youre not free  
Youre only lost  
  
Prayin to God  
Youve broken the chains  
One day youll look back  
And think of my name  
All of your friends  
Pretend youre the best  
They run you around  
But they could care less  
Theyll never see  
How good it could be  
No man like me  
Theyll never know  
Just where it could go  
You think youre free  
  
Youre not free  
Youre only lost  
Time to get home  
And count up the calls  
Livin on dreams  
That never were real  
Get down to the touch  
Because you cant feel  
You stumbled  
And you still dont see it  
The losers always think they can win  
Youre never gonna wanna believe it  
You think youre gone  
But I see ya yeah  
  
Youre not free  
Youre only lost  
Time to get home  
And count up the calls  
Livin on dreams  
That never were real  
Get down to the touch  
Because you cant feel  
  
Youre not free  
Youre only lost  
Time to get home  
And count up the calls  
Livin on dreams  
That never were real  
Get down to the touch  
Because you cant feel  
  
Youre not free  
Youre only lost  
Youre not free  
Youre not free  
Youre not free
