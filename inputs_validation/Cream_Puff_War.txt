No no She cant take your mind and leave  
I know its just another trick shes got up her sleeve  
  
I cant believe that she really wants you to die  
After all its more than enough to pay for your lie  
  
Wait a minute watch what youre doin with your time  
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind yeah  
  
Well cant you see that youre killing each others soul  
Well youre both out in the streets and you got no place to go  
  
Your constant battles are getting to be a bore  
So go somewhere else and continue your cream puff war
