I have to admit  
That noone could love me like you did  
And there were more laughs  
Than tears any day  
Like children at play  
But somewhere and somehow  
We lost each other  
  
How high did we goo  
When we loved each oother  
How high did we goo  
When we said we careharearehared  
For the first time Im scareared  
  
I have no regrets  
Lookin back  
I hold nothiing against you  
Cause I learned to love  
And thats more than most ever knowowow  
And I just cant belieieve  
That weve lost each other  
  
How high did we goo  
When we loved each oother  
How high did we goo  
When we said we careharearehareared  
For the first time Im scareared  
  
How high did we goohoho  
When we loved each oother  
How high did we goo  
When we said we careharearehared
