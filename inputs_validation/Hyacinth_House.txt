What are they doing in the Hyacinth House  
What are they doing in the Hyacinth House  
To please the lions in this day  
  
I need a brand new friend who doesnt bother me  
I need a brand new friend who doesnt trouble me  
I need someone and who doesnt need me  
  
I see the bathroom is clear  
I think that somebodys near  
Im sure that someone is following me oh yeah  
  
Why did you throw the Jack of Hearts away  
Why did you throw the Jack of Hearts away  
It was the only card in the deck that I had left to play  
  
And Ill say it again I need a brand new friend  
And Ill say it again I need a brand new friend  
And Ill say it again I need a brand new friend the end
