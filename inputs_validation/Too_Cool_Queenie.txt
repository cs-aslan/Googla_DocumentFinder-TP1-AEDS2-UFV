There was this girl  
Who lived not too long ago  
As a matter of fact I think  
She lives still  
She knew she could do no wrong  
Just singin those songs  
That we all knew  
  
She would always crash the party  
It was no surprise  
It was for her  
  
Too Cool Queenie  
  
There was this boy  
He played in a rocknroll band  
And he wasnt halfbad  
At saving the world  
She said he could do no right  
So he took his life  
His story is true  
  
Its OK cause what goes around comes around  
Its all right cause what goes around comes around  
  
And now this girl  
Yeah she got real famous  
And she made lots of money and  
Some of his too  
But still she thinks she can do no wrong  
Just playing those songs  
Shes all too cool
