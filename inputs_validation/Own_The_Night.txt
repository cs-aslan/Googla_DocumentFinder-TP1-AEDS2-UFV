Feeling the heat  
I cant keep  
The pressure off me  
Hear the man say  
Earn your pay  
Or Ill let you go today  
  
But thats not for me  
I was born to be alive  
Not livin to survive  
Come closer to me baby  
Make me believe it I can  
  
Own the night  
Reach up and touch the light  
Own the night  
You make me come alive  
I own the night  
  
Here in the dark  
Turn it on  
Love me forever like this  
Baby dont stop  
Make it hot  
I want to taste your burn again  
  
Take me away  
To a place Ive never known  
Livin right down to the bone  
Closer to me baby  
Make me believe it I can  
  
Own the night  
Reach up and touch the light  
love still shines  
Own the night  
You make me come alive  
I own the night  
  
You make me feel  
I own the night  
  
Own the night  
Touch the light  
love still shines  
Own the night  
  
repeat to end
