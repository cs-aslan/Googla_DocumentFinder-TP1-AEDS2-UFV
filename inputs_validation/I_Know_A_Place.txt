Bado scoobado scoobadobadobado Oh woyoyowhy  
When the whole world lets you down  
And theres nowhere for you to turn  
Cause all of your best friends have let you down dooown  
Then you try to accumulate  
But the whole world is full of hate  
So all of your best starts just drift into space  
I know a place where we can carry on  
I know a place where we can carry on  
We can carry on we can carry on  
We can carry on we can carry on  
And there is people like you people like me  
People need to be free  
And theres a place in the sun  
Where there is love for everyone  
Where we can be yeah  
I know a place where we can carry on  
I know a place where we can carry on  
We can carry on we can carry on  
We can carry on we can carry on  
Wheee  
When the whole world let you down  
And theres nowhere for you to turn  
Cause all of your best friends athey have let you down downownown  
Then you try to accumulate  
But the whole world is full of hate  
So all of your best starts just drift into space  
I know a place where we can carry on  
I know a place where we can carry on  
We can carry on we can carry on  
We can carry on we can carry on  
We can carry on we can carry on  
We can carry on we can carry on  
fadeout
