Drinkin again and thinkin of when when you loved me  
Im havin a few and wishin that you were here  
  
Makin the rounds accepting a round from strangers  
Bein a fool just hopin that youll appear  
  
Sure I can borrow a smoke maybe tell some joker a bad joke  
But nobody laughs they dont laugh at a broken heart  
  
Oh yeah Im drinkin again its always the same  
That same old story  
After the kicks theres little old mixedup me  
Tryin to lose a dream that used to be  
  
Look at me Im drinkin again drinkin all over town  
Yeah Im drinkin again
