Wait a minute  
This is where I draw the line  
Tell me whats got into you  
Cuz apparently youve lost your mind  
Repetitious fault just cant be overlooked  
So Im reading you your rights in case  
You misunderstood  
  
The first time a mistake  
Second time a bad decision  
Third time there wont be one  
Cuz I wont let you do that to me  
  
The first time a mistake  
Second time a bad decision  
Third time honey dream on  
Cuz I wont let you do that to me  
  
Dont think I havent checked out  
All your alibies  
And the evidence concludes  
That youre just telling me half the truth  
Still I keep giving you  
The benefit of doubt  
Cuz I fell so deep in love with you  
I struggle to get around  
So if you wanna be down for me  
Im gonna be down for you  
And if twice you break the rules  
Ive got to move on  
You believed your first time  
Cost you 25 years to life  
But I wont wait for a third heartbreak  
With my heart its only two  
  
The first time a mistake  
Second time a bad decision  
Third time there wont be one  
Cuz I wont let you do that to me  
  
I dont believe you would mistake me for a fool  
So if youre really smart you better think twice  
Before you move  
Ill be too busy watching to hear a word you say  
Just dont make the same mistake again  
And everythings ok  
  
The first time a mistake  
Second time a bad decision  
Third time there wont be one  
Cuz I wont let you do that to me  
  
The first time a mistake  
Second time a bad decision  
Third time there wont be one  
Cuz I wont let you do that to me
