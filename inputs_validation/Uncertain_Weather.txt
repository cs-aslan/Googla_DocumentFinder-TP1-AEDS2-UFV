A day of uncertain weather  
Captured in a frame forever  
A face in a faded photograph  
  
He must have had a life  
Maybe with a family  
And people who meant everything to him  
  
A sinner a saint a soldier  
Caught up in a war he never  
Had a chance to start or build a life  
  
All gone long ago  
Leaving no trace  
Disappearing like smoke in the wind  
To become just a face without a name  
Leaving no trace  
Disappearing like smoke in the wind  
  
Hopes and fears important plans  
Forgotten memories  
Footsteps fading in the sand  
Schemes and dreams small and grand  
Nothing left to see  
Footsteps fading in the sand  
  
Someone who cast a shadow  
Maybe just a lazy man  
Doesnt make much difference now its true  
  
A day of uncertain weather  
Captured in a frame forever  
A face in a faded photograph  
  
All gone long ago  
Leaving no trace  
Disappearing like smoke in the wind  
To become just a face without a name  
One more to add to the total  
Of those never heard of again  
  
Yes hes gone just a face without a name  
Leaving no trace disappearing like smoke in the wind
