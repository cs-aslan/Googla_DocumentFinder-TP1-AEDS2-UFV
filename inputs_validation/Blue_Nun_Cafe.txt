Hes a devil Mama hes a lover  
And I know that I should run for cover  
Hes a looker and Mama hes lookin at me  
  
Well I know hes a real heart breaker  
A great pretender and a real love faker  
But Im gonna bring him to his knees  
  
Chorus  
I can read your mind by the words that you dont say  
You think Im thrown my young love away  
Well I was already gone when he called me today  
Were gonna meet at the Blue Nun Cafe  
  
Well the lights are low and its kinda hazy  
The musics loud and its kinda crazy  
But on Saturday night its the place to be  
  
Well Ill be there and Ill be his baby  
And Ill remember how to be a lady  
So Mama dont you worry about me  
  
Chorus
