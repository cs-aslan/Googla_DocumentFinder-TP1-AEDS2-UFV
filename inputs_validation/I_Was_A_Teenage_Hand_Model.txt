Cozied up to the toilet  
Face stuck to the floor  
I met expectations  
That I was tryin to ignore  
  
Job had such patience  
I wonder whats that like  
One hundred thousand million  
Thats what you like  
So I was thinkin  
  
So these cities are sprouting  
Like a spit in the eye  
And this world isnt waiting  
Its just passing me by  
  
I just peak in the window  
Lookin inside  
The butchers got a fork in your face  
Im standing alive  
And I was singin
