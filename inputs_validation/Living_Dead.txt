Same old wall still hanging tall  
Same old nail through my throat  
Eighteen years came along  
And this time I never  
I never saw my Love  
  
Im going insane  
THEY sold me to this little shop  
Where I remain  
  
Living Dead Im feeling like a Living Dead  
Living Dead two blue eyes in an empty head  
Dead Dead Dead  
  
Eighteen years came along  
And this time I never  
I never saw my Love  
This life is nothingness  
Life on a wall time to be called back to the Beyond  
  
Theres a rumour going around and around  
They say The Puppet Master  
Is gonna build another theater in London Town  
  
For Kids  
Run by his son and daughter  
Its gonna be a bloody mess  
  
Living Dead Im feeling like a Living Dead  
Living Dead living  
Forever on the same old wall  
Forever with that nail going through my throat  
  
All the children who see me in this shop  
They are scared of me they say Im looking sick  
My eyes follow them  
Never to be sold again  
  
Life is never fair life is air  
  
Will I ever see his eyes again  
Will I ever see him again  
  
Where is she now Where is he now
