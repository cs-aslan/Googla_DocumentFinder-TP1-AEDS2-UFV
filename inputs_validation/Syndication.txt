Wait a minute  
Dope new styles of rhyme not breakin science  
Down with the Rhyme Syndicate alliance  
Youre on the tip but in the crack of a whip  
You know the saying about ships and slips with a lip  
Youll be sunk while I be gettin drunk  
With the bottle of rose I keep in my trunk punk  
Dont try to get none know where Im comin from  
I dont care if you do got a gun  
You better step off before I go off  
And dont dare bug riff or show off  
Cause then I break hard you think Im a fanatic  
Speak my rhymes in English not breakin no mathematics  
Cause thats for other people boy I aint got em  
But in almost every other rhyme I can spot em  
Get off it get off the bandwagon  
Runnin the same old styles you keep draggin  
Everlast is here with rhymes ready to drop  
Hey yo here I go again  
Im the foreman of this rap this rhyme style construction  
Youre on the eve of destruction  
Wait a minute  
Keep on singin keep on singin 4x  
Step forward face up meet the grim reaper  
Youre aimin for the top as the ladder gets steeper  
To my man Divine I send this dedication  
To let him know that with his help I got a Syndication  
With the dope rhymes I write the styles I recite  
Dont follow this leader Im not your guiding light  
To the groove Im smooth like a hit from a buddha  
I might smoke an herb but I wont sniff or shoot up  
Not hangin with gangs or messin with thugs  
Not slingin no caine or dealin no drugs  
Cause Im straight like an arrow the path I follow is narrow  
On the rise Everlast will sore like a sparrow  
Through the sky so dont ask me why  
If youre dazed and confused you must be high  
So before you try and break make sure that youre sober  
Cause Ill snatch your crown boy then Ill destroy ya  
Wait a minute  
Keep on singin keep on singin 8x  
To all you new jack MCs writin your rhymes in haste  
Get dissed put out of business dont it seem like a race  
Face death your final breath jumpin up in my face  
Im a single not a pair not a deuce Im a ace  
As you hear the treble clack hear my bass tone kick  
Take three out in a snap like a flat hat trick  
Everlast is educated energized for endurance  
Properly protected with a 100 g insurance  
For my mouth mouth mouth  
Wet my whistle at a party with a Coke and a stout  
Take heed duck MCs cause Everlast has the clout  
So break north suckers the tops why I came  
Dont wanna hear beefin cryin or complainin  
From you or any other party or set  
The pied piper of rhyme its time to pay your debt  
Pay the piper the sniper who wanna get hyper  
On the microphone theres no other type of  
MC gettin with the E  
Down with Divine and DLC  
Def Lyric Creations on radio stations  
Everlast reigns supreme and Im in Syndication  
Wait a minute  
Keep on singin keep on singin 4x  
Hey yo come here lend me your ear  
Everlast is the name of me and my gear  
So get up get with it come on admit it  
The rhyme I just spoke you wish you did it  
Like I do and you tried to  
But Id quit while Im ahead if I were you  
But Im not Im givin all I got  
Get the girls on the floor make em hot to trot  
For the Caucasian Sensation theres no hesitation  
Everlast reigns supreme and Im in Syndication  
Wait a minute  
Keep on singin keep on singin  
Everlast is here with  
Rhymes ready to drop
