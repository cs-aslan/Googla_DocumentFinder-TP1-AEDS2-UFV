Dolly Parton  
Without a love to call my own my life was incomplete  
It seems I couldnt help but think that love was not for me  
But my life took on a different twist when I met me a man that I couldnt
resist  
I didnt know what all Id missed and Im a gettin happy  
Oh Im a gettin happy  
Yeah Im a gettin happy  all my lonely days are gone  
Im a gettin happy  no more lonely nights alone  
I got someone to call my own and now my life is like a song  
And he helps me sing along  Im a gettin happy  
Oh Im a gettin happy  
Oh people used to talk of love and I couldnt understand  
About the fire and the desire in lovin a good man  
Oh but now I know just what they meant since I met me a man that was Heaven
sent  
Wonder where the sadness went cause Im a gettin happy  
Oh Im a gettin happy  
Im a gettin happy  all my lonely days are gone  
Im a gettin happy  no more lonely nights alone  
I got someone to call my own and now my life is like a song  
And he helps me sing along  an Im a gettin happy  
Oh Im a gettin happy  whoo  
Yeah Im gettin happy  all my lonely days are gone  
Im a gettin happy  no more lonely nights alone  
I got someone to call my own now my life is like a song  
Got someone to sing along and Im a gettin happy  
Oh Im a gettin happy  
Hey hey Im a gettin happy  all my lonely days are gone  
Im a gettin happy  no more lonely nights alone  
Cause Im a gettin happy
