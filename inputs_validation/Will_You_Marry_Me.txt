I guess you sunk in oh yeah you made it in  
Now Im fumbling somewhere deep within  
Will I raise my glass or will you kick my ass  
Or will we fall down laughing laughing  
I know love is pain I know your lifes insane  
I want you anyway Ill probably complain  
Why would I subject myself to this kind of disaster  
A respectable ball and chain is all youre really after  
But Im tumbling inside this reeling feeling coming over me  
Will you ever decide So unrevealing will you marry me  
Strange behavior from my savior  
You yank me up and down just like a yoyo  
Do you love me Youre an anomaly  
Or maybe you are just unbelievably ordinary  
Why would I subject myself to this kind of disaster  
A respectable ball and chain is all youre really after  
But Im tumbling inside this reeling feeling coming over me  
Will you ever decide So unrevealing will you marry me  
Im tumbling inside Im happiest when you are next to me  
But Im still on the outside am I obsessed or will you marry me
