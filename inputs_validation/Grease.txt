I solve my problems and I see the light  
We got a lovin thing we gotta feed it right  
There aint no danger we can go to far  
We start believing now that we can be what we are  
  
Grease is the word  
  
They think our love is just a growing pain  
Why dont they understand Its just a crying shame  
Their lips are lying only real is real  
We stop the fight right now we got to be what feel  
Grease is the word its the word that you heard  
Its got groove its got meaning  
Grease is the time is the place is the motion  
Grease is the way we are feeling  
  
We take the pressure and we throw away  
Conventionalitly belongs to yesterday  
There is a chance that we can make it so far  
We start believing now but we can be who we are  
  
Grease is the word  
Its got groove its got meaning  
Grease is the time is the place is the motion  
Grease is the way we are feeling  
  
This is the life of illusion  
Right trouble laced with confusion  
What are we doing  
  
We take the pressure and we throw away  
Conventionality belongs to yesterday  
There is a chance that we can make it so far  
We start believing now that we can be who we are  
  
Grease is the word  
Its got groove its got meaning  
Grease is the time is the place is the motion  
Grease is the way we are feeling  
  
Grease is the word  
Its got groove its got meaning  
Grease is the time is the place is the motion  
Grease is the way we are feeling  
  
Grease is the word  
Is the word  
Is the word  
Is the word
