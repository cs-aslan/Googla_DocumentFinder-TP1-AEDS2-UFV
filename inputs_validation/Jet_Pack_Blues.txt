Verse 1  
I got those jet pack blues just like Judy  
The kind that makes June feel like September  
Im the last one that youll ever remember  
And Im trying to find my peace of mind  
Behind these twoway highway lines  
When the city goes silent  
The ringing in my ears gets violent  
  
PreChorus  
Shes in a long black coat tonight  
Waiting for me in the downpour outside  
Shes singing Baby come home in a melody of tears  
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time  
  
Chorus  
And I remember Baby come home  
And I remember Baby come home  
And I remember Baby come home  
And I remember Baby come home  
Did you ever love her Do you know  
Or did you never want to be alone  
And she was singing Baby come home  
Baby come home  
  
Verse 2  
Ive got those jet pack blues  
Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me  
Honey dont you leave  
Dont you remember how we used to split a drink  
It never mattered what it was I think  
Our hands were just that close  
The sweetness never lasted no  
  
PreChorus  
Shes in a long black coat tonight  
Waiting for me in the downpour outside  
Shes singing Baby come home in a melody of tears  
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time  
  
Chorus  
And I remember Baby come home  
And I remember Baby come home  
And I remember Baby come home  
And I remember Baby come home  
Did you ever love her Do you know  
Or did you never want to be alone  
And she was singing Baby come home  
Baby come home  
  
Bridge  
Shes in a long black coat tonight  
Waiting for me in the downpour outside  
Shes singing Baby come home in a melody of tears  
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time  
  
Outro  
And I remember Baby come home  
And I remember Baby come home  
And I remember Baby come home  
And I remember Baby come home  
Did you ever love her Do you know  
Or did you never want to be alone  
And she was singing Baby come home  
Baby come home
