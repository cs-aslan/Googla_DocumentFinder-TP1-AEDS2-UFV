OLD TIME ROCK AND ROLL  
Writers George Jackson Thomas Jones  
Just take those old records off the shelf  
Ill sit and listen to em by myself  
Todays music aint got the same soul  
I like that old time rock n roll  
Dont try to take me to a disco  
Youll never even get me out on the floor  
In ten minutes Ill be late for the door  
I like that old time rock n roll  
Still like that old time rock n roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock n roll  
Wont go to hear them play a tango  
Id rather hear some blues or funky soul  
Theres only one sure way to get me to go  
Start playing old time rock n roll  
Still like that old time rock n roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock n roll  
Call me a relic call me what you will  
Say Im oldfashioned say Im over the hill  
Todays music aint got the same soul  
I like that old time rock n roll  
Still like that old time rock n roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock n roll  
Still like that old time rock n roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock n roll  
Rock n roll  
Soothes the soul  
Days of old
