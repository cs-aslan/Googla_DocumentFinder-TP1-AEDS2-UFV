Good morning heartache you old gloomy sight  
Good morning heartache thought we said goodbye last night  
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone  
But here you are with the dawn  
  
Wish Id forget you but youre here to stay  
It seems I met you when my love went away  
Now everyday I start by saying to you  
Good morning heartache whats new  
  
Stop haunting me now  
Cant chase you no how  
Just leave me alone  
Ive got those Monday blues  
Straight through Sunday blues  
  
Good morning heartache here we go again  
Good morning heartache youre the one who knew me when  
Might as well get used to you hanging around  
Good morning heartache sit down  
  
Stop haunting me now  
Cant chase you no how  
Just leave me alone  
Ive got those Monday blues  
Straight through Sunday blues  
  
Good morning heartache here we go again  
Good morning heartache youre the one who knew me when  
Might as well get used to you hanging around  
Good morning heartache sit down
