Yes Im lonely hope you didnt catch it  
Dont want to be down where I last behaved  
I broke his heart now I cant patch it  
This time its grave  
I kept track of all the love that I gave him  
And on paper well it looked pretty good  
He left a note that said he couldnt stay here  
As if I could  
I guess my loves got no business no business calling his name  
I guess my loves got no business nobody to blame  
One of these days I thought wed get it together  
After all that boy was made for me  
But all he left me was a mouth full of feathers  
Little bird got free  
He always said my love was one sided  
I tried to keep up with supply and demand  
But there was one way that pie was divided  
It was a big piece plan  
I guess my loves got no business no business calling his name  
I guess my loves got no business nobody to blame  
Well now Im getting desperate baby getting illeagal  
I got the law doggies on my trail  
The hawks out and I could use an eagle  
To go my bail  
You say youre itching baby so go ahead and scratch it  
But if it jumps off dont look at me  
You swore to God that I couldnt catch it  
But your dogs got fleas  
I guess my loves got no business no business calling his name  
I guess my loves got no business nobody to blame
