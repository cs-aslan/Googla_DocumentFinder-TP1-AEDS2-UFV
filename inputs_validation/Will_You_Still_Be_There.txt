How many lives have been shaken  
cause a few simple actions were not taken  
There will be a time time for the next world  
Cant let the feelings be left unsaid  
Chorus  
Will you still be there when the night comes  
The glorys over and the chill comes  
When the night comes will you still be there  
Will you still be there when the night comes  
Will you still be there  
When the world seems to fall apart for us  
When all the hope has turned to desperation  
How can we torture torture the ones that we Love  
Cant let the feelings be left unsaid  
How many hearts have been broken  
How many have been broken in two  
cause a few simple words had not been spoken  
Not been spoken no no no  
Theres a need to know that were wanted  
That were wanted yeah yeah yeah  
Theres a need to know you care  
Need to know who cares for you yes we do
