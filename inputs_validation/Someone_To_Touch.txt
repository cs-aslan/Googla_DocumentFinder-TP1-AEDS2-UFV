Im an alley cat with only seven lives  
Im the trouble scratching at your door  
When the moon is bright and shining high  
Im getting loose just like the night before  
One for the money two for the show  
You cant resist it on a night like this  
Im the answer baby and you know  
Tonight youre mine forget the guy youre with  
  
Baby I dont care  
If I have to crawl an extra mile  
cause you can take me everywhere  
And youre the one I really need tonight  
  
Someone to touch  
I need a girl like you  
Someone to touch  
That somebody could be you  
  
Dont try to tell me that your daddys mean  
You think your mama wouldnt let me in  
Come on n step inside my dream machine  
Dont fight it honey you just cant win  
  
cause baby I dont care  
If I have to crawl an extra mile  
cause you can take me everywhere  
And youre the one I really need tonight  
  
Someone to touch  
I need a girl like you  
Someone to touch  
That somebody could be you  
Someone to touch  
I need a girl like you  
Someone to touch  
cmon baby I think its you
