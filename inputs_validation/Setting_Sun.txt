Your the devil in me that I brought in from the cold  
Your bodys still young and your mind is very old  
Your comin on strong and I like the way  
The visions we had are just fading away  
Youre part of the life that I never had  
You said that man its just too bad  
  
I see the animals and ask when the summer starts to call  
I hear theres happiness around which is banging down the hall  
Your part of my mind thats been and gone  
She said shed return and it wont be long  
Shes part of the life that I never had  
She said that man its just too bad  
  
I want the whole of my life to be something that I can see  
I want the whole of my life to be something that I can be  
  
Your comin on strong  
Your comin on strong  
  
Your comin on strong  
Your comin on strong  
  
Your the devil in me that I brought in from the cold  
Your bodys still young and your mind is very old  
Your comin on strong and I like the way  
The visions we had are just fading away  
Youre part of the life that I never had  
You said that man its just too bad  
  
I want the whole of my life to be something that I can see  
I want the whole of my life to be something that I can be  
  
Your comin on strong  
Your comin on strong  
  
Your comin on strong  
Your comin on strong
