Every time I see you looking my way  
Baby baby cant you hear my heartbeat  
In the park or walking down the high way  
Baby baby cant you hear my heartbeat  
  
And when you move up closer to me  
I get a feeling thats oowee  
  
Cant you hear the pounding of my heartbeat  
Cause youre the one I love youre the one I love  
  
When I feel you put your arms around me  
Baby baby cant you hear my heartbeat  
Then Im glad Im mighty glad you found me  
Baby baby cant you hear my heartbeat  
  
And when you asked me to meet your ma  
I knew that baby wed be goin far  
  
Cant you hear the pounding of my heartbeat  
Cause youre the one I love youre the one I love  
  
All my friends are crying out to meet you  
Baby baby cant you hear my heartbeat  
Nows the time to go and see the preacher  
Baby baby cant you hear my heartbeat  
  
Now wedding bells are going to chime  
And baby baby youre gonna be mine  
  
Cant you hear the pounding of my heartbeat  
Cause youre the one I love youre the one I love  
  
Baby baby cant you hear my heartbeat  
  
Ah  
Ah  
Oh  
Oh
