Stand aside loose your pride  
Im at the gates alone  
Sourcery blasphemy  
All welcome in my home  
Im leaving  
But soon Im coming back  
Believe me  
Im hot on your tracks  
Through the night  
Eagles flight  
The Angels kiss my brow  
Tempting me with studded heels  
The bitch is in heat now  
Oh youve got me  
That leather smells so sweet  
Im on fire  
Breeding sin breathing lust  
Witches spell ohhh  
Women Leather and Hell  
Go for it  
Come on turn that mother up  
Dynamite is right on time  
Sends shivers down my spine  
Destiny wont catch me  
The choice of death is mine  
Salvation is keeping out of sight  
Damnation is joining in the fight
