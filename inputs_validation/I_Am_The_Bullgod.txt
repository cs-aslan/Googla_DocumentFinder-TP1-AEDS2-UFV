Chorus  
I am the Bullgod  
I am free and I feed  
On all that is forsaken  
  
Im gonna get you  
I see through you  
Im gonna get youuu  
  
Im like a train I roll hard lettin off much steam  
In the cutoff flanel and the dusty jeans baby  
I never was cool with James Dean but I be hangin tough  
With my man Jim Beam  
  
I swing low like a chimp back in 86  
Then I was seein a shrink  
But now Im humble and I can only think  
About New Orleans and those jumbo shrimp  
  
So ask no questions and I tell no lies  
I got big old pupils and bloodshot eyes  
Im on the brink if you know what I mean  
And the twelve step program couldnt keep me clean  
  
Cause Im the Bullgod you understand  
The illegitimate son of man  
The TOP to the DOG or the POT to the GOD  
And Im trippin  
  
Unh huh huh said Im trippin  
  
Chorus  
  
A lot of people poke fun and thats alright  
But when I start pokin back they get all uptight uh  
You cant cap with the master son  
So sit your ass down fore I blast you one  
  
Cause Im so greasy you can call me mud  
And I feel a little hate running through my blood  
I want to flood the world with my twisted thoughts  
You can bid all day but I cant be bought  
  
Uh break it up lets tie one on  
I gotta get set to go and cut the lawn  
So I grab my Walkman but before I cut  
I go behind the garage and fire it up  
  
Cause Im the Bullgod you understand  
The illegitimate son of man  
The TOP to the DOG or the POT to the GOD  
And Im trippin  
  
Huh huh said Im trippin Didnt you know  
  
Chorus  
  
Forsaken  
  
PshYou aint nothinAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Come on get em up  
Come on get em up  
Come on get em up  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah  
  
I get a feeling of peace  
From a low so high  
As I sit in my chair and watch life go by  
These thoughts I have I cant mold the sense  
  
Through the forest of my mind theyre all past tense  
Born and raised in the outer lands  
And at times you could say Im out of hand  
Im in a band of gypsies were on the run  
  
Every time that paper hits my tongue  
And sometimes it seems so odd  
When my veins are poppin and Im on the nod  
I am the Bullgod you understand  
And here in my hand is my master plan  
  
Im gonna get you  
I see through you  
Im gonna get you  
I see through you
