Theyre walking by the night  
The moon has frozen blue  
Long black coats a shelter for the rain  
Their load must get through  
Now bats are leaving their trees  
Theyre joining the call  
Seven satanic Hell preachers heading for the hall  
Bringing the blood of a newborn child  
Got to succeed if not its Satans fall  
  
Way out in Egypt in the valley of kings  
Where the mummified pharaohs  
Pretend dead in their sleep  
Dont touch never ever steal  
Unless youre in for the kill  
Or youll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs  
Yes youll be hit and the curse is on you  
  
The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly  
Just destroying your future  
Makin it all shady  
Dont touch never ever steal  
Unless youre in for the kill for the kill  
Or youll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs  
Yes youll be hit and the curse is on you  
  
Listen Im a corpse Im a corpse  
Im a corpse without soul  
Satan hes taken hes taken  
Hes taken his toll  
And he took it on me  
  
I Im trapped Im trapped  
Im trapped in his spell  
Tonight Im going Im going  
Im going to Hell inside his spell  
  
Howl like a wolf  
And a witch will open the door  
Follow me and meet our high priestess  
Come come into my coven  
And become Lucifers child  
  
Undress until youre naked  
And put on this white coat  
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring  
Come come into my coven  
And become Lucifers child  
  
I was born on the cemetery  
Under the sign of the moon  
Raised from my grave by the dead  
And I was made a mercenary  
In the legions of Hell  
Now Im king of pain Im insane  
  
You know my only pleasure  
Is to hear you cry  
Id love to hear you cry  
Id love to see you die  
And Ill be the first  
To watch your funeral  
And Ill be the last to leave  
Id love to hear you cry  
  
And when youre down beyond the ground  
Ill dig up your body again  
And make love to shame  
Oh lady cry and say goodbye goodbye  
Oh lady cry and say goodbye  
Youve gotta say goodbye  
Cause I will eat your mind
