Im goin down Louisiana way  
I was born down Louisiana way  
Im goin back as of this very day  
Dont worry about me cause Ill be okay  
I was born down Louisiana way  
Im goin down Louisiana way  
  
I will miss all my old Chicago friends  
And think about you San Francisco now and then  
I will remember my compadres in LA  
Look me up down Louisiana way  
  
Im goin down Louisiana way  
I was born down Louisiana way  
Im goin back as of this very day  
Dont worry about me cause Ill be okay  
I was born down Louisiana way  
Im goin down Louisiana way  
  
Dont let your eyes get misty now  
We knew the time would come around for me to go  
I will miss you  
  
So long my friend guess Ill see you while ago  
I might be back sometime you just never know  
I have left a sweet heart north of Whiskey Bay  
True love waits down Louisiana way  
  
Im goin down Louisiana way  
I was born down Louisiana way  
Im goin back as of this very day  
Dont worry about me cause Ill be okay  
I was born down Louisiana way  
Im goin down Louisiana way
