I know where Im going  
And Ive got all my cards showing  
Im like the crow flies a straight line  
Reaching for the other side  
  
I dig the sand they kick at me with a calm that stuns  
Tracing time with no alibis makes me makes me realize  
  
Its okay its just a dream I had  
That theres something out there  
Something just out of reach  
  
Armed with time on my side  
And a field of vision miles wide  
Ill keep searching for some meaning  
Whatever makes me feel alive  
  
Its okay its just a dream I had  
That theres something out there  
Something just out of reach  
  
Today I felt something so strong it took my breath away  
Now I long  
To live like this everyday  
Ill find it some way  
  
Im alive with so much of life to try  
Ive got no memories of what used to worry me  
  
Its okay its just a dream I had  
That theres something out there  
Something just out of reach  
Someday Ill reach  
Its okay its just a dream I had  
That theres something out there  
Something just out of reach  
Just out of reach just out of reach
