Old man looks much younger now  
He lost his strength respect somehow  
Look in the mirror at what I found  
Its just the past and its over now  
  
Ooh its over now  
Ooh its over now  
  
My hearts like a wheel  
Heads just a stone  
I got my memories  
Aint got no home  
  
Fallin  
Ooh fallin apart at the seams  
Fallin  
Ooh yeah fallin apart at the seams  
  
Old friends seem much closer now  
They stand the test of time somehow  
Look at the winner who hit the ground  
It comes around and then it goes back down  
  
Ooh its over now  
Ooh its over now  
  
My hearts like a wheel  
Heads just a stone  
I got no memories  
Aint got no home  
  
Fallin  
Ooh fallin apart at the seams  
Fallin  
Ooh yeah fallin apart at the seams  
  
My hearts like a wheel  
Heads just a stone  
I got my memories  
Aint got no home  
  
Fallin  
Ooh fallin apart at the seams  
Fallin  
Ooh yeah fallin apart at the seams  
  
Fallin  
Im fallin fallin  
Fallin  
Ooh yeah ooh yeah
