Right now hes looking for his pants and socks  
Cant find the car keys on the dresser top  
Hell spill his milk and leave it in the kitchen floor  
And as the day wears on hell miss me more and more  
Hell go to work without a kiss from me itll cross his mind he siad Id never
leave  
Forget his coat and catch a deaf of core  
And as the day wears on hell miss me more and more  
 dobro   
Hell tell the guys hes bothered not at all  
Then drink his lunch so he wont have to call  
Hell tell himself Im home like the day before  
But as the day wears on hell doubt it more and more  
Hell come home to a house thats dark and quiet  
And has to face another sleepless night  
Hell watch TV and read and walk the floor  
And as the day wears on hell miss me more and more  
And then hell phone and ask me to come home  
That things have gone to pieces cause Im gone  
His phonecall is all Im waiting for  
Cause as the day wears on Ill miss me more and more  
Cause as the day wears on Ill miss me more and more
