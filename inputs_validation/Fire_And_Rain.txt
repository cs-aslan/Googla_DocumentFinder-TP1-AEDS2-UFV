Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone  
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you  
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song  
But I just cant remember who to send it to  
Ive seen fire and Ive seen rain  
Ive seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
Ive seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now  
But I always thought that Id see you again  
Wont you look down upon me jesus  
You gotta help me make a stand  
You just got to see me through another day  
My bodys achin and my time is at hand  
I wont make it any other way  
Ive seen fire and Ive seen rain  
Ive seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
Ive seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now  
But I always thought that Id see you again  
Ive been walkin my mind to an easy time  
My back turned towards the sun  
Lord knows when the cold wind blows itll turn your head around  
But theres hours of time on the telephone line  
To talk about things to come  
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground  
Ive seen fire and Ive seen rain  
Ive seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
Ive seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now now now  
But I always thought that Id see you again
