I just dont know how to talk to you  
There aint much that I want to get through  
Just stare at you in silence thats okay  
Like a dog outside your window in the rains  
Youre horse mounts so high that I cant see  
The distance that I fall each time you leave  
Without the sentences that keep you quiet  
And stop me at the line  
So go on out in that heat so familiar  
Just go on and bring some sun back with you  
Bring some sun back with you yeah  
Go on out and bring some sun back with you yeah  
Could you give me just a minute of me needs  
Youve seen me at my worst in its degrees  
The garbage growing deep around my toes  
Got nothing going for me but my nose  
I got a thing going with old Jesus Christ  
He keeps me up from sleeping straight at night  
And I need to tell you something about the baggage  
If I can find the language  
cause she walks like a cello in good vibrations  
Metered and deadly til I cant help but cave in  
Bring some sun back with you yeah  
Go on out and bring some sun back with you yeah  
Im speaking rhythms and rhymes  
And meters and times that I should understand  
But this big old tongue  
Should have stoped not begun  
Thats why I do not what I say  
That stuff cant give me away  
So go on out in that heat so familiar  
Just be sure to bring the sun back with you  
Bring some sun back with you yeah  
Bring some sun back with you yeah  
Bring some sun back with you yeah
