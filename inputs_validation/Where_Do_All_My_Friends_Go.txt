When lightning strikes and we are sleeping  
Tell me where my friends go  
When everyone around is dreaming  
Tell me where my friends go  
When children arent children no more  
Tell me where my friends go  
When parents arent behind the door  
Tell me where my friends go  
When footballs over and the beers gone  
Tell me where my friends go  
When TV set no longer turns on  
Tell me where my friends go  
  
If I could float and drift forever  
Tell me where my friends go  
Id join the shattered dreams together  
Tell me where my friends go  
Id spy upon the disbelievers  
Tell me where my friends to  
And scatter them into the seasons  
Tell me where my friends go  
When winter comes Ill keep on moving  
Tell me where my friends go  
To fill the cup of understanding  
Tell me where my friends go  
Id fly tell me where my friends go  
To hidden places in the sky  
Tell me where my friends go  
My hesitation  
Is strong today  
The indications  
All point away  
To somethin better  
For everyone  
Has something gone astray  
  
Ill follow you until I die  
Tell me where my dreams go  
With outstretched arms into the sky  
Tell me where my dreams go  
When all is said and come undone  
Tell me where my dreams go  
The words have come the words have come  
Tell me where my dreams go  
Well chase the ghosts into the shadows  
Tell me where my dreams go  
The spectres watch through every window  
Tell me where my dreams go  
Well run like dogs and jump the fences  
Tell me where my dreams go  
And howl at men behind their faces  
Tell me where my dreams go  
Well bark at night and wake the neighbors  
Tell me where my dreams go  
And tell the world of our adventures  
Tell me where my dreams go  
My hesitation  
Is strong today  
The indications  
All point away  
To somethin better  
For everyone  
Has something gone astray  
  
My revelations  
Have lost control  
My better judgment  
Has gone away  
Our evolution  
Is full of holes  
Has something gone astray  
  
Tell me where my friends go  
Tell me where my friends go  
Tell me where my friends go  
Tell me where my friends go  
Tell me where my friends go  
Tell me where my friends go  
Tell me where my friends go  
Tell me where my friends go  
Tell me where my friends go  
Tell me where my friends go
