I can hardly bear the sight of lipstick on the cigarettes there in the ashtray  
Lyin cold the way you left em but at least your lips caressed them while  
You packed  
Or the lipprint on a halffilled cup of coffee that you poured and didnt
drink  
But at least you thought you wanted it thats so much more than I can say  
For me  
  
What a good year for the roses  
Many blooms still linger there  
The lawn could stand another mowin  
Funny I dont even care  
As you turn to walk away  
As the door behind you closes  
The only thing I have to say  
Its been a good year for the roses  
  
After three full years of marriage its the first time that you havent  
Made the bed  
I guess the reason were not talkin theres so little left to say we  
Havent said  
While a million thoughts go racin through my mind I find I havent said a
word  
From the bedroom the familiar sound of a babys cryin goes unheard  
  
What a good year for the roses  
Many blooms still linger there  
The lawn could stand another mowin  
Funny I dont even care  
As you turn to walk away  
As the door behind you closes  
The only thing I have to say  
Its been a good year for the roses
