By your leave I think that Ill be going now  
I think Ive stayed a little long  
I looked up all my mothers recipes  
I cant think what I did wrong  
  
We go to a restaurant but you dont like wine  
You say its love you want but there is no time  
I realize I can see it in your eyes  
You keep staring at the floor  
  
I used to look at your school photographs  
But I dont have them anymore  
I wonder whos in my old college rooms  
Or stuck on my old locker door  
  
I dream of the ships at sea on a stormy night  
I wish that it was me but I wake in fright  
I realize I can see it in your eyes  
Ive only got myself to blame  
  
Winter kisses when your lips were blue  
Like chasing wild geese in the snow  
Pressing faces on the window panes  
But thats a long long time ago  
  
We go to a restaurant  
You say its love you want  
I realize I can see it in your eyes  
Youre moving on to something more
