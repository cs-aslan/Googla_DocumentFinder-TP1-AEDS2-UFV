Spotlight glaring down  
Silence from the crowd  
The circus is just beginning  
I tremble looking around  
I would hate to fall and hit the ground  
In front of all these people  
That wouldnt be pleasant  
So the music plays  
And the trapeze sways  
And my heart is beating faster  
But all I hear is laughter  
From the crowd  
Cause they see right through my gaze  
Would you please tell me  
What I gotta be  
For you to want me  
For you to want me yeah  
Cause I am  
Just trying to understand  
Why you dont love me  
Why you dont love me for me  
There is someone who loves you for you  
I keep lying to myself  
Trying to be somebody else  
In front of all these people  
I feel really foolish  
And when the main attraction at the masquerade  
If I keep goin like this Im gonna go insane  
Is this circus act all Ill ever be  
Yeah  
Would you please tell me  
What I gotta be  
For you to want me  
For you to want me yeah  
Cause I am  
Just playing a losing hand  
If you dont love me  
If you dont love me for me  
There is someone who loves you for you  
God loves you and me  
Let me tell you its the kind of love thats given free  
And it doesnt fake  
And it doesnt flake  
And it doesnt play those games  
God loves me and you  
Let me tell you its the kind of love  
Its real its true  
And it doesnt lie  
And its doesnt cheat  
After it takes you off your feet  
So just tell me  
What I gotta be  
For you to want me  
For you to want me yeah  
Cause I am  
Just trying to understand  
Why you dont love me  
Why you dont love me for me  
Tell me  
What I gotta be  
For you to want me  
For you to want me yeah  
Cause I am  
Just playing a losing hand  
If you dont love me  
If you dont love me for me  
repeat 2 times

God is someone who loves you for you
