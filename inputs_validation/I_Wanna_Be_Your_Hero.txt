I want to be your hero  
Ill be a trick of the light  
I want to be your hero  
Ill be your heat in the night  
Hold tight  
Cause I like what I see  
Ya excite  
You put your finger on me  
Youre not too shy  
You put a sting in my tail  
A magic ride  
And Ima hot on your trail  
  
You know  
Ya got something I want  
Ya got something I need  
Yeah  
I got something to say  
Im on my way  
Hot licks on the tip of my tongue  
Electric you turn your headlight on  
  
Ya know  
Ya got something I want  
Ya got something I need  
Yeah  
I got something to say  
Im on my way  
  
Oh yeah  
Get up and go  
  
I want to be your hero  
I want to be your hero  
Ill be a trick of the light  
I want to be your hero  
I want to be your hero  
In the heat of the night  
Ahold tight  
I like what I see  
Oh  
  
Just one night  
Thats all Im asking from you too  
  
Ya got something I want  
Ya got something I need  
I got something to say  
Im on my way  
  
Ooh yeah  
Get up and go  
  
I want to be your hero  
I want to be your hero  
Ill be a trick of the light  
I want to be your hero  
I want to be your hero  
I want to be your hero  
I want to be your hero  
I want to be your hero  
I want to be your hero
