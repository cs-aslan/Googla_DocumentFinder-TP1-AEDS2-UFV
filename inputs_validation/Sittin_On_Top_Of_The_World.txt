Never seen a sky so blue  
Ive never been happy with anyone  
Like I am when Im with you  
Look at the sun shining up in the sky  
  
I feel a little closer to heaven baby  
When Im looking into your eyes  
And as long as were together boy  
Im sitting on top of the world  
  
Want to feel this way forever boy  
Im sitting on top of the world  
Last night I lay in the dark  
Tryin to figure it out  
  
Tryin to talk to my heart  
But now its morning and I still dont know why  
All I know is that you got me feeling so good  
All I know is that it feels the way that true love should  
  
Aint no one luckier than you and I  
And as long as were together boy  
Im sitting on top of the world  
Want to feel this way forever boy  
  
Im sitting on top of the world  
And everybodys got an opinion bout how this should be  
But they dont understand it  
No no they just cant see  
  
That I belong with you and baby Baby  
Baby you belong with me  
And as long as were together boy  
Im sitting on top of the world  
  
Want to feel this way forever boy  
Im sitting on top of the world
