Jim doesnt ever bring me pretty flowers  
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours  
Dont know why Im so crazy for Jim  
  
Jim never tells me Im his hearts desire  
I never seem to set his love afire  
Gone are the years Ive wasted on him  
Sometimes when I get feelin low  
I say lets call it quits  
Then I hang on and let him go  
Breakin my heart in bits  
  
Someday I know that Jim will up and leave me  
But even if he does you can believe me  
Ill go on carrying the torch for Jim  
  
Ill go on lovin my Jim
