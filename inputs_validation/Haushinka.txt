Haushinka is a girl with a peculiar name  
I met her on the eve of my birthday  
Did she know did she know before she went away does she know  
But its too damn late  
This girl has gone far away  
Now shes gone  
All I have now is a memory to date  
A cheap hat and cigarettes and a peculiar name  
I didnt know I didnt know before she went away  
I know now I know now and its too damn late  
Will she ever find her way  
Im too damn young to be too late but am I  
Yet again Im kicking myself and Ill be here in battle scars waiting for
you  
Waiting for you now
