Is there a way out of this  
If there is I dont see it  
Can heaven and hell coexist  
Not when both battle for dominance  
  
Brush back my tears and he said girl  
We have to soldier on  
Yes girl even when we dont feel strong  
So how many young men have to lay down  
Their life and their love of their woman  
For some sick promise of a heaven  
  
Lies go back now to the garden  
Even the four horses say all bets are off  
  
Were on the dark side of the sun  
Were on the dark side of the sun  
Were on the dark side of the sun  
  
Soon therell be fast food on the moon  
Painted in neon with For Sale signs up  
You say Im more afraid of what  
Tomorrow could bring to us  
  
Brushed back my tears and he said girl  
You have to soldier on  
Yes girl even when you dont feel strong  
  
So how many young men have to lay down  
Their life and their love of their woman  
For some sick promise of a heaven  
  
Bushes burn there on the mountain  
Abraham and Ishmael turn back the clock  
  
Were on the dark side of the sun  
Were on the dark side of the sun  
  
Were on the dark side of the sun
