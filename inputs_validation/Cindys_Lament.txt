Listen here  
You dont have to love me always Cindy  
You dont need to see me every day of the week  
You dont have to notice my brand new shoes  
But please please say hello some time  
  
You know Ive tried to impress you Cindy  
I even lent ya my library book  
I guess you forgot good God you soon forgot it woman  
I dont mind but please say hello some time  
  
And your mother she cant stand my face  
And your brother keeps me from your door  
But Ill stay around yes Ill stay around honey  
Ill even watch over your garden fence  
  
Ive watched your friends Cindy laugh in my face  
But I wont apologize for the way that I am  
If only they knew baby yes if only they knew  
That youve already spent one night with me honey
