I sold my soul to rock n roll when it didnt cost a thing  
Stacks of scratched up 45s and taught myself how to sing  
What does it take to be a rock n roll hero just like the king  
Livin your life in a blaze of glory burnin it up in a smoke filled club  
Givin your soul to the world  
  
Chorus  
  
Like a rock n roll hero a soldier of fortune in the night  
Like a rock n roll hero when the white hot lights cut through the night  
And the sound of the thunder starts roaring  
Thats when you know what youre savin it for  
And youre feeling like a rock n roll hero  
  
I owe it all to rock n roll and I wouldnt want to change a thing  
Got this old guitar strapped round my neck and my baby waitin in the wings  
  
What does it take to be a rock n roll hero just like the king  
Livin your life in a blaze of glory a spark in your eyes  
A flame in your soul givin it all to the world  
  
chorus  
  
Yes youre feeling like oh youre feeling like  
  
chorus  
  
Like a rock n roll hero like a rock n roll hero
