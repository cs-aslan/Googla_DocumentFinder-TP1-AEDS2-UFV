HARD ACT TO FOLLOW  
WRITERS DAVID CHAMBERLAIN GARY NICHOLSON  
My leading lady is gone  
And its so hard to go on  
Without the part she played  
My lifes just an empty stage  
Shes a hard act to follow  
I thought Id find somebody by now  
Shes a hard act to follow  
Her leavin brought the whole house down  
She was so right for the part  
The way she fit into my heart  
After the love she gave  
Who could ever take her place  
Shes a hard act to follow  
I thought Id find somebody by now  
Shes a hard act to follow  
Her leavin brought the whole house down  
Shes a hard act to follow  
I thought Id find somebody by now  
Shes a hard act to follow  
Her leavin brought the whole house down
