I Live To Know You  
  
Standing in our presence  
Lord my heart and life are changed  
Just to love You and to live to  
See Your beauty and Your grace  
  
Heaven and earth cry out Your name  
Nations rise up and seek Your face  
And Your Kingdom is established  
As I live to know You more  
Now I will never be the same  
Spirit of God my life Youve changed  
And Ill forever sing Your praise  
I live to know You Lord  
I live to know You Lord  
  
Youve called me I will follow  
Your will for me Im sure  
Let your heart beat feel my hearts cry  
Let me live to serve your call  
  
Heaven and earth cry out Your name  
Nations rise up and seek Your face  
And Your Kingdom is established  
As I live to know You more  
Now I will never be the same  
Spirit of God my life Youve changed  
And Ill forever sing Your praise  
I live to know You Lord  
I live to know You Lord  
  
Heaven and earth cry out Your name  
Nations rise up and seek Your face  
And Your Kingdom is established  
As I live to know You more  
Now I will never be the same  
Spirit of God my life Youve changed  
And Ill forever sing Your praise  
I live to know You Lord  
I live to know You Lord  
  
Now I will never be the same  
Spirit of God my life Youve changed  
And Ill forever sing Your praise  
I live to know You Lord  
I live to know You Lord  
I live to know You Lord  
I live to know You Lord
