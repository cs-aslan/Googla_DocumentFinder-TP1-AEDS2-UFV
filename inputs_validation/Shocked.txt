Tell me Im only dreaming and Ill believe you  
Cant see how this could be true  
Surrounded by feelings I hardly recognise  
I look for explanations Im taken by surprise  
If you told me yesterday that I could feel this way  
I would sure enough call you a liar to your face  
  
Chorus  
Because Im shocked by the power  
Shocked ooh  
Shocked by the power of love  
I was rocked to my very foundations  
Shocked by the power shocked by the power  
  
Maybe this time tomorrow  
Ill discover this aint really real  
cause it struck me like lightning  
Like a bolt out of the blue  
Emotions inside me all over you  
Im high above the Universe losing track of time  
And falling free  
I cant believe that you are really mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Shocked like the lightning from up above  
Down from the heavens and it gave me love  
From a man who respects me  
Loves my mind as well as my body  
No retreat and no surrender  
Equal to you regardless of gender  
Giving me love that is warm and tender  
Thats why I gotta tell ya  
  
You and I are of the same mind  
It seems to me that were one of a kind  
Its true to say that when love is blind  
But then true love is so hard to find  
You respect me and the things I do  
It was meant to be  
I was made for you  
Open the door to my heart its stopped  
And Im shocked  
  
Chorus  
  
Surrounded by feelings I hardly recognise  
I look for explanations Im taken by surprise  
Cause it struck me like lightning  
Like a bolt out of the blue  
Emotions inside me all over you  
  
Chorus until fade
