In Santa Monica in the winter time  
The lazy streets so undemanding  
I walk into the crowd  
In Santa Monica you get your coffee from  
The coolest places on the promenade  
Where people dress just so  
Beauty so unavoidable  
Everywhere you turn  
Its there  
I sit and wonder what am I doing here  
  
But on the telephone line I am anyone  
I am anything I want to be  
I could be a supermodel or Norman Mailer  
And you wouldnt know the difference  
Or would you  
  
In Santa Monica all the people got  
Modern names  
Like Jake or Mandy  
And modern bodies too  
In Santa Monica on the boulevard  
Youll have to dodge those inline skaters  
Or theyll knock you down  
I never felt so lonely  
Never felt so out of place  
I never wanted something more than this  
  
But on the telephone line I am anyone  
I am anything I want to be  
I could be a supermodel or Norman Mailer  
And you wouldnt know the difference  
On the telephone line I am any height  
I am any age I want to be  
I could be a caped crusader or  
Space invader  
And you would know the difference  
Or would you
