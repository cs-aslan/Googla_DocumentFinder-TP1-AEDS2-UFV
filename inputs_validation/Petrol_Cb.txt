Shut your mouth for the winter  
If your boyfriend listens  
Were building a relation  
For the music shakes it  
  
Theres that song again  
Theres that song again  
Theres that song again  
Theres that song again  
  
How come I could not cheat  
If youre a colorful lover  
I dont mind being one of them  
I dont mind my big deal  
  
Its been thrown away again  
Its been thrown away again  
Its been thrown away again  
Its been thrown away again
