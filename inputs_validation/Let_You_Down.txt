Hey what do you see  
Its not me not me  
Why wont you share  
Its not fair  
Theres a bicycle show  
Where the bicycles float  
And I wouldnt of cared  
I wont be the one who bothers you  
I wont be the one who lets you down  
Now that youre there  
Youre not scared  
Why would you care  
Its your dream  
Not theirs  
Theres a cigarette thief stealing cigarette disease  
I wish I was there
