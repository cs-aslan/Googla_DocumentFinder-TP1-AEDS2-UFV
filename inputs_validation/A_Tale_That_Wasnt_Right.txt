Here I stand all alone  
Have my mind turned to stone  
Have my heart filled up with ice  
To avoid its breakin twice  
  
Thanks to you my dear old friend  
But you cant help this is the end  
Of a tale that wasnt right  
I wont have no sleep tonight  
  
Chorus  
In my heart in my soul  
I really hate to pay this toll  
Should be strong young and bold  
But the only thing I feel is pain  
  
Its alright well stay friends  
Trustin in my confidence  
And lets say its just alright  
You wont sleep alone tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
With my heart with my soul  
Some guys cry you bought and sold  
Theyve been strong young and bold  
And they say play this song again  
  
Chorus
