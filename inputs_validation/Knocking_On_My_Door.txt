Ooh  knocking on my door  ooh  
Oh baby when I see your eyes  
I feel like Im in paradise  
My heart is beating just for you  
Dont play game with me oh  tomorrow  
Tomorrow theres another day  
Im begging you oh baby stay  
You said to me you had to go  
But I really knowreally know  
You said to me the time will show  
But I really know  
  
One day youre knocking on my door  
And you want to come in wanna come in  
All I want to do is just everything everything  
Save a little room in your lonely heart  
I promised you will be my baby  
  
Oh tell me youll never make me lonely  
Cause youre the one and only the one and only girl for me
