H How do you like your eggs in the morning  
  
D I like mine with a kiss  
  
H Boiled or fried D Im satisfied as long as I get my kiss  
  
H How do you like your toast in the morning  
  
H I like mine with a hug  
  
H Dark or light D the worlds all right as long as I get my hug  
  
D Ive got to have my love in the morning  
  
H Or the rest of my day is positively mayhem  
  
D Im a regular monster  
  
H How do you like your eggs in the morning  
  
D I like mine with a kiss  
  
H Up or down D Ill never frown eggs can be almost bliss  
  
D Just as long as I get my kiss  
  
D How do you like your eggs in the morning H how do you like your eggs in
the morning  
  
D I like mine with a kiss H I like mine with a kiss  
  
D Boiled or fried H Im satisfied Both as long as I get my kiss  
  
H How do you like your toast in the morning D how do you like your toast
in the morning  
  
H I like mine with a hug D I like mine with a hug  
  
H Dark or light D the worlds all right Both as long as I get my hug  
  
D Ive got to have my love in the morning  
  
H Or the rest of my day is positively mayhem  
  
D Im a regular monster  
  
H How do you like your eggs in the morning  
  
D I like mine with a kiss  
  
H Up or down D Ill never frown Both eggs can be almost bliss  
  
Both Just as long as I get my kiss
