Starring at your picture my vision is blur  
My eyes are feeling petite with every word  
Theyre trying to tell me Im only a kid and that I  
Cant be in love I dont know what it is  
  
And they keep trying to convince me  
That you aint no good for me  
Youre to young to know baby just let it go  
And they just wont accept what we are  
And what we can be  
So this letter reads
