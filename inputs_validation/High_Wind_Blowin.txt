Theres such a high wind blowing  
Its snowing in my bed  
Oh baby you started flowers growing  
Where nothing grew instead  
I need some things to hide the failure  
Of my garden and the way it grew  
Oh baby I didnt know I could depend on you  
Theres such a high wind blowing  
I wont get to sleep tonight  
I think that warm wind feels alright  
Theres such a high wind blowing  
I wont get to sleep at all  
I feel like Im gonna fall  
Into your fine high wind  
  
You look like twilight falling  
On the ocean in the setting sun  
Oh baby do you know what you have done  
I feel like you have changed my mind  
About living the way I do  
Oh baby I didnt know I could depend on you  
Theres such a high wind blowing  
I wont get to sleep tonight  
I think that warm wind feels alright  
Theres such a high wind blowing  
I wont get to sleep at all  
I feel like Im gonna fall  
Into your fine high wind
