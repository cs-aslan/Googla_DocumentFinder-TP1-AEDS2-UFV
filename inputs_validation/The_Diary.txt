How Id like to look into that little book  
The one that has the lock and key  
And know the boy that you care for  
The boy whos in your diary  
  
When its late at night what is the name you write  
Oh what Id give if I could see  
Am I the boy that you care for  
The boy whos in your diary  
  
Do you recall and make note of all  
The little things I say and do  
The name you underline Im hoping that its mine  
Darling Im so in love with you  
  
Please dont leave me blue Make all my dreams come true  
You know how much you mean to me  
Say Im the boy that you care for  
The boy whos in your diary
