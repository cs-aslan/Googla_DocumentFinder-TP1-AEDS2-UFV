Well she got her daddys car  
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now  
Seems she forgot all about the library  
Like she told her old man now  
And with the radio blastin goes cruisin  
Just as fast as she can now  
  
And shell have fun fun fun  
Till her daddy takes the Tbird away  
  
Well you knew all along that your dad  
Was gettin wise to you now  
Shouldna lied now shouldna lied  
And since he took your set of keys youve been  
Thinkin that your fun is all through now  
Shouldna lied now shouldna lied  
But you can come along with me cause we  
Got a lot a things to do now  
  
And well have fun fun fun  
Now that daddy took the Tbird away  
  
Fun fun fun  
Now that daddy took the Tbird away  
  
Fun fun fun  
Now that daddy took the Tbird away
