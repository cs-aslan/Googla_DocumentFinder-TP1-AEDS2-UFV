How come you never know  
What you got until its gone  
Too bad  
Because I never felt so good with anyone  
How fooled was I into thinking  
I was gonna be alright  
Okay  
Fine  
  
So every day I try a little harder  
To forget her  
Lie here convince myself  
Tomorrow will be better  
  
The trouble is I cant get her out of my mind  
When I close my eyes at night  
Whos gonna save me  
Now shes gone  
The trouble is theres a part of me  
That still cant let go of her memory  
And now I know what it is  
Love is what the trouble is  
Love is what the trouble is  
  
How come she said  
You never wear your heart  
Where I can see  
Too bad  
Cause now Im the one  
Whos sorry  
How stupid was I into thinking  
I was gonna be alright  
Okay  
Fine  
So everyday I find a little something  
To remind me  
No matter how I try  
I cant put the past behind me  
  
The trouble is I cant get her out of my mind  
When I close my eyes at night  
Whos gonna save me  
Now shes gone  
The trouble is theres a part of me  
That still cant let go of her memory  
And now I know what it is  
  
Love has let me go  
Im alright Im okay  
Ill be fine give it time  
  
But the only trouble is I cant get her out of my mind  
When I close my eyes at night  
Whos gonna save me  
Now shes gone shes gone  
The trouble is theres a part of me  
That still cant let go of her memory I just cant  
And now I know what it is yes I do  
And now I know what it is  
Cause love is what the trouble is  
The trouble  
Love love is what the trouble is
