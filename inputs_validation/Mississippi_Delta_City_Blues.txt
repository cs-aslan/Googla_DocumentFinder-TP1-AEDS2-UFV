Ive got a smile  
That I put on  
When Im not at home  
When Im not alone  
  
But it is so hard  
To make that smile  
Cause I know Ill be at home  
And alone in a while  
  
And if I look in a mirror  
I see my eyes start to tear  
I cant help but cry  
Since you said goodbye  
  
Ive got to hide  
What Im feelin inside  
Cant let them see  
How youre hurtin me  
  
So I guess thats what Ill do  
Wont let them see through  
Wont let them know  
That you could hurt me so  
  
Ive got a laugh  
That I put on  
When Im not at home  
When Im not alone  
  
But it is so hard  
To fake that laugh  
When my insides are cryin  
And my hearts torn in half  
  
And all the music I hear  
And things I valued so dear  
Make me feel so blue  
They all remind me of you  
  
Now What can I do  
Now That our love is through  
And my purpose is gone  
Still I got to live on  
  
I guess thats what Ill do  
I wont let them see through  
I wont let them know  
That you could hurt me so
