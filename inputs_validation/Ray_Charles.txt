We put on Ray Charles and broke up  
You were packed and gone when I woke up  
Ray just kept on singing he had Georgia on his mind  
You just keep on leaving you keep leaving all the time  
Wonder if the stars will die tonight  
Yeah I wonder if the cats and dogs are gonna fight  
Theres no rest for the restless so I doubt that youll sleep well  
I dont think that I will my heads ringing like a bell  
Love is blind and I dont blame her  
Cause lately I aint been too much to see  
Id bring some girl home but then Id have to pay her  
Wont you come home with me Rosemary  
When I walked in the bar you tried to hide  
But I took my old place right by your side  
You looked like a raccoon with those circles round your eyes  
If my offer is improper please come home with me tonight  
Well Ill prick myself and see if blood comes out  
Ill play until the whole damn tape runs out  
Ill put on that Ray Charles record if youll make some drinks  
Nothing is the matter it dont matter what you think  
Love is blind and I dont blame her  
Cause we all could use a little sympathy  
Id bring some girl home but then Id have to pay her  
Wont you come home with me Rosemary  
Love is blind and I dont blame her  
Cause lately I aint been too much to see  
Id bring some girl home but then Id have to pay her  
Wont you come home with me Rosemary
