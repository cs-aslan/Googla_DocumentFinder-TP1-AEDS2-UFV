Im not a stranger to passion  
Ive seen a lot of love in my time  
Felt that physical attraction  
From the touch in the heat of the night  
Been all over the country  
Started my share of new flames  
But after all is said and done  
theres only one that remains  
  
Chorus  
Dixie fire burning down in my soul  
Dixie fire it never leaves me whole  
It took a hometown girl to show me  
How cruel these hot summer nights can be  
Now theres a Dixie fire burning in the heart of me  
Burning in the heart of me  
  
Searching for some kind of direction  
Looking for a guiding light  
Needed to see a lighthouse  
Like a ship on a stormy night  
Somehow you heard my music  
You felt the sadness in me  
You took the words that were so cold  
And added a warm melody  
  
Chorus  
  
Burn burn burning  
Burn burn burning Cant you see that Im  
Burn burn burning Theres a Dixie fire  
Burn burn burning Dont you know that Im  
Burn burn burning  
Burn burn burning
