Little black dress  
Just walked into the room  
Makin heads turn  
Cant stop looking at you  
Its so right  
Its so right  
Its so right you know  
  
Little black dress  
Did you come here alone  
Its too late  
Its too late  
Its too late to go home  
  
Its so right  
Its so right  
Its so right you know  
Its so right  
Its so right  
Its so right you know  
  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me  
  
Little black dress  
Who you doin it for  
Little black dress  
I cant take anymore  
Its not right  
Its not right  
Its not right you know  
  
Little black dress  
Whats your favorite song  
Little black dress  
I wont do you no harm  
  
Its so right  
Its so right  
Its so right you know  
Its so right  
Its so right  
Cause Ill take you home  
  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me  
  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me  
  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me
