A little baby told God  
Hey Im kinda scared  
Dont really know if I wanna go down there  
Because from here it looks like a little blue ball  
But thats a great big place and Im so small  
  
Why cant I just stay here with you  
Did I make you mad dont you want me too   
And God said Oh child of course I do  
But theres somebody special thats waiting for you  
  
So hush now baby dont you cry  
Because theres someone down there waiting  
Whose only goal in life  
Is making sure youre always gonna be all right  
A loving angel tender tough and strong  
Come on child its time to meet your mom  
  
Now when shes talking to you  
Make sure you listen close  
Because shes gonna teach you everything  
Youll ever need to know  
  
Like how to mind your manners  
To love and laugh and dream  
And shell put you on the path  
Thatll bring you back to me  
  
So hush now little baby dont you cry  
Because theres someone down there waiting  
Whose only goal in life  
Is making sure youre always gonna be all right  
A loving angel tender tough and strong  
Come on child its time to meet your mom
