A tisket a tasket  
A brown and yellow basket  
Well I wrote a letter to my mommie  
On the way I dropped it  
  
I dropped it I dropped it  
Yes on the way I dropped it  
A little girlie picked it up  
And she put it in her pocket  
  
She was truckin on down the avenue  
Without a single thing to do  
She went apeck peckin all around  
Then she spied it on the ground  
  
She took it she took it  
My little yellow basket  
And if she doesnt bring it back  
I think that I will die  
  
A tisket a tasket  
You know I lost my yellow basket  
And if that girlie dont return it  
I dont know what Ill do  
  
Oh gee I wonder where my basket can be  
So do we so do we so do we  
Oh gee I wish that little girlie I could see  
So do we so do we so do we  
  
I did not take care of that little basket of mine  
Oh that ittybitty basket was a joy of mine  
  
A tisket a tasket  
I lost my yellow basket  
Wont someone help me find my basket  
And make me happy again again  
  
Was it blue No no no no  
Was it green No no no no no no no no  
Was it Prada Oh thats not fair  
My little yellow basket
