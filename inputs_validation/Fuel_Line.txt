Fill her up Repeats  
  
Her engines running and the fuel is clean  
She only uses it cause shes a machine  
She dont use much though just to get around  
  
Keep filling that fuel line Keep filling that old fuel line  
Keep filling that fuel line Keep filling that old fuel line  
  
The awesome power of electricity  
Stored for you in a giant battery  
She dont use much though thats smart for a car  
  
Keep filling that fuel line Keep filling that old fuel line  
Keep filling that fuel line Keep filling that old fuel line  
  
Fill her up Repeats  
  
The world is ready for a whole new game  
Some oldtimers wanna stay the same  
They like to advertise how clean and green they are  
  
Keep filling that fuel line Keep filling that old fuel line  
Keep filling that fuel line Keep filling that old fuel line  
  
But she dont listen to what they say  
She burned the mess they clean instead  
She dont use much though thats smart for a car  
  
Keep filling that fuel line Keep filling that old fuel line  
Keep filling that fuel line Keep filling that old fuel line  
  
Fill her up Repeats  
  
Shes not the car that she used to be  
Keep ready for you and shes ready for me  
Into the future thats her destiny  
  
Keep filling that fuel line Keep filling that old fuel line Repeats
