Mary loves the grouse  
Hides the bottles round the house  
She watches chat shows and the soaps  
Brokenhearted but she copes  
Michaels out of work  
Feels hes sinking in the murk  
Hes unshaven and a mess  
Finds it hard some days to dress  
Stevie smashed the delf  
Cause he cant express himself  
Hes consumed by rage  
Like his father at his age  
Ritas little child  
Has a lovely little smile  
But this means nothing to her father  
Because hes never even seen her  
And we sing sing all our cares away  
And we live to fight another day  
Joeys off the gear  
Hes been clean for half a year  
He gets bored out of his mind  
But hes trying to toe the line  
Maggies in a chair  
Twas joyriding put her there  
She puts the kettle on the boil  
And shes always got a smile  
And we sing sing all our cares away  
And we live to fight another day  
Yeah we sing sing all our cares away  
And we live to love another day  
We grow strong from it all  
We grow strong or we fall  
We grow strong from it all  
We grow strong or we fall  
And we sing all our cares away
