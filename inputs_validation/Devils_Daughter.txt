Well I know where you live  
I know you live alone  
Ill pay a visit in your darkest hour  
Ive got a treat in store  
Wont be the same no more  
And I will demonstrate my holy power  
  
Devils daughter  
You dont want a holy war  
Devils daughter  
You dont want a holy war  
  
You know what Im about  
Ill cast the demons out  
And Ill persist until the battles won  
Ill feel your creeping flesh  
If youre to be possessed  
Then I will desecrate what youve become  
  
Devils daughter  
You dont want a holy war  
Devils daughter  
  
The time has come at last  
Your future days have past  
No use in fighting battles you cant win  
The final conflicts lost  
You cant afford the cost  
Dont try to expiate your fathers sins  
  
Breakdown breakdown  
Breakdown and cry  
Devils daughter Im watching you watching you  
Devils daughter Im watching you watching you  
Devils daughter Im watching you watching you  
Devils daughter ha ha ha
