I cant stop this feeling  
Deep inside of me  
Girl you just dont realize  
What you do to me  
  
Your lips are sweet as candy  
The taste stays on my mind  
You just keep me thirsty  
For another cup of wine  
  
When you hold me  
In your arms so tight  
You let me know  
Everythings all right  
  
I Im hooked on a feeling  
Im high on believing  
That youre in love with me  
  
Ive got it bad for you darling  
But I dont need a cure  
Ill just stay addicted  
And hope I can endure  
  
All the good love  
When were all alone  
Keep it up boy  
Yeah you turn me on  
  
I Im hooked on a feeling  
Im high on believing  
That youre in love with me  
  
When you hold me  
In your arms so tight  
You let me know  
Everythings all right  
  
I Im hooked on a feeling  
Im high on believing  
That youre in love with me  
  
I said Im hooked on a feeling
