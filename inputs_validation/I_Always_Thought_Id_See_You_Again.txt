No Im not making that promise again  
Nothing can change my mind  
Nothing at all  
cause love has a way of comin undone  
till Im all alone with my heart  
And here Ill stay  
And I always thought Id see you again  
Oh how it hurts every time youve crossed my heart since then  
Gonna give it all it takes  
To hold what might have been  
But I always thought Id see you again  
Now theres no reason to run for the phone  
No need to hold my breath  
Hopin its you  
Each time I see someone we used to know  
Or go some place we used to go  
Its not the same  
cause I always thought Id see you again  
oh how it hurts every time  
Youve crossed my heart since then  
Gonna give up all it takes  
To hold what might have been cause I always thought Id see you again  
Love doesnt come when you need love  
Its not always there when you fall  
Try as you may you got nothin to say  
Nothing at all  
I always thought Id see you again  
Oh how it hurts every time  
Youve crossed my heart again  
Gotta give it all it takes  
To hold what might have been  
Cause I always thought Id see you again  
Cause I always thought Id see you again  
Again  
Again
