I must be honest with you babe  
just gotta be honest  
I love to watch the faces that you make when we make love oh girl  
But when Im behind you holding your hips and you close your eyes and bite
your lips  
  
I can see you so might I suggest a change  
Now mama please dont take me strange for what Im about to say  
please dont take me strange  
If you know anything bout me by now  
Im a freak just follow my lead  
  
Chorus  
Baby I love making love in front of a mirror in front of a mirror  
So that that I can watch you enjoying me baby tonight  
Baby tonight lets try in front of a mirror in front of a mirror  
Watching ourselves make love  
Girl why dont we  
  
And Im a keep your chin up please watch me do thenasty  
I like it when you make your moves fast  
Mami if I pull your head back  
Cause I want you to see that we look so good together  
  
I understand that your not ready for me and my directory  
Your day but featuring me starring you  
Baby thats okay with me  
Im the systems next best thing  
  
Chorus  
  
I see you can you see me watching you loving it Repeat x8  
  
Chorus  
  
Can we make love in front of a mirror Repeat until fade
