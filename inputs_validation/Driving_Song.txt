The leaves seen through my window pane  
Remind me that its time to move my life again  
November sun is felt by none  
A chilly breeze has blown my thoughts to whats to come  
A cup of warm coffee some vitamin see  
A bowl for the cat a bowl for the dog a bowl for me  
Choose my bluest tape and unlock my car  
An honest tune with a lingering lead has taken me this far  
  
On the edge of the porch in the warm evening night  
Throwing the bone for the dog I see two passing lights  
Well I wonder where that drivers bound  
Is there someone somewhere someway out there that Ive not found  
A touch of smoke aint what it seems  
Dust and sunshine can also make my eyes look mean  
But theres a brown cat sleeping through this days show  
Toppin off the woodpile breathing slow
