If you let me I will  
Pick up the remains  
Of your day  
  
If you let me I will  
Take a hold of your hand  
Tell you that youre sane  
  
You say give me what youve got  
Give me what youve got  
Show me what were not  
Must be a plan for the every man  
Just give me what you can  
  
Cause I wish I could believe in God  
So I could move ahead  
I know I cant believe in God  
Time to move ahead yeah yeah  
  
If you let me I will  
I will soften the blow  
Of the forces that play  
  
If you let me I will  
I will find some grace  
In the modern day  
  
You say give me what youve got  
Give me what youve got  
Show me what were not  
Must be a plan for the every man  
Just give me what you can  
  
Cause I wish I could believe in God  
So I could move ahead  
I know I cant believe in God  
Time to move ahead  
  
Cause I wish I could believe in God  
So I could move ahead  
I know I cant believe in God  
Time to move ahead yeah yeah
