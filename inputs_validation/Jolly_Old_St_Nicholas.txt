Jolly old St Nicholas  
Lean your ear this way  
Dont you tell a single soul  
What Im going to say  
  
Christmas Eve is coming soon  
Now you dear old man  
Whisper what youll bring to me  
Tell me if you can  
  
When the clock is striking twelve  
When Im fast asleep  
Down the chimney broad and black  
With your pack youll creep  
  
All the stockings you will find  
Hanging in a row  
Mine will be the shortest one  
Youll be sure to know  
  
Johnny wants a pair of skates  
Suzie wants a sled  
Nellie wants a picture book  
Yellow Blue and Red  
  
As for me my little brain  
Isnt very bright  
Choose for me old Santa Claus  
What you think is right
