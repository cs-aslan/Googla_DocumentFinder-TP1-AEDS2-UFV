Overbearing panic attack entrenching my veins fuck  
In an hour ill be ok  
I pray this pain will go away permanently someday  
Ive seen more than  
I should have to  
Ive seen this on my own great  
This song is a  
Poem to myself  
It helps me to live  
In case of fire  
Break the glass fuck  
And move on into your own Your own  
Reoccurring drowning effect entrenching my veins  
I hope youll be ok someday  
So I can say that you moved on in the right way  
Weve seen this and  
Weve breathed this and  
Weve lived this on our own your own  
This song is a  
Poem to myself  
It helps me to live  
In case of fire  
Break the glass  
And move on into your own  
This song is a  
Poem to myself  
It helps me to live  
In case of fire  
Break the glass  
And move on into your own  
Your own  
Break  
This song is a  
Poem to myself  
It helps me to live  
In case of fire  
Break the glass  
And move on into your own  
2x  
Your own Your own Your ooowwwnnn Your own  
This is a Taproot song not a Korn song
