Baby the feeling that you give to me  
Maybe Im thinking your so good to me  
Is it really really me  
Is it really really me  
  
Baby the feeling I cant stand the joy  
Spare me some feeling if I wake up a boy  
Is it really really me  
Is it really really me  
  
Baby Im feeling like a fire I am  
Am I still teething or could I be a man  
Is it Is it  
Is it really really me  
Is it really really me  
  
I gotta get along cause its a long long ride now  
Ive been away too long I gotta get on home now  
Im getting far too old to know my dream of fortune  
But the time is flowing now I know what I must do  
  
I gotta go home I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind  
I gotta go home I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind  
  
I gotta get along cause its a long long ride now  
Ive been away too long I gotta get on home now  
Im getting far too old to know my dream of fortune  
But the time is flowing now I know what I must do  
  
I gotta go home I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind  
I gotta go home I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind
