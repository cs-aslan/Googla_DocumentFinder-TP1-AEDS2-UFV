Question for all you  
Who should know  
Much better  
But dont  
  
With your brains and your instincts around you  
Why do you  
Still blow it  
  
Big fish eat the little fish  
No fish left to eat  
Big man beats the little man  
til the little man starts to beat  
And the little man starts to beat  
  
I have been hurt  
I will hurt others  
Thats what he said  
  
I have been hurt  
I will hurt others  
Thats what he said  
  
Question for all you  
Who dont know  
Much better  
But should  
  
Maybe the times come  
To use what you got  
For some good  
  
I have been hurt  
I will hurt others  
Thats what he said  
Thats what he said  
  
I have been hurt  
Love is for others  
Thats what he said  
Thats what he said
