Look at me pathetic nigga this chain that I bought  
You mix greed pain and fame this is heinous result  
Let these words be the colors Im just paintin my heart  
Im kneedeep in the game and it aint what I thought  
Copped the range rover my girl got the mercedes  
Iced out crazy I wanna shine like baby  
Compared to that nigga I aint even got a bib yet  
Truth be told I aint even bought a crib yet  
This is everything they told a nigga not to do  
Image is everything I see it got a lot to do  
With the way that people perceive and what they believe  
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave  
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say I see you  
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you  
And police wanna stop you frisk you wonder what he do  
If a hater snatch yo chain I bet it still wont free you  
Cause Ill be right back grinding til I cop another  
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother  
My partner said thats just the game my nigga  
Swear I heard my jeweler say Here go your chain my nigga  
  
This is chaining day  
I need you to love me love me  
Chaining day my chaining day  
I need you to love me love me  
My chaining day  
My last piece I swear my guilt heavy as this piece I wear  
They even iced out Jesus hair  
My last piece I swear they even iced out Jesus hair  
  
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy  
The real strange thing about this iced out Rolly  
Its the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at  
The same shit a rich white mofucka laugh at  
Well laugh on white man I aint paid as you  
But I bet your rims aint the same age as you  
And I aint got no investment portfolio  
But my black and white diamonds shinin like a Oreo  
I know back home where niggas sit today  
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say  
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake  
Hed prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break  
But hey you know the sayin Fake it til you make it  
Me I did the opposite made it then I faked it  
And actin like I gave a fuck money I was savin up  
To buy a crib thats gated to that hundred racks  
I gave it up for what  
  
I need you to love me love me  
Chaining day my chaining day  
I need you to love me love me  
My chaining day  
My last piece I swear my guilt heavy as this piece I wear  
They even iced out Jesus hair  
My last piece I swear  
  
Lord  
This is the last time  
Told my accountant Its the last time  
I swear this is the last time  
I know that I said that last time  
But this the last time  
Mama I swear this is the last time  
So dont take my Chains from me  
This is the last time  
Cause I chose this slavery  
This is the last time  
Dont take my chains from me  
This is the last time  
Cause I love this slavery  
I need you to love me love me love me  
I need you to love me love me love me  
I need you to love me love me love me  
I need you to love me love me love me  
I need you to love me love me love me
