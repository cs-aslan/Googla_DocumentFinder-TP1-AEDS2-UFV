Kick off your shoes throw away your blues  
You paid your dues Noah  
  
Summer is here why interfere  
Go drink a beer Noah  
  
You must realize that you need something  
Resynthesize your own ego  
You must recognise that lifes just a circle  
So lets go on with the show  
  
Hoist up your sail go kill a whale  
Dont look so pale Noah  
One two three four  
  
Now lets go on with the show  
  
Kennan was right youre black and white  
Youre left and right Noah  
Remember old Cain its all in vein  
Its starting to rain Noah
