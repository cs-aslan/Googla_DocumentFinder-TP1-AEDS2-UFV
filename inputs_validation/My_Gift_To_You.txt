Laying by my precious  
Not long ago  
Hiding behind the shadows  
Of your broken soul  
Why is it always you and something you can never have  
Why did you you try to tell me  
How could you be this way  
Your throat I take grasp  
Can you feel the pain  
Then your eyes roll back  
Can you feel the pain  
Your racing through my veins  
Cant you feel the pain  
Your heart stops beating  
Cant you feel the pain  
Like orgasms  
  
Cant you feel the pain  
I guess your life is dead  
Cant you feel the pain  
There you are my precious  
With your broken soul  
  
Forever my crotch take control  
Why is it  
You fuck up something you have always had  
Whyd you try to tell me  
How could you be so cold  
Your throat I take grasp  
Can you feel the pain  
Then your eyes roll back  
Can you feel the pain  
  
Your racing through my veins  
Cant you feel the pain  
Your heart stops beating  
Cant you feel the pain  
Like orgasms  
Cant you feel the pain  
I guess your life is dead  
Cant you feel the pain  
Here I am just a man  
Feeling the pain gives me life  
Relieving us is my plan  
  
Id anything to see through your eyes  
Just to see through your lies  
I hate you Can you feel the pain  
Cant you feel the pain  
I hate you Can you feel the pain  
Your throat I take grasp  
  
Can you feel the pain  
Then your eyes roll back  
Can you feel the pain  
Your racing through my veins  
Cant you feel the pain  
Your heart stops beating  
Cant you feel the pain  
Like orgasms  
Cant you feel the pain  
I guess your life is dead  
Cant you feel the pain
