Should I just ride in and steal you away  
Dont know what else to do  
I got a desperado love for you  
  
They say you belong to another man  
The first time we met I knew  
That Id have a desperado love for you  
  
I know that it breaks every law  
To feel the way Im feelin  
But I want your love so desperately  
I dont see the wrong in stealin  
  
So hold on Im gonna shoot for the heart  
Like desperadoes do  
I got a desperado love for you  
  
Its so wrong to take what isnt mine  
And head out for the border  
But I cant look at you and have  
Respect for law and order  
  
So hold on Im gonna shoot for the heart  
Like desperadoes do  
I got a desperado love for you  
I got a desperado love for you
