Live and die before I get it done  
Will you decide  
Ill take my words and turn them into sounds  
It will survive  
Because a long time ago  
I knew not to deprive  
  
Its safe out there and now youre everywhere  
Just like the sky  
And you are love  
You are the love supreme  
You are the rye  
And when you hear this  
You know its your jam  
Its your goodbye  
  
Like I said you know Im almost dead  
You know Im almost gone  
And when the drummer drums  
Hes gonna play my song  
To carry me along  
  
Like I said you know Im almost dead  
You know Im almost gone  
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away  
To where we all belong  
  
We your cost  
When we were feeling lost  
Its just the time  
Kateri cried  
The day her lover died  
She recognized  
Because ya gave her  
A life of real love  
Its no surprise  
  
The nights are long  
But the years are short  
When youre alive  
Way back when  
Well never be again  
It was a time  
Its gonna catch you  
So glad I met you  
To walk a line  
  
Like I said you know Im almost dead  
You know Im almost gone  
And when the drummer drums  
Hes gonna play my song  
To carry me along  
  
Like I said you know Im almost dead  
You know Im almost gone  
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away  
To where we all belong  
  
Come get me  
Hey  
Hey  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Like I said you know Im almost dead  
You know Im almost gone  
And when the drummer drums  
Hes gonna play my song  
To carry me along  
  
Like I said you know Im almost dead  
You know Im almost gone  
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away  
To where we all belong  
  
Then we live  
So every time you die  
Hes in the revert sky  
Lay me down  
So when its time to leave  
Another sun will rise  
  
I said yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I said yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Like I said you know Im almost dead  
You know Im almost gone  
And when the drummer drums  
Hes gonna play my song  
To carry me along  
  
Like I said you know Im almost dead  
You know Im almost gone  
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away  
To where we all belong  
  
Like I said you know Im almost dead  
You know Im almost gone  
Like I said you know Im almost dead  
You know Im almost gone  
Like I said you know Im almost dead  
You know Im almost gone
