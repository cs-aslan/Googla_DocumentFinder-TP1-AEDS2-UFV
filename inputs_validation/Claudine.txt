But he aint talkin about it any more  
Is he Claudine  
Theres blood in the chalet  
And blood in the snow  
SheWashed her hands of the whole damn show  
The best thing you could do Claudine  
Shot him once right through the head  
Shot him twice right through the chest  
The judge says ruled it was an accident  
Claudine  
Accidents will happen  
In the best homes

Huh Claudine  
Oh Claudine  
Oooo   
What about the children baby  
Poor poor children  
Now I threaten my wife with a gun  
I always leave the safety on  
I recommend it  
Claudine  
Now she pistol whipped me once or twice  
But she never tried to take my life  
What do you think about that  
Claudine  
The prettiest girl I ever seen  
I saw you on the movie screen  
Hope you dont try to make a sacrifice of me  
Claudine  
Dont get trigger happy with me  
Dont wave a gun at me  
Claudine

Oh Claudine
