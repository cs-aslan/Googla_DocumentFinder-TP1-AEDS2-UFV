Guilty concience dont you have a guilty concience  
Honey when you hold someone new  
When you look into his eyes and tell him all those lies  
Honey dont your concience bother you  
Dont your concience bother you when your hear my name  
Knowin how you hurt your darlin  
Should fill your heart with shame  
Guilty concience guilty concience  
Honey dont your concience bother you  
Guilty concience dont you have a guilty concience  
When you hold another in my place  
When youre walkin by his side dear are you satisfied  
Or does a guilty concience bother you  
I still remember all the things you said that wasnt true  
And when youre holding someone else dont you remember too  
Guilty concience guilty concience  
Honey dont your concience bother you  
  
Guilty concience dont you have a guilty concience  
Honey when you hold someone new  
When you know that it is smart you jump from heart to heart  
Honey dont your concience bother you  
You told me once that you would love me till eternity  
And now youre tellin someone else the same as you told me  
Guilty concience guilty concience  
Dont a guilty concience bother you
