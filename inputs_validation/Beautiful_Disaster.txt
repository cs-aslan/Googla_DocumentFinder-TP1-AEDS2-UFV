He drowns in his dreams  
An exquisite extreme I know  
Hes as damned as he seems  
And more heaven than a heart could hold  
  
And if I try to save him  
My whole world could cave in  
It just aint right  
It just aint right  
  
Chorus  
Oh and I dont know  
I dont know what hes after  
But hes so beautiful  
Such a beautiful disaster  
And if I could hold on  
Through the tears and the laughter  
Would it be beautiful  
Or just a beautiful disaster  
  
Hes magic and myth  
As strong as what I believe  
A tragedy with  
More damage than a soul should see  
And do I try to change him  
So hard not to blame him  
Hold on tight  
Hold on tight  
  
Chorus  
  
Im longing for love and the logical  
But hes only happy hysterical  
Im waiting for some kind of miracle  
Waited so long  
So long  
  
Hes soft to the touch  
But frayed at the ends he breaks  
Hes never enough  
And still hes more than I can take  
  
Oh cause I dont know  
I dont know what hes after  
But hes so beautiful  
Such a beautiful disaster  
And if I could hold on  
Through the tears and the laughter  
Would it be beautiful  
Or just a beautiful disaster  
  
Hes beautiful  
Such a beautiful disaster  
Beautiful Beautiful disaster  
Beautiful disaster
