I got water on the brain  
My mind is like a drain  
Here I go again  
Over the hill  
  
My eyes dont seem too clear  
Im not sure what I hear  
It seems Im going clear  
Over the hill  
  
Like a cripple and his crutch  
I have leaned a bit too much  
Seems that I should never touch again  
Now it seems its plain to see  
That this stuff is killing me  
Got to quit so Ill be free again  
  
I got too much to lose  
No one can fill my shoes  
Think Ill leave the blues  
Over the hill
