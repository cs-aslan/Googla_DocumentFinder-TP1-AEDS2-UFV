Now I fall to the ground  
I cant get up well never mind  
I know youll pull me up by my bones  
And say Im sand to polished stone  
Todays gone and it wont be long  
Before we fall asleep and forget what weve done  
We wont get up cause today is fun  
Were alone  
  
Now you bite my tongue  
And when the alcohols gone  
I wont feel a thing  
So you cant carry on  
  
Todays gone and it wont be long  
Before we fall asleep and forget what weve done  
We wont get up cause today is fun  
Were alone  
  
Its numb  
Its numb  
Its numb
