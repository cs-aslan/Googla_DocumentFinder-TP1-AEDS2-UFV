I dont need no ones opinion  
On the matter concerning my dress  
I was raised in a clinic down in Oklahoma  
There were many things I did not possess  
I never complained because my father said  
son youll get your chance before youre my age  
Then he took me upstairs and gave me this suit  
Written all over his face  
  
He said others may come and others may go  
But that suit will be around wherever youre goin  
Three button hand me down  
Three button hand me down  
  
I had my fair share of neat women  
But they came between me and my suit  
That was a filly from Boston a barmaid from Houston  
Not forgetting the one in Detroit  
They said we like you boy and we think youre sweet  
But cant you lose your suit  
I said no you cant do that to me  
I remember what my father said  
  
He said others may come and others may go  
But that suit will be around wherever youre goin  
Three button hand me down ha ha  
Three button hand me down  
  
Ive never been a tidy dresser  
And the fold in my trousers  it aint straight  
Still I know a good cloth when I see one  
Thats why Im clad in this gray flannel suit  
Sometimes I wonder if I should visit a tailor  
And get myself a smooth outfit  
Then I remember what my father said to me  
Ill make you from the open road  
  
He said others may come and others may go  
But that suit will be around wherever you go  
Three button hand me down  
Three button hand me down
