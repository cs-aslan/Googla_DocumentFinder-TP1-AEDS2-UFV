He lives in a waste  
Void of culture and taste  
His eye on a prize beyond  
His every word  
Is in the right place  
But his word is not his bond  
  
His face his comely  
His heart it bleeds  
Yet its but a mantle he has donned  
Mark him only  
By his deeds  
For his word is not his bond  
  
Id love to take him  
Out of his room  
And gently break him  
Id love to see  
Him dance  
  
His protege deals  
In confusion and fog  
Of power he is fond  
  
Wheels within wheels  
Like master like dog  
His word is not his bond  
  
Im trying to swim  
But Im caught in the shallows  
And I sense that Ive been conned  
Deliver him  
To the gallows  
His word is not his bond
