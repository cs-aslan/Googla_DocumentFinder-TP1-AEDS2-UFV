I went down to the station just to take a ride  
I went down to the station just to take a ride  
Found myself on a flatcar yesterday behind  
  
Pullin out from the platform there was no brass band  
I pulled out from the platform nobody raised a hand  
And there were no tears of regret from my runaway train  
Train train train train  
  
Got no sand in my pocket you know I aint tied down  
  
Aint no sand in my pocket never do sit down  
Im just a crosstie walker where the freight trains run  
Run run run run  
  
If you see me acomin dont you waste my time  
If you see me acomin dont you waste my time  
Cause theres more miles between us than the Santa Fe line  
Run run run run  
  
Mmmmmmmmmm
