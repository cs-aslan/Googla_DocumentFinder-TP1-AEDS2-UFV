Voices I hear the people calling  
Deep in my dreams  
Choices I made my own theyve fallen  
Apart with their screams  
  
Waiting for my time  
Oh Lord please forgive me  
Waiting for a hero  
An angel relieve me  
  
In a land after life  
Ill give my sacrifice  
In a world of dignity  
There is no need to flee  
  
In a land after time  
Ill give my sacrifice  
In a world of glory skies  
There is no need to die  
  
Chances I took enough to fight it  
  
All through my life  
Advances I had them all and lost em  
Theyre out of my sight  
  
Waiting for my time  
Oh Lord please forgive me  
Waiting for a hero  
An angel relieve me  
  
In a land after life  
Ill give my sacrifice  
In a world of dignity  
There is no need to flee  
  
In a land after time  
Ill give my sacrifice  
In a world of glory skies  
There is no need to die
