Dig you better dead Id dig you better dead Id dig you  
Dig you better dead Id dig you better dead  
Dig you better dead Id dig you better dead Id dig you  
Dig you better dead Id dig you better dead  
  
A long time ago you took six months a walkin  
Talkin on the other side  
What started as an experiment  
Turned into a heavensent message that saved your ass from dyin  
Somebody said  
  
Chorus  
In life theres always peaks and valleys  
And if youre lost they wont show you the way  
That same somebody said Id dig you better dead  
But Id much rather see if your God is what you say say say  
  
And with the awesome power they struck  
1st they offered up the buck  
Right in the middle right in the middle they stuck right in the middle  
A toke or to what the fuck what the fuck  
  
One minute youre hot  
Tell the truth and youre not  
Thats the noose that they hang on a goose like you  
Somebody said  
  
Chorus  
  
Dig you better dead Id dig you better dead Repeat x4  
  
And whatever you do dont make somebody happy  
Dont dress to freaky and make their daughters stare  
Then youll find out how deep the valley truly be  
If you plan on catchin the bus you better have plenty fare  
Somebody said  
  
Chorus  
  
Dig you better dead Id dig you better dead  
Dig you better dead Id dig you better dead  
Dig dig dig you better dead  
Id dig dig you better dead  
Somebody said  
  
Chorus  
  
Id dig you better dead Id dig you better dead  
Dig you better dead Id dig you better dead Repeat x3
