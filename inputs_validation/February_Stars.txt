Hanging on  
Here until Im gone  
Just hanging on  
  
Even though  
I watched you come and go  
How was I to know  
Youd steal the show  
  
One day Ill have enough to gamble  
Ill wait to hear your final call and bet it all  
  
Hanging on  
Here until Im gone  
Right where I belong  
Just hanging on  
  
Even though  
I pass this time alone  
Somewhere so unknown  
It heals the soul  
  
You ask for walls Ill build them higher  
Well lie in shadows of them all  
Id stand but theyre much too tall  
And I fall  
  
February Stars  
Floating in the dark  
Temporary scars  
February Stars
