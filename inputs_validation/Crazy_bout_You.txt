Someone asked me about you  
Asked me if this was love are we serious  
I kindly replied that I loved you  
Dont know if I should be falling again  
  
Theres a part of me still in misery  
Thought I know I got to move on  
Im scarred of commitment  
Im scarred of what could go wrong  
  
Chorus  
Cause if I love again I could lose again  
Theres a chance that my heart could break  
Hate to be wrong again  
Baby cause Im crazy bout you  
If I hurt again and I cried again  
Thats the chance that Im gonna take  
I cant be wrong again  
Baby cause Im crazy bout you  
  
Its gonna take me just a moment  
To take this all the way it feels kind of strange  
So what could you do to assure me  
That you wont go astray baby and hurt me some day  
  
So no promises dont want roses  
Ive already heard every lie  
And I aint in no hurry  
And I hope youre not wasting my time  
  
Chorus  
  
Starting over  
Takes me under  
I need your shoulder  
When I cant bear this pain  
I need your love now  
To help me make it alright  
I dont need no one babe  
Runnin in and out of my life  
  
Chorus  
  
If I love again and I can lose again  
Thats a chance that Im gonna take  
I cant be wrong again  
Baby cause Im crazy bout you
