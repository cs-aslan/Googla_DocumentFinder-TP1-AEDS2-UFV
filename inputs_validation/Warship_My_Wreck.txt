Verse  
Youre a paper doll  
I fold you how I want  
Youre not my noose  
I tied this knot  
If this wont be  
Our fingers locked together  
This is total war  
Method not objective  
  
Cannot say Im breaking the rules  
If I can glue em back together  
Cannot say Im breaking the rules  
If I can glue them back together  
Cannot say Im breaking the rules  
If I can glue them back together  
Back together  
  
Chorus X2  
Scars on my fingers bruises on neck  
Crashin my trains warship my wreck  
Scars on my fingers bruises my neck  
Crashin my trains warship my wreck  
Scars on my fingers bruises my neck  
Crashin my trains warship my wreck  
warship my wreck  
warship my wreck  
  
Verse 2  
Cut the hands off  
Then kamikaze into your soul  
Kamikaze into your soul  
  
Chorus X2  
Scars on my fingers bruises my neck  
Crashin my trains warship my wreck  
Warship my Wreck  
Scars on my fingers bruises my neck  
Crashin my trains warship my wreck  
Warship my wreck  
Scars on my fingers bruises my neck  
Crashin my trains warship my wreck  
warship my wreck  
  
Scars on my fingers bruises my neck  
Crashin my trains warship my wreck  
  
Cannot say Im breaking the rules  
If I can glue em back together  
Cannot say Im breaking the rules  
If I can glue them back together  
Cannot say Im breaking the rules  
If I can glue them back together
