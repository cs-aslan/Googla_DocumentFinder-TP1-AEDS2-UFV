Shes so big hearted  
But not so remarkable  
just an ordinary humble girl  
expecting nothing as were made to think  
Its a pretty persons world  
but you are beautiful and you better go show it  
go look again you gotta be true to your own  
if you really wanna go to the top  
do you really wanna win  
Dont believe in living normal just to satisfy demand  
well if you wanna get free  
and if you wanna do the passionate thing  
and if you wanna get smart for the sake of your heart  
you should own your name and stand up tall  
and get real and see the beauty in ugly  
well you are fresh youre face is fabulous  
dont forget youre one of a kind  
when nobody is checking the deeds youve done  
And nobody is hearing your cries  
you make all of the fashion statements  
Just by dressing up your mind  
Well if you wanna get free  
and if you wanna do the passionate thing  
and if you wanna get smart for the sake of your heart  
you should own your name and stand up tall  
and get real and see the beauty in ugly  
and see the beauty in ulgy  
well if you wanna get free  
and if you wanna do the passionate thing  
and if you wanna get smart for the sake of your heart and oh  
you should own your name and stand up tall  
and get real and see the beauty in ugly  
see the beauty in a ulgy
