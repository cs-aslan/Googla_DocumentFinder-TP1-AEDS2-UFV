Once they were lovers but now theyre not friends  
Shes found another he says its the end  
To think they once tore down the wall for a door  
But now they dont speak anymore  
  
So he walks the streets the few nights he can stand  
Drinking her memory away when he can  
Friends once would reach out to them from the shore  
But now they dont cry anymore  
  
How does it all come to happen  
Thats not what loving is for  
And if I thought it was Id leave here in the morning  
Id sooner sleep on the floor  
  
Oh when will we learn really what loving is  
Its not what you get in return but what you give  
To think they once tore down the wall for a door  
But now they dont speak anymore
