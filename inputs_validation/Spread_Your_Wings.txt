Verse  
Young woman confused  
Young woman abused  
You must understand  
Its never too late to lose who you are  
And choose who you are supposed to be  
Supposed to become  
Youve been in and out  
Up and down back and forth  
Backwards around  
Not a friend not a mother not a father  
Just God and you should make a choice  
What you ought to do  
What matters most  
Who you are to you  
Opinions of the old and young  
Shouldnt matter to you  
Take advice think it over twice  
Make a choice that helps you sleep at night  
Its decent but recently  
Things have shown us  
We have done the wrong things often  
Never suicide thats the easy route  
Theres always another way out  
Think about it think about it  
  
Chorus 2x  
You can give up  
Or you can get up  
Just dont let what you need pass by  
Spread your wings to the sky  
Let you soul fall in love  
  
You can fly  
  
Verse 2  
Now see if you went through life with your eyes closed  
You never woulda known there was a high road  
  
Let people get the best of you and get mad at them  
Instead of bein mad at yourself  
Youre only number one in your life  
And you will decide if it goes right  
Every time you digress  
Defeat your progress  
Feed you knowledge but you must digest  
The controversy yo can get personal  
They dont understand till the role reversal  
Seekin fame play their games  
Gave a whole lot for a whole little gain  
Push comes to shove  
Do you push or shove  
When the choice is yours  
Do you leave or you love  
All the tears you cried youre dyin inside  
When will you decide to survive  
  
Chorus 2x  
You can give up  
Or you can get up  
Just dont let what you need pass by  
Spread your wings to the sky  
Let your soul fall in love  
  
You can fly  
Fly  
Fly  
Fly  
Fly  
  
4 x  
You can give up  
Or you can get up  
Just dont let what you need pass by  
Spread your wings to the sky  
Let you soul fall in love  
  
You can fly
