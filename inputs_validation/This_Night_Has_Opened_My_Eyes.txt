In a river the color of lead  
Immerse the babys head  
Wrap her up in the News Of The World  
Dump her on a doorstep girl  
  
This night has opened my eyes  
And I will never sleep again  
You kicked and cried like a bullied child  
A grown man of twentyfive  
  
Oh he said hed cure your ills  
But he didnt and he never will  
Oh save your life  
Because youve only got one  
  
The dream has gone  
But the baby is real  
Oh you did a good thing  
She could have been a poet  
  
Or she could have been a fool  
Oh you did a bad thing  
And Im not happy  
And Im not sad  
  
A shoeless child on a swing  
Reminds you of your own again  
She took away your troubles  
Oh but then again  
  
She left pain  
So please save your life  
Because youve only got one  
The dream has gone  
  
But the baby is real  
Oh you did a good thing  
She could have been a poet  
Or she could have been a fool  
  
Oh you did a bad thing  
And Im not happy  
And Im not sad  
Oh  
  
And Im not happy  
And Im not sad  
Oh  
And Im not happy  
  
And Im not sad
