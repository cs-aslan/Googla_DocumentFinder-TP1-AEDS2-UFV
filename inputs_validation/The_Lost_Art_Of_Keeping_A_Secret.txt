Well Ive got a secret I cannot say  
Blame all the movement to give it away  
Youve got somethin I understand  
Holding it tightly caught on command  
Leap of faith do you doubt  
Cut you in I just cut you out  
  
Whatever you do  
Dont tell anyone  
Whatever you do  
Dont tell anyone  
  
Look for reflections in your face  
Canine devotion time cant erase  
Out on the corner locked in your room  
I never believe them and I never assume  
Still cant believe there is a lie  
Promises promise an eye for an eye  
Weve got something to reveal  
No one can know how we feel  
  
Whatever you do  
Dont tell anyone  
Whatever you do  
Dont tell anyone  
  
Whatever you do  
Dont tell anyone  
Whatever you do  
Dont tell  
  
I think you already know  
How far Id go not to say  
You know the art is gone  
And Im taking this all to the grave  
  
Whatever you do  
Dont tell anyone  
Whatever you do  
Dont tell anyone  
  
Whatever you do  
Dont tell anyone  
Whatever you do  
Dont tell
