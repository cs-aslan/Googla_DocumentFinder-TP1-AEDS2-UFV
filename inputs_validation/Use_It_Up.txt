Use it up  
Use it all up  
Dont save a thing for later  
If theres music out there laying in wait  
To pounce and drain every ounce if you  
Wait or hesitate  
And music thatll help you be tough  
And come together on more than  
Springsteen  
Though most days its been enough  
Then theres music that can take you away  
Away  
Away  
Away  
  
So use it up  
Use it all up  
Dont save a thing for later  
Use it up  
Use it all up  
Dont save a thing for later  
  
If theres music out there staying awake  
To cry and drain every eye until  
Hatreds eliminated  
And music that can help you feel great  
And come together in the fictive dream  
With a kind of Randy Newman take  
Theres music that can take you away  
Away  
Away  
Away  
Where we can jump to our feet agape  
Cause nothing is cruel  
And even if it is or was  
Indefeasibly cruel  
We dont care because  
Yer a fool  
Im a fool  
Yer a fool  
And Im a fool  
For music that can take you away  
For music that can take you away  
For music that can take you away  
  
So use it up  
Use it all up  
Dont save a thing for later
