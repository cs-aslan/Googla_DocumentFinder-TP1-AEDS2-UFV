If you need my love and you dont know why to do  
Cause you heard they are been running no rout  
If youre wandering if those stories are really too  
And youre wandering just were I can be found  
  
Just look inside your heart because there is wear I will be  
I wearing helped you no mere what to do  
Why cant you fight me  
Just look inside your heart my darling and than you will see  
You are the only one  
My love in daisy dark  
Thats all the high me  
Remember  
  
When the parties of one more lonely night again  
And you want to cry because youre love  
When you want my heart to make it all right again  
All you have to do his working your all  
Your all  
  
Just look inside your heart because there is wear I will be  
I wearing helped you no mere what to do  
Why cant you fight me  
Just look inside your heart my darling and than you will see  
You are the only one  
My love in daisy dark  
Thats all the high me  
Remember  
  
When the parties of one more lonely night again  
And you want to cry because youre love  
When you want my heart to make it all right again  
All you have to do his working your all  
Your all
