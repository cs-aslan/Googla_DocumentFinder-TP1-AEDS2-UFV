My Daddy was a bank robber  
But he never hurt nobody  
He just loved to live that way  
And he loved  
  
Never loved a shovel  
Break  
  
The old man spoke up in a bar  
Said I never been in prison  
  
Someday youll meet your rocking chair  
Cause thats where were spinning  
Theres  
  
Yeah  
My daddy was a bank robber  
But he never hurt nobody  
He  
  
Get away get away  
Money  
He loved to steal your money
