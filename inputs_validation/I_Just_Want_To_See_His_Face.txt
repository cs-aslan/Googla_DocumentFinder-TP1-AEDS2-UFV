Thats all right thats all right thats all right  
Sometimes you feel like trouble sometimes you feel down  
Let this music relax you mind let this music relax you mind  
Stand up and be counted cant get a witness  
Sometimes you need somebody if you have somebody to love  
Sometimes you aint got nobody and you want somebody to love  
Then you dont want to walk and talk about Jesus  
You just want to see his face  
You dont want to walk and talk about Jesus  
You just want to see his face
