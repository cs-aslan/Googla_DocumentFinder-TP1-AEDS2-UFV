You know youre making me nervous  
I dont know if the world deserves us  
Youre doing things I wouldnt mention  
You have a hunger for attention  
You know youre making me frantic  
Is this supposed to be romantic  
Youre like the woman out of Species  
I think Im gonna go to pieces  
  
You never do right  
For doing wrong  
Youd better get back where you belong  
You never do right  
Youre doing wrong  
Then running to me  
  
Love me well or love me badly  
Do you have to love me madly  
Saty for life or leave me sadly  
Do you have to  
  
youre really making me anxious  
You know that everybody blanks us  
Youre like a cocktail set Atilla  
A kind of holycon geurilla  
You know Im heading for a crackup  
Youre getting everybodys back up  
Im getting ready for a freak out  
What makes you think youre right to speak out  
  
You never back down youd rather fight  
Youre ready for combat day or night  
You never back down  
You start the fight  
The run behind me  
  
Love me well or love me badly  
Do you have to love me madly  
Stay for life or leave me sadly  
Please dont always love me madly  
  
Love me well or love me badly  
Do you have to love me madly  
Be my friend reject me gladly  
Do you have to  
  
I feel Im getting rather tense  
At the turn of these events  
I want to run away and hide  
But you keep dragging me inside  
Im tethered to a trainee hellcat  
Im feeling jealous of the doormat  
Im nearly fainting with the tension  
One day well end up in detention  
  
You never do right  
Youre doing wrong  
Youd better get back where you belong  
You never do right  
Youre always wrong  
Then running to me  
  
Love me well or love be badly  
  
Love me well or love me badly  
Do you have to love me madly  
Stay for life or leave me sadly  
Please dont always love me madly  
  
Love me well or love me badly  
Do you have to love me madly  
Be my friend reject me gladly  
Only dont you love me madly  
  
Love me madly
