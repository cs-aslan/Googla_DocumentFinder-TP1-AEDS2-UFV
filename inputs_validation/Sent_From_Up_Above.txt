I cant imagine  
Looking in someone elses eyes  
What we have surpasses  
Even paradise  
  
Its hard to fathom  
Reaching for someone elses hand  
What we share is magic  
Heaven had a plan  
  
Chorus  
Sent from up above  
So much love  
In my life  
I cant get enough  
Of your touchfeels so right  
Unending passion  
Somehow the fire never dies  
  
What we share  
Is everlasting  
Love without without demise  
He made it happen  
  
Placed so much joy into our hands  
What we dreamed  
We finally captured  
Heaven took command  
  
Chorus
