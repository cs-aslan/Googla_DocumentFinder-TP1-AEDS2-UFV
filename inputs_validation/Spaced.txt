Spaced in time child of nine  
Doin twenty years on the way  
Fire and steel earth unreal  
Find another planet to stay  
Papa died ma survived  
Tellin me about her ordeal  
And the soul she could not feel  
Cause they made her so unreal  
Lightnin years disappears  
Twenty million years on my brain  
Synthesize overrides  
Tryin to keep from goin insane  
And my soul I can not feel  
Cause they made me so unreal  
Spaced enough to know I feel theres nothin out there  
Spaced enough to know I feel I really dont care  
Spaced enough to feel Im really losin my mind  
And Im never never never never ever goin back  
Im off the track no one even knows Im alive  
Spaced without a trace  
Waitin for the word to arrive  
Im the last man to survive
