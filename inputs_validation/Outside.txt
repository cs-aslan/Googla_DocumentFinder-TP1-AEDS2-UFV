Verse 1  
Its hard to explain  
Inherently its just always been strange  
Neither here or there  
Always somewhat out of place everywhere  
Ambiguous  
Without a sense of belonging to touch  
Somewhere halfway  
Feeling theres no one completely the same  
  
Chorus  
Standing alone  
Eager to just  
Believe its good enough to be what  
You really are  
But in your heart  
Uncertainty forever lies  
And youll always be  
Somewhere on the  
Outside  
  
Verse 2  
Early on you face  
The realization you dont  
have a space  
Where you fit in  
And recognize you  
Were born to exist  
  
Chorus  
Standing alone  
Eager to just  
Believe its good enough to be what  
You really are  
But in your heart  
Uncertainty forever lies  
And youll always be  
Somewhere on the  
Outside  
  
And its hard Repeat x2  
  
Bridge  
Irreversibly  
Falling in between  
And its hard Repeat 1  
To be understood  
As you are Repeat 1  
  
Oh and God knows  
That youre standing on your own  
Blind and unguided  
Into a world divided  
Youre thrown  
Where youre never quite the same  
Although you trytry and try  
To tell yourself  
You really are  
But in your heartuncertainty forever lies  
And youll always be  
Somewhere on the outside
