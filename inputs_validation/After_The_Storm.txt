Heats up teas brewed  
Clothes strewn around the room  
Looks like a wind swept through  
Made a wild man out of you  
And doesnt anger turn you on  
And expectation of a calm  
After the storm  
And your body feels so warm  
After the storm  
  
The winds pulling the moon down  
under the eiderdown  
Youre taking me to town  
And youre tossing me around  
You come on like a hurricane  
Im settling like youre weathervane  
After the storm  
And your body feels so warm  
After the storm
