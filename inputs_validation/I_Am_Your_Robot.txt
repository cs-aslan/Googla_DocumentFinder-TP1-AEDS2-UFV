Ive been beaming aboard her for a light year  
From a strange craft  
Shes got a subtle touch on the silver key  
To a clockwork heart  
  
I am your robot I am your robot  
I am your robot man  
I am your robot I am your robot  
I am your robot man  
  
You went and flipped the switch and turned me positive  
When I was negative  
Ive been stumbling around like a metal man  
On the graveyard shift  
  
I am your robot and Im programmed to love you  
My serial number is 44357
