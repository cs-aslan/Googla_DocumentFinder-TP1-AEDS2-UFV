So youre on the floor at Fifty Four  
Think you can last  at the Palace  
Does your body go to the to and fro  
But tonights the night  or didnt you know  
That Ivan meets GI Joe  
  
He tried his tricks that Ruskie bear  
The United Nations said its all fair  
He did the radiation  the chemical plague  
But he could not win  with a Cossack spin  
  
The Vostok Bomb  the Stalin strike  
He tried every move  he tried to hitch hike  
He drilled a hole  like a Russian star  
He made every move in his repertoire  
  
When Ivan meet GI Joe  
  
Now it was GI Joes turn to blow  
He turned it on  cool and slow  
He tried a payphone call to the Pentagon  
A radar scan  a leviathan  
  
He wiped the Earth  clean as a plate  
What does it take to make a Ruskie break  
But the crowd are bored and off they go  
Over the road to watch China blow  
  
When Ivan meets GI Joe
