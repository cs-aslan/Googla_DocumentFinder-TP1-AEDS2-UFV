All the life she has seen  
All the meaner side of me  
They took away the prophets dream  
For a profit on the street  
Now shes stronger than you know  
A heart of steel starts to grow  
  
All his life hes been told  
Hell be nothing when hes old  
All the kicks and all the blows  
He will never let it show  
Cause hes stronger than you know  
A heart of steel starts to grow  
  
Chorus  
When youve been fighting for it all your life  
Youve been struggling to make things right  
Thats a how a superhero learns to fly  
Every day every hour turn that pain into power  
When youve fighting for it all your life  
Youve been working every day and night  
Thats a how a superhero learns to fly  
Every day every hour turn that pain into power  
  
Verse 2  
All the hurt all the lies all the tears that they cry  
When the moment is just right  
Youll see fire in their eyes because hes stronger than you know  
A heart of steel starts to grow  
  
Chorus  
When youve been fighting for it all your life  
Youve been struggling to make things right

When youve fighting for it all your life  
Youve been working every day and night  
Thats a how a superhero learns to fly  
Every day every hour turn that pain into power  
  
Every day every hour turn that pain into power  
  
Every day every hour turn that pain into power

Bridge  
Shes got a lions in her heart a fire in his soul  
Hes a got a beast in his belly but its so hard to control  
Cause theyve taken too much hits take it blow by blow  
Now light a match stand back watch them explode
