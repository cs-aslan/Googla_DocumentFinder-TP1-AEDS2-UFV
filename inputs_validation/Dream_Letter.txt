Lady time fly away  
Ive been thinking bout my yesterday  
Oh please listen darlin to my empty prayers  
Sleep inside my dreams tonight  
All I need to know tonight are you and my child  
  
Oh is he a soldier or is he a dreamer  
Is he mamas little man  
Does he help you when he can  
Or does he ask about me  
  
Just like a soldier boy  
I been out fighting wars  
That the world never knows about  
But I never win them loud  
Theres no crowds around me  
  
But when I get to thinkin  
Bout the old days  
When love was here to stay  
I wonder if wed ever tried  
Oh what Id give to hold him
