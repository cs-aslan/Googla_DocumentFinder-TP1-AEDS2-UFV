She wants a place in heaven  
But she cannot face the truth  
She lives on a rope of selfpity  
It only requires a noose  
  
Why are the ones so afraid 2 live  
Much more afraid 2 die  
Its as easy 2 imagine laughing  
  
When U really hear a cry  
And they sound the same  
In hell they sound the same  
U want a place in heaven  
  
Maybe Ure already there  
Lifes what U make it stop whining baby  
  
Love comes 2 those who care  
There must be children in heaven  
Ones who know nothing from hate  
  
3yearold leaders of all colors  
Id feel safer with them in control control control control  
3yearolds in control  
  
We all want a place in heaven  
Suites of that level are few  
Lets not be lazy theres no room service  
  
Its all up 2 me and U  
Lets not be lazy theres no room service  
Its all up 2 me and U
