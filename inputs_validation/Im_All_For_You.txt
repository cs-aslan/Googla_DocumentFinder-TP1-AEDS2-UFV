Let our friends say what they want to say  
If Im wrong Ill be the one to pay  
No matter if its true  
Youll find that Im all for you  
  
Let the cards predict well drift apart  
And the stars forfeit of broken heart  
No matter it they do  
Youll find that Im all for you  
  
I only know come what may  
Youll always find me by your side  
I may be a fool  
Time alone will decide  
  
Let them all say that its just a game  
And Im sure to lose  
But just the same no matter if I do  
Youll find that Im all for you
