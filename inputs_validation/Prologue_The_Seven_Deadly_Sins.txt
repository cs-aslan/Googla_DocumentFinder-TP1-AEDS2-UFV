Anna I  
  
So my sister and I left Louisiana  
Where the moon on the Mississippi is ashining ever  
Like you always hear in the songs of dixie  
We look forward to our homecoming  
And the sooner the better  
  
Anna ii  
  
And the sooner the better  
  
Anna I  
  
Its a month already since we started  
For the great big cities where you go to make money  
In seven years our fortune will be made  
And then we can go back  
  
Anna ii  
  
In six years would be much nicer  
  
Anna I  
  
Our mom and dad and both our brothers wait in old Louisiana  
And well send them all our money as we make it  
  
For all the moneys got to go to build a little house  
Down by the Mississippi in Louisiana  
Right Anna  
  
Anna ii  
  
Yes Anna  
  
Anna I  
  
Shes the one with the looks Im realistic
