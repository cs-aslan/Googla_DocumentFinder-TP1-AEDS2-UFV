A little bit of me and a whole lot of you  
Add a dash of starlight and a dozen roses too  
Then let it rise for a hundred years or two  
And thats the recipe for making love  
  
It doesnt need sugar cause its already sweet  
It doesnt need an oven cause its got a lot of heat  
Just add a dash of kisses to make it all complete  
And thats the recipe for making love  
  
And if youve made it right youll know it  
Its not like anything youve made before  
And if youve made it wrong youll know it  
cause it wont keep you coming back for more  
  
I didnt get it from my grandmas book upon the shelf  
I didnt get it from a magical and culinary elf  
No a little birdie told me you cant make it by yourself  
And thats the recipe for making love
