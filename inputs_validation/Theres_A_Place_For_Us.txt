Theres a place for us somewhere a time and a place  
  
So here we are together  
Just you and me  
Sitting side by side  
Dont know why  
With time just racing by  
But I dont want to go  
  
Well I dont know much about it  
Cause all I am is what you see  
In front of you  
Theres no more  
Feels so close and yet so far  
But I dont want to go  
  
Here I am take my hand  
Here I am please take my hand  
  
Id like to sit here with you if thats alright  
If you dont mind I could sit and stare all night  
Sit here waiting for you to hold me tight  
  
Its sad but I know its true  
You see I know you well  
Youd only laugh at me  
And that would hurt me so  
Just look at me here  
Youve got me pleading with you  
But I dont want to go  
  
Cause you know that I love you so  
Yes you know that I love you so  
  
Here I will be here love  
For you love I will always be here love  
  
If you look real close  
Youll see my heart is on my sleeve  
And itll be here waiting  
Waiting for you waiting for me  
Someone once said that if you truly truly believe  
You can make things happen  
Make things appear to be all that they seem  
Tell me do you believe  
  
Well find a hideaway  
Together well find a way  
Somewhere somehow well find some way  
There must be somewhere  
There must be someplace  
We can find somewhere  
Where they dont know my face  
Believe me we can find it  
Yes we can find it  
Somewhere theres a place for us  
Somewhere a time and a place for us  
Somewhere
