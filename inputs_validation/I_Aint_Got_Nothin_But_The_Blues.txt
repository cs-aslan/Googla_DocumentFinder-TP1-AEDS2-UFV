Aint got the change of a nickel  
Aint got no bounce in my shoes  
Aint go no fancy to tickle  
  
I aint got nothing but the blues  
Aint got no coffee thats perking  
Aint got no winnings to lose  
  
Aint got a dream that is working  
I aint got nothing but the blues  
When trumpets flare up  
  
I keep my hair up  
I just cant make it come down  
Believe me peppie  
I cant get happy  
  
Since my ever loving baby left town  
Aint got no rest in my slumbers  
Aint got no feelings to bruise  
Aint got no telephone numbers  
I aint got nothing but the blues
