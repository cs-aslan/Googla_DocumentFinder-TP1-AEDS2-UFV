Chorus  
Im not saying this to shake you up  
Im just saying this to wake you up  
Its all good when we making love  
All I ask is dont take our love  
For granted its granted  
My love for you is real  
Baby if you dont love me  
Somebody else will so baby girl  
Dont you ever get too comfortable  
  
Yeah to the left to the left  
If you wanna leave be my guest you can step  
Feeling irreplaceable listen to Beyonce  
But OK Ill put you out on your Bday  
Now if you rocking with Weezy  
Bedroom in the bank baby we safe  
I got game like EA  
But I wanna let you play  
And dont I treat you like souffle  
Dont I look at you like a I see a new day  
And dont I do what I do say  
Im threw talking so Im a let you face  
And let ya do ya  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah let me catch my breath  
You talking bout leave baby you aint gone yet  
And if you leave leave correct  
And Im a send a jet to pick up the next  
And if you leave your leaving the best  
So you would have to settle for less  
I am no Elliot Ness I dont handcuff I dont arrest  
I do confess to the virginsy  
Cause under them sheets I am a mess  
Yes baby you blessed  
Not chess dont jump ya ness  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah its no sweat no sweat  
I will never 1 2 3 4get  
About you your love your sex  
You know I work you out like bowflex  
Our jokes no stress love  
Live life proceed progress  
Make sure the neighbors get no rest  
We can get together never disconnect  
Your back your neck  
Funny how that song hasnt got old yet to us  
So lets project you stay in  
Never in correct  
Face
