Star people  
Counting your money until your soul turns green  
Star people  
Counting the cost of your desire to be seen  
  
I do not count myself among you  
I may have been living in a dream  
Its just there seem so many of you  
Cant help but hope theres a difference between  
  
And if I live to be a hundred and one  
I will never understand what you are honey  
  
Im looking for sympathy  
Just get me on NBC  
And wheres the hells my dumb ass PR  
  
I said maybe your mama gave you up boy  
Its the same old same old  
I said maybe your daddy didnt love you enough girl  
How much is enough  
  
Star people  
Never forget your secrets safe with me  
Just look at all the wonderful people  
Trying to forget just who and what they have been  
  
Oh its a dream  
With a nightmare stuck in the middle  
Are you serious Im just curious  
Without all this attention  
Youd die  
Id die  
Wed die Wouldnt we baby  
  
And if I live to be a hundred and one  
I will never understand what you are  
Im talking to you  
Youre looking for sympathy from people who work to eat  
And they dont really seem to mind  
  
I said maybe your mama gave you up boy  
Its the same old same old  
I said maybe baby your daddy didnt love you enough girl  
  
How much is enough  
How much is enough  
How much is enough  
Are you serious Im just curious  
Are you serious Im just curious  
  
Yeah more glycerin  
Lets go back to the day  
DJ Why do you wanna tell me that  
DJ Get yourself some Oprah cash  
Is that what makes a star  
  
Did you get off on a bad foot baby  
Do you have a little tale to tell  
Did you get off on a bad foot bad bad foot  
Is that why youre a star  
  
Do you really think youve got it so hard  
Do you think it might do you some good to look around you  
And decide how you might feel  
If the pain you felt was real  
Tell me  
  
Now nothing comes for nothing baby  
That fame and fortunes heaven sent  
And who gives a fuck about your problems darling  
Cause you can pay the rent  
You can pay
