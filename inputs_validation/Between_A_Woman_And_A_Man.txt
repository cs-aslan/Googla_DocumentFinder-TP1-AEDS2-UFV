ruby hice danny hice  
  
Some folks say that a mothers love is sweeter than the rest  
When her babys nestled in her arms and feeding at her breast  
But i cant explain the feeling when you reach and touch my hand  
Because there nothing like the love between and woman and a man  
  
Chorus  
Its a miracle from heaven  
That it fills me through and through  
Like a feeling that surrounds us  
Touching me touching you  
When you wrap your love around me its not hard to understand  
Why theres nothing like the love between and woman and a man  
  
Well the fathers love is quiet  
But its there for all to see  
When a little boy is laughing bouncing on his daddys knee  
Then those great big hands reach down to tuck his little cowboy in  
But theres nothing like the love between a woman and a man  
Repeat chorus 4 times
