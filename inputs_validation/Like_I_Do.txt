Cant hear mistakes I make a lot of  
But in a couple of categories I do  
I blow the competition out of the water  
  
Theres only 2 things in this world  
That Im the best at its true  
Number 1 is music and baby girl  
Number 2 cant nobody rock your body out  
Like I do like I do like I do

To paint a portrait of love

So you can fly through the heavens above

Cant hear mistakes I make a lot of  
But in a couple of categories I do  
Blow the competition out of the water

That Im the best at its true  
Number 1 is music and baby girl  
Number 2 cant nobody rock your body out  
Like I do like I do like I do
