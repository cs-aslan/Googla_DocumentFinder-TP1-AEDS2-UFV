Raise the sights the city lights are calling  
Were hot tonight the time is right theres nitro in the air  
In the street is where well meet were warning  
On the beat we wont retreat beware  
  
Thousands of cars and a million guitars  
Screaming with power in the air  
Weve found the place where the decibels race  
This army of rock will be there  
  
To ram it down ram it down  
Straight through the heart of this town  
Ram it down ram it down  
Razing the place to the ground  
Ram it down  
  
Bodies revvin in leather heaven in wonder  
Lights are dimmin and heads are swimmin  
As thunder hits the stage  
Hell breaks loose turn on the juice get stronger  
We metal maniacs begin to rave  
  
Thousands of cars and a million guitars  
Screaming with power in the air  
Weve found the place where the decibels race  
This army of rock will be there  
  
To ram it down ram it down  
Straight through the heart of this town  
Ram it down ram it down  
Razing the place to the ground  
Ram it down  
  
Shout it out were all together now  
Shout it out we join as one one  
  
Thousands of cars and a million guitars  
Screaming with power in the air  
Weve found the place where the decibels race  
This army of rock will be there  
  
To ram it down ram it down  
Straight through the heart of this town  
Ram it down ram it down  
Razing the place to the ground  
Ram it down
