I told you once about a place  
That I had accidentally stumbled upon  
Can you imagine how it feels to find somewhere  
That you can do no wrong  
But its alright youre safe in my hands  
  
Ill meet you in the sky tonight  
And we will trace some undiscovered stars  
Well go beyond the universe beyond all understanding  
Hey its not that far  
But its alright I feel safe in your hands  
  
I cant stand living this way  
Getting by from day to day  
Im drinking from your loving cup  
I told you things were looking cup  
Oh oh oh so good  
Oh it feels so good  
  
Were all the same but then again  
Were all quite different in our own peculiar ways  
Weve come so far and now were going through another phase  
But its alright  
We made it so far  
  
I cant stand living this way  
Getting by from day to day  
Im drinking from your loving cup  
Told you things were looking cup  
  
As we all know its hard to breathe  
When something spiritual has taken place  
We dont know why we dont know how  
Weve been transformed into a state of grace  
But its alright  
We walk in our sleep  
Yes its alright  
This is rapture of the deep
