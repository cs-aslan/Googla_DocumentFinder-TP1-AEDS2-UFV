Little Billy was the fattest kid in his class  
Always the last in line  
All the other little kids would laugh at him  
Said hed die before his time  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha  
Little Billy didnt mind  
  
Most of the kids smoked cigarettes  
Just to prove that they were cool  
The teacher didnt know about the childrens games  
And Billy always followed the rules  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha  
Little Billy didnt mind  
  
Billy was big on the outside  
But theres an even bigger man inside  
Ten million cigarettes burning every day  
And Billys still doing fine  
  
Now Billy and his classmates are middleaged  
With children of their own  
Their smoking games are reality now  
And cancers seed is sown  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha  
Little Billys didnt mind  
  
Most of them smoke maybe forty a day  
A habit Billy doesnt share  
One by one theyre passing away  
Leaving orphans to Billys care  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha  
Little Billy doesnt mind  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha  
Little Billys doing fine
