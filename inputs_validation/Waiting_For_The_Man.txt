Cruisin on down to my street corner  
Where me and my friends hang out  
Im pickin up Billy along the way  
Man he knows what its all about  
Jed knows some chicks that can be had  
Hes got his old mans car  
You know that cant be bad  
Phil just got numbered in a fight  
But we all jumped in now ol Phils alright  
  
Hangin out together on the street  
Lookin so hot we cant be beat  
Keepin so cool when we get hassled  
Takin our time to move along  
And if youre lookin to start some trouble  
  
Man you dont know what youre takin on  
Me and Billy all the guys  
Fat Marie with the friendly eyes  
She aint so pretty but ooh my my my  
Street corner people waitin for the man  
Just me and Billy and all the guys  
Fat Marie with the friendly eyes  
She aint so pretty but ooh my my my  
Street corner people were waitin for the man  
  
Shootin our job to the local ladies  
Showin them such a good time  
Drinkin our wine and gettin crazy  
And movin on down the line  
Just me and Billy all the guys  
Fat Marie with the friendly eyes  
She aint so pretty but ooh my my my  
Were just street corner people waitin for the man  
  
Me and Billy all the guys  
Fat Marie with the friendly eyes  
She aint so pretty but ooh my my my  
Street corner people waitin for the man  
Were just street corner people  
Were waitin for the man
