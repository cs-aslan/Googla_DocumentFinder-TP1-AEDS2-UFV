Youre not like anybody I ever knew  
But that dont mean that I dont know where we are  
And though I find myself attracted to you  
This time Im trying not to go too far cause  
  
No matter how it starts it ends the same  
Someones always doing someone more  
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain  
Its only gonna happen again  
  
Chorus  
Its the fallin in love thats makin me high  
Its the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
Its the fallin in love thats makin me high  
Its the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
All night all night  
  
And though Im trying not to look in your eyes  
Each time I do they kind of burn right through me  
Dont want to lay down in a bed full of lies  
And yet my heart is saying come and do me  
  
Bridge  
Now were just a web of mystery  
A possibility of more to come  
Id rather leave the fantasy of what might be  
But here I go falling again  
  
Its the fallin in love thats makin me high  
Its the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
Its the fallin in love thats makin me high  
Its the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
Its the fallin in love thats makin me high  
Its the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
Its the fallin in love thats makin me high  
Its the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
Over you over you all night  
  
Chorus
