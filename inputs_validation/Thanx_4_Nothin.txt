Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Thanx for nothin  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
You were just playin a game  
  
I cant even know what to say  
Ive been hurt Ive been played  
And Im so shamed  
I cant even cry its that deep  
You just lie and you cheat  
Like its nothin  
  
See you said that you loved me too  
And so I trusted you  
But I guess that subconsciously I knew  
But I didnt wanna face the truth  
That I was only being used  
And you was just frontin  
Hey boy thanx for nothin  
  
Chorus  
I never knew enough about you babe  
And I guess I only have myself to blame  
Now Im brokenhearted and shattering  
Cause you were just playin a game  
Nothin anyone could do to convince me babe  
I was livin in a lie just a masquerade  
Now I only know that Ill never be the same  
But you were just playin a game  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Thanx for nothin  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
You were just playin a game  
  
Every day and every night  
I stay by the phone  
Never go no place so just in case  
You call Ill be home  
Seems like what I do is  
Think about our pseudo romance  
While youre somewhere burnin diesel  
In the streets havin laughs  
  
Somebody say you know what Im going through  
You been left with nothin too  
Too much you cant count on one hand  
Singing 3456  
7 days a week youre drowning in tears  
He was so insincere  
Now youre layin up in bed  
Every night singing  
Hey boy thanx for nothin  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
So thanx for nothin  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
So thanx for nothin
