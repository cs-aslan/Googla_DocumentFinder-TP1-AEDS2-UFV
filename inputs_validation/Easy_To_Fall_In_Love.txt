First you meet her on the street and then you see her in your sleep  
Well its so easy to fall in love  
Youll find her love is good and true that shes the only girl for you  
Well its so easy to fall in love  
  
But dont forget it takes both two to make love thats good and true  
And then youll find she loves you too and theres nothing left to do  
Buy diamond rings and make some plans to go and see the preacher man  
Well its so easy to fall in love  
  
But dont forget it takes both two to make love thats good and true  
And then youll find she loves you too and theres nothing left to do  
Buy diamond rings and make some plans to go and see the preacher man  
Well its so easy to fall in love
