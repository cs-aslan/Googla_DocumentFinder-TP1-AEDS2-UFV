One man standing on the plains of Abraham  
Watching the damaged sunrise  
One man standing near the edge of a quiet breakdown  
  
I watch the sea it helps to anchor me  
I watch the sea it helps to anchor me  
  
Once you start hiding you keep on hiding  
Till your paranoia calms down  
Once you start watching you keep on watching  
Till youre tied up and your spell bound  
  
Just between the ice ages anyway  
I want to talk but I havent got too much to say  
I dont mean to be so Nihilistic  
Forgive me if I seem to be too realistic  
  
Once you start running you keep on running  
Till your muscles start to break down  
Once you start falling you keep on falling  
Till you hit the cold cold ground  
  
I watch TV  What do you want from me  
I watch TV  What do you want from me  
  
Just between the ice ages anyway  
I want to talk I havent got enough to say  
I dont mean to be so nihilistic  
Forgive me if I seem to be too realistic  
  
Once you start hiding you keep on hiding  
Till you feel youre safe and sound  
Once you start watching you keep on watching  
Till youre tied up and youre spell bound  
  
I watch the sea it helps to anchor me  
I watch the sea I saw it on TV
