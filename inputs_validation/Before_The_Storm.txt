Red gates of iron cast their  
Black shadows on this land  
Dividing souls far below  
The gathering winds the armies watch  
Are rising from the west  
Foretelling news of freedoms hand  
  
In secrecy theyve infiltrated  
All of our strongholds  
Controlling more year after year  
So weve let this happen all along  
Believing whats been said  
Our leaders cry we have no one to fear  
  
We watch the sun rise and hope  
We watch the sun rise and hope  
That it wont be our last  
Before the storm  
Before the storm  
Before the storm  
Before the storm  
  
Is it late to try must we all die  
Our system awaits testv Freedom by choice  
is it for all men best  
So we wait in fear the atom split  
Our hearts in two be torn  
Learn from the past before the storm  
  
We watch the sunrise and hope  
We watch the sunrise and hope  
That it wont be our last
