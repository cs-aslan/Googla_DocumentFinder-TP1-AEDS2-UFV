I dont understand why Im crazy  
Over you I dont know what to do  
I dont understand why Im crazy  
Over you I dont know what to do  
  
If I had to  
I would give up everything just to feel and be with you  
If I had to  
I would pawn the ring you gave to me just to feed you  
If I had to  
I would give my very last breath just to help save you  
If I had to  
I would tell a lie just because I know you are the truth  
  
Id ride for you  
Cuz your the truth  
Id die for you  
Ooh cuz Im a fool inlove with you  
And ill do anything that pleases you  
Only you  
  
If I had to  
I would throw away my only wish just to prove to you  
If I had to  
I would die all alone if living meant without you  
If I had to  
I would go through all the pain again just to find you  
If I had to  
Id surrender all my love just because I love you  
  
I dont understand why Im crazy  
Over you I dont know what to do  
I dont understand why Im crazy  
Over you I dont know what to do  
  
Id ride for you  
Cuz your the truth  
Id die for you  
Ooh cuz Im a fool inlove with you  
And ill do anything that pleases you  
  
Id ride for you  
Cuz your the truth  
Id die for you  
Ooh cuz Im a fool inlove with you  
And ill do anything that pleases you  
  
I wanna run to you breathe as one with you  
Absent in time without you existing only for you  
Every dream is of you only turn to you  
Baby my love  
Only for you  
  
Id ride for you  
Cuz your the truth  
Id die for you  
Ooh cuz Im a fool inlove with you  
And ill do anything that pleases you

Id ride for you  
Cuz your the truth  
Id die for you  
Ooh cuz Im a fool inlove with you  
And ill do anything that pleases you
