Goodbye bye bye bye forever  
Goodbye bye bye bye my love  
How can you say you still love me  
When seen in the arms of a friend  
The flame that burns for me is dying slowly  
Its time we both wake up lets not pretend  
  
Goodbye bye bye bye forever  
Goodbye bye bye bye my love  
Were fooling ourselves just by thinking  
Lets not pretend anymore  
You can stop writing me letters  
I took my phone off the hook  
I dont have time to play around with romance  
Its love I want so please lets not pretend  
  
Goodbye bye bye bye forever  
Goodbye bye bye bye my love  
Were fooling ourselves just by thinking  
Lets not pretend anymore
