Kiss me onceand kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again  
Its been a long long time  
Havent felt like this my dear  
Since i cant remember when  
Its been a long long time  
  
Youll never know how many dreams  
Ive dreamed about you  
Or just how empty they all seemed without you  
So kiss me once then kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again  
Its been a long long time  
  
Oh kiss me onceand kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again  
Its been a longsuch a long time  
I havent felt like this my dear  
Since i dont remember when  
Its been a longbeen a mighty long time  
  
Youll never know how many dreams  
Ive dreamed about you  
Or how empty they all seem without you  
So kiss me onceand kiss me twice  
And kiss me once again  
Its been a longlong time  
  
Its been a mighty mighty long time
