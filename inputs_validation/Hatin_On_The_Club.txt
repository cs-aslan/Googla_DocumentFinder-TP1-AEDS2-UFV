Now this be the last time you did me wrong  
No more laying up in your arms  
No calling saying you want me back  
Im packing my bags what you think about that  
  
Stayed at home like a good girl do  
But Tonight baby you got me sad and blue  
I just heard about the girl in your car yall kissing at the bar  
Got me crying  
  
Chorus  
Ohhh you got me hatin on the club  
Cause you took my love  
Oh you took my love  
Now you got me like whoahhh  
You got me hatin on the club  
Cause you took my love  
Whyd you have to take my love  
Whoahh  
  
And you can be mad at me all you want  
I aint coming in Ill be waiting out front  
Coming out the door with your girlfriend  
You did me wrong boy tell me where our love went  
  
Stayed at home like a good girl do  
But Tonight baby you got me sad and blue  
I just heard about the girl in your car yall kissing at the bar  
Got me crying  
  
Chorus  
Ohhh you got me hatin on the club  
Cause you took my love  
Oh you took my love  
Now you got me like whoahhh  
You got me hatin on the club  
Cause you took my love  
Whyd you have to take my love  
Whoahh  
  
Now this is the sound of a broken heart  
Theres only one reason why were apart  
She never woulda made it to your car  
If it wasnt for the club Id still have my love  
We would still have us  
Id still have my love  
We would still have us  
  
But now were like whoahhhh  
  
Ohhh you got me hatin on the club  
Cause you took my love  
Oh you took my love  
  
But now now were like whoahhh  
You got me hatin on the club  
You took my love  
Oh you took my love
