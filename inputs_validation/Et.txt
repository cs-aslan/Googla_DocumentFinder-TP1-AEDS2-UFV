Youre so hypnotizing  
Could you be the devil could you be an angel  
Your touch magnetizing  
Feels like Im floating leaves my body glowing  
  
They say be afraid  
Youre not like the others futuristic lovers  
Different DNA they dont understand you  
  
Youre from a whole other world  
A different dimension  
You open my eyes  
And Im ready to go lead me into the light  
  
Kiss me kkkiss me  
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison  
Take me tttake me  
Wanna be a victim ready for abduction  
Boy youre an alien your touch so foreign  
Its supernatural extraterrestrial  
  
Youre so supersonic  
Wanna feel your powers stun me with your lasers  
Your kiss is cosmic every move is magic  
  
Youre from a whole other world  
A different dimension  
You open my eyes  
And Im ready to go lead me into the light  
  
Kiss me kkkiss me  
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison  
Take me tttake me  
Wanna be your victim ready for abduction  
Boy youre an alien your touch so foreign  
Its supernatural extraterrestrial  
  
There is this transcendental on another level  
Boy youre my lucky star  
I wanna walk on your wave length  
And be there when you vibrate  
For you I risk it all all  
  
Kiss me kkkiss me  
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison  
Take me tttake me  
Wanna be your victim ready for abduction  
Boy youre an alien your touch so foreign  
Its supernatural extraterrestrial  
Extraterrestrial extraterrestrial  
  
Boy youre an alien your touch so foreign  
Its supernatural extraterrestrial
