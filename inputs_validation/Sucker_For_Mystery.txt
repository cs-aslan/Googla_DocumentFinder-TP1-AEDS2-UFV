And Ive always been a sucker for mystery  
And Ive always been a sucker for mystery  
And Ive always been a sucker for mystery  
And Ive always been a sucker for mystery  
  
So I turn to the left and I turn to the right  
But none of the answers are in sight  
So I made a mistake maybe once or twice  
And I cant even get to paradise  
And a priest came up to me and touched my face  
He said terrible things happen round this place  
Such terrible things happen round this place  
Such terrible things happen round this place  
No demon no man has got a clue  
But surely son the end will turn out right for you  
Cause Ive always been a sucker for mystery  
And Ive always been a sucker for mystery  
  
Theres a little boy walking up the stairs  
Through a dark hallway that leads nowhere  
He comes to a door but hes afraid to knock  
And he bends down low and peers throught the lock  
And theres a tall man standing with a glistening knife  
And hes stooping over something that has no life  
With stifled tears he starts to turn away  
But a strange little voice seems to whisper  
Stay  
Hes always been a sucker for mystery  
And hes always been  
  
Chorus  
I dont want to say good bye  
I want to give it one more try  
I dont want to say good bye  
I want to give it one more try  
  
Wont somebody help  
Wont somebody help  
Im all alone now with nothing to do  
And Im all dressed up with nowhere to go  
And Im stuck with two tickets to an awful show  
And my mouths full of words but Ive got nothing to say  
And Ive been sitting in front of the TV set all day  
And my heads in a vice and it wont let up  
And my feet wont move and if that aint enough  
The telephone rings Hello  
  
Ive seen children with such angry faces  
When you look in their eyes it makes you want to cry  
Theres a time and a place for everything  
Theres a time and a place for everything  
  
Now it doesnt seem fair  
But who cares theyre someone elses  
As long as they dont come close to mine  
Theres a time and a place for everything  
Theres a time and a place for everything  
  
So we packed our bags and went back to the hotel  
In back of the squalor and the living hell  
And they sell you this and they sell you that  
They sell you their sister for a buck and a half  
Such terrible things happen round this place  
Such terrible things happen round this place  
Such terrible things happen round this place  
And people disappear without a trace  
And Ive always been a sucker for mystery  
And Ive always been  
  
Well the mystery that intrigues me the most  
Is the one that makes men give up hope  
The pride and the search for even little things  
That might give a meaning or even a hint  
Cause how can a free man not have hope  
When he hasnt even reached the end of his rope  
  
I dont want to say good bye  
I want to give it one more try  
I dont want to close the gate  
I still think that its not too late  
I know when I reach the end  
I want to start all over again  
  
And Ive always been a sucker for mystery
