I dont believe in miracles if its all the same by you  
Your wishes would come true if I had my say  
Whether its right or wrong the words of every song  
Remind us of a love we knew  
Where love should not go wrong in yesterdays  
Hang on ye drifters now  
You got so much to go and gamble on  
Watch out for the shifting sand  
Where ever you may ramble  
Even now as I look back and see all thats come to pass  
I cant remember how it was I got here  
Look around this place theres a smile on every face  
Were somewhere in the afterglow out there among the stars  
Out there among the bars  
Hang on ye drifters now  
You got places to go and people to meet  
Watch out for the shifting tide  
Where ever you may travel  
I know I should not complain because lifes been good to me  
It feels real good to be stranded on my own  
Be that as it may be we are what we are  
Ill find you in the afterglow out there among the stars  
Of yesteryear  
Hang on ye drifters now  
You got so much to go and gamble on  
Watch out for the shifting sand  
Where ever you may ramble  
All you drifters now  
You got places to go and people to meet  
Watch out for the shifting tide  
Where ever you may travel
