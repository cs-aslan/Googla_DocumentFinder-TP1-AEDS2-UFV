Why does the sun go on shining  
Why does the sea rush to shore  
Dont they know its the end of the world  
Cause you dont love me anymore  
Why do the birds go on singing  
Why do the stars glow above  
Dont they know its the end of the world  
It ended when I lost your love  
I wake up in the morning and I wonder  
Why everythings the same as it was  
I cant understand no I cant understand  
How life goes on the way it does  
Why does my heart go on beating  
Why do these eyes of mine cry  
Dont they know know its the end of the world  
It ended when you said goodbye  
Dont they know know its the end of the world  
It ended when you said goodbye
