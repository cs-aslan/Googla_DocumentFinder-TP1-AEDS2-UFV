No Nuclear War  
We dont want no nuclear war  
With nuclear war we wont get far  
I said that We dont want no nuclear war  
With nuclear war we wont get far  
Said no just another holocaust  
Its just another holocaust  
And we cant take no more  
Chorus  
Too many people are hungry  
They dont have food to eat  
They are naked  
Cause they dont have clothes to wear  
They are going insane  
Because of the condition  
A million babies  
Are suffering from malnutrition  
Chorus  
I cant take no more  
I saw wwi  
Where lotsa trouble begun  
I saw wwii  
When the pirates came right through  
Lookin for wwiii  
But you got to set me free  
Free from the chains  
And this here misery  
Chorus  
We cant take no more  
Unemployment  
I said the rate is high  
So much sick people  
Im sure they gonna die  
So much mad people  
Gettin ready to explode  
Fore somebody  
Come help them carry this load  
Chorus  
One country deploying mx  
Another country deploying ss  
Inflation goin way up high  
And the dollar is going way down low  
Chorus  
Crying bawling they cant take no more  
I hear them moaning they cant take no more  
They dont wanna die  
They want to go to Heaven yeah  
But they cant  
They cant take no more  
They gettin low  
They cant take no more  
They gettin grief  
They cant take no more  
They gettin beat  
They cant take no more  
They gettin lazy  
Cause They cant take no more  
Bored  
They cant take no more  
Frustrated  
They cant take no more  
Pleading for them  
They cant take no more  
Cant you hear me pleading for them  
Cause They cant take no more  
They want to live in peace  
And happiness  
Let the trees grow  
Let the waters flow
