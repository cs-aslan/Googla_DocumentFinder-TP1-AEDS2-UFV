If all we talk about is money  
Nothing will be funny honey  
And now that everyones a critic  
Its makin my mascara runny  
If we only talk about the Heathers  
Making it together is crazy  
If we dont get a new situation  
For our busted nation were lazy  
  
But its gonna be  
Its gonna be  
Please make it be  
Its gonna be  
  
Now if a princess becomes human  
Dont stone her on a talk show youll ruin  
Cause theres a fine line between a skewer  
And a decent sense of humor  
Aim at the ones whove really hurt us  
They should be arrested for murders  
But then all the cameras were turned on  
Some skinny naked blond eating burgers  
  
But its gonna be  
Its gonna be  
Its gonna be  
Its gonna be  
  
Its gonna be  
Its gonna be  
Please make it be  
Lets make it be  
  
Its gonna be  
Its gonna be  
Its gonna be  
Be be be be
