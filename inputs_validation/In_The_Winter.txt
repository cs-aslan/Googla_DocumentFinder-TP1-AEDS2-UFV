The days are okay  
I watch the TV in the afternoon  
If I get lonely  
The sound of other voices  
Other rooms are near to me  
Im not afraid  
  
The operator  
She tells the time  
Its good for a laugh  
And theres always radio  
And for a dime I can talk to God  
Dialaprayer  
Are you there  
Do you care  
Are you there  
  
And in the Winter extra blankets for the cold  
Fix the heater getting old  
I am wiser now you know  
And still as big a fool concerning you  
  
I met your friend  
Shes very nice what can I say  
It was an accident  
I never dreamed wed meet again this way  
Youre looking well  
Im not afraid yeah  
  
You have a lovely home  
Just like a picture  
No I live alone  
I found it easier  
You must remember how I never liked the party life  
Up all night  
Lovely wife  
You have a lovely wife  
  
And in the Winter extra blankets for the cold  
Fix the heater getting old  
You are with her now I know  
Ill live alone forever not together now  
  
And in the Winter extra blankets for the cold  
Fix the heater getting old  
You are with her now I know  
Ill live alone forever not together
