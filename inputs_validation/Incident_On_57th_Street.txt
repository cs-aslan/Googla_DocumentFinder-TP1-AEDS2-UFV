Spanish Johnny drove in from the underworld last night  
With bruised arms and broken rhythm and a beatup old Buick but dressed just
like dynamite  
He tried sellin his heart to the hard girls over on Easy Street  
But they said Johnny it falls apart so easily and you know hearts these
days are cheap  
And the pimps swung their axes and said Johnny youre a cheater  
And the pimps swung their axes and said Johnny youre a liar  
And from out of the shadows came a young girls voice said Johnny dont
cry  
Puerto Rican Jane oh wont you tell me whats your name  
I want to drive you down to the other side of town  
Where paradise aint so crowded and therell be action goin down on Shanty
Lane tonight  
All the goldenheeled fairies in a real bitchfight  
Pull 38s and kiss their girls goodnight  
  
Goodnight its alright Jane  
Now let them black boys in to light the soul flame  
We may find it out on the street tonight baby  
Or we may walk until the daylight maybe  
  
Well like a cool Romeo he made his moves oh she looked so fine  
Like a late Juliet she knew shed never be true but then she really didnt
mind  
Upstairs a band was playin and the singer was singin something about going
home  
She whispered Spanish Johnny you can leave me tonight but just dont leave
me alone  
And Johnny cried Puerto Rican Jane word is down the cops have found the
vein  
Them barefoot boys left their homes for the woods  
Them little barefoot street boys they said their homes aint no good  
They left the corners threw away their switchblade knives and kissed each
other goodbye  
  
Johnny was sittin on the fire escape watchin the kids playin down the
street  
He called down Hey little heroes summers long but I guess it aint very
sweet around here anymore  
Janey sleeps in sheets damp with sweat  
Johnny sits up alone and watches her dream on dream on  
And the sister prays for lost souls then breaks down in the chapel after
everyones gone  
  
Jane moves over to share her pillow but opens her eyes to see Johnny up and
putting his clothes on  
She says Those romantic young boys all they ever want to do is fight  
Those romantic young boys theyre callin through the window  
Hey Spanish Johnny you want to make a little easy money tonight  
  
And Johnny whispered Goodnight its all tight Jane  
Ill meet you tomorrow night on Lovers Lane  
We may find it out on the street tonight now baby  
Or we may walk until the daylight maybe  
Goodnight its alright Jane  
Im gonna meet you tomorrow night on Lovers Lane  
We can find it out on the street tonight now baby  
Or we may walk until the daylight maybe
