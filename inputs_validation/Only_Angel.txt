A mans supposed to be a mountain  
With the rivers runnin to the sea  
But ever since I lost my baby  
Im not sure thats how its supposed to be  
No need to try and hide this empty feelin  
Its hard to smile when Im so sad  
Gods got so many angels up in heaven  
Whyd he take the only angel  
The only angel Ive ever had  
I ever had  
Now I know you dont hear me darlin  
Still I want to take this time to say  
How much I truly loved you  
And how sorry I am sorry I am you went away  
No need to try and hide it  
Yeah Im broken hearted and sad  
cause gods got so many angels up in heaven  
Whyd he take the only angel  
The only angel Ive ever had  
I ever had  
I just cant hide this empty feelin  
When everybody knows that Im sad  
Gods got so many angels up in heaven  
Whyd he take the only angel  
The only angel Ive ever had  
I ever had  
he took the only angel I ever had  
the only angel Ive ever had  
he took the only angel I ever had
