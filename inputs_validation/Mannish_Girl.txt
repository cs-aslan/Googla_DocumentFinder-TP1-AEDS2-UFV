I used to be content to frown  
But anything for money now  
Id rather be a mannish kind of girl  
  
I used to get drunk on spanish wine  
Well now Im drunk most all the time  
I guess Ive been too grateful for too long  
So I sit around and wait  
And watch the grass grow green  
And count the cars  
Feeling lost alone misunderstood  
So I wait hey hey  
Yes I wait hey hey  
  
Well I had a girl in London town  
She picked me up and she spun me round  
I guess she was a mannish kind of girl  
  
I went away and I still dont know why  
Six feet under is where my bloody heart lies  
Im just afraid I cant forget her now  
So I sit around and wait  
And watch the grass grow green  
And count the cars  
Feeling lost alone misunderstood  
So I wait hey hey  
So I wait hey hey  
Hey hey  
  
I used to be too big to crawl  
Now I dont give a damn at all  
Id rather be a mannish kind of girl  
  
Yeah I used to get drunk on that Spanish wine  
But now Im drunk most all the time  
I guess Im just afraid I cant forget her now  
And so Ill sit around and wait  
And watch the grass grow green  
And count the cars  
Feeling lost alone misunderstood  
So I wait hey hey  
Yeah I wait hey hey  
Yes I wait hey hey  
Yeah I wait hey hey  
Hey hey
