Wake up on Sunday morning  
Everything feels so boring  
Is that where it ends  
Live your life through a lens  
  
Hair is the new hat brown is the new black  
She shouldnt wear this he shouldnt wear that  
Pleasure and leisure make mine a double measure with friends  
Fashion tardis down at Quo Vadis  
Who laughs the longest who drives the hardest  
Pleasure and leisure make mine a double measure with friends  
Just because I aint double barreled  
Dont mean I havent traveled well  
Cant you tell  
Oh no its quite appalling  
Your conversation is boring as hell oh well  
Wake up on Sunday morning  
And everything feels so boring  
Is that where it ends  
With your life through a lens  
  
And now your boyfriends suspicious  
So go home and wash the dishes  
And wash them well so he cant tell  
  
Shes looking real drab just out of rehab  
Im talking football shes talking ab fab  
Your clothes are very kitch  
Just because your daddy is rich  
You sound so funny with your voice all plummy  
Now your checks just bounced better run to your mummy  
And you know its a class act shell never ask for it back  
  
Just because I aint double barreled  
Dont mean I havent traveled well  
Cant you tell  
Mix with the local gentry and dont crash Tarquins Bentley  
Ill take the bends with our life through a lens  
Youre scared of the poor and needy  
Is that why youre all inbreedy  
Theyre just like you they need love too  
  
Wake up on Sunday morning  
And everything feels so boring  
Is that where it ends  
With your life through a lens  
  
And now your boyfriends suspicious  
So go home and wash the dishes  
And wash them well so he cant tell
