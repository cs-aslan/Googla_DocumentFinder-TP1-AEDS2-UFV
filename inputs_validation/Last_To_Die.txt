We took the highway till the road went black  
We marked Truth Or Consequences on our map  
A voice drifted up from the radio  
We saw the voice from long ago  
  
Chorus  
Wholl be the last to die for a mistake  
The last to die for a mistake  
Whose blood will spill whose heart will break  
Wholl be the last to die for a mistake  
  
The kids asleep in the backseat  
Were just countin the miles you and me  
We dont measure the blood weve drawn anymore  
We just stack the bodies outside the door  
  
The wise men were all fools  
What to do  
  
The sun sets in flames as the city burns  
Another day gone down as the night turns  
And I hold you here in my heart  
As things fall apart  
  
A downtown window flushed with light  
Faces of the dead at five faces of the dead at five  
A martyrs silent eyes  
Petition the drivers as we pass by  
  
Wholl be the last to die for a mistake  
The last to die for a mistake  
Whose blood will spill whose heart will break  
Wholl be the last to die  
  
Wholl be the last to die for a mistake  
The last to die for a mistake  
Darlin your tyrants and kings form the same fate  
Strung up at your city gates  
And youre the last to die for a mistake
