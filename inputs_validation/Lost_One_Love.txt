Shes lost in the night  
Shes out of my sight  
Gotta find her again  
Shes out of my life  
Gotta find her again  
Will I ever see the daylight  
Will I ever see the sun  
Will I ever know the reason  
Like a shadow shes gone  
Shes lost in the night  
Out of my sight  
Will I find her again  
Taken my life  
Have to find her again  
Will I ever see the daylight  
Will I ever see the dawn  
How can I ever find her  
Shes just a shadow  
Missing person  
I dont know where shes gone  
Lost one love last seen somewhere  
Walkin away from the light  
Lost one love somewhere last seen  
Walkin into the night shes gone  
Will I ever see the daylight  
Will I ever see the sun  
Can I ever know the reason  
Like a shadow missing person  
I dont know where shes gone  
Lost one love last seen somewhere  
Walkin away from the light  
Lost one love somewhere last seen  
Walkin into the night  
Shes lost in the night  
And I dont the reason  
Will I find her again  
Shes out of my sight  
But I cant lose this feeling  
Will I find her again
