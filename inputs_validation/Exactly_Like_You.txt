I know why I waited  
Know why Ive been blue  
Ive been waiting each day  
For someone exactly like you  
  
Why should I spend some money  
On a show or two  
When nobody sings these love songs  
Exactly like you  
  
You make me feel so grand  
I wanna give this world to you  
You make me understand  
These foolish little dreams Im dreaming  
And schemes Im scheming  
  
Now I know why my mama  
She taught me to be true  
She knew just around the corner  
Was somebody like you  
  
You make me feel so grand  
I wanna give this world to you  
Baby you make me understand  
These foolish little dreams Im dreaming  
And schemes Im scheming  
  
Now I know why my mama  
She taught me to be true  
She knew just around the corner  
Yes she knew just around the corner  
Was somebody like you
