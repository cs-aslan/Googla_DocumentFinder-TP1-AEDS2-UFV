Woman you can change my world  
Woman you can change my world  
  
Im chained to the fears  
Inside these walls  
The silence talks loud  
Bout the things I recall  
  
Through the bricks in the window  
I scream at the world  
But when no one is listening  
Its hard to be heard  
  
Woman you can change my world  
Woman therell be no return  
  
I see shadows  
Coming through the walls  
I hear voices  
But no ones talking at all  
  
I can feel the madness  
Crawling up my spine  
Reachin out  
To grab your mind  
  
Woman come and change my world  
  
Do you remember all those fears  
They wont leave me alone  
Do you remember all those tears  
I pretend to be strong  
  
Do you remember all the pain  
Im getting tired of the game  
I cannot live I cannot die  
I want to know who the hell am I  
  
Youve never seen me  
But I know you so well  
And before it kills me  
I gotta break the spell  
  
The deeper we touch  
The higher well go  
The time has come  
To heal my soul  
  
Woman you can change my world  
  
Do you remember all those fears  
They wont leave me alone  
Do you remember all those tears  
I pretend to be strong  
  
Do you remember all the pain  
Im getting tired of the game  
I cannot live I cannot die  
I want to know who the hell am I  
  
Woman Im gonna change your world
