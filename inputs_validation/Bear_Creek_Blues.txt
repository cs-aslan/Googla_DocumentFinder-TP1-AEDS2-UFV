Way up on Bear Creek watching the sun go down  
Well it makes me feel like Im on my last go round  
Well the water up on Bear Creek tastes like cherry wine  
Yeah the water up on Bear Creek tastes like cherry wine  
One drink of that water you stay drunk all the time  
If you stay up on Bear Creek youll get like Jesse James  
If you stay up on Bear Creek youll get like Jesse James  
Youll take two pistols and youll rob that Bear Creek train  
Im going high high up on some lonesome hill  
Im going high high up on some lonesome hill  
Look down on Bear Creek where my good gal used to live  
Way up on Bear Creek watching the sun go down  
Way up on Bear Creek watching the sun go down  
Well it makes me feel like Im on my last go round
