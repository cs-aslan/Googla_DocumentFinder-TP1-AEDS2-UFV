Gently rolling Father time  
Is calling to him now  
And though he hears him  
He looks out to sea  
Somewhere out there lie his dreams  
A story with no ending  
And till he finds his answers  
He wont be going nowhere  
  
For him its not too late  
Its not too late  
For some its never too late  
  
Quietly knocking on her door  
He patiently stands waiting  
And though she hears him  
She sits steadfast in her chair  
Somewhere out there never seen  
Her hopes and dreams lie waiting  
And till she finds an answer  
She wont be going nowhere  
  
For her its not too late  
Its not too late  
For some its never too late  
  
For everything we know thats certain  
There is much we cannot see  
So we choose to close the curtain  
Never knowing what could have been  
  
Its not too late its not too late never too late  
  
Slowly rocking the babys bed  
He strokes its head and whispers  
And though it hears him  
It keeps smiling and kicks its feet  
Somewhere out there is a life  
A lifetime made for living  
So it holds on fast it aint going nowhere  
  
For some its not too late  
Its not too late  
For some its never too late  
For some its not too late  
Its not too late  
For some its never too late
