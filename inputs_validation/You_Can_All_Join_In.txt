Heres a little song you can all join in with  
Its very simple and I hope its new  
Make your own words up if you want to  
Any old words that you think will do yeah  
Yellow blue whatll I do  
Maybe Ill just sit here thinking  
Black white stop the fight  
Does one of these colours ever bother you  
  
Heres a little dance you can all join in with  
Its very simple and I hope its new  
Make your own steps up if you want to  
Any old steps that you think will do  
Left right dont get uptight  
Keep in line and youll be alright  
Clap hands move around  
And make sure no one puts you down  
  
Heres a little world you can all join in with  
Its very simple and I hope its new  
Make your own life up if you want to  
Any old life that you think will do  
Love yeah its nothing new  
Theres someone much worse than you are  
Help me set them free  
Just be what you want to be
