Warren Zevon Zevon Music BMI  
I like to think Ive earned my reputation  
For rushing in where angels fear to tread  
Ill take you home to meet the congregation  
Well all get together in my tent  
I make a dirty little religion out of lovin  
Ill make a dirty little convert out of you  
I make a dirty little religion out of lovin  
Ill make a dirty little convert out of you  
They treat you like a redheaded stepchild  
And try to keep you nailed to the floor  
Join us for the countdown to the Rapture  
We never turned a sinner from our door  
I make a dirty little religion out of lovin  
Ill make a dirty little convert out of you  
I make a dirty little religion out of lovin  
Its a dirty little religion hallelujah  
Dirty little acolyte  
Dirty little one  
Learn the fundamentals of desire  
Can I get a witness  
To my testament  
Can I get an amen from the choir  
I like to think Ive earned my reputation  
For trying to take the bull by the horns  
Ill show you where I get my inspiration  
Where we plow and where we plant the corn  
I make a dirty little religion out of lovin  
Ill make a dirty little convert out of you  
I make a dirty little religion out of lovin  
Its a dirty little religion hallelujah  
Dirty little acolyte  
Dirty little one  
Youll learn the fundamentals of desire  
Can I get a witness  
To my testament  
Can I get an amen from the choir
