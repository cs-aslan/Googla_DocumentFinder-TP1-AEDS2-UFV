Wake me up when its over  
Wake me up when its done  
When hes gone away and taken everything  
Wake me up  
  
Wake me up when the skies are clearing  
When the water is still  
Cause I will not watch the ships sail away so  
Please say you will  
  
If it were any other day  
This wouldnt get the best of me  
  
But today Im not so strong  
So lay me down with a sad song  
And when it stops then you know Ive been  
Gone too long  
  
But dont shake me awake  
Dont bend me or I will break  
Come find me somewhere between my dreams  
With the sun on my face  
  
I will still feel it later on  
But for now Id rather be asleep
