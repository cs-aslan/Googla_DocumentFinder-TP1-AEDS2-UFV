It was a cold and wet December day  
When we touched the ground at JFK  
Snow was melting on the ground  
On BLS I heard the sound  
Of an angel  
  
New York like a Christmas tree  
Tonight this city belongs to me  
Angel  
  
Soul lovethis love wont let me go  
So longangel of Harlem  
  
Birdland on fiftythree  
The street sounds like a symphony  
We got John Coltrane and a love supreme  
Miles and shes got to be an angel  
  
Lady Day got diamond eyes  
She sees the truth behind the lies  
Angel  
  
Soul lovethis love wont let me go  
So longangel of Harlem  
Angel of Harlem  
  
She says its heartheart and soul  
Yeah yeahyeah  
Yeah yeahright now  
  
Blue light on the avenue  
God knows they got to you  
An empty glass the lady sings  
Eyes swollen like a bee sting  
Blinded you lost your way  
Through the side streets and the alleyway  
Like a star exploding in the night  
Falling to the city in broad daylight  
An angel in Devils shoes  
Salvation in the blues  
You never looked like an angel  
Yeah yeahangel of Harlem  
  
Angelangel of Harlem  
Repeat and fade
