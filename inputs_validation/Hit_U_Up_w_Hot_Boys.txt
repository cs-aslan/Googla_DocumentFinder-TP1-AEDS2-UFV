I roll with a bunch of untamed guerrillas head bustas and sharks

How you live you get it is the way a nigga play it  
niggas aint fightin no more  niggas bustin your head  
Sendin you to your grave  its do or die cousin  
Aimin straight for your head makin sure you die cousin  
They dressin in black prepared for combat  
Ridin four deep strapped with choppers and macks  
Not givin a fuck gettin your cut lettin it bust

Look here you can play if you wanna get down  
Get your stupid ass left where you cant be found
