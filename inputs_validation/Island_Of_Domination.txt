Beware of their coming  
Take heed our time is near  
Fatality relinquish not  
Brutality in arms doth seek to destroy  
  
They smashed through the clouds into the light of the moon  
Their steeds were full charging called destruction and doom  
Twas as if all hell had broke loose on this night  
And all in all it was a terrible sight  
  
Now we are taken unto the island of domination  
  
We gotta get we gotta get we gotta get out of this place  
Theres a man with a needle whos pleading to get at my face  
Hide me and hold me control free as best as you can  
Its all becoming too much I cant cope for one man  
  
Now we are taken unto the island of domination  
  
Skyrider you supersonic flyer  
Nightdriver you demon of desire  
Spinesnapper you tried your best to break us  
Throatchoker you thought that you could take us  
  
The fright of your life the fright of your life  
The fright of your life is here guaranteed  
This is no illusion confessing confusion youre freed  
Lashings of strappings with beatings competing to win  
Oh what a mess I am blessed dominations set in  
Now we are taken unto the island of domination
