The threat they say  
Comes from countries ending in  
Where the family name is Khan  
And they all read the Koran  
  
The answer they say  
Is to bomb them all to dust  
Then in fifty years they just  
Might be able to see things our way  
  
Were not barbarians  
Like we were way back when  
Weve learned from history  
So were going round again  
  
I miss the days  
When the threat to our position  
Didnt come from some religion  
But from godless communism  
  
Were not barbarians  
Like we were way back when  
Weve learned from history  
So we get to go round get to go round  
Get to go round get to go round again  
  
Tell your sons  
Not to bother with football  
Get a backpack on and crawl  
Were in this for the long haul  
  
Tell your sons  
Not to bother with football  
Get a backpack on and crawl  
Were in this for the long haul
