I drop my hat  
To a restless wind  
This time Im not gonna chase it again  
In a jigsaw dream with soft spoken words  
  
I woke up crying and no one heard  
Youre looking through me like I never was real  
You say you love me but you wont let me feel  
So Im gonna take a chance this time  
  
Im gonna find myself some place where I can heal  
And Im heading west  
Without a sad goodbye  
And Im heading west  
  
Im like a letter with no address  
Just like a book I read  
Im heading west  
I said my name  
  
Under my breath  
He turned down a twisted road  
I wont forget  
Im gonna fly my kite and let out all the string  
  
Hold on to hope let go everything  
I cant stop laughing and its nothing you said  
The altitude of freedom seems to go to my head  
And if I fall down on my knees Im gonna get back up  
  
Im gonna get back up again  
And Im heading west  
Without a sad goodbye  
And Im heading west  
  
Im like a letter with no address  
Just like a book I read  
Im heading west  
And Im heading west  
Just like a book I read
