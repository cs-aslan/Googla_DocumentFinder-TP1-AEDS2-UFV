Here she comes  
Seven suns  
A burning flame  
She got my love  
Got my head  
But its all the same  
She climbed so high  
I dont know why  
High  
On her own  
  
And I know  
Shes in the air  
And I dont want it to go  
I can feel her love  
But I dont want it to go  
  
She got my woe  
Got my hand  
Took the dreams  
Right outta my head  
She bought the world  
I paid the bills  
I took those pills  
It was wind in her sails  
She climbed so high  
I dont know why  
High  
On her own  
  
And I know  
Shes in the air  
And I dont want it to go  
I can feel her love  
But I dont want it to go
