with Carole Bayer Sager  
  
You and me  
Weve traded hearts  
I guess thats how  
It always starts out  
And then I guess it always ends  
  
Look at us  
Now  
Sayin  
I dont think that you and me  
Can just be friends  
Maybe this is how the whole thing  
Has to just end  
  
And if we could  
Have loved enough  
La la dee la la dee dah dah la la dah la la dah la la dah la  
We would have handled  
When it got rough  
But one of us let go too soon  
  
So here we are  
Here we are  
Now sayin  
I dont think that you and me  
Can just be friends  
Maybe this is how the whole thing  
Has to just end  
  
I wish youd understand  
  
Its funny how  
When love has gone  
Theres only one left holdin on  
When someones always hurtin more  
Still lonely for the other  
  
Sayin  
I dont think that you and me  
Can just be friends  
Hmm  
I dont ever wanna feel so much again  
Feel again  
Unless its you  
You Again  
  
La la dee la la dee dah dah la la dah la la dah la la dah la  
I guess thats how it always starts out  
And then I guess  
It always ends  
  
Look at us  
Look at us  
Now  
Now sayin  
I dont think that you and me  
Can just be friends  
Hmm  
Maybe this is how the whole thing  
Has to just end  
  
La la dee la la dee dah dah la la dah la la dah la la dah la
