Newborn  
For the first time  
Im not born again  
I have never lived at all  
Ive opened up my eyes  
Now I hear the world talking  
Opened up my eyes  
Ive just started walking  
  
Ive got someone who cares for me  
Someone who believes in me  
Ive got someone understanding me  
Someone crying over me  
For all the right reasons  
  
Ive got someone seeing grace in me  
Someone respecting me  
Ive got someone whos there for me  
Someone saying prayers for me  
For all the right reasons
