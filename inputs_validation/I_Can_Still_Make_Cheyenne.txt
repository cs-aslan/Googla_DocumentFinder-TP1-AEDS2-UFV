Her telephone rang bout a quarter to nine  
She heard his voice on the other end of the line  
She wondered what was wrong this time  
She never knew what his calls might bring  
With a cowboy like him it could be anything  
And she always expected the worst  
In the back of her mind  
  
He said its cold out here and Im all alone  
I didnt make the short go again and Im coming home  
I know Ive been away too long  
I never got a chance to write or call  
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all  
But Ill be home soon  
And honey is there somethin wrong  
  
She said dont bother comin home  
By time you get here Ill be long gone  
Theres somebody new and he sure aint no rodeo man  
He said Im sorry its come down to this  
Theres so much about you that Im gonna miss  
But its alright baby  
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne  
Gotta go now baby  
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne  
  
He left that phone danglin off the hook  
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look  
Then he just walked away  
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line  
With a little luck he could still get there in time  
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say  
  
She said dont bother comin home  
By time you get here Ill be long gone  
Theres somebody new and he sure aint no rodeo man  
He said Im sorry its come down to this  
Theres so much about you that Im gonna miss  
But its alright baby  
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne  
Gotta go now baby  
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne  
  
She never knew what his calls might bring  
With a cowboy like him it could be anything  
And she always expected the worst  
In the back of her mind
