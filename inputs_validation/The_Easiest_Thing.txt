Suddenly theres meaning  
To all my hopin and dreamin  
And a joy I have never felt before  
Umm suddenly theres a reason  
Something I can believe in  
And finally I know what my heart is for  
This is the easiest thing to do  
Yes the easiest thing to do  
Its as simple and as natural  
As breathing out and breathing in  
Yes the easiest thing is lovin you  
Suddenly Im weightless  
Feel I could fly or could walk on  
With my feet never touching the ground  
Umm and I know Im not crazy  
And now I know Im not sleeping  
No the searching is over and baby Ive found  
That this is the easiest thing to do  
Its the easiest thing to do  
Its as simple and as natural  
As breathing out and breathing in  
Yes the easiest thing is lovin you  
Suddenly the sadness is gone  
And I dont have to tell myself  
To struggle through  
To carry on  
This is the easiest thing to do  
Its the easiest thing to do  
Its as simple and as natural  
As breathing out and breathing in  
Yes the easiest thing is lovin you  
Yes the easiest thing is lovin you  
Yes the easiest thing is lovin you
