I guess theres nothing to do  
And nothing to say  
But simply go on my way  
And call it a day  
  
I guess Im ready to go  
Right back on the shelf  
Because at last Ive learned  
Where youre concerned  
Ive just been fooling myself  
  
I never had a chance  
I thought you cared for me  
But now I see I never had a chance  
I never had a chance  
Though you never told me so  
Somehow I know I never had a chance  
  
I knew wed have to part  
For I could always reach your lips  
But I could never reach your heart  
My dream about romance  
Ended in a friendly chat  
But more than that  
I never had a chance  
  
I never had a chance  
I thought you cared for me  
But now I see I never had a chance  
I never had a chance  
Though you never told me so  
Somehow I know I never had a chance  
  
I knew wed have to part  
For I could always reach your lips  
But I could never reach your heart  
My dream about romance  
Ended in a friendly chat  
But more than that  
I never had a chance
