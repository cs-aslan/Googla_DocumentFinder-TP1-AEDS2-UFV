Day by day my life gets colder  
My ice grows thin as I get older  
Peace in peaces bloody and bruised  
I feel so helpless and confused  
  
Cause I hear screamin on the left  
Yellin on the right  
Im sitting in the middle tryin to live my life  
  
Chorus  
Cause I cant stop the war  
Shelter homeless feed the poor  
I cant walk on water  
I cant save your sons and daughters  
I cant change the world and make things fair  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do is care  
  
I pray and pray for lifes salvation  
Faith is tried and true in tribulation  
Love is lost and lonely check the news  
And with these open arms Ill wait for you  
  
Cause I hear screamin on the left  
And yelling on the right  
Im sitting in the middle trying to live my life  
  
Chorus  
  
For the life of me I cant see how the devil keeps enticing me  
All you sees a felon I know god can see whats right in me  
How I can be labeled as a villain in the first place  
When the worst case scenario is my birth place  
Im just tryin to keep from fallin victim to the murder rate  
Take my life lesson convincing the adolescents  
Theres a god up in heaven sending down blessings  
And your future aint brighter than your present  
Quit stressin  
  
Theyre screamin on the left  
Yellin on the right  
While Im sittin in the middle trying to live my life  
  
Cause I cant stop the war  
Shelter homeless feed the poor  
Cant walk on water I cant save your sons and daughters  
I cant change the world to make things fair  
The least that I can do is care  
  
Yeah I cant stop the war  
Shelter homeless feed the poor  
I cant walk on water  
I cant save your sons and daughters  
I cant change the world and make things fair  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do  
Oh is care
