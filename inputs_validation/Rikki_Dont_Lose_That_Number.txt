We hear youre leaving thats OK  
I thought our little wild time had just begun  
I guess you kind of scared yourself you turn and run  
But if you have a change of heart  
  
Chorus  
Rikki dont lose that number  
You dont want to call nobody else  
Send it off in a letter to yourself  
Rikki dont lose that number  
Its the only one you own  
You might use it if you feel better  
When you get home  
  
I have a friend in town hes heard your name  
We can go out driving on Slow Hand Row  
We could stay inside and play games I dont know  
And you could have a change of heart  
  
Chorus  
  
You tell yourself youre not my kind  
But you dont even know your mind  
And you could have a change of heart  
  
Chorus
