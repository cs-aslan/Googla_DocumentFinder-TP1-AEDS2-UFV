Wesley Sox Wilson  
If I call three times a day  
Come and drive my blues away  
When you come be ready to play  
Do your duty  
  
If you want to have some love  
Give your baby your last buck  
Dont come quackin like a duck  
Do your duty  
  
I heard you say you didnt love me  
Numb as Mrs Brown  
I dont believe a word they say  
Shes the lyinest woman in town  
  
When I need attention at home  
Ill call you on the phone  
Come yourself dont send your friend Jones  
Do your duty  
  
If my radiator get too hot  
Cool it off in lots of spots  
Give me all the service youve got  
Do your duty  
  
If you dont know what its all about  
Dont sit around my house and pout  
If you do youll catch your mama tippin now  
Do your duty  
  
If you make your own bed hard  
Thats the way o life  
Im tired of sleepin by myself  
But you too dumb to realize  
  
Im not tryin to make you feel blue  
Im not satisfied with the way you do  
Ive got to help you find somebody too  
Do your duty
