Even if its easy to be free  
Whats your definition of freedom  
And who the fuck are you anyway  
Who the fuck are they  
Who the fuck am I to say  
What the fuck is really going on  
How did the cat get so fat  
Why does the family die  
Do you care why  
cause there hasnt been a sign  
Of anything gettin better in the ghetto  
Peoples fed up  
But when they get up  
You point your fuckin finger  
You racist you bigot  
But thats not the problem  
Now is it  
Its all about the money  
Political power is takin  
Protecting the rich denying the poor  
Yeah they love to watch the war from the White House  
And I wonder how can they sleep at night  
How can they sleep at night  
How did the cat get so fat  
How did the cat get so fat  
How did the cat get so fat  
How did the cat get so fat
