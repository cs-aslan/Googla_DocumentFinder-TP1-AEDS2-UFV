Theres a bar hall queen down in Charlotte town  
Id sure like to see her when the sun goes down  
I swear her hair is midnight black  
And I cant wait till I get back  
  
Carolina queen  
Shes a walking love machine  
Id like to make her scream  
When I bite the bullet  
Bite the bullet  
  
Born and raised at the top of the South  
You know she knows what its all about  
Good old boys are coming from miles around  
Want to watch that bullet lay em down  
  
Carolina queen  
Shes a walking love machine  
Id like to make her scream  
When I bite the bullet  
Bite the bullet
