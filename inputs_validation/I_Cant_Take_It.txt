Well I saw you today and realized  
How I missed my peace of mind  
I feel your breath in my ear  
But late at night its you I always think about  
That little girl inside of you I once knew  
I should have known better  
Still the smell of you was on my face  
But you were too busy  
To notice me last night  
  
Chorus  
Now I cant take it alone  
I cant make it alone  
I cant take it  
I cant make it alone  
Oh no ooh oh no  
  
Then I tell myself Ill put you down  
Dont want to see your face around  
Dont call me up anymore  
When I hear your voice its in my ear  
Youre kissing on the phone  
It makes it all come clear  
  
Chorus  
  
I try to tell myself  
Dont need you anymore  
Dont want you hanging around my door oh no  
  
Now I cant take it alone  
I cant make it alone  
I cant take it alone  
I cant make it alone  
I cant take it alone  
I cant make it alone  
If its wrong or right  
I cant take it I cant make it alone  
  
You know how I tried  
I cant take it I cant make it alone  
I try tell myself dont need you anymore  
I cant take it alone I cant make it alone  
Oh baby my pretty baby  
I cant take it alone I cant make it alone
