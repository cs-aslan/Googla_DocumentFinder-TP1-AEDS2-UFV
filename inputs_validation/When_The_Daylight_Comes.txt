OoOoOo OoOoOo Ooooo  
OoOoOo OoOoOo Ooooo  
  
Sweet woman whats your name  
You smell as fresh as the rain  
Instead of leaving you came  
Let me feel your hair  
  
A light shines in your eyes  
The hungry years are so nice  
Shadows shake in the lamplight  
No writer could explain  
  
But when the daylight comes  
But when the daylight comes  
But when the daylight comes  
Ill be on my way  
  
OoOoOo OoOoOo Ooooo  
OoOoOo OoOoOo Ooooo  
OoOoOo OoOoOo Ooooo yeah  
  
Please share my bed and I swear  
That I wont touch you nowhere  
Just need your warmth and your care  
Dont want to mess around  
  
And when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Oh when the daylight comes  
Ill be on my way  
  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Ill be on my way  
  
But theres a song in the air  
And it knows that youre there  
Cause its making me share  
You with my life  
I know I know I know that  
I want to weave you in words  
Want to paint you in verse  
Want to leave you in someone elses dreams  
It seems the only way Hey  
I can thank you thank you baby  
  
Some people say that were sinners  
Some people say that were winners  
We make good gossip at dinners  
They try to pin us down  
  
But when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Oh when the daylight comes  
Ill be on my way  
  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Oh when the daylight comes  
Well be on my way  
Repeat
