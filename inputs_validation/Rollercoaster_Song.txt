Rollercoaster roll rollercoaster  
Isabella Phineas are you sure this is safe  
Phineas Of course  
Rollercoaster roll rollercoaster  
Phineas Its like a leisurely drive around downtown  
Aaaahhhhhhh  
But it starts with a 3 mile drop straight down  
Aaaahhhhhhh  
And now keep your head and hands and feet inside the ride  
Aaaahhhhhhh  
Not a written rule but its strongly implied  
Aaaahhhhhhh  
Permaneced sentados por favor  
Scream if you want more  
Thats right  
Cork screwin round the interstate  
With peanut butter and rubber snakes  
Clear the way move over  
Look out Bud  
Here comes the mud  
Rollercoaster roll rollercoaster  
Look out  
Right side up and upside down  
Dont ask me to talk  
Cant tell a verb from a noun  
And Im screaming like a baby  
Whos afraid of a clown  
Buford Im glad Im wearing trousers  
That are already brown  
Phineas Itll twist your belly  
Itll turn your gut  
Man is this ride sweet or what  
We go  
Phineas and passengers Ah ah ah  
Ferb We go  
Phineas and passengers Ah ah ah  
Ferb We go  
Phineas and passengers Ah ah ah  
Yeah rollercoaster  
Buford I got the poster
