Can I play with madness  
  
Give me the sense to wonder  
To wonder if Im free  
Give me a sense of wonder  
To know I can be me  
Give me the strength to hold my head up  
Spit back in their face  
Dont need no key to unlock this door  
Gonna break down the walls  
Break out of this bad place  
  
Chorus  
Can I play with madness  
The prophet stared at his crystal ball  
Can I play with madness  
Theres no vision there at all  
Can I play with madness  
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me ha ha He said  
Can I play with madness  
He said youre blind too blind to see  
  
Said youre too blind to see  
  
I screamed aloud to the old man  
I said dont lie dont say you dont know  
I say youll pay for this mischief  
In this world or the next  
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance  
And the hell fires raged in his eyes  
He said you wanna know the truth son  
Lord Ill tell you the truth  
Your souls gonna burn in a lake of fire  
  
Chorus  
  
Listen to me said the prophet  
  
Chorus  
  
Can I play with madness
