Yo yo this Wyclef alongside DJ Skribble for the ladies  
Yo Skribble I have one question  
Could you please answer this for me  
I gotta know this yo  
  
What makes a DJ  
What makes an MC  
What makes the ReFugees  
Why are kids getting jealous  
  
Cause we F are E S H  
Fresh fresh fresh thats fresh  
F are E S H  
Fresh fresh fresh thats fresh  
  
Hey you player with the dibble and the dabble  
You want to battle who Wyclef or DJ Skribble  
Hold the stickup its a freestyle session  
Skribble where you from man  
Well Im from Haiti then Brooklyn then Jersey  
With a universal tag plus I got  
You slept on this musician plus the hiphop art  
Bring your best MCs  
Cause every man got disciples if you ever want a rival  
Show up with a mic and a rifle  
Wyclef stuck the bank at midday  
And took all of Sony money in a black van he got away  
I just got a call from Tommy Mottola  
He said forget about it oh my word  
So I held John Agrassia at gunpoint  
Hes shook callin Donny Aiena while smokin a joint  
I said Whos the informer They say Michael Malden  
I had to take him out Three the hard way  
The moral of this story dont blame the record company  
If your record aint selling you lack creativity  
  
But what you want me to say What what you want me to say huh  
Yo Ive been trying to get a deal for years and it aint  
What you want me to say  
  
And Ill kill anyone who dares to go against me
