Daddy was a coalminer  
He worked the pits all day  
In Rock Springs Wyoming  
It was meant to be a stop for a day  
Became his home nothing more I can say  
  
Daddy was a part time farmer  
He worked the field all day  
But hed rather have new shoes for them horses  
But late one day them horses run away  
Shouldnt have put the shoes on that way  
  
Too bad for daddy  
Such a shame he took it all  
So me and mom took the high road  
But its not like we had a choice at all  
  
Daddy was a guitar player  
Hed play that joint all night  
Out back in the shack  
The sixstring was his demon  
Maybe one day I could run away  
Join my dad in a band to play  
  
Now its just me and mom here  
We sit alone all night  
But if you listen close  
You can hear my daddy playing  
It was meant to be a stop for a day  
Left us here now hes on his way  
  
Too bad for daddy  
Such a shame he took it all  
So me and mom we took the high road  
But its not like we had a choice at all  
  
Just to bad for daddy  
Its such a shame he took it all  
So me and mom took the high road  
But its not like we had a choice at all
