Tear drops fell on mamas note  
When I read the things she wrote  
She said we miss you girl  
We love you come on home  
Well I didnt have to pack  
I had it all right on my back  
Now Im five hundred miles away from home  
  
Away from home away from home  
Cold and tired and all alone  
Yes Im five hundred miles away from home  
  
Its hard to tell the state Im in  
Where Im going where Ive been  
But theres a dream Ive been following so long  
If mama knew the things Ive done  
Shed forgive them everyone  
But Im still five hundred miles away from home  
  
Away from home away from home  
Cold and tired and all alone  
Yes Im five hundred miles away from home  
  
Cant remember when I ate its just thumb and walk and wait  
And Im still five hundred miles away from home  
If my luck had been just right Id be with them all tonight  
But Im still five hundred miles away from home  
  
Away from home away from home  
Cold and tired and all alone  
Yes Im five hundred miles away from home  
  
Lord Im still five hundred miles away from home
