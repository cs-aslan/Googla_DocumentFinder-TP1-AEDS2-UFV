When I was young my father said  
Son I have something to say  
And what he told me Ill never forget  
Until my dying days  
  
Chorus  
He said son you are a bachelor boy  
And thats the way to stay  
Son youll be a bachelor boy  
Until your dying days  
  
When I was 16 I fell in love  
With a girl as sweet as can be  
But I remembered just in time  
What my daddy said to me  
  
Chorus  
  
As time goes by I probably will  
Meet a girl and fall in love  
Then Ill get married have a wife and a child  
And theyll be my turtle doves  
  
But until then Ill be a bachelor boy  
And thats the way Ill stay  
Happy to be a bachelor boy  
Until my dying days
