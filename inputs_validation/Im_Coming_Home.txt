Everytime I wake up  
Somewhere far away  
Drowning over minutes that were yesterday  
I wonder what youre doing  
Do you feel this way  
Are you thinking of me too  
Looking in the mirror all I wanna see  
Is your pretty face smiling back at me  
Theres nowhere in the world that  
I would rather be  
Than to be back home with you  
Im on my way  
I promise you that I wont be long  
I just called  
Called you to say  
I miss every little little moment  
Without you  
And I cant wait  
For us to be alone  
Im almost in your arms  
Im coming home  
And back when Im alone  
I really miss your touch  
I hold on to your picture  
And it means so much  
To know that there is someone  
Out there just for me  
And  
You feel the same way too  
Everywhere I go Id wish  
That You were there  
Everything I know Id wish  
That we could share  
Everywhere I go  
Makes me miss you so  
Im on my way  
I promise you that I wont be long  
I just called called you to say  
I Miss every little moment without you  
And I cant wait  
For us to be alone  
Im Almost in your arms Im Coming home  
I can touch you  
Everytime I close my eyes  
Baby you can feel it  
If you just believe Im Coming  
Oooh Im coming home  
And I cant wait  
For us to be alone  
Im almost in your arms  
Im coming home  
Im coming home mmmm  
Uh Im coming home
