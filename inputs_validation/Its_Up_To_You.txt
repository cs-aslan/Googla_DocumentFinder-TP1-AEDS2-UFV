This song was first released on the Back Home Again album It is the only
album it has been released on  
You can do whatever you want to do  
Wherever you want to go its up to you  
And wouldnt it be fine  
Following your heart playing your own part  
You and me out on a farm let the sun be our alarm  
Kickin off your shoes doin what we choose  
And wouldnt it be fine  
Knowing that your mine anytime you want to be  
But I dont want to own you  
I just want to hold you  
I dont want to need you  
I just like to see you smile and stay for awhile  
And if the times get rough being free might be enough  
To see us through the storm and keep our feelings warm  
And wouldnt it be fine  
Looking back and knowing that we helped each other find  
You can do whatever you want to do  
Wherever you want to go its up to you  
And wouldnt it be fine  
Following your heart knowing from the start  
Its up to you  
Its up to you  
Its up to you
