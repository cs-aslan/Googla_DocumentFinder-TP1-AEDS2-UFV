I found an empty house in my neighborhood  
I knew that wer shouldnt but I thought we could  
Knew it wouldnt be hard to slide into the backyard  
Called all my friends and slipped a hundred to the guard  
We turned on the radio and had a party on the patio  
  
Bettys in the sauna and shes getting kind of hot  
Marys in the icebox wishin she was not  
Connies in the whirlpool Jimmys tryin to be cool  
Libbys in the bushes cause shes nobodys fool  
We turned the lights down low and had a party on the patio  
  
Heard the cops are coming so we tried to jump the fence  
Mary didnt make it and we havent seen her since  
Connie had another drink Jimmy simply couldnt think  
Billy G was passed out underneath the sink  
But everybodys gonna show for another party on the patio
