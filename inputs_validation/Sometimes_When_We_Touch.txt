You ask me if I love you and I choke on my reply  
Id rather hurt you honestly than mislead you with a lie  
And who am I to judge you on what you say or do  
Im only just beginning to see the real you  
And sometimes when we touch  
The honestys too much and I have to close my eyes and hide  
I wanna hold you till I die  
Till we both break down and cry  
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides  
  
Romance and all its strategy leaves me battling with my pride  
But through the insecurity some tenderness survives  
Im just another writer still trapped within my truths  
A hesitant prize fighter still trapped within my youth  
  
And sometimes when we touch  
The honestys too much and I have to close my eyes and  
  
hide  
I wanna hold you till I die  
Till we both break down and cry  
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides  
  
At times Id like to break you and drag you to your knees  
At times Id like to break through and hold you endlessly  
At times I understand you and I know how hard youve tried  
Ive watch while love commands you  
And Ive watched love pass you by  
At times I think were drifters still searching for a friend  
A brother or a sister but then the passion flares again  
  
And sometimes when we touch  
The honestys too much and I have to close my eyes and hide  
I wanna hold you till I die  
Till we both break down and cry  
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides
