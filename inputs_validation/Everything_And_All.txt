All like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like that  
  
This world is not my home  
But its a pretty good location  
I dont like the shortput  
Thats enough conversation  
  
So while I got the chance  
I think Ill take the time to dance  
And dance and dance  
  
Im gonna reach for the sky  
Live while Im alive  
  
Like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like that  
  
Im gonna let somebody else  
Take care of all the worry  
Changin my direction  
And I wont be in a hurry  
  
Im gonna slow it down  
While the world goes spinnin round  
And round and round  
  
Im gonna enjoy the ride  
Live while Im alive  
  
Like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like that  
  
I cant build a mountain  
No I cant fill up an ocean  
No I aint that smart  
I aint that smart  
  
I dont know how He did it  
But Im givin God the credit  
God how great Thou art  
How great Thou art  
  
How great Thou art  
  
Im gonna bait the hook  
And let the worm do all the fishin  
Kick back on the bank  
And be a man without a mission  
  
Im gonna slow it down  
While the world goes spinnin round  
And round and round  
  
Im gonna enjoy the ride  
Live while Im alive  
  
Like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like this  
  
This world is not my home  
But its a pretty good location  
I dont like the shortput  
Thats enough conversation  
  
So while I got the chance  
I think Ill take the time to dance  
And dance and dance  
  
Im gonna reach for the sky  
Live while Im alive  
  
Like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like that  
All like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like that  
  
All like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like that  
  
Yeah just like that  
  
All like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like that
