All I wish that I wasnt here  
Dont you know Ive got a rotten feeling  
Of dizzy heights  
Its what they want you know  
Oh well here I go  
  
What a funny show  
  
Take my time its the odds that count  
Who am I What a silly sound  
Hold my breath talk of sudden death  
Rhyme and reason must prevail  
I need a glass of ale  
  
Ive gotta feeling now  
No need for me to tell you how  
Its really kind of easy now  
Woa like rock n roll  
  
Its gonna be alright  
Its funky and its outta sight  
Feeling good feeling right  
Its gonna be alright
