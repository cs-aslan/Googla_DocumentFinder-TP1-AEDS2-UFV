So you think youre a Romeo  
playing a part in a pictureshow  
Take the long way home  
Take the long way home  
  
Cause youre the joke of the neighborhood  
Why should you care if youre feeling good  
Take the long way home  
Take the long way home  
  
But there are times that you feel youre part of the scenery  
All the greenery is comin down boy  
And then your wife seems to think youre part of the  
furniture oh its peculiar she used to be so nice  
  
When lonely days turn to lonely nights  
You take a trip to the city lights  
And take the long way home  
Take the long way home  
  
You never see what you want to see  
Forever playing to the gallery  
You take the long way home  
Take the long way home  
  
And when youre up on the stage its so unbelievable  
Oh unforgettable how they adore you  
But then your wife seems to think youre losing your sanity  
Oh calamity is there no way out  
  
Does it feel that your lifes become a catastrophe  
Oh it has to be for you to grow  boy  
When you look through the years and see what you could  
have been oh what you might have been  
If youd had more time  
  
So when the day comes to settle down  
Whos to blame if youre not around  
You took the long way home  
You took the long way home
