Love love love  
Makes you blind blind  
Lies lies lies  
Tear you down  
  
Plenty of time when youre dead  
To be the perfect girl  
Theres plenty of room in your bed  
To make a perfect world  
  
Out of a fucked up head  
Comes a perfect girl  
Out of a fucked up head  
One perfect world  
  
I want to fall a million floors  
Im gonna breathe through open pores  
Im gonna scream out open doors  
God bless the models  
  
Time time time  
Makes you learn learn  
That love love love  
You will have to earn  
  
Out of a fucked up head  
Comes a perfect word  
Out of a fucked up head  
Comes a perfect world  
  
I want to fall a million floors  
Im gonna scream through open doors  
Youll make the headlines when you die  
God bless the models  
  
Out of a fucked up head  
Comes a world of lust and greed  
Out of a fucked up head  
Comes a life of luxury  
  
Im gonna be there when you die  
Dont cry  
Cause God bless  
The slave slave slave to fashion
