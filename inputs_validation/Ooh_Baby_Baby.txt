Our love is gone and youre left alone  
What can you do when loves lost sight of you  
  
Ooh la la la la ooh la la la la  
I did you wrong my heart went out to play  
And in the game I lost you what a price to pay  
Im crying ooh baby baby ooh baby baby  
  
Sorry let me come home and love you  
Though its hard though its hard to do  
What can I do  
  
Mistakes I know Ive made a few  
But Im only human youve made mistakes too  
Im crying ooh baby baby ooh baby baby  
  
Ooh baby baby baby baby I love you  
Ooh baby baby baby baby I need you  
Ooh baby baby baby tell me what do I do  
Ooh baby baby baby let me make it up to you  
  
Baby baby the heart keeps getting stronger  
Baby baby I cant hold on much longer  
Baby baby the heart keeps getting stronger  
Stronger I cant hold on much longer  
  
Ooh stronger my heart keeps getting stronger  
Ooh stronger I cant hold on much longer  
Ooh stronger the heart keeps getting stronger  
Ooh stronger I cant hold on much longer  
  
Im just about at the end of my rope  
But I cant stop trying I cant give up hope  
Cause I feel Ill be here someday Ill hold you near  
Whisper I still love you until that day is here until that day is  
  
Ooh baby baby ooh baby baby  
Ooh baby baby ooh baby baby  
Ooh baby baby ooh baby baby ooh
