LA Lakers fast break makers  
Kinds of the court shake and bake all takers  
Back to back is a bad ass fact a claim that remains in tact  
Magisee see you on the court  
Buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart  
Magisee magic of the buck  
Other teams pray for dreams  
But he dont give a fuck  
Penetrating the lane like a bullet train  
Comes the magic blood a telepathic brain  
Knucklehead suckers better duck  
When the buck comes through like a truck  
Scott stops pops and drops it in  
On his way back gets a little skin  
From the hand of a man named a c green  
Slam so hard break your tv screen  
Worthys hot with his tomahawk  
Take it to the hole make your mamma talk  
I hate to burst your bubble but triple double trouble  
Is coming to your town and hes going to make rubble  
LA Lakers fast break makers  
Kings of the court shake and bake all takers  
Back to back is a bad ass fact a claim that remains in tact  
Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly  
Cause they got more moves  
That a bowl full of jelly  
The buck stops here  pops  then cheers  
A roar through the forum  
That deafens my ears  
The one and only know if his kind  
Sits in a throne  
Not for the records that he holds  
But for being bald and bold  
Kareem Abdul Jabbar  
All time great super super star  
I hate to burst your bubble but triple double trouble  
Is coming to your town and hes going to make rubble  
Does anybody want some Magic Johnson  
LA Lakers fast break makers  
Kings of the court shake and bake all takers  
Back to back is a bad ass fact a claim that remains in tact
