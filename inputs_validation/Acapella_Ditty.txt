Well a hello and a howdy  
Were so very glad to see you  
And were getting kinda rowdy  
And weve got a lot to say  
And were going to try and do our very best to entertain you  
And we hope youll be delighted by the time you go away  
And we are called by name Oingo Boingo  
And were here just to entertain you  
Make you laugh and maybe offened you  
But we hope that you will be happier than when you came because  
It is more fun Just relax prepare to come undone  
Madness in large portions to serve you  
Second helpings come wih mashed potatoes  
Wylee weelie wylee wailee  We are called the Oingo Boingo  
Not Gazingo or Gazongo or by any other name  
And well punch you in the gizzard if you dare to call us Bingo  
Cause were called the Oingo Boingo  
And its simply not the same  
No its simply not the same
