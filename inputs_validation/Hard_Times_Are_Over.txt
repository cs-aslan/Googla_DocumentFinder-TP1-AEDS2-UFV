Its been very hard  
But its getting easier now  
Hard times are over over for a while  
  
The leaves are shining in the sun  
And smiling inside  
You and I watching each other on a street corner  
Cars and buses and planes and people go by  
  
But we dont care  
We want to know  
We want to know in each others eyes  
That hard times are over over for sometime  
  
Hard times are over  
Hard times are over  
Hard times are over over for a while  
  
Its been very rough  
But its getting easier now  
Hard times are over over for a while  
  
The streams are twinkling in the sun  
And Im smiling inside  
You and I walking together round the street corner  
  
Hard times are over  
Hard times are over  
Hard times are over over for a while
