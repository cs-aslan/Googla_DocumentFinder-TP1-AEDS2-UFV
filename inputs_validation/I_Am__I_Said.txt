LAs fine the sun shines most the time  
And the feeling is lay back  
Palm trees grow and rents are low  
But you know I keep thinkin about  
Making my way back  
Well Im New York City born and raised  
But nowadays  
Im lost between two shores  
LAs fine but it aint home  
New Yorks home  
But it aint mine no more  
  
I amI said  
To no one there  
And no one heard at all  
Not even the chair  
I amI cried I amsaid I  
And I am lost and I cant  
Even say why  
Leavin me lonely still  
  
Did you ever read about a frog  
Who dreamed of bein a king  
And then became one  
Well except for the names  
And a few other changes  
If you talk about me  
The storys the same one  
But I got an emptiness deep inside  
And Ive tried  
But it wont let me go  
And Im not a man who likes to swear  
But I never cared  
For the sound of being alone  
  
I amI said  
To no one there  
And no one heard at all  
Not even the chair  
I amI cried  
I amsaid I  
And I am lost and I cant  
Even say why  
I amI said  
I amI cried  
I amI said
