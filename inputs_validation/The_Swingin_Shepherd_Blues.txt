Along the mountain pass  
There is a patch of grass  
Where the swingin shepherd plays a tune  
His sheep never stray  
Dancin all day  
Until they see the palin yellow moon  
And then he leads his flock  
And homeward they all rock  
To the tune of the swingin shepherd blues  
  
Chorus  
This iis something really extra special  
A ditty we like to do just for you  
Its the onliest swinginest grooviest thingy that weve ever done  
And if you like it then before we are thru  
Then you ought to move along groove and join this song and I dont have to
repeat  
Its swing  
Ah yes  
Now its complete Wooh
