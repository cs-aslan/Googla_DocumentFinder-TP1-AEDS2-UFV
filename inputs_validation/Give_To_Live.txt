Oooh  I can see that youve got  
Fire in your eyes and pain inside your heart  
So many things have come and torn your world apart  
  
Oh baby baby baby dont give up  
Dont give up  
Dont give up  
If you want love  
If you want love youve got to give a little  
If you want love if you want faith  
You just believe a little  
If you want love if you want peace  
Turn your cheek a little ohhh  
Youve got to give  
Youve got to give  
Youve got to give to live  
  
An empty hand reaching out for someone  
An empty heart takes so little to fill its so much  
Easier to push instead of pull  
  
Oh baby baby baby dont give up  
Dont give up  
Dont give up  
If you want love  
If you want love youve got to give a little  
If you want love if you want faith  
You just believe a little  
If you want love if you want peace  
Turn your cheek a little ohhh  
Youve got to give  
Youve got to give  
Youve got to give to live  
  
Each mans a country in his own right oh  
Every body needs a friend one friend  
One god one country  
No man need defend  
I believe in fate and destination  
But so much of that lies in our own hands  
If you know what you want  
Just go on out and get it  
  
Oh baby baby baby dont give up  
Dont give up  
Dont give up  
If you want love  
If you want love youve got to give a little  
If you want love if you want faith  
You just believe a little  
If you want love if you want peace  
Turn your cheek a little  
If you want love youve got to give  
If you want love give to live  
Youve got to give to live  
Give to live  
Give to live  
If you wan
