Ma and pa now here you all go again  
Givin a party tryin to impress your friends  
We been tryin to figure what you spent  
This party must have cost a pretty cent  
Howlin rack em back let em stack runnin around again  
Rack em back let em stack runnin around again  
Sssh dont wake up the kids please  
Look at them doin that ol time jitterbug  
Tearin up a brandnew livingroom rug  
And when they find that hole burned in the chair  
Youd swear with all your might we put it there  
Howlin Rack em back let em stack runnin around again  
Rack em back let em stack runnin around again  
Sssh dont wake up them kids you all  
Thinkin there was a recession goin on  
What you gonna do when all your loot is gone  
You call all four of us a bunch of cranks  
When we dont let you rob our piggy banks  
Howlin rack em back let em stack runnin around again  
Rack em back let em stack runnin around again  
Dont wake up them kids you all please  
  
Wah all the kids are peekin through the crack  
The baby found a cushion in the back  
From the way he looked we got a hunch  
He must have got a hold of some of your punch  
Howlin rack em back let em stack runnin around again  
Rack em back let em stack runnin around again  
Sssh dont wake up the kids dont wake up the kids  
Help your parents and all you grab a broom  
While we do that dirty living room  
And dont you make no noise while you sweep  
You know your fathers ill hes tryin to sleep  
Howlin rack em back let em stack runnin around again  
Rack em back let em stack runnin around again  
Hey you all dont wake up them kids in there
