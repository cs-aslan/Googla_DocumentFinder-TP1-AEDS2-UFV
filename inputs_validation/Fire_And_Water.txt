Every single day I got a heartache comin my way  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
Baby but look at the tears in my eye  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
Mama but look at the way you made me cry  
Every way thats nice  
You show youve got a heart thats made of ice  
  
And I know  
  
Fire and water must have made you their daughter  
Youve got what it takes to make a poor mans heart break  
A poor mans heart break  
  
Baby you turn me on  
But as quick as a flash your love is gone  
Baby Im gonna leave you now  
But Im gonna try to make you grieve somehow  
  
Fire and water must have made you their daughter  
Youve got what it takes to make a poor mans heart break  
A poor mans heart break  
And my heart is breakin too  
  
ahh yeah  
  
alright  
  
I dont wanna say goodbye baby  
But look at the tears you made me cry  
Every way thats nice  
You show youve got a heart thats made of ice  
And I know  
  
Fire and water must have made you their daughter  
Youve got what it takes to make a poor mans heart break  
  
Fire fire and water must have made you their daughter  
Baby youve got what it takes to make a poor mans heart break  
Heart break  
  
Baby and my heart is breakin  
Ohh my heart is breakin  
Ohh listen
