Youre the first thing in the morning  
And the last thing at night  
And Ill always hear you calling  
Youre always on my mind  
  
I dont want noone but you ooh ooh  
And I dont need a second string  
I dont want a share of you ooh ooh  
I want to be your everything  
  
Chorus  
Sunrise  as long as youll be mine  
Midnight  that would be just fine  
Rain or shine  it wouldnt change my mind  
IIIalways find the time  
  
Look around me  
I can always see your face  
Theres a feeling thats surrounding  
Its in every move you make  
All the other guys I see ooh ohh  
They dont get a second chance  
Funny they dont interest me ohh ohh  
I dont give them a second glance  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont want noone but you ooh ooh  
And I dont need a second string  
I dont want a share of you ooh ooh  
I want to be your everything  
  
Chorus until fade
