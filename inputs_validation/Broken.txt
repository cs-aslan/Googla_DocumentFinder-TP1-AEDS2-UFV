Dead state I can feel the weight  
Light streaming in through the open grate  
Tooth red score tearing up the floor  
Out in the alley with the trigger draw  
  
Numb hands I can see the strand  
Hold it together with a severed band  
Three lost years Ive been crying here  
Im over Im over Im over Im broken  
  
Strung out on the wings of the dawn  
Hole in the back soul in the storm  
Torn down through the cracks in the dark  
Were miles adrift were inches apart  
  
Im hit I can feel the grit  
Sat in the asher on the beaten brick  
Tooth red main running through the vein  
Out in the center with a mirrored cane  
  
Numb feet I can hear you speak  
Hold it together with a severed streak  
Three long years Ive been crying here  
Im over Im over Im over Im broken  
  
Strung out on the wings of the dawn  
Hole in the back soul in the storm  
Torn down through the cracks in the dark  
Were miles adrift were inches apart  
  
Stood up on the side of the earth  
Thrown back to the track to the dirt  
Tooth red lose an hour a day  
Were miles adrift were inches away  
  
Strung out on the wings of the dawn  
Hole in the back soul in the storm  
Torn down through the cracks in the dark  
Were miles adrift were inches apart  
  
Stood up on the side of the earth  
Thrown back to the track to the dirt  
Tooth red lose an hour a day  
Were miles adrift were inches away  
  
Were miles adrift were inches away  
Were miles adrift were inches away  
Were miles adrift were inches away  
Were miles adrift were inches away  
  
Hold it together with a severed band  
Cant feel the blood
