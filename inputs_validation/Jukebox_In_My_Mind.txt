Chorus  
In the corner of my mind stands a jukebox  
Its playing all my favorite memories  
One by one they take me back  
To the days when you were mine  
And i cant stop this jukebox in my mind  
  
I dont need no quarters  
Dont need any dimes  
You filled it up forever  
When you said goodbye  
Heaven knows i love old melodies  
They were meant to ease the pain  
But the kind thats playing on my mind  
Are driving me insane  
  
Chorus  
  
Song by song those melodies  
Were meant to ease the pain  
But the kind thats playing on my mind  
Are driving me insane  
  
Chorus  
  
Tag  
No i cant stop this jukebox in my mind  
  
Chorus
