How can I just let you walk away  
Just let you leave without a trace  
When Im standing taking every breath  
With you ooohhh  
Youre the only one who really knew me  
At all  
  
How can you just walk away from me  
When all I can do is watch you leave  
Cause we shared the laughter and the pain  
And even shared the tears  
Youre the only one who really knew me at all  
  
So take a look at me now  
Theres just an empty space  
Theres nothing left here to remind me  
Just the memory of your face  
So take a look at me now  
Theres just an empty space  
If youre coming back to me its against the odds  
And thats what Ive got to face  
  
I wish I could just make you turn around  
Turn around and see me cry  
Theres so much I need to say to you  
So many reasons why  
Youre the only one who really knew me at all  
  
So take a look at me now  
Theres just an empty space  
Theres nothing left here to remind me  
Just the memory of your face  
So take a look at me now  
So theres just an empty space  
But to wait for you is all I can do  
When thats what Ive got to face  
  
Take a good look at me now  
Cause Ill be standing here  
Mark Standing here  
And you coming back to me is against the odds  
And thats the chance Ive got to take  
  
Got to take  
Got to take  
  
Ooh  
Take a look at me now  
  
Take a look at me now
