Katy tried  
I was halfway crucified  
I was on the other side  
Of no tomorrow  
You walked in  
And my life began again  
Just when Id spent the last piaster  
I could borrow  
All night long  
We would sing that stupid song  
And every word we sang  
I knew was true  
Are you with me Doctor Wu  
Are you really just a shadow  
Of the man that I once knew  
Are you crazy are you high  
Or just an ordinary guy  
Have you done all you can do  
Are you with me Doctor  
  
Dont seem right  
Ive been strung out here all night  
Ive been waiting for the taste  
You said youd bring to me  
Biscayne Bay  
Where the Cuban gentlemen sleep all day  
I went searching for the song  
You used to sing to me  
Katy lies  
You could see it in her eyes  
But imagine my surprise  
When I saw you  
  
Are you with me Doctor Wu  
Are you really just a shadow  
Of the man that I once knew  
She is lovely yes shes sly  
And youre an ordinary guy  
Has she finally got to you  
Can you hear me Doctor
