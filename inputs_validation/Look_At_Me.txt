ZRo Heavy Rotation yeah  
ZRo  
Ive been running the streets 24 years look at me  
I made it but Im wanted most of my peers look at me  
I keep a heater in case I run across my beef look at me  
And Im so full it hurt my mouth when I speak look at me  
Im rapping but Im still working the corner look at me  
Hustling everyday selling work and marijuana look at me  
I keep a vest on I keep my chest on look at me  
With a real groupie when pull out a press on look at me  
I might dress prepped up but I still do crime look at me  
Im a geurilla cant you tell it when I rhyme look at me  
I dont need no soda straight out the paint bottle  
And I dont care if you dont like it cause I aint your role model  
Chorus  2x  
Tell me where your hood and Ima tell you where mine  
But dont be beefing when you come around a g on his grind  
Smoking nothing but pine need no drama on my mind  
Pump your breaks bet not disrespect the stop sign  
ZRo  
Im out that Mo City where they dont bar none look at me  
I never leave the pad without packing a gun look at me  
I dont be set tripping any one of yall can get it look at me  
Ima take you out if you interrupt the flow of digits look at me  
I produce hits but radio wont play my song look at me  
I keep a record cause all that hating made me strong look at me  
I must confess that I be looking for trouble look at me  
When I make a million Ill be looking to double look at me  
Nothing but pen pimping and smoking that pine look at me  
Im like the law cause all these boys gone mind look at me  
I dont need no soda straight out the paint bottle  
And I dont care if you dont like it cause I aint your role model  
Chorus  2x  
ZRo  
Im addicted to putting my hands on cash look at me  
Im that little sodier that dont need a soldier rag look at me  
Its self explanatory to escallade to jag look at me  
I started off with hardens off in sperate bags look at me  
Now Im on top of the world and aint no falling look at me  
Got to tell them back back somebody keep on calling  
All in with six screens in my load  
RIP to FAT PAT Southside for sho look at me  
Ima navigate this big ride body lac look at me  
Im ghetto fabulous I got hooks beats and sacks look at me  
I dont need no soda straight out the paint bottle  
And I dont care if you dont like it cause I aint your role model  
Chorus  2x
