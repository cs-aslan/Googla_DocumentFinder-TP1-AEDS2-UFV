In the fields of the lord  
Stood Abel and Cain  
Cain slew Abel neath the black rain  
At night he couldnt stand the guilt or the blame  
So he gave it a name  
So he gave it a name  
So he gave it a name  
  
Billy got drunk angry at his wife  
He hit her once he hit her twice  
At night hed lie in bed he couldnt stand the shame  
So he gave it a name  
So he gave it a name  
So he gave it a name  
  
Pa told me Son one thing I know is true  
Poison snake bites you youre poison too  
At night I can feel that poison runnin round my veins
