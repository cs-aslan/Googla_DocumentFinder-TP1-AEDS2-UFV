Welcome to the party  
Come on in and disappear  
Youre feeling like a stranger  
But all your friends are here  
Little lines and cracks  
Around your eyes and mouth  
Somethings trying to get in  
Somethings trying to get out  
  
Its OK to be a little broken  
Everybodys broken in this life  
Its OK to feel a little broken  
Everybodys broken youre alright  
Its just life  
  
Step into the deep end  
Make yourself at home  
When you wonder why your breathing  
Know youre not alone  
Its so hard to believe  
Its easier to doubt  
Youre trying to hold in  
But youre dying to scream out  
  
Its OK to be a little broken  
Everybodys broken  
In this life  
Its OK to feel a little broken  
Everybodys broken youre alright  
Its alright its just life  
  
Take a look around  
Tell me what you see  
Is who you think you are  
Who you want to be  
  
Its OK to be a little broken  
Everybodys broken in this life  
Its OK to feel a little broken  
Everybodys broken youre alright  
Just keep on going  
Eyes wide open  
Everybodys broken  
Everybodys broken  
Everybodys broken  
Everybodys broken  
Everybodys broken  
Everybodys broken  
Yeah
