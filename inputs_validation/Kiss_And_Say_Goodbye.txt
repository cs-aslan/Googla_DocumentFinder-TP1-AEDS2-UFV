Had to meet you here today  
Theres just so many things to say  
Please dont stop me till Im through  
This is something I hate to do  
Weve been meeting here so long  
I guess what we done oh was wrong  
Please darlin dont you cry  
Lets just kiss and say goodbye  
  
Many months have passed us by  
Im gonna miss you  
I cant lie Ive got ties and so do you  
I just think this is the thing to do  
  
Its gonna hurt me I cant lie  
Maybe youll meet youll meet another guy  
Understand me wont you try try try try try try try  
Lets just kiss and say goodbye  
  
Im gonna miss you I cant lie  
Understand me wont you try  
Its gonna hurt me I cant lie  
Take my handkerchief and wipe your eyes  
Maybe youll find youll find another guy  
Lets just kiss and say goodbye
