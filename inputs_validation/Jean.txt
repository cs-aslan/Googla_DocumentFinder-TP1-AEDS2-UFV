Jean Jean roses are red  
All the leaves have gone green  
And the clouds are so low  
You can touch them and so  
Come out to the meadow Jean  
  
Jean Jean youre young and alive  
Come out of your halfdreamed dream  
And run if you will to the top of the hill  
Open your arms bonnie Jean  
  
Till the sheep in the valley come home my way  
Till the stars fall around me and find me alone  
When the sun comes asingin Ill still be waitin  
  
For Jean Jean roses are red  
And all of the leaves have gone green  
While the hills are ablaze with the moons yellow haze  
Come into my arms bonnie Jean  
  
Jean Jean  
Jean youre young and alive  
Come out of your halfdreamed dream  
And run if you will to the top of the hill  
Come into my arms bonnie Jean  
  
Jean  
  
Lalalala etc
