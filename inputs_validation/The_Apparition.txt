Now Im here can you see me  
cause Im out on my own  
When the room goes cold tell me  
You can feel me  
Cause Im here  
  
Here I am can you see me  
Passing through on my way  
To a place Id been to only in my  
Dreams before  
  
In a world of delusion  
Never turn your back on a friend  
cause you can count your  
Real true friends on one hand  
  
Through life  
  
There are those that deceive you  
There are those thatll let you down  
Is there someone out there that would  
Die for you  
Thought not  
  
Live your life with a passion  
Everything you do do well  
You only get out of life what you put in  
So they say  
  
In a world of confusion  
People never say what they mean  
If you want a straight answer  
Go look for one  
Right now  
  
In a room full of strangers  
Do you stand with your back to the wall  
Do you sometimes feel like youre  
On the outside  
Looking in  
  
You can make your own luck  
You create your destiny  
I believe you have the power  
If you want to  
Its true  
  
You can do what you want to  
If you try a little bit harder  
A little bit of faith goes a long way  
It does  
  
Are we here for a reason  
Id like to know just what you think  
It would be nice to know what  
Happens when we die  
Wouldnt it  
There are some who are wise  
There are some who are born naive  
I believe that there are some that must  
Have lived before  
Dont you  
  
As for me well Im thinking  
You gotta keep an open mind  
But I hope that my lifes not an  
Open and shut case  
  
Extrasensory Perception  
Life after death telepathy  
Can the soul live on and travel through  
Space and time  
  
You know I feel so elated  
cause Im about to find it out  
And when I know all the answers  
Maybe then Ill come back  
To fill you in  
  
You dont be alarmed now  
If I try to contact you  
If things go missing or get moved around  
Its me  
And dont disbelieve it  
No matter what your friends  
Might say  
Well meet up again someplace  
Some way  
One day
