I didnt know bout the modern ways of life I didnt really care  
I never gave a damn about the future I never got my share  
Somebody said boy your times a wastin youre movin much too slow  
So many things in life worth tastin so much you oughta know  look out  
  
Get down fool around if you got half a chance you take it  
Ooh yeah stand your ground you gotta bend the rules to make it  
Hold tight see the light think of all the dues youre payin  
So true Im tellin you wise up cant you hear me sayin  
  
You gotta get all you can take  sing along gotta keep on hummin  
Stop waitin for your lucky break  stop waitin wastin time  
What fuckin difference does it make  ooh gotta keep it comin  
You gotta get all you can take  doncha know Im gonna take whats mine  
  
People lookin eyes wide open tell me what you see  
Bodies tired minds a chokin you gotta set em free  
Dont think about the race theyre runnin theyll never let you in  
With all the rules its a race of fools and you can never win  look out  
  
Get down fool around think of all the dues youre payin  
Oh yeah stand your ground wise up cant you hear me sayin  
  
You gotta get all you can take  sing along gotta keep on hummin  
Stop waitin for your lucky break  stop waitin wastin time  
What fuckin difference does it make  ooh gotta keep it comin  
You gotta get all you can take  doncha know Im gonna take whats mine  
Yeah you know what Im talking about ah just take a look around you  
  
You gotta get all you can take  sing along gotta keep on hummin  
Stop waitin for your lucky break  stop waitin wastin time  
What fuckin difference does it make  ooh gotta keep it comin  
You gotta get all you can take  doncha know Im gonna take whats mine
