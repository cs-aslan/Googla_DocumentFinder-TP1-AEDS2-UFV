Hit my snooze alarm for the twenty seventh time  
Just dont feel like goin to work I think Ill call my boss  
Then Im gonna hack and cough and wheeze  
Swear Ive got some strange disease  
Whats that little twerp gonna say  
Hey  
Im callin in sick today  
Callin in sick today  
  
I could shine my pennies or clean my lava lamp  
I could spend all day in my underwear watching Ernest Goes to Camp  
I could sit and count my hair  
I could burp my Tupperware  
Im not busy now anyway  
Hey  
  
Im callin in sick today  
Callin in sick today  
Aint goin to work no way  
Callin in sick today  
  
I can do anything I want to  
I am invincible now  
Im on fire baby  
Im alive Im alive can you hear me world  
Im alive  
  
Maybe Ill spend all day staring at the sun  
And trying not to squint  
Maybe Ill make a huge color tapestry from  
My belly button lint  
When Im sick of takin abuse  
I just make up some lame excuse  
Freedoms just seven digits away  
Hey  
  
Im callin in sick today  
Callin in sick today  
Aint goin to work no way  
Callin in sick today
