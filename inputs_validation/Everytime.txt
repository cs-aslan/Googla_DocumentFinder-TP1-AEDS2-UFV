In a little while Verse One  
Ill be on my way  
Got no words to express  
What I need to say  
  
Chorus  
Everytime I think about the first time Chorus  
We said hello  
You know when you know  
You never let go  
  
Its just not my style Verse Two  
Something I cant do  
After all this time  
Im scared of losing you  
  
Chorus  
  
Is there anything Verse Three  
You could let me know  
Surely you could find me  
A reason not to go  
  
Chorus  
  
After everything Verse Four  
Weve been going through  
Im so up and down  
So dizzy and blue  
  
Chorus  
  
Let me one more time Verse Five  
Look into your eyes  
I remember when  
There were no goodbyes  
  
Chorus
