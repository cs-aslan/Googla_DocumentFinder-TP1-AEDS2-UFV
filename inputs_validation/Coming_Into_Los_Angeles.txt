Coming in from London from over the pole  
Flyin in a big jet liner  
Chicks are flyin everywhere around the plane  
Could we ever feel much finer  
  
Comin into Los Angeles  
Bringin in a couple of keys  
Dont touch my bags if you please mister customs man  
  
Theres a guy with a ticket to Mexico  
No he couldnt look much stranger  
Walkin in the hall with his things and all  
Smilin said he was the lone ranger  
  
Comin into Los Angeles  
Bringin in a couple of keys  
Dont touch my bags if you please mister customs man  
  
Hip woman walkin on the movin floor  
Trippin on the escalator  
Theres a man in the line and shes blowin his mind  
Thinkin that hes already made her  
  
Comin into Los Angeles  
Bringin in a couple of keys  
Dont touch my bags if you please mister customs man  
  
Comin in from London from over the poll  
Flyin in a big airliner  
Chicks are flyin everywhere around the plane  
Could we ever feel much finer  
  
Comin into Los Angeles  
Bringin in a couple of keys  
Dont touch my bags if you please mister customs man
