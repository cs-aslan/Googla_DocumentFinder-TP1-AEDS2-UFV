Johnny get your girl  
Tap her on the shoulder  
Tap her on the shoulder  
Say youll like to hold her  
  
Johnny get your girl  
Walk her in the moonlight  
If youve got no moonlight  
Talk about a June night  
  
Dont wait for introductions  
Dont be so formal  
Just step right up and do the thing thats normal  
Johnny get your girl  
  
Tap her on the shoulder  
Get a little bolder  
Give romance a whirl  
Dont let another Johnny get your girl  
  
Dont wait for introductions  
Dont be so formal  
Just step right up and do the thing thats normal  
John get that girl  
  
Tap her on the shoulder  
Get a little bolder  
Give romance a whirl  
Dont you let another Johnny get your girl
