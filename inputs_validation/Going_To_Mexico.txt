Pack my bags  
Dont be too slow  
I should have quit you baby  
A long time ago  
Left you flat  
And split for Mexico  
Dont try to stop me  
Child youre talkin too fast  
You and your friends babe  
You are a thing in my past  
Youre much too slow  
Im goin to Mexico  
Ive got four or five hundred miles to go  
Down that southbound highway  
53 Studebaker goin for broke  
Im pushin it night and day  
Ive had enough of your lies  
To last a long long time  
You and your mother babe  
Youre like a nursery rhyme  
Youre much too slow  
Im goin to Mexico  
Yeah come on baby  
Yeah
