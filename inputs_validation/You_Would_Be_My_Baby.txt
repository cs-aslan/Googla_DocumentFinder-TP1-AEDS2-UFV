From The Mask soundtrack  
If I have a secret resepy  
You would be my baby  
If I have the perfect fantasy  
  
You would be my baby  
If the world was mine to redesign  
Then suddenly you would find  
That youd be my baby  
  
If I wrote you poems that made you cry  
Would you be my baby  
If I say the sweetest lullaby  
Would you be my baby  
  
If I promise you the moon and stars  
With heaven waiting in my heart  
Would you be my baby  
But if I only have  
  
True love to offer you  
Would that be enough  
To make you want me to  
I would kiss and talk you then each night  
  
You would be my baby  
Then had watch youre sleep and hold you tight  
You would be my baby  
I would make you mine for rich upon  
  
And never need to ask for more  
If youd be my baby  
You would be my baby  
If I had a chance that well romance  
  
If I can chose my circumstance  
Then youd be my baby  
But if I only have  
True love to offer you  
  
Would that be enough  
To make you want me to  
If I have a secret resepy  
You would be my baby  
  
If I have the perfect fantasy  
You would be my baby  
If the world was mine to redesign  
Then suddenly you would find  
  
That youd be my  
You would be my babywould be my baby
