Bline Lemon Jefferson is acoming  
Tap tap tappin with his cane  
Bline Lemon Jefferson is acoming  
Tap tap tappin with his cane  
His last ditch lies down the road of trials  
Half filled with rain  
O Sycamore Sycamore  
Stretch your arms across the storm  
Down fly two greasy brothercrows  
They hopnbop hopnbop hopnbop  
Like the taxman come to call  
They go knock knock Knock knock  
Hopnbop hopnbop  
They slap a deathwrit on his door  
Here come the Judgement train  
Git on board  
And turn that big black engine home  
O lets roll  
Lets roll  
Down the tunnel  
The terrible tunnel of his world  
Waiting at his final station  
Like a bigger blacker third bird  
O lets roll  
Lets roll  
O his road is dark and lonely  
He dont drive no Cadillac  
O his road is dark and holy  
He dont drive no cadillac  
If that sky serves as his eyes  
Then that moons a cataract  
Lets roll  
Yeah lets roll  
Ad lib
