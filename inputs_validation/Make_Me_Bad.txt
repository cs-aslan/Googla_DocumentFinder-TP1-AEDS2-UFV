I am watching the rise  
And fall of my salvation  
Theres so much shit around me  
Such a lack of compassion  
  
I thought it would be fun and games  
it would be fun and games  
Instead its all the same  
its all the same  
I want something to do  
Need to feel the sickness in you  
  
I feel the reason as its leaving me  
No not again  
Its quite deceiving as Im feeling  
The flesh make me bad  
  
All I do is look for you  
And when I fix you needed to  
  
Just to get some sort of attention attention  
  
What does it mean to you  
For me its something I just do  
I want something  
I need to feel the sickness in you  
  
I feel the reason as its leaving me  
No not again  
Its quite deceiving as Im feeling  
The flesh make me bad
