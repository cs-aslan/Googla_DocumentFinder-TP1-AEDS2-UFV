Id say Im always happy if you want me to  
But sometimes its not the case  
My life is not as perfect as it seems to be  
Its simply Gods amazing grace  
Im here to finally let you know  
What keeps me hanging on  
What keeps me going strong  
Im here to share His love with you  
There is no need to fear to live this life of love  
  
Chorus  
With a little faith with a little love  
I know we can make it  
I know we can make it  
With a little help sent from God above  
I know we can make it  
I know we can make it through  
  
I know what it takes to be yourself  
Instead of when they put you down  
I cant understand why you choose to hide  
When you should run to the strength I found  
If only youd see for yourself  
Then you could know the one  
Who loves you so much more  
If only I could help you out  
But Gods the only one  
  
What are you waiting for  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
It seems to wash away  
Cant find a will to go on  
But I am here to say theres hope  
You must carry on  
Jesus will light your way  
Hell give you all that you need  
No need to be afraid all youve got to do is believe
