Please Dont Make Me Cry  
You say you are going to leave me  
Im begging you to stay  
My baby I cant get through any way  
No I cant  
And when I wake up in the morning  
You are gone  
Little pretty thing  
You know Ill be all alone  
  
Chorus  
Youll hear me crying mmmmmmm  
Please dont make me cry mmm mmmm  
cos I cant say goodbye mmmmm  
Please dont make me cry  
Because I know  
There will be nothing left for me  
  
All them good good times  
We spent together  
You said it was me and no other yeah  
And now you want to make me pain inside  
Darlin I Know you are going to make me cry  
  
Chorus  
Youll hear me  etc  
All this pain I cant stand it  
Youre going to leave  
Youre going to leave this poor man on his own  
Yes you are mmmmm  
  
Chorus  
Youll hear me  etc  
All this pain I cant stand it  
Youre going to leave  
Youre going to leave this poor man on his own  
Yes you are  
Please dont make me cry  
Baby Im Pleading
