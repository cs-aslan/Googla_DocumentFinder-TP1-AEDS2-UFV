Theres something strange in the old corral  
Theres a breeze though the wind has died  
Though Im alone in the old corral  
Seems there is someone at my side  
  
Chorus  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
Where do ya ride tonight  
Are ya roundin up the dogies  
The strays of long ago  
Are ya on the trail of buffalo  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
Where do ya ride tonight  
Are there rustlers on the border  
Or a band of Navajo  
Are ya headin for the Alamo  
Empty guns covered with rust  
Where do ya talk tonight  
Empty boots covered with dust  
Where do ya walk tonight  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
My tears would be dried tonight  
If youll only say Im lonely  
As ya carry my old pal  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
  
There is no smoke still the fires burn  
Theres no song still I hear guitars  
There is no dust still the ghosts return  
Softly to vanish through the bars  
  
Chorus
