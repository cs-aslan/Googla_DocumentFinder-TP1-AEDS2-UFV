Saturday night you look so chic  
Been waiting for this moment been waiting all week  
The pub is crowded much too hot  
The boys theyre dancing they just cant stop  
  
Tomorrows dance tomorrows dance  
You dance your dance you dance your chance  
Tomorrows dance tomorrows dance  
You dance with pride and you dance with pride  
  
Ice cold drinks get sold tonight  
Were gonna get happy the occasion is right  
You start to move you take the floor  
The music is better than ever before  
  
Tomorrows dance tomorrows dance  
You dance your dance you dance your chance  
Tomorrows dance tomorrows dance  
You dance with pride and you dance with pride  
  
3 am I just cant last  
The music is loud and much too fast  
You cannot get out you wanna stay  
You gotta hang out another dancing day  
  
Tomorrows dance tomorrows dance  
You dance your dance you dance your chance  
Tomorrows dance tomorrows dance  
You dance with pride and you dance with pride
