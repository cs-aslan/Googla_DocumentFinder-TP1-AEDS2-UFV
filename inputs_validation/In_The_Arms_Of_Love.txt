I see your face and feel your heartache  
I see the trace of the tears you have cried  
The silent sound of the heart left unspoken  
You were strong enough to hide  
All your life no ones ever shown you  
What its really like to have someone to hold you  
  
Chorus  
In the arms of love heavens just a heartbeat away  
Ill be your light in the dark your shield from the storm  
Your shelter from the rain  
And in the arms of love Ill lift you above all the madness  
All of the pain  
And youll be safe and warm here in the arms of love  
  
We search this world for a little compassion  
For just one look through the eyes of a child  
For one more chance to be a believer  
While theres still a chance in time  
All your life no one there beside you  
Close your eyes and let this moment find you  
  
Chorus  
  
High above the world where dreams are sailing  
Far beyond the brightest shinin star  
Where everything youve waited for is waiting  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill keep you far from harm here in the arms of love
