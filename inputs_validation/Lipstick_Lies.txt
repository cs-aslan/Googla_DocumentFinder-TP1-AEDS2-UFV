Youve gotta admit you paint a pretty picture  
No one would ever suspect your so adept at the art  
I hear the lonely lover sigh  
You hide behind cosmetic eyes  
Kiss them off with Lipstick Lies  
Lipstick Lies wont hide the truth  
They wont keep you waterproof  
The victim of your vanity  
Youre the Picasso of pain a fantasy in fleshtone  
And though youre never the same  
Youre never far from the mark  
Now and then you close your eyes  
To see the heartbreak in disguise  
Kiss them off with Lipstick Lies  
Lipstick Lies wont hide the truth  
They wont keep you waterproof  
The victim of your vanity  
You see just what you want to see  
Whos to blame  
Love is love by any name  
Whos to blame  
Lipstick Lies wont hide the truth  
They wont keep you waterproof  
The victim of your vanity  
You see just what you want to see  
Whos to blame  
Love is love by any name  
Whos to blame  
Love is love by any name  
Whos to blame  
Love is love by any name  
Whos to blame
