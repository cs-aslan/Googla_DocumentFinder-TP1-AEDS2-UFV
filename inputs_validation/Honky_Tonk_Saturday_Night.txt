Angels and devils share the same tables  
And thats not so wrong if you get it done right  
Halos and horns lock up on the dance floor  
On a honkytonk Saturday night  
  
Its a honkytonk Saturday night  
Its not who is who its who will or who might  
With luck shell turn on fore they turn out the lights  
On a honkytonk Saturday night  
  
I played the jukebox I played some merle haggard  
Me and the waitress think hes outta sight  
Then some folks got thirsty while we were dancin  
On a honkytonk Saturday night  
  
Its a honkytonk Saturday night  
Its not who is who its who will or who might  
With luck Ill turn her on fore they turn out the lights  
On a honkytonk Saturday night  
  
With luck Ill take her home fore they turn out the lights  
On a honkytonk Saturday night
