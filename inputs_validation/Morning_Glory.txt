No words this time  
No words  
No there are times when nothing can be done  
Not this time  
Is it censorship  
Is it censorship No its evaporation  
No its evaporation  
Is this leading somewhere  
Yes Were going down the lane  
Is this going somewhere  
Into the garden  
Into the backyard  
Were walking down the driveway  
Are we moving towards  
Were in the backyard some transcendental moment  
Its almost light Thats right Thats it  
Are we moving towards some transcendental moment  
Thats right Thats it  
Do you think youll be able to pull it off  
Yes Do you think you can pull it off  
Yes it might happen Im all ears  
Im all ears Oh the morning glory
