Ive tried to hold this back so long  
And were always such a good thing when its gone  
Would it be alright if we just left our heads tonight  
  
Take me away from this old game  
Of saying that were both too much the same  
  
Would it be alright if I just stayed with you tonight  
And before I go will I ever see you again  
She said love only knows  
  
Love only knows  
If well give into fear and chose life undercover  
She said love only knows  
If its special enough then well chose one another  
Well chose each other  
  
You were the secret I loved to keep  
The name I would only sing in my sleep  
Would it be alright if we just lose ourselves tonight  
And if you let go will you reach out again  
She said love only knows  
  
Love only knows if well give into fear and chose life undercover  
She said love only knows if its special enough then well chose one another  
Well choose each other  
  
And I cant breathe without you and I dont  
And I cant live without love and I wont  
And I wont  
  
Love only knows  
If well give into fear and choose life undercover  
She said love only knows if its special enough then well choose one another  
Love only knows how your arms pull me in like the tide pulls me under  
She said love only knows just how long we can run before we lose each other  
And we need each other  
  
And I cant live without you and I wont
