Somethings missin when you hold me  
You dont whisper that youre mine  
Oh it all seems to fall into line  
  
Every promise that you make me  
Breaks like bubbles in the wine  
And it all seems to fall into line  
  
In a fog that isnt lifting  
We are drifting apart  
I can see someones replaced me in your heart  
  
Theres a coolness in your kisses  
That is only one more sign  
How it all seems to fall into line  
  
In a fog that isnt lifting  
We are drifting apart  
I can see someones replaced me in your heart  
  
Theres a coolness in your kisses  
That is only one more sign  
How it all seems to fall into line  
  
Yes it all seems to fall into line
