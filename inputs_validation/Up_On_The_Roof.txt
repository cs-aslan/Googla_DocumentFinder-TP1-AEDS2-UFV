When this old world starts a getting me down  
And people are just too much for me to face  
Ill climb way up to the top of the stairs  
And all my cares just drift right into space  
On the roof its peaceful as can be  
And there the world below dont bother me no no  
So when I come home feeling tired and beat  
Ill go up where the air is fresh and sweet  
Ill get far away from the hustling crowd  
And all that ratrace noise down in the street  
On the roof thats the only place I know  
Look at the city baby  
Where you just have to wish to make it so  
Lets go up on the roof  
And at night the stars they put on a show for free  
And darling you can share it all with me  
Thats what I said keep on telling you  
That right smack dab in the middle of town  
I found a paradise thats trouble proof  
And if this old world starts a getting you down  
Theres room enough for two up on the roof  
Up on the roof up on a roof  
Everything is alright everything is alright  
Come on  
Drop what youre doin tonight and  
Climb up the stairs and see with me babe  
We got the stars above and the city lights below  
Up on the roof now
