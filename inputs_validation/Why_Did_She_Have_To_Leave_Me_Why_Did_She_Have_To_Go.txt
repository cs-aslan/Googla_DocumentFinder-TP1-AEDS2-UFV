There were times I knew  
But I found it hard to say  
You were special in my life  
Never thought youd go away  
  
Ill be strong  
Ill get by  
Without you in my life  
I can see  
Through your lies  
Did you ever love me  
I never found your love  
You and I know  
Love is leaving  
And you dont want me anymore  
Why should I  
Even try  
You and I know  
Love is leaving  
Now youre the last thing on my mind  
Someone else  
I will find  
A memory Ive left behind  
  
If I ever made you cry  
Any reason I cant find  
It was lonely by your side  
Like a fool I stood by you  
  
Ill be strong  
Ill get by  
Without you in my life  
I can see  
Through your lies  
Did you ever love me  
I never found your love  
You and I know  
Love is leaving  
And you dont want me anymore  
Why should I  
Even try  
You and I know  
Love is leaving  
Now youre the last thing on my mind  
Someone else  
I will find  
A memory Ive left behind  
  
Is there something I could do  
Is there something I should say  
Is there someone else to keep you from  
And now  
Whoa whoa yeah yeah yeahyeahyeah  
  
You and I know  
Love is leaving  
And you dont want me anymore  
Why should I  
Even try  
You and I know  
Love is leaving  
Now youre the last thing on my mind  
Someone else  
I will find  
A memory Ive left behind  
You and I know  
Love is leaving  
And you dont want me anymore  
Why should I  
Even try  
You and I know  
Love is leaving  
Now youre the last thing on my mind  
Why should I  
Even try
