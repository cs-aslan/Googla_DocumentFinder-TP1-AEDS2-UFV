What kind of present does he dream about  
A leather wallet or a singing trout  
What I should get him is a mystery  
And if its lame will he still want me  
What does he want  
A dvd or some video games  
What does he want  
Or maybe one of those new digital frames  
What does he want  
Something to fit his personality  
What does he want  
The perfect present is eluding me  
My friends all tell me that I shouldnt obsess  
But how can I avoid the stress  
I need to know but right now all I can do is guess  
What does he want  
A fancy cell phone or a tube of grout  
What does he want  
I dont know but Ill figure it out  
What does he want  
Rearview mirror glasses as seen on tv  
What does he want  
I only wish I knew what he got me  
Cause I hear its perfect  
What does he want
