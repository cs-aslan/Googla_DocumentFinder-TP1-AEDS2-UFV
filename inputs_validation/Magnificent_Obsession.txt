Youre my magnificent obsession  
The greatest wonder on this earth  
The taj mahal and other spendors  
To me really have no worth  
  
Youre my magificent possession  
A treasure lent me from above  
As long as I have breath within me  
Youll be my one and only love

Youre my magificent possession  
A treasure lent me from above  
As long as I have breath within me  
Youll be my one and only love
