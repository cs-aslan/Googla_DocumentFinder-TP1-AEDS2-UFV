Oh oh oh  
In the heart  
Of the night  
When its dark  
In the lights  
I heard the loudest noise  
A gunshot on the floor  
Oh oh  
  
I looked down  
And my shirts turning red  
Im spinning around  
Felt her lips on my neck  
And her voice  
In my ear  
Like I missed you  
Want you tonight  
  
Chorus  
Straight through my heart  
A single bullet got me  
I cant stop the bleeding  
Oh oh  
Straight through my heart  
She aimed and she shot me  
I just cant believe it  
Oh oh  
No I cant resist  
And I cant be hit  
I just cant escape this love  
Straight through my heart  
Soldier down my heart  
Soldier down my heart  
  
Thought I moved  
More than on  
Thought I could  
Fool her charm  
I really wanna go  
But I cant leave her alone  
Oh oh  
  
Hear the sound  
Of a love so loud  
I just cant  
I just cant  
Ignore this feeling  
Said she missed me  
And she wants me  
Wants me tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
In the heart  
Of the night  
When its dark  
In the lights  
I heard the loudest voice  
A gunshot on the floor  
Oh oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Straight through my heart  
Soldier down my heart  
Soldier down my heart  
My heart my heart my heart  
Straight through my heart  
Soldier down my heart  
Soldier down my heart  
Oh oh
