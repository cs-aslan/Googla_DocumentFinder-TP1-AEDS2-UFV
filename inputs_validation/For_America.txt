As if I really didnt understand  
That I was just another part of their plan  
I went off looking for the promise  
Believing in the Motherland  
And from the comfort of a dreamers bed  
And the safety of my own head  
I went on speaking of the future  
While other people fought and bled  
The kid I was when I first left home  
Was looking for his freedom and a life of his own  
But the freedom that he found wasnt quite as sweet  
When the truth was known  
I have prayed for America  
I was made for America  
Its in my blood and in my bones  
By the dawns early light  
By all I know is right  
Were going to reap what we have sown  
  
As if freedom was a question of might  
As if loyalty was black and white  
You hear people say it all the time  
My country wrong or right  
I want to know what thats got to do  
With what it takes to find out whats true  
With everyone from the President on down  
Trying to keep it from you  
  
The thing I wonder about the Dads and Moms  
Who send their sons to the Vietnams  
Will they really think their way of life  
Has been protected as the next war comes  
I have prayed for America  
I was made for America  
Her shining dream plays in my mind  
By the rockets red glare  
A generations blank stare  
We better wake her up this time  
  
The kid I was when I first left home  
Was looking for his freedom and a life of his own  
But the freedom that he found wasnt quite a sweet  
When the truth was known  
I have prayed for America  
I was made for America  
I cant let go till she comes around  
Until the land of the free  
Is awake and can see  
And until her conscience has been found
