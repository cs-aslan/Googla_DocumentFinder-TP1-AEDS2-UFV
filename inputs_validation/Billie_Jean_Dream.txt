Theres only one king homie  
Ice style Ice style Ice style Ice style Ice style  
Glove on the Bentley wheel  
Look at how Im spinnin  
Youre boys so real  
Number one in the world  
Imagine how it feel  
To hit up Sony for a Billion on a deal  
Buy out the Beatles  
Tell Paul to chill  
Too to talk  
Yall read it in my will  
Aint no question on whos the boss  
So when I give orders I can talk real soft  
Theres one king Theres one king  
Theres one king Theres one king  
Theres one king of pop  
Nothin else poppin off  
Comparin him to me  
Oh please knock it off  
All of yall emanate from one source  
You try to imitate it  
But you cant pull it off  
Too unique with it  
The pimp is sweet with it  
When Im freakin it  
Its like Im teachin it  
The world is an apple  
They see me eatin it  
Haters get to makin up stuff  
Then leakin it  
How yall sound talkin bout a scandal  
750 mill aw man  
Thats why I keep my brim real low  
And a soda can filled up with Merlot  
And a private jet on deck ready to go  
And a hundred mill wouldnt make me wanna tow  
  
The smooth criminal  
Im running from the law  
Cos Ive got the biggest That your pops ever saw  
No on my pocket  
No sons on my lap  
The king wears a crown  
Not a Santa Claus hat  
I peel off some bills  
Tell em to fall back  
Its only 20 mill  
Its not all that  
  
Hold my Hold my Hold my Hold my  
Hold my umbrella  
Give me some support  
While I dance on the roof  
Of the truck at the court  
Cant pull me down  
I dont know what yall thought  
Think what you want  
But I never got caught  
K k Ii Nn Gg  
You wanna kick off on the recipe  
You see paparazzi stressin me  
Cos Marie Presley is undressin me  
Dead or alive  
Nobodys alive as me  
A close to lead to my prophecy  
Be remembered as the greatest in history  
This whole industry is my legacy  
  
Im something something something something  
Something like a phenomenon  
Something like a phenomenon  
Something like a phenomenon  
Something like a phenomenon  
Something like a phenomenon  
Repeat  
  
Yo yo the crazy thing is  
I had a dream  
Michael Jackson wrote that for me in a dream  
Thats crazy right  
Word up I had a dream  
And homeboy wrote it for me in a dream  
I saw it on the paper  
I just woke up and just jotted it all down  
It was crazy  
Yo Mike thats for you baby  
I love you  
From the goat to the King of Pop  
Youre the king homie  
Rest in Peace  
  
Take a look at my sales  
And fix your face  
Know what I mean  
Ill do what I want  
Im the king  
Ill put my nose on my chest if I want to
