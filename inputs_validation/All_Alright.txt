Yeah its all alright  
I guess its all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest  
But its all alright  
Yeah its all alright  
I guess its all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest  
But its all alright  
  
Well I got the call soon as the day hit night  
As soon as the headlights lit up the Westside  
I stopped the car and came outside  
Cause I know that tone  
I remember the first time  
We wished upon parallel lines  
Waiting for a friend to call  
And say theyre still alive  
Ive given everyone I know  
A good reason to go  
I was surprised you stuck around  
Long enough to figure out  
  
That its all alright  
I guess its all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest  
But its all alright  
Yeah its all alright  
I guess its all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest  
But its all alright  
  
And now all my loves that come back to haunt me  
My regrets and texts sent to taunt me  
I never claimed to be more than a onenight stand  
And now Ive given everyone I know  
A good reason to go  
But I came back with the belief  
That everyone I love is gonna leave me  
  
And its all alright  
I guess its all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest  
But its all alright  
Yeah its all alright  
I guess its all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest  
But its all alright  
  
And I know oh no  
Youve fallen from the sun  
Crashing through the clouds  
I see you burning out  
And I know oh no  
That I put up a front  
But maybe just this once  
Let me keep this one  
  
Yeah its all alright  
I guess its all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest  
But its all alright  
Yeah its all alright  
I guess its all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest  
But its all alright  
Yeah its all alright  
I guess its all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest  
But its all alright  
Yeah its all alright  
I guess its all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest  
But its all alright
