Till you get it right tell em you will never quit  
Tell em you will never quit until they day you get it right  
Till you get it right hold your hand to the sky  
Look em right in the eye tell em you will never quit  
Until the day you get it right  
Till you get it right  
Tell em you will never quit until the day you get it right  
Till you get it right hold your hand to the sky  
Look em right in the eye tell em you will never quit  
Until the day you get it right  
  
Single mother two jobs workin her fingers to the bone  
Putting her daughters mouth before her own  
Shes gotta do it but shes still feeling  
Like theres something deep inside that she cant leave behind  
  
She wont let go of it no matter how many times  
She hears it over with its all fixed in her mind  
That its gonna get better and she wont ever  
Hang her head again break a sweat again never again  
  
Chorus  
Never never give up never never give up  
No matter how many times somebody tells you it aint working  
Never never give up never never give up  
Hold your head tot he sky look them right in the eyes  
Tell you will never quit until the day you get it right  
Never never give up never never give up  
Even though some days youll have to cry  
Shake it off and know that everything will be alright  
As long as you never never give up never never give up  
  
College student paying her own way  
Working the club at night  
Look what she go through to stay in law school  
So maybe one day she can make her way in a mans world  
And never be called just another girl  
  
It aint nothing like a dream you cant see  
Even when the people round you dont believe  
But in the twelfth round when youre against the ropes  
Here comes your last minute miracle  
Youve got to know to  
  
Chorus  
  
The sky is the limit for whatever you want to do  
Dont let anyone tell you it aint possible  
No matter how low you feel keep going higher higher  
See Ive been holding on to my dreams too long  
To watch it get away from me  
This hand is mine to win and I promise you that  
Ill never never give up  
  
Chorus x2
