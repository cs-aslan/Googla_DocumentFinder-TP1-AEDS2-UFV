And when the day is done  
Ill find you woman and run  
Dont ask no question  
And you wont get no lies  
And if you steal away  
Ill be your only lover  
And I will love you till the day that I die  
  
And if you steal away  
Ill turn your night into day  
And get you crying like a dog for a bone  
And if you say you will  
Ill be your only lover  
And if youre good  
Ill never leave you alone  
  
Now woman dont be shy  
I see that look in your eye  
A little snakebite wont do nobody wrong  
And if you shake what you got  
Ill be your only lover  
And Ill be howling for you all night long  
  
Steal away steal away  
Steal away steal away  
  
And if you steal away  
Ill turn your night into day  
Dont ask no question  
And you wont get no lies  
And if you say you will  
Ill be your only lover  
And I will love you  
Til the day that I die
