After midnight  
I call you  
Even though I know better  
I just got to  
The moon is full  
My heart is hot  
And you know what Im longing to do  
With this aching I got  
  
The call of the wild  
Oh baby cant you hear me calling  
Oh  
The call of the wild  
The call of the wild  
  
How can you ask me  
Why Im pushing pushing  
When you know damn well  
What you do  
What you do to a woman  
I get so inspired  
Lying so close  
Its the flash and the flame and the lever  
I need the most  
  
The call of the wild  
Oh baby cant you hear me calling  
Oh  
The call of the wild  
The call of the wild  
  
If I could chain you to me  
Id do it in a minute  
My magic caravan  
Baby youd be in it  
Im hiding the prize and youre gonna win it  
Youre gonna win it now  
  
The call of the wild  
Oh baby cant you hear me calling  
Oh  
The call of the wild  
Oh  
The call of the wild  
Oh  
Oh Baby  
Listen to me howling  
  
The call of the wild
