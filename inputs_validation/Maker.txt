Days of yellow saffron  
Nights with purple skies  
Melting in the sunbeams  
from my makers eyes  
  
Mountaincolored lilac  
in the distant haze  
I would like to lie here  
timing all my days  
  
Move past my window  
sunshine is shimmering  
jackolanterns glimmering  
giant moths are flickering around  
  
See the moon is hiding  
underneath the sea  
Pretty soon hell venture  
to take a look at me  
  
So I humbly stand here  
beneath his golden glow  
Doesnt he remind me  
of somebody I know  
  
I must be leaving  
back to reality  
Dont you just pity me  
I could so easily stay here
