Another turning point  
A fork stuck in the road  
Time grabs you by the wrist  
Directs you where to go  
  
So make the best of this test  
And dont ask why  
Its not a question  
But a lesson learned in time  
  
Its something unpredictable  
But in the end its right  
I hope you had the time of your life  
  
So take the photographs  
And stillframes in your mind  
Hang it on a shelf  
And good health and good time  
  
Tattoos of memories  
And dead skin on trial  
For what its worth  
It was worth all the while  
  
Its something unpredictable  
But in the end its right  
I hope you had the time of your life  
  
Its something unpredictable  
But in the end its right  
I hope you had the time of your life  
  
Its something unpredictable  
But in the end its right  
I hope you had the time of your life
