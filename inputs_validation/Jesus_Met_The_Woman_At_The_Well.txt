Jesus met the woman at the well  
Jesus met the woman at the well  
And he told her everything that shed done that shed done  
  
And he said woman looka here woman  
Tell me where is your husband  
She said whoa whoa whoa whoa I dont have one  
  
He said woman looka here woman  
They tell me you have five husbands  
And that man you have now sure aint one  
  
She went running crying God help me  
She said whoa whoa whoa whoa you must be the prophet  
Because you told me everything that Ive done
