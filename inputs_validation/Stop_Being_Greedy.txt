Hook  
Yall been eatin long enough now stop bein greedy  
Just keep it real partner give to the needy  
Grips is touchy so dont make me wait  
Fuck around and Im goa bite you and snatch the plate  
  
dmx  
I could flip that flow I could stick that hoe  
I could get that dough you know Im with that yo  
And the thing about the shit I came through I havent seen  
But when it gets dark its like a niggas havin dreams  
All nightmares the light dares to desert me  
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me  
Paranoid so I strike out at what ever  
The closest thing to me is gonna get it  
But never will I can I think death is wrong  
So ima keep holdin on til whats left is gone  
You could put that on my nigga boone  
These other rap cats will give a nigga room  
But if it ccalls for me to force my way in the door  
Headhuntin mother fuckers stay on the floor  
44 thats what I get sick wit rrrrrrr  
Four more now all this is liquid rrrrrr

I thank the lord everyday that Im blessed with a gift  
Im the best so unless you wanna rest with the stiff  
Dont touch that uhuh leave it alone  
When you walk pass the dog house leave it a bone  
Dogs bite dogs fight dogs knife  
Scratch shake and hold all night  
So when you hear the arf arf start runnin  
Cause when you hear the arf arf Im comin  
But I dont like drama so I say to myself  
keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth  
I want the money and give me the honeys with big asses  
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses  
Im broke so ima bash his head wide open  
Beggin me to stop but at least he died hopin  
Didnt get his wish and now hes a dish with a cat  
Two glowin red eyes everything else is black  
  
hook x2  
  
dmx  
When the sun is up the gun is up on the shelf  
And all the runners up are thankin me for their help  
Hopin that they not around when it gets dark outside  
Suns goin down you hear the bark outside  
Locks off the cage gauge with the buck shots faggot  
Youve been lucky all day thats when your luck stops  
One drops and another and another  
Gun pops go into you and your mother  
When does it all end I found a friend in a dog  
Cause fuckin wit these cats will send a friend to the morgue  
Many questions no answers just stress  
Try to hold my head and remember that Im blessed  
If you curse and it gets worse as time goes by  
Cant see straight cause Im so high why ask why when you know  
Nigga when its your time to go you go  
  
hook x4
