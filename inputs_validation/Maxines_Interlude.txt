Where did my baby go  
I wonder where she ran off too  
I miss my baby so  
Im calling but I cant get through  
  
Please tell that girl if you meet her  
That someones longing to see her  
Where did my baby go  
I wish that she would get back soon  
Get back soon  
  
Im searching for the lover that I knew  
Have you see her  
Where did she go  
Feels like I just lost my only friend  
  
Plains subsided colors faded  
Love just got so complicated  
Wished that I could see her smile again  
  
So if you see her out there  
Tell her Im still here  
Waiting for the date when she will reappear  
  
Where did my baby go  
I wonder where she ran off too  
I miss my baby so  
Im calling but I cant get through  
  
Please tell that girl if you meet her  
That someones longing to see her  
Where did my baby go  
I wish that she would get back soon  
Get back soon  
  
Maybe I was wrong and I  
Ignored her for too long and I  
Didnt even notice when she slipped away  
  
Oh maybe while I lay fast asleep  
When out into the night she creeps  
Ill leave the light on  
So she will come back someday  
  
Oh if you see her out there  
Tell her its not fair  
And the life just not the same when shes not here  
  
Where did my baby go  
I wonder where she ran off too  
I miss my baby so  
Just what Im suppose to do  
  
Please tell that girl if you meet her  
That someones longing to see her  
Where did my baby go  
I wish that she would get back soon  
Get back soon  
  
Get back soon  
Get back soon  
Oh woo oh  
Oh woo  
  
Where did my baby go  
I wonder where she ran off too  
I miss my baby so  
Just what Im suppose to do  
  
Oh please tell that girl if you meet her  
That someones longing to see her  
Where did my baby go  
I wish that she would get back soon  
Get back soon  
Get back soon  
Oh get back soon
