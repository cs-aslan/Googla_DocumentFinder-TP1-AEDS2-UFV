Before Ludacris Ya boy was doin this  
Before Snoop Dogg I put rappers in the morgue  
Before Dr Dre I was hot in L A  
Before 50 Cent I was sittin on ends  
A young buck ridin in a 560 Benz

Ll Cool J  
I been doin this a long time man Im tired of gettin money  
On second thought  
Before Master P I was bout it bout it B  
Before Cash Money I already stashed money  
Before dmx I was wild on the set  
Momma Should Knock em out I lay em on the deck  
Before Wu Tang I was the new thang  
I whispered on shorty ear before Ying Yang  
Before Mobb Deep I had em shook over the beat  
Years before Busta I had my first customer

Before E40 my name shit was naughty  
Before Diddy all my whips was pretty  
Lil wild nigga from Queens runnin through the city  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
Ll Cool J  
But I cant talk to greasy  
Gotta keep it real ya know  
Grandmaster was flashin way before I cashed in  
Ya man Bambaata made the park jams hotter  
Ya man Elle El couldnt go outside  
When ya boy Melle Mel had the pimped out ride  
Way before me Kurtis Blow stacked dough  
He ruled the world I was in the front row  
RunD M C Showed me what I wanna be  
I got kicked out the studio by Kool Moe Dee  
The Cold Crush Four and the Treacherous Three  
Aint give a damn about a snotty nose kid like me  
Houdhini The Fat Boys and all that  
I hit em on the jack them niggas never called back  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
Outro  
I want to dedicate the song  
To everybody who came before me  
And everybody that they came after me  
If I aint matchin you  
Blame it on a head not the heart  
This is real  
Ll Cool J in the building baby  
Hey yo 50
