And the rivers shall open for the righteous  
And the rivers shall open for the righteous  
And the rivers shall open for the righteous someday  
  
I went walking with my brother  
And he wondered oh how I am  
Said what I believe with my soul  
Aint what I see with my eyes  
And theres no turning back this time  
I am a patriot and I love my country  
Because my country is all I know  
I want to be with my family  
People who understand me  
I got no place else to go  
I am a patriot  
  
I was walking with my girlfriend  
She looked so fine I said  
Baby whats on your mind  
Said I want to run like the lions  
Released from their cages  
Released from the rages  
Burning in my soul tonight  
  
I am a patriot and I love my country  
Because my country is all I know  
  
And I aint no communist  
And I aint no socialist  
And I aint no capitalist  
And I aint no imperialist  
And I aint no democrat  
Sure aint no republican either  
I only know one party  
And that is Freedom  
I am I am I am  
  
I am a patriot and I love my country  
Because my country is all I know  
  
And the rivers shall open for the righteous  
And the rivers shall open for the righteous  
And the rivers shall open for the righteous Someday  
Someday Someday
