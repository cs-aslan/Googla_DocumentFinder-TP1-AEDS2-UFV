Dont say it baby  
Dont say it baby  
Dont say it baby  
Dont say its only me for you  
Its not true  
Im still young and theres so much I want to do  
Dont say it baby  
Dont say it baby  
  
Dont say it baby  
Dont say the word that youll regret  
Dont forget  
Im a girl whos learned to take what she can get  
Dont say it baby  
  
Today I could never belong to one boy  
One boy  
And while you wait for tomorrow  
Youll find your heart broken in two  
  
Dont say it baby  
Dont be a fool for anyone  
Have your fun  
Go away  
Live every day while youre young  
Dont say it baby  
  
Go away  
Live every day while youre still young  
Dont say it baby  
You better go away while youre still young  
You gotta live every day now  
While youre still young
