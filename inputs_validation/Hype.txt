Verse 1 Drake  
Yeah I pull up in Lexus like its 07

Boss up Im the bigger homie  
But Im one year older than my lil homie  
09 they was biddin on me  
But Im Young Money got it written on me  
Ok now we got some action  
Everything I said it happened  
That boy light as Michael Jackson

Chasin women a distraction  
They wan be on TV right next to me  
You cannot be here right next to me  
Dont you see Riri right next to me  
I hate a rapper especially  
They feel the same but they hide it  
They just discuss it in private  
Dont get along man we tried it  
Whats the point in even tryin  
I hate a goofy especially  
They always dyin to mention me  
They gotta die out eventually  
I cannot give you the recipe  
You know the game is sold separately  
Swear I just had an epiphany  
It cost me 50 at Tiffanys  
Shout out to Tiffany Stephanie  
They used to always come check for me  
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies  
I dont let it get to me  
  
Hook Drake

Verse 2 Drake  
I dont take this shit for granted  
I do my own propaganda  
I feel like Juelz Santana  
Leg hangin out the Phantom  
6 cold like Alaska  
Views already a classic  
Roy outta here like NASA  
Bustin 1s out the plastic  
Her gram too poppin to fuck her  
The chain too heavy to tuck it Im serious  
I feed my family with this  
So dont play with my money this summer Im serious  
I dont run out of material  
You shouldnt speak on me period  
You try to give em your side of the story  
They heard it but they wasnt hearin it  
They feeling a way and wont hide it  
Niggas done being silent  
Dont get along man we tried it  
Whats the point of even tryin  
I hate a goofy especially  
They always dyin to mention me  
They gotta go they gotta go  
They gonna die out eventually  
I cannot give em no empathy  
Ima have Bs when Im 70  
They cannot fuck with the legacy  
I dont know what else is left for me  
After this no one a threat to me  
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies  
I dont let it get to me
