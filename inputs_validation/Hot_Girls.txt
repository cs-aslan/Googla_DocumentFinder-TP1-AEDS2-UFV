Looking out my window  
At some girl as Im writing this and  
I watch her eat a peach  
The way shes biting it biting it  
And I probably shouldnt stare  
But I am fighting it fighting it  
And I think that shes aware  
And kind of liken it liken it  
  
Hot girls  
They can break me break me  
Hot girls  
You know what your doin now  
Hot girls  
Come and break me break me  
Hot girls  
Take me where you are going  
  
On her motor bike the way  
Shes riding it riding it  
And she says it feels so good  
But now she is hiding it hiding it  
Wet lips to cigarette and now shes  
Striking it lighting it as she  
Looks me in the eye  
Hell she must know shes inviting it  
  
Hot girls they can break me break me  
Hot girls you know what your doin now  
Hot girls come and break me break me  
Hot girls take me where youre goin  
  
I got nothing to prove  
Aint got nothing to loose  
If you need someone to use  
I can take the abuse  
Holding up some paper to her window  
Shes writing her name  
And number and Im laughing  
As Im dialing it dialing it  
I got nothing to prove  
Aint got nothing to loose  
If you need someone to use  
I can take the abuse  
  
Hot girls they can break me break me  
Hot girls you know what youre doin now  
Hot girls come and break me break me  
Hot girls take me where youre goin  
Hot girls they can break me break me  
Hot girls you know what youre doin now  
Hot girls come and break me break me  
Hot girls take me where youre goin  
Hot girls  
Hot girls  
Hot girls
