Ive seen the light  
And Ive seen the flame  
And Ive been this way before  
And Im sure to be this way again  
For Ive been refused  
And Ive been regained  
And Ive seen your eyes before  
And Im sure to see your eyes again  
  
For Ive been released  
And Ive been regained  
And Ive sung my song before  
And Im sure to sing my song again  
  
Some people got to laugh  
Some people got to cry  
Some people got to make it through  
By never wondering why  
  
Some people got to sing  
Some people got to sigh  
Some people never see the light  
Until the day they die  
  
But Ive been released  
And Ive been regained  
And Ive been this way before  
And Im sure to be this way again  
  
One more time again  
Just one more time
