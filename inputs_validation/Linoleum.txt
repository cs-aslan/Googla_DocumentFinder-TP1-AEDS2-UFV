Possessions never meant anything to me  
Im not crazy Cause I got none  
Well thats not true Ive got a bed and a guitar  
And a dog named Bob who pisses on my floor  
Thats right Ive got a floor  
So what so what so what  
  
Ive got pockets full of Kleenex and lint and holes  
Where everything important to me just seems to fall right down my leg  
And on the floor  
My closest friend linoleum  
  
Linoleum  
Supports my head gives me something to believe  
Thats me on the beach side combing the sand  
Metal meter in my hand  
Sporting a pocket full of change  
Thats me on the street with a violin under my chin  
Playing with a grin singing gibberish  
Thats me on the back of the bus  
  
Thats me in the cell  
Thats me inside your head  
Thats me inside your head  
Thats me inside your head
