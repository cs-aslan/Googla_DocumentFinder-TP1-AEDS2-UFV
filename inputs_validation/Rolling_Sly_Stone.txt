I should be on my way  
I really ought not stay  
Far too strong with the pinnup on  
Hear my conscience Im gone  
  
I should have let you know  
This boy was made to roam  
The band is who Im married to  
And this is what God said to do  
  
I let my motor stray  
Forgive me where I play  
Sendin my love to a Tennessee  
She got style now lets see  
  
I remember who  
To surrender to  
The captain of my ship is brave  
Its brothers hood on a Mothers Day  
  
Interlude  
Do do do dit do 4x  
  
Chorus  
I show enough I love you  
I show enough I do  
So just remember who you  
Who you surrender to  
  
Verse 2  
Im off to wonderland  
Just in my second hand  
Life is short but aint it grand  
Im a way outside but in demand  
  
Ill take it on my chin  
Go back and forth again  
Find me on some telephone  
With a broken down voice and a shakeed tone  
  
Do unto others who  
You would have do to you  
Aint no way Id ever trade  
That sparer life for this piece of shade  
  
Destined for battle zone  
Whys there no lesson known  
The lessons not to wait for me  
Unless you got a taste for the bittersweet  
  
Interlude  
Do do do dit do 4x  
  
Chorus  
I show enough I love you  
I show enough I do  
So just remember who you  
Who you surrender to  
  
Bridge  
Let your joy decide  
Let your joy divide  
Everything we do 2x  
  
Let your motor ride  
Let your motor ride  
Everything we do  
  
Ow hit me  
  
Interlude  
Do do do dit do 4x  
  
Chorus  
I show enough I love you  
I show enough I do  
So just remember who you  
Who you surrender to  
  
We could have made it my love  
We could have skated through  
So just remember who you  
Who you surrender to
