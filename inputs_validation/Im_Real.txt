Called you on the phone  
Said Im comin through  
Hope your all alone  
Cause I got plans for you  
  
We could stay at home  
Or dance and hang all night  
As long as Im with you  
Doesnt matter what we do  
  
Dont ask me where Ive been  
Or what Im gonna do  
Just know that Im here with you  
Dont try understand  
Baby theres no mystery  
Cause you know how I am  
  
Chorus  
Im real  
What you get is what you see  
What you tryin to do to me  
You want to say your mine  
Be with me all the time  
Youre falling so in love  
And you just cant get enough  
Youre tellin all your friends  
Shes a bad bad bitch  
  
You like the way I dress  
The way I wear my hair  
Show me off to all your friends  
And baby I dont care  
Just as long as you  
Tell them who I am  
Tell them Im the one who made you give a damn  
  
Dont ask me where Ive been  
Or what Im gonna do  
Just know that Im here with you  
Dont try understand  
Baby theres no mystery  
Cause you know how I am  
  
Chorus
