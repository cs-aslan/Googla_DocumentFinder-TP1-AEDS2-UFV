Dont feel baddont feel good  
Feel alright cause Im doing as I should  
Dont look backno I dont have the time  
I guess Im doing fine  
  
Got no bags to slow me down  
Travelling light but my feet are on the ground  
Got no messageI aint got a dime  
I guess Im doing fine  
  
Dont need no paper telling me bad news  
No politician giving their views  
Dont need no doctor to tell me Im well  
I feel like heaven and Ive been through hell  
  
Talking straight I dont feel confused  
Dont want nothingIve got nothing more to lose  
Dont need no creditdont show me where to sign  
I guess Im doing fine  
I guess Im doing fine  
I guess Im doing fine  
  
Dont come looking for me  
Cause Im doing fine  
No missing persons  
cause Im doing fine  
Dont go home  
cause Im doing fine
