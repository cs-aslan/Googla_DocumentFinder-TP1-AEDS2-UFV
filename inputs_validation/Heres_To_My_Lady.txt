Heres to my lady heres a toast to my lady  
And all that my lady means to me  
Like a hearth in the winter a breeze in the summer  
A spring to remember is she  
  
Though the years may grow colder as people grow older  
Its shoulder to shoulder well be  
But be it sunshine or shady heres my love to my lady  
I pray may she always love me  
  
Though the years may grow colder as people grow older
