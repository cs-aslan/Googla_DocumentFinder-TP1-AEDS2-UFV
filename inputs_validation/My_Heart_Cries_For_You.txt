INTRO  
My heart cries for you  
Sighs for you dies for you  
And my arms long for you  
Please come back to me  
  
If youre in Arizona Ill follow you  
If youre in Minnesota Ill be there too  
Youll have a million chances to start anew  
Because my love is endless for you  
  
My heart cries for you  
Sighs for you dies for you  
And my arms long for you  
Please come back to me  
  
An unimportant quarrel was what we had  
We have to learn to live with the good and bad  
Together we were happy apart were sad  
This loneliness is driving me mad  
  
My heart cries for you  
Sighs for you dies for you  
And my arms long for you  
Please come back to me  
  
Please come back to me  
Please come back come back come back to me
