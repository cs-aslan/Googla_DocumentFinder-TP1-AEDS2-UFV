Let me tell you a story about scary Ned  
Scariest guy to ever wet a bed  
He had hands on his arms and eyes on his head  
But they werent his  
  
Hed go down to the market and try to scare the fish  
He said that they bothered him they werent his favorite dish  
Then hed go down to the highway and pretend that he was dead  
That just the way he was creepy scary Ned  
  
Oh oh Scary Ned  
  
Ned loved Halloween cause he didnt need a mask  
Hed steal the childrens candy he didnt even ask  
Hed sit right down in front of them and then hed start to eat  
Hed tell them they were better off cause that stuff can rot your teeth  
  
Oh oh oh oh Scary Ned  
  
A strange glow would come from his place late into the night  
Hed watch TV til the dawn you know that aint right  
If he started to get tired hed rub sauerkraut on his head  
Thats just the kind of guy he was good old scary Ned  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh Scary Ned  
  
He had a face his mother didnt love  
When people saw on the street they often said Uughh  
Sometimes late at night hed walk alone  
Hed be reciting stuff  
Bad sounding stuff  
Icky awful stuff  
But when you got to know him he werent so bad  
  
Oh oh Scary Ned  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh Scary Ned  
  
Oh oh Scary Ned  
Hes pretty scary  
Scary Ned  
Really scary  
Scary Ned  
Hes scary  
Hence the name  
Scary Ned  
I saw him yesterday  
He said Hi  
I got scared  
Cause hes  
Scary Ned  
If he werent scary

Like Happy Ned  
And who wants to hear a song about
