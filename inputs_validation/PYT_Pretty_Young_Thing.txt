Here did you come from lady  
And ooh wont you take me there  
Right away wont you baby  
Tendoroni youve got to be  
Spark my nature  
Sugar fly with me

We can make it right  
Hit the city lights  
Then tonight ease the lovin pain  
Let me take you to the max  
  
I want to love you PYT  
Pretty young thing  
You need some lovin TLC  
Tender lovin care  
And Ill take you there  
I want to love you PYT  
Pretty young thing  
You need some lovin TLC  
Tender lovin care  
Ill shake you there

Nothin can stop this burnin  
Desire to be with you  
Gotta get to you baby  
Wont you come its emergency  
Cool my fire yearnin
