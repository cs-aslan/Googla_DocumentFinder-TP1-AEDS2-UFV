Slowly but surely though I love you dearly  
Slowly but surely Im losin you  
Soon youll be leavin soon Ill be grievin  
Slowly but surely Im losin you  
I can see it in your eyes I can feel it in your kiss  
But I didnt realise it would all end like this  
Slowly but surely though I love you dearly  
Slowly but surely Im losin you  
  
Somebodys takin my place I can plainly see  
Its written on your face youre not satisfied with me  
Slowly but surely though I love you dearly  
Slowly but surely Im losin you
