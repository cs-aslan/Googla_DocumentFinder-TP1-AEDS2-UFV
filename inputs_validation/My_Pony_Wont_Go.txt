Gotta make your mind up  
Every single day  
I hate to see you lonely  
Losin me this way  
Lookin for the man  
Who stole my love from me  
Gotta know the reason  
Why my babys leavin  
My pony wont go  
Where I want him to go no more  
Gotta make your mind up  
If youre gonna stay  
I dont see no sense in  
Anything you say  
Since you met the guy  
Who told you I was wrong  
You do all the livin  
While I do all the givin  
My pony wont go  
He cant find no oats to eat  
Gotta make your mind up  
Every single day  
I hate to see you lonely  
Losin me this way  
Lookin for the man  
Whole stole my love from me  
Gotta know the reason  
Why my babys leavin  
My pony wont go  
Where I want him to go no more
