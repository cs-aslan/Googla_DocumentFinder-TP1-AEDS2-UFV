A crow and a baby  
Had an affair  
The result was a landslide  
The result was a dare  
The result was a baby  
Who wanted it all  
Moved out of the dolls house  
Moved out of the hall  
  
With one wing on the town and a gleam in an eye of red  
Said my father was a crow now I want all fathers dead  
Find the fathers of this world treat them as a fatal foe  
Put them in the deepest hole then cover the pit with snow  
  
With one wing on the town  
And a gleam in an eye of red  
  
Im just trying to tell you what youll come up against  
If you venture from my side if you think youre so mature  
You will end up in a field you will be someones manure  
Mushrooms growing from your back  
Feeding some damn carrion bird  
Do you want to contribute  
To the corruption of the world  
  
With one wing on the town  
And a gleam in an eye of red  
  
A crow and a baby  
Had an affair  
My dream was the baby  
The crow was your hair  
Parts of me love parts of you  
That at least is obvious  
Give my baby back to me  
You must see its only just  
  
With one wing on the town  
And a gleam in an eye of red  
With one wing on the town  
And a gleam in an eye of red  
With one wing on the town  
And a gleam in an eye of red
