Way back in my memory theres a scene that I recall  
Of a little rundown cabin in the woods  
Where my dad never promised that our blue moon would turn gold  
But he laid awake nights wishin that it would  
  
When the world was on our radio hard work was on our minds  
We lived our daytoday in plain dirt fashion  
With ol overalls and cotton balls all strapped across your back  
Man its hard to make believe there aint nothing wrong  
  
But momma kept the Bible read and daddy kept our family fed  
And somewhere in between I must have grown  
Cause someday I was dreamin that a song that I was singin  
Takes me down the road to where I want to go  
  
Now I know its a long hard road  
  
Sometimes I remember when I stay up late at night  
When the sunup came we got up and went  
In the shadows of a working day our moonlight hours spent  
Singin songs along with grammas radio  
  
Now Im beatin down a ol blacktop road sleepin in a sack  
Livin in my memories all in vain  
cause those city lights aint all that bright compared to what its like  
To see lightning bugs go dancin in the rain  
  
Momma played the guitar then and daddy made the saw blade bend  
And raindrops played the tin roof like a drum  
But I just kept on dreamin that a song that I was singin  
Takes me down the road to where my name is known  
  
Now Im gone and its a long hard road  
Yes I know its a long hard road
