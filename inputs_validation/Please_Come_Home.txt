Spoken it must have been about 100 years at least 100 years I wish
you could come back just come back home  
The day we met feels like 100 years ago  
And Im still waiting with my hand right by the telephone  
Yeah maybe where you are you cannot make that call  
Or you cant find a pen I know its not your fault  
My friends think Im insane cause Ive turned old and gray  
And Im still waiting and I cannot be alone  
Please come home  
Please come home  
I watch the clock hands tick my hours turn to days  
And I cant fall asleep cause I dont want to miss that ring  
I know that this year that your car will park outside  
But I cant put my arms around the girl who took my life  
My friends think Im insane cause Ive turned old and gray  
And Im still waiting and I cannot be alone  
Please come home  
Oooh babyplease come home  
Spoken its been so long its been about 100 years and a million dreams
since the last time I saw your pretty face  
I would do whatever it takes  
I would wait another hundred years and if that didnt work maybe i would try
and see what forever feels like but until then and I Know you hear me and
whatever your doin wherever you are please come home  
The day we met feels like 100 years ago  
And Im still waiting for you  
Baby Baby wont you please come home  
Please come home  
Wont you please come home  
Please come home
