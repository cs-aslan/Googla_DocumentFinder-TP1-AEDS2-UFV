Wake up come down  
The grass hasnt grown too high  
Well ease your body down  
If you want to you can unhook your safety line  
Well ease your body down  
The grass all around us is just green and fine  
  
Weve all been waiting  
Weve been wondering will we ever know the truth  
What its like washing windows  
When you know that there are pigeons on the roof  
  
Your reflections looking clearer  
Now that youre working on a cloudy day  
And those ninthfloor office ladies  
They only hear what your beady little eyes gonna say  
You better wave your hands if you need a breeze  
Better spread real wings if you want to to fly  
Youll remember how to fly tonight in your dreams  
You know youre dreaming  
When theres nothing there worth buying  
  
Weve all been waiting  
Weve been wondering will we ever know the truth  
What its like washing windows  
When you know that there are pigeons on the roof  
  
Wake up leave your body lying there  
Its like another just another wrinkle in the sheets  
Wake up Im gonna poke you if you dont wake up  
You remember how to fly  
  
Weve all been waiting  
Weve been wondering will we ever know the truth  
What its like washing windows  
When you know that there are pigeons on the roof
