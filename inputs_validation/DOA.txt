We was broke and hungry on a summer day  
They sent the sheriff down to try and drive us away  
We was sittin ducks for the police man  
They found a dirty faced kid in a garbage can  
And Im alone Im on the highway wanted dead or alive  
Dead or alive  
Broken down and dirty dressed in rags  
A from the day my mama told me Boy you pack your bags  
Send the mayor down in his pickup truck  
The jury look at me say Outta luck  
And Im alone Im on the highway wanted dead or alive  
Dead or alive  
Now Im broken down and dirty dressed in rags  
A from the day my mama told me Boy you pack your bags  
We was sittin ducks for the police man  
They found a dirty faced kid in a garbage can  
And Im alone Im on the highway wanted dead or alive  
Dead or alive
