Somebody get your praise on  
  
There is one thing that I know for sure  
How much I love You yet You love me more  
You paid my debt a price I could not pay  
So I will praise You each and every day  
  
Im not gonna hold back now  
I think its time to just get up  
And jump around now  
  
Everybody jump around  
In the house of God  
Hey hey jump around  
Everybdy jump around  
In the house of God  
Everybody  
  
When I say Jesus  
You say praise him  
Jesus praise Him  
Jesus praise Him  
  
There is one thing that I cant ignore  
The power of praising You in one accord  
Our praise goes up the walls come down  
Listen up people I can hear that sound  
  
Praise Him jump jump  
Come on praise Him jump jump  
Praise Him jump jump  
Somebody get your praise on  
  
Somebody get your  
Somesomebody get your praise on
