Hold me Let me dry those tears for you  
Be the healer Of your heart he broke in two  
I wanna hold you close  
But somethin tells me to wait  
Is it too soon to touch  
To reach for the love that you hide away  
Talk to me Tell me with your eyes  
What did he do To make you feel this way inside  
  
Chorus  
  
Empty words and promises made  
Im not that way  
Come to me and dont be afraid  
Im not that way  
  
Silence Was meant to be broken  
Like waves on the shore  
Let your tears wash away these emotions  
I cant change the world  
I can change your mind  
Ill always be here for you until you realize  
  
Empty words and promises made  
Im not that way  
Broken trust A failure in faith  
Im not that way  
Im not that way  
  
Cause lifes too short for waistin  
Waistin precious time  
If time is what you need baby  
Ill give you all of mine  
One day youre gonna look at me  
And love is what youll find  
  
Empty words and promises made  
Im not that way  
Come to me  
Bring back your faith  
Dont be afraid  
Im not that way  
Im not that way  
  
I want to hold you  
I want to hold you close  
Let me hear your heart baby
