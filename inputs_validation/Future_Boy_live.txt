Well the future boy where are you from  
My time machine crashed over yonder  
Syphillis is a bitch but contracting hiv is much worse  
Why are you pushing info into me  
I have no need for it  
Im from the stars  
  
Well I thought youd like to know your scoop  
Im taking babies back with me yeah  
Im taking them back home  
So they can see theres a much better place  
  
Ive got a sister with an open mind  
And my friends are all junkies  
But there still my friends  
  
Well as long as they dont use monkeys  
We enjoy the heat the stolen days in this winter of thosand three  
  
Well the future boy said Ive got friends  
But you know sometimes it all depends  
On how tall they are against yourself  
  
Well I am the future boy  
I am the future boy  
I am the future boy  
I am the future boy  
I am the future boy  
I am the future boy  
I am the future boy  
I am the future boy  
Find your way home  
  
Well my friends have all gone and left me  
So I decided to come here and see  
Myself as a baby  
But it looks like Im stuck here this time  
Oh shit  
Im gonna miss my friends  
But I know youre still the future boy  
Yes Im still the future boy  
Im gonna build you a time machine to get back home  
Youre still the future boy  
Still the future boy  
Still the future boy  
Well Im still the future boy  
Oh this whole damn world is your toy boy  
So get back on tour boy  
And find your way home
