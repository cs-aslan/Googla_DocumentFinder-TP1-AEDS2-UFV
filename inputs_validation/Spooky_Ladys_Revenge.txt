Looky here whos in focus now  
Hard and clear to the bone  
No more fears that youd notice now  
Like a tear cast in stone  
And she comes from a spring to a fountain  
On the wings of her song  
Shes the king of the mountain  
Shes so good Lord and shes gone  
Cause shes a starsee her shining  
Shell go far for a price  
But shes hard in the heart like a diamond  
Flashin firecold as ice  
Chorus  
Cause shes a starsee her shining  
Shell go far for a price  
But shes hard in the heart like a diamond  
Flashin firecold as ice
