Loud talk  
Dumb love  
Lacerator  
Come and touch  
  
Bleed to feel  
Feel to fuck  
Keep ya comin  
Keep ya comin back for more  
  
Alcohol  
Its a lie  
Stimulate  
A needle in your eye  
  
Let it bleed  
Blow your mind  
Touched myself  
Nearly went blind  
  
Chorus  
Couldnt find a way  
To live through the pain  
Couldnt find a way  
Dumb love  
Couldnt find a way  
To win the raace  
Couldnt find a way  
Dumb love  
  
Couldnt get  
Outta bed  
Ten ton bricks  
Layin on my head  
  
Persecute  
The crucified  
Kill a man  
For losing his mind  
  
Chorus  
  
Come on out  
Youre comin home  
Deceive yourself  
Youre all alone Repeat x4  
  
Chorus  
  
Come on out  
Youre comin home  
Deceive yourself  
Youre all alone Repeat x4
