When they see me off in traffic they say Jeezy on some other shit  
Send them pussy niggas runnin straight back to the dealership  
Me Im in my spaceship thats right I work for Nasa  
This 7H is not a fraud call that bitch my bodyguard  
Call that bitch your bodyguard Yeah thats my bodyguard  
Wear a lot of jewelry Young dont do security  
Whats whiter than a napkin harder than a dinner plate  
If you want it come and get it you know I stay super straight  
Ran up in my spots and now Im workin Out the Super 8  
Know you niggas hungry come and get a super plate  
Yall sing happy birthday yeah I got that super cake  
Hundred karat bracelet I use it like some super bait  
  
Chorus x2  
I put on for my city on on for my city  
I put on for my city on on for my city  
Put on east side Put on south side Put on west side Put on  
  
Verse 2 Young Jeezy  
Half bag top back  
Aint nothin but a young thug  
HKs AKs I need to join a gun club  
Big wheels big straps  
You know I like it super sized  
Passengers a redbone  
Her Weave look like some curly fries  
Inside fish sticks outside tartar sauce  
Pocket full of celery  
Imagine what she tellin me  
Blowin on asparagus  
The realest shit I ever smoked  
Ridin to that Trap or Die  
The realest shit I ever wrote  
They know I got that broccoli  
So I keep that glock on me  
Dont get caught without one  
Comin from where Im from  
Call me Jeezy Hamilton  
Flyin down Campbellton  
So fresh so clean  
On my way to Charlene  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I put on I put on I put on  
I put on for my city I put on for my  
I put on for my city I put on for my city on  
  
I feel like theres still niggas that owe me checks  
I feel like theres still bitches that owe me sex  
I feel like this but niggas dont know the stress  
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best  
I got the money and the fame and that dont mean shit  
I got the Jesus on a chain man that dont mean shit  
Cause when the Jesus pieces cant bring me peace  
Sure I need just at least one of Russells nieces on  
I let my nightmares go I put on  
Everybody that I knew from the go  
I know hoes that was frontin when they knew he was broke  
They say damn Yeezy Yeezy you dont know us no more  
You got that big fame homie and you just changed on me  
You can ask big homie man the top so lonely  
I aint lyin so lonely I aint lyin  
Let me see what we have tonight what we have tonight  
Im high as a satellite satellite  
I see those flashin lights flashin lights  
Cause every night every night I put on  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Let me see what we have tonight what we have tonight  
Im high as a satellite satellite  
I see those flashin lights flashin lights  
Cause every night every night  
Let me see what we have tonight  
Im high as a satellite  
I see those flashin lights
