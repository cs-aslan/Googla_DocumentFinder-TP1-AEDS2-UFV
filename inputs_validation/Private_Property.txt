You think youre cool and got it all  
You think you run the scene  
I dont believe how youd conceive  
That your good enough for me  
You think youve got it all sewn up  
But Ill cut you right down to size  
The way I figure you dont exist  
So youd better realize  
  
Dont you touch  
Dont get near  
Dont take me for a fool  
Make no mistake  
No give and take  
Im too good for you  
  
So keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off me  
Hands off  
Keep your hands off me  
  
Im number one when I turn it on  
Do you think you can relate  
Youd be amazed left in a daze  
To see me operate  
  
Dont you touch  
Dont get near  
Dont take me for a fool  
Make no mistake  
No give and take  
Im too good for you  
  
So keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
  
You live in a fantasy  
I dont even care  
If youre lookin for sympathy  
It aint there  
  
Hands off  
Keep your dirty hands off me  
  
So keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Hands off
