even if it make you want to stop and stare youd be better off it you were
unaware everybody wants to see that its not them focused and unaffected
youll get what you expected youre boring and predictable doesnt everybody
want to get their hands on everything that they desire i know youre not
afraid and i know exactly what you want to be even still you want to take what
you cant get youd be better off if you could just forget there isnt anyone
who lives without regret so it seems to be that no one really cares and so the
struggle to achieve the lions share and i know what you are im not what you
are
