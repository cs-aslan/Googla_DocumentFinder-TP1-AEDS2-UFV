You didnt know I wasnt free  
When you fell in love with me  
And with all your young heart  
You learned to care  
  
It brought you shame and disgrace  
The world has tumbled in your face  
Because they call our love  
A back street affair  
  
They say you wrecked my home  
Im a husband thats gone wrong  
They dont know the sorrow  
That we had to bear  
  
While the one I was tied to  
Was the first to be untrue  
How can they call our love  
A back street affair  
  
Well we have each other now  
Thats all that matters anyhow  
While the judgment  
Of gossips never fair  
  
Well just be brave and strong  
Then someday theyll see theyre wrong  
So let them call our love  
A back street affair  
  
Well be free to love someday  
When all the talk has died away  
And the happiness we hoped for  
Then well share  
  
And Ill climb a mountain high  
And the world will hear me cry  
That our love is not  
A backstreet affair
