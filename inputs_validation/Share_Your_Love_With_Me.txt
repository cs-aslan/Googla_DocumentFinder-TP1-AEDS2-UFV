Its an ill wind that blows no good  
And its a sad heart that wont love like it should  
Oh how lonesome you must be  
And its a shame  
If you dont share your love with me  
  
Its a heartache when love is gone  
And it can get even worse if it keeps on  
Blinder than he who wont see  
And its a shame  
If you dont share your love with me  
  
I cant help it  
If he she is gone  
You must try to forget  
You must live on  
Its a good thing to love someone  
But its bad and even sad  
When its not returned  
Oh how lonesome you must be  
And its a shame  
If you dont share your love with me  
And I said its a shame  
If you dont share your love with me
