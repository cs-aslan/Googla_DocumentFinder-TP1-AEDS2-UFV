Ive got a delicate mind  
Ive got a dangerous nature  
And my fist collides  
With your furniture  
Ive got a delicate mind  
Ive got a dangerous nature  
And my fist collides  
With your furniture  
Im an electric wire  
And Im stuck inside your head  
Im a hungry Mohican  
Ive got a razor blade smile  
So dont come near me  
Ive got a singular style  
Fifteen senses  
Are on my plate  
All the things  
That you love to hate  
Im an electric wire  
Im stuck inside your head  
Where I go to no one knows  
Find me where the cold wind blows  
Where I go to no one knows  
Find me where the cold wind blows  
Regrets  
Ive got a delicate mind  
Regrets  
Ive got a dangerous nature  
And my fist collides  
Regrets  
With your furniture  
Regrets  
Ive got a delicate mind  
Ive got a dangerous  
And my fist collides  
With your furniture  
Regrets  
Im an electric wire  
Im an electric wire  
Im an electric wire  
Regrets  
Regrets  
Regrets  
Black is red and red is white  
In this country I do what I like  
Regrets  
I said Black is red  
Regrets  
Regrets  
Do what I like  
Regrets  
Thats right thats right thats right  
Regrets  
Regrets  
Red is white  
Regrets  
Regrets
