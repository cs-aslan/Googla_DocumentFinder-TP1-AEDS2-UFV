When you move in right up close to me  
Thats when I get the shakes all over me  
Quivers down my back bone  
Ive got the shakes down the kneebone Yeah  
The tremors in the thighbone  
Shakin all over  
  
Just the way you say goodnight to me  
Brings that feeling on inside of me  
Quivers down my back bone  
Ive got the shakes down the kneebone Yeah  
The tremors in the thighbone  
Shakin all over  
  
Well you make me shake and I like it baby  
Well you make me shake and I like it baby  
Well you make me shake and I like it baby  
Well you make me shake and I like it baby  
Well you make me shake and I like it baby  
Well you make me shake and I like it baby
