Oh Say can you see  
By the dawns early light  
What so proudly we hailed  
At the twilights last gleaming  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars  
Thru the perilous flight  
Oer the ramparts we watched  
Were so gallantly streaming  
And the rockets red glare  
The bombs bursting in air  
Gave proof thro the night  
That our flag was still there  
Oh Say does that star spangled banner  
Yet wave  
Oer the land of the free  
And the home of the brave
