Break out the whiskey and a bottle of wine  
Take your shirt off bitch and chop me out a line  
Dim the lights down low turn up the stereo  
Dont say a word I already know  
  
Youve never done this before but you feel like tryin tryin tryin

Ive done this plenty of times and I know youre liein you know I know  
Hey hey  
  
You want a shot so I will take aim  
Dont even ask me if I know your name say my name  
Dont look so shocked do not be confused  
I just want to shoot your soul full of rhythm and blues  
  
Them boys been sellin your lines but you aint been buyin buyin  
But what Im givin is free so its well worth tryin  
  
Because I know you like to rock n roll  
You like to rock n roll

Its human nature to be what weve all been denyin
