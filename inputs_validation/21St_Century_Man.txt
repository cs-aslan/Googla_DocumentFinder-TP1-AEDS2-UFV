A penny in your pocket  
Suitcase in your hand  
They wont get you very far  
Now youre a 21st century man  
  
Fly across the city  
Rise above the land  
You can do most anything  
Now youre a 21st century man  
  
Though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow  
You still wander the fields of your sorrow  
  
One day youre a hero  
Next day youre a clown  
Theres nothing that is in between  
Now youre a 21st century man  
  
You should be so happy  
You should be so glad  
So why are you so lonely  
You 21st century man  
  
You stepped out of a dream believing  
Everything was gone  
Return with what youve learned  
Theyll kiss the ground you walk upon  
  
Things aint how you thought they were  
Nothing have you planned  
So pick up your penny and your suitcase  
Youre not a 21st century man  
  
Though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow  
You still wander the fields of your sorrow  
21st century man
