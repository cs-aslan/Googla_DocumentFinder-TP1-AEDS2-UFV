Ive been struggling up here child trying to make a living  
Everybody wants to take nobody like giving  
I wish I was in Memphis back home there with my Mama  
The only clothes I got left that aint rags is my pajamas  
No brotherly love no help no danger  
Just a great big town full of cold hearted strangers  
I went hungry in New York and Chicago was no better  
But today my dear mother wrote and told me in her letter  
Son come back to Memphis and live here with your Mama  
You can walk down Beale Street honey wearing your pajamas  
You know home folks here we let do just what you want to  
And I born you and raised you right here on the corner  
Im going to leave here in the morning and walk down to the station  
Ive got just enough money to pay my transportation  
Im going back to Memphis back home with my Mama  
If I have to ride that bus barefooted in pajamas  
Back home in Memphis no moaning and groaning  
I know everything will be all right in the morning
