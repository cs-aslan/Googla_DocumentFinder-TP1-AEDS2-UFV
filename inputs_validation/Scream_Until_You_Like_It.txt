Scream until you like it  
  
Come on in ha ha ha  
  
Come on in no this aint no dream  
Better hold on tight things aint what they seem no no no  
Dont be afraid if your hearts burning ready to go  
Well I love it when I scare you so  
From your head down to your oh  
  
Scream until ya like it  
Never gonna stop  
Scream until ya like it  
Get ready to rock  
Scream until ya like it  
Never gonna stop  
Scream until ya like it  
  
Im sending out little boys to play  
You know a trick like that could really make my day ha ha ha  
My little killers are ready to take you away  
Well I love it when I scare ya so  
From your head down to your oh  
  
Scream until ya like it  
Never gonna stop  
Scream until ya like it  
Get ready to rock  
Scream until ya like it  
Never gonna stop  
Scream until ya like it  
  
Come on in no this aint no dream  
Better hold on tight things aint what they seem no no no  
Dont be afraid if your hearts burning ready to go  
Well I love it when I scare you so  
From your head down to your oh  
  
Scream until ya like it  
Never gonna stop  
Scream until ya like it  
Get ready to rock  
Scream until ya like it  
Never gonna stop  
Scream until ya like it
