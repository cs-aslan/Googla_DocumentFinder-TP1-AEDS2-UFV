When superstars and cannonballs are running through your head  
And television freak show cops and robbers everywhere  
Subway makes me nervous people pushing me too far  
Ive got to break away  
So take my hand now  
Cause I want to live like animals  
Careless and free like animals  
I want to live  
I want to run through the jungle  
With wind in my hair and the sand at my feet  
Ive been having difficulties keeping to myself  
Feelings and emotions better left up on the shelf  
Animals and children tell the truth they never lie  
Which one is more human  
Theres a thought now you decide  
Compassion in the jungle  
Compassion in your hands yeah  
Would you like to make a run for it  
Would you like to take my hand yeah  
Sometimes this life can get you down  
Its so confusing  
Theres so many rules to follow  
And I feel it  
Cause I just run away in my mind  
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
Superstars and cannonballs running through your head  
Television freak show cops and robbers everywhere  
Animals and children tell the truth they never lie  
Which one is more human  
Theres a thought now you decide  
Compassion in the jungle  
Compassion in your hands yeah  
Would you like to make a run for it  
Would you like to take my hand yeah
