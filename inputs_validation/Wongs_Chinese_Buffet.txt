Im feeling hungry empty tummy and I want to make it full  
So I spend the day at Wongs buffet and I eat till I explode  
  
Theres sixty types of Oriental delights I gotta have them all  
Chicken wings and onion rings and sweet and sour balls  
  
At Wongs come and sail with me  
At Wongs on the sea of gluttony  
At Wongs eat until it hurts  
But dont forget theres pudding for dessert  
  
The chickens tough the noodles are rough  
And the chow meins three days old  
But its quantity not quality that has got my soul  
  
So fill that plate no mistake theres no holding back  
I wont stop until I got a packed digestive tract  
  
A Wongs no meal is a loss  
At Wongs covered in red sauce  
At Wongs everything is battered  
And whats inside doesnt even matter  
  
Stop Oh Second plate Huh Third plate Oh  
Fourth plate Oh Dessert Ug  
Fortune cookie I ate the fortune  
  
I try to leave I want to heave my whole body hurts  
Can barely stand I tell you man I got my moneys worth  
  
If I get the time Im going to go to China  
And eat at their ancient buffets  
But Im wonderin how they stay so thin  
Eating like this every day  
  
At Wongs give chopsticks a try  
At Wongs to pick up your french fry  
At Wongs you know Im coming back  
Eating heres worth the heart attack  
Wongs Chinese Buffet
