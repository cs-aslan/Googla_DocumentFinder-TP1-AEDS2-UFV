Take along some of your favorite things  
Cause youre gonna need em  
Wait right here  
Wait til I come back around  
You and I will go  
Well just sit and watch it all go down  
Down Down  
  
I was fakin  
While you waited for change to come  
I lied when I said I couldnt stay here anymore  
When you and I just cant seem to get along  
You and I both know  
Well just wait until it all calms down  
Down Down  
Down Down  
Down Down  
  
Careful of the things you want to say  
Cause youre gonna mean em  
Break my pride  
My backbone is feelin strong  
You and I both know  
What we hold would never pull it down  
Down Down  
Down Down  
Down Down  
  
Take along some of your favorite things  
Cause youre gonna need em
