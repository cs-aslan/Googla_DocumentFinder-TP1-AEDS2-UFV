Lookin like another Bob Marley day  
Hittin from the bong like a diesel train  
And Im down with hanging out this afternoon  
  
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall  
Cheech and Chong probably would of smoked em all  
So Im out on the couch this afternoon  
  
Beer bottles layin on the kitchen floor  
If we take em all back we can buy some more  
So I doubt well go without this afternoon  
  
You better hang on if your taggin along  
Cause well be doin this till six in the mornin  
Nothin wrong with goin all night long  
Just not tough to put the brakes on  
Doesnt matter when youd rather  
Get up and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Just sitting around hangin out this afternoon  
  
Landlord says I should buy a tent  
But he can kiss my ass cause I paid the rent  
So I doubt hell kick me out this afternoon  
  
Down on the corner in a seedy bar  
Jukebox crankin out the CCR  
Had a few to Suzy Q this afternoon  
  
You better hang on if your taggin along  
Cause well be doin this till six in the mornin  
Nothin wrong with goin all night long  
Just not tough to put the brakes on  
Doesnt matter when youd rather  
Get up and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Yeah we get up and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
Yeah just sitting around hanging out this afternoon  
  
Dont wanna wristwatch or an alarm clock  
To see what time it is  
From the moment I wake up  
I just love being with my friends  
We barely get by but have the best times  
And hope it never ends  
We drink all day until we fall down  
So we can do it all again  
  
Its not the human walk  
Its the human race  
If you aint livin on edge  
Youre takin too much space  
So I doubt Ill figure out  
Just what to do  
Bout to kick it around  
Hanging out this afternoon  
  
You better hang on if your taggin along  
Cause well be doin this till six in the mornin  
Nothin wrong with goin all night long  
Just not tough to put the brakes on  
Doesnt matter when youd rather  
Get up and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Yeah we get up and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
Just sitting around  
Get up and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Just kicking around hanging out this afternoon  
Sitting around hanging out this afternoon  
Just kicking around hanging out this afternoon  
Just sitting around hanging out this afternoon  
Just sitting around hanging out this afternoon  
Just sitting around hanging out this afternoon
