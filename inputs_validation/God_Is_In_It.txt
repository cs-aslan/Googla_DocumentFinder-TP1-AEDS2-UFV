There are two roads  
How will I know  
Sometimes the right direction is something I cant see  
I hear the wind blow  
And I can feel it  
But I know my emotions can play a trick on me  
My heart wants to tell me your heart wants to tell me  
  
Chorus  
If its got love  
If its got peace  
Thats the only way that I can believe it  
If it leads me to the light  
If its got joy  
If its got truth  
Something thats gonna take a little faith to do  
To make the pieces fit  
God is in it  
God is in it  
What Im hearing  
Sounds convincing  
Its hard to decipher if all the words are real  
I am learning  
To be discerning  
Is this conversation something Hes revealed  
We need to define  
If its something divine  
  
Chorus  
Whatevers lovely  
Whatevers pure  
Whatevers from His Word will endure  
Youll know its right  
Youll see the signs  
  
Chorus
