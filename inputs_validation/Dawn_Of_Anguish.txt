Day breaks  
  
Enjolras  
The people have not stirred  
We are abandoned by those who still live in fear  
The people have not heard  
Yet will will not abandon those who cannot hear  
Let us not waste lives  
Let all the women and fathers of children  
Go from here  
  
Feuilly  
Drink with me to days gone by  
Sing with me the songs we knew  
  
All  
At the shrine of friendship  
Raise your glass high  
Let the wine of friendship  
Never run dry  
If I die  
I die with you  
  
So never kick a dog  
Because hes just a pup  
Well fight like twenty armies  
And we wont give up  
So youd better run for cover  
When the pup grows  
  
He dies
