I only go where Im wanted  
You go only where you want  
I aim to be more like you  
There is a ghost in my house  
Rattling handles on every door  
Show us an open window or two  
Would you Oh woah  
  
Doors are starting to close  
And you drew a rose my my  
Your mind it is original oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Youre skeleton key opening me  
My my your mind it is original  
Girl youre the original  
Always were and always will be  
  
The flowers of adaptation  
Unfold and lovingly alarm  
You effortlessly ring that bell  
Your stripes are yours and yours only  
The bow ideal of rare birds  
And now I am under your spell  
Oh woah under your spell  
  
Doors are starting to close  
And you drew a rose my my  
Your mind it is original oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Youre skeleton key opening me  
My my your mind it is original  
Girl youre the original  
  
Repeat x5  
Always were  
  
And will be  
  
Doors are starting to close  
And you drew a rose my my  
Your mind it is original oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Youre skeleton key opening me  
My my your mind it is original  
Girl the original  
Always were always will be
