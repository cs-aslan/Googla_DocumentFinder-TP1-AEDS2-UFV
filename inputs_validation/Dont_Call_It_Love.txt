Nobody believes that I really care for you  
They dont think my heart is true  
I dont think you agree  
You know Im a lifetime guarantee  
So if they ask you what you mean to me  
  
Dont call it love  
Heavens above  
We got a better thing mmm  
Dont call it love  
That aint enough  
Just tell them youre my everything  
  
Nobody believes we got something they aint got  
Theyve never seen a fire this hot  
They never got that far  
Burning as bright as any star  
So if they asked you what your feelings are  
  
Dont call it love  
Heavens above  
We got a better thing  
So dont call it love  
That aint enough  
Just tell them youre my everything  
  
Feels so good  
Holding tight  
Through the night  
Ah but they can call it what they like  
But they aint got it right no no no  
  
So dont call it love  
Heavens above  
We got a better thing  
  
Dont call it love  
That aint enough  
Just tell them youre my everything baby please  
  
Dont call it love  
Heavens above  
We got a better thing yes we do baby  
  
Dont call it love  
Heavens above  
We got a better thing  
  
Dont call it love  
That aint enough  
Ooh ooh  
Dont call it love ooh ooh  
Got a better thing
