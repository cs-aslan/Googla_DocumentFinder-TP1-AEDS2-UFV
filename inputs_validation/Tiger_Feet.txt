Yeah yeah  
  
All night long youve been looking at me  
Well you know youre the dance hall cutie that you love to be  
Oh well now youve been laying it down  
Youve got your hips swinging out of bounds  
And I like the way you do what youre doin to me

Thats neat thats neat thats neat thats neat I really love your tiger
