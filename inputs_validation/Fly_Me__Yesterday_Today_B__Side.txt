Fly me  my hands are free  
Wont you fly me  
  
Look towards what youre dreaming of  
Write it down and look above  
For something that will tell you I watch you  
Im looking for to do  
  
Wont you fly me  my hands are  
Wont you fly me  
  
Picture floating in a silent row  
Crying out for those whove never learnt  
That life is just a story you pass through  
While dreaming what to do  
  
Wont you fly me  
Wont you please fly me  
Wont you please fly me  
  
Wont you fly me
