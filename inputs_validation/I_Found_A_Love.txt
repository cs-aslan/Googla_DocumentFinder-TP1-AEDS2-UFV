What would you do if I told you that Im falling in love again  
I found a love that will hold my hand and baby she understands  
A way to make my heart beat faster  
Is this heaven were living in  
A way to make my life worth living  
Ive fallen in love again  
  
Ive got to ask you now baby  
What would you say if I told you that Im falling in love again  
I found a love that will hold my hand and baby she understands  
A way to make my heart beat faster  
Is this heaven were living in  
A way to make my life worth living  
Ive fallen in love again  
  
Ive got to ask you now baby  
What would you say if I told you that Im falling in love again  
I found a love that will hold my hand and baby she understands  
A way to make my heart beat faster  
Is this heaven were living in  
A way to make my life worth living  
Ive fallen in love again
