Ill never love again  
I would ever have to pretend  
I would never love again damn  
  
I dont even wanna have to try  
Draw a line  
Never flies  
I dont even wanna have to die  
But deep inside  
The dead rehearse  
And I never wanna clarify  
And justify  
So I run and hide  
And I never wanna sleep my fights  
So I crucified  
All my hate inside  
  
No  
Ill never love again no  
I will ever have to pretend no  
Ill never gonna love again  
Never gonna have to try to pretend  
Never never never  
  
I dont never wanna satisfy  
Cause its inside  
Ill do it fine  
I dont never wanna multiply  
Cause deep inside  
Im not qualified  
And I never wanna clarify  
And justify  
So I run and hide  
And I never wanna sleep the fight  
So I classify  
All my hate inside  
  
No  
Ill never love again no  
I will ever have to pretend no  
Ill never gonna love again  
Never gonna have to try to pretend  
Never never never  
Ill never love again  
I will never gonna love again  
  
Never never  
  
No  
Ill never love again  
I will ever have to pretend  
Ill never gonna love again  
Never gonna have to try to pretend  
Never never never  
No never never never  
No never never never  
No Ill never gonna love again  
Never gonna have to try to pretend  
Never never never
