I got a brand new companion  
Man Im gonna do my best this time  
I got a brand new companion  
Man Im gonna do my best this time  
You know she cools me with her breathin  
Chases away those howlin bottles of wine  
  
She fits just like my guitar  
Man shes near as tall as me  
She fits just like my guitar  
Shes near as tall as me  
She lives way out the D train  
But shes Texas as can be  
  
She got a homespun disposition  
Man shes just as gentle as you please  
She got a homespun disposition  
Man shes just as gentle as you please  
She got arms just like two rattle snakes  
Legs just like a billow in the breeze  
  
I got a brand new companion  
Man Im gonna do my best this time  
I got a brand new companion  
Man Im gonna do my best this time  
I want to trace her with my body  
I want to track her with my mind
