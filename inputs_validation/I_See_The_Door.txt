LightI see the light  
Youre there on my floor  
Youre there on my floor  
Flyangel fly  
Youre out of sight  
Youre out of sight  
She came in a dream Lord  
No way to describe it  
It was in my head  
I burn but I dont scream  
No way to describe it  
It is in my head  
I have seen things that I cant explain  
Looking in through that window pane  
Open your eyes and let me in  
Dont go to think that I dont care  
SoI see the door  
I see the door  
I see the door  
It came in a dream Lord  
No way to describe it  
It was in my head  
Whats life without a scream lover  
No way to describe it  
It was in my head  
I have seen things that I cant explain  
Looking through windows feeling the same  
I have seen moments Id like to share  
Scared that you dont want me there  
My lover  
Scared that you dont want me there  
My lover  
Its a battle its a battle
