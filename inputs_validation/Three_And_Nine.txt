You might remember  
How it used to be  
3 and 9 could show you  
Any fantasy  
Particoloured pictures  
Now and then 3D  
No cheap nostalgia  
Conjured up by me  
Back to the old days  
Close to home  
Show me some new ways  
Ill carry on  
  
Whether making out or played out  
Three and nine make twelve  
Ive a dozen reasons  
Lying on the shelf  
be feature back rows  
Filed away  
No point pretending  
Change is here to stay  
  
3 and 9 to 45  
Decimal romance  
If youve warmed to centigrade  
You stand a sporting chance  
Im not so special  
Youre a misfit too  
  
Why must they interfere  
In everything we do  
Should we play safe now  
Or go all the way  
Six and two threes now  
More I cannot say
