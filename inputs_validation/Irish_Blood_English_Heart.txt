Irish blood English heart  
This Im made off  
There is no one on earth Im afraid of  
And no regime can buy or sell me  
  
Ive been dreaming of a time when  
To be English is not to be baneful  
To be standing by the flag not feeling shameful  
Racist or racial  
  
Irish blood English heart  
This Im made of  
There is no one on earth Im afraid of  
And I will die with both of my hands untied  
  
Ive been dreaming of a time when  
The English are sick to death of Labor and Tories  
And spit upon the name Oliver Cromwell  
And denounce this royal line that still salute him  
And will salute him  
Forever
