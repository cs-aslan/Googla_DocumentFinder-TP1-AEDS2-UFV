Lately Im feeling glad Im alive  
Cause when Im with you  
You make me feel so good inside  
Lately its only you on my mind  
And I have to smile when I think of you  
Knowing that you are mine  
You are mine you are mine  
  
Ooh baby back in love again  
Ooh baby next to you again  
Ooh baby in a crazy spin love  
I want ya I need ya I love ya I want ya  
Ooh baby back in love again  
Ooh baby next to you again  
Ooh baby in a crazy spin love  
I want ya I need ya I love ya I want ya

It feels so right it cant be wrong  
I know this love is real  
Baby Ill show you what I feel inside  
Its lasted so long loves growing strong  
Loves growing stronger now  
Stronger now stronger now  
  
Ooh baby back in love again  
Ooh baby next to you again  
Ooh baby in a crazy spin love

Ooh baby in a crazy spin love

Ooh baby in a crazy spin love
