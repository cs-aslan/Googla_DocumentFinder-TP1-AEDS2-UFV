Set me on my destination  
Point me the way to my position  
Whats the meaning of my mission  
I have made my decision clear  
  
I dont need another reason  
I dont want anymore prime time  
I have made my decision  
Not for the first but for the last time  
  
Im setting on slow  
Im building it up  
Im letting it go  
The pressure will blow on time  
  
I dont want another story  
You can place it with your nursery rhymes  
I dont want to take the glory  
Why dont you and him take it this time  
  
I dont need another reason  
I cant make another plan  
I know youre both in secret liaison  
So we must go our separate ways  
  
Im setting on slow  
Im building it up  
Im letting it go  
The pressure will blow on time  
  
So Ill keep pushing my position  
Till the pressure builds it well  
But I keep pressing your decision  
Till youve made your mind up as well  
  
I cant take another season  
I cant make another play  
I know youre in secret liaison  
So we must go our separate ways  
  
Im setting on slow  
Im building it up  
Im letting it go  
The pressure will blow on time
