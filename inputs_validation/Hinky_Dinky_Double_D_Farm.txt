Oh its beans beans beans that make you feel so mean  
On the farm on the farm  
Oh its beans beans beans that make you feel so mean  
On the Hinky Dinky Double D farm

Oh its corn corn corn that make you feel forlorn  
On the farm on the farm  
Oh its corn corn corn that make you feel forlorn  
On the Hinky Dinky Double D farm  
  
Mine eyes are dim I cannot see  
I have not brought my specs with me

Oh its meat meat meat that knocks you off your feet  
On the farm on the farm  
Oh its meat meat meat that knocks you off your feet

Oh its pie pie pie that makes you want to cry  
On the farm on the farm  
Oh its pie pie pie that makes you want to cry  
On the Hinky Dinky Double D farm
