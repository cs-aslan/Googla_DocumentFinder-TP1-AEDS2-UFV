Whyd you never listen to me  
I could be invisible to you  
Anyway it doesnt matter now  
cause I have met somebody new  
Sorry if your heart is broken  
Whys your mouth just hanging open  
Dont look so surprised  
I found another guy  
Terry wants my photograph  
Terry says our love will last forever  
And he should know  
That boy terrys not the kind  
To mess around and change his mind  
Terry is as tough as marlon brando  
Now hes waiting for me  
I just had to break the news to you  
Youd better hide your face a while  
If he gets mad theres no telling what hell do  
You can see the door is open  
So if you dont want your nose broken  
You had better go away  
cause terrys coming round today  
Terry wants my photograph  
Terry says our love will last forever  
And he should know  
terry said hell never let me go  
That boy terrys not the kind  
To mess around and change his mind  
Terry is as tough as marlon brando  
Hes been making eyes at me  
It started long ago  
So when he said he loved me  
I just had to say I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I
know I know I know  
You thought you were such a smartie  
But terry knows about karate  
Theres other things hes good at too  
Terrys not a bit like you  
And terry wants my photograph  
Terry says our love will last forever  
And he should know  
terry said hell never let me go  
That boy terrys not the kind  
To mess around and change his mind  
Terry is as tough as marlon brando
