I read about a man to whom I may be related  
Leatherman  
Died a long time ago in the 1880s  
Leatherman Leatherman  
  
Covered with leather but it wasnt tight  
Underneath the moon in the woods at night  
  
Making the rounds ten miles a day  
Once a month they spot him  
Heres what they say  
  
Here he comes hes a man of the land  
Hes Leatherman  
Smile on his face  
Axe in his pack  
Hes Leatherman Leatherman Leatherman  
  
Comes out of the caves once a day to be fed  
He wasnt known to say much  
But Thanks for the bread  
  
So modern day I walk my way my jacket faded  
Just like a man of leather to whom I may be related  
  
Rolled a cigarette for which he asked for a light  
Appeared to be an animal yet so polite  
  
Making the rounds ten miles a day  
Once a month they spot him  
Heres what they say  
  
Here he comes hes a man of the land  
Hes Leatherman  
Smile on his face  
Axe in his pack  
Hes Leatherman Leatherman Leatherman  
Hes Leatherman Leatherman  
  
Shakes his head hes Leatherman  
Bake some bread hes Leatherman  
Shame hes dead  
I saw his bed  
Its all thats left of Leatherman  
Leatherman  
Give me some skin Leatherman
