Im gonna be blue in the morning  
Im gonna be blue in the morning  
Soon as I saw the look in her eyes  
Should known it was over over  
  
Im gonna be blue in the morning  
Cause I cant take a warning  
See a girl and fall in love  
With just a pretty face so easy easy  
  
God help me dont want to be  
Dont want to be a loser  
Loser no more  
Please help me help me to see  
Help me to see the chooser  
Chooser for sure  
  
Im gonna be blue in the morning  
Cause I cant take a warning  
See a girl and fall in love  
With just a pretty face so easy easy
