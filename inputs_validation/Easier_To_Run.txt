Its easier to run  
Replacing this pain with something numb  
Its so much easier to go  
Than face all this pain here all alone  
  
Something has been taken from deep inside of me  
A secret Ive kept locked away  
No one can ever see  
Wounds so deep they never show  
They never go away  
Like moving pictures in my head  
For years and years theyve played  
  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would  
If I could  
Stand up and take the blame I would  
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would  
If I could  
Stand up and take the blame I would  
If I could take all the shame to the grave  
  
Its easier to run  
Replacing this pain with something numb  
Its so much easier to go  
Than face all this pain here all alone  
  
Sometimes I remember  
The darkness of my past  
Bringing back these memories  
I wish I didnt have  
Sometimes I think of letting go  
And never looking back  
And never moving forward so  
Thered never be a past  
  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would  
If I could  
Stand up and take the blame I would  
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would  
If I could  
Stand up and take the blame I would  
If I could take all the shame to the grave  
  
Just washing it aside  
All of the helplessness inside  
Pretending I dont feel misplaced  
Is so much simpler than change  
  
Its easier to run  
Replacing this pain with something numb  
Its so much easier to go  
Than face all this pain here all alone  
  
Its easier to run  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made  
Its easier to go  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would  
If I could stand up and take the blame I would  
I would take all the shame to the grave
