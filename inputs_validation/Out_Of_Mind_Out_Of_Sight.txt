Buddy tip your bottle back  
Climb aboard the bus  
Join your brothers in the band  
If you aint bombed in Burmingham  
Then you aint one of us  
We dont really give a damn  
London is a hundred miles awaitin where were at  
And a thousand years behind  
Splitting from a sorry gig that left us feelin flat  
Out of sight and out of mind  
Cruisin through the countryside well never see again  
Aint it lonesome out tonight  
Weve been on that road now since I cant remember when  
Out of mind and out of sight  
Buddy tip your bottle back and climb aboard the bus  
Join your brothers in the band  
If you aint bombed in Burmingham then you aint one of us  
We dont really give a damn  
Yeah I been evrywhere and I seen evrything there is  
But I never saw the light  
Scared to death of dyin so I do my best to live  
Out of mind and out of sight  
Knowin no one nowheres gonna miss us when were gone  
Lets keep drinkin til were blind  
Evrybodys sleepin and Im stuck inside a song  
Outta sight and outta line  
Someday when its over and its time to settle down  
And weve left it all behind  
We can sit and wonder how we ever got around  
Out of sight and out of mind  
Out of sight and out of mind
