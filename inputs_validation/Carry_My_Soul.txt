spoken  
Yeah he ho my name is Jimmy beep beereep beeb beeb  
Whatever you want to call me  
You know like the birds fly in the air  
Thats how I want to be  
Free free free  
Ive been trying all my life to break free  
Its like a big bad fight that never ends  
You know what Im saying  
First I was a soldier  
Then I was a rebel  
Then a runaway and Ive been running ever since  
But its like everything is in my way  
Everything even my head my body  
sung  
A drop in the sea caused a flood  
Quenching mans drought  
You did it to me to my thirsty heart  
With your tender touch  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
spoken  
Yeah like a drop in the sea thats how I feel sometimes  
Like Im stuck in the traffic or something  
But I wasnt gonna let that be  
I made a plan  
I worked hard I had a tv I had a car I had a house  
I was a man with a job you know  
You know I had all those things  
But then I broke down one day  
And I lost it all  
I came rolling down that mountain  
sung  
A pencil in the hands of almighty love  
Where the ink wont dry  
Is writing the names of poor men dying  
In his angels arms  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
spoken  
Yeah I lost it all and like magic I was free  
When no one spoke to me  
When no one cared for me  
Thats the day I started singing this song  
And this is how it goes  
sung  
Carry my soul Carry my soul Carry my soul Carry my soul  
Carry my soul Carry my soul Carry my soul Carry my soul  
Carry my soul  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
spoken  
Yeah Thats the song of the free  
I dont want to fight no more  
I feel we where made for something big  
Just let the wind blow  
sung  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
You did it to me  
My thirsty hearth  
spoken  
Yeah just let the wind blow  
sung  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
Blessed are the poor  
Oh Almighty Love
