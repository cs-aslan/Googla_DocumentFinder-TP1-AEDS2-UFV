Youre everything  
Thats why I cling to you  
When I emerge  
My thoughts converge to you  
  
To you  
The world is so small  
Compared to you  
And everybodys wrong  
  
Compared to you  
To you  
I begin to see through your eyes  
All the former mysteries are no surprise  
  
So now you listen  
Cause Im omniscient  
Hey look at me lady  
Im just a little baby  
  
Youre lucky to have me  
Im cute and sweet as candy  
As charming as a fable  
Im innocent and disabled  
  
So hug me and kiss me  
Then wipe my butt and piss me  
I hope you never leave  
Cause who would hear me scream  
  
Nobody understands  
Except the toys in my hands  
So now you listen  
Cause Im omniscient  
  
Hey look at me lady  
Im just a little baby  
If I smile then you smile  
Then Ill get mad for awhile  
  
I melt in your mouth  
And in your hands whenever I can  
But I really do nothing  
Except kickin and fussin  
  
I like to make a mess  
I laugh at your distress  
I sit all day in my crib  
Absorbing all you give  
  
Im helpless  
Im flawless  
Im a machine  
Give me I need my toys  
  
Keep me hot  
Keep me strong  
Keep me everlong  
So now you listen  
  
Cause Im omniscient
