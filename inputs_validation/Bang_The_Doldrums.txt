I wrote a goodbye note  
In lipstick on your arm  
When you passed out  
I couldnt bring myself to call  
Except to call it quits  
  
Chorus  
Best friends  
Exfriends till the end  
Better off as lovers  
And not the other way around  
Racing through the city  
Windows down  
In the back of  
Yellowcheckered cars  
  
This city says  
Come hell or high water  
When Im feeling hot and wet  
I cant commit to a thing  
Be it heart or hospital  
  
Chorus  
  
The tombstones are waiting  
They were half engraved  
They knew it was over  
Just didnt know the date  
  
And I cast a spell over the West  
To make you think of me  
The same way I think of you  
This is a love song in my own way  
Happily ever after below the waist  
  
Best friends  
Exfriends till the end  
Better off as lovers  
Racing through the city  
Windows down  
In the back of  
Yellowcheckered cars  
  
Best friends  
Exfriends till the end  
Better off as lovers  
And not the other way around  
Exfriends till the end  
Better off as lovers
