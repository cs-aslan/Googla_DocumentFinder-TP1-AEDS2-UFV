Somewhere between her blue eyes and jeans  
Theres a heart thats been broken  
Along with her dreams  
And tonight shes out dancing  
Drinking and thinking  
Feeling a feeling  
Between her blue eyes and jeans  
  
She looks just like an angel  
In a big ole cloud of lonesome  
Reflecting her memory  
Round a golden wedding ring  
  
And tonight some dance hall doctor  
Might break the chains that locked her  
To that lonesome old feeling  
Between her blue eyes and jeans  
  
Somewhere between her blue eyes and jeans  
Theres a heart thats been broken  
Along with her dreams  
And tonight some dance hall doctor  
Might break the chains that locked her  
To that lonesome old feeling  
Between her blue eyes and jeans  
  
Somewhere between her blue eyes and jeans  
Theres a heart thats been broken  
Along with her dreams  
And tonight some dance hall doctor  
Might break the chains that locked her  
To that lonesome old feeling  
Between her blue eyes and jeans  
  
Shes healing a feeling  
Between her blue eyes and jeans
