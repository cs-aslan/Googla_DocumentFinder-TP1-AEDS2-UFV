MRS SOWEBERRY spoken  
Right then Oliver Twist  
Your beds underneath the counter  
You dont mind sleeping  
Among coffins I suppose  
It dont much matter whether you do  
Or you dont cause you cant sleep  
Nowhere else  
  
OLIVER  
Where is love  
Does it fall from skies above  
Is it underneat the willow tree  
That Ive been dream of  
Where is she  
Who I close my eyes to see  
Will I ever know the sweet hello  
Thats only meant for me  
Who can say where she may hide  
Must I travel far and wide  
Til I am bedside the someone who  
I can mean somethin to  
Where   
Where is love  
  
Who can say where she may hide  
Must I travel far and wide  
Til I am beside the someone who  
I can mean something to  
Where  
Where is love
