I remember the days  
When youre here with me  
Those laughter and tears  
We shared for years  
Memries that we had  
For so long its me and you  
Now youre gone away  
You left me all alone  
  
Go on do what you want  
But please dont leave me  
Youll break my heart  
Hey what should I do  
Babe Im missing you  
Please dont disappear  
These are the words that you should hear  
Time and time again  
I wish that you were here  
  
I dont wanna lose you girl  
I need you back to me  
I dont wanna lose you  
Baby cant you see  
Oh I need you  
Youve been a part of me  
  
I wish someday youll be back home  
Cause I really miss you  
Darling please come home  
  
I wish someday youll be back home  
Cause I really miss you  
Darling please come home  
  
I remember the days  
When youre here with me
