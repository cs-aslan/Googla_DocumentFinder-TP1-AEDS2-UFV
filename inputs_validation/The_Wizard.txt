He was the wizard of a thousand kings  
And I chanced to meet him one night wandering  
He told me tales and he drank my wine  
Me and my magic man kinda feelin fine  
  
He had a cloak of gold and eyes of fire  
And as he spoke I felt a deep desire  
To free the world from its fear and pain  
And help the people to feel free again  
  
Why dont we listen to the voices in our hearts  
Cause then I know wed find that were not so far apart  
Everybodys got to be happy everyone should sing  
For we know the joy of life the peace that love can bring  
  
So spoke the wizard in his mountain home  
The vision of his wisdom means well never be alone  
And I will dream of my magic night  
And the million silver stars that guide me with their light
