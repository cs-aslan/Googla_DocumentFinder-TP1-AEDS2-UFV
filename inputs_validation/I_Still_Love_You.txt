I was with you you were alone  
Now Im standing here  
Wisdom came only after youd gone  
Now Im starting all over with a tear in my eye  
I just never thought youd disappear  
  
In the night your spirit arises  
With it comes the pain  
I hope Im dreaming cause it hurts so bad  
When I reach out for you Im alone in some room  
I just never thought youd disappear  
  
I still love you like a child  
Wasnt that good enough  
I still want you it drive me wild  
The pain is just too much  
Maybe Ive lost enough  
  
Time heals all so they say I dont know  
Sometimes nothings clear  
Maybe someday Ill understand  
But I know for a start  
Theres a place in my hear that is yours  
And it wont disappear  
  
I still love you like a child  
Wasnt that good enough  
I still want you It drives me wild  
The pain is just too much  
I still love you
