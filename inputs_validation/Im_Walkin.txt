Im walkin yes indeed and Im talkin  
About you and me Im hopin  
That youll come back to me  
Im lonely as I can be Im waitin  
For your company Im hopin  
That youll come back to me  
  
What you gonna do when the well runs dry  
You gonna run away and hide  
Im gonna run right by your side  
For you pretty baby Ill even die  
Im walkin yes indeed and Im talkin  
About you and me Im hopin  
That youll come back to me  
  
Well what you gonna do when the well runs dry  
Youre gonna sit right down and cry  
What you gonna do when I say goodbye  
All you gonna do is dry your eye  
Im walkin yes indeed and Im talkin  
About you and me Im hopin  
That youll come back to me
