You can buy a diamond ring  
And slip it on my hand  
Put me on a big ol plane  
And fly me to a foreign land  
  
Show me rows of fancy clothes  
Saying Honey you can take your pick  
Well that would be mighty kind  
But it aint gonna do the trick  
  
Chorus  
Give a little love  
A squeeze and a little kiss  
Give a little hug  
Mmm I want some more of this  
Take a little time  
Yeah make a little fuss  
Thats what a woman wants  
So give a little love  
  
Get this you can be some big hunk  
Handsome dark and tall  
Talk to me in foreign tongues  
Or with a southern drawl  
  
Or be a man from old Siam  
Wear a pointed hat  
I dont care how you look  
Cause that aint where its at  
  
Chorus  
  
Well there are men wholl turn your head  
And knock you off of your feet  
Sweet talk and big blue eyes  
Make a poor heart skip a beat  
  
Drive you wild with a smile  
And then theyll treat you cruel  
Well I aint gonna fall for that  
Cause Mama didnt raise no fool  
  
Chorus
