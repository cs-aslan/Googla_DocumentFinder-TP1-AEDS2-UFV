I betcha my heart I love ye I betcha my dreams are of ye  
Thats why I sing so loud Im floatin on the cloud I betcha my heart I love
ye  
I woke up this morning so early remembered your hair was curly  
I rolled over and then I dreamed of you again I betcha my heart I love ye
yodel  
 guitar   
Im out of this world I betcha it started the day I metcha  
When youre close to me its just like TNT I betcha my heart I love ye  
Well I betcha my heart I love ye yodel
