You got the right to tell me its all over  
It isnt like me to be begging you  
Dont let go dont let go  
Just stay with me another day  
When Im not myself please understand me  
Im so confused I dont know what to do  
But dont give up dont give up  
It just may take a little time  
  
Be tender with me baby  
Im so afraid youll go away  
Be tender with me baby  
Always for always  
  
I know that youve been patient with my weakness  
And that you hate to see me cry  
But I know yes I know  
I doesnt have to be this way  
But Im so lonely I could die  
  
Be tender with me baby  
Im so afraid youll go away  
Be tender with me baby  
Always for always  
  
Why does my heart keep hurting  
Why do I feel like I do  
I hope you see this is not really me  
That its just a phase that Im going through
