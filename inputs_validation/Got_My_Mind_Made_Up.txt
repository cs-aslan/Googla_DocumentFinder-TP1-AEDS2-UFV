Dont ever try to change me  
I been in this thing too long  
Theres nothing you can say or do  
To make me think Im wrong  
Well Im going off to Libya  
Theres guy I gotta see  
Hes been living there three years now  
In an oil refinery  
Ive got my mind made up  
Ive got my mind made up  
  
Call your Ma in Talahassee  
Tell her her babys on the line  
Tell her not to worry  
Everything is gonna be fine  
Well I gave you all my money  
All my connections too  
There aint nothing in this world girl  
You can say I didnt give to you  
Ive got my mind made up  
Ive got my mind made up  
  
You will be alright girl  
Someones watching over you  
He wont do nothing to you  
Baby that I wouldnt do  
Well if you dont want to see me  
Look the other way  
You dont have to feed me  
I aint your dog thats gone astray  
Ive got my mind made up  
Ive got my mind made up  
Ive got my mind made up  
Ive got my mind made up  
Ive got my mind made up
