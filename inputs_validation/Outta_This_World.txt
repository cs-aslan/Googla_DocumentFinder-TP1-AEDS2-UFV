You must be from heaven baby yes you are  
Your love is like a shooting star  
So they can try but they cant touch touch  
You gotta look up to us  
  
Cause your love is outta this world oooh  
And you bring me down to earth  
I love how you put me first oooh  
Make me feel my every word  
Cause Im sayin you know this is about you  
I keep sayin you know this is about you  
It must be  
This is about you  
I never felt this way  
I know this be a song about you  
Forever everyday  
I know this be a song about you  
  
Ill be your moon

And when its dark I promise that youll see the light  
And just as far as the moon from the summer sun  
Thats how long that Ill be here  
And its because  
  
You must be from heaven baby yes you are
