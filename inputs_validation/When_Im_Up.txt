I am the fountain of affection  
Im the instrument of joy  
And to keep the good times rolling  
Im the boy Im the boy  
You know the world could be our oyster  
If you just put your trust in me  
Cause well keep the good times rollin  
Wait and see wait and see Oh wait and see  
  
Theres exaltations a sweet disintegrations  
Theres a few discolourations then it comes along  
You know up is what he chooses the kisses and the bruises  
There aint nothing he refuses then it comes along  
It comes along and I am lifted I am lifted I am lifted  
  
Chorus  
When Im up I cant get down  
Cant get down cant get level  
When Im up I cant get down  
Get my feet back on the ground  
When Im up I cant get down  
Cant get down cant get level  
When Im up I cant get down  
Get my feet back on the ground  
  
He just needs something to bind him  
Something to wind him up  
It wont take long to find him  
When it comes on strong  
  
Black skies are grinning street lights are spinning  
The night is just beginning and then it comes on strong  
It comes on strong and I am lifted I am lifted I am lifted  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh it comes on strong and I am lifted  
It comes on strong and I am lifted  
I am lifted I am lifted  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh I cant get down  
Oh no no no no no I cant get down  
Ohohoh I cant get down
