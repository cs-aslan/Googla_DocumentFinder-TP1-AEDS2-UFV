Yeah Ive had my share of broken dreams  
And more than a couple of falls  
And in chasin what I thought were moonbeams  
I have run into a couple of walls  
But in looking back at the places Ive been  
The changes that Ive left behind  
I just look at myself to find  
Ive learned the hard way every time  
  
Cause Ive had my share of good intentions  
And Ive made my share of mistakes  
And Ive learned at times its best to bend  
Cause if you dont well those are the breaks  
Should have listened to all the things I was told  
But I was young and too proud at the time  
Now I look at myself to find  
I learn the hard way evry time  
  
But in looking back at the lessons Ive learned  
And the mountains I wanted to climb  
I just look at myself to find  
Ive learned the hard way evry time  
  
Cause Ive had my share of broken dreams  
And more than a couple of falls  
And in chasin what I thought were moonbeams  
I have run into a couple of walls  
But in looking back at the faces Ive been  
I would sure be the first one to say  
When I look at myself today  
Wouldnta done it any other way
