You know it  
And I know it  
Gonna be a star  
You wont you wont  
Get me very far  
Dont say hello its already time to go  
  
Oh the wind is carrying me home me home me home again  
  
You know it  
And I know it  
Gonna be a star  
You wont you wont  
Get me very far  
You saw life  
Back in the countryside aaaaah  
  
Oh my soul rise up and go  
Beyond beyond  
To what you know
