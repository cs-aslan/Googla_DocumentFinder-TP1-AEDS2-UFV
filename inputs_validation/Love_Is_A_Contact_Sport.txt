Contact Contact  
Huh huh huh huh hoo huh yeah  
Youve been avoiding me  
Like a cat trying to dodge a dog  
I never see ya shine  
Youre as cold as the London fog  
You claim you want my love  
Well I wouldnt know by the way you behave  
If you want to feel the thrill of my touch  
You better come out of your cave  
  
Its so perplexing  
Why you fight it wont you try it  
Loves electric  
Turn me on and see  
  
Chorus  
Love is a contact sport  
You gotta move in time  
If you want to do it right  
Here I am  
Love is a contact sport  
You gotta act untamed  
If you want to play the game  
So grab my hand SLAM  
  
I hate to sound aggressive  
But Im tired of waiting for your move  
Cut the formalities  
Cause youve got a few things to prove  
If you really want my love  
I need to feel it down deep from within  
Dont make me wait too long  
Im ready now come and stroke my skin  
  
Well all this talking  
Worthless chatter just dont matter  
Time for stalkin  
Come get next to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey boy  
Why dontcha come on over  
So we can make that contact  
Contact you dare  
  
Its so perplexing  
Why you fight it wont you try it  
Loves electric  
Turn me on and see  
  
Chorus
