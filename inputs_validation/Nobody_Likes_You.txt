I fell asleep  
While watching Spike tv  
After 10 cups of coffee  
And youre still not here  
  
Dreaming of a song  
But something went wrong  
And you cant tell anyone  
Cuz no ones here  
  
Left me here alone  
When I should have stayed home  
After 10 cups of coffee  
Im thinking  
  
Whered you go  
  
Nobody likes you  
Everyone left you whered you go  
Theyre all out without you  
Having fun whered you go  
  
Everyone left you  
Nobody likes you whered you go  
Theyre all out without you  
Having fun  
  
Whered you go
