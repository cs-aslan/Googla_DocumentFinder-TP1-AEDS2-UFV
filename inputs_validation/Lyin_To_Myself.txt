Im lyin to myself cryin to myself  
Tryin to make believe my babys on the shelf  
But its more than I can do  
Tryin to find a way to bluff it through  
  
I miss my lovin an kissin  
When I hear the radio playin I Love You So  
Thats the time you know I start to feel like ten below  
Im lyin to myself  
  
Tryin to chase the blues away  
Just because of foolish pride I tried to hide  
All feelings for Cupids art  
And though Ive cried out loud that twos a crowd  
  
That dont convince my heart  
When I think of my sweet pet and the places we met  
I tell myself Im not a doggone bit upset  
But Im lyin to myself  
Tryin to chase the blues away
