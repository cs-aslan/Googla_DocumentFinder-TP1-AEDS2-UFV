I bring you plates from Rome  
You say they look fantastic  
I say were having fun  
Nothing like that Italian plastic  
  
I bring you rocks and flowers  
You say they look pathetic  
You pick me up at night  
I dont feel pathetic  
  
When you wake up with me  
Ill be your glass of water uh huh  
When you stick up for me  
Then youre my bella bambina  
  
I say were on a trip  
Looks like were on vacation  
I say were having fun  
In our little constellation  
  
When you wake up with me  
Ill be your glass of water uh huh  
When you stick up for me  
  
Then Ill be your bella bambino your man from the moon  
Ill be your little boy running with that egg on his spoon  
Ill be your soul survivor your worst wicked friend  
Ill be your piggy in the middle stick with you till the end  
  
When you wake up with me  
Ill be your glass of water uh huh  
When you stick up for me  
Then youre my bella bambina  
  
Who ya gonna take to the ball tonight  
Who ya gonna take to the dance tonight  
Who ya gonna take to the ball tonight  
Who ya gonna take to the dance tonight tonight tonight
