People go naked and pick up these trails  
Someone before me laid down these rails  
When its loaded up too heavy  
this engine fails  
In lovetown  
I cant settle down  
And do those teeth still match the wound  
Take a good look around  
In lovetown  
  
Aaahha aaahha  
Looking in lovetown  
Aaahha aaahha  
This is lovetown  
  
Sometimes youre stormy water  
on which I pour my oil  
In each others shadow  
The roots reach into the soil  
All these knots so tightly tied  
We could not uncoil  
In lovetown  
No place to settle down  
And do those teeth still match the wound  
Take a good look around  
In lovetown  
  
Aaahha aaahha  
This is lovetown  
Aaahha aaahha  
Looking in lovetown  
  
Whos lonely lips will find these hidden scars  
Whos seen the kisses left in dim lit bars  
Whos out in the streets looking for love like ours  
Whos looking in lovetown tonight  
  
Have you got what you want  
Said have you got what you need  
With what you did and what you saw  
Did you find you needed more  
Have you got what you came for  
Are you really so sure  
Are you really so sure  
  
Looking in lovetown  
In lovetown  
Living in lovetown  
Hey yeah yeah
