Brett Jones  
  
His head turned and my heart jumped  
When I saw that it was him  
After two long years the love of my life  
And I just held my breath in  
Standin there smiling  
While his eyes locked on mine  
He couldnt hear me screamin on the inside  
  
CHORUS  
When I said tear dont you fall  
Hes done let him go  
Eyes dont look back  
Down that empty road  
And lips you may move  
But dont you say too much  
Oh and please please heart hush  
  
I said somethin stupid  
And reached out my hand  
After makin love and movin earth We were shakin hands  
A million sweet memoriers Pinballed through my brain  
The want to hold him one more time Ran through my veins  
  
Repeat CHORUS  
  
I kept lookin at my watch like I had somewhere to be  
Then he stopped talkin and kissed me tenderly  
  
Repeat CHORUS
