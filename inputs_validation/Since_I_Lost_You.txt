It seems in a moment your whole world can shatter  
Like morning dreams they just disappear  
Like dust in your hand falling to the floor  
How can life ever be the same  
  
Cause my heart is broken in pieces  
Yes my heart is broken in pieces  
Since youve been gone  
  
Its all too easy to take so much for granted  
But its so hard to find the words to say  
Like a castle in the sand the water takes away  
How can life ever be the same  
  
Cause my heart is broken in pieces  
Yes my heart is broken in pieces  
Since Ive lost you  
  
Ooh now youll never see  
Ooh now youll never know  
All the things I planned for you  
Things for you and me  
  
I held your hand so tightly  
That I couldnt let it go  
Now how can life ever be the same  
  
Cause my heart is broken in pieces  
Yes my heart is broken in pieces  
Since youve been gone
