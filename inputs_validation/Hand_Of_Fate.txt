The hand of fate is on me now  
It pick me up and knock me down  
Im on the run Im prison bound  
The hand of fate is heavy now  
I killed a man Im highway bound  
The wheel of fortune keeps turning round  
Turning round turning round  
I should have known it was a one horse town  
  
My sweet girl was once his wife  
He had papers the judge had signed  
The wind blew hard it was stormy night  
He shot me once but I shot him twice  
The hand of fate is on me now  
It pick me up and it kicked me right down  
Kicked me right down  
Kicked me right down  
  
I had to save her life  
Yeah I gunned him twice  
Yeah and I watched him die watch out boy  
Yeah I watched him die  
  
He was a barroom man the violent kind  
He had no love for that gal of mine  
Then one day in a drinking bout  
He swore hed throw me right of town  
The hand of fate is on me now  
I shot that man I put him underground  
I put him underground  
Yes I did  
  
Im on the run I hear the hounds  
My luck is up my chips are down  
So goodbye baby so long now  
Wish me luck Im going to need it child  
The hand of fate is on me now  
Yeah its too late  
Too late baby too late now  
The hand of fate is on me now  
The hand of fate is heavy now  
  
It pick you up and knock you down
