Look out heres Starbreaker  
Cruisin into town  
Set his mind to stealin  
Every little heart around  
Step out on the sidewalks  
If youre feeling game  
He comes but once a lifetime  
Never seen again  
  
Starbreaker  
Glides in from the sky  
Starbreaker  
Takes you up so high  
  
Paradise is waiting  
For the chosen few  
Lets hope maybe this time  
He picks me and you  
Star voyage to a new world  
Lightyear miles away  
Cross your fingers here he is  
Take us now this day  
  
Starbreaker  
Glides in from the sky  
Starbreaker  
Takes you up so high  
  
Starbreaker take my hand  
Starbreaker understand  
Starbreaker youre the one  
Starbreaker lead us on and on  
  
Look out heres Starbreaker  
Cruisin into town  
Set his mind to stealin  
Every little heart around  
Step out on the sidewalks  
If youre feeling game  
He comes but once a lifetime  
Never ever seen again  
  
Starbreaker  
Glides in from the sky  
Starbreaker  
Takes you up so high
