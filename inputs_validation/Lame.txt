Communication is where it breaks down  
Humiliation is all thats left now  
Apologetic you say youre sorry  
Youre so pathetic you wont be bothering me  
Just like I told you before  
Dont want to see you knockin at my door  
Dont wanna see you round here no more  
  
Give me a little respect  
Not long till someone breaks your neck  
Youre just a wreck  
And nothings gonna change  
Nothings gonna change  
Not much that you can say and  
Everything you do is fucking lame  
  
Your misdirection is all you offered  
Cooperation is dead why bother  
You live your life in someone elses dream  
And you will find youve slid between the seams  
  
I thought I told you before  
Dont want to see you knockin at my door  
Dont want to see you round here no more  
  
I think enough has been said  
Takes too much to get it through your head  
Might as well be dead  
And nothings gonna change  
Nothings gonna change  
Not much that you can say and  
Everything you do is fuckin lame  
  
And you think somethings wrong with me  
Or maybe you cant see what I can see  
I say there must be something wrong with you  
Or maybe you cant do what I can do  
I want to know what happened to you  
  
Give me a little respect  
Not long till someone breaks your neck  
Youre just a wreck  
And nothings gonna change  
Nothings gonna change  
Not much that you can say and  
Everything you do is fucking lame  
Fucking lame  
Fucking lame  
Its all fucking lame
