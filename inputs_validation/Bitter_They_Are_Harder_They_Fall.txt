I told her to leave me alone  
Thats what shes done just what shes done  
And a house built for two aint a home  
When its lived in by one one lonely one  
  
And I can no longer hear footsteps come right down the hall  
Here come the teardrops bitter they are harder they fall  
She caught me lying then she caught a train  
And I caught a fever walking home in the rain  
Oh yeah  
  
But its over and Im done  
She left me once and for all  
Here come the teardrops bitter they are harder they fall  
Here come the teardrops bitter they are harder they fall
