You keep saying you got something for me  
Something you call love but I call sex  
Youve been kissing when you oughtabea  
Screwing and now someone else can  
Kiss your ass  
These boots are made for walking  
thats just what theyll do  
And one of these days these boots  
Are gonna walk all over you  
  
You keep lying and there aint no believing  
And you keep stayin when you oughtabea leaving  
Now whats right is right but you aint been  
  
Right yet  
These boots  
  
You keep dressin ways you shouldnt  
Be dressing  
And you keep thinking that youll never  
Get burned ha  
I just found me a brand new Box Spring  
Mattress  
What you know bitch you got a lot ta learn  
These boots are you ready boots  
  
And you think Im kiddin dontchya
