What was that you said to me  
Im not exactly sure I heard you right  
What is it you want from me  
Im not exactly sure I will comply  
  
You think youve got me where you want  
You think youre better but youre not  
I dont mean anything to you  
Why  
  
Dont make me put you in your place  
You dont think Id let you make a fool of me  
Dont make me put you in your place  
You dont think Id let you make a fool of me  
  
What do you expect from me  
Are you really looking for a fight  
What do you expect to see  
For me to lose control I think I might
