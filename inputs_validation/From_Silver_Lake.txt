Did you see our brother  
He was here the other day  
But he only came to say that he was leaving  
Did you see his lady  
She was looking where hed gone  
But she wasnt letting on  
That she was grieving  
  
Shes bound to go  
Perhaps shell find him waiting  
For his boat in some city far away  
Shes bound to go  
  
Lately I remember  
Afternoons of smoke and wine  
There was nothing we could find  
But peace and pleasure  
And with a smile he told me  
That he wanted just to be on his way  
Across the sea no man can measure  
  
He wont be back  
And the sun may find him sleeping  
In the dust of some ruin far away  
He wont be back  
  
Early today as I watched while  
The skyline was shaking  
I heard a rumbling  
Early today the mechanical city was waking  
And I ran out stumbling mumbling  
Out through the laughter  
Of children and dogs  
  
Did you see our brother  
He was here the other day  
But he only came to say that  
He cant breathe here  
Did you see his lady  
She was reaching for his hand  
Just as if to tell her man  
That she cant either  
  
Theyre bound to go  
And the sun may find me running after them  
Seeing something far away  
We wont be back  
  
COUNTER SONG AT THE END OF FROM SILVER LAKE  
Someone who had been away  
Suddenly came back today  
And I allowed him home today into my mind  
For a moment face to face  
Evil packed upon the place  
Long ago he meant to stay out there this time  
Oh what do you know  
The love that Ive been feeling  
The past is healing so slow  
By tomorrow gone from sorrow
