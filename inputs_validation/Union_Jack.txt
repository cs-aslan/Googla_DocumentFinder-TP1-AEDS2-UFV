Missin at school  
Bustin the rules  
Hates everything in sight  
Needs some new shoes  
  
Dads on the booze  
Shes never there  
Far away kid  
All on his own  
  
Cant tell the wrong from right  
Thin as a rake  
Tough as a nail tonight  
Tonight  
  
Here are your hopes for the future youll see  
If you hang round the neck of a loser like me  
Theres no one else in your life  
You dont need anyone  
  
Come with me in the night  
I will give you the matches  
I will make you complete  
Wont you please come with me  
  
I wont ask you again  
I can give you the hopes of a younger man  
In the night we can hear  
Im your friend and whats more  
  
I will give you what youve been looking for  
Yes I can give you what youve been looking for  
Should I run  
Should I take it  
  
Should I go or should I stay  
Who side am I on in this game that we play  
I want to be somebody someday  
Living my life away  
  
And I cant find a job  
I cant pay the rent  
Police are always breathing down my neck  
And theres no way out  
  
Theres no way out no more  
Under this flag  
Were all Union Jacks  
And theres no home for the brave  
  
And theres no way back  
We are the obeyer  
We are the law  
In stained boots  
  
And navy blue  
Hello hello hello  
With fire in my heart and you along beside me  
Well burn down all the schools  
  
That taught us theres nothing better than  
To live by all the rules  
Made by the ruling classes  
So the scales of justice tip  
  
In the favor of the government  
Under this flag  
Were all Union Jacks  
And theres no home for the brave  
  
And theres no way back  
We are the obeyer  
We are the law  
In stained boots  
  
And navy blue  
Hello hello hello  
With fire in my heart and you along beside me  
Well burn down all the schools  
  
That taught us theres nothing better than  
To live by all the rules  
Made by the ruling classes  
So the scales of justice tip  
  
In the favor of the government  
Under this flag  
Were all Union Jacks  
And theres no home for the brave  
  
And theres no way back  
Under this flag  
Were all Union Jacks  
And theres no home for the brave  
  
And theres no way back  
Tonight  
Here are your hopes for a future youll see  
Youre like me  
  
Were all Union Jacks
