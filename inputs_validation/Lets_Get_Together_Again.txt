Lets get together again All you need is here to stay Lets  
Get together again Forget about your yesterdays  
Its been a very long long time Since I last remember  
Seeing you I hope you write and say youre fine Did you  
Ever sit and dream Of the time when we would meet  
Again Its very hard now youre not mine  
The phones right next to you And you know just what to  
Do Just pick it up And call my name  
Lets get together again All you need is here to stay Lets  
Get together again Forget about your yesterday  
Tomorrows just a step away Til I come running back to  
You I hope you stay right by my side I thought Id never  
See My angel back here next to me Promise me that you  
Wont hide  
The phones right next to you And you know just what to  
Do Just pick it up And call my name  
Lets get together again All you need is here to stay Lets  
Get together again Forget about your yesterday  
And you know there aint much time Im so alone Please  
Come home Im on my own  
Lets get together again All you need is here to stay Lets  
Get together again Forget about your yesterday  
Lets get together again All you need is here to stay Lets  
Get together again Forget about your yesterday  
Lets get together again All you need is here to stay Lets  
Get together again Forget about your yesterday
