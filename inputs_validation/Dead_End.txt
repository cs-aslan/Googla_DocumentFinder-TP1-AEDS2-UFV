Well easily with me I show affection  
But its a creepin up a creepin up on me in another direction  
  
I love I write and I die  
And I try to ask no questions  
But the weary one is still me  
Do you think its obsession  
  
The smoke will find you a choker that matches your coat not fit to be tied  
The mirror it makes it all clearer as you stand alone and cant see your
behind  
Yea  
They tried to tell me I could say that nobody could believe this  
Well they tried to tell me I could say nobody could achieve this  
The way you stayed of locked away of  
Keeping the flame for yourself  
The way you stayed of pushin the blame of reaping the fame for yourself  
  
Oh well its a its a dead end  
Its a dead end  
Oh its a dead end lonely day  
Say its a dead end  
Its a its a its a its a its a dead end day  
Its a dead end oh day  
And its a long way a long way down  
Hey well its a long way a long way down  
  
Change is coming a baby  
Dont be startled lady  
Every once in a while they do it again  
You gonna shake it shake it  
You know you wanna take it  
Back to where you once belonged  
Back beneath the sheets and between the pillow cases  
And the snake he races out and he he tangles into your hair  
Funny the fruits you choose  
Oh the time you take the words you loose  
And it all goes back to rotation over the back of your hand  
Oh the back of your hand oh the back of your hand  
Oh the map is your hand  
Its the back of your hand the back of your hand  
Say the back of your hand oh the map is your hand its the back of your hand  
  
Stop whining all the time  
Dont you find a little secret to yourself always saved your life  
Stop listening to the words that youve heard  
No one else but yourself will agree with you more  
That its a long long way  
Its a long long way  
And its a long long way a long way down  
Hey and its a long way down  
And its a lo oh oh ng way down  
Hey hey hey and its a long long long long way down  
Say say SCATS  
And its a lo oh oh ng way down hey and its a long way dooooown  
Its a dead end  
Its a dead end oh  
Its a dead end lonely day  
Its a its a dead end  
Its a its a its a its a its a dead end day  
Its a dead end oh day
