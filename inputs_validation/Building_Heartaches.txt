Each time that I hold you close here in my arms  
Im building heartaches  
Each time that I kiss your lips so sweet and warm  
Im building heartaches  
  
And when you say you love me  
We both know its a lie  
An just a dream from which I must awake  
  
That each sweet word you tell me  
Is a heartache in disguise  
So Im building heartaches  
  
When people ask me what Im doin heres what I tell  
Im building heartaches  
And each kiss you give me is a tear that hasnt fell  
So Im building heartaches  
  
And when you say you love me  
We both know its a lie  
An just a dream from which I must awake  
  
And each sweet word you tell me  
Is a heartache in disguise  
So Im building heartaches
