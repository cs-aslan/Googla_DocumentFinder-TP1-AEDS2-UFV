Shes got diamonds in her eyes  
That she likes to hide  
Seek and youll find  
The hide and seeking kind  
Shes got rings  
Wrapped around your precious things  
And what the day brings  
Oh its no surprise  
Dont you ask me how Im doing  
When everything I do says I miss you  
Dont you ask me how Im doing  
When everything I do when everything I do  
When everything I do says I miss you  
Shes got diamonds in her eyes  
That she likes to hide  
Seek and youll find  
The hide and seeking kind  
Shes got rings  
Wrapped around your precious things  
What the day brings  
Oh its no surprise  
Dont you ask me how Im doing  
When everything I do says I miss you  
Dont you ask me how Im doing  
When everything I do when everything I do  
When everything I do says I miss you  
Shes got diamonds in her eyes  
That she likes to hide  
Seek and youll find  
The hide and seeking kind  
Shes got rings  
Wrapped around your precious things  
What the day brings  
Oh its no surprise  
Dont you ask me how Im doing  
When everything I do says I miss you  
Dont you ask me how Im doing  
When everything I do when everything I do  
When everything I do
