I served out my detention  
And in the end I got an honorable mention  
In the movie of my life starring you  
Instead of me  
When the moonlight hits your bright eyes I go blind  
And maybe next time  
Ill remember not to tell you something stupid  
Like Ill never leave your side  
Like the oldest movie I ever saw was the one we wrote together  
I said I hate you but Id never change a thing  
I can be your John Cusack  
I burnt out  
My defensive  
Now everything I say is taken as offensive
