I am the one  
Camouflage and guns  
Risk my life  
To keep my people from harm  
  
Authority  
Vested in me  
I sacrifice  
With my brothers in arms  
  
Trough this doorway  
Whats on the other side  
Never knowing  
Exactly what Ill find  
Locked and loaded  
Voices screaming  
Lets go  
Come on do it  
Here we go  
  
Chorus x2  
Take a life  
That others may live  
Oh thats just the way it goes  
Its playing over and over in my head  
Where itll end  
Nobody knows  
  
Stay the course  
Reasonable force  
I believe I serve a greater good  
  
Smoke and dust  
Enemies are crushed  
Nothing left  
Where a man once stood  
  
Trough this doorway  
Whats on the other side  
Never knowing  
Exactly what Ill find  
Locked and loaded  
Voices screaming  
Lets go  
But Im just doing what Im told  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Bang bang it hammers in my head  
Bang bang it hammers in my head  
Bang bang it hammers in my head  
In my head  
In my head  
  
Yeah though I walk to the through the valley of the  
Shadow of death  I will fear no evil  
For Thou art with me  
  
Locked and loaded  
Gonna find my truth  
Now Im busting trough  
All hell breaks loose  
  
And you can all hide behind your desks now  
And you can cry teacher come help me  
Through you all  
My aim is true
