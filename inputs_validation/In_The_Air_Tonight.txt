I can feel it coming in the air tonight oh Lord  
And Ive been waiting for this moment for all my life oh Lord  
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight oh Lord oh Lord  
  
Well if you told me you were drowning I would not lend a hand  
Ive seen your face before my friend but I dont know if you know who I am  
Well I was there and I saw what you did I saw it with my own two eyes  
So you can wipe off that grin I know where youve been  
Its all been a pack of lies  
  
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight oh Lord  
Well Ive been waiting for this moment for all my life oh Lord  
I can feel it coming in the air tonight oh Lord  
Well Ive been waiting for this moment for all my life oh Lord oh Lord  
  
Well I remember I remember dont worry how could I ever forget  
Its the first time the last time we ever met  
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up oh no you dont fool me  
Well the hurt doesnt show but the pain still grows  
Its no stranger to you and me  
  
I can feel it coming in the air tonight oh Lord  
Well been waiting for this moment for all my life oh Lord  
I can feel it in the air tonight oh Lord oh Lord  
Well Ive been waiting for this moment for all my life oh Lord  
I can feel it coming in the air tonight oh Lord  
And Ive been waiting for this moment for all my life oh Lord  
I can feel it in the air tonight oh Lord oh Lord oh Lord  
Well Ive been waiting for this moment for all my life oh Lord oh Lord  
  
I can feel it in the air tonight oh Lord oh Lord oh Lord oh Lord  
Well Ive been waiting for this moment for all my life oh Lord oh Lord oh
Lord
