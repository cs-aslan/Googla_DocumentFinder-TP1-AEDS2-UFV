Anywhere you say to be  
From the sky down to the ground  
If I hear you calling me  
I will never let you down  
What if I were far away  
Would the love fire still burn  
I want to know if you would be  
Still in love when I return  
  
Are you gonna love me  
Im who I should be when youre loving me  
Are you gonna love me  
And give this love a chance would we dance  
  
I know the way you feel  
I shouldnt worry bout the future now  
It just gets in the way  
Dont want to make you sad  
Just want to know youre gonna love me  
When its not a sunny day  
  
Are you gonna love me  
When the skies are grey and Im far away  
Are you gonna love me  
If I have to go do you know  
  
Interlude  
Its all about You and me you and me  
Will you wait for me  
Its all about love love love  
About your love  
  
You were feeling kind of blue  
When the job took me away  
The reason that Im calling you is  
Ill be coming back today  
  
Are you gonna love me  
Girl its been so long  
Is the feeling gone  
Are you gonna love me  
Thats what Im asking you  
Whatcha gonna do  
  
Repeat Interlude  
  
Are you gonna love me
