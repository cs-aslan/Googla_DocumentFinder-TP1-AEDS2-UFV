Once upon a time there was a tavern  
Where we used to raise a glass or two  
Remember how we laughed away the hours  
And dreamed of all the great things we would do  
Those were the days my friend  
We thought theyd never end  
Wed sing and dance forever and a day  
Wed live the life we choose wed fight and never lose  
For we were young and sure to have our way  
La la la la la la La la la la la la  
Those were the days  
Oh yes those were the days  
Then the busy years went rushing by us  
We lost our starry notions on the way  
If by chance Id see you in the tavern  
Wed smile at one another and wed say  
Those were the days my friend  
We thought theyd never end  
Wed sing and dance forever and a day  
Wed live the life we choose wed fight and never lose  
For we were young and sure to have our way  
La la la la la la La la la la la la  
Those were the days  
Oh yes those were the days  
Just tonight I stood before the tavern  
Nothing seemed the way it used to be  
In the glass I saw a strange reflection  
Was that lonely man really me  
Those were the days my friend  
We thought theyd never end  
Wed sing and dance forever and a day  
Wed live the life we choose wed fight and never lose  
For we were young and sure to have our way  
La la la la la la La la la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la la la La la la la la la  
La la la la  
Through the door there came familiar laughter  
I saw your face and heard you call my name  
Oh my friend were older but no wiser  
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same  
Those were the days my friend  
We thought theyd never end  
Wed sing and dance forever and a day  
Wed live the life we choose wed fight and never lose  
For we were young and sure to have our way  
La la la la la la La la la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la la la La la la la la la  
La la la la
