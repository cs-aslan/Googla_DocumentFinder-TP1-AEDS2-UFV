She lays her cards out on the table  
She always gets what shes going for and a whole lot more  
Got the movers and the shakers  
Quaking inside their mohair shoes  
After all theres nothing to lose  
  
Chorus  
Cracking that whip  
Making her own decisions  
Taking no lip  
Living with no conditions  
  
Theres only one thing that shes missing  
She never tells anybody shes missing it more and more each night  
And though she cries when shes alone  
By the morning shes ready to go  
Shes got the light  
  
Chorus  
  
Everythings fine  
Just as long as they do it her way  
Living with style  
Shes got it all  
Hail to the queen of the masquerade ball  
  
And though she cries when shes alone  
By the morning shes ready to go  
Shes got the light  
  
Chorus  
  
Everythings fine  
Just as long as they do it her way  
Living with style  
Shes got it all  
Hail to the queen of the masquerade ball
