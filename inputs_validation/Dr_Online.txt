Everybody online  
Its the beginning of the end  
You want things to go faster  
Its the beginning of the end  
Now everythings too slow for you  
Its the beginning of the end  
You are one step closer  
Its the beginning of the end  
Say Amen  
  
Chorus  
1800SUICIDE  
Or maybe Doctor Online could help you die  
You need wings to fly  
You need someone  
To take your place  
When you are gone  
  
Its the beginning of the end  
You know nothing last forever  
A beginning of a trend  
You need someone there to care for you  
Its the beginning of the end  
I dont think you understand  
Just a beginning of a flatline  
Together
