Shes looking back to see if hes looking at her  
They talk without any words  
And with a smile hes moving heaven and earth  
She dreams of holding him tight  
When will the moment be right  
Got to be diplomatic a step at a time dont want to blow it baby  
Thats the politics of kissing  
To know when to show your hand  
First thoughts then second guessing  
A subtle supply and demand  
Balance of power baby to hold or not to hold  
Thats the politics of kissing  
Youre finding your way as you go go go  
How do you know  
Head over heels under the moon looking at you but do you feel it too  
And if I move in closer what will you do  
Cause Im thinking please hold me tight  
Am I the light in your eyes  
I wish you had the power for reading my mind  
Cause Ill never say it to you  
Thats the politics of kissing  
To know when to show your hand  
First thoughts then second guessing  
A subtle supply and demand  
Balance of power baby to hold or not to hold  
Thats the politics of kissing  
Youre finding your way as you go go go  
How do you know  
Oh ooh ooh oh ooh ooh  
Oh ooh ooh oh ooh ooh  
Oh ooh ooh ooh  
Oh ooh ooh oh ooh ooh  
Oh ooh ooh ooh  
Hear what Im sayin to ya  
Thats the politics of kissing  
To know when to show your hand  
First thoughts then second guessing  
A subtle supply and demand  
Balance of power baby to hold or not to hold  
Thats the politics of kissing  
Thats the politics of kissing  
To know when to show your hand  
First thoughts then second guessing  
A subtle supply and demand  
Balance of power baby to hold or not to hold  
Thats the politics of kissing
