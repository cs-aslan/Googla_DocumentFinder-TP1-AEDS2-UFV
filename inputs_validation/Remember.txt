I think its funny just a sad song  
He likes his money now you aint got none  
So is it mighty strange  
Now that you are so broke  
Dont try to make it man  
You havent got a home  
  
Chorus  
Remember when I was in trouble  
You put down the phone  
And anywhere you go you go alone  
  
It was a crush change the money sure flew  
You had a flash name imagine youre broke  
But now its breaking up theres no one near you  
Dont try for me to call  
Cause I wont hear you  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Well dont you sit around start to move on  
Your life is broken down so get a new one  
And if you make it by and kiss the good life  
Why dont you make it right  
Just look at this time  
  
Chorus
