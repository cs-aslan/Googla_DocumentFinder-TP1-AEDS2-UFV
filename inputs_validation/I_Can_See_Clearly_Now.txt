I can see clearly now the rain is gone  
I can see all obstacles in my way  
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind  
Its gonna be a bright  
Bright bright bright  
Sunshiny day  
Its gonna be a bright  
Bright bright bright  
Sunshiny day  
  
I think I can make it now the pain is gone  
All of the bad feelings have disappeared  
Here is the rainbow Ive been prayin for  
Its gonna be a bright  
Bright bright bright  
Sunshiny day  
  
Look all around theres nothin but blue skies  
Look straight ahead nothin but blue skies  
  
I can see clearly now the rain is gone  
I can see all obstacles in my way  
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind  
Its gonna be a bright  
Bright bright bright  
Sunshiny day  
Its gonna be a bright  
Bright bright bright  
Sunshiny day  
Its gonna be a bright  
Bright bright bright  
Sunshiny day  
Oh what a bright bright  
Sunshiny day
