Another night out on the street  
Stopping for my usual seat  
Oh bartender please  
  
Tanqueray and tonics my favorite drink  
I dont like anything colored pink  
That just stinksits not for me  
  
It feels like somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something  
  
Blurred vision and dirty thoughts  
Feel out of place very distraught  
Feel something coming on  
  
Kick the jukebox slam the floor  
Drink drink drink drink some more  
I cant think  
Hey Whats in this drink  
  
It feels like somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put somethingin my drinkin my drink  
in my drinkin my drink  
  
So you think its funny  
A college prank  
Goin insane for something to drink  
Feel a little dry  
  
Oh I couldnt care what you think of me  
Cause somebody put something in my drink  
I cant think  
Hey Give me a drink  
  
It feels like somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink
