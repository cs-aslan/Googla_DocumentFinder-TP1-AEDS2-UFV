Hold me tight dont let go  
Forever be yours in this bright new dawn  
Open up your eyes for a big new suprize  
Listen to me now in the bright new dawn  
Fixing whats wrong seeing the people who dont belong we will try to hide are
dispise but it always comes out on the inside  
Corus Nobody said it was easy together we can help change the world come
with me now on this island of love running away from all sivilization Open
your eyes to a bright new dawn  
  
Over all we have done good  
My heart is beating ever so quickly dont shade your eyes from the bright new
dawn
