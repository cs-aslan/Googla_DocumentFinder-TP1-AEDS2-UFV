Punish me  
Punish me  
Straw is gold  
And gold is stone  
You are so big make me small  
Youre the master make me crawl ja  
The lord does give  
The lord does take  
Punish me  
Punish me  
You say yes  
And I say no  
Lock me in all you worship  
Before the winds cold hand grips  
You are so big make me small  
Youre the master make me crawl  
Youre the master make me crawl  
You are so big make me small  
Youre the master make me crawl  
Youre so big you make him small  
You will punish me for all  
The lord does give  
The lord does take  
Does he give love to  
Those he foresakes  
Punish me
