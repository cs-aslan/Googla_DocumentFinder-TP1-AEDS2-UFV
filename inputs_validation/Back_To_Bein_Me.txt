Im back to bein me  
Im back to bein nobody  
The who I was before I was your used to be  
Im back to bein me  
Im back to who I was  
Before I was the one who fell in love  
With the one who never ever was in love  
Im back to bein me  
  
These eyes that used to cry myself to sleep  
Now theyre dry they dont lay me down to weep  
For the first time in a long time I like seeing what I see  
No thanks to you  
Im back to bein me  
  
These eyes that used to cry myself to sleep  
Now theyre dry they dont lay me down to weep  
For the first time in a long time I like seeing what I see  
No thanks to you  
Im back to bein me  
  
Im back to bein me  
Im back to bein nobody  
The who I was before I was your used to be  
Im back to bein me  
Im back to who I was  
Before I was the one who fell in love  
With the one who never ever was in love  
Im back to bein me  
  
Im back to bein me  
Im back to bein me
