When I was small and Christmas trees were tall  
We used to love while others used to play  
Dont ask me why but time has passed us by  
Some one else moved in from far away  
  
Chorus  
Now we are tall and Christmas trees are small  
And you dont ask the time of day  
But you and I our love will never die  
But guess well cry come first of May  
  
The apple tree that grew for you and me  
I watched the apples falling one by one  
And I recall the moment of them all  
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine  
  
Chorus  
  
When I was small and Christmas trees were tall  
Do do do do do do do do do  
Dont ask me why but time has passed us by  
Some one else moved in from far away
