I made a rock n roll sin  
When I tried givin in to  
make money had to turn down low  
They said why be proud dont play so loud  
be like us and get a sound thats real thin  
Wear a polyester suit act happy look cute  
get a haircut and buy small gear  
Thats when I turned to them and said  
hold it right there  
  
Well its more to me than just a job  
and while Im playin you wont get robbed  
Nobody tells a man how to play  
It just aint that way hey hey hey  
Can you hear me say  
  
All men play on ten  
never gonna turn down again  
All men play on ten  
never gonna turn down  
  
Im jet fuel honey plug me into 220  
Step back and let my fingers fly  
While Im burning up my gear  
Theres a fire in your ear  
That wont stop until the day you die  
  
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar  
Oh its music to my ears when they scream  
Then I run back to the power rack  
and deck all of my gear  
  
Well its more to me than just a job  
and while Im playin you wont get robbed  
Nobody tells a man how to play  
It just aint that way hey hey hey  
can you hear me say
