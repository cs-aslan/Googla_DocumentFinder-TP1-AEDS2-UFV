Many a tear has to fall but its all in the game  
All in the wonderful game that we know as love  
You had words with him and your futures looking dim  
But these things your heart cant rise above  
  
Once in a while we wont call but its all in the game  
Soon hell be there at your side with a sweet bouquet  
And hell kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips  
And your heart will fly away  
  
And hell kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips  
And your heart will fly away
