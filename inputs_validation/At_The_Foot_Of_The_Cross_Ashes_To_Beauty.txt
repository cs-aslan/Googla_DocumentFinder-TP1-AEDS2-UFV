At the foot of the cross  
Where grace and suffering meet  
You have shown me your love  
Through the judgment you received  
And youve won my heart  
And youve won my heart now I can  
Trade these ashes in for beauty  
And wear forgiveness like a crown  
Coming to kiss the feet of mercy  
I lay every burden down at the foot of the cross  
At the foot of the cross  
Where I am made complete  
You have given me life  
Through the death you bore for me  
And youve won my heart  
And youve won my heart now I can  
Trade these ashes in for beauty  
And wear forgiveness like a crown  
Coming to kiss the feet of mercy  
I lay every burden down at the foot of the cross  
And wear forgiveness like a crown  
Coming to kiss the feet of mercy  
I lay every burden down at the foot of the cross  
And youve won my heart  
And youve won my heart now I can  
Trade these ashes in for beauty  
And wear forgiveness like a crown  
Coming to kiss the feet of mercy  
I lay every burden down  
I trade these ashes in for beauty  
And wear forgiveness like a crown  
Coming to kiss the feet of mercy  
I lay every burden down  
I lay every burden down every burden  
I lay every burden down  
At the foot of the cross  
At the foot of the cross  
At the foot of the cross  
At the foot of the cross
