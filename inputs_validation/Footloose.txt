Ive been working so hard  
Im punching my card  
Eight hours for what  
Oh tell me what I got  
Ive got this feeling  
That times just holding me down  
Ill hit the ceiling or else  
Ill tear up this town  
  
Now I gotta cut loose  
Footloose kick off the Sunday shoes  
Please Louise pull me off of my knees  
Jack get back come on before we crack  
Lose your blues everybody cut footloose  
  
Youre playing so cool obeying every rule  
Dig a way down in your heart  
Youre burning yearning for some  
Somebody to tell you that life aint passing you by  
Im trying to tell you  
It will if you dont even try  
Youll get by if youd only  
  
Cut loose footloose kick off the Sunday shoes  
Oohwee Marie shake it shake it for me  
Woah Milo come on come on lets go  
Lose your blues everybody cut footloose  
  
You got to turn me around and put your  
Feet on the ground now take the hold of all  
Ah ah ah ah ah  
Im turning you loose  
  
Footloose kick off the Sunday shoes  
Please Louise pull me off of my knees  
Jack get back come on before we crack  
Lose your blues everybody cut footloose footloose  
  
Footloose kick off the Sunday shoes  
Please Louise pull me off of my knees  
Jack get back come on before we crack  
Lose your blues  
Everybody cut everybody cut  
Everybody cut everybody cut  
Everybody cut everybody cut  
Everybody cut everybody cut footloose
