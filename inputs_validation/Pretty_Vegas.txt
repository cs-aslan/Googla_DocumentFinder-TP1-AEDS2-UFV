Fallin asleep at the wheel again baby  
Youre driftin over the line  
Youre hands are tied but youre losin grip quickly  
Fix me can you read the sign  
  
Thumbin your way to Vegas dirty  
Dreamin of the other side  
Save your tears and laughter because  
It doesnt matter what you find  
  
It aint pretty  
After the show  
It aint pretty when the pretty leaves you  
With no place to go  
  
So if you think you need it  
Heres the place to feed it  
It aint pretty  
  
When everything that you do is wrong  
And you  
Feel like you can barely survive  
When those around you  
Are crumblin downwards  
Buried in the sunset of life  
  
Thumbin your way to Vegas dirty  
And screamin like a bitch from hell  
  
Save your dreams  
Up your patience  
Doesnt matter what you sell  
  
It aint pretty  
After the show  
It aint pretty when the pretty leaves you  
With no place to go  
  
So if you think you want it  
Heres the place to get it  
It aint pretty  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
It aint pretty  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Thumbin your way to Vegas dirty  
Dreamin like youre out of control  
Save your tears and laughter  
Because this is the ride  
And this is the show  
  
It aint pretty  
After the show  
It aint pretty when the pretty leaves you  
With no place to go  
  
So if you think you want it  
Just come in and get it  
  
It aint pretty
