Now the day has come  
We are forsaken this time  
  
We lived our lives in our paradise  
as gods we shaped the world around  
No borderlines wed stay behind  
though balance is something fragile  
  
While we thought we were gaining  
we would turn back the tide it still slips away  
Our time has run out our future has died  
theres no more escape  
  
Now the day has come  
we are forsaken  
theres no time anymore  
Life will pass us by  
we are forsaken  
were the last of our kind  
  
The sacrifice was much too high  
our greed just made us all go blind  
We tried to hide what we feared inside  
Today is the end of tomorrow
