Im the one who preys upon the weakest  
And the weakest always preys upon the one whos underneath  
Im the one who doesnt see the waves of human kindness or the tides that  
Turn the day  
Im the one who always turns and looks away  
Turns and looks away  
chorus 1  
Because after all we are only boys  
Because after all we are only boys  
Will be boys will be boys will be boys  
Will be boys will be boys will be boys will be boys  
Will be boys will be boys will be boys  
Will be boys will be boys will be boys  
Will be boys will be boys will be boys  
Im the one treads upon the weaker ones  
Those that I can find  
And therell always be some others who could march along in line yeah  
March along in line  
And well move upon the world in a massive tidal wave  
And well shout and make some noise yeah  
Shout and make some noise  
chorus 1  
chorus 2  
The clowns of death are marching on their hideous parade  
Their glaring eyes are filled with hate but I am not afraid  
Their painted faces cracked with age their makeup old and worn  
With tattered wings and toothy grins to amplify their scorn  
Theyre looking for the helpless ones  
Theyre looking for the misbegotten  
They prey upon the weak and fractured  
The crippled and the freaks of nature  
And when the come upon one whos lost or is alone  
Their smiles get even bigger and their noses start to glow  
Making snarling sounds to pantomime with furious abandon  
And with a scream they pounce to kill and all the while theyre laughing  
Im the one treads upon the weaker ones  
Those that I can find  
And therell always be some others who will march along in line  
And well move upon the world in a massive tidal wave  
And well shout and make some noise yeah  
Shout and make some noise  
chorus 1  
chorus 2  
Your sons and daughters innocent lay sleeping in their beds  
Theyll catch them when youre not around and smash their little heads  
If you think it just a dream or that it isnt fair  
Just look around outside your door the clowns are everywhere
