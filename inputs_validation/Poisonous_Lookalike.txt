I was getting used to you  
You went and changed your tune  
Now youve got me so confused  
I cant tell the salt from the wound  
Didnt they always used to say  
A man aint supposed to cry  
I defy you to look me in the eye  
And tell me youre a friend of mine  
Poisonous lookalike  
Youre not my girl  
Poisonous lookalike  
What have you done with her  
Poisonous lookalike  
Youre not my girl  
Poisonous lookalike  
What have you done with her  
Now it seems to me youre acting strange  
You treat me like a criminal  
You keep telling me  
Ill have to change  
Baby that would take a miracle  
Didnt they always used to say  
A man aint supposed to cry  
I defy you to look me in the eye  
And tell me youre a friend of mine  
Poisonous lookalike  
Youre not my girl  
Poisonous lookalike  
What have you done with her  
Poisonous lookalike  
Youre not my girl  
Poisonous lookalike  
What have you done with her  
Poisonous lookalike  
Little Miss GuntoaKnife fight  
Poisonous lookalike  
Whatre you trying to do  
Poisonous lookalike  
Do you feel all right all right  
Poisonous lookalike  
Whats wrong with you  
Poisonous lookalike  
Youre not my girl  
Poisonous lookalike  
What have you done with her  
Poisonous lookalike  
Youre not my girl  
Poisonous lookalike  
What have you done with her
