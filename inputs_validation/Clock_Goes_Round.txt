The clock goes round and round  
And I get so tired of this old town  
But I still hang around though I know that theres nothing to do  
Seems every monday morning  
Im late for work I get another warning  
I dont think Id stay around here if it wasnt for you  
  
All the friends I had at school  
Went their separate ways  
Some I dont miss some I do  
But when I see them weve got nothing to say  
Every weekday goes so slow  
Weekends go too fast  
Must make up my mind to go  
Before another year goes past  
  
The clock goes round and round  
And I get so tired of this old town  
But I still hang around though I know that theres nothing to do  
Seems every monday morning  
Im late for work I get another warning  
And I dont think Id stay around here if it wasnt for you  
  
Same old faces every night  
Every day it rains  
Repetition drives me crazy  
I just cant stand it all over again  
  
The clock goes round and round  
And I get so tired of this old town  
But I still hang around though I know that theres nothing to do  
  
Im saving my cash to get out of here  
You can come too  
You dont get me down like the others do  
  
Seems to me I wake up bored  
Seven days a week  
I need a chance to speak my mind  
Before Ive got no mind to speak  
Cant believe the friends Ive seen  
Think theyre doing fine  
Its not enough for me  
And I know that Im just wasting time  
  
Because the clock goes round and round  
And I get so tired of this old town  
But I still hang around though I know that theres nothing to do  
Seems every monday morning  
Im late for work I get another warning  
I dont think Id stay around here if it wasnt for you
