I could be your greatest accident  
I could be the blood on your fingertips  
Nothings wrong  
Nothing to regret  
Just want to breathe you in  
  
If this is it  
  
I could be your greatest confidant  
And I could be the head laying on your breast  
Just want to breathe you in  
  
Chorus x2  
The light the love the hope is near  
The weight were under disappears  
If this is it  
  
I could be your greatest accident  
  
Chorus x2
