Here I go again I promised myself I wouldnt think of you today  
Its been seven months and counting  
Youve moved on  
I still feel exactly the same  
Its just that everywhere I go all the buildings know your name  
Like photographs and memories of love  
Steel and granite reminders  
The city calls your name and I cant move on  
  
Ever since youve been gone  
The lights go out the same  
The only difference is  
You call another name  
To your love  
To your lover now  
To your love  
The lover after me  
  
Am I all alone in the universe  
Theres no love on these streets  
I have given mine away to a world that didnt want it anyway  
So this is my new freedom  
Its funny I dont remember being chained  
But nothing seems to make sense anymore  
Without you Im always twenty minutes late  
  
Ever since youve been gone  
The lights go out the same  
The only difference is  
You call another name  
To your love  
To your lover now  
To your love  
The lover after me  
  
And as time goes by so slowly  
The nights are cold and lonely  
I shouldnt be holding on  
But Im still holding on for you  
  
Here I go again I promised myself I wouldnt think of you today  
But Im standing at your doorway  
Im calling out your name because I cant move on  
  
Ever since youve been gone  
The lights go out the same  
The only difference is  
You call another name  
To your love  
To your lover now  
To your love  
The lover after me
