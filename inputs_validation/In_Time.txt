All the words are calling  
Got time on my own  
Theres no destination  
Wondering whether Ill feel it again  
  
Keep my hands off the wheel  
Cause theres nowhere else to go  
  
Take some time  
Just hang around awhile  
Like to sit this silent moment out  
I dont want to lose or let you down  
Times just gonna change itself around  
  
The autumn leaves are falling  
Falling down on me  
And theres nothing I can do  
And theres nothing I can say  
Thats gonna change the way I feel  
  
Keep my hands off the wheel  
Cause theres nowhere else to go  
  
Take some time  
Just hang around awhile  
Like to sit this silent moment out  
I dont want to lose or let you down  
Times just gonna change itself around  
  
Take this time  
Just hang around awhile  
Like to sit this silent moment out  
I dont want to lose or let you down  
Times just gonna change itself  
Change itself around  
  
I feel its true  
All alone without you  
I feel its true  
Cause youre running with the wind  
And youre running with your life  
Wont you come inside  
  
Keep my hands off the wheel  
Cause theres nowhere else to go  
  
Take some time  
Just hang around awhile  
Like to sit this silent moment out  
I dont want to lose or let you down  
Times just gonna change itself around
