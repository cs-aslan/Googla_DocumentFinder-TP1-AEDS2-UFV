And what is it that put America in the forefront of the nuclear nations And
what is it that will make it possible to spend twenty billion dollars of your
money to put some clown on the moon Well it was good old American know how
thats what as provided by good old Americans like Dr Wernher von Braun  
  
Gather round while I sing you of Wernher von Braun  
A man whose allegiance  
Is ruled by expedience  
Call him a Nazi he wont even frown  
Ha Nazi Schmazi says Wernher von Braun  
  
Dont say that hes hypocritical  
Say rather that hes apolitical  
Once the rockets are up who cares where they come down  
Thats not my department says Wernher von Braun  
  
Some have harsh words for this man of renown  
But some think our attitude  
Should be one of gratitude  
Like the widows and cripples in old London town  
Who owe their large pensions to Wernher von Braun  
  
You too may be a big hero  
Once youve learned to count backwards to zero  
In German oder English I know how to count down  
Und Im learning Chinese says Wernher von Braun
