One day in El Paso  
The cops go into the crowd  
Under a glaring bladder of light  
And the music is so loud  
And the tourists take their TShirts off  
A busload of kids gives you the finger  
Afternoon when the sidewalks hot  
And the shadows too chilly to linger  
Walk past damaged goods and ugly trends  
Past a strawman making a purchase  
Downtown where the river bends  
Theyre just waiting for you to resurface  
Take a look at this photograph  
Clearly his teeth were bared  
He coulda been yawning or snarling  
The story was never clear  
  
One night in El Paso  
The cops go into the crowd  
Under a throbbing bladder of light  
And the music is just so loud  
And the tourists turn their TVs off  
And a bat sees a bug with the sound of a linger  
Night time when the shadows cough  
And youre chilled to the tips of your fingers  
Walk past damaged goods and ugly trends  
Past ol strawman making a purchase  
Downtown where the river bends  
Theyre just waiting for you to resurface  
Take a look at this photograph  
Clearly his teeth were bared  
He coulda been yawning or snarling  
He coulda been anywhere
