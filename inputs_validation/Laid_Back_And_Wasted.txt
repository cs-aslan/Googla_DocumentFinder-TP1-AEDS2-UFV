Laid back and wasted driven to drinking a woman aint nothing to lose  
Dont ever doubt it Ill live without it Ill give you the blues  
I spent a lifetime looking for the answers somewhere in search of my soul  
I lost it in Nashville I found it in Austin I sold it in New Mexico  
Ten thousand miles of road dust cant cover the scars that I put on my arm  
And the bridges Im burning will never erase the scars that theyve put on my
heart  
Dying looks easy drifting gets harder I dont know which one to choose  
Dont ever doubt it Ill live without it Ill give you the blues  
Laid back and wasted driven to drinking a woman aint nothing to lose  
Dont ever doubt it Ill live without it Ill give you the blues  
Dont ever doubt it Ill live without it Ill give you the blues
