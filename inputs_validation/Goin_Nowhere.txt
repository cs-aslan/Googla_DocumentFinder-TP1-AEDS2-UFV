Im tired out my head is aching  
I want to shout but I feel Im goin nowhere  
Yeah I feel Im goin nowhere  
Ive run about in a fit of madness  
To work it out in the hope of goin somewhere  
Yeah I hope Im goin somewhere  
  
And I know it must be time for me making up my mind  
Does it matter if Im fine Itll change my tune in time  
If Im really goin nowhere  
  
Im better now Ive thought about it  
Cant figure out but Im looking for it somewhere  
All I know is that its somewhere  
Its closer now than Ive ever had it  
Much closer now so I must be getting somewhere  
Yeah I hope Im getting somewhere  
  
Cause you never know in time with the changing of my mind  
I could turn around and say that was just another day  
Am I really goin nowhere
