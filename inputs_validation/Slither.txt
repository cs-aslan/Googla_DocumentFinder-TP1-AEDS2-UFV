Dont go looking for snakes  
You might find them  
Dont send your eyes to the sun  
You might blind them  
Havent I seen you here before  
Oh  
Watch the puppets dancing  
Yeah  
See the clowns fall down  
Hey  
Tie your tap shoes tightly  
Yeah  
Wear them into town  
See you crawling  
See you crawling  
Dont go looking for snakes  
You might find them  
Dont send your eyes to the sun  
You might blind them  
Havent I seen you here before  
There aint no heroes here

Hey hey hey  
Oh

See you crawling  
See you crawling  
Dont go looking for snakes  
You might find them  
Dont send your eyes to the sun  
You might blind them  
Havent I seen you here before  
Have your heroes disappeared  
See you crawling  
See you crawling  
So dont go looking for snakes  
You might find them  
Dont send your eyes to the sun  
You might blind them  
Havent I seen you here before
