Ask my baby what she wants to be  
Shell say a monkey swingin in a tree  
Ask my baby what shes thinkin of  
Shell say theres nothing greater than love  
  
Well look through the window  
Tell me what do you see  
A beautiful planet  
Peace and harmony  
  
Think love youre surrounded  
We are one you and I  
Gather your leaves together  
Theres only love until we die  
Until we die  
  
Ask my baby what shes goin through  
Shell say the same thing the same thing as you  
Ask my baby what shes thinkin of  
Shell say theres nothing greater than love  
  
Look through the window  
Tell me what do you see  
A beautiful planet  
Peace and harmony  
  
Think love youre surrounded  
We are one you and I  
Gather your leaves together  
Theres only love until we die  
Until we die
