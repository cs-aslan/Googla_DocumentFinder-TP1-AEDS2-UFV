Oh Lillian  
Look what youve done  
Youve stripped my heart  
Ripped it apart  
In the name of fun  
  
Oh Lillian  
Im a poor mans son  
And precious jewels  
Werent found in schools  
Where I came from  
  
Pain and misery always hit the spot  
Knowing you cant lose what you havent got  
  
Oh Lillian  
I should have run  
I should have known  
Each dress you own  
Is a loaded gun  
  
Oh Lillian  
  
Oh Lillian  
I need protection  
I hear your voice  
And any choice I had is gone  
  
Oh Lillian  
Once I begun  
I couldnt stop  
til every drop of blood was sung  
  
Pain and misery always hit the spot  
Knowing you cant lose what you havent got  
  
Oh Lillian  
Look what youve done  
You stripped my heart  
Ripped it apart  
In the name of fun  
  
Oh Lillian  
Oh Lillian  
Oh Lillian  
Oh Lillian
