Oh hello and goodbye  
So fast its gone  
I cant get your face from my mind  
Cant get your eyes from my  
Cant stop your voices  
On that day you told me directions to  
Where I dont know now  
It all flew by me  
So all I can do is hope that you  
Come my way  
Oh and youre nowhere near me  
That youll be there and hope that  
With luck Ill see you again  
  
Oh I didnt get your name  
Nor you mine  
Or the time of day  
But youre stuck on me like a fly on a table  
Oh Im waiting here where we stood for just a moment  
And you stole my way  
And I and I wonder will I see you again  
And way way  
Without the smile the smile that blows away  
The wait is too long  
I want this thing to go on  
And theres no way that I might find you again  
I must walk a way  
  
Im all released by time  
Bump into each other  
It seems so right  
And say hey arent you the  
Werent you the  
Dont you think  
But I dont think its going to happen today  
I fear youll remain a dream  
Rain rain on me yeah yeah yeah  
Your life is burned  
Your life burned into me  
It did it  
Will I ever
