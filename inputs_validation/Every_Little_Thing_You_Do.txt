Hello let me know if you hear me  
Hello if you want to be near let me know  
And Ill never let you go  
  
Hey love  
When you ask what I feel I say love  
When you ask how I know I say trust  
  
And if thats not enough  
  
Its every little thing you do  
That makes me fall in love with you  
There isnt a way that I can show you  
Ever since Ive come to know you  
Its every little thing you say  
That makes me want to feel this  
Theres not a thing that I can point to  
Cause its every little thing you do  
  
Dont ask why  
Lets just feel what we feel cause sometimes  
Its the secret that keeps it alive  
  
But if you need a reason why  
  
Its every little thing you do  
That makes me fall in love with you  
There isnt a way that I can show you  
Ever since Ive come to know you  
Its every little thing you say  
That makes me want to feel this  
Theres not a thing that I can point to  
Cause its every little thing you do  
  
Is it your smile or your laugh or your heart  
Does it really matter why I love you  
Anywhere there a crowd you stand out  
Cant you see why they cant ignore you  
If you want to know  
Why I cant let go  
Let me explain to you  
That every little dream comes true with every little thing you do  
  
Its everything everything you do  
That makes me fall in love with you  
Its everything everything you say  
That makes me feel this way
