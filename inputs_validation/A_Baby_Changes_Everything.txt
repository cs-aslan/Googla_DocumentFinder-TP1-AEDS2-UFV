Teenage girl much too young  
Unprepared for whats to come  
A baby changes everything  
  
Not a ring  
On her hand  
All her dreams and all her plans  
A baby changes everything Repeat x2  
  
The man she loves shes never touched  
How will she Keep his trust  
A baby changes everything Repeat x2  
  
And she cries oh she cries  
  
She has to leave go far away  
Heaven knows she cant stay  
A baby changes everything  
  
She can feel its coming soon  
Theres no place theres no room  
A baby changes everything Repeat x2  
  
And she cries and she cries O she cries  
  
Shepherds own they got their  
Star shines down  
  
Choir of Angels say  
Glory to the newborn king  
A baby changes everything Repeat x2  
Everything everything every day  
Hallelujah Repeat x4  
  
My whole life is turned around  
I was lost and now Im found  
A baby changes everything Repeat x2
