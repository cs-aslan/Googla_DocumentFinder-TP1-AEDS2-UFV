Last night I came home  
And I knocked on my door  
And I called to my love  
As I often had before  
And I knocked and I knocked  
But no answer there came  
No kisses to greet me  
No voice called my name  
And I couldnt believe it was true  
Oh Lord I couldnt believe it was true  
And my eyes filled with tears  
And I must have aged ten years  
And I couldnt believe it was true  
  
The shock was so great  
I am quivering yet  
Ill try to forgive  
But I cannot forget  
My heartbreaking loss  
Is another mans gain  
And her happiness always  
I hope will remain  
And I couldnt believe it was true  
Oh Lord I couldnt believe it was true  
And my eyes filled with tears  
And I must have aged ten years  
And I couldnt believe it was true
