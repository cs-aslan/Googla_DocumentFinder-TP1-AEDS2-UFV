You know and I know my clone sleeps alone  
Shes out on her own forever  
Shes programmed to work hard shes never profane  
She wont go insane not ever  
No vd no cancer on TVs the answer  
No father no mother shes just like the other  
And you know and I know my clone sleeps alone  
  
Your clone loves my clone but yours cannot see  
Thats no way to be in heaven  
No sorrow no heartache just clone harmony  
So obviously its heaven  
  
No naughty clone ladies allowed in the eighties  
No bed names no sex games just clone names and clone games  
And you know and I know my clone sleeps alone  
  
Before we existed the cloning began  
The cloning of man and woman  
When were gone theyll live on cloned endlessly  
Its mandatory in heaven  
  
But they wont remember or ever be tender  
No loving no caring no program for pairing  
No vd no cancer on Tvs the answer  
No father no mother shes just like the other  
  
No naughty clone ladies allowed in the eighties  
And you know and I know my clone sleeps alone  
My clone sleeps alone  
My clone sleeps alone
