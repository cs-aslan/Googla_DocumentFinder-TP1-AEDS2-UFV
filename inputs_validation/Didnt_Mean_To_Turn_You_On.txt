When you took me out  
I knew what you were all about  
But when I did  
I guess I turned you on  
  
Now I bring you home  
You told me goodnights not enough for you  
Im sorry baby  
I didnt mean to turn you on  
No I didnt mean to turn you on  
  
You read me wrong  
I wasnt trying to lead you on  
Not like you think  
I didnt mean to turn you on  
  
I know you  
Were expecting a one night stand  
When I refused  
I knew you wouldnt understand  
  
I told you twice  
I was only trying to be nice  
Only trying to be nice  
Ooh I didnt mean to turn you on  
  
Babe now why should I  
Feel guilty cause I wont give  
Guilty cause I wont give in  
I didnt mean to turn you on  
Ooh I didnt mean to turn you on  
  
When I took you out  
Iknew what you were all about  
But when I did  
I didnt mean to turn you on  
No I didnt mean to turn you on  
  
I didnt mean to turn you on  
I didnt mean to turn you on
