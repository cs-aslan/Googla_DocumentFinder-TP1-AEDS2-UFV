Told my little Pollyanna  
Theres a place for you and me  
Well go down to Transverse City  
Life is cheap and Death is free  
  
Past the condensation silos  
Past the allnight trauma stand  
Well be there before tomorrow  
Pollyanna take my hand  
  
Show us endless neon vistas  
Castles made of laser lights  
Take us to the shopping sector  
In the vortex of the night  
  
Past the shiny mylar towers  
Past the ravaged tenements  
To a place we cant remember  
For a time we wont forget  
  
Heres the hum of desperation  
Heres the test tube mating call  
Heres the latest carbon cycle  
Heres the clergy of the mall  
  
Heres the song of shear and torsion  
Heres the bloodbath magazine  
Heres the harvest of contusions  
Heres the narcoleptic dream  
  
Told my little Pollyanna  
Heres a place where we can stay  
We have come to see tomorrow  
We have given up today  
  
Down among the dancing quanta  
Everything exists at once  
Up above in Transverse City  
Every weekend lasts for months  
  
Heres the hum of desperation  
Heres the test tube mating call  
Heres the latest carbon cycle  
Heres the clergy of the mall  
  
Heres the witness and the victim  
Heres the relatives remains  
Heres the wellknown double helix  
Heres the poisoned waves of grain  
  
Heres the song of shear and torsion  
Heres the bloodbath magazine  
Heres the harvest of contusions  
Heres the narcoleptic dream  
  
Heres the hum of desperation
