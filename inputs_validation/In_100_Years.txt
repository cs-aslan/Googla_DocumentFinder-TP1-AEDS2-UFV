Outside the gates of heaven  
Oh there lives a unicorn  
I close my eyes to seven  
Oh this world is not my home  
A broken heart in danger  
And a pillow filled with tears  
Oh can you see the strangers  
In the pain and in the fears  
Can you feel my heart  
Baby dont give up  
Can you feel my love tonight  
  
In one hundred years  
Love is illegal  
In a hundred years from now  
In a hundred years  
Love is illegal in this lonely heartbreak town  
In a hundred years  
Love is illegal  
All your dreams will die  
In a hundred years  
Love is illegal  
And your hope will not survive  
  
LOVE  
Love is illegal in my heart  
Hear my heart is beating  
LOVE  
Love is illegal in my heart  
Hear my heart is beating  
  
Youre looking through a fire  
Computers everywhere  
Oh youre a shotgun rider  
Controllers here and there  
And you read old love letters  
Drowning in the sea  
Oh baby it doesnt matter  
Oh youve lost all what you feel  
Can you feel my heart  
Baby dont give up  
Can you feel my love tonight
