In the eyes of the world hes only an ordinary man  
But theres a million and one things the eyes of the world never see  
He may walk the same  
He may talk the same  
As a million others do  
Oh but youd see him as I do if his heart had eyes for you  
  
Chorus Repeat x2  
Hes only everything  
Only everything  
Hes as real as the thrill I feel  
When he walks through my dreams  
Hes the one I hold  
When my world grows cold  
And needs a touch of spring  
Or a song to sing  
Yes in these eyes of mine  
Lord hes only everything  
  
Yes in these eyes of mine  
Lord hes only everything
