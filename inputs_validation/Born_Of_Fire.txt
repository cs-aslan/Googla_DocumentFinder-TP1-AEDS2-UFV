Join in my quest to leave life overturned  
Spanning the world wave of doom  
Spewing out death with the evil Ive churned  
Awaken the dead from their tomb  
Love turns to lust the sensations Ive felt  
Exploring the pleasures of sin  
Making the best of the cards Ive been dealt  
Adjusting the odds so I win  
  
Unleash all my burning wrath  
Potential killing machine  
Take down all who block my path  
Enjoying all thats obsceneborn of fire  
  
Prince of all darkness initiation  
Ritually baptized in flames  
Next to the throne my abomination  
Spreads horror throughout the domain  
Master the art that controls the impure  
Inherit the infamous keys  
Thousands of centuries I will endure  
Tyrant of all the prophecies  
  
Some have called me Satans son  
A name I cannot deny  
Wielding fury thats second to none  
Far too vile to confine born of fire  
  
All things dead must rise again  
When twilights blanket falls  
Splattered red youll find my den  
Blood dripping from the walls  
  
Dreams born of desire  
Shaped and forged within the fire  
Twisted warped deranged I see  
The worlds corrupt insanity  
  
Dreams possess nightmarish figures  
Burning cant escape the embers  
Lost are those who trust the Liar  
Satans son Im born of fire
