Its a bit hard to take  
But all good things must end  
Y know its sad but its true  
I know my heart will ache  
And it will take time to mend  
But its something Ive got to do  
Cause I owe it all to you  
  
Chorus  
Its not over yet  
Its a new beginning  
I just gotta say Im grateful for the time weve had  
Its not over yet  
Its a brand new start  
All I need to say is thank you  
From the bottom of my heart  
  
I need some time alone  
A little moment of silence  
So I can figure out where to go  
Dont know what comes and thats the beauty of tomorrow  
Theres so many things to find  
All I need is time  
  
Its not over yet  
Its a new beginning  
I just gotta say Im grateful for the time weve had  
Its not over yet  
Its a brand new start  
All I need to say is thank you  
From the bottom of my heart  
  
I take a long last look around  
Every moment every sound  
Its all been worth fighting for  
Just because we close the door  
Doesnt mean its over yet  
  
Its a new beginning  
And I just gotta say Im grateful for the time weve had  
Its not over yet  
Its a brand new start  
I just go to say im grateful  
For each and every day  
  
Its not over yet For each and every day  
Its a new beginning For each and every day  
I just gotta say Im grateful for the time weve had The time weve had  
Its not over yet  
Its a new beginning The time weve had  
All I need to say is thank you  
From the bottom of my heart  
  
From the bottom of my heart
