It seems Ive walked along this road before  
Past dreams and quite memories  
You know Ive heard some of the sweetest sounds  
From voices that carry  
And theyre calling you back to my arms  
And Im holding back the tears  
They say that the road goes on forever  
But Im going nowhere without you  
You left aboard the run away wind  
And left me standing all alone  
You travelled far and I travelled slow  
I turned around and youd gone  
And I wish I was back in your arms  
Holding on to all our dreams  
And so the road might go on forever  
But Im nowhere without you  
If you give a song that Im now singing  
Hold on to every word  
Dont let the times we had slip through  
If you look youll find that Im still waiting for you  
Til they sing a sad sweet Chorus and the final curtain falls  
And I wish I was back in your arms  
Holding on to all our dreams  
You know that the road might go on forever  
But Im nowhere without you  
Nowhere without you
