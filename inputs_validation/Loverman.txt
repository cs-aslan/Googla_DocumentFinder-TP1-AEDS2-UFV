Theres a devil waiting outside your door  
How much longer  
Theres a devil waiting outside your door  
It is bucking and braying and pawing at the floor  
And hes howling with pain and crawling up the walls  
Theres a devil waiting outside your door  
Hes weak with evil and broken by the world  
Hes shouting your name and hes asking for more

Theres a devil crawling along your floor

With a trembling heart hes coming through your door  
With his straining sex in his jumping paw  
Theres a devil crawling along your floor  
And hes old and hes stupid and

And hes lame and hes blind  
And hes dirty and hes poor
