Sit you down sit you down young gentlemen  
Theres something I want you to know  
You keep on asking me keep on asking me why  
Oh why are we here It started a long time ago  
Me and your mom on the night yeah yeah yeah we met  
  
I was on the road again she was in C79  
Ill never never forget Ill never forget that night  
No no no no  
  
We met in a back road behind the stage  
She had the best figure by far  
A thousand hours Ive looked at her eyes  
But I still dont know what color they are  
Yeah me and your mom on the night good lord we met  
  
I was on the road again she was in C79  
She was a junkie then I was having a good time  
Back on the road again  
  
Oh momma I was on the road again she was in C79  
Ill never never forget Ill never forget that time  
Back on the road again yes Im traveling that line  
I was a pop star then Im still having a good time  
  
She believed me
