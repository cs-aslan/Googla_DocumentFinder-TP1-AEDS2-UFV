Intro  
March along sing our song with the Army of the free  
Count the brave count the true who have fought to victory  
Were the Army and proud of our name  
Were the Army and proudly proclaim  
  
First to fight for the right  
And to build the Nations might  
And The Army Goes Rolling Along  
Proud of all we have done  
Fighting till the battles won  
And the Army Goes Rolling Along  
  
Then its Hi Hi Hey  
The Armys on its way  
Count off the cadence loud and strong Two Three  
For where eer we go  
You will always know  
That The Army Goes Rolling Along  
  
Valley Forge Custers ranks  
San Juan Hill and Pattons tanks  
And the Army went rolling along  
Minute men from the start  
Always fighting from the heart  
And the Army keeps rolling along  
  
Then its Hi Hi Hey  
The Armys on its way  
Count off the cadence loud and strong Two Three  
For where eer we go  
You will always know  
That The Army Goes Rolling Along  
  
Men in rags men who froze  
Still that Army met its foes  
And the Army went rolling along  
Faith in God then were right  
And well fight with all our might  
As the Army keeps rolling along  
  
Then its Hi Hi Hey  
The Armys on its way  
Count off the cadence loud and strong Two Three  
For where eer we go  
You will always know  
That The Army Goes Rolling Along
