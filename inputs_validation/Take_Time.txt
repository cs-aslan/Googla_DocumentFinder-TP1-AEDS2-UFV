You can have it if you really want  
You can grasp it if you have the thought  
Feel your power that is deep within  
Are you ready   
  
On your mark begin  
We should take time out to really love  
We should find out who we really are  
We should take time out to really love  
  
Do you feel your lifes a big mistake   
Dont you hate the way its all so fake   
All I want to do is just be real  
And get off of the spinning wheel  
  
All they sell us is a pack of lies  
And were buying one in every size  
Cant you see it in the childrens eyes   
Its about to get wild  
  
We should take time out to really love  
We should find out who we really are  
We should take time out to really love  
Ha yeah  
  
We should take time out to really love  
We should find out who we really are  
We should take time out to really love  
We should take time out to really love  
  
We should find out who we really are  
You can have it any way you want it  
You can have it any way you want it  
We should take time out to really love  
  
We should find out who we really are  
You can have it any way you want it  
You can have it any way you want it  
We should take time out to really love  
  
We should find out who we really are  
You can have it any way you want it  
Any you want it  
You can have it any way you want it  
  
Hey hey  
We should take time out to really love  
We should find out who we really are  
You can have it any way you want it
