You might think youve peeped the scene  
You havent  
The real one is far to mean  
The wattered down the one you know  
Was made up centuries ago  
They it sound all wack and corny  
Yes its awful blasted boring  
Twisted fiction sick addiction  
Well gather round children  
Zip it listen  
  
Can we get much higher  
So high  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Can we get much higher  
So high  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Can we get much higher  
So high  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Can we get much higher  
So high  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I fantasized about this back in Chicago  
Mercy mercy me that Murcielago  
Thats me the first year that I blow  
How you say broke in Spanish Me no hablo  
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo  
Me found bravery in my bravado  
DJs need to listen to the models  
You aint got no fuckin Yeezy in your Serato  
You aint got no Yeezy nigga  
Stupid but what the fuck do I know  
Im just a Chitown nigga with a Nas flow  
And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo  
So much head I woke up to Sleepy Hollow  
  
Can we get much higher  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion  
Sex is on fire Im the King of Leon and Louis  
Beyond the truest  
Hey teacher teacher  
Tell me how do you respawn the students  
And refresh the page and restart the memory  
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy  
We stopped the ignorance we killed the enemies  
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me  
The plan was to drink until the pain over  
But whats worse the pain or the hangover  
Fresh air rolling down the window  
Too many Urkels on your team thats why your wins low  
Dont make me pull the toys out huh  
Dont make me pull the toys  
And fire up the engines huh  
And then they make noise  
  
Can we get much higher So high  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
At the mall there was a seance  
Just kids no parents  
Then the sky filled with heroines  
I saw the devil In a Chrysler LeBaron  
And the hell it wouldnt spare us  
And the fires did declare us  
But after that took pills kissed an heiress  
And moved her back in Paris  
  
Can we get much higher So high  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh  
  
Can we get much higher So high  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Can we get much higher So high  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Can we get much higher So high  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Can we get much higher So high  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
