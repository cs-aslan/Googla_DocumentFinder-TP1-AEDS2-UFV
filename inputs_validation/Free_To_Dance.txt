This song in my heart  
This song in my soul  
This song I was born to sing  
Its Your song of freedom  
Now Im free to dance again  
Ill sing in the darkness  
Ill laugh in the rain  
Rejoice in Your love again  
Its Your song of freedom  
Now Im free to dance again  
Your spirit brings me liberty  
Your breath of life has set me free  
This song in my heart  
This song in my soul  
This song I was born to sing  
Its Your song of freedom  
Now Im free to dance again  
Ill sing in the darkness  
Ill laugh in the rain  
Rejoice in Your love again

Now Im free to dance again  
Your spirit brings me liberty  
Your breath of life has set me free  
Jesus Your love it lifts me high
