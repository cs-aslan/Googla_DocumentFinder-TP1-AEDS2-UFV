And the hardest part  
Was letting go not taking part  
Was the hardest part  
  
And the strangest thing  
Was waiting for that bell to ring  
It was the strangest start  
  
I could feel it go down  
Bittersweet I could taste in my mouth  
Silver lining the cloud  
Oh and I  
I wish that I could work it out  
  
And the hardest part  
Was letting go not taking part  
You really broke my heart  
  
And I tried to sing  
But I couldnt think of anything  
And that was the hardest part  
  
I could feel it go down  
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth  
Youre silver lining the clouds  
Oh and I  
Oh and I  
I wonder what its all about  
I wonder what its all about  
  
Everything I know is wrong  
Everything I do its just comes undone  
And everything is torn apart  
  
Oh and its the part  
Thats the hardest part  
Yeah thats the hardest part  
Thats the hardest part
