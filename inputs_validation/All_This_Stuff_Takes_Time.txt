Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
  
It aint so much the boredom  
But the fire in her soul  
That made her life unbearable  
While living in that hole  
Of her dark surburban nightmare  
Till she went to see the Dead  
And the self esteem she valued  
Was immediately spent  
And she had no one to turn to  
So she just turned off her mind  
Shes a well adjusted wanderer  
But all this stuff takes time  
  
On the streets of old Wyoming  
Theres a couple from LA  
They are postenvironmentalists  
Looking for to stay  
Till their friends all come to join them  
In the quest for air to breathe  
And when it gets too crowded  
They will just pick up and leave  
Like they did in New York City  
When the coast seemed quite sublime  
It dont take much but money  
And money just takes time  
  
Marie is on the lounge chair  
Draped around the pool  
Avoiding almost anyone whod  
Desecrate he cool  
Its the reason shes attractive  
Shes already self abused  
And her pride wont feel the loneliness  
That comes with being used  
Shes the center of the universe  
For which she was designed  
Until she wakes up wandering  
Why all this stuff takes time  
  
Bill died of a heart attack  
Beating up his wife  
Now hes come back as a lesbian  
Thats looking for his wife  
Who is now a psychoanalyst  
That likes to work with plants  
Except of course on weekends  
When she likes to wear the pants  
Shes a leather goddess minister  
Who works with the confined  
It dont take much to realize  
That all this stuff takes time
