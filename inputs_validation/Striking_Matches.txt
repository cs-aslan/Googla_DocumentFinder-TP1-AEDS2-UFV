Striking matches and Im smoking cigarettes  
Putting on the kettle playing a cassette  
Folding up the papers rubbing my eyes  
Thinking of all that had happened last night  
The passion the feelings that soaked in her love  
And the pools of silence when kisses were sprung  
Her love levitates me Im walking on air  
Two feet from the carpet Ill always be there  
Oh Im striking matches its morning again  
I look in the mirror i still look the same  
Im striking matches its morning again  
I look in the mirror i go up in flames  
  
Striking matches getting a flame on the stove  
Theres some of her in the teeth of my comb  
Dirty clothes piled up on the bathroom floor  
Shes silently sleeping i half close the door  
I see her beauty laying on my bed  
Im warm from within me with what she has said  
Her love is my balloon i wont let it down  
For ever and ever Ill always be proud  
  
Im a director casting for a part  
turn on the light  
Its for a soap set here right in my heart  
leave her alone  
Shuffle to the window shuffle to the door  
dont wake her up  
She gets the part i dont want to see anymore  
unplug the phone
