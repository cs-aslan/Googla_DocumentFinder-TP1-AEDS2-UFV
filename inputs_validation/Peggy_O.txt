As we rode out to Fennario as we rode on to Fennario  
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove  
And called her by a name pretty PeggyO  
Will you marry me pretty PeggyO will you marry me pretty PeggyO  
  
If you will marry me Ill set your cities free  
And free all the ladies in the areaO  
I would marry you sweet WilliamO I would marry you sweet WilliamO  
I would marry you but your guineas are too few  
  
And I fear my mama would be angryO  
What would your mama think pretty PeggyO  
What would your mama think pretty PeggyO  
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink  
  
Saw me marching at the head of my soldiers  
If ever I return pretty PeggyO if ever I return pretty PeggyO  
If ever I return your cities I will burn  
Destroy all the ladies in the areaO  
  
Come steppin down the stairs pretty PeggyO  
Come steppin down the stairs pretty PeggyO  
Come steppin down the stairs combin back your yellow hair  
Bid a last farewell to your WilliamO  
  
Sweet William he is dead pretty PeggyO  
Sweet William he is dead pretty PeggyO  
Sweet William he is dead and he died for a maid  
And hes buried in the Louisiana countryO  
  
As we rode out to Fennario as we rode out to Fennario  
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove  
And called her by a name pretty PeggyO
