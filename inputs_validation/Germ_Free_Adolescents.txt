I know shes antiseptic her deodorant smells nice Id like to get to know you
But youre deep frozen like the ice Shes a germ free adolescent Cleanliness
is her obsession She cleans her teeth ten times a day Scrub away scrub away
scrub away The SR way You may get to know her If your gloves are
sterilised Rinse your mouth with listerine Blow disinfectant in her eyes Her
phobia is infection She needs one to survive Its her builtin protection
Without fear shed give up and die
