Lisa says that its all right  
When she meets me at midnight  
Lisa says that she has her fun  
And shell do it with just about anyone  
  
Lisa says

Lisa says that shes on the run  
Looking for a special one  
Lisa says that every time she makes it straight  
She knows her heart will break  
  
Lisa says

Looking for a party some action  
Gone to make it feel okay  
But what do you mind where the time must come on down  
Look at it all
