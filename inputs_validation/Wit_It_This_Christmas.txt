Verse 1  
Come and kiss me baby  
We dont need no mistletoe  
We dont need no fireplace  
Boy Ill keep you nice and warm  
  
PreChorus  
Are you down for some of these milk and cookies  
Down for loving youll be my drummer boy  
And Im the only drum that you gonna play  
Tis the season for some love giving  
So I think you should give your love to me  
Baby let me know  
  
Chorus  
Are you with it Are you with it  
Are you with it this Christmas Baby let me know  
Are you with it Are you with it  
Are you with it this Christmas  
  
Verse 2  
We dont need no presents we dont need the kitchen  
We dont need them recipes  
You know Im tasty like a candy cane or gingerbread  
Im made with love  
  
PreChorus  
Are you down for some of these milk and cookies  
Down for loving youll be my drummer boy  
And Im the only drum that you gonna play  
Tis the season for some love giving  
So I think you should give your love to me  
Baby let me know  
  
Chorus  
Are you with it Are you with it  
Are you with it this Christmas Baby let me know  
Are you with it Are you with it  
Are you with it this Christmas
