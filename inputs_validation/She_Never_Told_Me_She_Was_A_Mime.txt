When we first met she seemed perfectly normal  
I never dreamed shed make my life so hard  
You see my baby she started to change  
Started lookin kinda strange  
Wearin all that white makeup and those black leotards  
Well I guess she kept her little secret pretty well  
Now ever since I learned the horrible truth you know my life has been a
living hell  
Thats right you see  
  
She never told me she was a mime  
She never told me she was a mime oh no  
Actin like shes trapped inside a big glass box all the time  
She never told me she never told me whe was a  
Mamamamamamamamamamamamamamime  
  
I wish we both could just talk it all over  
But my baby wont even make a sound  
Now she makes everybody sick  
Doin that pantomime shtick  
Even our old friends have stopped coming around  
Well mmy parents cant stand her and our neighbors hate her guts  
Shes really really embarrassing me this silent treatments driving me
nuts  
You see  
  
She never told me she was a mime  
She never told me she was a mime oh no  
Now shes actin like shes trapped inside a big glass box all the time
what a crime  
She never told me she never told me she never told me she was a mime  
  
She walks against the wind everywhere we go  
Stops at every corner gotta put on a show  
Carries round a picture of Marcel Marceau  
Always the wuiet type but how was I know to know  
  
She never told me she was a mime  
She never told me she was a mime oh no  
Actin like shes trapped inside a big glass box all the tiyiyiyiyiyi
yime  
She never told me she never told me whe was a mime
