Let me be before the world  
What I am when Im alone  
And when my vision falls below  
Let there be forgiveness  
  
Let me answer when Im called  
Let me know the voice is right  
And when its deep inside my soul  
Ill know it by its light  
  
And when its deep inside my soul  
Ill know it by its light  
Help me to make the loving choice  
  
Let me answer when Im called  
By the mighty and the small  
In the service of my soul  
Let there always be forgiveness  
Forgive
