If we move in together  
Will I still be a slob  
Will things get ordinary  
Will I piss you off  
Cause I dont cook  
I throw my clothes on the floor  
And I mix the darks and whites  
  
Oh baby your kisses are pure  
And the sex lasts for hours  
You want me more the less I shower  
Im a sight for sore eyes  
In your old tightywhities  
But you love me anyway  
You love me anyway  
  
I thank God for seeing the light  
And not going out with some lawyertype  
Cause youre a poet  
A Renaissance man  
A little boy with really strong hands  
  
Chorus  
So many things going through my mind  
Sometimes it gets scary  
But when youre by my side  
The world may be chaotic  
And the skies may explode  
But well be okay baby  
This much I know  
And the minuet between the heart and the breath  
Is my lullaby  
And the minuet between the heart and the breath  
Is gonna rock me every time  
And the minuet between the heart and the breath  
Will save my life  
  
As I lay upon your chest baby Im satisfied  
Id like to have babies with you  
Like to have maybe two  
Join a carpool and sing the kids to bed  
They can have your colouring and  
My movie rental addiction  
They can be antisocial just like us and  
They can choose their very own religion  
They can climb into bed in the  
Middle of the night and  
Sleep in your arms as if hypnotized  
  
Chorus  
  
Alright  
Everythings gonna be alright  
So if all the things we want  
Are just out of reach  
We move to the midWest  
And you start to teach  
Im a woulda coulda shoulda  
A one hit wonder  
Im pretty sure well be okay  
Cause if the skin on your chest  
Still feels that way  
From the sandalwood oil  
That you dab in the middle  
I think just maybe maybe baby  
Wed miss it a little
