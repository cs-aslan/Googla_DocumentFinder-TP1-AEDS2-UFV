When I was younger so much younger than today yeah  
Never needed anybodys help in anyway  
Now those days are gone and Im not so self assured  
Now I find Ive changed my mind Ive opened up the doors  
Help me if you can Im feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being around  
Oh help me get my feet back on the ground  
Wont you please please help me  
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways  
My independence seems to vanish in the haze  
Every now and then I feel so insecure  
And now that I just need you like I never did before  
Oh help me if you can Im feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being around  
Oh help me get my feet back on the ground  
Wont you please please help me
