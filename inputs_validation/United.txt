Look around  
Theyre moving in  
Hold your ground  
When they begin  
  
We can do it  
We can do it and if they wanna they can try  
But theyll never get near  
Then they can get out of here  
  
Gonna keep on driving  
Never stop

Dont give in  
Make a stand

We can do it  
We can do it and if they wanna they can try  
But theyll never get near  
Then they can get out of here  
  
Gonna keep on driving  
Never stop
