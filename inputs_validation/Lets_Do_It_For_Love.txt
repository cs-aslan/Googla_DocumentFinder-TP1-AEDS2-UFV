I love you with everything thats in me  
Did you know that  
Youll be the first thats ever been so close  
You should know that  
Ive been loving you since the beginning  
For what its worth Ive always been waiting for this moment  
  
One special night for one special girl  
Lets make love like its our last day on Earth  
With everything I am I promise it will be  
Much sweeter than you ever could dream  
Lets do it tonight baby  
Lets do it for love  
  
Never had a reason to believe that love would find me  
It mustve known something that I didnt know  
And you showed me that if I had a chance to go to heaven  
Girl Id stay here cause nothing could make me miss this moment  
  
One special night for one special girl  
Lets make love like its our last day on Earth  
With everything I am I promise it will be  
Much sweeter than you ever could dream  
Lets do it tonight baby  
Lets do it for love  
  
I cant think of any place Id rather be than here with you  
When I hold you close to me feeling every bound of your heartbeat baby  
Its the way you look into my eyes  
That lets me know just what you wish its for a night like this  
  
One special night for one special girl  
Lets make love like its our last day on Earth  
With everything I am I promise it will be  
Much sweeter than you ever could dream  
Lets do it tonight baby  
Lets do it for love  
  
  
Lets do it tonight baby  
Lets do it for love
