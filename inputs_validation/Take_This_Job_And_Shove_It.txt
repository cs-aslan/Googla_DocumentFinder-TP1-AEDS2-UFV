Take this job and shove it  
I aint working here no more  
My woman done left and  
Took all the reasons  
I was working for  
You better not try to stand in my way  
Cause Im walkin out the door  
Take this job and shove it  
I aint working here no more  
  
I been workin in this factory  
For nigh on fifteen years  
All this time I watched my woman  
Drownin in a sea of tears  
And I seen a lot of good folks die  
That had a lot of bills to pay  
Id give the shirt right offa my back  
If I had the nerve to say  
  
Take this job and shove it  
I aint working here no more  
My woman done left and  
Took all the reasons  
I was workin for  
You better not try to stand in my way  
Cause Im walkin out the door  
Take this job and shove it  
I aint workin here no more  
  
That foreman hes a regular dog  
The line boss hes a fool  
Hes got a flattop haircut  
Man he thinks hes cool  
One of these days Im gonna blow my top  
And that sucker hes gonna pay  
And I just cant seem to wait  
Till I get the nerve to say  
  
Take this job and shove it  
I aint working here no more  
My woman done left and  
Took all the reasons  
I was workin for  
You better not try to stand in my way  
Cause Im walkin out the door  
Take this job and shove it  
I aint workin here no more  
  
Take this job and shove it  
I aint working here no more  
My woman done left and  
Took all the reasons  
I was workin for  
You better not try to stand in my way  
Cause Im walkin out the door  
Take this job and shove it  
I aint workin here no more  
  
Take this job and shove it
