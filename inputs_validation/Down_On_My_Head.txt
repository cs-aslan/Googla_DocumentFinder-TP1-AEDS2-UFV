I work all night  
For one more day that I can say Im all alone alone  
I just need time  
And I will say what I believe and Ill come home home  
And all I know  
  
Chorus  
I never thought I would wake up in bed  
Watching the world coming down on my head  
Id sleep like a dog if you would never had said  
This is the world coming down on your head  
  
As life flies by  
Im not sure how Im gonna do this all again again  
So write my line  
I write this down and Im just trying to find the end the end  
And all I know  
  
Chorus  
  
You gave it to me  
I remember it well  
You got the world coming down on your head  
Theres nothing to fight for its already dead  
And this is the world coming down on my head  
  
Chorus  
  
Im not gonna swallow now that Im fed  
cause I want the world coming down on my head  
Im just gonna find out youre already dead  
And that was the world coming down on your head
