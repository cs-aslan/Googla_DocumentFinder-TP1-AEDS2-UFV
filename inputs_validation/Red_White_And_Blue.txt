When Im far away  
And I cant get through  
Wherever I roam  
Keeps bringing me back to you  
  
Holding on to hope  
Theres no need to fear  
Wherever I roam  
This piece of home  
Keeps telling you that Im near  
  
So lift up your heart  
Cause the brave will always come through  
While were apart  
We will raise the red white and blue  
  
When I stand alone  
Without you by my side  
I think of all  
That you stand for  
It fills me up with pride  
  
Reaching out to you  
Across mountains sea and sky  
I think of all  
That you stand for  
And hope will never die  
  
Now Im coming home again  
Im coming home to you  
And as I roam  
This piece of home  
Has brought me back to you
