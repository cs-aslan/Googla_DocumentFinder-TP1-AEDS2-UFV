I have tried to forget about you and all the plans that we had planned  
Yes and Im bound to leave this town I dont care where I may land  
  
If what theyre telling me is true you have found somebody new to love you  
There aint but one thing I can do baby  
To save my heart from being broken in two by you baby Im moving through  
  
Theres nothing like a hundred miles between me and trouble in my mind  
Theres nothing like a hundred miles show me the yellow line  
Theres nothing like a hundred miles when Im only passing through  
Theres nothing like a hundred miles to make me forget about you forget about
you  
  
Now dont we like our found farewells  
And dont we like to keep our goodbyes nice and clean  
You may wish Id go to hell while you tell me what a pleasure its been  
So long baby Im moving on  
  
Theres nothing like a hundred miles between me and trouble in mind  
Theres nothing like a hundred miles show me the yellow line  
Theres nothing like a hundred miles when Im only passing through  
Theres nothing like a hundred miles to make me forget about you forget about
you  
  
I have tried to forget about you And baby I have failed  
But just as long as I stay in Houston I will
