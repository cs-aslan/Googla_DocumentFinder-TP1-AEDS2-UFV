Drifting drifting drifting away  
I got myself a mansion then I gave it away  
Its not the world thats heavy its just the things that you save  
And Im drifting drifting away  
Drifting drifting drifting along  
I rid myself of worries and my worries were gone  
I only run when I want to and I sleep like a dog  
Im drifting drifting along  
The suit coats say there is money to be made  
They get so excited nothing gets in their way  
My road it may be lonely just because its not paved  
Its good for drifting drifting away  
All the suit coats say there is money to be made  
They get so excited nothing gets in their way  
My road it may be lonely just because its not paved  
Its good for drifting drifting away  
Drifting drifting drifting uh huh  
I feel like going back there but never for long  
I sometimes wonder if they know that Im gone  
Im drifting drifting along  
Drifting drifting along drifting drifting along
