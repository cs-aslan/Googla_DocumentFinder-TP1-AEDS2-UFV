From birth to five youre learning  
From five to ten youre playing  
By the time youre fifteen  
Youre never wrong  
But then you turn around  
And its all gone your childhood  
  
Now daddy knows what hes saying  
Youre in my arms and Im praying  
That Ill be given the strength and time  
To make yours just as happy as mine  
Your childhood  
  
Every morning  
Your crying ends my sleep  
I kid on Im angry  
But its not a feeling I can keep  
Theres no light outside  
I dont care cause I know its true  
That in our house  
The sun shines out of you  
Youve got your mothers looks  
Yourre a beautiful little girl  
Youll break boys hearts  
All over this world  
Then one day youll walk out the door  
And I know youll break mine  
Youll break mine  
  
From birth to five youre learning  
From five to ten youre playing  
By the time youre fifteen youre never wrong  
But then you turn around and its all gone  
Your childhood  
  
So youre trying to talk  
Any day now youll walk  
Youll be running around  
Make me act like a clown  
cause I live and I breathe  
For my little girl  
Our little girl  
The most important thing is this whole wide world  
Now daddy know what hes saying  
Your in my arms and Im praying  
That Ill be given the strength an time  
To make yours just as happy as mine  
Your childhood
