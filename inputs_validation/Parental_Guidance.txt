You say I waste my life away but I live it to the full  
And how would you know anyway youre just mister dull  
Why dont you get into the things we do today  
You could lose twenty years right away so we say  
  
We dont need no no no no parental guidance here  
  
Every day you scream at me to turn the music low  
Well if you keep on screaming youll make me deaf you know  
You always chew me out because I stay out late  
Until your threepiece suit comes back in date get one thing straight  
  
Theres no communication  
Im tired of explanation  
Is this message getting through  
You went through the same thing too  
Dont you remember what its like to lose control  
Put on my jacket  for you get too old  
Lets rock n roll
