You cant be right  
Youre full of prejudice and spite  
You think youve got me pegged but youre wrong  
Out of my way  
There is a consequence to pay  
You think youve got me pegged but youre wrong  
  
I am someone wholl burn the whole world down  
Im the one to bring it right around  
  
Youre giving up on me  
But what else have you got  
  
Youre losing sight  
I wont give up without a fight  
You think youve got me pegged but youre wrong  
Im not afraid  
Ill take the chance I have to take  
You think youve got me pegged but youre wrong  
  
You cant expect the world to bend to you  
You only feed the fire of anger and our disbelief  
  
I cant be everything to everyone  
And I cant be everything you think that I should be
