Theres a doubt in my heart  
And its sinking deep inside of me  
Its the way that you talk  
Its in the way youre touching me  
When I look into your eyes  
Youre a million miles away from me  
And theres nothing I can do  
Theres nothing left to say  
Youll break my heart theres nothing left to say  
Youll break my hearttheres nothing I can do  
Youll break my heart  
Rip it off and watch it fall  
Will you go  will you stay  
Is there any chance for me to keep you here  
  
By my side  or is my fate already sealed  
Is there anybody else  
Or am I still the only one  
If its so then I dont care  
Just waiting for the blow to come  
You see theres nothing I can do  
Youll break my heart in any case theres nothing left to say  
youll break my heart  
Rip it off and watch it fall  
Youll break my heart theres nothing left to say  
Youll break my hearttheres nothing I can do  
Youll break my heart rip it off rip it off  
Youll break my heart
