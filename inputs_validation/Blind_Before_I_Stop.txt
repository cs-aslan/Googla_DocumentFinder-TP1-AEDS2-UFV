Ill go blind before I stop  
  
Chorus  
And Ill go blind before I stop theyre gonna have to come in and lock me up  
And Ill go blind before I stop cause this boy mama just want to rock  
  
Theres a two ton fireball burnin through the headphones  
Cuttin up my heart makin ashes of my soul  
A lightning bolt petition tonight Im gonna sign  
Trouble out my window and Im gonna find it  
  
And Im feelin the fever takin in the heat  
Bouncin to the boogie hittin with the beat  
Wrapped in rhythm dancin till we drop  
  
Chorus  
  
Moonlite madness masquerade I got my invitation baby time to play  
Rip off the headphones shove my arm into the socket  
Sound comes rushing through me like an intravenous rocket  
  
And Im feelin the fever takin in the heat  
Bouncin to the boogie hittin with the beat  
Wrapped in rhythm dancin till we drop  
  
Chorus  
  
Doin it in the market doin it in the mall  
Doin it in the bushes and the high school hall  
Doin it in the alley doin it for free  
Now theyre doin it baby on MTV  
  
Doin it in the backseat doin it on the beach  
Doin it in the grandstand just dancin on the seats  
Doin it in the movies doin it on the train  
Doin it mile high in a big jet plane  
  
And Im feelin the fever takin in the heat  
Bouncin to the boogie hittin with the beat  
Wrapped in rhythm dancin till we drop  
  
And Ill go blind before I stop theyre gonna have to come in and lock me up  
  
Chorus
