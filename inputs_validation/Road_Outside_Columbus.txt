Theres a road outside Columbus Ohio  
Feels like I drove along for years  
This Midwest way of ease it surrounds us  
I cant deny the rhythm here  
And as I pull away from Riverside beside me  
That High Street never looked so good  
I miss my lady even though she often writes me  
She tells me tales of my neighborhood  
  
Surprise surprise I traveled here  
Four hundred miles from where Im known  
My friends are here  
A couple years Ive spent  
I found I have a second home  
  
As Im blazing down my trail to education  
Theres no bliss in ignorance for me  
I stop and stare a breath of air  
Might slow me down some  
But thats just fine with me  
  
Surprise surprise I traveled here  
Four hundred miles from where Im known  
My friends are here  
A couple years Ive spent  
I found I have a second home  
  
I never traveled far  
Two hundred miles to go  
That boulevard will take me home  
  
Surprise surprise I traveled here  
Four hundred miles from where Im known  
My friends are here  
A couple years Ive spent  
I found I have a second home  
Surprise surprise I traveled here  
Four hundred miles from where Im known  
My friends are here  
A couple years Ive spent  
I found I have a second home
