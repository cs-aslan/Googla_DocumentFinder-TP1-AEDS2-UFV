Mother Father I think that I would rather  
Stay at home with you for another year  
That buildings so tall and it makes me feel so small  
That I might get lost and simply disappear  
  
Evil smiles wont change my mind  
Im worried and Im not the worrying kind  
Whys that man rubbing his hands  
Looking at me writing down his plans  
  
Today I have been molding plasticine  
and I made a little man who looked just like me  
His limbs were so weak and he couldnt move his mouth to speak  
And I could bend him into any shape I wanted him to be  
  
Evil smiles wont change my mind  
Im worried and Im not the worrying kind  
Whys that man rubbing his hands  
Looking at me writing down his plans  
  
Those kids with the blazers on  
They went in with names on their elbows  
Came home with medals on  
Spit it out thats the way the story goes  
  
A flying start for the briefcase crew  
Oh you didnt have to teach me like you did  
But you did  
And you didnt have to beat me like you did  
But you did  
But you did  
You did  
You did
