Clap your hands make a smile  
Let me know you hear me  
Stay a while play with me  
Long as you are near me  
Way to go straight I know  
Love to hear your laughter  
Without a care you are there  
Together ever after  
Me and you coming through  
Its what we got together  
Lay it down make it work  
No matter what the weather  
We got lots of soul lots of love  
Without a thought of giving unselfishly  
You and me all the love were given  
  
See the light  
Let it shine  
Let it shine  
Down on me  
Feeling good  
Knew I wouould  
Ever since  
You set me free
