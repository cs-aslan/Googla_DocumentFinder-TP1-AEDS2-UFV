I dont know why but Im feeling so sad  
Id long to try something Id never had  
Never had no kissing ooh what Ive been missing  
Lover man oh where can you be  
  
The night is cold and Im so all alone  
Id give my soul just to call you my own  
Got a moon above me but no ones here to love me  
Lover man oh where can you be  
  
Ive heard it said that the thrill of romance  
Can be like a heavenly dream  
And Ill go to bed with a prayer  
That youll make love love to me strange as it seems  
  
Someday well meet and youll dry all my tears  
And whisper sweet little things in my ear  
Hugging and akissing oh what Ive been missing baby  
Lover man oh where can you be  
  
Ive heard it said that the thrill of romance  
Could be like a heavenly dream  
And Ill go to bed with the prayer  
That youll make love love to me strange as it seems  
  
Someday well meet and youll dry all my tears  
Then whisper sweet little things in my ear  
Hugging and akissing oh what Ive been missing  
Lover man oh where can you be  
Lover man oh where can you be
