Harking is bonnie  
And there lives my love  
My heart lies on him  
And will not remove  
It will not remove  
Oh for all that I have done  
Oh I never will forget my love anachie  
For anachie gordon  
Hes bonnie and hes rough  
Hed entice any woman that ever he saw  
Hed entice any woman and so he has done me  
Oh I never will forget my love anachie  
Down came her father and hes standing by the door  
Saying jeannie youre trying the tricks of a whore  
You care nothing for a man who cares so very much for thee  
You must marry lord sulton and leave anachie  
For anachie gorden hes barely but a man  
Although he may be pretty but where are his lands  
Oh the sultons lands are broad and his towers they run high  
You must marry lord sulton and leave anachie  
With anachie gordon Id beg for my bread  
And before Ill marry sulton its gold to my head  
With gold to my head and gowns fringed to the knee  
And Ill die if I dont get me love anachie  
And you that are my parents to church you may me bring  
But unto lord sulton Ill never bear a song  
To a son or a daughter Ill never bow my knee  
And Ill die if I dont get me love anachie  
Jeannie was married and from church she was brought home  
And when she and her maidens so merry should have been  
When she and her maidens so merry should have been  
She went into her chambers she cried all alone  
Come to bed now jeannie me honey and my sweet  
For to style you my mistress it would be so sweet  
Be it mistress or jeannie its all the same to me  
But in your bed lord sulton I never will lie  
And down came her father and hes spoken with reknown  
Saying you that are her maidens go loosen off her gowns  
But she fell down to the floor so close down by his knee  
Saying father look Im dying for me love anachie  
The day that jeannie married was the day that jeannie died  
And the day that yound anachie came home on the tide  
And down came her maidens all wringing of their hands  
Saying oh its been so long youve spent so long on the sands  
Oh so long on the sands so long on the flood  
They have married your jeannie and now she lies dead  
You that are her maidens go take me by the hand  
And take me to the chamber that me love she lies in  
And hes kissed her cold lips till his heart has turned to stone  
And hes died in the chamber that his love she lies in
