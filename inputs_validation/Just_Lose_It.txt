Of child molestation accusation aah aah aah aah aah  
No worries pappas got a brand new bag of toys  
What else could I possibly do to make noise I done touched on everything  
But little boys  
And thats not a stab at Micheal thats just a metaphor  
Im just psycho  
I go a little bit crazy sometimes  
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes  
Good God dip do a little slide  
Bend down touch your toes and just glide up the center of the dance floor  
Like TP for my bung hole and its cool if you let one go  
Nobodys gonna know whod hear it

All I know is when I get there someones gonna touch my body  
Excuse me miss I dont mean to sound like a jerk

Down the street screaming aah aah aah aah aah

They said save it boy we got you on tape  
Telling an old lady to touch my body
