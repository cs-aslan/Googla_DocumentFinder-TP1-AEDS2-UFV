I feel so extraordinary  
Somethings got a hold on me  
I get this feeling Im in motion  
A sudden sense a sense of liberty  
I dont care cause Im not there  
I dont care if Im here tomorrow  
Again and again and again Ive taken too much  
Of the things that cost you too much  
  
I used to think that the day would never come  
Id see the light in the shade of the morning sun  
But dont you know somethings really got a hold on me  
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near  
To the childhood I lost replaced by fear  
  
When I was a very small boy  
Very small boys would talk to me  
Now that weve grown up together  
Can you believe  
Theyre afraid of what they see  
Thats the price that we all pay  
Our valued destiny has come to nothing  
I cant tell you where were going  
I guess theres just no way of knowing  
  
I used to think that the day would never come  
Id see the light in the shade of the morning sun  
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near  
To the childhood I lost replaced by fear  
Somethings got a hold on me  
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near  
To the childhood I lost replaced by fear  
  
Oh and I know and I know I know its just so bitter  
And its so wrong its so wrong  
Oh I know and I know but I I I have a question  
Big fuckin question  
  
Im in motion motion  
Im in motion I have a question  
And Im in motion motion  
I have a question motion  
I have a question
