Chorus  
Swept me away  
But now Im lost in the dark  
Set me on fire  
But now Im left with a spark  
Alone you got beyond the haze and  
Im lost inside the maze  
I guess Im all alone in love  
  
I look into your eyes  
You turn the other way  
And now I realize  
Its all a game you play  
I hold you in the night  
And wake to find you gone  
Youre running out of sight  
Its so hard holding on  
All alone in love  
  
Chorus  
  
You haunt me in my dreams  
Im calling out your name  
I watch you fade away  
Your love is not the same  
Ive figured out your style  
To quickly drift apart  
You held me for a while  
Planned it from the start  
All alone in love  
  
Sitting in the dark without you  
How am I supposed to make it  
Through the night  
Slowly fall apart without you  
Cry away the hours  
Till the morning light  
  
Chorus
