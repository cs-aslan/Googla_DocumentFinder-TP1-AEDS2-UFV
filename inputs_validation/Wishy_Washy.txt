I got a place with a view  
You can see the cars  
As they travel down the freeway  
To clubs and bars  
Theres a woman downstairs  
With mattgrey hair  
And she smiles when she tells me  
Theres no room for me here  
Theyve got it in the city  
Theyve got it in the country  
But here in the suburbs  
Its all so wishywashy  
Its all so wishywashy  
  
I got another place  
This time with a fireplace  
And a woman can come around  
Write poetry and feel safe  
I said its good for me now  
But Im not being fed  
I said its good for me now  
But Im not being fed
