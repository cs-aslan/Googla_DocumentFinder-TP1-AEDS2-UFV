Greetings loved ones lets take a journey  
Yeah the oooooooone  
Uhhuh baby youre a California girl  
  
Lets go all the way tonight  
No regrets just love  
We can dance until we die  
You and I will be young forever  
You make me feel like Im livin a  
Teenage dream the way you turn me on  
I cant sleep  
Lets run away and dont ever look back dont ever look back  
My heart stops when you look at me  
Just one touch now baby I believe this is real  
So take a chance and  
Dont ever look back dont ever look back  
Imma get your heart racing in my skin tight jeans  
Be your teenage dream tonight  
Let you put your hands on me in my skin tight jeans  
Be your teenage dream tonight  
Yeah  
  
I know a place  
Where the grass is really greener  
Warm wet and wild  
There must be something in the water  
You could travel the world  
But nothing comes close to the golden coast  
Once you party with us  
Youll be falling in love  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
California girls were unforgettable  
Daisy dukes bikinis on top  
Sun kissed skin so hot well melt you popsicle  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
California girls were undeniable  
Fine fresh fierce we got it on lock  
West coast represent now put your hands up  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
In another life  
I would be your girl  
Wed keep all our promises  
Be us against the world  
In another life  
I would make you stay  
So I dont have to say you were  
The one that got away the one that got away  
The oooooooone the one x3  
In another life  
I would make you stay  
So I dont have to say you were  
The one that got away  
  
Theres a stranger in my bed  
Theres a pounding in my head  
Glitter all over the room  
Pink flamingos in the pool  
I smell like a mini bar  
D Js passed out in the yard  
Barbies on the barbecue  
This a hickie or a bruise  
Pictures of last night ended up online  
Im screwed oh well  
Its a blacktop blur  
But Im pretty sure it ruled  
Last Friday night  
Yeah we danced on table tops  
And we took too many shots  
Think we kissed but I forgot  
Last Friday night  
Yeah we maxed our credit cards  
And got kicked out of the bar  
So we hit the boulevard  
Last Friday night  
We went streaking in the park  
Skinny dipping in the dark  
Then had a menage a trois  
Last Friday night  
Yeah I think we broke the law  
Always say were gonna stop oh whoa oh  
This Friday night do it all again

Youre so hypnotizing  
Could you be the devil  
Could you be an angel  
Your touch magnetizing  
Feels like I am floating  
Leaves my body glowing  
They say be afraid  
Youre not like the others  
Futuristic lover  
Different DNA  
They dont understand you  
Youre from a whole nother world  
A different dimension  
Youve opened my eyes  
Now Im ready to go  
Lead me into the light  
Kiss me kkkiss me  
Infect me with your lovin  
Fill me with your poison  
Take me tatatake me  
Wanna be your victim  
Ready for abduction  
Boy youre an alien  
Your touch so foreign  
Its supernatural extraterrestrial  
  
Do you ever feel  
Like a plastic bag  
Drifting through the wind  
Wanting to start again  
Do you ever feel  
Feel so paper thin  
Like a house of cards  
One blow from caving in  
Do you ever feel  
Already buried deep  
Six feet under screams  
But no one seems to hear a thing  
Do you know that theres still a chance for you  
Cause theres a spark in you  
You just gotta ignite the light  
And let it shine  
Just own the night  
Like the 4th of July  
Cause baby youre a firework  
Come on show em what youre worth  
Make em go oh oh oh  
When you shoot across the skyyy  
Boom boom boom even brighter than the moon moon moon  
Boom boom boom even brighter than the moon moon moon
