Its Alright Babys Coming Back  
  
Chorus  
Its alright babys coming back  
And I dont really care where hes been  
Its alright babys coming back  
And I wont turn him around this time  
  
Ill be your cliff you can fall down from me  
Ill be your ledge you can lean upon me  
Ill be your bridge your flowering tree  
You can still depend on me  
  
And Ill be the ticking of your clock  
And Ill be the numbers on your watch  
And Ill be your hands to stop the time  
Ill even be your danger sign  
  
Chorus  
  
And Ill be your grace your dignity  
And Ill be your night your destiny  
And Ill be your comfort and your ease  
I will be your storm at seas  
  
And Ill be your sharp intake of breath  
And Ill be your work Ill take no rest  
And when the world falls to decline  
Ill be yours and youll be mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Make it easy on yourself tonight
