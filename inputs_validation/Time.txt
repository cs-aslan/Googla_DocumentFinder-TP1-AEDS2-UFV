The time has come for you  
To make up your own mind mind  
Stop looking for the answers  
That youll never find  
  
Save all your tears for when you  
Really need to cry  
Dont wish your life away  
Just spread your wings and fly  
  
Time waits for no one  
Its never what it seems  
Stop waiting for tomorrow  
Stop living in your dreams  
  
This life fading away  
This life ticking like a time bomb  
Ready to blow your tortured mind  
I know its wasting away  
We dont plan for when it goes wrong  
The time that we lose  
We will never find time  
  
Cant hide the clock  
When every line shows on your face face  
So take it slow  
Youll never win the human race  
  
Time waits for no one yeah  
Everything must change  
Stop running to the future  
Start living for today  
  
This life fading away  
This life ticking like a time bomb  
Ready to blow your tortured mind  
I know its wasting away  
We dont plan for when it goes wrong  
The time that we lose  
We will never find time  
  
Just live every moment of each day  
Cause death is the price we all must pay  
  
This life fading away  
This life ticking like a time bomb  
Ready to blow your tortured mind  
I know its wasting away  
We dont plan for when it goes wrong  
The time that we lose  
We will never find time  
  
This life fading away  
This life ticking like a time bomb  
Ready to blow your tortured mind  
I know its wasting away  
We dont plan for when it goes wrong  
The time that we lose  
We will never find time
