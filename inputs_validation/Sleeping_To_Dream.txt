Im dreaming of sleeping next to you  
Im feeling like a lost little boy in a brand new town  
Im counting my sheep and  
each one that passes is another dream to ashes and they all fall down  
  
As I lay me down tonight  
I close my eyes and what a beautiful sight  
  
Im sleeping to dream about you  
Im so tired of having to live without you  
But I dont mind  
Im sleeping to dream about you and Im so tired  
  
I found myself in the riches your eyes your lips your hair  
Well you were everywhere  
But I woke up in the ditches I hit the light and I thought you might be here  
but you were nowhere You were nowhere at home  
  
As I lay me back to sleep  
Lord I pray that I can keep  
  
Sleeping to dream about you  
Im so tired of having to live without you  
But I dont mind  
Im sleeping to dream about you and Im so tired  
  
Its just a little a lullaby to keep myself from crying myself to sleep at
night  
  
Sleeping to dream about you  
Im so tired of having to live without you  
But I dont mind  
Sleeping to dream about you and Im so tired
