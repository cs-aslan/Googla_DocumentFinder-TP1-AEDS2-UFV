In this crazy world  
You can prove that you can make it  
If youre strong enough to take it  
Still there will be times  
When you find this life youre livin  
Is just takin all your givin  
  
When you need someone to run to  
The shelter of my love is always near  
Let me be your cover whenever darkness falls  
Ill be there Ill be there  
  
Chorus  
Til the end of the line  
You can count on me baby call me any time  
When the night is fallin hard  
Come on out of the rain and into my arms  
Run to me to a love thats safe and warm  
Ill be yours baby your safe place fro the storm  
  
People in this world  
Can be blind and so demanding  
Show so little understanding  
And in these desperate times  
Seems like everythings deceivin  
There aint much we can believe in  
  
Let me be the one you come to  
Show you one thing trust is always here  
Let me be your cover whenever darkness falls  
Ill be there Ill be there  
  
Chorus  
  
Run to me When those cold and troubled winds have found you  
Come to me And Ill wrap my world of love around you  
Ill be your flame burnin bright  
Be the sunlight in your day  
Thatll take you through the night baby  
  
Til the end of the line  
You can count on me baby call me any time  
When the night is fallin hard  
Come on out of the rain and into my arms  
Run to me to a love thats safe and warm  
Ill be yours baby your safe place  
Ill be yours baby your safe place  
Ill be yours baby your safe place from the storm  
Ill be your safe place from the storm
