I got to have you baby  
Dont you say that you dont care  
Any way you want it baby  
Ill settle for a back door love affair  
I call you on the telephone  
The party says that you aint there  
I call you on the telephone  
The party says that you aint there

I got to have you baby  
Dont you say that you dont care  
Any way you want it baby  
Ill settle for a back door love affair
