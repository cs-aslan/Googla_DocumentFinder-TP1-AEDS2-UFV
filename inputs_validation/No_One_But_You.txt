Ive been to all the ol familiar places  
At least a hundred of times since youve been gone  
Ive seen a lot of ol familiar faces  
But again tonight Im goin home alone  
  
My heart wont let me move on one but you  
My mind keeps tellin me that just wont do  
My arms keep reachin out for someone new  
But my heart wont let me love no one but you  
  
Ive told myself a million times its over  
Youve gotta face the truth and let her go  
Just when I think Ive got it all together  
Your memory walks around in side my soul  
  
My heart wont let me move on one but you  
My mind keeps tellin me that just wont do  
My arms keep reachin out for someone new  
But my heart wont let me love no one but you
