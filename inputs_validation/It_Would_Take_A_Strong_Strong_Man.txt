My heart starts breaking  
When I think of making up  
Plans to let you go  
I keep thinking maybe tomorrow  
Im gonna let you know  
But when I think about leaving  
I think about losing  
The only love I ever knew  
Every time I think of you  
  
My heart starts aching  
My hands keep shaking  
And you know you know you know  
  
It would take a strong strong man  
To ever let you go to ever let you go  
To ever let you go  
  
My hearts been hurting  
When I see you flirting  
Every night out on the floor  
I keep thinking maybe tomorrow  
Youl grow to love me more  
But whenever were together  
I could leave you never  
Even though you treat me cruel  
Every time I look at you  
  
My heart starts aching  
My hands keep shaking  
And you know you know you know  
  
It would take a strong strong man  
To ever let you go to ever let you go  
To ever let you go  
  
I tried to resist you  
When youre gone all I ever do is miss you  
Anyone in love would know  
Anyone with half a heart  
Could never let you go  
  
But when I think about leaving  
I think about losing  
The only girl I ever loved  
Cant you tell me why do you hurt me  
I guess some people never see  
Especially a fool like me  
  
My heart starts aching  
My hands keep shaking  
And you know you know you know  
  
It would take a strong strong man  
To ever let you go  
To ever let you go to ever let you go  
Ill never let you go
