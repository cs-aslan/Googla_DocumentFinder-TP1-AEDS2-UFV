I know your girlfriend hates me  
I see it in her eyes  
The way she looks right on me  
It opens up in time  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
See you know its true  
The way she hangs upon you  
And watches every move come on  
Girl you think youre something  
But have I got news for you who  
  
I dont mind  
If its the cold and sadistic you like  
But now Im thinking  
Whos wearing your trousers now  
Shes no good  
Oh stop pretending shes misunderstood  
I heard her saying its either me or her  
Smell the coffee boy and open your eyes  
Lifes too long for you to get it wrong  
  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
I see it in her eyes  
The way she looks right on me  
It opens up in time  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
See you know its true  
The way she hangs upon you  
And watches every move come on  
Girl you think youre something  
But have I got news for you who  
  
Oh poor you  
With all your lockets that have broken in two  
Does she get a little excited dont hide it  
I heard her screaming in the dead of the night  
Lifes too long for you to get it wrong  
  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
I see it in her eyes  
The way she looks right on me  
It opens up in time  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
See you know its true  
The way she hangs upon you  
And watches every move come on  
Girl you think youre something  
But have I got news for you who  
  
Ringy dingy ding ding ding ding  
Ringy dingy ding ding  
Ringy dingy dinga ding ding ding  
Ringy dingy ding ding  
Girlfriend wants to see whos calling  
Freaking out your phone keeps going  
Ringy dingy ding ding ding ding  
Ringy dingy ding ding  
Lifes too long  
  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
I see it in her eyes  
The way she looks right on me  
It opens up in time  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
See you know its true  
The way she hangs upon you  
And watches every move come on  
Girl you think youre something  
But have I got news for you who
