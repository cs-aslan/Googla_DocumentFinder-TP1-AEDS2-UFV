I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill  
On Blueberry Hill when I found you  
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill  
And lingered until my dreams came true  
  
The wind in the willow played  
Loves sweet melody  
But all of those vows we made  
Were never to be  
  
Though were apart youre part of me still  
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill  
  
I found my thrill Come climb the hill with me baby  
On Blueberry Hill Well see what we shall see  
On Blueberry Hill Ill bring my horn with me  
When I found you Ill be wit you where berries are blue  
The moon stood still Each afternoon well go  
On Blueberry Hill Higher than the moon well go  
And lingered until Then to a weddin in June well go  
My dreams came true Babadadebuzzbuzz vadendaday  
  
The wind in the willow played do you really love me  
Loves sweet melody as I love you  
But all of those vows we made will you still remember  
Were never to be when the night is through  
  
Though were apart youre part of me still  
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill
