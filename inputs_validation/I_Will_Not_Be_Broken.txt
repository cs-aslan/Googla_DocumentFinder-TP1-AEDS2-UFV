That was then and this is now  
I found my way back here somehow  
Knew youd have to let me go  
I told you once I told you so  
  
Chorus  
Take me down  
You can hold me but you  
Cant hold whats within  
Pull me round  
Push me to the limit  
Maybe I may bend  
But I know where Im not going  
I will not be broken  
I will not be broken  
I will not be  
  
Someone other than who I am  
I will fight to make my stand  
Cause what is livin if I cant live free  
  
What is freedom if I cant be me  
  
Chorus  
  
I wont let you near it  
I will let my spirit fly  
Fly  
High  
Oh take me down  
  
Take me down  
You can hold me but you  
Cant hold whats within  
Pull me round  
Push me to the limit  
Maybe I may bend  
But we both know where Im not going  
I will not be broken  
I will not be broken  
I will not be
