Never left at all you were there before  
Never let it go now I need some more  
But you did confuse me you get it on get it on  
If I had to use me Id be there in the song  
And the song goes on  
Ah yeah and the song goes on  
Ive been by the sides  
Wouldnt you agree with me  
Never fought it off kept away oh so bad  
Didnt like your world or the way you had  
You secure your choice youre around like a voice  
Never let you know you were there every word  
And the word goes on  
Ah yeah and the word goes on  
Ive been by the sides  
Wouldnt you agree with me  
It depends on whose doorway you walk through  
To find the truth  
It depends on whose doorway you walk through  
To find the truth  
Never left at all you were there like before  
Never let it go now I need some more  
Oh you did confuse me youre in my way on and on  
If I had to use me Id be there in the song  
And the song goes on  
Ah yeah and the song goes on  
It depends on whose doorway you walk through  
To find the truth  
It depends on whose doorway you walk through  
To find the truth  
It depends on whose doorway you walk through  
To find the truth  
It depends on whose doorway you walk through  
To find the truth
