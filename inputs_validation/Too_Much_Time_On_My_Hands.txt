Yeah here I am sitting on this bar stool  
Talking like a damn fool  
Got the twelve oclock news blues  
And Ive given up hope for the afternoon soaps  
And a bottle of cold brew  
Is it any wonder Im not crazy  
Is it any wonder Im sane at all  
  
Well Im so tired of losing  
Ive got nothing to do and all day to do it  
Well Id go out cruising but Ive no place  
To go and all night to get there  
Is it any wonder Im not a criminal  
Is it any wonder Im not in jail  
  
Is it any wonder Ive got too much time on my hands  
Its ticking away with my sanity  
Ive got too much time on my hands  
Its hard to believe such a calamity  
Ive got too much time on my hands  
And its ticking away ticking away from me  
  
Too much time on my hands  
Its tick tick tick tick ticking away  
Too much time on my hands  
And I dont know what to do with myself  
Too much time on my hands  
  
Too much time on my hands  
Too much time on my hands  
Too much time on my hands  
  
Now Im a jet fuel genius  
I can solve the worlds problems  
Without even trying  
Ive got dozens of friends and the fun never ends  
That is as long as Im buying  
Is it any wonder Im not the President  
Is it any wonder Im null and void  
  
Is it any wonder Ive got too much  
Time on my hands  
Its ticking away with my sanity  
Ive got too much time on my hands  
Its hard to believe such a calamity  
Ive got too much time on my hands  
And its ticking away ticking away from me  
  
Too much time on my hands  
Ticky tick tick tick tick ticking away  
Too much time on my hands  
And I dont know what to do with myself  
Too much time on my hands  
Umm mmm  
Too much time on my hands  
Tick tick tick ticking away  
Too much time on my hands  
Umm mmm  
Too much time on my hands  
Too much time on my hands  
Too much time on my
