Hey take it and run child  
Ill ask you no questions  
We traded our fortunes  
Crossing the border  
I hope you got lucky  
You needed a change  
II made it without you  
Crossing the border  
We were like a couple of wetbacks running  
Standin on the banks of some dangerous river  
Lookin into a brave new country  
Risky business  
Crossing the border  
Ahhh youyou doubled my chances  
II sure do want your freedom  
IIll never forget you  
Crossing the border  
Back when we were out there  
Crossing the border  
Layin it on the line  
Crossing the border
