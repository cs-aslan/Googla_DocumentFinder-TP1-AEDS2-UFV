Hes got the woman  
Out of your dreams  
Youll never find out  
What it all means  
But youve got patience  
And still believe  
That youll be there  
When she will leave  
  
Someone will lose  
Somebodys finding  
Somebody smiles  
Somebodys crying  
  
Cant fight  
You cant fight your desire  
You cant fight your dreams yeah  
You cant fight your desire  
Hold on to your dreams yeah  
  
So listen hard now  
Man you should know  
If youre just waiting  
Your doubts will grow  
You selfbelieve  
Already small  
Get up now  
You can have it all  
  
Someone will lose  
Somebodys finding  
Somebody smiles  
Somebodys crying  
  
Cant fight  
You cant fight your desire  
You cant fight your dreams yeah  
Cant fight  
You cant fight your desire  
Hold on to your dreams yeah  
  
Someone will lose  
Somebodys finding  
Somebody smiles  
Somebodys crying  
  
Cant fight  
You cant fight your desire  
You cant fight your dreams yeah
