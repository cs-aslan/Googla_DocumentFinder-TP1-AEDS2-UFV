Every woman have a snapping point  
You dont want her to snap no  
  
Someone stop Linda  
She just left the crib with a beretta  
Shes on her way to pop her fiance  
Its the word on the street  
He was sleeping with Renee  
Lord knows please someone stop Linda  
He dont even know shes coming  
Like the FBI she gon knock down the door with no warrant  
Lord knows what happened to the good time lovin lovin  
  
My father used to tell me son listen  
Theres a thin line between love and hate  
Once you cross that line see theres no escape  
She love me she love you not  
You dont want to open up Pandora Box no no  
She will see that two men cheating  
When you said that two men working  
All Im saying is just watch your back  
cause tonight see I got a bad feeling Jack  
Lindas got a gat  
  
Someone stop Linda  
She just left the crib with a Beretta  
Shes on her way to pop her fiance  
Its the word on the street  
He was sleeping with Renee  
Lord knows please someone stop Linda  
He dont even know shes coming  
Like the FBI she gon knock down the door with no warrant  
Lord knows what happened to the good time lovin lovin  
  
Listen to me now  
Every barrel got a Linda  
Trust me you dont want that drama  
When you laughing shes crying  
Mascara running down her face now shes plotting  
Like Method Man she gon bring the pain  
Like Cypress Hill you got a insane in the membrane  
All Im saying is just watch your back  
Cause tonight see I got a bad feeling Jack  
Oh my God  
  
Someone stop Linda  
She just left the crib with a beretta  
Shes on her way to pop her fiance  
Its the word on the street  
He was sleeping with Renee  
Lord knows please someone stop Linda  
He dont even know shes coming  
Like the FBI she gon knock down the door with no warrant  
Lord knows what happened to the good time lovin lovin  
  
Someone stop Linda Samson fell for Delilah  
Someone stop Linda Ahab fell for Jezebel  
Someone stop Linda King David fell for   
And coming in the mist  
Linda wants to head up the baptist  
Someone stop Linda  
He dont even know shes coming
