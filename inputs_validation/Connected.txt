Its never right or wrong with you and me  
Were pure unconscious energy  
And I freeze as your charging through my mind  
Thats what its like with you and me  
Were  
  
Then the spark ignites again  
And Im electric  
Cause you and I were connected  
And then the stadium lights go on  
And we get hectic  
Cause you and I were connected  
  
To the light that shines in our eyes  
To the beat thats running our lives  
To the sound thats bringing us back again  
Repeat  
  
And I know you in and out and you know me  
Theres not a thing you got to be  
And I see how your glowing from inside  
Thats what its like with you and me  
Were  
  
Then the spark ignites again  
And Im electric  
Cause you and I were connected  
And then the stadium lights go on  
And we get hectic  
Cause you and I were connected  
  
To the light that shines in our eyes  
To the beat thats running our lives  
To the sound thats bringing us back again  
Repeat 2x
