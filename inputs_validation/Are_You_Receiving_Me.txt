Are you receiving me  
You are deceiving me I know see I know  
  
When were out walking  
Your mouth aint where its supposed to do the talking  
When were in kissing  
Your lips are missing are they out on loan to someone else  
Are you listening  
  
I put it in a letter what could be better  
I put it in a note one night I wrote  
I put it in a telegram just like the son of Sam  
Babe theres something missing  
Your TVs just hissing
