How long do I have to wait  
Before I can tell you the things Ive been wanting to say  
How long must I hesitate  
I know it makes sense but its hard for me to stay away  
But if this is how it has to be  
Maybe its just a feeling  
That I could name  
But Id probably best blameimpatience  
You cant miss  what youve never known  
Its quite absurd how you started disturbing me so  
Sometimes  when I am all alone  
I lose my senses  
I have no defenses to go  
But if this is how I lose my heart  
Then I shall just embrace that  
My pulse is racing still  
Im secretly thrilled  
By the laughter that tumbled  
And the tears that I spilled  
As far as I know no one ever got killed  
By impatience  
Tell me  is there danger still  
I took no heed so a word might as well be deed  
Although  Id really like to see you now  
Im almost certain it cant be accomplished with speed  
So if this is how Ill bide my time  
Then I will set it down  
Til we lose our caution  
Ill honor your order  
Cause its such sweet torture  
To carry this torch  
In the light of temptation  
Beyond conversation and all expectation  
Pausing a moment or two just to mention  
Impatience
