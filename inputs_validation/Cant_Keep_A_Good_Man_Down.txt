No you cant keep a good man down  
When you got a good woman to keep it up  
No you cant stand on firmer ground  
When love is the question I got enough  
  
Ooh with lips so sweet  
Our love just cant be beat my darling oh yeah  
A love like yours and mine  
Can stand the test of time my darling oh yeah  
But for tomorrow  tomorrow never comes  
Love is the secret  goes living on  
  
No you cant keep a good man down  
When you got a good woman to keep it up  
No you cant stand on firmer ground  
When love is the question I got enough  
  
Just when I need you show me the way  
You came into my world  turned my night to day  
What good is a man without a woman  
But for the trouble  trouble always comes  
Love is the secret  goes living on  
  
No you cant keep a good man down  
When you got a good woman to keep it up  
No you cant stand on firmer ground  
When love is the question I got enough  
  
Ooh your love is strong  
Keep me forever youre my darling oh yeah  
A love like yours and mine  
Can stand the test of time my darling oh yeah  
But for tomorrow  tomorrow never comes  
Love is the secret  goes living on  
  
No you cant keep a good man down  
When you got a good woman to keep it up  
No you cant stand on firmer ground  
When love is the question Ive got enough
