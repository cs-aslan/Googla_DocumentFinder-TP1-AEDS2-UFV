All I want to be is washed out by the sea  
No death star over me  
Wont give me any peace  
All I want is light relief  
Put the crazies on the street  
Give them guns and feed them meat  
Now shoot the death star down  
Dig a hole and put it down  
Thousand miles underground  
  
They say its no game  
Theres strange news from another star  
Im lost Im lost  
Theres strange news from another star  
  
Give me all your stuff  
Until I cant get up  
Watch the whole world freeze  
Counting tin can in our sleep  
Submarines are diving deep  
I dont believe in me  
I dont believe in me  
All Ive ever done is tame  
Will you love me all the same  
Will you love me though  
Always the same  
  
They say its no game  
Theres strange news from another star  
Im lost Im lost  
Theres strange news from another star
