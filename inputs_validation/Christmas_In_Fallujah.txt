Its evening in the desert  
Im tired and Im cold  
But I am just a soldier  
I do what I am told  
  
We came with the crusaders  
To save the holy land  
Its Christmas in Fallujah  
And no one gives a damn  
  
And I just got your letter  
And this is what I read you said  
Im fading from your memory  
So Im just as good as dead  
  
We are the armies of the empire  
We are ethe legionnaires of Rome  
  
Its Christmas in Fallujah  
And we aint never coming home  
We came to bring these people freedom  
We came to fight the infidel  
There is no justice in the desert  
Because there is no God in hell  
  
They say Osamas in the mountains  
Deep in a cave near Pakistan  
But theres a sea of blood in Baghdad  
A sea of oil in the sand  
Between the Tigris and Euphrates  
Another day comes to an end  
Its Christmas in Fallujah  
Piece on Earth goodwill to men  
  
Its Christmas in Fallujah  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
Its Christmas in Fallujah  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
Its Christmas in Fallujah  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
Its Christmas in Fallujah  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
  
Marry Christmas from Fallujah  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
Marry Christmas from Fallujah  
Hallelujah hallelujah 5x  
  
Oora
