I could paint your picture in the sky tonight  
Your lips stick on the moon in pastel light  
Baby its full and white  
Honey its full tonight  
  
Chorus  
So kiss me red  
Kiss me rouge  
Kiss me rough  
Kiss me smooth  
Oh  
  
I could paint your picture in my room tonight  
Your bodys on my mind its full and white  
Oh but youre far away  
And what I wouldnt pay  
  
Chorus  
To kiss you red  
Kiss you rouge  
Kiss you rough  
Kiss you smooth  
Oh  
  
Its black out  
And Im afraid of the dark  
So I light a candle to replace your heart  
What I wouldnt give to have you here in my bed  
  
Chorus  
To kiss me red  
Kiss me rouge  
Kiss me rough  
Kiss me smooth
