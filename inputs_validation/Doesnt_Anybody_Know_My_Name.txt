Ive been away for so long fought a war thats come and gone  
Doesnt anybody know my name  
My sister upped and wed mom was sick and took to bed  
And my old dog Reds gone lame  
Please tell me if you can what time the trains roll in  
Two ten six eighteen ten forty four  
This old house is falling down there aint no need in me for hanging round  
Doesnt anybody know my name  
The girl I left behind shes gone with this friend of mine  
I dont have to see a sign to know things aint the same  
Please tell me if you can  
You cant get far away on just a soldiers pay doesnt anybody know my name  
Used to be when I could see everybody wanted me  
Guess nobody cares to see a blind man catch a train  
Please tell me if you can
