When I left my home  
I was not much more than a child  
My mother started crying  
She knew that I was born to be wild  
  
Cuse I was looking for the bright lights of the big city  
A red hot town where the girls are pretty  
  
I took to the highway  
Chasing my dream down the line  
Heading out for trouble  
Never finding my peace of mind  
Cause I been run out of town so many times before  
An usually kind of places where I cant go back no more  
  
Outlaw born outside of the law  
Just another outlaw  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun  
  
I never find it easy trying to keep the feeling alive  
Ive always been a dreamer  
Dreamers find it hard to survive  
When theyre living in the bright lights of the big city  
A red hot town where the girls are pretty  
  
Outlaw born outside of the law  
Just another outlaw  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun  
Outlaw born outside of the law  
Just another outlaw  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun  
  
Outlaw born outside of the law  
Just another outlaw  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun  
Born outside of the law  
Just another outlaw  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun  
Outlaw outlaw  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun
