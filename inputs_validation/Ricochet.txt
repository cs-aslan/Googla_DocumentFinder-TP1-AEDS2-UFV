All of that thick time without you  
Has made me so thick and drunk  
and its ok to laugh about it  
I said its ok to laugh about it  
  
Runnin twice as fast to stay in the same place  
Dont catch my breath until the end of the day  
And Id rather be sot in the face  
Than hear what youre going to say  
  
One day the wind will come up  
And youll come up empty again  
And wholl be laughing then  
Youll come up empty again  
  
No reason no explanation so play the violins  
  
Its always funny until someone gets hurt  
And then its just hilarious  
  
You beat me every time you blink  
if only I did not have to think  
Think about you crackin a smile  
Think about you all the while  
  
On the ricochet its going to hit you  
Its always funny until someone gets hurt  
You can laugh at me when it misses you
