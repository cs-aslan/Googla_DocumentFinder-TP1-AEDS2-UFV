Come on nature I dont want to read a book or talk about the world  
Come on nature I just want to spend some time being boy to the girl  
Come on nature let me show the way that Ive been feeling all along  
Come on nature just because I dont feel weak dont mean I feel so strong  
  
Ive been known to ask a few more favours than I should of you  
And in time Im sure Ill still want things that you could never do  
If she wasnt mine if I was stepping out of line  
But shes mine and Im in line and shes the best Ive ever seen  
  
Come on nature let me show the way that Ive been feeling all along  
Dark brown hair green eyes and white skin  
You perfect every color that shes in  
  
Come on nature I dont want to read a book or talk about the world  
Come on nature I just want to spend some time being boy to the girl  
Her and me I could be complete if you could let it be  
My desire is to stretch myself inside her bodys fire  
  
If I stumbled in then I could say that I had been to the chamber  
Where your greatest work of art was on display
