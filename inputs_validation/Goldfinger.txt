Goldfinger hes the man the man with the Midas touch  
A spiders touch  
Such a cold finger beckons you to enter his web of sin  
But dont go in  
  
Golden words he will pour in your ear  
But his lies cant disguise what you fear  
For a golden girl knows when hes kissed her  
Its the kiss of death from Mister  
  
Goldfinger pretty girl beware of this heart of gold  
This heart is cold  
  
Golden words he will pour in your ear  
But his lies cant disguise what you fear  
For a golden girl knows when hes kissed her  
Its the kiss of death from Mister  
  
Goldfinger pretty girl beware of this heart of gold  
This heart is cold  
He loves only gold  
Only gold  
He loves gold  
He loves only gold  
Only gold  
He loves gold
