Theres a rumour theres a rumour  
Rumour has it  
  
Rumour has it all around the town  
Someones looking for a girl like me  
Where can she be found  
I hope its who I think it is  
I wonder if its really him  
Its got to be the man I love  
No one else but him  
  
Rumour has it  
They say hes gonna make this girl his everything  
Hes gonna love her and surround her  
With all those beautiful things  
It was the most wonderful moment in my life I had  
My life ended on that evening  
I lost him Lord it hurt so bad  
  
Rumour has it  
You never know just what youve wont until youve lost  
And the object of the game is not to pay the cost  
Anyone can play the game there are no rules  
And you never know just what youve won until you lose

Well you can change a lot of things in your life  
But not your destiny  
And when you find the best thing in life has come to you  
Hold it in your hand real tight or it may slip through
