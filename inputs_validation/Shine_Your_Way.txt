Just before the dawn  
When the lights still gone  
Shine shine your way  
And you may not know where to go  
Shine shine your way  
  
Open road but its still dark  
Build a fire from a spark  
And shine shine your way  
Feed the feeling in your heart  
Dont conceal it then youll start  
To find find your way  
  
No one can stop what has begun  
You must believe when I say  
  
All of your tears will dry faster in the sun  
Starting today  
Shine shine shine  
Shine your way  
  
Theres an open sky  
And a reason why  
You shine shine your way  
Theres so much to learn  
And now its your turn  
To shine shine your way  
  
Theres a feeling deep inside  
You can let it be your guide  
To find find your way  
And theres no time for us to waste  
Got to take a leap of faith  
And fly fly away  
  
Dont have to walk  
Now you can run  
Nothing can get in your way  
  
All of your tears will dry faster in the sun  
Starting today  
Shine shine shine  
Shine your way  
  
Morning is breaking  
Darkness is fading  
We found a way to the light  
Its such a beautiful sight  
  
Any time anywhere  
Turn around and Ill be there  
To shine shine your way  
  
Like a star burning bright  
Lighting up the darkest night  
Ill shine shine your way  
  
Now I can see  
You are the one  
Sent here to show me the way  
  
All of your tears will dry faster in the sun  
Starting today  
Shine shine shine  
Were on our way  
Shine shine shine  
Thats what we say  
Shine shine shine  
Shine your way  
  
Theres a reason why  
You shine shine your way  
  
All of our tears will dry faster in the sun  
Shine your way
