Im not loving you the way I wanted to  
What I had to do had to run from you  
Im in love with you but the vibe is wrong  
And that haunted me all the way home  
So ya never know never never know  
Never know enough til its over love  
Til we lose control system overload  
Screaming no no no no no  
Im not loving you the way I wanted to  
See I wanna move but cant escape from you  
So I keep it low keep a secret code  
So everybody else dont have to know  
  
Chorus  
So keep ya love lockdown ya love lockdown  
Keeping ya love lockdown ya love lockdown  
Now keep ya love lockdown ya love lockdown  
Now keep ya love lockdown you lose  
  
Im not loving you way I wanted to  
I cant keep my cool so I keep it true  
I got something to lose so I gotta move  
I cant keep myself and still keep you too  
So I keep in mind when Im on my own  
Somewhere far from home in the danger zone  
How many times did it take til I finally got through  
You lose you lose  
Im not loving you the way I wanted to  
See I had to go I had to move  
No more wasting time you cant wait for life  
Were just wasting time wheres the finish line  
  
Chorus  
  
Im not loving you the way I wanted to  
I met no one new I got no one new  
No I said Im through but got love for you  
But Im not loving you the way I wanted to  
Gotta keep it going keep the loving going  
Keep it on a roll only god knows  
If Ill be with you baby Im confused  
You choose you choose  
Im not loving you the way I wanted to  
Way I wanna go I dont need you  
I been down this road too many times before  
Im not loving you the way I wanted to  
  
Chorus
