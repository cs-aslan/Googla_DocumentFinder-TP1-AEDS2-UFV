This is a hidden track right after Nans Song on Escapology  
  
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh  
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh  
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh  
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh  
  
Things got weird  
Like a three year old with a beard  
Like a vision of Britney Spears  
Like a tuna always seared  
Do you like it a lot  
Guess whats on the clock  
Id rather fanny about on a yacht  
Stop staring at the stars  
  
Save The Children  
Save The Children  
  
Things got weird  
Like a three year old with a beard  
Like a vision of Britney Spears  
Like a tuna always seared  
Do you like it a lot  
Guess whats on the clock  
Id rather fanny about on a yacht  
Stop staring at the stars
