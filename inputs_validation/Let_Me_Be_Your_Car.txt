I may not seem your ideal  
When you look into my eyes  
I dont smoke I dont tell jokes  
Im not the custom made size  
  
But baby let me take you  
Out on the highway for awhile  
Ill show you where the man in me  
Is when he doesnt hide  
  
Hes cruisin in the fast lane  
Stuck behind the wheel  
Jekyll and Hyde going on inside  
When Im your automobile  
  
And let me be your car for awhile child  
Shift me into gear and Ill be there  
Fill me up with five star gasoline  
Ill be your car Ill take you anywhere  
  
Dont you know I cant dance  
I dont dig it I cant see it at all  
You say Im just a specimen  
And baby I can crawl  
  
My physique just dont look  
The way the physiques really should  
But then again Ive got an engine  
Underneath my hood  
  
When Im cutting up the road  
With a sports car on my tail  
Frankensteins inside my mind  
And the winds inside my sails
