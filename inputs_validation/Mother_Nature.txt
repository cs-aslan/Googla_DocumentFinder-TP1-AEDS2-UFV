I want her so bad  
Mother Nature has a hold on me  
I want her so bad  
Mother Nature wont you let me be untied  
Cause it hurts my pride  
To be tossed off like the morning covers  
And crossed off like her other lovers  
Casually  
  
I see her walking by my window mhmmhmmhmmhmm  
It seems to me I know her well  
But like the flowers in the springtime  
Growing toward the sunshine  
Her beauty falls upon me in a fragrant springtime spell  
  
And I want her so baaaaad  
Mother Nature has a HOLD on me  
I want her so bad  
Mother Nature wont you let me be untied  
Cause it hurts my pride  
To be tossed off like the morning covers  
And crossed off like her other lovers  
Casually  
  
Is she an icy winter woman Mmhhmm  
That chills my body when shes near  
Sweet fever in the morning  
I dont know if Ill survive  
She walks by me as though she didnt  
Know I was alive  
  
And I want her so baaaaad  
Mother Nature has a hold on me  
I want her so bad  
Mother Nature wont you let me be untied  
Cause it hurts my pride  
To be tossed off like the morning covers  
And crossed off like her other lovers  
Tossed off like the morning covers  
Crossed off like her other lovers  
Tossed off like the morning covers  
Crossed off like her other lovers
