Its a beggars life said the Queen of Spain  
But dont tell it to a poor man  
Cause hes got to kill for every thrill  
The best he can  
Everywhere around me  
I see jealousy and mayhem  
Because no men have all their peace of mind  
To carry them  
Well I dont really care  
If its wrong or if its right  
But until my ship comes in  
Ill live night by night  
  
When the joker tried to tell me  
I could cut it in this rube town  
When he tried to hang that sign on me  
I said take it down  
When the dawn patrol got to tell you twice  
Theyre gonna do it with a shotgun  
Yes Im cashing in this tencent life  
For another one  
  
Well I aint got the heart  
To lose another fight  
So until my ship comes in  
Ill live night by night  
  
Well I dont really care  
If its wrong or if its right  
But until my ship comes in  
Ill live night by night
