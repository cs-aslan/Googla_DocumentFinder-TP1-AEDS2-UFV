I never much believed in reincarnation  
Thought it was only peoples imagination  
But now Im forced into some reconsideration  
Cause somethings happened to my cat  
That deserves some explanation  
William Shakespeares in my cat  
My kitty is the bard  
He used to be a playwright  
Now hes digging up the yard  
Hes still a cat in most respects  
He likes to meow and purr  
But now I introduce him as the cat  
That wrote Richard the third  
I took him to see Phantom  
He said it was quite nice  
But he cant go see Miss Saigon  
Until he kills some mice  
Until he kills some mice  
William Shakespeares in my cat  
It sometimes seems so deep  
The guy who wrote Twelfth Night  
Chews on my socks while Im asleep  
Im really quite impressed  
I own the cat who wrote MacBeth  
But if somethings rotten in this state  
Its just his fishy breath  
Cause he wrote Romeo and Juliet  
But his greatest story yet  
Is coming back as someones pet  
And gettin neutered by the vet  
He got his paws caught in a net  
Then he said to be or not to meeeow  
William Shakespeares in my cat  
He rarely ever talks  
He makes his loudest statements  
Standing in the litter box  
He sleeps on all my shelves  
And throws my books about the house  
It doesnt sound like prose  
When he bats a squeaky mouse  
Sam Becketts plays are witty  
Same thing for Bernard Shaw  
Oscar Wilde is pretty  
But none of them have paws  
None of them have paws  
William Shakespeares in my cat  
He chases bits of fluff  
John Miltons in my goldfish  
But I never liked his stuff  
Im thinking that Franz Kafka  
Really came back as a bug  
And I hope Andrew Lloyd Webber  
Will stay underneath my rug  
Cause he wrote Romeo and Juliet  
But his greatest story yet  
Is coming back as someones pet  
And gettin neutered by the vet  
He got his paws caught in a net  
Then he said to be or not to meeeow  
Take it Trevor  
He wrote Romeo and Juliet  
But his greatest story yet  
Is coming back as someones pet  
And gettin neutered by the vet  
He got his paws caught in a net  
Then he said to be or not to meeeow
