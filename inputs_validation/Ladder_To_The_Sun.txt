From the very start  
It came apart  
It broke up into pieces and  
There was a chance and I missed it  
It could risked it  
And I put myself into your hands  
  
Cause youre not just anyone  
Youre a ladder to the sun  
Oh youre not just anyone  
Youre a ladder to the sun  
  
Performing Courses  
Opposing forces  
And all men are just mortals and  
So if you want me then you can have me  
Take me oh baby grab me  
  
Cause if you want me then you can have me  
Cause youre not just anyone  
Youre a ladder to the sun  
Youre not just anyone  
Youre a ladder to the sun  
  
Oh now boy what you been and done  
You set a course that you couldnt run  
Oh now boy what you been and done  
  
I had it all and I risked it  
I had it all and I risked it all  
And I risked it all  
And I risked it all  
  
A ladder to the  
A Ladder to the sun  
A ladder to the  
A ladder to the sun  
  
A ladder to the  
A ladder to the sun  
And I risked it all  
A ladder to the  
A ladder to the sun
