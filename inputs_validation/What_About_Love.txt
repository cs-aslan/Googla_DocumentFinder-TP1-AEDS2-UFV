Boy  
Theres a hole in the sky tonight  
Did the moon drift too far from sight  
I would search through this empty darkness  
To see your face in the morning light  
  
Weve been lost in a sea of confusion  
Got caught up in a selfish illusion  
But make no mistake I will bend till I break  
Dont let fate make the choice for us  
  
What about love that lasts forever  
What about time to see it through  
If you dont give you just dont get it  
What about me  
What about you  
  
What about love  
  
Girl  
Once in a lifetime youll find someone heaven send for you  
For a lifetime youll feel theres a reason to believe  
In a love thats meant to be  
  
Boy  
It feels like weve fallen from grace  
Given up on the higher thing  
Cause I know deep inside if we search we will find  
Something to give us wings  
  
What about love that lasts forever  
What about time to see it through  
If you dont give you just dont get it  
What about me  
What about you  
  
What about love  
  
Boy  
I cant go on another day  
Comin home and seeing you cryin  
Girl  
Cant stand another night  
Of telling you Im fine when Im dying  
  
Both  
Forever means nothing  
To live without you  
Is reaching for something that never comes through  
Together is heaven  
Apart were in hell  
The time for forgiveness is now  
  
Once in a lifetime youll find  
Someone to share your dreams  
For a lifetime  
Our love will always set us free  
Forever well believe  
  
Boy  
I cant forget the feelin of your sweat upon my skin  
And the tremble of your body on the day you let me in  
It happens once only once in a lifetime  
  
Girl  
On a summernights surrender with nothing to loose  
You were scared and so was I when I gave myself to you  
It happens once only once in a lifetime  
  
Both  
What about love that lasts forever  
What about time to see it through  
If you dont give you just dont get it  
What about me  
What about you  
  
What about love that wont say never  
When you dont know what you can do  
If you dont live you just regret it  
What about me  
What about you  
  
What about love
