You know you know you know you know you know  
I cant go out alone  
Hi chaperone my chaperone  
What you think is all wrong  
cause you shouldnt treat a girl like a game of pingpong  
But I cant go out alone without a chaperone  
Hi chaperone my chaperone  
You may say sweet dreams tonight  
Blow me a kiss well I guess thats alright thats alright  
I cant go out alone without a chaperone  
Hi chaperone my chaperone  
You may say the streets are safe  
In these modern days but Im not OK  
I cant go out alone without a chaperone  
Hi chaperone my chaperone  
I cant go out alone without a chaperone  
Hi chaperone my chaperone  
Hi chaperone my chaperone  
Hi chaperone  
Hi chaperone Hi chaperone repeat
