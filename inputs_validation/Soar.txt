When they push when they pull  
Tell me you can hold on  
When they say you should change  
Can you lift your head high  
And stay strong  
Will you give up give in  
When your hearts crying out  
That its wrong  
Will you love you for you  
At the end of it all  
  
In life theres going to be times  
When youre feeling low  
And in your mind insecurity  
Seems to take control  
We start to look outside ourselves  
For acceptance and approval  
We keep forgettin that  
The one thing we should know is  
  
Chorus  
Dont be scared to fly alone  
Find a path that is your own  
Love will open every door  
Its in your hands  
The world is your  
Dont hold back and always know  
All the answers will unfold  
What are you waiting for  
Spread your wings and soar  
  
The boy who wonders  
Is he good enough for them  
Keeps tryin to please em all  
But he just never seems to fit in  
Then theres the girl who thinks  
Shell never be good enough for him  
Keeps tryin to change  
And thats a game shell never win  
  
Now In life theres going to be times  
When youre feeling low  
And in your mind insecurity  
Seems to take control  
We start to look outside ourselves  
For acceptance and approval  
We keep forgettin that  
The one thing we should know is  
  
Chorus  
  
In the mirror  
Is where she come face to face  
With her fears  
Her reflectionso foreign to her  
After all these years  
All of her life she has tried to be something  
Besides herself  
Now time has passed  
And shes ended up someone else with regret  
  
What is it in us that makes us feel the need  
To keep pretending  
Gotta let ourselves be  
  
Chorus x2
