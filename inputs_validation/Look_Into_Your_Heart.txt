This ones for you Curtis I love you

If you look into your heart  
With a positive mind  
Take some inventory of your woman and your glory  
Leave the bad things behind ooh  
Everybodys got a story yes they do  
About love and the good things  
But all the spices of your life  
You just got to pay the price
