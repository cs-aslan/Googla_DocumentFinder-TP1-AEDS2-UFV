It doesnt matter if Im right or wrong  
It really doesnt mean a thing  
It doesnt matter if you like my song  
As long as you can hear me sing  
Cause Im the thorn in every little girls rose  
You know I cut but never bleed  
A shadow in the night pure delight  
I can satisfy your every need  
  
Im a real smooth dancer Im fantasy man  
Master of illusion magic touch in my hand  
All the stages are empty when I steal the scenes  
A beggar of love second hand hero  
King of Dreams  
  
Dont make a difference what you got  
It doesnt matter what you lose  
Dont make a difference if you like it or not  
Baby Im gonna change your attitude  
Cause all around me there is mystery and wonder  
Now cant you see it in my eyes  
Ill crack the sky make you feel the thunder  
Youll never see through my disguise  
  
Im a real smooth dancer Im fantasy man  
Master of illusion with my sleight of hand  
All the stages are empty when I steal the scenes  
A beggar for love second hand hero  
King of Dreams  
  
All around all around  
Emotional squeeze through again and again  
I know how to please you your mind is on the bend  
Cant you feel the power surrender in my arms  
Beyond the witching hour were traveling on and on  
  
Im a real smooth dancer Im fantasy man  
Master of illusion magic touch in my hand  
The stages are empty when I steal the scenes  
A beggar of love second hand hero  
King of Dreams  
  
Im a real smooth dancer fantasy man  
Master of illusion sleight of hand  
The stages are empty when I steal the scenes  
A beggar for love  
King of Dreams
