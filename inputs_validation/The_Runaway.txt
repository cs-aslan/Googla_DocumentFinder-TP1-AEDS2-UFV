Never mind he whispered in my ear  
Could have been anyones mistake  
Lets just press rewind from here  
Call it quits for times sake  
  
Ring me twice then Ill know you need me  
Call me back right away  
Somebody told me youve been thieving  
Youre losing sight of the light  
  
Wanna know wanna know why youre breaking even  
Wanna know wanna know why youre breaking down  
  
From now on youll sleep with one eye open  
Keep your credit up hardly leave the house  
Theyll find you anywhere youre hiding  
I see you wont get out  
  
Wanna know wanna know why youre breaking even  
Wanna know wanna know why youre breaking down  
  
Back home  
Youre found out  
Back home  
Youre found  
  
Now youre back home  
Youre found out  
Back home  
Youre found
