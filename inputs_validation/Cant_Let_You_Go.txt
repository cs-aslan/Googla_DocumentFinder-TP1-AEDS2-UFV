Day after day I keep waking up  
To find that youre slipping away  
Night after night  
I cant fight the emptiness inside  
Nothing I can say  
Now I know youre turning me away  
Youre wearing a disguise  
You dont have to hide cause  
The truth is in your eyes tonight  
  
I dont want to live a lie  
But I dont want to say goodbye  
And I cant let you go even though its over  
I just cant let you go  
Though your love is growing colder  
  
One look in my eyes and youd realize  
That you got my heart in your hands  
Wont you let me know something more  
Where did we go wrong  
  
I dont want to fight  
All I want to do is try to understand  
Im reaching out for you babe  
What can I do  
Ive been holding on so long  
I dont want to live a lie  
But I dont want to say goodbye  
I cant let you go  
Even though its over  
I just cant let you go  
I feel your love is growing colder  
I dont want to live a lie  
But I dont want to say goodbye  
I want you by my side  
And I cant let you go  
Even though its over  
I just cant let you go  
I feel your love is growing colder  
I cant let you go even though its over
