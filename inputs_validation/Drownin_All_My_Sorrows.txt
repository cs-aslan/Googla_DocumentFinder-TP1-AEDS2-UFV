You ask me if Im lonesome you say youre feelin blue  
Go get lost little baby doll I dont wanna mess with you  
Im drownin all my sorrows I wanna be left alone  
For the one I love has left me  
She wont even answer the phone  
You ask me why Im cryin you just dont understand  
The one I thought was mine alone has found her another man  
Im drownin all my sorrows the lights are gettin kinda dim  
She left me for another I bet shell do the same thing to him  
  
Ill never trust a woman they never can be true  
They take your money break your heart  
And leave you feelin blue  
Im drownin all my sorrows I guess a guy like me cant win  
I dont know where Im goin I dont even know where I been  
Well my poor head is achin I just cant seem to think  
Pour me out a double please and pour this little gal a drink  
Ive drowned all my sorrows and now Im gonna have a plain  
Im glad my baby left me to me she never meant a thing
