There was a time you thought  
I was in love with you  
Well think again  
You cant read my thought  
Youre so pretty  
Id like to break your smile in two  
Youre so correct  
Id like to disconnect the dots  
Youre such a child  
But youre not innocent  
Another kid for rent  
  
Why do you send me roses  
Save them for someones death  
The love you have to offer  
Is only babys breath  
  
There was a time I thought  
You were magnificent  
But youve got nothing to have or to hold  
Youre so pensive  
But your thoughts are insignificant  
Wrap em up another twenty billion sold  
You think youre wild and you know  
What danger means  
In your designer jeans  
  
Why do you send me roses  
Save them for someones death  
The love you have to offer  
Is only babys breath  
  
Id like to have you alone tonight  
And rearrange your mind  
Id like to have you  
But I know Id be wasting my time  
  
Why do you send me roses  
Save them for someones death  
The love you have to offer  
Is only babys breath  
  
Why do you send me roses  
Save them for someones death  
The love you have to offer  
Is only babys breath
