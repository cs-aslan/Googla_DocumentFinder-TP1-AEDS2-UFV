Ive got a dream  
And every night I said to myself  
Yeah I said I gotta share it  
Share the dream with somebody else  
We could make a beautiful day  
Oh baby its a beautiful dream  
But what am I going to do with it baby  
Say what am I going to do with it baby  
What am I going to do with it baby  
Well if I cant share it with you  
I got some love  
And baby its the kind that will do  
Yeah I got a kiss  
And give it to someone like you  
The moon is shining up above  
And I got a heart full of love  
But what am I going to do with it baby  
Say what am I going to do with it baby  
What am I going to do with it baby  
But if I cant give it to you  
I cant throw it in the river  
And I cant toss it in the sea  
And I cant put it in a paper bag  
So baby come and get it from me  
Ive got a dream  
And every night I said to myself  
Yeah I said I gotta share it  
Share the dream with somebody else  
We could make a beautiful day  
Oh baby its a beautiful dream  
But what am I going to do with it baby  
Say what am I going to do with it baby  
What am I going to do with it baby  
But if I cant share it  
But if I cant share it  
Well if I cant share it with you
