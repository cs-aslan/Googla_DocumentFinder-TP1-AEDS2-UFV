When I look into your eyes  
Its like watching the night sky  
Or a beautiful sunrise  
Theres so much they hold  
And just like them old stars  
I see that youve come so far  
To be right where you are  
How old is your soul  
  
I wont give up on us even if the skies get rough  
Im giving you all my love Im still looking up  
  
And when youre needing your space to do some navigating  
Ill be here patiently waiting to see what you find  
  
Cause even the stars they burn  
Some even fall to the earth  
Weve got a lot to learn  
God knows were worth it  
No I wont give up  
  
I dont wanna be someone who walks away so easily  
Im here to stay and make the difference that I can make  
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use  
The tools and gifts we got yeah we got a lot at stake  
And in the end youre still my friend at least we did intend  
For us to work we didnt break we didnt burn  
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in  
I had to learn what Ive got and what Im not and who I am  
  
I wont give up on us even if the skies get rough  
Im giving you all my love  
Im still looking up still looking up  
  
I wont give up on us no Im not giving up  
God knows Im tough enough I am tough I am loved  
Weve got a lot to learn were alive we are loved  
God knows were worth it and were worth it  
  
I wont give up on us even if the skies get rough  
Im giving you all my love Im still looking up
