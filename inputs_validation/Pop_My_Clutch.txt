There may be some youngbloods  
Waitin in the wings  
Im puttin on my good duds  
So you can hear me sing  
I know what youre thinkin but  
This aint no one night stand  
Im savin all the good love  
For only one man  
Pop pop my clutch 4x  
Dont worry bout the weather  
In London or Rome  
Once we get together  
Youre gonna take me home  
Ive had plenty boyfriends  
Now I need a man  
To love me whatever  
And a ring on my hand  
Listen pretty baby  
I wont say it twice  
You could save me  
From my own device  
Honesty is so refreshing  
I dont get that much  
You just might be the blessing  
To make me pop my clutch  
Chorus  
I know what youre thinkin  
But this aint no one night stand  
Im savin the good stuff  
For only one man  
Listen pretty baby  
I wont say it twice  
You know you could save me  
I you pop it right
