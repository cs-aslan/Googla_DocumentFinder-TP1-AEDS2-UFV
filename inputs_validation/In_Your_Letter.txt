In your letter ooh in your letter  
In your letter ooh in your letter  
In your letter ooh in your letter  
In your letter ooh in your letter  
  
In your letter you said you didnt love me  
You said youre gonna leave me  
But you couldve said it better  
Oh in your letter you said you couldnt face me  
You said you could replace me  
But you couldve said it better  
  
You couldve left him only  
For an evening let him be lonely  
But you hid behind your poison pen and his pride  
You couldve told him something  
And proved to me you dont love him  
But you hid behind your future full of lies  
  
You couldve left him only  
For an evening let him be lonely  
But you hid behind your poison pen and his pride  
You couldve told him something  
And proved to me you dont love him  
But you hid behind your future full of lies  
  
In your letter you said you didnt love me  
You said youre gonna leave me  
But you couldve said it better  
Oh in your letter you said you couldnt face me  
You said you could replace me  
But you couldve said it better
