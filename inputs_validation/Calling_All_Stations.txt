Calling all stations  
Can anybody tell me tell me exactly where I am  
Ive lost all sense of direction  
Watching the darkness closing around me  
Feeling the cold all through my body  
Thats why Im calling all stations  
In the hope that someone hears me  
A single lonely voice  
  
I feel the sensation disappearing  
Theres a tingling in my arms  
And theres a numbness in my hands  
  
All the broken promises  
All my good intentions dont add up to very much  
And I realize whatever happened whatever happened  
I remember all the moments that Ive wasted in my life  
All the things I was always gonna do  
Why is it now when its too late  
That Ive finally realized its important to me  
To think that everything thats dear to me  
And is always in my heart  
Could so easily be taken  
And its tearing me apart  
Going over and over in my mind  
I relive it one second at a time  
  
Calling all stations  
Can anybody tell me tell me exactly where I am  
How different things look when your all on your own  
Watching the darkness closing all around me  
All around me  
And Im lost with feeling  
Of your arms to remind me  
Of everything thats dear to me  
And is always in my heart  
Could so easily be taken  
And its tearing me apart  
Going over and over in my mind  
I relive it one second at a time  
Dont you know theres never been a moment  
When I havent had the thought  
That everything thats dear to me  
And is always in my heart  
Could so easily be taken  
And its tearing me apart  
Going over and over in my mind  
I relive it one second at a time  
As I sit here in the darkness  
Feeling so alone  
And everything thats dear to me  
And is always in my heart
