All we seem to do is talk about it  
We always end up shouting about it  
There was a time we could overcome it  
But its too late to say well just forget it  
Its too bad that we had to break up  
And too much said for us to every make up  
I could get by if I could just forget you  
But things remind me and I feel so sad now  
  
I could say Im sorry  
But its not the point is it  
You want to play your games and  
You dont mind if I get hurt  
  
Same old feeling every time I see you  
And every avenue I walk Im behind you  
Your back is turned and your eyes are closed girl  
You move in circles that are out of my reach now
