Wash your face in the morning sun  
Flash your pan at the song that Im singing  
Touch down bass living on the run  
Make no sweat at the hole that youre digging  
Wrap up cold when its warm outside  
Your shit jokes remind me of Digsys  
Be my magic carpet ride  
Fly me down to capitol city in the sun  
Kicking up a storm from the day that I was born  
Sing a song for me one from let it be  
Open up yer eyes get a grip on yerself inside  
  
So wash your face in the morning sun  
Flash your pan at the song that Im singing  
Touch down bass living on the run  
Make no sweat at the hole that youre digging  
  
Kicking up a storm from the day that I was born  
Sing a song for me one from let it be  
Open up yer eyes get a grip on yerself inside  
Inside  
Yeah a grip inside  
Yeah a grip inside  
You betcha You betcha  
  
So wrap up cold when its warm outside  
Please sit down you make me fill giddy  
Be my magic carpet ride  
Fly me down to capitol city  
  
Ive been kicking up a storm from the day that I was born  
Sing a song for me one from let it be  
Open up yer eyes get a grip on yerself inside  
get a grip inside  
get a grip inside  
get a grip inside  
get a grip inside  
You betcha
