She aint your ordinary  
She aint your ordinary girl  
She dont love carelessly thats what Ive always heard  
Cant use the usual lines she measures every word  
No empty promises proof is what it takes to win her heart  
The truth and nothing less simple things that set her far apart  
Save your diamonds and your furs shes not your ordinary girl  
She aint your ordinary no shes not  
She aint your ordinary girl  
She aint your ordinary oh no  
She aint your ordinary girl  
No midnight alibis no foolish games for her  
And if you cross the line youll get what you deserve  
But when you see her smile nothing seems to matter anymore  
And in a little while youll feel like youve never felt before  
Like no other in the world shes not your ordinary girl  
She aint your ordinary no shes not  
She aint your ordinary girl  
She aint your ordinary oh no  
She aint your ordinary girl  
She aint your ordinary  
She aint your ordinary girl  
She aint your ordinary  
She aint your ordinary girl  
Save your diamonds and your furs she aint your ordinary girl  
She aint your ordinary  
She aint your ordinary girl  
She aint your ordinary  
She aint your ordinary girl  
She aint your ordinary  
She aint your ordinary girl  
She aint your ordinary  
She aint your ordinary girl  
She aint your ordinary  
She aint your ordinary girl
