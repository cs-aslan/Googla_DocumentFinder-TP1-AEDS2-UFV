Hold out just keep on hoping against hope its gonna get better  
Dont worry theres no hurry for you for me everythings gonna come around  
Shout out someone will listen to you to me someones gonna see  
  
He calls me over calls me brother and I know  
Always fighting and moonlighting it never ends  
In the city if youre all alone  
Theres a sister and shes standing next to her man  
In the darkness you feel the sharpness of steel  
And its always there in the city if youre all alone  
  
Reach out hands in the air dont care just what theyre saying  
Hold out just keep on hoping against hope its gonna get better  
Dont worry theres no hurry for you for me everythings gonna come around  
Shout out someone will listen to you to me someones gonna see  
  
If its gonna get better it starts with a feeling  
If its gonna get better its gonna take time  
If its gonna get better weve gotta start now  
Cause I know everybody can feel it  
And I know everybody will see it  
Cause it shows and that shows Im not dreaming  
Cause you know I know its time for a change
