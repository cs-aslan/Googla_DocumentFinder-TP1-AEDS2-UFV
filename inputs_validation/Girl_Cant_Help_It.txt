If he could hold her so close in his armsagain  
If she could show him  
The letter her heart forgot to sendwhy  
Theyre livin dreams on their own  
Ooh theyll never stop running  
  
The girl cant help it she needs more  
He hasnt found what hes lookin for  
Theyre still standing in the rain  
He cant help it and shes just that way  
  
And when he calls her  
She tells him that she still cares  
Under the moonlight  
He wonders why she cant be therewhy  
Why do they go on alone  
When theyre missin each other  
  
The girl cant help it she needs more  
He hasnt found what hes lookin for  
Theyre still standing in the rain  
He cant help it and shes just that way  
  
The girl cant help it she needs more  
He hasnt found what hes lookin for  
Theyre still standing in the rain  
He cant help it and shes just that way  
  
Theres a fire  
Ooh theres a fire in his eyes for you  
Dont you know she still cries  
Ooh do you know she still cries for you  
Fire  
Ooh theres a fire in his eyes for you  
For you she cries  
Ooh do you know she still cries for you  
Fire  
Ooh theres a fire in his eyes for you  
Ooh nothing stands between love and you
