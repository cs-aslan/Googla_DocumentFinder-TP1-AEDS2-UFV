I have been out wandering  
I have traveled far  
One conclusion I have made  
Is God dont own a car  
He dont wear no fancy clothes  
Hed rather take the bus  
He would pay a tourist fare  
So he could sit with us  
He dont have no tamborine  
Guitar or slide trombone  
The music we make here on earth  
The words they are his own  
And when we finally reach his home  
And walk among the stars  
Hell join our band then well understand  
Why God dont own a car  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la
