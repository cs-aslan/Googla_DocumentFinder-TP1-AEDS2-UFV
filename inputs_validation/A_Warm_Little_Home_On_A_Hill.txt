Theres a warm little home on a hill  
And the presents are hiding somewhere  
And the world is so peaceful and still  
You can almost hear love in the air  
  
Theres a blanket of snow on the ground  
And a bright little star in the sky  
And your heart knows that Santa is near  
By the twinkle in everyones eye  
  
Theres gift bringing and bells ringing  
And warm little feet by the fire  
There are kids playing and folks praying  
And somewhere the sound of a choir  
  
Theres two people that never will part  
And two stockings we still have to fill  
Theres a warm little place in my heart  
For our warm little home on the hill
