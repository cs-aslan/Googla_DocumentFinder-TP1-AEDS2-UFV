I danced with Linda  
I danced with Jean  
I danced with Cindy  
Then I suddenly see  
  
MaryAnne with the shaky hands  
What theyve done to her man  
Those shaky hands  
  
Mary is so pretty  
The prettiest in the land  
Guys come from every city  
Just to shake her shaky hands  
  
Linda can cook  
Jean reads books  
Cindy can sew  
But Id rather know  
  
MaryAnne with the shaky hands  
What theyve done to her man  
Those shaky hands  
  
MaryAnne with the shaky hands  
What theyve done to her man  
Those shaky hands  
  
MaryAnne with the shaky hands  
What theyve done to her man  
Those shaky hands
