Do you realize how long its been  
Where does all my time with you go  
And all the memories  
We shared as friends  
Reflected in my heart  
Is where they show  
  
Im loving every moment with you  
Im living in a dream thats comin true  
Im lost in everything you do  
I love you  
Im saving every moment for you  
Youre hidden in a place thats safe and true  
Lovin everything we do  
  
With every second  
You hold me near  
Im closer to a place I want to be  
To hear you whisper  
But no one else can hear  
I want your love  
To stay forever inside of me  
  
In our silence  
Looking in your eyes  
I hear words you dont need to say  
Just hold on Baby  
Cause its reason Im prayin  
You feel what I feel  
In every way
