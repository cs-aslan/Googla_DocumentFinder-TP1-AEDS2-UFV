Verse  
I dont know if I can open up  
Ive been opened enough  
I dont know if I can open up  
Im not a birthday present  
Im aggressive regressive  
The past is over  
And passive scenes so pathetic  
  
PreChorus  
I was fated faithful fatal  
I was fated faithful fatal  
  
Chorus  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
Ready to meet my maker  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
Im ready to meet my maker  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
And Ill rise to every occasion  
Im the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles  
Of Los Angeles  
  
Verse 2

Double cross glossed over in my pathos

I was fated faithful fatal  
I was fated faithful fatal

Ready to meet my maker  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic

And Ill rise to every occasion  
Im the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles  
Of Los Angeles  
  
Bridge  
I was fated faithful fatal  
I was fated faithful fatal

And Im ready to meet my maker
