Now let me tell you all  
A story of a truck drivin girl  
In a custommade monster truck  
She took for a whirl  
That little speed demon  
Gonna be a star  
With a learners permit  
And an adult in the car  
She may be out for a lark  
But she can parallel park  
Shes a truckdrivin girl  
Shes a truckdrivin girl  
  
Well someday shell get her license  
And shell have it all  
She can pick up her friends  
And take a drive to the mall  
That little redhead  
Gonna rock my world  
Shes a truckdrivin girl  
Shes a truckdrivin girl  
  
Shes a tirespinning geargrinding
