Dont close your eyes  
Or I might drift away  
Under the night  
My image bends its shape  
Ill be written on the wind  
Like in every sailers dreams  
Heading for the moon  
I reach out echoes  
My pulse begins to race echoes  
The crashing sounds  
Of fears Ive never faced  
Let them echo off these waves  
With thoughts as brave as they once were  
Heading for the moon  
And look  
How we write  
Over the white  
Shadows may chase from behind  
But just put them out of your mind oh  
Heading for the moon  
Dont close your eyes  
Or I might drift away  
Under the night  
Of never ending shapes  
Ill be wishing off the blue  
Ill still want to send my stars  
Heading for the moon  
And look  
How we write  
Over the white  
Shadows may chase from behind  
But just put them out of your mind oh  
Heading for the moon  
Ha ha  
Heading for the moon  
So dont close your eyes  
Heading for the moon  
Over the white  
Your shadows may chase from behind  
You might just put them out of your mind  
Heading for the moon
