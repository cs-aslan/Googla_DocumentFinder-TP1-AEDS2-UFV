What brings you around  
Did you lose something the last time you were here  
Youll never find it now  
Its buried deep with your identity  
  
So stand aside and let the next one pass  
Dont let the door kick you in the ass  
  
Theres no return from 86  
Theres no return from 86  
Theres no return from 86  
Theres no return from 86  
Dont even try  
  
Exit out the back  
And never show your head around again  
Purchase your ticket  
And quickly take the last train out of town  
  
So stand aside and let the next one pass  
Dont let the door kick you in the ass  
  
Theres no return from 86  
Theres no return from 86  
Theres no return from 86  
Theres no return from 86  
Dont even try  
  
Theres no return from 86  
Theres no return from 86  
Theres no return from 86  
Theres no return from 86  
Dont even try
