Kaie a ahouou  
Kay kalli nei  
Aahee ahah ee aha  
Couou alhoa  
  
This is the moment  
Of sweet aloha  
I will love you longer  
Than forever  
Promise me that you  
Will leave me never  
  
Here and now dear  
All my love I vow dear  
Promise me that you  
Will leave me never  
I will love you longer  
Than forever  
  
Now that we are one  
My darling  
Clouds wont hide the sun  
My darling  
Blue skies of Hawaii  
Smile on this  
Our wedding day  
  
I do I do  
Love you love you  
With all my heart  
  
I do I do  
Love you love you  
With all my heart
