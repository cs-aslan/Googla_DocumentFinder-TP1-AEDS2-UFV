Well its a cold world  
And Im in the middle  
Caught in the inbetween  
  
I dont belong here  
So Im writing to you  
Its wrong here  
Where Im sending you some  
  
Letters from earth yeah  
  
Well its a new world  
And now Im a stranger  
Stranger than you know  
  
I dont belong here  
And Im writing to you  
With blood on my hands  
  
What if I send you madness  
What if I send you pain  
And letters from earth ooh  
All right  
  
Come on its another game  
But you gotta play on  
Cause they say its just pretend  
Ask them why they say youll never never die  
Come on the game is called the end  
  
Well its a cold world  
And Im in the middle  
Caught in the inbetween  
  
I dont belong here  
So Im writing to you  
Hey let me explain  
  
What if I send you confusion  
What is the time and the pain worth  
Oh no no  
Im only sending  
Letters from the earth  
  
Letters from earth
