When he offers his hand  
Dont you turn him away  
He can lead you to light  
Through the darkest of days  
With his love wrapped around you  
You cant go astray  
When he offers his hand  
Dont you turn him away  
  
In a world full of sorrow  
A world full of hate  
You cant wait for tomorrow  
cause tomorrows to late  
Come and stand amongst the pilgrims  
In their golden array  
When he offers his hand  
Dont you turn him away  
  
I am no simon  
No matthew no paul  
It dont take an apostle  
To answer his call  
And it dont take a prophet  
To stand up and say  
When he offers his hand  
Dont you turn him away  
  
I hope as Im leavin  
My message is clear  
Its a fool that would turn down  
A gift thats so dear  
When he offers his blood  
Your depts to repay  
Now he offers his hand  
Dont you turn him away
