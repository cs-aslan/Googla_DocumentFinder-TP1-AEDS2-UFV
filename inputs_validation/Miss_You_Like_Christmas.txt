How long has it been  
cant remember when  
yeah its been awhile  
years look good on you  
but I expect them to  
I sure missed that smile  
Look you got me grinning  
bet Im blushing too  
dont have to be a genius  
to see the honest truth  
I miss you like Christmas baby  
thats just how its been  
theres that kind of message  
like we were back when  
Sure Ive gone on since you baby  
lost my heart a time or two  
I miss you like Christmas baby  
thats it I just do  
The leaves begin to change  
the first frost is back again  
all the cards and pumpkin pie  
Jingle Bells and Silent Night  
And an all familiar end  
I cant deny  
I miss you like Christmas baby  
thats just how its been  
theres that kind of message  
like we were back when  
Sure Ive gone on since you baby  
lost my heart a time or two  
I miss you like Christmas baby  
thats it I just do  
Ooh I miss you like Christmas baby  
thats it ooh I just do
