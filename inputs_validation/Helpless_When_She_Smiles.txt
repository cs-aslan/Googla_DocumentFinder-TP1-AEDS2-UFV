She keeps her secrets  
In her eyes  
She wraps the truth  
Inside her lies  
Just when I cant say  
What shes done to me  
She comes to me  
And leads me back to paradise  
  
Shes so hard to hold  
But I cant let go  
  
Chorus  
Im a house of cards  
In a hurricane  
A reckless ride  
In the pouring rain  
She cuts me and the pain  
Is all I wanna feel  
She tears away just like a child  
She drives me crazy  
Drives me wild  
But Im helpless when she smiles  
  
Oh when she smiles  
  
Maybe Id fight if I could  
It hurts so bad  
But feels so good  
She opens up just like  
A rose to me  
When shes close to me  
Anything shed ask me to  
I would  
  
Its out of control  
But I cant let go  
  
Chorus  
  
When she looks at me  
I get so weak  
  
Chorus
