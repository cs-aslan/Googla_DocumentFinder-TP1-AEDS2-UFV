Theres something in the way she moves  
Or looks my way or calls my name  
That seems to leave this troubled world behind  
And if Im feeling down and blue  
Or troubled by some foolish game  
She always seems to make me change my mind  
  
And I feel fine anytime shes around me now  
Shes around me now  
Just about all the time  
And if Im well you can tell shes been with me now  
Shes been with me now quite a long long time  
And I feel fine  
  
It isnt what shes got to say  
But how she thinks and where shes been  
To me the words are nice the way they sound  
I like to hear them best that way  
It doesnt much matter what they mean  
If she says them mostly just to calm me down  
  
Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning  
And I find myself careening  
Into places where I should not let me go  
She has the power to go where no one else can find me  
And to silently remind me  
Of the happiness and the good times that I know got to know
