All the ghosts in the schoolyard  
Young rebels with no dreams  
Dying of old age  
At seventeen  
Some blame their mothers  
For this unforgiving world  
Others point the finger  
At the flag the wind unfurls  
But I say  
You are the lock you are the key  
You are the master of your destiny  
The devils the dude who sells poison for pay  
Dont give the devil the time of day  
Dont you give him the room or and inch to play  
Dont give the devil the time of day  
Dont give the devil the time of day  
Theres a face in the mirror  
You dont recognize  
So you shatter the lights  
cause they sting your bloodshot eyes  
You walk on with a stranger  
Who rolls your soul up in his wad  
You place your trust in him  
Like you once placed it in god  
Well I say  
You are the lock you are the key  
You are the master of your destiny  
The devils the dude who sells poison for pay  
Dont give the devil the time of day  
Dont you give him the room or and inch to play  
Dont give the devil the time of day  
Dont give the devil the time of day  
Caught between the cyclone fence and a red brick wall  
Yeah you melt like chocolate in the sun  
Then you see your angel walking with his hightops on  
And he hands you heaven hotter than a loaded gun  
the time of day  
Dont you give him  
the time of day  
Dont you give him  
the time of day  
You are the lock you are the key  
You are the master of your destiny  
The devils the dude who sells poison for pay  
Dont give the devil the time of day  
Dont you give him the room or and inch to play  
Dont give the devil the time of day  
Dont give the devil the time of day  
All the ghosts in the schoolyard  
Young rebels with no dreams  
Dying of old age  
At seventeen  
Well I say  
You are the lock you are the key  
You are the master of your destiny  
The devils the dude who sells poison for pay  
Dont give the devil the time of day  
Dont you give him the room or and inch to play  
Dont give the devil the time of day  
Dont give the devil the time of day
