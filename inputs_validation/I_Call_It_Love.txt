I look at you  
You look at me  
You cant help it youre feeling butterflies  
Its obvious  
Theres some chemistry  
I think I know why it feels so right  
Girl I wanted so long to know  
Now youre telling me you gotta let it go  
Dont tell me I have to start all over again  
I never thought this day would come  
This is something that Ive wanted in my life  
I realize that youre the one  
And youre telling me its time to say goodbye  
Whats inside of my heart  
It aint gonna change  
So it shouldnt be so easy to walk away  
You feel it I feel it lets not pretend  
  
Chorus  
Baby I dont know what love is  
Maybe Im a fool  
I just know what Im feeling  
And its all because of you  
Dont tell me  
I dont know  
I want the truth  
Cause they call it  
We call it  
You call it  
I call it love  
  
Its so clear for you to see  
Dont let nobody tell you what to do  
Why they cant they just let us be happy  
I dont want to find somebody new  
If you know whats really in your heart  
Then dont let them tear us apart  
Cause you feel it I feel it lets think this through  
  
Chorus  
  
We have a bond thats unbreakable  
And its not time to let it go Were in love  
And now that we know its real  
We are going to let it show  
To the whole world  
That Im yours forever  
And youre my girl  
You are my girl  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Love  
They call it love  
I call it love
