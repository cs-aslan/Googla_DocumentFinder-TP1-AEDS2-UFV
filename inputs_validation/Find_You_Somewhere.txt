Im kinda lost now  
Dont intervening no meaning  
I have no cause now  
My heart is bleeding a tiny bit  
And it goes now  
Im only bleeding at you and me  
Can be awesome  
But thats not realistic  
Pain that youve inflected  
Its so wicked  
Im addicted  
Youre the place of shifted  
Aint no try to get physical  
I just wanna know  
Do you still wearing lipstick  
Youre so cryptic  
If Youve lost my drug  
And youve got me lifted  
Just one night come at the  
We can just be friends  
And well hold hands  
And dance until the night ends  
And Ill run the engines Engines  
And Ill let you finish all my sentences  
You right here right now  
Girl thats a blessing  
Just one night  
We should learn some lessons  
Looking so flatted while youre dressing  
Like this we can guess them all  
Get them all like a festival  
But the rush you go  
Im steady you just wanna pay  
Cant breathe like Im living in space  
Imma With ace  
Imma being mistakes  
Cause my life is a chase  
And Im in the race  
See that you wanna to taste  
 My hand wont waste  
I dont care what they say  
I wasnt really looking at you  
But they say you were here  
With that dude  
Is it true  
Ive been captured  
Weve been running like patrol  
Dont count that  
When the That  
Its about that  
Its a trick right there  
Little home you shout that  
Going down rewind that  
Were going up right now  
  
I think I can find you somewhere  
I think I can find you somewhere  
I think I can find you somewhere  
I think I can find you somewhere  
  
Dance  
  
Oh look girl look some precious  
All I see is true pics and restless  
Well I guess is I have to leave  
Till I have intrigue Something I cant believe  
Believe its like Jesus
