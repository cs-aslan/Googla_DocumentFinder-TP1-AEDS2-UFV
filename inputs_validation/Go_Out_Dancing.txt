Sometimes I wonder  
what this old worlds comin to  
where its all gonna end  
Cause I work all week  
tryn to save me a dollar  
but I get further in debt  
But now on in  
Im gonna spend time lovin  
find a baby sitter right now  
Put on your red dress  
high heels darlin  
tonight were going up town  
  
Were goin out dancin  
Were goin out dancin  
Were goin out dancin  
Chase our blues away  
  
I know a funny little place  
down on main street baby  
where the band will play all night long  
They play some hot rock n roll to fine syncopation  
and a brother on the saxophone  
We got one chance baby  
gotta be now or never  
Yeah I know as Im broke  
Were gonna make this weekend last forever  
come on honey put on your coat  
  
Were goin out dancin  
Were goin out dancin  
Were goin out dancin  
Chase our blues away  
  
Ive been lovin you for seven years I wont forget  
and I know its been hard sometimes  
open up the wine lets pretend we just met  
  
Well get home in the morning  
while the milk mans calling  
and the early birds start to sing  
I will roll you some breakfast  
and well jump into bed  
and well start all over again  
So hang on tight baby  
well go flyin  
give your man a big kiss  
Were gonna boogie on down  
from the Bronx to Manhattan  
memories are made of this  
  
Were goin out dancin  
Were goin out dancin  
Were goin out dancin  
Chase our blues away  
  
Dancin  
Were goin out dancin  
It may be the Bossanova  
It may be the twist  
It may be the Watusi  
It may be the Chachacha  
  
Just as long as were dancin  
come on baby dancin  
Take away our blues tonight  
take away my blues tonight  
Just as long as were dancin  
dancin dancin dancin
