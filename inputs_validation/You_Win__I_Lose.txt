You win I lose  
Thats how it all begins  
Well I try so hard in these affairs of the heart  
But I know that Ill never win  
  
Well I talk to you sweet like honey  
Dont I treat you as nice as pie  
But I cant figure out when you scream and you shout  
Why I have to apologize  
  
You win I lose  
Thats how it always goes  
I came into this thing with my heart in a spin  
I went out with a broken nose  
  
You win I lose  
Thats how its meant to be  
Well I tried all I can just to figure it out  
But loves just mystery  
  
Guess all you ladies would call me easy  
But Im a fool for the femme fatale  
When she flashes those eyes Im not a man Im a mouse  
Tryin to patch up a broken heart  
  
You win I lose  
Thats okay thats the way it goes  
Well I tried all I could but it did me no good  
Cause all Ive got is nothin to show  
  
They say that men are always supposed to act  
Like theyre not really tryin  
But when I come on cool nobody seems to notice  
Its a mystery  
Its a mystery to me  
  
You see you win I lose  
I guess thats how were meant to be  
I tried as hard as I could but it did me no good  
Youre more than a match for me  
And it dont make no sense to me  
Love is still a mystery  
Its just a mystery
