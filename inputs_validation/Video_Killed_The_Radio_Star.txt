I heard you on my wireless back in 52  
Lying awake intent on tuning in on you  
If I was young it didnt stop you coming through  
Ohaoh  
They took the credit for your second symphony  
Rewritten by machine on new technology  
And now I understand the supernova scene  
Ohaoh  
I met your children  
Ohaoh  
What did you tell them  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
In my mind and in my car we cant rewind weve gone too far  
Wow  
And now we meet in an abandoned studio  
You hear the playback and it seems so long ago  
And you remember the jingles used to go  
Ohaoh  
You were the first one  
Ohaoh  
You were the last one  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Cause in my mind and in my car we cant rewind weve gone too far  
To far  
Alright  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Cause in my mind and in my car we cant rewind weve gone too far  
Pictures came and broke your heart  
So put all the blame on vcr  
You are the radio star  
You are the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed that radio star yes it did
