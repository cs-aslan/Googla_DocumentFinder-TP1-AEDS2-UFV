Well its Tuesday night  
How Id like to be inside at this time  
Watchin tv is killin me  
Its such a drag tonight  
I feel like jason  
Just found a rusty fleece  
And the cyclops all laughin at me  
You cant tame wild east  
Wild east wild east  
Wild east wild east  
  
Now some cynic from the methadone clinic  
He keeps on bothering me  
He writes all my lyrics backwards on diapers  
And hangs em from the local trees  
Watch out white boy  
Dont argue with a sawn off piece  
Im a crazy son mama  
I love the grease of wild east  
Wild east wild east  
Wild east wild east  
Wild east wild east  
Wild east wild east  
  
Now Jezebel dont feel too well she talks to Jane  
bout a one way conversation on a subway train  
Hey they took away her wallet and her valise  
Love hate love hate love hate love hate wild east  
Wild east wild east  
Wild east wild east  
Wild east wild east  
Wild east come on crazy wild east
