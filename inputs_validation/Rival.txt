All my rivals will see what I have in store  
My gun  
Ive been harboring fleets in this reservoir  
Red sun  
And this nations about to explode  
  
Your disciples are riddled with metaphors  
Wellhung  
Better pony up and bring both your barrel fulls  
Not one  
As we release this unspeakable toll  
  
Hows our mother to damn these contributors  
With mud  
How will the man who made chemicals difficult  
Shed blood  
Hows our father supposed to be told
