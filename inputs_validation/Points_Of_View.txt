Im impossible shes exciting  
Bound together with joined up writing  
In the church  
I heard a bell ring  
In a bar  
I heard a girl sing  
She sings solo I see double  
Moments vanish her love so subtle  
I went home  
Its not surprising  
Words were few  
And realizing  
I was deep in my points of view  
So interested to talk to you talk to you  
She s romantic and Im selected  
Glances swapped and thoughts collected  
By her song  
Its not her singing  
Words were few  
The bell was ringing  
On the table my cards are shuffled  
Words take time to get so muddled  
Im off home  
Im shy but eager  
Tomorrow comes  
I hope to see her  
On the stage with her velvet voice  
Though some would say that its just a noise  
I bit off more than I could chew  
So interested in my points of view points of view  
  
Trial and jury swear on the bible  
Im too drunk and unreliable  
Im too drunk  
For conversation  
Though I wait for invitation  
Shes exciting Im uninvited  
Fifteen rounds this love Ive fighted  
Ill walk home  
And curse the heavens  
Lost on points  
Our love was flattened  
Maybe she had other things to do  
And didnt want any points of view
