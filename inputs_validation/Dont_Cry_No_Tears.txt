Dont cry no tears around me  
Dont cry no tears around me  
Cause when all the waters gone  
The feeling lingers on  
Old true love  
Aint too hard to see  
Dont cry no tears around me  
  
Well I wonder  
Whos with her tonight  
And I wonder  
Whos holding her tight  
But theres nothing I can say  
To make him go away  
Old true love  
Aint too hard to see  
Dont cry no tears around me  
  
Theres nothing I can say  
To make him go away  
Old true love  
Aint too hard to see  
Dont cry no tears around me  
Dont cry no tears around me
