Youre tellin lies so dont you criticize  
Yeah I got used all messed up and abused  
You let me down with all your runnin round  
Still you pretend and try to call me friend  
  
Dont say a word I know just what I heard  
Yeah youve been loose you just got no excuse  
Just feel my rage why cant you come of age  
I felt it all just like a cannonball  
  
Then you got mad you said that Im all bad  
So whats the use you lied and thats the truth  
You took the key and drove right out on me  
I never knew put all my trust in you  
  
OK thats it Im leaving now I quit  
I was unwise so dont apologize  
I paid the price for taking your advice  
I felt it all just like a cannonball  
  
You can say what you want all day  
But Ive never been so outraged  
Im washing my hands of you  
How could you be so untrue  
You know I cant stand no more  
You know I cant stand no more
