Every day of my life has been  
Leading me here tonight  
Feels like Im coming home  
Back to you back to you  
  
Every chance that I take  
Every wrong turn and every mistake  
Is a step on the road  
Back to you and Im alive  
  
I like it I like it I cant get enough  
I like it I like it yeah I get a rush  
I like what I like and I like it too much  
You know what I like yeah I get a rush  
  
And my goal I see you  
Youre as close as the hole in my shoe  
And when Im feeling used  
Im renewed I get high  
  
I can fly Ive got wings  
Ive got riches that money cant bring  
Ive got more than a king Ive got you  
And baby thats alright  
  
I like it I like it I cant get enough  
I like it I like it yeah I get a rush  
I like what I like and I like it too much  
You know what I like I get a rush from you  
  
Everything you do I call it love  
Yeah I get a rush I get a rush yeah  
  
Every day of my life  
Has been leading me here tonight  
And wherever I roam Im heading  
Back home to you back to you  
  
Cause I like it I like it I cant get enough  
I like it I like it yeah I get a rush  
I like what I like and I like it too much  
You know what I like yeah I get a rush  
  
I like it I like it I cant get enough  
I like it I like it yeah I get a rush  
I like what I like and I like it too much  
You know I like I get a rush from you  
  
Everything you do I call it love  
Yeah I get a rush I get a rush from you
