Chorus  
Try a little harder now  
Try a little harder now  
Try a little harder now  
Try a little harder now  
  
No one ever said it would be easy  
Doin whatever you do  
You just might have to suffer  
But keep on movin right through  
Youve got to  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometimes you have to change your tune  
To get where you want to be  
But dont you let that satisfy you  
You can have all you see  
  
Chorus
