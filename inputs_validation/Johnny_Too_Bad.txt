Walking down the road  
With a pistol in your waist  
Johnny youre too bad  
Walking down the road  
With a ratchet in your waist  
Johnny youre too bad  
  
Chorus  
Youre just robbin and stabbin  
And lootin and shooting  
Youre too bad repeat  
  
One of these days  
When you hear a voice say come  
Where you gonna run to  
One of these days  
When you hear a voice say come  
Where you gonna run to  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre gonna run to the rock  
For rescue therell be no rock  
Youre gonna run to the rock  
For rescue therell be no rock
