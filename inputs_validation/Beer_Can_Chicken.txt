Verse  
Seems like everythin thats good in life you gotta wait for  
My cant poke lumber dad said on a lake in Tennessee  
And its like sittin there and learnin just to watch  
The morning sunrise all I know is what it does to me  
  
Chorus  
Its like Friday night workin on a 3 day weekend  
Somethin in a jar just made for sippin  
Its feelin like a feel good time  bomb tickin  
Standin round waitin on a beer can chicken  
Its the lil things that make life worth livin  
  
Verse 2  
That old jambox playin in the background takes me somewhere  
Back to some ol late night country highway radio  
Ive got all my friends hangin out sittin right here with me  
I get this old feeling I just know  
  
Chorus  
Its like Friday night workin on a 3 day weekend  
Somethin in a jar just made for sippin  
Its feelin like a feel good time  bomb tickin  
Standin round waitin on a beer can chicken  
Its the lil things that make life worth livin  
  
Instrumental  
  
Bridge  
Would you look at this night that weve been given  
Its the lil things that make life worth livin  
Would you look at this night that weve been given  
It makes life worth livin  
  
Chorus  
Its like Friday night workin on a 3 day weekend  
Somethin in a jar just made for sippin  
Its feelin like a feel good time  bomb tickin  
Standin round waitin on a beer can chicken  
Its the lil things that make life worth livin  
Turn it up lets go Pretty girl dancing backroom  
By the seashore dirt track turn to 4  
Pedal to the metal gonna show ya what were here for  
6 strings good songs ol wooden bowl with a skull and a crossbow  
Full moon thats right Green grass good laughs  
Just waitin on high time and beer can chicken  
Just look at this life that weve been given
