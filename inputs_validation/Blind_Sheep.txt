Hey Just stop your domination  
You cant move on my personality  
Unconcerned you use manipulation  
Shamelessly  
  
Well you know youve got an education  
It simply fails to satisfy my needs  
Its a fools game  
Nobodys gonna rule me  
  
Oh those blind sheep  
Lead em to the slaughter  
Blind sheep  
Mothers hide your daughters  
Loves cheap  
Look at the smile on their faces  
Oh ho  
Blind leadin the blind leading the blind  
  
Hey hey hey  
Im tired of suffocation  
Oh but for talk  
You never follow through  
What I want is some hot and hard persuasion  
Endlessly  
  
Its so sad the sleazy innuendos  
Theyve brought so many victims to their knees  
Chain reaction  
Halfassed satisfaction  
  
Youve got me but a blind sheep  
Lead em to the slaughter  
Blind sheep  
Mothers hide your daughters  
Loves cheap  
Look at the smile on their faces  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Blind leading the blind leading the blind  
  
Deprivation just dont work on me  
Even affliction it just dont do it  
All I want is  
What I need is  
Blind sheep  
  
Its not fashion to you  
Youre just malicious  
Dont get trying  
Simply not judicious  
  
All I want is  
What I need is  
Blind sheep  
  
Such a city something exotic  
You autocrat  
Im simply not turned onto that  
  
All I want is  
What I need is  
Blind sheep  
  
debility  
Im by the side of the station
