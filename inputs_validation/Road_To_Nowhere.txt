Well we know where were goin  
But we dont know where weve been  
And we know what were knowin  
But we cant say what weve seen  
And were not little children  
And we know what we want  
And the future is certain  
Give us time to work it out  
  
Chorus  
Were on a road to nowhere  
Come on inside  
Takin that ride to nowhere  
Well take that ride  
  
Im feelin okay this mornin  
And you know  
Were on the road to paradise  
Here we go here we go  
  
Chorus  
  
Maybe you wonder where you are  
I dont care  
Here is where time is on our side  
Take you theretake you there  
  
Were on a road to nowhere  
Were on a road to nowhere  
Were on a road to nowhere  
  
Theres a city in my mind  
Come along and take that ride  
And its all right baby its all right  
  
And its very far away  
But its growing day by day  
And its all right baby its all right  
  
They can tell you what to do  
But theyll make a fool of you  
And its all right baby its all right  
  
Were on a road to nowhere
