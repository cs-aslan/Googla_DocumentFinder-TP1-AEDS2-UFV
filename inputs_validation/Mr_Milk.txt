Im sure I could make your hand fit mine  
If I deliver these custard trays on time  
Fourthirty AM dingdong rise  
I kiss her photo with the beam from the ash tray light  
Im sure I could deliver better  
If I pretended Id never met her  
She said shed love me sweeter  
If we made it to the pier for dinner  
Seven months in a ditch for the ring kept for her to decide  
If my milk trucks going to be her chariot ride  
Fourthirty AM dingdong rise  
Morning sun makes my sour heart pasteurise  
Im sure I could deliver better  
If I pretended Id never met her  
She said shed love me sweeter  
If we made it to the pier for dinner  
Welsh rarebit with a new dress on  
If that aint enough to make you smile  
Every Kintail Road kid knows  
When shes around then cheese goes dry
