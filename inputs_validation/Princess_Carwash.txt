Hang it up Sailor  
Your flag ship it burns  
And it burns and it burns  
You took the straight road  
You just missed the turn  
Youre out of gas out of gas  
Put on the red shoes  
A white knuckle ride  
Shes been denied deep inside  
And Ive got a crack whores dreams upon my tail  
Sweet love for sale love for sale  
I just want to ride in your car  
Ive got a back street style to pay the rent  
Im on my knees give me keys  
And Ive got a gun but the rents already spent  
Im out of cash out of cash  
And Ive got a crackwhores dream upon my tail  
Sweet Love for sale love for sale  
I just want to ride in your car  
She gets colder
