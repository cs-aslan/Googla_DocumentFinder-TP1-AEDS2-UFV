I was a city boy  
Caught up in a city way  
A nitty gritty boy  
Was out all night  
And always gettin blown away  
  
Chorus  
There aint no breeze to cool the heat of love  
  
She was a city girl  
With no responsibility  
A pretty little city girl  
All fired up and whats  
That got to do to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Its as clear as a  
Sunrise in Sedona  
Just what it is  
Thats blowin in the wind  
Its the fire in her eyes  
Its the tear when she cries  
Its the heat when I fall on my kneesyeah  
That Im thinkin of  
  
Chorus  
  
Its as clear as a  
Sunrise in Sedona  
Just what it is  
Thats blowin in the wind  
Its the fire in her eyes  
Its the tear when she cries  
Its the heat when I fall on my knees  
That Im thinkin of  
  
Chorus
