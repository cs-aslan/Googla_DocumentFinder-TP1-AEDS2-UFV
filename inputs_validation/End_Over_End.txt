Burn all the candles out  
Make a wish but not aloud  
Relive the here and now  
See you now and then  
Im a revolvin door  
Ive seen it all before  
I will begin again  
But I cant start until Ive seen you end  
  
I took a look around  
I believe that in these eyes  
The treasures all weve found  
May be more than needed  
Now that were old and worn  
A little ripped and torn  
One day well be reborn  
One day I will meet you up again  
Once again  
Wait  
Stop me so I can begin  
  
End over end Repeat x3  
Im circling  
End over end Repeat x3  
Im circling  
  
Im feelin out of luck  
Maybe I just feel too much  
That old familiar touch  
Always stained my skin  
The good in everyone  
The ties we left undone  
The heart that meets your blood  
All the things bring me round again  
Once again  
Wait  
Stop me so I can begin  
  
End over end Repeat x3  
Im circling  
End over end Repeat x3  
Im circling  
End over end Repeat x3  
Im circling  
End over end Repeat x3  
Oh yeah  
Hey  
Once again  
Wait  
Stop me so I can begin  
  
End over end Repeat x3  
Im circling  
End over end Repeat x3  
Im circling  
End over end Repeat x3  
Im circling  
End over end Repeat x3
