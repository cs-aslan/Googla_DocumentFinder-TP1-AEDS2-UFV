With my bag achallenging her knickers  
  
If you wanna know whats shakin down the house  
Ask the girl at the bottom of my glass

Coming at my lap with rum and bitters  
  
Slop my drink without that woman at the sink  
Ill grab my back with the rag and mittens  
  
If youre looking for that woman at the house  
Ask the girl at the bottom of my glass  
All right  
  
I cannot raise my drink without stopping to think  
That some bad babys givin me trouble
