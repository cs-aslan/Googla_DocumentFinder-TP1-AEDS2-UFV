Back in class Evil 101  
I always had so much fun  
Though the one who advised me  
Openly despised me  
Still I always tried to be number one  
  
Well I wanted a mentor to share my world view  
But I got a tormentor I was hated its true  
Now I have one more chance and it could mean my advancement  
So theres only one thing I must do  
  
I must impress my professor  
Hes got to be good  
I must impress my professor  
Hes misunderstood  
He needs validation for his evil creation  
  
Ooh ooh  
  
Like any good evil scientist would  
  
I must impress my professor to be a success  
  
He must impress his professor to be a success   
  
Or I will still be a flunky a diplomaless monkey  
  
Or he will still be a flunky a diplomaless monkey  
  
In the eyes of this person  
Whose opinion may worsen  
If my evil inventions not great  
  
I must impress my professor  
Impress his professor  
I must impress my professor  
Impress his professor  
I must impress my professor  
Before its too late
