Lord these words I beg of you  
As I kneel down at my bed  
Because soon I will be dead  
Lets face it soon I will be dead  
And I just want to  
I want to see the boy happy  
With some hope in his pale eyes  
Is that too much to ask  
Before I die  
I have one final dream  
For my own life I dont care anything  
  
Lord these words I beg of you  
As I kneel down at my bed  
Lets face it soon I will be dead  
And I just want to  
I want to see the boy happy  
With his arms around his first love  
Is that too much to ask  
Before I die  
I have one final dream  
For my own life I dont care anything  
And I just want to  
I want to see this boy happy  
Why is this such a bad thing
