And now Im going to do a song with great social and political influence  
It goes like this  
Oh Lord wont you buy me a Honda Accord  
Mercedes insurance I cannot afford  
If I drove a Porche Id still be ignored  
So oh Lord wont you buy me a Honda Accord  
Oh Lord wont you buy me some silicone implants  
The breasts that you gave me dont shake when I dance  
Them doctors make mountains out of hills made for ants  
So oh Lord wont you buy me some silicone implants  
Oh Lord wont you buy me a good looking male  
My boyfriend is lazy and big as a whale  
Spends all of my money when hes not in jail  
Oh Lord wont you buy me a good looking male  
Everybody  
Oh Lord wont you buy me a Honda Accord  
Mercedes insurance I cannot afford  
My cars held together by a big bungee cord  
So oh Lord wont you buy me a Honda Accord  
Thats it
