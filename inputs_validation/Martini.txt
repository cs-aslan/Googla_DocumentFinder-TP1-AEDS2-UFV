She was a new mean beauty queen  
Money drugs magazines  
That didnt do nothin  
That didnt do nothin  
They gave her diamonds  
Shiny boys city speak every toy  
That didnt do nothin  
No nothin for her  
You can  
Lead a horse to water  
But you cant expect it to drink  
Now aint that somethin  
Now aint that somethin  
Yea when the world is  
At youre gate that wont satiate  
Why are you crying  
If you work for nothing at all  
  
Dont be a fly in my martini baby  
Come on down  
That roof is high and Im not climbing  
Tonight come down and Ill give you  
Something hey to cry about  
  
Fast cars blue jean bars  
Trial and drowning scars  
It wont do nothing it wont do nothing  
Even the best frame wont change  
Your wet painting into the Mona Lisa the Mona Lisa  
Youve got to dry your eyes baby i know that your body will  
Cry if you want to cry if you want to  
If the world is at your gate and that dont fill your plate  
Why are you cryin  
If you work for nothing at all  
  
Mmmmm  
  
Dont be a fly in my martini baby  
Come on down  
That roof is high and Im not climbing  
Tonight come down and Ill give you  
Something hey to cry about  
  
A fly in my martini baby  
Come on down  
That roof is high and Im not climbing  
Tonight come down and Ill give you  
Something hey to cry about  
  
A fly in my martini baby  
Come on down  
That roof is high and Im not climbing  
Tonight come down and Ill give you  
Something hey to cry about  
  
A fly in my martini baby  
Come on down  
That roof is high and Im not climbing  
Tonight come down and Ill give you  
Something hey to cry about
