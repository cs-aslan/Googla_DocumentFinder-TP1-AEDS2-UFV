I was a debater  
Was not a stoner nor an inline skater  
Was not a player nor a player hater  
I was just a bookworm on a respirator  
Whos to say thats wrong  
I was in the chess club  
Didnt have a swimming pool much less a true love  
Didnt have a dalliance much less a hot tub  
I was just a brain whose brain never let up  
Whos to say thats wrong  
The twelve years after five  
Are years were lucky to survive  
Hang in there friends forever  
In memory far away  
Hang in there friends forever  
In memory far away  
Went out for the football team  
Found out the hard way that you cant live your Dads dream  
Had pretty thin skin to be in the machine  
Then I found a guitar and the rests a fanzine  
Whos to say thats wrong  
The moral of the song  
Is that the high school kids are wrong  
You know they have been all along  
Come graduation day youll be gone  
Hang in there friends forever  
In memory far away
