I dont want to spend my life trying to change you  
This time Im gonna take it as it comes  
There are so many things that I want to ask you  
I am unafraid of what the answers may be  
  
Oooo oooo oooo oooo oooo  
Before you walk away  
And start burning any bridges  
Oooo oooo oooo oooo oooo  
This womans not the one you knew  
Theres been so many changes  
  
Please dont turn my love away  
Dont turn my love away  
Im gonna love you like no ones ever done before  
Oh please dont turn your love away  
Turn my love away  
Im gonna show you a love like youve never known  
  
We travel so many roads in a lifetime  
In search of a promise Promise of a dream come true  
And now that Ive found you  
Like a falling star falling from the midnight sky  
Ive got to let you know  
  
If only I knew then  
If I knew then what I know now  
Babe I got no doubt that youd be mine  
Baby got no doubt that youd be mine  
No doubt in my mind youd be mine  
  
Please dont turn my love away  
Dont turn my love away  
Im gonna love you like no ones ever done before  
Oh please dont turn away my love away  
Turn my love away  
Im gonna show you a love like youve never known  
  
Dont you turn away run away and leave me this way  
Dont you turn away dont you run away
