They say that some people never grow up  
Lost in time shackled to the past for ever stung by love  
Still weaving still believing yesterdays dreams  
If life is real then so is my imagination  
All I feel is who I am Who I am Who I am  
And if I wished so hard I bled would you come true  
All I needs a bottle and the memories come flooding back  
And I see you though the rain through the rain through the rain  
They say you can never go back  
What if my loves still the same  
Still the same still the same still the same  
Still the same still the same  
When love goes right its the ultimate high you can be on  
Oh baby Ive lost count of the times when things went wrong  
Bit I pick myself up and I carry on on and on and on and on  
And on and on it goes  
I cant pretend imaginary friends are better  
All I know is people change people change people change  
They say Im supposed to forget and go on  
What if my loves still the same Still the same  
Still the same still the same still the same  
Still the same still the same still the same  
Still the same still the same still the same  
Oh baby now  
What if your love what if your love is still the same  
What if your love what if your love is still the same  
What if your love what if your love is still the same  
What if your love what if your love is still the same  
What if your love what if your love is still the same
