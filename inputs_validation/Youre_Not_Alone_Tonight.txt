We all drink to forget  
Some of us more than most  
When reality gets too real  
And the fires of hell to close  
But Im here to let you know that  
That you can make it through  
If you believe that someone is watchin over you  
  
Chorus  
And call it an angel  
Call it a muse  
And call it karma that youve got comin to you  
Whats the difference  
Whats in name  
What matters most is never ever losin faith  
Cause its gonna be alright  
Youre not alone tonight  
  
We all have our days  
When nothing goes as planned  
Not a soul in the world  
Seems to understand  
And for someone to talk to  
Youd give anything  
Well go on and cry out loud  
Cause someones listenin  
  
Chorus  
  
Keep your faith alive  
Youre not the only one  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh you can cry if you want to go on
