Dont let there be  
Something sour in my coffee  
Theres fourteen year olds  
Screaming get out of my country  
I wont let him rise just to say goodbye  
  
Hourly daily  
  
The August cold  
Brings something bad in its sock drawer  
Theres too much hate  
Covering up those once white walls  
I dont want my boy thinking Im only to avoid  
Tread safe  
  
Hourly daily  
  
Hes the spitting image and the oldest of two  
Now what kind of mess have you gone and gotten yourself into  
  
Make a morning pledge  
To the heart of the city quiet  
Pray the daybreak sun  
Can fill up the halls of a sleepless night  
Bring one good face into this house today  
  
Hourly daily  
  
Hes the splitting image and the oldest of two  
Now what kind of mess have you gone and gotten yourself into
