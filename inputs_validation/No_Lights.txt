You know when I think of you  
And I feel to let it out  
For what we did pursue  
And all we were about  
And when I think of Who  
Flooding me with light  
Dont think you need to hear this  
Yeah you did it right  
  
Chorus  
Its over but yeah we have taken the light  
Its over by winning for losing the fight  
Over its over its over  
Its gone into flight  
Right here by my side  
As I ride  
  
I found meaning  
In the words that you would speak  
And I found strength  
Inside the fact that we were weak  
And when I picture you  
Covered in our rags  
If this man shall fall  
Who will take the flag  
  
Hard rubber and a windblown face  
Got a fullblown eighteight  
To get us home  
No trouble got an extra ace  
A standup throwup  
Never let me be alone  
Over its over its over  
Youve taken my lights  
Over its over its over  
Right here by my side  
As I ride  
  
To have known you  
Still helps to get me through  
And to thank you now  
Is all that I could do  
And when I motor on  
On into the night  
I know that you are there  
I know you are my lights  
  
Over its over its over  
Youve taken my lights  
Over its over its over  
Right here by my side  
As I ride  
Theres no light  
As I ride
