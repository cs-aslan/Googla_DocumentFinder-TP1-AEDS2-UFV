If only you could see the tears  
In the world you left behind  
If only you could heal my heart  
Just one more time  
Even when I close my eyes  
Theres an image of your face  
And once again I come to realise  
Youre a loss I cant replace  
  
Soledad  
Its a keeping for the lonely  
Since the day that you were gone  
Why did you leave me  
Soledad  
In my heart you were the only  
And your memory lives on  
Why did you leave me  
Soledad  
  
Walking down the streets  
Of Nothingville  
Where our love was young and free  
Cant believe just what an empty place  
It has come to be  
I would give my life away  
If it could only be the same  
Cause I cant still the voice inside of me  
That is calling out your name  
  
Time will never change the things you told me  
After all were meant to be  
Love will bring us back to you and me  
If only you could see
