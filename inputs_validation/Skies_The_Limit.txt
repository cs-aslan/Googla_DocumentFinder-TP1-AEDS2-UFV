If Ive been acting a little strange  
And you have noticed it too  
Its cause my life has been rearranged  
With the presence of you  
The sky is the limit now  
We can hit it on the nail  
  
And when we do  
Ill think about you  
How can we fail  
Can you give me one reason why  
Youd ever let me down  
  
I wont believe it baby but Ill try  
The truths goin to come around  
The sky is the limit now  
We can hit it on the nail  
And when we do  
  
Ill think about you  
How can we fail  
The sky is the limit  
Oh the sky is the limit  
  
How can we fail  
Sooner or later  
Ill keep the promise  
  
I made you  
Sooner or later  
It will be greater  
Than we ever knew  
The sky is the limit now  
We can hit it on the nail  
  
And when we do  
Ill think about you  
The sky is the limit now  
We can hit it on the nail  
  
And when we do  
Ill think about you  
How can we fail  
The sky is the limit  
The sky is the limit  
Oh the sky is the limit  
  
How can we fail  
The sky is the limit  
Oh the sky is the limit  
How can we fail
