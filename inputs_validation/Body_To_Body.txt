Touching me the way you do you know know youve got to feel it too  
When you bodys next to mine youve got me hypnotized

Oh what you do  
Flowing through this magic night  
I love to feel you hold me tight  
You are the one thats right for me  
You got me feeling tingaly  
Share the night with stars above  
I think Ive found this thing called love  
Fever running through your eyes  
You are my heavenly device  
Body to body

You know I like what you do when you do what you do to me no  
Oh what you do  
You opened up the world to me  
You changed my life so tenderly  
I know you are the only one  
Youre brighter than the burning sun  
Dont know where youre going to  
I dont care as long as Im with you  
That certain sparkle in your eyes  
Has got me feeling oh so high  
Body to body  
Body to body  
Body to body  
Body to body  
I like what you do when you do all those things to me  
Body to body
