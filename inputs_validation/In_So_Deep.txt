My ideas like highs  
They come and they go  
It seems Ive forgotten what I need to know  
I feel Im wasting time at night when I sleep  
  
Someone so shallow thats in so deep  
So I patch the holes that yet havent appeared  
Completely blinded but things are so clear  
I know just what to do but why the fuck should I bother  
  
Im content sitting at the right hand of our father  
Fuckin A is all I got to say  
Give me peace of mind and Ill be on my way  
I was born into this world and I dont know why  
So all Im doings passing time before I die
