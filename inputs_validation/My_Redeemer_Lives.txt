I know He rescued my soul  
His blood has covered my sin  
I believe I believe  
  
My shame Hes taken away  
My pain is healed in His name  
I believe I believe  
  
Ill raise a banner  
Cause my Lord  
Has conquered the grave  
  
My redeemer lives  
My redeemer lives  
My redeemer lives  
My redeemer lives  
  
I know He rescued my soul  
His blood has covered my sin  
I believe I believe  
  
My shame Hes taken away  
My pain is healed in His name  
I believe I believe  
  
Ill raise a banner  
Cause my Lord  
Has conquered the grave  
  
My redeemer lives  
My redeemer lives  
My redeemer lives  
My redeemer lives  
  
My redeemer lives  
My redeemer lives  
My redeemer lives  
My redeemer lives  
  
You lift my burdens  
Ill rise with You  
Im dancing on this mountain top  
To see Your kingdom come  
  
My redeemer lives  
My redeemer lives  
My redeemer lives
