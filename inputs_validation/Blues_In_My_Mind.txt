I ought to hate you for these blues in my mind  
What makes me love you am I losing my mind  
I wonder where Im gonna wind up  
I just cant make my crazy mind up  
  
Too many kisses brought me too many tears  
Tears that Ill carry with me all through the years  
Im just the broken hearted kind  
Worrying blues in my mind  
  
Im going crazy with these blues in my mind  
How can you just keep on confusing my mind  
Youve got a jealous air about you  
Maybe Im better off without you  
  
Still I cant make my heart believe that its true  
Trouble with me is having trouble with you  
Im just the broken hearted kind  
Worrying blues in my mind  
Worrying blues in my mind
