Come along lets park lets park  
Cant you see whats going on  
Come along gotta get with it  
Youre space bound and going strong  
And he said  
Come along lets rock  
Shake your body dont stop  
Cause Im never out of fuel  
Youre good at talkin  
But at listenin you aint so cool  
So you better get with it baby  
Chorus  
Earth to Mickey  
When are you gonna land  
Earth to Mickey  
When are you gonna land  
Why cant you just come on down  
Down to my level here  
Tonight Im watchin you  
And you wouldnt understand  
How could you ever get so spaced out  
And never ever land  
I just wanna tell you  
Youre outta your mind  
Itll take a little time  
But I bet I can talk you down  
There are unnurtured treasure  
Right here on solid ground  
So you better get with it baby  
Repeat chorus  
Hear me talkin to ya mickey  
Mickeys rap  
Excuse me but its hard to hear  
Cause Im way up in the stratosphere  
I caught your drift  
But I still dont see  
I changed my long distance company recently  
Im not a guy thats kinda shy  
I gotta get home before my goldfish die  
My friends say I caught your eye  
They say you like the way I tie my tie  
I dont know why you wanna stare  
Dont touchi just combed my hair  
push  
Please talk me down  
Wheres the ground  
Hold on you better slow down  
You might be fore your time  
I think you got kicked out  
From the white school of bump and grind  
Mickey come along lets walk  
Can we have a little talk  
Youve been busted in midflight  
Whenever youre puzzled you just  
Put on your big red light  
Chakas rap  
You know I know what they mean now  
When they say that youre all dressed up  
And nowhere to go  
Mickey really I been tryin to talk to you  
All night Ive been lookin at you  
And lookin at you  
And tryin to talk and talk  
But you just dont listen  
Youre on some eternal flight  
I just cant seem to make you make sense  
Mickey Mickey  
Repeat chorus  
Ad lib to fade
