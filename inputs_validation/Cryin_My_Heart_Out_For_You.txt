How do you live with a broken heart  
Everytime you come too close  
I just run away  
I need you so much  
And thats so hard to say  
There is me and there is you  
And I get confused  
And sooner or later  
I know that Ill have to choose  
  
You know its true  
Im crying my heart out for you  
What can I do  
Im losing myself over you  
Over and over again  
Im crying my heart out for you  
No one in love likes to lose  
How do you live with a broken heart  
  
And I can honestly say  
I want to be on my own  
That too bare existence  
When I was all alone  
I know youre not asking me  
To just live for you  
But its always how Ive loved  
And all I know how to do  
  
You know its true  
Im crying my heart out for you  
What can I do  
Im losing myself over you  
Over and over again  
Im crying my heart out for you  
Noone in love likes to lose  
  
But how do you live with a broken heart  
Once again Im falling in love  
Like a fool Im falling in love  
And I dont know what Im doing  
  
Once again its somebody else  
That I need Im losing myself  
And Im scared of what Im feeling  
  
Its true  
Im crying my heart out for you  
What can I do  
Im losing myself over you  
Over and over again  
Im crying my heart out for you  
No one in love likes to lose  
  
Once again Im falling in love  
Like a fool Im falling in love  
And I dont know what Im doing doing  
  
Once again its somebody else  
That I need Im losing myself  
And Im scared of what Im feeling  
  
About you  
Im crying my heart out for you  
What can I do  
Im losing myself over you  
Over and over again  
Im crying my heart out for you  
What can I do  
Im losing myself over you  
Over and over again
