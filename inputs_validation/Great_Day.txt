When youre wide awake  
Say it for goodness sake  
Its gonna be a great day  
While youre standing there  
Get up and grab a chair  
Its gonna be a great day  
  
And it wont be long oh no  
It wont be long it wont be long no no  
It wont be long it wont be long oh no  
It wont be long it wont be long ooh yeah  
  
Ooh ooh yeah  
Gonna be a great day  
  
And it wont be long oh no  
It wont be long it wont be long no no  
It wont be long it wont be long oh no  
It wont be long it wont be long oh  
  
When youre wide awake  
Say it for goodness sake  
Its gonna be a great day  
While youre standing there  
Get up and grab a chair  
Its gonna be a great day
