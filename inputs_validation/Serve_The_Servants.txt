Teenage angst has paid off well  
Now Im bored and old  
Selfappointed judges judge  
More than they have sold  
  
If she floats than she is not  
A witch like we had thought  
A down payment on another  
One at Salems lot  
  
Serve the servants  oh no  
That legendary divorce is such a bore  
  
As my bones grew they did hurt  
They hurt really bad  
I tried hard to have a father  
But instead I had a dad  
  
I just want you to know that I  
Dont hate you anymore  
There is nothing I could say  
That I havent thought before  
  
Serve the servants  oh no  
That legendary divorce is such a bore
