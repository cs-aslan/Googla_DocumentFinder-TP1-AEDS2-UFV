You can go but be back soon  
You can go but while youre working  
This place Im pacing round  
Until youre home safe and sound  
Fare well but be back soon  
Who can tell where dangers lurking  
Do not forget this tune  
Be back soon  
  
How could we forget  
How could we let  
Our dear old Fagin worry  
We love him so well come back home  
In a such a great big hurry  
  
Its him who plays the piper  
Its the one that pipes his tune  
So long fare the well pip pip cheerio  
Well be back soon  
  
You can go but be back soon  
You can go but bring back plenty  
Of pocket hankerchieves  
And you should be clever thieves  
Whip it quick and be back soon  
Theres a sixpence here for twenty  
Aint that a lovely tune  
Be back soon  
  
Our pocketsll hold a watch of gold  
That chimes upon the hour  
A wallet fat  
An old mans hat  
  
The crown jewels from the tower  
We know the bow street runners  
But they dont know this tune  
So long fare the well pip pip cheerio  
Well be back soon  
  
Cheerio but be back soon  
I dont know somehow Ill miss yya  
I love ya thats why I  
Say cheerio not goodbye  
Dont be gone long be back soon  
Give me one long last god bless ya  
Remember our old tune  
Be back soon  
  
We must disappear well be back here  
Today perhaps tomorrow  
Well miss you too  
  
Its sad but true  
That picking  
Is such sweet sorrow  
  
And when were in the distance  
Youll hear this whispered tune  
So long fare the well pip pip cheerio  
Well be back soon  
  
We must disappear  
Well be back here  
Today perhaps tomorrrow  
Well miss you too  
Its sad but true  
That parting is such sweet sorrow  
And when were in the distance  
Youll hear this whispered tune  
So long fare the well pip pip cheerio  
Well be back soon  
  
Cheerio but be back soon  
I dont know somehow Ill miss you  
I love you thats why I  
Say cheerio not goodbye  
Dont be gone long be back soon  
Give me one long last god bless you  
Remember our old tune  
Be back soon  
  
And when were in the distance  
Youll hear this whispered tune  
So long fare the well pip pip cheerio  
Well be back soon  
  
So long fare well pip pip cheerio
