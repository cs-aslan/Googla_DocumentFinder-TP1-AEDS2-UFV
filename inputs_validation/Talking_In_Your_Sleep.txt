Chorus  
I heard you talking in your sleep  
Is there anything that I can do  
I dont believe weve had a word all day  
Bout anything at all  
  
I heard you talking in the night  
Thats right yes I heard ya call  
Though I could hardly hear the name you spoke  
Its a name I dont recall  
I heard you softly whisper  
I reached out to hold you near me  
Then from your lips there came that secret  
I was not supposed to know  
  
Chorus  
  
I heard you talking in the night  
Thats right yes I heard ya call  
Though I could hardly hear the name you spoke  
Its a name I dont recall
