Bitch ass nigga was talkin all this shit right  
Im like damn you bitch ass nigga  
I should sock you in your motherfuckin mouth  
Talkin all this shit about my homie  
So I chirped him chirpchirp  
Hey cause this nigga talkin all this shit right  
Boom the homie came up and was like  
Nigga say that shit in my motherfuckin face  
Popped him dead in his motherfuckin mouth nigga  
Niggaz be talkin all this shit  
The only thing I wanna know is look  
  
Chorus  
See when the drama pop off then pardon me it aint my fault  
My back was up against the wall thanks to yall  
Niggas talkin like bitches  
You need to say it to my face if you got somethin to say bout me  
Cause thats the way its supposed to be but you aint no G  
Niggas talkin like bitches Wishin you could be like me  
  
Sometime men got some more than women  
You do too good in Cali the prey start to turn to venom  
You cant walk in these shoes nigga you cant fit em  
Im bout five seconds away from the lets go get him  
So nigga say it to my face if youre feelin like King Kong  
Mysery love company I guess Im a leave yall  
Until that day you wanna tuck them nuts  
And try to hit my switches and get your frame fucked up  
You gotta say it to my face Im right here with a 12gauge  
You talkin to a man that plan on dyin of old age  
Until that day I crush everything in my way  
And give a fuck about what yall say  
  
Chorus  
  
Too much of anything makes you a addict  
Wantin contact with another man makes you a faggot  
Patience is virtue dont make me hurt you  
I came full circle aboutface reversal  
Salute the general make yourself presentable  
Analytical every move made political  
Say it to my face and wake up in a hospital  
Huh gutter never takin me under  
Fuckin nerve of you motherfuckers  
Thinkin I was slippin I was servin you motherfuckers  
X went off the deep end Im determined you motherfuckers  
So watch how you speakin  
Cause Im listenin closely for any pussy approachin me  
  
Chorus  
  
Nigga you better come with the Taliban  
Never been a slave or afraid of another man  
X move like the brutal force of an avalanche  
It aint my fault you smoked off your chance  
See motherfuckers envy what they cannot be  
Mr X to the Z HNIC  
Shh half assed niggaz gon shit on me  
If they sentence me to five Ill be out in three  
Youll be deep in the dirt for the bugs to eat  
Tucked in for eternity time to sleep  
Til that day Ill crush everything in my way  
And give a fuck about what yall say  
  
See when the drama pop off then pardon me it aint my fault  
My back was up against the wall thanks to yall  
Niggas talkin like bitches  
You need to say it to my face if you got somethin to say bout me  
Cause thats the way its supposed to be but you aint no G  
Niggas talkin like bitches Wishin you could be like me  
Niggas talkin like bitches
