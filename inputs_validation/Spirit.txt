One day youre up next day  
Youre down  
Where does it end  
War in the east war in the south  
No one can win  
  
Hunger and strife taking the lives  
Brothers and friends  
Young people grow way much  
Too fast  
To realize  
  
Chorus  
That the spirit brightens up  
The sun  
Everything in life must be as one  
  
Nations collide defending  
Their pride  
Blood is the price  
The price is too high no need  
To die  
Lets turn it around  
Lets change the face the  
Human race  
Progress will come  
Just take the time look deep  
Inside  
Well understand  
  
Chorus  
  
Cant you feel the spirit  
Grow into the light  
Cant you see the spirit  
Glowing in the night
