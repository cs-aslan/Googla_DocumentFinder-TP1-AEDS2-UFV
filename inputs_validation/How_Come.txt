How come when I got the ace of hearts  
Ya always draw the ace of spades  
Hows it when your best friend  
Brings you lillies on your birthday  
  
Hey how come hey how come  
Well I aint superstitious but well these things I see  
How come how come  
I aint a superstitious fella but it worries me  
  
How come when your local clergy calls  
He tells me that you shouldnt wear black  
What kind of bread are you gonna bake  
With that hemlock in your spice rack  
  
Hey how come hey how come  
Well I aint superstitious but well these things I see  
How come how come  
I aint a superstitious fella but it worries me  
  
The spiders run the cobwebs gone  
Did you eat it when the moon was new  
I drowned your cat what do you say about that  
Ive even broken up your broom  
  
How come how come  
Well I aint superstitious but well these things I see  
How come how come  
I aint a superstitious fella but it worries me  
Well how come how come  
Well I aint superstitious but well these things I see  
How come how come  
I aint a superstitious fella but it worries me
