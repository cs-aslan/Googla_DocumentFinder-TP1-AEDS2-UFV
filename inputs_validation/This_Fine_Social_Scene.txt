Blossom lipped ladies and men with a gleam in their eyes  
Fat happy babies sit on their born thin mothers thighs  
Picture a vow  
Picture well  
  
I couldnt see the cracks in this fine social scene  
I couldnt find the fault with this whole pantomime  
  
All others laughing the jokes by the host  
Hes no man  
  
All others dancing in couples to these session bands  
Wearing smiles  
Hot colt 45s  
  
I couldnt see the cracks in this fine social scene  
I couldnt find the fault with this whole pantomime
