Well I gave you love you know it  
So when did you outgrow it  
And decide that you would find another man  
  
Well youve been out there shakin  
Tell the boys youre chansing  
When you get home Ill be the bigger man  
  
Ive been thinkin bout somethin  
Ive been thinkin bout somethin other than you  
  
Well I know your reputation  
Cause you send my heart racing  
You think I would always be the fool  
  
Well Ive run out of patience  
For this sticky situation  
You wont find me crying that were through  
  
Ive been thinkin bout somethin  
Ive been thinkin bout somethin other you  
Its sad to say but baby everyday  
Ive been thinkin bout somethin  
Ive been thinkin bout somethin other than you  
Its sad to say hey  
  
Well if youre not too proud to beg  
I can give you some respect  
That tune youre humming is never gonna change  
  
You didnt have to do what you did  
I didnt think youd end it like this  
Cause the love Ive got it better than what you gave  
  
Well Ive got girls in line  
Waiting for these arms of mine  
Listen up to what I say  
  
Ive been thinkin bout somethin  
Ive been thinkin bout somethin other than you  
Its sad to say but baby everyday  
Ive been thinkin bout somethin  
Ive been thinkin bout somethin other than you  
  
Hey hey I took my best shot  
Ive had enough of your tainted love you give me everyday  
I tried to limit the loney nights  
But darlin please cmon cmon  
Im not gonna make that same mistake  
  
Youve been out there foolin but Im not thinkin bout you  
Ive been getting the love that moves me while youve been getting around  
  
Youve been out there foolin but Im not thinkin bout you  
Ive been getting the love that moves me while youve been getting around  
  
Youve been out there foolin but Im not thinkin bout you  
Ive been getting the love that moves me while youve been getting around
