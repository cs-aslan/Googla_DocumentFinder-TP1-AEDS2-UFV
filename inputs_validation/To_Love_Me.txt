I donT wanna talk about it anymore  
As far as IM concerned youD best be out that door  
IM tired of making things work out all by myself  
I suggest you go and find somebody else ooh  
I thought I couldnT live without you here with me  
Guess I was just A fool I was too blind to see  
Now I ainT gonna make the same mistakes again  
Oh I canT believe how hard it is for you to understand  
That to love me  
You gotta be true youVe gotta be true  
YouVe got to know just what to say  
canT tell you what to do  
You wouldnT make me cry  
WouldnT hurt me this way  
It really is easy to love me  
I remember when we used to talk used to talk and  
I remember when we used to walk hand in hand  
ID see how much you love me when I looked into your eyes  
But now it seems like no matter what I do or say  
To try to show you how much I miss our yesterday  
I just canT get through to you  
What I must do to make you realize  
That to love me  
You gotta be true youVe gotta be true  
Got to know just what to say canT tell you what to do  
You wouldnT make me cry  
WouldnT hurt me this way  
It really is easy to love me  
Ooh I wanna feel that way again  
Tryin hard to fight the pain from deep within  
I donT wanna let go after all that weVe been through  
But if you donT feel the same anymore  
If you no longer love me like you did before  
Just tell me so ILl know what IM supposed to do  
Save my heart for someone who  
Someone who will love me  
WhoLl always be true whoLl always be true  
WhoS gonna know just what to say  
WhoLl always know what to do  
WhoLl never make me cry  
Never hurt me this way  
It really is easy to love me  
Ooh I remember when you used to love me  
You used to love me  
Ooh ooh  
I remember mmmmm
