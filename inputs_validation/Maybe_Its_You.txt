Ive been alone searching for love  
til you came along and touched my heart  
With you in my life Ill never think twice  
Its you Ive been waiting to call  
  
Chorus  
Maybe its you Im thinking of  
Wholl mend this broken heart of mine  
Its you Im wishing for wholl be with me tonight  
Someone to hold someone to cry someone wholl  
Make me feel alive  
Maybe its you all my life  
Ohh  
  
No lonely hours but just precious times  
I turn to you and I am alright  
Oh  
Never will die this feeling inside  
With you every moments forever  
  
Maybe its you  
Im thinking of wholl mend this broken heart of mine  
Its you Im wishing for wholl be with me tonight  
Someone to hold someone to cry someone wholl  
Make me feel alive  
Maybe its you all my live  
  
Instrumental  
  
Maybe its you  
Im thinking of wholl mend this broken heart of mine  
Its you Im wishing for wholl be with me tonight  
Someone to hold someone to cry someone wholl make me feel alive  
Maybe its you all my life  
  
Someone to hold someone to cry someone  
Wholl make me feel alive  
Maybe its you all my life  
  
Ohhhh  
Maybe its you all my life
