I dont know you  
But I want you  
All the more for that  
Words fall through me  
And always fool me  
And I cant react  
  
And games that never amount  
to more than theyre meant  
Theyll play themselves out  
  
Take this sinking boat  
And point it home  
Weve still got time  
Raise your hopeful voice  
You have a choice  
You make it now  
  
Falling slowly  
Eyes that know me  
And I cant go back  
  
Moves that take me  
And erase me  
And Im painted black  
  
And you have suffered enough  
And warred yourself  
Its time that you won  
  
So take this sinking boat  
And point it home  
Weve still got time  
Raise your hopeful voice  
You have a choice  
You make it now  
  
So take this sinking boat  
And point it home  
Weve still got time  
Raise your hopeful voice  
You have a choice  
You make it now  
  
I dont know you  
But I want you  
All the more for that
