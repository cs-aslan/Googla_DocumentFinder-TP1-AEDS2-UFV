Baby I think we both know its gone wrong wrong wrong  
And I know you dont think we can carry it on  
Baby I think we both know its gone bad bad bad  
Think of all the good times we had  
Driving to your house  
Remember when we first met  
Dancin on a Friday night  
Under the moon light  
Talkin till the night was gone  
In the back of my truck with the radio on  
  
Then that ol song comes on  
Together were singin  
Forever were singin  
When that ol song comes on  
Together were singin  
Forever were singin  
That ol country song  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Baby I think we both know  
Its alright alright  
But how could I forget what you did that night  
Baby you told me you loved me in Tennessee  
Where we were gonna live  
But now youve done a few things that I cant forgive  
Driving to her house  
Tellin her you love her  
Lying on a Friday night  
Ring in your pocket  
Lying to me all along  
In the back of your truck with the radio on  
  
Then that ol song comes on  
Together were singin  
Forever were singin  
I know we went wrong  
But we belong  
Together were singin  
Forever were singin  
That ol country song  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Then that ol song comes on  
Together were singin  
Forever were singin  
I know we went wrong  
But we belong  
Together were singin  
Forever were singin  
That ol country song  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
