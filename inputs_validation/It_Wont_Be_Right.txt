Early in the mornin when the sun come up  
Youll find me sittin at the table drinkin from a wooden cup  
The mortgage is a comin tryin to take my home away  
Im not gonna let it turn my head away  
It wont be right  
No matter what they say  
Wont be right  
Tryin to take my home away  
Wont be right  
If they do this thing to me  
I dont have to take it  
And I really dont want to see  
  
Early in the evenin long about supper time  
Theres nothin left here for me but a bottle of wine  
Im gonna be evicted along about the hour of five  
Well its enough to make me wonder why Im alive  
  
It wont be right  
No matter what they say  
Wont be right  
Tryin to take my home away  
Wont be right  
If they do this thing to me  
I dont have to take it  
And I really dont want to see
