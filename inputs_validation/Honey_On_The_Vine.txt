Candy apple lips so red  
Lips that Ive made mine  
One look at you and I knew  
Honey on the vine  
  
Sugar in my coffee cup  
Sweetness in my wine  
Cant compare with love you share  
Honey on the vine  
  
When you walk in my front door  
The lemon tree cries  
It cant compare with love youve got  
Sweet honey on the vine  
  
Take a walk down lovers lane  
Your hand holding mine  
I think Ill die getting my  
Honey on the vine  
  
When you walk in my front door  
The lemon tree cries  
It cant compare with love youve got  
Sweet honey on the vine  
  
Take a walk down lovers lane  
Your hand holding mine  
I think Ill die getting my  
Honey on the vine  
  
I think Ill die getting my  
Honey on the vine  
Think Ill die getting my  
Honey on the vine
