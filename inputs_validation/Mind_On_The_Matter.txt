Mama told me not to try to be nobody  
I listened to her  
Mama told me Id grow up to be somebody  
Looka here  
  
Savin moneys hard when you cant save your soul  
Ill get through it  
Tryin to dig myself out of this mighty hole  
Listen to what I say  
  
Got my mind on the matter  
Sure as I tell ya  
Now you know thats right  
I look down at my hands and  
I see labor burns  
Its a part of livin  
Keepin my feet on the ground while the world turns  
  
Its all on me  
Got my mind on the matter  
Sure as I tell ya  
Now you know thats right
