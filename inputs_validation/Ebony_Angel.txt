Ive told you that were getting married  
Now dont you try changing my mind  
Weve got a good thing together  
Who cares if the world is unkind  
Im a man and youre a woman  
Thats all that matters to me  
Baby the times are achanging  
And I want the whole world to see  
  
Youre my ebony angel  
Who cares what people say  
My sweet ebony angel  
Were going a long long way  
  
I want your love for a lifetime  
I wont let you keep us apart  
Dont give me those black and white reasons  
cause I only see with my heart  
Im a man and youre a woman  
Thats what the worlds all about  
Baby the times are achanging  
Let me erase any doubt  
  
Youre my ebony angel  
Who cares what people say  
My sweet ebony angel  
Were going a long long way  
  
Baby the times are achanging  
Let me erase any doubt  
  
Youre my ebony angel  
Who cares what people say  
My sweet ebony angel  
Were going a long long way
