Where you off to with that head of yours  
Is there somewhere you should be  
Was it something that I said the time I held you down  
And told you its not you its only me baby  
  
Dont take what I dont need  
Give me back my piece of mind  
Dont say what I dont mean  
Give me back my precious time  
No way youll silence me  
Youll see  
  
What you up to now your mirrors gone  
Is there someone you should be  
Did you think I was just fooling round with you  
But honestly  
But honestly  
But honestly  
  
Dont take what I dont need  
Give me back my piece of mind  
Dont say what I dont mean  
Give me back my precious time  
No way youll silence me  
No where to hide from me  
Youll see  
  
And tonight I thank the stars  
As I count my lucky scars  
For everything youve given me  
And all the words I gave to you  
Something borrowed something blue  
If you want them back  
Ill give it to you  
Give it to you  
Give it to you  
Give it to you  
Give it to you  
Give it to you  
Give it to you  
Ill give it to you  
Ill give it to you  
Give it to you  
Give it to you  
Ill give it to you  
Ill give it to you  
Give it to you  
Give it to you  
Ill give it to you  
  
I dont want one thing that I gave to you  
I dont want one thing that I gave to you  
I dont want one thing that I gave to you  
I dont want one thing that I gave to you  
I dont want one thing that I gave to you  
I dont want one thing that I gave to you  
I dont want one thing that I gave to you  
I dont want one thing that I gave to you
