Open my eyes what a beautiful day  
Just the type that makes me want to say hooray  
Im still a little fuzzyheaded from my sleep  
Into my brain reality seeps  
Look all around me cant believe what I see  
These little short people are surrounding me  
Ive got a white beard a suit made of red  
My soul becomes filled with a keen sense of dread  
  
Oh God Im Santa Claus  
Oh God Im Santa Claus  
Oh God Im Santa Claus  
Oh God Im Santa Claus  
  
Hop out of bed kick an elf in the chest  
What an awful way to awake from a rest  
Santa oh Santa the little gnomes cheer  
You shouldnt be nasty at this time of year  
What do you mean I say in a rage  
And what are you doing with those big burlap bags  
The elves they do roar Why their full of toys  
For you to deliver to the good girls and boys   
  
Oh God Im Santa Claus  
Oh God Im Santa Claus  
Oh God Im Santa Claus  
Oh God Im Santa Claus  
  
Resigned to my fate I load up the sleigh  
Harness the reindeer and get under way  
Its nippy up here in the cool arctic sky  
Good thing I remembered that bottle of rye  
Flying over rooftops throwing out toys  
Hopefully crushing those good girls and boys  
Like a bad dream I pray for release  
Please let this hellish existence be ceased  
  
Oh God Im Santa Claus  
Oh God Im Santa Claus  
Oh God Im Santa Claus  
Oh God Im Santa Claus  
  
From this nightmare I finally awake  
My brain is on fire my hands they do shake  
But wait theyre not hands theyre cute little paws  
Im the Easter Bunny Im not Santa Claus  
  
Oh God Im the Easter Bunny  
Oh God I m Easter Bunny  
Oh God Im Easter Bunny  
Oh God Im Easter Bunny
