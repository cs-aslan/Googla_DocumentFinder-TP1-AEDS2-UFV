The crown of the kingdom is given to the woman  
The kingdom of the kitchen where she says she shouldnt  
There on the stainless steel her cigarettes and matches  
Whistles to the radio to every hook she catches  
  
But the frowns  
Eider downs  
Tie her down  
But she likes to wear the crown of the kingdom  
  
She like the recipes a touch of oriental  
Steaming up the windows burning egg on metal  
Sees in a catalogue a shiny new appliance  
Another role swallowed by the wonders of science  
  
Lobster hands  
Omelette pans  
Understand  
How the crown can stick like jam in her kingdom  
  
Hes been so busy and shes been neglected  
The problem is computed and always its rejected  
Out of her heart I catch a spark  
And being smart  
The crown is left out in the dark now theres no kingdom  
  
Fed up with the glory she abdicates her title  
Sitting at a bar stool she gives her days recital  
The family watch in horror  
As she staggers up the hallway  
Makes herself a sandwich  
As theyre looking through the doorway  
She goes to bed  
Leg by leg  
Nothings said  
Theres no crown upon her head theres no kingdom  
  
Press the button on the toaster  
Its a womans world  
Tuck the sheets in on the bed  
Its a womans world  
Take your apron from your holster  
Its a womans world  
Shoot the crown off of your head  
Its a womans world
