I loved you when  
It was alright  
Ill love you when  
It all goes wrong  
I love you when  
My eyes are open  
Ill love you when  
My eyes are gone  
Fire girlsay you will  
  
I have no time  
To watch TV  
Yours is the face  
That interests me  
I loved you when  
You lost your raincoat  
Ill love you when  
You lose your fear  
Fire girlsay you will  
  
Pockets full of rain  
Bewildered by this change  
Underneath the sky  
I just want to fly  
Fire girlsay you will  
  
Im so lonely  
So just do it  
Say you will  
I got a pocket full of rain
