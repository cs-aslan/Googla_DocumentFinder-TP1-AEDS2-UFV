So long to you hope I dont make you blue  
Think Im gonna kill myself think Im gonna myself  
Apart weve grown now I cant go on alone  
Think Im gonna kill myself think Im gonna myself  
  
Now dig my grave with a silver spade a gold chain lay me down and down  
Send my remains to my best friend the rest to my hole in the ground  
Send the rest to my hole in the ground  
  
I bow my head cause in the mornin Im a gonna be dead  
Think Im gonna kill myself think Im gonna myself  
  
Now dig my grave with a silver spade a gold chain lay me down and down  
Send my remains to my best friend the rest to my hole in the ground  
Send the rest to my hole in the ground
