Chorus  
Some legends are told  
Some turn to dust or to gold  
But you will remember me  
Remember me for centuries  
And just one mistake  
Is all it will take  
Well go down in history  
Remember me for centuries  
Heyyyyy yeah oh heyyyyy heyyyyy yeah  
Remember me for centuries  
  
Verse 1  
Mummified my teenage dreams  
No its nothing wrong with me  
The kids are all wrong the storys all off  
Heavy metal broke my heart  
Come on come on and let me in  
The bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints  
And this is supposed to match  
The darkness that you felt  
I never meant for you to fix yourself  
  
PreChorus  
Du du du dudu du du du  
Du du du dudu du du du  
  
Chorus  
Some legends are told  
Some turn to dust or to gold  
But you will remember me  
Remember me for centuries  
And just one mistake  
Is all it will take  
Well go down in history  
Remember me for centuries  
Heyyyyy yeah oh heyyyyy heyyyyy yeah  
Remember me for centuries  
  
Verse 2  
And I cant stop until the whole world knows my name  
Cause I was only born inside my dreams  
Until you die for me as long as theres a light my shadows over you  
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia  
And youre a cherry blossom  
Youre about to bloom  
You look so pretty but youre gone so soon  
  
PreChorus  
Du du du dudu du du du  
Du du du dudu du du du

Well go down in history  
Remember me for centuries  
Heyyyyy yeah oh heyyyyy heyyyyy yeah  
Remember me for centuries  
  
Bridge  
Weve been here forever  
And heres the frozen proof  
I could scream forever  
We are the poisoned youth
