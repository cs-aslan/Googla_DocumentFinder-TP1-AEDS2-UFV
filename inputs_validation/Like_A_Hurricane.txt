Once I thought I saw you in a crowded hazy bar  
Dancing on the light from star to star  
Far across the moonbeam I know thats who you are  
I saw your brown eyes turning once to fire  
  
You are like a hurricane theres calm in your eye  
And Im gettin blown away  
To somewhere safer where the feeling stays  
I want to love you but Im getting blown away  
  
I am just a dreamer but you are just a dream  
And you could have been anyone to me  
Before that moment you touched my lips  
That perfect feeling when time just slips  
Away between us on our foggy trip  
  
You are like a hurricane theres calm in your eye  
And Im gettin blown away  
To somewhere safer where the feeling stays  
I want to love you but Im getting blown away blown away  
  
You are just a dreamer and I am just a dream  
You could have been anyone to me  
Before that moment you touched my lips  
That perfect feeling when time just slips  
Away between us on our foggy trip  
  
You are like a hurricane theres calm in your eye  
And Im gettin blown away  
To somewhere safer where the feeling stays  
I want to love you but Im getting blown away blown away blown away
