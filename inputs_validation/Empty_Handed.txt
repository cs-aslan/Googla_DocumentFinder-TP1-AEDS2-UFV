When did you know that nothing was right  
Were you just happy to hide  
Behind dreams and broken lies  
Theres a crack in your perfect smile  
Thats been growing a while  
Did you think youd go out in style  
  
With all that you know  
How long did you know  
  
You took me for granted  
I dont understand it  
Went looking for answers  
I came up empty handed  
But dont worry about me  
Cause Im stronger then you think  
And I know its a blessing  
I came up empty handed  
  
Can you be whoever you like  
You just turn off the lights  
And find yourself a different disguise  
So you hide the scars you built over time  
Do you think Im blind  
Youre still lovely on the inside  
  
With all that you know  
How long did you know  
  
You took me for granted  
I dont understand it  
When looking for answers  
I came up empty handed  
Dont worry about me  
Cause Im stronger than you think  
And I know its a blessing  
I came up empty handed  
Empty handed  
  
When did you know that nothing was right  
Were you just happy to hide  
Behind dreams and broken lies  
With all that you know  
Why didnt you just go  
  
You took me for granted  
I dont understand it  
When looking for answers  
I came up empty handed  
But dont worry about me  
Cause Im stronger then you think  
And I know its a blessing  
I came up empty handed  
Empty handed  
Empty handed  
Empty handed
