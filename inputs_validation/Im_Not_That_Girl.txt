Hands touch eyes meet  
Sudden silence sudden heat  
Hearts leap in a giddy whirl  
He could be that boy  
  
But Im not that girl  
Dont dream too far  
Dont lose sight of who you are  
Dont remember that rush of joy  
He could be that boy  
Im not that girl  
  
Every so often we long to steal  
To the land of whatmighthavebeen  
But that doesnt soften the ache we feel  
When reality sets back in  
  
Blithe smile lithe limb  
She whos winsome she wins him  
Gold hair with a gentle curl  
Thats the girl he chose  
And heaven knows  
Im not that girl  
  
Dont wish dont start  
Wishing only wounds the heart  
I wasnt born for the rose and pearl  
Theres a girl I know  
He loves her so  
Im not that girl
