ZRo  
Aint nobody really got my back  
Motherfuckers just be hanging around me because I rap  
It aint no love involved no motherfucking love at all  
If I had a price on my head I bet my partnas would give up they dog  
Wish my mama was living cause Id be giving her my time  
Shit Id probably never would of started to rhyme  
My lifetime it aint no sunshine cause it be raining  
I be trying my best to smile but I cant cause I be paining  
Im paranoid all day I keep my steel with me bitch ass jackers  
Try to get me so now my people be scared to come and chill with me  
Fuck yall Im one deep till I DIE  
Displaying off some boxing game when HOEs try me  
An SUC Guerilla Maab veteran constantly head busting  
Leaving em in need of an exceteran Im going  
Do knocking with a glock paying a visit to some of my foes and friends  
ZRo Jones Jr swelling em up around the nose and chin  
  
Hook x2  
Fuck all of yall yall done pissed a nigga off  
Im a touch all of yall round each and every corner  
Someone follow yall they just trying to give you a present  
Something holla dog and thats for all of yall  
  
ZRo  
I done made up my mind  
I hustle all alone Im trying to get a solo shine  
Everytime I turn around someone bringing me down  
Got tired of em pulling on me started slanging them rounds  
Now they thinking Im a crazy  
Scarred and stabbed and shot Im still a baby  
I want my mama cause Im having bad dreams and I die in em all  
Got me aint friendly when you see me aint no smiling at all  
Live the thug life heartless and hopeless  
Laying low ducking the law went North to Lufkin and Nacogdoches  
Im connected my best friend use to be I10  
Till my out of town connect pulled out two techs and took my ends  
Got me throwed off in the mind retaliations what I taste  
His get blowed off with my nine incarcerations what I face  
Feel me I done lost my mind but Im not trying to find out where it went to  
It might be for the best cause Im not trying to remember the shit I been  
Thru  
  
Hook x2  
  
DReck  
Its automatic gun fire till they all expire  
Of course they said they loved me but they all was lies  
Told me just give em a deal now I tote a pill  
But when it was forth and ten only a few was real  
Instead of making you an employee nigga I made you a friend  
Now look what you lose your Qs and handle fections stealing your ends  
Ive been behind the scenes but in front of the schemes  
Organized the team for you to realize your dream  
Thats how you pay me back you funny fake fraud and flipper  
Over pennies and nickels they turned sour like milk  
Its no wonder why so manyll never see fortune and fame  
Fuck what you claim motherfucker you never endue it no pain  
What you bumping for lil daddy my address the same  
Aint no pain without no gain you got the heart to sustain  
Now Im solo for the dolow aint fucking with you no mo  
For one thing you do and Ill have you knocked off for the lowlow  
  
Hook x2
