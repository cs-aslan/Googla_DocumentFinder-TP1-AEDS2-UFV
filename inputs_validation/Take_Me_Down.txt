Seems Ive lingered too long in the darkness  
Unlock the door turn the light on and wait  
I should know better than to rest on a promise  
But this body before you has seen too much pain  
  
Take me down take me down to the water  
Take my hand learn me all I should know  
Here I am Im waiting for you  
Just give me a sign oh please dont fail me now  
  
Its at this time we feel the emotion  
Nothing is wasted nothing is lost  
Im sure that Ive been here before sometime  
Some bridges are reached but never are crossed  
  
Take me down take me down to the water  
Take my hand learn me all I should know  
Here I am Im waiting for you  
Just give me a sign oh please dont fail me now  
  
Take me down take me down to the water  
Take my hand learn me all I should know  
Here I am Im waiting for you  
Just give me a sign oh please dont fail me now  
  
Dont fail me now  
Cause its out of my control  
Im coming with you  
Im right beside you  
Oh feet dont fail me now  
  
Seems Ive lingered too long in the darkness  
Unlock the door turn the light on and wait  
I should know better than to rest on a promise  
But this body before you has seen too much pain  
  
Take me down take me down to the water  
Take my hand learn me all I should know  
Here I am Im waiting for you  
Just give me a sign dont let me go  
Take me down take me down to the water  
Take my hand learn me all I should know  
Here I am Im waiting for you  
Just give me a sign oh feet please dont fail me now
