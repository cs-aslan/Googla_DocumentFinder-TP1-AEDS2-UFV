Last night I went to kill  
Some time at the famous grill  
Where the tall eats the small  
There were girls all over me  
Thats my insanity  
Dont call me Ringo call me Paul  
  
Im in heaven Im in hell  
Dont wipe that smile off my face  
Cant you tell  
I see faces in the weirdest places  
Please wont you take me down  
Underneath you spell  
  
Oh oh Im back at midnight alright  
I drop my keys could you get em love  
Oh oh baby I might he might  
I got the stuff to keep it goin on all night  
  
Take me down nightmare avenue  
Goin down nightmare avenue  
I want to take you too  
  
Sharp as a sabres tooth  
Back in my favorite booth  
Im getting spanked with cold champagne  
Id walk on a razor blade  
If youre dressed like a French maid  
I get my pleasure out of pain  
  
Im in heaven Im in hell  
Dont wipe that smile off my face  
Cant you tell  
I see faces in the weirdest places  
Please wont you take me down  
Underneath you spell  
  
Oh oh Im back at midnight alright  
I drop my keys could you get em love  
Oh oh baby I might he might  
I got the stuff to keep it goin on all night  
  
Take me down nightmare avenue  
Goin down nightmare avenue  
Drive me down nightmare avenue  
Lay me down on nightmare avenue  
Take me down nightmare avenue  
Goin down nightmare avenue  
Drive me down nightmare avenue  
Lay me down on nightmare avenue  
  
And Ive gonna take you too
