Song Across The Nation Lyrics  
Now get the guns the drugs From my generation  
Ill take the fall the saints across the nation  
And its the sex the gods the freaks the frauds  
Theyre messin with me Come on come on come on

Ill take the fall the saints across the nation  
And its the sex the gods the freaks the frauds

Forget the lies the money were in this together  
And through it all they said nothings forever  
And they refuse to see the change in me  
Why wont they wake up Come on come on come on
