Dont it sometimes feel  
As if the world is turned upside down  
Were all standing on our heads  
Tryin to make the most of this  
Kinda makes it feel like your heavy  
  
Dont it sometimes feel like you got too much to bear  
Well let it at the door my friend  
Come inside and lets have a good good  
Good good time tonight  
Try forget it all  
Cause it will still be there tomorrow  
You can be sure it will still be there for us all  
  
Lets have a good good time tonight  
Thats what I preach yeah  
You can leave the problems out  
We come back to teach about  
The fun I like good good time  
Nobody be there by my side  
Close your eyes shake it up shake it up  
Baby ya look good tonight  
Its a good good time tonight yeah  
  
Stumble self down fall down  
Scrape your knee rub it good  
You wake up with your head feels like  
Someones beatin on you  
End of story  
But overboard overboard  
Just for this evening  
Leave it behind leave it behind  
Lets dance the night away  
  
Lets have a good good time tonight  
Hope ya can if ya will  
Try to leave your tears after all  
Bring em in to show everyone  
We can get to the bottom of this bottle  
We could end of this burning toll  
Roll up now roll it up another one  
And another fall through before  
Lets have a good good time tonight  
  
Its a good good time tonight  
Its a good good time tonight  
Its a good good time tonight  
Its a good good time tonight
