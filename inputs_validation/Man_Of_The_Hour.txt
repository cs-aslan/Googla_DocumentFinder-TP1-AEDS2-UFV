Its him or me  
Thats what he said  
But I cant choose  
Between a vegan and a pot head  
So I chose you because youre sweet  
And you give me lots of lovin and you eat meat  
And thats how you became  
My only man of the hour  
  
You never lie  
And you dont cheat  
And you dont have any baggage tied to your forefeet  
Do I deserve to be the one who will feed you breakfast lunch  
And dinner and take you to the park at dawn  
Will you really be  
My only man of the hour  
  
I know youll never bring me flowers  
Flowers they will only die  
And though youll never take a shower together  
I know youll never make me cry  
You never argue  
You dont even talk  
And I like the way you let me lead you  
When we go outside and walk  
Will you really be  
My only man of the hour  
My only man of the hour  
My only man of the hour
