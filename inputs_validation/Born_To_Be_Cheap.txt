Cheap cheap  
I was born to be cheap cheap  
A child no mother could keep cheap  
As sure as theres trash  
I was born to be cheap  
  
I was born to be helpless I was born to be cold  
I was born to never do what Im told  
I was to be shallow wasnt born to be deep  
Of all the things I was to be cheap  
  
Cheap cheap  
I was born to be cheap cheap  
A child no mother could keep cheap  
As sure as theres trash  
I was born to be cheap  
  
I was born to be crass a loud brassy tart  
No one can accuse me of having a heart  
I was born to fast  
I dont do it twice with anyone get cheap  
  
Cheap cheap  
I was born to be cheap cheap  
As Im walking down the street cheap  
Im always too much  
I was born to be cheap  
  
I was born to be helpless I was born to be cold  
I was born to never do what Im told  
I was to be shallow wasnt born to be deep  
Of all the things I was to be cheap  
  
Im cheap  
I was born to be cheap cheap  
A child no mother could keep cheap  
As Im walking down the street cheap  
Ive always wanted to be cheap  
I was born to be cheap
