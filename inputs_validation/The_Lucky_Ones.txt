Sometimes youre sentimental  
I know exactly what to do  
And if Im temperamental  
You calm me down and you pull me through  
  
Chorus  
We are the lucky ones  
We have one another  
When the end of the day has come  
I return to you  
  
Life can be so demanding  
Sometimes its hard to make it through  
Its love and understanding  
You give to me I give to you  
  
Chorus  
  
Our own fairy tale  
Our favorite bedtime story  
One that we wont forget  
We fell in love  
We knew from the start  
Wed always be together  
The first time that we met  
Cant forget  
  
Chorus  
  
All alone in the setting sun  
Ill have you and youll have me
