I see your smiling face by the open door  
Theres the morning light  
Shining in your hair and in your eyes  
  
And just a little way behind that smile of yours  
I see another one oh so far away  
If only for one second I could hold you close to me  
When the Master calls for me again  
Theres nothing I can say or I can do  
  
Goodbye my love  
Time has come to say farewell  
I hear the call again  
Goodbye to the world  
Ive shouted for so long  
Oh theres so much my love that I can never say  
  
And in a little while in a little while  
Theres nothing left to see  
  
As the years go by and I have not returned  
And the night has come falling all around  
Ooh if you count the stars youll know  
How many have gone out  
And when the Master calls for me again  
Theres nothing that I can say  
Or I can do  
  
Stand in the sun  
Shut your eyes and feel the world  
Its changing every day  
Goodbye my love  
Each day will seem so long  
Ooh theres so much I feel that I can never say  
  
I cant see you  
I cant feel you anymore  
Ive just a memory of that open door
