Waiting for that other shoe to drop  
And you swear this worlds gonna come to a stop  
Drowning on dry land a cant come up for air  
Your knees are so weak and you look at that mountain  
Say theres no way over and no way around it  
And it feels like youre so far from home  
Even Gods not there  
But  
  
Oh but every single sparrow flying  
And every broken soul thats crying  
He can see yeah youre in His reach  
If He can hold an ocean back with one little shore  
Then whats all this worry and doubting for  
Oh I believe He holds everything  
  
When its late at night and youre staring at the stack of bills  
It dont add up and you dont know how it will  
Clinging to your mothers faith with a halfhearted prayer  
But you still dont know  
When the anchor man breaks in on your TV  
And says these times they wont be easy  
And fear sets in and you wanna give in  
Just let it go  
Oh let it go  
  
Every single sparrow flying  
And every broken soul thats crying  
He can see yeah youre in His reach  
If he can hold an ocean back with one little shore  
Then whats all this worry and doubting for  
Oh I believe yeah I believe He holds everything he holds everything
