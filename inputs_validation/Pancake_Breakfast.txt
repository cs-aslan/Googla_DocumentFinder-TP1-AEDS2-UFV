Smokin any thing that I can fit in a pipe  
Slammin bottles of tussin and going fishing for pike  
Never uptight my high wont permit it  
My problems life but I dont sweat it just live it  
  
And Im not your average rapper  
Got the same birthdate as Thomas Crapper  
So bitch better watch your back  
cause I push more power than a Marshall stack  
  
Never the wack but oh so pesky  
Some say I cant flow but mother fucker dont test me  
And if you arrest me you dumb cop  
Ill find your daughter and Ill give her this cock  
  
Kid Rocks my mother fuckin name  
Bitch you know me so pass the OE  
And dont talk about takin me out  
cause I got your girl and Im makin her shout  
  
Just like a piano Im really grand  
And I got more riffs than Steely Dan  
Some friends call me fly  
But most just call me when they want to get high  
  
It aint the disco Cisco Kid mother fucker  
Its the outlasting shotgunblasting  
Dickswingin pussy lickin punk  
little skinny mother fucker and Im not no hunk  
  
But I got more rhymes than a cornfield stalks  
And I turn more tricks than Tony Hawk  
Walk with a limp cause I pimp like a pro  
And if ya dis me punk Ill fuck your ho  
  
And though you think Im nothing more than a young punk  
Im like a hound dog chasin a chipmunk  
I move quick like a cheetah  
And it aint shit to me to just beat a  
  
MC down who looks like a dick  
Jumpin round like a homo on a pogo stick  
Yo rock Whats up stop being a jerk  
And just Give em an example of how a DJ works  
  
cause its blackjack and I got two aces  
Been many places seen many faces  
And everywhere I go people want to jive  
So I keep my fingers on my 45  
  
So dont cross my dusty path  
Or Ill put my foot up in crusty ass  
Dont front ho pass the jay  
Then hear me MC and watch me DJ  
  
To the beat yall and I wont stop  
And Ima rock this shit till your eardrums pop  
Everybodys tryin to get a piece of the pie  
But I dont let bullshit spoil my high
