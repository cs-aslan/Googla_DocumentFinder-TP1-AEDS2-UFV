And the muggers that day  
  
Several million lovers  
Of that dress thats in the window display  
And every day theyd say  
  
Oliver  
Oliver  
Oliver  
Oliver dont stay  
  
She was quite a woman  
Quite an understanding woman she was  
  
Sure I really loved her  
But she acted like a mother to me  
And she loved me and Id scream  
  
Nancy  
Nancy  
Nancy  
Please take care of me  
  
Oliver Oliver  
Oliver Oliver  
Oliver  
  
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhh  
  
I was overblown by all the card sharks  
And the muggers that day  
  
Several million lovers  
Of that dress thats in the window display  
And every day theyd say  
  
Oliver  
Oliver  
Oliver  
Oliver dont stay
