Verse 1  
If you dance Ill dance  
And if you dont Ill dance anyway  
Give peace a chance  
Let the fear you have fall away  
  
PreChorus 1  
Ive got my eye on you  
Ive got my eye on you  
  
Chorus  
Say yes to heaven  
Say yes to me  
Say yes to heaven  
Say yes to me  
  
Verse 2  
If you go Ill stay  
You come back Ill be right here  
Like a barge at sea  
In the storm I stay clear  
  
PreChorus 2  
Cause Ive got my mind on you  
Ive got my mind on you  
  
Chorus  
Say yes to heaven  
Say yes to me  
Say yes to heaven  
Say yes to me  
  
Verse 3  
If you dance Ill dance  
Ill put my red dress on again  
And if you fight Ill fight  
It doesnt matter now its all gone  
  
PreChorus 2  
Ive got my mind on you  
Ive got my mind on you  
  
Chorus  
Say yes to heaven  
Say yes to me  
Say yes to heaven  
Say yes to me  
  
Outro  
Ive got my eye on you  
Ive got my eye on you  
Ive got my eye on you  
Ive got my eye on you
