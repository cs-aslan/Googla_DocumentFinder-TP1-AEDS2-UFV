Im rolling out of the ferris wheel  
No one looks and no one feels  
But the baby can the baby can  
The way it feels just feeling you  
Holding out and falling out  
But the baby can the baby can  
Im the jumping man  
Im the jumping man  
But baby can float  
Baby can drown  
Baby can touch her toes  
Toss her hair  
Makes you feel  
Youre going nowhere  
Baby can dance  
Baby can dance  
Baby can walk around the town  
Attract a man and cut him down  
Im the shadow man the jumping jack  
The man who can and dont look back  
But the baby can the baby can  
Im rolling out of the ferris wheel  
No one looks and no one feels  
But the baby can the baby can  
And the way it feels  
Im feeling you  
The baby can float  
Baby can drown  
Baby can touch her toes  
Toss her hair  
Makes you feel  
Youre going nowhere  
Baby can dance  
Baby can dance  
Baby can walk around the town  
Attract a man and cut him down  
Every day is far away  
Every day every day  
Its over now  
Its over now  
Its over now  
Its over now  
Its over now  
Its over now  
But baby can float  
Baby can drown  
Baby can touch her toes  
Toss her hair  
Makes you feel  
Youre going nowhere  
Baby can dance  
Baby can dance  
Baby can walk around the town  
Attract a man and cut him down  
Baby can float  
Baby can drown  
Baby can touch her toes  
Toss her hair  
Makes you feel  
Youre going nowhere  
Baby can dance  
Baby can dance  
Baby can walk around the town  
Attract a man and cut him down
