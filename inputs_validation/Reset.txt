Aint it funny how youre born and then your life begins  
Just like a baby all alone thats if you wasnt a twin  
You must begin to fend for self when the umbilicals cut  
The doctor put you under the heating lamp your spirit is touched  
You know what I take that back why You was alive  
Date of conception interception cause the sperm did collide  
From T n A to DNA feelings turn to children  
The morning after pill didnt put a halt to our very existence  
We living breathing soon well be teething  
Our granny got a gold and now we want one for that reason  
An adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages  
But parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages  
Cell therapists beware of this lugie that I spit  
Incarceration without rehabilitation really dont mean shit  
Little Rickys home he gotta serve probation for six months  
But Uncle Donnel and Ol Dirty Bastard still in the joint  
Reset

Good does not come without pain  
Meaning before it gets better its going get worse  
Like my homies on the sick side still dying over turf  
That dont belong to us  
I mean us left in the dust  
Try to catch up with massah  
I used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus of them crackers  
But Ephesians 612 said it wasnt flesh and blood that we wrestle against  
Principalities powers of this world  
Rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness  
In high places so throw that whole armor of righteousness  
I spark this thing but my name aint Bubba  
I got a problem with racist cab drivers like Glover  
And brothers that wax fat and forget all about the struggle  
Yeah come on come on  
Guess what guess what  
Time to reset this thing

CeeLo  
Listen to me  
I awaken to sunlight thats beyond bright  
This day will be done right  
There is a war just waiting on the other side of the door  
But Ill be bringing God to the gunfight  
Cant live forever so have some fun right  
Lifes a bowl of candy you can have one right  
You can handle if tomorrow never comes right  
Youll get used to singing if only for one night  
But I intend to raise two daughters and a son right  
And I couldnt have wrote this if I was hopeless  
And see I focus to provoke this  
So open wide for my opinionated opus  
Stop playing Go Fish but not below this  
Before I go I thought that you all should know this  
Recognize and realize before any regretting  
Before you relapse perhaps youll consider resetting
