Its no use knocking on my door  
I wont be answering any more  
So dont come round here like you did before  
Im moving out no doubt about it  
  
Take the video  
Take the stereo  
Take the dog and the cat and the Bonio  
Take the TV and the rug and the radio  
I packed my bags  
Come on lets go  
  
Take the bicycle thats in the hall  
Take the pictures and the ducks off the wall  
This is it dont let the teardrops fall  
Im moving out today  
  
Take the video  
Take the stereo  
Take the dog and the cat and the Bonio  
Take the TV and the rug and the radio  
I packed my bags  
Come on lets go
