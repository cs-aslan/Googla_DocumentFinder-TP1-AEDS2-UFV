Times venom boils  
Every breath ticking towards torment  
This carrier exposes our instability  
I will battle on  
I must choose a throne to succeed  
This domain in which I leave  
Ill battle on to carryout til the cycle end its game  
I see the blood spilling out from the core  
Did my grave of opportunity  
Time stalks us all  
A scar filled test of who we are  
Dig my grave of opportunity  
Downward I have gone  
Still I bleed I wont die off  
Downward I have gone  
The end is yet to come  
I will battle on  
Times venom boils  
Every breath ticking towards torment  
This carrier exposes our instability  
I see the blood spilling out from the core  
Did my grave of opportunity  
Time stalks us all  
A scar filled test of who we are  
Dig my grave of opportunity  
The end is yet to come
