Its time to let the lost boys take you in  
Its getting cold out  
You wear yourself down  
So please dont go out  
Youre looking dead behind these eyes  
Well stay at your house  
Watch all those late shows on TV  
I like it best when youre in here with me  
And all the lost boys  
Wed make a picture perfect team  
Bruising sidewalks  
With all the drumming of our feet  
And boy I promise  
Well never ever let you leave  
Never let you leave
