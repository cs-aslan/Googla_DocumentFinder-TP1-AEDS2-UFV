They always said that hindsights twentytwenty  
And when it comes to mistakes in love girl Ive got plenty  
But the one that sticks out the most in my mind  
Is the night I left you standing on the front porch drying  
Living for the day I could make it all up to you  
  
Till youre back in my arms back in my arms again  
Till youre back in my arms Ill be old lonesome till then  
And honey I wont eat and I wont even sleep  
Ill be walking these toes off of both of my feet  
Till youre back in my arms back in my arms again  
  
Well Im getting to know this old town like never before  
Walking every street knocking on every door  
Girl wherever you are I want you back  
I love you baby and Im sure about that  
What ever it takes theres nothing that I wont do  
  
Till youre back in my arms back in my arms again  
Till youre back in my arms Ill be old lonesome till then  
And honey I wont eat and I wont even sleep  
Ill be walking these toes off of both of my feet  
Till youre back in my arms back in my arms again  
  
I must have been a fool I confess  
To ever let you go but I aint gonna rest  
  
Till youre back in my arms back in my arms again  
Till youre back in my arms Ill be old lonesome till then  
And honey I wont eat and I wont even sleep  
Ill be walking these toes off of both of my feet  
Till youre back in my arms back in my arms again
