I dont want much  
I just want a little bit  
No I dont want it all  
I just want a little bit  
Just an eenyweeny bit  
Just a teenyweeny bit of your love  
  
Turn your lamp down low  
Now honey wont you slip me a kiss  
Turn your lamp down low  
Babe you know I cant resist  
From an eenyweeny bit  
Just a teenyweeny bit of your love  
  
I want you forever  
Not just for peace of mind  
Please say youll never leave me  
Not until the end of time  
From an eenyweeny bit  
Just a teenyweeny bit of your love  
  
Turn your lamp down low  
Now honey wont you slip me a kiss  
Turn your lamp down low  
Babe you know I cant resist  
From an eenyweeny bit  
Just a teenyweeny bit of your love  
  
Repeat x3  
From just a teenyweeny bit  
Just an eenyweeny bit of your love
