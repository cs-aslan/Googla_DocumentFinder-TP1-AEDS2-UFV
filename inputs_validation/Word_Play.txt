Chorus  
You niggas want word play  
But Im bout bird play  
1st of them month yea we call that bird day  
Just look at em fly hey Repeat x2  
You niggas want word play  
But Im bout bird play  
3rd of the month yea we call that bird day  
Just look at em fly hey Repeat x2  
  
Im way too intelligent  
To play wit my intelligence  
What you trying to say  
What Im sayings not relevant  
I still represent  
Cause Im a representa  
3 Benz and just for a 9 PC chicken dinner  
Young boss right back like a rubber band  
Bought a whip look yall no hands  
Stop this nonsense wheres your roof  
All dis nonsense theres no use  
Married to the game yea we just got eloped  
Depending on the shipment we might need a boat  
Im talking big money anybody any on the case  
Yea we switched up the status now we on to the states  
  
Chorus  
  
It just a waste wit all hip hop  
Young killed hip hop  
dont you know this dumb nigga still talkin crack rocks  
Got everybody followin that makes him a leader  
And he got to get indicted just to make u a believer  
If thats that case then I really do apologize  
That I memorize  
And I fantasize  
Then I visualize  
And I strategize  
One false move will get your ass penalized  
Nigga you cant be serious  
What if Pac was hearing this  
You bullshitting me  
Im sure biggie would agree  
If he had to pass the torch then that bitchll go to me  
Now wouldnt you agree does it matter I accept  
  
Chorus  
  
Have you ever see a blue rolls go on the black grass  
Nigga go broke in investing a black mask  
Entrepreneur he found him a new crack  
A round of applause congratulate that nigga  
Cause when he get rich they goin hate that nigga  
They goin try they best to try n break that nigga  
  
Chorus
