Alice  
Dont know why Im down here  
Must be something I said  
Or some small imperfection  
In my soul or in my head  
Dont know why Im down here  
Dont deserve to roast or bake  
Im fighting off slanderous allegations  
Why dont you give the kid a break  
  
Alice  
Dont think maybe we could talk this over  
Youre a reasonable man  
Could we discuss my grave situation  
Im a miserable man  
And Im in the frying pan  
Give the kid a break continues over dialog  
  
Devil Give me one good reason why I should  
Alice All right all right so I made a few mistakes but listen But for
heavens sake  
Devil Watch your language Kid  
Alice OK OK dont get hot  
  
Devil  
Dont question my judgement  
He only reaped what he sowed  
He cast his pearls before swine  
And thats good enough for me  
  
Devil  
I dont want to talk it over  
Even tho Im a reasonable man  
Sonny from over here looks like youre in no position to bargain  
Youre a convicted man  
Youre right in the frying pan

Alice  
Dont know why Im down here  
Must be something I said Im sorry  
Or some small imperfection  
In my soul or in my head  
It might be some sort of imperfection  
It might be a defection or a a clear case of misdirection yeah  
It must be a small imperfection  
In my soul or in my head  
Give the kid a break
