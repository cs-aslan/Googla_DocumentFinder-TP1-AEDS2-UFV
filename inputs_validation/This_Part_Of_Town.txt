I was walkin the other day with my head down  
When I met a man who had his hand out  
So I gave him gave him a dollar  
But as I walked away I heard him call out  
  
Tell me Brother can you see the sun  
From where youre standin now  
Ive been up and Ive been down  
But Ive never been to this part of town  
  
So I started thinkin bout this world we live in  
And about how far Ive got my hand in  
Sometimes it seems that all we have we have taken  
But maybe next time wont be the forsaken  
  
Tell me Brother can you see the sun  
From where youre standin now  
Ive been up and Ive been down  
But Ive never been to this part of town  
  
So I went to see my girl told her about my day  
She said Life can be that way  
But dont give up dont give up no  
Cause where there is love there is hope  
  
Tell me Brother can you see the sun  
From where youre standin now  
Ive been up and Ive been down  
But Ive never been here before  
  
Tell me Brother can you see the sun  
From where youre standin now  
Ive been up and Ive been down  
But Ive never been to this part of town
