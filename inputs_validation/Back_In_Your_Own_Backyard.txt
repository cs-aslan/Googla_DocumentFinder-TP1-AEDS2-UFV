The bird with feathers of blue is waiting for you  
Back in your own backyard  
Youll see your castle in Spain through your windowpane  
Back in your own backyard  
  
Oh you can go to the east go to the west  
But someday youll come weary at heart  
Back where you started from  
Youll find your happiness lies right under your eyes  
Back in your own backyard
