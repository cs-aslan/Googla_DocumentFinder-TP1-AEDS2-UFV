Put on your war paint  
  
You are a brick tied to me thats dragging me down  
Strike a match and Ill burn you to the ground  
We are the jackolanterns in July setting fire to the sky  
Here here comes this rising tide so come on  
  
Put on your war paint  
  
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hopetodies  
Silver clouds with grey linings  
  
So we can take the world back from a heart attack  
One maniac at a time we will take it back  
You know time crawls on when youre waiting for the song to start  
So dance alone to the beat of your heart  
  
Hey young blood doesnt it feel like our time is running out  
Im gonna change you like a remix  
Then Ill raise you like a phoenix  
Wearing our vintage misery  
No I think it looked a little better on me  
Im gonna change you like a remix  
Then Ill raise you like a phoenix  
  
Bring home the boys and scrap scrap metal the tanks  
Get hitched make a career out of robbing banks  
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks  
You broke our spirit says the note we pass  
  
So we can take the world back from a heart attack  
One maniac at a time we will take it back  
You know time crawls on when youre waiting for the song to start  
So dance alone to the beat of your heart  
  
Hey young blood doesnt it feel like our time is running out  
Im gonna change you like a remix  
Then Ill raise you like a phoenix  
Wearing our vintage misery  
No I think it looked a little better on me  
Im gonna change you like a remix  
Then Ill raise you like a phoenix  
  
Put on your war paint  
  
The war is won before its begun  
Release the doves surrender love  
  
The war is won before its begun  
Release the doves surrender love  
  
The war is won before its begun  
Release the doves surrender love  
  
The war is won before its begun Wave the white flag  
Release the doves surrender love Wave the white flag  
  
Hey young blood doesnt it feel like our time is running out  
Im gonna change you like a remix  
Then Ill raise you like a phoenix  
Wearing our vintage misery  
No I think it looked a little better on me  
Im gonna change you like a remix  
Then Ill raise you like a phoenix  
  
Hey young blood doesnt it feel like our time is running out  
Im gonna change you like a remix  
Then Ill raise you like a phoenix  
  
Put on your war paint
