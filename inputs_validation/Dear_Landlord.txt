Dear landlord  
Please dont put a price on my soul  
My burden is heavy dear  
And my dreams are beyond my control  
Oh yes they are  
  
But when that steamboat whistle blows  
Oh honey Im gonna give you everything I ever had to give yeah  
And I do hope that you can receive it well  
I know that it must be dependin on the way you feel that you live  
  
Whoa landlord  
Please heed these words that I try to speak  
I know you must have suffered much  
But honey you aint alone you aint so unique  
No no no no no  
  
All of us at times I said we might have worked too hard  
Or too heavy too fast and way too rushed yeah  
But everyone can fill their life with anything  
You can look around but baby you just cannot touch  
  
Whoa my dear landlord  
Please dont you dismiss my case  
Im not about to argue with you  
And honey Ill tell ya Im aint gonna move to no other place  
cause I just aint gonna do it no no no  
  
Each of us must have their own special gift  
Oh honey dont you know that its got to be true  
And if you dont underestimate me Ill tell you one thing  
I said that I wont underestimate you no
