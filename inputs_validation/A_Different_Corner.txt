Id say love was a magical thing  
Id say love would keep us from pain  
Had I been there had I been there  
  
I would promise you all of my life  
But to lose you would cut like a knife  
So I dont dare no I dont dare  
  
Cause Ive never come close in all of these years  
You are the only one to stop my tears  
And Im so scared Im so scared  
  
Take me back in time maybe I can forget  
Turn a different corner and we never would have met  
Would you care  
  
I dont understand it for you its a breeze  
Little by little youve brought me to my knees  
Dont you care  
  
No Ive never come close in all of these years  
You are the only one to stop my tears  
Im so scared of this love  
  
And if all that there is is this fear of being used  
I should go back to being lonely and confused  
If I could I would I swear
