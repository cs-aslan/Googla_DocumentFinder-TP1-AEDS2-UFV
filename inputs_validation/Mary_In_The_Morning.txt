Nothings quite as pretty as Mary in the morning  
When through a sleepy haze I see her lyin there  
Soft as the rain that falls on summer flowers  
Warm as the sunlight shinin on her golden hair  
Mmmhmmm  
  
When I awake and see her there so close besiide me  
I want to take her in my arms the ache is there  
So deep insiide me  
  
And nothings quite as pretty as Mary in the morning  
Chasin a rainbow in her dream so far away  
And when she turns to touch it I kiss her face so softly  
And my Mary wakes to love another day  
Mmmhmmm  
  
My Marys there in sunny days or stormy weaeather  
She doesnt care cause right or wrong the love we share  
We share togeether  
  
And nothings quite as pretty as Mary in the evening  
Kissed by the shades of night and starlight on her hair  
And as we walk I hold her close beside me  
All our tomorrows for a lifetime we will share  
Mmmhmmm  
  
Nothings quite as pretty as Mary in the morning  
Nothings quite as pretty as Mary in the morning fade
