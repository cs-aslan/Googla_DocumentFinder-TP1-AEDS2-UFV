Everybody can be famous for a day  
From shore to shore a big department store  
Is all thats left of the American way

In the street outside  
In their uniform of pride  
And theyve all come  
To see a star from the east  
Is he man or beast Decide  
Feel like Im crucified still Im not satisfied  
The second coming is coming anyway  
I see them pray for more on every dance floor  
I hear the word go out across the milky way
