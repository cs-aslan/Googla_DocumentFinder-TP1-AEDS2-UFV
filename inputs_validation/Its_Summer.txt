Outside my window a robin builds a nest  
At last winters gone away to rest  
Once again the leaves has return to the trees  
I can just feel that soft summer breeze  
  
Theres magic in the air  
Winter disappear its summer  
  
Children will be playing in the park  
Days will be longer till the dark  
Nights will be warm with star filled skies  
A perfect setting for a girl and a guy  
  
Theres magic in the air  
Green grass everyeverywhere  
Its summer  
  
Dont you know its summer time Time time time  
And the livin is easy Oh so easy  
Everybody sing summer time Time time time  
Now that summers here there be million things to do  
Vacation near or far whatever pleases you  
Summer is the happiest season of them all  
So everybody get together and have yourselves a ball  
  
Theres magic in the air  
Green grass everyeverywhere  
Its summer  
Oh  
  
Theres magic in the air  
Green grass everyeverywhere  
Its summer  
Woo  
  
Its summer time Magic in the air green grass everywhere  
Oh its summer  
Take a look around you  
Its summer time Magic in the air green grass everywhere  
Oh its summer  
Hmm
