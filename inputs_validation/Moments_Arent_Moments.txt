Tender warm and serene  
Are the words that might come close to having  
Remnants of the feelings that we can no longer hide  
Mighty shining and clear  
Are but mere expressions that dont come near  
To the ever glowing eminence of light in our eyes tonight  
  
Cause moments arent moments  
Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours  
And magics not magic  
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts  
Feeling with tender lovebloom  
  
Gentle quiet so soft  
Are the wings of love that can send us off  
To an ever splendor unknown to all in our time  
Trusting in the unknown and giving in to what feelings have shown  
Will take us to altered intimacies in our lives  
Where well find  
  
That moments arent moments  
Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours  
And magics not magic  
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts  
Feeling with tender lovebloom  
  
Repeat x2  
Cause moments arent moments  
Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours  
And magics not magic  
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts  
Feeling with tender lovebloom
