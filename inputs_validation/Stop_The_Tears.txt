I stopped seeing all of our old friends  
I dont go to places that youve been  
I stopped talking about you  
Started living without you  
But theres just one thing I dont understand  
  
How do I stop the tears  
How am I supposed to deal with this  
How do I stop the tears  
Do I get over you in a week or two  
When I been lovin you for years  
  
Everybody thinks that Im so strong  
They dont know what I go through when Im alone  
I start thinkin about you  
Goin crazy without you  
But I stop myself and I hang up the phone  
  
How do I stop the tears  
How am I supposed to deal with this  
How do I stop the tears  
Do I get over you in a week or two  
When I been lovin you for years  
  
One day youll call me up goin crazy  
Too late youll want me back  
Youll be sayin youll be saying  
  
How do I stop the tears  
How am I supposed to deal with this  
How do I stop the tears  
Do I get over you in a week or two  
When I been lovin you for years
