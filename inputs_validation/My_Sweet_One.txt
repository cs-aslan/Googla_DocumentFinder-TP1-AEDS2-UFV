My sweet one Ill call you my sweet one  
Youre my only true sweet one  
With my all Ill call you my sweet one  
From far away Ill say your name  
  
Oh with you Id travel thick  
And with you Id also travel thin  
And all the spaces in between  
Id travel with you  
Youre my sweet one  
  
But for now I must sit jail here and ponder the yonder  
Herbivores ate well cause their food didnt never run  
  
Oh if Youre ever unsatisfied with the way lifes treating You  
You know You can count on me to take good care of You  
I love you honey oh yes I do You know thats true of course  
and if your dog or cat ever dies Ill buy You a Ewe
