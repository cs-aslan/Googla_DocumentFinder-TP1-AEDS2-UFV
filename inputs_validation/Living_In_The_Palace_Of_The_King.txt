I was born down in Dallas raised up in the city of the wind  
Yeah I could spend a month of Sundays talkin about the places Ive been  
Yeah I played the blues in England I visit with the queen  
She really dug my style but queen is not my thing  
Im goin back to Dallas back to the palace of the king  
Hey they wanted me in Russia but Moscow was much too cold  
Yeah I could have played down in Denmark but the girls was much too old  
Yeah let me tell you something funny I dont know what they say  
I cant find a Chitlins Pizza for any price I pay  
Im goin back to Dallas back to the palace of the king  
Oh living in the palace of the king  
Yeah Im living in the palace gives me service quite the same yeah  
I can make you smile with every note I play  
I can make you happy playin the blues my way  
Im goin back to Dallas back to the palace of the king  
Oh living in the palace of the king  
Yeah Im living in the palace never had service quite the same yeah  
I been around the world I have many things  
Nothing makes me satisfied but this blues I sing  
Im goin back to Dallas back to the palace of the king  
Yeah Im living in the palace of the king  
Living in the palace of the king
