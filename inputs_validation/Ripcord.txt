Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys  
Its inevitable inevitable its a soul destroyed  
You feel it till youre dry  
You feel it till youve had enough  
And you dont understand  
No Ripcord no ripcord  
No Ripcord no ripcord  
  
Aeroplane do I mean what I mean  
Its inevitable inevitable oh aeroplane  
  
A thousand miles an hour  
On politics and power  
That you dont understand  
  
No Ripcord no ripcord  
No Ripcord no ripcord  
  
La la la la  
  
The answer to your prayers  
Well drop you anywhere  
  
No Ripcord no ripcord  
No Ripcord no ripcord
