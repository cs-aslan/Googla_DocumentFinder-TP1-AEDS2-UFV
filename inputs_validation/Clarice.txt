Clarice lay down your mind its there just hard to find  
Follow me as we wind our way away  
  
Behind an open door there lies a million more  
Follow me as we wind our way away  
  
Time is coming soon Ill find you Time is coming soon Ill find you  
Time is coming soon Ill find you Time is coming soon Ill find you  
Time is coming soon time is coming soon  
  
Behind an open door there lies a million more  
Follow me as we wind our way away  
  
Time is coming soon Ill find you Time is coming soon Ill find you  
Time is coming soon Ill find you Time is coming soon Ill find you  
Time is coming soon time is coming soon
