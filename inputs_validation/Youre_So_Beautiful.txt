Youre So Beautiful  
  
  
Girl theres a secret in your eyes  
A look this man can not ignore  
Girl I dont know whats on your mind  
So you must know I want you more  
Like a trip to paradise  
Youre so beautiful  
But I think youre really mine  
I gotta tell the world  
You are so beautiful  
You make my heart a fool  
When I take you in my arms  
Your kisses sweet delight  
  
They feel so wonderful  
Youre making this a magic night  
Now with your body burning mine  
I dont mean to drink the wine  
Im not so high   
Theres something so unreal  
Now I can tell you how I feel  
A fantasy you made come true
