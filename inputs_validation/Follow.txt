VERSE  
Where can I hide  
Where Your Love cannot reach me  
Where can I go  
Where Your arms theyre not here for me  
Where can I run to  
Where I cannot feel Your Love  
  
PRECHORUS  
Jesus Your Love rescued me  
So Ill follow after You  
  
CHORUS  
Wherever You take me Im following You  
Im gonna follow You  
With everything I say and everything I do  
Im gonna follow You  
With every step I take I know that Youre with me  
Im gonna follow You  
Im taking up my cross Im following You  
Im gonna follow You  
  
BRIDGE  
Youre everything that I live for  
Ill follow after You  
Every day of my life Lord  
Ill follow after You  
  
TAG  
Ill follow after You  
Im gonna follow You  
REPEAT
