Summer princess midnight maiden  
When I first saw you I just breathed  
Into your smile my past went fadin  
Inside your voice my mind was sheathed  
In lost lagoon we waited wadin  
Along the streets we went paradin  
Never looking back to where wed been  
  
Autumn temptress sundown angel  
Inside your blood you arent so young  
I came to you a loving vandal  
And heard your heart and touched your tongue  
Day became a lighted candle  
Sky fell down beneath your sandal  
In your eye I began to spin  
  
Winter harlot moontime lover  
I cant speak when I feel this way  
Dont keep your feelings undercover  
Tell me what you want today  
Dont leave me in the air to hover  
Sing it out dont make me suffer  
Dont be ashamed love is no sin  
  
Springtime woman sunrise girl  
I am hiding behind the sea  
Trick or treat the Halloween world  
Hide and seek but you cant catch me  
I wont chase you until you hurl  
Your wing to me and make me twirl  
Youre alive underneath my skin
