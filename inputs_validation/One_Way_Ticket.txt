Dont want to fall into belivin nothin  
Theres enough room for all of you to stay  
I dont feel guilty when you say Im wastin my time  
Sittin next door to the girl in the store  
She keeps on dreamin with a look in her eye  
Everyone believes in the future theyve seen in next months magazine  
  
Chorus  
I wanna run with you until I lose control  
Dont wanna worry about gettin by  
I wanna breathe when Im breathin  
And see what Im seein  
Take a one way ticket tonight  
  
A stock market crash  
Mr Man low on cash  
If he hit it big it would make it alright  
But he dont remember the last cold December  
Or the sun on his face feelin fine  
Just lyin on the floor in the room by the door  
She shot this life in one too many lines  
She needed a good time leave the past behind  
She got what she wanted alright  
  
Chorus x2  
  
If anyone comes callin then you can tell them  
Im done with sittin wastin my life  
Ive packed my bags Im searchin for something anything  
And I wont be comin back  
  
Chorus  
  
I want to run with you until I lose control  
Dont want to worry about getting by  
I want to breathe when Im breathing  
Believe it believe it  
Take a one way ticket tonight  
  
I wanna run with you until I lose control  
Dont wanna worry about gettin by  
I wanna breathe when Im breathin  
And see what Im seein  
Take a one way ticket tonight  
Ill take a one way ticket tonight  
Ill take a one way ticket tonight  
Ill take a one way ticket tonight  
Ill take a one way ticket tonight
