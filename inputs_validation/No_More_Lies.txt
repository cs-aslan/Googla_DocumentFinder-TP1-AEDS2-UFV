I need you like you need me  
Truly and completely  
Never be apart  
I think that you should tell me  
Come right out and tell me  
Just whats in your heart  
And if you think that its alright  
Lets make a deal and work it out  
Well walk into the sunset you and I  
With no more alibis  
When we tell each other  
No more lies  
  
Well truth is my addiction  
Stranger still than fiction  
Wider than the sky  
And songs that have such feeling  
Words that have such meaning  
Dreams that never die  
  
And if you think that its alright  
Lets turn around and start again  
Well walk beside the ocean hand in hand  
With no more alibis  
When we tell each other  
No more lies  
  
I sometimes think that maybe  
Youre just a little girl  
You know I love you baby  
Ive got to tell the world  
  
So thats the final story  
The truth in all its glory  
See how much I care  
You know you drive me crazy  
Thrill me and amaze me  
Drive me to despair  
  
And if you think that now feels right  
Lets close the door and dim the light  
Well greet the dawn together side by side  
Just look into my eyes  
Cause you know Ill tell you  
No more lies
