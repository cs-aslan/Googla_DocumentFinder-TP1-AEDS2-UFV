See the signs madness all around us  
Somewhere I hear sirens wailing through the night  
Read The Times starts to make me wonder is there  
More to life than black and white  
  
Id never thought Id question thought Id question  
The doubt Im seeing everywhere doubt Im seeing everywhere  
Standing here beside me youre the answer youre the answer  
When I lose my faith youre there  
  
Chorus  
Face the fire in a world gone wild  
Youre the fortress in my life  
Seeing the world through a childs eyes  
They cant fool me now  
I dont believe its all a world gone wild  
  
Its a lie the more you get the more you want it leads to nowhere  
Should have learned by now  
What is life without someone to share  
The mountains that you climb to reach the sky  
With everyone uncertain everyone uncertain  
The futures never really clear never really clear  
Standing here beside me youre the reason  
I found my faith again with you here  
  
Chorus  
  
They cant bring me down  
I dont believe its all a world gone wild  
  
Now you can count on me to keep you safe  
Ill be your shelter from the storm  
Come lay down with me and let our spirits melt us into one  
  
Chorus
