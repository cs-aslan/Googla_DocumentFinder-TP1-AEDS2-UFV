Fabolous  
i cant deny it  
u a dick rider  
u can never flow like me  
blow like me y would a bitch like ya  
when they can see that Im a fucking rider  u a hitchhiker  
u never seen a coup that gone arobbin  
the dealer says the same beamer bond was driving  
220 on the za dash  
when the 3a flash  
turn ur brains to a v8 splash and ur body  
with this lifestyle poster style  
I get right like a lifestyle poster child  
niggas in the game as haggy  
when u put the heat to him they talk the same as shaggy it wasnt me   
nigga u cant even think a freestyles on ur own  
got 911 on speedial on ur phone  
still nuttin  
i roll for thous now  
got every ghetto girl going crazy  
thats too old for bow wow  
  
yo  
I got the feds in paranoia  
Im the only kid that come to court in a pair of nikes  
with a pair of lawers  
who murders wen they walk  
Have witness sayin duhduhduhduh to nervous to talk  
Ship niggas is opposed  
To put insurance on their bitch  
cuz now i ship niggas for their hoes  
only take 5 of these spraid  
After I roll up behind you like privacy shades  
All yall could do is look at my studs and shiver  
Or be rocking my watch  
At the bottom of the Hudson River  
Want to get me for my dough then fine  
But u better be a model for a bullet proof clothin line  
Youall see the size of the bags that my dope be in  
Got niggas pockets lookin like Ethiopians  
You broke niggas could be fixed and  
Im the reason aint no original and the already talkin REMIX  
  
Paul Cain  
  
Its Paul Cain season again  
Im like a 2k peewee kirkland  
study oldtimers learn to put easy workin  
Know these niggas wanna see me hurtin  
Thats what would get them shot poped up with the DE squirt gun  
Still focused on flippin them packs  
Cop the ESCALADE on 20s with the system in back  
Come thru gucci jeans suits fisherman hat  
Why the white ubs Double G stiched in the back  
Since half yall haters learn the aim able to stear  
handle the wheel like NASCAR racers  
Im 57 tower over every oppenent  
Ask CLUE where he got the title HEAVY COMPONENTS  
Quietly Im the best in the game  
Im never changin my image juz adding specs and a chain  
And yall niggaz know its on for life  
PAUL CAIN FABOLOUS CLUE DESERT STORM for life
