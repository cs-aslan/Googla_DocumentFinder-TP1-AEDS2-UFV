Just a one pump fillin station  
Lord and one old general store  
I found her in that wide spot  
In the road  
  
And the brightest lights shed ever seen  
Were the headlights on my pickup  
Till she saw the lights behind  
Those swinging doors  
  
And everywhere she goes  
She leaves the jukebox smoking  
Everywhere shes been  
Theres ashes on the ground  
  
I see the glow in the sky  
Through the teardrops in my eyes  
My old flames out burnin  
Another honky tonk down  
  
So country young and pretty  
Shes never been no where before  
And I lost her behind  
Those swinging doors  
  
Now its just me and my old pickup  
Making every joint in town  
Cause tonight shes out somewhere  
To burn one down  
  
And everywhere she goes  
She leaves the jukebox smoking  
Everywhere shes been  
Theres ashes on the ground  
  
I see the glow in the sky  
Through the teardrops in my eyes  
My old flames out burnin  
Another honky tonk down  
  
My old flames out burnin  
Another honky tonk down
