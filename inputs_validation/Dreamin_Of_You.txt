The light  
In this place  
Is really bad  
Like being  
In the bottom  
Of a stream  
Any minute now  
Im expecting  
To wake up  
From a dream  
Miss so much  
The softest touch  
Like the grave  
Of some child child  
Who neither wept  
Nor smiled  
Im hiding my faith  
In the rain  
Ive been  
Dreamin of you  
Thats all I do  
And its  
Driving me insane  
  
Somewhere dawn  
Is breaking  
Light is streaking  
Across the floor  
Church bells  
Are ringing  
I wonder who  
Theyre ringing for  
Travel under any star  
Youll see me  
Wherever you are  
  
The shadowy past  
Is so vague and so vast  
Im sleeping  
In the balance of pain  
Ive been dreamin of you  
Thats all I do  
But its  
Driving me insane  
  
Maybe theyll get me  
Maybe they wont  
But whatever  
It wont be tonight  
I wish your hand  
Was in mine right now  
We could go  
Where the moon is wide  
  
For years  
They had me  
Locked in a cage  
Then they threw me  
Onto the stage  
Somethings  
Just last longer  
Then you  
Thought they would  
And they never  
Ever explain  
Im dreamin of you  
Thats all I do  
And its  
Driving me insane  
  
Well  
I eat when Im hungry  
Drink when Im dry  
Live my life  
On the square  
Even if the flesh  
Falls off my face  
It wont matter as long  
As youre there  
  
Feel like  
A ghost in love  
Underneath  
The heavens above  
Feel further away  
Then I ever did before  
Feel further  
Than I can take  
Dreamin of you  
Thats all I do  
But its  
Driving me insane  
  
Everything in the way  
Is so shy like the day  
In queer and unusual form  
Spirals of golden haze here  
In there in a blaze  
Like beams of light  
In a star  
  
Maybe youre here  
Or maybe you werent  
Maybe you  
Touched somebody  
And got burned  
The silent sun  
Has got me on the run  
Burning a hole  
In my brain  
Im dreamin of you  
Thats all I do  
But its  
Driving me insane
