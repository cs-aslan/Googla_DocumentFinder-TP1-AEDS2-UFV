Look at me  
High upon the hill  
You could say  
Im on top of the world  
Baby  Im blue  
All because of you  
I can see this city  
Crumble all around me  
Press me to your chest  
Block out the view  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
  
You made me  
Some kind of criminal  
You put me outlaw  
Because I loved you  
  
In my time  
One thing Ive learned  
If you play with fire  
You get burned  
Oh baby its true  
I got burned by you  
I put everything I had  
Into a bag  
And trusted you to do  
What you didnt do  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
  
You made me  
Some kind of criminal  
You put me outlaw  
Because l loved you  
  
The first thing I think when I wake up  
When can I see you  
The last thing I think when Im drifting off  
When will I see you  
  
Oh look at me  
Im addicted still  
At first I refused  
Now I just swallow the pill  
Oh baby wont you  
Fix me like you used to  
I could spend my time in hell  
I might as well  
Cause hell is where Im bound to dwell  
Without you  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
  
You made me  
Some kind of criminal  
You put me outlaw  
Because I loved you
