You a very bad guy  
Were a little match made in Heaven if I say so Yayo  
Come over here boy and playo  
  
Work it out

Everyones dream  
You think you like me now  
You should hear me sing

If we got together I know it would be hothot

Long hair

Polka dots  
Some desire in your thoughts  
Thinking of you  
Dreaming of us

Thinking of you  
Dreaming of us

You know that Im to die for
