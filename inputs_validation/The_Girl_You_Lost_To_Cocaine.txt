Ive stuck around through thick and through thin  
You cannot deny Ive always been in  
But Ive watched you stand still as a snowman  
But I dont see you change youre always at meltdown  
  
Yeah Ive been your crutch your smell sight and touch  
Yeah I took you home when youve drunk too much  
But I cant survive with you by my side  
See Ill never get laid while Im running your life  
  
No I just dont wanna so Im walking away  
There is nothing that you can do I will not stay  
No I dont need drama so Im walking away  
Yeah I am a girl with a lot on her plate  
  
So just cut me loose learn to tie your shoes  
Theres somebody here Id like to introduce  
So look in the mirror look for the glass  
Cause youre not my problem you are my last  
  
No I just dont wanna so Im walking away  
There is nothing that you can do I will not stay  
No I dont need drama so Im walking away  
Yeah I am a girl with a lot on her plate  
  
No I just dont wanna so Im walking away  
There is nothing that you can do I will not stay  
No I dont need drama so Im walking away  
Im just a girl that you lost to cocaine
