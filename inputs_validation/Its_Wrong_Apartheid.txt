The wretchedness of Satans wrath  
Will come to seize you at last  
Cause even he frowns upon the deeds you are doing  
And you know deep in your heart  
Youve no covenant with God  
Cause he would never countenance people abusing  
You know apartheids wrong wrong  
Like slavery was wrong wrong  
Like the holocaust was wrong wrong  
Apartheid is wrong wrong wrong  
Its wrong wrong wrong  wrong  
Wrong wrong wrong wrong  
The pain you cause in Gods name  
Points only to yourself to blame  
For the negative karma you will be receiving  
Cause when people are oppressed  
With atrocities that test  
The future of all mankind we  
The world wont stand seeing  
You know apartheids wrong wrong  
Like slavery was wrong wrong  
Like the holocaust was wrong wrong  
Apartheid is wrong wrong wrong  
Its wrong wrong wrong  wrong  
Wrong wrong wrong wrong  
Ubuqaba babo bucacile

Ngoba nosathane uyabugxeka  
Lobuqaba
