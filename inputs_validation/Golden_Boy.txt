Golden boy  
Take your place  
Among the stars  
  
Light your fire  
Cast your glow  
Near and far  
  
Mothers eyes  
Warm you when you sleep  
  
Theres a tree  
By a brook  
In the glade  
  
Theres a wave  
Off a cape  
Making way  
  
Galaxies  
Rush away from you  
  
Ill be there  
In the wind  
In your sails  
  
Through the clouds  
Through the fog  
Through the gates  
  
Ill be there  
Golden boy for you
