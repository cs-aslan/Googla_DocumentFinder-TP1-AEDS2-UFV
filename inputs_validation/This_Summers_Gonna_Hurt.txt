Fucker  
  
Verse 1  
Her bodys hot  
Her bodys like the summer  
Im in a trance or something  
Her mind is not no  
As sharp as all her diamonds  
She must be smoking something  
  
PreChorus  
I see her dancing in the streets  
Sipping champagne on the beach  
So expensive when she eats  
Cause shes so fancy  
I see her when I go to sleep  
I check my phone when I am weak  
She never posts anything deep  
Cause shes so fancy  
  
Hook  
  
Verse 2  
She wants it all  
Shes always taking something  
And now Im left with nothing  
Im ripping off oh  
Im ripping off that bandage  
Because I just cant stand it  
  
PreChorus 2  
I see her dancing on a fool  
Like shes seventeen and cool  
She really thinks that she can move  
But its just nasty  
I see her when I go to sleep  
I check my phone when I am weak  
She never posts anything deep  
Cause shes so fancy  
  
Hook  
  
Middle Eight  
Has to have it all  
Chases every star  
Shes so popular  
Whoo  
Has to have it all  
Chases every star  
Shes so popular  
Ohh  
  
This summers gonna hurt  
Its gonna hurt  
  
I see her dancing in the street  
Sipping champagne on the beach  
So expensive when she eats  
Cause shes so fancy  
Cause shes so fancy
