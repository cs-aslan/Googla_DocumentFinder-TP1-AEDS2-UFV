Well I met him in Minnesota  
He was dark and overcast  
With long grey hair and eyes that stared  
Through me like I was glass  
I asked Where are you going to  
He said Im the wind Im just blowing through  
He lit up a cigarette and began to talk  
  
Said  
The doctors told me that my body wont hold me  
My lungs are turning black  
Been lucky strikes four since I was at school now there aint no turning  
Back  
They cant tell me how long Ive got  
Maybe months but maybe not  
So Im taking this bike and riding to New York  
  
Cause I wanna see my granddaughter one last time  
Wanna hold her close and feel her tiny  
Heart beat next to mine  
Wanna see my son and the man hes become  
Tell him Im sorry for the things Ive done  
And Id do it if I had to walk  
Oh Im taking this bike and riding to New York  
  
Through the forests of West Constant  
That I knew as a boy  
Past the sky line of Chicago  
Round the lakes of Illinois  
I lay my head in a motel bed where my back gets sore and my eyes turn red  
Listen to the trucks roll past my door  
Through the fields of Ohio as the sunshine paints them gold  
I run just like a river runs rapid quick and cold  
And fly through Pennsylvania and the Jersey turn piked holes  
And I wont stop till I get to New York  
  
Cause I wanna see my grandson one last time  
I wanna see his eyes sparkling ans stare back into mine  
Now my time is short  
I wanna see my daughter  
Tell her all the things that I should have taught her  
And Id do it if I had to walk  
Oh Im taking this bike and riding to New York  
  
And Id go up to the churchyard one last time  
Lay flowers down for the woman who gave me the best years of my life  
And Id do it if I had to walk  
Yeah Id do it if I had to walk  
Im taking this bike and riding to New York
