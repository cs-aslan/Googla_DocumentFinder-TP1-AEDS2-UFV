The torch I carry is handsome  
Its worth its heartache in ransom  
And when the twilight steals  
I know how the lady in the harbor feels  
  
When I want rain I get sunny weather  
Im just as blue as the sky  
Since love is gone cant pull myself together  
Guess Ill hang my tears out to dry  
  
Friends ask me out  
I tell them Im busy  
I must get a new alibi  
I stay at home and ask myself where is he  
  
Guess Ill hang my tears out to dry  
Dry little teardrops  
Hanging on a string of dreams  
Fly little memories  
  
My little memories  
Remind him of our crazy schemes  
Somebody said just forget about him  
So I gave that treatment a try  
  
Strangely enough I got along without him  
Then one day he passed me right by  
Oh well I guess Ill hang my tears out to dry
