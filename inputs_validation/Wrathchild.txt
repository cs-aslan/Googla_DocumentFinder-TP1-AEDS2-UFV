I was born into a scene of angriness and greed and dominance and persecution  
My mother was a queen my dad Ive never seen I was never meant to be  
  
Now I spend my time looking all around  
For a man thats nowhere to be found  
Until I find him Im never gonna stop searching  
Im gonna find my man gonna travel around  
  
Cause Im a wrathchild well Im a wrathchild  
Yeah Im a wrathchild Im coming to get you oh yeah  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Say it doesnt matter aint nothin gonna alter the course of my destination  
I know Ive got to find some serious piece of mind or I know Ill go crazy  
  
But now I spend my time looking all around  
For a man thats nowhere to be found  
Until I find him Im never gonna stop searching  
Im gonna find my man gonna travel around  
  
Cause Im a wrathchild well Im a wrathchild  
Yeah Im a wrathchild Im coming to get you oh yeah
