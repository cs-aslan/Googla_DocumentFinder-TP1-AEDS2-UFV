Oh yeah yeah  
Last night I took a walk in the snow  
Couples holdin hands places to go  
Seems like everyone but me is in love  
Santa can you hear me  
I signed my letter that I sealed with kiss  
I sent it off it just said this  
i know exactly what I want this year  
Santa can you hear me  
I want my baby baby  
I want someone to love me someone to hold  
Maybe maybe  
Hell be all my own in a big red bow  
Santa can you hear me  
I have been so good this year  
And all I want is one thing  
Tell me my true love is here  
Hes all I want just for me  
Underneath my christmas tree  
Ill be waiting here  
Santa thats my only wish this year  
  
Yeahh  
Christmas eve I just cant sleep  
Would I be wrong for takin a peek  
cause I heard that youre comin to town  
Santa can you hear me  
I really hope that youre on your way  
With something special for me in your sleigh  
Oh please make my wish come true  
Santa can you hear me  
I want my baby baby  
I want someone to love me someone to hold  
Baby baby baby  
Well be all alone under the mistletoe  
Santa can you hear me  
I have been so good this year  
All I want is one thing  
Tell me my true love is here  
Hes all I want just for me  
Underneath my christmas tree  
Ill be waiting here  
Santa thats my only wish this year  
  
I hope my letter reaches you in time oh yeah  
Bring me love I can call all mine oh yeah

Cant be alone under the mistletoe  
Hes all I want in a big red bow
