Dance Rock Feel the heat  
Rock your body to the Native Beat  
  
Chorus  
Step by step  
  
Slowly I turn  
Step by step  
Seemon  
Well here I am I got the heat  
Im gonna rock to the rhythm of the Body heat  
  
Seemon now lets have big fun  
Rock to the rhythm lets get undone  
  
Designer jeans my teenage dream  
Of love is on my mind  
This Native Love is restless  
And Im just not satisfied  
  
And I never get enough  
Of that Native Love  
  
Chorus  
  
Slowly I turn  
Step by step  
  
Seemon  
My car is by Ferrari  
And my bodys Jack La Lanne  
My clothes are by Armani  
And my hair is by Elaine  
Tiffany and Cartier are  
Telling me the time  
This Native Love is restless  
And Im just not satisfied  
And I never  
  
Chorus  
  
Slowly I turn  
Step by step  
Seemon  
  
Hey GO man here  
I am for everyone to see  
If Im not your type  
Well thats alright  
Cause that just dont matter to me  
I got the rhythm and the rhyme  
And Im right on time  
And Im gonna blow your mind  
This Native Love is restless  
And Im just not satisfied  
  
Chorus  
  
Slowly I turn  
Step by step  
Seemon
