About 6 months ago someone came by with a petition  
Said wed wanna stop these folks moving in next door  
I refused to sign and told him everyone was welcome  
Cause thats what neighbourhoods are for  
So they moved in and Ill admit they look peculiar  
They invited me to a friendly barbeque  
Glad I got to know em and let me tell you something  
They may be metallic but theyre just like me and you  
No theres nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus  
They gave me zucchini from their garden yesterday theyre very fresh  
No theres nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus  
You may disagree but I think theyre AOK  
My buddy Charlie never got off the robots backs  
Then one day him and his whole house disappeared  
I talked about it to my neighbours the killer robots from Venus  
They couldnt help me but agreed that it was wierd  
No theres nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus  
They always mow their lawn and they joined the PTA because we care  
No theres nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus  
You may disagree but I think theyre AOK  
They had us over for an outdoor New Years party  
Though it was 10 below there was food and drink aplenty  
They got excited as we counted down with them  
And when we kissed them our lips stuck to their heads ouch  
I was watching the news last night when I saw something funny  
Killer robots from somewhere decimated Montreal  
I wondered could it be my neighbours the killer robots from Venus  
Could it be them after all  
No Theyre so nice Yeah  
No theres nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus  
They applauded for my kid at the Christmas play he was the best

No theres nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus  
You may disagree but I think theyre AOK  
You may disagree but I think theyre AOK  
You may disagree but I think theyre AOK Were OK
