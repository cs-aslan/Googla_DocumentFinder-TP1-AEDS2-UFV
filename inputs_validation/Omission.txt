I said  
Why do I always have to spell it out for you  
Our story is always changing  
We change it to hide the pain  
  
And when the truth rears  
its ugly head its all too late  
Too late for the omission  
That you kept inside and wished it was you  
  
Does it seem like the same man  
Doesnt seem the same at all  
I can feel myself fall falling down  
You can wave goodbye to your bad side  
  
And suppress the feelings that could hurt you mind  
There is no need for lies if the news aint breaking  
Framework falling down on the downside  
Built on a weak spot  
  
Facts hiding in your mind  
Wait until the bomb drops  
We have more sense than lies  
The story is in our eyes  
  
Does it seem like the same man  
Doesnt seem the same at all  
I can feel myself fall  
Falling down on the downside  
  
Built on a weak spot  
Facts hiding in your mind  
Wait until the bomb drops  
It doesnt seem like the same man  
  
Doesnt seem the same at all  
I can feel myself fall falling down
