Hey  
Uhhuh  
Well alright  
  
How yall doing Yes Maam  
Lookin mighty fine  
  
Ive been around the world  
Seen so many pretty girls  
But I still get overwhelmed  
When I look in your eyes  
  
Been from Maine to Spain  
But everything seems the same  
I only feel a change  
When I look in your eyes  
  
I know youre upper class  
I know youve got pizzas  
Every man wanna kiss yo  
And I do too  
  
Sometimes Im just a clown  
And everybody puts me down  
I guess Ill come around  
When I look in your eyes  
  
Tell me whats a man to do  
To get close to you  
Im just a lonely fool  
When I look in your eyes  
  
Dont tell me no this time  
If you do itll blow my mind  
Have you ever seen a grown man cry  
Its an awful thing  
  
I guess its time to say goodbye  
But Ive gotta give it one more try  
Im only satisfied  
When I look in your eyes  
  
Oh please come home with me  
Oh dont you wanna marry me  
Im even goin rub your feet when they stank how can i  
How can I let you down  
I guess Im always goin be around  
Im simply astounded  
When I look in your eyes
