Lets take your car and to amusement parks USA  
At Palisades in Salisbury park the roller coasters are flyin  
At Euclid Beach on the flying turns Ill bet you cant keep her smilin  
Buy your girl a cotton candy while youre down on the ground  
Then take her on the TwirlAWay and spin her around  
Lets take your car and mess around at the park all day  
  
The parachutes at Riverview Park will shake us up all day  
And Disneyland and pop is worth a trip to LA  
Watchin girls in the air can really get you bad  
And Ill bet the laughin lady makes you laugh like mad  
Lets pick up our friends and do amusement parks USA  
  
Hurry hurry hurry folks step right up to the beach boy circus  
The best little show in town  
Hurry hurry hurry its only a dime folks one thin dime just one tenth of
a dollar  
Come on in and see Stella the snake dancer is it real  
She walks she talks she wiggles on her belly like a snake  
she looks like a fake to me lets go see her it costs too much  
Hurry hurry hurry folks come on and see Stella  
She shimmies she shakes  
  
Youll crash and burn in the bumper cars at Jerseys Steel Pier  
Youll crack em up when you stand in front of all the crazy mirrors  
At first youll be a chicken at the jackhammer ride  
But youll do it with a girl sittin right by your side  
Lets take your car and mess around at the park all day
