Baby let me hold your hand  
Until I make you understand  
Ohh baby baby let me hold your hand  
I really believe everything will sure be grand  
Baby I want you by my side  
Our love we could never hide  
Ohh baby baby I want you by my side  
Well you know pretty baby our love we would never hide

Cadillac and everything  
Then baby Im gonna buy you a house in style  
Then Ill live there forever yes lord with my little wife and child
