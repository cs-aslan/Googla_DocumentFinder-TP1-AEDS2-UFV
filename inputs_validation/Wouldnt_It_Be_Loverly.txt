Words and Music by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe  
  
All I want is a room somewhere  
Far away from the cold night air  
With one enormous chair  
Oh wouldnt it be loverly  
  
Lots of chocolate for me to eat  
Lots of coal makin lots of eat  
Warm face warm ands warm feet  
Oh wouldnt it be loverly  
  
Oh so loverly sittin absobloominlutely still  
I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  
  
Someones ead restin on my knee  
Warm and tender as e can be  
Who takes good care of me  
Oh wouldnt it be loverly  
  
Who takes good care of me  
Oh wouldnt it be loverly loverly  
Loverly lovely  
Oh wouldnt it be loverly
