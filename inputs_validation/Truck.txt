Children all have saviors  
Children dont care who saves us  
Round the corner round the bend  
Fingernails torn to the end  
Bring back bring back  
Bring back bring back on me  
On me  
  
I told them we scold them  
Cant console them always  
Toy soldiers falling  
Dominoes but who knows  
  
Bring back bring back  
Bring back bring back on me  
On me  
  
Yeah and I dream of falling stars  
And tokes for all my friends  
And I will live forever  
Yeah and I dream of all Im worth  
And all along the way  
And I will never even  
Yeah and I will coast through falling prayers  
And all along the way  
And I will always listen  
  
Bring back bring back I  
Bring back bring back Or  
Bring back bring back We  
On me  
Bring it back bring it back on  
Bring it back bring it back on  
Bring it back bring it back on
