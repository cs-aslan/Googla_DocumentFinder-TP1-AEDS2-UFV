Well its a long long road when youre out there alone  
No matter what side youre on  
But theres a heart of gold behind the smile  
And it brought me to where I belong  
  
Cause Id set my sights on finding you  
And Im staying forever you know its true  
Yes Id set my sights on finding you  
Dont be lonely tonight we can make it alright  
  
No matter what you say  
No matter who you are  
Love always finds a way  
Finds a way to your heart  
  
Well its a cold lonely road but you can survive  
No matter which way you choose  
And as long as theres life behind these eyes  
Im here with you win or lose  
  
If you let your light shine on through  
Someone will come round to pull you through  
Yes just let your light shine on through  
Dont be lonely tonight you can make it alright  
  
Just hold my hand  
Come with me a while Ill make you smile  
Just hold my hand  
Theres someone who loves you its me oh its me  
  
No matter what you say  
No matter who you are  
Love always finds a way  
Finds a way to your heart  
  
Its alright that you cry if youre lonely sometime  
No matter whos by your side  
Cause the love that you look for is inside us all  
But its something you have to find  
  
And Id set my sights on finding you  
And Im staying forever you know its true  
Yes Id set all my sights on finding you  
Dont be lonely tonight we can make it alright  
  
No matter what you say  
No matter who you are  
Love always finds a way  
Finds a way to your heart
