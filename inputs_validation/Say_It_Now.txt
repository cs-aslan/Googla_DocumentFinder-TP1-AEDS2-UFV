I hope you hear this cause Im about to say it now  
Guess Im to blame and its just a shame  
Cause I had the chance to tell you what you meant  
But I lived my life thinking I had time  
And that in my mind Id get to it  
  
Now youve gone away not a single day goes by  
When I dont think about it  
Your spirits all around I can say it now  
I hope you hear this  
  
Now its a shame that I found out the hard way  
And it aint the same  
Cause you never ever got to hear me say  
That I love you cause I waited too late  
So oh Ive got to tell everybody  
Dont make the same mistake  
  
Chorus  
Its alright to say I love you out loud  
And its all good so dont you keep it inside  
Let it out do it today  
No no no dont you wait  
Cause it just might be too late  
To say I love you  
  
Dont walk a mile inside my shoes  
Cause if you do youre gonna regret it  
Dont take it lightly thinking they might be  
Here or there tomorrow  
  
Why you want to wait communicate  
Dont assume that they already know  
How much how much youre really feeling  
And you really really love them  
  
Now its a shame that I found out the hard way  
And it aint the same  
Cause you never ever got to hear me say  
That I love you cause I waited too late  
Its like I would tell anybody  
Dont make the same mistake like I did  
  
Chorus  
  
Those three words make all the difference in the world  
You might wait and miss your chance  
So dont be scared to say what youre feeling  
You cant turn back the hands of time  
If you get the chance do it right  
Let it out say it now  
Say it  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Im ready  
Ready to shout it out shout it out loud  
So ready  
Oh how I wish I could tell you right now  
But I waited too late  
So today I wont make the same mistake no  
I wont do it and if I get the chance Ill say it  
  
Chorus x3  
  
Its alright
