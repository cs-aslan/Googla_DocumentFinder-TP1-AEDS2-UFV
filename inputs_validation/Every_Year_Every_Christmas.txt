I dont know how love could do this to me  
Ive waited and waited for someone I never see  
But Im so sentimental and Im so hopeful youll be there  
So here I am every year every Christmas  
  
Ive wished for you in my heart and in my head  
And I got my answer that first moment that we met  
And oh yes I believed you as you told me as you said  
Youd be here every year every Christmas  
  
There must be a lesson for me to learn  
If you dont trust in love youll get nothing in return  
Why should I be lonely dont tell me its right  
I have my pride but Id rather be with you tonight  
  
So much emotion its driving me mad  
But Ill take my chances with these feelings that I have  
And Ill come back to this same corner where we met  
And Ill be here every year every Christmas  
  
Mere words cant explain the pain and the fear  
Cause oh I wonder yes I wonder are you gonna leave me standing here  
Todays almost over but I dont want to leave  
Has my heart made a fool out of me  
  
My friends gather round me with holiday cheer  
They say to forget you to let you go cause youre not here  
Well I cant keep explaining what theyll never understand  
And why Im here every year every Christmas  
I return every year every Christmas  
I come here every year every Christmas
