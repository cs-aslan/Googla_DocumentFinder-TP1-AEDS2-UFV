Peter sat on a mountain top  
Northern wind blows through his hair all day long  
Peter never took no time for him to stop  
Just stood right there and he stared  
Singing oh  
  
He dont need us anymore  
Cause his life is just too good  
Hell be living everyday  
And loving like we could  
And thats Peters song  
  
Have you ever known a boy lonely as could be  
A lifetime ago he was a child of the free  
So here he stand alone crying at the sea  
It listens and moves and holds him  
Singing oh  
  
He dont need us anymore  
Cause life is just too good  
Hell be living everyday  
And loving like we could  
and thats Peters song  
  
Late one day on the mountaintop  
Peter swept down the side  
Hed been waiting all his life  
For one more chance to ride  
But the Sun said Son dont you  
Come around up here anymore  
So Peter topped on his hat  
And head to the west shore  
Singing Ladanday  
  
Have you ever known a boy lonely as can be  
Lifetimes away we were children of the sea  
And if the Sun and Moon come through  
Freedom is a giude  
Hoping that one day we will all try  
Singing Ladanday
