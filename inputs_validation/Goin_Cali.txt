Well hed been hearing too many voices and feelina little offrack  
Like there was something big pressing down on his back  
So he called up his friends and they said come on out west  
Its a place where a man can really feel his succes  
  
So he pulled his heart and soul down off the shelf  
Packed them next to the faith that hed lost in himself  
Said his goodbyes and when the dirty work was done  
He turned his wheels into the fading sun  
  
For seven days and nights like a blacktop bird he sped  
Maintained radio silence cept for in his head  
And just like his folks did back in 69  
He crossed the border at Needles and heard the promised land on the line  
  
Now where the Transcontinental dumps into the sea  
Theres a bar made up to look like 1963  
Girl in the corner eyed him like a hungry dog a bone  
As he brushed the desert dust off that Mercedes chrome  
Bartender said Hey hows it hangin tiger  
He had a shot of tequila smiled and whispered lighter  
  
He went down to the desert city where the rattlesnakes play  
And left his dead skin by the roadside in the noon of day  
Sun got so hot it almost felt like friend  
It could burn out every trace of where you been  
  
There was a woman hed met in a desert song  
A little while later a son come along  
Looked at that boys smile and called it home  
And that night as he lay in bed the only voice he heard was his own
