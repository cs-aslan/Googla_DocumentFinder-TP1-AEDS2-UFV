Diane Diane unfaithful Diane  
With golden hair and lips like wine  
And blue eyes as blue as the sky  
A dream I once knew knew that can never come true  
And only in dreams is she mine  
Oh Diane Diane unfaithful Diane  
My heart is at your command  
Why should my heart so true love all be for you  
Why I cant understand  
So heartsick Ill be cause youll never love me  
Youll never love any one man  
Oh Diane Diane unfaithful Diane  
  
Oh not so long ago this angel I know  
She got hold in my arms so tight  
I knew she were true but just like a fool  
I lingered now I cry each night  
For Diane Diane unfaithful Diane  
Oh my heart is at your command  
Why should my heart so true love all be for you  
Why I cant understand  
So heartsick Ill be cause youll never love me  
But I still love you Diane
