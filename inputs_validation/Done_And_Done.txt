Done and done  
I never get my way  
You always get your way  
I never get my way  
  
Done and done  
Talk about me  
Ill listen for hours  
Cause I dont know how it ends

Through and through  
Yeah through through  
Through and through  
  
Done and done  
You always get your way  
I never get my way  
You always get your way  
  
Done and done  
Days accomplished  
If I had a wish  
Itd be for more of this  
  
This through through  
Through and through  
Yeah through through  
Through and through  
  
Done and done  
Night accomplished  
If I had a wish  
Id wish for more of this  
  
This through through  
This through and through  
Were through through  
Yeah through and through
