Were drifting apart  
But I want you to know  
Wherever you are I belong  
Loves singing us a song  
But we fail to sing along  
Wherever you go I will follow  
  
So please dont let it  
Please dont let it go  
Cause if you wont let it I wont let it go  
So please dont let it  
Please dont let it go  
Cause if you wont let it I wont let it go  
  
You try to be strong  
But youre always so alone  
Whatever I do I do you wrong  
Death sings our song  
And we eagerly sing along  
Whatever you do I adore  
  
So please dont let it  
Please dont let it go  
Cause if you wont let it I wont let it go  
So please dont let it  
Please dont let it go  
Cause if you wont let it I wont let it go  
  
Dont let go of life  
Let go of love  
Let go of all we have  
  
Dont let go of trust  
Let go of lust  
Let go of all we share  
  
So please dont let it  
Please dont let it go  
Cause if you wont let it I wont let it go  
Please dont let it  
Please dont let it go  
And if you wont let it I wont let it go  
  
So please dont let it  
Please dont let it go  
Cause if you wont let it I wont let it go  
Please dont let it  
Please dont let it go  
Cause if you wont let it I wont let it go
