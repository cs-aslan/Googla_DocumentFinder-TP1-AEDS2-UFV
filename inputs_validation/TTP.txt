Oh oh oh TTP  
Oh oh oh TTP  
  
Somebody tell me  
Why do people stay in situations thatll never work  
Thinkin bout you wanna leave and  
You cant wait to get even  
  
When deep inside it really hurts  
I never should have gotten in the mix  
You never understand till you go through it  
All the rights things you say  
  
Wrong things to do  
While youre out tryna pick and choose  
  
You should be lookin for a TTP  
Now that I know the difference  
Thats all Im tryna be with  
Somebody that keeps it all in together now  
  
Im living better  
Since I found my total package  
  
You should be lookin for a TTP  
Now that I know the difference  
Thats all Im tryna be with  
Somebody that keeps it all in together now  
  
Im living better  
Since I found my total package  
  
I used to be young and dumb  
And always wanted to run in the streets  
Cause I thought that was where it was at  
But it wasnt all it did was leave a brother in the cold  
  
With nowhere to go  
I caught myself slippin  
Thinkin I was the lick I was trippin  
Tried to jump dip to dip  
  
I thought it was a way to be happy  
Until somebody took time to tell me  
  
You should be lookin for a TTP  
Now that I know the difference  
Thats all Im tryna be with  
Somebody that keeps it all in together now  
  
Im living better  
Since I found my total package  
  
You should be lookin for a TTP  
Now that I know the difference  
Thats all Im tryna be with  
Somebody that keeps it all in together now  
  
Im living better  
Since I found my total package  
  
So many people think  
They got it  but they dont have a clue  
You gotta have more than just a body  
For me to be talkin about you oh  
  
Take it from me when playin the game youre day will come  
When you gotta stop and start lookin for the world  
  
You should be lookin for a TTP  
Now that I know the difference  
Thats all Im tryna be with  
Somebody that keeps it all in together now  
  
Im living better  
Since I found my total package
