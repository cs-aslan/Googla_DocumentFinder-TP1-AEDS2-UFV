I used to think  
I had the answers to everything  
But now I know  
That life doesnt always go my way yeah  
  
Feels like Im caught in the middle  
Thats when I realize  
  
Im not a girl  
Not yet a woman  
All I need is time  
A moment that is mine  
While Im in between  
  
Im not a girl  
There is no need to protect me  
Its time that I  
Learn to face up to this on my own  
  
Ive seen so much more than you know now  
So dont tell me to shut my eyes  
  
Im not a girl  
Not yet a woman  
All I need is time  
A moment that is mine  
While Im in between  
  
Im not a girl  
But if you look at me closely  
Yeah you will see it my eyes  
This girl will always find her way  
  
Im not a girl  
Im not a girl dont tell me what to believe  
Not yet a woman  
Im just tryin to find the woman in me yeah  
  
All I need is time  
Oh all I need is time  
A moment that is mine  
That is mine  
While Im in between  
  
And Im not a girl  
Not yet a woman not now  
All I need is time  
Is all I need  
A moment that is mine  
While Im in between  
  
Im not a girl  
Not yet a woman
