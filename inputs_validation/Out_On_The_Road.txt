I never wanted to be taken  
But now Im feeling so left out  
So I dont care where I go  
Im leaving  
Yeah Im leaving  
  
Got about a half a tank left  
That could do but only if Im lucky  
But either way  
Im leaving  
Oh Im leaving  
  
On my way to paradise  
A little voice says  
Dont think twice  
And dont look back if you want things to change  
  
Ah ah  
Guess Ill have to love you from afar ah  
Its okay cause all I needs my car  
Out on the road out on the road  
Out on the road out on the road I go  
  
Out on the road out on the road  
Out on the road out on the road  
  
Takes about a week to get there  
Maybe two if I stop to sleep it off  
But I cant sleep  
So Im leaving  
Yeah Im leaving  
  
Keep on driving through the night  
I find myself a slice of life  
To show me that Im heading the right way  
  
And ah ah  
Guess youll have to love me from afar ah  
Its okay cause all I needs this car  
Out on the road out on the road  
Out on the road out on the road I go  
  
Out on the road out on the road  
Out on the road out on the road I go  
  
Out on the road out on the road  
Out on the road out on the road
