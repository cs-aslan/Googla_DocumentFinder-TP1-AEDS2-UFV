I dont need all my friends to tell me  
Things that I already know  
Like in the best of all worlds  
You shouldnt forget selfcontrol  
  
Dont say I dont know what Im doing  
Cause he said its more than a feeling  
And I said I need you too  
Am I just a fool  
  
I dont want to get hurt  
I dont want to get hurt  
Im not looking for just another heartache  
I dont want to get hurt  
But I know its a change Ive got to take  
  
I dont need all my friends to remind me  
Mistakes that Ive already made  
I just leave the past behind me  
And go on believing that Ill be okay  
  
Some thing are only human  
And he said hed always need me  
And I said I want you too  
Am I just a fool  
  
I dont want to get hurt  
I dont want to get hurt  
Im not looking for just another heartache  
I dont want to get hurt  
But I know its a chance Ive got to take  
  
Just another heartache  
I dont need all my friends to tell me  
Things that I already know  
Like in the best of all worlds  
You shouldnt forget selfcontrol  
  
Dont say I dont know what Im doing  
And he said its more than a feeling  
And I said I need you too  
Am I just a fool  
  
I dont want to get hurt  
I dont want to get hurt  
Im not looking for just another heartache  
I dont want to get hurt  
But I know its a chance Ive got to take  
  
I dont want to get hurt  
I dont want to get hurt  
Im not looking for just another heartache  
I dont want to get hurt  
But I know its a chance Ive got to take  
  
I dont want to get hurt  
I dont want to get hurt  
Im not looking for just another heartache  
I dont want to get hurt
