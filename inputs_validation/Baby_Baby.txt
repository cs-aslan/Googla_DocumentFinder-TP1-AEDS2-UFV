MmmmYoure so pretty  
Not to talk to you would be a crime  
Let me put my arms around you  
Just want to use up a little of your time  
And Im going  
  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
Wont you be my girl  
  
Youre eyes theyre so pretty  
The clothes you wear so fine  
Wont you come around to my place  
Just want to use up a little of your time  
And Im going  
  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
  
Wont you be my girl  
Come on come on come on  
  
Baby baby baby  
Wont you be my girl
