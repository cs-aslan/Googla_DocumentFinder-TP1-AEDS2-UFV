Just look through your window look who sits outside  
Little me is waiting standing through the night  
When you walk out through your door Ill wave my flag and shout  
  
Oh beautiful baby  
My burning desire started on Sunday  
Give me your heart and Ill love you till Tuesday  
  
Da da da dumb Repeat x4  
  
Whos that hiding in the apple tree clinging to a branch  
Dont be afraid its only me hoping for a little romance  
If you lie beneath my shade Ill keep you nice and cool  
  
Oh beautiful baby  
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday  
My passions neverending and Ill love you till Tuesday  
  
Da da da dumb Repeat x7  
  
Let the wind blow through your hair be nice to the big blue sea  
Dont be afraid of the man in the moon because its only me  
I shall always watch you until my love runs dry  
  
Ohh beautiful baby  
My hearts aflame Ill love you till Tuesday  
My heads in a whirl and Ill love you till Tuesday  
Love love love love you till Tuesday  
Love love love love you till Tuesday  
  
Da da da dumb Repeat x11  
  
Well I might stretch it till Wednesday
