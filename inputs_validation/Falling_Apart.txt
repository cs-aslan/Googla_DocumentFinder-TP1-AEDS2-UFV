Stutter step through another trap set by deception  
Mention rejection  
Always lies in your eyes  
Settles in your action  
Jeopardize everything that I want  
And I wont compromise anything anymore  
In any way victimize myself any more  
Liberty yeah  
  
Manipulations on my mind  
Expectations well defined  
Frustrate me  
Liberate me  
  
Cause everythings falling apart  
You cant control me You cant control me  
Everythings falling apart  
Now I cant see you  
Doesnt matter what I do  
I cant see you  
  
Cause everythings falling apart  
I got exposed to a deeper form of infection  
Shout out I need acception  
Always lies in your eyes  
Settles in your action  
  
Criticize everything that I do  
And I will overcome anything thats in store  
Nevermore look up to you and adore  
Liberty yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Manipulation is on my mind  
Inspect me try to check me  
Expectations well defined  
Dissect me want to wreck me  
Violator of my own will  
Accept me reject me  
Separate or shoot to kill  
  
Chorus
