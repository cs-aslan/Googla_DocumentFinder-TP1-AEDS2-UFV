Come gather around at the table  
In the spirit of family and friends  
And well all join hands and remember this moment  
Till The Season Comes Round Again  
  
Lets all try and smile for the picture  
And well hold it as long as we can  
May it carry us through should we ever get lonely  
Till The Season Comes Round Again  
  
One night holy and bright  
Shining with love from our hearts  
By a warm fire lets lift our hands high  
And be thankful were here till this time next year  
  
May the new year be blessed with good tidings  
Till the next time I see you again  
If we must say goodbye let the spirit go with you  
Till The Season Comes Round Again  
  
Musical Bridge  
One night holy and bright  
Shining with love from our hearts  
By a warm fire lets lift our hands high  
And be thankful were here till this time next year  
  
May the new year be blessed with good tidings  
Till the next time I see you again  
And well all join hands and remember this moment  
And well love and well laugh in the times that we have  
Till The Season Comes Round Again
