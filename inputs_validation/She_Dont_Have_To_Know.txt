Oohhhhhhh stealing moments just to be with you  
Though its wrong its hard to tell the truth  
But she dont have to know  
She dont have to know  
  
When I meet cha  
I got my shades on to cover up my eyes  
Im hoping that nobody sees me passing by  
Through my disguise  
I still know you recognize  
  
But you  
I know you got a lil secret of your own  
Sneaking out with me while your mans at home  
You know your wrong  
But its so strong still carrying on  
  
I go  
To the other side of town so I  
Will never risk the chance of catching her eye  
Cause she dont have to know  
She dont have to know  
Ooohhhh  
Girl I know your doing the same thing too  
But I wont tell your man the things we do oh no  
Cause he dont have to know  
He dont have to know  
  
Someones watching  
We got to be careful next time or were through  
 creeping creeping  
Damn its so stressful doing the dirt we do  
So sad but true  
And I know one day  
Im going to pay  
  
Then you ask me  
To sneak out of town for just a day or three  
One two three  
Go to DC and hold hands publicly  
All through the streets  
Cause they dont know you and they dont know me  
  
Ohhhhhh  
Ill feel sorry for mistake weve made  
But theres no reason that we should tell her today  
Ohhhhh  
Though you give a lot of love to me  
Girl I know Im not the only one you see  
But he dont have to know  
He dont have to know  
  
Oh my its getting crazy  
I dont want to hurt my baby  
And I know its supposed to be the last time for you and I  
  
But lets not end this way  
Wait another day
