Goodbye Baby Youre drivin me crazy  
You thought you had me baby but I was infatuated  
Things aint what they used to be and you cant do a darn thing for me  
Hey ooh waa ooh waa ooh waa ooh waa  
So long  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh waa ooh waa  
So long  
I said things aint what they used to be and you cant do a darn thing for me  
I knew you was cheatin boy it wasnt worth me competin now  
I aint gone cry no more Im gonna let you go  
I said things aint what they used to be and you cant do a darn thing for me  
Chorus
