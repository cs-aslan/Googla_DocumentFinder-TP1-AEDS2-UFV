From this moment on  
You for me dear  
Only two for tea dear  
From this moment on  
  
From this happy day  
No more blue songs  
Only hoopdedoo songs  
From this moment on  
  
Youve got the love I need so much  
Got the skin I love to touch  
Got the arms to hold me tight  
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight  
  
From this moment on  
You and I babe  
Well be ridin high babe  
Every care is gone  
From this moment on  
  
Youve got the love I need so much  
Got the skin I love to touch  
Got the arms to hold me tight  
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight  
  
From this moment on  
You and I babe  
Well be ridin high babe  
Every care is gone  
From this moment  
From this moment  
This very moment  
This moment on
