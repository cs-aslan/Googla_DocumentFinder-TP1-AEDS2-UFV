You made my decision  
Now take hold of my hand  
And Ill promise in front of the world  
To be your one true man  
  
Ill stand among my best friends  
They all understand  
That Im changing for the better yes I am  
Im your one true man  
  
I am your one true man  
Your one true man I am  
Im gonna love you like no one man can  
Your one true man I am  
  
Living wit me isnt easy  
My life has its demands  
But I want you to know that wherever I go  
Im your one true man  
  
I am your one true man  
You one true man I am  
  
Sometimes I get so crazy  
You get so hard to hold on to  
But I wont let you go  
Cause I know I know who I am  
  
I am your one true man  
Your one true man I am  
Im gonna love you like no one man can  
Your one true man I am
