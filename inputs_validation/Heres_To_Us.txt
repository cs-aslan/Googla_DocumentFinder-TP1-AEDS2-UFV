We could just go home right now  
Or maybe we could stick around  
For just one more drink oh yeah  
Get another bottle out  
Lets shoot the breeze  
Sit back down  
For just one more drink oh yeah  
  
Heres to us  
Heres to love  
All the times  
That we messed up  
Heres to you  
Fill the glass  
Cause the last few days  
Have gone too fast  
So lets give em hell  
Wish everybody well  
Heres to us  
Heres to us  
  
We stuck it out this far together  
Put our dreams through the shredder  
Lets toast cause things got better  
And everything could change like that  
And all these years go by so fast  
But nothing lasts forever  
  
Heres to us  
Heres to love  
All the times  
That we messed up  
Heres to you  
Fill the glass  
  
Cause the last few nights  
Have gone too fast  
  
If they give you hell  
Tell em to forget themselves  
Heres to us  
Heres to us  
  
Heres to all that we kissed  
And to all that we missed  
To the biggest mistakes  
That we just wouldnt trade  
  
To us breaking up  
Without us breaking down  
To whatevers come our way  
  
Heres to us  
Heres to us  
  
Heres to us  
Heres to love  
All the times  
That we messed up  
  
Heres to you  
Fill the glass  
  
Cause the last few days  
Have gone too fast  
  
So lets give em hell  
Wish everybody well  
  
Well  
  
Heres to us  
Heres to love  
  
All the times  
That we messed up  
Heres to you  
Fill the glass  
Cause the last few nights  
Have gone too fast  
If they give you hell  
Tell em forget themselves  
  
Heres to us  
  
Heres to us  
  
Oh heres to us  
  
Heres to us  
  
Heres to us  
Heres to love  
Heres to us  
  
Wish everybody well  
  
Heres to us  
Heres to love  
Heres to us  
  
Heres to us
