Im sending you this record please listen to it carefully  
The words are sayin darling I love you  
It looks like any other record but it says ohso easily  
The things that I cant say when Im with you  
I spent all last week and the week before  
Down at the neighbourhood record store  
Ive listened to a thousand tunes or more  
Till I found the one I was searchin for  
So Im sending you this record please listen to it carefully  
The words are sayin darling I love you
