Its easy sometimes when you just coast along  
But like it or not something always seems to go wrong  
Sometimes people build you up just so they can knock you down  
Sometimes they will have you there cause they need someone around  
  
Perhaps youll receive invitations for tea  
Perhaps youll laugh and make them all smile  
Or maybe youll join them cause it had to be  
Perhaps youll forget you forgot for awhile  
  
Birds of a feather are flocking outside  
Like whippets they dance in a curlyqueue dance  
Of pulses and ringing and campfire chants  
Of ritual drumming although at first glance  
You thought you could run but you wont take a chance  
  
Its not an experience if they cant bring someone along  
They hang on emotions they bottle inside  
They peck at the ground  
And strut out of stride
