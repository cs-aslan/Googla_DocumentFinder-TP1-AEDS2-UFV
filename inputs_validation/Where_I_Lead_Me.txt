Where I lead me I will travel  
Where I need me I will call me  
Im no fool Ill be ready  
God knows I will be  
And in the meantime make a little money  
And buy a little mercy  
  
Met this morning now he loves me  
Says he loves me  
It must be easy look around you  
All around you  
But you see the motion youre not movin  
You dont know how to hold on  
Just keep it loose  
Dont get excited itll pass before long  
  
Now one is goin one is stayin  
One is silent one is saying  
Heres your coat take care of yourself  
Sorry youre leavin  
A little sad youre all I had  
Will you be returnin  
  
The boys upstairs are gettin hungry  
You can shout in the wind about how it will be  
Or you can clench your fist shake your head  
And head to the country  
I got no doubt about it my friend  
Thats where theyll find me  
Thats where theyre gonna find me  
  
Ask the boys down in the gutter  
Now they wont lie cause you dont matter  
The streets just fine if youre good and blind  
But it aint where you belong  
Roll down your sleeves pick up your money  
And carry yourself home  
Roll down your sleeves pick up your money  
And carry yourself home
