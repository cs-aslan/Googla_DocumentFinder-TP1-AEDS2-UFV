The buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air  
The monkey thought that everything was on the square  
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back  
The monkey grabbed his neck and said now listen jack  
  
straighten up and fly right  
straighten up and fly right  
straighten up and fly right  
cool down papa dont you blow your top  
aint no use in jivin   
whats the use in dabbin   
straighten up and fly right  
cool down papa dont you blow your top  
  
The buzzard told the monkey youre chokin me  
release your hold and Ill set you free  
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said  
your storys fetchin but it sounds like a lie  
  
straighten up and fly right  
Straighten up and do right  
Straighten up and fly right  
Cool down papa dont you blow your top  
  
straighten up and fly right  
Straighten up and do right  
Straighten up and fly right  
Cool down papa dont you blow your top
