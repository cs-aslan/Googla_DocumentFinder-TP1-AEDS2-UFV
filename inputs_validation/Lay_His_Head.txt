I know that I seem strange to you sometimes  
And who is it in here you have often thought  
But what can I tell you  
That you dont know already  
Yes even the times like this  
Will roll away  
But I love you I love you  
I love you I love you  
Thats all that I ever really wanted  
I know that it will work out all the same  
And whoever it is in here can overcome the pain  
A true friends shoulder to lean on  
Ill make it through  
And over and over  
I feel for you  
But I love you I love you  
I love you I love you  
Thats all that I ever really wanted  
Oh yeah you know that sometimes a man  
He has nowhere to lay his head  
But what can I tell you  
That you dont know already  
Yes even the worst time like this  
Will blow away  
But I love you I love you  
I love you I love you  
Thats all that I ever really wanted  
Oh yeah you know that sometimes a man  
He has nowhere to lay his head nowhere I said nowhere  
Nowhere to lay his head  
Oh what can I tell you  
That you dont know already
