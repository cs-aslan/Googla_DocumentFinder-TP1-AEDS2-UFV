Drake  Verse 1  
I got car money fresh start money  
I want Saudi money I want art money  
I want women to cry and pour out their heart for me  
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me  
Yeh and lately I do bitches the meanest  
Tell em I love em and dont ever mean it  
We go on dates I send the Maybach out the neighbourhoods they never seen it  
That shit is dangerous but it so convenient  
I aint lying yeah  
And comfortable I sit

Cause honestly Im too fcking busy to drive stick  
I swear too fcking busy too busy fcking

Been hot before they open doors for me  
Preheated oven Im in this so  
But I aint finished though  
Its been a minute though  
My newest girl back home got issues with parents  
And some charges how the fck can I get her to Paris  
Luckilly Im the greatest my countrys ever seen  
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance  
Dreams money can buy

Cant tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it  
And I love the fact that line made em think about it  
Ymcmb these niggas make it so hard to be friendly when I know part of its
envy  
Tryna fill the shoes nigga so far these are empty  
I take em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi  
Ohh I never seen the car you claim to drive  
Shit I seen it you just aint inside  
And I feel like lately I went from top 5 to remaining 5  
My favourite rappers either lost it or they aint alive  
And they tryna bring us down me Weezy and Stunna  
We stayed up Christmas lights in the middle of summer  
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass  
Then Ill probably give her my number  
Yeah I throw my dollars up high  
And they land on the stage dance on  
We got company coming over  
Would it kill you to put some pants on  
Dreams money can buy  
They told me its like a high it wasnt a lie  
Yeah just have some good pssy waiting on a nigga  
And fck whoever hatin on a nigga
