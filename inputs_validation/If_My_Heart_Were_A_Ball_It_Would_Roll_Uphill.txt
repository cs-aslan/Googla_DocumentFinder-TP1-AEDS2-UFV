Did you ever fall in love  
Did you ever fall in love  
Did you ever fall in love  
Did you ever dream of falling  
  
If my heart were a ball  
It would roll uphill  
  
We are alone in the world  
We must do what we feel we should  
We are told what is right  
Need hurts within us  
We can see sense  
We can feel what feels right  
And so often  
All these things are not at all the same  
Theyre not at all the same  
  
If my heart were a ball  
It would roll uphill  
If my heart were a ball  
It would roll uphill  
  
Did you ever dream of running  
And find you couldnt move  
Did you ever dream of running  
Running scared  
Ankle deep in glue  
With the monster after you  
And its catching up  
Monsters catching up  
And its catchin up and youre going nowhere  
And youre slowin up And you cant wake up  
And its catchin up  
and youre going nowhere wake up wake up  
Youre falling  
  
If my heart were a ball  
It would roll uphill  
  
Did you ever see a shadow  
Cast against your bedroom wall  
Crooked shadow in the lamplight  
Ten feet tall  
Did you ever dream of falling  
And find you couldnt move  
Did you give up  
And discover that you havent given up  
Did you ever dream of falling  
Did you ever fall in love  
  
hard ball dream love now roll  
fall clown stain truth space time  
race give black white all one  
church state god fast as I could cry  
laugh hide feel no clouds will  
to win sweet seed you me  
hard ball dream love now roll  
fall clown stain truth space time  
never do that never do that  
will to win will to win never do that  
give black white all one wild  
church state now roll  
fall clown stain truth space time  
race fruit  
GIVE  
never do that  
If my heart were a ball it would roll uphill  
All one insane wild sweet heart  
Wild rose  
  
Did you ever fall in love
