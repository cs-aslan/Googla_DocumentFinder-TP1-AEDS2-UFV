Lets get loud lets get loud  
Turn the music up lets do it  
Cmon people lets get loud  
Lets get loud  
Turn the music up to hear that sound  
Lets get loud lets get loud  
Aint nobody gotta tell ya

If you want to live your life

You gotta do it you gotta do it your way

Lets get loud lets get loud  
Turn the music up to hear that sound  
Lets get loud lets get loud  
Aint nobody gotta tell ya

Life is meant to be big fun  
Youre not hurting anyone  
Nobody loses  
Let the music make you free  
Be what you want to be  
Make no excuses  
You gotta do it you gotta do it your way  
You gotta prove it  
You gotta mean what you say  
You gotta do it you gotta do it your way  
You gotta prove it  
You gotta mean what you say
