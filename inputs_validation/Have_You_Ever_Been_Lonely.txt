Have you ever been lonely have you ever been blue  
Have you ever loved someone just as I love you  
Cant you see Im sorry for each mistake Ive made  
Cant you see Ive changed dear cant you see Ive paid  
  
Be a little forgiving take me back in your heart  
How can I go on living now that were apart  
If you knew what Ive been through then youd know why I ask you  
Have you ever been lonely have you ever been blue  
  
If you knew what Ive been through
