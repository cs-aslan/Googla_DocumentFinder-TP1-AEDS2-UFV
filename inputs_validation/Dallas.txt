If you ever get the chance to go to Dallas  
Take it from me pass it by  
Cause youll only sing the blues down in Dallas  
Take it from me dont go and cry  
  
Chorus  
And Im leaving this town as soon as I can  
Gonna stop off for a while and see my woman  
  
People do you wrong down in Dallas  
I know well theyve done it to me  
Stealin all your bread theyre so callous  
I know well just look and see  
  
Chorus  
  
And people like me just cant be free  
The promo man wont let us us be  
If the people who knew could get away  
Im real sure theyd leave today  
  
Now come on down and lose your mental balance  
Look at me half crazy now  
Talkin to chairs strange and I know it  
Look at me Im doin in now
