Verse  
This whiskey got me feelin pretty  
So pardon if Im impolite  
I just really need your ass with me  
Im sorry bout the other night  
And I know I could be more creative  
And come up with poetic lines  
But Im turnt up off sizz and I love you  
Is the only thing thats in my mind  
  
Chorus  
You take me higher higher than Ive ever been babe  
Just come over lets pour a drink babe  
I hope I aint calling you too late too late  
You light my fire  
Lets stay up late and smoke a J  
I wanna go back to the old ways  
But Im drunk and still with a full ash tray  
With a little bit too much to say
