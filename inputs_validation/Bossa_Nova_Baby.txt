I said Take it easy baby  
I worked all day and my feet feel just like lead  
You got my shirt tails  
Flyin all over the place  
And the sweat poppin out of my head  
  
She said Hey Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on a workin child  
This aint no time to quit  
She said Go Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on dancin  
Im about to have myself a fit  
Bossa Nova Bossa Nova  
  
I said Hey little mama  
Lets sit down  
Have a drink and dig the band  
  
She said Drink drink drink  
Oh fiddlededink  
I can dance with a drink in my hand  
She said Hey Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on workin child  
This aint no time to drink  
She said Go Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on dancin  
Cause I aint got time to think  
  
I said Come on baby  
Its hot in here  
And its ohso cool outside  
If you lend me a dollar  
I can buy some gas  
And we can go for a little ride  
  
She said Hey Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on workin child  
I aint got time for that  
She said Go Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on dancin  
Or Ill find myself another cat
