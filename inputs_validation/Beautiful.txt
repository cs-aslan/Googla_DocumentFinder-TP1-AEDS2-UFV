Youve got to get up every morning  
With a smile on your face  
And show the world  
All the love in your heart  
Then people gonna treat you better  
Youre gonna find yes you will  
That youre beautiful as you feel  
  
Waiting at the station with the workday wind a blowin  
Ive got nothing to do but watch the passers by  
Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing  
And they dont see it showing Why do i  
  
Chorus  
  
I have often asked myself  
The reason for the sadness  
In a world where tears are just a lullaby  
And if theres any answer  
Maybe love can end the madness  
Maybe not oh but we can only try  
  
chorus out
