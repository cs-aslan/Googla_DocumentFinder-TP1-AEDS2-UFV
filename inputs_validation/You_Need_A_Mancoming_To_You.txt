I met myself a woman down in Memphis  
She sat down and talked to me  
When I asked her to reply  
She looked in my eye and I said  
Woman I know what you need  
You need a man  
One whos long enough to last  
And he likes to take it slow and easy  
You need a man  
One with lovin on his mind and  
All he wants to do is baby now please  
  
She said Whoa youre just a little bit crazed  
You dont know what youre talkin about  
I said Now listen little girl  
Ill give a two pound pearl  
If you only let me help you find out that  
You need a man one whos long enough to last  
And likes to take it slow and easy  
You need a man  
One with lovin on his mind  
And all he wants to do is please  
  
Now I was sittin in a little speakeasy  
When I came across that delta girl  
She said I hope you understand  
As she opened up the hand  
Now she said Honey you can keep the pearl  
Cause you are the man  
One whos long enough to last  
And likes to take it slow and easy  
You are the man  
  
One with lovin on his mind and  
All he wants to do is please  
  
Everyday seems a little brighter  
Every load feels a little lighter  
When I know Im coming to you  
  
When every road seems a little longer  
With every mile I grow a little stronger  
When I know Im coming to you  
  
You know I barely got enough money to buy the morning  
news  
I aint seen a dollar since I last paid my union dues  
But with love youre never without  
and there aint no reason to doubt  
Oh there aint no reasonno reason to doubt  
  
Always get a little lonely when Im away from you  
I end up feeling sorry for the pain I put you through  
But with love youre never without and there aint no  
reason to doubt  
Oh there aint no reason no reason to doubt  
  
Everyday seems a little brighter  
Every load feels a little lighter  
When I know Im coming to you  
  
When every road seems a little longer  
With every mile I grow a little stronger  
When I know Im coming to you  
When I know Im coming to you
