Sometimes I feel wherever I go I leave no mans land behind  
And God is a pet and the devils a toy and Im a danger in your paradise  
Here I go  
Here I go  
Sometimes I feel wherever I go I leave crimson roses behind  
With a toy in my hand and a pet at my side I spread roses  
Roses in your paradise  
  
Here I go with a toy in my hand and a pet at my side here I go  
Here I go Im a danger in your paradise  
  
And life is a pretty impolite bastard  
I spit at you I spit at you I spit at you bastard  
I want to cut out your chameleon tongue  
Im a danger in your paradise  
  
Here I go  
  
Sometimes I feel wherever I go I leave crimson roses behind  
With a toy in my hand and a pet at my side  
I spread roses roses in your paradise  
And life is a pretty pretty gigolo  
I caress you I caress you gigolo  
And God is a pet and the devils a toy  
And Im a danger in your paradise
