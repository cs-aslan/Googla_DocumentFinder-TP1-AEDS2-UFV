I can tell by the look thats in your eyes  
And Im not surprised  
You got to move on like the sun got to rise  
Im just holdin you down  
  
Bridge  
But the universe is calling you  
You are one of chosen fews  
You got to pay your dues  
  
Me and the baby gonna miss you  
I see your smile in her face  
I only wish we were with you now  
Its a lonely lonely place  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
Hey packd my bags put em at the door  
Hey packd my bags put em at the door  
Hey packd my bags put em at the door  
  
I know youll make it  
You deserve it you know you do  
The blues youll shake it  
Ill Ill focus our view  
  
Oh dont let them change you  
Come like thieves in the night  
Oh dont let them rearrage you boy  
Youve got to do whats right  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
Once a month each time you say  
Goin away oh  
I dont wanna see you go  
No no no no no no no no no no  
  
Oh you youve got to make it  
Youve got to make it boy  
Go on now
