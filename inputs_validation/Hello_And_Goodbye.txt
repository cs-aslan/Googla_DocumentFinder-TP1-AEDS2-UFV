Hello and goodbye  
I just unemployed you  
You can go back to school  
Youve had a good run  
Im sure he enjoyed you  
Dont act sad or surprised  
Lets be friends civilized  
  
Come on little one  
Dont sit there like a dummy  
The day you knew would arrive  
Is here youll survive  
So move funny face  
  
I like your conversation  
Youve a catchy turn of phrase  
Youre obviously going through  
Some adolescent phase  
  
So what happens now  
So what happens now  
Where am I going to  
  
Youll get by  
You always have before  
  
Where am I going to  
  
Dont ask anymore
