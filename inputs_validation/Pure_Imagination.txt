In a world of pure imagination  
Take a look and youll see  
Into your imagination

Simply look around and view it  
Anything you want to do it  
Want to change the world

Pure imagination  
Living there youll be free

If you want to see magic land  
Close your eyes and you will see one  
Want to be a dreamer be one  
Anytime you please  
And please save me one

In a world of pure imagination  
Take a look and youll see  
Into your imagination  
  
There is no place to go  
To compare with your imagination  
So go there to be free  
If you truly wish to be  
  
Living there youll be free  
If you truly wish to be
