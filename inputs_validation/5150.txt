The love line is never straight and narrow  
Unless your love is tried and true  
We take a chance with new beginnings  
Still we try win or lose  
Take the highs with the blues  
  
Always one more  
Youre never satisfied  
Share one for all with you  
Its only one for me  
Ah why draw the line  
And meet you half the way  
And you dont know  
What the means oh yeah  
  
I feel like a runnning politician oh  
Just trying to please you all the time  
Ive given you myself with no conditions  
Going wide running long  
Feeling lost but not for long  
  
Always one more  
Youre never satisfied  
Share one for all with you  
Its only one for me  
So why draw the line  
And meet you half the way  
When you dont know  
What that means oh yeah  
  
Solo  
Always one more  
Youre never satisfied  
Share one for all with you  
Its only one for me  
So why draw the line  
And meet you half the way  
When you dont know  
What that means  
  
Ill meet you half the way  
Whoa yeah  
Ill meet you half the way  
Whoa yeah
