Whats wrong with this picture  
Her eyes are like moons  
Its just like looking  
In two empty rooms  
Shes looking so fragile  
As thin as an eel  
Whats wrong with this picture  
What does it reveal  
Beauty speaks  
Theres so much to say  
Tell me whats wrong with this picture today  
  
Whats wrong with this picture  
Shes lighter than air  
Life seems to be happening  
But she is not there  
The late night temptation  
The eyes on her skin  
Whats wrong with this picture  
Theres nobody in  
  
Whats wrong with this picture  
Location withdrawn  
Its empty without you  
Your face so forlorn  
  
Shake yourself  
Sweep you head away  
Tell me whats wrong with this picture today
