Theres nothing left theres nothing right  
Theres nothing left theres nothing right  
Theres nothing left right left right  
Up down up down up down up down  
  
All right all right  
You wind me up you bring me down  
Your reputation is all over the town  
So long as you come home to me  
I aint complaining  
  
You fool around we scream and fight  
The way you are treating me you know it aint right  
But when you are making out with me  
I aint complaining  
  
All right all right  
Youre out all night you sleep all day  
When I get home youre going out to play  
Oh woman give me some time and everythings fine  
I aint complaining  
  
You just dont care we are in a Mess  
And the company you keep aint the best  
But when youre lying there with me  
I aint complaining  
  
It aint no use you playing it loose  
And thinking it dont matter to me  
It aint fair at all  
You only have to call my name  
And Ill come running to you  
  
But when the chips are down  
A man can only take so much fooling around  
And if you dont come home to me  
Ill be complaining  
  
All right  
Theres nothing left theres nothing right  
Our situation aint looking too bright  
Cause I have taken all Im Gonna take  
Without complaining  
  
It aint no use playing it loose  
And thinking it dont matter to me  
It aint fair at all  
You only have to call my name  
And Ill come running to you  
  
But when the chips are down  
A man can only take so much fooling around  
And if I dont come home to you  
Youll be complaining  
  
All right all right all right all right  
All right all right
