A terrible signal  
Too weak to even recognize  
A gentle collapsing  
The removal of the insides  
  
Im touched by your pleas  
I value these moments  
Were order than we realize  
in someones eyes  
  
A frequent returning  
And leaving unnoticed  
A condition of mercy  
A change in the weather  
  
A view to remember  
The center is missing  
They question how the future lies  
in someones eyes  
The gentle collapsing  
Of every surface  
We travel on the quiet road  
the overload
