All the obstacles in my way now  
Are disappearing every day now  
Im getting closer  
Were getting closer to home  
It wont be long until the summer comes  
  
Are you gonna wait forever  
Are you gonna wait forever  
  
Getting out from under my bed now  
Im going to say the things I should have said now  
Getting closer  
Getting closer to whats true  
Gonna find myself in you  
  
Are you gonna wait forever  
Are you gonna wait forever  
Are you gonna wait forever  
Are you gonna wait forever  
  
Theres no one there behind their eyes  
Theyre in the business beautiful lies  
Well keep the promise  
Cause we dont know how to break it  
The furniture you can rearrange  
Dont trade your dreams for some small change  
Guard the flame or better leave it naked  
  
Are you gonna wait forever  
Are you gonna wait forever  
Are you gonna wait forever  
How  
  
Are you gonna wait forever  
How how long how long  
Or is it now now now  
Or is it now
