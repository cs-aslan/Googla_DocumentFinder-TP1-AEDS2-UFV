Im twelve oclock  
All daylight hours  
Ill warm your bed  
Ill grow your flowers  
Like Im a miniature sun  
This ball ignited when she told me I was her only one  
  
Im not the same now  
Im not that plain little boy  
Im all aflame now  
Im king up here like a miniature sun  
  
No life comes close  
Im rising higher  
On holiday  
On ball of fire  
You made a miniature sun  
Theres no more shadows in this world she says Im her only one  
  
Im not the same now  
Im not that plain little boy  
Im all aflame now  
I radiate like a miniature sun  
  
Now everything looks right today  
A billion watts of bright today  
And Im a blazing kite today  
I think Ill float around her house  
And tell her exactly how she makes me glow  
But then the other man leaving merely doffs his hat  
And Im the last to know  
  
Now everything looks wrong today  
An out of tune sung song today  
Ive grown from big King Kong today  
Right down to miniature  
  
Dont come too close  
Ill burn your arm  
Ill bleach your hair  
Dustbowl your farm  
Ill blind your eyes  
You blinded mine  
Ill spin with rage  
All summertime  
You made a miniature sun  
Just take a look up in the nightsky Im not the only one  
  
Im not the same now  
Im not that vain little boy that I was  
Im all to blame now  
Look out below here I come  
  
Man crashing down like a miniature sun
