Chorus  
Hey  
Get up  
Get loud  
Start pumpin up the party now  
Its the same old same old  
  
Its the same old same grind  
But we dont feel were wasting time  
Not so bored that we cant find a better way  
My friends my kind  
No ones gettin left behind  
If they did itd be a crime  
Thats why we say  
Let the music start a revolution  
No time to play it safe  
  
Chorus  
  
They cant  
We can  
Parents might not understand  
Having fun without a plan  
But thats what we do  
Were all here Lets go  
Gotta make this party grow  
Together we can make it blow  
Right through the roof  
The musics gonna start a revolution  
Too late to play it safe  
  
Chorus  
  
We dont have to paint by numbers  
Let our voice come out from under  
Hear it rise  
Feel the thunder  
Its time to lose control  
  
Chorus  
  
Pumpin up the party now  
Party now party now
