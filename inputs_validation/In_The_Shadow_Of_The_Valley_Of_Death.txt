We have no future  
Heaven wasnt made for me  
We burn ourselves to hell  
As fast as it can be  
And I wish that I could be the king  
Then Id know that I am not alone  
  
Maggots put on shirts  
Sell each other shit  
Sometimes I feel so worthless  
Sometimes I feel discarded  
I wish that I was good enough  
Then Id know that I am not alone  
  
Death is policeman  
Death is the priest  
Death is the stereo  
Death is a TV  
Death is the Tarot  
Death is an angel and  
Death is our God killing us all  
  
She put the seeds in me  
Plat this dying tree  
Shes a burning string  
And Im just the ashes  
She put the seeds in me  
Plat this dying tree  
Shes a burning string  
And Im just the ashes  
She put the seeds in me  
Plant this dying tree
