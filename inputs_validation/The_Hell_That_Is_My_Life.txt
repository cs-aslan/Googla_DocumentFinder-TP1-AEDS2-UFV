I  
I look but never touch  
She says I drink too much  
I only care about myself sex and the couch  
You  
You light up my whole day  
Whenever youre away  
Id love to say Ive got you figured out No way  
  
If I get my hands on you I would make you do all the things I want you to  
And bend your will to mine never hear you whine  
Everybody break out its enough to shout its enough to shout its enough
yeah its enough  
  
Chorus  
Shes callin were brawlin  
This is the hell that is my life  
Im laughing shes crying  
This is the hell that is my hell that is my life  
  
I  
I feel the world revolves around me  
I take my one way street  
I only have one serious bone in my body  
You  
You say youre not amused  
You love to hate me too  
You claim you wish you never got my name tattooed  
  
Now you got your hands on me  
And you can make me be what you want me to be  
And slash away my will still youre my only thrill  
Everybody break out its enough to shout  
Its enough to shout its enough yeah its enough  
  
Chorus  
  
You  
You say youre not amused  
You love to hate me too  
And now you tell your friends were through and never screwed  
  
I can take you so much more  
And youve got so much more in store  
So when you say your mom dont like me I say that your moms a whore  
Then you call me selfish pig and something small turns into something big  
The more you shovel the more I dig  
The more you shovel and the more I dig  
  
She calls we talk I scream she cries  
This is the hell that is my life  
She calls we talk I laugh she tries  
This is the hell that is my  
  
Chorus
