How can you see into my eyes like open doors  
Leading you down into my core  
Where Ive become so numb without a soul  
My spirits sleeping somewhere cold  
Until you find it there and lead it back home  
  
Wake me up wake me up inside I cant wake up  
Wake me up inside save me  
Call my name and save me from the dark wake me up  
Bid my blood to run I cant wake up  
Before I come undone save me  
Save me from the nothing Ive become  
  
Now that I know what Im without  
You cant just leave me  
Breathe into me and make me real bring me to life  
  
Wake me up wake me up inside I cant wake up  
Wake me up inside save me  
Call my name and save me from the dark wake me up  
Bid my blood to run I cant wake up  
Before I come undone save me  
Save me from the nothing Ive become  
  
Bring me to life Ive been living a lie  
Theres nothing inside bring me to life  
  
Frozen inside without your touch  
Without your love darling  
Only you are the life among the dead  
  
All this time I cant believe I couldnt see  
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me  
  
Ive been sleeping a thousand years it seems  
Ive got to open my eyes to everything  
  
Without a thought without a voice without a soul  
  
Dont let me die here  
There must be something wrong bring me to life  
  
Wake me up wake me up inside I cant wake up  
Wake me up inside save me  
Call my name and save me from the dark wake me up  
Bid my blood to run I cant wake up  
Before I come undone save me  
Save me from the nothing Ive become  
  
Bring me to life Ive been living a lie theres nothing inside  
Bring me to life
