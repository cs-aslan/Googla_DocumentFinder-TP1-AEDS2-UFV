Death by chocolate is myth  
This I know because I lived  
Ive been around for broken hearts and how  
Lay your head in my hands little girl  
This is only right now  
  
Death by crying doesnt exist though  
The headaches feel a bit like it  
You might explode  
But you reach the end of the road  
And you little tree  
Im certain you will grow  
  
Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn  
Just how to love again  
Oh my weeping willow  
Let your leaves fall and return  
Oh darling the seasons are your friend  
  
Death by anger this is true  
Just let him go he cant hurt you  
Oh little girl this is such a cruel cruel world  
This is the first of a million broken hearts  
  
Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn  
Just how to love again  
Oh my weeping willow  
Let your leaves fall and return  
Oh darling the seasons are your friend  
  
Oh it wont be long you will grow strong  
Up up and away  
  
Hes but a falling leaf hes but a falling leaf hes but a falling leaf
