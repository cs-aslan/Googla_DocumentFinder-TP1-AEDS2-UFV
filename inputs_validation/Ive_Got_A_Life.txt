Turn it down so I can tear it  
Turn it up so I can see it  
Its just useless to ignore  
Were goin down you dont feel it  
Turn it around you dont mean it  
And I cant stand it anymore  
When the whole world sighs  
And its makin you so deflated  
Ive got a life though it refuses to shine  
Ive got a life it aint over it aint over  
Ive got a way its the only thing thats mine  
All Im asking for is tenderness a little tenderness tenderness  
Ooh its a cruel place you never asked to be here  
Nobody cares and no ones gonna help you now oh no  
Its dog eat dog the human race  
The only thing theyll do is hate you hate you  
Such a crime to be unkind  
You turn your cheek pretend youre blind  
Ive got a life though it refuses to shine  
Ive got a life it aint over it aint over  
Ive got a way its the only thing thats mine  
All Im asking for is tenderness tenderness  
Ive got a life though it refuses to shine  
Ive got a life it aint over it aint over  
Ive got a way its the only thing thats mine  
All Im asking for is tenderness a little tenderness  
Be strong now baby oh  
Gotta be strong now baby  
Gotta be strong now baby  
Oh gotta be strong  
Strong now baby oh  
Gotta be strong now baby  
Gotta be strong now baby  
Oh gotta be strong
