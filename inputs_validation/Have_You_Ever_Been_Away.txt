Your fight them on the beaches speeches make me despair  
Cause if theres one thing we can guarantee is you will not he there  
Tidying your room making up your bed  
And if your diarys full that week youll send us lot instead  
  
Send us lot instead put a poppy by my lovers bed  
We believe you when you say youve hurt your back  
  
Have you ever been away  
Where were you when we took Calais  
You don t know you dont care  
You re just glad that you wasnt there  
Have you ever been away  
  
Im afraid your Rule Britannia mania doesnt ring so true  
If I was captain of the waves Id turn the gun on you  
Any last requests before you join dead  
Ill crap into your Union Jack and wrap it round your head  
  
Wrap it round your head take a look at all the blood weve shed  
Well believe you when you say it was worth it  
  
Liberate the streets of Europe give our kids a chance  
Give them Beaujolais by tap and cheap day trips to France  
But you have never seen or smelt this ungodly death  
Its like the stench of roasted lamb upon your fathers breath
