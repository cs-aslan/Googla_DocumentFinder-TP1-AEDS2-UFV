You said youd never be caught dead  
Listening to people sing with hats on their heads  
Well my how times have changed  
Did you get tired of heavy metal and chains  
  
Come breathe the cool mountain air  
Yeah take a look at our pretty girls on display  
Yeah buy a hat no you wont look like a fool  
Cause countrys hot and countrys cool  
  
Come on over to the country  
I think youll like it here just fine  
Come on over to the country  
Well try to soothe your rattled mind  
  
Come on over to the country  
Listen to our people sing  
Come on over to the country  
You might find were to your liking  
  
Dont matter if youre in New York or L A  
Well take you to Montana from the freeway  
Come ride with us down the radio way  
Were here 24 hours a day  
  
Yeah my girl used to be a rock and roll queen  
That was until the night she heard Bocephus sing  
She married me and she moved to the country  
Why she even had cow poo on her jeans ooh  
  
Come on over to the country  
I think youll like ti here just fine  
Come on over to the country  
Well try to soothe your rattled mind  
  
Come on over to the country  
Do you ever hear old Hank sing  
Come on over to the country  
You might find were to your liking  
  
Come on over to the country  
You might find were to your liking
