Im gonna buy a Paper Doll that I can call my own  
A doll that other fellows cannot steal  
And then the flirty flirty guys with their flirty flirty eyes  
Will have to flirt with dollies that are real  
  
When I come home at night she will be waiting  
Shell be the truest doll in all this world  
Id rather have a Paper Doll to call my own  
Than have a fickleminded real live girl  
  
I guess I had a million dolls or more  
I guess Ive played the doll game oer and oer  
I just quarrelled with Sue thats why Im blue  
Shes gone away and left me just like all dolls do  
  
Ill tell you boy its tough to be alone  
And its tough to love a gal thats not your own  
Im through with all of them  
Ill never fall again  
Say boy whatcha gonna do
