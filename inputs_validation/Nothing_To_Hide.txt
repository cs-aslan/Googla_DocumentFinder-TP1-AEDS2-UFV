There in my darkest hour somehow you knew what I felt  
And just in the nick of time you saved me from myself  
Didnt know I could cut through my defenses  
And see through the mask  
I figured you must want something from me but you never asked  
I just had to call and you were always there  
I think you must have been the answer to my prayer  
  
With you Ive got nothing to hide  
My heart is starting to pound  
Now the walls are tumbling down  
  
I wish I could find the words that linger just out of reach  
I see myself in your eyes and lose my power of speech  
I am someone now that I dont recognize  
It took someone like you to shatter my disguise  
  
Now Ive got nothing to hide  
My hearts remembering to pound  
I can feel the walls coming down  
Ive got nothing to hide  
All that I needed was you around  
Now the walls are tumbling down  
  
Head in the sky feeling just like some kind of lovesick child  
I finally pulled through and I owe it to you dont want to keep it inside  
  
I am someone now that I dont recognize  
Oh Im healing Im believing you made me realize
