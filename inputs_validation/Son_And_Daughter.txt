I want you woman  
Tried to be a son and daughter rolled into one  
You said youd equal any man for having your fun  
Ooh now didnt you feel surprised to find  
The cap just didnt fit   
The world expects a man  
To buckle down and shovel shit  
Whatll you do for loving  
When its only just begun   
I want you to be a woman  
  
Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men  
An equal people preacher  
Will you lead us all the same   
Ooh well I travelled around the world  
And found a brand new word for day  
Ooh watching the time mustnt linger behind  
Pardon me I have to get away  
Whatll you think of heaven  
If its back from where you came  
I want you to be a woman  
I want you to be a woman  
Yeah  
Gotta save the world  
Ooh Ive just begun  
Alright
