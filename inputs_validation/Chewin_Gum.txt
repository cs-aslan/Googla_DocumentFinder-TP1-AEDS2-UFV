I dont like steaks or fancy cake  
Im cool to ice cream too  
I have just one obsession  
I really love to chew  
  
Lollipop and chocolate drop  
Have no effect on me  
But when I have some chewin gum  
Im happy as can be  
  
My mama gave me a penny  
To buy some candy  
I didnt want the candy  
So I bought some chewin gum  
Oh yum yum yum  
I love my gum  
  
My mama gave me a nickle  
To buy a pickle  
I didnt want a pickle  
So I bought some chewin gum  
Oh yum yum yum  
I bought some gum  
  
Each time I find myself with a dime  
I hurry to the store  
Cause the boy who sells me chewin gum  
Is the one that I adore  
  
My mama gave me a quarter  
For soda water  
I know I had an order  
But I bought some chewin gum  
A great big steak  
Is good for some  
But as for me Im happy  
When Im chewin chewin gum  
  
Each time I find myself with a dime  
I hurry to the store  
For the boy who sells me chewin gum  
Is the one that I adore  
  
My mama gave me a quarter  
For soda water  
I know I had an order  
But I bought some chewin gum  
A great big steak  
Is good for some  
But as for me Im happy  
When Im chewin chewin chewin gum
