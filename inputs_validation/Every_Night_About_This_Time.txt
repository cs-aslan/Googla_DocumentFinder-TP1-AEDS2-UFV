Every night about this time  
Oh how I miss you  
I drift into our old rendezvous  
Every night about this time  
The gang keeps on askin why youre not around  
And I keep pretendin that youre just out of town  
Every night about this time  
Memories haunt me  
Wondering too whos dancing with you  
Every night about this time  
And whenever they croon our favorite tune  
A tear falls with every rhyme  
Oh how I miss you  
Every night about this time  
Every night about this time  
Memories haunt me  
Wondering too whos dancing with you  
Every night about this time  
And whenever they croon our favorite tune  
A tear falls with every rhyme  
Oh how I miss you  
Every night about this time
