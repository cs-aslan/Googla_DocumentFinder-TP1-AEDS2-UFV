Living easy living free  
Season ticket on a oneway ride  
Asking nothing leave me be  
Taking everything in my stride  
Dont need reason dont need rhyme  
Aint nothing I would rather do  
Going down party time  
My friends are gonna be there too  
Im on the highway to hell  
No stop signs speed limit  
Nobodys gonna slow me down  
Like a wheel gonna spin it  
Nobodys gonna mess me round  
Hey satan payed my dues  
Playing in a rocking band  
Hey momma look at me  
Im on my way to the promised land  
Im on the highway to hell  
dont stop me  
And Im going down all the way down  
Im on the highway to hell
