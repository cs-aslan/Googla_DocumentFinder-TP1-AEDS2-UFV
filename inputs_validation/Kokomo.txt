Aruba Jamaica ooh I want to take ya  
Bermuda Bahama come on pretty mama  
Key Largo Montego baby why dont we go Jamaica  
  
Off the Florida Keys theres a place called Kokomo  
Thats where you want to go to get away from it all  
Bodies in the sand tropical drink melting in your hand  
Well be falling in love to the rhythm of a steel drum band  
Down in Kokomo  
  
Chorus  
Aruba Jamaica ooh I want to take you to  
Bermuda Bahama come on pretty mama  
Key Largo Montego baby why dont we go  
Ooh I want to take you down to  
Kokomo well get there fast and then well take it slow  
Thats where we want to go way down in Kokomo  
  
Martinique that Montserrat mystique  
  
Well put out to sea and well perfect our chemistry  
And by and by well defy a little bit of gravity  
Afternoon delight cocktails and moonlit nights  
That dreamy look in your eye give me a tropical contact high  
Way down in Kokomo  
  
Chorus  
  
Port au Prince I want to catch a glimpse  
  
Everybody knows a little place like Kokomo  
Now if you want to go and get away from it all  
Go down to Kokomo  
  
Chorus  
Aruba Jamaica ooh I want to take you to  
Bermuda Bahama come on pretty mama  
Key Largo Montego baby why dont we go  
Ooh I want to take you down to
