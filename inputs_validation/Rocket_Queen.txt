If I say I dont need anyone  
I can say these things to you  
Cause I can turn on anyone  
Just like Ive turned on you  
Ive got a tongue like a razor  
A sweet switchblade knife  
And I can do you favors  
But then youll do whatever I like  
  
Chorus  
Here I am  
And youre a Rocket Queen  
I might be a little young  
But honey I aint naive  
Here I am  
And youre a Rocket Queen oh yeah  
I might be too much  
But honey youre a bit obscene  
  
Ive seen everything imaginable  
Pass before these eyes  
Ive had everything thats tangible  
Honey youd be surprised  
Im a sexual innuendo  
In this burned out paradise  
If you turn me on to anything  
You better turn me on tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
I see you standin  
Standin on your own  
Its such a lonely place for you  
For you to be  
If you need a shoulder  
Or if you need a friend  
Ill be here standing  
Until the bitter end  
No one needs the sorrow  
No one needs the pain  
I hate to see you  
Walking out there  
Out in the rain  
So dont chastise me  
Or think I I mean you harm  
Of those that take you  
Leave you strung out  
Much too far  
Babyyeah  
  
Dont ever leave me  
Say youll always be there  
All I ever wanted  
Was for you  
To know that I care
