Come to me  
While Im sleeping  
So their wagging tongues  
Might not find you my love  
  
All the while  
They lie down  
Our lighter souls fuse  
Fly and dive my love  
  
So stamp this night so strong  
That I will remember  
And have it ever after  
  
Come to me  
In my dreaming  
So their wagging tongues  
Might not find you my love  
  
Round the corner  
Back of hands  
Theyll still be talking  
Whether or not wed ever  
Whether wed ever my love
