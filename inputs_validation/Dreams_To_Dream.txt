I lose my way  
No one cares  
The words I say  
No one hears  
My life it seems is a world of dreams  
Deep in the night  
Youll find me  
Dream and youre right behind me  
Stayif you will stay  
Well dream the night away  
Dreams to dream  
In the dark of the night  
When the world goes round  
I can still make it right  
I can see so far in my dreams  
Ill follow my dreams until they come true  
There is a star  
Waiting to guide us  
Shining inside us  
When we close our eyes  
Come with me  
You will see what I mean  
Theres a world insight  
No one else ever sees  
You will go so far in my dreams  
Somewhere in my dreams  
Your dreams will come true  
Dont let go  
If you stay close to me  
In my dreams tonight  
You will see what I see  
Dreams to dream  
As near as can be  
Inside you and me  
Will always come true  
Inside you and me  
That always come true
