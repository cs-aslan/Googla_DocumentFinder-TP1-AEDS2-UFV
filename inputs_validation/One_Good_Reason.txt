Gimme one good reason why I should listen to you  
I need one good reason why I should do  
What you want me to  
Gimme some air or I cant breathe  
I cant see so I cant believe  
Show me just a little more  
Oh oh gimme one  
  
Gimme one good reason why I should listen to you  
I need one good reason why I should do  
What you want me to  
Under your thumb aint no place to hide  
I cant choose and I cant decide  
Gotta be a better way  
Oh oh gimme one  
  
I keep making the same mistake  
No win no lose no give and no take  
Im just playing a simple game  
And I dont wanna ask you again and again  
  
For one good reason why I should listen to you  
Just one good reason why I should do  
What you want me to  
Under your spell aint no place to be  
Dont mess around with a fool like me  
Help me just a little more  
Oh oh gimme one gimme one  
  
Well I keep making the same mistake  
No win no lose no give and no take  
And Im just playing a simple game  
And I dont wanna ask you again and again  
  
For one good reason why I should listen to you  
Just one good reason why I should do  
What you want me to  
Pull on the string you hold in your hand  
Making me jump like a one man band  
Gotta be a better way  
Oh oh gimme one
