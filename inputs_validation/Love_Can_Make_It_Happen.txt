You cant save the entire world  
By walking around knocking on every door  
Oh no  
And you cant sell empty promises  
Cause folks these days just aint buying  
No more  
Everybody knows the score  
But theres something you can do  
When Jesus opens the door for you  
Just let His light come shining through  
  
What can heal a dying world  
Love can make it happen  
Theres no end to what His love can do  
What can turn His light on in the dark  
Love can make it happen  
Open up and let His love flow through  
  
Maybe we could save the entire world  
If we pick up love and put religious  
Weapons down  
Cause sometimes we get so wrapped up in  
Tradition restriction divisions  
They abound  
Is there any love to be found  
We can save a dying world today  
If we humble ourselves and pray  
We can make a way  
  
What can heal a dying world  
Love can make it happen  
Theres no end to what His love can do  
What can turn His light on in the dark  
Love can make it happen  
Open up and let His love flow through
