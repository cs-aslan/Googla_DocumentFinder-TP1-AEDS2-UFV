Chorus  
Once I live a life of a millionaire  
Still do  
Spending my money honey ohh I didnt care  
Still dont  
  
Verse 1  
Im a floss til I die ball never fall  
Cop til I drop Motherfuck em all  
Count paper schemin leanin on the wall  
Money comin fast niggas ridin balls  
I been to hell and back I seen what you saw  
6 in the mornin Ds at the door  
I was a shorty on a bike hangin with Alpo  
I was a shorty uptown with Rich Porter  
I was a shorty up on 1 3 2  
My man az he really schooled me  
My man Big Chuck he took me to Mt V  
I messed up the count Kev winked at me  
What I learned is niggas need paper to burn  
And you gotta spread love when cats is fucked up  
You cant be lazy for niggas thats bad fuck  
Sometimes you move quiet and lay upin the cut whattup  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 2  
I learned if you talk to much you get that ass shot up  
Follow your dreams and watch the cash pile up  
I used to be in Queens with my man Black Just  
Before he got killed now that nigga was real  
He took me to the crib showed me how gangsters live  
Took me to hot blocks showed me big knots  
Him and Richard Porter used to tease me and what not  
You aint movin pies so your car can be fly  
Used to run to Big Kev before he got knocked  
When niggas was stuntin and wouldnt let me on the block  
125th in the Beemer with az  
He gave a bum 50 dollars that really taught me  
That being a gangster dont mean youre all bad  
And niggas respect you when they know you got cash  
Remember Big dave had the dust on smash  
I was amazed the lifestyle was so fast  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
I remember Remy showed my his first 8th ki  
That was before Queens had blood in the street  
Stretch from bk had the pretty gold Benz  
He took me out to Brooklyn where he was gettin some ends  
Let me state this again I aint gotta pretend  
They was playing the money game and I wanted in  
I was just a young boy with dangerous friends  
If it wasnt for rap who knows where I wouldve been  
I took a hustlas heart to make the top of the charts  
Big Chuck when to jail when I was ready to start  
I guess I was destin God pulled us apart  
But I admit getting that street money is a art  
I was so many players I knew back in the D  
Like Cuban Alberto from Miami  
86 that niggas Benz had tvs  
Only God knows what these niggas mean to me  
Real talk  
  
Chorus
