It could spell my mere defeat  
You could find its what you need  
And tears will fall and oceans will rise  
I feel the fear and I know Im alive  
And you can touch me  
I wont hide  
You can touch me  
I wont die  
My condition is hard to define  
Im thin and pale and I need to unwind  
See no future from where I stand  
For the present I am in your hands  
And you can touch me  
I wont hide  
You can touch me  
I wont die  
And tears will fall and oceans will rise  
I feel the fear and I know Im alive  
It is only passing through  
And you can touch me  
I wont hide  
You can touch me  
I wont die  
You can touch me  
I wont die
