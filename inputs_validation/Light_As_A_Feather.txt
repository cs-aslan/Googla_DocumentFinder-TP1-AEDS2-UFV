While love seasons will undo your soul  
Time forgives us and it takes control  
We separate our things to put us back together  
  
Were light as a feather  
Heavy as the weather  
If it was rainstorms  
  
Put our hands together to plough obey  
Its like a show was over  
But were too scared to walk away  
All for the better  
Worst for the way  
  
Were light as a feather  
Got you and I together  
  
Meanwhile inside of me it was rainin storms hm  
You didnt know hm  
God bless your soul  
  
Were light as a feather  
Heavy as the weather  
Were light as a feather  
Got you and I together
