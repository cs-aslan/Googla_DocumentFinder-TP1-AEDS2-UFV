Red wine Konvict Gaga oh yeah  
  
Ive had a little bit too much  much oh oh woah  
All of the people start to rush start to rush by  
How does she twist the dance  
Cant find my drink or man  
Where are my keys I lost my phone  
Whats going on out on the floor  
I love this record baby but I cant see straight anymore  
Keep it cool whats the name of this club  
I cant remember but its alright alright  
  
Chorus  
Just dance gonna be OK

Howd I turn my shirt inside out Inside out right  
Control your poison babe  
Roses have thorns they say  
And were all gettin hosed tonight  
Whats going on on the floor  
I love this record baby but I cant see straight anymore  
Keep it cool whats the name of this club  
I cant remember but its alright alright  
  
Chorus  
  
When I come through on the dance floor checkin out that catalog  
Cant believe my eyes so many women without a flaw  
And I aint gonna give it up steady tryin to pick it up like the car
