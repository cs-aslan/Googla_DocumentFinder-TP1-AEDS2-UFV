Somethings come feel it down in my bones  
Yeah its been a long time gone but ya here tonight  
Now lets not look back ya keeping me right on track  
Feel the karma coming back were gonna be alright  
  
If everythings a constant battle sometimes you wont win  
If all our strengths turn into struggles we wont be giving in  
  
Well be living on an all time high  
Im trying to keep it  
Weve learnt to walk but now its time to run  
A change is gonna come  
Living on an all time high  
Im gonna live it  
First thought we couldnt but it can be done  
Change is gonna come  
  
Troubled times been a good friend of mine  
Yeah its been around a while keeping me down  
But through it all even with a broken soul  
Here I am standing tall cause youre around  
  
If everythings a constant battle sometimes you wont win  
If all our strengths turn into struggles we wont be giving in  
  
Well be living on an all time high  
Im trying to keep it  
Weve learnt to walk but now its time to run  
A change is gonna come  
Living on an all time high  
  
Im gonna live it  
First thought we couldnt but it can be done  
Change is gonna come  
  
For every sign that said wed never find the means to  
For every word they said they never heard that they knew  
Given time I want some piece of mind  
Same as you do  
Sing it  
  
Change is  
Coming  
You better be waiting  
You better be  
Ready  
Running  
Faster faster its coming  
  
Well be living on an all time high  
Im trying to keep it  
Weve learnt to walk but now its time to run  
A change is gonna come  
Living on an all time high  
Im trying to keep up  
Weve learnt to walk but now its time to run  
Change is gonna come  
  
Living on an all time high  
Im gonna live it  
First thought we couldnt but it can be done  
Change is gonna come  
  
Change is coming oh you better be running  
I see you ready I keep running  
Faster and faster its coming  
  
Change is coming oh you better be running  
I see you ready I keep running  
Faster and faster its coming
