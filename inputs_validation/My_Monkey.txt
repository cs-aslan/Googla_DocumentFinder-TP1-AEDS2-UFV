I had a little monkey I sent him to the country and I fed him on  
Ginger bread  
Along came a choo choo knoked my monkey coo coo and now my monkeys  
Dead  
At least he looks that way but then again dont we all  
What I make is what I am  
  
I cant be forever  
Make you break you make you break you lookout  
We are our own wicked gods with little gs and big dicks  
Sadistic and constantly inflicting a slow demise  
The primates scream of consonance is a reflection  
Of his own minds dissonance
