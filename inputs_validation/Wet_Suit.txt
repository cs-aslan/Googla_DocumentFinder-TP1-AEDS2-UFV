Roll the dice  
Now I wipe the tears from the skies  
Play your hand  
How I love my Marlboro man  
  
Say your prayers  
Cause youve got enemies everywhere  
Your wetsuit is keeping you warm  
In your cold bed Ill never be torn from you  
  
Try to keep it together  
You try your best to forget her  
Silly me always a sucker for monogamy  
Honesty seems to bring out the better in me  
  
Wish I knew another way to ruin the day for you  
Your wetsuit is keeping you warm  
In your cold bed Ill never be torn from you  
Try to keep it together  
  
You try your best to forget her  
I just cant leave you this way  
When youre not okay  
Trains will pass through here someday  
  
And take you away  
But you wont let me hit the ground  
When my heart slows down  
Your wetsuit is keeping you warm  
  
In your cold head Ill never be torn from you  
Try to keep it together  
You try to keep it together  
  
Keep us together ah  
Keep us together ah  
Keep us together ah  
Keep us together ah
