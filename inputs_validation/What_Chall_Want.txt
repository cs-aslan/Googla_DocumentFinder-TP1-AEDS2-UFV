Im blowin on a drag like Marley had  
The bitches that I bag be Barbie bad  
Not to exag  
The brains like a Harvard grad  
You cant rob him  
Unless you got a Carbon Mag  
Its not a problem  
Puttin you in a garbage bag  
Try to bob him  
Just like you Marvin Hagg  
You cant mob him  
Unless its for a autograph

5 grand to hush him  
Niggas talk the shit its my chance to flush him  
My fansll brush him  
My mansll rush him  
Imagine if I wouldve used my hands to touch him  
Who want it with I  
You run with the guy  
Thats like suicide you wanted to die  
Two gun if you lie  
Few done it like I  
Its three to look at the coupe its two hundred to buy  
Yeah Im big with the bittys  
Do it big in the city  
Without Jigga or Fitty  
Or Biggie or Diddy

Just figure they dritty  
Send sac with the forty made me way with the fitty  
Theyll be gunnin and buckin  
Youll be runnin and duckin  
Hopin none of em get ya

With the scope Im a split ya  
Send the pope to be with ya  
Still youll need doctors to open and stitch ya
