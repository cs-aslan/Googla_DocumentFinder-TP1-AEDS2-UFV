I cant hide no  
On the mantle  
Im not sad  
Tilling that hoe  
  
Its the season  
Im all reason  
I have seen  
All I have grown  
  
Sheared at the seams  
Cheat on me  
And not seen  
At the seams  
  
Im a lender  
Im a planter  
I put something  
In the garden  
  
In the handle  
On the mantle  
Im not Santa  
Im a god  
  
I want a lady  
Can you save me  
Its the sulfur  
I have grown  
  
Tis the season  
Im all reason  
I have fleas  
So run on home
