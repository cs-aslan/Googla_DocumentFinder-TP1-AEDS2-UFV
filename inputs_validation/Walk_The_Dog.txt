Are you tired of staying home and being lonely  
Walk the dog walk the dog  
Walk the dog walk the dog  
Would you like a way to meet your one and only  
Walk the dog walk the dog  
Walk the dog walk the dog  
Big dog little dog all you gotta do is walk the dog  
  
First you take a little stroll around the corner  
Walk the dog wroofwroof  
Walk the dog wroofwroof  
When she sees you walking by then shes a goner  
Walk the dog aarhwaarhw  
Walk the dog aarhwaarhw  
Big dog little dog all you gotta do is walk the dog  
  
Hot diggetydog the ice is broken  
Without a single word being spoken  
And if you play your cards just right  
You got yourself a date for Saturday night  
  
You can start to wear a smile of satisfaction  
Walk the dog walk the dog  
Walk the dog walk the dog  
Its the way to be the center of attraction  
Walk the dog walk the dog  
Walk the dog walk the dog  
Big dog little dog all you gotta do is walk the dog  
Dooog  
  
Hot diggetydog the ice is broken
