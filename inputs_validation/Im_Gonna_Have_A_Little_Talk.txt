Im gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
When I get home tonight  
Gonna tell him all about my troubles  
And I know hell make them right  
Then Ill ask him to forgive me  
For the things that Ive done wrong  
Gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
Tonight when I get home  
This world can be a struggle  
Just livin day to day  
Youll run into the devil  
With every step you take  
I seen his face a hundred times  
As he tried to lead me wrong  
He dont understand  
That I dont walk this road alone  
Im gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
When I get home tonight  
Gonna tell him all about my troubles  
And I know hell make them right  
Then Ill ask him to forgive me  
For the things that Ive done wrong  
Gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
Tonight when I get home  
Lord said I could call on him  
When ever I feel low  
Any time or place I needed him  
He would gladly go  
My life has not been perfect  
No matter how I try  
But hes never turned his back on me  
And thats the reason why  
Im gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
When I get home tonight  
Gonna tell him all about my troubles  
And I know hell make them right  
Then Ill ask him to forgive me  
For the things that Ive done wrong  
Gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
Tonight when I get home  
Im gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
When I get home tonight  
Gonna tell him all about my troubles  
And I know hell make them right  
Then Ill ask him to forgive me  
For the things that Ive done wrong  
Gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
Tonight when I get home  
Im Gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
Tonight when I get home
