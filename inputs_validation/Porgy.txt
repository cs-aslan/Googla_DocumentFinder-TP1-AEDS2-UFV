I love you Porgy  
Dont let him take me  
Dont let him handle me  
And drive me mad  
  
If you can keep me  
I want to stay with you forever  
And Ill be glad  
  
I love you Porgy  
Dont let him take me  
Dont let him handle me  
With his hot hands  
  
If you can keep me  
I want to stay with you forever  
I like my man  
  
Someday I know hes coming  
Back to call me  
Hes gonna handle me  
And hold me so  
  
Its going to be like dying Porgy  
When he calls me  
But when he comes I know  
Ill have to go
