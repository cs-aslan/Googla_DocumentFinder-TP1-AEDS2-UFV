Out in the street somebodys crying  
Out in the night the fires burn  
Maybe tonight somebodys crying  
Reached the point of no return  
  
Oh my eyes they see but I cant believe  
Oh my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave  
  
Like the eagle and the dove  
Fly so high on wings above  
When all you see can only bring you sadness  
Like a river we will flow  
On towards the sea we go  
When all you do can only bring you sadness  
Out on the sea of madness  
  
Somewhere I hear a voice thats calling  
Out in the dark there burns a dream  
You got to hope when you are falling  
To find the world that you have seen  
  
Oh my eyes they see but I cant believe  
Oh my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave  
  
Like the eagle and the dove  
Fly so high on wings above  
When all you see can only bring you sadness  
Like a river we will flow  
On towards the sea we go  
When all you do can only bring you sadness  
Out on the sea of madness  
  
Its madness  
The sun dont shine  
On the sea of madness  
There aint no wind to fill your sails  
Madness  
When all you see can only bring you sadness  
On towards the sea we go
