Wearin my high boots  
Got all my world lies here in a sack  
Looking for something  
Knowing that it aint here where Im at  
Aint looking back  
Im comin  
Ride by thumbin  
Get by bummin  
Im on my way  
  
Friend have you seen glory road  
Say friend I got a heavy load  
And I know glory roads waiting for me  
  
Caught me a pickup  
Down from Seattle through to LA  
Seems like those folks  
Go chasin a new star every day  
Aint gonna stay  
In Nevada through Wyomin  
Colorado Im on my way  
  
Friend have you seen glory road  
Say friend I got a heavy load  
And I know glory roads waiting for me  
  
Met so many others  
Wanted to know which way to go  
Louisiana New York City  
They wanted the answer  
Theyd ask of me  
Friend have you seen glory road  
Say friend I got a heavy load  
And I know glory roads waiting for me  
Rest my load  
Now I know glory road wont set me free
