If you play with fire youll get burned  
Its such a shame  
Even when you try youll never learn  
To tame the flames  
  
Like the demons eye  
Watching over me  
Relentlessly  
  
You have got no wings but you have always tried to fly  
Your soul is burning up like a fire in the sky  
Some say Ive been had and thats too bad  
I know theyre wrong  
Some say Ive gone mad and thats too sad  
Im much too strong  
  
Like the demons eye  
Watching over me  
Relentlessly  
  
You have got no wings but you have always tried to fly  
Your soul is burning up like a fire in the sky  
Youre not living what youre preaching and youre not a priest  
Youre not living you are leeching living like a beast  
  
I feel fine although you give me hell  
I dont mind  
Im your golden mine you know so well  
Let me shine  
  
Like the demons eye  
Watching over me  
Relentlessly  
  
You have got no wings but you have always tried to fly  
Your soul is burning up like a fire in the sky  
Youre not living what your preaching and youre not a priest  
Youre not living you are leeching living like a beast
