All the kings horses  
And all the kings men  
Aint got a hope in hell  
Of puttin my pieces back together again  
  
Ive seen things in my life that should never be seen  
Im talkin things thatd make your skin crawl  
I want to go back to a simpler time  
Where nothin really mattered at all  
  
You see I cant sleep all night long  
Tossin and aturnin  
thoughts they keep achurnin  
I cant sleep all night long  
As a matter of fact  
I just want to get back  
  
Chorus  
Back to the rockin horse  
Back to where it all began  
Take me backback to the rockin horse  
And start all over again  
  
My parents think Im crazy  
And the doctor says I cracked  
But they dont understand me  
Cause I just want to go back  
  
You see I cant sleep all night long  
Tossin and aturnin  
Thoughts they keep achurnin  
I cant sleep all night long  
As a matter of fact  
I just want to get back  
  
Chorus
