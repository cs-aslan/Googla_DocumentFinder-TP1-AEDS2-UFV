He left on a boat  
Just to follow a dream  
He had to find  
You cant hold a man  
When he follows a dream  
Thats on his mind  
I see a boat on the river  
Its sailing away  
Down to the ocean  
Where to I cant say  
Boat on the river  
Its sailing away  
Down to the ocean  
Where to I cant say  
I waited for him  
Such a very long time  
Dont know what for  
Cause I should have known  
When he left on the boat  
Well meet no more  
I see a boat on the river  
Its sailing away  
Down to the ocean  
Where to I cant say  
Boat on the river  
Its sailing away  
Down to the ocean  
Where to I cant say  
Boat on the river  
Its sailing away  
Down to the ocean  
Where to I cant say  
Boat on the river  
Youre bound for the sea  
If you should find him  
Please greet him from me  
There were people who came  
And said its really a shame  
Why did he take off  
To follow just a dream  
But I guess they were wrong  
In life youre sailing along  
And things dont turn out  
As simple as they seem  
Boat on the river  
Its sailing away  
Down to the ocean  
Where to I cant say  
I see a boat on the river  
Its sailing away  
Down to the ocean  
Where to I cant say  
I see a boat on the river  
Youre bound for the sea  
If you should find him  
Please greet him from me  
Boat on the river  
Its sailing away  
Down to
