As I stand by your flame  
I get burned once again  
Feelin low down Im blue  
  
As I sit by the fire  
Of your warm desire  
Ive got the blues for you yeah  
  
Every night youve been away  
Ive sat down and I have prayed  
That youre safe in the arms of a guy  
Who will bring you alive  
Wont drag you down with abuse  
  
In the silk sheet of time  
I will find peace of mind  
Love is a bed full of blues  
  
And Ive got the blues for you  
And Ive got the blues for you  
And Ill bust my brains out for you  
And Ill tear my hair out  
Im gonna tear my hair out just for you  
If you dont believe what Im singing  
At three oclock in the morning babe well  
Im singing my song for you
