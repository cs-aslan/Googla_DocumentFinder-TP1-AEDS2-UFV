You tell me what you think Im feelin you know why I do what I do  
Why should you listen to a word Im sayin when its already so clear to you  
You tell me bout my bad intentions you doubt the very things I hold true  
I can no longer live with your misconceptions baby all I can say to you is  
  
Chorus  
That aint love I believe youve got the wrong emotion  
That aint love at least it doesnt feel like love to me  
As long as I say what you want to hear  
Do what you want to do be who you want me to be  
You think thats love well baby that aint love to me  
  
Weve got to talk it over sometime these feelings wont just disappear  
Im just gonna keep telling you whats on my mind  
Even if its not what you want to hear  
Oooh right now your world and mine are such different places  
Through yours I wander lost and confused  
And I feel like Im speaking in a different language  
And the only words I havent used are  
  
Chorus  
  
You keep tellin me you know a place where your life would be better  
Youre makin plans longrange  
But I dont know how you expect to get there when you refuse to change  
  
Oooh baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh baby that aint love that aint lolololololove  
That aint love oh no baby that aint love that aint love  
That aint love that aint love that aint love oohoo
