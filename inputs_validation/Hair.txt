Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh whoa  
  
Whenever Im dressed cool  
My parents put up a fight  
Uh huh uh huh  
And if Im hot shot  
Mom will cut my hair at night  
Uh huh uh huh  
  
And in the morning  
Im short of my identity  
Uh huh uh huh  
I scream Mom and Dad  
Why cant I be who I wanna be  
Uh huh uh huh to be  
  
I just wanna be myself  
And I want you to love me for who I am  
I just wanna be myself  
And I want you to know I am my hair  
  
Chorus  
Ive had enough this is my prayer  
That Ill die living just as free as my hair  
Ive had enough this is my prayer  
That Ill die living just as free as my hair  
Ive had enough Im not a freak  
Im just here trying to stay cool on the streets  
Ive had enough enough enough  
And this is my prayer I swear  
Im as free as my hair  
Im as free as my hair  
I am my hair I am my hair  
  
Free as my hair hair hair  
Hair hair hahahahair  
Hair hair hair  
Hair hair hahahahair  
  
Free as my hair hair hair  
Hair hair hahahahair  
Hair hair hair  
Hair hair hahahahair  
  
Sometimes I waltz around  
Put on red highlights  
Just because I want my friends  
To think Im dynamite  
  
And on Friday rocks in  
High school dance  
I got my bangs too hot  
That I dont stand a chance a chance  
  
I just wanna be myself  
And I want you to love me for who I am  
I just wanna be myself  
And I want you to know I am my hair  
  
Chorus  
  
Free as my hair hair hair  
Hair hair hahahahair  
Hair hair hair  
Hair hair hahahahair  
  
Free as my hair hair hair  
Hair hair hahahahair  
Hair hair hair  
Hair hair hahahahair  
  
I just want to be free I just want to be me  
And I want lots of friends that invite me to their parties  
Dont wanna change and I dont wanna be ashamed  
Im the spirit of my hair its all the glory that I bare  
  
I am my hair I am my hair  
I am my hair I am my hair  
I am my hair I am my hair  
I am my hair I am my hair  
Its all the glory that I bare  
  
I am my hair I am my hair
