Roll of the dice  
Take a spin of the wheel  
Out of your hands now  
So how do you feel  
But youre not gonna win  
Youd better go back again  
  
Do you feel lucky  
Or do you feel scared  
Take what luck brings  
And be Devil may care  
But youre down on your luck  
What will the next day bring  
  
Adrift on the ocean  
Afloat in a daydream  
Or lost in a maze  
Or blind in the haze  
So what does it matter  
So why dont you answer  
So why did you send  
An angel to mend  
  
Best make decisions  
Before its too late  
Take all your chances  
Take hold of the reins  
A roll of the dice  
Ahead of the game again  
  
Nothing to lose  
But so much to gain  
A little danger  
It goes without saying  
But what do you care  
Youre gonna go in the end  
Gate open to heaven  
  
Is ready and waytnig  
Or straight down to hell  
Can go there as well  
  
Ill suffer my craving  
My souls not worth saving  
Sowhy dont you go  
Just leave well alone  
  
Dont you think Im a savior  
Dont you think I could save you  
Dont you think I could save your life  
  
Theres like a hunger  
That knocks on your door  
Youve had a taste of it  
Still you want more  
Youve made your mistakes  
Wont play it the same again  
  
You have been warned  
But still you plunge in  
You play high stakes  
But theres nothing to win  
Youve only one life  
And so many things to learn  
  
The Angel on one side  
The Devil the other  
Which path do you take  
Decisions to make  
  
Arrive at the crossroads  
You know where youre going  
And what if you wait  
It may be too late
