Packing my bags going away  
To a place where the air is clean  
On Saturn  
Theres no sense to sit and watch people die  
We dont fight our wars the way you do  
We put back all the things we use  
On Saturn  
Theres no sense to keep on doing such crimes  
  
Theres no principles in what you say  
No direction in the things you do  
For your world is soon to come to a close  
Through the ages all great men have taught  
Truth and happiness just cant be bought  or sold  
Tell me why are you people so cold  
  
Im  
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow  
Rainbow moonbeams and orange snow  
On Saturn  
People live to be two hundred and five  
Going back to Saturn where the people smile  
Dont need cars cause weve learned to fly  
On Saturn  
Just to live to us is our natural high  
  
We have come here many times before  
To find your strategy to peace is war  
Killing helpless men women and children  
That dont even know what theyre dying for  
We cant trust you when you take a stand  
With a gun and bible in your hand  
And the cold expression on your face  
Saying give us what we want or well destroy  
  
Im  
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow  
Rainbow moonbeams and orange snow  
On Saturn  
People live to be two hundred and five  
Going back to Saturn where the people smile  
Dont need cars cause weve learned to fly  
On Saturn  
Just to live to us is our natural high
