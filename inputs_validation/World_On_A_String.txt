I see the world on a string  
Its hanging from a wire  
It gets tangled up and spun around  
Like the truth inside a liar  
Sometimes you wanna get high  
And sometimes you run and hide  
Cause it eats you up and spits you out  
It swallows you alive  
  
Chorus  
When Im down on my knees  
And it hurts to believe Im bleeding  
Youll bring me back to life  
When theres no songs to sing  
And no flowers to bring no feeling  
And youll bring me back to life  
And youll bring me back to life  
  
I see the world on a beach  
Its sinking in the sand  
Oh it tries to suck you down with it  
You better get out while you can  
Sometimes you wanna scream out  
And sometimes you just cant  
Cause your lips  
Feel like theyre glued together  
And no one gives a damn  
  
Chorus  
  
This is the world on a string  
Theres no songs left to sing  
Just sing  
Sing  
  
I see the good  
I see the bad  
The revolution  
I see the happy  
I see the sad  
The absolution  
I see hate  
And I see love  
When the worlds on a string  
  
I see the good  
I see the bad  
The revolution  
I see the happy  
I see the sad  
The absolution  
I see hate  
And I see love  
When the worlds on a string  
  
Chorus  
  
When Im down on my knees  
And it hurts to believe Im bleeding  
Youll bring me back to life  
When theres no songs to sing  
And no flowers to bring No feeling  
And youll bring me back to life  
And youll bring me back to life  
And youll bring me back to life
