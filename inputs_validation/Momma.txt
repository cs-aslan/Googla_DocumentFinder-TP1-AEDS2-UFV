I was the baby brother  
I was the quiet other  
And I remember mother so well  
I was the little stranger  
I never was in danger  
I could a had a manger pray tell  
Oh how she could control me  
When I was bad shed scold me  
Sometimes she wouldnt hold me  
And Id cry  
But momma she never told me a lie   
Momma she never told me a lie  
I used to stay out evenings  
Stay out too late some evenings  
And momma would be there seething  
Back home  
Momma she sat and waited  
Sat in the hall and waited  
Now I know why she hated  
That phone  
And when Id come in shed grab me  
Right by the arm shed grab me  
Lord when she was finished with me  
Id cry  Oh Id cry  
But momma she never told me a lie  
Momma she never told me a lie  
Momma she could control me  
And when I was bad shed scold me  
Sometimes she wouldnt hold me  
And Id cry  
Momma she never told me a lie  
Momma she never promised me the sky  
Momma she never told me a lie
