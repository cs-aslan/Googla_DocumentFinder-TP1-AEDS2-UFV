I remember so well  
The day that you came into my life  
You asked for my name  
You had the most beautiful smile  
  
My life started to change  
Id wake up each day feeling alright  
With you right by my side  
Makes me feel things will work out just fine  
  
How did you know  
I needed someone like you in my life  
That theres an empty space in my heart  
You came at the right time in my life  
  
Ill never forget  
How you brought the sun to shine in my life  
And took all the worries and fears that I had  
I guess what Im really trying to say  
Its not everyday that someone like you comes my way  
No words can express how much I love you  
  
How did you know  
I needed someone like you in my life  
That theres an empty space in my heart  
You came at the right time in my life
