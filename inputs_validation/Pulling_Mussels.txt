They do it down on Camber Sands they do it at Waikiki  
Lazing about this beach all day night the crickets creepy  
Squinting faces at the sky a Harold Robbins paperback  
Surfers drop their boards and dry and everybody wants a hat  
But behind the chalet my holidays complete  
And I feel like William Tell Maid Marian on her tiptoed feet  
Pulling mussels from the shell  
Pulling mussels from the shell  
Shrinking in the sea so cold topless ladies look away  
A Heman in a sudden shower shelters from the rain  
You wish you had a motor boat to pose around the harbor bar  
When the sun goes off to bed you hook it up behind the car  
But behind the chalet my holidays complete  
And I feel like William Tell Maid Marian on her tiptoed feet  
Pulling mussels from the shell  
Pulling mussels from the shell  
Two fat ladies window shop something for the mantelpiece  
In for bingo all the nines a panda for sweet little niece  
The coach drivers stand about looking at a local map  
About the boy hes gone away down to next doors caravan  
But behind the chalet my holidays complete  
And I feel like William Tell Maid Marian on her tiptoed feet  
Pulling mussels from the shell  
Pulling mussels from the shell  
But behind the chalet my holidays complete  
And I feel like William Tell Maid Marian on her tiptoed feet  
Pulling mussels from the shell  
Pulling mussels from the shell
