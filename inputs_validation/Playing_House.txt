We cant keep playing house  
With such a big world outside  
How do we shut it out  
At a fork in the road  
Should I stay or should I go  
Ill keep the cat  
Leave a spare under the mat  
If you need to crash one day  
  
Cause I know we swore forever  
But it seems so far away  
Dont you think were just too young  
To play these grown up games  
  
Cause you know me too well  
Itd be like me lying to myself  
But Im so scared to be alone  
And go back to sleeping with the lights on  
  
Cause I can be myself  
Drunk or sober fat proactive poster  
Wouldnt it be nice  
If we were older  
  
Cause I know we swore forever  
But it seems so far away  
Dont you think were just too young  
To play these grown up games  
  
Some days I wanna take my chances  
Not live so modernized  
Some day I wanna be a Mrs  
But its not yet quite right  
No its not yet quite right  
  
So there go our future childrens names  
I put the rest of us in a box in the closet  
That I cannot open without getting full  
Full of emotion  
Because you know I loved you  
You know I loved you  
You know I loved you  
You know I loved you  
You know I loved you  
  
Cause I know we swore forever  
But it seems so far away  
Dont you think were just too young  
To play  
  
One day I wanna take my chances  
Not live so modernized  
One day I wanna be a Mrs  
But its not yet quite right  
No its not yet quite right  
No its not yet quite right
