Somethings wrong that restless feelings  
Been preying on your mind  
Road maps in a wellcracked ceiling  
The signs arent hard to find  
Now Im not saying that youve been mistreated  
No ones hurt you nothings wrong  
A moments rest was all you needed  
So pack your things and kindly move along  
  
Like dust in the wind youre gone forever  
Youre windblown leaves  
Youre a change in the weather  
Just a town like any other  
A second brand new start  
A third or fourth hand wife or lover no  
You wont break her heart  
Take some bacon go on and leave your watch chain  
She wont count on nothing more  
Wrap your hands around that small change and tiptoe barefoot out the door  
  
Yes somethings wrong that restless feelings been preying on my mind  
When things get bad Im bound to pack my bags  
And just leave them all behind
