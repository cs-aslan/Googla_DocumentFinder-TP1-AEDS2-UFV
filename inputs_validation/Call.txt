Lemme tell you the story  
Bout the call that changed my destiny  
Me and my boys went out  
Just to end up in misery  
Was about to go home when  
There she was standing infront of me  
And said Hi I got a little place nearby  
Want to go  
  
I shouldve said no  
Someones waiting for me  
But I got my coat called and said  
  
Listen baby Im sorry  
Just want to tell you dont worry  
I will be late  
Dont stay up and wait for me  
I said again your dropping out  
My battery is low  
Just so you know  
Were going to a place nearby  
Gotta go  
  
Now two is done nothings been won  
I cant take it back whats done is done  
But what if my friends found out  
That she wasnt my only one  
And it eats me from inside  
That shes not by my side  
Just because I made that call yeah  
  
Lemme tell you the story  
Bout the call that changed my destiny  
Me and my boys went out  
Just to end up in misery  
Was about to go home when  
There she was standing in front of me  
And said Hi I got a little place nearby  
Gotta go
