Watch as the room rocks men only moon walk  
Mixed media slang banging in your boom box  
Verbal violence lyrical stylist  
In a time when rock hip hop rhymes are childish  
  
You cant tempt me with rhymes that are empty  
Rapping to a beat doesnt make you an Emcee  
With your lack of skill and facility youre killing me  
And a DJ in the group just for credibility  
  
I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes  
Youre not an Emcee if someone else writes your lines  
And rapping over rock doesnt make you a pioneer  
Cause rock and hip hop have collaborated for years  
  
But now theyre getting randomly mixed and matched up  
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck  
So how does it stack up None of its real  
You want to be an emcee youve got to study the skill  
  
Who can rock a rhyme like this  
Bring it to you every time like this  
Who can rock a rhyme like this  
Step step up step step up  
  
So you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity  
But mentally you dont have the hip hop energy  
With a tendency to make up stories  
Sounding like the only hip hop youve heard is top 40  
  
And your record company is completely missing it  
All the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate  
So in a battle you cant hack it react with whack shit  
And get smacked with verbal back flips  
  
Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts  
Its taken decades for emcees to establish this  
Youre new to hip hop and welcome if your serious  
But not on the mic leave that to the experienced  
  
Using the waves of sound the true master  
Paralyzes his opponents leaving him vulnerable to attack  
  
Who can rock a rhyme like this  
Bring it to you every time like this  
Who can rock a rhyme like this  
Step step up step step up  
  
Who can rock a rhyme like this  
Bring it to you every time like this  
Who can rock a rhyme like this  
Step step up step step up step up  
  
After years of pain staking research  
By the worlds leading sound scientists  
We here at the sound institute have invented  
A reliable audio weapons system  
  
Actual movement of musical sound  
In space used to carefully attack and neutralize  
The cellular structure of the human body  
And the question must be asked  
  
Who can rock a rhyme like this  
Bring it to you every time like this  
Who can rock a rhyme like this  
Step step up step step up  
  
Who can rock a rhyme like this  
Bring it to you every time like this  
Who can rock a rhyme like this  
Step step up step step up step up  
  
Mixed media step up to the microphone  
And you do it like this
