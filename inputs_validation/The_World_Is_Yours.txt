Keep your distance  
Youre in the race   
Caress me  
In your eye Ive got better things to do This will hurt someone White walls
windows  
Charity  
Defenders  
Comfort me and bring me something sharp This will hurt someone  someone else  
This will hurt someone else Calm down Think Carefully  
Seen it all before  
Mind your own fucking business  
Seen it all before  
What I would give for your eyes  
Seen it all before  
Youd never blink again  
Seen it all before Faces on top of more faces  
This bullet in your chest the world is yours  
Each word you suck it through a straw  
Its so predictable its policy This will hurt someone  someone else
