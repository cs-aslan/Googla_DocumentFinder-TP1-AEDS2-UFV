Love is a catastrophe  
Look what its done to me  
Brought me down here so low  
Stranded nowhere to go  
  
No concentration  
Just rerunning conversation  
Trying to understand  
How I fell into this quicksand  
  
What happens next  
With life Im unimpressed  
Pain like a cutters knife  
Never been lonelier in my life  
  
Who issued the instruction  
For this mad act of destruction  
An end to equilibrium  
Fate laughs  
Look what weve done to him  
  
High wind through the trees  
Falling November leaves  
A weak sun hanging low  
Summer seems so long ago  
  
All my former dreams  
Tender romantic schemes  
Revealed as so naive  
To think I could believe  
  
In love as the kindest law  
Not as a declaration of war  
On my life and sanity  
Now I know at last for me  
Love is a catastrophe
