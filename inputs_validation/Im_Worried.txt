Im worried  
Worried as a man can be  
Im worried  
Worried as a man can be  
  
Im worried bout my baby  
Shes gone away from me  
Well Im worried about my baby  
And I wonder where she gone  
Well Im worried about my baby  
And I wonder where she gone  
I hope some day  
  
My baby love will return  
Well I hope some day  
My baby love will return  
I hope some day  
  
My baby love will return  
If she dont come back to me  
My whole life will go to ruin  
  
Im worried  
Worried as a man can be  
Im worried  
Worried as a man can be  
Im worried bout my baby  
Shes gone away from me
