I said Id leave you anytime Im ready  
Some April when all the land is wet  
Some summer some fall or maybe winter  
Ill go someday but Im not ready yet  
I shouldve left the day your love was dyin  
I passed up every date I ever set  
I know Ill leave you when my heart is ready  
Im still around cause Im not ready yet  
Well Ive left a hundred times but you dont know that  
Because Im ashamed to tell how far I get  
You didnt you dont youll never love me  
And someday Ill go but Im not ready yet  
I shouldve left the day your love was dyin  
I passed up every date I ever set  
I know Ill leave you when my heart is ready  
Im still around cause Im not ready yet
