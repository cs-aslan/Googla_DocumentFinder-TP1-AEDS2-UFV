My heart skipsskipsskipsskipsskipsskips a beat  
  
I can see youre not yourself  
Even when youre here with me  
I know that youre somewhere else  
  
So put another record on  
Kiss and leave me on  
Nothing really matters when were dancing  
Listen to the same sad song playing on repeat  
Cause every time we come this close my heart skips skips a beat  
  
So come on spin me around  
Now I dont wanna go home  
Cause when you hold me like this you know my heart skips skips a beat  
I know I should but I cant leave it alone  
And when you hold me like this thats when my heart skips skips a beat  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
So hung up we cant let go  
If you really have to leave  
One more time just move me slow  
  
So put another record on  
Play it on repeat  
Nothing really matters when were dancing  
Cause all you ever need to know is what you do to me  
And every time you hold me close my heart skips skips a beat  
  
So come on spin me around  
Now I dont wanna go home  
Cause when you hold me like this you know my heart skips skips a beat  
I know I should but I cant leave it alone  
And when you hold me like this thats when my heart skips skips a beat  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Rizzle Kicks Yeah  
At the start of the night I was like what  
Lets have a team talk  
Playing with this lady isnt something Id agree for  
Flaps keep going up and down like a seesaw  
Should have just taken her to the cinema to see saw  
Ooh she let me sit with her I figured her figures a sure sure winner  
Cause I got a lead from the back Ima skipper  
You make my heart skip skip skip skip skip skip a beat  
  
So come on spin me around  
Now I dont wanna go home  
Cause when you hold me like this you know my heart skips skips a beat  
I know I should but I cant leave it alone  
And when you hold me like this thats when my heart skips skips a beat  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
Ohohoh My heart skips skips a beat  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
Ohohoh My heart skips skips a beat
