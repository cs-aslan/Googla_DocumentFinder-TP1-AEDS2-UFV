Its just a one dollar secret  
A lovers secrets in the UK  
Torn apart in the UK  
In the dribble of MayDay  
87 and Cry  
87 and Cry  
And theres nothing inside  
And theres nothing in mind  
And only you  
Rocket on through the sky  
It couldnt be done without dogs  
It couldnt be once without us  
87 and Cry  
87 and Cry  
  
When the days were the days were the days boys  
When blue ties were for the biggy guys  
Frannie dressing down for the enemy  
You saw him hangin on the enemy  
And theres no one in love  
And theres nowhere to scream  
And only you  
Race on to wonder where  
It couldnt be done without dogs  
It couldnt be once without us  
87 and Cry  
87 and Cry  
You cant make love with money  
You cant make mistakes with babies  
Nothing looked good on you  
Thats how I liked you best  
Now youre ready for the real McCoy  
  
Deep in the heart of Cupid  
Murders on the heels of love  
Just the ghost of a story  
Just a one dollar secret  
Baby these were the sounds  
Baby these were the sounds  
And only you  
Whisper these things arent true  
It couldnt be done with dogs  
It couldnt be once without us  
87 and Cry  
87 and Cry
