Thats underground  
And fly  
Macho Macho  
I dont like your style  
Macho Macho  
Youll be floatin on the river Nile  
Macho Macho  
So get down on your knees and pray  
Macho Macho  
Im gonna blow your Macho Macho mind away away  
And the boys are singin  
Na  na  na  na  na  
Hip hip  
Na  na  na  na  na  
So listen  
I heard a story the other day  
And Ive been wonderin what they got to say  
They said you took ma lady for a ride  
They said it lasted to the morning light  
So listen  
I am not a violent boy  
But you touched my lady and shes my  
Favourite toy  
And youre  
Macho Macho  
Fade out  
The boys dont sing anymore
