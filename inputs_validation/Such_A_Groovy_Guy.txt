I got my alligator boots I wear my pants skin tight  
I wear my dark sunglasses in the middle of the night  
And when I look in the mirror Ima such an awesome sight  
It makes me wanna kneel down and pray  
Im so adorable and charming Im sure that you can see  
And everyones always trying to hang around with me  
They tell me Im the greatest and its hard to disagree  
Cause Im so perfect in every way  
And Im so cute I can hardly stand it  
And Im so handsome honey I could just die  
I know youll never be as wonderful as me but at least you can try  
Cause Im such a groovy guy  
Yeah Im such a groovy guy  
Im such a groovy guy  
Yeah Im such a groovy guy  
Baby are you in the mood for a little romance  
Well for starters I can pour some chocolate pudding down your pants  
And then attach electrodes to your brain and watch you dance  
Oh golly wouldnt that be fun  
Oh and then I might decide to tie you up with dental floss  
Ill make you wear a harness and Ill show you whos the boss  
Of course if you refuse well honey its your loss  
I mean I dont do this with just anyone  
So baby how can you say its all over  
So how can you tell me goodbye  
So now you tell me that youre leaving me for good  
And all I wanna know is why  
I mean after all  
Im really such a groovy guy  
Yeah Im such a groovy guy  
Im such a groovy guy  
Yeah Im such a groovy guy  
I mean you could do worse  
Im such a groovy guy  
Yeah Im such a groovy guy  
Im such a groovy guy  
Im such a groovy guy  
Im such a groovy guy  
Yeah Im such a groovy guy  
Im such a groovy guy  
Im such a groovy guy
