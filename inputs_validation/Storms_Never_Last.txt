Chorus  
Storms never last do they baby  
Bad times all pass with the wind  
  
Your hand in mine stills the thunder and your love makes the sun  
Want to shine  
  
Ive followed you down so many roads  
Baby Ive picked wild flowers and sung you soft sad songs  
And every road you took I know your search was for the truth  
And the cloud thats brewing now wont be your last  
  
Chorus
