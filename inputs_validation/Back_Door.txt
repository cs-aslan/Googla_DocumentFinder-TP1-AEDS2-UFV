Brown skin in the kitchen  
China white Washrag and the dollars  
On the table Keep it quiet quiet  
  
They come and go through the back door  
Whos keepin score Whos keepin  
Pension werent no mention  
Medicaid Sorry and the gmen  
Got the word in Gettin wise Goodnight  
  
Pistol blew the whistle On the plan Mexican  
And the river made of dollars Made of sand  
  
They come and go through the back door  
Whos keepin score Whos keepin  
Pension werent no mention  
Medicaid Sorry and the gmen  
Got the word in Gettin wise Goodnight
