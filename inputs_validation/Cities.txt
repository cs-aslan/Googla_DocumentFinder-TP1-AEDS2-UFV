Think of London small city  
Dark dark in the daytime  
People sleep sleep in the daytime  
If they want to if they want to  
  
Im checkin em out  
Im checkin em out  
Ive got it figured out  
Ive got it figured out  
  
Theres some good points some bad points  
But it all works out Im just a little freaked out  
  
Find your city  
Find yourself a city to live in  
I will find a city  
Find yourself a city to live in  
  
A lot of bridges in Birmingham  
A lot of ghosts and a lot of houses  
Look over there dry ice factory  
Good place to get some thinking done  
  
Im checkin em out  
Im checkin em out  
Ive got it figured out  
Im the one who got it figured out  
  
Theres some good points some bad points  
  
Find your city  
Find yourself a city to live in  
I will find a city  
Find yourself a city to live in  
  
Did I forget to mention  
Forget to mention Memphish  
Home of Elvis and the ancient Greeks  
Do I smell I smell home cooking  
Its only the river its only the river  
  
Im checkin em out  
Im checkin em out  
Ive got it figured out  
Ive got it figured out  
  
Theres some good points some bad points  
Are those things real Denied  
  
Find your city  
Find yourself a city to live in  
I will find a city  
Find yourself a city to live in  
I will find a city  
Find yourself a city to live in
