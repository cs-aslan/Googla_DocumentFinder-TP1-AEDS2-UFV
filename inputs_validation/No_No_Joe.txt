Now look here Joe quit acting smart  
Stop being that old brazen sort  
Dont you go sellin this country short  
No no Joe  
  
Just because you think youve found  
The system that we know aint sound  
Dont you go throwin your weight around  
No no Joe  
  
Cause the Kaiser tried it and Hitler tried it  
Mussolini tried it too  
Now theyre all sittin around a fire and did you know something  
Theyre saving a place for you  
  
Now Joe you ought to get it clear  
You cant push folks around with fear  
Cause we dont scare easy over here  
No no Joe  
  
What makes you do the things you do  
You gettin folks mad at you  
Dont bite off moren you can chew  
No no Joe  
  
Cause you want a scrap that you cant win  
You dont know what youre getting in  
Dont go around leading with your chin  
No no Joe  
  
Now you got tanks some fair size tanks  
But youre acting like a clown  
Cause man weve got Yanks a mess of Yanks  
And you might get caught with your tanks down  
  
Dont go throwin out your chest  
Youll pop the buttons off your vest  
Youre playing with a hornets nest  
No no Joe  
  
You know you think youre somebody we should dread  
Just because youre seein red  
You better get that foolishness out of your head  
No no Joe  
  
And you might be itchin for a fight  
Quit braggin about how your bear can bite  
Cause youre sitting on a keg of dynamite  
No no Joe
