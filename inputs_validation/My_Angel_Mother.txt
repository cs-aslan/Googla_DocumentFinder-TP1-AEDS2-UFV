Im writing this song about a girl that I know  
Shes just as pure as the powdery snow  
I might search this world over but Id never find  
No one to take the place of this mother of mine  
  
Mother Thats the sweetest name of them all  
Youre an angel on earth and to me you are worth  
More than anything else in the world  
  
I love you more day by day  and I could never repay  
All the things that youve done for me  
Your heart is filled with joyous times  
And your eyes  how they shine  
Thats the story of this mother of mine  
  
Mother you will never not ever grow old  
Youre an angel on earth and to me you are worth  
More than mountains of silver and gold  
  
Mother
