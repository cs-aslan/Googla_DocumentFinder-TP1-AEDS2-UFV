Gee but its great to be back home  
Home is where I want to be  
Ive been on the road so long my friend  
That if you came along I know you couldnt disagree  
Its the same old story  
Everywhere I go I get slandered  
Libeled I hear words I never heard in the bible  
And Im one step ahead of the shoeshine  
Two steps away from the county line  
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied  
Satisfied  
  
Deputy sheriff said to me  
Tell me what you came here for boy  
You better get your bags and flee  
Youre in trouble boy  
And now youre heading into more  
Its the same old story  
Everywhere I go  
I get slandered  
Libeled  
I hear words I never heard in the bible  
And Im one step ahead of the shoe shine
