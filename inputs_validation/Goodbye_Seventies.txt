To your credit to the thirty faces you created  
To your headache to the shape of the 1980s  
Im glad that we dont hear you any more  
Im tired of playing in your fashion war  
  
To the lights to the trend setting in your head  
Sunday nights tear from the youth cults already dead  
Im glad that we dont hear you and more  
Im tired of fighting in your fashion war  
  
Chorus  
Goodbye seventies  
  
To your credit to the thirty faces you created  
To your subscription for the million copies of 1980  
Im glad that we dont hear you any more  
Im tired of losing in your fashion war  
  
Chorus
