I see your face in  
The magazine stand  
I wanna hold you in the palm  
Of my hand  
I love everything about you  
Youre such a long way away  
Your sweet talk  
Aint enough for me  
I may be deaf but youre  
Too blind to see  
Youre gonna break my bones  
With your feminine tones  
But I dont wanna hear  
Your sweet talk tonight  
Not again tonight  
When I call tonight  
Dont wanna hear your  
Sweet talk tonight  
I hear your voice on the radio  
Its gettin so bad I dont know  
Which way to go  
Why dont you wake up girl  
Youre such a long way away  
Your sweet talk aint enough  
You see  
I need a woman  
Whos a woman to me  
Youre gonna break my bones  
With those feminine tones  
But I dont wanna hear  
Oh I dont wanna hear it  
Not tonight  
Youre gonna break my bones  
With your feminine tones  
But I dont wanna hear  
None of that sweet talk tonight  
Oh not again tonight  
When I call tonight  
Sweet talk tonight  
Not again tonight  
When I call tonight  
Dont wanna hear your sweet talk
