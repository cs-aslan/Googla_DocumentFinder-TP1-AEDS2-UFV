When I want to see the boys  
I know where to find the boys  
I dont go through a club or two  
I just find you and there are the boys  
To get you alone I strive  
You ask me to tea at five  
I find you then with other men  
And wonder when my chance will arrive  
  
Hows chances say how are the chances  
Of making you love me the way I love you  
  
How many young men must I fight with  
To be in right with  
In right with you  
  
Hows chances for one of those glances  
A glimpse of the heaven Im longing to see  
  
Hows chances to end all your romances  
And start taking your chances with me  
  
  
alternate bridge  
My castle will need some restoring  
Ceiling and flooring  
Furniture too
