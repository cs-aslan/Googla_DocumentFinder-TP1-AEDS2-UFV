Hes in love with rocknroll woaahh  
Hes in love with gettin stoned woaahh  
Hes in love with Janie Jones  
But he dont like his boring job no  
  
An he knows what hes got to do  
So he knows hes gonna have fun with you  
You lucky lady  
An he knows when the evening comes  
When his job is done hell be over in his car for you  
  
An in the intray lots of work  
But the boss at the firm always thinks he shirks  
But hes just like everyone hes got a Ford Cortina  
That just wont run without fuel  
Fill her up Jacko  
  
An the invoice it dont quite fit  
Theres no payola in his alphabetical file  
This time hes gonna really tell the boss  
Gonna really let him know exactly how he feels  
Its pretty bad  
  
Let them know  how you feel
