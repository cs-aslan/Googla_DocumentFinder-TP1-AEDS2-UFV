A soldiers heart  
Reflecting back at me  
I keep seeing mutilated faces  
Even in my dreams  
Distorted images  
Flashing rapidly  
Psychotically abusing me  
Devouring my brain  
  
The eyes of the insane  
On a demented campaign  
  
Tortured spirits  
Will not let me rest  
These thoughts of mutilated faces  
Completely possessed  
Fragmented images  
Flashing rapidly  
Psychotically abusing me  
Worming through my head  
  
Shell shock battle fatigue  
Overwhelming anxiety  
Flashbacks panic attacks  
Death raising its ugly face at me  
  
Got to make it stop  
Cant take it anymore  
The dead keep haunting me  
They just keep coming back for more  
  
The eyes of the insane  
On an demented campaign  
Flashbacks panic attacks  
Death raising his ugly face at me  
  
Got to make it stop  
Cant take it anymore  
Deaths face keeps haunting me  
It just keeps coming back for more  
  
Got to make it stop  
Cant take it anymore  
Deaths face keeps haunting me  
It just keeps coming back for more  
  
A soldier  
Of misfortune  
I owe my pain an suffering  
To this hell  
These demons  
Ripping through my soul  
Evils relentless hostility  
Wont let me sleep  
  
Shell shop battle fatigue  
Devastating insanity  
Flashbacks panic attacks  
Deaths riding hes coming for me
