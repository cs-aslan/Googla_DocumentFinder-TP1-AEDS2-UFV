She left that loser in a dust cloud  
Heart in his hand chin on the ground  
Cried her last tear for that clown  
She can see a little clearer now  
She said Oh oh I gotta go and find me  
Oh oh she found the strength to break free  
  
Chorus  
Like a painted wild mustang  
Flyin out across the open range  
Finally gets to live her life that way  
No fear no fences nobodyno reins  
  
No reins  
  
All shes ever felt is held back  
She says Its kinda nice to hear myself laugh  
Shes gonna do a lot more of that  
Shes makin plans and makin tracks  
She said Oh oh I gotta go and find me  
Oh oh she found the strength to break free  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh oh shes learnin how to let go  
Oh oh whichever way the wind blows  
Oh oh shes learnin how to let go  
  
Chorus x2  
  
No reins
