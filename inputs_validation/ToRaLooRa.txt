Tooralooralooral  
Tooraloorali  
Tooralooralooral  
Hush now dont you cry  
  
Tooralooralooral  
Tooraloorali  
Tooralooralooral  
Thats an Irish lullaby  
  
Over in Killarney many years ago  
My mother sang a song to me in tones so soft and low  
Just a simple little ditty in her good old Irish way  
And Id give the world if I could hear that song of hers  
today  
  
Tooralooralooral  
Tooraloorali  
Tooralooralooral  
Hush now dont you cry  
  
Tooralooralooral  
Tooraloorali  
Tooralooralooral  
Thats an Irish lullaby
