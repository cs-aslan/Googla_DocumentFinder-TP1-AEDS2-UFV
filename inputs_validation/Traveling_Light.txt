Im traveling light  
Its au revoir  
My once so bright my fallen star  
Im running late theyll close the bar  
I used to play one mean guitar  
I guess Im just somebody who  
Has given up on the me and you  
Im not alone Ive met a few  
Traveling light like we used to do  
  
Good night good night my fallen star  
I guess youre right you always are  
I know youre right about the blues  
You live some life youd never choose  
Im just a fool a dreamer who forgot to dream of the me and you  
Im not alone Ive met a few  
Traveling light like we used to do  
Traveling light  
Its au revoir  
My once so bright my fallen star  
Im running late theyll close the bar  
I used to play one mean guitar  
I guess Im just somebody who  
Has given up on the me and you  
Im not alone Ive met a few  
Traveling light like we used to do  
  
But if the road leads back to you  
Must I forget the things I knew  
When I was friends with one or two  
Traveling light like we used to do  
Im traveling light
