Do you know  
How it feels  
Lying here without you baby  
You could never understand whats happening to me  
So alone  
Nothings real  
I just dream about you baby  
And forever wonder why you had  
To break free  
  
Even though youre not my lover  
Even though youre not my friend  
Id give my all  
To have you here  
Just to hold you once again  
  
Its so hard  
To believe  
I dont have you right beside me  
As I long to touch you  
But youre out of my reach  
And my heart doesnt feel  
Its so very cold inside me  
Just a shadow of someone that I used to be  
  
Even though youre not my lover  
Even though youre not my friend  
I would give my all  
To have you here  
Just to hold you once again  
  
You were the only one only one  
That I allowed inside my heart  
Now Im just holding on  
To something so far gone  
Where did I go wrong  
  
Even though youre not my lover  
And even though youre not my friend  
Id give my all  
To have you here  
Just to hold you once again  
Just to hold you once again
