Its no use pretending  
That I understand  
The hide and seek we play with facts  
It changes our demand  
  
Tilt my hat at the sun  
And the shadows they burn dark  
Light me and Ill burn for you  
And the love song never stops  
  
I like the look in your eyes  
When you talk that certain way  
I love the day in the life  
When you know that lovers way  
  
Minding my own business  
When you came along  
Temperatures been running hot  
The fever was so strong  
  
Tilt my hat at the sun  
And the shadows they burn dark  
Light me and Ill burn for you  
And the love song never stops  
  
Its always an adventure  
The fantasies we make a fact  
Youre the secret I desire  
I cant keep that to myself  
  
When were not together  
It doesnt feel so bad  
We could be so far apart  
But our loves not sad  
  
Its no use pretending  
Cause I understand  
The hide and seek we play with facts  
It changes our demand
