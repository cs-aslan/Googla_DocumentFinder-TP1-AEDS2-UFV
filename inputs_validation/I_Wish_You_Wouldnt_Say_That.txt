I wish you wouldnt say that  
I thought Id have to come right over  
I thought I made it clear enough  
I guess Ill have to make it clearer  
  
Say something to change your mind  
Bring me back the way I used to be  
If it takes forever thats all right  
Say the words that Ive been trying to hear  
  
I wish you didnt tell her  
I thought od have to come right over  
I thought Id have to make it clearer  
Now jimmys coming over  
  
There are places that I wont forget  
And I guess Im never going back  
Guess its information that I lack  
Ive told lies without a hint or regret  
  
I wish you wouldnt say that  
I wish you wouldnt say that  
I wish you wouldnt say that  
I wish you wouldnt say that  
I wish you wouldnt say that  
I wish you wouldnt say that  
I wish you wouldnt say that
