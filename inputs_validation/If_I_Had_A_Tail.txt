Gitchy gitchy  
Ooh la la  
Da do run run  
You wont get far  
  
Im machine  
Im obsolete  
In the land of the free  
Lobotomy  
  
I wanna suck I wanna lick  
I want to cry and I want to spit  
Tears of pleasure  
Tears of pain  
They trickle down your face the same  
  
Its how you look  
Not how you feel  
A city of glass  
With no heart  
  
If I had a tail  
Id own the night  
If I had a tail  
Id swat the flies  
  
Yeah oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Yeah oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Gitchy gitchy  
Ooh la la  
Da doo ron ron  
It wont get far  
  
Animals in  
The midnight zone  
When you own the world  
Youre always home  
  
Get your hands dirty  
Roll up them sleeves  
Brainwashed or true believers  
Buy flash cars  
Diamond rings  
Expensive holes to bury things  
  
Im machine  
Im obsolete  
In the land of the free  
Immortality  
  
If I had a tail  
Id own the place  
If I had a tail  
Id swat the flies  
  
Ohohoh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Ohohoh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
See me dancing on the stars  
See me dance  
  
If I have a tail  
I will control the night  
If I have a tail  
I will control the night  
If I have a tail  
I will control the night
