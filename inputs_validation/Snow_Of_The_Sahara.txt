Only tell me that you still want me here  
When you wander off out there  
To those hills of dust and hard winds that blow  
In that dry white ocean alone  
  
Lost out in the desert  
you are lost out in the desert  
  
But to stand with you in a ring of fire  
Ill forget the days gone by  
Ill protect your body and guard your soul  
From mirages in your sight  
  
Lost out in the desert  
  
If your hopes scatter like the dust across your track  
Ill be the moon that shines on your path  
The sun may blind our eyes Ill pray the skies above  
For snow to fall on the sahara  
  
If thats the only place where you can leave your doubts  
Ill hold you up and be your way out  
And if we burn away Ill pray the skies above  
For snow to fall on the sahara  
  
Just a wish and i will cover your shoulders  
With veils of silk and gold  
When the shadows come and darken your heart  
Leaving you with regrets so cold  
  
Lost out in the desert  
  
If your hopes scatter like the dust across your track  
Ill be the moon that shines on your path  
The sun may blind our eyes Ill pray the skies above  
For snow to fall on the sahara  
  
If thats the only place where you can leave your doubts  
Ill hold you up and be your way out  
And if we burn away Ill pray the skies above  
For snow to fall on the sahara
