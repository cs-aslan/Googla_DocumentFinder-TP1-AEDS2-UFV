Verse 1  
Life after youth  
Faded in twilight  
The dawn of a criminal in bloom  
First love  
First forgiveness  
We were delinquants  
Freaks of a faded memory  
  
Chorus 1  
Outlaws When we were forever young  
When we were outlaws  
Were outlaws of redemption baby  
Hooligans  
We destroyed suburbia  
When we were outlaws  
Were Outlaws of forever baby  
Verse 2  
Scars broken hearts  
Breaking in cars  
Running in the light of the moon  
Lost souls  
Bottle rockets  
All that we wanted  
Its for our lives beyond stars  
  
Chorus 1  
Outlaws When we were forever young  
When we were outlaws  
Were outlaws of redemption baby  
Hooligans  
We destroyed suburbia  
When we were outlaws  
Were Outlaws of forever baby  
  
Bridge  
Ive got no supervision  
Nothing will change my spirits  
Race around with my innocence  
Ill plead my innocence  
But thats my best defense  
When you are young  
  
Chorus 2  
Outlaws When we were forever young  
When we were outlaws  
Were outlaws of redemption baby  
Hooligans  
We destroyed suburbia  
When we were outlaws  
Were outlaws all forever  
  
Outro  
I found a knife by the railroad track  
You took a train and you cant go back  
Forever now forever now youll roam
