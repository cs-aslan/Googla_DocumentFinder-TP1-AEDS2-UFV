Now I have nothing so God give me strength  
cause Im weak anyway  
And if Im strong I might still break  
  
And I dont have anything to share  
That I wont throw away into the air  
That song is sung out  
This bell is rung out  
  
He was the light that Id bless  
He took my last chance of happiness  
So God give me strength  
God give me strength  
  
I cant hold on to him  
God give me strength  
When the phone doesnt ring  
And Im lost in imagining  
Everything that kind of love is worth  
As I tumble back down to the earth  
  
That song is sung out  
This bell is rung out  
He was the light that Id bless  
He took my last chance of happiness  
So God give me strength  
  
God if hed grant me his indulgence and decline  
I might as well wipe him from my memory  
Fracture the spell as he becomes my enemy  
And maybe I was washed out  
Like a lip print on a shirt  
See Im only human I want him to hurt  
I want him I want him to hurt  
  
Since I lost the power to pretend  
That there could ever be a happy ending  
That song is sung out  
This bell is rung out  
  
He was the light that Id bless  
He took my last chance of happiness  
So God give me strength  
God give me strength  
  
Oooooooh Oooooh  
Wipe him from my memory  
Oooh I got to him wipe him from my memory  
Mmmm Ooooooooh
