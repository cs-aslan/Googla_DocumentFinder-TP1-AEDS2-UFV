Why cant you just admit it  
Youve had it youre  
Sick of me  
  
Youre fed up  
With my almighty attitude  
Sick of me  
  
Generalize  
Youve become so desensitized  
Sick of me  
  
Loss of breath  
I can see that youve had it youre  
Sick of me  
  
Wandering out the door  
I am on to you  
Youre comin back for more  
Am I losing you  
  
Like a dog  
That just pissed on your barbecue  
Sick of me  
  
Losing faith  
And you still dont know what to do  
Sick of me  
  
Loss of love  
Now you hate everything and youre  
Sick of me  
  
Its a waste  
But we still keep on trying youre  
Sick of me  
  
Wandering out the door  
I am on to you  
Youre comin back for more  
Am I losing you  
  
So you got your problems  
So youve got your worries  
Do you have a conscience  
Do you have a need  
Well Im sick of you too
