Should you stay should you go  
Youre beginning to see  
I go hot I go cold  
Its just the devil in me  
Youve got to understand I am in love with a beautiful man  
So if youre feeling insecure youve really no cause to be  
  
I want you near me dont you run away  
I just got used to having you around  
I want you near me come on here and stay  
Dont let me down  
  
Youre so good with your hands  
To help me with a hook or a zip  
Indispensable thats what you are  
For the occasional kiss  
Im only playing games with you I cant be nice without being cruel  
I know its not fair but I make the rules  
  
I want you near me dont you run away  
I just got used to having you around  
I want you near me come on here and stay  
Dont let me down  
  
All I want Ive decided  
Is your attention undivided  
  
I want you near dont turn away  
I want you near me wont you stay
