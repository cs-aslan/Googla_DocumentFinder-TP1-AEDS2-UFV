Heres to the corners yet to turn  
Heres to the bridges yet to burn  
Heres to the whole thing blown apart  
Its open season on my heart  
The days go by like flying bricks  
Leave gaping holes too deep to fix  
Id just stay home if I were smart  
Its open season on my heart  
  
I cant blame anyone but me  
This reckless fool Ive come to be  
My tired excuses just dont fit  
It dont look good from where I sit  
Ive tried to change without much luck  
I reached the point where I get stuck  
I hit the streets and the fireworks start  
Its open season on my heart  
  
I cant be something that Im not  
I cant give what I havent got  
I dont know where or why or when  
I only know the shape Im in  
  
So heres to the clown down in the mouth  
Heres to the whole thing going south  
My own true loves turned poison dart  
Its open season on my heart  
  
Heres turning heartaches into art  
Its open season on my heart
