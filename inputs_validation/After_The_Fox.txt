Who is the fox  I am the fox  
Who are you  I am me  
Who is me  Me is a thief  
Youll bring your poor poor mother grief  
  
So after the fox after the fox  
Off to the hunt with chains and locks  
So after the fox after the fox  
Someone is always chasing after the fox  
  
Where is the gold  Its on the truck  
Wheres the truck  I wont tell  
You must tell  Then I will lie  
Youll make your poor poor sister cry  
  
So after the fox after the fox  
Off to the hunt with chains and locks  
So after the fox after the fox  
Someone is always chasing after the fox  
  
Why do you steal  So Ill be rich  
Why not work  Work is hard  
Youll be caught  I never fail  
All little crooks wind up in jail  Not me not me  
  
So after the fox after the fox  
Off to the hunt with chains and locks  
So after the fox after the fox  
Someone is always chasing after the fox  
  
After the fox  
After the fox  
After the fox
