Look for empty roads to travel  
And grab some peace of mind  
When my life seems to unravel  
Strength from you Ill find  
Like the ocean and the sunshine  
Ill keep trying till youre all mine  
  
Chorus  
Till the moment is right  
I wont give up the fight  
Ill keep pushing till I break through the barrier  
Like a phoenix arises  
Aint no mountain too high  
Ill keep pushing till I break through the barrier  
  
Like the eyes of total strangers  
Our future is unknown  
In a world of hidden danger  
Dont want to be all alone  
Like a rainbow and the starlight  
Ill keep holding on till youre mine  
  
Chorus  
  
When it seems that odds are all against you  
Gotta reach inside and find the strength to pull you through  
  
Its not enough to love each other baby  
To make it right is gonna take some time  
If I could only break through your barrier
