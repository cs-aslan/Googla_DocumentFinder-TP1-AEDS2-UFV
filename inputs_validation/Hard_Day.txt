Dont bring me down  
Dont bring me down  
Dont bring me down  
  
Ive never been one for playing games  
You can move your mouth forever  
But the words sound just the same  
Something like  
Bang bang youre dead  
Couldnt we just make love instead  
Say yes cause its what we do best  
And Ive had such a hard day  
  
Take me where their eyes cant find us  
Without you I may as well just  
  
How much do I have to say  
What more do you have to see  
What will it take to make you love me  
Oh well youre not the first  
Youre not the last  
Youre not even the one who loves me the best  
But all I think about is you  
  
Take me where their eyes cant find us  
Without you I may as well just  
  
Take me where their eyes cant find us  
Without you I may as well just  
  
Dont bring me down  
Dont bring me down  
Dont bring me down  
  
Please dont wander from my door  
Ive never been one for playing games  
You can move your mouth forever  
But the words sound just the same  
Ow  
Bang bang youre dead  
Couldnt we just make love instead  
Say yes because its what we do best  
And Ive had such a hard day  
  
So dont bring me down  
Wont you give me break  
Somebody give me a break now  
  
Dont bring me down  
Dont bring me down  
Dont bring me down  
  
Sweet little boy with oh such a big mouth  
Harsh words can get you into hot water  
When people dont understand you baby  
Im always here for you  
And I  
And I will never bring you down down down down  
Down my baby  
  
Trust me  
I want you to trust me  
Oh oh trust me  
Cause I wont bring you down  
Dont bring me down  
I wont bring you down  
Do you trust me  
Yeah
