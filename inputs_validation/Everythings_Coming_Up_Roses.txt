I had a dream a dream about you baby  
Its gonna come true baby  
They think that were through but baby  
  
Youll be swell Youll be great  
Gonna have the whole world on the plate  
Starting here starting now  
honey everythings coming up roses  
  
Clear the decks Clear the tracks  
Youve got nothing to do but relax  
Blow a kiss Take a bow  
Honey everythings coming up roses  
  
Nows your inning Stand the world on its ear  
Set it spinning Thatll be just the beginning  
Curtain up Light the lights  
You got nothing to hit but the heights  
Youll be swell Youll be great  
I can tell Just you wait  
That lucky star I talk about is due  
Honey everythings coming up roses for me and for you  
  
You can do it all you need is a hand  
We can do it Mama is gonna see to it  
Curtain up Light the lights  
We got nothing to hit but the heights  
I can tell wait and see  
Theres the bell Follow me  
And nothings gonna stop us til were through  
Honey everythings coming up roses and daffodils  
Everythings coming up sunshine and Santa Claus  
Everythings gonna be bright lights and lollipops  
Everythings coming up roses for me and for you
