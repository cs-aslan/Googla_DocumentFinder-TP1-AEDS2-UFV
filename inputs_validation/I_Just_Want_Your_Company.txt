Aint nothing working aint nothing right  
Theres a whole in me that I cant fill no matter how hard I try  
Hey hey hey bartender hit me with a double  
And introduce me to that girl with the bobble  
Im looking for trouble tonight  
No momma dont trust me tonight  
You be the center baby Ill be the quarter back  
High get the tail back watchin all the play back  
Jaw smash now heating now rambo  
Up in the hands all biting on the cannibal  
I just want your company  
I want you to comfort me just come with me  
Hey bartender hit me with another  
Im just about how to kill this brother  
Im lookin for trouble tonight

Take it to the streets take it like a man

I want you to comfort me just come with me

There aint nothing sweeter there aint nothing wrong  
All the pain that Ive received keeps me strong  
It keeps me moving on
