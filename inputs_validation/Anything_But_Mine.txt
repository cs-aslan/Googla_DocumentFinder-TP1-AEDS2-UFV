Walking along beneath the lights of that miracle mile  
Me and Mary making our way into the night  
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides the pinball  
Bells and the skee ball signs  
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight  
  
Theres a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean  
Making its way past the hotel walls to fill the street  
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hand  
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet  
  
And in the morning Im leaving making my way back to Cleveland  
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine  
And I dont see how you could ever be  
Anything but mine  
  
Theres a local band playing at the seaside pavilion  
And I got just enough cash to get us in  
And as we are dancing Marys wrapping her arms around me  
  
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin  
  
In the midst of the music  
I tell her I love her  
And we both laugh cause we know it isnt true  
Oh but Mary theres a summer drawing to an end tonight  
And theres so much that I long to do to you  
  
But in the morning Im leaving making my way back to Cleveland  
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine  
And I dont see how you could ever be  
Anything but mine  
  
And in the morning Im leaving making my way back to Cleveland  
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine  
And I dont see how you could ever be  
Anything but mine  
  
Mary I dont see how you could ever be  
Anything but mine  
  
In the morning Im leaving making my way back to Cleveland  
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine  
Hey I dont see how you could ever be  
Anything but mine
