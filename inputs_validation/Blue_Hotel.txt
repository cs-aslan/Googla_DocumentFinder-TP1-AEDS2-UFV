Id like to say that I tried  
It fits in with all the suggestions and lies and empty tables  
With food untouched  
I couldnt see the future  
I liked the past too much  
Ive been going door to door like I got something to sell  
Wandering like a fool  
Through the halls of a blue hotel  
  
So go on and rain down on us  
Go on and rain  
Go on and rain down on us  
I give up I give up  
  
Something about her thats cold  
Shes blowing through the trees  
Leaving me raw  
As the words come out  
I get confused  
I get shattered like a light bulb in an October moon  
Shes inside me like a secret  
And I got no one to tell  
Wandering like a fool  
Through the halls of a blue hotel  
  
Go on and rain down on us  
Go on and rain  
Go on and rain down on us  
I give up  
I give up
