Chorus  
I wanna thank you for the things youve done  
I wanna thank you for your generosity  
And Ill never be alone thats because thats because you are my friend  
Thats because thats because you are my friend  
  
Been through thick and thin together  
Through the ups and downs yet we still remain  
And I can talk to you forever  
  
Chorus  
  
Before I met you I was real low now everyone know  
Now that I know you hey Im real high  
I wanna thank you for the day and nights  
I wanna thank you for the breath of life  
Without you Id be lost  
  
Chorus  
  
Just as long just as long as youre my friend  
Just as long just as long as youre my friend  
Thats because you are my friend you are my friend
