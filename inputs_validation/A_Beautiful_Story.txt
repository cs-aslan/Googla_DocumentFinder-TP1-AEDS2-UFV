Whats your name is it Jane  
Would you mind sitting next to a silly old fool  
Its just I tired of wasting my hours  
Talking to trees and watching flowers grow  
Watching birds chasing bees  
Little boys scraping knees  
Even my tears have all dried  
Can I sit by your side  
  
Chorus  
Dont misunderstand me  
Im just an old man with no place to go  
And if you oblige me and sit here beside me  
Ill tell you a story a beautiful story  
That you might not know Please dont go  
  
Pardon me mister tree  
I hope I didnt offend you before  
You are my friend but I wanted much more  
But now Im back once again  
Like always before  
Watching birds chasing bees  
Little boys scraping knees  
Even my tears have all dried  
Can I sit by your side  
  
Chorus
