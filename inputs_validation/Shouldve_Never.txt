Ive been so caught up in the thought of me and you  
Even though I love someone else I know my heart belongs to you  
Maybe we should just try to hide the things we feel inside  
Things I know we cant deny  
  
Chorus  
Shouldve never told you that I cared about you  
Didnt think that it would be so bad  
Shouldve never kissed you  
Shouldve never held your hand  
  
Gotta find a way to let these feelings go  
What did I do the day I let you slip into my soul My soul  
It was then when I realized that I would always want you in my life  
In my life  
No one else can know of the things that we were saying on the telephone  
It would be so bad if they ever knew that me and you were secretly into each
other  
  
Chorus  
  
Gotta find a way to let these feelings go  
Oh Im so scared trembling inside cause Im feelin like somebody else  
Already knows  
Oh my god I love you boy so much but to have to choose between the two  
is hurting me so deep inside  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont ever want to feel this way again  
  
Chorus
