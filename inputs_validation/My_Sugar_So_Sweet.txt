Yes mama  yes girl  
Hear me calling you  
So sweet so sweet

Aint seen my little sugar come home  
So sweet so sweet  
My sugars so sweet  
But my baby shed long gone  
But Ive seen her  I mustve been doing her wrong  
So sweet so sweet  
My sugars so sweet  
See my baby dont act so smart  
Ill cut out your liver and eat your heart  
So sweet so sweet  
My sugars so sweet  
Yes mama  yes girl  
Hear me calling you  
So sweet so sweet
