  
Keep your lure in the water dont just sit by the shore  
There are souls to be caught everywhere in this old world  
Go where hearts are plenty dont just drift with the tide  
Keep your lure in the water in the waters of life  
  
The lord said Simon haul your nets in  
From now on youre a fisher of men  
Well I like fishin  
Thats why it caught my ear  
The Lord knew how to get to me  
And what Id need to hear  
  
Keep your lure in the water dont just sit by the shore  
There are souls to be caught everywhere in this old world  
Go where hearts are plenty dont just drift with the tide  
Keep your lure in the water in the waters of life  
  
When the sea is troubled and its hard to stay afloat  
And you feel like Jesus is sleeping in the boat  
Dont you dare give up on the Prince of Peace  
And in the middle of the storm  
You will find a sweet release  
  
Keep your lure in the water dont just sit by the shore  
There are souls to be caught everywhere in this old world  
Go where hearts are plenty dont just drift with the tide  
Keep your lure in the water in the waters of life  
  
Yeah keep your lure in the water in the waters of life
