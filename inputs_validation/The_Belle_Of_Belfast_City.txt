Tell my ma when I go home  
The boys wont leave the girls alone  
They pulled my hair and stole my comb  
But thats all right till I go home  
She is handsome she is pretty  
She is the belle of Belfast city  
She is courting one two three  
Please wont you tell me who is she  
  
Albert Mooney says he loves her  
All the boys are fighting for her  
Knock on the door and they ring the bell  
Oh my true love are you well  
Here she comes as white as snow  
Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes  
Old Jenny Murray she says shell die  
If she doesnt get the fella with the roving eye  
  
Tell my ma when I go home  
The boys wont leave the girls alone  
They pulled my hair and stole my comb  
But thats all right till I go home  
She is handsome she is pretty  
She is the belle of Belfast city  
She is courting one two three  
Please wont you tell me who is she  
  
Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high  
And the snow come tumbling from the sky  
Shes as nice as apple pie  
Shell get her own lad by and by  
When she gets a lad of her own  
She wont tell her ma till she comes home  
Let the boys stay as they will  
For its Albert Mooney she loves still  
  
Tell my ma when I go home  
The boys wont leave the girls alone  
They pulled my hair and stole my comb  
But thats all right till I go home  
She is handsome she is pretty  
She is the belle of Belfast city  
She is courting one two three  
Please wont you tell me who is she
