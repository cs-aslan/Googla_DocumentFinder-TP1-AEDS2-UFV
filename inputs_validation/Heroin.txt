I dont know just where Im going  
But Im gonna try for the kingdom if I can  
Cause it makes me feel like Im a man  
When I put a spike into my vein  
And I tell you things arent quite the same  
  
When Im rushing on my run  
And I feel just like Jesus son  
And I guess that I just dont know  
And I guess that I just dont know  
  
I have made big decision  
Im gonna try to nullify my life  
Cause when the blood begins to flow  
When it shoots up the droppers neck  
When Im closing in on death  
  
You cant help me now you guys  
And all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk  
You can all go take a walk  
And I guess I just dont know  
And I guess that I just dont know  
  
I wish that I was born a thousand years ago  
I wish that Id sailed the darkened seas  
On a great big clipper ship  
Going from this land here to that  
In a sailors suit and cap  
  
Away from the big city  
Where a man cannot be free  
Of all the evils of this town  
And of himself and those around  
Oh and I guess that I just dont know  
Oh and I guess that I just dont know  
  
Heroin be the death of me  
Heroin its my wife and its my life  
Because a mainline into my vein  
Leads to a center in my head  
And then Im better off than dead  
  
Because when the smack begins to flow  
I really dont care anymore  
About all the JimJims in this town  
And all the politicians making crazy sounds  
And everybody putting everybody else down  
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds  
  
Cause when the smack begins to flow  
And I really dont care anymore  
Ah when that heroin is in my blood  
And that blood is in my head  
Then thank God that Im as good as dead  
And thank your God that Im not aware  
And thank God that I just dont care  
And I guess I just dont know  
Oh and I guess I just dont know
