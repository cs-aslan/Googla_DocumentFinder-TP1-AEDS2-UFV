Ive wandered around with nothing more than time on my hands  
I was lost in the night with no sight of you  
And at times it was so blue and lonely  
Heading for the light  
  
Been close to the edge hanging by my fingernails  
Ive rolled and Ive tumbled through the roses and the thorns  
And I couldnt see the sign that warned me Im  
Heading for the light  
  
Ooh  I didnt see that big black cloud hanging over me  
And when the rain came down I was nearly drowned  
I didnt know the mess I was in  
  
My shoes are wearing out from walking down this same highway  
I dont see nothing new but I feel a lot of change  
And I get the strangest feeling as Im  
Heading for the light  
  
Ooh  my hands were tired  
Jokers and fools on either side  
But still I kept on till the worst had gone  
Now I see the hole I was in  
  
My shoes are wearing out from walking down this same highway  
I dont see nothing new but I feel a lot of change  
And I get the strangest feeling as Im  
Heading for the light  
  
I see the sun ahead I aint never looking back  
All the dreams are coming true as I think of you  
Now theres nothing in the way to stop me  
Heading for the light  
  
Now theres nothing in the way to stop me  
Heading for the light
