First the good news  
Its gonna feel very nice  
Then the bad news  
You gotta pay a heavy price  
Rip tidewe slide we ride on a deep forbidden sea  
Under we goso slow  
And youre hanging onto me  
And I say  
Oh oh one more addiction in my world  
Oh one more connection to let go  
Oh floating down the river  
out of sight forever from my world  
Its the only thing I know how to do  
I reject you  
But I cant follow through  
Id forget you  
Bud youd end up tappin on my back door  
Somehow I lost myself  
In a tunnel long and black  
Somewhereat the endI pretend  
Theres a way of turning back  
Chorus  
Take a breath  
Let it out  
All the things you frown about are meaningless of courseunless youre  
doing this for real I guess  
I meant to to but  
I dont know what  
Is in the way and could I say  
Its you in bet  
I wont forget  
Maybe Im not ready yet  
Chorus
