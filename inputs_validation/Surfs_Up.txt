The waves are poundin on the sand tonight  
I want to take your hand and make it feel so right  
I know Im ready and Ill never be like this again  
And the sky is trembling and the moon is pale  
Were on the edge of forever and were never gonna fail  
I know youre ready and were runnin on the back of the wind  
  
Chorus  
And my body is burnin like a naked wire  
I want to turn on the juice I want to fall in the fire  
Im gonna drown in the ocean in a bottomless sea  
Im gonna give you what Im hopin youll be givin to me  
And when the waves are poundin on the sand tonight  
I want to take your hand and make it good and make it right  
Now the sky is trembling and the moon is pale  
Were on the edge of forever and were never gonna fail  
  
How hard how hard how hard do I gotta try I want all of your love  
Surfs up I need it so bad surfs up I need it so bad  
Surfs up and so am I I gotta give you some love  
Surfs up and so am I  
  
Chorus  
  
Surfs up and so am I surfs up and so am I
