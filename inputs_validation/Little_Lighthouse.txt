Shes a little lighthouse when she  
Opens up her huge eyes  
And streams of diamonds shoot out  
Til were wading waist deep in her brilliant love  
  
Shes a little lighthouse when she  
Opens up her red mouth  
And gold word ribbons rope and rodeo  
The dark clouds in bouquet above  
  
For how long will this dark age last  
For how long must we wait to learn  
Across the black and fossil ocean vast  
I spy love and she doth brightly burn  
Love sure lives in the right house  
  
Shes a little lighthouse when she  
Opens up her huge mind and  
Thoughts descending spears of crystal  
Build a Jacobs ladder up to love  
  
Shes a little lighthouse  
When she opens up her red dress  
Show skin of rubber marble  
Lit by knowledge and the fireflies above  
  
And can others see this splendid beam  
Or do they navigate in dark  
If you ever want to dock your dream  
Well youll need love to guide your fragile ark  
  
Love sure keeps a bright house  
Shes a little lighthouse
