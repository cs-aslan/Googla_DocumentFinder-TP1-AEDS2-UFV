I hear the motor running  
Burning up the road  
Tailpipesadraggin  
Fire in the smoke  
And I say Hell yeah  
I say Hell yeah  
Ooh shes a monster  
Take me on home  
This aint no joyride  
Do you wanna go  
This aint your Daddys Oldsmobile no  
I hear the beast acoming  
To get another load  
Of fire and brimstone  
Do you wanna go  
And I say  Hell yeah  
I say  Hell yeah  
Ooh its a monster  
Rolling me on home  
This aint no joyride  
No no oh  
Do we get a driver  
You bet your ass we do  
  
Tonight  Its all over now  
Ooh Hells just one mile down the road  
Goodbye  its all over now so long  
My Helldorados goin home  
  
Take me to Hell  
Cause Im going there  
Hot rods to Hell  
Helldorado  
Take me to Hell  
Im going where  
The Devils there  
In Helldorado
