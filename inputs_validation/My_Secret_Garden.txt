My secret gardens not so secret anymore  
Run from the house holding my head in my hands  
Feeling dejected feeling like a child might feel  
It all seems so absurd  
That this should have occurred  
My very only secret  
And I had to go and leak it  
My secret gardens not so secret anymore  
  
No my secret gardens not so secret anymore  
Run through the fields down to the edge of the water  
Cant stay long here comes the reason why  
Shell catch me if she can  
Take me by the hand  
Ill have to keep on running  
And I just cant see the fun in  
My secret garden not being secret anymore  
  
It used to be so easy  
On days such as these shed  
Search and search for hours  
In among the flowers  
I loved it I loved her  
Play the fool act so cruel I loved it  
Read her book take a look I loved her  
  
It all seems so absurd  
That this should have occurred  
My very only secret  
And I had to go and leak it  
My secret gardens not so secret anymore
