Easy come and easy go for me that was the fun  
It was something that I didnt think was so bad  
Now Im lookin out my window but I dont know where I am  
And Ive give up trying to understand what I cant  
  
I dont have any illusions anymore Ive done all that I can do  
  
Its not for me to know Its not for me to know  
Its not for me to know Its not for me to know  
  
I stood under the moonlight to illluminate myself  
Something I fell into from being kicked around  
  
I dont have any illusions anymore Ive done all that I can do  
  
Its not for me to know Its not for me to know  
Its not for me to know Its not for me to know  
  
No one seemed to notice seeing from smoke screen eyes  
  
You can get what you want but I dont think it is true  
  
I dont have any illusions anymore Ive done all that I can do  
  
Its not for me to know Its not for me to know  
Its not for me to know Its not for me to know  
  
Its not for me to know Its not for me to know
