Im a melancholy man thats what I am  
All the world surrounds me and my feet are on the ground  
Im a very lonely man doing what I can  
All the world astounds me and I think I understand  
That were going to keep growing wait and see  
  
When all the stars are falling down  
Into the sea and on the ground  
And angry voices carry on the wind  
A beam of light will fill your head  
And youll remember whats been said  
By all the good men this worlds ever known  
Another man is what youll see  
Who looks like you and looks like me  
And yet somehow he will not feel the same  
His life caught up in misery he doesnt think like you and me  
Cause he cant see what you and I can see
