Out of the rain under the shelter  
Ive been so long where the sun dont shine  
Standing at the crossroads could have went either way  
But now Ive found you and the storm is behind  
  
Out of the rain out of the rain  
  
Over the wall Im out in the open  
Back on the right tracks Im feeling no pain  
You took a sparrow and let it fly with the eagles  
I can see a long ways I feel love again  
  
Out of the rain out of the rain  
  
There was a time I was taking no prisoners  
Standing with a cold hear standing alone  
It took your sweet love to pull me out of the canyon  
I believe I can make it now I feel like I belong  
  
Out of the rain out of the rain  
Out of the rain out of the rain
