They say that the night life  
They say it aint no good life  
But its my life  
  
Ive been a gambler  
Ive been a thief  
And most of my good friends  
They dont hold with my belief  
  
They say that the night life  
They say it aint no good life  
Oh but buy you know that its my life  
  
And if youve had troubles  
If youve felt them woes  
I dont have to tell you  
How this whole world is so low  
  
Hey now baby  
It can drive you crazy  
Oh but baby  
Baby the night lifes for me  
  
Just one more time  
Ill hit the road  
And I want to thank you  
I want to thank the Lord  
  
For that old night life  
Some say it aint no good life  
But baby baby  
There aint nothing like this night life
