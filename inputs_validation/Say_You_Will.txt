Why would she make calls out the blue  
Now Im awake sleep isnt new  
  
Hey hey hey hey  
Dont say you will  
Unless you will  
Hey hey hey hey  
Dont say you will  
Then play you will  
i pray you will  
  
Mrs So Fly crash lands in my room  
Cant waste no time she might leave soon  
  
Hey hey hey hey  
Dont say you will  
Hey hey hey hey  
Dont say you will  
You will you will  
Hey hey hey hey  
Dont say you will  
If you will  
I pray you will  
  
Wish this song would really come true  
I admit I still fantasize about you about you  
  
Hey hey hey hey  
Dont say you will  
You will you will  
Hey hey hey hey  
Please say you will  
For real  
I pray you will
