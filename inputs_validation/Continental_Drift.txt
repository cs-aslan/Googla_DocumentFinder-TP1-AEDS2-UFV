Love comes at the speed of light  
Love comes at the speed of light  
Love comes in a strange disguise  
Love comes  
  
Open the door and let the light pour over  
Open the door dont you keep me out  
Open the door and let the light pour over  
Hear me shout  
  
Open the door and let the light pour over  
Open the door dont you keep me out  
Open the door and let the light pour over  
  
Love comes at the speed of light  
Love comes  
  
Its a pure as silver  
Its as pure as gold  
Its a rushing river  
Let it run all over me  
  
Its as pure as silver  
Its as pure as gold  
Let it run all over me  
  
Love comes  
Love comes at the speed of light  
Love comes at the speed of light
