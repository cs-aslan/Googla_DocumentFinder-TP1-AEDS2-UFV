Oh the time will come up when the winds will stop  
And the breeze will cease to be breathin  
Like the stillness in the wind fore the hurricane begins  
The hour when the ship comes in  
Oh the seas will split and the ship will hit  
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking  
Then the tide will sound and the wind will pound  
And the morning will be breaking  
Oh the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path  
And the seagulls theyll be smiling  
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand  
The hour that the ship comes in  
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused  
Will not be understood as theyre spoken  
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night  
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean  
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts  
And the boat that drifts on to the shore line  
And the sun will respect every face on the deck  
The hour that the ship comes in  
Then the sands will roll out a carpet of gold  
For your weary toes to be a touchin  
And the ships wise men will remind you once again  
That the whole wide world is watchin  
The foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes  
Jerk from their beds and think theyre still dreamin  
But theyll pinch themselves and squeal and know that its for real  
The hour that the ship comes in  
Then theyll raise their hands sayin well meet all your demands  
Well shout from the bow your days are numbered  
And like Pharaohs tribe theyll be drowned in the tide  
And like Goliath theyll be conquered yeah
