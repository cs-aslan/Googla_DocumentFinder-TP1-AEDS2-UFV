Ive got myself  
In a masochistic hold  
Why dont you let go  
Shake it off  
Just to redirect my flow  
Come on lets go  
  
Sit up straight  
Im on a double date  
Ive got to find my way  
Into the light heavy middle weight  
We dont stop rock around the clock  
Motor mouthing off  
In front of every other road block  
  
Come again and tell me  
What youre going through  
Like a girl who only knew  
Her child was due  
  
Memories of everything  
Of lemon trees on mercury  
Come to me with remedies  
From five or six of seven seas  
You always took me with a smile  
When I was down  
Memories of everything  
That blew through  
  
Looking up into  
A reverse vertigo  
What an undertow  
Give it up  
Another stubborn scorpio  
Come on lets go  
  
Sit up straight  
Im on a double date  
Ive got to find my way  
Into the light heavy middle weight  
We dont stop rock around the clock  
Motor mouthing off  
In front of every other road block  
  
Come again and tell me  
What youre going through  
Like a girl who only knew  
Her child was due  
To the moon she gave  
Another good review  
Turn around and look at me  
Its really really you
