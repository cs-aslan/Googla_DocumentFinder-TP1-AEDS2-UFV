Oh Davy you may have many words  
And many thoughts for youre near  
Youre so like a star upon me  
So like a star upon me  
To be one in your garden  
Humming humming humming  
  
Oh Davy you may have many words  
And many songs for youre near  
Youre so like a star upon me  
So like a star upon me  
To be one in your garden  
Humming humming humming  
  
Oh Davy you may have many words  
And many songs for youre near  
Youre so like a star upon me  
So like a star upon me  
To be one in your garden  
Humming humming humming
