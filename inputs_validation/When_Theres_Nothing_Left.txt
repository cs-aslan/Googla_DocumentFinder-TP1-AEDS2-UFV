When theres nothing  
Left to give  
I will give you more  
Than I ever gave before  
When theres nothing  
Left left to say  
Ill say it all again  
But until then  
  
And Ill give you my heart  
Say I love you  
Say I love you  
And Ill give you my heart  
Say I love you  
Oh cause I do Jesus  
  
No music to play  
So I sing you my own song  
Come on and sing along  
When theres nothing that remains  
You still stay the same  
Youre looking so strong  
  
CHORUS  
  
When theres nothing left to give  
I will give you more  
Than I ever gave before
