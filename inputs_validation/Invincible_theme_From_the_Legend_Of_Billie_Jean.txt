Simon Climie Holly Knight  
This bloody road remains a mystery this sudden darkness fills the air  
Whatre we waitin for Wont anybody help us whatre we waitin for  
  
Chorus  
We cant afford to be innocent stand up and face the enemy  
Its a do or die situation we will be invincible  
  
This shattered dream you cannot justify  
Were gonna scream until were satisfied  
Whatre we runnin for Weve got the right to be angry  
Whatre we runnin for when theres nowhere we can run to anymore  
  
Chorus  
  
And with the power of conviction there is no sacrifice  
Its a do or die situation we will be invincible  
  
Wont anybody help us whatre we runnin for  
When theres nowhere nowhere we can run to anymore  
  
Chorus  
  
And with the power of conviction there is no sacrifice  
Its a do or die situation we will be invincible  
  
Repeat Chorus
