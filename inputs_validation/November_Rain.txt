When I look into your eyes  
I can see a love restrained  
But darlin when I hold you  
Dont you know I feel the same  
  
Nothin lasts forever  
And we both know hearts can change  
And its hard to hold a candle  
In the cold November rain  
  
Weve been through this such a long long time  
Just tryin to kill the pain oo yeah  
But love is always coming and love is always going  
And no ones really sure whos lettin go today  
Walking away  
  
If we could take the time  
To lay it on the line  
I could rest my head  
Just knowin that you were mine  
All mine  
So if you want to love me  
Then darlin dont refrain  
Or Ill just end up walkin  
In the cold November rain  
  
Do you need some time on your own  
Do you need some time all alone  
Everybody needs some time  
On their own  
Dont you know you need some time all alone  
  
I know its hard to keep an open heart  
When even friends seem out to harm you  
But if you could heal a broken heart  
Wouldnt time be out to charm you  
  
Sometimes I need some time on my  
Own  
Sometimes I need some time all alone  
Everybody needs some time  
On their own  
Dont you know you need some time all alone  
  
And when your fears subside  
And shadows still remain oh yeah  
I know that you can love me  
When theres no one left to blame  
So never mind the darkness  
We still can find a way  
Cause nothin lasts forever  
Even cold November rain  
  
Dont ya think that you need somebody  
Dont ya think that you need someone  
Everybody needs somebody  
Youre not the only one  
Youre not the only one  
  
Dont ya think that you need somebody  
Dont ya think that you need someone  
Everybody needs somebody  
Youre not the only one  
Youre not the only one  
  
Dont ya think that you need somebody  
Dont ya think that you need someone  
Everybody needs somebody  
Youre not the only one  
Youre not the only one  
  
Dont ya think that you need somebody  
Dont ya think that you need someone  
Everybody needs somebody
