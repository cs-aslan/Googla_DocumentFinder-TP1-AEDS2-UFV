I wish I could cross my arms and cross your mind  
Cause I believe youd unfold your paper heart and wear it on your sleeve  
All my life I wish I broke mirrors instead of promises  
Cause all I see is a shattered conscience staring right back at me  
I wish I had covered all my tracks completely  
Cause Im so afraid is that the light at the far end of the tunnel or just
the train  
Lift your arms only heaven knows where the danger grows  
And its safe to say theres a bright light up ahead and help is on the way  
  
I forget the last time I felt brave I just recall insecurity  
Cause it came down like a tidal wave and sorrow swept over me  
  
Depression please cut to the chase and cut a long story short  
Oh please be done how much longer can this drama afford to run  
Fate looks sharp severs all my ties and breaks whatever doesnt bend  
But sadly then all my heavy hopes just pull me back down again  
  
I forget the last time I felt brave I just recall insecurity  
Cause it came down like a tidal wave and sorrow swept over me  
Then I was given grace and love  
I was blind but now I can see  
Cause Ive found a new hope from above  
And courage swept over me  
  
It hurts just to wake up whenever youre wearing thin  
Alone on the outside  
So tired of looking in  
The end is uncertain  
And Ive never been so afraid  
But I dont need a telescope to see that theres hope  
And that makes me feel brave
