Every morning when I wake up yawning  
Im still far away  
Trucks still rolling through the early morning  
To the place we play  
Boy youre home youre dreaming dont you know  
The tours still far away  
Boy youre home youre dreaming dont you know  
Youre having just a break  
Dream were going out on stage it feels like  
Coming home again  
Dream were going out on stage it feels like  
Coming home again  
Dream were going out on stage it feels like  
Coming home again  
Its great to be here to see you all  
I know for me it is like  
Coming home  
Day after day out on the road  
Theres no place too far that we wouldnt go  
We go wherever you like  
To rock n roll  
Jump on the seats put your hands in the air  
Give me a shout let me hear youre out there  
The wilder you scream for some more rock n roll  
The higher well go  
Year after year out on the road  
Its great to be here to rock you all  
I know for me it is like  
Coming home  
Like coming home
