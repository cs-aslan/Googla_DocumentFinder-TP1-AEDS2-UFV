Listen girl you want me but he needs you  
Yet youre tellin me that everything is cool  
Tryin to convince me baby to do as you say  
Just go along and see things your way  
  
1  And keep it on the down low  
Nobody has to know  
We can keep it on the down low  
Nobody has to know  
  
Secret lovers is what you wanna be  
While making love to him girl youre silently calling on me  
What is a man to do in a situation like this  
I feel there is something that I dont wanna miss  
  
Repeat 1  
Repeat 1  
  
Beautiful you are but youre his by far  
Comin by my way drivin his fancy car  
Making plans to be in my life forever  
Tell me tell me that well always be together  
  
Repeat 1  
Repeat 1  
  
Listen babe I wont whisper a word
