Hey  what you going to do now  
Youre standing there and wondering how  
Youve got to make some noise  
Just like one of the girls  
Or even one of the boys  
  
When you do it  
It aint no disgrace  
I can see it written all across your face  
Neon shuffle and shuffle into outer dpace  
I said  neon shuffle is a dance for the human race  
I said  neon shuffle is gonna pull you outta your place  
  
You  you put your hands together  
Better make up a storm  
Or some electricky weather  
Now that the powers stop  
Can you click your heels  
Can you finger pop  
  
Neon shuffle  
  
Neon shuffle its going to do it to me  
Neon shuffle its going to do it to you  
Neon shuffle its going to do it with red  
Neon shuffle its going to do it with blue  
Neon shuffle its going to run you right through  
Neon shuffle with a stick of bamboo
