I want action tonight  
Satisfaction all night  
  
I grab my hat and I  
Grab my shoes  
Tonight Im gonna hit  
The streets and cruise  
  
Down the main strip and  
Check it out  
With those schoolgirls  
A hangin around  
  
Now Im a sucker for a pretty face  
I dont care if shes in leather or lace  
Cause Im just lookin for a little kiss  
  
Chorus  
I want action tonight  
Satisfaction all night  
Youve got the love I need tonight  
  
Long legs and short skirts  
These girls hit me where it hurts  
  
I cant wait to get my hands on them  
I wont give up until they give in  
  
Now Im not lookin for a love that lasts  
I need a shot and I need it fast  
If I cant have her Ill take her and make her  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey sweetheart slide on in here  
No not in the front jump in the back  
Why  
Cause theres something back there I want to show ya  
I want action tonight  
Satisfaction all night  
Ah come on honey I wasnt that bad  
Oh well  
  
Chorus
