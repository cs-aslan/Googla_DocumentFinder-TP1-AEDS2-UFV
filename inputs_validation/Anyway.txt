If you love me wont you call me  
Ive been waiting waiting to long  
In my soul is constant yearning  
Always singing singing this song  
  
Only love is strong enough to take it on the chin  
When did I begin to fall  
  
Anyway anyway you can make that call  
You feel free to make yourself at home  wohoh ahhhhhh ohhhhh  
  
If we could be closer longer  
That would help me help me so much  
We can cure each others sorrow  
Wont you please please please get in touch  
  
If our love is strong enough it may never end  
Why would I pretend to fall wooew  
  
Anyway anyway you can make that call  
You feel free to make yourself at home  wohoh ahhhhhh  
  
Anyway anyway anyway at all  
Anyway you can make that call
