Were walking the streets  
We know where well meet  
  
Cant stop us  
They dont know why they try  
Cant hurt us  
Well never die  
  
We are on the march of the damned  
Of the damned  
March of the damned  
  
We know whats at stake  
Wont take your mistakes  
  
Cant break us  
Well never fall thats all  
Its over  
Just watch us grow  
  
We are on the march of the damned  
Of the damned  
March of the damned  
  
Were walking the streets  
We know where well meet  
  
Cant stop us  
They dont know why they try  
Cant hurt us  
Well never die  
  
We are on the march of the damned  
  
Of the damned  
  
March of the damned
