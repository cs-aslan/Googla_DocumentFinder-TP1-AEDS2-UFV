Five little monsters were riding through space  
Their spaceship broke and they fell into this place  
They gotta get out but they dont know how  
So theyre waiting and waiting in a creepy creepy house  
The whole human race is already pretty loony  
But the ones who move in this house are gonna go boony  
Monsters live on tv never in the zoo  
Hang around with us and youll be a monster too  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men  
Poor old stereo he aint sure just what he knows  
Etno is intelligent hes quite a superhead  
Gorgious is a great big guy but hes fat from too much pie  
Bud is cool of course its true but hes a tv fool  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men  
Candy is the sweetest one cleans and cooks and acts like mom  
All of them are going nutz their spaceships on the futz  
The human race gets in their face gotta drive the from this place  
Of course theyve got smtv nightmares for the family  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men  
Gotta get and ride home baby gotta get and ride now  
Gotta get and ride home baby but they dont know how  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men
