Who do we think we are  
Baby tell me who do we think we are  
  
We cant run out of magic  
Its the only way we know  
Lets trip the night fantastic  
Light it up til we both explode  
We love we love we love the stars  
We could fall so hard  
The drinks the minks the jewels the house the cars  
Whyd we ball so hard  
Yeah and I Im not afraid to fly  
Here we are in the air barely breathing  
And were not afraid to die  
  
Who do we think we are  
Baby tell me who do we think we are  
Who do we think we are  
Baby tell me who do we think we are  
  
Weve got a lot of nerve girl  
We walk around here like we own this place  
  
See my jewels dripping on my Timberlands  
Stepping like a criminal success is so imminent  
Pink champagne black Rolls Royce  
Eggplant doublebreasted suit from Tom Ford  
Bon voyage left haters in the fog  
Look up in the sky bet you recognize a boss  
Look into my eyes as I fantasize for us  
Still actin shy like this is summer class crush  
Money comin fast Im never in a rush no  
Plus another twenty in a tuck  
Semi in a truck another forty on the wrist  
Quartermill on my mind got me livin like I pitch  
Dodging Robin Givens boiling like Im Roger Clemens  
Still in the game uniform all linen  
She get Chanel ski trips to Vail  
Only the highest grade like trees that I inhale  
  
And I Im not afraid to fly  
Here we are in the air barely breathing  
And were not afraid to die  
Who do we think we are  
Baby tell me who do we think we are  
Who do we think we are  
Oh baby tell me who do we think we are  
  
Who do we think we are  
I dont know about yall but I feel good tonight  
Theres something in the air tonight  
You know everyone needs someone to look up to  
Why shouldnt it be us  
Who do we think we are  
Tell me who do we think we are  
Who do we think we are  
Tell me who do we think we are
