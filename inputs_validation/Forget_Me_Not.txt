Forget me not  
Baby baby  
As I rock you gently  
Right here in my arms  
I promise to always  
Be here for you  
Keep you safe and warm  
  
Sometimes in the middle of the night  
I wake up cryin when I think of how long  
It took to find you  
And now that I have I wont be movin on  
Nothing can ever separate us  
We know where we belong  
  
All Im asking you  
All Im asking  
Before this moments gone  
  
Forget me not  
Dont forget what we got  
Every day is surely but a dream  
I found the sweetest of all things  
For all my life  
Youll be my light  
With every beat thats in your heart  
Oh baby please remember to  
Forget me not  
  
Time is funny  
Time can fly  
Thats one thing for sure  
Ill wake tomorrow  
Blink my eyes  
See you standin at that door  
  
And Ill be lookin at you  
See the wonder of what love can be  
Someday I might have to let you go  
And thats just so hard to believe  
And if I do youll know just  
How much you mean to me  
And all Ill ask of you  
All Ill ask you  
Before I set you free  
  
Forget me not  
Dont forget what we got  
Every day is surely but a dream  
I found the sweetest of all things  
For all my life  
Youll be my light  
With every beat thats in your heart  
Oh baby please remember to  
Forget me not  
  
Forget me not  
Forget me not  
Forget me  
  
Dont forget me baby  
Forget me

Before I set you free yeah  
  
Forget me not  
Forget me  
Dont forget what we got  
What we got  
Every day is surely but a dream  
I found the sweetest of all things  
For ever more  
Connection  
Ill thee adore  
With every beat thats in your heart  
Thats in my heart  
Oh baby please remember to  
Forget me not  
  
Dont forget what we got  
With every beat thats in your heart  
Oh baby please remember to
