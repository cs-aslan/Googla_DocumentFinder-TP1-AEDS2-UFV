Weve all seen a man at the liquor store beggin for your change  
The hair on his face is dirty dreadlocked and full of mange  
He asks a man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes  
Get a job you fucking slob is all he replies  
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes  
Cause then you really might know what its like to sing the blues  
  
Chorus  
Then you really might know what its like  
Then you really might know what its like  
Then you really might know what its like  
Then you really might know what its like  
  
Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom that said he was in love  
He said Dont worry about a thing baby doll  
Im the man youve been dreaming of  
But three months later he say he wont date her or return her calls  
And she swear God damn if I find that man Im cuttin off his balls  
And then she heads for the clinic and  
She gets some static walking through the door  
They call her a killer and they call her a sinner  
And they call her a whore  
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes  
Cause then you really might know what its like to have to choose  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive seen a rich man beg  
Ive seen a good man sin  
Ive seen a tough man cry  
Ive seen a loser win  
And a sad man grin  
I heard an honest man lie  
Ive seen the good side of bad  
And the downside of up  
And everything between  
I licked the silver spoon  
Drank from the golden cup  
And smoked the finest green  
I stroked the fattest dimes at least a couple of times  
Before I broke their heart  
You know where it ends yo it usually depends on where you start  
  
I knew this kid named Max  
Who used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs  
He liked to hang out late  
He liked to get shitfaced and keep the pace with thugs  
Until late one night there was a big gun fight and Max lost his head  
He pulled out his chrome 45 talked some shit and wound up dead  
Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of this pain  
You know it comes that way  
At least thats what they say when you play the game  
God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news  
Cause then you really might know what its like to have to lose  
  
Then you really might know what its like  
Then you really might know what its like  
Then you really might know what its liketo have to lose
