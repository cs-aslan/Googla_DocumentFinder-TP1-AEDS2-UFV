Out of the winter came a war horse of steel  
Ive never killed a woman before but I know how it feels  
I know youd have gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now Ive got to look for sanctuary from the law  
  
I met up with a stranger last night to keep me alive  
He spends all his money on gambling and guns to survive  
I know youd gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now Ive got to look for Sanctuary from the law  
  
So give me sanctuary from the law and Ill be alright  
Just give me sanctuary from the law and love me tonight tonight  
I know youd have gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now Ive got to look for sanctuary from the law  
So give me sanctuary from the law and Ill be alright  
Just give me sanctuary from the law and love me tonight tonight  
  
I can laugh at the wind I can howl at the rain  
Down in the canyon or out in the plain  
  
I know youd have gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now Ive got to look for sanctuary from the law  
  
So give me sanctuary from the law and Ill be alright  
Just give me sanctuary from the law and love me tonight tonight
