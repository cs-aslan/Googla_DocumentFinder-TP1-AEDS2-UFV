Im high high high as a kite  
Im high high high as a kite  
And I just might try and do it tonight  
But only when the time is right  
  
Im low low low as you go  
Im low though Ive been here before  
If I go any lower you know  
Im gonna tell you that the time is right  
  
I thought today the grey would all go away  
That the blue was there so roses were red  
But instead the red has gone to his bed  
Oh no  
  
Im high high high as a kite  
Im high high high as a kite  
And I just might try and do it tonight  
But only when the time is right  
  
Yeah I just might try and do it tonight  
But only when the time is right
