My heart is taken its not lost in space  
And I dont want to see your mooney mooney face  
I say why on earth do you revolve around me  
Arent you aware of the gravity  
Dont need another satellite  
  
Im happy standing on my feet of clay  
I have no wish to swim your Milky Milky Way  
I say why on earth do you send your letters round here  
Only to gum up the atmosphere  
Dont need another satellite  
  
So circling well orbit another year  
Two worlds that wont collide  
So circling well orbit another year  
Moon still tries to steal the tide away  
  
Dont need another satellite  
Dont need another satellite  
  
Abort your mission lets just say you tried  
Before you glimpse I have a darker darker side  
I say why in Heavens name do you come on these trips  
Only to freeze in a total eclipse  
Dont need another satellite  
  
So circling well orbit another year  
Two worlds that wont collide  
So circling well orbit another year  
Moon still tries to steal the tide away  
Dont need another satellite  
Dont need another satellite dont need another satellite
