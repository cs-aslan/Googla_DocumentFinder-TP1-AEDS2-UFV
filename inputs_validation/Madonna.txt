Hook  
Breathe through ride through damn girl  
Oh man I dont know  
Pilled up filled up damn girl  
Ill be getting back to you for sure man man  
Laced up dripped up sauced up  
Damn girl I wanna ride with you  
Waved up blowing up blowing up growing up  
Had to get it popping with you  
  
Verse 1  
What if I pick you up from your house  
We should get out  
We havent talked in a while  
We should roll to see where it goes  
I saw potential in you from the go  
You know that I did  
I dont know if you know but I know who you are  
You could be big as Madonna  
Just get in the car and lets touch the road  
Dont make other plans  
Say you get up early you work for the man  
Well hell understand  
Pull up Im pulling up on you in ten  
Already on ten  
Big as Madonna Ill say it again  
Soon as you get in nah nah nah
