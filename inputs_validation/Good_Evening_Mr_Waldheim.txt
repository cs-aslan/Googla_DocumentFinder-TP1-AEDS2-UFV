Good evening MrWaldheim  
and Pontiff how are you  
You have so much in common  
in the things you do  
  
And here comes Jesse Jackson  
he talks of Common Ground  
does that Common Ground include me  
or is it just a sound  
  
A sound that shakes  
oh Jesse you must watch the sounds you make  
  
A sound that quakes  
there are fears that still reverberate  
  
Jesse you say Common Ground  
does that include the PLO  
what about people right here right now  
who fought for you not so long ago  
  
The words that flow so freely  
falling dancing from your lips  
I hope that you dont cheapen them  
with a racist slip  
  
Oh Common Ground  
is Common Ground a word or just a sound  
Common Ground  
remember those civil rights workers buried in the ground  
  
If I ran for President  
and once was a member of the Klan  
wouldnt you call me on it  
the way I call you on Farrakhan  
  
And Pontiff pretty Pontiff  
can anyone shake your hand   
or is it just that you like uniforms  
and someone kissing your hand  
  
Or is it true  
the Common Ground for me includes you too  
  
Oh oh is it true  
the Common Ground for me includes you too  
  
Good evening MrWaldheim  
pontiff how are you  
as you both stroll through the woods at night  
Im thinking thoughts of you  
  
And Jesse youre inside my thoughts  
as the rhythmic words subside  
my Common Ground invites you in  
or do you prefer to wait outside  
  
Or is it true  
the Common Ground for me is without you  
  
Or is it true  
the Common Ground for me is without you  
  
Oh is it true  
theres no Ground Common enough for me and you
