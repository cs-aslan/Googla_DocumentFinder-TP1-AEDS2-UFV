All our times have come  
Here but now theyre gone  
Seasons dont fear the reaper  
Nor do the wind the sun or the rain  
We can be like they are  
  
Come on baby dont fear the reaper  
Baby take my hand dont fear the reaper  
Well be able to fly dont fear the reaper  
Baby Im your man  
  
Valentine is done  
Here but now theyre gone  
Romeo and Juliet  
Are together in eternity  
Romeo and Juliet  
  
Forty thousand men and women everyday like romeo and Juliet  
Forty thousand men and women everyday redefine happiness  
Another forty thousand coming everyday we can be like  
They are  
  
Come on baby dont fear the reaper  
Baby take my hand dont fear the reaper  
Well be able to fly dont fear the reaper  
Baby Im your man love of two is one  
Here but now theyre gone  
Came the last night of sadness  
And it was clear we couldnt go on  
Then the door was opened and the wind appeared  
The candles blew then disappeared  
The curtains flew then he appeared  
Saying dont be afraid  
  
Come on babyand we had no fear  
And we ran to him and we started to fly  
We looked backward and said goodbye  
We had become like they are  
We had taken his hand  
We had become like they are  
  
Come on baby dont fear the reaper
