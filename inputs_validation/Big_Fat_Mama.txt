Say you need me say you need me  
Tell me that you want my love  
Say you will be mine and I am yours  
You think that youre way above me  
Im telling you that I can see  
All those things that you might wanna be  
I am yours tonight  
You be mine tonight  
  
You keep telling me youre not having me  
Im telling you that I can see  
All the things that you might wanna be  
Say you need me say you need me  
Tell me that you want my love  
Say will be mine and I am yours  
I am yours tonight  
You be mine tonight  
  
I got a big fat Mama  
With a big fat boy  
Really thinks shes something else  
But I love that woman  
Like fish loves the water  
And there is nobody else  
Im gonna tell you woman better do as youre told  
If you dont Im gonna bring you down  
Ive got a big fat Mama  
And theres no one else around  
  
I said say you need me  
Come on and say you need me  
I said say you need me  
  
Say you need me  
Come on and say you need me  
I said say you need me
