I never been too good at doin right  
Done mostly wrong most all my life  
Never found a place to settle down  
But baby I do believe I found it now  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna walk that line  
Gonna tote that barge  
Gonna lift that bale  
Gonna work real hard  
Doin anything that you want me to  
cause baby Im gonna walk that line for you  
  
Ooooh gonna walk that line for you  
  
If strait an narrow ever was my path  
And everlasting love never seemed to last  
Used to be a tomcat out on the prowl  
But baby Im just your puppy dawg now  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooooh gonna walk that line for you  
Ooooh gonna walk that line for you  
Do anything that you want me to  
Ooooh gonna walk that line for you
