In the moment I first saw you  
I could swear that we had met  
The look in your eye  
Was so familiar  
Where and when I forget  
  
Whispered your name in introduction  
Darling my heart filled the room  
And I knew it was you come back in my life  
  
So we meet again my long lost friend  
Once again we get to start anew  
And it feels like a thousand years  
Ive been loving you  
  
Girl have you been waiting here for someone near  
Searchin the world for a friend  
Come on in Ive been expecting you  
Sweet reunion welcome home again  
  
How many lifetimes have I loved you  
How many times have you loved me  
The sound of your voice is in my memory  
Like the wind on the sea  
  
The glow of your heart has been my lighthouse  
Ive followed it in from distant shores  
Now I wont be afraid to love anymore  
  
So we meet again my long lost friend  
Once again we get to start anew  
And it feels like a thousand years  
Ive been loving you  
  
Girl have you been waiting here for someone near  
Searchin the world for a friend  
Come on in Ive been expecting you  
Sweet reunion welcome home again  
  
Whatever happens nothings ever going to be the same  
Now youll find me here at last  
Your loves released me from the past  
My heart and soul have always remembered your name  
  
Girl have you been waiting here for someone near  
Searchin the world for a friend  
Come on in Ive been expecting you  
Sweet reunion welcome home again  
  
Ive always been loving you  
  
Girl have you been waiting here for someone near  
Searchin the world for a friend  
Come on in Ive been expecting you  
Sweet reunion welcome home again
