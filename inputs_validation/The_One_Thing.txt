As Im looking back in time  
My heart was young and the world was mine  
Driven by desires blind  
I remember someone told me as the years roll by  
Remember one thing the one thing  
People come and people go  
The way the winds of fortune blow  
So hard to find that heart of gold  
I remember someone told me  
When you find it dont let go  
  
Chorus  
Youre the one thing youre the one thing baby  
Makes this world heaven  
Makes the whole thing right  
Youre the one thing  
That means something baby  
The one I believe in  
The one thing I need in my life  
  
As I look into your lovin eyes  
There aint no doubt just where my treasure lies  
Ive searched the earth for somethin true  
But the only truth that matters is my love for you  
  
And thats the one thing the one thing  
Timeless as the stars faithful as the sea  
Like the endless risin sun I know youll be there for me  
Theres so much love inside this heart of mine could break  
Cause I know Ive found forever and with every breath I take  
  
Chorus  
  
And your love is like a rainbow  
In a world thats black and white  
You paint my dreams in color  
And in your arms they come alive  
Youre my every inspiration  
Youre the wings that make me fly  
Youre my only destination  
Youre the one thing the one thing in my life oh  
Youre the one thing youre the one thing baby  
  
Chorus
