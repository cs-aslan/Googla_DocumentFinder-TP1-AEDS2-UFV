You might think there some big reason  
Why I took this time to write  
The cards and letters theres been to few of those  
But I just stopped to realize  
How long that Ive been gone  
But theres a few small things I need to know  
  
Dear Daddy do the whipperwill still echo through the night  
Does the sound of silence squeeze the morning light  
And have you caught the big one in the pond just down the road  
I miss you so  
  
Well years keep slipping by me  
Like miles out on the road  
But I dont guess Ill change my way of life  
Theres no harm in holding memories  
But please tell me if you can  
If I can bring those old times inside  
  
Dear Mama can you still find the dipper in the stars  
Do the roads still go for hours without cars  
Does the frost still shine on the grass outside the door  
Just like before  
Tell me more  
  
Is Sis still planning marriage sometime soon  
Can you still reach out and touch the moon  
Do old songs still ring out through the hills for days and days  
  
Love always
