How high the sky goes  
Nobody wants to know  
Thats how your love seemed to grow  
Like the winter gives birth to spring  
Youve become my everything  
And in my life it must show  
  
Chorus  
Keep it comin keep it comin  
Keep it comin keep it comin  
Comin comin straight to me  
  
I find with no one else  
I could express myself  
You took the time and looked in my mind  
  
Like mysteries untold Im starting to unfold  
You reached the limits of my soul  
  
Chorus  
Keep it comin keep it comin  
Keep it comin keep it comin  
Comin comin straight to me  
  
How high the sky goes  
Nobody wants to know  
Thats how your love seemed to grow  
Just like the world keeps going round and round  
And we never fall off the ground  
Like gravity your love is pullin me  
  
Chorus  
Keep it comin keep it comin  
Keep it comin keep it comin  
Comin comin straight to me
