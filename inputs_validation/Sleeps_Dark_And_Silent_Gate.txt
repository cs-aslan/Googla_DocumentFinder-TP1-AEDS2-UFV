Sometimes I lie awake at night and wonder  
Where my life will lead me  
Waiting to pass under sleeps dark and silent gate  
  
I found my love too late  
Running around day after day  
Looking for the time to play  
While my old friends slipped away  
  
Never shoulda had to try so hard  
To make a love work out I guess  
I dont know what love has got to do with happiness  
But the times when we were happy  
Were the times we never tried  
  
Sitting down by the highway  
Looking down the road  
Waiting for a ride  
I dont know where Ive been  
Wishing I could fly away  
Dont know where Im going  
Wishing I could hide  
Oh God this is some shape Im in  
When the only thing that makes me cry  
Is the kindness in my babys eyes  
  
Sometimes I lie awake at night and wonder  
Where the years have gone  
They have all passed under  
Sleeps dark and silent gate
