If this isnt what you see  
It doesnt make you blind  
If this doesnt make you feel  
It doesnt mean youve died  
Where the rivers high  
Where the rivers high  
  
If you dont want to be seen  
Well you dont have to hide  
And if you dont want to believe  
Well you dont have to try  
To feel alive  
  
Yeah  
  
Chorus  
Alive in the superunknown  
Alive in the superunknown  
Alive in the superunknown  
First it steals your mind  
And then it steals your soul  
  
If this doesnt make you free  
It doesnt mean youre tied  
If this doesnt take you down  
It doesnt mean youre high  
If this doesnt make you smile  
You dont have to cry  
If this isnt making sense  
It doesnt make it lies  
  
Chorus  
  
Get yourself afraid  
Get yourself alone  
Get yourself contained  
Get yourself control  
  
Chorus
