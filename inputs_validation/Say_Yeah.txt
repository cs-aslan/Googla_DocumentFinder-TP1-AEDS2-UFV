I didnt call this meeting and  
I never heard such beating around  
Around the bush and  
You cant commit to something so  
  
You wont come up with nothing at all  
Unless youre pushed  
But I wanna get this straightened out  
Im getting tired of waiting  
  
When I say when will you lay your love down for me  
Dont say what  
When I say why wont you put out something for me  
Dont say what say yeah  
  
We had a good thing going but  
We never did quite know what it was  
But it was good so  
Why dont we just start over and  
  
Maybe I can help you lower your guard  
I think we should  
But you gotta stop resisting me  
I wanna get some kissing  
  
I dont believe in magic but  
You could avert a tragedy here  
I got to say that  
I think youve got the power and  
  
You know the final hour has come  
So dont delay cause  
I wanna get this straightened out  
Im getting tired of waiting
