Making somebody happy is a question of give and take  
You can learn how to show it so come on give yourself a break  
Every smile and every little touch  
Dont you know that they mean so much  
Sweet sweet kisses so tender  
Always will return to sender  
  
Like a bang a boomaboomerang  
Dumbbedumbdumb bedumbbedumbdumb  
Oh bang a boomaboomerang  
Love is a tune you humdehumhum  
By giving away I think youll learn  
Youll get love in return  
So bang a boomaboomerang is love  
A boomaboomerang is love  
  
Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere  
When you feel that youve found it my advice is to take good care  
Never use it as a selfish tool  
Never ever be such a fool  
Every feeling youre showing  
Is a boomerang youre throwing  
  
Yes a bang a boomaboomerang  
Dumbbedumbdumb bedumbbedumbdumb  
Oh bang a boomaboomerang  
Love is a tune you humdehumhum  
By giving away I think youll learn  
Youll get love in return  
So bang a boomaboomerang is love  
  
And if youre warm and tender  
Ill kiss you return to sender  
Please surrender  
  
Bang a boomaboomerang  
Dumbbedumbdumb bedumbbedumbdumb  
Oh bang a boomaboomerang is love  
A boomaboomerang is love
