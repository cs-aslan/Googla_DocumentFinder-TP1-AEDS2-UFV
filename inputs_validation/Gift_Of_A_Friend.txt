Sometimes you think youll be fine by yourself  
Cause a dream is a wish you make all alone  
Its easy to feel like you dont need help  
But its harder to walk on your own  
  
Youll change  
Inside  
When you  
Realize  
  
The world comes to life  
And everythings bright  
From beginning to end  
When you have a friend  
  
By your side  
That helps you to find  
The beauty of all  
When youll open your heart and  
  
Believe in  
The gift of a friend  
The gift of a friend  
  
Someone who knows when your lost and your scared  
There through the highs and the lows  
Someone you can count on someone who cares  
Besides you where ever you go  
  
Youll change inside  
When you  
Realize  
The world comes to life  
  
And everythings bright  
From beginning to end  
When you have a friend  
By your side  
  
That helps you to find  
The beauty of all  
When youll open your heart and  
Believe in  
The gift of a friend  
  
And when your hope crashes down  
Shattering to the ground  
Youll youll feel all alone  
When you dont know which way to go  
And theres no signs leading you home  
Youre not alone  
  
The world comes to life  
And everythings bright  
From beginning to end  
When you have a friend  
  
By your side  
That helps you to find  
The beauty of all  
When youll open your heart and  
  
Believe in  
When you believe in  
You can believe in
