disputed lyrics in brackets  
Have you ever had the time to see me and you could change to be  
Take a dream away with you live it now and you will see  
Found myself on an open road got no hand to show the way  
Upped and started walking on to a land seemed so far away  
After so long felt I was damned then I reached some gates and held a hand  
But came to the point of sing and say laughing people led me in to stay  
Their happiness held me made me  strong I felt this is where I belong  
I dont want another day just wanna laugh live sing and say  
Its so strange I feel this way its so real its happening today  
Stop still something burns my body falls I begin to turn  
instrumental verse  
Flying drifting falling down I found myself beneath the ground  
In a place thats strange to me the earth is black and theres not a tree  
Well its so dark theres not a sound just the feeling of wanting to be found  
I must make haste to be gone in this place I do not belong  
I thought I tried to move a foot I just remained where I stood  
And in the distance I heard aloud the shrill of blank deathly sound  
I tried I tried I tried to run but every move I was where I begun  
Its too late shadows over me blind my eyes I cannot see  
All my strength all my love someone help me please above  
Death will surely take me down Ill be doomed to live beneath the ground  
instrumental  
see your two see your one see your tomb see you run you fool you fool
your life has just begun  
Im here to taunt and torment you  
I can make you do what I want you to  
Black it out and drag you down all kinds of evil wear a crown  
Chase you rape you feast upon your hurt lay your body in the dirt  
If I were a fool Id believe its true but I have no fear of what you can do  
See Im free I can be just anyone that I want to be  
Leave me now get out of my way  
instrumental  
see your two see your one see your tomb see your rock who are you fooling
lifes just begun  
Here to taunt to torment you  
I can make you do what I want you to  
Knock it out drag you down all kinds of people were aware of it now  
Chase you rape you feast upon your hurt lay your body in the dirt  
If I were a fool Id believe its true but I have no fear of what you can do  
See Im free so leave me alone I wanna go my way and be alone  
Get out of my sight get out of my way  
more instrumental  
Im not through and Im on the run youre the fool my lifes not been done  
Ill taunt you and Ill torment you  
instrumental  
Have this way with a dream never leave me so it seems  
Life by night life by day the tale they tell will always stay  
Walk the earth walk the sky dont let all this time go by  
Hang on fast dont let go or someone else will never know  
Ride a road along with me chase a dream we all can see  
Dont let bad just see good its all that just what you should  
No truth will ever come along shine so bright in your eyes  
No wide wonder will do that for you just lock it fast do what you got to do  
Shout it loud shout out loud just live how you want to be  
Show yourself show yourself live how you got to be  
  
more instrumental followed by a verse from rudyard kiplings gunga din
taped backwards though Ive belted you and flayed you by the living God
that made you youre a bette  
Than I am gunga din  
And then in ultra superslomo yes we know its all be done before before
before before before before
