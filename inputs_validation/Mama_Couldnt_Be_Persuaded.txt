Gambler ambled down a country lane  
Looking for a game of chance  
She was twentyone or two  
And she knew what she wanted  
And she wanted that gamblin man  
  
Her parents warned her  
Tried to reason with her  
She was determined that she wanted Bill  
Theyd all be offended at the mention still  
If they heard this song which I doubt they will  
  
And my Mama couldnt be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
Daughter dont marry that gamblin man  
Mama couldnt be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
Daughter dont marry that gamblin man  
Mama couldnt be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
No no nevertheless  
I said my Mama couldnt be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
Daughter dont marry that gamblin man  
  
Gambler tried to be a family man  
Though it didnt suit his style  
He thought he had him a winning combination  
So he took us where the stakes were high  
Her parents warned her  
Tried to reason with her  
Never kept their disappointment hid  
They all went to pieces when the bad luck hit  
Stuck in the middle I was the kid  
  
And my Mama couldnt be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
Daughter dont marry that gamblin man  
Mama couldnt be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
Daughter dont marry that gamblin man  
Mama couldnt be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
No no nevertheless  
Mmmmmmama couldnt be persuaded  
When my Grannie pleaded with her  
Not to marry that gamblin man  
  
I said my mama couldnt be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
Daughter dont marry that gamblin man  
Mama couldnt be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
Daughter dont marry that gamblin man  
Mama  
MmmMama couldnt be persuaded when they pleaded with her  
Daughter dont marry that gamblin man
