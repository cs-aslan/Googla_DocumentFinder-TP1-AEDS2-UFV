Someones gonna get hurt before youre through  
Someones gonna pay for the things you do  
How many hearts must breakhow many will it take  
To satisfy youjust to satisfy you  
  
Another loveanother fool  
To play your game  
Another loveanother fool  
Theyre all the same  
  
Someones gonna get hurt before youre through  
Dont be surprised if that someone is you  
Youre gonna find when its too latea heart that just wont break  
To satisfy youjust to satisfy you  
  
How many tears were criedhow many dreams have died  
To satisfy youjust to satisfy you
