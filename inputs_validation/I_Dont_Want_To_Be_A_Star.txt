I dont want to be a star  
Just want my chevy and an old guitar  
I dont want to be a star  
I dont need the fat cigar  
  
My friends wonder what is wrong with me  
Cause I dont get off on my fame  
I got so much confusion now  
Sometimes I dont even kno my name  
  
I dont want to be a star  
Just want my chevy and an old guitar  
I dont want to be a star  
I dont need the fat cigar  
  
Too many distractions run through my brain  
So many girls they start to look the same  
Too many options no time to choose  
Too many clothes too many shoes  
  
Ive had the world Ive done it upside down  
I played the part and Ive been the clown  
Now its my time its a brand new day  
To be myself in a different way  
I dont want to be a star  
Just want my chevy and an old guitar  
I dont want to be a star  
Just want my chevy and an old guitar  
I dont want to be a star  
I dont need the fat cigar  
  
I got to meet all the wonderful people  
I drank with Dylan boy did we act a fool  
I got to meet all the fabulous people  
I got high with Jagger it was really cool  
  
I dont want to be a star  
Just want my chevy and an old guitar  
I dont want to be a star  
I dont need the fat cigar  
  
Never
