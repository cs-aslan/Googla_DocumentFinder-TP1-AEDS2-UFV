Everybody get into the mood  
Forget your troubles for a little while  
All together let me see you move  
Aeach individual in a different style  
Come old lady theres no need to hide  
Just feel the rhythm and enyoy ride  
Shake it baby up and down your spine  
Couse once youre dancing youll be feeling fine  
  
If I can do it you can do it too  
You got in you that I promise you  
Youre gonna show that youre a little star tonight  
  
Chorus  
Well take it easy welll take it slow  
Were gonna dance to the rock n roll  
Well take it easy well take it slow  
Were gonna dance to the rock n roll  
  
Little babies are dancinto the tune  
Well mama anpapa like the rhythm too  
Shake it baby give it one more try  
Cause theres no reason for you to be shy  
  
If I can do it you can do it too  
Youre gonna show that youre al little star  
Tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
If youre ugly or pretty  
Or chubby or skinny  
It dont matter youll be  
Having a good time  
The old will be longer  
And the young will be older  
Were all gonna dance through the night  
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah
