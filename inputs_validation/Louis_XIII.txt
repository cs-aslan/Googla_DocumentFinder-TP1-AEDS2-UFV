Never has it been so brightExplain  
Gotta tail bitches get outta my sight  
Bitch you blocking my light  
Im in Vegas front seat at the fight  
Im a alcoholic so you know Im getting it right  
Louis the 13th  
Hennessy black when Im thirsty  
I like my liquor dark milk chocolate Hershey  
But first we  
Gotta bang loose for the niggas thats been waiting on it  
Patiently debating even hating on it bitch  
I started this gangsta shit  
House shoes and the shotgun check the pinks  
The hangover is over Tila created the lynx  
So tell the whole world to suck my dick real shit  
The addiction that you cant deny  
Twelve steps to recovery or else you die  
Yeah this is for you and I  
Fly pelican fly  
Fuck trying to get by  
Or we can put that bullshit aside and kill em  
LB Cool S  
Put a  out in Sweden out in   
So what makes a motherfucker so damn fresh  
We on the coast yeah you know to the left  
Louie the 13  
Back down original packtown originiator  
Im full of 40s like the gthang refrigerator  
Getting paper with my neighbor like that Clippers and the Lakers  
Drinking Jac next to Jack courtside at the Staples  
Affiliation is vital for survival we rolling  
 pull it up with a million bucks  
And Im feeling like a million bucks  
A allstar nigga still in shucks  
Louis the 13th  
You can say what you say just spell  right  
Still got a lot of Louies leftover from last night  
We alcoholic minded DJ rewind it  
Bitches in liquor we only fuck with the finest  
KingT your higness  
Im timeless yall niggas is spineless  
Drinking everything on the wine list  
So yeah nigga come and catch this fade  
Or break bread and we can all get paid  
Louis the 13th  
I got 14 courts all sorts of imports  
Premium spirits mixed with marked lyrics  
Dont fuck with Xzibit I will crush your frame  
Say my name I will hunt you down like Saddam Hussein  
Im crown royal  
Coming out the Compton soil  
Niggas in the kingdom stay loyal  
Its the old English linguist distinguished genius  
Always got a cup in my hand  
Louis the 13th  
Lets have a conversation on my present situation  
I dont need to be a star I got my own constellation  
Professional inebriation we having a celebration  
A live nation and heavy rotation  
Patience  
Hold more information than a free mason  
Its a secret society never try sobriety  
SS Bugatti live with the Illuminati  
 picking up the bodies  
We crash the party  
 and Harleys mixed with Bacardi  
Man fuck everybody
