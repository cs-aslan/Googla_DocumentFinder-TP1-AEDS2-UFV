Theres a teardrop falling slowly from my eyes tonight  
As I think of your two arms that used to hold me so very tight  
But youre gone now and girl Im alone and blue  
With just these pictures and memories of you  
Pictures and memories of a love warm and true  
Pictures of love we shared and the memories of you  
But your pictures cant heal my chest of this hurt deep inside  
Pictures and memories I feel like crying tonight  
I may be crazy but you know sometimes I can almost feel your touch  
Those who say I should be over you well I guess they just never loved as much  
Id put your pictures where I couldnt see them but Id still see them in my
mind  
Just like your memories theyre right here with me all the time  
Pictures and memories of a love warm and true  
Pictures of love we shared and the memories of you  
But your pictures cant heal my chest of this hurt deep inside  
Pictures and memories I feel like crying tonight  
Pictures and memories I feel like dying tonight
