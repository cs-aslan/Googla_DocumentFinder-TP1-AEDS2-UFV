Jesus Christ will resurrect  
Hes got his bmi royalty to collect  
Hes not the white fragile hippie  
He looks and acts more like an indignant iceT  
Jesus Christ is coming back  
He wants to kick Mel Gibsons ass  
Superstar The Passion of  
He wants his money not your love  
  
Hes been kickin 2000 years  
Hes fixed a lot of sports  
And drank a million beers  
Some ecstasy a thin white line  
He says designer drugs beat the hell out of wine  
Jesus Christ on vacation  
Spreading mass sacreligion  
Sex and drugs we abstain  
He thinks Christians are insane  
They dont know love  
They know fear and moral hauteur  
Scare tactics I never taught  
If youre gonna look to me  
Better get rose colored shades  
Cuz what you see is what you get
