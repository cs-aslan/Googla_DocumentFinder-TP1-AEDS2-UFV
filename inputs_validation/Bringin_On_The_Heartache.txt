Gypsy sittin lookin pretty  
A broken rose and laughin eyes  
Youre a mystery  
Always runnin wild  
Like a child without a home  
Youre always searchin  
Searchin for a feelin  
But its easy come and easy go  
  
Oh  Im sorry but its true  
Youre bringin on the heartache  
Takin all the best of me  
Oh cant you see  
You got the best of me  
Whoah cant you see  
  
CHORUS 1  
Youre bringin on the heartbreak  
Bringin on the heartache  
Youre bringin on the heartache  
Bringin on the heartache  
Cant you see  
Oh  
  
Youre such a secret  
Misty eyed and shady  
Baby how you hold the key  
Oh youre like a candle  
Your flame slowly fadin  
Burnin out and burnin me  
Cant you see  
Just tryin to say to you  
  
Youre bringin on the heartache  
Takin all the best of me  
Oh cant you see  
You got the best of me  
Oh cant you see  
  
CHORUS 2  
Youre bringin on the heartbreak  
Bringin on the heartache  
Youre bringin on the heartache  
Bringin on the heartache  
Cant you see  
Cant you see  
  
No  
No  
No  
  
You got the best of me  
Oh cant you see  
You got the best of me  
Oh cant you see  
Youre bringin on the heartbreak  
Bringin on the heartache  
  
CHORUS 3  
Youre bringin on the heartbreak  
Youre bringin on the heartache  
  
REPEAT
