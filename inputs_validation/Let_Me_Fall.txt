Let me fall  
Let me climb  
Theres a moment when fear  
And dreams must collide  
  
Someone I am  
Is waiting for courage  
The one I want  
The one I will become  
Will catch me  
  
So let me fall  
If I must fall  
I wont heed your warnings  
I wont hear them  
  
Let me fall  
If I fall  
Though the phoenix may  
Or may not rise  
  
I will dance so freely  
Holding on to no one  
You can hold me only  
If you too will fall  
Away from all these  
Useless fears and chains  
  
Someone I am  
Is waiting for my courage  
The one I want  
The one I will become  
Will catch me  
  
So let me fall  
If I must fall  
I wont heed your warnings  
I wont hear  
  
Let me fall  
If I fall  
Theres no reason  
To miss this one chance  
This perfect moment  
Just let me fall
