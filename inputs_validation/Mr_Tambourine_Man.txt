Hey mr tambourine man play a song for me  
Im not sleepy and there is no place im going to  
Hey mr tambourine man play a song for me  
In the jingle jangle morning ill come followin you  
  
Though i know that evenins empire has returned into sand  
Vanished from my hand  
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping  
My weariness amazes me im branded on my feet  
I have no one to meet  
And the ancient empty streets too dead for dreaming  
  
Hey mr tambourine man play a song for me  
Im not sleepy and there is no place im going to  
Hey mr tambourine man play a song for me  
In the jingle jangle morning ill come followin you  
  
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin ship  
My senses have been stripped my hands cant feel to grip  
My toes too numb to step wait only for my boot heels  
To be wanderin  
Im ready to go anywhere im ready for to fade  
Into my own parade cast your dancing spell my way  
I promise to go under it  
  
Hey mr tambourine man play a song for me  
Im not sleepy and there is no place im going to  
Hey mr tambourine man play a song for me  
In the jingle jangle morning ill come followin you  
  
Then take me disappearin through the smoke rings of my mind  
Down the foggy ruins of time far past the frozen leaves  
The haunted frightened trees out to the windy beach  
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow  
Yes to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free  
Silhouetted by the sea circled by the circus sands  
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves  
Let me forget about today until tomorrow  
  
Hey mr tambourine man play a song for me  
Im not sleepy and there is no place im going to  
Hey mr tambourine man play a song for me  
In the jingle jangle morning ill come followin you
