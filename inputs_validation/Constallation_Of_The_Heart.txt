Constellation of the heart  
  
We take all the telescopes  
And we turn them inside out  
And we point them away from the big sky  
Put your eye right up to the glass now  
And here well find the constellation of the heart  
  
Steer your life by these stars  
On the unconditional chance  
Tis here where Hell and Heaven dance  
This is the constellation of the heart  
  
We take all the telescopes  
And we turn them inside out  
And we point them away from the big sky  
Put your eye right up to the glass now  
And here well find the constellation of the heart  
  
The constellation of the heart  
The constellation of the heart  
  
We take all the telescopes  
And we turn them inside out  
And we point them away from the big sky  
Put your eye right up to the glass now  
And here well find the constellation of the heart  
  
The constellation of the heart  
The constellation of the heart  
  
Well we think youd better wake up captn

Ooh heres the constellation of the heart  
  
Who said anything about it hurting  
Its gonna be beautiful  
Its gonna be wonderful  
Its gonna be paradise  
  
Just being alive it can really hurt  
Ooh find me the man with the ladder  
And he might lift me up to the stars  
  
Without the pain thered be no learning  
Without the hurting wed never change  
  
Oooh and if you see the woman with the key  
I hear shes opening up the doors to Heaven  
Oh and here comes the man with the stick  
He said hed fish me out of the moon
