Is there anyone home in this house made of stone  
Anyone inside know my name  
Ive been around for a half of a hundred days  
Never saw a door shut so tight  
Turn around dont look down  
Theres a man behind you with a gun  
  
Like any wandering child in the wilderness  
Wild and uncaged are your ways  
I think I heard  
Someone stirred  
I think I heard  
Someone stirred  
  
Theres a light around you  
Ive come to switch it on  
It will brighten every room  
Dont be ashamed if you feel a whole lot warmer in you heart  
You got that feelin in your soul  
  
Is there anyone home in this house made of stone  
Anyone in there who might care  
Ive grown weary and wise and I feel much amazed  
Got a few good tales to unwind  
Turn around dont look down  
Theres a man behind you with a gun  
Like any wandering minstrel Ive dawned in the house of a thousand  
delights  
  
I think I heard  
Someone stirred  
I think I heard  
Someone stirred  
I think I heard  
Someone stirred  
I think I heard  
Someone stirred  
I think I heard  
Someone stirred  
I think I heard  
Someone stirred
