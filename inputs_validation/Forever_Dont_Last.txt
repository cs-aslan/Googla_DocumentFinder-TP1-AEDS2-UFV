Here we go  
  
Same these days I think about her  
Dream up ways to live with out her  
We made vows that I can not excuse  
Yes forever dont last the way it used too  
  
We filled the church and hired a preacher  
I raised her veil to reach her  
Lives on the promise of her youth  
But forever dont last the way it used too  
  
Eternity can not be messed with  
The law says you might confess to  
Enough coals hotter hell you fool  
Then you swear an oath and then take it back anytime you choose  
That forever dont last the way it used too  
  
Hammers razors fill the trash  
You throwem out when you use the last  
Get a new form son dont become confused  
If forever dont last the way it used to  
  
Forever dont last forever dont last  
Forever dont last forever dont last the way it used too  
Forever dont last forever dont last  
Forever dont last forever dont last  
  
Take a break
