Now I smoke a lot of cigarettes  
And Ive been drinking too much wine  
Youve been patient and understanding  
I guess I went to far this time  
I cut you with my drunken words  
So much sharper than a knife  
But you turned the tables on me baby  
Just by walking out of my life  
  
Too late to say Im sorry  
It wont happen anymore  
But you dont believe a word I say  
Cause youve heard it all before  
But all the same  
Wont you take me back again  
  
Dont say its over  
After all that weve been through  
Take some time to think about it baby  
While I sing my song to you  
Your suitcase by the back door  
Packed with broken dreams  
When night time comes to call on me  
Ill know what loneliness means  
But all the same  
Wont you take me back again  
  
Take me back again take me back again  
All Im asking is forgiveness  
Wont you take me back again  
Take me back again take me back again  
All Im asking is forgiveness  
Wont you take me back again  
  
But baby all the same  
Wont you take me back again  
Take me back again take me back again  
  
But baby all the same  
Wont you take me back again  
Take me back again take me back again  
Wont you take me back again  
No no no no take me back again  
  
Dont walk away from me baby  
I beggin you please uh  
I beggin you please uh  
Take me back again  
Take me back again
