Every time I see my baby home  
I want to kiss a little better so I get stoned  
Gonna spread her pretty legs so I can see  
Sweet lip honey be the death of me  
And I will discover youll be my midnight lover  
Oh babe bring it on home to me  
  
Sometimes when Im feeling low  
I go looking for a lover where the bad girls go  
Sorry little girl If you cant stay  
Your red light mama gonna show the way  
  
And then a certain madness  
Will crease my heart with sadness  
Oh babe bring it on home to me  
Take me with you I will give you anything a woman needs  
Take me with you I will give you anything a woman needs  
  
I know love and what it means  
Its a skinny little girl in tight ass jeans  
I love to hearem moan and cry  
cause God made men to satisfy  
And with the fire returning  
I feel the fever burning  
Oh babe bring it on home to me  
  
Take me with you I will give you anything a woman needs  
Take me with you I will give you anything a woman needs  
Oh take me with you  
  
Every time I see my baby home  
I want to kiss a little better so I get stoned  
Gonna spread her pretty legs so I can see  
Sweet lip honey be the death of me  
And I will discover youll be my midnight lover  
Oh babe bring it on home to me  
  
Take me with you I will give you anything a woman needs  
Take me with you I will give you anything a woman needs  
Take me with you
