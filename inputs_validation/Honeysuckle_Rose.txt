Every honey bee fills with jealousy  
When they see you out with me  
Goodness knows  
Youre my honeysuckle rose  
  
When youre passin by flowers droop and sigh  
And I know the reason why  
Goodness knows  
Youre my honeysuckle rose  
  
Dont buy sugar  
You just have to touch my cup  
Youre my sugar  
Its sweeter when you stir it up  
  
When Im taking sips from your tasty lips  
Seems the honey fairly drips  
Goodness knows  
Youre my honeysuckle rose  
  
Goodness knows  
Youre my honeysuckle rose  
  
Dont buy sugar  
You just have to touch my cup  
Youre my sugar  
Its sweeter when you stir it up  
  
When Im taking sips from your tasty lips  
Seems the honey fairly drips  
Goodness knows  
Youre my honeysuckle rose
