Before I leave let me put this on your brain  
If rap stop today I still do my thang

Took my momma out the Bricks and bought a car in her name  
Paid my nigga Head bond just to get him on the streets  
Hope if I get locked up niggaz do it for me  
Keep the project lights on payin erybody bills  
All my homies dead Im takin care of erybody kids  
And I got this you can count on me
