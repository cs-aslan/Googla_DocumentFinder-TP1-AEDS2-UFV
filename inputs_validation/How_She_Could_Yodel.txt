Come listen to my tale bout a pretty little girl  
That I chanced to meet on the prairie  
Twas a night in June by the western moon  
That I met my charming Mary  
Her eyes were as bright as the stars that night  
When she smiled my heart did bubble  
She couldnt make love or turtle dove  
But oh boy She could yodel  
  
She yodeled a yodel as sweet as it could be  
Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
But love meant nothin she was too cold  
But boy oh boy oh boy how she could yodel  
  
Well I said to myself you silly little elf  
Ill win her heart thats settled  
I tried to hiss that pretty little miss  
But oh my how she battled  
She called me names made me feel so ashamed  
Then she said my fire is nobel  
Then she turned me down didnt want me around  
But oh boy how she yodeled  
  
She yodeled a yodel as sweet as it could be  
Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
But love meant nothin she was too cold  
But boy oh boy oh boy how she could yodel  
  
Next night on thr trail I heard a big wail  
She changed her mind felt sorry  
Her yodel you see was meant for me  
And she said you had me worried  
Ive rode out tonight to make things right  
And I hope you will forgive me  
When I said why yes she took a deep breath  
And oh boy how she yodeled  
  
She yodeled a yodel as sweet as it could be  
Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
And it turned to warm from icy cold  
But boy oh boy oh boy how she did yodel  
  
Well then we got married and what do you think  
Were as happy as the birds in the treeses  
Her love is so true and Im tellin you  
Her heart no more it freezes  
In a cradle of pine theres a baby devine  
And he never never grumbles  
Hes our own little pet and we cant talk yet  
But I wish you could hear him yodel  
  
He yodels a yodel as sweet as it could be  
Hes our own little pet and we love him you bet  
It dont mean a thing that he cant talk yet  
But hes spendin his time just learning the way to yodel
