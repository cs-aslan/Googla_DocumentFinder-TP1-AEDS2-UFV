Well the blues still in the water and the blues still in the sky  
And way beyond the blue theres someone watchin from on high  
My clothes may be ragged and my shoes may be worn  
But Ive been a wealthy boy since Ive been born  
Cause I call him when Im troubled and I call him when Im weak  
And he always pulls me through my troubles some way and I believe  
Hell be there hell be there hell be there hell be there  
Like he always is to answer when I call him  
  
My mother used to tell me I should take it slow  
The pace is not what matters its the direction that you go  
Keep your feet upon the path and your eyes upon the goal  
Youll have all the joy a heart could ever hold  
Cause I call him when Im troubled  
Like he always is to answer when I call him
