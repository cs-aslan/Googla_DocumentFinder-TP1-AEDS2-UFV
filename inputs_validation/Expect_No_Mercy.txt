If youre ready for the street  
You want to mix it in some fight  
Let me tell you somethin  
Now I dont want to get you uptight  
But if youre in a corner  
And you cant find no way out  
Dont look around for no help  
No no there wont be any around  
  
Expect no mercy expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy expect no mercy  
  
So you think you got a case  
And you think you know the score  
No you dont want to listen  
You cant be told no more  
But waitll you get out there  
You better do it right  
Cause the streets are lined with things that kill  
And theyre hidin in the night  
  
Expect no mercy expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy expect no mercy  
  
Feel that you can cut it  
You think you got the time  
Theyll only give you one chance  
Better get it right first time  
And the game youre playing  
If you lose you gotta pay  
If you make just one wrong move  
Youll get blown away  
  
Expect no mercy expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy expect no mercy
