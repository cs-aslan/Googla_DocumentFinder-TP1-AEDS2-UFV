Crowds that scream at superstars  
Where bouncers show their battle scars  
Ive been the first to sign on every wall  
Down the road and round the bend  
We pray to god it never ends  
Ive been Ive seen weve screamed to everyone  
  
Well see you at the show  
If you dont come well never know  
You stand off in the back  
You still stand out while youre wearing black  
You jump onto the bus  
And ride around with all of us  
Well go out onto the town  
And light it up til we burn it down  
  
After hours and alcohol  
Every club weve seen em all  
As long as we dont need to stand in line  
Party scenes and billboard dreams  
The ladies love those limousines  
You know were gonna show up every time  
  
Well see you at the show  
If you dont come well never know  
You stand off in the back  
You still stand out while your wearing black  
You jump onto the bus  
And ride around with all of us  
Well go out on the town  
And light it up til we burn it down  
burn it down
