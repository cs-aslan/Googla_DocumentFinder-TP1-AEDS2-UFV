Lazy days calling to you  
Come out to play  
The future lies with you  
Now you can be sure love is the cure  
What were searching for  
Is to have a jolly good time  
  
Crazy days but youll get me through  
And here Ill stay holding on to you  
Now you can be sure  
Our thoughts unpure  
Will unlock the door  
And we will have a jolly good time  
  
It can happen in any season  
We dont need any reason  
To sit around and wait  
The world can change in a second so  
I find the sunshine beckons me  
To open up the gate  
And dream and dream  
  
Lazy days dont let them get you down  
Wear your smile  
I dont want to see you frown  
Dont let them get you down  
  
It can happen in any season  
We dont need any reason  
To sit around and wait  
The world can change in a second so  
I find the sunshine beckons me  
To open up the gate  
And dream and dream  
  
Then we will have  a jolly good time
