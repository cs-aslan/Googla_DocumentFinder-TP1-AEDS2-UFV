I saw her in a dream but it wasnt true  
Through the smoke and fire  
Of the exhaust fumes  
She just laughed and loved me till I was no use  
And Ill never fall in love again  
Shes a motorcycle that I cant ride  
Shes a precious jewel that I cant buy  
Shes a scene Im playin in which I die  
And Ill never fall in love again  
I never play to win  
Is what she said  
And poured a little cocaine in my head  
Shes a fuckin Picasso in bed  
And Ill never fall in love again  
  
Now your voice  
So Spanish and clear  
Rings like a church bell in my ear  
But I dont believe in a word I hear  
And Ill never fall in love again  
My mind calls you in the night  
My mind calls you and I want to take flight  
To some other garden of sweet delight  
And Ill never fall in love again
