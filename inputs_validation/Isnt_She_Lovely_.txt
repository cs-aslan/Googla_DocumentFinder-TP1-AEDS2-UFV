Isnt she lovely isnt she wonderful  
Isnt she precious less than one minute old  
I never thought through love youll be  
Making love as lovely as she  
Isnt she lovely and shes made it from love  
Isnt she pretty shes so pretty truly the angel best  
For I am so happy Im so happy we have been heaven blest  
I cant believe what God has done  
To you He has given life to one  
Isnt she lovely and shes made it from love  
Isnt she lovely shes so lovely life and love are the same  
Life is Aida Aida the meaning of her name  
Candies good have not been done  
Without you shell be the one  
Oh so very lovely isnt she pretty Isnt she pretty  
Isnt she lovely yes she is made from love
