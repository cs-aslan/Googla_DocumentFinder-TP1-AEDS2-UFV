Let me down slow an easy  
Cause there aint nothin I can do  
I hope and pray my faith wont leave me  
When it comes down to me an you  
Try a little tenderness  
I die a little  
For a long lost sweet caress  
You lyin next to me  
Fulfilled some destiny  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Just a little bit of lettin go  
I dont want you to know  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Overflow of emotion  
And a hurt thatll never heal  
If you close the door forever  
The fate of pain is sealed  
Try a little tenderness  
I die a little  
For a long lost sweet caress  
You lyin next to me  
Fulfilled some destiny  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Just a little bit of lettin go yea  
I dont want you to know  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
I more than long for your affection  
You tell me now that aint so  
Not even gentle persuasion  
Is ever gonna let me go  
You lyin next to me yea  
Fulfilled some destiny  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Just a little bit of lettin go yea  
I dont want you to know  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Wont you let me breathe  
Wont you let me breathe  
Let me breathe  
Wont you let me breathe  
Breathe a sigh  
Wont you let me breathe  
Wont you let me breathe  
Breathe a sigh  
Wont you let me breathe
