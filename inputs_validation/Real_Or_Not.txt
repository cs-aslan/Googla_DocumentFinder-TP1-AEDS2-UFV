They say the devils in the details  
I know what they mean  
Im walking in the wasteland  
With the Ghost in the Machine  
Theres a simulated sunset  
Starlight in my eyes  
The skies are filled with miracles  
And half of them are lies  
Are you real or not  
Its a fine line  
Are you ready or not  
For the light of day  
Are you real or not  
These are strange times  
And I dont want to live this way  
When you wake up from a nightmare  
And its worse when youre awake  
And theres no one you can turn to  
And theres nothing you can take  
Are you real or not  
Its a fine line  
Are you ready or not  
For the light of day   
Are you real or not  
These are strange times  
And I dont want to live this way
