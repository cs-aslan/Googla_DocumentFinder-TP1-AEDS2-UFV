Chin checker Im da chin checker  
  
Verse 1  
It was a quarter passed 3 when I ran into rell  
Didnt forget my keys cause my name ring bells  
A lil white tee some addidas with the shells  
Tun in the coup oh Shoot broke a nail  
Let me let me think what I gotta gotta do  
Should I get the black or the chrome 22  
And if a bird try to get out of the cage  
I bitch down new york times front page  
I went to starbucks I wanted to get a frapo  
Then had a snapple apple with the capo  
Thats fendi but thats irrelivent  
Threw him a couple benjies now Im da president  
And Im nicki and nicki so picky
