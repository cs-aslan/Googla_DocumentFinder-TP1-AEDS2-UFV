Says my aul wan to your aul wan  
Will ye go to the Waxies dargle  
Says your aul wan to my aul wan  
I havent got a farthing  
I went up to Monto town  
To see Uncle McArdle  
But he wouldnt give me a half a crown  
For to go to the Waxies dargle  
  
What will ya have  
Ill have a pint  
Ill have a pint with you Sir  
And if one of ya doesnt order soon  
Well be chucked out of the boozer  
  
Says my aul wan to your aul wan  
Will ye go to the Galway races  
Says your aul wan to my aul wan  
Ill hawk me aul mans braces  
I went up to Capel Street  
To the Jewish moneylenders  
But he wouldnt give me a couple of bob  
For the aul mans red suspenders  
  
Chorus  
  
Says my aul wan to your aul wan  
We got no beef or mutton  
If we went up to Monto town  
We might get a drink for nuttin  
Heres a nice piece of advice  
I got from an aul fishmonger  
When food is scarce and you see the hearse  
Youll know you have died of hunger  
  
Chorus x2
