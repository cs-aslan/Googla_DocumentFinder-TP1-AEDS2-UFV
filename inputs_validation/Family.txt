Heres father his heart screwed on  
Yes here hes got it Im sure  
Cause he lost his life in an accident  
Found his heart in the man next door  
What exactly is gonna happen  
When they do transplant the brain  
Will my borrowed brain still compute the same  
Or will my daughter suffer so much more  
  
Here comes the girl shes got her head screwed on  
But it aint screwed on right  
Her ambition is to be a prostitute  
But the breaks just werent right  
What exactly is gonna happen tell me  
When her father finds out  
That his virgin daughter has bordello dreams  
And that hes the one she wants to try out  
Yeah  
  
Theres ma shes living dangerously  
Its a cinch shell try it anything twice  
She thinks she can run right to the whirlpools edge  
And stop herself just in time  
What exactly is gonna happen  
When she finally fizzles out  
The lovers will just be sucked into  
To see what the colours of death are all about  
  
Heres the son has his legs ascrewed on  
Yeah theyre screwed on pretty tight  
But his brain is loose and it aint no use  
Hes already lost the fight  
What exactly is gonna happen  
When hes finally realized  
That he cant play his guitar like EG Jim  
Or write St Augustine if he tried  
  
Thats what happens  
When a family finds out  
That theyve been in orbit now for a thousand years  
And need a thousand more to climb out
