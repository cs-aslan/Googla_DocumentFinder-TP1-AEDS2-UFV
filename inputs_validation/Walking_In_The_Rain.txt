I want him and I need him  
And someday someway wooo Ill meet him  
Hell be kind of shy and real good lookin too  
And Ill be certain hes my guy by the things hell like to do  
  
Like walking in the rain like walking in the rain  
And wishing on the stars and wishing on the stars up above  
And being so in love  
  
When hes near me Ill kiss him  
And when he leaves me woo Ill miss him  
Though sometimes well fight I wont really care  
And Ill know its gonna be alright cause weve got so much we share  
  
Like walking in the rain like walking in the rain  
And wishing on the stars and wishing on the stars up above  
And being so in love  
  
Johnny no no hell never do  
Bobby no it isnt him too  
They would never no theyd never never ever love  
Walking in the rain like walking in the rain  
And wishing on the stars and wishing on the stars up above  
And being so in love  
  
Oh oh oh where can he be oh oh
