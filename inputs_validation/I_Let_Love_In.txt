Despair and Deception Loves ugly little twins  
Came aknocking on my door I let them in  
Darling youre the punishment for all of my former sins  
I let love in  
I let love in  
The door it opened just a crack but Love was shrewed and bold  
My life flashed before my eyes it was a horror to behold  
A lifesentence sweeping confetti from the floor of a concrete hole  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
Well Ive been bound and gagged and Ive been terrorized  
And Ive been castrated and Ive been lobotomized  
But never has my tormenter come in such a cunning disguise  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
O Lord tell me what I done  
Please dont leave me here alone  
Where are my friends  
My friends are gone  
O Lord tell me what I done  
Please dont leave me here alone  
Where are my friends  
My friends are gone  
I let love in  
I let love in  
So if youre sitting all alone and hear aknocking at you door  
And the air is full of promises well buddy youve been warned  
Far worse to be Loves lover than the lover that Love has scorned  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in
