I wish I had a son  
A little boy  
Bright with black curly hair  
I would take his hand in mine  
And stroll slowly slowly  
Through the garden  
Little boy  
  
Uri Id call him  
My Uri  
How gentle and clear this tiny name  
A glimmer of joy  
For my little boy  
Uri Id call him  
Uri Id call  
  
But I am still bitter as Rachel  
I am still praying as Hannah in Shiloh  
I am still waiting for him  
I will  
Wait
