Sometimes tears say all  
There is to say  
Sometime your first  
Scars wont ever fade away  
Tried to break my heart  
Well its broke  
Tried to hang me high  
Well Im choked  
Wanted rain on me  
Well Im soaked  
Soaked to the skin  
  
Its the end where I begin  
Its the end where I begin  
  
Sometimes we dont learn  
From our mistakes  
Sometimes weve no  
Choice but to walk  
Away away  
Tried to break my heart  
Well its broke  
Tried to hang me high  
Well Im choked  
Wanted rain on me  
Well Im soaked  
Soaked to the skin  
  
Its the end where I begin  
Its the end where I begin  
  
Now Im alive  
And my ghosts are gone  
Ive shed all the pain  
Ive been holding on  
The cure for a heart  
Is to move along is to move along  
So move along Repeat x3  
What dont kill a heart  
Only makes it strong  
  
Sometimes tears say all  
There is to say  
Sometime your first  
Scars dont ever fade away  
Tried to break my heart  
Well its broke  
Tried to hang me high  
Well Im choked  
Wanted rain on me  
Well Im soaked  
Soaked to the skin  
  
Its the end  
End where I begin  
Its the end  
End where I begin  
  
Sometimes we dont learn  
From our mistakes  
Sometimes weve no  
Choice but to walk  
Away away
