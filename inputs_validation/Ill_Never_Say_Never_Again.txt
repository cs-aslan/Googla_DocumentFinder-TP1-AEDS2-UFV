Ill never say Never again again  
Cause see Im in love again  
Head over heels in love again  
With you  
Ill never say Never kiss you again  
Cause see Im kissing you again  
Thats just the thing Id say it  
Id never do  
I walked away and said goodbye  
I was hasty wasnt I  
I missed you so I thought Id die  
But its all over now throw my hat in the sky  
Ill never say Never again again  
Cause see I am in love again  
Head over heels in love again  
With the same sweet you  
Oh never be in a rush to say goodbye  
You may regret it by and by  
Why did we ever fall  
Say goodbye to love  
Must have been insane  
What was I thinking of  
Here we are back together  
Happier than before  
All I can do is promise  
For evermore  
Ill never say Never never again  
Here I am in love again  
Head over heels Im in love again  
With you  
Never say Never kiss you never again  
Here I am kissing you again  
Thats just the thing Id say  
That Id never do  
I walked away and said goodbye  
I was hasty wasnt I  
I missed you so I thought Id die  
But its all over now throw my hat in the sky  
Ill never say Never again again  
Cause see I am in love again  
Head over heels in love again  
With the same sweet you
