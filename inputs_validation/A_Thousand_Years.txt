Times are changing well soon be facing  
A story yet unknown  
Dont deny it we cant defy it  
Itll happen on its own  
The past behind us there to remind us  
Of what could be again  
Fact or fiction deep intuition  
Of wondering how and when  
Once in a thousand years  
The secrets of the past  
Will change the way we see  
Across the ocean the worlds emotions  
Are in and out of time  
The changing seasons no rhyme or reason  
The choices cruel or kind  
One day its clear then clouds appear  
cause nothing stays the same  
The thoughts that have conditioned you  
Its how you play the game  
But then the day will come around  
Well turn the world upside down
