Dear Abby Dear Abby  
My feet are too long  
My hairs falling out and my rights are all wrong  
My friends they all tell me that Ive no friends at all  
Wont you write me a letter wont you give me a call

Chorus  
You have no complaint  
You are what your are and you aint what you aint  
So listen up Buster and listen up good  
Stop wishing for bad luck and knocking on wood  
  
Dear Abby Dear Abby  
My fountain pen leaks  
My wife hollers at me and my kids are all freaks  
Every side I get up on is the wrong side of bed  
If it werent so expensive Id wish I were dead  
Signed Unhappy  
  
Unhappy Unhappy  
You have no complaint  
You are what your are and you aint what you aint  
So listen up Buster and listen up good  
Stop wishing for bad luck and knocking on wood  
  
Dear Abby Dear Abby ha Dear Abby Dear Abby Dear Abby  
Dear Abby Dear Abby  
You wont believe this  
But my stomach makes noises whenever I kiss  
My girlfriend tells me Its all in my head  
But my stomach tells me to write you instead  
Signed Noisemaker

You have no complaint  
You are what your are and you aint what you aint  
So listen up Buster and listen up good  
Stop wishing for bad luck and knocking on wood  
  
Dear Abby Dear Abby  
Well I never thought  
That me and my girlfriend would ever get caught  
We were sitting in the back seat just shooting the breeze  
With her hair up in curlers and her pants to her knees  
Signed Just Married  
  
Just married Just married  
You have no complaint  
You are what your are and you aint what you aint  
So listen up Buster and listen up good  
Stop wishing for bad luck and knocking on wood  
Signed Dear Abby  
  
Thank you
