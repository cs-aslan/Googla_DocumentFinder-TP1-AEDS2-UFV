Wondering what Im doing tonight  
Ive been in the closet and feel all right  
Ran out of Carbona Mom threw out the glue  
Ran out of paint and roach spray too  
Its TVs fault why I am this way  
  
Mom and pop want to put me away  
From the early morning movie to the late late show  
After its over nowhere to go  
And Im not sorry for the things I do  
  
My brain is stuck from shooting glue  
Im not sorry for the things I do  
Carbona not glue
