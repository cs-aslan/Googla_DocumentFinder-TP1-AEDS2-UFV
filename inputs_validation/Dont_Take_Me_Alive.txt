Agents of the law  
Luckless pedestrian  
I know youre out there  
With rage in your eyes and your megaphones  
Saying all is forgiven  
Mad dog surrender  
How can I answer  
A man of my mind can do anything  
  
Chorus  
Im a bookkeepers son  
I dont want to shoot no one  
Well I crossed my old man back in Oregon  
Dont take me alive  
Got a case of dynamite  
I could hold out here all night  
Yes I crossed my old man back in Oregon  
Dont take me alive  
  
Can you hear the evil crowd  
The lies and the laughter  
I hear my inside  
The mechanized hum of another world  
Where no sun is shining  
No red light flashing  
Here in this darkness  
I know what Ive done  
I know all at once who I am  
  
Chorus
