Welcome to my city  
The girls are so damn pretty  
Such a pity they dont come for free  
  
Just call me pimp daddy  
Ill roll ya one big fatty  
I think youre gonna like a hangin with me  
  
Chorus  
Welcome to my city of sin  
I believe youre gonna fit right in  
Yes this is my city of sin  
Youre first lesson is about to begin  
Now youre living in the city of sin  
You dont mind if I call you friend  
Once you enter you can never get out of here  
Welcome to Hollyweird  
  
Im the king of the streets  
I own the cops the junkies and freaks  
Its a human wasteland I call home  
  
Grow your hair to your shoes  
Trust me boy you just cant lose  
Soon this be the only life youve ever known  
  
Chorus
