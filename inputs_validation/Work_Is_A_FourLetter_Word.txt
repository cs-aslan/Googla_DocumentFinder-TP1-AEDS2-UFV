Loving you is driving me crazy  
People say that you were born lazy  
Cause you say that  
Work Is A FourLetter Word  
  
So change your life  
There is so much I know  
That you can do  
Come and see   
  
Wideawake  
And take all of this love  
That is waiting for you  
  
If you stay  
Ill stay right beside you  
And my love  
May help to remind you  
To forget that  
Work Is A FourLetter Word  
  
I dont need  
A house thats a showplace  
I just feel  
That were going no place  
While you say that  
Work Is A FourLetter Word  
  
So change your life  
There is so much I know  
You can do  
Come and see   
  
Wideawake  
And take all of this love  
That is waiting for you  
  
If you stay  
Ill stay right beside you  
And my love  
Might help to remind you  
To forget that  
Work Is A FourLetter Word  
Oh   
  
I dont need  
A house thats a showplace  
I just feel  
That were going no place  
While you say that  
Work Is A FourLetter Word  
  
So change your life  
There is so much I know  
That you can do  
Please come and see   
  
Wideawake  
And take all of this love  
That is waiting for you
