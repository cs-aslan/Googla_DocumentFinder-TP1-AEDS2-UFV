Im just average common too  
Im just like him the same as you  
Im everybodys brother and son  
I aint different from anyone  
It aint no use atalking to me  
Its just the same as talking to you  
  
I was shadowboxing earlier in the day  
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay  
I said Fee fie fo fum Cassius Clay here I come  
26 27 28 29 Im gonna make your face look just like mine  
Five four three two one Cassius Clay youd better run  
99 100 101 102 your ma wont even recognize you  
14 15 16 17 18 19 gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen  
  
Well I dont know but Ive been told  
The streets in heaven are lined with gold  
I ask you how things could get much worse  
If the Russians happen to get up there first  
Wowee Pretty scary  
  
Now Im liberal but to a degree  
I want evrybody to be free  
But if you think that Ill let Barry Goldwater  
Move in next door and marry my daughter  
You must think Im crazy  
I wouldnt let him do it for all the farms in Cuba  
  
Well I set my monkey on the log  
And ordered him to do the Dog  
He wagged his tail and shook his head  
And he went and did the Cat instead  
Hes a weird monkey very funky  
  
I sat with my highheeled sneakers on  
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun  
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist  
And my wighat was falling in my face  
But they wouldnt let me on the tennis court  
  
I gotta woman shes so mean  
She sticks my boots in the washing machine  
Sticks me with buckshot when Im nude  
Puts bubblegum in my food  
Shes funny wants my money calls me honey  
  
Now I gotta friend who spends his life  
Stabbing my picture with a bowieknife  
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf  
When my name comes up he pretends to barf  
Ive got a million friends  
  
Now they asked me to read a poem  
At the sorority sisters home  
I got knocked down and my head was swimmin  
I wound up with the Dean of Women  
Yippee Im a poet and I know it  
Hope I dont blow it  
  
Im gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange  
So I look like a walking mountain range  
And Im gonna ride into Omaha on a horse  
Out to the country club and the golf course  
Carry the New York Times shoot a few holes blow their minds  
  
Now youre probably wondering by now  
Just what this song is all about  
Whats probably got you baffled more  
Is what this thing here is for  
Its nothing  
Its something I learned over in England
