Once upon a time there was an ocean  
But now its a mountain range  
Something unstoppable set into motion  
Nothing is different but everythings changed  
  
Its a dead end job and you gets tired of sittin  
And its like a nicotine habit youre always thinking about quittin  
I think about quittin every day of the week  
When I look out my window its brown and its bleak  
  
Outta here  
How am I gonna get outta here  
Im thinking outta here  
When am I gonna get outta here  
And when will I cash in my lottery ticket  
And bury my past with my burdens and strife  
I want to shake every limb in the garden of Eden  
And make every love the love of my life  
  
I figure that once upon a time I was an ocean  
But now Im a mountain range  
Something unstoppable set into motion  
Nothing is different but everythings changed  
  
Found a room in the heart of the city down by the bridge  
Hot plate and TV and beer in the fridge  
But Im easy Im open thats my gift  
I can flow with the traffic I can drift with the drift  
Home again  
Naw never going home again  
Think about home again  
I never think about home  
  
But then comes a letter from home  
The handwritings fragile and strange  
Something unstoppable set into motion  
Nothing is different but everythings changed  
  
The light through the stained glass was cobalt and red  
And the frayed cuffs and collars were mended by haloes of golden thread  
The choir sang Once Upon A Time There Was An Ocean  
And all the old hymns and family names came fluttering down as leaves of
emotion  
  
As nothing is different but everythings changed
