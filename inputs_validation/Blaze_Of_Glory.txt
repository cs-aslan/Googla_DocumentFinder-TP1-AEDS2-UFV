I wake up in the morning  
And I raise my weary head  
Ive got an old coat for a pillow  
And the earth was last nights bed  
I dont know where Im going  
Only God knows where Ive been  
Im a devil on the run  
A six gun lover  
A candle in the wind  
  
When youre brought into this world  
They say youre born in sin  
Well at least they gave me something  
I didnt have to steal or have to win  
Well they tell me that Im wanted  
Yeah Im a wanted man  
Im a colt in your stable  
Im what Cain was to Abel  
Mister catch me if you can  
  
Im going out in a blaze of glory  
Take me now but know the truth  
Im going out in a blaze of glory  
Lord I never drew first  
But I drew first blood  
Im no ones son  
Call me young gun  
  
You ask about my conscience  
And I offer you my soul  
You ask if Ill grow to be a wise man  
Well I ask if Ill grow old  
You ask me if Ive known love  
And what its like to sing songs in the rain  
Well Ive seen love come  
And Ive seen it shot down  
Ive seen it die in vain  
  
Shot down in a blaze of glory  
Take me now but know the truth  
Cause Im going down in a blaze of glory  
Lord I never drew first  
But I drew first blood  
Im the devils son  
Call me young gun  
  
Each night I go to bed  
I pray the Lord my soul to keep  
No I aint looking for forgiveness  
But before Im six foot deep  
Lord I got to ask a favor  
And hope youll understand  
Cause Ive lived life to the fullest  
Let this boy die like a man  
Staring down a bullet  
Let me make my final stand  
  
Shot down in a blaze of glory  
Take me now but know the truth  
Im going out in a blaze of glory  
Lord I never drew first  
But I drew first blood  
And Im no ones son  
Call me young gun  
Im a young gun  
Young gun yeah yeah yeah  
Young gun
