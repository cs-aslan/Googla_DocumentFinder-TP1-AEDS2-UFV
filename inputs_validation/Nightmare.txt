Close my eyes starting dreaming  
See a vision filled with wings  
Head my way  
Feel the presence of unknown power  
Telling me to come  
This is the only way  
  
Its dream within dream  
Lost and lonely  
Dont get pulled by the devils hand  
  
Silent screamer filled with fear  
As the night time shapes a face  
Then disappears  
Scared forever into believing  
That your mind has met the  
Prince of whom you see  
  
Its dream within dream  
Lost and lonely  
Dont get fooled by the  
Devils hand  
  
Its dream within dream  
Fool forever dont get fooled  
Forever  
Dont get fooled be the devil  
  
In your eyes  
The evil spirit rises  
Blinded by the dark  
You fall into shame  
As the reaper takes you  
Down the spiral stairway  
You share the evil pit  
With Satans name  
  
Nightmare its got me runnin  
Nightmare its calling you  
Nightmare its got me runnin  
Nightmare its calling you  
  
Its dream within a dream  
Lost and lonely  
Dont get fooled be the devil  
  
Its dream within a dream  
Lost forever  
Dont get fooled  
  
Its got me running  
Its just a nightmare  
Its got me running  
Its got me running
