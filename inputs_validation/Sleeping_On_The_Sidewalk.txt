I was nothin but a city boy  
My trumpet was my only toy  
Ive been blowin my horn  
Since I knew I was born  
But there aint nobody wants to know  
  
Ive been sleepin on the sidewalk  
Rollin down the road  
I may get hungry  
But I sure dont want to go home  
  
So round the corner comes a limousine  
And the biggest grin I ever seen  
Here sonny wont you sign  
Right along the dotted line  
What you sayin are you playin  
Sure you dont mean me  
  
Ive been sleepin on the sidewalk  
Rollin down the road  
I may get hungry  
But I sure dont want to go home  
  
Now I tell you what happened  
  
They took me to a room without a table  
They said blow your trumpet into here  
I played around as well as I was able  
And soon we had the record of the year  
  
I was a legend all through the land  
I was blowin to a million fans  
Nothin was a missin  
All the people want to listen  
Youd have thought I was a happy man  
  
And I was sleepin like a princess  
Never touch the road  
I dont get hungry  
And I sure dont want to go home  
Have to have some fun  
  
Now they tell me that I aint so fashionable  
An I owe the man a million bucks a year  
So I told em where to stick the fancy label  
Its just me and the road from here  
  
Im back to playin and layin  
Im back on the game  
  
Im sleepin on the sidewalk  
Rollin down the road  
I sure get hungry and  
I sure do want to go home  
Yeah
