Blaming Mary Jane Im drinking cheap  
Shes getting prettier by the   
She says I should care more for  
The rich and the poor but I  
Cant find the energy blame Mary Jane  
Im gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
Im gonna lose my soul in the lonesome afternoon  
Yes I am  
Speak plain Mary Jane  
Could you give your hand to a man that  
Never gave a damn  
Thats why I rather sleep than thinking  
Nothing more than drinking  
All I want is to blame Mary Jane  
Im gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
Im gonna lose my soul to the long lonesome  
Afternoons yes I am  
Im gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
Im gonna lose my soul to the lonesome afternoon  
Oh maybe I wont be your whipping boy  
I wont be your whipping boy  
Shame baby shame oh shame sweet Mary Jane  
I truly do love you  
She said that I should care more  
For that body of yours  
If you carry the weight of the world oh my  
Im gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
Im gonna lose my soul in the long lonesome afternoon  
Yes I am  
Im gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
Im gonna lose my soul in the lonesome afternoon  
Maybe I will be your whipping boy  
Maybe I will
