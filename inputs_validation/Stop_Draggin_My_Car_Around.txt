Had to park my car for just five minutes  
I had to go inside to use the phone  
When I came back again my car was gone Well  
I didnt know it was a loading zone  
What a bummer I is so brought down  
I had to chase that tow truck a over town yellin  
  
Stop draggin my  
Stop draggin my  
Stop draggin my car around  
  
Took my baby to the local disco  
I was jumpin like a maniac  
But the owner came and pulled me off the floor Then  
He took me to his little office in the back  
He said I really like your snaggletooth necklace  
Your pants are groovy and your hairs okay  
But man that car of yours is so uncool  
Like wow Im sorry but we towed it away  
  
Stop draggin my  
Stop draggin my  
Stop draggin my car around  
  
Now Im at home Im watchin Gilligans Island  
Guess its time to trade my old car in  
For twenty dollars and my 64 Plymouth  
Maybe I could get a secondhand Schwinn  
Look out the window theres a  
Tow truck in the driveway  
I grabbed the driver and I asked him why  
He said Im sorry kid youre late with the payments  
Its time to kiss your little car goodbye  
  
Stop draggin my  
Stop draggin my  
Stop draggin my car around  
Stop draggin my car around  
  
Listen the checks in the mail No really  
Stop draggin my car around  
Oh man I just had the hub caps painted  
Stop draggin my car around  
Hey Hey I left a sandwich in the back seat
