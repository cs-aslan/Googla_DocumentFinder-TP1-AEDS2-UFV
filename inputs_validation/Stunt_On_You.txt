Its ten oclock on a wednesday and I know your home  
Driving up and down your street hoping that you come outside  
Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted  
And I just need you to see me alone  
Childish as it seems itll make it all better Better  
Selfish as it is this just aint about you no  
Did me wrong eveytime we were together Gether  
And thats why  
  
Im gonna stunt on you  
Im gonna stunt on you  
  
You let me go  
Little did you know  
I could have made it all on my own
