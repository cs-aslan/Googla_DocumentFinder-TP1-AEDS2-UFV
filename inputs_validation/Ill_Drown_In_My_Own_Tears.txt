He brings a tear into my eyes  
When I begin Lord to realize  
If you dont think that honey youll be lonesome  
You know Ill drown drown oh Lord in my own tears  
  
I know its true into his mind  
A little rain is bound to fall  
But since you been gone honey Im so blue  
It just keeps rainin keeps right on rainin more and more  
  
I didnt cry just like a child  
My poor tears Lord they were runnin wild  
If you dont think that baby youll be home soon now  
You know Ill drown drown oh Lord in my own tears
