You think youre special  
You think youre cool  
Youre so invincible  
Youre nobodys fool  
  
Dead man walking  
Your egos high  
No matter who you are  
Were all gonna die  
  
Your time is coming  
Your soul is burning  
Your futures fading  
I Cant Save You  
  
Your demons waking  
Your will is breaking  
Your bodys shaking  
I Cant Save You now now now now  
  
Youve got to save yourself  
I cant save you now now now now  
Youve got to save yourself  
I cant save you now now now now  
  
The years are passing  
The time goes fast  
Youre in denial  
With your head up your ass  
  
Cant take it with you  
Leave it behind  
So many ways to live  
Theres one way to die  
  
Your god is calling  
Your tears are falling  
Youre heads exploding  
I cant save you  
  
No use in trying  
You cant stop crying  
You feel like dying  
I cant save you now now now now  
  
Youve got to save yourself  
I cant save you now now now now  
Youve got to save yourself  
I cant save you  
  
Tempted by your twisted mind  
You destroyed your selfcontrol  
For fame and fortune you gave it all  
No one said you had to sell your soul  
  
Solo  
  
Your time is coming  
Your soul is burning  
Your futures fading  
I cant save you  
  
Your demons waking  
Your will is breaking  
Your bodys shaking  
I cant save you  
  
Your god is calling  
Your tears are falling  
Your heads exploding  
I cant save you  
  
No use in trying  
You cant stop crying  
You feel like dying  
I cant save you now
