Lets run baby through these city streets  
Were all victims of captivity  
Lets stop the madness without any tricks  
Ill whisper bible quotes and you can read my lips  
  
Lets get back to the fundamental things  
Lets get back to the elements of style  
Lets get back to where it all began  
Lets get back to the fundamental things  
  
Lets dance barefoot over broken glass  
Slither like a snake does through the wet cold grass  
Howl and tremble in a sleepless grind  
Lets do the brain drain and leave it all behind  
  
Lets get back to the fundamental things  
Lets get back to the elements of style  
Lets get back to where it all began  
Lets get back to the fundamental things  
  
You can sit in your room and worry  
You can contemplate the end  
Or let your house burn down behind you  
Run with me through the streets again  
  
Lets get back I wanna go back  
Lets get back lets get back  
  
Lets get back to the fundamental things  
Lets get back to the elements of style  
Lets get back to where it all began  
Lets get back to the fundamental things  
  
You can hide out on your rooftop  
Wishing you had never been  
Or go down to Hals Bar and Grill  
And find your innocence again  
  
Lets get back lets get back  
Lets get back I wanna go back  
Ive got to go back
