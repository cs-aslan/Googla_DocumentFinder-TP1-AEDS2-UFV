I remember it all very well lookin back  
It was the summer I turned eighteen  
We lived in a one room rundown shack  
On the outskirts of New Orleans  
We didnt have money for food or rent  
To say the least we were hard pressed  
Then Mama spent every last penny we had  
To buy me a dancin dress  
  
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair  
And she painted my eyes and lips then I stepped into a satin  
Dancin dress that had a split on the side clean up to my hip  
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good  
Standin back from the lookin glass  
There stood a woman where a half gown kid had stood  
  
She said heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down  
Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down  
  
Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck  
And she kissed my cheek  
Then I saw the tears wellin up in her troubled eyes  
When she started to speak  
She looked at a pitiful shack  
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath  
She said your Pas run off and Im real sick  
And the babys gonna starve to death  
  
She handed me a heart shaped locket that said  
To thine own self be true  
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across  
The toe of my high heel shoe  
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin  
Askin Mama what do I do  
She said just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy  
And theyll be nice to you  
  
She said heres your chance Fancy dont let me down  
Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down  
Lord forgive me for what I do but if you want out  
Well its up to you  
Now dont let me down you better start movin uptown  
  
Well that was the last time I saw my Ma  
The night I left that rickety shack  
The welfare people came and took the baby  
Mama died and I aint been back  
  
But the wheels of fate had started to turn  
And for me there was no way out  
And it wasnt very long til I knew exactly  
What my Mamas been talkin about  
  
I knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow  
That Is gonna be a lady someday  
Though I dont know when or how  
I couldnt see spending the rest of my life  
With my head hung down in shame you know  
I might have been born just plain white trash  
But Fancy was my name  
  
Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down  
Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down  
  
It wasnt very long after a benevolent man  
Took me off the street  
And one week later I was pourin his tea  
In a five room hotel suite  
  
I charmed a king a congressman  
And an occasional aristocrat  
Then I got me a Georgia mansion  
In an elegant New York townhouse flat  
And I aint done bad  
  
Now in this world theres a lot of selfrighteous hypocrite  
That would call me bad  
And criticize Mama for turning me out  
No matter how little we had  
  
But though I aint had to worry bout nothin  
For nigh on fifteen years  
I can still hear the desperation in my poor  
Mamas voice ringin in my ear  
  
She said heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down  
Heres your one chance Fancy dont let me down  
Lord forgive me for what I do  
But if you want out well its up to you  
Now dont let me down  
Your Mamas gonna help you uptown  
  
I guess she did
