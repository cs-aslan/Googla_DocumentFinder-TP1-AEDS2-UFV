Id give you my ring Id fill you with promises  
Id give you anything you want  
If you told me that we could be more than friends  
Run with me baby on a magic carpet ride  
Well live for tomorrow everything Ill be alright  
Cause it dont matter what they say  
  
Shes Bobbys girl Johnny youre playing with dynamite  
Shes Bobbys girl close the door baby itll be alright  
Come on lets go  
  
When they say shes Bobbys girl Johnny youre playing with dynamite  
Shes Bobbys girl close the door honey itll be alright now  
  
Shes Bobbys girl come on baby come with me tonight  
Shes Bobbys girl close the door baby itll be alright now
