Yeh you must treat your lover girl right  
If you want to make lovers rock  
You must know a place you can kiss to make lovers rock  
Cause everybody knows its a crying shame  
But nobody knows the poor babys name  
When she forgot that thing that she had to swallow  
  
You Western man youre free with your seed  
When you make lovers rock  
But woops there goes the strength that you need  
To make real cool lovers rock  
Cause a genuine lover takes off his clothes  
And he can make a lover in a thousand gos  
An she dont need that thing that she had to swallow
