Im melting in the sun  
And this is what they call the life  
I suppose too much sun  
Makes a desert Arab say  
I really love this country  
And theres a lot I want to see  
  
Great expectations  
Of all we seem to be  
And the winner  
And the winner and the winner  
  
Do you want to make a story up  
Theres enough it always seems  
If it happened all this morning  
Tonight well see it on TV  
  
Great expectations  
Of all we seem to be  
Great expectations  
Take a look around you  
Of all we seem to be  
Take a look around you  
And the winner  
And the winner and the winner  
  
She was twelve and knew the world  
Her boyfriend knew a dance to this  
Everybodys got advice  
Take a snake take a ladder  
And this is what they call the life  
Im melting in the sun  
  
Great expectations  
Of all we seem to be  
Great expectations  
Take a look around you  
Of all we seem to be  
Take a look around you  
And the winner  
And the winner and the winner
