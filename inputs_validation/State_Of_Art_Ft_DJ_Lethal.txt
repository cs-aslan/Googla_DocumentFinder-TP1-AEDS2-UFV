Theres no way to find out whats inside you  
Until you fall into the hole  
You dug for yourself while you slept here  
Too young too selfish too cold  
And when you find out whats been waiting  
The moment you open your eyes  
Youll see your true reflection  
The very first time in your life  
  
You can not fight whats in you  
Its going to be denied  
You can not fight whats in you  
Its going to be denied  
  
Cry to yourself  
Nothing will help  
Its too late to change whats been done  
You do what youve always done best  
You run  
  
Into the hole you fall deeper  
Deeper the faster you run  
It wont stop until youve accepted  
Accept everythng that youve done  
  
You can not fight whats in you  
Its going to be denied  
You can not fight whats in you  
Its going to be denied  
  
Cry to yourself  
Nothing will help  
Its too late to change whats been done  
You do what youve always done best  
You run
