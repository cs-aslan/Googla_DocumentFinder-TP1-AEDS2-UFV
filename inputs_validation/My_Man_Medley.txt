Spoken  
I just wanna say this  
This is something I thing most of you ladies will identify with  
And maybe some of you men too  
the man I love  
Someday hell come along  
The man I love  
And hell be rich and strong  
The man I love  
And when he comes my way  
Ill do my best to make him stay  
Hell look at me and smile  
Ill understand  
And maybe for awhile  
Hell take my hand  
And though it seems absurd  
I know we both wont say a word  
Spoken  
You know Im the kind of lady  
That always seems to find the wrong man  
At the wrong place at the wrong time  
Its not that I go out looking for him  
But somehow he always seems to find me  
You see what Im looking for is the kind of man  
That comes home with candy  
And flowers sayin come on put on your dancing shoes  
Cause were gonna wine and dine wine and dine  
But what I always seem to find is the kind of man  
That comes home fussing  
And fighting breaking my best dishes  
And beat my head outside the wall  
Shows no love no respect and nothing at all  
I got it bad and that aint good  
Never treats me sweet and gentle  
The way he should  
I got it bad and that aint good  
no it aint good at all you know  
Spoken  
Listen have you been treating your lady nice lately you have  
And how about you  
Great well Ive been gettin rocked completely  
My poor heart is sentimental its not made of wood  
I got it bad and that aint good  
Spoken  
So you see on Monday nights  
I just go out and drink and drink  
But when the weekends over on Monday rolls aroun  
I end up like I start out just cryin my heart out  
Cryin my heart out  
Lord above me come on make him love me  
Then he should  
I got it bad baby  
I got it bad baby  
I got it bad and that aint good  
No it aint good at all you know  
Spoken  
But listen mister big shot Ive got your number  
And Ill take care of you  
And you too and you and you and you  
some of these days  
Some of these days  
Youre gonna miss your donna  
Some of these days  
Youre gonna feel so lonely  
Youll miss my huggin  
Youll miss my kissin  
Youll miss me honey  
When youre far away  
Youre gonna be so lonely  
For me only  
Cause you know daddy  
You had you way  
And if I leave you  
You know its gonna grieve you  
Youre gonna miss your sweet lovin donna  
Some of these days  
And if I leave you  
You know its gonna grieve you  
Youre gonna miss your sweet little donna  
Some of these days  
Hey honey call me when you got time  
Know what I mean
