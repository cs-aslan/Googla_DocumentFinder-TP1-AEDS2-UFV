I feel like a stranger in this home I share with you  
I cant understand this awful change youre going through  
But lately Ive been watching you grow colder every day  
And Id rather be gone than in your way  
Id rather be gone than in your way Id rather have someone else here in my
place  
And if I decide on leaving my world will end today  
But Id rather be gone than in your way  
  
Id rather be gone
