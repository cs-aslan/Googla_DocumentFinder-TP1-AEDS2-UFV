Sooner or later you will find a way  
To feel like sunshine even on a cloudy day  
To feel like morning in the dead of night  
Sooner or later its gonna be all right  
  
Now dont go thinking your lifes a mess  
Rather start thinkin in terms of happiness  
  
And its gonna happen  
Just decide were youre goin  
Get out in the open  
And start blazin your own trail again  
  
It takes time sometimes to figure out  
That theres nothing to worry about  
And that theres plenty to be thankful for  
It takes time sometimes to know the score  
  
See everybodys got a smile inside  
So put it upon your face and wear it with pride  
  
And its gonna happen  
Just decide were youre goin  
Get out in the open  
And start blazin your own trail again
