Open the door and come in  
Im so glad to see you my friend  
I dont know how long it has been  
Having those feelings again  
But now I see that youre so happy  
And ooh it just sets me free  
And Id like to see us as good of friends  
As we used to be  
AhMy loveAh  
  
Youre in love  
Thats the way it sould be  
Cause I want you to be happy  
Youre In Love  
And I know that youre not in love with me  
Ooh its enough for me to know that Youre In Love  
I can let you go  
Cause I know that Youre In Love  
  
Sometimes its hard to believe  
That youre never coming back for me  
Ive had this dream that youd always be by my side  
Oh I couldve died  
But now I see that youre so happy  
And ooh it just sets me free  
And Id like to see us as good of friends  
As we used to be  
AhMy loveAh  
  
Youre in love  
Thats the way it sould be  
Cause I want you to be happy  
Youre In Love  
And I know that youre not in love with me  
Ooh its enough for me to know that Youre In Love  
I can let you go  
Cause I know that Youre In Love  
  
I tried to find you but you were so far away  
I was praying that fate would bring you back to me  
Someday someday someday  
Ooh Youre In Love  
  
Ooh its enough for me to know that Youre In Love  
Now Ill let you go  
Cause I know that Youre In LoveNo  
No No No No No No No Ooh
