The summer sun is fading as the year grows old  
And darker days are drawing near  
The winter winds will be much colder  
Now youre not here  
I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky  
And one by one they disappear  
I wish that I was flying with them  
Now youre not here  
  
Like a song through the trees you came to love me  
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away  
  
Through autumns golden gown we used to kick our way  
You always loved this time of year  
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now  
Cause youre not here  
  
Like a song through the trees you came to love me  
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away  
  
A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes  
As if to hide a lonely tear  
My life will be forever autumn  
Cause youre not here
