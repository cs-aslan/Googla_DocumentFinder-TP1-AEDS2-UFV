Well in this world of sorrow trouble and temptation  
Jesus always promised trial and tribulation  
Then He said You dont have to fret or fear  
Children be of good cheer and keep walkin on  
Children keep walkin on keep walkin on  
Keep walkin on keep walkin on  
  
In Jesus Christ the truth is found  
Hell keep our feet on solid ground  
Sometimes we have to just believe  
What He put in the Book for us to read  
Satan you cant fool this girl  
My Lord overcame this world  
And Im walkin on yeah Im walkin on  
Lord Im walkin on yeah Im walkin on  
  
Well Jesus walked on the water Peter walked on it too  
God gave you the power to do what you cannot do  
Every road we travel Hes traveled down before  
There aint no need to worry where it leads to anymore  
Im walkin on Im walkin on Im walkin on  
Im walkin on Im walkin on Im walkin on  
  
Well the road is narrow and its straight  
But it leads right up to the Golden Gate  
It may be rough it may be long  
But I dont have to walk alone  
Step by step and day by day  
He takes my hand and I hear Him say  
Keep walkin on gotta keep walkin on  
Oh keep walkin on oh keep walkin on  
  
What you gonna do cant pay the rent  
Yeah what you gonna do when the moneys spent  
What you gonna do when you just cant cope  
Hey what you gonna do when youre outta hope  
Oh keep walkin on oh keep walkin on
