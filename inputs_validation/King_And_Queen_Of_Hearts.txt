Were the king and queen of hearts  
Hold me when the music starts  
All my dreams come true  
When I dance with you  
  
Promise me youre mine tonight  
Ive been waitin lyin tonight  
While the lights are low  
Ill never let you go  
  
Hoh Did I dream that we danced forever  
In a wish that we made together  
On a night that I prayed would never end end  
  
You know its not my imagination  
Or a part of the orchestration  
Love was here at the culmination  
Im the king and youre the queen of hearts  
  
Time will pass and tears will fall  
But someday well both recall  
Moments made of this  
Golden memories  
  
Hoh Did I dream that we danced forever  
In a wish that we made together  
On a night that I prayed would never end end  
  
In a once and future dream  
Where the dances never seem to start  
  
Hoh Did I dream that we danced forever  
In a wish that we made together  
On a night that I prayed would never end end
