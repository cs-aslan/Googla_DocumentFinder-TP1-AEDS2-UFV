This next song is  
Is dedicated to those American fighting girls  
  
Thats right  
Those American fighting girls  
Who arent afraid to take the law into their own hands  
To die if necessary  
To keep our cities safe from criminal scum  
  
The oingo boingo proudly salutes the American commando girls  
  
Commando girls  
Commando girls  
Commando girls wont you come out tonight  
Commando girls wont you come out and fight  
Commando girls Youll never never catch them crying  
  
By daytime theyre receptionists  
Accountant girls so clean  
Late at night they hit the streets  
Soldiers with a dream  
  
When they go out they arm themselves  
With kakis and fatigues  
Theyre tough as nails and armed to the teeth  
With automatic M16s  
  
Iconoclastic girls that know the plan  
To finnish the job like no one else can  
To fight so the citys safe for you and me  
  
Oh  
Commando girls wont you come out tonight  
Commando girls wont you come out and fight  
Commando girls youll never never catch them crying  
  
They prowl the streets in disciplined packs  
Looking for acts of violence  
Sweet little poison pussycats  
They travel smooth and silent  
  
And when they spot their guilty prey  
They waste no time on busts  
They stand their ground and open fire  
Unload their might of justice  
  
Oh  
Take no prisoners and leave no clues  
Read all about it in the morning news  
Nobody out there knows what really happened  
  
Oh  
Command girls wont you come out tonight  
Commando girls wont you come out and fight  
Commando girls youll never never catch them crying  
  
guitar solo  
  
When my little girl comes home at night  
Exhausted from her fighting  
When she unzips her camouflage tights  
She always looks so inviting  
  
Slippery skin all covered with sweat  
Shivering in the moonlight  
Smell the gunpowder and sweet hot breath  
Were gonna have fun tonight  
  
Oh  
Under the covers its hard to know  
She risked her life just minutes ago  
A stiff salute to their courage and their passion  
  
Commando girls  
  
repeat this verse 3x  
Giddy up Giddy up Get em all right  
Round em up round em up round em up tight  
Ready now ready now ready for the fight  
Shoot em up shoot em up shoot em in the night  
  
Commando girls wont you come out tonight  
Commando girls wont you come out and fight  
Commando girls youll never never catch them crying  
  
Never catch them crying  
Never catch them crying  
Commando girls  
Commando girls  
Commando girls  
Commando girls  
Commando girls
