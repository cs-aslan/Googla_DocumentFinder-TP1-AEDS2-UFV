Theres a place I go  
And I am far away  
Theres a TV show  
And I can grow  
  
Sometimes the hero takes me  
Sometimes I dont let go  
Hello hello  
  
Theres a picture book  
With colored photographs  
Theres a comic strip  
That makes me laugh  
  
Sometimes the lady takes me  
Sometimes I dont let go  
Hello hello

Theres a place I go  
And its a part of me  
Theres a radio  
And I will crawl  
  
Sometimes the hero takes me  
Sometimes I cant let go  
Hello hello
