When I was a young boy  
Back in Orangefield  
I used to gaze out  
My classroom window and dream  
And then go home and listen to Ray sing  
I believe to my soul after school  
Oh that love that was within me  
You know it carried me through  
Well it lifted me up and it filled me  
Meditation contemplation too  
  
Chorus  
Oh weve got to go back  
Got to go back  
Got to go back  
Got to go back  
For the healing go on with the dreaming  
  
Well theres people in the street  
And the summers almost here  
Weve got to go outside in the fresh air  
And breathe while its still clear  
Breathe it in all the way down  
To your stomach too  
And breathe it out with a radiance  
Into the night time air  
  
Chorus  
  
Got my ticket at the airport  
Well I guess Ive been marking time  
Ive been living in another country  
That operates along entirely different lines  
Keep me away from porter or whiskey  
Dont play anything sentimental itll make me cry  
Ive got to go back my friend  
Is there really any need to ask why  
  
Chorus  
With the dreaming  
With the dreaming  
With the dreaming
