When Christ was born of Mary free  
In Bethlehem in that fair city  
Angels sung eer with mirth and glee  
  
Chorus  
In excelsis gloria  
In excelsis gloria  
In excelsis gloria  
In excelsis gloria  
  
Herdmen beheld these angels bright  
To them appeared with great light  
And said Gods son is born this night  
  
Chorus  
  
This King is come to save His kind  
In the Scripture as we find
