With you I dont hear the minutes ticking by  
I dont feel the hours as they fly  
I dont see the summer as it wanes  
Just a subtle change of light upon your face  
  
Walk away walk away walk away walk away  
This is our kingdom of days  
  
I watched the sun as it rises and sets  
I watched the moon trace its arc with no regret  
My jacket round your shoulders the falling leaves  
The wet grass on our backs as the autumn breeze drifts through the trees  
  
Walk away walk away walk away walk away  
This is our kingdom of days  
This is our kingdom of days  
  
I love you I love you I love you I love you I do  
You whisper Then prove it then prove it then prove it to me baby  
  
When I count my blessings and youre mine for always  
We laughed beneath the covers  
And count the wrinkles and the grays  
  
Sing away sing away sing away sing away  
Sing away sing away my darling well sing away  
This is our kingdom of days  
This is our kingdom of days  
This is our kingdom of days  
This is our kingdom of days  
This is our kingdom of days
