Empty nights  endless days  
Sometimes love turns out that way  
Yes I know  it went too fast  
But you cant keep livin your life in the past  
Todays the first day of the rest of your life  
Its up to you to make the best of your life  
Open your eyes its another day  
She was there  she was gone  
You dont know how youll get along  
Ive been there  and I recall  
Better that than never to have loved at all  
Todays the first day of the rest of your life  
Youve got to go and make the best of your life  
For every night theres another day  
Yes you say youve been in love before  
Youve been around and you know the score  
But when the tears fill your eyes  
Then sometimes they can blind you  
So my friend  you must know  
Love will come  and love may go  
But when it does dont despair  
Every space has someone just meant to be there  
Todays the first day of the rest of your life  
I know youre gonna make the best of your life  
Todays the first day of the rest of your life  
Lift up your eyes its the rest of your life
