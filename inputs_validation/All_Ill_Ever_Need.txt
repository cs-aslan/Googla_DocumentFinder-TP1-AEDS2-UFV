Some days Im fragile  
Some days Im stronger  
Sometimes I just want to run  
But Your tender mercies gently pursue me  
When all is said and done  
  
Chorus  
Where else would I go  
Who else could there be  
No one but You Lord can see  
Can see all of me oh  
You opened my eyes  
Oh how I believe  
In everything You are cause You are  
All Ill ever need  
  
My hearts full of questions  
The futures uncertain  
But Im gonna stand on whats true  
Cause I have discovered  
A love like no other  
The love Ive found in You  
  
Chorus
