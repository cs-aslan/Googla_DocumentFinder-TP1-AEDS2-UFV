Chorus  
Hey Willy your mother calls you Billy  
Your father calls you silly  
But you really are a pretty one  
  
Hey baby youre dressing like a lady  
The fellows call you Sadie  
But you really are a pretty one  
  
You dont care  
What they say about your hair  
Cause the bad mans smiling  
Every time he sees you comin yeah  
  
Willy is the singer in a rocknroll band  
Every time he shows his face  
Put away your  
  
Oh yeah Willys gonna show them now  
No no no no Willys gonna go somehow  
  
My names Willy gonna turn on the lights  
Playing rocknroll music to early early night  
Cant stop dancing to the rhythm in your feet  
Listen to the drummer Yeah listen to the beat  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey baby youre dressing like a lady  
The fellows call you Sadie  
But you really are a pretty one  
  
You dont care  
What they say about your hair  
Cause the bad mans smiling  
Every time he sees you comin yeah  
  
Chorus
