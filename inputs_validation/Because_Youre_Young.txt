Psychodelicate girl  
Come out to play  
Little metal facedboy  
Dont stay away  
Theyre so wartorn and resigned  
She cant talk anymore  
What are they trying to prove  
What would they like to find  
  
Its love back to front and no sides like I say  
These pieces are broken like I say  
These pieces are broken  
Hope Im wrong but I know  
  
CHORUS  
Because youre young  
Youll meet a stranger some night  
Because youre young  
What could be nicer for you  
And it makes me sad  
So Ill dance my life away  
A million dreams a million scars  
  
He punishes hard  
Was loving her such a crime  
She took back everything she said  
Left him nearly out of his mind  
Theyre people I know  
People I love  
They seem so unhappy  
Dead or alive  
  
Its love back to front and no sides like I say  
These pieces are broken like I say  
These pieces are broken  
Hope Im wrong but I know  
  
CHORUS  
  
A million dreams  
A million scars  
A million repeat ad inf
