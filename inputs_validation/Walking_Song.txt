Words and music by Leah Kunkel  
Oh last night I sat by your side  
Oh I was feelin so lonely  
Would have given up my pride  
All night I was so lonely  
Then you took to the streets  
You dont have much to say  
But I listened to your feet  
As they walked away  
Bye bye bye bye  
Now walkings the only thing I know  
Oh we do well together  
I aint thinkin bout where we go  
Lace up your boots of leather  
Then we take to the streets  
We dont have much to say  
But I listen to our feet  
As we walk away  
Bye bye bye  
I wasnt lookin for love  
Im a little sorry youre gore  
But until we have something to say  
Lll just keep walking along  
Bye bye bye  
Ask me if I need you now  
Oh no Im feeling great  
If you hunt me in my dreams  
Ah there is one escape  
Ill just take to the streets  
I wont have much to say  
But Ill be listening to my feet  
As they walk away  
Bye bye bye
