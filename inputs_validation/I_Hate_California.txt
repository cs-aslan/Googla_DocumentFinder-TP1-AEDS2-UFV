Shes probably in a Bentley  
Showing off her new fake boobies  
Tryin to break into the movies  
With some producer  
Who seduced her  
With some sushi and cologne  
  
Shes probably down on Sunset  
Doin all the things that she aint done yet  
With some actor she calls Hector  
Man I wish he meet Phil Spector  
And hed ask to take her home  
  
Shes lovin CalifornIa  
She loves the beach  
She loves to party everyday  
Pina Coladas on the sidewalk in LA  
Ever since she went away  
I hate California  
  
Maybe shes livin in a commune  
Dancin with Hippies under the moon  
Its all free love weed and patchouli  
And theres a guru named Visuli  
And hes doin her for sure  
  
Maybe shes scummin some big rap star  
Drinkin pink Cosmos at the Sky Bar  
Those Hollyweirdos with their tofu avocado  
I bet she think she won the lotto good for her  
  
Shes lovin CalifornIa  
She loves the beach  
She loves to party everyday  
Pina Coladas on the sidewalk in LA  
Ever since she went away  
I hate California  
  
I think I seen her on TV  
Last night on TMZ  
With the pretty people on parade  
Shes sellin Scientology with John Tommy and Katie  
Man I guess shes really got it made  
  
Shes lovin CalifornIa  
That string bikini and the sunshine on her face  
  
Shes lovin CalifornIa  
She loves the beach  
She loves to party everyday  
Pina Coladas on the sidewalk in LA  
Ever since she went away  
I hate California
