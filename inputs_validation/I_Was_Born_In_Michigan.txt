I was born in Michigan  
And I wish and wish again  
That I was back in the town where I was born  
Theres a farm in Michigan  
And Id like to fish again  
In the river that flows beside the field of waving corn  
A lonesome soul am I Heres the reason why  
I want to go back I want to go back   
I want to go back to the farm  
Far away from harm with a milk pail on my arm   
I miss the rooster the one that useter wake me up at 4am  
I think your great big cities very pretty Nevertheless  
I want to be there   
I want to see there a certain soemone full of charm   
Thats why I wish again that I was in Michigan down on the farm  
I want to go back I want to go back  
I want to go back to that old farm  
Far away from harm with a milk pail on my arm  
I miss the rooster the rooster that useter wake me up at 4am  
I think your great big cities very pretty Nevertheless  
I want to be there  
I want to see there a certain someone full of charm  
Thats why I wish again  
That I was in Michigan down on the farm
