Ive flown the house of freezing the house of freezing steel  
And though my bodys back I know it cant be real  
Cause Ive been on that house without a guiding wheel  
The house of freezing steel  
Oh wheres it going picked me up at seven  
When my eyes were weak from the light of the morning  
Oh sister wont you tell me what a man might want to know  
This madness is fine yes if youre mad at the time  
  
Back on the house of freezing the house of freezing steel  
The tied my body up Im forced to eat my meal  
A cold plate of lamb and cold potatoes too  
Now whats a soul to do  
Oh Lord above brother wont you tell me  
Is this a Eucharistic dove  
Cause Ive been waiting for the right one to appear  
But Ive seen it in your face and baby this aint the place  
  
Up on the house of freezing the house of freezing steel  
I made my mind up then to get me to the wheel  
I made the cabin door the pilot turned around  
He said were Venus bound  
Oh please take me home  
After all Im only human and the Earth is where I belong  
I must have looked pitiful to this freak without a face  
Cause as he touched my head I saw myself back in bed  
  
Ive flown the house of freezing the house of freezing steel  
And though my bodys back I know it cant be real  
Cause Ive been on that house without a guiding wheel  
The house of freezing steel
