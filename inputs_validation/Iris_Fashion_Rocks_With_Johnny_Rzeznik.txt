Avril  
  
And Id give up forever to touch you  
cause I know that you feel me somehow  
Youre the closest to heaven that Ill ever be  
And I dont want to go home right now  
  
And all I can taste is this moment  
And all I can breathe is your life  
cause sooner or later its over  
I just dont want to miss you tonight  
  
And I dont want the world to see me  
cause I dont think that theyd understand  
When everythings made to be broken  
I just want you to know who I am  
  
Johnny  
And you cant fight the tears that aint coming  
Or the moment of truth in your lies  
When everything feels like the movies  
Yeah youd bleed just to know youre alive  
  
Both  
And I dont want the world to see me  
cause I dont think that theyd understand  
When everythings made to be broken  
I just want you to know who I am  
  
Avril  
And I dont want the world to see me  
cause I dont think that theyd understand  
When everythings made to be broken  
I just want you to know who I am  
  
Both  
And I dont want the world to see me  
cause I dont think that theyd understand  
When everythings made to be broken  
I just want you to know who I am  
  
I just want you to know who I am  
I just want you to know who I am  
I just want you to know who I am
