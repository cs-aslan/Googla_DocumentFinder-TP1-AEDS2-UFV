Many too many have stood where I stand  
Many more will stand here too  
I think what I find strange is the way you built me up  
Then knocked me down again  
  
The part was fun but now its over  
Why cant I just leave the stage  
Maybe thats because you securely locked me up  
Then threw away the key  
  
Oh mama  
Please would you find the key  
Oh pretty mama  
Please wont you let me go free  
I thought I was lucky  
I thought that Id got it made  
How could I be so blind  
  
You said goodbye on a corner  
That I thought led to the straight  
You set me on a firmly laid and simple course  
Then removed the road  
  
Oh mama  
Please help me find my way  
Oh pretty mama  
Please lead me through the next day  
I thought I was lucky  
Oh I thought that Id got it made  
How could I be so blind Oh no
