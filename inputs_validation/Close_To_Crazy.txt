I still reach for you  
In the middle of my dreams each night  
But my arms come up empty every time  
And lately I talk to your memory  
More than I should  
If I could just forget the past I would  
Cause this missing you aint doing me no good  
  
Chorus  
Im so close to crazy  
Right on the edge  
Just one step away from going insane  
But Im not there yet  
If I could just lose my mind  
I wouldnt know were through  
But this close to crazy  
Is far from over you  
  
Today I caught myself  
Reliving how it used to be  
At a table for two just you and me  
But talking to an empty chair  
And laughing right out loud  
Turned everybodys head and left no doubt  
Im a broken woman close to breaking down  
  
Chorus  
  
I still reach for you  
In the middle of my dreams each night
