You gave it to me real low  
You gave me such a low blow  
You caught me with my guard down  
You floored me in the first round  
You gave it to me real low  
You gave me such a low blow  
You hit me on the blind side  
You took me for a big ride  
But I wont let it get to me  
I couldnt go through all that  
No I wont let it get to me  
Ill try and hold it all back  
And get even with you

Youll get whats comin to you  
You gave it to me real low  
You give me such a low blow  
You kick a man when hes down  
You kick him when hes on the ground yeah yeah  
You gave it to me real low  
You give me such a low blow  
You got me in a tailspin  
You really tried to do me in  
But I wont let it get to me  
I couldnt go through all that  
No I wont let it get to me  
Ill try and hold it all back  
But Ill get even with you
