Waiting for the last leaf to fall  
Can I hear a cry for a dead man to crawl  
Asleep like stones in the well  
Empty as you leave your dry seashell  
  
Never seen you come this far  
Never thought Id hope this hard  
  
Like air Always looking down upon yourself  
Like air You live two feet above yourself  
Somewhere We will always be in parallel  
Out there Its a place without a hope in hell  
Like air  
  
Havent made a sound all week  
Tryin to gather up some promises to keep  
I watched as the icicles fell  
Pinned to the bottom or drowning its hard to tell  
  
You may be human after all Ive never seen you come far  
Must you build yourself so tall  
  
Like air Always looking down upon yourself  
Like air You live two feet above yourself  
Somewhere We will always be in parallel  
Out there Its a place without a hope in hell  
Like air  
  
Tryin to wash your trace off my skin  
Cover up the footprints Ive been walkin in  
Its easier to cut you cold  
You can keep your waste of space Im halfway home  
  
You may be human after all Ive never seen you come far  
Must you build yourself so tall  
  
Like air Always looking down upon yourself  
Like air You live two feet above yourself  
Somewhere We will always be in parallel  
Out there Its a place without a hope in hell  
Like air
