Hey everybody Im a talking to you  
I aint telling you jealous  
Its just the natural truth  
Oh oh oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Thinking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do  
  
My moneys gone the fun is gone  
The way things look I cant be here long  
Oh oh oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Thinking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do  
  
Taking all my money to pay the tax  
Im telling you people the natural facts  
Im telling you people in my belief  
I am headed straight on relief  
Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Thinking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do  
  
I aint got a dime aint got a cent  
Aint got no money to pay my rent  
She wants some clothes she wants some shoes  
Im telling you people I dont know what to do  
Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Talking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do  
  
Taking all my money to pay the tax  
Im telling you people the natural facts  
Im telling you people in my belief  
I am headed straight on relief  
Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Thinking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do  
  
Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Talking about me and you and what the hell are we gonna do
