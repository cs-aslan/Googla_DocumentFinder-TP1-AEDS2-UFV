I could tell the meaning of a word like serene  
I got some O Grades when I was sixteen  
I can tell the difference between margarine and butter  
I can say Saskatchewan without starting to stutter  
  
But I cant understand why we let someone else rule our land  
Were Cap in Hand  
  
I could get a broken jaw from being in a fight  
I know its evening when day turns to night  
I can understand why Stranraer lie so lowly  
They could save a lot of points by signing Hibs Goalie  
  
But I cant understand why we let someone else rule our land  
Were Cap in Hand  
  
We fight when they ask us  
We boast then we cower  
We beg  
For a piece of  
Whats already ours  
  
Once I thought I could make God a bribe  
So I said I was in his lost tribe  
Getting handouts can be so frustrating  
Get in line son theres five million waiting  
  
I cant understand why you let someone else rule your land  
Youre Cap In Hand
