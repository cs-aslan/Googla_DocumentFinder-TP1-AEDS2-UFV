Im always thinking  
Of someone new  
Im never sitting  
OK with you  
Theres always something else on my mind  
Theres always something I cant find  
  
Chorus  
You think about anything you can  
I think about you  
Ill think about anything its true  
  
Im almost perfect  
Some of the time  
Im also sinking  
Some of the time  
  
Im almost ready  
Yeah its almost true  
For almost anyone but you  
  
Chorus  
  
Im always sinking  
Beneath the sand  
Youre holding nothing in your hand  
  
Chorus
