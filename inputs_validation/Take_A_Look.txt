Take a look in the mirror look at yourself  
But dont you look too close cause you just might see the person  
That you hate the most lord whats happening to this human race  
I cant even see one friendly face  
Brothers fight brothers and sisters wink their eyes  
  
While silver tongues bear fruits of poison lies  
Take a look at your children  
Born innocent every boy and every girl  
Denying themselves a real chance  
  
To build a better world  
Oh dear lord whats happening to your precious dream  
I think its washing away on a bloody bloody stream  
Yes take a look at your children  
  
Before its too late and tell them nobody  
Nobody wins when the prize is hate  
Oh no no no its not too late  
We gotta tell all of our children  
That love love love is the way yeah yeah
