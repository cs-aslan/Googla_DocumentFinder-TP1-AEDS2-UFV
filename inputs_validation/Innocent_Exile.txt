My life is so empty nothing to live for  
My mind is all confusion cause I defied the law  
When you werent there to help me I lost my mind and ran  
I never had no trouble before this all began  
  
My life is so empty nothing to live for  
My mind is all confusion cause I defied the law  
When you werent there to help me I lost my mind and ran  
I never had no trouble before this all began  
  
Im running away no where to go  
Im lost and tired and I just dont know yeah  
They say I killed a woman they know it isnt true  
Theyre just trying to frame me and all because of you yeah
