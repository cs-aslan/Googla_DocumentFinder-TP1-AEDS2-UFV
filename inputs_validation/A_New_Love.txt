Loves the only thing I know in this life  
Thats cut me deeper than the sharpest knife  
And once again here I am and Im paying the price for a new love  
I still hurt the one I lost  
Standing here on a bridge that I cant get across  
And I cant burn but I will when I walk with a new love  
  
Chorus  
I believe  
Its gonna be better then ever before  
Thats why Im looking for  
A new love  
For this old heart  
A new love  
And I just cant wait to start  
I want to feel that way again  
Oh when I find a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Say Im looking for a new love  
Somebody tell me where I find a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Loves the only thing thats ever made me cry  
Nothings ever made me feel more alive  
Thats why once again here I am  
Looking for the eyes of a new love  
  
I know that somewhere in this world tonight  
Theres a guy  
She goes high on this part and I have no clue what she says  
Id even look if I thought I might find a new love  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Oh Im looking for a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Oh Im looking for a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Say I need a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Oh Im looking for a new love  
Somebody tell me where Ill find  
For this old heart of mine
