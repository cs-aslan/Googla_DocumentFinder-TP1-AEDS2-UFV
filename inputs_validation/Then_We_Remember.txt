Youve got your secrets girl Ive got mine  
Were fallin apart one glance at a time  
Night after night actin like strangers  
Out of emotion nothing to say  
I brush your shoulder but you turn away  
Nobody tries nobodys changin  
Wholl be the first to say its really the end  
Whos gonna walk out the door  
How did we let it get so out of control  
Our hearts cant take anymore  
  
Then we remember how much we love each other  
Pick the pieces up for one more try  
Then we remember how much we need each other  
Do we really want to say goodbye  
  
One night of passion wont stop the pain  
Back to the same old feelin again  
Time after time is it worth savin  
Wholl be the first to say its really the end  
Whos gonna walk out the door  
How did we let it get so out of control  
Our hearts cant take anymore  
  
Then we remember how much we love each other  
Pick the pieces up for one more try  
Then we remember how much we need each other  
Do we really want to say goodbye  
  
Then we remember how much we love each other  
Pick the pieces up for one more try  
Then we remember how much we need each other  
Do we really want to say goodbye  
  
Then we remember how much we love each other  
Pick the pieces up for one more try  
Then we remember how much we need each other  
Do we really want to say goodbye  
  
Then we remember how much we love each other  
Pick the pieces up for one more try  
Then we remember how much we need each other  
Do we really want to say goodbye
