Mad Love  
  
Your insensitivity is your personality  
Trait least favourite  
Ha ha Funny  
You think youre so funny  
  
But you hurt my feelings  
Weve had some good dealings  
What have I done recently  
To make you so mean to me  
  
Im oversensitive you say  
But I think you were nasty today  
You make me feel nasty  
Like a control freak  
  
I just want to feel helpful  
Like Im needed a sense of reason  
You tell your friends Im a fucking kook  
Look how long it took  
  
Ive been like this all the time  
You dont know what its like to be me  
Youre not paranoid neurotic  
Youre free  
  
I dont like me much anymore  
You make me feel a burden  
You make me feel like a bore
