After school  
Walking home  
Fresh dirt under my fingernails  
And I can smell hot asphalt  
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass  
And I cannot remember  
What life was like through photographs  
Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past  
  
And sometimes its a sad song  
  
Chorus  
But I cannot forget  
Refuse to regret  
So glad I met you and  
Take my breath away  
Make everyday  
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through  
And Mama Ive been cryin  
Cause things aint how they used to be  
She said The battles almost won  
And were only several miles from the sun  
  
Moving on down my street  
I see people I wont ever meet  
Think of her take a breath  
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps  
  
And sometimes its a sad song  
  
Chorus  
  
The rhythm of her conversation  
The perfection of her creation  
The sex she slipped into my coffee  
The way she felt when she first saw me  
Hate to love and love to hate her  
Like a broken record player  
Back and forth and here and gone  
And on and on and on and on  
  
Chorus
