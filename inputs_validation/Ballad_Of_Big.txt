Big Jim Cooley commanded respect  
Whatever he wanted he could get  
The badge on his waistcoat shone in the sun  
It aint no lie Big Jim was feared by everyone  
  
In the saloon one evening Big took a bet  
With a rancher whose name I forget  
He wanted a herd taken over the plain  
And he called Jim yellow hell never do that again  
  
He got mad  
He threw his badge on the floor and walked out  
Hes gonna give it a try he left no doubt  
  
Must be mad must be mad  
The people wished him well and good luck  
Hell I dont need it He laughed  got on  
His horse and rode away  
  
Over on the trail Jim n his crew of five  
Were trying their best to keep the cattle alive  
The weather was hard but so were the men  
Though I dont think even Jimll try this trip again  
  
His horses were edgy sensing trouble ahead  
But the trouble didnt start till the men were in bed  
Awhooping and ahollering and flashing their knives  
Big and his men were jumped by an allstar Indian tribe  
  
  
He was scared Big Jim was scared  
Alive they called him lucky but not today  
Cos he died like all good cowboys with his boots on next to his men  
  
Big Jim he still wont lie down  
For him the bet is still on  
Some say he rides there cursing still  
Some say theyve seen him
