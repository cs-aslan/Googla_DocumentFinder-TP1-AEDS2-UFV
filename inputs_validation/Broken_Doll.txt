Ooh shes just a broken doll  she aint no  
Use at all  since youve been gone  
Ooh shes just a broken toy  shes no ones  
Pride and joy  look what youve done  
You had her on a string  
You made a fool of her  
And thats an awful thing  
She thought shed paid her fare  
Now youve gone and you just dont care  
You cant wind her up  shes a broken doll  
You cant wind her up  although the key fits  
You cant wind her up  shes a broken doll  
Someones thrown away all the pieces  
Now youve played your wicked game  
Dont you feel no shame  
Look what youve done  
Now shes just a broken girl while youre  
All around the world  having your fun  
She had you in her heart  
You made a fool of her right from the very start  
She thought shed paid her fare  
Now youve gone and you just dont care  
You cant wind her up  shes a broken doll  
You cant wind her up  although the key fits  
You cant wind her up  shes a broken doll  
Someones thrown away all the pieces  
Ooh shes just a broken toy  shes no ones  
Pride and joy  look what youve done  
You had her on a string  
You made a fool of her  
And thats an awful thing  
She thought shed paid her fare  
Now youve gone and you just dont care
