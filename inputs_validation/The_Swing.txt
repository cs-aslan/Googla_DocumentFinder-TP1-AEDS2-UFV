Its the swing  
Its the swing like a pendulum  
It marks the moments as the years go by in an innocent phase  
The swing into nevernever land  
There was a darkness like an old friend  
That scratched and crawled up the wall  
Into my life  
Into my destiny  
Into my desire  
  
Its the swing  
Its the swing like a pendulum  
So look behind you when the race has run  
And the winner is named  
The swing into nevernever land  
There was a darkness like an old friend  
That scratched and crawled up the wall  
Into my life  
  
Well its the swing  
The swing like a pendulum  
Between the pieces and between the lines  
Leaving nothing to hide  
There was a darkness like an old friend  
That scratched and crawled up the wall  
Into my life  
Into my destiny  
Into my desire  
  
Its the swing  
Its the swing like a pendulum  
Its the swing  
Its the swing like a pendulum  
Its the swing
