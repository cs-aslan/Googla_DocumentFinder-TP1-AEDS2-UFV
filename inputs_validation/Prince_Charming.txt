Theres a black cloud overhead  
Thats me  
And the poison ivy chokes the tree  
Again its me  
Im the filthy one on Bourbon Street  
You walk on by  
Im the little boy that pushes hard  
And makes it cry  
Theres a dirty needle in your child  
Haha stick me  
Empty bottles still in hand still dead  
Still me  
Im the suit and tie that breaks the street  
And still wants more  
Im the 45 thats in your mouth  
Im a dirty dirty whore  
Yeah  
Look its me  
The one who cant be free  
Much too young to focus  
But too old to see  
Hey  
Look its me  
When no one wants to see  
See what you brought this world  
Just what you want to see  
Hey ma

He wants to become father now  
Me again me  
The marks inside your arms still leaves me alone to me  
Im the nothing face that plants a bomb  
And strolls away  
Im the one who doesnt look quite right  
As children play  
Yeah  
Look its me  
The one who cant be free  
Much too young to focus  
But too old to see

See what you brought this world  
Just what you want to see
