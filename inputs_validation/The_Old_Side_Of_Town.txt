Aint it strange how people change and almost overnight  
Who once was a country girl is now a a socialite  
Were proud for you but when youre through  
And seek some common ground  
Oh we miss you on the old side of town  
We still drink cokes and tell old jokes and bowl at Splits and Strikes  
Country music still plays on the jukebox every night  
Society is not for me but I can still be found  
Oh we miss you on the old side of town  
RSVP is not for me and black ties not my style  
I thought youd like to know cause you aint been here for awhile  
We read about your tour de force were glad you get around  
But we miss you on the old side of town  
We still drink cokes and tell old jokes and we bowl at Splits and Strikes  
George Jones is still a hero on the jukebox every night  
Society is not for me but I can still be found  
Oh we miss you on the old side of town  
Babe we miss you on the old side of town
