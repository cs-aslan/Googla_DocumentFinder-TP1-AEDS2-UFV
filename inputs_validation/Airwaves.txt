Are you ready Say youll let me  
Take you for a ride  
The night is young its just begun  
Why dont you step inside  
Get ready get ready  
Well leave this place behind  
Youll feel the airwaves answer  
Every question in your mind  
  
With every moment passing by  
Whos got the time to wonder why  
Its taken eternity  
  
Chorus  
Airwavescome and ride the airwaves  
Airwavestell me how you feel  
Airwavescome and ride the airwaves  
Its alright its alright  
Youll remember  
  
Oh yeah  
There is a place where time and space  
Will open every door  
Revealing things beyond the dreams  
Weve ever known before  
  
With every moment passing by  
Whos got the time to wonder why  
Its taking eternity  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh its alright  
Airwaves  
Airwaves  
Airwaves
