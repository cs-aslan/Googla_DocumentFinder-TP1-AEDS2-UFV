Black cat crossed our path on little fog feet  
Theres crows flying beside my window  
We left superstition on the roadside a few cities ago  
They spent our souls maybe but they didnt take our smiles  
  
We listen we shake the radio  
  
Theres a sweet corn princess smiling through the words on the glass  
Remember we stopped for tamales last time  
But now the lights from the town are fading with radio  
Theres another song playing and we can hear it in the wind outside  
  
We listen Pilgrims  
We shake to the radio  
We listen to the radio  
  
Little black kitty crossed our path wearing little fog feet  
And the crows theyre just drifters through my window  
The late night citys lights are growing sharper  
And I hear another song I see it pouring from the look in your eyes  
  
We listen  
We shake to the radio  
Pilgrims we listen we shake to the radio the radio
