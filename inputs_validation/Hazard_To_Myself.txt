Never win first place  
I dont support the team  
I cant take direction and my socks are never clean  
Teachers dated me  
My parents hated me  
I was always in a fight  
Cuz I cant do nothin right  
Every day I fight a war against a mirror  
I cant take the person staring back at me  
Im a hazard to myself  
Dont let me get me  
Im my own worst enemy  
Its bad when you dont know yourself  
So irratiting  
Dont want to be my friend no more  
I wanna be somebody else  
I wanna be somebody else  
Yeah  
L A Told me  
You could be a pop star  
All you have to change is everything you are  
Tired of being compared  
To damn Britney Spears  
Shes so pretty  
That just aint me  
So doctor doctor wont you please prescribe me somethin  
A day in the life of someone else  
Cuz Im a hazard to myself  
Dont let me  
Im my own worst enemy  
Its bad when you dont know yourself  
So irratiting  
Dont want to be my friend no more  
I wanna be somebody else  
Yeah  
Dont let me get me dont let me  
Im my own worst enemy  
Its bad when you dont know yourself  
So irritating  
Dont wanna be my friend no more  
I wanna be somebody else  
So doctor doctor wont you please prescribe me somethin  
A day in the life of someone else  
Dont let me get  
  
Oh Im a hazard to myself  
Yeah  
Dont let me get me  
Im my own worst enemy  
Its bad when you dont know yourself  
Yourself  
So irritating  
Dont wanna be my friend no more  
I wanna be somebody else  
Dont let me get me  
Im my own worst enemy  
Its bad when you dont know yourself  
So irritating  
Dont wanna be my friend no more  
I wanna be somebody else  
Dont let me get me
