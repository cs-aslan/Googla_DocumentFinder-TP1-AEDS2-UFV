You say youre not worthy of me  
But how do you know when you cant see  
Your eyes where midnight catches fire  
I cant describe this dizzy desire  
  
Can you be so insecure  
That you dont know what this grin is for  
Do you think I always act this way  
Silly and silent and eager to stay  
When youre holding me tonight  
Holding me tonight  
  
You think its all a mistake  
That Im lost in a dream from which Ill wake up  
There youll be just another guy  
You could never be but I dare you to try  
When youre holding me  
Holding me tonight  
  
I walk into your room  
You blush when I see it in a mess  
So I undress and close my eyes  
A room with a view  
Is in the dark with you  
But that should come as no surprise  
  
Its not a matter of mind  
The choice of the heart is a different kind  
Its always been a mystery  
When you walk into the room It happens to me  
And when youre holding me  
Holding me tonight
