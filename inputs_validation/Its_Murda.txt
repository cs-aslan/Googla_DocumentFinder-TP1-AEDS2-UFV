Eminem  
  
ill shove a gun in your grill  
grease it and heat it  
smother it in hot mustard  
so when i feed it to you  
its easy to eat it  
you need to be immediately  
freezen  
while you breathen  
and youll be leavin  
in the recieven room  
in the seat of a jesus  
you hate on this  
well be waiting on eight corners  
swarming your hood with  
a thousand angry skateboarders  
ill hop in a jeep  
and slam down on the gas  
and charge you  
and bombarde you  
in the car that your mom bought you  
fucked around and get choked  
and found remote  
floatin around  
down face down  
in a boat  
ill pile five dudes  
and a tentor will pull up  
to a seven mile drive through  
in mcdonalds and pile drive you  
ive got the power  
to snap the driver  
out of his  
zeddy bower  
while he drives by it ninety miles an hour  
this place is my house  
i might as well erase my face with white out  
cause yall cant see me like maces eyebrows  
where you at  
climbed out of a nice house through the front window and heard this guy shout  
 Hey thats my couch  
pulled a nine out during a rhinebout while im rippin the shit with a clip  
and i spit 5 rounds and murder you hos worse than a convertable flippin
vertical nose  
first with the top off landing upside down  
Or get tied down with duct ape  
fuck rape id rather just hump a sluts legs with my nuts shaved
