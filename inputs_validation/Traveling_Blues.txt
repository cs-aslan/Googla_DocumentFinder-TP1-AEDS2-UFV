If you ever get the traveling blues  
And need a place to rest your shoes  
Theres someone here to welcome the new  
Id be so happy to know that youre alive  
  
If knowing this should make you feel low  
And youre feeling the need for someone to know  
I love to hear your welcome hello  
Id be so happy to know that youre alive  
  
Theres so many sights  
Those bright city lights  
Will help you try to find your way  
Its a big big world  
And youre a big big girl  
So hury up and dont be late  
  
But if you ever want to come on home  
Theres no need in you being alone  
All youve got to do is phone  
Id be so happy to know that youre alive  
  
Mmmm theres so many sights  
Those bright city lights  
Will help try to find your way  
Its a big big world  
And youre a big big girl  
So hurry up and dont be late  
  
But if you ever want to come on home  
Theres no need in you being alone  
All youve got to do is phone  
Id be so happy to know that youre alive  
  
Id be so happy to know that youre alive  
So happy to know that youre alive
