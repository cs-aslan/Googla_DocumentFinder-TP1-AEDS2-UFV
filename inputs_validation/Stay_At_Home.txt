Outside these four walls lies anarchy babe  
Unnatural acts and sights abound  
Glass glaring eyes staring young pairing maybe  
What does the world care if Im not around  
  
Cause I think Id rather stay at home  
With people I know  
I could watch the whole thing on TV  
And the neighbors never know  
  
The bright lights are like traps for the unwary  
You need a guard just to walk at night  
Fights flaring bombs scaring pants tearing maybe  
How can you say it will be alright  
  
And I think Id rather stay at home  
And my face not show  
I could watch the whole thing on TV  
And the neighbors never know theyd never know  
  
Cause I think Id rather stay at home  
Where cold winds dont blow  
I could watch the whole thing on TV  
And the neighbors never know theyd never know  
  
Outside these four shores lie countries of strangers  
They have water that you shouldnt drink  
Bad driving crime thriving lifes full of dangers  
Its not that Im frightened to walk on the brink  
  
But I think Id rather stay at home  
With people I know  
I could watch the whole thing on TV  
And the neighbors never know theyd never know  
  
Think Id rather stay at home  
Where the bad guys never go they never go  
Stay at home  
With people you know people you know  
  
Think Id rather stay at home  
Where the pimples never show they never show  
Stay at home  
Stay at home
