Manhattan  T A  
With a detour to the deep south side  
Where its very violent  
A bouquet of violets  
Lies trampled to the ground  
  
Manhattan  T A  
With a detour to the deep south side  
Where its very violent  
A bouquet of violets  
Lies trampled to the ground  
  
Falling calling trying to survive  
Doing a quickstep  
Keeping in stride  
Falling calling trying to survive  
Doing a quickstep  
Keeping in stride  
With the changing tide  
  
Manhattan  T A  
With a detour to the deep south side  
Where its hot and steamy  
Dont go around too dreamy  
Youll be trampled to the ground  
  
Falling calling  
  
Can I find a future here  
Everything is so unclear  
Give it up give it up give it up  
  
Can I ever find a life  
Under threat of fire and knife  
Give it up give it up give it up  
Changing tide  
  
Manhattan  T A  
With a detour to the deep south side  
Its a game we play  
And its very scary  
With all those maniacs running around yknow  
  
Manhattan  T A  
With a detour 18 years old  
Caught under the wheels  
Its a pretty bad deal  
But this is my hometown  
  
Falling calling trying to survive  
Doing a quickstep  
Keeping in stride  
Falling calling trying to survive  
Doing a quickstep  
Keeping in stride  
With the changing tide  
Changing tide  
Changing tide
