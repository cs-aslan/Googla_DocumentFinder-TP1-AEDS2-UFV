There are people that will investigate you  
Theyll insinuate intimidate and complicate you  
Dont ever wait or hesitate to state the fate that awaits those who  
Try to shake or take you  
Dont let them break you  
  
You can do anything you want to do  
Its not wrong what I sing its true  
You can do anything you want to do  
Do what you want to  
  
People that despise you will analyze then criticize you  
Theyll scandalize and tell lies until they realize  
You are someone they should have apologized to  
Dont let these people compromise you  
Be wise too

Its not wrong what I sing its true  
You can do anything you want to do  
Do what you want to  
  
Hey you youre not their puppet on a string  
You can do everything  
Its true if you really want to  
You can do anything you want  
  
Just like I do  
  
You can do anything you want to do  
Its not wrong when I sing its true  
You can do anything you want to do  
Do what you want  
  
Hey you

The king of Rockn Roll is dead

I said one for the money
