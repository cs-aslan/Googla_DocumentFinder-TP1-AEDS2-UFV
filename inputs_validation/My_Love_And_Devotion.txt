My love and devotion  
Will always be true  
Now and forever  
I live for you  
  
My love and devotion  
Are yours yours alone  
Kiss me beloved  
Say youre my own  
  
I kiss your lips  
Sweet and tender  
They open Heavens door  
Wont you surrender  
Forevermore  
  
My love will grow deeper  
As time passes by  
Deep as the ocean  
And as high as the sky  
My love my devotion  
Are yours till I die  
  
Deep as the ocean  
And as high as the sky  
My love my devotion  
Are yours  till  I  die
