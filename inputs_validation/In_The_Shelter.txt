In the shelter in the morning as  
The sun was brightly gleaming  
I heard her crying out  
What is it all about I just dont know  
But I cant go back home  
  
Lonely princess all the days out  
On your own are growing empty  
Nothin is goin well if you  
Could only tell them how you feel  
But theyre too real to understand  
  
Too many trite expressions ending in  
Forced rejection long ago  
Too many innocent faces in too many  
Farout places somethings wrong  
  
Let me tell you that somethings wrong  
Its been that way so long and its a shame  
  
On the street car to the city  
Where she knows that she may lose it all  
Riding for just a dime  
Takin her own sweet and knowing well  
That this could be her final fall  
Past the boutique to the alley  
Down the river people pass her by  
She sits on the big gray rocks  
Takes off her boots and socks  
Not knowing what she will do next  
Just starts to cry  
  
To many wild rejections ending in  
Angry questions from her dad  
To many TV dinners ah everyone  
Loves a winner but she was lost  
No ones knows the trials she had  
  
In the shelter in the morning as  
The sun was brightly gleaming  
I heard her crying out  
What is it all about I just  
Dont know but I cant go back home  
Hell I just dont know but  
I cant go back home
