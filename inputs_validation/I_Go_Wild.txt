You whipped me Im hurting  
Abused me for certain  
And slavery should not exist  
Is this what I get a poison kiss  
  
Without you Im dead meat  
Im a raggedy dog dying in the street  
Of a Godforsaken shanty town  
Where gangs of children are hunted down  
  
I go wild when youre in my face  
I go wild when I taste your taste  
I go wild and I go insane  
I get sick somebody stop this pain  
  
You left me Im brain dead  
Im feeling nothing strapped to my bed  
On life support tubes in my nose  
Tubes in my arms shot full of holes  
  
I go wild when youre in my face  
I go wild when I taste your taste  
I go wild act like a goat  
And I get sick lumps in my throat  
  
I go wild  
I go wild  
I go crazy I go insane  
I get sick somebody stop this pain  
  
And the doctors says youll be okay  
And if youd only stay away  
From femme fatales and dirty bitches  
And daylight drabs and night time witches  
And working girls and blue stockings  
And dance hall babes and body poppers  
And waitresses with broken noses  
Checkout girls striking poses  
And politicians garish wives  
With alcoholic cunts like knives  
  
I go wild  
I go wild  
I go wild  
I go wild  
  
I go wild when youre in my face  
I go wild in a state of grace  
I go wild when you treat me bad  
I go wild raving mad  
  
I go wild for you  
I go wild for you  
I go wild  
I go wild  
I go wild  
I go wild
