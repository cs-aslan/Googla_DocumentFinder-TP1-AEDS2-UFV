Verse  
Brand new Ferrari  
It got them frog legs  
44 Bulldog  
I promise my dog bite  
Im made up like crimilite  
I og on trees  
I know who they see I know when they see  
The rack hangs on me  
Every day different payroll every day  
Every day of the week with a different hoe every day I want a different hoe  
Getting paid that cash from zero I came from zero  
And my bands on full with blue Cnotes  
  
Salute all my niggas from Lakewood to the motherfuckin Pinkstokes  
Got paper kinko  
Boxes ups truckloads  
And fd still watchin Rolex the watches  
Money in the ceiling money in the couch  
Countin up more than I can
