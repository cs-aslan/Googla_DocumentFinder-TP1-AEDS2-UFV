When I saw you at the grocery store  
You were sharin a shopping cart with her  
And I couldnt turn and run away  
I didnt know what to say  
You introduced us for the first time  
And I had to look her in the eye  
But you could not imagine my surprise  
Cant you see  
Youre leaving me  
For an ugly girl  
Does she talk about politics  
And all that stuff that used to make me sick  
Does she smoke cigars and stay up late  
Oh shes so great  
Does she tell you what you want to hear  
And I bet that she could grow a beard  
I feel better thinking you were queer  
Its not fair  
I cant compare  
To an ugly girl  
To an ugly girl  
Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala  
Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala  
Hahaha the jokes on me  
I feel jealous and I feel mean  
Shes so nice that it makes up for her face  
Theres no way do you have to keep your eyes closed  
Do you have to keep the lights down low  
Oh I bet you wish you had a blind fold  
Cant you see youre leaving me  
For an ugly girl  
For an ugly girl  
Shes an ugly girl  
A real ugly girl  
Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala  
Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala  
Shes an ugly girl  
An ugly girl  
Shes an ugly girl
