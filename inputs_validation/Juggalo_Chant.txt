Death can occur at any time  
At any given moment on any day  
And when it does  
You personally will meet The Wraith  
Face to face  
  
Join us for The Wraiths exhibit of ShangriLa  
November 5th  
Its the arrival the mighty 6th jokers card  
Is it the end of the world  
Yes it is the end of the world  
And its also the beginning  
The beginning of a brand new saga  
Juggalo world  
For us to enjoy  
  
Repeat 25 times  
Well never die alone  
Juggalos will carry on  
Swing out hatchets if we must  
Each and everyone of us
