Ten pounds too much to the naked eye  
I dont take the bus because she drives  
Watermelon lipstick and way too much  
She got buttermilk smile and a thorny touch  
Street smart like a Courtney Love  
Cant get enough Hollywood stories of  
Anybody famous that can make her feel  
Like theyre all kinda friends in a way  
No best friend well one but shes crazy  
Grew up to end up a Professor of lazy  
The last of six kids that all left town  
Seems nobody ever wanted them around  
But shes cool like a soda can sittin on ice  
Always orders sushi only eats the rice  
Talks about J Lo like theyre best of friends  
I think she loves me but it all depends  
  
Hey baby I dont want to be your Superman  
I just want to be your man and Ill be super baby  
Youll be standin in the sun shine  
Ill be standin right here in the rain  
You save me and I will save the day  
  
I got a sweet gig rakin in the cash with karaoke  
I get the crowd goin when I sing the hokey pokey  
I shake it to the  
left and then I shake it to the right  
Whats not to love man Im on tonight  
I got the LA stylie with the New York trim  
Keep my pants so low  
Its like Im goin for a swim  
I got the Coppertone tan like in Mexico  
Well not now but when I go yea  
  
I know you dont see me like a movie star  
And it cant help much that I dont have no car  
But youre my favorite thing by far  
Thats gotta count for something
