I know a good dance when the mood is right  
You can do it by day you can do it by night  
It can be so fine and youll agree  
If you just do what comes naturally now  
  
Chorus  
Baby its the other side of love  
Baby its the other side of love  
Baby its the other side of love  
Baby baby  
  
Theres plenty of ways we can do that thing  
We can fool around til we get that swing  
Come on do what you want honey we dont mind  
If you just make sure that you stay in time now  
  
Chorus  
  
I know a good dance when the mood is right  
You can take is sow cause weve got all night  
It can be so fine and youll agree  
If you just do what come naturally now
