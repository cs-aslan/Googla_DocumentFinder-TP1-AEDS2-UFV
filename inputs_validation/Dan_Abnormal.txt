Meanie Leanie come on down  
Come and entertain the town  
Its friday night and were all bored  
Times been called there is no more  
Times been called its such a bore  
  
Dan Abnormal not normal at all  
Its not his fault we made him this way  
Hell imitate you try to ape you  
But its not his fault Dan watches TV  
  
The meanie Leanie stays up late  
Mopes around gets in a state  
He the killer in your arcade  
Killing gangstas ready made  
Cause that is where the futures made  
  
Tele port me  
  
Dan went to his local burger bar  
I want McNormal and chips  
Or Ill blow you to bits  
Give us it  
  
Its the miseries at half past three  
Watching video nasties  
He has dirty dreams while hes asleep  
Dans just like you and me  
Hes the Meanie Leanie  
  
Dan Abnormal not normal at all  
Its not his fault we made him this way  
Hell imitate you try to ape you  
But its not his fault Dan Abnormals me
