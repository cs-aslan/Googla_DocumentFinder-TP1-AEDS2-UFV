Youre still playing that timeworn melody  
Play it now for old times sake once more  
When you want me you wont be usin me  
Like youve done a thousand times before  
Cause I found out now  
You never change  
Aint no use in foolin myself  
You never change at all  
  
Youre still sayin  
That youre misunderstood  
Wont go fallin this time thats for sure  
All your methods wont do you any good  
Theyve all been tried a thousand times before  
  
Cause I found out now  
You never change  
Aint no use in foolin myself  
You never change at all  
  
It aint no use youll never change  
Stop your runnin around
