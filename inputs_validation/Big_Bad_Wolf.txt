I told you not to go into the woods  
I told you that he wasnt any good  
I told you not to go into the woods  
I told you that he wasnt any good  
  
Ill take the wrong path  
I think Ill go a little off track  
And now theres no way back  
You took all the apples that I had  
But I heart you and I wanna be your girl  
I heart you and I know youll rock my world  
  
Cause you rock rock rock rock rock  
You know that I want what you got  
You rock rock rock rock rock  
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up up up  
I told you not to go into the woods  
  
Big bad naughty rock star  
Your claws are shining bright in the dark  
Lifting up my little red skirt  
I know youll leave me here in the dirt  
But I heart you and I wanna be your girl  
I heart you so come back and rock my world  
  
Cause you rock rock rock rock rock  
You know that I want what you got  
You rock rock rock rock rock  
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up up up  
I told you not to go into the woods  
  
Life is like like a little game  
That we like to play just for fun just for fun  
Yeah we take nothing seriously nothings wrong make me run all night long  
Hide and seek is how you play with me  
Oh youre tempting me just for fun just for fun  
I hear you calling me over city streets through the trees mess with me then
youll leave  
Oh be still my heart escaping in your cherry red car  
  
X2  
Cause you rock rock rock rock rock  
You know that I want what you got  
You rock rock rock rock rock  
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up up up
