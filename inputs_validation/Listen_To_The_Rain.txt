Rain  
Listen listen  
Listen listen  
Listen listen  
Listen listen  
Listen listen listen listen  
Listen listen listen listen  
Listen listen listen listen  
Listen listen listen listen  
Listen to each drop of rain listen listen  
Whispering secrets in rain listen listen  
Frantically searching for someone to hear  
Their story before they hit ground  
Please dont let go  
Cant we stay for a while  
Its just too hard to say goodbye  
Listen to the rain  
Listen listen listen listen listen listen to the rain  
Weeping  
Oooooooooooooooooooh  
Listen listen listen listen  
Listen listen listen listen  
I stand alone in the storm listen listen  
Suddenly sweet words take hold listen listen  
Hurry they say for you havent much time  
Open your eyes to the love around you  
You may feel youre alone  
But Im here still with you  
You can do what you dream  
Just remember to listen to the rain  
Oooooooooooooooooooh  
Listen
