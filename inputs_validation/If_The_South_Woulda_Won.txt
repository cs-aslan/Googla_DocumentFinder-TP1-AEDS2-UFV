If the South woulda won we woulda had it made  
Id probably run for President of the Southern States  
The day Elvis passed away would be our national holiday  
If the South woulda won we woulda had it made  
  
Id make my Supreme Court down in Texas  
And we wouldnt have no killers getting off free  
If they were proven guilty then they would swing quickly  
Instead of writin books and smilin on tv  
  
Wed all learn Cajan cookin in Louisiana  
And Id put that capital back in Alabama  
Wed put Florida on the right track cause wed take Miami back  
And throw all them pushers in the slammer  
  
Oh if the south woulda won we woulda had it made  
Id probably run for President of the Southern States  
The day young Skynyrd died wed show our southern pride  
If the south woulda won we woulda had it made  
Play a little dixieland boys ah yes  
  
Id have all the whiskey made in Tennessee  
And all the horses raised in those Kentucky hills  
The national treasury would be in Tupelo Mississippi  
And Id put Hank Williams picture on one hundred dollar bill  
  
Id have all the cars made in the Carolinas  
And Id ban all the ones made in China  
Id have every girl child sent to Georgia to learn to smile  
And talk with that southern accent that drives men wild  
  
Id have all the fiddles made in Virginia  
Cause they sure can make em sound so fine  
Im going up on Wolverton Mountain and see ole Clifton Clowers  
And have a sip of his good ole Arkansas wine  
  
Hey if the South woulda won wed a had it made  
Id probably run for President of the Southern States  
When Patsy Cline passed away that would be our national holiday  
If the South woulda won wed a had it made olay he hee hee  
I said if the South woulda won we would a had it made  
  
Might even be better off
