Shes quite a mediator  
A smoother operator you will never see  
Said see you later  
You know one day I disobeyed her openly  
  
She knows music  
I know music too you see  
Shes got the power  
The teen queen Rosalie  
  
Shes got the pleasure  
Comes from all the cornerstones of the world  
Shes so fantastic  
Shes everybodys favorite little record girl  
  
She knows music  
I know music too you see  
Shes got the power  
I got the power Rosalie  
  
Rosalie  
Rosalie  
Rosalie  
Rosalie  
  
Down on me Rosalie  
Shine on me will you please  
  
Well chattanooga lacooda baooga loosa  
You can hear her fine  
She makes the choices  
Then youd best be smiling when its losing time  
  
She knows music  
I know music too you see  
Shes got the power  
She is a tower Rosalie  
  
Rosalie  
Rosalie  
Rosalie
