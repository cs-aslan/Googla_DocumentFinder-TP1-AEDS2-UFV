In me you see a man aloneHeld by the habit of being on his ownA man who
listens to the trembling of the treesWith sentimental ease In me you see a
man aloneBehind the wall hes learned to call his homeA man who still goes
walking in the rainExpecting love again A man not lonelyExcept when the
dark comes onA man learning to live with memories of midnightsThat fell
apart at dawn In me you see a man aloneDrinking up Sundays and spending them
aloneAman who knows love is seldom what it seemsJust other peoples dreams
