Youve come a long way from the runnynosed and scruffy kid I knew  
You had such good ways  
I can remember the little things that always made you smile  
They made you happy  
Now you think youre wiser because youre older and you think  
That money buys everything  
And you think you need no one to guide you  
But youre still a long way from home  
Youve come a long way youre selfassured and dressed in  
Funny clothes but you dont know me  
I hope you find what you are looking for with your car and handmade overcoats  
But your wealth will never make you stronger cause youre still a  
Long way from home  
Yes youre still a long way from home
