Left New Hyde Park  
to hold my own in New York Town  
Groped in the dark  
Until I faced a place where scallywags are found  
Sharks and yoyos everywhere  
I think you can take it from there  
Now theres a horse in town  
I scream Honey its just a clown  
Yes theres a horse in town  
Saddle up and ride ride ride  
Can you reveal  
The day you came the day youll go  
This way I feel  
The time is moving much too slow  
And it passes by your chair  
If you laugh at my despair  
Chorus  
Solo  
The shoes of my friend  
They stamp the nail into the ground  
Lets not pretend  
We know weve all had fearsome style  
Following my frozen trail  
Moving to the inside rail  
Chorus
