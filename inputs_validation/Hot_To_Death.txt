Were gonna be breakin it down Yeah  
You gotta know the feel  
You gotta know the life  
You know what Im sayin Hey  
I said whats goin wrong  
You know it just aint right  
Tell me who be loud  
When the spark ignite  
Now from the break daylight  
To the fall of the sun  
You gotta pick your fight  
Its time to choose your gun  
Chorus  
Front to back  
Right to left  
Keep it live all night  
Make it hot to death  
Get your heart pumpin like some crystal meth  
Keep it live all night  
Make it hot to death  
Well  
Hey  
Tell me whos your God  
Does he make a lotta dough  
Im gonna take you higher  
Or to the fire below  
Chorus  
Guns to roses  
Abraham to Moses  
Daylight exposes what the night conceals  
Lets break these seals  
And get this thing started  
Some be out classed  
Some be out smarted  
Some be over bound by the blindin rays  
I hear the whisper in the night  
Get trapped in the maze  
See back in the days  
When I was juvenile  
I dreamed of rockin on the mic  
In a brand new style  
Now Im shakin these bones  
Tryin to get these shoes  
Outbidded major crews  
Im paid crazy dues  
Now Im speakin on you  
They just slept on me  
And rumors start spreadin  
Just like a disease  
Ill have you down on your knees  
Below the spot ground zero  
Turn brown and burn down Rome just like Nero  
A hero aint nothing but a  
Dont make me say it again  
Legend  
Dont make me say it  
Chorus  
Thats what Im sayin 2x
