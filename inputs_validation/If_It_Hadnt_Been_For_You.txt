I would be through with love  
Have nothing to do with love  
If it hadnt been for you  
If it hadnt been for you  
  
Love hurt me from the start  
Id still have a broken heart  
If it hadnt been for you  
If it hadnt been for you  
  
You put your sweet lips on mine  
And i believed in love again  
The world took on a new shine  
And oh how sad it was then  
  
When love was so cruel to me  
How empty my life would be  
If it hadnt been for you  
And the little things you do  
My whole world would fall through  
If it hadnt been for you  
  
If it hadnt been for you ooh ooh  
My whole world would fall through  
If it hadnt been for you  
If it hadnt been for you  
If it hadnt been for you  
If it hadnt been for you  
If it hadnt been for you
