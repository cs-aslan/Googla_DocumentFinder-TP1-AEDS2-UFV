Verse  
I aint a gangsta thats just my image  
I aint a thug either nigga I just go along with it  
Fuck what the press tell you listen to me  
Im trying to tell you whats real I dont live my life dangerously  
Live how I live live by my rules  
You wouldnt survive just waking up in my shoes  
Yeah I dress like a thug and talk like a gangsta  
But that dont mean Im gonna clap at your crew  
Even if I strike rich Im stay with my crew  
Ima stay with my peeps Ima stay in the streets  
Ima keep spittin flames so my family could eat  
And now Im not saying this to build my fan base  
And I dont give a fuck how many lives my hand takes  
And Ima stay true to myself Im a man  
Im a real nigga hard to kill nigga  
Hard as a rock Im just Cris from the block  
Ya Im that same troublemaking kid from the block whut  
Verse 2  
I went from boy to man aint nobody gonn stop me  
Holla Back nigga showing more hatred than the notzis  
I went from boy to man from toys to guns  
Went from boy to man from bottled milk to rum  
I went from boy to man from the carriage to whips  
Now all the bitches wanna get married to Cris  
And theres Haze selling crack overseas  
P Diddy himself cant get rights to come and sample me  
You know I smoke to the sky and cook buckets of crack  
You that bitch ass that emptied out his budget for rap  
Biggs be the nigga that be running with gats  
Holla Back nigga who else is fucking with that
