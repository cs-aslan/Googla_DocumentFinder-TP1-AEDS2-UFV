You cant by stand all the people  
Stand them on their own  
They will fall to pieces  
So we watch them grow  
Into strange and pretty faces  
I dont know  
Clutching to my lipstick traces  
Watch them go  
  
Make mistake number three Repeat x3  
  
Its strange how much it changes  
How they want to know  
How cynical are people  
Thats where children go  
  
Dragged into a conversation  
They cant hold  
Its so bad  
But it prepares them for the mold  
  
Make mistake number three  
repeat three times  
  
Why is my love like an ocean run dry  
Why is my love  
Such a struggle with life  
  
You cant by stand all the people  
Stand them on their own  
They will fall to pieces  
So we watch them grow  
  
Make mistake number three Repeat x3  
  
Make mistake number three
