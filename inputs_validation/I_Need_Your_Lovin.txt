Da da da da da da ho  
Da da da da da da da ho ho  
  
You say you gonna leave me for the arms of another  
You say my love for you is no good and we cant go any further  
But have pity on me  
I was blind but know I see  
Stay with me and never walk out of my life  
  
Because  
Oh I need your lovin I need your lovin  
Oh oh I need your lovin I need your lovin baby  
  
in spite of all the wrong Ive done Ill make it up to ya  
Even if it takes all my life Ill prove my love to ya  
So please dont go away  
With me always stay cause I love you  
And I couldnt stand it being away girl  
  
Oh I need your lovin I need your lovin  
Oh oh I need your lovin I need your lovin baby  
  
Girl restore the faith you had in me  
Im beggin you down on my knees  
Please dont take your love from me  
Dont leave me dont leave  
  
Forgive this fool for causing your heart to suffer  
Remember two wrongs dont make a right itll only make things tougher  
So have little sympathy on a poor fool like me  
And stay with me please dont walk out of my life  
  
Because  
Oh I need your lovin I need your lovin  
Oh oh I need your lovin I need your lovin baby  
  
Oh baby baby baby I need your lovin  
Oh woo I need your lovin I need your lovin baby  
Oh oh oh I need your lovin  
I need your lovin baby baby baby I need your lovin baby  
Oh woo I need your lovin I need your lovin  
I need it I need it
