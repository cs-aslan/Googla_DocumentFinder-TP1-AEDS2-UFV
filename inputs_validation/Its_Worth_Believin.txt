Theres a warm wind tonight  
And the moon turns the tide  
When the stars take their ride  
Shell be leavin  
Where she goes I dont know  
She wont tell me what it is  
Makes her act like this  
But Ive got a funny feelin that its me  
Its worth believin  
Should I ask  
Do you like to go walking on the shore  
And listen to the sea  
Or could it be someone kind  
Could it be that Im the fool  
Theres somethin wrong with you  
Ive got a funny feelin that its me  
Its worth believin  
Theres a breeze from the shore  
And the waves overlap  
When Ive called in the cat  
Shell go walkin  
And she cries to herself  
In the night when Im asleep  
She lies awake and weeps  
Could it be something new  
Some one old who has returned  
Or is it just a game  
But Ive got a funny feelin that its me  
Its worth believin  
Theres a warm wind tonight  
And the moon turns the tide  
When the stars take their ride  
Shell be leavin  
Where she goes I dont know  
She wont tell me what it is  
That makes her act like this  
Should I ask  
Do you like to go walking on the shore  
And listen to the sea  
Or could it be someone kind  
Could it be that Im the fool  
Theres somethin wrong with you  
Ive got a funny feelin that its me  
Its worth believin
