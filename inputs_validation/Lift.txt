This is the place  
Sit down youre safe now  
Youve been stuck in a lift  
Weve been trying to reach you Thom  
  
This is the place  
It wont hurt it will not hurt  
  
A smell of recognition  
A face you barely loved  
Empty all your pockets  
Cause its time to go home  
  
This is the place  
Remembering all the things you always see  
  
Youve been stuck in a lift  
In the belly of a whale  
At the bottom of the ocean  
  
A smell of recognition  
A face you barely loved  
Empty all your pockets  
Cause its time to go home  
  
Today is the first day of the rest of your days  
So lighten up squirt
