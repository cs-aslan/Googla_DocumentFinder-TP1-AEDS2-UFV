Billy was a small town loner  
Who never did dream  
Of ever leaving southern Arizona  
Or ever hearing wedding bells ring  
He never had a lot of luck with the ladies  
But he sure had a lot of good working skills  
Never cared about climbing any ladder  
He knew the way in a small cafe found the will  
  
He met Miss Bonnie  
And a little bit of her was a little too much  
A few movies and a few months latter  
The feeling got strong enough  
They didnt own a car  
So it must have been love  
That drove him uptown for a diamond  
Thats when he started goin  
  
Over the line  
Working overtime  
To give her things just to hear her say she dont deserve them  
But he loves her and he just kept going overboard  
Over the limit to afford to give her things he knew she wanted  
Cause without her where would he be  
See its not for him  
She is his only need  
  
Ring on her finger and one on the ladder  
A new promotion every now and then  
Bonnie worked until she couldnt tie her apron  
Then stayed at home and had the first of two children  
And my how the time did fly  
The babies grew up and moved away  
Left em sitting on the front porch rocking  
And Billy watching Bonnies hair turn gray  
  
And every once in a while you could see him get up  
And hes head downtown  
Cause he heard about something she wanted  
And it just had to be found  
Didnt matter how simple or how much  
It was love  
And boy aint that love just something  
When its strong enough to keep a man goin  
  
Over the line  
Working overtime  
To give her things just to hear her say she dont deserve them  
But he loves her and he just kept going overboard  
Over the limit to afford to give her things he knew she wanted  
Cause without her where would he be  
See its not for him  
She is his only need  
  
Over the line  
Working overtime  
She is his only need  
His only need  
Overboard  
Over the limit  
Just for her  
She
