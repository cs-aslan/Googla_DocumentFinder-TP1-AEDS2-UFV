Hold back the night  
I wonder what shes doing when shes not in sight  
I wonder where shes going who she holds tonight  
I wonder if shes sleeping alone  
  
And hold back the pain  
I cover up the teardrops in the pouring rain  
My heart has been run over by a runaway train  
I wonder if shes ever alone  
Let it go Let it go Let it go  
  
Her love spins like a merrygoround  
Going up and down shes far away bound  
Her love  expression of vision and sound  
Its setting me up and then its kicking me down  
  
Dont fade to gray  
I wonder if shes ever coming back to stay  
Shes running on the edge she hit the harder way  
I wonder if shes only a dream  
  
So hold back the night  
I wonder what shes doing when shes not in sight  
I wonder where shes going who she holds tonight  
I wonder if shes lost in a dream  
Let it go Let it go Let it go  
  
Her love spins
