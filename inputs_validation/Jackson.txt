 duet with Mike Post   
Well we got married in a fever a hotter than a pepper sprout  
Weve been talkin bout Jackson ever since the fire went out  
Im goin to Jackson Im gonna mess around  
Yeah Im goin to Jackson look out Jackson town  
Well go on down to Jackson go ahead and wreck your health  
Go play your hand you big talkin man make a big fool of yourself  
Yeah go to Jackson and go comb black hair please  
Im gonna snowball Jackson ha see if I care  
When I breeze into that city people gonna stoop and bow  
All them women gonna make me teach em what they dont know now  
Im goin to Jackson you turn loose my coat  
Yeah Im goin to Jackson goodbye thats all she wrote  
When they laugh at you in Jackson and Ill be dancin on the pony keg  
Hey Ill lead you round town like a scalded hound  
With your tail tucked between your legs  
Yeah go to Jackson you big talkin man  
Cause Ill be waitin in Jackson behind the Japan fan  
Well we got married in a fever a hotter than a pepper sprout  
Weve been talkin bout Jackson ever since the fire went out  
Were goin to Jackson and thats a natural fact  
Yeah were goin to Jackson aint never coming back  
Aint never coming back aint never coming back
