If Im lucky you will tell me that you care  
That well never be apart  
If Im lucky this will be no light affair  
Its forever from the start  
  
If Im lucky therell be moonbeams all around  
Shining bright as day  
You will hold my hand and youll understand  
All I cannot seem to say  
  
If I am lucky there will be a time an place  
You will kiss me well embrace  
In that moment every wishful dream I ever knew  
Will come true  
  
If Im lucky I will go through the years with you  
If I am lucky there will be a time an place  
You will kiss me well embrace  
In that moment every wishful dream I ever knew  
Will come true  
  
If Im lucky I will go through the years with you
