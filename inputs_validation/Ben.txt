Ben the two of us need look no more  
We both found what we were looking for  
With a friend to call my own  
Ill never be alone  
And you my friend will see  
Youve got a friend in me  
Youve got a friend in me  
  
Ben youre always running here and there  
Here and there  
You feel youre not wanted anywhere  
Anywhere  
If you ever look behind  
And dont like what you find  
Theres something you should know  
Youve got a place to go  
Youve got a place to go  
  
I used to say I and me  
Now its us now its we  
I used to say I and me  
Now its us now its we  
  
Ben most people would turn you away  
I dont listen to a word they say  
They dont see you as I do  
I wish they would try to  
Im sure theyd think again  
If they had a friend like Ben  
A friend  
Like Ben  
Like Ben  
Like Ben
