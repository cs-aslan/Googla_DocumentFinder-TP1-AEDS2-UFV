When we walk  
Down the street  
We dont care  
Who we see  
Or who we meet  
  
Dont have to run  
Dont have to hide  
Cause we got something burning inside  
  
We got love power  
Its the greatest power of them all  
We got love power  
And together we cant fall  
  
Sometimes were up  
Sometimes were down  
But our feet are always on the ground  
We always laugh  
Dont have to cry  
And this is the reason why  
  
We got love power  
Its the greatest power of them all hey hey hey  
We got love power  
And together we cant fall hey  
  
Sometimes were up  
Sometimes were down  
But our feet are always on the ground  
We always laugh  
Dont have to cry  
And this is the reason why  
  
We got love power  
Its the greatest power in the world  
We got love power  
And together we cant fall  
  
We got love hey love power  
Its the greatest feeling of them all hey hey hey  
We got love oh power  
And together
