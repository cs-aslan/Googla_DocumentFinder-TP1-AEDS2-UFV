Original by Robyn Hitchcock  
  
I used to ring you and put down the phone  
Once wore a hole in your dress  
Even tried Voodoo outside your home  
But these days I couldnt care less  
  
She doesnt exist any more  
She doesnt exist any more  
I let her go like the fool that I was  
Thought Id get over her soon  
I smell her perfume when my eyes are closed  
And I see her face in the moon  
She doesnt exist any more  
She doesnt exist any more  
I tell myself it would be different now  
I wouldnt treat her that way  
I wouldnt be me if she wasnt her  
And its far too late anyway  
Cause she doesnt exist any more  
She doesnt exist any more  
Only inside you the ghost of the love  
That is wordless and painful and old  
Theres no one else in the whole outside world  
That matches to her in your soul  
But she doesnt exist any more  
She doesnt exist any more
