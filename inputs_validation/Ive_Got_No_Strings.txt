Why does the gay little dicky bird sing  
What put the zing in a butterflys wing  
Whats the reason for the smile of a troubadour  
Why does a breeze have a barrel of fun  
Even the bee whos a sonofagun  
Its all because theyre free  
And stringless the same as me  
  
Ive got no strings to hold me down  
To make me fret  
Or make me frown  
  
I had strings but now Im free  
There are no strings on me  
  
Hio the merrio  
Im as happy as can be  
I want the world to know  
Nothing ever worries me  
  
Ive got no strings so I have fun  
Im not tied up to anyone  
How I love my liberty  
There are no strings on me  
  
Ive got no strings so I have fun  
Im not tied up to anyone  
How I love my liberty  
There are no strings on me
