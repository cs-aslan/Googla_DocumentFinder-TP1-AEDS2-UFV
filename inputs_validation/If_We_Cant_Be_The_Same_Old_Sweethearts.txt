Well just be the same old friends  
If we cant be the same old sweethearts  
Then well just be the same old friends  
For I want someone like you just to tell my troubles to  
My happiness on you it all depends  
  
For Ive known you too long to forget you  
And my old dream of love never ends  
Though I know you cant be mine  
We will meet from time to time  
And well just be the same old friends  
  
For Ive known you too long to forget you  
And my old dream of love never ends  
Though I know you cant be mine  
We will meet from time to time  
And well just be the same old friends
