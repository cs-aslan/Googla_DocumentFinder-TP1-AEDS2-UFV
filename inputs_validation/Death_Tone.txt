Original Lyrics  
  
Ridin on two wheels  
Chains hooked on my heels  
Sittin on leather  
Ridin on steel  
  
Put my shades on  
Hair blows in the wind  
I give some square the finger  
Now he wont look again no he wont  
  
Now you were sittin home  
And I got sent to Nam  
I went to the big house  
You just worked at job  
  
Hear me calling cant you hear my death tone  
Hear me calling cant you hear my death tone  
Hear me ride on into the night pull along side  
If youre looking for a fight  
  
My social workers got me on a chain  
Keeps me out of jail so the paper prints his name  
Yes it does and he likes it  
  
Unemployment checks run out next week  
It wont be very long til Im back on the streets again
