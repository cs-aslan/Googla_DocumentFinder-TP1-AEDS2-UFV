They say just once in life  
You find someone thats right  
But the world looks so confused  
I cant tell false from true  
And loves so hard to find  
In this state of mind  
Oh I hope Ill know him  
I hope Ill know him  
If hes ever near  
Well it seemed the time had come  
I thought you were the one  
When I looked into your eyes  
It never looked like lies  
And loves so hard to see  
When its in front of me  
Oh I hope Ill know it  
I hope Ill know it  
If its ever near  
And loves so hard to see  
When its in front of me  
Oh I hope Ill know it  
I hope Ill know it  
If its ever near  
Well I know that in my time  
Ill have it sweet and fine  
But it wont add up to much  
Unless I feel his touch  
And loves so hard to find  
So I guess Ill just give up trying  
Oh I hope Ill know him  
I hope Ill know him  
If hes ever near
