Girl I dont think of you  
At least thats what I try to do oh  
And I just miss those days  
Our secret little place oh well oh  
But Ill be there anytime your heart  
Is desperate just to love someone  
I want you to call me now  
Cause it feels so good to be your lover  
Feels so good to be your lover  
When my lips are kissing you all over  
Lips are kissing you all over  
And no matter what I do  
I cant get you off my mind  
I just want this night to last forever  
It cannot get any better in my life  
Now I dont feel the pain  
My world went upside down insane oh  
And I dont miss those nights  
Now maybe thats a lie as well oh  
Still Ill be there anytime your heart  
Is desperate just to love someone  
I want you to call me now  
Cause it feels so good to be your lover  
Feels so good to be your lover  
When my lips are kissing you all over  
Lips are kissing you all over  
And no matter what I do  
I cant get you off my mind  
I just want this night to last forever  
It cannot get any better in my life  
Its where I belong in my life  
In my life  
And Ill be there anytime your heart  
Is desperate just to love someone  
I want you to call me now  
Cause it feels so good to be your lover  
Feels so good to be your lover  
When my lips are kissing you all over  
Lips are kissing you all over  
And no matter what I do  
I cant get you off my mind  
I just want this night to last forever  
It cannot get any better in my life in my life  
I just want this night to last forever  
It cannot get any better in my life  
Theres nothing left to do  
But to say those words to you  
Oh yes I do
