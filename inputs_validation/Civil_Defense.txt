This is not a test of the Emergency Broadcast System  
This is the Real Thing  
And if you tape my voice which you should never ever do  
Youll kiss your ass goodbye Im talking to you  
  
Got plans for helterskelter  
Kids Mom and Dad in the shelter  
Cowering with flag held high  
American will never die  
Make plans to rise once more  
And be ready for World War Four  
Who need civil defense  
Who needs civil defense  
  
Civil defense Civil defense  
Civil defense dont even try  
Civil defense Civil defense  
Civil defense were all gonna die  
  
Wont matter who is first  
Well be blown off the earth  
Dont try to survive the burst  
Rotting death is even worse  
Why try to survive that day  
No one else will anyway  
Who needs civil defense  
Who needs civil defense  
  
Civil defense Civil defense  
Civil defense dont even try  
Civil defense Civil defense  
Civil defense were all gonna die  
  
Fuck You
