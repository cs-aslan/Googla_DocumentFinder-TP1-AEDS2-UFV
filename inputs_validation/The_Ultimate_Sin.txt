Overkill enough is enough  
Theres nothing left of me to  
Devour  
Youve had your fill Im all I  
Have left  
What can stop your hunger  
For power  
Cos you took advantage of  
Things that I said  
Now the feeling is dead  
  
And thats the ultimate sin  
And thats the ultimate sin  
  
Anyway I look at it now  
The doors are closed and  
Cannot be opened  
Bury your anger and bury  
Your dead  
Or youll be left with nothing  
And no one  
Or youll be left with nothing  
And no one  
Theres no point in screaming  
Cos you wont be heard  
Now that tables have turned  
  
It was the ultimate sin  
It was the ultimate sin  
It was the ultimate sin  
  
I warned you then and Im  
Warning you now  
If you mess with me youre  
Playing with fire  
Winds of change that are  
Fanning the flames  
Will carry you to your  
Funeral pyre  
Its pulling you down  
Its your final descent  
Its too late to repent  
  
When its the ultimate sin  
When its the ultimate sin  
When its the ultimate sin  
When its the ultimate sin
