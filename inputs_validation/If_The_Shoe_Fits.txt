My friends all say that youre deceiving me  
And things are going on that I dont see  
I pay them no mind I love you so  
And if youre guilty then I just dont want to know  
  
But if the shoe fits then wear it  
If your mind hurts then bear it  
Its your conscience to live with every day every night  
If you find it hard sleeping  
If you just lie there weeping  
If the truth hurts then the shoe fits just right  
  
If you do wrong then its your bill to pay  
Its you there in that mirror every day  
I love you and I plan to from now on  
I just cant believe you do your daddy wrong  
  
But if the shoe fits then wear it  
If your mind hurts then bear it  
Its your conscience to live with every day every night  
If you find it hard sleeping  
If you just lie there weeping  
If the truth hurts then the shoe fits just right  
  
If the truth hurts then the shoe fits just right
