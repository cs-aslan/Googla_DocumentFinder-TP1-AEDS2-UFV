Body to body body to body  
Heart to heart  
Body to body body to body  
Heart to heart  
  
Looking in your eyes tonight  
I can see everything I need  
Holding your heart close to mine  
Feeling you breathing you  
We melt together two become as one  
Night is burning hotter than the sun  
When Im with you  
When Im with you  
  
I could drown in your eyes  
Die in your arms  
Live for these moments here in the dark  
I dont know where I end  
Not sure where you start  
When were body to body heart to heart  
Body to body heart to heart  
Body to body body to body  
Heart to heart  
  
Breathing every breath with you  
Next to you is where I need to be  
Part of every part of you  
Feeling you feeling me  
We melt together in a tender kiss  
No night has ever been a night like this  
When Im with you  
When Im with you  
  
I could drown in your eyes  
Die in your arms  
Live for these moments here in the dark  
I dont know where I end  
Not sure where you start  
When were body to body heart to heart  
Body to body heart to heart  
Body to body body to body  
Heart to heart
