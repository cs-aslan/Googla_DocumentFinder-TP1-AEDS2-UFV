You can see it in a clear blue sky  
You can see it in a womans eyes  
You can hear it in your babys cries  
You can hear it in your lovers sighs  
You can touch it in a grain of sand  
Yeah hold it right there  
In the palm of your hand  
Feel it round you everyday  
And hear what Ive got to say  
  
God gave me everything I want  
Come on  
Ill give it all to you  
God gave me everything I want  
Come on  
Ill give it all to you  
  
saw it in the midnight sun  
And I feel it in the race I won  
And I hear it in the windy storm  
And I feel it in the icy dawn  
And I smell it the wine I taste  
And I see it in my fathers face  
And I hear it in a symphony  
And I feel it in the love  
You show for me  
  
Yeah  
God gave me everything I want  
Oh come on  
Ill give it all to you  
God gave me everything I want  
  
Come on  
Ill give it all to you  
God gave me everything I want  
I cant stop cant stop  
Im still looking now  
God gave me everything I want  
Oh come on  
Ill give it all to you  
  
Crazy you said  
Its all in your head  
  
Chorus
