Its what you all been waiting for aint it  
What people pay paper for damn it they cant stand it  
They want something new so lets get reacquainted  
Became the hood favorite I cant even explain it I surprise myself too  
Life of a Don lights keep glowing  
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on  
With something crazy on my arm  
Uhuhhum and heres another hit Barry Bonds

Dude Fresh off the plane konichiwa bitches  
Turn around another plane my passport on pivot  
Ask for it I did it that asshole done did it  
Talked it then he lived it spit it then he shit it  
I dont need writers I might bounce ideas  
But only I could come up with some shit like this  
I done played the underdog my whole career  
Ive been a very good sport havent I this year  
They say he going crazy and we seen this before  
But Im doing pretty good as far as geniuses go  
And Im doing pretty hood in my pink polo  
Nigga please how you gonna say I aint no Lohead  
Cause my Dior got me more model head  
Im insulted you should go head  
And bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead  
And the flow just hit code red  
Top 5 MCs you aint gotta remind me  
Top 5 MCs you gotta rewind me  
Im high up on the line you could get behind me  
But my heads so big you cant sit behind me  
  
Life of a Don lights keep glowing  
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on  
With something crazy on my arm
