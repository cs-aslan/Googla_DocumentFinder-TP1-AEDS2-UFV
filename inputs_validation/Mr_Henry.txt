previously unreleased  
  
Mr Henry stumbles home  
When the evenings done  
Hes as poor as a church mouse  
High on the Meyers rum  
Tugging at his shirttail  
Jiggling a church key  
Chewing on a toothpick  
On another binge  
Trampling the rosebush  
Whistin to himself  
Now dont wake up the neighbours  
Spitting on the hinge  
Rattling the milkbottles  
Tripping on a skate  
Hidin from the Newsboys  
Before its too late  
The Screen doors open  
Dont make no noise in the Kitchen  
Got no excuse  
For a cold grey wife that starts bitchin  
That the no good bums at it again  
After shes given him  
The best years of her life  
Hell tell her he was celebrating  
Savages divorce  
Played a hunch out at Yonkers  
You can never trust a horse  
And thrown in jail  
Swore hed never do these things again  
Hes got an alibi  
But never tells her where hes been  
Henry Henry
