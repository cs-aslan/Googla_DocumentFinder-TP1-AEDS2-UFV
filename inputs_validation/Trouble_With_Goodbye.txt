It aint working  
Dont take no genius to see  
Its hurting more every day  
Goin through the motions  
Aint we  
And its too sad for me  
Once we were  
True lovers  
Feeling the heat  
  
Oh but I  
Cant say the word we have to say  
Dont ask me why  
Lets just say  
  
Chorus  
See ya round gotta go  
Sayonara adios  
Arrivederci  
Au revoir auf Wiedersehen  
Ciao bella never change  
Oh mercy mercy  
Dont make me cry  
I got trouble with goodbye  
  
Dont explain it away  
Cause it just aint my thing  
All this articulating  
Just a little heartbreak  
Why make it more than it seems  
Id much rather  
Get back to dreamin my dreams  
  
See cause Ive been thinkin  
well meet again someday  
But until we do  
Lets just say  
  
Chorus  
  
Wish I could be so free  
Yeah they take it so casually  
Oh but baby thats just not me  
Oh no Ive never been  
And I will never be  
Cause Ive got I got trouble  
babe  
Oh no I dont really want to go  
Dont want to say the words  
Dont want to say goodbye  
  
Chorus
