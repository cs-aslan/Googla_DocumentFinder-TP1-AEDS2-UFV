Its quarter to three  
Theres no one in the place  
Except you and me  
So set em up Joe  
I got a little story  
I think you should know  
Were drinking my friend  
To the end  
Of a brief episode  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road  
I got the routine  
Put another nickel  
In the machine  
Feelin so bad  
Wont you make the music  
Easy and sad  
I could tell you a lot  
But its not  
In a gentlemans code  
Just make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road  
Youd never know it  
But buddy Im a kind of poet  
And Ive got a lot of things  
Id like to say  
And when Im gloomy  
Wont you listen to me  
Till its talked away  
Well thats how it goes  
And Joe I know your gettin  
Anxious to close  
And thanks for the cheer  
I hope you didnt mind  
My bending your ear  
But this torch that I found  
Its gotta be drowned  
Or its soon might explode  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road  
The long its so long  
The long and winding road
