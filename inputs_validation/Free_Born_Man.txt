I was born in the Southland Twenty some odd years ago  
Now I ran away for the first time when I was about four years old  
Im a free born man My home is on my back  
Lord I know every inch of highway and every foot of backroad never a mile
from a railroad track  
I got a gal in Cincinatti got a woman in San Antone  
But I always love that girl next door and any ole place is home  
Im a free born man My home is on my back  
Lord I know every inch of highway and every foot of backroad never a mile
from a railroad track  
Ive got me a worn out guitar I carry an ole tote sack  
Ive hocked it about twohundred times but I always get it back  
Im a free born man My home is on my back  
Now I know every inch of highway and every foot of backroad never a mile from
a railroad track  
You May not like my appearance You may not like my song  
You might not like the way I am but you sure like the way Im gone  
Im a free born man My home is on my back  
Lord I know every inch of highway and every foot of backroad never a mile
from a railroad track
