Is there something about you  
That I dont already know  
Something about me  
Thatll make you break my heart and go  
Been through it all  
More than a thousand times  
  
For the last time  
Come and wake me up  
Be a sign  
Be my ordinary  
More than any  
Legendary love  
  
Shes got to be the queen of angels above  
Shes got to be a true angel of love  
In the world  
Ooh yeah yeah yeah  
  
You say youre looking for someone  
From a cover of a magazine  
Romance and beauty  
But it isnt always what it seems  
Look into my eyes  
My tears wont lie  
  
For the last time  
Come and wake me up  
Be a sign  
Be my ordinary  
More than any  
Legendary love  
  
Shes got to be the queen of angels above  
Shes got to be a true angel of love  
In the world  
Ooh yeah yeah yeah  
Shes got to be the queen of angels above  
Shes got to be a true angel of love  
In the world  
Ooh yeah yeah yeah  
  
For the last time  
Come and wake me up  
Be a sign  
Be my legendary love  
  
Woooh  
Never thought Id see the day  
Never thought Id see the day love come your way  
Ooh yeah yeah  
Never thought Id see the day  
Never thought Id see the day love come your way  
  
Shes got to be  
Shes got to be  
Ooh yeah yeah  
Shes got to be  
Shes got to be  
  
Woooh woohh yeah  
Shes got to be the queen of angels above  
Legendary love  
Shes got to be a true angel of love  
In the world  
Never thought Id see the day  
Ooh yeah yeah yeah  
  
Woooh ohhho
