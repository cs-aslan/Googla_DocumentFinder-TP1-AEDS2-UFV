Girl try to remember when we didnt have no shoes  
We stuck together just me and you  
It took a long time to get what we got today  
Now you wanna give it all up for another guy  
  
Baby Im tellin you dont let the green grass fool you  
Dont let it change your mind  
  
Its gonna be hard for me baby  
Feel my life all over cause baby you got the love that I really need  
Cause if you leave leave me this way baby  
You know what I may not live to see a brand new day  
  
Oh baby dont let the green grass fool you  
Dont let it change your mind  
You know why it may be greener on the other side baby  
But right in my arms is where you belong ooh baby  
  
Dont let the green grass fool you  
Dont let it change your mind oh baby  
It may be greener on the other side baby  
But right in my arms is where you belong baby  
  
Dont let the green grass fool you  
Dont let it change your mind  
It may be greener on the other side baby  
In my arms is where you belong yeah
