Where has that old friend gone  
Lost in a February song  
Tell him it wont be long  
Till he opens his eyes opens his eyes  
Where is that simple day  
Before colors broke into shades  
And how did I ever fade  
Into this life into this life  
  
And I never want to let you down  
Forgive me if I slip away  
When all that Ive known is lost and found  
I promise you I Ill come back to you one day  
  
Morning is waking up  
And sometimes its more than just enough  
When all that you need to love  
Is in front of your eyes  
Its in front of your eyes  
  
And I never want to let you down  
Forgive me if I slip away  
Sometimes its hard to find the ground  
Cause I keep on falling as I try to get away  
From this crazy world  
  
And I never want to let you down  
Forgive me if I slip away  
When all that Ive known is lost and found  
I promise you I Ill come back to you one day  
  
Where has that old friend gone  
Lost in a February song  
Tell him it wont be long  
Till he opens his eyes  
Opens his eyes
