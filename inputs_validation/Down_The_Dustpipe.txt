Heading down the back turnpike signposts are pointing west  
Fell into the lonely dustpipe hope my pickup can stand the test  
But Im doing all right now  
Rolling down the dustpipe nananana nananananana  
  
Rolling down the dustpipe now got a ten dollar bill in my jeans  
Because there aint no room for a kosher cowboy in a town like New Orleans  
But Im doing all right now  
Rolling down the dustpipe nananana nananananana  
  
Guess I didnt make it in the city but thats just the way that it goes  
Cos theres a lotta lunatics crazy ghostmen baby dont like the shape of
my nose  
But Im doing all right now
