All I have  
And all I do  
Cannot compare  
To the love of you  
  
You make me feel alive  
You are my highest high  
All I can do is smile  
When I look in my little girls eyes  
  
When I look in my little girls eyes X4  
Youre my star  
And when Im far  
Youre not alone  
  
Cause your hearts my home  
You are my biggest prize  
So beautiful and so wise  
I can see the woman from within my child  
  
When I look in my little girls eyes  
When I look in my little girls eyes X4  
You make me feel alive  
And you are my highest high  
  
All I want to do when I come into the room is see her smile  
When I look in my little girls eyes  
When I look in my little girls eyes Repeat x 4
