The world today is such a wicked thing  
Fighting going on between the human race  
People give good wishes to all their friends  
While people just across the sea are counting the dead  
  
A politicians job they say is very high  
For he has to choose whos got to go and die  
They can put a man on the moon quite easy  
while people here on earth are dying of old diseases  
  
A woman goes to work every day after day  
She just goes to work just to earn her pay  
Child sitting crying by a life thats harder  
he doesnt even know who is his father
