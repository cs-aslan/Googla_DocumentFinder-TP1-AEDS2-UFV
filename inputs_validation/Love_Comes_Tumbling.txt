Love dont need to find a way  
You find your own way  
I forget that I cant stay  
And so I say that  
All roads lead to where you are  
All roads lead to where you are  
  
The seed is spilled the bed defiled  
For you a virgin bride  
Hide yourself in someone else  
Dont find yourself in me  
  
I cant lift you up again  
Love comes tumbling down again  
  
Love dont need to find a way  
You find your own way  
I forget that you can stay  
And so I say that  
All roads lead to where you are  
All roads lead to where you are
