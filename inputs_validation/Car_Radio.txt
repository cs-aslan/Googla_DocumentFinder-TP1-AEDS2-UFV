I ponder of something great  
My lungs will fill and then deflate  
They fill with fire exhale desire  
I know its dire my time today  
  
I have these thoughts so often I ought  
To replace that slot with what I once bought  
Cause somebody stole my car radio  
And now I just sit in silence  
  
Sometimes quiet is violent  
I find it hard to hide it  
My pride is no longer inside  
Its on my sleeve  
My skin will scream reminding me of  
Who I killed inside my dream  
I hate this car that Im driving  
Theres no hiding for me  
Im forced to deal with what I feel  
There is no distraction to mask what is real  
I could pull the steering wheel  
  
I have these thoughts so often I ought  
To replace that slot with what I once bought  
Cause somebody stole my car radio  
And now I just sit in silence  
  
I ponder of something terrifying  
Cause this time theres no sound to hide behind  
I find over the course of our human existence  
One thing consists of consistence  
And its that were all battling fear  
Oh dear I dont know if we know why were here  
Oh my too deep please stop thinking  
I liked it better when my car had sound  
  
There are things we can do  
But from the things that work there are only two  
And from the two that we choose to do  
Peace will win and fear will lose  
It is faith and theres sleep  
We need to pick one please because  
Faith is to be awake  
And to be awake is for us to think  
And for us to think is to be alive  
And I will try with every rhyme  
To come across like I am dying  
To let you know you need to try to think  
  
I have these thoughts so often I ought  
To replace that slot with what I once bought  
Cause somebody stole my car radio  
And now I just sit in silence  
  
And now I just sit in silence  
And now I just sit  
And now I just sit in silence  
And now I just sit in silence  
And now I just sit in silence  
And now I just sit  
  
I ponder of something great  
My lungs will fill and then deflate  
They fill with fire exhale desire  
I know its dire my time today  
  
I have these thoughts so often I ought  
To replace that slot with what I once bought  
Cause somebody stole my car radio  
And now I just sit in silence
