Well I remember back in my younger days of high school  
Back then baseball was my biggest dream  
So when I stood in line for my turn at bat  
I found that wasnt where they wanted me at  
I wound up rotten the water for all the teams  
  
Well there aint nobody gonna miss me when Im leavin  
There aint nobody ever loved me very long  
No matter how much I miss our show  
I get kicked around everywhere I go  
There aint nobody gonna miss me when Im gone  
  
So when my Uncle Sam called me to serve my country  
I stood up brave and smiled and packed my duds  
But to my surprise when I got there  
They gave me the boots and cut my hair  
I wound up scrubbin the floor and a peelin spuds  
  
No aint nobody gonna miss me when Im leavin  
There aint nobody ever loved me very long  
No matter how much I miss our show  
I get kicked everywhere I go  
There aint nobody gonna miss me when Im gone  
  
Well I met me a pretty little girl one day in Nashville  
I loved her more than all of my wildest dreams  
She took me for my money my house and my boat  
And didnt even leave me a goodbye note  
I gave it all up boy did she strip me clean  
  
Well there aint nobody gonna miss me when Im leavin  
There aint nobody ever loved me very long  
No matter how much I miss our show  
I get kicked around everywhere where I go  
There aint nobody gonna miss me when Im gone when Im gone  
  
There aint nobody gonna miss me when Im gone  
  
Sittin in the middle and I musta gone
