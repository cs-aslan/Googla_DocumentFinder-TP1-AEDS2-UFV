One day maybe we will dance again  
Under fiery skies  
One day maybe you will love again  
Love that never dies  
  
One day maybe you will see the land  
Touch skin with sand  
Youve been swimming in the lonely sea  
With no company  
  
Oh dont you want to find  
Cant you hear this beauty in life  
The roads the highs breaking up your life  
Cant you hear this beauty in life  
  
One day maybe you will cry again  
Just like a child  
Youve gotta tie yourself to the mast my friend  
And the storm will end  
  
Oh dont you want to find  
Cant you hear this beauty in life  
The times the highs breaking up your mind  
Cant you hear this beauty in life  
  
Oh youre too afraid to touch  
Too afraid youll like it too much  
The roads the times breaking up your mind  
Cant you hear this beauty in life  
  
One day maybe I will dance again  
One day maybe I will love again  
One day maybe we will dance again  
You know youve gotta  
Tie yourself to the mast my friend  
And the storm will end  
One day maybe you will love again  
Youve gotta tie yourself to the mast my friend  
And the storm will end
