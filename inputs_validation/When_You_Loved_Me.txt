Im back at the corner  
Where we said goodbye  
I turn and I see you  
But dont trust my eyes  
You look at me  
And I cant breathe  
  
Had every word perfect  
For when this day would come  
But standing here now  
I cant find even one  
All I want to say  
Is written on my face  
  
Chorus  
I close my eyes every time I wake up  
Cause every little thing makes me think of  
When you loved me  
When you loved me  
And I dont really want to talk about the weather  
The truth is that I was better  
When you loved me  
When you loved me  
  
Im sure that theres somewhere that youve got to go  
But give me one more minute  
One more memory to hold  
And wherever youre goin to  
Take this with you  
  
Chorus  
  
I try to wish you away  
Youre gone today but  
Youll be back tomorrow  
This lie  
That I call goodbye  
Wont let go  
Wont let me go  
  
Chorus  
  
Im back at the corner  
Where we said goodbye
