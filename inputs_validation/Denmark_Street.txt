Down the way from the Tottenham Court Road  
Just round the corner from old Soho  
Theres a place where the publishers go  
If you dont know which way to go  
Just open your ears and follow your nose  
cause the street is shakin from the tapping of toes  
You can hear that music play anytime on any day  
Every rhythm every way  
You got to a publisher and play him your song  
He says I hate your music and you hair is too long  
But Ill sign you up because Id hate to be wrong  
Youve got a tune its in your head you want to get it placed  
So you take it up to a music man just to see what he will say  
He says I hate the tune I hate the words but Ill tell you what Ill do  
Ill sign you up and take it round the street and see if it makes the grade  
And you might even hear it played on the rock n roll hit parade  
Daytime night time every week you can hear that heavy beat  
Now the walls are shaking from the tapping of feet  
Daytime night time every day you can hear that music play  
Every rhythm every way
