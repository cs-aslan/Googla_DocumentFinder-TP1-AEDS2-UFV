There were flashing lights when we met  
Not the typical place you would be  
In a flash of time my mind was set  
I knew you were the girl there for me  
  
And though you just wanted to leave  
Imagine how great it could be  
The FyouTyouareE spells the future girl  
Sit down hold your horses dont leave where you going girl  
  
Come and sit with me dont be so quick to leave please  
I really like you girl girl girl  
Lets trade thoughts and words explore the universe verse  
But just dont leave me girl girl girl  
I really like you girl girl girl girl  
From the moment the moment that we met we met  
I really like you girl girl oh girl girl  
And I know I know this is it this is it  
  
Against the wall is where ya lean  
The most beautiful girl that Ive seen  
Out of this world my God you bling  
Im surprised that you are a human being  
  
And though you just wanted to leave  
Imagine how great it could be  
The FyouTyouareE spells the future girl  
Sit down hold your horses dont leave where you going girl  
  
Come and sit with me dont be so quick to leave please
