My minds at erase  
And my thoughts are done  
Ive been meaning to tell you this  
Since my lies begun  
The way I feel inside  
Reflects of the souls in your eyes  
Ive been meaning to tell you this  
All of my life  
To think of who I am  
Shows much of what you were too  
Slowly I realize  
Ill be fine without you  
I gave you your chances  
And you just put them aside  
To find out too late  
Of who I am inside  
  
Show me yourself come show me who you are  
These are the times we wish it never went this far  
Hidden by your words oh god please let me see  
How someone plays with feelings oh so carelessly  
Give me your heart to come and be in one  
Vulnerable I was please come and steal and run  
Just as we laughed kissed I looked deep in your eyes  
To tell you how I felt came one without reply  
  
Echos is all I hear Im running Im running Im running  
Let go is all I fear Im running Im running Im running  
Let go  
I cant let go  
So fall away is what Ill do  
Its what Ill do  
Its what Ill do  
Its what Ill do  
Its what Ill do  
Its what Ill do
