I was fifteen when my daddy died  
Mama worked two jobs just to get by  
Seemed like a blessing when Harley came around  
So she took his name but I had my doubts  
Didnt take long for his drinking ways to start showing up on mamas face  
One violent night hiding under my bed  
I swore that he wouldnt see another sunset  
Next day I followed him down to the riverbank  
I knew one of us wouldnt walk away  
  
I might have had a plan but he didnt know it  
I might have been scared but I didnt show it  
Thats all between the river and me  
With the current and the rocks it could have been misty  
He might have been sober but I brought the whiskey  
Thats all between the river and me  
  
I walked up to him and I said his name  
Just so he could see the look on my face  
We stood eye to eye and toe to toe  
When I told him that he wasnt gonna come back home  
He raised his fist to me but I didnt flinch  
I said I aint your son you son of a bitch  
  
I might have had a knife in my back pocket  
I might have pulled it out before he saw it  
Thats all between the river and me  
I might have had a gun but I didnt fire it  
He might have tried to yell but I kept him quiet  
Thats all between the river and me  
Thats all between the river and me  
  
Sheriff came knocking on our front door  
They said they found his body by the reservoir  
Bottle in his shirt and liquor in his blood  
He must have fallen in the river and he never came up  
  
There might have been blood but they never saw it  
Just a little mud on the living room carpet  
Thats all between the river and me  
Well after what he done there aint no wonder  
I cant remember how long I held him under  
Thats all between the river and me  
Thats all between the river and me  
Thats all between the river and me  
Thats all  
Thats all
