Limb by limb and tooth by tooth  
Its tearing up inside of me  
Everyday every hour wish that I  
Was bullet proof  
  
Wax me  
Mould me  
Heat the pins and stab them in  
You have turned me into this  
Just wish that it  
Was bullet proof  
Was bullet proof  
  
So pay me money and take a shot  
Leadfill the hole in me  
I could burst a million bubbles  
All surrogate  
And bullet proof  
And bullet proof  
And bullet proof  
And bullet proof
