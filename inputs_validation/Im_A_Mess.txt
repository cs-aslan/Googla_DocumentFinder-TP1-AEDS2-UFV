Tempo sees Ed not feeling his best  
  
Ooh Im a mess right now  
Inside out  
Searching for a sweet surrender  
But this is not the end  
I cant work it out  
How going through the motions  
Going through us  
And oh Ive known it for the longest time  
And all my hope  
All my words are all over written on the signs  
But youre on my road walking me home  
Home home  
  
See the flames inside my eyes  
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love  
Easy baby maybe Im a liar  
But for tonight I wanna fall in love  
And put your faith in my stomach  
  
I messed up this time  
Late last night  
Drinking to suppress devotion  
With fingers intertwined  
I cant shake this feeling now  
Were going through the motions  
Hoping youd stop  
  
And oh Ive only caused you pain  
You know but all of my words will always below  
Of all the love you spoke  
When youre on my road walking me home  
Home home home  
  
See the flames inside my eyes  
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love  
Easy baby maybe Im a liar  
But for tonight I wanna fall in love  
Put your faith in my stomach  
  
And for how long I love my lover  
For how long I love my lover  
And now for how long long I love my lover  
Now now for how long long I love my lover  
Now now for how long long I love my lover  
I feel love  
For how long long I love my lover  
For how long long I love my lover  
Feel it all over now  
For how long long I love my lover  
Now now for how long long I love my lover  
Feel it all over now  
For how long I love my lover  
Now now  
For how long long I love my lover
