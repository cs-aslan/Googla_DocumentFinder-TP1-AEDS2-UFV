John Jacob Niles  
  
Go away from my window  
Go away from my door  
Go away from my bedside  
And bother me no more  
And bother me no more  
  
Ill go and tell my brothers  
Ill tell my sister too  
The reason why my heart is broke  
Is on account of you  
Is on account of you  
  
Ill give you back your letters  
Ill give you back your ring  
But Ill never forget my own true love  
As long as songbirds sing  
As long as songbirds sing  
  
Go away from my window  
Go away from my door  
Go away way way from my beside  
And bother me no more  
And bother me no more
