Hush little baby dont say a word  
Papas gonna buy you a mockingbird  
  
And if that mockingbird dont sing  
Papas gonna buy you a diamond ring  
  
And if that diamond ring turn brass  
Papas gonna buy you a looking glass  
  
And if that looking glass gets broke  
Papas gonna buy you a billy goat  
  
And if that billy goat dont pull  
Papas gonna buy you a cart and bull  
  
And if that cart and bull turn over  
Papas gonna buy you a dog named Rover  
  
And if that dog named Rover wont bark  
Papas gonna to buy you and horse and cart  
  
And if that horse and cart fall down  
Well youll still be the sweetest little baby in town
