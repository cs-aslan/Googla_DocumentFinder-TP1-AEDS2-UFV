Do you go to the temple tonight   
Oh no I dont think so  
Do you not go to the palace of answers with me marie  
Oh no I dont think so no  
See when they offer me book of gold  
I know soon still that platinum is coming  
And when I look inside of your temple  
It looks just like the inside of anyone one man  
And when he beckons his finger to me  
Well I move in another direction  
I move in another dimension  
I move in another dimension oh oh oh  
  
I spin I spiral and I splatter  
Hand of god I feel the finger  
Hand of god and I start to whirl  
And I whirl and I whirl  
Dont get dizzy do not fall now  
Turn god God strange  
Go go on go like a dervish  
Turn god strange make a move  
Turn lord strange  
I dont get nervous  
Oh I just move in another dimension  
Come move in another dimension  
Come move in another dimension  
Come move in another dimension oh oh oh  
Strange strange  
  
Do you go to the temple tonight   
Oh no I dont think so no  
Well go to the pagoda  
The palace of answers with me marie  
Oh no I dont believe so no  
See when they offer me book of gold  
I know soon still that platinum is coming  
And when I look inside of your temple  
It looks just like the inside of anyone one man  
And when he beckons his finger to me  
Well I move in another dimension  
I move in another dimension  
I move in another dimension oh oh oh
