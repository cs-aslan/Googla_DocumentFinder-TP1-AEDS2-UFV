You got to believe me  
Remember the words  
Remember the words  
  
When youre down on your knees  
And without a friend  
Standing afraid at the very end  
Back on your own  
Lonely and lost again  
Try to forget what youre going through  
Think of the things that youre gonna do  
Lift up your eyes  
Like they told you to  
Told you to  
  
Just remember the words  
You are never on your own  
Youre not alone  
Baby now and forever  
Remember the words  
You are never all alone not on your own  
Baby say never ever  
  
Baby say never ever  
We go up  
We go down  
But we never stop  
Were gonna work it until we drop  
Moving along  
Youre gonna be on top  
Dont be afraid you are not alone  
Dont ever think youre on your own  
Lift up your eyes  
Youll make it home  
Make it home  
  
Just remember the words  
You are never on your own  
Youre not alone  
Baby now and forever  
Remember the words  
You are never all alone not on your own  
Baby say never ever  
  
You got to believe me  
There is a reason  
Why youre crying  
And what ever you may do  
Dont forget to keep on trying  
Do what you got to do  
I said believe in you  
  
Oh Yeah Just remember the words  
You are never on your own  
Youre not alone  
Baby now and forever  
Remember the words  
You are never all alone not on your own  
Baby say never ever  
  
Just remember the words  
You are never on your own  
Youre not alone  
Baby now and forever  
Remember the words  
You are never all alone not on your own  
Baby say never ever  
  
Remember the words  
Remember the words
