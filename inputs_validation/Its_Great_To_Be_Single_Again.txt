No more dirty dishes in the sink when I come home  
I dont have to worry if Ill spend the night alone  
I can go to sleep and leave my record player on  
Youre not there to hear me if I cry  
  
Theres no way to say how much your leavin turned me on  
I get so excited when I realize youre gone  
Youre just like another verse in some old country song  
I got tired of singin long ago  
I dont even miss you when I go to bed at night  
Gee its great to know that Ill win each and every fight  
No ones arms to hold me after I turn out the light  
And I dont even miss you anymore  
I dont have to feed the dog or take the garbage out  
It dont matter if the neighbors hear me when I shout  
Since youre gone theres not much that I have to think about  
Im so happy being all alone  
Theres no more dirty dishes  
Lord I feel so good tonight  
Yeah and its great to be single again
