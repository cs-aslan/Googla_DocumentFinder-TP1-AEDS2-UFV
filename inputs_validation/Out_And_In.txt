Gazing past the planets  
Looking for total view  
Ive been laying here for hours  
You gotta make the journey out and in  
  
Wonders of a lifetime  
Right there before your eyes  
Searching with this life of ours  
You gotta make the journey out and in  
Out and in out and in  
  
Will you think its a joke  
Thats all right  
Do what you want to do  
Ive said my peace  
And Ill leave it all up to you
