Now I know  
Ive seen that look  
On your face before  
When you realized  
All the memories  
Walked right out the door  
  
Now its eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth  
No more hiding behind the truth  
Im gonna get exactly  
Whats coming to me  
  
Youre gonna break my heart again  
You never let me forget it  
Youre gonna break my heart again  
But youre gonna live to regret it  
  
Now you say  
I took advantage of you  
When you never knew the score  
But you should know  
Weve been this way  
One thousand times before  
  
You told me once  
You told me twice  
Its down to me girl  
To pay the price  
But this times the last time  
Thats for sure  
  
Youre gonna break my heart again  
You never let me forget it  
Youre gonna break my heart again  
But youre gonna live to regret it  
Yes you are  
  
You talk of how our love  
Was meant to be  
And all the time  
You sacrificed for me  
  
So how could I forget it  
Why should I regret it  
Cause when you told me you loved me  
I knew it was lies  
So no more crying no more goodbyes  
Cause this times the last time  
Thats for sure break my heart  
  
Now you say  
There is no one in the world  
Can get the better of you  
An you should know  
Cause you never made it easy  
With the pain you put me through  
  
I told you once  
I told you twice  
Its down to you girl  
To pay the price  
Cause this times the last time  
Thats for sure  
  
Youre gonna break my heart again  
You never let me forget it  
Youre gonna break my heart again  
But youre gonna live to regret it  
  
I just cant take anymore  
No more no more no more
