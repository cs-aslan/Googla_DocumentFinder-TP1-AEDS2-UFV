Theres a steel train comin through I would take it if I could  
And I would not lie to you because Sunday mornin soon will come  
  
When things will be much easier to say  
Upon the microphone like a boss DJ  
But I wont walk up upon the sea like it was dry land  
Boss DJ aint nothin but a man  
No trouble no fuss I know why  
  
Its so nice I want to hear the same song twice  
Its so nice dont want to hear the same song twice  
  
Rumors are spreading all over my town  
But its just stones and sticks  
Upon the microphone is where I go to get my fix  
  
Just let the lovin take a hold cause it will if you let it  
Im funky not a junkie but I know where to get it  
No trouble no fuss I know why  
  
Its so nice I want to hear the same song twice  
Its so nice I want to hear the same song twice  
  
Oooee girl  
Oooee girl  
Oooee girl  
  
Ooee girl and there really aint no time to waste  
Really aint no time to hate  
Aint got no time to waste time to hate  
Really aint no time to make the time go away  
  
So mister DJ dont stop the music  
I want to know  
Are you feelin the same way too  
  
I want to rock it wih youou girl  
Youou girl youou girl oooooo  
Mmmmmhmmmhhmmm  
Dont stop  
  
Cause its so nice I want to hear the same song twice  
Its so nice I want to hear the same song twice  
  
Nowadays all the songs on the radio  
They all  
All drive me crazy
