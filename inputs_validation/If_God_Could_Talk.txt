If God could talk would He tell you to come back to me  
If God could talk would He tell you its alright just leave  
And dont look back at all the memories  
The best of times the mess you made of me  
Walk on if you think its gonna make you strong  
Why dont you run away and find yourself alive  
Go on and turn the page before your lonely world collides  
Whats it gonna take to break the silence  
Thats been tearin you apart  
If God could talk would He part the oceans straight to you  
Make mountains move crumble at your feet to get you through  
Another day another night alone  
Step right out into the great unknown tonight  
Even God knows baby that aint right  
Why dont you run away and find yourself alive  
Go on and turn the page before your lonely world collides  
Whats it gonna take to break the silence  
Thats been tearin you apart If God could talk  
Did you swear to yourself on the day it was over  
That youd never turn around and get locked up in another cage  
Did you tear all the pictures of us living life together  
Did you burn all the memories that have been made in a fit of rage  
Why dont you run away and find yourself alive  
Go on and turn the page before your lonely world collides  
Whats it gonna take to break the silence  
Thats been tearin you apart  
If only God could talk  
If only God could talk  
If only God could talk  
If only God could talk  
Would you listen now if God could talk
