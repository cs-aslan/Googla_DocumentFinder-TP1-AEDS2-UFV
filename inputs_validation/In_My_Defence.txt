In my defence what is there to say  
All the mistakes we made must be faced today  
Its not easy now knowing where to start  
While the world we love tears itself apart  
Im just a singer with a song  
How can I try to right the wrong  
For just a singer with a melody  
Im caught in between  
With a fading dream  
  
In my defence what is there to say  
We destroy the love  its our way  
We never listen enough never face the truth  
Then like a passing song  
Love is here and then its gone  
  
Im just a singer with a song  
How can I try to right the wrong  
For just a singer with a melody  
Im caught in between  
With a fading dream  
  
Im just a singer with a song  
How can I try to right the wrong  
Im just a singer with a melody  
Im caught in between with a fading dream  
Caught in between with a fading dream  
Caught in between with a fading dream  
  
Oh what on earth  
Oh what on earth  
How do I try  
Do we live or die  
  
Oh help me God  
Please help me
