I Im a one way motorway  
Im a road that drives away and follows you back home  
I Im a street light shining  
Im a wild light blinding bright burning off alone  
  
Its times like these you learn to live again  
Its times like these you give and give again  
Its times like these you learn to love again  
Its times like these time and time again  
  
I Im a new day rising  
Im a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight  
I Im a little divided  
Do I stay or run away or leave it all behind  
  
Its times like these you learn to live again  
Its times like these you give and give again  
Its times like these you learn to love again  
Its times like these time and time again  
  
Its times like these you learn to live again  
Its times like these you give and give again  
Its times like these you learn to love again  
Its times like these time and time again
