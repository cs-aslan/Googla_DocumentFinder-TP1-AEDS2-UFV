Ridin on a greyhound countin those white lines  
Destination I dont know and Im feelin like Im dyin  
Well ten years on this road my its took its toll  
But the man with the plan says the band has got to go  
I said roll gypsy roll  
Lord just pick up your bags and go  
  
Met many a woman on my way down the line  
Every woman that I met I left satisfied  
I made lots of money just how much I dont know  
But most of the money I done stuck up my nose  
I said roll gypsy roll  
Lord just pick up your bags and go  
  
Gypsys lifes a story and its one thats never told  
Hes always hungry hes always on the go  
With no tomorrow its how it seems to be  
When youre moving around from town to town  
  
Made lots of money just how much I dont know  
But most of the money I done stuck up my nose  
And maybe thats the reason I dont know where Im going  
I dont know
