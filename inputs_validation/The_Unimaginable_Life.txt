I know we were born to be here again  
In the kind of love that you die for  
Somethin in the innocent winds  
Been callin out to me  
Over n over  
  
I would build a castle upon our dreams  
Or leave it all behind us in ashes  
Just to feel your heart in my heart  
A promise and a prayer  
To lead n to follow  
Voices that call  
From an ancient dream  
Remind me of a world Ive never known  
  
Chorus  
We are the bridge  
We are the fire  
N I burn in a river of love  
And now I can sing with all my heart  
  
Oh I believe  
All that Ive seen in your eyes  
An unimaginable life  
  
Something in the way that you say hello  
Even to the sound of your heart beat  
All seems so familiar to me  
My soulmemory of love  
Leading me homeward  
  
Voices that call from an ancient dream  
The promise of a life Ive never known  
  
We are the bridge  
We are the fire  
And I burn in a river of love  
  
I know I can sing  
With all my heart  
Here it begins  
Freedom is in your eyes  
An unimaginable life  
  
Chorus  
  
N I know I can sing  
With all my heart  
Oh I believe  
Darlin that weve arrived  
An unimaginable life  
Our unimaginable life
