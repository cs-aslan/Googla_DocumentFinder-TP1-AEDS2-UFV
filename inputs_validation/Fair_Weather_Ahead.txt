Theres this place full of mountain heads  
Living and chewing on the fat  
Built upon the hazy plan  
Like foundations slipping through the sand  
  
Long teeth and whiskers like a rat  
Fearing only those present  
They got zero emotion  
And everybodys fed up with that  
  
Warm outside but very cold within  
Followed and praised for many years  
They got all the promotions  
Isnt that the way its always been  
  
Historys written always red  
Its pages are painful and clear  
Its so full of devotion  
Makes you wonder where it could have led  
  
Put the lights out fair weather ahead  
These strange new creatures  
Aha they wont be led
