I thought Id give my love to anyone today  
But when it came to you one thing was for sure  
Well I know your little games and I dont want to play  
Its like takin sick when nobody knows the cure  
You come on like the princess of the junior prom  
Always part of everything thats going down  
Just looking for another fool to lean upon  
In the center ring and everyones your clown  
  
Cant you see Ive lost my nerve  
I just cant face you  
Perhaps Ill let the time erase you  
Cant you see Ive lost my nerve  
I just cant face you  
Perhaps Ill let the time erase you  
  
I thought Id give my love to anyone today  
But when it came to you one thing was for sure  
Well I know your little games and I dont want to play  
Its like takin sick when nobody knows the cure
