Remember the days of the old school yard  
we used to laugh a lot  
Oh dont you remember the days of the old school yard  
When we had imaginings and we had all kinds of things  
And we laughed and needed love  
Yes I do oh and I remember you  
  
Remember the days of the old school yard  
we used to cry a lot  
Oh dont you remember the days of the old school yard  
When we had simplicity and we had warm toast for tea  
And we laughed and needed love  
Yes I do oh and I remember you  
  
You were my sweet love woman  
My first sweet love Cat  
My lovey dove woman  
My love lovey dove Cat  
No matter what unknown woman  
What ever the place Cat  
Id still see your face woman  
Your smiling face Cat  
You unknown me woman  
Inside my dreams Cat  
Like Englands queen woman  
God save our Queen Cat  
Though time may fade woman  
Though time may fade Cat  
It aint never too late woman  
To learn about love both  
learn about love Cat  
  
Remember the days of the old school yard  
we used to laugh a lot  
Oh dont you remember the days of the old school yard  
When we had imaginings and we had all kinds of things  
And we laughed and needed love  
Yes I do oh and I remember you
