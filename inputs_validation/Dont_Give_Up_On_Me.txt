Riding down the freeway Ive got to stay free  
I need a little leeway and an angel to watch over me  
Dont give up on me  
Dont give up on me  
Cause I know I let you down girl  
Once twice or maybe three  
I fell into temptation  
Wont you tell me that youll wait for me  
  
Dont give up on me  
Dont give up on me  
Dont give up on me  
Dont give up on me

Dont give up on me

Dont give up on me please  
Dont give up on me
