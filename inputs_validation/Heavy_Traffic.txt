Everybodys been a long time talking  
Aint nobody said a word thats true  
Aint it time to stop this crap type talking  
Wont you tell us what youre gonna do  
  
Tell you what why dont we break this pattern  
Tell you what why dont we do some do  
All together we can make it happen  
Untogether and we wont get through  
  
Want to drive yeh drive  
I want to drive but I cant get nowhere  
Heavy traffic all over this town  
I want to drive yeh drive  
I want to drive I gotta get somewhere  
Heavy traffic is bringing me down  
  
Every time I see the red light burning  
Dont it always make the air turn blue  
But until we see the red light turning  
There aint nothing anyone can do  
  
We all dream about an open highway  
Making dreams is all that we can do  
Wed be moving on if I had my way  
Nothing can stop me getting back to you  
  
Want to drive yeh drive  
I want to drive but I cant get nowhere  
Heavy traffic all over this town  
I want to drive yeh drive  
I want to drive I gotta get somewhere  
Heavy traffic coming into this town  
  
I want to drive yeh drive  
I want to drive but I cant get nowhere  
Heavy traffic all over this town  
I want to drive yeh drive  
I want to drive I gotta get somewhere  
Heavy traffic is bringing me down  
Heavy traffic all over this town  
  
Heavy traffic all over this town  
  
Heavy traffic coming into this town  
  
Heavy traffic
