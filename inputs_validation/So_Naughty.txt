At the gypsys eye  
When the moon is high  
And the mood is right for dancing romancing  
While Michael Wails  
In his baggy tails  
Makes it all seem so enhancing for dancing  
CHORUS  
Oh youre so naughty  
Oh with your body  
Oh youre so naughty  
I wanna get naughty with you  
If you want me to  
All those fools out there  
Could they be aware  
I just need someone to come home to  
But you are so rare I dont even care  
Cause I got you to roam with  
Could I be dreamin  
Am I with you  
My heart is screamin  
Could this be true  
Lets keep it goin  
Our love is rare  
Lets keep it growin  
Were almost there
