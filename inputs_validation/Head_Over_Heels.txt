I wanted to be with you alone  
And talk about the weather  
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face  
Wont escape my attention  
You keep your distance with a system of touch  
And gentle persuasion  
Im lost in admiration could I need you this much  
Oh youre just wasting my time  
Youre just wasting time  
  
Something happens and Im head over heels  
I never find out till Im head over heels  
Something happens and Im head over heels  
Ah dont take my heart dont break my heart  
Dont dont throw it away  
  
I made a fire and watching it burn  
I thought of your future  
With one foot in the past now just how long will it last  
No no no have you no ambition  
My mother and my brothers used to breathing clean air  
And dreaming Im a doctor  
Its hard to be a man when theres a gun in your hand  
Oh I feel so  
  
Something happens and Im head over heels  
I never find out till Im head over heels  
Something happens and Im head over heels  
Ah dont take my heart dont break my heart  
Dont dont throw it away  
  
And this is my four leaf clover  
Im on the line one open mind  
This is my four leaf clover
