Operator well could you help me place this call  
See the number on the matchbook is old and faded  
Shes living in L A with my best old exfriend Ray  
A guy she said she knew well and sometimes hated  
  
Isnt that the way they say it goes  
Well lets forget all that  
And give me the number if you can find it  
So I can call just to tell em Im fine and to show  
Ive overcome the blow Ive learned to take it well  
I only wish my words could just convince myself  
That it just wasnt real  
But thats not the way it feels  
  
Operator could you help me place this call  
Well I cant read the number that you just gave me  
Theres something in my eyes you know it happens every time  
I think about a love that I thought would save me  
  
Isnt that the way they say it goes  
Well lets forget all that  
And give me the number if you can find it  
So I can call just to tell em Im fine and to show  
Ive overcome the blow Ive learned to take it well  
I only wish my words could just convince myself  
That it just wasnt real  
But thats not the way it feels  
  
Operator lets forget about this call  
You see theres no one there I really wanted to talk to  
Thank you for your time ah youve been so much more than kind  
And you can keep the dime  
  
Isnt that the way they say it goes  
Well lets forget all that
