Take for example when you go to the movies these days you know  
They try to sell you this jumbo drink eight extra ounces of watered  
down cherry coke for an extra twenty five cents I dont want it  
I dont want that much organization in my life  
I dont want other people thinking for me  
I want my Junior Mints  
Where did the Junior Mints go in the movies  
I dont want a twelve lb Nestles crunch for twenty five dollars  
I want Junior Mints  
  
We need more fruitcakes in this world and less bakers  
We need people that care Im mad as hell  
And I dont want to take it anymore  
  
Fruitcakes in the kitchen Fruitcakes in the kitchen  
Fruitcakes on the street Fruitcakes on the street  
Struttin naked through the crosswalk  
In the middle of the week  
Halfbaked cookies in the oven Cookies in the oven  
Halfbaked people on the bus People on the bus  
Theres a little bit of fruitcake left in everyone of us  
  
Paradise lost and found  
Paradise take a look around  
I was out in California where I hear they have it all  
They got riots fires mud slides  
Theyve got sushi in the mall  
Water bars brontosaurs Chinese modern lust  
Shake and bake life with the quake  
The secrets in the crust  
  
We lost our Martian rocket ship  
The high paid spokesman said  
Looks like that silly rocket ship  
Has lost its cone shaped head  
We spent ninety jillion dollars trying to get a look at Mars  
I hear universal laughter ringing out among the stars  
  
Mea Culpa Mea Culpa Mea Maxima Culpa  
Mea Culpa Mea Culpa Mea Maxima Culpa  
  
Wheres the church who took the steeple  
Religion is in the hands of some crazyass people  
Television preachers with bad hair and dimples  
The gods honest truth is its not that simple  
Its the Buddhist in you its the Pagan in me  
Its the Muslim in him shes Catholic aint she  
Its the born again look its the WASP and the Jew  
Tell me whats goin on I aint gotta clue  
  
She said you gotta do your fair share  
Now cough up half the rent  
I treat my body like a temple  
You treat yours like a tent  
But the right word at the right time  
May get me a little hug  
Thats the difference between lightning  
And a harmless lightnin bug  
  
Were seven years from the millennium  
Thats a science fiction fact  
Stanley Kubrick and his buddy HAL  
Now dont look that abstract  
So Ill put on my Bob Marley tape  
And practice what I preach  
Get Jah lost in the reggae mon  
As I walk along the beach  
Stay in touch with my insanity really is the only way  
Its a jungle out there kiddies  
Have a very fruitful day  
Hey
