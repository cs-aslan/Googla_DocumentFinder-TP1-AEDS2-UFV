I dont know how to play it  
I dont know how to say it  
But its true  
Oooooh Im losing you  
I only know that maybe  
You and I have got to talk things trough  
But baby before we do  
Im telling you  
Chorus  
You can go right on breaking my heart  
I wouldnt care at all  
You can go right on taking my love  
Ill never close the door  
And even thoughi know you dont  
Love me anymore  
You can hurt me but you wont break down  
My love  
I dont know what began it  
It happens all the time  
So Ive been told  
Love grows old and cold  
Not for me the easy way  
I love you then and now I love you still  
And I guess I always will  
Meanwhile  
Repeat chorus  
Not for me the easy way  
I dont want no trial seperation  
Id rather face the sleepless nights  
Working on our loves salvation  
Repeat chorus  
Loves salvation  
youve got to keep working on  
Our loves salvation  
youve got to keep working on  
Repeat til fade
