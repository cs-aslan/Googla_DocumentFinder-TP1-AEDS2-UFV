Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the show  
We want it all we want it now we wanted you to know  
So keep your hands and legs inside the ride and take it slow  
Its bullshit by design were about to blow your mind  
I aint no Steve McQueen  
Im like a dead pop star in a magazine  
Im really one last loss in quarantine  
With pro tools gutting up the hit machine  
So come and take more take more  
You cant help us out no  
Now escape more escape more  
You cant help us out no  
And break more break more  
You cant help us out  
We play hard out on the asphalt  
Dont think youre cut out for this go  
Save me from myself  
This aint a test its state of emergency  
Cause I cant stop myself Im trying my best  
Tell me what else could go wrong  
I dream like hollow queen  
I got a knife in my back and a song to scream  
I watch the walls cave in inhaling gasoline  
Its like that in the middle of this party scene  
So come and take more take more  
You cant take us out no  
Now escape more escape more  
You cant take us out no  
And break more break more  
You cant take us out  
We play hard out on the asphalt  
Dont think youre cut out for this go  
Save me from myself  
This aint a test its state of emergency  
Cause I cant stop myself Im trying my best  
But tell me what else could go wrong  
This is some good shit whered you get it  
Youre such a fucking hypocrite its so appropriate  
Im feeling so delinquent and all degenerate  
This is some good shit man whered you get it  
Im tellin you another store was open  
We all went crawling along the way to buy it  
But cant be buyin it  
Save me from myself  
This aint a test its state of emergency  
Cause I cant stop myself Im trying my best  
Tell me what else could go wrong  
Save me from myself  
This aint a test its a state of emergency  
Cause I cant stop myself Im trying my best  
Tell me what else could go wrong  
Thanks for coming to the show  
Incomprehensible get on the floor

Straight out just lose your mind
