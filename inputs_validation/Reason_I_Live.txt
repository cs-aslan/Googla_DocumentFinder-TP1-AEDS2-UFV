I was no one when I first met you  
I had nothing of worth in my life  
But then I found you and it all became clear  
Youre the one that Ive been searching for  
From the start I couldnt figure it out  
Why someone like you would die for me  
But I know that your love for me is so great  
And that is why Im giving you my life  
  
I am yours every part of me  
Jesus youre the reason I live  
Take my life lord and use me as you will  
Jesus youre the reason I live  
  
I cant believe that youre with me til forever  
Ill never leave you and youll never leave me  
Its what I long for your presence here in my life  
Cause youre the air I breathe my reason why  
  
I am yours every part of me  
Jesus youre the reason I live  
Take my life lord and use me as you will  
Jesus youre the reason I live  
  
I am yours every part of me  
Jesus youre the reason I live  
Take my life lord and use me as you will  
Jesus youre the reason I live  
  
Youre the reason Youre the reason I live  
Youre the reason Youre the reason I live  
Youre the reason Youre the reason I live  
Youre the reason Youre the reason I live  
  
I am yours every part of me  
Jesus youre the reason I live  
Take my life lord and use me as you will  
Jesus youre the reason I live  
  
I am yours every part of me  
Jesus youre the reason I live  
Take my life lord and use me as you will  
Jesus youre the reason I live  
  
My Jesus Youre the reason I live  
My Jesus Youre the reason I live  
My Jesus Youre the reason I live  
My Jesus Youre the reason I live
