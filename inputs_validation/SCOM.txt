I came from pumping 60K out the trunk switchblades  
Ziggy stuff nicknames itchy braids bitchmade  
Faggots my shits changed my cabbage is picked man  
Rollin twenties up like Snoop Doggy dogs crip game  
But Im out for the crown housin Im buckin em down  
Dousin and dunkin these fuckin punks in a bucket and bounce  
When I get up in the game beware  
Put a pimp on a hope and then say your prayers  
Got this ocean so damn potent player  
Put you on a throne like a broken chair  
You know its a move no crack for the gods and goons  
We back you talk about gats but dont actually use em  
But Im happy to do it because this is demigodz  
Celph Titled Ryu with Tak Apathy stupid

Cockin the glock o more of that  
Now I just hop in the drop and go  
To the most popular spots  
With hos and they know they go  
I went from pumpin that white stuff  
To bein up in them white clubs  
Like hey I got dubs still pumpin that white stuff  
Plus I fuck with the white boys skaters and bike boys  
Who may act different but the struggles alike boy  
Shinoda know that if theres a problem Im coming over yo  
Quick fast in a hurry not needing to overdose  
And I mean that just call if you need that  
The best of both different worlds not often they see that
