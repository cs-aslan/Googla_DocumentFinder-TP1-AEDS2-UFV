When I was a girl my favorite thing  
In the whole wide world  
Was to see a field and  
Run for no reason  
And off Id go no one behind  
Only earth below  
Just a patch of green green as the season  
Dont ask why your feet just fly  
Green and sky is all that youre needin  
  
Why ask why when all thats true  
The sky is blue blue for no reason  
Now that things have changed  
Everythings carefully prearranged  
Not a thing gets done  
Except for a reason  
Now Im overrun Im startin to feel  
Like a hired gun  
Wheres the chance wheres the fun  
Where is the pleasin  
  
Try and try you moan and sigh  
You just cant find a thing to believe in  
Why ask why when all thats true  
The sky is blue blue for no reason  
Dont ask why your feet just fly  
Green and sky is all that youre needin  
Why ask why when all thats true  
Youre just blue blue for no reason
