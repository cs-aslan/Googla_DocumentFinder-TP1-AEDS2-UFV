I can feel them theyre here  
The howling winds of war  
You can sense them  
They are bad omens  
You can see the death dealing hordes  
And for eons now  
Since the dawn of time  
Round and round it goes  
Since long before us  
The winds of war  
Invasion  
The winds of war  
Invasion  
Theres no reason  
Theres no rhyme  
They will bring eternal night  
Oh no  
Its too late to turn back now  
A soldier lives to die  
And now for all to behold  
Its the moment of truth  
Here are the sons of Babylons whore  
The winds of war  
Invasion  
The winds of war  
Invasion  
guitar solo  
The winds of war  
Invasion  
The winds of war  
Invasion  
The winds of war  
Invasion  
The winds of war  
Invasion
