Twenty four hours of every day  
Id walk on glass just to hear you say  
Gettin it on is like a drug to me  
I want you baby cant you see  
Im crashed and Im crushed and Im stuck on you  
Id do anything that you want me to  
Id crawl on my knees just to get to you  
I close my eyes and girl its true  
  
On a psychedelic space machine galactic sugar high  
Like a caffeinated satellite gone way past ninety nine  
Come on be my  
  
21st century girl all outrageous quite contagious  
21st century you got solar fire  
21st century girl sweet romancer cosmic dancer  
21st century sha la la la girl  
  
Kiss this youre blowin my mind  
Never say never but Im takin my time  
Girl to the world from the A to the Z  
I fall for you so easily  
Catch my breath cause I know too well  
That I just cant control myself  
Realize we synchronize  
Its only when i close my eyes  
  
On a psychedelic space machine galactic sugar high  
Like a caffeinated satellite gone way past 99  
Come on be my  
  
21st century girl all outrageous quite contagious  
21st century you got solar fire  
21st century girl sweet romancer cosmic dancer  
21st century shes high on flying  
  
Flying flying  
You take me up you set me free  
No time to breathe just zero G  
High still flying no gravity  
Shes flying  
  
On a psychedelic space machine galactic sugar high  
Like a caffeinated satellite gone way past ninety nine  
Come on be my  
  
21st century girl all outrageous quite contagious  
21st century you got solar fire  
21st century girl sweet romancer cosmic dancer  
21st century high on flying  
21st century sha la la la girl  
Shes a 21st century sha la la la girl  
21st century sha la la la girl  
Shes a 21st century sha la la la girl
