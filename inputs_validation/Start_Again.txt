Its winter time in the middle of the spring  
I cant believe it loneliness is calling me  
And I can hear it  
See I never thought Id feel this way  
So soon no  
There is something that I know I have to do  
  
Start again  
And this time Ill make it better than before  
I start again  
For the second time around  
Ill do much more yeah  
Cause I refuse to let life  
Ill pick the pieces up  
And start again yeah  
  
Other roads yeah  
Oh this time I must be careful  
When I choose them  
See love was for the taking  
But I refused it  
I never thought  
It cut so deep inside me  
Oh no  
There is something  
That I know I have to do  
  
I start again  
And this time Ill make it better than before yeah  
Start again  
For the second time around  
Ill do much more yeah  
Cause I refuse to let life  
Ill pick the pieces up  
And start again  
  
I cant seem to think  
Of nothing better I can do  
  
But start again  
  
And this time Ill make it better than before yeah  
Start again  
For the second time around  
Ill do much more yeah  
Cause I refuse to let life  
Ill pick the pieces up  
  
And start again  
  
Oh this time Ill make it better than before yeah  
Ill start again  
For the second time around  
Ill do much more yeah  
Cause I refuse to let life  
Ill pick the pieces up  
And start again
