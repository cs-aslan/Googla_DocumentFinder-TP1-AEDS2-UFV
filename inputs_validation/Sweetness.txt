Oh youre a precious little prude  
But tell me the truth now  
Have you ever had a care in the world  
So tell me whats it all about  
You say oh youre so attacked  
Well youll never be so right  
Oh you can cry yourself dry  
But id be surprised if you can munster  
Up a single crocodile  
Youll never be a hopeless child  
Throw caution to the wind  
Forgive yourself your sins  
And dont you know you  
Really are the sweetest thing  
There isnt heart enough from you  
Do you no longer care or feel that  
You no longer have nothing left to prove  
Oh tell me that it isnt true  
I wanted to tell you  
That I used to admire you  
Oh you know really that I dont cared  
No I never cared for you  
But I used to read about you  
And you oftenly would throw caution to the wind  
And dont you know you  
Really are the sweetest thing
