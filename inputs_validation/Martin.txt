He was born in the woods  
Torn from his home  
Well he was naked  
And destined  
To be out on his own  
And he waited in darkness  
Hoping someone might see  
From something so rough  
What a treasure hed be  
  
Stronger than steel and wood  
Seen me through the bad and good  
And when Im hanging by a string  
Every little thing  
Is understood  
Between Martin and me  
  
Hes hollow in the middle  
From the shape that hes in  
Hes either filled up with music  
Or locked in his shell again  
And it takes some fine tuning  
To make him come around  
But hes a huge piece of me  
And Ill never put him down  
  
Stronger than steel and wood  
Seen me through the bad and good  
And when Im hanging by a string  
Every little thing  
Is understood  
Between Martin and me  
  
He is a good friend  
And he has his own voice  
And you get what you give  
Sometimes its just noise  
But if you treat him well  
He will last your life long  
And if youre honest and open  
Well he will write you a song  
Write you a song write you a song  
  
Stronger than steel and wood  
Seen me through the bad and good  
And when Im hanging by a string  
Every little thing  
Is understood  
And when Im hanging by a string  
Every little thing  
Is understood  
Between Martin and me
