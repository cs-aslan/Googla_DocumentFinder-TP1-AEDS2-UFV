King Kong you gotta come home  
Youve a wife and family all alone in the jungle  
Are you receiving OK  
  
King Kong you done what you shouldnt a did  
You got a woman back home and a couple of kids  
And they get so tired of waiting  
  
And if we lived in another world  
Id be a boy and youd be a girl  
If we lived in another world  
Who knows   
  
I will repair all the pavements youve cracked if you come back and say youll
be mine  
Yes I will fix all the mortars and bricks  
But a tree house will do us just fine  
  
King Kong you gotta come home  
Youve a wife and family all alone in the jungle  
Do you remember OK  
  
King Kong hanging out in LA  
Its a change from New York  
Wont you have a nice day  
You may even get a movie come your way  
  
And if we lived in another world  
Youd be a boy and Id be a girl  
If we lived in another world  
Who knows  who knows   
  
I will give back all the love you can give  
If youre gentle and you will be kind  
You stomping off to the US of A wasnt quite what I had in my mind  
  
And if we lived in another world  
Id be a boy and youd be a girl  
If we lived in another world  
Who knows  who knows   
  
I will repair all the pavements youve cracked if you come back and say youll
be mine  
Yes I will fix all the mortars and bricks  
But a tree house will do us just fine  
  
I will give back all the love you can give  
If youre gentle and you will be kind  
Yes I will fix all the mortars and bricks  
But a tree house will do us just fine
