If I could write you a song  
With all the right words  
When would these black clouds begin to burn up  
The moment you heard  
  
If I could make you a map  
Would you find your way home  
You know you cant keep me alive  
Leave me alone  
  
Tell me Im yours  
Tell me youre mine  
Tell me Im anything but fine  
Tell me a story  
Tell me the time  
Tell me a lie  
  
If I could make you a tape  
With all the right noise  
Would you smile when you listen and sigh  
Boys will be boys  
  
If I could paint you a picture  
Id turn black into white  
By now Im not lookin for love  
Just lookin for tonight  
  
So tell me Im yours  
Tell me youre mine  
Tell me Im anything but fine  
Tell me a story  
Tell me the time  
Tell me a lie  
  
And tell me Im yours  
Tell me youre mine  
Tell me Im anything but fine  
Tell me a story  
Tell me the time  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me what I want to hear  
Tomorrow I will disappear  
You wont ever have to see me again  
  
And tell me Im yours  
Tell me youre mine  
Tell me Im anything but fine  
Tell me a story  
Tell me the time  
Tell me a lie  
  
You said that words can only get you so far  
But Ive got sentences that cover up all my scars  
In the end I might forget where they are  
Talk to me tonight  
  
And if we started all over today  
I think we know that wed end up in the same place  
Maybe youre right and weve got nothing to say  
I want to hear it anyway  
I want to hear it anyway
