Where Ive been you dont know  
And what Ive got baby it dont show  
Now I wont try to teach you how dont talk now  
Dont talk roads dont talk sand  
Dont talk dust dont talk no man  
Dont talk rules dont talk vows dont talk now  
  
I dont want to hear the same old song  
And too many rights still make her wrong baby  
I know she cant hurt me less by talking more  
She cant make good what was bad before  
  
No Its too late now for me to lie  
And I cant make a second try  
I just came on back baby  
Got to say good bye good bye  
Dont talk now dont talk now  
Dont talk now dont talk now
