You said before me met  
That your life was awful tame  
Well I took you to a night club  
And the whole band knew your name oh  
  
Well baby baby baby  
Ive got news for you  
Oh somehow your story dont ring true  
Well Ive got news for you  
  
Well you phoned me youd be late  
Cause you took the wrong express  
And then you walked in smiling  
With your lipstick all a mess  
  
Oh let me say to you little mama  
Whoa Ive got news for you  
Ah your story dont ring true lil girl  
Yeah Ive got news for you  
  
Oh you wore a diamond watch  
Claimed it was from uncle Joe  
When I looked at the inscription  
It said love from daddyo  
  
Oh well baby whoa lil girl I want to say  
Ive got news for you  
Ah if you think that jive will do  
Let me tell you oh  
Ive got news for you  
Well somehow your story dont ring true  
Wo Ive got news for you
