I pick things up I am a collector  
And things well things they tend to accumulate  
I have this net it drags behind me  
It picks up feelings for me to feed upon  
  
There are times plenty of times  
I wish I could let it go  
But its time to breed  
And its got to grow inside me  
  
There are times plenty of times  
I wish I could let it go  
But its time to make me think things  
I dont want to know  
  
Im trying to fit it all inside  
Im trying to open my mouth wide  
Im trying not to choke  
And swallow it all  
Swallow it all  
Swallow it all  
Swallow it all  
  
I am the plague  
I am the swarm  
All your heart sticks on me  
And I keep it warm  
  
Itll make me stay  
It wont let me leave  
There are so goddamn many of them  
It gets hard to breathe  
  
Im trying to fit it all inside  
Im trying to open my mouth wide  
Im trying not to choke inside  
I am a good boy and I will  
Swallow it all  
Swallow it all  
Swallow it all  
Swallow it all
