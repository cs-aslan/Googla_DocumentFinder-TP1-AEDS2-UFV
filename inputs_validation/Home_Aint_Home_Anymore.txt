Ive seen so many smiling faces today  
But just what lies behind them I cant see  
Ive lived my life in many places you see  
Now I dont know just where I want to be  
  
Cause home aint home anymore no more  
My heart aint here anymore no more  
  
The years have opened up a canyon it seems  
A canyon deep and wide that I cant cross  
And though my nomad days have opened my eyes  
Ive learned that every game must bear a loss  
  
Cause home aint home anymore no more  
My heart aint here anymore no more  
  
Dont be afraid to tell me  
That things are not the same  
Im older now and wiser  
I know how things can change  
  
Cause home aint home anymore no more  
My heart aint here anymore no more
