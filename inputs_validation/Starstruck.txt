Where is your inspiration you lost it oh so long ago  
so much for innovation I saw this coming long before  
You had no motivation your hopes are high but trapped below  
This constant competition weve won but your still keeping score  
  
But I grew up wishing on a star  
Your think I wont ever get to far  
  
So high on dedication it feels so good to get away  
From all this repetition this angry town this battleground  
So now well break tradition well leave you swimming in our wake  
Without your inspiration you can survive youll surely drown  
  
But I grew up wishing on a star  
Your think I wont ever get to far  
But I grew up wishing on a star  
You think I wont ever get to far  
Where is your inspiration you lost it oh so long ago
