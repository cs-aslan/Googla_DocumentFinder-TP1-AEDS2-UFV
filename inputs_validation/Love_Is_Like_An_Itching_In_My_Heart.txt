The love bug done bit me  
Didnt mean for him to get me  
Woo get up in the morning  
And Im filled with desire  
No no I cant stop the fire  
Love is real live wire  
Oo its a burning sensation  
Far beyond imagination  
  
Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart tearing it all apart  
Just an itching in my heart  
And baby I cant scratch it  
  
Keeps me sighing oo  
Keeps me yearning  
No mama cant help me  
No daddy cant help me  
Ive been bitten by the love bug  
And I need some information  
o help me out of this situation  
Now when youre ill you take a pill  
When youre thirsty drink your fill  
What you gonna do oh yeah  
when love gets a hold a hold on you  
Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart  
And baby I cant scratch it  
  
Love is a nagging irritation  
Causing my heart complication  
Love is a growing infection  
And I dont know the correction  
Got me rocking and areeling  
And I cant shake the feeling  
Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart  
tearing it all apart  
Just an Itching in my heart  
And baby I cant scratch it
