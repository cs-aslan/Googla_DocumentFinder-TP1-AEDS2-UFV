Lying next to you in the dark  
Listening to your pounding heart  
The sheets are tangled around your waist  
I watch the dream moving on your face  
I feel you shake hear your cries  
Running in the dark trying to open your eyes  
Come on baby wake up  
Ive followed you across the days and years  
Ive been there for the thrills and the tears  
Chasing you from state to state  
Waking dreaming I try to relate  
Why should I be somebody you fear  
When youre asleep and Im so near  
Dont even know why Im in your dreams  
I got control over none of these things  
Morning comes hard and bright  
And Im exhausted from running after you all night  
Chasing you into the light  
Yeah Ive been reaching for you baby  
As if I could reach you when you dream at night  
But I never can quite  
I aint lying here awake by myself you better wake up  
Theres something I want to talk to you about you better wake up  
I love you girl tell the world I do theres nothing I wouldnt do for you  
I want to rescue you like you rescued me  
From a life of doubt and uncertainty  
Thats why Im chasing you chasing you into the light  
Go for a walk on the pier with me baby  
Now as the dawn comes over the night  
Watching the stars in the sky disappear maybe  
Youll find a way to let go of your fright  
The sea is deep the world is wide  
Ships are leaving for the other side  
This whole city will be waking soon and in the east  
Clouds are strung out behind the moon  
Chasing her into the light wake up  
I aint lying here awake by myself you better wake up  
Theres something I got to talk to you about you better wake up  
Baby wake up wake up baby wake up wake up wake up
