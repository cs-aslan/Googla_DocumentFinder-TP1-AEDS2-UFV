Love feels lost  
Where is it to be found  
My heart is still here  
We have to go around and around  
In all the time  
I was loving you faithfully  
And you took my love  
And you turn around on me  
Now I dont wanna fight with you  
I got everything I can do  
Dont you leave me like that I just want my girl back  
Let me work it out for it is over  
What are we doing  
What can we see to work it out  
What are we doing  
Can we forget what love was about  
Feels like Im losing when it was everything to me  
And now I realize  
Were just better not together  
Its hard to let go  
Girl we ment through so many things  
But for you to grow have to go on and spring your wings  
I see your tear you surce for a pride of day  
You should have hold it through  
When you gave my love away  
Now I dont wanna fight with you  
I got everything I can do  
Had to leave it like that but my thought Imma back  
We tried to work it out  
But its over  
What are we doing  
What can we see to work it out  
What are we doing  
Can we forget what love was about  
Feels like Im losing when it was everything to me  
And now I realize  
Were just better not together  
Girl its just too much for me to say  
You were tell me that you love me  
And now I watch you walk away  
But girl the way you fight  
Its just the mine  
Thats way I spend it this way  
No what else to say  
But girl you know that I still love you yeah  
What are we doing  
What can we see to work it out  
What are we doing  
Can we forget what love was about  
Feels like Im losing when it was everything to me  
And now I realize  
Were just better not together  
I realize  
Were just better not together
