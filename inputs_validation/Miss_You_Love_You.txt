This has not been easy  
This has been hard  
I am scarred  
And I do not know what to do with you  
  
Go inside kiss your mouth with my lips  
Grab your hips cant remember why I fell in love with this  
  
But I miss you I love you  
Its a shame you cant stay away from me this time oh no  
You beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you  
You wont be getting my affection again oh no  
I dont need you tonight  
  
Who do you think you are  
No one cares about a name without a face  
So dont go shooting up the place  
Make no mistake your loves not real  
Cause the love that Ive got is deeper so much deeper than you could ever
feel  
  
And I miss you I love you  
Its a shame you cant stay away from me this time oh no  
You beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you  
You wont be getting my affection again oh no  
Cause I dont need you tonight  
  
It was really nice to know you  
But theres nothing left to show you  
I got bills to pay get out the way its time to move on  
And dinner with your boyfriend will never be the same again  
Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him  
  
I miss you I love you  
Its a shame you cant stay away from me this time oh no  
You beg me you ask me  
To kiss you and hug you  
You wont be getting my affection again  
So oh no cause I dont need you  
And I miss you I love you  
Its a shame you cant stay away from me this time oh no  
You beg me you ask me to  
Kiss you and hug you  
You wont be getting my affection again  
So no no cause I wont need you
