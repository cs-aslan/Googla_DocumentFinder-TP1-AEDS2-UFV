I cant believe that what I feel is really happening to me  
Make it hurt  
And point the finger at my insecurities  
Well I guess I just dont understand about those complexities in your mind  
And I guess I just dont understand why this world seems so unkind  
  
Chorus  
Maybe Maybe just once I get whats coming  
Maybe Maybe just once I get whats coming to me  
  
So once again the way you feel will never ever stay the same  
And Im to blame  
I wonder just who made the rules up for this game  
Well I guess I just dont understand about what you want and what you need  
And I guess I just dont understand about how it has to be  
  
Chorus  
  
You sat down on this bed and you said  
Christ what the hell do you think this place is  
You know  
He just couldnt believe it  
And I said  
I dont know but it sure is something different  
So go ahead  
You say those thousand things you think you have to say  
Look at me  
And tell me loves not such a hard word anyway  
Well how can you count on me I thought you realized for sure  
And how can you just believe  
I thought I deserved just a little more  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh God  
Oh whats coming to me
