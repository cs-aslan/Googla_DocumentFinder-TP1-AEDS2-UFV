Life is too short dont throw it away  
Hear what I say if youre lonely  
Stand up if you fall down  
Please look around youre not the only  
  
Life is too short dont lose your time  
The sun will shine for your tomorrows  
Youll win if you dont lose  
Try it again forget your sorrows  
  
There is a chance make the best out of your life  
But its so tough only the strong they will survive  
There are always some good reasons to live for  
Between the shadow theres a light you cant ignore  
Dont cry a little little cry a little little tonight  
  
Life is too short dont throw it away  
Hear what I say if youre lonely  
Stand up if you fall down  
Please look around youre not the only baby baby  
  
Life is just too short you cant run away  
Baby let me be your soul survivor  
Life is just to short baby everyday  
Baby I will lift you high and higher  
  
No where to go youre always in my heart I swear  
Baby I know if you need me Ill be there  
I will never ever leave you alone oh no  
And we have so many reasons to go oh no  
Dont cry a little little cry a little little tonight
