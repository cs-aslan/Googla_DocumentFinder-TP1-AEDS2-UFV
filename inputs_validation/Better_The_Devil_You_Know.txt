Better the devil you know  
Better the devil you know  
Woah Better the devil you know  
Better the devil you know  
Woah woah woah  
  
Say you wont leave me no more  
Ill take you back again  
No more excuses no no  
Cause Ive heard them all before  
A hundred times or more  
  
Chorus  
Ill forgive and forget  
If you say youll never go  
Cause its true what they say  
Its better the devil you know  
  
Woh woh woh  
Our love wasnt perfect I know  
I think I know the score  
If you say you love me oh boy  
I cant ask for more  
Ill come if you should call  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill be here every day  
Waiting for your love to show  
Yes its true what they say  
Its better the devil you know  
  
Woh woh woh  
Ill take you back Ill take you back again  
Ill take you back Ill take you back again  
  
Chorus until fade
