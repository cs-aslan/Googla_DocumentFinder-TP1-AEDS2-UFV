With a full of trash straight to the ocean  
All black Benz is slowly rolling  
Head lights off dont be the chosen  
Thinks its a game then drop the token  
Up shits creek without a paddle  
Thats just life Im in the saddle  
No rest no bitch we dont tattle  
Snakes dont always shake the rattle  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
All these cops they want the qouta  
Too much hypo coca cola  
Lucy smoke oh yeah you know her  
Shes that bitch who rest in nova  
Took that bite to bit the apple  
You know me Im hard to tackle  
Break me down homie you wish  
You couldnt catch that fish with golden tackle  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Give me give me till its empty  
Too much money isnt plenty  
Its not enough its not any  
Come come on just choose the jimmy  
They all want to bust a nut in  
Drop the bomb push the button  
Be the king be the sultan  
Some of this shit is so insulting  
Break the broken make the chosen  
Choose the loose then roll the tie get down and soak with  
Gas the gap and light the match and leave you smoking  
Choking on the fuse the latest news lifes a wicked  
Lifes a mystery and please dont be the witness  
To the sickness theyll just end it with it  
Something death and warm from the step of country fresh  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Country fresh  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Country fresh
