Jimmy can crack corn but I dont care  
My enemies crack corn but I dont care  
You can be black white or albino yeah  
You can have corn rows inside your hair  
I give a fuck if I dont like your stare  
This bottle of wine goes upside your head  
A little bit psycho but I know that  
Think we just dont say it then I wont say it  
See if you dont brag then I dont brag  
I know Im bad as long as I know Im bad  
I dont need yall to cosign no shit  
You can just keep makin them tired old threads  
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf yeah  
See me but dont dare to try no shit  
Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers  
A rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass  
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast  
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go bad  
From outta nowhere you might find your career  
Come to it and I was like Oh Yeah

Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but  
I done told you once Im not the kind of attention you want  
If I tell you twice then I wont be so nice  
If you keep comin back it only means you know you lost a fight  
They wanna talk shit let em talk shit cause they talk shit  
Knowin deep down they really just wanna squash it  
Cause no one wants to walk around steppin in dog shit  
And get doodoo on the shoe again soon as they washed it  
But the pride wont let em insides like Go get em  
And Im just like Why your tryin to fight momentum  
We just keep winnin by landslides oh and umm  
Shady Limiteds in any size yo denim  
To velour even our clothing lines on fire  
As 50 would say Our clothing lines on Fiyaa  
We aint wire your minds on us like mines on Mariah  
And yall is just like her youre all fucking liars  
But I just keep fucking you like I fucked her
