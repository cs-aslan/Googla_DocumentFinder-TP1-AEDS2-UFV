Theres a black wind blowing  
A typhoon on the rise  
Pummelin rain  
Murderous skies  
Im gonna take my books  
Im gonna wear my coat  
Im gonna find my scarf  
And wrap it around my throat  
And you can  
Come with me  
Through the drivin snow  
Were gonna ride on up to  
Medicine Bow  
Well I spent too long  
Just stuck on the shore  
Theres a man in my head  
But he isnt me any more  
Im gonna find me a ship  
Stowaway on a boat  
Im gonna burn all the words  
And letters and cards that I ever wrote  
And you can  
Sail with me  
Where the current flows  
Were gonna move on up to  
Medicine Bow  
Im gonna change my colors  
Cancel my things  
Stop my squawkin  
Grow some wings  
Well I will not sleep  
And I will not rest  
I will put my soul  
And my will to the test  
Im gonna tug at my tether  
Im gonna tear on my lead  
Im gonna test my knowledge  
In the field of deeds  
And you can  
Run with me  
Fast as we can go  
Over the hills to  
Medicine Bow
