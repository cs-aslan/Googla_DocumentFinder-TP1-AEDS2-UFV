Samson and Delilah they made it known that a man is weak  
For a womans thrown use your power like Delilah  
Even Samson couldnt deny Delilahs power  
You know god made man all muscles and strength  
But what he gave to woman no man can resist  
Use your power like Delilah even Samson couldnt deny  
Delilahs power yeah Im talking about  
  
Delilahs power I said Delilahs power  
Delilahs power Delilahs power use your powers like Delilah  
Even Samson couldnt deny Delilahs power  
King of the jungle the lion he roars but the lioness calmly  
Soothes his soul use your powers like Delilah  
Even Samson couldnt deny Delilahs power  
  
Delilahs power I said Delilahs power  
  
Think you can do without a woman well I dont think you can  
Cause in every land theres a woman for every man  
Use your powers like Delilah even Samson couldnt deny  
Delilahs power  
Delilahs power I said Delilahs power
