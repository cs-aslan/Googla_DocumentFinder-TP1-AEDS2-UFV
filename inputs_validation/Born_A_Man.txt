When I was just a little boy when I didnt know  
My daddy put me n his knee and showed me the way to go  
He said a woman will do her best to make a fool out of you  
So be a man and stand the test and see what you can do  
  
Im glad I am born a man  
Im glad I am born a man  
  
If you got what it takes my boy  
You can always choose  
Work it out before its too late my boy  
Make sure you never lose  
  
Im glad I am born a man  
Im glad I am born a man  
  
Born a man  
  
Every woman wants her man to live and learn on her land  
Where I go baby you go  
Arrangement man and wife  
  
Im glad I am born a man  
Im glad I am born a man  
  
Born a man
