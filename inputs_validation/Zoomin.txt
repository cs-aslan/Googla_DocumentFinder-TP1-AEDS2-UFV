Another mothers child  
Another mothers child lay dying  
Caught up in the games that people play  
You think guns are the only answer  
But words can have a stronger say  
I feel like zoomin  
I feel like zoomin baby  
Zoomin away from here now  
I I feel like zoomin oh yeah  
Zoomin away from here  
If a brother is really your brother  
Does is matter the colors that he wears  
But every brother is your brother  
Can you hear me  
But I dont think you really care  
I feel like zoomin  
Gotta change the way we think about it  
Zoomin away from here now  
I I feel like zoomin oh yeah  
Zoomin away from here  
One mothers love shot down in a minute  
But you know theres two mothers crying  
One son has paid the price lost his life  
Ones locked away but theyre both goin to stay  
Crazy love how long  
How long is this gonna go on  
Feel like zoomin  
Gotta find a better place right now  
Feel like zoomin  
Gotta go on up a little higher  
Theres so much trouble going on all around us  
Weve got to find a better way of thinking  
Zoomin is just a change in space to a place  
Thats in your mind and its not hard to find  
And its not hard to find  
I feel like zoomin oh yeah  
Zoomin away from here  
Let me tell you  
Do you want a better place  
Dont you want a better space  
Lets go zoomin  
You know its never hard to find  
Its just inside your mind  
Lets go zoomin oh yeah  
I feel like zoomin  
Feel like zoomin baby  
Zoomin yeah  
Zoomin away from here now  
I I feel like zoomin oh yeah  
Zoomin away from here  
Do you want a better place  
Dont you want a better space  
Lets go zoomin  
You know its never hard to find  
Its just inside your mind  
Lets go zoomin oh yeah
