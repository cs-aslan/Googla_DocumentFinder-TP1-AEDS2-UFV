Fabolous  
It goes however I wanted to  
These bitches never say cant  
I just call it angel she look like heaven in pants  
Big house couple rides  
Call that shit Neverland Ranch  
Tre Pounds shoot fast call that shit Kevin Durant  
You nggers beneath me  
Now go get fcking stomped son  
No I run this city I am Brooklyns Nucky Thompson  
If they make me go in  
Ima go right away  
Mny fly ass cant be stopped no flight delay  
Gotta a crew of bad bitches  
Call em the nice girls  
Yo btches look scary  
But she aint no spice girl  
Its 9am when you clock youre an office worker  
Its big Bens in my pocket Im a rothsberger  
Coconut ciroc and pineapple easy order  
Now I got this chick showing me what Yeezy taught her Amber Rose  
Welcome to the funeral pay respect  
Me and your girl unibrow may connect wait a sec  
Let it breath  
  
Ha ha ha ha ha  
  
Its goes getting more money  
They come with more problems  
I used to be Macing but now Im Steve Jobbin man  
See you got 2 choices  
You can stay broke or grind  
Life is a bitch and Im just tryna Oprah mine  
Gettin more money it comes with more problems  
Man used to be Macing but now Im Steve Jobbinman  
Got 2 choices  
You can stay broke or grind  
Life is a bitch and Im just tryna Oprah mine

Always been a squeezer Ive been on the hollow nggas  
Alwyas been a leader no twitter I dont follow nggas  
Fck glass drink Rose out the bottle ngga  
I promised to keep it 1000 you know my motto ngga  
Dont just talk it be about it  
You talk it but we about it  
We do it you read about it  
Leave em dont speak about it  
We live it you dream about it  
How could you even doubt it  
Couldnt get a quarter round here  
Unless we allowed it  
This is our city our town our turf  
We eatin and yall thirst  
Do shoot back bomb first  
Get em gone first  
Let em fire arms burst  
Regardless of size or status  
Stuff em in that long hearse  
I think Im Malcolm X Huey Newton  
Marcus Garvey Im surrounded by my army damn  
Damn ngga try and harm me  
Fck what a hater think  
How could nggas try to rob me  
If Im out in Abu Dhabi ferraris and Maseratis  
Fleets pulling up in Nobus and Ciprianis  
Or that F1 race track good look tryna find me  
Wherever Im at Im smoking some Bob Marley  
7 star hotels you can see the ocean from the lobby  
Riding in the goose riding to the Goose  
Believe the great deal with stress  
Ive been through the most  
Changed my whole way of thinking got a new approach  
Fly private if it aint first class Im through with coach  
Street fam for life this we all owe the los  
Whole gang bottles in the air  
I propose a toast  
We dun seen the World  
Partied with emirates  
We all come from nothing always remember that  
So you should be thankful everytimeyou spend a stack  
For the all classy restaurants we ate dinners ate  
All the cars audemars with the different straps  
But always strive for more never be content with that  
No beginner rap no number 1 contender jack
