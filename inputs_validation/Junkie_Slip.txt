I wasnt going that far  
The junkie slip  
I said I wasnt doin it  
The junkie slip  
Yea thought Id find a rhythm in the junkie town  
Thought Id find a rhythm when the junkies hang around  
  
Thought Id go out walking to the junkie kind of beat  
Setting on those bars that the junkies meet  
The junkie slip  
Nail it down  
The junkie slip  
This side of town  
The junkie slip  
And whatcha knowing before yous a doin  
The things theys aknowing  
You pawn your coat and your car  
Pawned your cigar and your old guitar  
You pawned your guitar and your saxophone  
Youre pawning everything in your mothers home  
  
cause its a junkie slip  
Just like rock n roll  
A junkie slip  
Like Johnny did the stroll  
And you know it feels alright  
But whats that feeling on a Saturday night  
  
Youre itching itching itching in your pillow in the day  
Youre itching itching itching and you gave your coat away  
Itching itching itching and then in your sleeping bag  
Theres a little packet that you thought you never had  
  
Its a junkie slip  
Every night  
Junkie slip  
Cold water fright  
Its a junkie slip  
And an old spoon cooky cooky cooky kooky afternoon  
All afternoon and in the middle of the night  
  
Youre worse for the difference and it dont sleep tight  
Dont pull the curtains font put on the light  
Seeseeseecause its a junkie slip  
Whats goin on  
Was early night  
I lit the fire  
Finish alright  
Yeh EdiEdiEdiYeh EdiJuan  
Him going to live with Indian  
Come in the car its an old machine  
Riding from Brookway on a magazine  
Be on that corner with a magazine  
  
Do ya do ya do ya follow your friends  
Do I hear you saying that youre going back again  
Its a junkie slip  
Where Did it end  
But did it ah did it did it ever end  
When did it ever end  
Dont ask me when on a Wednesday night  
Dont ask me when on a Thursday night  
I said oh Who the hell are you  
You said oh Well you met me  
I said I can guess why
