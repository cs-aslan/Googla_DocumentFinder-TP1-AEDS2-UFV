I was about to write a song about the fear and the doubt  
But my pen ran out  
It captured the emotions of a lover and a lout  
But my pen ran out  
So the picture wasnt painted and the story wasnt told  
No one knows the author cause the record never sold  
And I know they never will until hes bitter and hes old  
His time ran out  
  
I was gonna share my blues with a nation full of blues  
But my pen ran out  
I was gonna spread the news of the way I always lose  
But my pen ran out  
So Ill keep an envelope with all the words I should have said  
Hide it in a tiny box underneath my bed  
And written on the outside will be open when hes dead  
And written on the outside will be open when hes dead  
  
His time ran out his time ran out  
His time ran out his time ran out
