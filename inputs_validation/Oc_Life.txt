So I want to be a member and I want to be a name  
And I want to be a local face and play the social game  
Dancing through a time warp in your dinosaur trends  
The limit of your mind is what theyre counting on all ends  
Listen to the media present it as a fact  
Fall in your orders cause you dont know how to act  
Travel on estranged cause you dont know your own way  
Theyll get you in the end then youll pay  
cause OC life is not the life for me  
Stupid little chicks and egotistic boys  
OC life is not the life so free  
Pressures on my back  
and artificial joys    for you girls and boys  
want to be a member want to have some fame  
Fighting to stay ahead a part of the game  
Combat authority but dont get out of line  
Or theyll put you in the slammer youll be doing some time  
714 tattooed on my head  
I find myself labeled that Im a victim instead  
I fight all the rules I dont see the way  
Id rather be dead then pay the price that they say  
cause OC life is not the life for me  
Stupid little girls And egotistic boys  
OC life is not the life for free  
Pressures on my back  
and artificial joys    for you girls and boys  
Put the plastic back in the machine
