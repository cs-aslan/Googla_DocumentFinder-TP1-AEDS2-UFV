Know what shes done to me and I have been around  
She sure can bring you pleasure and she can bring you down  
I should not tell you if you want to learn  
To take a tip from me now dont turn your back on her  
  
When shes promising you pleasure all night long  
She may turn around and cut you to the bone  
  
Chorus  
In a private room shell dance for you  
In a private room with just her high heel shoes  
In a private room shell take your heart  
And with you under her control she will leave you all alone all alone  
  
I was a midnight runner on her side of town  
I used to get there early to watch her dance around  
She had this way of movin to tantalize a crowd  
When she lays eyes on you youd better watch out  
  
While shes promising you pleasure all night long  
She may turn around and cut you to the bone  
  
In a private room shell dance for you  
In a private room with just her high heel shoes  
In a private room shell take your heart  
And when youre under her control she will leave you all alone all alone  
  
Shes no angel  
  
Late at night she might get lonely I know what she really needs  
Someone who can hold her all night long all night long in a private room  
  
In a private room shell dance for you oh yeah  
In a private room with just her high heel shoes not too much more  
In a private room  
  
In a private room shell dance shell dance dance for you  
  
Oh
