Im sitting down by the highway  
Down by that highway side  
Everybodys going somewhere  
Riding just as fast as they can ride  
I guess theyve got a lot to do  
Before they can rest assured  
Their lives are justified  
Pray to God for me baby  
He can let me slide  
  
Cause Ive been up and down this highway  
Far as my eyes can see  
No matter how fast I run  
I can never seem to get away from me  
No matter where I am  
I cant help feeling Im just a day away  
From where I want to be  
Now Im running home baby  
Like a river to the sea  
  
Baby if you can see me  
Out across this wilderness  
Theres just one thing  
I was hoping you might guess  
Baby you can free me  
All in the power of your sweet tenderness  
  
I can see it in your eyes  
Youve got those bright baby blues  
You dont see what youve got to gain  
But you dont like to lose  
You watch yourself from the sidelines  
Like your life is a game you dont mind playing  
To keep yourself amused  
I dont mean to be cruel baby  
But youre looking confused  
  
Baby if you can hear me  
Turn down your radio  
Theres just one thing  
I want you to know  
When youve been near me  
Ive felt the love stirring in my soul  
  
Its so hard to come by  
That feeling of peace  
This friend of mine said  
Close your eyes and try a few of these  
I thought I flying like a bird  
So far above my sorrow  
But when I looked down  
I was standing on my knees  
Now I need someone to help me  
Someone to help me please  
  
Baby if you need me  
Like I know I need you  
Theres just one thing  
Ill ask you to do  
Take my hand and lead me  
To the hole in your garden wall  
And pull me through
