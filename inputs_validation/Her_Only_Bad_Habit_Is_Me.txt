Shes an angel and I aint  
Lord knows she deserves a saint  
And it dont take a genius to see  
Her only bad habit is me  
  
Why she loves me I dont know  
I can sure be a hard way to go  
But Im right here where she wants me to be  
Her only bad habit is me  
  
Most of the time Im walking the line  
But sometimes I get out of hand  
My baby scolds me and later on she holds me  
She loves me and she understands  
Shes perfection shes a ten  
My baby never looks at other men  
She has just one weakness I see  
Her only bad habit is me

She has just one weakness I see  
Her only bad habit is me  
  
Her only bad habit is me
