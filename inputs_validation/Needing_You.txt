Needing you wanting you  
I just dont know what Im gonna do  
To tell the truth it just aint no use  
My mind aint strong enough  
To forget about you oh baby hey  
Here I am trying to be proud  
Trying to fool myself with this unreal smile  
Telling everyone that I no longer cling to you  
But I know myself that cant be true  
Oh how can I forget a love Ive known for so long  
The heart may not remember but the mind goes on and on  
And the more I think about it the worse off I get  
Something keeps telling me  
You aint seen nothing yet  
Im needing you wanting you  
I just dont know what Im gonna do  
Now that youre gone how can I go on  
The same love that made me smile  
Right now it makes me blue  
Oh how can I get you back I need you here so bad  
The neighbors say since youve been away  
I seem to be so sad you know theyre right  
I cant stand to be out of your site  
You need to be here close to me to lift these lonely nights  
Im needing you wanting you  
Oh I just dont know what Im gonna do ooh no  
To tell the truth it just aint no use  
My mind aint strong enough to forget about you  
Baby baby Im sure needing you  
Yes Im wanting you you know I just cant stand it  
It just aint no use aint no use
