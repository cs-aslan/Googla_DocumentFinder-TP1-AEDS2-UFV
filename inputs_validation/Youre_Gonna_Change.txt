You wore out a brand new trunk  
Packin and unpackin all of your junk  
Your daddys mad done got peeved  
Youre gonna change or Im gonna leave  
This aint right and that is wrong  
Just keep naggin me all the day long  
Its gotta stop I dont mean please  
Youre gonna change or Im gonna leave  
Youre gonna change your way of livin  
Change the things you do  
Stop doin all the things that you oughten too  
Your daddys gone mad hes done got peeved  
Youre gonna change or youre gonna have to leave  
Every time you get mad  
You pack your rags and go back to dad  
Tell him lies he dont believe  
Youre gonna change or Im agonna leave  
Only way to keep a woman happy  
Make her do whats right  
Love her every mornin bawl her every night  
Your daddys mad hes done got peeved  
Youre gonna change or Im gonna leave
