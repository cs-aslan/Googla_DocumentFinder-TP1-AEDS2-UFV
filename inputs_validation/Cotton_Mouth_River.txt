Well I know that I shouldnt have done it  
I know that it just wasnt right  
Cause they got me back up to the Cotton Mouth River  
And I cant cross late at night  
  
I hear theres lots of stories told about the Cotton Mouth River  
They tell them time and again  
About the men who tried to cross that river by moonlight  
And never were heard from again  
  
If I had my live to live over  
Id have gone to work that day  
Instead of going into town and shooting him down  
For a thing I never heard him say  
  
I hear theres lots of stories told about the Cotton Mouth River  
They tell them time and again  
About the men who tried to cross that river by moonlight  
And never was heard from again  
  
Well I just made it through the cane break  
And I got one foot in the mud  
I can hear the hounds obeying but the snake around my ankles  
Telling me my running days are done  
  
I hear theres lots of stories told about the Cotton Mouth River  
They tell them time and again  
About the men who tried to cross that river by moonlight  
And never were heard from again  
  
I hear theres lots of stories told about the Cotton Mouth River  
They tell them time and again  
About the men who tried to cross that river by moonlight  
And never were heard from again
