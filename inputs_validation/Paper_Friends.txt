They sent you down a paper friend I hear  
You went back on all the vows you once held dear  
There you stretched so calm and quiet  
And things looked good now dont deny it  
You walked on air for fifteen minutes  
And after that there was nothing in it  
You dont need those paper friends at all  
No you dont need those kind of friends  
  
You say youve lost your sense of time again  
Well youve been using that excuse since who knows when  
You went the way of all young rebels  
Ignore the gods embrace the devils  
But theyre no good for you in your state  
So why not drive them right out of your gates  
Cause you dont need those paper friends at all  
You dont need those type of friends  
  
No one knows what youre feeling  
And life goes on in its own sweet time  
Your passions flame for no reason  
You haunt the city for something that shines  
Even one thing to rhyme  
  
And if I meet you on the rounds today  
I hope you wont turn on your heel or walk away  
Yes I know it takes so much effort  
But facing up can be so much better  
So what if dreams they all come to nothing  
Just blow your nose and keep on looking  
Cause you dont need those paper friends at all  
You dont need those kind of friends  
  
You dont need those paper friends at all  
You dont need those paper friends
