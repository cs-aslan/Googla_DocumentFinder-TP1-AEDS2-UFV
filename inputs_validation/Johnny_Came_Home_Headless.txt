Oh Johnny was a tall man but his memory was short  
Hed forget to duck at doorways and often hed get hurt  
I took good care of him for he had no family  
Actually he did but he forgot who they be  
Johnny often liked to go out on the town  
Hed forget where hed be going so hed just wander around  
I knew when he was back for I would hear the smack  
Of his head hitting the doorway but tonight it was alack  
Johnny came home headless it was a great disgrace  
But wherever its alying theres a smile upon his face  
I should have seen it coming he finally lost his mind  
But if his head dont turn up soon then all his hats are mine  
Johnny came towards me but suddenly he stopped  
As if trying to think of something but having no luck  
Still he didnt notice that his head werent there  
Til he took out a brush and tried to comb his hair  
I said Johnny wheres your cranium but he didnt seem to know  
He just shrugged his shoulders and tried to find his nose  
And the sight of him there topless made me start to cry  
For I feared wed neer again see eye to eye  
Johnny came home headless it was a great disgrace  
But wherever its alying theres a smile upon his face  
I should have seen it coming he should have stayed in bed  
For now I fear hell spend his life just trying to get ahead  
Refusing to believe that he had split for good  
His lower half and me searched the neighbourhood  
It soon became apparent that his head we wouldnt find it  
He could not retrace his steps he was absent minded  
Well years went by til late one night I heard a voice I swore  
Was Johnny calling out to me I flung open the door  
Johnnys head was home it took a taxi cab  
Alas it was too late his body had gone bad  
Johnnys head was homeless his body was cremated  
And the funeral was harder than he had anticipated  
I should of seen it coming he said in his eulogy  
But never thought Id have to say I aint got nobody  
I aint got nobody  
Johnny came home headless it was a great disgrace  
But now his heads upon a shelf a smile upon his face  
But now his heads upon a shelf a smile upon his face
