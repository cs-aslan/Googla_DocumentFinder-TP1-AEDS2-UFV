One more time  
I have crossed the line  
Now you wont be mine  
Anymore  
  
One more dream  
Vanished up in smoke  
Now I have no hope  
Anymore  
  
Let it go  
The damage in your heart  
Let it go  
The damage in your heart  
I cant tell you how you want to make me feel  
I cant tell you how you want to make me feel  
  
One more tear  
Falling down your face  
Doesnt need that much to the world  
  
One more loss  
In a losing life  
Doesnt hurt so bad  
Anymore  
  
Let it go  
The damage in your heart  
Let it go  
The damage in your heart  
I cant tell you how you want to make me feel  
I cant tell you how you want to make me feel  
  
One more tear  
Falling down your face  
Doesnt mean that much  
To the world  
  
Let it go  
The damage in your heart  
Let it go  
The damage in your heart  
I cant tell you how you want to make me feel  
I cant tell you how you want to make me feel  
I cant tell you  
I cant tell you  
I cant tell you  
How you want to make me feel
