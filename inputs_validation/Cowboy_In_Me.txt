I dont know why I act the way I do  
Like I aint got a single thing to lose  
Sometimes Im my own worst enemy  
I guess thats just the cowboy in me  
  
I got a life that most would love to have  
But sometimes I still wake up fightin mad  
At where this road Im heading down might lead  
I guess thats just the cowboy in me  
  
The urge to run the restlessness  
The heart of stone I sometimes get  
The things Ive done for foolish pride  
The me thats never satisfied  
The face thats in the mirror when I dont like what I see  
I guess thats just the cowboy in me  
  
The urge to run the restlessness  
The heart of stone I sometimes get  
The things Ive done for foolish pride  
The me thats never satisfied  
The face thats in the mirror when I dont like what I see  
I guess thats just the cowboy in me  
  
Girl I know theres times you must have thought  
There aint a line youve drawn I havent crossed  
But you set your mind to see this love on through  
I guess thats just the cowboy in you  
  
We ride and never worry about the fall  
I guess thats just the cowboy in us all
