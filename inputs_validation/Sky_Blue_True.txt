If you ever worry will I be true  
Dont you worry Ill be true  
And Ill be true sky blue true  
Ill be true sky blue true  
As blue as the skies as blue as your eyes  
As bright as the sun as sweet as you hon  
Ill be true sky blue true  
If you ever wonder do I love you  
Dont you wonder I love you  
And Ill be true sky blue true  
Ill be true sky blue true  
As blue as the skies as blue as your eyes  
As bright as the sun as sweet as you hon  
Ill be true sky blue true  
And when the sun sets over our lives  
Well be together beyond the skies  
And Ill be true eternally true  
Ill be true sky blue true
