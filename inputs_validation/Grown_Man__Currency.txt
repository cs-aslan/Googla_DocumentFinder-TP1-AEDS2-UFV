Lil Wayne  
Chea whats up baby  
I aint tryin to do nothin but get my grown man on  
I aint tryin to hurt you only if you want me to ha  
Yea somethin like that  
  
Yea wats happenin baby Im lil wayne from new orleans  
Fresh out the navy now the captain of my own team  
Hop in this machine  
Banish from the scene  
God damnit Im so manish  
Handle it like a standard  
So put ur panties and ur pants by the trashcan  
Romance on the floor plans  
Yea we hold hands while we rollin  
Jus tryin to keep up with the program  
Jus tryin to sneak up on ya  
Like how you doin mam  
Im a old soul in a young man  
We got to it and we didnt stop till the birds hit the block  
And she aint neva had it like that  
  
Chorus  
Girl you are so fine  
I wish that I could get you over here girl tonight  
So I can get my grown man on with you  
You dont kno about it Im on my grown man 4x  
  
Currency  
Now I dont really hit the club  
But tonight Ill make an exception  
For some reason I cant seem to keep my eyes out your direction  
Im lookin at you so hard I could probably catch a charge  
Feelin the way you walk when you move your booty applause damn  
I gotta keep my composure  
Gotta attack my mission handle business like a soldier  
Young man young money with the money long  
Currency tha hot spitta it so grown  
And ur perception of me is so wrong  
Dont worry bout what you heard bout me and them other birds  
Mighta dun a lil dirt and left a few of em hurt  
But whateva has occured they all got what they deserved  
And you dont rock like them I can see it in your eyes  
If you aint good for me then you wearin a disguise  
cause tonight you lookin like ms right  
And I swore to be a player for life but Ill change for you  
  
Chorus  
  
Lil wayne  
You aint a woman you a baby girl livin in a ladys world  
And Im a grown man the women understand  
See what I go thru is what I owe you  
So you should throw that ass back to me right now  
Yeah fly boy baby sit back relaxin  
Cruise wit a nigga destination satisfaction  
Now whos is it baby she say weezy fuckin baby  
I said yes it fuckin did  
She said dont you ever leave  
I say I say but I got money on my mind  
Then I tell her nevermind and we do it one more time  
Yeah for a large amount of time  
Long it wont stop till daytime come home  
  
Chorus  
  
Damn look that oh that right there  
Thats the sunset girl get ur visor  
Wheres those chanel shades I get you  
You always losin things  
And Im always buyin new things  
I come a long way you remember  
Remember that block  
Look at you you think you all grown  
  
You aint a woman you a baby girl livin in a ladys world  
And Im a grown man the women understand  
See what I go thru is what I owe you  
And you should throw that ass back to me right now
