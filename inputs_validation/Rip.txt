Ill get down on my knees  
Ill do anything I can  
Ill even walk upon water  
Ill burn the soul of a man  
Im so sick with pain  
Im so sick with need  
Ill lay before the cross and pray  
Ive done nothing to you  
Ill bleed like holy rain  
Ill say Im searching for the truth  
Ill rip the skin from Gods face  
If it can guide me to you  
Ill give life to disease  
Ill steal the light from Heavens gate  
Ill give life to obsession  
And then Ill do as I please  
Ill give you one last sin or cure  
Ive got something for you
