Yeah yeah yeah hey  
  
So so you made a lot of mistakes  
Walked down the road a little sideways  
Cracked a rib when you hit the wall  
Yeah youve had a pocket full of regrets  
Pull you down faster than a sunset  
Hey it happens to us all  
  
When the cold hard rain just wont quit  
And you cant see your way out of it  
  
Chorus  
You find your faith has been lost and shaken  
You take back whats been taken  
Get on your knees and dig down deep  
You can do what you think is impossible  
Keep on believing dont give in  
Itll come and make you whole again  
It always will it always does  
Love is unstoppable  
  
Love it can wear the ring of stone  
Bring you back to being born again  
oh its a helping hand when you need it most  
A lighthouse shining on the coast  
That never goes dim  
  
When your heart is full of doubt  
And you think that theres no way out  
  
Chorus  
  
Like a river keeps on rolling  
Like the north wind blowing  
Dont it feel good knowing yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Love is unstoppable  
So you made a lot of mistakes  
Walked down the road a little sideways  
Love love is unstoppable
