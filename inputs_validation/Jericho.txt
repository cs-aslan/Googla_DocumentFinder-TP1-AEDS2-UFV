Well Im standin on top of the mountain  
Just about a mile from Jericho  
And my throat is hot and dusty  
Down to the water I must go  
Catherine the Great and brave Ulysses  
Playin checkers out in the sun  
Jesse James and young William Bonnie  
Have started a religion for everyone  
Well Im standin on top of the mountain  
Just about a mile from Jericho  
And my throat is hot and dusty  
Down to the water I must go  
Well the drums they are loud down in rap town  
But the Pope has been quiet for days  
Well some gunmen robbed a bank in California  
And the cops blew them all away  
If you dont like the picture dont turn it off  
The only way to change it is to do it yourself  
Well Im standin on top of the mountain  
Just about a mile from Jericho  
And my throat is hot and dusty  
Down to the water I must go  
Peace and love on the wings of a dove  
Has flown away  
Were payin the rent  
On the blood thats been spent  
On a mortgage thats too high to be paid  
Well Im standin on top of the mountain  
Just about a mile from Jericho  
And my throat is hot and dusty  
Down to the water I must go  
Well Im standin on top of the mountain  
Just about a mile from Jericho  
And my throat is hot and dusty  
Down to the water I must go
