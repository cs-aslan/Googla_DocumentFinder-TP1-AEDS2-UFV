Hey clowns have you dug the latest jive on the south side  
No man  
Well they got him  
They got who  
You know that man thats been cooking up that jive  
Selling it to these folks round town  
Makin em have them funny dreams  
You mean the hoodoo man  
Yeah  
Oh no that cat thought he was just too grand  
Well gay somebody done hoodood the hoodoo man  
Smack me down with the story gay  
  
Ol Joe Hannah from Louisiana  
A hoodoo king in every manner  
But I found out with out a doubt  
The tables had turned on him  
  
He aint got a tooth in his head  
Poor Ol Joe is almost dead  
Somebody done hoodood the hoodoo man  
  
10 10 double 10 45 15  
Joe cant drink no gin  
Aint nothing go over the devils back  
That dont buckle under his chin  
  
His face looks just like gravel sand  
And everybodys got Joe on the pan  
Somebody done hoodood the hoodoo man  
  
Somebody done cooked up some stuff in a pot  
Not too cold and not to hot  
They dropped a few drops in Joes beef stew  
Now hes blowing his top he dont know what to do  
  
They dont know who did it  
They cant find out  
But hes done hoodood his last hoodoo without a doubt  
  
Somebody done hoodood  
Done hoodood the hoodoo man
