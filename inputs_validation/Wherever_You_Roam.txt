I could say you never need to doubt  
Lie and say you only need to shout  
But life can chew you up and spit you out  
Life can chew you up and spit you out  
  
And Im not going to be there  
And you wont always take care  
But my love goes with you  
Wherever you roam  
  
I picture you all around ten  
But now youve grown to women and to men  
Things will never be the same again  
Things can never be the same again  
  
And Im not going to be there  
And you wont always take care  
But my love goes with you  
Wherever you roam  
No matter where you are in the world  
Youre still my boys and youre still my girls  
And my love goes with you  
Wherever you roam  
  
Ooh ooh sometimes this lifes unkind  
Ooh ooh sometimes this lifes unkind  
It can take your mind  
Take your mind and itll test you  
Again again again again again  
Again again again again  
  
And Im not going to be there  
And you wont always take care  
But my love goes with you  
Wherever you roam  
No matter where you are in the world  
Youre still my boys and youre still my girls  
And my love goes with you  
Wherever you roam  
Wherever you roam
