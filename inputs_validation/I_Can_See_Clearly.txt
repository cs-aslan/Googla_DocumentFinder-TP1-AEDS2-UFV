Bob Marley  I Can See Clearly Now  
  
I can see clearly now the rain is gone  
I can see all obstacles in my way  
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind  
Its gonna be a bright bright bright bright  
SunShiny day  
Its gonna be a bright bright bright bright  
SunShiny day  
  
Oh yes I can make it now the pain is gone  
All of the bad feelings have disappeared  
Here is the rainbow Ive been prayin for  
Its gonna be a bright bright bright bright  
SunShiny day  
  
Look all around theres nothin but blue skies  
Look straight ahead theres nothin but blue skies  
  
I can see clearly now the rain is gone  
I can see all obstacles in my way  
Here is the rainbow Ive been prayin for  
Its gonna be a bright bright bright bright  
SunShiny day  
Its gonna be a bright bright bright bright  
SunShiny day  
Bright bright bright bright  
SunShiny day  
Its gonna be a bright bright bright bright  
SunShiny day  
Its gonna be a bright bright bright bright  
SunShiny day
