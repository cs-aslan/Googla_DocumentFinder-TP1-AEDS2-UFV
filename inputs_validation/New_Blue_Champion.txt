I hear the sound of a brand new song  
I dont want to hear your reasons  
Because I know whats right  
I know whats wrong  
  
I can see the light above me  
I hear the sound of a brand new day  
Im not going to settle for less  
And I dont think things are ever going to change  
  
I just want it all to go away  
  
I dont want to hear about your damage  
I dont want to hear you say  
That you think Im damaged too  
Because I know you know that the damage in me  
Is from the horrible things  
You say and do  
I know that the damage in me  
Comes from the damage in you  
  
I just want it all  
To go away

I hear the sound of a brand new song  
I dont want to hear your reasons  
Because I know whats right  
I know whats wrong  
  
I can see the light above me  
I hear the sound of a brand new day

And I dont understand why you just do not realize  
  
I dont want to hear you say youre sorry  
I dont want to hear you say we can start all over again

And I dont want to know your reasons  
Because I know whats right  
I know whats wrong  
  
I can see the light above me  
I hear the sound of a brand new day  
I can picture our lives without you  
And I dont think things are ever going to change  
  
I just want it all to go away  
  
I can see the light above me  
Hear the sound of a brand new song  
I dont want to know your reasons  
Because I know whats right
