Its a gone dead train  
Yes its a gone dead train  
  
My engine was pumpin steam  
And I was grindin at you hard and fast  
Burnin down the rails tryin to heat the way  
Haulin ass and ridin up the track  
And I laughed at the conductor who was tellin me my coal  
It would never last  
  
But then the fire in my boiler  
Up and quit before I came  
Aint no empty cellar  
Like a gone dead train  
  
Once was at a time when I could  
Mama shave em dry  
And raise a fever icedown chill  
Waitin at the station  
With a heavy loaded sack  
Savin up and holdin just to spill  
Shootin my supply through my demons eye  
Instead of holdin my time I hope I will  
  
But then the fire in my boiler  
Up and quit before I came  
There aint no empty cellar  
Needs a gone dead train  
  
Yes its a gone dead train  
Im gonna teach it to learn now now  
Its a gone dead train  
Yes its a gone dead train  
Im gonna teach it to learn now now  
Its a gone dead train  
Gonna teach it gonna teach it to learn  
  
There aint no easy day  
When your daily runs a downhill pull  
And there aint no easy way  
Wishin for some jelly roll  
There aint no switch been made  
To make your juicy lemon find  
A spring to run a dry well full  
  
But then the fire in my boiler  
Up and quit before I came  
Aint no empty cellar  
Needs a gone dead train  
  
Yes its a gone dead train  
Im gonna teach it to learn  
You know its a gone dead train  
Gonna teach it gonna teach it to burn  
Its a gone dead train  
Its a gone dead train you gotta learn  
Its a gone dead train  
Gonna teach it gonna teach it gonna teach it to burn
