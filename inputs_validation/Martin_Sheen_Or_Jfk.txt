Here it is  
One more glass for these broken hands  
Goes down for you  
Im falling in  
I sink then swallow  
I never meant  
To see this through  
  
Chorus  
Im taking them all  
Taking them all back for good  
To a place where I know that Im safe  
Then I can fall  
Then I could fall where I should  
In this bottle with all my mistakes  
  
All the days  
Since Ive landed  
Ive lost the way  
To find my truth  
You float away  
And leave me stranded  
Whats left to say  
Ill hurt for you  
  
Chorus  
  
I could sleep  
But when I wake here  
Youll still be gone  
And youre my air  
I could breathe  
If you would stay here  
Another song  
So I could stare  
  
I could sleep  
But when I wake here  
Youll still be gone  
And youre my air  
I could breathe  
If you would stay here  
Another song  
So I could stare  
  
Chorus
