I want you here with Me  
But youve been keeping other company  
You cant sit still its plain to see  
You love the world and youre avoiding Me  
  
You love the world avoiding Me  
  
My Word sits there upon your desk  
But you love your books and magazines the best  
You prefer the light of your TV  
You love the world and youre avoiding Me  
  
You used to pray you were so brave  
Now you cant keep even one appointment weve made  
Oh I gave My blood to save your life  
Tell Me tell Me is it right Tell Me  
Will you leave Me here alone again tonight  
  
Well I love you still more and more  
But youre fighting everything Im working for  
Youre acting like My enemy  
You love the world and youre avoiding Me  
  
You love the world you know you love the world  
You love the world avoiding Me  
  
These other loves theyre hurting you  
If you end up losing Me then what will you do  
Oh I gave My blood to save your life  
Tell Me tell Me is it right Tell Me  
Will you leave Me here alone again tonight  
  
Well I want you here with Me  
But youve been keeping other company  
And you prefer the light of your TV  
You love the world and youre avoiding Me  
  
You love the world you love the world  
You love the world and youre avoiding Me  
You love the world  
You love the world youre avoiding Me
