Verse 1  
Im lyin here on the floor where you left me  
I think I took too much  
Im crying here what have you done  
I thought it would be fun  
  
PreChorus  
I cant stay on your life support  
Theres a shortage in the switch  
I cant stay on your morphine  
Cause its making me itch  
I said I tried to call the nurse again  
But shes being a little bitch  
I think Ill get outta here where I can  
  
Chorus  
Run just as fast as I can  
To the middle of nowhere  
To the middle of my frustrated fears  
And I swear youre just like a pill  
Instead of makin me better  
You keep makin me ill  
You keep makin me ill  
  
Verse 2  
I havent moved from the spot where you left me  
This must be a bad trip  
All of the other pills they were different  
Maybe I should get some help  
  
PreChorus  
I cant stay on your life support  
Theres a shortage in the switch  
I cant stay on your morphine  
Cause its making me itch  
I said I tried to call the nurse again  
But shes being a little bitch  
I think Ill get outta here where I can  
  
Chorus  
Run just as fast as I can  
To the middle of nowhere  
To the middle of my frustrated fears  
And I swear youre just like a pill  
Instead of makin me better  
You keep makin me ill  
You keep makin me ill  
Run just as fast as I can  
To the middle of nowhere  
To the middle of my frustrated fears  
And I swear youre just like a pill  
Instead of makin me better  
You keep makin me ill  
You keep makin me ill  
  
Bridge  
I cant stay on your life support  
Theres a shortage in the switch  
I cant stay on your morphine  
Cause its making me itch  
I said I tried to call the nurse again  
But shes being a little bitch  
I think Ill get outta here where I can  
  
Chorus  
Run just as fast as I can  
To the middle of nowhere  
To the middle of my frustrated fears  
And I swear youre just like a pill  
Instead of makin me better  
You keep makin me ill  
You keep makin me ill  
  
Run just as fast as I can  
To the middle of nowhere  
To the middle of my frustrated fears  
And I swear youre just like a pill  
Instead of makin me better  
You keep makin me ill  
You keep makin me ill  
  
Run just as fast as I can  
To the middle of nowhere  
To the middle of my frustrated fears  
And I swear youre just like a pill  
Instead of makin me better  
You keep makin me ill  
You keep makin me ill
