What Ive got youve got to give it to your mama  
What Ive got youve got to give it to your pappa  
What Ive got youve got to give it to your daughter  
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water  
  
What Ive got youve got to get it put it in you  
What Ive got youve got to get it put it in you  
What Ive got youve got to get it put it in you  
Reeling with the feeling dont stop continue  
  
Realize I dont want to be a miser  
Confide with sly youll be the wiser  
Young blood is the lovin upriser  
How come everybody want to keep it like the kaiser  
  
Chorus  
Give it away give it away give it away now  
Give it away give it away give it away now  
Give it away give it away give it away now  
  
I cant tell if Im a kingpin or a pauper  
Greedy little people in a sea of distress  
Keep your more to receive your less  
Unimpressed by material excess  
Love is free love me say hell yes  
  
Im a low brow but I rock a little know how  
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow  
Get smart get down with the pow wow  
Never been a better time than right now  
  
Bob Marley poet and a prophet  
Bob Marley taught me how to off it  
Bob Marley walkin like he talk it  
Goodness me cant you see Im gonna cough it  
  
Chorus  
  
Lucky me swimmin in my ability  
Dancin down on life with agility  
Come and drink it up from my fertility  
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility  
  
My mom I love her cause she love me  
Long gone are the times when she scrub me  
Feelin good my brother gonna hug me  
Drink my juice young love chugalug me  
  
Theres a river born to be a giver  
Keep you warm wont let you shiver  
His heart is never gonna wither  
Come on everybody time to deliver  
  
Chorus  
  
What Ive got youve got to give it to your mama  
What Ive got youve got to give it to your pappa  
What Ive got youve got to give it to your daughter  
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
