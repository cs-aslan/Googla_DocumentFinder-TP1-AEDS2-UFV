Remember back when I was born  
High up in the sky  
Looking down upon the scene  
I cant recall just why  
A white love light come up to me  
I followed it back down  
Sayin this is the tune of the Earth my friends  
When I want to be around  
  
I want to be around  
When the stars fall on the ground  
Walking hand in hand with every man  
Sleeping in the sun with everyone  
  
Abraham come in one more time  
It must have been in LA  
He just said Joe wont you stay  
All right okay he said to me  
I got nothing else to do  
So Abe walked in hes back again  
Until his life is through  
  
Hes going to be around  
While a whole new world goes down  
Walking hand in hand with every man  
Sleeping in the sun with everyone  
  
Every night by morning light  
I look up on the hill  
Digging all the cosmic sights  
And I recognize its Will  
I said Oh well its getting time  
Im beginning to feel my load  
  
He said Dont worry brother  
Cause you and the others  
Will see it out on the road  
  
And I want to be around  
When all over this world  
You cant hear a sound cept everyone  
Singing songs of glory in the sun
