Eponine  
Parnasse what are you doing  
So far out of our patch  
  
Montparnasse  
This house were going to do it  
Rich man plenty of scratch  
You remember hes the one  
Who got away the other day  
Got a number on his chest  
Perhaps a fortune put away  
  
Eponine  
Oh Lord somebody help me  
Dear God whatll I do  
Hell think this is an ambush  
Hell think Im in it too  
  
Whatll I do whatll I say  
Ive got to warn them here  
Ive got to find a way  
  
Thenardier arrives with the rest of his gang  
  
Thenardier  
This is his lair  
Ive seen the old fox around  
He keeps himself to himself  
Hes staying close to the ground  
I smell profit here  
  
Ten years ago  
He came and paid for Cosette  
I let her go for a song  
Its time we settled the debt  
Thisll cost him dear  
  
Brujon  
What do I care  
Who you should rob  
Give me my share  
Finish the job  
  
Thenardier  
You shut your mouth  
Give me your hand  
  
He notices Eponine but doesnt recognize her  
  
Brujon  
What have we here  
  
Thenardier  
Who is this hussy  
  
Babet  
Its your brat Eponine  
Dont you know your own kid  
Whys she hanging about you  
  
Thenardier  
Ponine get on home  
Youre not needed in this  
Were enough here without you  
  
Eponine  
I know this house  
I tell you theres nothing here for you  
Just the old man and the girl  
They live ordinary lives  
  
Thenardier  
Dont interfere  
Youve got some gall  
Take care young miss  
Youve got a lot to say  
  
Brujon  
Shes going soft  
  
Claquesous  
Happens to all  
  
Montparnasse  
Go home Ponine  
Go home youre in the way  
  
Eponine  
Im gonna scream Im gonna warn them here  
  
Thenardier  
One little scream and youll regret it for a year  
  
Claquesous  
What a palaver  
What an absolute treat  
To watch a cat and its father  
Pick a bone in the street  
  
Brujon  
Not a sound out of you  
  
Eponine  
Well I told you Id do it told you Id do it  
  
She screams  
  
Thenardier  
You wait my girl youll rue this night  
Ill make you scream youll scream all right  
Leave her to me dont wait around  
Make for the sewers go underground  
  
The gang scatters  
  
Marius  
It was your cry sent them away  
Once more Ponine saving the day  
Dearest Cosette my friend Ponine  
Brought me to you showed me the way  
  
Someone is near  
Lets not be seen  
Somebodys here  
  
Marius leaves quickly as Valjean enters  
  
Valjean  
My God Cosette  
I heard a cry in the dark  
I heard the shout of angry voices in the street  
  
Cosette  
That was my cry you heard Papa  
I was afraid of what theyd do  
They ran away when they heard my cry  
  
Valjean  
Cosette my child what will become of you  
  
Cosette  
Three men I saw beyond the wall  
Three men in shadow moving fast  
  
Valjean  
This is a warning to us all  
These are the shadows of the past  
Must be Javert  
Hes found my cover at last  
Ive got to get Cosette away  
Before they return  
We must get away from shadows  
They will never let us be  
Tomorrow to Calais  
Then a ship across the sea  
Hurry Cosette prepare to leave and say no more  
Tomorrow well away  
Hurry Cosette its time to close another door  
And live another day
