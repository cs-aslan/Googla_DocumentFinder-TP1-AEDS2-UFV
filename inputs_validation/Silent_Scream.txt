White dress torture in discuise pointing flashlight right into my eyes  
sharp pain every single night every day I fight a hopeless fight  
I look over thirty years Ive wished that I was dead  
somebody help me out because Im tied down to my bed  
  
Im looking for someone to release me  
Im waiting for an angel from my dreams  
Im talking to all of you around me  
Im asking youtell me can you hear my silent scream  
  
Dear god gave me such a life  
full of pain its sharp just like a knife  
I can think but I cannot tell  
Wots life to you to me is hell  
I hear the storm outsidefirst drop just hit the roof  
id die to see the rain but I can not can not move  
  
Im looking for someone to release me  
Im waiting for an angel from my dreams  
Im talking to all of you around me  
Im asking youtell me can you hear my silent scream  
  
If living is my cross so let me die or crucify me now  
but tell me can you hear my silent scream  
  
musical interlude  
  
Time stayes still only I can feel when the darkness will apear  
everyday Ive wished away oh please please take away my pain  
  
Im looking for someone to release me  
Im waiting for an angel from my dreams  
Im talking to all of you around me  
Im asking youtell me can you hear my silent scream  
Yea yea yea yea
