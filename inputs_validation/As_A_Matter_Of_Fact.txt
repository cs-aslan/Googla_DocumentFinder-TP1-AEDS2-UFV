Blow daddy oh yeah  
Here we are standing at the hard line  
We made it last this long  
The two of us together since the first time  
And I believe our love is still strong  
Seems love has a funny way  
Well it can come or go or it can choose to stay  
But love says what it has to say  
Matter of fact  
Ooh as a matter of fact  
I love you  
Oh as a matter of fact  
And I love that you love me back  
As a matter of fact  
Ooh as a matter a matter  
Some said we wouldnt make it this far  
But they dont talk no more  
No more  
The love we share is precious as a big star  
And what we haves what others hope for  
Seems love has a funny way  
Well it can come or go or it can choose to stay  
But love says what it has to say  
Matter of fact  
Ooh as a matter of fact  
I need you  
Oh as a matter of fact  
And Im glad that you need me back  
As a matter of fact
