Dressed up like a dogs dinner  
Butter wouldnt melt in your mouth  
If this is a dogs life  
Then youre the cats clothes  
They hire out your sons  
And hire out your daughters  
The man from abroad says hes already bought her  
And now you look like a lover but youre only a tourist  
  
Youre either talking or yawning  
You didnt listen to a thing you heard  
Dont start your morning moaning or you might wake up in Luxembourg  
  
You get over  
Youre worried by her body  
Shes worryin about her bodily odor  
You pull off  
The pull over  
You say that you love her when you really loathe her  
Serves you right now she wants you to feed her and clothe her  
  
Youre either talking or yawning  
You didnt listen to a thing you heard  
Dont start your morning moaning or you might wake up in Luxembourg  
  
Theyre smiling sweetly while theyre looking daggers  
Kick you where it really matters  
Send all your friends to Coventry  
And look for your name in last nights obituaries  
  
If youve got the Deutschmarks  
If youve got the yen then  
You get the shirt off her back and the clock off Big Ben  
Somebodys soft touch  
Struck all these bargains  
In the drinking clubs with the council men making  
Plans to put lead back in their pencils again  
  
Youre either talking or yawning  
You didnt listen to a thing you heard  
Dont start your morning moaning or you might wake up in Luxembourg
