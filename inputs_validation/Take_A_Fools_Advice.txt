If you love her  
And she makes one mistake  
Please dont leave her  
It would make your heart ache  
Take a fools advice  
Dont pay the price I had to pay  
  
If you need her  
But youre letting her go  
Please dont do it  
Youll be sorry I know  
Take a fools advice  
Dont pay the price I had to pay  
  
Truly  
Shes caused you to doubt her  
Truly  
Shes broken the rules  
But lifes not worth living without her  
So listen to the wisdom of a fool  
  
Think it over  
And forgive her this time  
I was foolish  
I lost the love that was mine  
Take a fools advice  
Dont pay the price I had to pay  
  
Take a fools advice  
Dont pay the price I had to pay
