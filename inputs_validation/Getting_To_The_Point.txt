Its out of control And theres nothing I can do now  
Out of control spinning softly through the blue now  
And look beyond these walls as the meaning starts to dawn  
Its getting to the point getting to the point  
  
Its out of control nothing I can do  
Like a fire that keeps on burning  
And nobody knows what Im going through  
And the thoughts just keep returning  
And all you had to say was that you were gonna stay  
Its getting to the point getting to the point  
  
Its getting to the point where nobody can stop it now  
Its getting to the point of no return  
And all that I can do is stand and watch it now  
watch it burn burn burn  
Its getting to the point where reasons are forgotten  
Its getting to the point where no one knows  
And all that I can do is say Im sorry but thats the way it goes  
Its getting to the point  
  
Forever is a long way forever takes your breath away  
Id like to talk about it try to understand  
Its getting to the point getting to the point  
Its out of control nothing I can do  
Like a fire that keeps on burning  
And nobody knows what Im going through  
And the thoughts just keep returning  
And all you had to say was that you were gonna stay  
Its getting to the point getting to the point
