How can I not taste it  
When its right there put it in my hand  
And lets not put it in their faces  
Hide the obvious just a little bit  
Its coming to this  
  
Youll know theyll never face it  
Theyre just a face all covered with a rag  
And they cant stop talking  
So the bigger it gets  
And yeah they take up space but still nothings wasted  
  
A lie is a lie with crossed hearts and hopes to die  
Wo oh oh oh  
You can find me underground  
Where I cant hear a sound  
I watched you get down on your knees  
In hopes that I would turn around  
So now youll find me underground  
Where I cant hear a sound  
Where I cant hear a sound  
  
I tried hard to erase it  
I tried not to use it cause I can  
And dont tell me what a race is  
Cause I can get fucked up more than a little bit  
Its coming to this  
  
We pay to watch it wasted  
Theyre just a face all covered with a rag  
And they might keep running  
But the slower they move  
And those moves in time with their perfect placement  
  
A lie is a lie with crossed hearts and hopes to die  
Wo oh oh oh  
You can find me underground  
Where I cant hear a sound  
I watched you get down on your knees  
In hopes that I would turn around  
So now youll find me underground  
Where I cant hear a sound  
Where I cant hear a sound  
Where I cant hear a sound  
  
What can I say  
I would have gone another way  
Cause that isnt me  
I was born to fade away  
Its nothing you did just something I felt as a kid  
And now I cant feel  
I cant feel anything at all  
Its nothing at all  
I feel nothing at all  
Nothing at all  
  
A lie is a lie with crossed hearts and hopes to die  
Wo oh oh oh  
You can find me underground  
Where I cant hear a sound  
I watched you get down on your knees  
In hopes that I would turn around  
So now youll find me underground  
Where I cant hear a sound  
Where I cant hear a sound
