Youre not in control when theres demands put on your heart  
You dont even know cause when its real you fall too hard  
And yet even so you try to play like nothings wrong  
No you cant run away there is no hiding place  
Cause you cant run from your heart  
  
Chorus  
Your eyes they tell me secrets that you you cant deny  
Your eyes they show me feelings that you hold deep inside  
How do I know the secrets that you try to hide  
Cause when I look in your eyes the truth is alive  
I knew youd be mine  
  
So now that its on its time to face reality  
Its time to be strong take all your insecurities baby  
Dont be afraid you gotta let your feelings flow  
No you cant run away there is no hiding place  
You gotta be true to your heart  
  
Chorus  
  
Now that youre all turned out  
Dont you just love the way that it feels  
Now you cant do without my love  
And you know thats for real  
  
Now why you deny yourself  
I will never never never understand  
Because I love you and you love me too  
And thats just the way that it is yeah  
  
Chorus
