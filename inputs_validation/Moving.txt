Moving stranger does it really matter  
As long as youre not afraid to feel  
Touch me hold me how my open arms ache  
Try to fall for me  
  
How Im moved how you move me  
With your beautys potency  
You give me life please dont let me go  
You crush the lily in my soul  
  
Moving liquid yes you are just as water  
You flow around all that comes in your way  
Dont think it over it always takes you over  
And sets your spirit dancing  
  
How Im moved how you move me  
With your beautys potency  
You give me life please dont let me go please dont let me go  
You give me life please dont let me go please dont let me go  
Oh you give me life please dont let me go  
You crush the lily in my soul  
Soul
