I dont have a problem  
Im not seeking her advice  
Im saving that for later  
Yeh its something awful nice  
I had a shaky feeling  
When she floated into sight  
I imagine well be doing it tonight  
  
Im ragged round the edges  
All these people in the room  
Theres magic in the air  
Im guessing she can feel it too  
Prospective recreation  
Helps me keep her in my sight  
I imagine well be doing it tonight  
  
Thats why everybodys sitting around  
We cant think of nothing better to do  
Theres no empty bottle  
Theyre all half full  
So we end up spinning a shoe  
  
We keep on going til poor old Lennys  
Got drool hanging off of his chin  
He cant stop winning  
When the shoe stops spinning  
But he doesnt know where to begin  
  
She wasnt in the running  
She was never in the game  
I could see her in the distance  
But I could not lay my claim  
Let me tell you bout this cherry  
I never got a single bite  
Therefore I imagine well be doing it  
Tonight
