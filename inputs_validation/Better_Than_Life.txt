Better Than Life  
Words and Music by Marty Sampson  
  
Better than the riches of this world  
Better than the sound of my friends voices  
Better than the biggest dreams of my heart  
And thats just the start  
  
Better than getting what I say I need  
Better than living the life that I want to  
Better than the love anyone could give  
Your love is  
  
You hold me now in your arms  
And never let me go  
  
You oh Lord make the sun shine  
And the moon light in the night sky  
You give me breath and all your love  
I give my heart to you because  
  
I cant stop falling in love with you  
Ill never stop falling in love with you  
I cant stop falling in love with you  
Ill never stop falling in love with you
