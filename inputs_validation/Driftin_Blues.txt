Im drifting and drifting  
Just like a ship out on the sea  
Im drifting and drifting  
Just like a ship out on the sea  
Well I aint got nobody  
In this world to care for me  
  
If my baby  
Would only take me back again  
If my baby  
Would only take me back again  
I would feel much better darling  
And at least Id have a friend  
  
I give you all my money  
Tell me what more can I do  
I give you all my money  
Tell me what more can I do  
You is a sweet little girl  
But I swear you wont be true  
  
Im drifting and drifting  
Just like a ship out on the sea  
Im drifting and drifting  
Just like a ship out on the sea  
Because I aint got nobody  
In this world to care for me
