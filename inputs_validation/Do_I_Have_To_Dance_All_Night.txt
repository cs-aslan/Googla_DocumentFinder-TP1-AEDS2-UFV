Im FortyOne the moon is full  
You make love very well  
You touch me like I touch myself  
I like you Mademoiselle  
Youre so fresh and youre so new  
I do enjoy you Miss  
Theres nothing I would rather do  
Than move around just like this  
But do I have to dance all night  
But do I have to dance all night  
Ooh tell me Bird of Paradise  
Do I have to dance all night  
You never really have to tell me what  
You really think of me  alright  
Lets say Im doing fine  
But do I have to dance all night  
Do I have to dance all night   
I learned this step a while ago  
I had to practice it while everybody slept  
I waited half my life for you you know  
I didnt even think that youd accept  
And here you are before me in the flesh  
Saying Yes yes yes  
But do I have to dance all night   
I learned this step a while ago   
But do I have to dance all night
