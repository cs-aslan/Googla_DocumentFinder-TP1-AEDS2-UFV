Ask the mirror on the wall  
Whos the biggest fool of all  
Bet you feel small  
It happens to us all  
  
See the world  
Ask whats it for  
Understanding nothing more  
Dont you feel small  
It happens to us all  
  
Time is now to spread your voice  
Times to come therell be no choice  
Why do you feel small  
It happens to us all  
  
Look at progress  
Then count the cost  
Well spoil the seas  
With the rivers weve lost  
  
See the writing on the wall  
Hear the mirrors warning call  
Thats why you feel small  
It happens to us all  
  
Ask the mirror on the wall  
Whos the biggest fool of all  
Bet you feel small  
It happens to us all
