Assassination of the voice of God  
I dont know if I can do it  
Ive found the problem and the problems you  
Im here to pick up the pieces  
  
You wont remember me but I do you  
I told you that I would come back  
Everything will be decided here  
They can read it in the papers  
  
Your breathing haunts me  
My breathing  
The sleeproom still waits for me  
  
Join the army you can see the world  
I remember this one patrol  
Been liberating river towns  
And we picked up the sex skin crawl  
  
We would sing the new leaders song  
Everyone invented stories  
The connection was a fragile thing  
Far too many distractions  
  
Ive been listening to the new DJ  
Whats all this original con  
We all live in the same museum  
We all rearrange the same old song  
  
Assassination by the radio  
I dont know if they can do it  
Ive found the problem and the problems One  
Im here to pick up the pieces
