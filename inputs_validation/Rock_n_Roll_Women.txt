Im goin looking for a woman with the night in her eyes  
Someone to take all the small talk and laugh at the lies  
A high heeled double trouble backstage queen  
Who gets what she wants and knows where shes been  
Alright show your hand  
Im looking for the promise of a one night stand  
So Im going looking for those rock n roll women tonight  
You can see in my face just what Im hoping to find  
I want a twelve bar beauty with a one track mind

Alright show your hand  
Im looking for the promise of a one night stand  
So Im going looking for those rock n roll women tonight
