  
Sitting in my room  
And I find Im outa smokes  
All my money went to beer  
So now Im fucking broke  
Need a drag of something  
So Im digging through the couch  
I roll up all the butts  
From every ashtray in the house  
I got a couple shitty smokes  
But theres still a case of beer  
I havent gone this long  
Without a smoke in fucking years  
With all this speed thats in my brain  
If I dont get some cigarettes  
Im gonna go insane  
Nicfit Nicfit  
Nicfit Nicfit  
Nicfit Nicfit  
Sitting in my room  
And I find Im out of smokes  
All my money went to beer  
So now Im fucking broke  
Need a drag of something  
So Im digging through the couch  
I roll up all the butts  
From every ashtray in the house  
I got a couple shitty smokes  
But theres still a case of beer  
I havent gone this long  
Without a smoke in fucking years  
With all this speed thats in my brain  
If I dont get some cigarettes  
Im gonna go insane
