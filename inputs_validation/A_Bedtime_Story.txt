Lay still Steven and Ill tell you a bedtime story  
Ill tell you a bedtime story thats not for all  
Children Its a very special story that only special  
Children will understand Its a halfawake story and  
It will be better if you close your eyes Its a  
Story that takes place in a dream like other  
Nightmares you have known Its a dream that Alice has  
Dreamed You can dream along with him You can follow  
Alice down the staircase deep down the stairs to the  
Pit where he doesnt want to go but he has to  
  
If you go to sleep now Steven you can go down the  
Long and endless stairway and sing sweet songs to Alice  
And free him And if you cant get to sleep Steven  
And in the middle of the night you get out of bed when  
Everything is quiet and the trees are still and the  
Birds are hiding from the dark you can lie down on  
Your bedroom floor and press your ear tightly to the  
Boards If you listen very carefully you can hear  
Alice searching for a way out forever chasing  
Rainbows  
  
Sleep tight Steven And have a good night
