Sometimes when I just cant sleep  
And youre on my mind and Im hurting deep  
At night at night when the sun goes down  
And the lights turn on and youre not around  
  
  
Ive been this way before  
But it wasnt real  
But this time Im sure  
Its the way I feel  
  
  
I dream when I call your name  
And Im in a place that I cant explain  
  
  
And everything you see  
I cant conceal  
Its the way that it is  
Its the way I feel  
This time Im sure  
Its the way I feel  
  
  
Ive been this way before  
But it wasnt real  
This time Im sure  
Its the way that I feel  
This time Im sure  
Its the way I feel
