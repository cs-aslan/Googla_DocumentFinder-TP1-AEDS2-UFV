I awake to find no peace of mind  
I said how do you live as a fugitive  
Down here where I cannot see so clear  
I said what do I know  
Show me the right way to go  
  
And the spies came out of the water  
But youre feeling so bad cause you know  
But the spies hide out in every corner  
You cant touch them no cause theyre all spies  
Theyre all spies  
  
I awake to see that no one is free  
Were all fugitives  
Look at the way we live  
Down here I cannot sleep from fear no  
I said which way do I turn  
Oh I forget everything I learn  
  
But the spies came out of the water  
But youre feeling so bad cause you know  
The spies hide out in every corner  
But you cant touch them no  
Cause theyre all spies  
Theyre all spies  
  
And if we all hide here  
Theyre going to find us  
If we dont hide now  
Theyre going to catch us where we sleep  
And if we dont hide here  
Theyre going to find us  
  
And spies came out of the water  
But youre feeling so good cause you know  
Though spies hide out in every corner  
They cant touch you no  
Cause theyre just spies  
Theyre just spies
