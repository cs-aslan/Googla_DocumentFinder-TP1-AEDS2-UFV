It was overcast that day  
And I was feeling some kind of way  
I pulled the covers up over my head  
Tried reaching for you but that was then  
I cant forget  
My hearts hungover but aint nothing different  
I close my eyes nothing but faded pictures of you Of you  
  
Faded baby youre faded  
Baby youre faded faded  
  
You come and you go youre just an echo  
  
Whisper in my ear but in the morning youre not here  
So intangible just like an echo  
Still trying to pretend its possible  
To bring us back to life  
Boy we continue to subside  
Hanging over life on this rollescoaster ride  
I know your name baby sub consciously  
Always somewhere but youre not there for me  
Boy you boy you faded baby youre faded  
Baby youre faded faded  
Boy you just come and you go  
You come and you go  
Youre just an echo  
Whisper in my ear but in the morning youre not here  
So intangible just like an echo  
Faded  
Always somewhere but youre not there for me  
Not there for me not there for me  
Always somewhere but youre not there for me  
Not there for me not there for me
