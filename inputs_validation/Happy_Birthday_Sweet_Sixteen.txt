Happy birthday sweet sixteen  
Tonights the night Ive waited for  
Because youre not a baby anymore  
Youve turned into the prettiest girl Ive ever seen  
Happy birthday sweet sixteen  
What happened to that funny face  
My little tomboy now wears satin and lace  
I cant believe my eyes youre just a teenage dream  
Happy birthday sweet sixteen  
When you were only six  
I was your big brother  
Then when you were ten  
We didnt like each other  
When you were thirteen  
You were my funny valentine  
But since youve grown up  
Your future is sewn up  
From now on youre gonna be mine so  
  
If I should smile with sweet surprise  
Its just that youve grown up before my very eyes  
Youve turned into the prettiest girl Ive ever seen  
Happy birthday sweet sixteen  
  
If I should smile with sweet surprise  
Its just that youve grown up before my very eyes  
Youve turned into the prettiest girl Ive ever seen  
Happy birthday sweet sixteen
