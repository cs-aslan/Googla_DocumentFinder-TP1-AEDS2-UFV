Love wont wait  
Love wont wait  
When I first saw your face  
I knew that I couldnt hesitate  
You said Baby dont go too fast  
If we do then it may not last  
Time went on and I waited for you  
I didnt know what else I could do  
I thought that wed always be together  
You said Hold on it just gets better  
And I believed you  
I kept holding on  
You think that I could never leave you  
You think Im not that strong you know  
Love wont wait  
Love wont wait  
Forever and a day  
Love wont wait  
Love must live in the here and now  
Dont ask me how I know  
Love wont wait  
Love wont wait  
Love wont wait  
So here I am with my heart on my sleeve  
You said Baby put your trust in me  
But I have come to the end of the line  
And you have taken up all of my precious time  
I need to be something special to you  
Everybodys somebodys fool  
Wont be a fool no you got me all wrong  
You wont know what you had til its gone  
And I believed you  
I kept holding on  
You think that I could never leave you  
You think Im not that strong you know  
Love wont wait  
Love wont wait  
Forever and a day  
Love wont wait  
Love must live in the here and now  
Dont ask me how I know  
Love wont wait  
Love takes time  
Love takes time  
And youve been taking too long  
Way too long  
And time never waited for anyone  
Dont wait too long or Ill be gone  
Love wont wait  
There wasnt anything that I wouldnt do  
You led me on you even said I love you  
How can we go on when its tearing us apart  
Are you going to break my heart  
Cause I believed you  
I kept holding on  
You think that I could never leave you  
You think Im not that strong youre wrong

Way too long  
And time never waited for anyone  
Dont wait too long or Ill be gone

How much longer can I wait for you  
Can I keep holding on  
Ive got to be strong  
Got to say goodbye  
Love wont wait  
How much longer can I wait for you  
Hesitate for you baby

Got to say goodbye
