Im afraid that I gotta do what I gotta do  
But if I let you go where you gonna go  
We gotta make a change time to turn the page  
Something isnt right I dont wanna fight you  
Weve been through tougher times you know it gets worse  
We can turn this around please let me be first  
And as I feel your tears spilling on my shirt  
Something isnt right I dont wanna fight you  
  
Hey you come over and let me embrace you  
I know that Im causing you pain too  
But remember if you need to cry  
Im here to wipe your eyes  
  
Tonight before you fall asleep  
I run my thumb across your cheek across your cheek  
Cry cause Im here to wipe your eyes  
I know I made you feel this way  
You gotta breathe well be okay be okay  
Cry cause Im here to wipe your eyes  
  
Oh nah nah oh nah nah nah nah  
Cause Im here to wipe your eyes  
Oh nah nah oh nah nah nah nah  
  
When did we cross the line  
How could we forget  
Why do we let the pressure get into our heads  
Your broken heart requires all of my attention  
Cause something isnt right I dont wanna fight you  
  
Hey you come over and let me embrace you  
I know that Im causing you pain too  
But remember if you need to cry  
Im here to wipe your eyes  
  
Tonight before you fall asleep  
I run my thumb across your cheek across your cheek  
Cry cause Im here to wipe your eyes  
I know I made you feel this way  
You gotta breathe well be okay be okay  
Cry cause Im here to wipe your eyes  
  
Please dont lose your faith  
Dont worry cause Im here to keep you safe  
I promise if you let me see your face  
That I wont let you down  
I wont let you down  
Im here to wipe your eyes  
  
Tonight before you fall asleep  
I run my thumb across your cheek across your cheek  
Cry cause Im here to wipe your eyes  
I know I made you feel this way  
You gotta breathe well be okay be okay  
Cry cause Im here to wipe your eyes
