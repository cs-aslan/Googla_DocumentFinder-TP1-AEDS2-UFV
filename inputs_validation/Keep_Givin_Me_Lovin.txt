Keep givin me lovin lovin lovin lovin  
Time after time Ive pondered this love that Im feeling  
I feel so divine  
It must be a crime  
Dont take it away  
  
Bridge  
More than a few told me I love you  
Now I know better  
When it got down to you  
Somehow I knew  
My number was up for some sweet sweet lovin  
  
Chorus  
Keep givin me lovin lovin lovin lovin  
Im talkin bout lovin lovin lovin lovin  
Youve captured this girl rockin my world ya got me reelin  
Aint no future with another  
Youre my one and only lover  
Come on and stay  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
Is it any wonder I want you so  
Only you can satisfy my need  
Cant you see my hunger wont let you go  
Babe you belong to me just to me
