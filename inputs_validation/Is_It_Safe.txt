Time cant fix it fast enough  
So we wont notice what it was that went wrong  
I saw something there much too familiar  
A butterfly with a broken wing  
Shes fallen under shes past the end  
Communication is down again  
The scars have healed but theyre back again  
Weve got to believe this man must bend  
Because if you could youd try and destroy her  
And there we would be with nothing at all  
Is it safe to be a man  
When your tired and lonely  
Only the confident know where to stand  
Is it safe to be man  
When the world is loaded with thousands  
That cant figure out just what they did  
Time cant fix it fast enough  
So we wont measure just how far below you kept pushing her  
Youll have to pay back all of the years that you stole  
Shes walking backwards  
Shes spun around her ears are ringing loud  
How does it feel does it make you mad  
Shes on her knees  
Please understand how obvious it is  
That this man must bend
