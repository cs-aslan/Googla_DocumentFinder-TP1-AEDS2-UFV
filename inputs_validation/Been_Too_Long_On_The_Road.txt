Always look so good on the outside  
When you get to believin its true  
Then you know that youre on your way  
People tug on your shirt say youre lucky  
Youve got evrything you want but you dont  
Yet you dare not say  
Go downtown people runnin around  
They climb slowly draggin you downtown  
Horns make a dent in your mind  
Plush rooms make a blindin your eye to see  
Blindin me Light lovely light  
Wont ya shine in my window  
Love precious love wont ya fill evry room  
Been too long on the road  
Maybe cynics veins are my life blood  
Maybe bitin the hand that I feed so Ill try  
Try to understand what it is that devours your freedom  
Makes you drop what you used to hold in your heart  
All the things you planned  
Go upstairs with a someone who says she cares  
Like the devil she does  
What comes ever into your mind  
Then gone leavin you with the coldest room  
Oldest gloom Warm wont you be  
Please be there in my winter  
Love precious love wont ya come full circle  
Been too long on the road  
How can I do this to myself  
Have I taken leave of my senses  
What kind of changes make a man  
Want to tear down all his fences  
Whoa Id like to know Home ever home  
How could I ever doubt you  
Love precious love how could I live without you  
Been too long on the road
