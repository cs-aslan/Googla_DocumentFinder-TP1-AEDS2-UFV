He stays up at night till way after dark  
Feeding the dog that lives in our yard  
Hell put on my shoes and stumble around  
But together we can catch any outlaw in town  
The boy tries to be just like me  
Im all that he tries to be  
Watching cartoons on my knee  
Mammas little man and me  
He wants to know how this and that goes  
Hell play all day on a mountain of clay  
And hell fight with me to show that hes strong  
But if he gets hurt its mamma he wants  
The boy tries to be just like me  
Im all that he tries to be  
Watching cartoons on my knee  
Its mammas little man and me  
Some day I know hell leave us alone  
Break mammas heart Ill try to be strong  
But if I shed a tear I hope he wont see  
The big man is him and the boy is me  
The boy tried to be just like me  
Hes all that I try to be  
Now Im watching cartoons on my knees  
And mammas little man is me  
Lets go to bed mamma
