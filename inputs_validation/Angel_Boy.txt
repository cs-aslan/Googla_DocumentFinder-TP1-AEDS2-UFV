My mother said theres only one way  
A sweet angel boy narrow and straight  
Timing his past teachings they fade  
Now their angel boy has gone astray  
  
Ive felt the hand of the Devil felt his breath on my skin  
Dip me into the water wash me again  
Can I still be forgiven for all of these things  
Or have I gone too far now  
Have I lost my wings  
  
I found a priest I spoke my mind  
Asked if Id sinned one too many times  
He said My son youre only a man  
Then I said Sir you dont understand  
  
Ive felt the hand of the Devil felt his breath on my skin  
Dip me into the water wash me again  
Can I still be forgiven for all of these things  
Or have I gone too far now  
Have I lost my wings  
  
God help us all for what we have done  
Weve lost our way we cant find the Son  
We make our beds we seal our fate  
Is there still time or is it too late  
  
Weve felt the hand of the Devil felt his breath our my skin  
Dip us into the water wash us again  
Can we still be forgiven for all of these things  
Or have we gone too far now  
Have we lost our wings  
  
Weve felt the hand of the Devil felt his breath our my skin  
Dip us into the water wash us again  
Can we still be forgiven for all of these things  
Or have we gone too far now  
Have we lost our wings  
  
Have we lost our wings
