I took a walk down New York avenue  
Wearing my latest disguise  
Enjoying the perfume of utter dismay  
I was effectively anesthetized  
Starving so arrogantly in jumblesale clothes  
Evangeline hires out my throat  
Weve got the streets of London wrapped in our beds  
Nagasaki in our own coats  
Were the wide boys  
Up on the streets  
Wide boys  
Ah go on and meet me  
Wide boys  
Delightfully unpleasant  
With the foxy adolescent   
Tired of being put down  
Brokenhearted my life  started  
Tired of being cut down  
All your illusions disillusioned   
Wide boys  
Up on the streets  
Wide boys  
Ah go on and meet me  
Wide boys  
Delightfully unpleasant  
With the foxy adolescent   
Well do some music plays the wrong side of nightmare  
Jukebox models collide  
The scent on the fire escaping blazing to the sun  
Embracing the old suicide pride  
I spent a few lifetimes making spinal connections  
Down on Einstein Boulevard  
Ive to to walk a tightrope now the rampart is so high  
I swagger like a neon guitar  
With the wide boys  
Up on the streets  
Wide boys  
Ah go on and meet me  
Wide boys  
Delightfully unpleasant  
With the foxy adolescent   
Wide boys  
Up on the streets  
Wide boys  
Ah go on and meet me  
Wide boys  
Delightfully unpleasant  
With the foxy adolescent
