She pulls the shade  
Its just another sunny Sunday  
She dodges the light like Blanche DuBois  
Bright colors fade away on such a sunny Sunday  
She waits for the night to fall  
Then she points a pistol through the door  
And she aims at the streetlight  
While the freeway hisses  
Dogs bark as the gun falls to the floor  
The streetlights still burning  
She always misses  
But the day she hits  
Thats the day shell leave  
That one little victory thats all she needs  
She pulls the shade  
Its just another sunny Monday  
She waits for the night to fall
