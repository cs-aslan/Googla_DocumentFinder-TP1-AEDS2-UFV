Watch me jumpstart as the old skin is peeled  
See an opening and bust into the field  
Hidden longings no longer concealed  
Watch me bulldoze every bulldozer away  
Each new obstacle from each old new day  
Where its going its hard for me to say  
  
And shoot me down  
And bring me down  
But I wont be around  
As you run through the places you love  
I remember the faces that cry  
And theyre pulling me back so I have to die
