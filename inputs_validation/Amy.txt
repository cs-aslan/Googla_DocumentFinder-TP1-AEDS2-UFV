Is your heart singing out of tune  
Are your eyes just singing the blues  
Dirty records from another time  
Some blood stains on your shoes  
  
No one really knows about your soul  
And I barely really know your name  
Burning rhythms and posting lies  
And a bunch of fools drown in shame  
  
Amy dont you go  
I want you around  
Singin woah please dont go  
Do you wanna be a friend of mine  
Do you wanna be a friend of mine  
  
Did you tattoo a lucky charm  
To keep you out of harms way  
Warding off all evil signs  
But it never really kept you safe  
  
Now youre too young for the golden age  
Cause the record bins been replaced  
Twenty seven gone without a trace  
And you walked away from your drink  
  
Amy dont you go  
I want you around  
Singin woah please dont go  
Do you wanna be a friend of mine  
Do you wanna be a friend of mine  
  
Amy please dont go  
Amy please dont go  
  
Is your heart singing out of tune  
Are you eyes just singing the blues  
Dirty records from another time  
Some blood stains on your shoes  
  
May I have this last dance  
By chance if we should meet  
Can you write me a lullaby  
So we can sing you to sleep  
  
Amy dont you go  
I want you around  
Singin woah please dont go  
Do you wanna be a friend of mine  
Do you wanna be a friend of mine  
Do you wanna be a friend of mine
