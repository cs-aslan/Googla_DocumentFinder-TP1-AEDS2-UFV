Strong and invincible  
They know every rule  
Seems inconceivable  
Anything they do  
  
They made us their slaves  
We werent unified  
Ever since we paid  
For selling our lives  
  
Someday someway I may see a wonderland  
Dont you wont you say that well be free again  
  
Deprived of our consciousness  
We cant predict whats more  
Can you remember how  
Things used to be before  
  
I secretly dream  
Of things we will be taught  
Will someone esteem  
For those who have fought  
  
Solo  
  
Strong and invincible  
They know every rule  
Seems inconceivable  
Anything they do  
  
Deep in our hearts  
We hope our dreams come true  
The only thing is  
What are we to do  
  
Wont you say it  
Cant you feel it
