I wasnt very indiscreet and yet  
That is a notion that I might as well forget  
Friends look at me these days with fond surprise  
But when I start to speak they roll their eyes  
  
Let me tell you about her  
Hush now Ive said too much  
Theres something indescribable I cant quite catch  
Let me tell you about her  
The way that she makes me feel  
Then draw a curtain on this scene I shant reveal  
  
Some things are too personal  
Too intimate to spill  
And gentlemen dont speak of them  
And this one never will  
  
I wasnt very conversational  
Accept to say that Youre sensational  
Friends now regard me with indulgent smiles  
But when I start to sing they run for miles  
  
Let me tell you about her  
Hush now Ive said too much  
Theres something indescribable I cant quite catch  
Let me tell you about her  
The way that she makes me feel  
Then draw a curtain on this scene I shant reveal
