If I had a hammer  
Id wake up all my neighbors  
Pounding out a rhythm  
All about you  
If I had a pencil  
Id push me some paper  
Id build a skyscraper  
To get close to you  
If I had a lasso  
Id said out the window  
And land on an island  
Next to you  
If I had a hot rod  
Id fasten up my seat belt  
And break the speed limit  
Gettin to you  
But I aint got a hammer  
And I aint got a pencil  
And I aint got a lasso  
So Im doing it the hard way  
Like a post postmodern man  
If I had a credit card  
Id clear me a pathway  
Through the deepest jungle  
Right to your door  
If I had a camera  
Id snap away my fingers  
And collect up the pictures  
Of you of course  
But I aint got a hot rod  
And I aint got a credit card  
No chance for a camera  
So Im doing it the hard way  
Like a post postmodern man  
Well I aint go a hammer  
And I aint got a lasso  
No chance for a camera  
So Im doing it the hard way
