The world looks rosy op on sweetheart hill  
For a girl named Mary and a boy named Bill  
Comon get cozy says the whooperwill  
To a girl named Mary and a boy named Bill  
Where theres a sky thats full of moonlight  
And a Mary full of charm  
There ought to be a William  
Snuggled in her arms  
So if I kiss you and I think I will  
Believe me its the only thing to do  
For youre my Mary and Im your Bill  
And its wonderful to be in love with you  
For youre my Mary and Im your Bill  
And its wonderful to be in love with you
