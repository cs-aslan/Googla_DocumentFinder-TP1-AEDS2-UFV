Youll never lose me to temptation  
Fighting the devil and I beat the dragon too  
Im at your rescueIm your faithful one  
If its the last thing that I ever mean to do  
  
Im in deeper than you could know  
The wise in me wont let it go  
You can count on me guarantee  
  
Chorus  
I stand up I stand up believe in myself  
If you love somebody stand  
I stand up I stand up give me a little respect  
If you need somebody stand  
  
Out of the shadow yet Im alright  
Its not as easy as I know it used to be  
I dont have time to look behind me  
I know the truth and its the truth that set me free  
One more heart to heart to live for  
One more time to stop the war  
Inside of mein spite of me  
  
Chorus x2
