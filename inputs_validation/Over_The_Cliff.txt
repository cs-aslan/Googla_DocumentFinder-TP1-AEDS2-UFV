Well I worked hard and I got lots of money  
Well I tried hard but I dont want to stay  
Yeah Ive seen too much trouble I felt too much pressure bubble  
I knew there had to be a better way  
  
I wouldnt hide if you thought I was worth it  
Youd smack me down when I misbehave  
But everybody knows that Ive got flunkies here in tow  
To clean up all the messes that Ive made  
  
Im going over the cliff  
Im going over the cliff  
And its hard to tell if life is a burden or a gift  
Yeah Im going over the cliff  
  
Forgive me or forget me everybody  
Well I guess I always had this honest streak  
Yeah Im sick of all the yawning the bitching and the bawling  
Im sick of feeling powerless and weak  
  
Please dont call me cool just call me
