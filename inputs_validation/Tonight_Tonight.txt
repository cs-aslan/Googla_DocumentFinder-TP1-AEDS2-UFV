Aint nothing better than anticipation  
Tonights been playing over in my head  
Ive had enough of all the expectations  
Waitings the hardest part like Tom Petty said  
  
We cutting loose like we were on a mission  
Them stars are shining its a perfect night  
I swear youre looking like a moonlit vision  
Its taking over and I wont fight  
  
Thats because tonight tonight  
Been waiting to see you  
Tonight tonight  
We cant go wrong  
It feels so right  
Just being here with you  
Weve been waiting for this moment all day long  
  
Thats because tonight tonight  
Been waiting to see you  
Tonight tonight  
We cant go wrong  
It feels so right  
Just being here with you  
Weve been waiting for this moment all day long  
Tonight tonight tonight yeah  
Tonight  
  
The room is spinning like a disco ball  
Everybodys dancing its a party yall  
You move yourself in that graffiti sky  
Gives you that feeling everythings gonna be alright  
We just got rocking now we rolling rolling  
Aint going home until theyre closing closing  
Well see the sun before you know it know it  
And you wont wanna say goodbye  
  
Thats because tonight tonight  
Been waiting to see you  
Tonight tonight  
We cant go wrong  
It feels so right  
Just being here with you  
Weve been waiting for this moment all day long
