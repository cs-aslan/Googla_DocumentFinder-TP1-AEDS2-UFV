Ten minutes ago I saw you  
I looked up when you walked through the door  
My head started reeling  
You gave me the feeling  
The room had no ceiling or floor  
Ten minutes ago I met you  
And we murmured our howdoyoudos  
I wanted to ring out the bells  
And fling out my arms  
And to sing out the news  
  
I have found her shes an angel  
With the dust of the stars in her eyes  
We are dancing We are flying  
And shes bringing me back to the skies  
In the wings of my love Im flying  
Over mountain and meadow and glen  
And I like it so well  
That for all I can tell  
I may never come down again  
I may never come down to earth again
