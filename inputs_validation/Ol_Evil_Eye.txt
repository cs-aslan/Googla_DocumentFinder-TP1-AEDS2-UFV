Start tha movie  
  
I loved the old man He had never wronged me He had never given me insult
For  
his gold I had no desire I think it was his eye Yes it was this One of his
eyes  
resembled that of a vulture A pale blue eye with a film over it Whenever it
fell upon me my  
blood ran cold And so by degrees very gradually I made up my mind to take the
life of  
the old man and thus rid myself of the eye forever  
  
So Im headed door to door  
With my grandmothers cookie jar  
Im sellin cookies 12 for a dollar  
I ring the doorbell nobody wants any  
I resort to goin cheaper  2 for a penny  
Anybody everybody they hate me  
I can tell when they spit and degrade me  
Theres only one house left the last on the block  
Old Man Willie on the hilltop  
I ring the doorbell the door creeps open  
And there it was starin and scopin  
The mans left eye red big and drippin  
I was trippin Ahh seeya  
I ran home I couldnt stop thinking  
About his eyeball winking and blinking  
And it looked not a damn thing like the other Ugh  
Shoulda wore a patch on the motherfucker  
It hypnotized me mesmerized me  
Traumatized paralyzed terrorized me  
Creepers whered you get that ball  
And tell me how it even fits in your skull  
  
I want a big long knife to stick it in  
I want to lift up the eyelid and kick it in  
Hes gotta die I want his eye buried in my backyard  
It aint hard Im killin Old Evil Eye  
  
Chorus  
Evil eye  
OhOhEye The bitch gon die Diediediediediediedie  
Evil eye  
Oh Oh  
  
Now this is the point You fancy me mad Madmen know nothing But you  
shouldve seen me You should have seen how wisely I proceeded with caution
with  
what  
foresight with what patience I went to work I was never kinder to the old
man  
than  
during the whole week before I killed him  
  
A day gone pass since I heard about JO  
Met up in this sleigh cause I dont fuckin play  
Anyway I gotta do him in Got a rusty revolver  
Put the silver bullets in  
Im plannin on playin one right to his nugget  
Down my drawers with the bucket  
Its time to go fuck it  
I stuck it up to his neck when he came to the door  
I really didnt know what I was in for  
First the cold man stared no a gaze no a stare  
Kinda like there was no one there  
How weird my body froze with the blink of his eye  
Evil eye sendin chills up my spine  
What to do What to do I gotta try to break  
I gotta try to make my way to the gate  
Wait I cant move Im stuck to the ground  
WWhat the fuck was that I think I heard a sound  
Turned around there it was starin at my face  
This little old mans eyes a make me a mental case  
Thats when I felt the pain deep inside  
Deep inside now his eyes open wide  
  
I want a big long knife to stick it in  
I want to lift up the eyelid and kick it in  
Hes gotta die I want his eye buried in my backyard  
It aint hard Im killin Old Evil Eye  
  
Chorus  
  
That night it ceased The old man was dead I placed my hands on the heart
and  
there for many minutes there was no pulsation He was stone dead His eye will  
trouble me  
no longer His eye will trouble me no longer  
  
Chorus x4
