The clouds are really cheap  
The way I seen em through the forts  
Of which there is a halfadozen  
On the base of my resorts  
  
You wouldnt think Id have too many  
Since I never cared for sports  
But Im never really lonely  
In my Excentrifugul Forz  
  
Theres always Korla Plankton  
Him and me can play the blues  
And then Ill watch him buff that  
Tiny ruby that he use  
  
Hell straighten up his turban  
And inject a little ooze  
Along a onecelled Hammond organsim  
Underneath my shoes  
  
And then Ill call pup tentacle  
Ill ask him hows his chin  
Ill find out how the future is  
Because thats where hes been  
  
His little feet got long and flexible  
And suckers fell right in  
The time he crossed the line  
From later on to way back when
