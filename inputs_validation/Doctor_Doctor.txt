Doctor doctor please  
Oh the mess Im in  
Doctor doctor please  
Oh the mess Im in  
She walked up to me  
And really stole my heart  
And then she started  
To take my body apart  
  
Livin lovin Im on the run  
Far away from you  
Livin lovin Im on the run  
So far away from you  
  
Doctor doctor please  
Oh Im goin fast  
Doctor doctor please  
Oh Im goin fast  
Its only just a moment  
Shes turnin paranoid  
Thats not a situation for a nervous boy  
  
Doctor doctor please  
Oh the mess Im in  
Doctor doctor please  
Oh the mess Im in  
But you look so angry  
As I crawled across your floor  
Shes got the strain  
And I cant take any more  
  
Livin lovin Im on the run  
Far away from you  
Livin lovin Im on the run  
So far away from you  
  
Livin lovin Im on the run  
Far away from you  
Livin lovin Im on the run  
So far away from you
