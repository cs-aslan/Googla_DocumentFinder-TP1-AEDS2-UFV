I held the book so tightly in my hands  
I saw your picture heard you call my name  
There was something strange I could not look away  
I wanted to be there I wanted to go  
  
You gave me no warning  
You gave no reason  
But I was with you  
Right by your side  
Just give me the strength and I will help you  
And they can try their hardest cause they dont frighten me  
  
It is written in the book  
  
It is hotter than Ive known before but I feel so cold and I dont  
know why  
But if the fire within your heart can beat the storm  
Then I really believe you could make it right  
  
Ooh the time has come now  
We must show our feelings  
But Im looking right through you  
And your heart is empty  
  
Whatever happened to you its too late to change now  
Theres nowhere you can run to no place to hide  
Ah you let me down  
  
But wait a minute I dont understand  
Its getting stronger so grab my hand  
Dont want to leave you dont want to go  
But Im losing all control  
Cant you see me Im slipping away  
I can only stay if youve the will to keep me here  
  
It is written in the book  
  
Oh so many times since Ive read those words  
Just waiting to see you can you see me
