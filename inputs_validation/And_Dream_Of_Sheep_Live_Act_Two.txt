Verse 1  
Little light shining  
Little light will guide them to me  
My face is all lit up  
My face is all lit up  
  
Chorus 1  
If they find me racing white horses  
Theyll not take me for a buoy  
Let me be weak let me sleep  
And dream of sheep  
  
Verse 2  
Ooh Ill wake up to any sound of engines  
Every gull a seeking craft  
I cant keep my eyes open  
Wish I had my radio  
  
Chorus 2  
Id tune into some friendly voices  
Talking bout stupid things  
I cant be left to my imagination  
Let me be weak let me sleep  
And dream of sheep  
  
Outro  
Ooh their breath is warm  
And they smell like sleep  
And they say they take me home  
Like poppies heavy with seed  
They take me deeper and deeper
