Often on the weekend Ill jump in my car  
Ill not fill up the tank although Im going far  
And if somebody asks me if Im going to a bar  
Ill say Im shopping cross the border in the usa  
I do not go down there to buy my groceries  
I respect our farmers and our factories  
I dont believe that local means its poor in quality  
Its just our goddamned prices are too high  
If he stays away for just two days  
I get one hundred dollars dutyfree  
Though it adds two more will I claim it or  
I dont declare the products if theyre in my trunk  
He wont declare the products if theyre in his trunk  
Although it is Canada that I call home  
I dont cheer for the Yankees when Im in the dome  
I didnt swell with pride during the desert storm  
Its just that I dont want to pay the tax  
Its just that hes too cheap to pay the tax  
Yes its just like this hes a loyalist  
Ill only shop at malls that fly our flag  
And hell tell Bob Ray that he just wont pay  
Unless I need my unemployment benefits  
Get a job Get a job Get a job  
Now everybodys doing the same thing as me  
Theyre doing what they can to beat the gst  
Theyre lining up for miles at the dutyfree  
So I bought a J C Penney store in Buffalo  
So everybody come on down to Buffalo  
Cause if you stay away for just two days  
Youll get one hundred dollars duty free  
Though its not at par it will still go far  
And it ends up in the pockets of our countryman  
It ends up in the pockets of our countryman
