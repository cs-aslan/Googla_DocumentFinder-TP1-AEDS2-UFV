intro  
Fools gold sparkling like the midnight sun  
Fools gold touch the ivory handles on my gun  
sold out to me  charlatans and thieves  
so wrong not to see  jokers and the priests  
Fools gold stranded on a point gloss  sea  
Fools gold nothing here and nothing to see  
sold out to me  the weasels and the feared  
and its so wrong not to see  the ghosts of the disappeared  
All gone away  
instrumental  
Sometimes when Im touched by love by hate or by the grace of god  
Sometimes in the dark when hope is fading  
Or no longer flies  
I wont sympathize  
Spend my time getting high  
Someone came to rescue me lit up like a christmas tree  
Tired of living on my own someone came and take me home  
Sometimes this jungle life is boring pawing  
Ready for a feast someone kill the beast  
Outside streets are teeming breathing heavy  
Ready to explode my brothers heavy load  
What you reap is what you sow  
Someone came to rescue me  
Lit up like a christmas tree  
Stranded here on my own  
Someone came to take me home  
instrumental  
Someone came to rescue me lit up like a christmas tree  
When Im out here on my own someone came and took me home  
Someone came to rescue me lit up like a christmas tree  
Stranded here on my own someone came and took me home  
instrumental fade out
