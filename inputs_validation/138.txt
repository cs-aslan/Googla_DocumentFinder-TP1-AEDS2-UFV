We are 138 we are 138 we are 138  
We are 138 we are 138 we are 138  
We are 138 we are 138 we are 138  
In the eyes of Tiger  
  
Do you think were robot clean  
Does this face look almost mean  
Its time to be an android not a man  
  
Whose pleasantries are gone  
We are stripped of all weve won  
In the eyes of Tiger  
  
We are 138 we are 138 we are 138  
We are 138 we are 138 we are 138
