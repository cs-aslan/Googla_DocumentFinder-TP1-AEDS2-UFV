You say that Ill survive  
That Ill get over you  
But if you walk away that door  
Then what am I gonna do  
They say you dont appreciate love  
Until its gone  
Well I guess Ill love you more  
Since Ive known what was goin on  
Its so easy to say  
That Ill miss you when youre gone  
But if this is the end  
Then the damage has been done  
Where did I go wrong  
  
How could I believe that we are history my love  
Even though you give yourself to someone else  
I will give you all the time you need to work things out  
When all of the excitement gone  
And youre wondering where you went wrong  
Please remember me  
  
I guess Ive got to learn to give you room to breathe  
When all I really want to do is love you close to me  
They say that I have got to be tough  
That God will see me through  
And though I know you love me  
Im confused cos he wants me to be with you  
I have never felt so very much alone  
But if this is the end oh then I guess Ill carry on  
No matter what youve done  
  
How could I believe that we are history my love  
Even though you give yourself to someone else  
I will give you all the time you need to work things out  
When all of the excitement gone  
And youre wondering where you went wrong  
Please remember me  
  
I will give you all the time you need to work things out  
When all of the excitement gone  
And youre wondering where you went wrong  
Please remember me  
Please wont you remember me  
  
Ill be waiting here got nowhere to go  
Ill be waiting  
Remember me  
Remember remember  
Please remember me  
Remember remember remember me  
Remember remember remember me  
Remember remember remember me  
Ill be waiting
