Stuck inside a jigsaw  
Of the Midwestern modern midtown  
Feeling like a trophy  
That the old mans been passing around  
Just another suit back  
From a old time college degree  
And when I walked by I heard em  
Saying that he was something to see  
Well now dont you know that Im the American Son  
Living out the old mans fantasy of being number one  
Daddy used to tell me Son youll never kiss ass  
Im the last of the American Son and its such a such a gasp  
Its like a shot of silicon  
The way the conversation grew  
And everybody was telling me something  
That I already already knew  
Well I might be dumb but it didnt take that long  
For me to get out of that room and bills  
And when I ran into the streets  
The crowd was yelling hes such a such a gasp  
Now dont you know that Im the American Son  
Living out the old mans fantasy of being number one  
Daddy used to tell me Son youll never kiss ass  
Im the last of the American Son and its such a such a  
Such a gasp well now kiss ass  
You know that Eddys in danger of  
Of a self indulgent fool  
To mesmerize himself into thinking  
That he is just to cool for school  
Well you know that its fun to carry a gun  
And shoot down what you never could be  
And when the dealer calls and has got you by the balls  
You tell him that ya you tell that ya had it from me  
Now dont you know that Im the American Son  
Living out the old mans fantasy of being number one  
Daddy used to tell me Son youll never kiss ass  
Im the last of the American Son  
And its a its a its a its a its a  
Its such a its such a its such a gasp  
Im the last of the American Son  
Im the last of the American Son  
Im the last of the American Son  
Im the last of the American Son  
Im the last Im the last  
Im the last Im the last  
Im the last Im the last  
Im the last Im the last  
Im the last of the American Son  
Im the last of the American Son  
Im the last of the American Son  
Im the last of the American Son  
Im the last of the American Son  
Im the last of the American Son
