A song for the deaf that is for you  
  
Nobodys comin down the hall  
Everybody echoes in my head  
Broken reflection outta luck  
Nobody ever needed it  
  
I got what was  
I want to take whats left  
Im ready now  
  
Beautiful senses are gone  
Canary in a gilded cage  
Singing  
  
Sweet soft and low  
I will poison you all  
Come closer racing to your tongue  
  
I got what was  
I want to take whats left  
No talk will cure whats lost or save  
Whats left for the deaf  
  
The blind can go get fucked  
Lie beside the ditch  
This halo round my neck  
Has torn out every stitch  
  
Who are you hidin  
Is it safe for the deaf  
Beautiful cancer  
Infiltrate and forget  
  
Then I saw you comin  
Then I heard not a thing  
A mistake not to listen  
When I knew where youd been  
  
I got what was  
I want to take whats left  
No talk will cure whats lost or save  
Whats left for the deaf  
  
Youre listening to W A N T  
The high desert favorite Incomprehensible radio station  
Its been a good night Dave catching here  
Not saying goodnight just saying
