Sittin here thinking about the times I roamed  
Different girls that I have known  
Of all girls that I have met  
You are the one girl that I cant forget listen  
  
We had our time now  
Good and bad now  
I cant forget a man  
I sho aint gonna forget him now  
Remember Side Stream  
Where we used to meet  
Making love nobody but you and me  
  
Champagne and wine  
Thats what you gonna get  
Champagne and wine  
What its gonna be  
Just as long girl you see about me  
Im gonna be knocking on your door  
I want the same love that I had before listen  
  
Im a man now  
Full grown man  
You got me eating from the tip of your hand  
I dont mind eatin long as you feed me  
Good love and good ole sympathy  
  
Champagne and wine  
Thats what its gonna be  
Everyday is gonna just be like Sunday  
Every night your gonna have stars in the sky  
  
Ou giving you  
Champagne and wine  
Im gonna give it to you  
Ou ou weeh  
Ou na na na na na na na na na na  
Ou weeh baby  
Giving you champagne and wine  
I want you to love me baby  
I really do need you honey  
Really do want you baby
