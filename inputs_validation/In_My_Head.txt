Its the cruelest joke to play  
Im so high I run in place  
Only a line we separate  
So  
  
Chorus  
I keep on playing our favorite song  
I turn it up while youre gone  
Its all Ive got when youre in my head  
And youre in my head so I need it  
  
Youre the only thing Ive got  
I cant seem to get enough  
We collide for one embrace  
So  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Ooh ohh  
  
Hurry up and wait forever  
Hurry up and wait forever  
  
Chorus  
  
I need it  
I need it  
I need it now
