Maybe tonight Ill get lucky  
Ive been lonely too long  
Maybe tonight some dark stranger  
Will hear me singing this song  
Ive been down Ive played around  
I dont like it that way  
Love wont you treat me right  
Maybe tonight  
Maybe this time Ill be saying  
The words that I wanted to say  
Maybe this time Ill be staying  
For more than just a day  
Ive been down Ive played around  
I dont like it that way  
Love wont you treat me right  
Maybe tonight  
Im so tired of being free  
Of living just for me  
Oh love wont you treat me right  
Maybe tonight  
Maybe tonight Ill get lucky  
Ive been lonely too long  
Maybe tonight some dark stranger  
Will hear me singing this song  
Ive been down Ive played around  
I dont like it that way  
Love wont you treat me right  
Maybe tonight  
Well Im so tired of being free  
Of living just for me  
Oh love wont you treat me right  
Maybe tonight  
Well Im so tired of being free  
Of living just for me  
Oh love wont you treat me right  
Maybe tonight  
Oh love wont you treat me right  
Maybe tonight maybe tonight
