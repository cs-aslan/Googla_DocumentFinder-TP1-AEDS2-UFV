In the darkness they will gather  
Conjuring the one  
  
Burning candles incantations  
Human sacrifice  
  
Getting drunk from blood not wine  
Pointy daggers shine  
  
Out of fire smoke and brimstone  
The dreaded one will rise  
  
Rise  
Burn  
Rise  
  
Nobody knows whos the disciples of hell  
Fathers a priest and hes casting a spell  
No one can stop whats already begun  
Worshipping darkness and Lucifers son  
  
Victims of the grand illusion  
Screams of ecstasy  
Fools are lost in mass confusion  
Searching for the key  
  
Nobody knows whos the disciples of hell  
Fathers a priest and hes casting a spell  
No one can stop whats already begun  
Worshipping darkness and Lucifers son  
  
Raise your cup and praise the prince of darkness  
See the truth of the power within the beast  
And when the time has come  
The gates of hell shall open  
  
Burning candles incantations  
Human sacrifice  
  
Out of fire smoke and brimstone  
The dreaded one will rise  
  
Nobody knows whos the disciples of hell  
Fathers a priest and hes casting a spell  
No one can stop whats already begun  
Worshipping darkness and Lucifers son
