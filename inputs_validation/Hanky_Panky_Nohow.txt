If the satcheting of gentlemen  
Gives you grievance now and then  
Whats needed are some memories of planing lakes  
Those planing lakes will surely calm you down  
Nothing frightens me more  
Than religion at my door  
I never answer panick knocking  
Falling down the stairs upon the law  
What law  
Theres a law for everything  
And for Elephants that sing to keep  
The cows that agriculture wont allow  
Hanky Panky nohow  
Hanky Panky nohow  
Hanky Panky nohow ohhhhhhh  
Theres a law for everything  
And for Elephants that sing to keep  
The cows that agriculture wont allow  
Hanky Panky nohow  
Hanky Panky nohow  
Hanky Panky nohow ohhhhhhh
