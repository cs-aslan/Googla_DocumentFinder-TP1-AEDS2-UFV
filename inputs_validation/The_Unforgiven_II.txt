Lay beside me  
Tell me what theyve done  
Speak the words I wanna hear  
To make my demons run  
The door is locked now  
But its open if youre true  
If you can understand the me  
Then I can understand the you  
  
Lay beside me  
Under wicked sky  
The black of day  
Dark of night  
We share this paralyze  
The door cracks open  
But theres no sun shining through  
Black heart scarring darker still  
But theres no sun shining through  
No theres no sun shining through  
No theres no sun shining  
  
What Ive felt  
What Ive known  
Turn the pages  
Turn the stone  
Behind the door  
Should I open it for you  
  
Yeah  
What Ive felt  
What Ive known  
Sick and tired  
I stand alone  
Could you be there  
cause Im the one who waits for you  
Or are you unforgiven too  
  
Come lay beside me  
This wont hurt I swear  
She loves me not  
She loves me still  
But shell never love again  
She lay beside me  
But shell be there when Im gone  
Black heart scarring darker still  
Yes shell be there when Im gone  
Yes shell be there when Im gone  
Dead sure shell be there  
  
What Ive felt  
What Ive known  
Turn the pages  
Turn the stone  
Behind the door  
Should I open it for you  
  
Yeah  
What Ive felt  
What Ive known  
Sick and tired  
I stand alone  
Could you be there  
cause Im the one who waits for you  
Or are you unforgiven too  
  
Lay beside me  
Tell me what Ive done  
The door is closed so are your eyes  
But now I see the sun  
Now I see the sun  
Yes now I see it  
  
What Ive felt  
What Ive known  
Turn the pages  
Turn the stone  
Behind the door  
Should I open it for you  
  
Yeah  
What Ive felt  
What Ive known  
So sick and tired  
I stand alone  
Could you be there  
cause Im the one who waits  
The one who waits for you  
  
Oh  
What Ive felt  
What Ive known  
Turn the pages  
Turn the stone  
Behind the door  
Should I open it for you  
So I dub thee unforgiven  
  
Oh what Ive felt  
Oh what Ive known  
I take this key  
And I bury it in you  
Because youre unforgiven too  
  
Never free  
Never me  
cause youre unforgiven too
