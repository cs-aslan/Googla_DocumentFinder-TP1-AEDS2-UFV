Who is the girl with the crying face looking at millions of signs  
She knows that life is a running race  
Her face shouldnt show any line  
  
Melody Fair wont you comb your hair  
You can be beautiful too  
Melody Fair remember youre only a woman  
Melody Fair remember youre only a girl  
  
Who is the girl at the window pane  
Watching the rain falling down  
Melody life isnt like the rain  
Its just like a merry go round  
  
Melody Fair wont you comb your hair  
You can be beautiful too  
Melody Fair  
Remember youre only a woman  
Melody Fair  
Remember youre only a girl  
  
Who is the girl with the crying face  
Looking at millions of signs  
She knows that life is a running race  
Her face shouldnt show any lines  
  
Melody Fair wont you comb your hair  
You can be beautiful too  
Melody Fair  
Remember youre only a woman  
Melody Fair  
Remember youre only a girl
