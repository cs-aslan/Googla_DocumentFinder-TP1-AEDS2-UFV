L O V E Love L O V E  
  
I see your face I look in your eyes  
What you feel is no surprise  
Everyone needs something to believe in  
Tell me your dreams Ill tell you mine  
In our hearts well look inside  
And see all of the colors of the rainbow  
I know  
  
Chorus  
We all want to believe in love  
We all want to believe in something  
Bigger than just us  
We all want to be a part  
Of the greater picture  
Thats hangin in our hearts  
Yeah its bigger than us  
  
I want to see beyond my own little world  
Grab your hands so we can twirl around the galaxy  
See the world with clarity  
Ohoooh  
We all have a long way to go  
But I know  
Were getting closer everyday  
Everyday  
  
Chorus  
We all want to believe in love  
We all want to believe in something  
Bigger than just us  
We all want to be a part  
Of the greater picture  
Thats hangin in our heart  
Yeah bigger than us  
  
It fills the universe  
It lights the skies above  
It rescues our hearts with love
