Step back and look at you and tell me that is what you want to be  
You realise that what youre seeing is a replica of me  
Inside my world is pretty grim that even I cant survive in  
I wouldnt try cause I know you  
  
Deep inside you know youre guilty as Hell  
Deep inside you know youre guilty as Hell  
  
You realise that what youre seeing is just a replica of me  
Only me  
  
Oh it makes no difference if youre the only one  
It doesnt matter when all is said and done  
Gonna feel the same God will put the blame on you  
Oh yeah  
  
If I was you If I was you  
Id wanna see Id wanna see inside my head  
Id wanna know if I was fuckin dead  
Id wanna know whats going on  
Someone tell me the truth  
  
Theres no fear in a fallen Angel theres no love in a heart made of stone  
Theres no truth in a heart that is screaming  
Deep inside youre as guilty as Hell  
Theres no fear in a fallen Angel theres no love in a heart made of stone  
Theres no truth in a heart that is screaming  
Deep inside youre as guilty as Hell  
Youre guilty
