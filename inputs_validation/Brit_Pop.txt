Anything goes on in your trip  
Did you happen to plan on selling out  
All your fake and original riffs  
Did you happen to think  
That theyre true  
And its all  
That I have  
And I feel  
Like Im busting  
My ass  
  
Chorus  
Is there anybody  
True that its gone  
Cant someone stop me  
Its taking too long  
Its running through my body  
Finding a sound  
And were sitting on it  
Just get off the ground  
Can you feel it honey  
Coming around  
Yeah Ive  
Been there before  
  
How did I start off with this gig  
Did I think I would make some money yeah  
Getting away with all this shit  
Some people might even think  
That its me  
On the drums  
On the bass  
Filling in  
My guitar  
In your face  
  
Chorus  
  
Is there anybody  
Taking my time  
Cant someone stop me  
Reading the signs  
Its running through my body  
Driving to go  
And were sitting on it  
With all that we know  
Can you feel it honey  
Were coming around  
Yeah Ive  
Been there before  
  
And didnt you say itd make you happy  
Well are you happier right now  
Why do we sing to make you happy  
Well are you happier right now  
Cause didnt you say  
Didnt you say  
Didnt you say  
Didnt you say  
Didnt you say  
Itd make you happy  
  
Chorus
