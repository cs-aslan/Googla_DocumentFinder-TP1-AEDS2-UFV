Im in love with a girl that Im talking about  
Im in love with a girl I cant live without  
Im in love but I sure picked a bad time  
To be in love to be in love  
  
Well let her be someone elses queen  
I dont want to know about it  
Theres too many others that know what I mean  
And thats why Ive got to live without it  
Im in love with a girl Im talking about  
Im in love with a girl I cant live without  
Im in love but I feel like Im wearing it out  
Im in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
  
Well the stories crawling back to me  
From my friends and the people that I want to see  
The things they say I know just couldnt be true  
At least not until I hear it from you  
Cause I still the little girl Im talking about  
Im in love with a girl I cant live without  
Im in love but I feel like Im wearing it out  
Im in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love a bad time to be in love  
  
You know that I love the little girl Im talking about  
Im in love with a girl I cant live without  
Im in love but it feels like Im wearing it out  
Im in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love
