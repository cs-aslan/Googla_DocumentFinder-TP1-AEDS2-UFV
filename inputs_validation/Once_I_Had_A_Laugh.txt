Once I had a laugh  
And when Im older  
I will not forget  
That once I had a laugh  
And when Im tired  
I will not forget  
That once I had a laugh  
And when Im fallin  
I will not forget  
That once I had a laugh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
  
Once I had a laugh  
And now Im older  
But I will not forget  
That once I had a laugh  
And now Im fallin  
But I will not forget  
That once I had a laugh  
I hear you callin  
But its not over yet  
Cause once I had a laugh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
I had a  
Ooh
