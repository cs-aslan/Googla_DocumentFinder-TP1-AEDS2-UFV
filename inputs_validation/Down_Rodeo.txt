Yeah Im rollin down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
These people aint seen a brown skin man  
Since their grandparents bought one  
  
So now Im rollin down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
These people aint seen a brown skin man  
Since their grandparents bought one  
  
So now Im rollin down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
  
Bangin this bolo tight on this solo flight cant fight alone  
Funk tha track my verbs fly like tha family stone  
Tha pen devils set that stage for tha war at home  
Locked wit out a wage ya standin in tha drop zone  
The clockers born starin at an empty plate  
Mommas torn hands cover her sunken face  
We hungry but them belly full  
The structure is set ya neva change it with a ballot pull  
In tha ruins theres a network for tha toxic rock  
School yard ta precinct suburb ta project block  
Bosses broke south for new flesh and a factory floor  
The remains left chained to the powder war  
  
Cant waste a day when the night brings a hearse  
So make a move and plead the fifth cause ya cant plead the first  
Cant waste a day when the night brings a hearse  
So now Im rollin down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
These people aint seen a brown skin man  
Since their grandparents bought one  
  
Yes Im rollin down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
These people aint seen a brown skin man  
Since their grandparents bought one  
  
So now Im rollin down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
  
Bare witness to tha sickest shot while suckas get romantic  
They aint gonna send us campin like they did my man Fred Hampton  
Still we lampin still clockin dirt for our sweat  
A ballots dead so a bullets what I get  
A thousand years they had tha tools  
We should be takin em  
Fuck tha Gride I want the machines that are makin em  
Our target straight wit a room full of armed pawn to  
Off tha kings out tha west side at dawn  
  
Cant waste a day when the night brings a hearse  
Make a move and plead the fifth cause ya cant plead the first  
Cant waste a day when the night brings a hearse  
So now Im rollin down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
These people aint seen a brown skin man  
Since their grandparents bought one  
  
Yeah Im rollin down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
These people aint seen a brown skin man  
Since their grandparents bought one  
  
Yeah Im rollin down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
  
The rungs torn from the ladder cant reach the tumour  
One god one market one truth one consumer  
  
Just a quiet peaceful dance  
Just a quiet peaceful dance  
Just a quiet peaceful dance  
Just a quiet peaceful dance  
Just a quiet peaceful dance for the things well never have  
Just a quiet peaceful dance for the things we dont have
