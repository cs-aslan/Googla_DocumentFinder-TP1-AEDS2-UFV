Like this come on  
  
Tried to get a hold of you last night  
Called you on the phone  
Thinking to myself something aint right  
Girl were you alone  
Letting little things come between us  
All we do is fuss  
When all I want to do is show you love  
  
Chorus  
So I say  
Hold up Im tired of all these lies yeah yeah  
Hold up And if you want to make things right thats right  
Hold up Im tired of all these lies  
Hold up Cause if you want to make things right

Remembering the way we used to be  
Everything was cool  
And now youve gone and done all this to me babe to me  
Maybe we can turn this love around  
Give it one more try  
You see every time youre thinking about saying goodbye
