Listen to me  
I know what Im saying  
But lord it dont come easy  
To admit that I was wrong  
It took me far too long  
I counted on you  
To give me a reason  
Why the Sun dont shine in the season  
Grey sky surrounded me  
  
Im not some kind of foolish lover  
I couldnt take this from no other  
Youre not being cool with me  
Cause I always know youll come back to me  
Yes youll come back to me  
  
Cause I always know  
What it takes to make you my lover  
  
You once said to me  
That I was a cruel man  
And you know  
That I almost believed you  
I was blind and I couldnt see  
You took my sight from me  
  
And all of these words  
And all this emotion  
Cant explain my hopeless devotion  
Or change what had to be  
  
Im not some kind of foolish lover  
I couldnt take this from no other  
Youre not being cool with me  
Cause I always know that youll come back to me  
Yes youll come back to me  
Yes youll come back to me  
  
Im not some kind of foolish lover  
I couldnt take this from no other  
Youre not being cool with me  
Cause I always know that youll come back to me  
Yes youll come back to me  
  
Im not some kind of foolish lover  
I couldnt take this from another  
Its no good being cool with me  
Cause I always know  
What it takes to make you my lover
