Chorus  
Ive been kicking it with your girlfriend  
Oh what am I gonna do  
Cause God knows that I really didnt mean to hurt you  
I know its bogus but I felt that you should know the truth  
I fell in love with her the moment that we were introduced  
And I just feel that its time for this little secret to end  
Baby Ive been kicking it with your girlfriend  
  
Go ahead and slap me again cause I can understand how you feel  
When a man takes you for granted and he dont keep it real  
I shouldve been a man and told you a long time ago  
Instead of stunning I should have broke it down and let you know  
Girl my fault for that dont know whats on my mind  
And I blame myself for wasting your time  
Believe I really did try to keep that girl away from me  
But her body language kept on temping and teasing me  
And plus she knew what she was doing when she did it anyway  
I knew what she was doing too and that made it okay  
Truth is that we dont even regret it  
Up out the closet I will be the first to say it  
  
Chorus  
  
Now I apologize for me and her and everything that went down  
These are the reasons why some girls dont bring they friends around  
I just didnt know how to tell you that I was feelin her  
And how we get away sometimes and make love  
I never wanted to dislead you  
At first I just wanted to please you  
I know its hard for you to be able to trust again  
Because I came between you and your best friend  
I did not ask for this  
It just happened outta no where since the day we kissed  
And the truth is that we dont even regret it  
Up out the closet I will be the first to say it  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
Im sorry again  
Never meant to hurt you  
Im sorry again  
But girl I love her  
Im sorry again  
I never meant to make you cry no  
The first one out the closet  
  
Chorus x2
