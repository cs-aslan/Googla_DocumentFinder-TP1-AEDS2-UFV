Why know every now and then  
I think you might like to hear something from us  
Nice and easy  
But theres just one thing  
You see we never ever do nothing  
Nice and easy  
We always do it nice and rough  
So were gonna take the beginning of this song  
And do it easy  
Then were gonna do the finish rough  
This is the way we do Proud Mary  
  
And were rolling rolling rolling on the river  
Listen to the story  
  
I left a good job in the city  
Working for the man every night and day  
And I never lost one minute of sleeping  
Worrying bout the way things might have been  
  
Big wheel keep on turning  
Proud Mary keep on burning  
And were rolling rolling  
Rolling on the river  
  
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis  
Pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans  
But I never saw the good side of the city  
Till I hitched a ride on a riverboat queen  
  
Big wheel keep on turning  
Proud Mary keep on burning  
And were rolling rolling  
Rolling on the river  
  
If you come down to the river  
I bet you gonna find some people who live  
You dont have to worry if you got no money  
People on the river are happy to give
