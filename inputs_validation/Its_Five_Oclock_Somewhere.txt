Alan Jackson  
The sun is hot and that old clock is movin slow and so am I  
Work day passes like molasses in winter time but its July  
Getting paid by the hour and older by the minute  
My boss just pushed me over the limit  
I could call him something think Ill just call it a day  
  
Chorus  
Pour me something tall and strong  
Make it a hurricane before I go insane  
Its only half past twelve  
But I dont care its five oclock somewhere  
  
Alan Jackson  
This lunch break is gonna take all afternoon half the night  
Tomorrow morning I know therell be hell to pay  
But hey thats all right  
I aint had a day off now in over a year  
My Jamaican vacations gonna start right here  
If the phones for me you can tell them I just sailed away  
  
Chorus  
  
Alan Jackson  
I could pay off my tab pour myself  
In a cab and be back to work before two  
At a moment like this I cant help  
But wonder what would Jimmy Buffett do

Pour me something tall and strong  
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
