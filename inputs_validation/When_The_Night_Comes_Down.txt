Jimmy got lost in a schoolboy phase  
You see the lines got crossed at a young and tender age  
He dropped out of school and with the new crowd hed meet  
He left his broken home for a new life out on the street  
See the young boys laugh  
Theyre gettin high on a midnight run  
Theyve got it all figured out  
They dont need no help from anyone no no  
Jimmy never knew real love in his heart  
No feelings remain  
Somehow he knew hed never be a part  
So alone with his pain  
When the night comes down  
Out there on the streets so many sad sad stories  
When the night comes down  
Theyre runnin out of hope in this land of glory  
Theyre runnin in the night  
When the night comes down  
See the young boy cry hes cryin out all alone  
And the hurt inside hes gotta face it all on his own  
And the church bells ring and the Lord is praised  
But they aint got time for Jimmy on their holy holy days  
Jimmy never felt real love in his heart  
No feelings remain  
Somehow he knew hed never be a part  
So alone with his pain  
When the night comes down  
Out there on the streets so many sad sad stories  
When the night comes down  
Theyre runnin out of hope in this land of glory  
Just runnin in the night  
When the night comes down  
Oh its a cold hearted town  
Nothin but a battleground yeah yeah  
And theyre runnin out of hope in this land of glory  
When the night comes down  
When the night comes down  
On this battleground yeah  
So many so many sad sad stories  
Oh you can see it every night  
When the night comes down  
See the young boy cry
