Standing on your own two feet  
Inches away from infernal heat  
Sweating like a piece of meat  
The story yours the plan complete  
Calling out to no one there  
The semblance of a holy prayer  
That turns about to curse and swear  
As you find that no one cares  
I got the ultra thrill  
You got the weaker will  
You say that no ones there  
I say Ive always cared  
Im singing your plight  
Grace dancing all night  
  
Give a little dominance  
Take a little soul  
Try a new experience  
Doing what youre told  
Go get everything you need until youre dead and cold  
Give a little dominance  
Take a little soul  
  
Wishing never gets it done  
Give two minus one  
Take away no theres none  
All this bullshit weighs a ton  
Field the question never why  
Because is why we live and die  
So while Im here going high  
Fuck the limit fuck the sky  
I got the ultra thrill  
You got the weaker will  
You say that no ones there  
I say Ive always cared  
Im singing your plight  
Grave robbing all night
