Im gonna make her mine  
Bom bom bom ba ba bom bom bom bom  
  
I went to trinidad I didnt  
Know just what I had til I  
Found her  
  
She wears a pretty smile  
That compliments her shapely  
Style and I found her  
  
Island girl shes oh so pretty  
Island girl I like her plenty  
Island girl Im gonna make her mine  
  
Island girl she makes me happy  
Island girl she kinda sassy  
Island girl Im gonna make her mine  
  
Everybodys got an island fantasy  
For me its like a caribbean odyssey  
All the people live and love there by the sea  
Near the sparkling wather neath the cocopalm tree  
  
Island girl she make me happy  
Island girl she kinda sassy  
Island girl wont you show me the way  
  
Shes fine so fine all mine  
Shes so good to me  
And I know i know our love or love so free so free  
That it was meant to be  
  
Island girl she make me happy  
Island girl she kinda sassy  
Island girl wont you show me the way  
  
Shes a real beauty from the caribbean  
Long dark hair flowin in the breeze  
Shes the kinda beauty makes you come alive and  
We can live together for eternity  
  
Every now and then I get this silly grin  
When Im there in her company  
She says Im crazy that Im also very lazy  
I know she loves me  
  
Island girl she make me happy  
Island girl she kinda sassy  
Island girl wont you show me the way  
Island girl wont you show me the way  
Island girl wont you show me the way
