Though Adam was a friend of mine  
I did not know him well  
He was alone into his distance  
He was deep into his well  
I could guess what he was laughing at  
But I couldnt really tell  
Now the storys told that Adam jumped  
But Ive been thinking that he fell  
  
Together we went traveling  
As we received the call  
His destination India  
And I had none at all  
Well I still remember laughing  
With our backs against the wall  
So free of fear we never thought  
That one of us might fall  
  
I sit before my only candle  
But its so little light to find my way  
Now this story unfolds before my candle  
Which is shorter every hour  
As it reaches for the day  
But I feel just like a candle in the way  
I guess Ill get there but  
I wouldnt say for sure  
  
When we parted we were laughing still  
As our goodbyes were said  
And I never heard from him again  
As each our lives we led  
Except for once in someone elses  
Letter that I read  
Until I heard the sudden word  
That a friend of mine was dead  
  
I sit before my only candle  
Like a pilgrim sits beside the way  
Now this journey appears before my candle  
As a song thats growing fainter  
The harder that I play  
But I fear before I end Ill fade away  
But I guess Ill get there  
Though I wouldnt say for sure  
  
Though Adam was a friend of mine  
I did not know him long  
And when I stood myself beside him  
I never though I was as strong  
Still it seems he stopped his singing  
In the middle of his song  
Well Im not the one to say I know  
But Im hoping he was wrong  
  
Im holding out my only candle  
Though its so little light to find my way  
Now this storys been laid beneath my candle  
And its shorter every hour  
As it reaches for the day  
Yes I feel just like a candle in the way  
I hope Ill get there  
But I never pray
