I will never feel the ribbon break  
I will never taste sweet victory  
I dont want to leave the rest behind  
I dont want inscription on a plaque  
  
Never first or second place  
I wont ever run your rat race  
I will always be lower than you  
I wont be your competition lowest  
Totem pole position is where Id rather  
Stay than be like you  
  
I dont feel the animal instinct  
I am not on top of the food chain  
The only battle I will fiercely fight  
Is one that hibernates inside my head  
  
Be the best climb the ladder  
Do it better higher faster  
I refuse to participate  
If I go up it will be slow Im bringing  
Everyone I know and stopping on the  
Sixth of seventh rung  
  
On a pedestal isnt the veiw great  
You better watch your step cause its  
A nasty fall when no ones there to  
Catch you when you call
