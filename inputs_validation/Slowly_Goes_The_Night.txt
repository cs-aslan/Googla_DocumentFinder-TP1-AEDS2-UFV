Lover lover goodbye  
So slowly goes the night  
I trace the print of your body with my hand  
Like the map of some forbidden land  
I trace the ghosts of your bones  
With my trembling hand  
Dark is my night  
But darker is my day yeah  
I mustve been blind  
Out of my mind  
Not to read the warning signs  
How goes it  
It goes lonely  
Goes slowly  
  
So slowly goes the night  
Ten lonely days ten lonely nights  
I watch the moon get flayed anew  
Until the moom becomes the skinning tool  
I send the skins of my sins out to cover and comfort you  
I know of a Heaven  
And honey I know of a Hell yeah  
I hang my head  
In my bed  
And remember what you said  
One evening Im leaving  
And I laughed and checked her breathing  
And said darling  
  
Go slowly through the knight  
O baby I feel the heal of time  
I wake to find you sitting here  
Cutting tangels out of your hair  
Singing a song thats all wrong  
Hey but thats alright I dont care  
O darling forgive me  
For all the misery yeah  
I embrace an empty space  
And your laughing song it fades  
Where goes it  
It goes some place  
Where its lonely  
  
And black as the night  
Come back darling and put things right  
I hang my head and cry cry cry  
Darling all night I try  
To cease on a reason for this mad mad season  
The nights they are so long now  
I cant remember it being light  
Call it sleep call it death call it what you like  
But only sleep dear  
Only sleep brings you back to life yeah  
I hang my head  
I toss and I sweat  
I never never can forget  
How goes it  
Im going but slowly slowly going  
And we both know that its gonna be alright  
  
But it aint you who has to cry cry cry  
Ten lonely days ten lonely nights  
Since you left my side side side
