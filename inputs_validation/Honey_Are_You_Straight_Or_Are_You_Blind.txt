Who do you see when you turn your eyes down  
Who do you see when Im not seeing you  
The news is out all over town and all these girls  
Are taking turns at being you  
  
Chorus  
Well well well  
Youd better make up your mind  
Honey are you straight or are you blind  
  
Shes coming in between us you know that she is  
Im not holding on to her but one of us is  
My hands are in my pocket my face is in a book  
She could walk round naked and I wouldnt sneak a look  
  
Chorus  
  
Honey are you straight or are you blind  
  
She walked in and your eyes flew out the door  
You squeezed my hand til the circulation ceases  
Shes just a doll like so many more  
Shes the kind of doll that youd like to pull to pieces  
  
Chorus  
  
Well well well  
Youd better make up your mind  
Honey are you straight or are you blind
