Ive never had what I wanted  
I had to fight for what Ive got  
Id gamble with anything to keep from feeling  
Like a dime in a dollar slot  
  
But thats alright  
Ive got one more pitch to throw  
Id better hang on to myself tonight  
Ive got one more round to go  
  
Ive always had too much ambition  
And its making me a wreck  
Im bad with small talk  
Feel like Ive got the hand but not a full deck  
  
But thats alright  
Ive got one more ace to show  
Id better hang on to myself tonight  
Ive got one more round to go  
  
Oh all that I want is to be left alone  
But they keep calling thinking Im stalling  
Oh all that they want give it heart  
Give it soul dont forget rock and roll  
And by morning need it by morning  
They say Lets go  
  
My babys been giving me a hard time  
And I dont know what to do  
Im up sleepwalking keep on talking  
Hell I dont know who to  
  
But thats alright  
Ive got one more chance to blow  
Id better hang on to myself tonight  
Ive got one more round to go  
Id better hang on to my ass tonight  
Ive got one more round to go
