Well they keep on taking my heart  
And they keep on taking my soul  
They keep taking an inch when I give them a mile  
And now it seems its been a while since anyone smiled  
They dont know me  
They dont know me  
But my name is on the highway sign never look behind  
All those troubles are gone nothing left but to run  
So meet me down and dont be shy  
A place where we can hide  
There aint nothing to fear  
There aint noone back here  
But you and I and these cloudy skies  
So its time to leave our home  
And see the faces weve outgrown  
Through the years weve kept our backs to the wind  
So long farewell goodbye my friend
