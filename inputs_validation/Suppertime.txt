Many years ago in days of childhood  
I used to play till evening shadows come  
And then winding down that old familiar pathway  
I heard my mother call at set of sun  
Come home come home its suppertime  
The shadows lengthen fast  
Come home come home its suppertime  
Were going home at last  
Some of the fondest memories of my childhood  
Are woven around suppertime  
When Mama used to call out from the back steps  
To the old home place Come on home son its suppertime  
Oh how Id love to hear those words once more  
But you know for me time is woven in the realization of the truth  
Thats even more thrilling  
And thats when the call comes from the portals of glory  
To come on home its suppertime  
Come home come home its suppertime  
The shadows lengthen fast  
Come home come home its suppertime  
Were going home at last were going home at last  
When all Gods children shall gather round the table  
With the Lord Himself at the greatest suppertime of them all
