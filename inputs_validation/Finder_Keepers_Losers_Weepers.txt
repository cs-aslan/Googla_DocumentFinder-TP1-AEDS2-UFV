Finders keepers losers weepers  
I wont weep and I wont moan  
Cause I found you and your love so true  
And Im keeping you for my own  
  
Heads I win or tails I lose  
I bet my heart to win your love  
The day you kissed me good luck was with me  
And I thank my lucky stars above  
  
Im not the kind to play for fun  
I only play for keeps and Im keeping all the love I won  
Finders keepers losers weepers  
The loser has to pay the score  
He lost you and I found you  
And Im keeping you for ever more  
  
Im not the kind to play for fun  
I only play for keeps and Im keeping all the love I won  
Finders keepers losers weepers  
The loser has to pay the score  
He lost you and I found you  
And Im keeping you for ever more  
He lost you and I found you  
And Im keeping you for ever more  
Yeah he lost you and I found you  
And Im keeping you for ever more  
He lost you and I found you  
And Im keeping you for ever more
