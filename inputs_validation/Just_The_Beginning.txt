I can walk on fire it aint stoppin me  
Its just showin me the way  
Come thunder lightning all over me  
Id still be on my way  
  
You can put me through loads of trouble  
But in anyway  
  
Its just the beginnin and not the end  
No use in pretendin cause you cant win  
Its just a beginnin the beginnin  
Not the end  
  
Its not a strange behavior its the way I am  
Nothin puts me down  
And if a situation would get out of hand  
Id still be back around  
  
You can put me through loads of trouble  
But never bring me down  
  
Its just the beginnin and not the end  
I can walk on fire it aint stoppin me  
You can put me through loads of trouble  
But in anyway  
  
Its just the beginnin  
Its just the beginnin  
Its just the beginnin  
Its just the beginnin  
  
Its just the beginnin and not the end
