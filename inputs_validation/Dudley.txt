Hot cold season gonna sink in my sweat  
No one isnt ever gonna make it there yet  
If you cant even cope with it  
Then youll pass me by  
Youll take it over  
And make it mine  
  
Fast slow living is a holding me back  
Wishing that my baby never told me that  
I cant even cope to make it last  
Then youll pass me by  
Youll take it over  
And make it mine  
  
Then you want it a want it a want it again  
Then you want it a want it a want it again  
Then you want it a want it a want it again  
Then you want it a want it a want it again  
  
My dear youve been used  
Im breaking the news  
Love nearly beat us  
Im thinking like you  
Im thinking of you  
Love follows near us  
Can love really steer us  
Oh can it be true  
Oh can it be true  
  
Lost all reason after playing your game  
Better quit staring cause your looking the same  
I cant even cope to make a change  
Then youll pass me by  
Youll take it over  
And make it mine  
  
Use me up  
Use me up  
Taper off and Im had
