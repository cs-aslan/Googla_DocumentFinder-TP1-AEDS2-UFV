Ive dance alone a thousand times  
To songs that no one else could even hear  
Ive reached into the flame of love  
I couldnt hold it  
And it disappeared  
Ive lived to learn to hate the blues  
Ive lived with everything but you  
  
I cant believe my eyes  
I see you here  
Lookin just the way you should  
Ooh  
So good its too good to be true  
I lived my life  
To be lyin here with you  
ooh  
I cant believe my eyes  
  
Ive felt the empty hands of time  
As they were stealin all my life away  
Ive heard the silence here inside  
Waiting for words that lovers  
Could not say  
You turn a little into stone  
With every night you spend alone  
  
I cant believe my eyes  
I see you here  
Lookin just the way you should  
Ooh  
So good its too good to be true  
I lived my life  
To be lyin here with you  
Ooh  
Still when I see you lyin here  
I cant believe my eyes
