How can you live in such a state  
Your mind is empty and youre full of hate  
The things you say and the things you do  
Mark you down as a helpless fool  
I know I know I know I know  
Its gonna be all right through the night  
Tomorrow comes and youre full of shame  
Oh baby You play the crying game  
Aaaah  
Gonna be a long time baby  
Before we get it sorted out all right  
Ill drag you out to Utopia baby  
 Well end up heading south  
I need I need I need to know  
If you gonna do me right  
If you do the things I ask of you  
Ill tell the world tonight  
He he he he hee All right  
You do me right you do me wrong  
Tell me where do I belong  
You do me up you do me down  
I accept it all without a frown  
You love like a woman in a fantasy  
Ha ha ha I admire you for my dream  
You dream of life and you dream of   
High enough but Im back again  
I love I love I love the funny ways  
Oh you throw me in a daze  
If you ever left me woman  
Id destroy myself sure as hell  
Aaaah  
Were gonna ride a slow train baby  
And take all the whistles stops oh no  yes we are  
Well put down the blinds while the carriage flies  
 The engine burns hot while the fuzz is going on  
So Ill burn its  to ash  
Well theres a life to live and theres love to give  
Ready Steady Smash  
Alright Yeah Uh mmh  
You just got to be out of your head  
Whe you say youll go look for the bottom of the top  
Well Ill be waiting and wont give it a rest  
  
 somethings going on  
And its sure   
Just like me he
