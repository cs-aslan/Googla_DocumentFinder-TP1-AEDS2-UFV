Im going out I dont know why theres no need at all  
A kind of turbulence outside and I cant resist the call  
I hear a siren I might be late fire flickers on a barricade  
A piece of smack melts in my brain as I watch the police deploy  
And I wonder  
  
Did not expect to meet you here in the middle of the fights  
I should have known you got it all you want to burn tonight  
Out in the riots you looked somehow divine  
You gotta kill a cop sometime  
  
A random motion thats what you are these days are so bizarre  
And I wonder to see your face in a place like this  
Reflecting the flames  
  
You see the market there across the square  
Its closing time but all the doors are broken  
Why dont we step inside its free for everyone you see  
Its paradise well alright  
  
And I wonder to see your face in a place like this  
Reflecting the flames
