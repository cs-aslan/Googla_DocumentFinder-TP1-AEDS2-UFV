Bishop danced with a thumbscrew woman  
Did a doublequick back flip and slid across the floor  
The Catholic traffic flowed freely cross the river  
And fiddlestick fiddled quick out the front door  
Oh baby dumpling mamas in the back tree  
If the bow breaks mama might fall  
Little sad and only baby dont be lonely  
Mama knows rithmatic knows how to take a fall  
Mama knows rithmatic knows how to take a fall  
  
And the kids are crying Flapjacks make em fat early in the mornin  
Little Jack grab your hat hear the breakfast call  
Muskrat bat a cat kick him in the fireplace  
Theres someone in the kitchen blowing Dinah on their horn  
Theres someone in the kitchen blowing Dinah like theyre born  
  
Well maverick daddy got oneeyed bridge  
She glides like a monkeymule kicking on the back slide  
Over hill over hill daddy dont you spill now  
Papa got a switch stick hes pumping little Bill  
Papa got a switch stick hes pumping little Bill  
And Billy hes crying Tomahawk tomahawk daddy better duck now  
The Mohawks the Mohawks theyre still out there in the woods  
Monatuk Ocanuk runnin through my dreams now  
With fire on their fingertips and Indian screams  
With fire on their fingertips and feathers made of moonbeams  
  
Well early in the morning the cannoneer cried  
I seen the sailors warning in the western sky  
Well mountain man if you can cut me down a fir tree  
Branches full of candlesticks for baby and me  
And my darling cried she said Honey the weathervane  
Lately its been pointing the way to heaven  
Scatterbrains scatterbrains watch out where you fall  
Champagne champagne a round for all the old choir boys  
Theyre busting off the altar chasing Dinah through the hall  
Theyre busting off the altar chasing Dinah through the hall
