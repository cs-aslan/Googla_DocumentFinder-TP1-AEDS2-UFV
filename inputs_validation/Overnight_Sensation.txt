Well I guess Ive been a long time  
Working in a backline  
Trying to make a song fit  
When you know it never was mine  
Two dollar highheel shoes and a honky tonk dress  
In the rhythm and the soul reviews I had a dream I guess  
  
And I had to beat the stage fright  
I had to cry all night  
Trying to make a song fit  
When you know it never was right  
I said  
Girl get up and get out of this mess  
Youre gonna be an overnight sensation  
Gonna be an overnight success  
  
And all through the badlands  
Rocking on the bandstands  
Its so hard in the barbands  
When theres no one there who understands  
And Lady Luck will pas you by and she will never say yes  
Youre gonna be an overnight sensation  
Gonna be an overnight success  
  
I used to be a sweet little rocknroll singer  
Chasing after fortune and fame  
Whats your story Whats your payola  
Me Im in the music game  
  
Well I guess Ive been a long time  
Working in a backline  
Trying to make a song fit  
When you know it never was mine  
What can I tell you I made a break I guess  
And now Im an overnight sensation  
Im an over overnight success
