I took a course in hallelujah  
I went to night school for the blues  
I took some stuff they said would cool ya  
But nothing seemed to light my fuse  
But its all in the past  
Like a check thats in the mail  
She was a tall whiskey glass  
I was an old hound dog that just loved to chase his tail  
Until I met a blind man  
Who taught me how to see  
A blind man  
Who could change night into day  
And if I can  
Im gonna make you come with me  
Because here comes the sun and well be chasing all the clouds away  
  
Ive had some lovers like a joy ride  
Some things are never what they seem  
My heavens turned into a landslide  
I thank God I woke up from the dream  
Because here comes the sun and well be chasing all the clouds  
The way bees chase honey  
And drink all the flowers dry  
Well be saving us a little money  
And if that dont do it yeah I know the reason why  
Dont make no sense lightin candles  
Theres too much moonlight in our eyes  
Because here comes the sun  
Aint no surprise  
Aint no doubt about it  
Gonna open up your eyes
