She gave you a flower  
The one that God gave her  
You all up in de koolaid  
But u do not know de flavor  
Get into the zone baybee  
And do yourself a favor  
Head down spin around  
Get a little refried  
If that dont get it you can  
Ketch it on the b side  
Just push play  
Fuckin A  
Just push play  
Theyre gonna bleep it anyway  
Just push play  
Fuckin A  
Just push play  
Were comin at you anyway  
Sweet leaf dreamer you been  
Smoking up the ganja  
Damned if you do yeah  
But dont get any on ya  
Kickin off the cashmere  
Putting on the kasbah  
Its a kiss a diss  
And trade it for a coo hah  
Just push play  
Fuckin A  
Just push play  
Theyre gonna bleep it anyway  
Just push play  
Fuckin A  
Just push play  
Were comin at you anyway  
Instead of growin old  
All dapper and neat  
Im gonna grow my hair  
Right down to my feet  
Its you and me baby  
No pimp daddy jack  
Its Cadillac wack no Cadillac wack back  
Just push play  
Fuckin A  
Just push play  
Theyre gonna bleep it anyway  
Just push play  
Fuckin A  
Just push play  
Were comin at you anyway  
Fuckin A  
Theyre gonna bleep it anyway  
Walk this way

Just Push play

Theyre gonna bleep it anyway  
Sil vous plait  
Fuckin A  
Just push play  
Were comin at you anyway
