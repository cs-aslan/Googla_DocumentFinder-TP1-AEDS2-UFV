I got 36 expressions  
Sweet as pie to tough as leather  
And thats 36 expressions more than all those Baltimores puttogether  
So stead of just kicking me why dont they give me a lift  
Well it must be a plot  
Cause their scared that I gotsuch a gift  
Well Ill miffed  
  
Cause Im  
The Greatest Star  
I am by far  
But no one knows itWAIT  
Theyre gonna hear a voice  
A silver flute ah ah ah ah  
Theyll cheer each toot  
Yeah that kids terrific mmm  
  
When I expose it  
Now cant ya see to look at me that  
Im a natural Camille  
As Camille I just feel  
Ive so much to offer  
Now listen Mr Z I know Id be divine because

A thousand faces

When your gifted then your gifted  
These are facts  
Ive got no acts to parade  
Hey what ya blind  
In all of the world so far  
Im the greatest star  
  
Who is the pip with pizzas  
Who is all ginger and jazz  
Who is as glamorous as  
Whos an American beauty rose  
With an American beauty NOSE  
And ten American beauty toes  
  
Eyes on the target and wham  
One shot on gun shot and BAM  
Hey Mr Keeney  
Here I am  
  
Im the greatest star  
I am by far  
But no one knows it  
Thats why I was born  
Ill blow my horn  
Til someone blows it  
  
Ill light up like a light  
Bright up like a light  
Ill flicker and flare up  
All of the worlds gonna star up  
Looking down youll never see me  
Try the sky cause thatll be me  
  
I can make em cry  
I can make em sigh  
Someday theyll clamor for my drama  
Have ya guessed YET  
Whos the best yet  
  
If ya aint Ill tell ya one more time  
You bet ya last dime  
In all of the world so far
