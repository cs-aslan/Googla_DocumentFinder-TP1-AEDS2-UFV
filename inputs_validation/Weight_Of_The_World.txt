Woman shes moving to the weight of the world  
Momma shes carrying the weight of the world  
All the time she breathing in the weight of the world  
  
Chorus  
Bring it on home  
Bring the soup on home  
  
Well poppa too he got the weight of the world  
Man is moving in to the weight of the world  
And all the time along with the soup hes bringing home  
The weight of the world  
  
Chorus  
  
Children too fall to this weight of the world  
All the time they they fall right there into the weight  
And all the time theyre trying to shake  
The weight of the world  
  
Chorus  
  
Everybodys going to the wake of the world  
Were all dressing up fine for the wake of the world  
And everybodys hiding behind trees breathing loud  
The weight of the world  
  
Chorus
