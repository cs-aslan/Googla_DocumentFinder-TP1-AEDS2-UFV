Well I make it alright from Monday morning till Friday night oh those lonely
weekends  
Since you left me Im as lonely as I can be oh those lonely weekends  
Said youd be good to me I said our love aint gonna never ever die  
I said youd be true to me but baby you didnt even try I make it alright  
From Monday morning till Friday night oh those lonely weekends  
 guitar   
I make it alright  
Oh those lonely weekends oh those lonely weekends look out those lonely
weekends
