Ow come here boy  
  
I met a drummer last week  
I pulled down  
With bottom knocked back  
And your stone washed dice  
I want you more  
  
He cried Mother Whatd you do to me  
I said Mother mother mothers for babies  
Call me kitty

Shake your kitty  
Shake your kitty meow  
Put your arms around me babe  
Im giving you permission to feel me  
  
Shake your kitty

I took a drummer by the hand  
To the juke box then  
We hit the floor  
With your Van Halen pin  
And your dark side burns  
I want you more  
  
He cried Mother Whatd you do to me  
I said Mother mother mothers for babies  
Call me kitty

Put your arms around me babe

But I still want you
