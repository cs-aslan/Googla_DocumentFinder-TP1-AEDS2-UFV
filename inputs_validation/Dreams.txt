The witching hour has arrived here too soon  
I know that all my dreams are inside this room  
Oh yeah its all in this tune  
  
Dreams in the night theyre falling like rain  
Dreams in the night they drive me insane  
  
They cannot wait until I turn off the light  
When Im asleep theyve got the key to my mind  
Oh yeah cant leave them behind  
  
Dreams in the night theyre falling like rain  
Dreams in the night they drive me insane  
Dreams in the night  
  
Yeah yeah yeah give me another dream now  
  
The Spiders lullaby is all they can sing  
As they inject their poison into my brain  
Oh yeah theyre calling my name  
  
Dreams in the night theyre falling like rain  
Dreams in the night they drive me insane  
  
Give me another dream now  
Yeah yeah yeah give me another dream now  
  
Rainbows and waterfalls  
Little girls are swimming in a pond of gold  
Im growing old  
Im growing old  
Sweet blue eyes of innocence  
Begging me  
To follow them to the other side  
Ah theyre growing horns  
  
Dreams in the night theyre falling like rain  
Dreams in the night they drive me insane  
Dreams in the night  
  
Let me out of these dreams dreams dreams  
Let me out of these dreams dreams dreams  
Let me out of these dreams dreams dreams
