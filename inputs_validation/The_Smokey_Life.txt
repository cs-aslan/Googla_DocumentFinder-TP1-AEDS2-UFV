Ive never seen your eyes so wide  
Ive never seen your appetite quite this occupied  
Elsewhere is your feast of love  
I know where long ago we agreed to keep it light  
So lets be married one more night  
Its light light enough  
To let it go  
Its light enough to let it go  
  
Remember when the scenery started fading  
I held you til you learned to walk on air  
So dont look down the ground is gone  
theres no one waiting anyway  
The Smoky Life is practiced  
Everywhere  
  
So set your restless heart at ease  
Take a lesson from these Autumn leaves  
They waste no time waiting for the snow  
Dont argue now youll be late  
There is nothing to investigate  
  
Its light enough light enough  
To let it go  
Light enough to let it go  
  
Remember when the scenery started fading  
I held you til you learned to walk on air  
So dont look down the ground is gone  
theres no one waiting anyway  
The Smoky Life is practiced everywhere  
  
Come on back if the moment lends  
You can look up all my very closest friends  
  
Light light enough  
To let it go  
Its light enough to let it go
