When I saw you at the Cat Club  
You looked really kind of cool now  
Well come along with me cause  
We got a lot of things to do now  
  
You dont ever have to be lonely  
Just as long as youre here by my side  
You dont ever have to be lonely  
Just as long as youve nothing to hide  
  
OohhOohh  
Come along with me cause  
Were gonna have a real cool time  
  
Girl youre girl you know youre always in my mind  
You know girl you know I want you all the time  
Girl girl you know I want you all the time
