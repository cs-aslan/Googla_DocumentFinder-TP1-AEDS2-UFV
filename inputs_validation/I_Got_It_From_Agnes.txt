I love my friends and they love me  
Were just as close as we can be  
And just because we really care  
Whatever we get we share  
I got it from agnes  
She got it from jim  
We all agree it must have been him  
Louise who gave it to him  
Now she got it from harry  
Who got it from marie  
And evrybody knows that marie  
Got it from me  
Giles got it from daphne  
She got it from joan  
Who picked it up in county cork  
Akissin the blarney stone  
Pierre gave it to shiela  
Who must have brought it there  
He got it from francois and jacques  
Aha lucky pierre  
Max got it from edith  
Who gets it evry spring  
She got it from her daddy  
Who just gives her evrything  
She then gave it to daniel  
Whose spaniel has it now  
Our dentist even got it  
And were still wondering how  
But I got it from agnes  
Or maybe it was sue  
Or millie or billie or gillie or willie  
It doesnt matter who  
It might have been at the pub  
Or at the club or in the loo  
And if you will be my friend then I might   
mind you I said might   
Give it to you
