In these days of wild roses  
I held a compass in my hand  
I had three wishes for a future  
That I wont need to understand  
  
And Ive got holly green on blood red  
Manhattan Christmas on my arm  
My soul aint worth saving  
Feels like Ive lost my lucky charm  
  
And Ive been living in the gutter  
Ive been loaded like a gun  
Ive been sliding down the mountain  
And it feels like kingdom come  
  
And Im always fighting windmills  
Have to take it as it comes  
See Im  
Im encircled  
  
I am  
If you want me tell me  
Cause I cant play this game much longer  
Feels a lot like oblivion  
  
This feeling just keeps getting stronger  
And Ive been living in the gutter  
Without American Express  
Heroes changing horses midstream  
  
Im detached  
Im secondguessed  
Wont you please come back and get me  
My whole world is in a mess  
  
See Im  
Im encircled  
This time I am  
Im encircled  
  
In these days of wild roses  
Im encircled  
Yeah  
And Ive been living in the gutter  
  
Ive been loaded like a gun  
Ive been sliding down the mountain  
And it feels like kingdom come  
And Im always fighting windmills  
  
Have to take it as it comes  
See Im encircled  
This time I am  
Im encircled  
  
I am  
In these days of wild roses
