Inside your plastic head you make decisions  
Upon her lemon world they fall forever  
Break the chains that tie you to the ground and bring you too knees  
Shake the chains that tie you to the earth shake the chains shake the chains  
Upon her willow hair the sun relaxes  
Shes watched all tidal waves away from your disaster  
Break the chains that tie you to the ground  
And bind you to your mother she will bind up your hands  
Bind up your legs  
Bind up your heart and hold you down till  
You say your sorry shes been waiting for you forever now and now  
Someone elses chapstick on your lips  
To hide your cheery lies you make excuses  
In between each lemon breath she smiles and swallows your abuses  
Shake the chains that tie you to the ground  
And bind you to your mother  
She will bind up your hands  
Bind up your legs  
Bind up your heart and hold you down till  
You say your sorry shes been waiting for you forever now and now  
Someone elses chapstick on your lips  
Say your hungry shes lying for you forever now and now  
  
Someone put sorry in her hand  
Nonononon  
Say your sorry shes been waiting waiting  
Inside your plastic head  
In between your laughter  
You drowned in memory storms  
That fall forever after  
Shes someone elses lipstick now  
Shes someone elses matchstick now  
Shes someone elses witchcraft now  
Shes someone elses chapstick now now now
