I know you vie for the good ol days  
And with less of us around we were a cinch to sway  
Does it feel like its the end of the world  
Well maybe it is but when was it not  
Cause its true me and you  
We are all tomorrows food today  
  
Theres no such thing as the good ol days  
The older we all get the better we all were  
Theres no such thing as the end of the world  
But just in case youd best batten down and button up  
Because its true me and you  
We are all tomorrows food today
