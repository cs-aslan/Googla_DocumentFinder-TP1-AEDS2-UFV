I was born in the jungle  
With the sickening smell of cinnamon in the air  
I was born in a white hole and I cant believe the colors here today  
Stalk on a circle  
Well Ive never been blessed with elephants memory  
Riding a red line nowhere  
If it takes 40 years for the gun to be paid for  
If it takes 40 years Ill put the money away  
If it takes 40 years to get the things that I need sir  
If it takes 40 years Ill walk the thunder and the rain  
I was born in a good home  
Where the rising cost of raising children  
Was not a factor and you cant believe the things it does to me  
Im filled with the white noise  
Well I never did much of anything anyway  
Jump on a big train no where  
Chorus  
I wanna buy me a good heart and a conscience  
And maybe raise some children  
I wanna get me a good wife  
And a garden garden garden garden  
Wanna start me a new life with a six foot color television  
Wanna start me a new life somewhere  
I was born on a warm night  
On the right coast of southeastern America  
Dead on arrival but you cant believe the things you hear today  
Ill fly me a white plane over  
Water over blue and green and land in the ocean somewhere  
  
Chorus
