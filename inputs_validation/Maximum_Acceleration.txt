I thought you knew me by now  
Let the lights go on roaring  
Someones hand on my shoulder  
Then whip past the turning point  
Theres time for the taking  
  
Chorus  
Maximum acceleration  
Maximum acceleration  
Maximum acceleration  
  
A face that goes slowly  
A signal close by me  
The landscapes are changing  
And some of us flipped a coin  
And shimmered away  
  
Chorus  
  
You really were aching  
Its turning to twilight  
Moving over and under  
Then a couple of figures  
Shook their heads of the high lines  
  
Chorus
