God said  
Mary  
Pure and  
Holy  
With this  
Baby  
I trust you  
  
She said  
Surly  
Im not  
Worthy  
And it  
Scares me  
But I trust you  
  
Chorus  
Underneath a shining star  
In a manger stall  
Mary held the gift of love  
God gave to us all  
  
Precious  
Baby  
Pure and  
Holy  
Im not worthy  
But I trust you  
  
Chorus  
  
Precious  
Baby  
Pure and  
Holy  
Will you  
Save me  
I trust you  
  
Son of  
Mary  
I trust you
