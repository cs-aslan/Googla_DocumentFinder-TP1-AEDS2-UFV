When the dark is complete  
And the day goes to sleep  
Thats when I come alive  
Faster than shadows  
On the wings of the night Ill be by your side  
  
And my soul spreads wide its raven wings  
And I cover you tonight  
Ooh you wont need no other  
Im your dangerous lover oh babe you know its true  
  
I want to feel you in the dark  
I want to kiss your body  
I want to make you mine  
  
Chorus  
Ride on the wings of the night  
You know you want to  
Ride on the wings of the night  
Youre old enough to  
Ride on the wings of the night  
Im coming for you  
  
And they tell you Im wild  
That Im the devils child  
Ill only make you cry  
They say youre too young to feel  
They say my loves a lie  
  
But they dont know what it does to me  
Just to have you in my arms  
Ill introduce you to lifes forbidden delights  
Ill make you a woman of you  
  
We Ride  
Midnight hearts collide  
Naked alone your bodys mine  
Ooh babe dont say no  
  
Tonight my virgin child come  
I want to feel you in the dark
