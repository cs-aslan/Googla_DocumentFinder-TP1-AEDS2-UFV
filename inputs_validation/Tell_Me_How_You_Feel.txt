If theres anything on your mind Im open  
It theres anything in your heart honey Im open  
But how can I ever be a man  
If you wont open up and let me understand  
Oh oh oh oh yeah  
  
Come on and tell me how you feel  
I really want to know  
If this love is gonna be real  
You gotta let your feeling show  
  
If your backs against the wall Im open  
If youre climbing high and you fall Im open  
Now if you need me to understand  
You know I cant unless you let me in  
Oh oh oh oh yeah  
  
Cause Ive been honest with you  
Theres nothing more I want to do  
I just want to give you my love  
I only want to give you my love  
Yeah take it baby oh oh  
  
Tell me how you feel  
I really want to know  
Tell me how you feel baby  
I really gotta know  
Tell me how you feel baby  
Tell me how you feel  
I really want to know  
I really want to know
