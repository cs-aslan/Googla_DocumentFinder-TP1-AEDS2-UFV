You keep tellin me dont hang around  
While you play around with the clowns that you found  
It aint right  
Now and then I get tired of the sound of you putting me down  
While youre playing the town every night  
Im getting hung up yes I am yes I am  
And you dont give a damn  
  
Chorus  
No you dont  
Have to treat me like a fool  
No you dont  
Have to be so bloody cool  
No you dont  
Have to make up all the rules  
No you dont  
No no you dont  
No you dont  
  
You keep playing your reckless games that will bring you fame  
But Ill take the blame for your name  
  
Well you think youve got my life in your hands  
But you dont understand that Ive got my own plans  
My own plans  
Im going down yes I am yes I am  
And you dont give a damn  
  
Chorus
