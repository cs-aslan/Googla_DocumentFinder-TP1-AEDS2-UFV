Little girl was down by the waterside  
The sun so hot and the roses so red where she lie  
As little boys sit and watch as she twirls all around  
Sunny smiles not a raincloud could bring that girl down  
But now  
  
Whats behind those big brown eyes  
Do you dream at night  
Without your lullaby  
  
Little boy sits alone as he sings in the dark  
Wondering if his own dreams had pulled them apart  
He sings a song of tomorrow he never can see  
Mostly sings of a lost little girls memory  
And now  
  
As his dreams go flashing by  
He begins to hear  
A lonely lullaby  
  
Well now  
We used to sing  
And we used to cry  
Through everything  
In our childrens lullaby  
  
Little girl on the street with nobody around  
Has her head in the air dirty feet on the ground  
She shuts her eyes and wonders if this is a mistake  
Now shes gone from the warmth of her little boy days  
And still  
  
She believes that shell get by  
On her own without  
Her little boys lullaby  
  
Little boy prays to God to answer his song  
To hold her hand when everyone elses are gone  
Time goes by and the wounds slowly turn into scars  
So he makes his final wish on the midnight stars  
And he screams  
  
Little girl wont you hear my cry  
Wont you come back home  
To your lovers lullaby  
  
Little girl down by the waterside  
Goodbye
