I thought of you last night  
I thought of you and thought of you  
Until the morning light  
I couldnt sleep I couldnt sleep last night  
  
I wanted you last night  
I wanted you and wanted you  
And wished with all my might  
Youd come to me youd come to me last night  
  
Darling my darling I cant live without you  
Im lonely so lonely when youre out of sight  
  
Ill wait for tonight  
Ill wait for you and wait for you  
And long to hold you tight  
Bring your love to me your love to me tonight  
  
Ill wait for tonight  
Ill wait for you and wait for you  
And long to hold you tight  
Bring your love to me your love to me tonight  
Bring your love to me your love to me tonight
