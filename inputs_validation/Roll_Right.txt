Lick off the shot my stories shock ya like Ellison  
Main line adrenaline Gaza to Tienanmen  
From the basement Im dwellin in  
I cock back tha sling to stone a settler  
And breaks him off clean call me the upsetter  
Here comes the hands on the leashes  
The cross the capital the pale families the fear and the mouthpieces  
The single sista lynch  
The cell doors crash  
And the masters drums echo echo echo echo echo echo  
Roll right Roll call  
But now were alright were all calm  
Roll right Roll call  
And now were alright were all calm  
  
This hits like fists bomb with the left and dont miss  
With the sickest stilo I spark fear like pigs in the park  
Head crack I hijack the papers  
The vapors caught fire up in your mind  
Come back rewind one time  
Here comes the hands on the leashes  
The cross the capital the pale families the fear and the mouthpieces  
The single sista lynch  
The cell doors crash  
And the masters drums echo echo echo echo echo echo  
Roll right Roll call  
But now were alright were all calm  
Roll right Roll call  
  
We gotta take em to tha seventh level  
We gotta take em to tha seventh level  
For their lives and my lives were never settled  
Come on dont freeze when zero hour comes  
Come on come on dont freeze when zero hour comes  
Come on  
  
Send em to tha seventh level  
Send em to tha seventh level  
Send em to tha seventh level  
Send em to tha seventh level  
For their lives and my lives were never settled
