No matter where I roam  
I will Return to my English rose  
For no bonds can ever tempt me from she  
Ive sailed the seven seas  
Flown the whole blue sky  
But Ive returned with haste to where my  
Love does lie  
No matter where I go I will Return to my English Rose  
For nothing can ever tempt me from she  
Ive searched the secret mists  
Ive climbed the highest peaks  
Caught the wild wind home  
To hear her soft voice speak  
No matter where I roam  
I will return to my English Rose  
For no bonds can ever keep me from she  
  
Ive been to ancient worlds  
Ive scoured the whole universe  
And caught the first train home  
To be at her side  
No matter where I roam  
I will return to my English Rose  
For no bonds nothing and noone can ever keep me from she
