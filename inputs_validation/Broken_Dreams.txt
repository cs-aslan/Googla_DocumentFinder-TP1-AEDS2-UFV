Have you ever had your dreams broken  
It really messes up your heart  
You want to stop right there  
And go right back to the start  
  
You got to leave the town youre living in  
Oh Im leaving Im leaving on the next train  
My dreams have been broken  
I dont think Ill ever be the same  
  
Its a bad bad feeling when all the things  
That youve worked for just dont seem to turn out right  
Well this happened to me last night  
I woke up this morning and said I must be going  
  
You see my dreams have been broken  
I dont think I have  
The strength to carry on  
So Ill catch the next train southbound  
  
I dont want no pity  
Not from you or anyone  
Its just my dreams been broken  
And I got to tell someone before I go crazy  
  
Ill be leaving  
Ill be leaving  
On that next train going southbound  
Yes Ill be leaving on that next train  
  
You see my dreams been broken  
And I just cant  
Take the pain  
Ive got to move on  
  
You see my dreams been broken  
And I dont have  
The strength  
To carry on
