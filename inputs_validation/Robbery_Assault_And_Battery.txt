The streets were deserted though the police were alerted  
They considered the phone call a hoax  
Furtively glancing the jauntily prancing  
The youth caught the guards unaware  
  
Slipping between them he ought to have seen the  
The eyes and their owner so near  
With torch shining bright he strode on in the night  
Till he came to the room with the safe  
  
Hello son I hope youre having fun  
Youve got it wrong Sir Im only the cleaner  
With that he fired the other saying as he died  
Youve done me wrong its the same old song forever  
  
Robbery assault and battery  
The felon and his felony  
  
He picked up the diamonds and bundles of fivers  
He pushed them well down in his sack  
But the alarm had been sounded he was completely surrounded  
  
But he had some more tricks up his sleeve  
  
Come outside with your hands held high  
Youll not get me alive Sir I promise you that Sir  
With that he fired the other saying as he died  
Youve done me wrong its the same old song forever  
  
Robbery assault and battery  
The felon and his felony  
  
Hes leaving via the roof the bastards got away  
God always fights on the side of the bad man  
  
Ive got clean away but Ill be back some day  
Just the combination will have changed  
Some day theyll catch me to a chain theyll attach me  
But until that day Ill side the old crime wave  
  
If they try to hold me for trial  
Ill stay out of jail by paying my bail  
And after Ill go to the court of appeal saying  
Youve done me wrong its the same old song forever
