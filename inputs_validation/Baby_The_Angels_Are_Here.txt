No smoke without fire  
If the sky was light  
And the moon shine brightly  
Then wed be away tonight  
Better chance be taken  
Than love forsaken  
This aint no mistake that Im making  
  
Baby the angels are here  
Brought me a Bible and a gun  
Baby I wanted to stay with you  
But theyre saying Id better run  
Cause heavens a footstep away  
  
Well I was hoping to make it  
Sometimes you put it together  
Before you try  
Let it take its course  
Because you just cant force it  
And I dont want to break down and cry  
  
Baby the angels are here  
Brought me a Bible and a gun  
Baby I wanted to stay with you  
But theyre saying Id better run  
Cause heavens a footstep away
