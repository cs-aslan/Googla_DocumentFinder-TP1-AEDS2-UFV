To lead a better life I need my love to be here  
Here making each day of the year  
Changing my life with the wave of her hand  
Nobody can deny that theres something there  
  
There running my hands through her hair  
Both of thinking how good it can be  
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there  
  
I want her everywhere and if shes beside me I know Id need never care  
But to love her is to need her  
  
Everywhere knowing that love is to share  
Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there  
  
I want her everywhere and if shes beside me I know Id need never care  
But to love her is to need her  
  
Everywhere knowing that love is to share  
Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there  
  
To be there and everywhere Here there and everywhere
