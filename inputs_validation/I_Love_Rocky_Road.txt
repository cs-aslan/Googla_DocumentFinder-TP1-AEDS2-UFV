I hear those ice cream bells and I start to drool  
Keep a couple quarts in my locker at school  
Yeah but chocolates gettin old  
Vanilla just leaves me cold  
  
Theres just one flavor good enough for me yeah me  
Dont gimme no crummy taste spoon  
I know what I need  
  
Baby I love rocky road  
So wont ya go and buy half a gallon baby  
I love rocky road  
So have another triple scoop with me ow  
  
They tell me ice cream junkies are all the same  
All the soda jerkers know my name  
When their supply is gone  
Then Ill be movin on  
  
But Ill be back on Monday afternoon youll see  
Another truck loads comin in for me all for me

I love rocky road  
So wont ya go and buy half a gallon baby  
I love rocky road  
So have another triple scoop with me ow  
  
Oh make it talk  
  
When Im all alone I just grab myself a cone  
And if I get fat and loose my teeth thats fine with me  
Just lock me in the freezer and throw away the key  
Sing it  
  
I love rocky road  
So wont ya go and buy half a gallon baby  
I love rocky road  
So have another triple scoop with me
