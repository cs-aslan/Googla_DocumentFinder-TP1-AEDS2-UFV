Love hurts  
Love scars love wounds and mars  
  
Any heart not touched  
or strong enough  
can take a lot of pain  
Take a lot of pain  
Love is like a cloud  
Holds a lot of rain  
Love hurts  
Love hurts  
  
Im young I know  
But even so  
I know a thing or two  
Ive learned from you  
  
I really learned a lot  
Really learned a lot  
Love is like a stove  
Burns you when its hot  
Love hurts  
Love hurts  
  
Some fools rave of happiness  
Blissfulness togetherness  
Some fools fool themselves I guess  
But theyre not fooling me  
  
I know it isnt true  
Know it isnt true  
Love is just a lie  
Made to make you blue  
Love hurts  
Love hurts  
Love hurts
