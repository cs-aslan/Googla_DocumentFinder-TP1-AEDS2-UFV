The perfume that she wore was from some little store  
On the down side of town  
But it lingered on long after shed gone  
I remember it well  
And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light  
And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night  
Her long flowing hair came softly undone  
And it lay all around  
And she brushed it down as I stood by her side  
In the warmth of her love  
And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin  
And we played a game only she could win  
And she told me a riddle Ill never forget  
Then left with the answer Ive never found yet  
How long said she Can a moment like this  
Belong to someone  
Whats wrong what is right when to live or to die  
We must almost be born  
So if you should ask me what secrets I hide  
Im only your lover dont make me decide  
The perfume that she wore was from some little store  
On the down side of town  
But it lingered on long after shed gone  
I remember it well  
And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin  
And we played a game only she could win  
And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light  
And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night
