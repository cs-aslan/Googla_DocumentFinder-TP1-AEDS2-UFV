You have this way of dipping in and out of  
Sight as things collide  
Bridges burning softly in the night  
And you have this way of falling in and out of  
Time as it goes by  
Passing silently with no goodbye  
  
And Ive spoken with all the other angels  
They dont know what to do  
And I agree with them wholeheartedly I do  
  
Telegram came today from a friend  
Saying Where in the hell have you been  
Where are you goin   
I said I dont know does the loneliness show  
And if so does it ever end   
  
And Ive spoken with all the other angels  
They dont know what to do  
And I agree with them wholeheartedly I do  
  
You have this way of meaning everything and nothing to me  
At the same time  
Returning my hellos with goodbyes  
  
Cause Ive spoken with all the other angels  
They dont know what to do  
And I agree with them wholeheartedly I do  
  
Cause Ive spoken with all the other angels  
They dont know what to do  
And I agree with them wholeheartedly I do  
  
And Ive spoken with all the other angels  
They dont know what to do  
And I agree with them wholeheartedly I do
