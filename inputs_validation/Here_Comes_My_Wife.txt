Well here comes my wife  
And thats the story of my life  
She haunts me though she dont want me  
She follows badly in disguise  
But its not hard to recognize her cause shes cryin  
She looks like dyin on me  
  
Her fathers rich I think a millionaire  
But money doesnt make him better  
It just makes him better to be there  
So you can tell him that its quite alright with me  
No no its quite alright with me  
  
Well here comes my wife  
And thats the story of my life

Shes coming up behind me

But I tell her that its quite alright no no its quite alright with me
