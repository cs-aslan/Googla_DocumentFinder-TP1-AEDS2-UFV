And if I die today Ill be the happy phantom  
And Ill go chasin the nuns out in the yard  
And Ill run naked through the streets without my mask on  
And I will never need umbrellas in the rain  
Ill wake up in Strawberry Fields every day  
And the atrocities of school I can forgive  
The happy phantom has no right to bitch  
  
Oo who  
The time is getting closer  
Oo who  
Time to be a ghost  
Oo who  
Every day were getting closer  
The sun is getting dim  
Will we pay for who we been  
  
So if I die today Ill be the happy phantom  
And Ill go wearin my naughties like a jewel  
Theyll be my ticket to the universal opera  
Theres Judy Garland taking Buddha by the hand  
And then these seven little men get up to dance  
They say Confucius does his crossword with a pen  
Im still an angel to a girl who hates to sin  
  
Oo who  
  
Or will I see you dear and wish I could come back  
You found a girl that you could truly love again  
Will you still call for me when she falls asleep  
Or do we soon forget the things we cannot see  
  
Oo who
