See that mountain Im gonna have to climb  
Well theres a river waitin on the other side  
And the road leading nowhere Ill take it for I must  
Hes somewhere tomorrow or Ill bust  
You can go along with me and be my friend  
Or you can stay and wish youd gone alone  
And you can follow me in postcard that Ill send  
But by the time you enter Ill be gone  
Life is a circle spinning round  
Searching for what you havent found  
I leave today to look for my tomorrow  
Tomorrow Ill come searching for today  
 acguitar   
See that mountain Im gonna have to climb  
I dont know that Id be coming back this way  
But if you stay and Id come back someday  
Then Ill teach you the lessons that Ive learned  
And Ill build back the bridges that Ive burned  
Life is a circle spinning round  
Yeah tomorrow Ill come searching for today
