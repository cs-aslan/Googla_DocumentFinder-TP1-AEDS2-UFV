Meet me under the mistletoe  
Midnight Christmas Eve  
Your sweet kiss is the first gift  
Id like to receive  
The presents that we bought  
Will have to wait beneath the tree  
Meet me under the mistletoe  
Midnight Christmas Eve  
  
Theres frost on all the windows  
Candles burning bright  
Stockings on the mantle  
Everythings just right  
Soon the house will come alive  
With family and friends  
Id love some time alone with you  
Before it all begins  
  
Meet me under the mistletoe  
Midnight Christmas Eve  
Your sweet kiss is the first gift  
Id like to receive  
The presents that we bought  
Will have to wait beneath the tree  
Meet me under the mistletoe  
Midnight Christmas Eve  
  
It seems Ive hardly seen you  
Weve had so much to do  
With the holiday approaching  
Ive sure been missing you  
I cant wait till Christmas morn  
To hold you in my arms  
Im feeling like a kid again  
Waiting on Santa Clause  
  
Meet me under the mistletoe  
Midnight Christmas Eve  
Your sweet kiss is the first gift  
Id like to receive  
The presents that we bought  
Will have to wait beneath the tree  
Meet me under the mistletoe  
Midnight Christmas Eve
