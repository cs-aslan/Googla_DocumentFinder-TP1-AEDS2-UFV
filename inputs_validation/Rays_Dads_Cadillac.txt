Rays Dads Cadillac  
Rollin past the rink  
Past the record shack  
Pink fins in the falling rain  
Rollin  
To the blue lights past the water mains  
  
Rays Dads Cadillac  
Weekends wed get  
Rays Dads Cadillac  
Rock n roll in the dashboard  
Romance in the back of  
Rays Dads Cadillac  
  
Rays dad teaches math  
Zero  
Im a dunce  
Im a decimal in his class  
Last nights kisses wont erase  
Zero  
I just cant keep the numbers in their place  
  
Rays Dads Cadillac  
Last night we had  
Rays Dads Cadillac  
Rock n roll in the dashboard  
Romance in the back of  
Rays Dads Cadillac  
  
When it comes to mathematics  
I got static in the attic  
No sir nothins clear  
Ill be blackboard blind on Monday  
Dreamin of blue runways  
On the edge of here  
A little atmosphere  
  
Blue lights out on airport road  
Motown in a field in a farmers grove  
Big planes comin overhead  
Lowdown  
You can see the bolts  
You can see the tire treads  
  
Rays Dads Cadillac  
Weekends wed get  
Rays Dads Cadillac  
Oh little darlin  
Rock n roll in the dashboard  
Romance in the back of  
Rays Dads Cadillac  
  
Rays Dads Cadillac  
Rays Dads Cadillac
