My heart was a playground where you played about  
When you got through playin you just walked out  
I thought when you left me that Id lose my mind  
But now Ive forgotten with a healer like time  
They said Id forget you I thought they were wrong  
I thought for a lifetime my love would be strong  
But now Ive forgotten and youre out of my mind  
Oh Im so thankful for a healer like time  
  
I used to remember the dreams that we knew  
When your life was my life your thoughts were mine too  
But since we have parted Ive forgotten by far  
Oh Im so thankful for a healer like time
