To be someone must be a wonderful thing  
A famous footballer a rock singer  
Or a big film star yes I think that I would like  
I would like that  
To be rich and have a lot of fans  
And lots of girls to prove that Im a man  
To be number one  and loved by everyone  
  
Getting drugged up with my trendy friends  
They really dig me man and I dig them  
And the money that I spend it is like my fame and its quickly gone  
  
No more swimming in my guitar shaped pool  
No more reporters at my beck and call  
No more cocaine now its only ground chalk  
And I cant afford a taxi so I have to walk  
  
Didnt I have a nice time  
Wasnt it sucha nice time  
Didnt I have a nice time  
  
I realize I should have stuck to my guns  
You stood me out just like a bastard son  
And I lost myself but I know that it was wrong  
And it cost me a lot  
  
No more drinking cause now the club shuts down  
And Im out here on my arse with the rest of you clowns  
I get really scared without my bodyguard  
And Im sitting all alone in my expensive yard  
  
Didnt I have a nice time  
Wasnt it such a nice time  
Didnt I have a nice time  
Wasnt it such a nice time  
I remember it was a nice time  
To be someone must be a wonderful thing
