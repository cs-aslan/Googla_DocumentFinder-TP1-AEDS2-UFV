Lake Tahoe  
Cold mountain water Dont ever swim there  
Just stand on the edge and look in there  
And you might see a woman down there  
  
They say some days up she comes up she rises as if out of nowhere  
Wearing Victorian dress  
She was calling her pet Snowflake Snowflake  
Tumbling like a cloud that has drowned in the lake  
  
Just like a poor porcelain doll  
Her eyes are open but noones home  
The clock has stopped  
So long shes gone  
  
Noones home  
Her old dog is sleeping  
His legs are frail now  
But when he dreams  
  
He runs  
Along long beaches and sticky fields  
Through the Spooky Wood looking for her  
The beds are made The table is laid  
  
The door is open  someone is calling Its a woman  
Here boy here boy Youve come home  
Ive got an old bone and a biscuit and so much love  
Miss me Did you miss me  
  
Heres the kitchen  Theres your basket  
Heres the hall  Thats where you wait for me  
Heres the bedroom  Youre not allowed in there  
Heres my lap  Thats where you lay your head  
  
Here boy oh youre a good boy  
Youve come home  
Youve come home
