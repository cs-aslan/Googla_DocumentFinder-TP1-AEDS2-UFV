I dont live anymore  
I dont love me this way  
I dont have wings to fly  
I dont have gone away  
I dont have anything  
I dont need a space to breathe  
I dont hide in sanctity  
I dont need what you need  
I dont have have a space to go  
  
I dont claim to know just why  
I dont try to pacify  
I dont love me just yet  
I dont care gone away  
  
This ones mine  
This ones mine  
This ones mine  
All mine  
Not this time I wont deny  
This ones mine  
All this time  
Not this time I wont deny  
All this time yes its mine  
Not this time I wont deny  
This ones  
  
I dont have anything  
I dont need the space to breathe  
I dont hide in sanctity  
I dont need what you need  
I dont haveI dont have  
I dont haveI dont have  
I dont have anything  
I dont need the space to breathe  
I dont hide in sanctity  
I dont need what you need  
  
I dont haveI dont have  
I dont haveI dont have
