No heartaches felt no longer lonely  
Heights of waiting finally won me  
Happiness thats all rolled up in you  
  
And now with you as inspiration  
I look toward a destination  
Sunny bright that once before was blue  
  
I have no more than I did before  
But now Ive got all that I need  
For I love you and I know you love me  
  
So take my hand Ill start my journey  
Free from all the helpless worry  
That besets a man when hes alone  
  
For strength is mine when were together  
And with you I know Ill never  
Have to pass the high road for the low  
  
I have no more than I did before  
But now Ive got all that I need  
Cause I love you and I know you love me  
Yes I love you and I know you love me
