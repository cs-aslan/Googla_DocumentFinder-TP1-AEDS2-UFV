She know you bad  
You dont sing songs of love  
She treats you right she treats you like a web of love  
You know whos of the heart her notions of societies  
You belong to know and just like our sophiaties  
Chorus  
Modern eyes  
Modern eyes to see what you want to see  
Modern eyes  
Modern eyes shell paint you with the modern eyes  
What you look for in people is not hard to recognize  
Black man white man short man  
Theyre all the same in size  
You breath the air you feel the sea and the sand and the skies  
When nighttime comes you blind men with modern eyes  
Repeat chorus  
Shell paint you with the hupskin on  
Shell paint you with the fire in your eyes  
Shell paint you with the modern eyes  
Repeat chorus
