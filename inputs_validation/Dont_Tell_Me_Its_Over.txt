Its in your eyeshere we go again  
Tonight youre gonna come on strong  
Such a cryin shamethe time we spend  
Over whos been right and whos been wrong  
  
Therell be no pretending this time  
Your eyes are like fire  
Youll swear its the end of the line  
But you and I we both know youre a liar  
  
Chorus  
Dont tell me that its over  
Dont tell me that were through  
Dont tell me that its over  
Dont try and tell me that its over  
It isnt true  
Dont tell me that its over  
Cause you cant say goodbye any more  
Than I can walk away from you  
  
You say its hard to love a man like me  
But baby now and then  
You do your fair share so easily  
You can push me to my limit  
And back again  
  
Just when I cant take anymore  
And Ive made up my mind  
I say Im ready to walk out the door  
But somethin keeps me from leavin you behind  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a reason why  
After weve tried  
Were not runnin to the arms of another  
  
When all comes down  
We both know by now  
We just still mean too much to each other  
  
Dont tell me  
Dont tell me  
Dont tell me its over
