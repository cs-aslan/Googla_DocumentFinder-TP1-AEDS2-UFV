Round and round  
And we wont let go  
And where we stop  
No one knows  
Uhhuh uhhuh  
  
Down and down  
In a spin we turn  
Looking like  
Well never learn  
Uhhuh uhhuh  
  
Think about  
What evryone is saying  
Ruby dear  
Oh dont you hear  
  
Late at night  
When the radio is playing  
Ruby dear  
So looky here  
  
Oh this records broken  
It slips a beat  
And all those watermelons  
Have gone to seed  
  
Nothing lives  
In this dirty little river  
No one here  
Will shed a tear  
  
It dried up  
But it couldnt run forever  
Ruby dear  
Thats what we hear  
  
I still like the ocean  
Down by the sea  
They left that door wide open  
It tempted me  
Hounding me  
From the bedroom to the kitchen  
  
Ruby dear  
Im still right here  
Now they threw  
The fox amongst the chickens  
Its too deep  
Ill drown in my sleep  
  
Angels and prostitutes  
They might look the same  
And if to Hell were going  
Ill see you there  
  
Round and round  
And we wont let go  
And where we stop  
No one knows  
Uhhuh uhhuh  
  
Down the street  
Where the bonfires glow  
Looking like  
They lost control  
Uhhuh uhhuh  
  
Settle down  
In that rocking chair  
Breathing in  
That rotten air  
Uhhuh uhhuh  
  
Johnny Jones  
Fell fast asleep  
Down a hole  
Where the rocks are steep  
Uhhuh uhhuh
