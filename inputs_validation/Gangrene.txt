If its dangerous illegal sick strange or obscene  
You can get it from the man if your money is green  
He says You can have it  
He knows once you get it  
You wont be satisfied  
But the things that my brothers try to do to their brains  
The thought makes my blood begin to boil in my veins  
But its a case of We want it right when we want it  
They cant be satisfied  
Gangrene dying one inch at a time  
Gangrene sell your freedom by minutes  
Flesh by the pound  
I got a mind of my own and I need to enjoy  
Something that the mercenaries cant destroy  
I dont know where to find it but til I get it  
I cant be satisfied  
So we take to the road like a thief on the run  
Regroup underground and find our own kind of fun  
But seems whenever we find it  
Somebody buys it  
We cant be satisfied  
Gangrene dying one inch at a time  
Gangrene thats all the vampires leave behind  
Fifty million kids with nothing better to do  
Than sit around like a zombie and stare at the tube  
Theyll sap your strength and suck your soul and  
Feed you their trash  
Til your mind is left blank  
And your dreams have been smashed
