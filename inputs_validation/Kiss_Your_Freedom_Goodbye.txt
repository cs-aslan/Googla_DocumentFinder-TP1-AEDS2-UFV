I dont read the paper I dont watch the news  
Lifes good in this small town population 62  
Our bank aint been heldup since 1932  
Our doors are always unlocked  
But not for long Im tellin you  
  
Chorus  
cause I know times are gonna change  
I know life will never be the same  
I see please tell me it aint so  
Theyre all movin in surroundin me  
No place left to go  
My oh my you can kiss your freedom goodbye  
  
Used to have a small town drugstore  
Where old men liked to meet  
That stores gone out of business  
Theyre sellin drugs out in the streets  
The new kids like to spray paint  
Theyve got a lot to say  
Sure do have a way with words  
Taught me a few today  
  
Chorus 2  
cause I know times are gonna change  
I know life will never be the same  
I see small town folks like me  
Are gonna have to change the way we do things cause eventually  
My oh my you can kiss your freedom goodbye  
Kiss it goodbye  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus 2
