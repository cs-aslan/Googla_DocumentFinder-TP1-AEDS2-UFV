Times are changing  
Nothing stays the same  
For this jukebox generation  
  
Adhere to fashion  
Like computer games  
Modern day communication  
  
The news hard to take  
Will fade tomorrow  
They are the strong  
Theyll survive  
  
The wild and the young  
They all have their dreams  
The wild and the young  
Theyve got to be free  
The sun never sets  
For souls on the run  
The wild and the young  
  
Yeah  
Hah  
  
Roaring passion  
With no guilt or shame  
Its accepting education yeah  
  
Misbehaving  
No regrets no blame  
With a bold kind of sophistication  
  
So close to the edge  
And high on the wire  
They are not wrong  
Theyre alive  
  
The wild and the young  
They all have their dreams  
The wild and the young  
Theyve got to be free  
The sun never sets  
For souls on the run  
The wild and the young  
  
Ha  
  
So close to the edge  
And high on the wire  
They are not wrong  
Theyre alive  
  
Look out  
  
Wild wild  
The wild and the  
Young yyyyoung  
  
The wild and the young  
They all have their dreams  
The wild and the young  
Theyve got to be free  
The sun never sets  
For souls on the run  
  
The wild and the young  
They all have their dreams  
The wild and the young  
Theyve got to be free  
The sun never sets  
For souls on the run  
The wild and the young  
  
Oh yeah  
  
The wild and the young  
Oh  
  
Right
