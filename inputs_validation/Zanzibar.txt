Ali dances and the audience applauds  
Though hes bathed in sweat he hasnt lost his style  
Ali dont you go downtown  
You gave away another round for free  
  
Me Im just another face at Zanzibar  
But the waitress always serves a secret smile  
Shes waiting out in Shantytown  
Shes gonna pull the curtains down for me for me  
  
Ive got the old mans car  
Ive got a jazz guitar  
Ive got a tab at Zanzibar  
Tonight thats where Ill be Ill be  
  
Rose he knows hes such a credit to the game  
But the Yankees grab the headline every time  
Melodramas so much fun  
In black and white for everyone to see  
  
Me Im trying just to get to second base  
And Id steal it if she only gave the sign  
Shes gonna give the go head  
The inning isnt over yet for me for me  
  
Ive got the old mans car  
Ive got a jazz guitar  
Ive got a tab at Zanzibar  
Tonight thats where Ill be  
  
Tell the waitress Ill come back to Zanzibar  
Ill be hiding in the darkness with my beer  
Shes waiting out in Shantytown  
Shes gonna pull the curtains down for me for me  
  
Ive got the old mans car  
Ive got a jazz guitar  
Ive got a tab at Zanzibar  
Tonight thats where Ill be
