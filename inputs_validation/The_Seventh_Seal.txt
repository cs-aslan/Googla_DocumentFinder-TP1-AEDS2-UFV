Walk me down to the wishing well  
Help me find that miracle  
Splash that holy water on me  
Drown my faith in trinity yeah  
Oh yeah  
Little by little gonna get it I swear  
One more piece of the puzzle Im there  
Gotta get lucky gotta get that done  
Little bit of luck never hurt no one  
Come on take me down down  
Down  
Im in a cold sweat  
Lord dont let me drown drown  
Drown drown  
In mother earths soul yet  
Under darken skies  
Well see the light  
Broken now I cant help but feel  
Someone cracked the seventh seal  
Nothing sacred nothing left  
Unturned  
When nothings simple  
Then nothings learned  
So take me down to the virgin spring  
Wash away my suffering oh  
Splash that holy water on me  
Wash my eyes so I can see  
Come on take me down down down  
Im in a cold sweat  
Yeah dont let me drown drown  
Drown drown  
In mother earths soul not yet  
Lord I think I found found found  
My mother lode hey  
Down down down down down  
Down  
Take me down down down down  
Take me
