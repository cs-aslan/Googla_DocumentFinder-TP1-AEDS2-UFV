What goods a dollar  
Without your baby sister  
Two scoops of ice cream  
On a summer afternoon  
We ran wild  
And all we ever wanted  
Was to rule the world  
Between our house and school  
  
chorus  
We move on  
Put those dreams away  
Thinking that well find them  
Come some rainy day  
  
First time i saw you  
I knew i would love you  
Half way through sophomore year  
I finally asked your name  
When i kissed you  
I lost my heart completely  
All we wanted  
Was just to stay that way  
  
We move on  
Put those dreams away  
Hoping that well find them  
Come some rainy day  
How could i know  
That everything would change  
Except the way i miss you  
Come some rainy day  
  
bridge  
Ill sit and laugh with friends  
At what weve all been through  
But i still catch my breath  
When someone mentions you  
  
repeat chorus
