Well Im married to the good life  
I said Id be a good wife  
When I put on this ring  
I drive a new Mercedes  
I play tennis with the ladies  
I buy all the finer things  
But all that dont mean nothing  
When you cant get a good nights loving  
  
Chorus  
Oh little rock  
Think Im gonna have to slip you off  
Take a chance tonight and untie the knot  
Theres more to life than what Ive got  
Oh little rock  
You know this heart of mine just cant be bought  
Im gonna find someone who really cares a lot  
When I slip off this little rock  
  
Well I wonder if hell miss me  
He doesnt even kiss me  
When he comes home at night  
He never calls me honey  
But he sure loves his money  
And Im the one who pays the price  
But when he finds this ring hell see  
He keeps everything but me  
  
Chorus x2
