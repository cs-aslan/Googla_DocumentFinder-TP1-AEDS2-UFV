Headless Boogie  
Violent J  
Its Friday night dark scary  
Lonely walking through the park cemetery  
And its foggy cold and smoggy  
Hear a dog a howling doggy  
Im scared should of brung the shotgun  
Should of would of but I aint got one  
So I watch my back and whats that  
The caretaker a dirty old hunchback  
Better run hide quick fast  
Hes coming for my ass with a shovel  
No where to run nore to hide but the grave bit  
So I dove in I did the dumb shit  
Took a fall deeper than six foot  
Down the stairs hit a floor and through a door  
Into a whole new world of stiffs  
Bodies heads and sexy little dead chicks  
Club lights sounds bass  
DJs spinnin with maggots on they face  
And what I saw next then really took me  
Uh they did the headless boogie  
Chorus 2x  
Hey yo I heard that you died  
Fuck that its time to get live  
Dead bodies lets all take a ride  
Lean to the left and slide the headless boogie  
Oh yeah we dug up the finest  
Bitches in the graveyard  
So come on down  
And if you aint come to get your funk out  
Then get the fuck out bitch  
Violent J  
They all stand straight and swing to the side  
No heads but they feet still glide  
Take a step back twist and dive  
I even seen Kurt Cobain get live blam  
No heads but they all funky  
And drunk drinking old Spunky  
Dont be shy everyones able  
Hit the floor leave your nugget on the table  
And kickstep and when you do kicks off  
If youre dead your legs might fall off  
The whole time I cant believe  
I cant conceive I dont want to leave  
Im kicking into a freak with no head  
No face but the rest is straight  
Shes with it I hit it like a G  
Her back fell off eww excuse me  
Zombies mummies and Frankenstein  
Drinkin cisco disco dead wine  
Dead stiffs coming through the door  
Head speakers and limbs on the floor  
Im getting drunk I want to be down whats up  
I want to be the headless clown  
They pulled out the jigsaw and got raw  
And that ended it all I did the headless boogie  
Chorus 2x  
Hey yo fuck that voodoo moshing bitch  
You come and freak it with the real dead juggalos  
So come on by and well cut your nugget off  
So you get grave dancing  
Chorus 4x
