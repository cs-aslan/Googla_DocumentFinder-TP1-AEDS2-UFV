Lets run away from life together  
Let me run away from life with you  
Lets run away from life together  
Leave behind the stormy weather  
  
Lets find out what fantasy can do  
Where well go to they cant touch us  
Life is perfect nothing more to do  
Nothing more than well be needin  
  
Life is paradise in Eden  
Eatin grapes and makin love with you  
  
Rest unchanging no more fights  
We wont ever even disagree  
Lets go off into the heavens  
In eternal happiness for free  
  
Nothings wrong no strings attached  
No reason to get crazy never blue  
Nothin from your noisy neighbor  
Nothings new no trial no labor  
Cross the river Jordan hallelue  
  
Rest unchanging no more fights  
We wont ever even disagree  
Lets go off into the heavens  
In eternal happiness for free
