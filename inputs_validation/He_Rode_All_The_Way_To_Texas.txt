A light shines from my window  
I just cant sleep no more  
Lord it hurts so much to be alone  
But the real men never do admit  
That its them that might be wrong  
At least thats what he told me in his song  
  
He rode all the way to Texas  
On an old freight train  
Didnt miss the girl he left behind  
He rode all the way to Texas  
Didnt shed a tear  
Hes lettin you know that hes the movin kind  
  
The freedom that he sings about  
I guess Ill never know  
I just cant shake the guilt or kill the pain  
But he lets me ride when the lights turns low  
Get on board the radio and take a ride to Texas on his train  
  
He rode all the way to Texas  
On an old freight train  
Didnt miss the girl he left behind  
He rode all the way to Texas  
Didnt shed a tear  
Hes lettin you know that hes the movin kind
