A woman is the sweetest thing  
On that we all agree  
But when she gets the wedding band  
A mans no longer free  
  
Thats why Im safe sane and single  
Im on my merry way  
Yes Im safe sane and single  
Thats how Im gonna stay  
  
A wife and husband came upon  
The parting of their ways  
The judge gave her the bank account  
And gave him 90 days  
  
Thats why Im safe sane and single  
Im on my merry way  
Yes Im safe sane and single  
Thats how Im gonna stay  
  
A friend of mine got married  
To a gal named Nellie Gray  
She pawned his watch then sold his car  
And gave his clothes away  
  
Thats why Im safe sane and single  
Im on my merry way  
Yes Im safe sane and single  
Thats how Im gonna stay  
  
I met a gal in Birmingham  
And thereby hangs a tale  
She had a husband doing time  
Another out on bail  
  
Thats why Im safe sane and single  
Im on my merry way  
Yes Im safe sane and single  
Thats how Im gonna stay  
  
Ha ha ha I got one  
  
I courted a gal for 15 years  
Her Pa said we should wed  
If my horse could only cook  
Id marry him instead  
  
Thats why Im safe sane and single  
Im on my merry way  
Yes Im safe sane and single  
Thats how Im gonna stay  
  
Thank God Im safe Thank God Im safe  
Yes Im safe sane and single

Thank God Im safe Thank God Im safe  
Yes Im safe sane and single
