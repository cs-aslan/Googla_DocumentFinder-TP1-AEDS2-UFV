God of the sun  
Dont make me wait till the morning comes  
Light in the sky  
Look me in the eye eye eye eye  
  
Dont keep me waiting around  
Too much longer now  
Dont dont keep me waiting around around around around  
  
When I called you from my river of darkness  
An echo was all that came back  
Saw you wave goodbye  
Down the railroad track  
Sometimes when youre out and all alone  
And you cant find your way back  
Wonder if youll ever make it home  
  
God of the sun  
Ill be around till the days begun  
One sight of your ray  
Takes the night away away away away  
  
Oh but when I walk through that door  
Take my hat and my coat off waiting for you to call  
I tell you not right now lady I got work on my mind  
And Ill talk to you soon  
Always remember  
  
When I called you from my river of darkness  
An echo was all that came back  
I saw you wave goodbye  
Down the railroad track  
Sometimes when youre out and all alone  
And you cant find your way back  
Wonder if well ever make it home  
No more
