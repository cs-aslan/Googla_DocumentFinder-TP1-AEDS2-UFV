And this is my story  
My face the pictures changed  
Do you remember me  
Now Im fighting to breathe  
Its been such a long time  
  
Do you want to come  
Do you want to come  
Do you want to come with me now  
  
Nothing here for me now  
I cant believe the noise  
Well take this place apart  
I wont be here for long  
I know theyll find me soon  
  
But now the weakness comes  
Ill question everything  
Ill trade new dreams for old  
Ive been waiting for you  
Ive waited far too long
