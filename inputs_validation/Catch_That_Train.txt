Well Im drivin onward  
Through the pourin rain  
Theres a ticket waitin  
I gotta catch that train  
The yellow racin dreamboat  
On California air  
Single engine cowboy  
Out in county fair  
So oh baby hurry here to me  
Oh baby come see me  
Oh baby let the hours flee  
Oh baby come see  
The silver clouds in August  
Lovers names on trees  
Imagine running water  
You wadin in knee deep  
So oh baby hurry here to me  
Oh baby come see me  
Oh baby let the hours flee  
Oh baby come see  
Theres a world waitin  
Just for you to unfold  
How are you to know  
If you dont see if you dont see  
Those yellow racin dreamboats  
On California air  
Theres a ticket waitin  
I guess Ill catch you there  
I guess Ill catch you there  
So oh baby hurry here to me  
Oh baby come see me  
Oh baby let the hours flee  
Oh baby come see  
If you dont come Oh baby hurry here to me  
Oh baby come see me  
If you dont come Oh baby let the hours flee  
Oh baby come see  
If you dont come Oh baby hurry here to me  
Oh baby come see me  
If you dont come Oh baby let the hours flee  
Oh baby come see  
If you dont come
