I breach your life  
Indoctrinate  
Police your thoughts  
Ask why I hate  
  
I lose control  
When I see your face  
Abusing power  
I infiltrate  
  
Continue lies  
Then masturbate  
I walk the line  
Ill do no time  
  
I hate your church  
Ill burn your state  
A bleeding heart  
A seal of fate  
  
There is no crime  
Within my mind  
  
Ill sell your life and preach your death  
A wicked plan born of contempt  
Bleeding my ideology through pain  
  
Audacious plans  
I calculate  
A new world view  
Ill reinstate  
  
Dont cross my path  
Or Ill see you burn  
Youll meet your end  
Find death alone  
  
No grave to mark  
The seeds youve sown  
Youve pushed too far  
My secrets I defend  
  
Ill sell your life and preach your death  
A wicked plan born of contempt  
Bleeding my ideology through pain  
  
Demonize what is feared profane architect  
Skull and bones through the mind  
Barbaric thoughts of old  
Celebrate all unknown  
  
At last the head await  
The die is cast for the meek  
Inherit endless dead time  
Smell the victim are near  
  
Consume the catalyst  
Hunting masses for game  
Implanting septic thoughts  
Reaping terror through words while  
  
Armed behind your back  
Pseudo leaders betray  
Enslaving all of mankind  
Cast out the Demi God  
  
Dethrone the demagogue  
Cast out the church God  
I command your life  
And I dont care  
  
Let bullets rain  
From everywhere  
No suicide  
Will save you from yourself
