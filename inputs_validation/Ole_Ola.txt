When the blue shirts run out in Argentina  
Our hearts will be beating like a drum  
And your nerves are so shattered you cant take it  
Automatically you reach out for the run  
But there really isnt any cause for panic  
Allys army had it all under control  
Its not merely speculations  
Its not just imagination  
To bring the World Cup home is Scotlands goal  
  
Ole ola Ole ola  
Were gonna bring that World Cup back from over there  
Ole ola Ole ola  
Were gonna bring that World Cup back from over there  
  
We got Dalglish Buchan and Macari  
We got Archie Gemmill Johnstone and McQueen  
We got Big Joe Jordan waiting at the middle and the best support  
This world has ever seen  
We got Donachie Rioch and Don Masson  
We got Andy Gray and Asa Hartford too  
And with this lethal combination its a fair estimation  
That the World Cup will be ours the end of June  
  
Ole ola Ole ola  
Were gonna bring that World Cup back from over there  
Ole ola Ole ola  
Were gonna bring that World Cup back from over there  
  
Oh Brazil this time I dont think so  
Holland without Cruyff just aint the same  
Germany will we feel be a challenge  
The Italians can still play the game  
But theres really only one team in it  
Well be singing as well get off of the plane  
We are bound for Buenos Aires we dont care just what they tell us  
Only wish we had Danny McGrain  
  
Ole ola Ole ola  
Were gonna bring that World Cup back from over there  
Willie Johnstone then it goes to Dalglish Lou Macari supporting Theres on
opener defended by Buchan theres Kenny Dalglish in there Oh what a goal
Oh yes That does it  
Theyll be singing up there in Aberdeen and Dundee  
Glasgow will be reaching fever pitch  
Cause with a nation of five million were gonna really turn the heat on  
Cause we invented football anyway
