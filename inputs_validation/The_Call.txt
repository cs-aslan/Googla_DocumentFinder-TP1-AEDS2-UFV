It felt so bad that Im in pain  
Then why dont I say no not again  
Your love has failed and alls gone sour  
You have to see her every hour  
When you cant sleep your mind is blank  
But you dont love no longer thinks  
You lose the grip you thought you had  
She smiles at you but you are sad  
So if then heaven sees in you  
Then suddenly its over through  
You take your life into your hands  
Forgetting all your other plans  
  
And your so sad you cut your wrists  
And they can show you what they missed  
You labor now a point in pain  
But will your worst day ever end  
When you lose or when youve gained  
Dont give up Dont start again  
Your feelings burned like forest wood  
You take youre life youre gone for good  
Youll miss her bed but not her brains  
There is no need to mention names  
My reasons strong that all has failed  
Your face is blue youre looking pale  
Love can kill you suck you down  
Suicidal up  side down  
Loves a mystery to us all  
So dont be mistaken what a call  
  
Remember when we used to fight  
And fists would fly throughout the night  
Your face is filled with cherry blood  
And so I feel my time has come  
You tore me from the world I knew  
And suddenly its finished through  
Your feelings burned like forest wood  
You take youre life youre gone foor good  
  
Youll miss her bed but not her brains  
There is no need to mention names  
My reasons strong that all has failed  
Your face is blue youre looking pale
