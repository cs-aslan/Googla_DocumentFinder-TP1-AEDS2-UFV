When I think back to the  
first time in my childhood  
When I saw that face  
I thought right then  
Thats a real good looking boy  
  
I saw myself in the mirror  
in profile  
for the first time  
I thought  
Hey Thats a real good looking boy  
  
And I felt then  
that I moved  
With all those lucky bucks and angels  
High in the theatre  
In the sky  
  
So I ran to my mother  
I said  
Mom take a look at me  
Have you ever seen a teen  
Fly so high  
  
Thats a real good looking boy  
Thats a real good looking boy  
  
She said  
Son well you know  
youre an ugly boy  
You dont really look like him  
  
In this long line  
Theres been some  
real strange genes  
Youve got em all  
Youve got em all  
With some extras thrown in  
  
Thats a real good looking boy  
Thats a real good looking boy  
Thats a real good looking boy  
Thats a real good looking boy  
  
Wise men say  
Only fools only fools rush in  
But I I cant help  
Falling in love in love with you  
  
Now Im here with you little darling  
And you say Youre beautiful as you are  
And Ive managed somehow to survive  
  
You arrived in my life like a fragrance  
You helped me find a way to laugh  
Now I know where my socalled beauty lies  
  
God gave him a face  
Then he gave me something above  
God gave me a grace  
Then he gave me your sweet sweet sweet love  
  
You make me feel like Im a real good looking boy  
I feel Im a real good looking boy  
Thats a real good looking boy  
Thats a real good looking boy
