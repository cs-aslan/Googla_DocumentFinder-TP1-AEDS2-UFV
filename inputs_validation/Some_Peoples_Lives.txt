Some peoples lives run down like clocks  
One day they stop and thats all theyve got  
Some lives wear out like old tennis shoes  
no one can use Well Its sad but its true  
  
Didnt anybody tell them  
Didnt anybody see  
Didnt anybody love them  
like you love me  
  
Some peoples lives fade like their dreams  
too tired to rise too tired to sleep  
Some people laugh when they need to cry  
and they never know why  
  
Didnt anybody tell them  
thats not how it used to be  
Didnt anybody love them  
like you love me  
  
Some people ask if the tears have to fall  
Then why take your chances Why bother at all  
And some peoples lives are as cold as their lips  
They just need to be kissed  
  
Doesnt anybody tell them  
Doesnt anybody see  
Doesnt anybody love them  
like you love me  
Cause thats all they need
