Im the one that brings you war  
Infiltrate unguarded shores  
Master of afflicting pain  
Point is where all die  
  
Im the one to taste your blood  
Trashing though the crimson mud  
Messenger of all demise  
Point is where I reign  
Piercing impaling no judgment just punishment  
Discrete annihilate assault with no regret  
Im the one to taste your death  
Basking in your dying breath  
Messenger of all demise  
Point is where all die  
Piercing impaling no judgment just punishment  
Discrete annihilate assault with no regret  
Born to kill sweep and clear  
Staring down the face of fear  
Shrapnel flies dehumanize  
Flesh and blood will fertilize  
Empty all the magazines  
Lethal spray from M16s  
Pace the march and sing the song  
Right the fuck where I belong  
Stained in blood  
  
No fear no sound  
Penetrate your holy ground  
Leave you where your comrades lie  
Point is where all die  
Pure destruction has begun  
Fearlessly the battles won  
Spread extinction through the dawn  
Signature of wrath is spawned  
Minister of death unleashed  
My lust for war will never cease  
With no remorse I watch you die  
Body counts the bottom line  
Crashing slashing to the end  
Your final pulse has just been spent  
Leave you where your comrades lie  
Point is where all fucking die  
  
Crashing slashing to the end  
Your final pulse has just been spent  
Leave you where your comrades lie  
Stained in blood  
No fear no pain no life  
  
Clouded skies rain only death  
Silence all opposing threats  
Quench the hunger of my gun  
Exploding cities overrun  
Im the one to taste your death  
Basking in your dying breath  
Messenger of all demise  
Point is where all die
