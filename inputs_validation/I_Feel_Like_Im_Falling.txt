Standing tall in this wide space  
Getting lost in Your embrace  
I see a fire burning brighter  
Its calling me to catch the flame  
  
I feel like Im falling over and over in love with You  
Its not just a feeling but I know that He is real  
I feel like Im falling into the arms of a mighty God  
Its not just a feeling but I know that He is real  
  
Youre drawing me closer to Your side  
Its the safest place I know where to hide  
With one glance You captured my heart  
You speak Your words and set me apart  
  
I feel like Im falling I feel like Im falling  
I feel like Im falling falling into the arms of love
