I have dreamed that your arms are lovely  
And I have dreamed what a joy youll be  
I have dreamed every word youll whisper  
When youre close close to me  
  
How you look in the glow of evening  
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view  
In these dreams Ive loved you so  
That by now I think I know  
What its like to be loved by you  
I will love being loved by you  
  
In these dreams Ive loved you so  
That by now I think I know  
What its like to be loved by you  
I will love being loved by you
