Dont eat green meat it aint good for you  
You know it killed your brother killed your sister too  
Even fresh fried chicken on newmown sand  
Cant beat red beans eaten outa your hand  
Oh Mabel Mabel You know I love you gal but Im not able  
Mabel oh Mabel please get off the kitchen table  
Dont slice no onions dont peel no grape  
Dream about banana slice nor sniff around short cake  
And if on a winters day you find your sundials wrong  
Youll know the weather is whats brought it on  
Oh Mabel Mabel You know I love you gal but Im not able  
Mabel oh Mabel please get off the kitchen table  
Put the peas in the pot put the pot on the hot  
In the cellar lies my wife in my wife theres a knife  
So tote that hammer lift that pick  
And banish inhibition with a pogo stick  
Oh Mabel Mabel You know I love you gal but Im not able  
Mabel oh Mabel please get off the kitchen table
