Looking down on a junior cowboy  
I see myself at the end of each day  
Im feeling sad somehow  
My rumble tumble days are over now  
Took loopy loo to a paper hat party  
And fought the kid who tried to take her away  
Im feeling sad somehow  
My rumble tumble days are over now  
Running awayyou dont knowyou dont care  
Funny the way that we change  
Playing spoof at the back of the schoolyard  
With no thought for the rest of the day  
Im feeling sad somehow  
cause my rumble tumble days are over now
