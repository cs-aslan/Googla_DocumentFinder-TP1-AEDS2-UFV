Id walk across Kansas in a New York minute  
Climb the Colorado mountains in the fall  
Crawl through Arizona like a flatland lizard  
If I thought itd do me any good at all  
I could swim Lake Erie with my hands tied behind me  
Eat a West Virginia coal miners shoes  
Drink the Mississippi River if it took a month of Sundays  
Just to prove my love for you  
I remember well the first time that I kissed you  
Cause the things aint been the same ever since  
You got me thinkin I could eat a ten penny nail And spit out a barbed wire
fence  
Now there aint a livin creature gonna ever come between us  
Id fight lions snakes and gorillas too  
And if that aint enough  
Well start all over just to prove my love for you  
I could ride my pony through the eye of a hurricane  
Climb Mount Everest on a string  
Jump Niagara Falls in a burnin barrel  
And bring you back a hoop smoke ring  
Wrestle alligators in the Okefenokee  
Theres nothin I wouldnt do  
If you just say the word Ill catch  
That Great Speckled Bird and bring it back to you  
I remember well the first time  
Id walk across Kansas in a New York minute
