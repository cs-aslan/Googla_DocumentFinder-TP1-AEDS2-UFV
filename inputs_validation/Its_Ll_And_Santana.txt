My 12th album launched

Theres only one God  
Victory is all I want lets go  
  
Ah one two and uh ah one two and uh  
Juelz its LL and Santana  
Ah one two and uh ah one two and uh

You witnessin history  
  
To my homies who get it and get it the fast way  
To my ladies who get it and get it so nasty  
To my baby mommas that like it real flashy  
Cant wait to smash me all they do is harass me  
  
Check it I stay in smoke filled Benzes  
Dont see nothin you know the whole worlds tinted  
OZM so popo dont sing sing  
My license and registration is good go check it  
  
It cost to be the boss it cost for me to floss  
Of course you see the frost got diamonds on my neck  
Im the big skipper big dipper big pot  
Big whipper just watch big rocks big flipper you dig  
  
Big money big spender big getter  
Big hustler big grinder do you get the big picture you dig  
This is a club banger trunk hopper  
Block rocker rude boy top shotter

My Midwest slabbers you dig  
Ay yup yup this is for my East Coast slangers  
My West Coast bangers you dig  
  
Ah one two and uh ah one two and uh  
Juelz its LL and Santana  
Ah one two and uh ah one two and uh  
Juelz its LL and Santana  
You witnessin history  
  
To my homies who get it and get it the fast way  
To my ladies who get it and get it so nasty  
To my baby mommas that like it real flashy  
Cant wait to smash me all they do is harass me

Juvey hustle harder Birdman you still boring  
Chchchoppin the scrub with my gold rims
