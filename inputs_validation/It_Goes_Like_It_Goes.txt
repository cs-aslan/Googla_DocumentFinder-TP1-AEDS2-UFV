Aint no miracle being born  
People doin it everyday  
It aint no miracle growing up ah  
People just grow that way  
  
So it goes like it goes  
Like the river flows  
And time it rolls right on  
And maybe whats good gets a little bit better  
And maybe whats bad gets gone  
  
Ah bless the child of a working man  
She knows too soon who she is  
And bless the hands of a working man  
Oh he knows his soul is his  
  
So it goes like it goes  
Like the river flows  
And time it rolls right on  
And maybe whats good gets a little bit better  
And maybe whats bad gets gone  
  
So it goes like it goes  
Like the river flows  
And time keeps rolling right on oh  
And maybe whats good gets a little bit better  
And maybe whats bad gets gone
