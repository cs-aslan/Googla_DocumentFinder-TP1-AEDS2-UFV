Well the record companys goin out of business  
They price the records too damn high  
And the boys in the band could use some assistance  
  
Well the record companys goin out of business  
They price the records too damn high  
And the boys in the band could use some assistance  
Get a daytime job just to get by  
Well the PDs they wont play the record  
Theyre too worried about that book  
And the DJs they all hate the song  
But theyre in love with the hook  
  
Chorus  
So nananananananana  
I bet youve heard this song before  
Nananananananana  
Take your cocaine and hit the door  
  
Well folk rock punk rock power pop music  
Turned out to be the latest trends  
And ther aint no more progressive music  
The business has put it to an end  
Ol Rolling Stone has gathered some moss  
No they aint what they used to be  
They try to look like Look with their political pages  
And advertising all over TV  
  
Chorus
