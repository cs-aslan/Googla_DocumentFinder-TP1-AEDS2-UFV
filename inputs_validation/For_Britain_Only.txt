We blasted Glasgow  
Invaded France  
Assaulted Sweden  
Took down our pants  
And lovely England  
My little kitten  
Deliriously  
Black widow Billy  
For Britain only  
Only for Britain yeah  
For Britain only  
Only for Britain  
Jumped on the concord  
Aint much for sittin  
I told my boys now  
No public spiting  
No bar room fighting  
No bad head splitting  
Behave yourself cause were were back in Britain  
For Britain only  
Only for Britain  
Cost six years of time and space  
It took so long to change his face  
To redesign his streamline face  
Now strong and sleek but still no taste  
Guilty  
Im guilty  
Wont go to Hungary  
Iran is out  
Welcome to Moscow huh  
I have my doubts  
Cant get near Libya  
That boys insane  
Lets head for London  
Where we can scream again  
For Britain only  
Only for Britain yeah  
For Britain only  
Only for Britain  
For Britain only  
Only for Britain yeah  
For Britain only  
Only for Britain
