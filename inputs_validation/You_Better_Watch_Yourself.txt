You better watch yourself  
You better watch yourself  
You better watch yourself  
Cause Ive got my eyes on you  
  
You can steal my love and go away  
Dont tell me youll see me another day  
You got to watch yourself  
You got to watch yourself  
You got to watch yourself  
Cause Ive got my eyes on you  
  
Youve gone and left me  
You left me here to cry  
You know I love you  
You know you might sigh  
You got to watch yourself  
You got to watch yourself  
You got to watch yourself  
Cause Ive got my eyes on you  
  
I gave you all my money  
Everything too  
A fine Cadillac tell me  
  
Whatcha gonna do  
You got to watch yourself  
You got to watch yourself  
You got to watch yourself  
Cause Ive got my eyes on you  
  
Well the people are all talkin  
All over town  
Say you dont love me  
Youre gonna let me down  
You better watch yourself  
You better watch yourself  
You better watch yourself  
Cause Ive got my eyes on you  
  
Tell me whats the matter  
Whatcha gonna do  
Well youre gonna quit me  
Then you say youre thru  
You better watch yourself  
You better watch yourself  
You better watch yourself  
Cause Ive got my eyes on you
