Standing on the poop deck of a wreck  
Inferiority complex  
Waiting for the tugboat of respect  
Inferiority complex  
  
Trying to see the good side of a bad life  
Showing real courage with a sad wife  
Your soul is full of holes air could blow through  
People that you meet dont want to know you  
  
People are strange when they dont respect  
Inferiority complex  
People are mean when they get the chance  
Wont anybody have this dance  
People are weird when they dont respect  
Inferiority complex  
  
Are you heel or just a toe  
Its hard to say cause you feel so low  
  
The man is eying and you like a suspect  
Inferiority complex  
Your every word is something to correct  
Inferiority complex  
  
Everything about you repels sunshine  
Every deep desire leaves you flat lined  
Walking trough the world you leave no traces  
You dont feel a part of any places  
  
People are strange when theres no respect  
Inferiority complex  
People are bad when they get the chance  
Wont anybody have this dance  
People are strange when theres no respect  
Inferiority complex  
  
Its hard to say when youre down so low  
So low  
  
Inferior but not a bore  
Inferior but not a bore  
Inferior but not a bore  
Inferior but not a bore
