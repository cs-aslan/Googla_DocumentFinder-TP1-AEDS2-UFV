Get out I wont even listen  
I cant hear a single word you say  
Enough of your intimidation  
Dont tell me bout the price I pay  
Take off dont want your kind of trouble  
Dont want to see you hangin round my place  
Its late and heres the situation  
I never want to see your face  
  
You just drag me down  
And Ive got the scars to show  
I think you oughta know  
  
Chorus  
You got the best of me  
Mister Friendly  
You got the best of me  
  
Dont ask cant promise any favors  
Dont want to owe you in anything again  
Bad luck its your occupation  
Cant you see you are your own worst friend  
Im gone the masquerade is over  
Im cashin in the silver tray  
So long I cant buy this evil game you play  
  
You just drag me down  
And Ive got the scars to show  
I think you oughta know  
  
Chorus  
  
Hes standing in your way  
You smile like its okay  
Knowing youll show him somehow  
Youre running out of time  
Too late to change your mind  
No one can save you now  
  
Chorus
