Seemed to stop my breath  
My head on your chest waiting to cave in  
From the bottom of my  
Hear your voice again  
Could we dim the sun and  
Wonder where weve been  
Maybe you and me so kiss me like you did  
My heart stopped beating such a softer sin  
Im melting never caught my breath  
Every second Im without you  
Im a mess  
Ever know each other  
Trust these words  
Are stones  
My cuts arent healing  
Learning how to love  
Im melting Im melting  
  
Chorus  
In your eyes  
Ive lost my place could stay a while  
And Im melting  
In your eyes like my first time  
That I caught fire  
Just stay with me lay with me  
  
You can stay and watch me fall  
And of course  
Ill ask for help  
And we could take our heads off  
Just stay in bed lets make love  
Thats all  
  
Just stay with me now  
  
Im melting  
Im melting  
  
Chorus
