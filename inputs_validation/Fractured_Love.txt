Im caught in a dream  
Sometimes it aint what it seems  
Im all in a daze  
Cant find my way out of this maze  
Im looking for clues  
And wanting a change in the rules  
Im locked in a cage  
Acting out on the wrong stage  
  
Dont want your sympathy  
Dont need the third degree  
Just got to break away and scream  
Im caught in a dream  
  
Im stood at the edge and Im looking down  
Caught in the danger zone  
I feel like a king that has lost his crown  
And now I stand here alone  
  
Dont want your sympathy  
Dont need the third degree  
Just got to break away and scream  
Im caught in a dream  
  
Fractured love fractured love  
Iron fist in a velvet glove  
Fractured love fractured love  
Cracks in the mirror of this fractured love  
  
I dont care if you pull down the sky  
Angry passion is a friend of mine  
Reach out for the sky above  
Its just a fractured love  
  
Fractured love fractured love  
Iron fist in a velvet glove  
Fractured love fractured love  
Cracks in the mirror of this fractured love  
  
Im caught in a dream  
Why dont you set me free  
  
Dont want your sympathy  
Dont want your third degree  
Just got to break  
Break away and scream  
  
Im caught in a dream  
Why dont you set me free  
  
Fractured love fractured love  
Iron fist in a velvet glove  
Fractured love fractured love  
Cracks in the mirror of this fractured love  
  
Dont give me your fractured love
