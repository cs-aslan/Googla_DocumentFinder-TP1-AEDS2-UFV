Shes a good girl loves her mama  
loves Jesus and America too  
Shes a good girl crazy bout Elvis  
loves horses and her boyfriend too  
  
Its a long day livin in Reseda  
theres a freeway runnin through the yard  
and Im a bad boy cause I dont even miss her  
Im a bad boy for breakin her heart  
  
And Im free Im free fallin  
  
All the vampires walkin through the valley  
move west down Ventura Blvd  
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows  
All the good girls are home with broken hearts  
  
I wanna glide down over Mulholland  
I wanna write her name in the sky  
I wanna free fall out into nothin  
Gonna leave this world for awhile
