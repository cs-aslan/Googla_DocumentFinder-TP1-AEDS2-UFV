When you came into the pod you told me that something was wrong  
Said you wasnt havin no more fun and you want to lick the sun  
Couldnt say it was any fun oh dude  
  
Now youre on the couch you cant even move your fucking head  
Tell me that you wish you was dead  
Dude I really dont wish you was dead  
Better stay in your sweaty mucus bed oh dude  
  
I cant have a smoke cant even enjoy a little brew  
What the hells my buggy going to do  
Cant even pet the horses in the zoo  
Little Miss Mandys in this too oh dude
