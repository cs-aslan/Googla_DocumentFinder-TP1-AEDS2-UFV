Shes twenty two  
And shes loving you  
And youll never know how it makes me blue  
Does it make you happy  
  
Im holding on  
To a thing thats wrong  
Cause we dont belong  
But you like my songs  
And you make me happy  
Does she make you happy  
  
You can throw away  
Every word I say  
  
Im standing still  
On this hidden hill  
And Im looking around  
For the right way down  
To your distant valley  
  
Your flowers grow in the frozen snow  
And Id like to know if its all a show  
Cause you sure look happy  
Are you really happy  
  
Youll just throw away  
Every word I say  
You can throw away ay ay  
  
Oh oh  
  
Does she make you happy  
Does she make you happy  
Does she make you happy  
Id like to see you happy
