When I joined a band I thought my life was pretty cool  
Wed stay in hotels with room service and pools  
Sign body parts for fans  
Check into rehab and smash up the van  
But looking back I should have stayed in school  
  
Life out on the road can be dangerous you see  
To rock stock food and smelly roadies  
Are not nearly as scary  
As that girl whos at every show  
Mouthing the words from the front row  
The stalker girl is scaring the hell out of me  
  
Shes my creepy stalker girl  
Im the centre of her whacked out crazy and delusional world  
She follows me every everywhere  
Shes even got a bag with some bits of my hair  
Just go away you creepy stalker girl  
  
She says I touch her in a very special way  
But Id never go near her now without my pepper spray  
And the voices in her head  
Said break into my house and sleep in my bed  
And they also said that shaving the cat was okay  
  
Shes my creepy stalker girl  
Im the centre of her whacked out crazy and delusional world  
She follows me every everywhere  
Shes even got a bag with some bits of my hair  
Just go away you creepy stalker girl  
  
Ive analyzed your handwriting and Ive got some bad news  
Youre manic obsessive with the band and mad issues  
And you think that all our songs  
Are about you and youre usually wrong  
Except for now this song is so about you  
You creepy stalker girl you creepy stalker girl you creepy stalker girl
