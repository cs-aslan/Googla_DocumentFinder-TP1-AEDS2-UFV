Theres me looking down at my shoes  
The one smiling like the sun thats you  
What were you thinking  
What was the song inside your head  
Theres us going on about a band  
Working out how wed play our hands  
I lay there dreaming later all alone in my bed  
If I was stupid maybe careless so were you  
Not everything is supposed to come true  
Some words are best unsaid  
Some love is not really love at all  
Ill keep everything I shared with you  
And thats enough theres us  
Freeze frame Im not about to cry  
Its to late for us to change why try  
Ive got a camera tucked away inside my heart  
If Im a loser or just unlucky so are you  
Not everything is supposed to come true  
Some words are best unsaid  
Some love is not really love at all  
Ill keep everything I shared with you  
And thats enough theres us  
Somewhere between then and now  
I looked away when you said well never change  
And if you think what might have been  
Youll lose today and weve got songs to play  
Not everything is supposed to come true  
Some words are best unsaid  
Some love is not really love at all  
Ill keep everything I shared with you  
And thats enough theres us  
Not everything is supposed to come true  
Some words are best unsaid  
Some love is not really love at all  
Ill keep everything I shared with you  
And thats enough theres us  
Some love is not really love at all  
Theres us  
Some love is not really love at all  
Theres us
