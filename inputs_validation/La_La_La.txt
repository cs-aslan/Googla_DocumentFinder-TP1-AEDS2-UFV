Words and music by brent wilson  
  
If a pictures worth a thousand words  
What are they  
And since youre spirit intercedes for me  
What do you hear when I pray  
cause Im finding it hard to find the word  
To let you know how my heart can hurt  
So Ill sing the tune  
And let you fill in the words  
  
chorus  
La la la  
La la la  
La la la  
  
Its comforting to know  
My words arent all you hear  
I can talk to you with laughter  
And I can talk to you in tears  
And I dont have to know just what to say  
For you to hear me when I pray  
So Ill sing a part and let you read my heart  
  
repeat chorus
