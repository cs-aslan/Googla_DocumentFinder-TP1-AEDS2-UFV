Sophia look like a witch  
A beautiful witch is she  
Sophia look like a witch  
Hidden form in the name of chastity  
  
Sophia wears a crucifix  
Christ hung round her neck  
Sophia wears a crucifix  
Crucifix effect  
  
Sophia lies between black sheets  
Between black sheets she rests  
Sophia rises while the cockadoodledoos a calling  
And in black robes shes dressed  
  
Sophia look like a witch Sophia look like a witch repeat  
  
Sophia rises while the cockerels mourning  
As the sun sets in the West  
Sophia is a mother with a child at her breast  
  
Sophia look like a witch Sophia look like a witch repeat
