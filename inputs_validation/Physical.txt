Im saying all the things that I know you like  
Making good conversation  
Ive gotta handle you just right  
You know what I mean  
  
I took you to an intimate restaurant  
Then to a suggestive movie  
Theres nothing left to talk about  
Unless its horizontally  
  
Chorus  
Lets get physical physical  
I want to get physical  
Lets get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk your body talk  
Let me hear your body talk  
  
Ive been patient Ive been good  
Tried to keep my hands on the table  
Oh its getting hard to hold me back  
You know what I mean  
  
Im sure you understand my point of view  
We know each other better  
Youve gotta know youre bringing out  
The animal in me  
  
Chorus  
  
Physical I want to get physical  
Lets get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk your body talk  
Let me hear your body talk  
  
Get physical
