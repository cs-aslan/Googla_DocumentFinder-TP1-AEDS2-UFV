Livin on free food tickets water in the milk from the hole in the roof  
Where the rain came through what can you do  
Tears from little sister cryin cause she doesnt have a dress without a patch  
For the party to go oh but she knows shell get by  
Cause she is livin in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of the family man  
Daddys gonna buy her a dream to cling to  
Mamas gonna love her just as much as she can and she can  
Its a good thing you dont have a busfare  
It would fall through the hole in your pocket  
And youd lose it on the snow on the ground a walking to town to find a job  
Tryin to keep your hands warm  
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through  
And it chills to the bone boy youd better go home where its warm  
And you can live in the love  
  
Livin on dreams aint easy  
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit and the chills stay away  
You take em in stride family pride you know that faith is your foundation  
And a whole lot of love and a warm conversation and plenty of prayer  
Making you strong where you belong  
And you can live in the love  
Oh yes we live in the love
