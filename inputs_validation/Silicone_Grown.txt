Wait a minute honey  
I dont think the jokes too funny  
No I stayed up all night  
Checking out the doctors guide  
  
Wait a minute honey  
Stop pretending youre a bunny  
Well I mightve guessed  
You been to see a specialist  
  
I remember you said  
That we gotta keep a breast of time  
But obviously you dont know  
Where to draw the line well  
  
Dont try to tell me its awhat you been eating  
Since when have you been fortyfour around  
Get on with the song yeah  
  
Dig this at the Moulin Rouge tell you baby  
We could knockem dead  
Just sign right here all I need is ten percent  
  
Well now you make me feel like a pimp in the White House  
For a senators daughter youre stealing all the headline news  
All the headline news  
  
Oh shake me shake me shake me up all night long  
We all need a laugh and I guess youre just the one  
Well you got more front than Haig Museum  
Oh home grown silicone  
You really got the best of me  
  
You really got the best of me
