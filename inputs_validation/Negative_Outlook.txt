I think so fucking hard my heads gonna explode  
The hate replaces blood and its al that I know  
Your words mean total nothing our existence is corruption  
Thats how I see it why dont you give it a try  
Sadness becomes anger and I dont know why  
Ive seen so much truth theirs no more tears to cry  
It ran out years ago the wells gone dry  
I no longer care and now I realize I have a  
  
Negative outlook  
Thats why I have a  
Negative outlook  
And it wont change  
  
Do I really care sometimes I wish I could  
Then I think what I despise and it feels really good  
I wont worship false power as you destroy earth  
I dont give a dam what you say its worth  
What makes me feel this way what have I become  
The seasons still change but the damage is done  
Its just another culture forced to die  
No cares no conscience Im desensitized with a  
  
Negative outlook  
Thats why I have a  
Negative outlook  
And it wont change  
  
And that is how I realized I am negative
