I know that she dont like me  
She knows that I dont care  
I could mistreat and bad mouth that woman  
Turn around and shed be there  
She aint got no pride she dont even try to hide  
What she does  
Its a buzz  
  
To be seen in your limousine  
Shell do strange bedroom scenes  
She likes rockn roll she would give her all  
Just to get into it  
Her heads full of rock n roll dreams  
Shes exactly what she seems  
She likes rock n roll she would give her all  
Just to get into it  
  
Hangin around hotel bars  
Droppin someones name  
Usin those lines that you heard before  
Playin the same old games  
She aint got no style  
Eyes that never smile  
Feel like youre on trial  
She aint worth while  
  
To be seen in your limousine  
Shell do strange bedroom scenes  
She likes rock n roll she would give her all  
Just to get into it  
Her heads full of rock n roll dreams  
Shes exactly what she seems  
She likes rock n roll she would give her all  
Just to get into it  
  
She wants to interview  
Says the world should know your views  
With someone you can see right through  
Shes just comin on  
Tryin to pretend that its  
Just a yawn  
Ah come on  
  
To be seen in your limousine  
Shell do strange bedroom scenes  
She likes rockn roll she would give her all  
Just to get into it  
Her heads full of rock n roll dreams  
Shes exactly what she seems  
She likes rock n roll she would give her all  
Just to get into it
