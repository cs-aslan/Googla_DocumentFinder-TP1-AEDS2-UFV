Like a hog a rootin up under a fence  
Like a flopeared mule that aint got no sense  
Ive been a fool about you for way too long  
Ive been a fool about you but now Im gonna get gone  
  
We fight and we fuss like a dog and a cat  
Ill tell you right now Ive had enough of that  
Ive been a fool about you for way too long  
Ive been a fool about you but Im gonna get gone  
  
Well I said I would leave if you didnt change  
Baby its time for me to rearrange  
Ive been a fool about you for way too long  
Ive been a fool about you but now Im gonna get gone  
  
Im gettin sick and tired of the same ole bull  
Ill tell you right now lord my buckets bout full  
Ive been a fool about you for way too long  
Ive been a fool about you but now Im gonna get gone
