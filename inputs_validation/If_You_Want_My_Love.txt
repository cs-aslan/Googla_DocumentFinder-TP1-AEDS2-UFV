There was a time when no one  
Could ever take your place  
Thats not the case anymore  
Took for granted that tomorrow was ours to play  
  
Boy things have changed  
Nothing stayed the same  
When you chose to move away  
  
Chorus  
Havent heard your voice in so very long  
Say Ive been missed but I wouldnt know  
I might be better off living on my own  
cause love wont last now that hope is gone  
Promised the distance wouldnt change a thing  
Now the fault is work its keeping you away  
Youd try harder if you want my love  
If you want my love  
  
Careless intentions  
Is what this has become  
Im struck with a broken heart  
Here were flowing on emotions  
Of what once was  
  
Boy things have changed  
Nothing stayed the same  
When you chose to move away  
move away  
  
Chorus  
  
Looking back on how things used to be  
No one could tell me that this would be our destiny  
And now Im facing life on my own without you baby  
Though were miles apart  you had my heart  
  
Im tired of the confusion Id rather just be friends  
Theres no hope of a second chance  
No sense in going through the motions  
Like its not the end like this is not the end
