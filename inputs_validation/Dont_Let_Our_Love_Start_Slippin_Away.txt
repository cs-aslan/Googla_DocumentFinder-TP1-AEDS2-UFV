Weve been up  
All night long  
Trying to solve a problem  
Hell its almost dawn  
Aint no time for sleepin  
If our love is wearin thin  
Cause I aint givin up  
And you aint givin in  
  
Dont let our love start slippin  
Love start slippin away  
Cause the life weve been livin  
Gets harder everyday  
Dont let our love start slippin  
Love start slippin away  
  
A wounded love  
Walks a real thin line  
And no communication  
Will kill it every time  
So open up your heart  
Baby we can work it out  
Cause weve got the kind of love  
People dream about  
  
Dont let our love start slippin  
Love start slippin away  
Cause the life weve been livin  
Gets harder everyday  
Dont let our love start slippin  
Love start slippin away  
  
Its past the point of right or wrong  
Lets find a way to just hold on
