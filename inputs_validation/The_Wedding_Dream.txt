My Mother is entering My dream now  
Shes wearing a wedding dress  
Somethings wrong with the way she walks the aisle  
I think its her legs  
  
Suddenly there is someone else beside her  
That man I recognize  
The Doctor intends to marry Mother  
Its got to be stopped  
  
Now what have I done  
My Mothers on the floor and the Doctors gone  
Everything is wrong  
And as I keep the axe I wonder whats to come  
  
Im caught within a dream theres no way out  
I cant escape  
If only I could see the light of day  
I might escape the dream  
The wedding dream  
Oh the dream  
  
Now everything turns to darkness  
Deep within I feel like Im going blind  
There is a light at the end of this starless nightmare  
Someones calling guiding me back inside  
The dream  
No  
  
Get away from him Mother  
You better stop kissing cause hes an enemy  
Take at look at his hand  
Hes got the key to my house the Doctor is the devil  
  
Im caught within a dream theres no way out  
I cant escape  
If only I could see the light of day  
I might escape the dream  
The wedding dream  
Oh the dream  
  
Dream the wedding dream  
Oh the dream  
  
Now everything turns to darkness  
Deep within I feel like Im going blind  
There is a light at the end of this starless nightmare  
Someones screaming Help me please And its Me  
  
At sunrise I woke up in a sweat  
The nightmare was gone  
The dream I was sent is fading slowly  
I do not understand
