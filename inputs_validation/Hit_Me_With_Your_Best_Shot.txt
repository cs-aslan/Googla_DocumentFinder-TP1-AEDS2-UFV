Well youre a real tough cookie with a long history  
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me  
Thats okay lets see how you do it  
Put up you dukes lets get down to it  
  
Hit me with your best shot  
Why dont you hit me with your best shot  
Hit me with your best shot  
Fire away  
  
You come on with it come on  
You dont fight fair  
Thats okay see if I care  
Knock me down its all in vain  
I get right back on my feet again  
  
Hit me with your best shot  
Why dont you hit me with your best shot  
Hit me with your best shot  
Fire away  
  
Well youre a real tough cookie with a long history  
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me  
Before I put another notch in my lipstick case  
You better make sure you put me in my place  
  
Hit me with your best shot  
Cmon hit me with your best shot  
Hit me with your best shot  
Fire away  
  
Hit me with your best shot  
Why dont you hit me with your best shot  
Hit me with your best shot  
Fire away
