You were the one who could never decide  
Your always complaining the companys too restraining  
You think your sweeter than the rest  
But deep inside your scared to death  
Youve got your finger in the pie  
The time has come to pick a side  
sax  
First you say one thing then you change your mind  
You think its great you say its hot  
You turn around and then its not  
On Saturday night you wear punk rags  
But you drive a white porsche with custom tags  
Youd like to chance it but you just dont know  
Cause your getten blind from too much snow  
I hate you but I need the deal  
Lets discuss it over a big hot meal  
Gimme a break Gimme a break Etc Etc  
sax  
Dont you think were tough enough think twice  
Think that you can hold us back no way  
Dont you know we got the stuff sure thing  
Now were on the warpath  
Sorry Its not too late Gimme a break  
sax solo  
Dont you know Im tired of waiten so tired  
And Im tired of being nice so nice  
Cant ya look me in the eyes  
Dont ya know Im coming out  
Sorry Its not too late Gimme a break  
You got the job now so you call the shots  
You got the access to the bread  
You said by now that Ill be dead  
But let me tell you something friend  
Your days are numbered to the end  
You see that young cat down the hall  
Hes waiten for you to trip and fall  
Youll beg for your job down on your knees  
Youll kiss the ground and ask him please to  
Give you a break  
Give you a break  
Give you a break
