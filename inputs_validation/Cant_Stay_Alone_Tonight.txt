I blew the dust out of the corners  
Threw some dead wood on the fire  
Tuned the radio to silence  
Watched the evening sun expire  
  
Should have called you up this morning  
But Im such a fool at times  
I still search my shaving mirror  
Looking for your face with mine  
  
And I cant stay alone tonight  
Cant let another day go by  
Why is it always this way  
Time never seems to really fly  
And time is never really on my side  
And I cant stay alone tonight  
Things have to change and they might  
But I cant stay alone tonight  
  
Chalk up one more crazy notion  
Imagination running wild  
But if I needed confirmation  
I would have gone that extra mile  
  
Youre the last chance on the highway  
Im that open stretch of road  
Youre the diner in my rearview  
A cup of coffee getting cold  
  
And I cant stay alone tonight  
Cant let another day go by  
Why is it always this way  
Time never seems to really fly  
And time is never really on my side  
And I cant stay alone tonight  
Things have to change and they might  
But I cant stay alone tonight  
  
Bruised in this cold war of words  
Weve come undone two loose ends alone  
Possessed by that curse youve endured  
The spell that I cast couldnt make you come home  
  
And I cant stay alone tonight  
Cant let another day go by  
Why is it always this way  
Time never seems to really fly  
And time is never really on my side  
And I cant stay alone tonight  
Things have to change and they might  
But I cant stay alone tonight  
Things have to change and they might  
But I cant stay alone tonight
