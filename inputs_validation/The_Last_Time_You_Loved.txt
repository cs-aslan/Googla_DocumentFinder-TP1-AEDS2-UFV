I think there are people who need to be loved  
Lonely and hiding the light from their eyes  
Still too afraid to light up the night  
Too lonely to come out of hiding  
  
Well Ive seen you with the young girls  
They come when you call  
They make love so easy  
They dont love at all  
  
You want me to come running  
When your worlds falling in  
You want me till you got me  
Then youre gone again  
  
And your passion comes so easy  
Then you ease away from me  
Cause the last time you loved was the first time you ever cried  
It was the first time you ever really loved  
  
Its the last time you ever tried  
Your defenses become you now you become them  
Its one night on the weekend  
Then youre gone again  
  
Well Im tears and Im passion and theres a woman in me  
Stop all your runnin and Ill set you free  
And I stand before you naked and my soul is on my sleeve  
And the last time you loved was the first time you ever cried  
  
It was the first time you ever really loved  
And its the last time you ever tried  
It was the first time you ever really loved  
Say its not the last time youll ever try
