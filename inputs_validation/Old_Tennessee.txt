End of October  
The sleepy brown woods seem to  
Nod down their heads to the Winter  
Yellows and grays  
Paint the sad skies today  
And I wonder when  
Youre coming home  
  
Woke up one morning  
The wind through the window  
Reminded me Winter  
Was just round the bend  
Somehow I just didnt  
See it was coming  
  
It took me by surprise again  
And I hear youre in San Francisco  
Living with your sister whos a mother to be  
And her husbands way down in Georgia  
And Im still in old Tennessee  
  
Wishing youd come home to me  
Life here is easy  
Im sure you recall  
How its so warm and breezy  
In the Summer and the Fall  
  
But Winters upon me  
And Ive got no heat here  
And I miss your fire so sweet Dear  
I miss your fire so sweet  
And I hear youre in San Francisco  
Living with your sister whos a mother to be  
  
And her husbands way down in Georgia  
And Im still in old Tennessee  
Wishing youd come home to me  
End of October  
The sleepy brown woods seem to  
Nod down their heads to the Winter  
  
Yellows and gray  
Paint the sad skies today  
And I wonder when  
Youre coming home  
I wonder when youre coming home
