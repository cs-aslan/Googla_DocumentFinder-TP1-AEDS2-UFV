My arms are all twisted  
The only thing I miss is  
I messed up  
I missed it  
I messed up  
The missing of you  
  
Its getting to sound  
Like theyve seen you around with her  
  
No mystery  
No mystery  
No mysteries  
  
Everyone knows  
The secretest code of mine  
Theyll tell all my friends and  
Theyll tell all my enemies too  
  
Mystery  
No mysteries  
No mysteries  
  
No mystery  
No mystery  
No mystery  
  
Take it away Nick  
  
I dont even know what its like not to go back to you  
I dont even know who I like less  
You or me  
You or me  
You or me  
Oooh  
  
Its anyones anyones guess  
Its anyones anyones guess
