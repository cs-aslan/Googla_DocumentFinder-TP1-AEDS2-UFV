Yeah  
Ugh  
Ugh  
Ugh  
  
See Ive been going on and on forever  
Them haters probably wonder when Im gone stop never  
Most of its been good but Ive seen some bad weather  
And niggas watching now wouldnt even give me an umbrella  
But I aint tripping I made a million on my own  
May come to your surprise but I pictured it all along  
When I was sixteen finna get put out my home  
Now the man make the money my nigga my money grown  
And I can do what I what went form being hated on  
To niggas try to go down the same road I made it on  
Aint no love lost but aint no love shown  
So now when niggas call I just dont pick up the phone  
Im breaking down the weed put it in the bong  
Blow a hundred racks put it in the song  
Party every weekend hardly ever home  
Dont get a chance to see me face to face  
So you have to talk about me when I gone  
  
Chorus  
Stay away from the fake or phony phony  
Niggas who cant support their role  
So keep hatin me from the crowd  
Everybody wants to be the star of the showowow  
The showowow owow  
The showowow owow  
The showowow owow  
The showowow owow  
  
The drinks poured up weeds rolled up  
And all my jewelery ice age the piece froze up  
I only like to see the hoes who keep their nose up  
Have any nigga in the world but she chose us  
I remember them same hoes aint even notice us  
Get you to buy a drink than its over cous  
We back around the time that she soberd up  
But shit aint been the same since the limousine showed up  
The best moments of my life  
Never filled this much plastic off of Polo in my life  
Rarely gon to see smoking with ya wife  
Plus anything you want I can afford to buy it twice  
Its the way we know wake up in the morn  
Like where did all my paper go  
Roll some more weed and get medicated  
Everyday is a holiday so we celebrate it  
  
Chorus  
  
Niggas losing their roles  
Cant play they positions play they positions  
One day they down for the team team  
Next day they missin Next day they missin  
Same ones was all in the front  
Supposed to be there for support there for support  
And half the time its the ones you care for  
Fuck you here for huh  
You wanna be a big shot only number one  
Everybody wanna be a superstar  
Big shot only number one  
But everybody wanna be the star though  
They wanna be a big shot only number one  
Everybody wanna be a superstar  
Big shot only number one  
But everybody wanna be the star though  
Ugh  
The money come the money go  
And when it come down to it  
Thats something niggas with real money should know  
We partied a lot and drank  
Now they dont talk to me  
Started off not so great now Im on top of things  
  
I guess the difference is we aint thinking the same  
So if Im guilty of change I guess Im the one to blame  
I see the bigger picture on the wall in the frame  
Spent a couple of days on team making it rain  
I was cool but I was thinking ocean views  
Polo trunk shades on and boat shoes  
Cantox lick oil my nigga I aint slippin  
You wont star me out ugh bad transmission  
So if for the better yeah a nigga different  
That west coast weed my homie Wiz twistin  
Mattress money put up cause now my money different  
You got a lot to say but they aint never tried to listen  
Record all night in the studio in the morn  
Playin back when we did now tell me is that wrong  
Crack the Rose pop a top or two  
And toast to what this hard work got us to
