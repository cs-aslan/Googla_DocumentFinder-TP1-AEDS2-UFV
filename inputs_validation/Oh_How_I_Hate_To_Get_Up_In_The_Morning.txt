Ive been a soldier quite a while  
And I would like to state  
The life is simply wonderful  
The Army food is great  
  
I sleep with ninetyseven others in a wooden hut  
I love them all  
They all love me  
Its very lovely but  
  
Oh How I hate to get up in the morning  
Oh How Id love to remain in bed  
  
For the hardest blow of all  
Is to hear the bugler call  
Ya gotta get up  
Ya gotta get up  
Ya gotta get up this morning  
  
Someday Im going to murder the bugler  
Someday theyre going to find him dead  
  
Ill amputate his reveille  
And step upon it heavily  
And spend the rest of my life in bed  
  
alternate lines in 2nd chorus  
And then Ill get that other pup  
The guy who wakes the bugler up
