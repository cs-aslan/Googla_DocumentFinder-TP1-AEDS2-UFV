Ive seen ladies look at me  
With want to in their eyes  
But each time they do  
I think of you and it makes me realize  
Just any old love wont do  
  
No any old love wont do  
I dont want to love  
If it isnt with you  
Just any old love wont do  
  
Youve got the only arms  
Ive ever come runnin to  
Love has always led me to your bed  
Just any old love wont do  
  
No Any old love wont do  
Just any old love wont do  
I dont want to love  
If it isnt with you  
Just any old love wont do  
  
Just any old love wont do  
No any old love wont do  
I dont want to love  
If it isnt with you  
Just any old love wont do  
  
No any old love wont do  
Just any old love wont do  
I dont want to love  
If it isnt with you  
Just any old love wont do  
  
No any old love wont do  
Just any old love wont do  
I dont want to love  
If it isnt with you  
Just any old love wont do
