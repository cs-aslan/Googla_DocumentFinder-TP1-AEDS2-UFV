Chorus  
Can you dig it alright I can dig it  
Cause Im your hip hop lyrical robot and a red cool cat  
Yes Im your hip hop lyrical robot and a red cool cat  
  
I want the girls to hear me rap  
Cause this mc has got the nack  
Im your bodypopping shell shocking  
Girls hocking eye popping lick me all over like a lollipop  
Im your juicy fruit  
Alright alright alright  
  
I said hey white man Indian or black  
Im your number 1 MC and thats a fact  
Im a good locking girl hooking outstanding  
Mile chatting lyrical shock attack  
All MCs freeze there on the spot  
One false move and you must get drop  
Im always devastating fascinating  
Videmaking pinstaking watch it man Im hot  
  
Chorus  
  
Its a struggle in life when your skin is black  
The system is designed to hold you back  
how sya do shle hands on the shoulder a pat  
One love to my face then a stab in the back  
Seven points in snooker when you put down the black  
But I still thank God for the little I got  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont stop rapping to the musical beat  
And Im in the mood to turn you on  
In the groove thats so complete  
Wind you hips shake your body  
Or clap you hands even stamp your feet  
Just like a bed thats just been spread  
You know Im neat neat neat  
Just like a tap thats running hot  
Man cant you feel the heat  
Not just now but every minute every hour  
Everyday and every week  
  
I dont give a hoot for loot and shoot  
Or prostitutes in skin tight suits  
Standing on the corner  
They call their beat  
Im not a pimp drug pusher  
Gambler or even thief  
To the teachers I will preach  
And to the teachers I will teach  
Cause Im a hip hop lyrical robot  
That is why so unique  
Well police and thieves are playing  
The game of hide and seek  
When an informer gives information  
Then its called a leak  
I jail your a number ruled by governor  
Screws keep you under want to see you blunder  
When they say Sit just take a seat  
And when they say food its time to eat  
If a screw says Nigger I dont answer  
Yes sir no sir three bags full sir  
Sometimes inmates would even call me a growler  
Me a growler Im no growler  
  
Chorus  
  
Well Im a hip hop lyrical robot  
I dont stop rapping to the musical beat  
  
Well Im a hip hop lyrical robot and a red cool cat
