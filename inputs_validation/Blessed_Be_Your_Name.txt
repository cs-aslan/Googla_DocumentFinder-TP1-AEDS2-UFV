Blessed Be Your Name  
In the land that is plentiful  
Where Your streams of abundance flow  
Blessed be Your name  
  
Blessed Be Your name  
When Im found in the desert place  
Though I walk through the wilderness  
Blessed Be Your name  
  
Every blessing You pour out  
Ill turn back to praise  
When the darkness closes in Lord  
Still I will say  
  
Blessed be the name of the Lord  
Blessed be Your name  
Blessed be the name of the Lord  
Blessed be Your glorious name  
  
Blessed be Your name  
When the suns shining down on me  
When the worlds all as it should be  
Blessed be Your name  
  
Blessed be Your name  
On the road marked with suffering  
Though theres pain in the offering  
Blessed be Your name  
  
Every blessing You pour out  
Ill turn back to praise  
When the darkness closes in Lord  
Still I will say  
  
Blessed be the name of the Lord  
Blessed be Your name  
Blessed be the name of the Lord  
Blessed be Your glorious name  
  
Blessed be the name of the Lord  
Blessed be Your name  
Blessed be the name of the Lord  
Blessed be Your glorious name  
  
You give and take away  
You give and take away  
My heart will choose to say  
Lord blessed be Your name
