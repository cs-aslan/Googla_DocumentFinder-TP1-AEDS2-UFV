I know some people they aint got no money  
But they do got a means to an end  
Cuz they got juice and they got plenty of lovin  
And a big heap of beautiful friends  
I know some people didnt know that theyre born  
They dont know the soles of their feet  
Well you cant fight a war when you got lovin in store  
There on the sunny side of the street  
Lets do the whip  
Everybody get hip to it  
  
Aint nothin missin we got a pot to kiss in  
We got karma we am what we am  
Its up to you because the best that you can do  
Is the best that you can  
My situation is the fellation nation  
Dancing to the brotherly beat  
Well you cant fight a war when you got lovin in store  
There on the sunny side of the street
