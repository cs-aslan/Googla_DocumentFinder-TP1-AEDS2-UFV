Well this old world can get you down  
And leave you spinning round and round  
Not knowing whats for real  
On this crazy wheel  
  
Is part of the deal baby  
Theres only one sure thing I know  
I never want to let you go  
Ill be here by your side  
On this circus ride  
  
Through every drop and climb  
til the end of time  
When everything is moving fast  
Its hard to stay together  
I know that we can make it last  
Well find a way to weather  
  
Any storm heaven sends  
Well see it through to the end  
Weve got it made if you can just believe  
Youll always be loved by me  
  
And when you go to bed at night  
And Im not there to hold you tight  
Ill love you from afar  
No matter where you are  
Ill count the days til when  
Im with you again  
  
And when were growin old  
Ill be the one to hold you close  
When everything is fading fast  
Well face the end together  
Well find a way to make it past  
One final storm to weather  
  
And even after the end  
I will be with you again  
Weve got it made if you can just believe  
Youll always be loved by me
