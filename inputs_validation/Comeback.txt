Walking up the stairs  
Just the afternoon  
Sweet wind blew  
Not a moment to soon  
Hoo I cry when I realized  
That sweet wind was you  
  
Spirits come and spirits go  
Some stick around for the after show  
Dont have to say I miss you dont have to say I miss you  
Cause I think you already know  
If you ever lose someone  
Dear to you  
Never say the words their gone  
Theyll come back yeah  
Theyll come back yeah yeah  
Theyll come back  
Tears go here  
Tears go here  
Tears go here  
Tears go here
