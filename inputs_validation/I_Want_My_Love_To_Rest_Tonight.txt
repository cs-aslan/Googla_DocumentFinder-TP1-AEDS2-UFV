Sisters dont blame my man too much  
I know hes doing his best  
I know his fear and loneliness  
He can do no more no less  
He was brought up by us women  
And the world that told him to be a man  
He reached and stretched to be the one  
While millions more tried to be that one  
  
I want my love to rest tonight  
So he can face the world tomorrow  
I want my love to sleep tonight  
So he can deal with tomorrow  
  
Sisters dont blame your man to much  
You know hes doing his best  
You know his fear and loneliness  
He can do no more no less  
He was told by his mothers to never trust girls  
He was told by his fathers to never shed tears  
He sees girls chasing after superstars  
While their men are sitting behind bars  
  
I want my love to rest tonight  
So he can face the world tomorrow  
I want my love to sleep tonight  
So he can deal with tomorrow  
  
Sisters dont blame our men to much  
We know theyre doing their best  
We know their fear and loneliness  
They can do no more no less  
They were told by us to get ahead  
Be gentle and tender yet hard and strong  
Nothing short of a living god  
Nothing short of James Bond  
  
If we all knew that no ones to be ashamed  
But that the society is to be blamed  
We could then come together again  
And direct our energies towards changing the world  
  
Were all blind and crippled mates  
Frustrated wouldbe presidents of united states  
We dont know how to cope with ourselves  
Or to love our mates for being themselves  
  
I want my love to rest tonight  
So he can face the world tomorrow  
I want my love to sleep tonight  
So he can deal with tomorrow
