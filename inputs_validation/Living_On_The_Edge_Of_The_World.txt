Early North Jersey industrial skyline  
Im an allset cobra jet creepin through the night time  
Gotta find a gas station gotta find a pay phone  
This turnpike sure is spooky at night when youre all alone  
Im living on the edge of the world  
Tryin to get my girl on the line  
Livin on the edge of the world  
But I think its just a waste of my time  
Some jerk keeps breaking my connection girl  
Cause Im living on the edge of the world  
  
Radio radio hear my tale of heartbreak  
New Jersey in the morning like a lunar landscape  
Got a counter girl at the Exit 24 HoJo  
Down past the refinery towers where the great black river flows  
OIm living on the edge of the world  
Tryin to get a message through  
I gotta make a connection girl  
Because Im living on the edge of the world  
Living on the edge of the world  
  
Radios jammed with gospel stations  
Lost souls callin long distance salvation  
Hey mister deejay gotta hear my last prayer  
Its a hey ho rock and roll deliver me from nowhere  
Im living on the edge of the world  
Tryin to get back to you girl  
Living on the edge of the world  
Tryin to get a message through  
I gotta make some connection girl  
Because Im living on the edge of the world  
Living on the edge of the world  
  
Now my boss dont dig me cause he put me on the night shift  
It takes me two hours to get back to where my baby lives  
In the wee wee hours my mind gets hazy  
Relay towers wont you lead me to my baby  
Neath the overpass the trooper hits his party lights switch  
  
Good night good luck one two powershift
