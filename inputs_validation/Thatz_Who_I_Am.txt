ZRo  
Houston Texas is my city Ridgemont 4 is my block  
I put my trust in no man only my motherfucking glock  
Cause she aint never let me down before  
Fuck a gang I follow my bitch cause she be busting rounds for Ro  
Unlike my homies cause they phony than a motherfucker  
Even my broad cause she might be fucking some other brother  
Lord knows that I couldnt take it if I found out  
Premeditated cause Im about to let them automatic rounds out  
A prisoner of my own mind losing it swiftly  
Clicking on motherfuckers until the reaper come and get me  
Fuck a friend and a click and a partner in crime  
Cause when you doing your bid they wont be partners in time  
I bet they be the main reason why you locked up in a county  
Thats why I strive to keep all the busta bitches from round me  
So take it how you want to take it i dont give a damn

Wait a second how this buster know Im going to jail  
I seen the hatred in they faces when the prince wanted to see me  
When they thought I was leaving they wanted to DEAD me  
Dropping salt on my name saying I sold my soul  
And these suppose to be my people damn my people so cold  
Why not be happy for a nigga when he make a major move  
Chill you playing with this game but Ive been paying major dues

When you see me look me in the eyes and pull up your pamper bitch  
My nigga named Tommy say hes coming to get ya  
His people gon be swinging everyone of emll hit ya  
Holding on to my grudges until my brain get a blister  
I love drama so much because my life is so rough  
So when you see me out in public dont you come at me wrong  
Disrespect me if you aint hoe Ima fuck up your dome
