Ive got your love I dont now how we did it  
I dont know why it seemed so long  
Ive got your love I dont know why you hid it  
Ive never felt like this before  
  
I wont fall in love  
You said it so sure  
You havent noticed you never say that any more  
  
Ive got your love  
And its a perfect reason for understanding life some more  
  
Burnt your fingers before  
Burnt your finger before  
  
Ive got your love I dont know how we did it  
I dont know why it seemed so long  
Ive got your love its such a total feeling  
I dont know where it all began  
  
I wont fall in love  
You said it so sure  
You havent noticed you never say that any more  
  
Ive got your love  
And if I lose all others  
It wouldnt really hurt at all  
Ive got your love I dont know how we did it  
I dont know why it seemed so long  
  
Ive got your love Ive got your love  
I dont know why it seemed so long
