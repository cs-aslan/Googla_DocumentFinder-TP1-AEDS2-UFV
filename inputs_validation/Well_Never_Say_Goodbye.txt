We share the days of laughter  
We share the nights of sorrow  
And in the morning after  
We face the bright tomorrow  
Side by side well always stand  
Spirits flying high  
Long as I can hold your hand  
Well never say goodbye  
  
We walk the halls of learning  
And serve a proud tradition  
The flame of truth is burning  
To clarify our vision  
Look at how the future gleams  
Gold against the sky  
Long as I can share your dreams  
Well never say goodbye  
  
Theres little to be sure of  
But we will last forever  
For now we know the pure love  
We feel when were together  
Then if someay we should part  
We will not say die  
Long as you are in my heart  
Well never say goodbye
