All the girls are hear me now  
Listen when I call you ladies  
You dont have to trust a man  
That is driving a Mercedes  
You dont know boy how hard I try  
Being just here not with you baby  
Someday you should tell me why  
Why you do this to me baby  
  
You dont love me now  
You just hurt me now  
Its over its over  
Im not looking back  
Im not going back  
Its over its over  
  
You dont love me now  
You just hurt me now  
Its over its over  
Im not looking back  
Im not going back  
Its over its over  
  
You dont love me now  
  
You dont love me now  
You just hurt me now  
Its over its over  
Im not looking back  
Im not going back  
Its over its over  
  
You dont love me now  
You just hurt me now  
Its over its over  
Im not looking back  
Im not going back  
Its over its over  
  
All the girls you hear me now  
Listen when I call you ladies  
You dont have to trust a man  
That is driving a Mercedes  
You dont know boy how hard I try  
Being just here not with you baby  
Someday you should tell me why  
Why you do this to me baby  
  
You dont love me now  
You just hurt me now  
Its over its over  
Im not looking back  
Im not going back  
Its over its over  
  
You dont love me now  
You just hurt me now  
Its over its over  
Im not looking back  
Im not going back  
Its over its over
