I was cruisin in my Stingray late one night  
When an XKE pulled up on my right  
He rolled down the window of his shiny new Jag  
And challenged me then and there to a drag  
I said Youre on Buddy my mills running fine  
Lets come of the line now at Sunset and Vine  
But Ill go ya one better if youve got the nerve  
Lets race all the way  to Deadmans Curve  
  
CHORUS  
Deadmans Curveis no place to play  
Deadmans Curveyou best keep away  
Deadmans CurveI can hear them say  
You wont come back from Deadmans Curve  
  
The street was deserted late Friday night  
We were buggin each other as we sat out the light  
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green  
You shoulda heard the whine from my screamin machine  
I flew past La Brea Schwabs and Crescent Heights  
And all the Jag could see were my six tail lights  
He passed me at Doheny and I started to swerve  
But I pulled it out and there we were At Deadmans curve  
  
SPOKEN Well the last thing I remember Doc I started to swerve  
And then I saw the Jag slide into the curve  
I know Ill never forget that horrible sight  
I found out for myself that everyone was right  
  
Wont come back from Deadmans Curve  
  
Repeat chorus and fade
