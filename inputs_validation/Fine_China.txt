Baby does he do it for you  
When hes finished does he step back and adore you  
I just gotta know cause your time is money  
And I wont let him waste it ooh no no  
Baby just go with it  
Cause youre with me I cant explain it its just different  
  
We can take it slow or act like youre my girl lets skip the basics oh  
Woah  
  
Hes so replaceable  
Youre worth it chase ya put it on  
  
Its alright Im not dangerous  
Whem youre mine Ill be generous  
Youre irreplaceable  
A collectible just like fine china  
  
Baby youre my favorite  
Its like all the girls around me dont have faces  
And I stay in ghost  
Like this gentle game I done now playing  
  
Hes so replaceable  
Youre worth it chase ya put it on  
  
Its alright Im not dangerous  
Whem youre mine Ill be generous  
Youre irreplaceable  
A collectible just like fine china

Whem youre mine Ill be generous  
Youre irreplaceable  
A collectible just like fine china  
  
Give me a weapon your love  
Aint no a man of time in this world  
Save me a lot of time and just love me  
Deal it baby deal it in your soul  
Are you ready  
I know your heart being played and you you belong with me  
  
Its alright Im not dangerous  
Whem youre mine Ill be generous  
Youre irreplaceable  
A collectible just like fine china
