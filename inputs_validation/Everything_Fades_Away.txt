Baby dont tell me you miss me you love me  
Dont whisper gently that you cant forget me  
Tonight tonight cause Ive heard it all before  
Just turn away dont play that game  
Baby I dont want to anymore  
Let it all fade away  
Dont you know that love is gone  
Its too late everything fades away  
Nothing ever stays the same  
Baby no no no  
Dont tell me youre sorry you hurt me  
How many times can I give in  
How many battles can you win  
Oh dont beg for mercy  
Tonight tonight cause I cant take any more  
Just turn around dont break me down  
Baby I dont love you like before  
Let it all fade away  
Dont you know that love is gone  
Its too late everything fades away  
Nothing ever stays the same baby  
So hard for me to let you go  
Dont leave me standing in the cold  
Oh darling give me one more chance  
I know that we can make it last  
Just let me love you one more time  
Dont say it  
Girl I dont wanna lose my mind  
Dont say say  
So hard for me to let you go  
So hard for me to let you go  
Let it all fade away  
Dont you know that love is gone  
Its too late everything fades away  
Nothing ever stays the same  
Baby nothing ever stays the same  
Let it all fade away  
Dont you know that love is gone  
Its too late everything fades away  
Nothing ever stays the same baby  
It only fades it only fades  
Baby dont tell me you miss me you love me  
It only fades it only fades  
Baby dont tell me you miss me you love me  
It only fades it only fades  
Baby dont tell me you miss me you love me
