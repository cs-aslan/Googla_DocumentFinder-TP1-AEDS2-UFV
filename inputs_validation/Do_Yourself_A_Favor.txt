Isolated junk yard  
Letting out the garbage  
Eating through the core of life  
  
Sweet fragrance irritates  
In a state room death awaits  
Persecute your own selfpride  
  
Suffocate the new high  
Ride the thorny mule that cries  
Dig your grave and step right in  
  
Like a judas pay the price  
30 pieces for a ride  
Heres the fire take a chew  
  
Do yourself a favour  
Educate your mind  
Get yourself together  
Hey there aint much time  
  
Do yourself a favour  
Educate your mind  
Get yourself together  
Hey there aint much time  
  
Shredded knowhow give away  
Species of the human race  
Those funky winds of ups and downs  
  
Hall of grit is known too well  
Heaven still is your hell  
Poison slowly slowly drowns  
  
Let the devil step right in  
Lucifers your only friend  
Aint a soul gon pity you  
  
Hurdly over time to death  
With open arms it waits I bet  
Dont you wish you could reach ground  
  
Do yourself a favour  
Educate your mind  
Get yourself together  
Hey there aint much time  
  
Do yourself a favour  
Educate your mind  
Get yourself together  
Hey there aint much time
