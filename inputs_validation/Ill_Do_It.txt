Well the unseen sights look good to you  
I notice how you survey the room  
Awkward conversation and youre too polite  
You know thats always a clue  
Im wasting my time tryin to tell ya  
That youre making the mistake of your life  
Cause youre so sure that you need to go  
At any cost at any price  
  
But Ill Do It  
Ill send you out on your own with no guarantee  
Ill Do It  
But when you want to come home and you look for love  
Dont look for me  
  
Tell me when did everything start to go wrong  
And why was I the last one to know  
Youre so good at hidin your feelings  
Im so good at lettin mine show  
  
Well I know how great it feels together  
But that just isnt enough  
Cause I need more than your bedside manner  
I need someone to love  
  
So Ill Do It  
I guess theres nothin to say its all been said  
Ill Do It  
Make sure you want it this way cause when its done this time  
Ill be gone  
  
Ill Do It  
Ill send you out on your own with no guarantee  
Ill Do It  
But when you want to come home and you look for love  
Dont look for me  
  
Ill Do It  
Ill Do It  
Ill Do It  
Ill Do It  
Ill Do It
