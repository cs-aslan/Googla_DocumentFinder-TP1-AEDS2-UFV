Somewhere someday  
Well be close together wait and see  
Oh by the way this time the dreams on me  
  
Youll take my hand  
And youll look at me adoringly  
But as things stand this time the dreams on me  
  
It would be fun to be certain that Im the one  
To know that I at least supply the shoulder you cry upon  
To see you through till youre everything you want to be  
It cant be true but this time the dreams on me
