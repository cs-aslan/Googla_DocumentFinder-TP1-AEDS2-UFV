When I woke up this morning from the night before  
My brain was pulsating I was battered and sore

Cold Coke and Pepsi or Canada Dry

Theres nothing wrong hair of the dog  
  
Whats so wrong hair of the dog  
Theres nothing wrong hair of the dog  
  
Finally pulled myself out of my bed  
Feeling kinda dodgy I was feeling half dead  
Done it before probably do it again  
Dont know if I ever will learn

Theres nothing wrong hair of the dog  
Hair of the dog  
Hair of the dog
