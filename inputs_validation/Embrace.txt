Blood is boring  
Sleep is boring  
Dont stop running  
Im here counting  
  
The life the hurt the pain the hate  
The life the hurt the pain the hate  
The life the hurt the pain the hate  
Will he keep fuckin with me Theres nowhere else to go  
  
So I walk but seem to crawl  
For Im giving in today  
Now I run into a wall  
Cause I cannot fight my way  
  
Youve gotta come with me I cannot stand this place  
Were falling off the world and Ill give in this way  
We had a chance to run and now I cant believe  
Were going all the way and all the affairs embrace  
  
My life worry life is story  
Give up beating  
Ill start needing  
  
The life the hurt the pain the hate  
The life the hurt the pain the hate  
The life the hurt the pain the hate  
Will he keep fuckin with me Theres nowhere else to go  
  
So I walk but seem to crawl  
For Im giving in today  
Now I run into a wall  
Cause I cannot fight my way  
  
Youve gotta come with me I cannot stand this place  
Were falling off the world and Ill give in this way  
We had a chance to run and now I cant believe  
Were going all the way and all the affairs embrace Embrace Embrace x4

What really do I have to follow  
Nothing makes sense at all  
Taking something for nothing  
Watch me as I fall

Youve gotta come with me I cannot stand this place  
Were falling off the world and Ill give in this way  
We had a chance to run and now I cant believe  
Were going all the way and all the affairs embrace x2
