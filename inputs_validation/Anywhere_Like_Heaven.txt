When I walk along your city streets and look into your eyes  
When I see that simple sadness that upon your features lies  
If my spirit starts to sink it comes as no surprise  
Its been a long way from anywhere like heaven to your town this town  
  
Theres a pasture in the countryside I used to call my own  
Theres a natural pillow for my head the grass theres overgrown yes and no  
I think of that place from time to time when I want to be alone  
Its been a long way from anywhere like heaven to your town this town  
  
Now people live from day to day but they do not count the time  
They dont see the days slipping by and neither do I  
  
Now people they live from day to day but they do not count the time no  
They dont see their days slipping by and neither do I  
  
When I walk along your city streets and look into your eyes  
When I see that simple sadness that upon your features lies I see lines  
If my spirit starts to sink it comes as no surprise  
Its been a long way from anywhere like heaven to your town this town
