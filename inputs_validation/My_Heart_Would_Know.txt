I could say its over now  
That I was glad to see you go  
I could hate you for the way Im feelin  
My lips could tell a lie but my heart would know  
  
Its a sin to make me cry  
When you know I love you so  
I could tell my heart that I dont miss you  
My lips could tell a lie but my heart would know  
  
I could give you all the blame  
But Im sure the truth would show  
I could tell this world Ive found a new love  
My lips could tell a lie but my heart would know  
  
I cant fool my cryin heart  
Cause it knows I need you so  
I could tell my heart Im glad we parted  
My lips could tell a lie but my heart would know
