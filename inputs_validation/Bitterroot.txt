Tonight Ill be sleeping on the mountain top  
I got a billion stars for my witness  
In the morning Ill go down and the sun comes up  
And Ill take a drink from the bitter root river  
  
Have you been lonely  
yes Ive been lonely  
Ive been lonely too  
  
Have you been lonely  
yes Ive been lonely  
Ive been lonely too  
  
Tonight Ill be sleeping on the mountain top  
I got a billion stars for my witness  
In the morning Ill go down and the sun comes up  
Ill take a drink from the bitter root river  
  
Have you been traveling  
yes Ive been traveling  
Ive been traveling too  
  
that girl can play  
  
Have you been traveling  
yes Ive been traveling  
Ive been traveling too  
  
lordy help me to play  
  
Tonight Ill be sleeping on the mountain top  
I got a billion stars for my witness  
In the morning Ill go down and the sun comes up  
Ill take a drink from the bitter root river  
Ill take a drink from the bitter root river  
Ill take a drink from the bitter root river
