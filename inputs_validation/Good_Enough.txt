US prime grade A stamped guaranteed  
Just grease it up and bring on the heat  
Throw it down and roll it over once or twice  
Then chow down  
  
Chorus  
Shes good enough good enough to huh  
I cant get enough I cant get enough  
Shes good enough to huh  
  
Hey me yea I been working up an appetite  
Seems like the harder I work the more my body needs  
I like to open up with a little six on the half shell  
Then its threesixnine times  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey waitress you got any specials here tonight  
Me and the fellas might be interested in  
Rack a what  
Well Ill have some of that  
Ill be the first to say that Im blind to the world  
Cause Im two days gone and I just cant see  
But I aint no fool and honey I know a good thing  
And shes comin shes comin  
So come on come on come on cause shes  
Good good good enough  
Good good good enough  
Good good good enough  
Good good good enough ohhh
