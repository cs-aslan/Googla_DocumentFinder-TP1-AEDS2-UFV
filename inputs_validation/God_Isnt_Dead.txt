Ah look at all the lonely people losing faith  
In a world full of despair No one who cares  
Wondering where God disappeared  
  
I see the pain in everybodys faces asking why  
The God up in the sky didnt say goodbye  
Please tell me God didnt die  
  
Please tell me God isnt dead  
Please tell me God isnt dead  
Please tell me God isnt  
I wanna know if hes  
Please tell me God isnt  
Tell me God isnt dead  
  
I wanna know
