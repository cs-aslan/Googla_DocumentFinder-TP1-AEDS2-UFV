She married when she was twenty  
She thought she was ready  
Now shes not so sure  
She thought shed done some living  
But now shes just wonderin  
What shes living for  
Now shes feeling that theres something more  
  
Chorus  
Is there life out there  
So much she hasnt done  
Is there life beyond  
Her family and her home  
Shes done what she should  
Should she do what she dares  
She doesnt want to leave  
Shes just wonderin  
Is there life out there  
  
Shes always lived for tomorrow  
Shes never learned how  
To live for today  
Shes dyin to try something foolish  
Do something crazy  
Or just get away  
Something for herself for a change  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a place in the sun that shes never been  
Where life is fair and time is a friend  
Would she do it the same as she did back then  
She looks out the window and wonders again  
  
Chorus x2
