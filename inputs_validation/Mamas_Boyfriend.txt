Chorus  
I never liked you nggas  
Who knew one day Id be just like you nggas  
Uh uh uh alright you nggas  
Uh uh uh alright you nggas  
When I become my mamas boyfriends  
When I become my mamas boyfriends  
  
He walked in our lives  
I was only five  
Superman pajamas I was super duper fly  
Sitting here like why he at least supersize  
You know I scrutinise like who this newer guy  
Im my mama boyfriend Im her little husband  
I was the man of the house when there wasnt  
Trying to get to know homie just kill the charm  
You aint interested in me you just tryna fck my mum  
We are the voices of our parents bad choices  
The aftermath of divorces  
The kids of bitter split ups  
And baby sitters  
Grand parents that dont know what to do with us  
And the last thing I want to see is mamas new ngga  
You old Old Spice wearing  
Short chain wearing  
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing  
Church sock wearing  
When you first stop caring about your appearance  
When you get here anyway I already got parents  
Dont try to put me inline I already got crayons  
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance  
Keep your hands of my mama how I need to got clearance  
Yeah I know she look good but you need to stop staring  
I drew a picture of her that would make her proud  
But the door was locked and the tv up so loud  
I scream out I aint going to sleep no time soon  
And when I do Im sleeping in my mama room  
  
I dont like you ngga  
If I was old enough I would fight you ngga  
I wanna run over you in my bike you ngga  
Dont go to sleep at night you ngga  
  
And it seems like I wasted time  
If thats what its all about  
Mama if thats moving up than I  
  
When I become my mamas boyfriends  
Twenty years later where has the time gone  
Now you see Im dating having problems of my own  
Now that Im grown the tables turned around  
I never thought Id ever raise another nggas child  
He dont like his mamas boyfriend  
Just like me dont wanna do the wrong thing  
Thats very un Spike Lee but he be like he go round his mama then  
Cause when she here he be quiet  
When she leave he be talking again  
He be wylin again  
Be calm I dont drink the drama  
A sip of Dom TylerPerryon  
You gon marry my mom look  
I dont read palms and I dont read psalms  
And I did take little man to church  
And took little man to school  
Look littl eman kids dont make the rules  
Even though I aint raised you  
You your mama angel  
Dont get it twisted baby boy Ill Ving Rhames you  
  
Chorus  
  
When I become my mamas boyfriends
