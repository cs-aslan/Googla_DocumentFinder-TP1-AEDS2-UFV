How do I say goodbye to what we had  
The good times that made us laugh  
Outweigh the bad  
  
I thought wed get to see forever  
But forevers gone away  
Its so hard to say goodbye to yesterday  
  
I dont know where this road  
Is going to lead  
All I know is where weve been  
And what weve been through  
  
If we get to see tomorrow  
I hope its worth all the wait  
Its so hard to say goodbye to yesterday  
  
And Ill take with me the memories  
To be my sunshine after the rain  
Its so hard to say goodbye to yesterday  
  
And Ill take with me the memories  
To be my sunshine after the rain  
Its so hard to say goodbye to yesterday  
Its so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
