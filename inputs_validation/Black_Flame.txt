Incinerate my skin  
And touch me far far beyond  
Burn me out my sin  
And take me deeper underground  
I know its way too late  
When this dance has begun  
So put on the heat  
And let the fire run  
Take me away my black flame  
Immaculate you are  
In your tender violence  
And when you touch my heart  
Ill always lower my defense  
Dont let me wait too long  
Cause I dont like to be save  
We know we cant go wrong  
On our way through time and space  
Take me away my black flame
