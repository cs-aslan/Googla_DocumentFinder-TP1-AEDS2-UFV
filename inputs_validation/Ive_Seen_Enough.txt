You got to lock your doors keep the world out  
Were closin ourselves in  
If you watch the news itll scare you to death  
To hell and back again  
The only justice heres at the wrong end of a gun  
Got the criminal makin the laws got the good men on the run  
Ive seen enough  
  
We dont own anything weve got weve givin it all away  
But that dont make no sense to me you know whos gonna pay  
Its the man in the factory workin twelve hours a day  
The woman workin in the restaurant with another kid on the way  
  
Chorus  
Isnt anything in this life sacred anymore  
We cant lose what weve got its worth fightin for  
Ive seen enough Ive seen enough to make a grown man cry  
  
A mans standin by the road a sign in his hand  
He dont want your charity he says I aint no beggar man  
All I need is a chance to get back on my feet  
But we just pass him by well it could be you or me  
Ive seen enough  
I aint the kind to just sit back and watch the world go round  
Its not too late to change lets turn this shit around  
  
Chorus
