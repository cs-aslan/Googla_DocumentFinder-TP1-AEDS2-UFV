Wind me up and see what I can do for you  
Switch me on Id do anything you want me to  
Let me go and I come ticking like a time bomb  
Just call my name and I come running like a marathon  
  
The magic and the mystery  
Out here on this field of dreams  
  
When Saturday comes  
Nothing else matters to me  
When Saturday comes  
You got to wear your heart on your sleeve  
When Saturday comes  
Nothing else matters to me  
When Saturday comes  
The winner takes it all  
So dont let me down dont you let me down  
  
Sweat and blood You know I couldnt give why any of this  
Pain and pride there aint no room for second best  
Clock strikes three and its time to be the hero  
Dyou want to be a Blade its a feeling that youll never know  
  
Youve got to fight it tooth and nail  
Out here on this Battlefield  
  
When Saturday comes  
Nothing else matters to me  
When Saturday comes  
You got to wear your heart on your sleeve  
When Saturday comes  
Nothing else matters to me  
When Saturday comes  
The winner takes it all  
So dont let me down dont you let me down  
  
The magic and the mystery  
Out here on this field of dreams  
  
When Saturday comes  
Nothing else matters to me  
When Saturday comes  
You got to wear your heart on your sleeve  
When Saturday comes  
Nothing else matters to me  
When Saturday comes  
You got to wear your heart  
You got to wear your heart  
  
When Saturday comes  
Nothing else matters to me  
When Saturday comes  
You got to wear your heart on your sleeve  
When Saturday comes  
Nothing else matters to me  
When Saturday comes  
You got to wear your heart  
You got to wear your heart  
When Saturday comes
