I feel world is cheatin  
My heart is barely beatin  
Like alone wolf in the pack  
  
No one to believe in  
Tryin to fight these demons  
Where Im goings where Im at  
  
Like high plains drifters  
And midnight misters  
Dancin with the devils rock n roll  
Dirt poor playboys  
And drug store cowboys  
Hey rebel soul  
  
Ive been a man of reason  
Only to end up even  
Ive paid the price of givin back  
  
Low down and double dealing  
Up on the mountain kneeling  
I fell your love is just a trap  
  
Like high plains drifters  
And midnight misters  
Siftin though the devils pot o gold  
Dirt poor playboys  
And drug store cowboys  
Hey rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
  
I feel just like Im trapped by nighttime  
I sleep with one eye open in the day  
Ive walked the wrong way but Ive walked a long way  
  
Hey rebel soul  
  
Touched by the hand of treason  
Im through with not believin  
Im leavin town my bags are packed  
  
And if you feel the need when  
You finally find your feelings  
Youll know just where to find me at  
  
With high plains drifters  
And midnight misters  
Dancin with the devils rock n roll  
Dirt poor playboys  
And drug store cowboys  
Hey rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
Oh rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
Oh rebel soul
