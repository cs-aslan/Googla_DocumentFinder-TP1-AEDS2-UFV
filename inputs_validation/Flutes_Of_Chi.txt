Everything that you are  
That youd like to be  
Will come in three my friend  
  
Times thine inequity  
The flutes of the chi  
Will sound again my friend  
  
Wrap yourself up in gold  
The fruits of the old  
Are ripe to be told my friend  
  
For its not what you are  
How youve come to be  
All this will will end and begin again  
  
Everything that you are  
That youd like to be  
Will come in three my friend  
  
Times thine inequity  
The flutes of the chi  
Will sound again my friend
