With stocking face I bought a gun  
The plan was set the plan was done  
Looked at my watch and started for the door  
Now the food here aint so good no more  
And they closed the package store  
  
Chorus  
Love your mama love your brother  
Love em till they run for cover  
Turn the light off keep your shirt on  
Cry a jag on me  
  
Oh Michael Oh Jesus you know Im not to blame  
You know my reputation for playing a good clean game  
Oh Michael Oh Jesus Ill keep my promise when  
You turn that heartbeat over again  
  
My poisons named you know my brand  
So please make mine a double Sam  
Stir it up nice Ill eat it right here  
This highway runs from Paraguay  
And Ive just come all the way  
  
Chorus  
  
We warned the corpse of William Wright  
Not to cuss and drink all night  
Ticket in hand I saw him laid to rest  
But zombie see and zombie do  
Hes here with me and you  
  
Chorus
