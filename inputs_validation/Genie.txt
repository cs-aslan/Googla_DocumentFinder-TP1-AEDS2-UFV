One Way Street  
I let the genie out of the box  
I let the genie out of the box  
Im scared of everything I am  
I let the genie out of the box  
Im scared of opening the can  
I let the genie out of the box  
I had this recurring dream  
I was living another life  
In another country  
In another time  
As I got older the dream began to fade away  
Until one day  
There she was tapping me on my shoulder  
She says shes got so much to say  
But shes not telling it today  
She said Come back when youre alone  
But Im not sure I want to know  
Cause maybe her road  
Is a oneway street  
Maybe her road  
Im scared of everything I am  
Im scared of opening the can  
Im scared of losing who I am  
Think I mightve taken all I can  
I let the genie out of the box  
She said theres a house in your mind  
An attic of treasure a forgotten pleasure park  
Waiting inside you in the dark  
Dont leave it behind  
Dont leave it behind  
Im scared of everything I am  
Im scared of opening the can  
Im scared of losin who I am  
Think I mightve taken all I can  
I let the genie out of the box  
I let the genie out of the box  
Out of the box
