After years of waiting nothing came  
As your life flashed before your eyes  
You realize  
  
Im a reasonable man  
Get off get off get off my case x2  
Im a reasonable man  
Get off my case  
Get off my case  
  
After years of waiting  
After years of waiting nothing came  
And you realize youre looking  
Looking in the wrong place  
  
Im a reasonable man  
Get off my case x2  
Im a reasonable man  
Get off my case x2  
Im a reasonable man  
Get off my case x3  
  
After years of waiting  
Youre a reasonable man  
Get off our case x3  
Im a reasonable man  
Get off my case x3  
  
Im a reasonable man  
Get off my case x3  
Im a reasonable man  
Get off my case x3
