Dont say you love me when its just a rumor  
Dont say a word if there is any doubt  
Sometimes I think that love is just a tumor  
Youve got to cut it out  
  
You say youre sorry for the things that youve done  
You say youre sorry but you know you dont mean it  
I wouldnt worry I had so much fun  
Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being  
  
Its you not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue  
Its you not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue  
Oh yeah  
  
Get to the slot machine almost dead on arrival  
Just hit me one more time with that live wire  
Maybe they told you you were only a girl in a million  
You say Ive got no feelings this is a good way to kill them  
  
Select the control and then insert the token  
You want to throw me away but Im not broken  
Youve got a lot to saywell Im not joking  
There are some words they dont allow to be spoken  
Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being  
  
Its you not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
