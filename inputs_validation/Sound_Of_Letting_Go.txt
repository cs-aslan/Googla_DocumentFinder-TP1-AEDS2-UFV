This is the point of no return  
Cause this is where we crash and burn  
And now every time i face this pain  
I can hear it coming back again  
Its the sound of letting go  
  
Its the sound of letting go  
Its the sound of letting go  
Its the sound of letting go  
Its the sound of letting go  
  
Breaking up and breaking down  
This is what weve come to now  
Whats the use we cant deny  
Cant you hear it  
Its the sound of letting go  
  
We could go around all day  
Fine excuses we can say  
In the silence i can hear  
Cant you feel it  
Its the sound of letting go  
  
Its getting louder and louder  
What we gonna do  
Its getting louder and louder  
Fillin up the room  
I can hear it hear it  
Comin over us  
  
I can hear it tellin me that we had enough  
  
Its getting louder and louder  
What we gonna do  
Its getting louder and louder  
Fillin up the room  
I can hear it hear it  
Comin over us  
  
Its the sound of letting go  
I know you can hear it  
Its the sound of letting go  
I know we cant deceive it  
  
I know you can hear it  
Its the sound of letting go  
I know we cant deceive it  
Its the sound of letting go  
  
I cant let it break me down  
This is what weve come to now  
Whats the use we cant deny cant you hear it  
Its the sound of letting go  
  
Every time i face this pain  
I hear it coming back again  
And ive been calling out your name cant you hear it  
Its the sound of letting go  
  
I can hear it  
I can hear it  
I can hear it  
  
Its the sound of letting go  
I can hear it  
I can hear it  
Its the sound of letting go  
I can hear it  
I can hear it  
Its the sound of letting go
