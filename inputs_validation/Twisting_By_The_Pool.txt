Were going on a holiday now  
Gonna take a villa a small chalet  
On the Costa del Magnifico  
Where the cost of living is so low  
Yeah were gonna be so neat  
Dance to the Eurobeat  
Yeah were gonna be so cool  
Twisting by the pool  
  
Sitting in a small cafe now  
Swing swing swinging to the cabaret  
You want to see a movie take in a show now  
Meet new people at the disco  
Yeah were gonna be so neat  
Dance to the Eurobeat  
Yeah were gonna be so cool  
Twisting by the pool  
  
And we can still get information  
Reading all about inflation  
And youre never gonna be out of reach  
Theres a callbox on the beach  
  
Mmm youre gonna look so cute  
Sunglasses and a bathing suit  
Be the baby of my dreams  
Like the ladies in the magazines  
Yeah were gonna be so neat  
Dance to the Eurobeat  
Yeah were gonna be so cool  
Twisting by the pool  
  
Im a twisting fool  
Just twisting yeah twisting  
Twisting by the pool
