My brain fed with ecstacy  
Fills my need  
As I feel my body burst with great speed  
And I clench a needle in a blood drained fist  
Then I turn and mark another trip off my list  
AFeel that rushwith that gold  
Satanic dust  
Feel that painthe drug induce through  
My veins  
I will in life as I will in death  
Sow the seeds with every breath  
Never will I runnever will I hide  
Only to express myself and feel it deep  
Inside  
Acid  
Now I dream in comatose neuotic state  
As my paranoia grows I must wait  
Til the feeling of the drug starts to die  
Then Ill hit the drug againtake me high  
B Feel that buzzfor all the goddam  
Good it does  
Feel the flightthat flies me in through  
Day and night  
Now inside my arteries theres no blood
