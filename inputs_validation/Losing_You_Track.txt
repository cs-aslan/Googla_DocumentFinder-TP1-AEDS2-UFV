Elvis Costello  
  
Layin about lying in bed  
Maybe it was somethin I thought I said  
With the tempo of the damned the temptation of tomorrow  
I dont know if I can give you anything but sorrow  
  
They stay alive this late on Radio Five  
But the pen that I write with wont tell the truth  
But the moments that I care about are moments that I treasure  
Better take another measure for pleasure  
  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories dont mean that much to me  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories dont mean that much to me  
  
I count the pages of the letter I write  
One two three four five six seven eight nine  
Tearin up the sheets of love this hand could not disguise  
Ill start to count again and close my eyes  
  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories dont mean that much to me  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories dont mean that much to me  
  
Now youre here  
Im here too  
Can be this easy for me and you  
  
Now youre here  
Im here too  
Be this easy for me and you  
  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories dont mean that much to me  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories dont mean that much to me  
  
Layin about lying in bed  
Could be something that I thought I said
