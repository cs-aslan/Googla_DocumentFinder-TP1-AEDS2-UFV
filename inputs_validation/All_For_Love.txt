When its love you give  
Ill be a man of good faith  
Then in love you live  
Ill make a stand I wont break  
Ill be the rock you can build on  
Be there when youre old  
To have and to hold  
  
When theres love inside  
I swear Ill always be strong  
Then theres a reason why  
Ill prove to you we belong  
Ill be the wall that protects you  
From the wind and the rain  
From the hurt and pain  
  
Lets make it all for one and all for love  
Let the one you hold be the one you want  
The one you need  
Cause when its all for one its one for all  
When theres someone that should know  
Then just let your feelings show  
And make it all for one and all for love  
  
When its love you make  
Ill be the fire in your night  
Then its love you take  
I will defend I will fight  
Ill be there when you need me  
When honors at stake  
This vow I will make  
  
That its all for one and all for love  
Let the one be the one you want  
The one you need  
Cause when its all for one its one for all  
When theres someone that should know  
Then just let your feelings show  
And make it all for one and all for love  
  
Dont lay our love to rest  
Cause we could stand up to the test  
We got everything and more than we had planned  
More than the rivers that run the land  
Weve got it all in our hands  
  
Now its all for one and all for love  
Its all for love  
Let the one you hold be the one you want  
The one you need  
Cause when its all for one its one for all  
Its one for all  
When theres someone that should know  
Then just let your feelings show  
When theres someone that you want  
When theres someone that you need  
Lets make it all all for one and all for love
