Verse 1  
How do I make the phone ring  
Why do I even care  
How are you all around me when youre not really there  
When youre not really there  
How do I feel you on me when youre not on my skin  
Why do you say you want me then tell me Im not coming in  
Baby just come on in  
  
Chorus  
Cause every time Im with you I go into a zone  
And I remember all the places you wanna go  
Take me all the way  
Aint nobody gonna touch it touch it touch it  
Cause every time I see you I dont wanna behave  
Im tired of being patient so lets pick up the pace  
Take me all the way  
Aint nobody gonna touch it touch it touch it  
  
Verse 2  
How do you know Im breathing when Im holding my breath  
Why dont we face the danger just for the night and forget

Cause we both know what we want  
So why dont we fall in love  
Baby lets fall in love  
  
Chorus  
Cause every time Im with you I go into a zone  
And I remember all the places you wanna go

Im tired of being patient so lets pick up the pace  
Take me all the way  
Aint nobody gonna touch it touch it touch it
