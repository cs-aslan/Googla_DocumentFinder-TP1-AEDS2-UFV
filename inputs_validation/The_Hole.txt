The old woman finally caught me  
Sneakin round her cave  
Her hair looked just like barbwire boys  
And her smile just like the grave  
She asked me could I stay awhile  
I said Id better go  
She slid her arm around my neck  
And sweetly whispered no  
  
Its cold and dark and lonely here  
As soon enough youll see  
Im oh so glad you stumbled in  
Ive been cravin company  
I cannot stay too long you know  
I left some friends at home  
Dont you fret about your friends  
Down here were all alone  
  
What about my mother  
I cant just leave her there to mourn  
You dont have to think about her  
Just forget you were ever born  
Ill disappoint my father  
You know he worked so hard for me  
If you have to pay your father back  
Just send him some misery  
  
Ill miss I said a girl I know  
I cant just leave there to pine  
Shes still got plenty of men to go  
Im sure shell do just fine  
What about my little boy  
She said hes just like you  
Let a few short years roll by  
Hell end up down here too  
  
Then her pale green eyes began to glow  
She placed her hand on mine  
She smiled and said dont worry  
Youll get used to me in time  
As her cold tongue flickered toward  
I spun myself around  
Made a dive for the passageway  
But the walls come crashing down  
  
Now her eyes were the only light  
My fevered brain could see  
But I tore myself away from them  
And fell down to my knees  
Ive come too far I cant get back  
I beseeched the Gods of men  
Fame and fortune just laughed at me  
Then silence once again  
  
A whisper deep within  
Embrace the God of Love  
I lifted my face and through the tears  
I saw light fall from above  
  
I hurled myself into the wall  
I ripped and clawed my way  
Through the stinkin clingin loam  
Back to the light of day  
I crawled out into the wind again  
The sky upon my face  
I heard the earth sigh patiently  
As it slid back into place  
  
Now Im back among the ones I love  
Im loved by them in turn  
And its only on the darkest night  
That green eyed memory burns  
So walk my friends in the light of day  
Dont go sneakin round no holes  
There just might be something down there  
Wants to gobble up your soul
