Look at me now a shadow of the man I used to be  
Look through my eyes and through the years of loneliness youll see  
To the times in my life when I could not bear to lose  
A simple game  
And the least of it all was the fortune and the fame  
But the dream seemed to end just as soon as it had begun  
Was I to know  
For the last thing of all that was on my mind  
Was the close at the end of the show  
The shadow of a lonely man feels nobody else  
  
In the shadow of a lonely lonely man  
I can see myself  
  
Looking out of nowhereLooking out of nowhere  
  
But the sound of the crowds when they come to see me now  
Is not the same  
And the jest of it all is I cant recall my name  
But I cling to a hope till I cant hold on anymoreanymore  
And for all the acclaim I am all alone  
And I see as I look through the door  
  
The shadow of a lonely manTheres nobody else  
In the shadow of a lonely lonely man  
I can see myself  
  
Look at me now a shadow of the man I used to be
