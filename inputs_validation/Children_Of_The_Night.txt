Im getting ready  
Im in the mood to fool around  
Its time for action  
Now the boys are back in town  
  
So turn up the music  
Make it loud and proud  
Lets see reaction  
Let the spotlight hit the crowd  
  
Dont hide what you feel inside  
Dont let anybody stand in your way  
Just let the music take you higher  
  
Now are you ready to rock  
Children of the night  
Are you ready to roll  
Children of the night  
  
You got the power  
I feel your fire in my soul  
You got the fever  
Cause you were born to rock an roll  
Dont run for cover  
Im gonna show you what Ive learned  
Just come a little closer  
Come on an get your fingers burned  
  
Dont hide what you feel inside  
Dont let anybody stand in your way  
Just let the music take you higher  
  
Now are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to roll  
Are you ready to rock  
  
Now are you ready to rock  
Children of the night  
Are you ready to roll  
Children of the night  
  
Im getting ready  
Im in the mood to fool around  
Its time for action  
Cause now the boys are back in town  
  
Dont hide what you feel inside  
Dont let anybody stand in your way  
Just let the music take you higher  
  
Now are you ready to rock  
Children of the night
