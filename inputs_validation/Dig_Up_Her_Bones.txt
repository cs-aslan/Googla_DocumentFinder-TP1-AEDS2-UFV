Anything is what she is  
Anywhere is where shes from  
Anything is what shell be  
Anything as long as its mine  
And the door it opens is the way back in  
Or is it the way back out  
  
Anyplace is where shell be  
Anyplace shell see you from  
Lies and secrets become your world  
Any time anywhere she takes me away  
And death climbs up the steps one by one  
To give you the rose  
Thats been burnt by her son  
  
Point me to the sky above  
I can get there on my own  
Walk me to the graveyard  
Dig up her bones  
  
I have seen the demons face  
I have heard of her death place  
I fall down on my knees in praise of the  
Horrible things that took her away  
And death climbs up the steps one by one  
To give you the rose  
Thats been burnt by her son  
  
Point me to the sky above  
I can get there on my own  
Walk me to the graveyard  
Dig up her bones  
  
Point me to the sky above  
I can get there on my own  
Walk me to the graveyard  
Dig up her bones  
  
Bones
