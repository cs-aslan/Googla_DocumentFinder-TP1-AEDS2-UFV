Send me some loving  
Send it I pray  
How can I love you  
When youre far away  
Oh send me your picture  
Send it my dear  
So I can hold it  
Pretend you are near  
  
Cant you send me your kisses  
I can feel their touch  
I need you so badly  
I miss you so much  
  
My days are so lonely  
My nights are so blue  
Im here and Im lonely  
Im waiting for you  
  
Cant you send me your kisses  
I can feel their touch  
I miss you so badly  
I need you so much  
  
My days are so lonely  
My nights are so blue  
Im here and Im lonely  
Im waiting for you
