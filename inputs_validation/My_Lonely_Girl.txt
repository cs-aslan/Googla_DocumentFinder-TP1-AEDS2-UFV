Oh love is no colour love is emotion  
Its like heaven here to me  
And love is the answer to all of your questions  
Love is like eternity  
Ill love you forever  
And I miss your lonely heart  
Can we stay together oh baby dont you tear apart  
  
My lonely girl  
Oh lonely hearts and lonely memories  
You are my lonely girl  
You are destiny  
My lonely girl come hear my heart  
Ill be only there for you  
My lonely girl well try a start  
You are heaven swear its true  
  
Love is the reason that Im living  
sometimes lonely sometimes pain  
Love is a stranger to all of your questions  
Love is never be the same  
Love is like an ocean  
You can run but you cant hide  
The greatest devotion baby cant you see the light  
  
Youre like an orchestra of angels  
And I never I never let you go
