Dont make a move  
Dont make a sound  
Ive got my eyes trained on you  
The target is found  
  
You waited too long  
Soon youll be gone  
Id rather stand on my own  
Aint no more blanks left to fill  
In my list of sins  
Im at the end of my rope  
  
The louder you speak  
The less I hear  
I gotta let off some steam  
and driven by fear  
  
Tell me Im wrong  
cause this cant go on  
Id rather stand on my own  
Aint no more blanks left to fill  
In my list of sins  
Im at the end of my rope  
  
Leave me alone  
This cant go on  
Not anymore no  
  
You waited too long  
Listen and soon youll be gone  
Tell me Im wrong  
Cause this cant go on
