Let me inside you  
Into your room  
Ive heard its lined  
With the things you dont show  
Lay me beside you  
Down on the floor  
Ive been your lover  
From the womb to the tomb  
I dress as your daughter  
When the moon becomes round  
You be my mother  
When everythings gone  
  
And she will always carry on  
Something is lost  
But something is found  
They will keep on speaking her name  
Somethings change  
Some stay the same  
  
Keep beckoning to me  
From behind that closed door  
The maid and the mother  
And the crone thats grown old  
  
I hear your voice  
Coming out of that hole  
I listen to you  
And I want some more  
I listen to you  
And I want some more  
  
And she will always carry on  
Something is lost  
But something is found  
They will keep on speaking her name  
Some things change  
Some stay the same
