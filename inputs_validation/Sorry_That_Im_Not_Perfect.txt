Miley  Theres a photo of me being kissed by a dude  
And Annie Leibovitz tryina get me nude  
For those of you who think thats very crude  
Im sorry that Im not perfect  
  
I never stole a necklace or got a dui  
I never cheated on my wife like that golfer guy  
So what you can see a little boob from the side  
Im sorry that Im not perfect  
  
And sure I danced on a pole  
And people called it sinning  
But at least I didnt date a porn star  
And tell everyone Im winning  
  
A Guy And A Girl Walk On Stage  
  
Girl  She never made a dirty tape and passed it along  
Guy  She didnt text a photo of her dong  
Miley  Dont both of these things seem worse than a bong   
Im sorry  
Im so Sorry  
Im really sorry That Im not perfect
