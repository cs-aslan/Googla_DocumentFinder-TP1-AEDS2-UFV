Verse 1  
He was a wild boy  
She was a crazy girl  
Together they were  
Wild and Crazy  
They would roam the streets at night  
Together they were partners in crime  
Sleep all day  
Roam all nite  
Like two little nocturnal rodents in a forest  
Stick together til the very end  
  
Chorus  
Wild and Crazy  
Everybody knows their names  
Wild and Crazy  
Lovers Friends Partners Wild and Crazy  
Coworkers Enemies Comrades Wild and Crazy  
Everybody knows their names  
oooooh ahhhhhh  
ahhhhh ohhhhhh  
  
Verse 2  
Whenever they came around  
Everyone else would leave  
But they didnt even pay em no heed  
Just walked on hand in hand  
If there were meadows and gardens there  
Im sure they would have been  
Frolickin and playin all day long  
Mindin their own buisness  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
Oohwee Watch em go  
They look too happy  
To be true  
Oohwee Watch em go  
They look too happy  
To be true  
Oohwee Watch em go  
They look too happy  
To be true  
ahah oh  
ahah oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Wild and Crazy  
Watch em go  
ahah oh  
ahah oh  
ahah oh  
Until fade
