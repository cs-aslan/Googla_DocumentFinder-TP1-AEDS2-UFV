Im talking bout roots  
I cant hate where Im from

But now I got me me  
Thats because of my roots yeah yeah yeah yeah

Hey I cant be mad at what yall meet ahead  
I dont regret my ghetto struggle due to my success  
It aint that beautiful to write on overcoming stress  
Top ramen noodles thank pappy for the fact I was fed  
Look at me now but all before hey Mr skid row  
The dirty south aint just a name the way Ive been poor  
The projects burnin white I call it gizmo  
Went from a gun to them cars in a jigga video  
Cant find a meal to a mil only god know it  
No record deal to a deal I work hard for it  
Can I live to Im livin like my momma told it  
Before you rip it gotta sew it  
Yeah

Hey still on my coupe but cant take  
Somebody had to be just to get away  
My sister had to leave I respect her stayin safe  
Oh yea I had to grieve but Im stronger to this day  
Pain I cant ignore it you might say Im ignorant  
Im mistakin for courage which victory so gorgeous  
Make it through two bush I can make it through any forest  
Hunger gave me the wish but the bottom is so important  
37 Ave and 187 Street Miami karat city now Im part of a legacy  
Im thankful for the hood what is love without jealousy  
Theres only five letters really help me  
  
Im talking bout roots  
I cant hate where Im from  
Cause where Im from made me cause where Im from made me  
I came from the bottom of the slums  
But now I got me me  
Thats because of my roots yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Im talking bout roots yeah yeah yeah  
Im talking bout roots  
  
Hey I know the seeds been planted  
Its damaging my soul but my dreams been granted  
That triple life towards much deeper than nurse planet  
What could I want more than redoing I never planned it  
Gets no lower than a grabbin on your feet  
A man will stand for nothin if he fall off with the feet  
A baller and a hitter all in the street  
If you look beneath the sand then we all need a crease  
Roots before the branches roots before mansions  
Roots before your paper crazier than Marilyn Manson  
Roots with your grandparents roots under your canvas  
Roots whether you black white or spanish  
  
Im talking bout roots  
I cant hate where Im from  
Cause where Im from made me cause where Im from made me  
I came from the bottom of the slums  
But now I got me me  
Thats because of my roots yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Im talking bout roots yeah yeah yeah  
Im talking bout roots
