Linda works the diner pourin coffee slingin hash  
She said I wouldnt have come in today  
But I really need the cash  
I know I cant fool anyone cause dark glasses tell no lies  
But makeup wont cover up a blackened eye  
Oh oh oh no  
  
You see Jimmy works construction now  
But yesterday it rained  
So he went down to the liquor store  
And by noon he felt no pain  
I came in an hour late then I let his supper burn  
Well he hit the roof hit the wall  
And then it was my turn  
  
He said A mans home is his castle  
It always has been and so it remains  
But he holds the keys in a fist of rage  
His home is his castle  
And mine is a cage  
  
Someone much have heard the noise and they dialed 911  
And the cop that showed up at the door asked  
Is there a problem son  
Jimmy smiled and said No sir just a little fight thats all  
Hey you know how it gets sometimes  
When youre layin down the law  
Oh oh oh no  
  
So I pulled out my suitcase I started packin up my clothes  
And Jimmy said Now Linda where do you expect to go with those  
I told him I have tried but not an ounce of love survives  
Well he grabbed my wrist and shouted  
Youre not leavin here alive  
  
She said Im savin up my money and when I get the nerve Ill run  
But Jim dont give up easily so I intend to buy a gun  
He will never see the way he treats me is a crime  
Somebody oughta lock him up but Im the one  
Whos done the time  
  
He said A mans home is his castle  
It always has been and so it remains  
But he holds the keys in a fist of rage  
His home is his castle  
And mine is a cage
