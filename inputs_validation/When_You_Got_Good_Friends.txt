You got to love ol Charlie Daniels  
You got to cut the rug with Wet Willie too  
And you got to be a fan of the Marshall Tucker Band  
Before Ill sit down and have a drink with you  
Yes Bakersfield has got ol Merle Haggard  
Hes a bad bad boy yes indeed  
Nashvilles got a million and one guitar pickers  
But I guess my favorite would be the CDB  
  
Chorus  
Yes theres a few good rockers in New York City  
Guess the big la it never cared for me  
So wont you tell all them Hollywierd writer people  
That it just dont make a damn  
When you got good friends like me  
  
Never dick on good ol Waylon Jennings  
Or Willie Nelson Bob Wills or me  
Well theyre playin that good ol countrywestern  
You know this thing they call the Texas swing  
  
Chorus
