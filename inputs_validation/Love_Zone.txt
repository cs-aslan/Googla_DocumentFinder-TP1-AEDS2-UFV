Been awake all night cant get no sleep  
I need a steel blue heart walkin down the street  
With your razor nails and your painted smile  
Youre gonna get richer I gotta get wild  
  
Anytime you want to  
Anyway you need  
Get your love for money there satisfaction guaranteed  
  
Wo oh love zone  
You know what I mean  
Wo oh love zone  
Live that fantasy  
  
Im behind the wheel throttle open wide  
The gas tanks full do you want to ride  
Drivin in the fast lane at night  
I cant keep my eyes off your red tail light  
  
You know where were goin  
I know where where are  
Set the rear view mirror for  
The backseat or the car  
  
Wo oh love zone  
You know what I mean  
Wo oh love zone  
Live that fantasy  
  
In your leather and chrome youre all the rage  
All you want to do is get backstage  
You heard all the stories are they true  
The rock n roll circus is calling you  
  
When you get there baby  
Youll be hypnotized  
Never seen nothin like it no  
You wont believe your eyes  
  
Wo oh love zone  
You know what I mean  
Wo oh love zone  
Live that fantasy  
  
Wo oh love zone  
You know what I mean  
Wo oh love zone  
Live that fantasy  
  
Everybody get in  
Everybody get in that love zone
