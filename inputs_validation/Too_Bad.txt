Too many times Ive seen your kind  
Washed upon the shore  
Too many times you locked me out  
Johnny knockin knocking at your door  
  
Youre looking past the mirror  
Yes youve reached the other side  
Youre striving for the pinnacle  
But youre holding on too tight  
  
And when you hold the ticket  
For your one way ride  
You wonder where youre going  
And you cant hide  
  
Too bad too bad too bad too bad johnny  
What you gonna do  
Too bad too bad too bad too bad johnny  
Now your time is through  
  
So many highs and lows right now  
What are we to do  
You know were trying so damn hard  
Johnny just to try and talk to you  
  
Youre swimming in an ocean  
Its so black and cold  
I feel you got the notion  
And its eating at your soul  
  
And when you hold the ticket  
For your one way ride  
You wonder where youre going  
And you cant hide  
  
Too bad too bad too bad too bad johnny  
What you gonna do  
Too bad too bad too bad too bad johnny  
Now your time is through  
  
She said she knew the answer  
He was falling  a falling faster  
Round and round and round  no where to go  
Someone had to help the boy  
He said no no no no no no no  
  
So many mixed emotions  
And theyre driving you insane  
A grip on some reality  
Silence quiet on your window pain  
  
Youre looking past the mirror  
Yes youve reached the other side  
Youre striving for the pinnacle  
But youre holding on too tight
