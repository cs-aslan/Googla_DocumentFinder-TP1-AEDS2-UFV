Id like to see you  
Ill take your hand  
And when I pull out  
Youll understand  
See me when youre lookin for love  
A naked lie from the heavens above  
  
Ive been around  
Since I dont know when  
Ive got some lovers  
That you could rent  
I seek you when Im diggin for gold  
I feel alive since my soul was sold  
  
Im scared thinkin about the 4th of July  
Cant seem to fight it it cant be denied  
Ive got more than that on my brain  
Ive got so much itll drive you insane  
  
You drive Ill steer  
Everybody else steer clear  
Cause Im sitting pretty  
Im in the lap of luxury  
Im in the lap of luxury  
Cause when I get to the top  
And I dont want to stop  
Cause I like it like it  
I love it love it  
I like it a lot wooo  
  
You want a real look  
At paradise  
Simple pleasures  
Just wont suffice  
See me when youre lookin for love  
A naked lie from the heavens above  
  
Im in color and youre black and white  
Lets start the rumors from heaven tonight

Come up and see me if you want a taste yeah
