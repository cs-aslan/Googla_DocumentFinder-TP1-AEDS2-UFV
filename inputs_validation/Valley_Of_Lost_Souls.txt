I hit the highway  
Touch life barely sixteen  
No angel of mercy  
Coming down to save the soul of me  
  
I took a Greyhound limousine  
Straight to grand central NYC  
It was ass gas or grass living fast  
Nobody rides for free  
  
Chorus  
Living it up giving it up  
Living in the valley of lost souls  
Wanting it all taking the fall  
Living in the valley of lost souls  
  
Miss Misery come ride me  
How I love her company  
She did Boston justice  
And wronged all the right out of me  
  
The devil wears a black suit  
He says Im livin like a bum  
So what Im looking like Im half dead  
A gypsy on the run  
  
Chorus  
  
Feels like times running out on me  
But I wasnt born to play nobodys fool  
Aint nobody gonna hold me down to play nobodys fool  
Aint nobody gonna hold me down  
Ive gotta roll roll roll roll roll roll  
  
Somebody save me
