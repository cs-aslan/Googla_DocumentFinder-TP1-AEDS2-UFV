Once upon a time I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye  
And we caught onto something  
I hold onto the night you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me  
  
Were you just kidding  
Cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down  
We almost never speak  
I dont feel welcome anymore  
Baby what happened Please tell me  
  
Cause one second it was perfect now youre halfway out the door  
  
And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called  
And you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all  
And you flashback to when he said forever and always  
Oh and it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone  
Cause I was there when you said forever and always  
  
Was I out of line  
Did I say something way to honest made you run and hide  
Like a scared little boy  
I looked into your eyes  
Though I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure  
  
So heres to everything coming down to nothing  
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core  
Where is this going Though I knew for a minute but I dont anymore  
  
You didnt mean it baby I dont think so  
  
Oh back up baby back up  
Did you forget everything  
Back up baby back up  
Did you forget everything  
  
Cause it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when youre here and it rains when your gone  
Cause I was there when you said forever and always  
  
Oh I stare at the phone he still hasnt called  
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all  
And the flashback to when you said forever and always  
  
And it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone  
Cause I was there when you said forever and always  
You didnt mean it baby  
You said forever and always Yeah
