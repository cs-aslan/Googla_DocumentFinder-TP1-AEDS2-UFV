So ride to it yall vibe to it yall  
  
Goddamn next they hit a nigga in his head with this one  
Im a paint the city red wit this one

See you fuckin wit the boys who tote toys way before Christmas  
No assistance just that persistence with  
That commitment if I dont get it somebody gone die tonight  
I know my vibe is tight  
And I deserve the thrown and if the kid aint right  
Then let me die in this song see Ill be ridin just  
Ridin alone wit my daddy on my mind like you gotta be kiddin  
How the hell you aint here to see ya prince do his thing  
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear but no emotions from a king  
Shell be so I be who I be thats me

Chorus  
Baby you gotta know that Im just out here doin what I gotta do  
For me and you and we eatin  
So bitch why the fuck is you trippin  
Im takin these chances my head to the sky my feet on the ground  
My fingers to the judge if the money dont move  
Then I wont budge wont budge no I wont budge no na  
  
Money is the motivation  
Facin the avenue back touchin the wall  
Got the weed got the gun gotta run when I hear that bird call dang  
Hop in that thang and merk off swerve off  
You know me they call me Birdman Junior  
Anybody murderer if Birdman sponsor it  
Phantom of the opera all black gwop tent locked in  
I can let them shots out you cant get no shots in  
Bulletproof leave a nigga wit a bullet roof  
Shoot ya in ya mouth Leroy they call em bullet tooth  
Im like what it do what it do  
Theres a full court pressure  
Im just going for the two if Im open for the three  
Im a take it in a second even if theres one second and Im a make it its
nothin  
I dont take it for granted I dont take it for nothin  
I take it for what it is worth to the turf motherfucker yea  
  
Chorus  
  
I aint never killed nobody I promise I promise if you try me  
He gone have to rewind this track and make me go back  
That thing will go blat that boy will lay flat so flat  
That act is what I perform amongst you haters  
Got Nina in my palm and Im masturbatin  
Black Peter Pan flies til I die what you sayin  
Bathing Ape Yves Saint Evisu what I stay in  
Got me feelin like Scarface like the Koheba  
Streets reply I look right in a four seater  
You know I be out here ridin a four seater  
Top floor of the four seasons four of them whores  
And they all know how to cook it up and look I got some  
But only one know how the bag bitch bundle up  
See its a cold world so homey bundle up  
We aint on this grind for nothin so get ya hustle up  
  
Chorus x2
