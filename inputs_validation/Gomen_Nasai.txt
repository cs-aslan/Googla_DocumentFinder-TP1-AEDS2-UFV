Gomen nasai Im so sorry gomen nasai  
I am so sorry I made you cry  
Wont you forgive me dear  
Goman nasai nights have been lonely  
My days are blue because I made a fool of you  
Wont you forgive me dear  
My butterfly heart has brought you pain  
Wont you forgive wont you forget  
Lets be sweethearts again  
Goman nasai nights would be heaven  
Love fill my days  
If youd believe me when I say  
I love you gomen nasai  
I love you gomen nasai  
I love you gomen nasai
