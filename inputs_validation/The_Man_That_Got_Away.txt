The night is bitter  
The stars have lost their glitter  
The winds grow colder  
And suddenly youre older  
And all because of the man that got away  
  
No more his eager call  
The writings on the wall  
The dreams you dreamed have all  
Gone astray  
  
The man that won you  
Has gone off and undone you  
That great beginning  
Has seen the final inning  
Dont know what happened  
Its all a crazy game  
  
No more that alltime thrill  
For youve been through the mill  
And never a new love will  
Be the same  
  
Good riddance goodbye  
Every trick of his youre on to  
But fools will be fools  
And wheres he gone to  
  
The road gets rougher  
Its lonelier and tougher  
With hope you burn up  
Tomorrow he may turn up  
Theres just no letup the livelong night and day  
  
Ever since this world began  
There is nothing sadder than  
A oneman woman looking for  
The man that got away  
The man that got away
