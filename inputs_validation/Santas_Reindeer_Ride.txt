Weve got our little fingers workin hard  
On the trains and dolls and cars  
Hurryin cause Santas awaitin  
Soldiers marchin out the door  
Carryin the toys galore  
For Santas reindeer ride  
This is more than just another reindeer ride  
Not a practice run in July  
Weve got to load up all the festive gear  
Peace and hope and yuletide cheer  
For Santas reindeer ride  
Polish the runners shine Rudolphs nose  
Tighten the harness brush off the snow  
Wed love to sing our little working songs  
Wish that we could tag along  
Just to see the childrens faces  
Tonight the world is filled with joy  
Deeper than the games and toys  
Its time to load up the sleigh  
Tonight the world is filled with joy  
Deeper than the games and toys  
Its time to load up the sleigh Its time to load up the sleigh  
For Santas reindeer ride
