Ive been quite the traveler ever since I hit the road  
And the Sullen county carnival has been my earn in gold  
Ive been quite alone since I remember when  
I turned my ultimatums into chips and cashed them in  
  
I used to run the Ferris wheel but thatd be hard to prove  
I cant stand to see a rolling wheel propped up so it cant move  
I used to run the carousel hell thats just round and round  
Never liked to see them ponies painted up and bolted down  
  
The only thing that keeps me from staying here is leaving  
The only thing that saves me from it all is Ill be gone  
Just when I could trust in all the things that I believe in  
I had to pack it up and move along  
And Ill tell you the boys Im not the only one  
  
I was a straight man at the ring toss but that was just a jaunt  
I cant see throwing rings around things you dont really want  
I could run the roller coaster but that might break my heart  
So much hard travelin just to wind up where you start  
  
Now I just work the gateway and Im pretty satisfied  
Little booth is red and blue and I just sit inside  
I just take your money and give tickets out in trade  
Think about my life and all the promises I made  
  
The only thing that keeps me from staying here is leaving  
The only thing that saves me from it all is Ill be gone  
Just when I could trust in all the things that I believe in  
I had to pack it up and move along  
And Ill tell you the boys Im not the only one  
  
Whos running from the things theyve left undone
