A certain softness  
In her eyes  
Fascinates me  
More than I ever thought it would  
A certain softness  
More than I ever thought it could  
  
A certain softness  
In her eyes  
Got me hooked  
Got me hooked  
  
A kind of sadness  
In her smile  
Captivates me  
Surer than anything thats sure  
A kind of sadness  
Surer than anything before  
  
The kind of sadness in a smile  
Got me hooked  
Got me hooked  
Got me hooked  
  
If I could even find the words to tell you  
I wouldnt want to anyway  
Cause that could only break the spell  
And you know very well  
I couldnt betray her  
  
A touch of wildness  
In her style  
Haunts my memory  
More than I ever thought it would  
A touch of wildness  
More than I ever thought it could  
  
A touch of wildness in her style  
Got me hooked  
Got me hooked  
Got me hooked  
  
Repeat first verse
