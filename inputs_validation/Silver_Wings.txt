Silver wings shining in the sunlight  
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight  
Theyre taking you away  
Leaving me lonely  
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight  
Silver wings shining in the sunlight  
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight  
Theyre taking you away  
Leaving me lonely  
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight  
Dont leave me I cry  
Dont take that airplane ride  
But you lock me outta your mind  
Left me standing here behind  
Silver wings shining in the sunlight  
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight  
Theyre taking you away  
Leaving me lonely  
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight  
Slowly fading out of sight  
Slowly fading out of sight
