I cant get enough of what I need  
People all around me lettin me bleed  
Waitin for the darkness to blind the heat  
I make my livin out on the streets  
  
Dirty livin ahh dirty livin  
I cant wait any longer to set myself free  
  
Flashin lights keep runnin through my brain  
Someone find the doctor to ease all the pain  
Traffic in the city is burnin me out  
She makes me want to jump up and shout  
  
Dirty livin ahh dirty livin  
I cant wait any longer to set myself free ahh  
I cant wait any longer to set myself free ahh  
  
No more no more  
Ive gotta get away  
  
Dirty livin dirty livin  
Ahh dirty livin  
  
Late night outta China is due in tonight  
Mother sister brother are lyin uptight  
I can hear the jukebox poundin out loud  
I take my fury out on the crowd  
  
Dirty livin ahh dirty livin  
I cant wait any longer to set myself free ahh  
I cant wait any longer to set myself free ahh  
  
No more no more  
Ive gotta get away  
Dirty livin dirty livin  
Its gettin to me its gettin to me  
I cant wait I cant wait  
Dirty livin dirty livin yeah  
Why dont you set me free
