Tell me prety girl do you know who I am  
Have you ever seen me as your friend  
Anything we have is those hungry nights  
But theres so much left unsatisfied  
  
All those little things you told me  
Aint good enought to show me  
That were gonna make in through the time  
  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And I know that im doin right  
Together we are still so far apart  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And the more I try to be your light  
I cant get any closer to your heart  
  
Now that Im afraid just to ask for more  
Im still waiting as I did before  
If you only sad that its not too late  
We could then rely upon our fate  
  
All those little things you tell me  
Could bear enought to show me  
That were gonna make in through the time  
  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And I know that im tellin right  
Together we are still so far apart  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
That the more I try to be your light  
I cant get any closer to your heart  
  
To your heart  
  
I found out I found out  
  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And I know that im doin right  
Together we are still so far apart  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And the more I try to be your light  
I cant get any closer to your heart  
  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And i know that im doin right  
Together we are still so far apart  
Together we are still so far apart
