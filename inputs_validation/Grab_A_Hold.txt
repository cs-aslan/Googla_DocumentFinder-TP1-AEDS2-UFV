Going to make a confession  
Going to hope that you listen  
Im not a story youve read about  
Im just what I am  
  
And when you open your eyes up  
In the morning you rise up  
Wash yesterday from your face  
And make a new plan  
  
Oh its my fascination with the anticipation  
  
If you want to grab a hold  
If you want to grab a hold  
If you want to grab a hold  
Let it go  
  
Im going to write down a letter  
And maybe some day youll get it  
And know what I meant to say  
And make it ok  
And if ya look at my picture  
You know the one on your dresser  
And if you think that you see a frown  
Turn me upside down  
  
Why dont you use your imagination  
Make it what you have to make it  
  
If you want to grab a hold  
Let it go  
  
You get your grip  
Ill hold you up  
Just reach with your hand  
And then use your imagination  
Make it want you have to make it  
  
If you want to grab a hold  
Let it go Repeat to fade
