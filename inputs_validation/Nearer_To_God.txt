M Greaves  
  
I work in the steel mills  
Where the sun never shines  
The pounding of hammers is all mine  
  
And Ive sailed this wide ocean  
For money and cod  
So far from my loved ones  
But nearer to God  
  
So sing a song for the working man  
And Ill sing you a love song  
  
And my names Wild Bob Conroy  
Im a hard man of old  
Now Im a drinker  
Coming in from the cold  
  
I fought for the fighting  
And I fought for a wage  
And I fight for survival  
Like most men my age
