Youve heard every line before  
My lifes a revolving door  
With no way out and no way in  
You know just whats on my mind  
Could you take a chance one more time  
Maybe we could start all over again  
  
Straight from the heart  
Straight from the heart  
Straight from the heart  
Straight from the heart  
  
Your eyes cant tell a lie  
I can see what youre feeling inside  
Dont give up before we start  
Cause this time love is  
Straight from the heart  
Straight from the heart  
  
I know what theyre telling you  
I wish I could say that its not true  
Love is so hard to find  
But I never took the time  
I never let you in  
Please let me try again  
Straight from the heart  
  
I thought I knew about love  
But I didnt know at all  
Didnt take the time to see  
Until I started to fall  
Straight from the heart  
Straight from the heart
