Yah  
Yah  
Yahlah  
They say there is religion  
There is a kind of taste  
Get me the celebration  
And I will give you the waste  
There will be no danger  
No trouble at all  
We need a standup together  
Those curtains are not to fall  
Arabian nights  
Arabian nights  
Theres no way out for me  
This dream will capture me for years  
Yellow night light  
In a city of white  
Im stranded in the desert  
Im stranded in a fight  
Arabian nights  
Arabian  
Arabian nights  
Theres no way out for me  
This dream will capture me for years  
Yellow night light  
In a city of white  
Im stranded in the desert  
Im stranded in a fight  
Theres no one here whos  
Gonna safe you should probably be save  
Theres nothin sweeter than Arabia  
Theres no way out for me  
This dream will capture me too far  
In a city of white  
Im stranded in the desert  
Im stranded  
Enchala  
Arabian nights  
ARABIA  
Theres nothin sweeter than Arabia
