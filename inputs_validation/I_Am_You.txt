You have bound my heart with subtle chains  
So much pleasure that it feels like pain  
So entwined now that we cant shake free  
I am you and you are me  
  
No escaping from the mess were in  
So much pleasure that it must be sin  
I must live with this reality  
I am yours eternally  
  
Theres no turning back  
Were in this trap  
No denying the facts  
No no no  
No excuses to give  
Im the one youre with  
Weve no alternative  
No no no  
  
Dark obsession in the name of love  
This addiction that were both part of  
Leads us deeper into mystery  
Keeps us craving endlessly  
  
Strange compulsions that I cant control  
Pure possession of my heart and soul  
I must live with this reality  
  
I am you and you are me  
I am you and you are me  
I am you and you are me  
I am you and you are me  
  
Theres no turning back  
Were in this trap  
No denying the facts  
No no no  
No excuses to give  
Im the one youre with  
Weve no alternative  
No no no
