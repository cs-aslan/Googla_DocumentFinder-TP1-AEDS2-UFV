Youre the only one whos ever heard my song  
I might be lonely now but I wont be lonely long  
Take a look at me baby  
Tell me what do you see  
Take a look at me baby  
Youre lookin at the brand new me  
  
Im like a total stranger knockin at your door  
No need to worry bout the way I was before  
Its a new love story  
So read every line  
You be the judge and the jury  
Im guilty of the crime  
  
Im guilty of guilty of the crime  
Of lovin you baby  
Guilty of guilty of the crime  
  
Im savin all my lovin just for you  
Cause theres nothin more that I would rather do  
Its a new love story  
Got to read every line  
You be the judge and the jury  
Im guilty of the crime  
  
Im guilty of guilty of the crime  
Of lovin you baby  
Guilty of guilty of the crime  
Of lovin you baby  
Guilty of guilty of the crime  
Yes Im guilty of guilty of the crime  
Of lovin you lovin you  
  
Im guilty of guilty of the crime  
Yes Im guilty of guilty of the crime
