Its funny when you find yourself  
Looking from the outside  
Im standing here but all I want  
Is to be over there  
Why did I let myself believe  
Miracles could happen  
Cause now I have to pretend  
That I dont really care  
  
I thought you were my fairytale  
A dream when Im not sleeping  
A wish upon a star  
Thats coming true  
But everybody else could tell  
That I confused my feelings with the truth  
When there was me and you  
  
I swore I knew the melody  
That I heard you singing  
And when you smiled  
You made me feel  
Like I could sing along  
But then you went and changed the words  
Now my heart is empty  
Im only left with usedtobes  
Once upon a song  
  
Now I know your not a fairytale  
And dreams were meant for sleeping  
And wishes on a star  
Just dont come true  
Cause now even I could tell  
That I confused my feelings with the truth  
Cause I liked the view and  
When there was me and you  
  
I cant believe that  
I could be so blind  
Its like you were floating  
While I was falling  
And I didnt mind  
  
Cause I liked the view  
Thought you felt it too  
When there was me and you
