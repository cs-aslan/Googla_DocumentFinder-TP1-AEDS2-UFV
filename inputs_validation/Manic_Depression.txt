Manic depression is searching my soul  
I know what I want  
But I just dont know honey  
How to go about getting it  
  
Feeling sweet feeling  
Drops from my fingers fingers  
Manic depression is captured my soul  
  
Woman so willing the sweet cause in vain  
You make love  
You break love  
Its a all the same when its  
When its over  
  
Music sweet music  
I wish I could caress caress caress  
Manic depression is a frustrating mess  
Oh  
  
Well I think Ill go turn myself off and a go on down  
All the way down  
Really aint no use in me hanging around  
Oh I gotta see you  
  
Music sweet music  
I wish I could caress and a kiss kiss  
Manic depression is a frustrating mess  
  
Owh  
Owh  
  
Music sweet music sweet music  
Sweet music  
Sweet music
