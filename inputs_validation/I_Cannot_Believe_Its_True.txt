When I opened your letter yesterday  
I could not believe my eyes  
Cause Ive already given all I have to give  
And I think it must have slipped your mind  
But I remember not so long ago  
I gave it all its gone  
And I gave it all to you  
Now Im living on borrowed time but its mine  
  
Oh dyou hear me  
I cannot believe its true  
Are you really doing the things you do  
No I cannot believe its you really you  
  
Oh these people Im talking to dont understand  
They dont seem to realize  
Theyre listening but theyre not hearing me  
Theyre being too cruel to be kind  
Any kind of feeling that I had is gone  
Cause I gave it all its gone  
And I gave it all to you  
Now Im living on borrowed time but its mine  
  
Oh dyou hear me  
I cannot believe its true  
Are you really doing the things you do  
No I cannot believe its you really you  
  
Over and over I keep on telling myself  
Over and over I hope Im gonna make up  
Over and over I know its really happening  
And theres nothing that I can say  
Cause nothing can change all the things that youve done to me  
Nothing can make me stay  
  
Oh cause you know I cannot believe its true  
Are you really doing the things you do  
No I cannot believe its you really you  
  
I know its a crying shame its all the same to you  
It seems all so well laid out but I cannot get through Never meant it to show  
It started happening thats all you know  
  
Oh I gave it all to you  
Now Im living on borrowed time but its mine  
  
Oh dyou hear me  
I cannot believe its true  
Are you really doing the things you do  
No I cannot believe its you really you  
  
Over and over I keep on telling myself  
Over and over I Hope Im gonna make up  
But over and over I know its really happening  
And theres nothing that I can say  
Cause nothing can change all the things that you do to me  
Nothing can make me stay  
  
Cause you know I cannot believe its true  
Are you really doing the things you do  
No I cannot believe its you really you
