Im gonna lock my heart  
And throw away the key  
Im wise to all those tricks  
You played on me  
  
Im gonna turn my back on love  
Gonna snob the moon above  
Seal all my windows up with tin  
So the love bug cant get in  
  
Park my romance right along the curb  
Hang a sign upon my heart  
Please Dont Disturb  
  
And if I never fall in love again  
Thats soon enough for me  
Im gonna lock my heart  
And throw the key  
  
And it I never tall in love again  
Thats soon enough for me  
Im gonna lock my heart  
And throw away the key  
  
Ill never fall in love again  
Im gonna lock my heart  
And throw away the key
