Nicki Minaj  
Excuse me little mama  
But you get say Im on duty  
Im lookin for a cutie  
With a big ol ghetto booty  
I really like your kitty cat  
And if you let me touch her

Ill take you to go see usher

Like santa I keep a vixon got that dasher dancer prancer  
Dixon comet cupid doner blixen  
Im hotter than 100 degrees  
A lot of bread no sesame seeds

Im plotting on how I can take Cassie away from Diddy  
The girls want a Minaj yeah they wetter than the rain then  
Usher buzz me in
