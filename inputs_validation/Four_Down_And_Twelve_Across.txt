I dont know what to think of it  
Sometimes I hate it  
Sometimes I love it  
Girl this relationship were in  
To say the least its puzzlin  
  
Like a crossword puzzle  
Fill in the blanks  
  
Chorus  
Whats four down and twelve across  
Two letter synonym for lost Thats me  
And a three letter word  
That rhymes with through  
Oh I get it thats you  
  
Never believed in horoscopes  
But to the left of the ad  
For a new dishwashin soap  
Dear Abbys got some good advice  
For a troubled couple lost in paradise  
  
In the Living section  
Page two  
  
Whats four down and twelve across  
Two letter synonym for lost  
Thats me  
And a three letter word  
That rhymes with through  
Oh I get it  
  
Thats you thats me thats us  
Sometimes love aint enough  
We try and try  
For the life of me why did we give up  
  
Chorus  
  
Thats me  
Oh thats us  
Whats four down and twelve across Thats us
