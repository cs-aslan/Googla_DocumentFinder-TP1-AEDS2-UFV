Good girls go to heaven  
Bad girls go to hell  
The rest of them get rich  
And do just what they feel  
  
Well rich boys live in houses  
And poor boys live in sin  
The rest of them get married  
And are never seen again  
  
Well let me tell a story explain the shape Im in  
The girl I had last night had never tasted sin  
So I took her to my hotel where I tried to get my way  
She said Wait a minute Bret theres something I must say  
  
She said If you wanna talk thats fine with me  
But if you want more youd better let me be  
  
Cause you can look but you cant touch  
Cause the best things in life aint cheap  
You can look but you cant touch  
Cause baby I aint for keeps  
  
Well maybe Im a bad boy  
Ok so Ive been around the block  
But I am good at one thing  
And believe me it aint talk  
  
She says You must be kidding  
Ive heard this all before  
Other girls might buy it  
But I dont thats for sure  
  
Now wait a minute baby  
I dont want you to go  
She said Dont get no closer  
The answer still is no  
  
So I wined her dined her fancy talked  
Acted cool and smooth  
Got my hands around her shoulder  
Two inches from the move  
  
Well I guess Im about as close as I could be  
So I finally made my move she just said to me  
  
Cause you can look but you cant touch  
Cause the best things in life aint cheap  
You can look but you cant touch  
Cause baby I aint for keeps  
  
Let me show you something  
Mmm let me set the pace  
Slid my hand up her leg  
As she slapped me across my face  
  
Cant blame a man for tryin  
Wantin action aint a crime  
I didnt plan on spending money  
Just to get a piece of mind  
  
Solo  
  
So I started really thinkin  
And I got myself a plan  
I opened up a cold beer  
And I handed her the can  
  
She drank it down real fast until she nearly choked  
Jumped up on my bed tore off all her clothes and said  
  
Cause you can look but you cant touch  
Cause the best things in life aint cheap  
You can look but you cant touch  
Cause baby I aint for keeps  
  
You can look look but dont touch no  
You can look look but dont touch no  
You can look look but dont touch no  
You can look look but dont touch no
