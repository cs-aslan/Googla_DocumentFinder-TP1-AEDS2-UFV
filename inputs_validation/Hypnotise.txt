I cant help it when youre near me  
I dont think straight I get all confused  
I just lose all my concentration  
With no question at all Id surrender to you  
Standing here so close together  
I can feel all the magic again  
But Im holding back the emotion  
Couldnt take anymore of the heartache and pain  
I know I should take it slow but  
The minute I see you I just let go  
Chorus   
cause you baby you hypnotise  
I just have to look in your eyes  
Im in a daze I lose control  
Deeper inside my mind  
Im leaving the real world behind  
I give to you my heart and my soul  
Its a gamble can we take it  
Playing safe is no way to survive  
Theres a chance for us we can make it  
Give our love room to breathe to keep it alive  
Admit that we made mistakes but  
I know in my heart that its not too late  
Chorus   
cause you baby you hypnotise  
I just have to look in your eyes  
Im in a daze I lose control  
Deeper inside my mind  
Im leaving the real world behind  
I give to you my heart and my soul  
It feels like Im falling in love with you all over again  
And Im trying not to let it show  
But the minute I see you I just let go  
I just have to look in your eyes  
Im in a daze I lose control
