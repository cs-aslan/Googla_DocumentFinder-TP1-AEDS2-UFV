Actions have been justified  
All is compromised  
Looking for approval there  
In someone elses eyes oh  
Dodging all you really are  
Becomes your greatest task  
Acting out your lonely part  
You hide behind your mask  
  
Bridge  
Never true to yourself  
Knowing well this is not like you  
Fooling yourself  
Youre just living a lie  
  
Chorus  
Goin goin  
Goin through the motions  
Goin goin  
Goin through the motions  
Goin goin  
Goin through the motions  
Goin goin  
Goin through the motions  
  
Victim of the circumstance  
Prisoner of the shame  
But its the double standard life  
That keeps you in the game  
Taken by your own disguise  
But when its wearing thin  
Youll do anything it takes  
To impress your friends  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus
