A scrap of flesh  
And a heap of bones  
One deep high  
And a desperate moan  
  
Three black eyes  
And a busted nose  
I said oh yeah oh yeah  
  
Take me up  
Baby Im ready to go  
Shake me up  
Baby Im ready to go yeah  
Take me up  
Baby Im ready  
Baby baby Im ready to go  
Chill me freeze me Its in my blood  
  
Im not going to burn in hell  
I cased the joint  
And I know it well  
Maybe my carcass  
Would feed the worms  
But Im working  
For the other firm  
  
Take me up  
Baby Im ready to go  
Fix me up  
Baby Im ready to roll yeah  
Set me up  
Baby baby baby Im ready to go  
Chill me freeze me Its in my blood  
Flip the switch  
  
I got my money my ticket  
All that shit  
I even got myself  
A little shaving kit  
What would it take  
To bury me  
I cant wait  
I cant wait to see  
  
I got toothbrush mouthwash  
All that shit  
Im looking down  
In the filthy pit  
I had the turkey  
And the stuffing too  
I even saved  
A little bit for you  
  
Lethal injection is a luxury  
I want to give it  
To the whole jury  
Im just dying  
For one more squeeze  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Pick me up  
Baby Im ready to go  
Take me up  
Baby Im ready to blow  
Take me up  
Baby if youre ready to go  
Baby I got nowhere to go  
Baby Im ready to go  
Chill me freeze me to my bones  
Flip the switch
