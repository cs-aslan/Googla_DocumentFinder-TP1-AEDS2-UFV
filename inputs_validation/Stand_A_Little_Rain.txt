Dark cloud is coming  
Headed straight for your heart  
Might get just a little bit crazy baby  
Might try to tear us apart  
  
When the storm blows over  
Only the true love remains  
If were ever gonna see a rainbow  
We have to stand a little rain  
  
Everybody wants love to be easy  
But its never been that way  
Each love starts out with blue skies  
Sometimes those blue skies turn grey  
  
When the storm blows over  
Only the strong love remains  
If were ever gonna see a rainbow  
We have to stand a little rain  
  
The thunder rolls  
And the lightning strikes  
Hold on darling  
Its gonna be alright  
  
Cause when the storm blows over  
Only the true love remains  
If were ever gonna see a rainbow  
We have to stand a little rain  
  
If were ever gonna see a rainbow  
We have to stand a little rain
