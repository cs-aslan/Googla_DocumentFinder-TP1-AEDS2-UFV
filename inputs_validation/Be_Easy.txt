Be easy  
Be easy  
Or itll be a long day  
  
Hold on let me light my blunt man  
This shit too easy  
Ill do it in my sleep  
  
Yeah  
Its a new game  
Lame nigga forfeit  
Im well ahead throwin bread  
You just horse shit  
Flow out of this world  
Im in orbit  
More chips  
So them hoes chase me like Norbit  
Im more sick  
No anidonte  
High like mandigo  
Flow crack and its dope  
Only talk money homey  
I dont understand the broke  
Take something from me  
Niggas come and bust yo canalope  
Im out here grindin  
Like a pair of old brakes  
Hoe aint nothing changed  
Na I rep the Burg all day  
Walk it how I talk it so I talk it how I live it  
And if you hear me flowin  
You should know its not a gimmick  
If the topic real shit  
You should know they count me in it  
Your girlfriend want me in her mouth  
Like Im her dentist  
The icing on the cake  
Im like the glaze all finished  
Marijuana scented  
Windows up truck tinted  
You better  
  
Skinny nigga  
And Im tat tat tatted up  
Run up on me  
And get rat tat tatted up  
Thats a promise not a threat  
Ill back it up  
Pockets gettin like the old Star Jones  
Fat as fuck  
Got my swagga up  
Come at me the wrong way  
Like what the song say  
Itll be a long day  
To pass me you Cassie  
Got a long way  
And even seein first  
Im comin round that home plate  
Come out to the Burg  
Youll see that I got it poppin  
If you real you fuck with me  
Yall aint got an option  
See my chain  
They like how did he get all them rocks in   
Want me on your song  
Im a need a lot of guap then  
Breeze home  
And he said he going choppa shoppin  
So if you got a problem  
So look to now to stop him  
That Pistolvania shit  
Im on it  
And I dont run the Burgh I own it  
You better  
  
Go head and get ready to kill yourself man  
Im out her slangin  
Rollin with these hustlas  
Tryna get rid of all you hatas and you bustas  
Blowin my smoke I get right to it  
When they play this  
Everybody in this bitch get stupid  
I mean they just lose it  
Wildin like they pissed off  
Find you wrong place or wrong time  
You can get lost  
Lotta niggas mad  
But the hoes love it  
Yea the youngin super bad  
You can call me McLovin  
Im gettin in good  
Makin my spread  
And na Im never stingy with a plate  
I break bread  
My niggas break heads  
And we 25 deep  
I see you tryin hard nigga  
But you not me  
Im fuckin young star  
Theres no question I be  
Hit hard and then I dance on them like Im Ali  
Im a certified G  
So dont think that Im just rappin to you homey  
You dont really want something happen to you  
You better
