Days times we will remember  
When innocence was lost  
We let our hearts move on  
So many dreams we thought would last forever  
  
Today it doesnt matter  
All those dreams are gone they are gone oooh  
Tell me how it feels again  
Oh show me that its real and then  
  
Ill walk away from my own reflection  
The stranger that I knew  
The stranger that was you  
And now I face a cold return to sender  
A truce but no surrender  
A voice that wont ring true where are you oooh  
  
I reach over the edge  
And throw a penny in the wishing well  
Its so deep that I can tell  
  
That in the real world  
Theres fewer stars in the sky  
And in the real world  
You can get hear children cry at night  
This is the real world  
  
There is no time for a life of solitude  
Only hunger and survival  
In the world we were born into were alone oooh  
  
And it brings me to my knees  
Our father lay me down to sleep  
Father please  
Pray the lord my soul to keep  
  
Keep us in the real world  
Keep us in the real world  
Dont have to tell you  
In the real world  
  
Theyll damn you if you try  
In the real world  
Let it begin with you and I  
  
This is the real world  
Theres fewer stars in the sky  
This is the real world  
You can get hear children cry at night  
  
Now in the real world  
Theyll damn you if you try  
And in the real world  
Let it begin with you and I  
Living in the real world  
Yeah living in the real world
