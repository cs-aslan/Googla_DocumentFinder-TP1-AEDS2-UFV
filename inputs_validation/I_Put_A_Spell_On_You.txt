Screamin Jay Hawkins  
Inspired by Nina Simones 1965 cover of Screamin Jay Hawkins 1956 cult hit  
I put a spell on you  
cause youre mine  
You better stop the things you do  
I aint lyin  
No I aint lyin  
You know I cant stand it  
Youre runnin around  
You know better daddy  
I cant stand it cause you put me down  
I put a spell on you  
Because youre mine  
Youre mine  
I love ya  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you anyhow  
And I dont care  
If you dont want me  
Im yours right now  
You hear me  
I put a spell on you  
Because youre mine
