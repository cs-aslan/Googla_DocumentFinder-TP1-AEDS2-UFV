Everybody knows that  
Ive had my share of fair weather lovers  
They always leave just ahead of the rain  
Searching for sunshine and looking for pleasure  
  
Two steps ahead of the last hurricane  
If this is a chance then Im gonna take it  
Heaven knows Ive taking chances before  
Its hard to live with your eyes on the sparrow  
  
Unless you first take your feet off the shore  
Theres not a cloud up in the sky  
Give me one good reason why  
We should set our sails for somewhere  
  
Other that the sunny side of nowhere  
Freedoms in the eagles wings baby  
Listen to those seagulls sing maybe  
Love is just a porpoise  
  
Playing in the tropical sun  
Let me tell you girl  
That ocean get big when your  
Halfway across it  
  
And this ship of loves seen a lot of bad days  
Sometimes its harder to row with the current  
Most of my life Ive just rocked on the waves  
If this is a game then Im gonna play it  
  
I need your love like those sails need wind  
Just climb aboard girl and pull up the anchor  
Now is the time for our love to begin  
Woo theres not a cloud up in the sky  
  
Not a cloud up in the sky  
Not a cloud up in the sky  
Give me one good reason why  
Its a fairy tale morning
