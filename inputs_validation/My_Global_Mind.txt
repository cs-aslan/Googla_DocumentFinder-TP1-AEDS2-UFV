Theres hunger in Africa  
And anger on assembly lines  
At the touch of a button  
Im miles away  
I want no connection just information  
And Im gone  
  
I feel so helpless  
So I turn my gaze to another place  
  
My global mind reaches out for the truth  
Why try holding back the wave  
Youll only drown in the changes  
Youve got to learn to let go  
Just let go and experience the flight  
Try to see from a different side  
If balance is the key  
Maybe well see  
A future understanding  
  
Then we wont feel so helpless  
An turn away and hide from the change  
  
My global mind searches for something new  
My global mind zeros in on news  
  
Time and rules are changing  
Attention span is quickening  
Welcome to the Information Age  
  
I feel so helpless  
So I turn my gaze to another place  
  
My global mind searches for something new  
My global mind zeros in on news  
My global mind reaches out for the truth  
My global mind zeros in on you  
  
Its searching everywhere  
Across the mountains  
Across the oceans  
Across every man made line  
No boundary gonna keep it from you
