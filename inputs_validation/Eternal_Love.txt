When your life gets too lonely  
It might help to feel me in your heart  
I remember you happy but thought it  
Unfair that we are apart  
And its gonna be all right  
cause everlasting love  
Will get us through the night  
Theres a new day thats dawning  
It brings with it skies so blue and clear  
I cant offer you blue skies  
Ive only got love eternal love  
Soon its gonna be all right  
And the day will come  
When we live as one  
Drifting through time on an ocean of eternal love  
Sailing through space on an ocean of eternal love  
Doesnt love have a meaning  
To put that in words would be so hard  
Just remember the feeling of love in a song  
Thats a love for real  
And its gonna be all right  
cause everlasting love  
Will get us through the night
