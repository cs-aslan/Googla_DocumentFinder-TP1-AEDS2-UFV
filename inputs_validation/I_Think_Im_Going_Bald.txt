I looked in the mirror today  
My eyes just didnt seem so bright  
Ive lost a few more hairs  
I think Im going bald  
I think Im going bald  
  
Seems like only yesterday  
We would sit and talk of dreams all night  
Dreams of youth  
And simple truths  
Now were so involved  
So involved with life  
  
Walk down vanity fair  
Memory lane everywhere  
Wall Street shuffles there  
Dressed in flowing hair  
  
The wire  
  
Once we loved the flowers  
Now we ask the price of the land  
Once we would take water  
But now it must be wine  
Now weve been  
And now weve seen What price peace of mind  
Take a piece of my mind  
  
My life is slipping away  
Im aging every day  
But even when Im grey  
Ill still be grey my way
