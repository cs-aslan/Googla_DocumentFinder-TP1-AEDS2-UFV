You know there isnt anything  
Anything I wouldnt do  
You know there isnt anyone  
Anyone who loves me like you  
Holdin you close and feelin your heart beat inside  
Its just like a miracle  
And youre makin me feel so glad Im alive  
And in every way Im gonna thank you  
You know there isnt anything  
Anything I couldnt be  
You know there isnt anyone  
Anyone to keep you from me  
If youre caught in a storm or lost out at sea  
Searchin for that miracle  
I would soften the wind  
And calm the angry sea  
To bring you home to me  
So if they built up an army  
To take you from me  
Just like a miracle  
I would fly like an eagle  
And carry you so far away in my fantasy  
You know there isnt anything  
Anything I wouldnt do  
Oh no no oh  
You know there isnt anything  
Anything I wouldnt do  
Oh no no oh
