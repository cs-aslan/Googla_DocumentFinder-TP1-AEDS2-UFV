Hung on a hook Im a mirror  
Cracked down the center I split you  
Counting the clouds in a storm behind your eyes  
  
Show you the face of a man who  
Not that he wants but he has to  
Look at the thing hes become what I see  
  
Im caught in a still life with no frame  
Sometimes people do the world it dont change  
Im caught in a still life with no frame  
Sometimes people do the world it dont change  
  
Give up awaiting someday  
Future between a gun  
  
Pieces of me on a tile floor  
Look up at you as you change more  
Floating in fear I appear a hundred times  
  
Hold a reflection inside me  
I cannot feel you are empty  
Throw me away  
I am broken not your time  
  
Im caught in a still life with no frame  
Sometimes people do the world it dont change  
Im caught in a still life with no frame  
Sometimes people do the world it dont change  
  
Give up awaiting someday  
Future between a gun  
Give up awaiting someday  
Future between a gun and your head  
  
Not gonna save you  
Perform euthanasia  
Not gonna save you  
Perform euthanasia  
Not gonna save you  
Perform euthanasia  
Not gonna save you  
Perform euthanasia
