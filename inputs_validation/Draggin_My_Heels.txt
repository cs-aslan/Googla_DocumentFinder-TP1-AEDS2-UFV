First at the gate post but the last one through  
I hung around far too long for you  
Left out the game left out the deal  
Stupid of me to be draggin my heels  
Oh oh oh draggin my heels  
Oh oh oh draggin my heels heels  
Time waits for no one and I wasted my time  
Got to the crossroads but took the wrong sign  
Id go too far didnt know how shed feel  
Stupid of me to be draggin my heels  
Oh oh oh draggin my heels  
Oh oh oh draggin my heels heels  
If I had the chance to go back again  
I wouldnt do the same  
I learned by mistakes  
Id be on my knees Id be there to please  
Id be anything you want me to be  
You want to be
