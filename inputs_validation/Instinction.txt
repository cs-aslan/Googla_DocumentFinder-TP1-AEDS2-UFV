Cheap bed in the red  
Sleep the words out of your head  
Cold floor nice and raw  
Eat the meat thats on the floor  
High tide some disguise  
Loving makes the cream taste nice  
New shore final score  
On fresh demand Im wanting more  
This might not last too long  
So always take it  
This might not last too long  
So take it  
Reasons reasons were here from the start  
Its my instinction its my instinction  
Reasons reasons were part of the art  
Its my instinction its my instinction  
You cry justify  
But deep beneath the feelings lie  
Photo looking old  
Memory makes the day feel cold  
theyve gone sing your song  
Walk the flow ah too slow  
Post boom second doom  
Stealing cake to eat the moon  
This might not last too long  
So always take it  
This might not last too long  
So take it  
Reasons reasons were here from the start  
Its my instinction its my instinction  
Reasons reasons were part of the art  
Its my instinction its my instinction  
Its my instinction hey  
Cheap bed in the red  
You cry justify  
Post boom second doom  
Stealing cake to eat the moon  
Reasons reasons were here from the start  
Its my instinction its my instinction  
Reasons reasons were part of the art  
Its my instinction its my instinction  
Its my instinction ohh  
Stealing cake to eat the moon
