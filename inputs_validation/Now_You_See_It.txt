Overbearing woman makin it so hard for me  
Now youve laid it down for all to see  
Can I ask a question dya think you can take a blow  
This is why I always come and go  
  
Now you see it now you dont  
Careful of words that get caught in your throat  
Face the music take it like a man  
Givin it to me anyway you can  
  
Everybodys feeling everything youve got to feel  
Ive got something that you can conceal  
  
Now you see it  
Now you dont  
Now you see it  
Now you dont  
  
Give me central heating hope that I can pay the bill  
  
Makin me forget my fear of hell  
Must be luck in odd numbers now you face me  
Upside down  
Im so far up Im afraid to come back down
