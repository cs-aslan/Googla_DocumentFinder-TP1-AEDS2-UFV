My hearts breakin cause I cant reward you  
What can I do cause you stepped inside my soul  
Feel like youre dyin for beautys sake  
Say that youre lyin for beautys sake  
Who cares what youre feeling   
Youve lost and youre dealing for beautys sake  
In your circle you hold supreme sway  
Can you imagine not getting your own way  
What can I do cause you stepped inside my soul

What can I do cause you stepped inside my soul  
You stand astride the city takin it all in  
Lyin before the fire admiring your own skin  
Beautiful and dumb avarice and handsome  
What can I do  What can I do   
What can I do cause you stepped inside my soul   
What are you takin for beautys sake
