Last time she jumped out the window  
Well she only turned and smiled  
You might think she would say something  
But youd have to wait a while  
  
Well the lady dont mind  
No no no the lady dont mind  
She just turns her head and disappears  
I kinda like that style  
  
Little boat that floats on a river  
its drifting through a haze  
She stops by whenever she wants to  
well there she goes again  
  
Well its no trouble at all  
No no no trouble at all  
Well what she does  
Is all right with me and  
I kinda like that style  
  
Come on come on I go up and down  
I like this curious feeling I know I see  
Its like make believe  
Cover your ears so you can hear what Im saying  
Im not lost but I dont know  
Where I am I got a question  
All right All right  
This is what we like  
Who knows who knows  
What Im thinking  
  
She says love is not what shes after  
And everyone knows  
Each time she looks in the mirror  
She lets her feelings show  
  
Well the lady dont mind  
No no no the lady dont mind  
Well what she says is all right by me  
And I kinda like that style  
  
Uhoh Uhoh Here we go again  
I dont know I dont know  
What Im sayin  
Hey man Hey man  
I sure dont feel the same  
She likes to say what shes feeling  
Hey Did I get a big surprise  
I know you think so  
Come on Come on She says anything  
Who knows who knows  
What shes thinking
