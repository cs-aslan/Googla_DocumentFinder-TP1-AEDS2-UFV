On her television on her mommas radio  
She could paint a picture  
More alive than all she ought to know  
Her imagination running wild she let it grow  
In her imagination  
Oh she found she loved him so  
  
Chorus  
The eyes of the girl are following me  
Looking for the man that she pinned on me  
The tears for a love that could never be  
Now its all over  
Theyre raining on me  
Oh its raining  
  
Its an empty world with a lifetime on your hands  
Oh we must believe that  
Something someone somewhere understands  
Our imagination wants to capture what we feel  
In our imagination  
Everything is real  
  
Chorus  
  
Tears fall from the eyes of the girl  
And the girl is watching me  
Tears fall from the eyes of the girl  
And the girl is watching me  
  
Baby please release me  
From the power of your mind  
Baby please release me  
Leave this crazy scheme behind  
Baby please release me  
Baby please release me  
  
The eyes of the girl are following me  
Now its all over  
Theyre raining on me  
Oh its raining  
  
Tears fall from the eyes of the girl  
And the girl is watching me  
Tears fall from the eyes of the girl  
And the girl is watching me  
  
The eyes of the girl are following me  
Eyes of the girl  
Looking for the man that she pinned on me  
Eyes of the girl  
The eyes of the girl  
Eyes of the girl  
Looking for the man  
Eyes of the girl
