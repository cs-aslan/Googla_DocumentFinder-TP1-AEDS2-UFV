Make my bed out of Wonder Bread  
Spread some mustard upon my head  
I dont want no onions or sauerkraut mamma  
Hold on to the bun baby work it on out  
Im a chilidog  
I guess you guessed by now babe  
Sure enough Im a chilidog  
Look at me delicious  
  
Dont get jealous better not up  
And get over zealous watch out now yall  
Come on now fella pass me down the relish  
  
Dont read no Ann Landers  
Just dont feed me no Colonel Sanders  
I aint trying to fool yous  
Dont bring home no Orange Julius  
Gotta have one more time  
Get on down again woh woh chilidog baby  
Yes indeed I want a chilidog yeah  
Talking about stone delicious good for you too
