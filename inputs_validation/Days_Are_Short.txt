Days are short and I aint down  
The sun is on the hill  
Looking in my suitcase for a friend  
The door was opened wide  
You know I lost a little pride  
And inside it was just another man  
  
CHORUS  
Every day another man reaches out his hand  
Every moment theres a shifting in the sand  
Every whisper in the wind  
Brings a good man back again  
Settle me down in my dreams tonight  
Tomorrows another day to blow my blues away  
  
Lots of folks will tell you that  
A man can go through life  
Taking what he wants along the way  
But until all men are freed  
Each one gets but what he needs  
The experience of living every day  
  
CHORUS  
  
I woke up this morning  
I awoke upon my knees  
Crying oowee I dont know where I am  
I feel just like a clown  
Every time I move around  
Because after all Im just another man
