Dressed to the nines you know you dont look fifteen theres no question  
Not and ready ready to use

Im coming through Ive gotta get to you babe

Hot and ready ready to use  
Slip in the back door and slip out of what ever your into  
Hot and ready ready to use  
Im coming through Ive gotta get to you babe 2x  
  
Im coming through Ive gotta get to you babe 2x
