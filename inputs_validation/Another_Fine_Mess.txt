Well you rang me up you say you wanna get high  
Now Im underpaid and Im overtired  
Riding shotgun round the world  
Im too young to die too old for the girls  
You wanna know something Ive had it with you  
Another fine mess you got me into  
Well youre always in one hole or another  
And I come runnin just like a brother  
When are you ever going to get yourself cleared  
Youll keep on running til we disappear  
I cant believe the things you do  
Another mess you got me into  
Another fine mess another fine mess another fine mess  
Well thats what you get when you settle for less  
Another fine mess yeah another fine mess  
Look on the bright side smile smile smile  
Relive our childhood just for a little while  
Cant you see its catching it up on you Hit me Darrell  
Well thats another mess you got me into  
How many more times are you gonna get pissed  
How many more asses have we gotta kiss  
How many more songs have I gotta write  
How many more sessions into the night  
For some dumb fuck who dont got a clue  
Another fine mess you got me into  
Well you say Im kicking up too much fuss  
Twentyfour hours is too long on the bus  
The bands all moan and the drivers slow  
Theres not enough people too many shows  
Down in the bus with the birthday blues  
Another fine mess you got me into  
Another fine mess another fine mess another fine mess  
Well thats what you get when you settle for less  
Another fine mess another fine mess  
Oh I said another fine mess another fine mess ohh  
I said another fine mess another fine mess  
Another fine mess another fine mess  
Another fine another fine another fine another fine  
Another fine another fine another fine mess
