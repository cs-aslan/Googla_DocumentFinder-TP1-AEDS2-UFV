This aint the way  
I spend my mornings baby  
Come stai  
Youve been with him  
And youve come back lady  
Hei whats he like  
I just sit and watch the ocean  
With myself even I do my own cookin  
You ca laugh youre forgiven but  
Im no longer frightened to be livin  
  
Senza una donna  
No more pain and no sorrow  
Without a woman  
Ill make it through tomorrow  
Senza una donna  
Givin me torture and bliss  
Without a woman  
Better like this  
  
There is no way  
That you can buy me baby  
Dont make fun  
You got a dig a little deeper lady  
In your heart  
Yeah if you have one  
Heres my heart feel the power  
Look at me Im a flower  
You can laugh youre forgiven but  
Im no longer frightened to be livin  
  
Senza una donna  
No more pain and no sorrow  
Without a woman  
Ill make it through tomorrow  
Senza una donna  
Givin me torture and bliss  
Without a woman  
Better like this  
  
Oooh I stay here and watch the ocean  
Dont know why I keep on talkin  
You may laugh youre forgiven but  
Im no longer frightened maybe ti be livin  
  
Senza una donna  
Without a woman  
Senza una donna  
Without a woman  
Vieni qui Come on in  
Senza una donna  
I dont know what might follow  
Senza una donna  
Oh maybe from tomorrow  
Senza una donna  
Givin me torture and bliss
