Hello all you boys and girls  
Id like to take you to the inside world  
Its quite an irregular place to be  
But never fear youre safe with me  
  
Well maybe  
  
Golden hair of macrame  
Against the face thats cut from stone  
The white porcelain is screaming ayee  
  
Thank god the boy is not alone  
  
I dont believe in Santa Claus  
I dont believe in spite  
I have no use for beauty dolls  
Especially on this night  
  
I dont believe in miracles  
I dont believe in lies  
I dont believe in hologram  
For I am the Frizzle Fry  
  
Andys painting green again  
This time they might take him away  
  
When Barrington starts to breathe again  
It may just take us all away  
  
I dont believe in charity  
I dont believe in sin  
And if you dont believe in me  
Well play this tune over again  
  
I dont believe in pinochle  
And I dont believe Ill try  
I do believe in Captain Crunch  
For I am the Frizzle Fry  
  
Yes I am the Frizzle Fry
