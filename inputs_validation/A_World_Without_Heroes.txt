A world without heroes  
Is like a world without sun  
You cant look up to anyone  
Without heroes  
And a world without heroes  
Is like a never ending race  
Its like a time without a place  
A pointless thing  
Devoid of grace  
Where you dont know what your after  
Or if somethings after you  
And you dont know why you dont know  
In a world without heroes  
In a world without dreams  
Things are no more than they seem  
A world without heroes  
Is like a bird without wings  
Or a bell that never rings  
Just a sad and useless thing  
Where you dont know what youre after  
Or if somethings after you  
And you dont know why you dont know  
In a world without heroes
