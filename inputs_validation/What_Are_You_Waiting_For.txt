What are you waiting for  
What are you waiting for  
Are you waiting on a lightening strike  
Are you waiting for the perfect night  
Are you waiting till the time is right  
What are you waiting for  
Dont you wanna learn to deal with fear  
Dont you wanna take the wheel and steer  
Dont you wait another minute here  
What are you waiting for  
  
You gotta go and reach for the top  
Believe in every dream that you got  
You only living one so tell me  
What are you what are you waiting for  
You know you gotta give it your all  
And dont you be afraid if you fall  
You only living one so tell me  
What are you what are you waiting for  
  
Are you waiting for the right excuse  
Are you waiting for a sign to choose  
While your waiting its the time you lose  
What are you waiting for  
Dont you wanna spread your wings and fly  
Dont you wanna really live your life  
Dont you wanna love before you die  
What are you waiting for  
  
You gotta go and reach for the top  
Believe in every dream that you got  
You only living one so tell me  
What are you what are you waiting for  
You know you gotta give it your all  
And dont you be afraid if you fall  
You only living one so tell me  
What are you what are you waiting for  
  
Tell me what your waiting for  
Show me what your aiming for  
What you gonna save it for  
So what you really waiting for  
  
Tell me what your waiting for  
Show me what your aiming for  
What you gonna save it for  
So what you really waiting for  
Everybodys gonna make mistakes  
But everybodys got a choice to make  
Everybody needs a leap of faith  
When are you taking yours  
  
You gotta go and reach for the top  
Believe in every dream that you got  
You only living one so tell me
