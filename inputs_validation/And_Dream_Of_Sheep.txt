Little light shining  
Little light will guide them to me  
My face is all lit up  
My face is all lit up  
If they find me racing white horses  
Theyll not take me for a buoy  
  
Let me be weak let me sleep and Dream Of Sheep  
Oh Ill wake up to any sound of engines  
Every gull a seeking craft  
I cant keep my eyes open  
Wish I had my radio  
Id tune into some friendly voices  
  
Talking bout stupid things  
I cant be left to my imagination  
Let me be weak let me sleep And Dream Of Sheep  
Ooh their breath is warm  
And they smell like sleep  
And they say they take me home  
Like poppies heavy with seed  
They take me deeper and deeper
