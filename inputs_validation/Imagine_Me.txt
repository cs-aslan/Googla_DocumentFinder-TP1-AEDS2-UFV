Imagine me  
Loving what I see when the mirror looks at me cause I  
I imagine me  
In a place of no insecurities  
And Im finally happy cause  
I imagine me  
  
Letting go of all of the ones who hurt me  
Cause they never did deserve me  
Can you imagine me  
Saying no to thoughts that try to control me  
Remembering all you told me  
Lord can you imagine me  
Over what my mama said  
And healed from what my daddy did  
And I wanna live and not read that page again  
  
Chorus  
Imagine me being free trusting you totally finally I can  
Imagine me  
I admit it was hard to see  
You being in love with someone like me  
But finally I can  
Imagine me  
  
Being strong  
And not letting people break me down  
You wont get that joy this time around  
Can you imagine me  
In a world in a world where nobody has to live afraid  
Because of your love fears gone away  
Can you imagine me  
  
Bridge  
Letting go of my past  
And glad I have another chance  
And my heart will dance  
Cause I dont have to read that page again  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Gone gone its gone all gone
