You can take a horse to the water but you cant make him drink  
Oh no oh no oh no  
  
A friend of mine in so much misery  
Some people sail through life he is struggling  
I said Hey man lets go out and get some wisdom  
First he turned on me then turned off his nervous system  
  
You can take a horse to the water but you cant make him drink  
Oh no oh no oh no  
You can have it all laid out in front of you but still wont make it think  
Oh no oh no oh no  
  
Someone I love has got a problem  
Some people thirst for truth he would like a drink  
I said Hey man this could be risky  
He said everythings okay as he downed another bottle of whiskey  
  
You can take a horse to the water but you cant make him drink  
Oh no oh no oh no  
You can have it all staked out in front of you but still wont make it sink  
Oh no oh no oh no  
  
Preacher at my church likes to talk about Satan  
Could be that he knows him he acts like hes possessed  
I said Hey man lets hear about Gods realization for a change  
He said We aint got time for that first you must hear of the evils of
fornication  
  
You can take a horse to the water but you cant make him drink  
Oh no oh no oh no  
You can have it all staked out in front of you but still wont make it sink  
Oh no oh no oh no
