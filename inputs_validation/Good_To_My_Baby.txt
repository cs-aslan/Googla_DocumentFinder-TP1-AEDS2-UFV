good to my baby  
good to my baby  
good to my baby  
good to my baby  
  
They think Im bad and I treat her so mean  
But all they know is from what theyve seen  
And when I get her alone now  
You know were happy as a couple could be  
And when I give her my love its between her and me  
  
Shes my girl and Im good to my baby  
Shes my girl and Im good to my baby  
And I know shes happy with me  
good to my baby  
good to my baby  
  
Some guys may think theyd be better for her  
But she knows just what she wants for sure  
And when were out with our friends now  
You know that we never have to put on a show  
And we stay together while other couples come and go  
  
Shes my girl and Im good to my baby  
Shes my girl and Im good to my baby  
And I know shes happy with me  
good to my baby  
good to my baby  
  
good to my baby  
good to my baby  
good to my baby  
good to my baby  
  
Shes my girl and Im good to my baby  
Shes my girl and Im good to my baby  
  
Shes my girl and Im good to my baby  
Shes my girl and Im good to my baby
