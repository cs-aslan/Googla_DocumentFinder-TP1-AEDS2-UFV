Take my hand  
And walk in the light  
Understand theres a fire to ignite  
You know we have a responsibility  
Its true weve been chosen  
And now we have the possibility  
Of melting whats frozen  
  
Walk with me with the rapture inside  
Cant you see its not our place to decide  
You know we have to make a case for love  
Its more of a duty  
Its clear we have a mission from above  
A mission of beauty  
  
You know I wouldnt lie to you  
What would I achieve by that  
Its more than I would try to do  
These are the facts  
  
Take your place here  
With love in your heart  
Just embrace what youve known from the start  
We are fulfilling our only destiny  
The angels have spoken  
And all the gods in the universe agree  
The spell cant be broken
