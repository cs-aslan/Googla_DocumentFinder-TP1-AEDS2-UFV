When its back to school this fall weathers chill may end it all  
But for now theres lots of fun with the girl at 301

Maybe they will never wed sure they may break up instead  
But for now she is the one the girl who lives at 301

The boy who lives across the street has a reason to be neat  
Hes in love and on the run with the girl at 301
