Baby wont you come out tonight  
Just come up the hill cause theres a full moon on the risin  
Hey baby cant you steal away  
You know I really need to see you tonight  
I just got word you was packin it in  
Whats the matter this old town got you crazy again  
I can see the sad look in your eyes  
But I dont know how to say goodbye  
And tomorrow youre gonna have your day  
Take your wife and youre gonna run away  
Baby while Im wailin  
Youll be sailin like a hog across the bay singin  
Ooo la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
Baby wont you come out tonight  
Oh baby wont you come out tonight  
Well run up the hill and well dance in the moonlight  
Let me gaze into your eyes til we both go blind  
Oh baby can I see you tonight  
Im just tryin to find a way to make it last  
Good friends they seem to slip away so fast  
An I know were both headed down separate tracks  
An when ya go baby dont look back  
There wont be no more sleepin over on a Tuesday night  
No more runnin to the races for a dark horse at midnight  
No more dancin after hours singin in the showers  
Or clingin to each other in the soft mornin light singin  
Ooo la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
Oh baby wont ya come out tonight  
Oh baby wont ya come out tonight  
Ill meet ya on the corner  
And youll be there at midnight  
Oh baby can you steal away  
You know I really want to see ya tonight  
Ooo baby can you come out tonight  
Well run up the hill and dance again in the moonlight  
Oh baby can you steal away  
I really wanna see you tonight  
Oh baby wont ya come out tonight  
Come up the hill theres a full moon on the rise  
Oh baby can ya steal away  
Baby wont ya come out tonight
