We make all of our suns the same  
Every one will suffer the fire weve made  
They all explode just the same  
And theres no going back on the plans weve made  
  
Peacekeeper take your time  
Wait for the dark of night  
Soon all the suns will rise  
Peacekeeper dont tell why  
Dont be afraid to fight  
Love is the sweet surprise  
  
Only creatures who are on their way  
Ever poison their own well  
But we still have time to hate  
And theres still something we can sell  
  
Chorus  
  
When the night is cold and still  
When you thought youd had your fill  
Take all the time you will  
This is not a test its not a drill  
Take no prisoners only kill  
  
You know all of our friends are gods  
And they all tell us how to paint our face  
But theres only one brush we need  
Its the one that never leaves a trace  
  
Chorus  
When the night is cold and still  
When you thought youd had your fill  
This is not a test its not a drill  
Take no prisoners only kill
