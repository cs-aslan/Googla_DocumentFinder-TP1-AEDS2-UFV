Ooh that sounds good why dont you turn that up  
Baby  
  
Listen Pay attention are you listening  
Hey youre my favorite girl  
Excuse me for a moment Im in another world  
On a mountain by a fountain flowers blooming everywhere  
With Venus and with Cupid the pictures very clear  
  
Chorus  
Hang the sign up on the door  
I say dont disturb this grove  
All I need is just me and you  
Just a way to say that Im so into you  
Just someone who understood  
And the feelings so real  
Dont disturb this grove  
  
Erotic whispers for the listener  
Let the music fill the air  
Excuse me for a moment Im at a loss for words  
By election youre perfection  
And as if these eyes would care  
Your heart is in the right place so dont you go and change  
  
Baby over and over the passion starts again  
And the lollipops and everything with a little taste of sin  
Causing fire and desire in this mortal soul to live  
Till the angels fall from heaven and the day the earth stands still  
  
Chorus  
Hang the sign up on the door  
It says dont disturb this grove  
All I need is just me and you  
Just a way to say that Im so into you  
Just someone who understood  
And the feelings so real  
Dont disturb this grove  
All I need is just me and you  
Cause I want to say that Im so into you  
Just someone who understood  
And the feelings so real  
Dont disturb this grove  
  
Bridge  
Close your eyes and let the music put you in the mood  
Oooh baby just lock the door and turn the phone off  
Its time for me and you  
  
Chorus  
Hang the sign up on the door  
It says dont disturb this grove  
All I need is just me and you  
Just a way to say that Im so into you  
Just someone who understood  
And the feelings so real  
Dont disturb this grove  
All I need is just me and you  
Cause I want to say that Im so into you  
Just someone who understood  
And the feelings so real  
Dont disturb this grove  
  
Its the feeling girl repeat
