Slow dancing in a disco  
Standing underneath the light show  
Illuminated by the artificial light  
  
I disbelieved it at first sight  
I couldnt tell if she was black or white  
It didnt matter in the artificial light  
Artificial light  
Artificial light  
Artificial light  
Artificial light  
  
First time I saw her she was easy to know  
She had nothing to hide she put it all out to show  
She didnt cover up or try to conceal  
I knew the way that she felt cause her expression was real  
She didnt cover up the inside  
She showed it all on the outside  
Stark naked in the artificial light  
  
Everybody gotta learn to relax  
To be yourself you have to put on an act  
Get together in the artificial light  
  
And if I saw her in the light of day  
I wouldnt know what to say I wouldnt know what had happened  
I only want to know a world below  
Where we can be ourselves beneath an artificial glow  
  
And if youre scared what your friendll say  
And youre embarrassed by the light of day  
Get together in the artificial light  
  
Everybody let yourself go  
Everybody to a floor show  
Get together in the artificial light  
Artificial light  
Artificial light  
Artificial light  
Artificial light
