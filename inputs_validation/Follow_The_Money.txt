Ive got to follow the money  
Gotta go to work  
Gotta make a living  
Till my body hurts  
Gotta bite my lip  
Gotta wreck my health  
Gotta break my back  
For my share of wealth  
  
Ive got to follow the money  
Gotta go to work  
Gotta make a living  
Till my body hurts  
Gotta bite my lip  
Gotta wreck my health  
Gotta break my back  
For my share of wealth  
  
Ive gotta the follow money  
Gotta earn my pay  
I spent everything  
I earned yesterday  
Gotta find the cash  
Cause it wont find me  
So I can feed myself  
And my family  
  
When I left school I was bummin around  
Id smoke and drink and let my mind wander  
Id roll out of bed about twelve oclock  
I cant do that any longer  
  
Ive gotta follow the money  
Gotta go to work  
Gotta make a living  
Till my body hurts  
Gotta bite my lip  
Gotta wreck my health  
Gotta break my back  
For my share of wealth  
  
Now I need to toil cause its good for my soul  
I feel clean when Im working  
You drop all the mystical Celtic bull  
Cause that stuffs just jerking  
  
Im not saying that I work like my dad  
I know I dont work like my mum  
But Im made of the same stuff  
And Im six feet tall  
Gimme the tools Ill get the job done  
  
Gotta follow the money  
Gotta go to work  
Gotta make a living  
Till my body hurts  
Gotta bit my lip  
Gotta break my back  
For my share of wealth  
Ive gotta follow the money  
Gotta earn my pay  
I spent everything  
I earned yesterday  
Gotta find the cash  
Cause it wont find me  
So I can feed myself  
And my family  
Feed myself and my family  
Thats why  
  
Im working  
Im working  
Im working  
Im working  
Im working  
Im working now
