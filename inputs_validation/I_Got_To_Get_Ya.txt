Na na na na na  
Na na na na na  
  
Aint got a damn  your last thing may change  
Get to your Virgo to feel you I could change  
 I know he wanted fame  
You stay there I gotta a problem man  
I gotta fix this like were in plan  
I still sip  follow no trance beyond verse thats beyond thoughts  
I just say it hoe this is my fault my fault my better need the   
Computer love  shes rocking that   
Smell like living at least  cause I got a good feeling  
Gotta get your girl cause your  got willing  
My dream girl  
  
So I got to get you I cant let you get away from  
I cant let you get away from me  
I gotta get you  
I got to get you I cant let you get away from  
I cant let you get away  
I cant let you get away  
Oh Canada oh Canada  
  
I notice my cookies dont crumble  
Whats up is got me on form Toronto  
My favorite  no stereo  
You know it is falling  
Our bigger first day in New York  
Pardon  said I look like a  boss  
Deserve double lubba tons I bought  
I pray  to get me to the Lord  
But I ran now just what I respect  
Not a hand down not one for the jealousy  
Im a  eleven seven seven six but Im   
So random youre the atom  
Dont let it be spread like cancer
