Well its time to pay the fiddler and its sad to know weve danced it all
away  
But the one nights disappearing leaving nothin but the cold hard light of
day  
And its time to start erasin all the rainbows weve been chasing in our
minds  
We know theres no way of making other ties on us unravel and unwind  
Yes its time to pay the fiddler and todays the day the thirsty someones do  
For the rest of all my days I wonder why the maker mismatched me and you  
But theres so much to consider like my man and little baby  
Will need and want my love just like you do  
Now its time to pay the fiddler but before we pay the fiddler  
Lets say to him please play one last final tune  
 fiddle   
Well its time to pay the fiddler now theres naked sorrow drippin from my
eyes  
Onry stranded and unshamed weve loved each other now weve got to leave it
lie  
But I can feel my hands a trembling and I search to find a handle on the door  
So lets let the fiddler pull his magic bow across our heart strings just once
more  
Yes its time to pay the fiddler
