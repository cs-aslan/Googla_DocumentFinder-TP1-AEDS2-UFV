Bessie was more than just a friend of mine  
We shared the good times and the bad  
Many years have since passed me by  
I still recall the best thing I ever had  
  
Now Im going down the road to see Bessie  
Oh To see her soon  
Im just going down the road to see Bessie Smith  
When I get there Im a wondering what shell do  
  
Now all the crazy things I had to try  
Well I tried them all and then some  
If you look you one day you will find out  
Where it is that your really coming from  
  
Now Im going down the road to see Bessie  
Oh To see her soon  
Im just going down the road to see Bessie Smith  
When I get there Im a wondering what shell do  
  
Now in my day Ive made some foolish moves  
But back then I didnt worry about a thing  
Now and again I still wonder to myself  
Was it the sweet love or the way that she could sing  
  
Im just going down the road to see Bessie  
Oh To see her soon  
Im just going down the road to see Bessie Smith  
When I get there Im a wondering what shell do
