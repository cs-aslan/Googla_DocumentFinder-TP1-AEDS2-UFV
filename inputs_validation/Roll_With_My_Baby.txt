Went to see my sweetheart  
Last night around about ten  
She said Home sweet Papa  
Squeeze me every now and then  
  
Ill keep rolling with my baby  
Ill keep rolling with my baby  
Ill keep rolling with my baby  
Cause shes sweet that way  
  
We went out to a movie  
Stop in the very last row  
We hadnt been there a good five minutes  
Before shes ready to go  
  
I had to roll with my baby  
I had to roll with my baby  
I had to roll with my baby  
Cause shes sweet that way  
  
Ive got a quarter a nickel and a dime  
Cant buy me no whiskey  
I guess Ill have to settle for wine  
And then I can  
  
Roll with my baby  
I know I can roll with my baby  
Im sure I can roll with my baby  
Cause shes sweet that way  
  
Shes such a sweet woman  
Ill never let her go  
Cause deep down inside of me  
Lord knows I love her so  
  
Ill keep rolling with my baby  
Ill keep rolling with my baby  
Ill keep rolling with my baby  
Cause shes sweet that way
