I was ten years old on my grandpas farm when it happened  
After all these years i can still hear grandpa laughin  
As he applied that barnyard remedy  
He passed his wisdom down to me  
You dont reach for the honey without smokin the hive  
  
I remember my first crush was on the preachers daughter  
We were smoochin on the front porch swing that night when he caught her  
We werent expectin him home until quarter past ten  
When the good Lord taught me that lesson again  
You dont reach for the honey without smokin the hive  
  
Chorus  
You dont point your pistol before you check each chamber  
And you dont drink no you dont drink when you drive  
Its just ordinary common sense to avoid that danger  
You dont reach for the honey without smokin the hive  
  
She rolled into town with rodeoshe was a beauty  
And that cowboy saw you wink at hershe was a cutie  
The sound of jinglin spurs caught me dead on a run  
He was fit to be tied and you were under the gun  
You dont reach for the honey without smokin the hive  
  
Chorus  
You dont point your pistol before you check each chamber  
And you dont drink no you dont drink when you drive  
Its just ordinary common sense to avoid that danger  
You dont reach for the honey without smokin the hive  
  
Noyou dont reach for the honey without smokin the hive  
Youre gonna get stung boy
