The sun is out the sky is blue  
Theres not a cloud to spoil the view  
But its raining  
Raining in my heart  
  
The weatherman says fine today  
He doesnt know that youve gone away  
And its raining  
Raining in my heart  
  
Aww aww misery aww misery  
Aww whats gonna become of me oh woe  
I tell myself my blues wont show but I know  
That soon all my tears will flow come a  
Raining down raining in my heart  
  
Aww oh aww misery oh you misery  
Aww whats gonna become of me woah  
  
The sun is out the sky is blue  
Theres not a cloud to spoil the view  
But its raining oh its raining in my heart
