Hey mom and dad I dont know where to start  
I hate to break the news but I got a broken heart  
That sweet southern belle that I met in Tennessee  
Got a hickey on her neck and it aint from me  
Seems theres someone special shes been meeting at the gym  
but the crazy thing about it is that someones not a him  
  
Chorus  
My girlfriends got a girlfriend now  
It was cool for a minute now its bringing me down  
People talkin bout it all over this town  
My girlfriends got a girlfriend now  
  
All my friends say shes just going through a phase  
and I believed her when she said I just need a little space  
But then I found pictures on her cellular phone  
of them doing things when I wasnt home  
It hit me like a brick I guess I should have seen the signs  
This was more than just a friend and a bottle of wine  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah mom and dad really nothing left to say  
Ill be sure to keep you posted if she swing it back this way  
I guess Im not as sad as you think I might be  
The part that makes me mad is that they didnt invite me  
  
Chorus  
My girlfriends got a girlfriend now  
My girlfriends got a girlfriend now
