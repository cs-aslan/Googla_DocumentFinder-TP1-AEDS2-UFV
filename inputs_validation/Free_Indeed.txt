Can you think of the way that we used to be  
We were young full of hopes and full of dreams  
Look around what has happened in between  
Living life can steal your hope away it seems  
  
Dream again  
Oh youre like a child whos waiting to become  
  
Chorus  
The Son has come to free us  
Set your eyes on Jesus  
Your free now  
Know that you are free indeed  
To love to live to dream  
To love as He has loved you  
To live like Hes among you  
To dream now  
Know that you are free indeed  
  
When your world is a dark and lonely place  
Turn your eyes from yourself and seek His face  
Theres hope in His open arms  
And a peace thats gonna free your heart and mind  
  
Breathe again  
Oh youre free to fly and young to run  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
But for me to live is Christ  
That would be no sacrifice  
I freely give Him all my life  
  
Repeat Chorus
