What you gonna tell your dad  
Its like a wheel of fortune  
And what you gonna tell your dad  
If this wheel lets you down  
My love is my engine  
And you might be fuel  
Stop acting cool  
Just bet you might win  
Im not too cool  
Im in love with another fool  
  
Dont push me  
I dont what to cant you see it  
Hasten slowly  
And dont count your chicks  
Before there hatched baby  
  
What you gonna tell your  
  
Hey you  
Were gonna make you move  
It tastes like steel  
Like a stab from a knife  
  
What you gonna tell your  
Im on love with another fool  
  
Im in love with you I like your style  
I want you Im in love  
  
What you gonna tell your
