Dont really want to fall out of love  
And baby I need a lovin shove  
To get back in lord to get back in  
To get back in once again baby  
  
Oooo baby when times are good  
You know they couldnt get no better if they tried to  
But theres a question standing where I stood  
You know you act just like the person thats been lied to  
  
You aint been treatin me like you know you should  
Theres been a change in your way  
Remember what its like when love is good  
And remember the chorus cause I wrote it for us  
  
Dont really want to fall out of love  
And baby I need a lovin shove  
To get back in oh to get back in  
To get back in once again  
  
You know I love that girl with all my heart  
And like wine with age it gets better  
But I dont like trouble and when trouble starts  
Its the times I wish I could forget her  
  
If you give em an inch boy then theyll take a mile  
And gettin it backs so hard to do  
Theyll take advantage of your gentle style  
But youve got to forgive them cause youre tryin to live with them  
  
Woah  woah  
Woah woah  woah  
To get back in to get back in to get back in once again  
To get back in to get back in to get back in once again babe  
  
To get back in
