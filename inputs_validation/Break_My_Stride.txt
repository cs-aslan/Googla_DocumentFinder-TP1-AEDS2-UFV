Was actually sung by Unique ii  
  
Last night I had the strangest dream  
I sailed away to China in a little row boat to find ya  
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned  
Didnt want no one to hold you what does that mean And you said  
  
Chorus  
Aint nothin gonna break my break my stride  
Nobody gonna slow me down oh no  
Ive got to keep on movin  
Aint nothin gonna break my stride  
Im runnin and I wont touch ground oh no  
Ive got to keep on movin  
  
Youre on the road and now you pray its gone  
The road behind was rocky but now youre feelin cocky  
You look at me and you see your past  
Is that the reason why youre runnin so fast and you said  
  
Chorus  
  
Never let another girl like you work me over  
Never let another girl like you drag me under  
If I meet another girl like you I will tell her  
Never want another girl like you have to say oh
