As long as he needs me  
Oh yes he does need me  
In spite of what you see  
 Im sure that he needs me  
  
Who else would love him still  
When theyve been used so ill  
He knows I always will  
As long as he needs me  
  
I miss him so much when he is gone  
But when hes near me  
I dont let on  
  
 The way I feel inside  
The love I have to hide  
The hell Ive got my pride  
As long as he needs me  
  
He doesnt say the things he should  
He acts the way he thinks he should  
But all the same  
Ill play  
This game  
His way  
  
As long as he needs me  
I know where I must be  
Ill cling on steadfastly  
As long as he needs me  
  
As long as life is long  
Ill love him right or wrong  
And somehow Ill be strong  
As long as he needs me  
  
If you are lonely  
Then you will know  
  
When someone needs you  
You love them so  
  
I wont betray his trust  
Though people say I must  
  
Ive got to stay true just  
As long as he needs me
