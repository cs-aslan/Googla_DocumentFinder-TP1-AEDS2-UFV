Something inside the cards  
I know is right  
Dont want to live  
Somebody elses life  
This is what I want to be  
And this is what I give to you  
Because I get it free  
She smiles while I do my time  
  
I could die for you  
Oh this life I choose  
  
Im here to be your only gobetween  
To tell you of the sights  
These eyes have seen  
What I really want to do is  
Turn it into motion  
Beauty that I cant abuse  
You know that Id use my senses to  
You can see that  
Its only everywhere  
Id take it all and then  
Id find a way to share  
  
Come along and go  
Along with me  
Wander with me yo  
Its all for free  
  
I could die for you  
What you want to do  
Oh this life I choose  
  
Come again and tell me  
Where you want to go  
What it means for me  
To be with you alone  
Close the door and  
No one has to know  
How we are  
  
Come along and go  
Along with me  
Wander with me yo  
Its all for free  
  
I could die for you  
What you want to do  
Oh this life I choose
