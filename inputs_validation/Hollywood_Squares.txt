Ive always said I do too easy  
And now Im payin the price  
A weakness for beautiful women  
Is my most expensive vice  
I still believe in matrimony  
But I cant afford another try  
Child support and alimony  
Is just about to bleed me dry  
  
Ive got exs all across the country  
And I owe everybody in town  
Ive got bill collectors callin me up  
And lawyers tryin to track me down  
Im just one wrong move from the poor house  
But I dont belong in there  
Ive got so many exs and owe so much  
I ought to be on Hollywood Squares  
Yeah I ought to be on Hollywood Squares  
  
Lookin back over my love life  
I only have myself to blame  
I guess I shouldve checked the price tag  
Before I gave em my last name  
Now my credit ratins in the gutter  
And the bottom line sure looks bad  
Ill be payin the rest of my life  
For the few good times Ive had  
  
Ive got exs all across the country  
And I owe everybody in town  
Ive got bill collectors callin me up  
And lawyers tryin to track me down  
Im just one wrong move from the poor house  
But I dont belong in there  
Ive got so many exs and owe so much  
I ought to be on Hollywood Squares  
Yeah they ought to put me on Hollywood Squares
