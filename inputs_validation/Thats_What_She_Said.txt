There are people who say what you want to hear  
Even on a rainy day theyll tell you the sky is clear  
When you really really love someone  
And Im right when I say that you want them near  
And if you cant even tell  
Them things that they want to hear  
  
Chorus  
Always forever all the things she said  
Never say never those simple lies that she fed  
I will never leave you  
All the love I thought she had  
But can you blame me no  
Cause thats what she said  
Thats what she said  
She told me wed see forever  
Thats what she said she said yeah  
  
And  
There are people who that say what they really mean  
She said shed always be there  
She said shed always care  
But just when you think that you can trust that someone ya love  
Tell me why do you know  
How stars can fall from above  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause you made promises that you couldnt keep  
But youre not hurting yourself  
But youre only hurting me youre only hurting me  
Why would you say things that you really didnt mean  
Oh how can I make you see justa what you did to me  
  
Oh you said how much you really cared  
Just when I thought I was in love  
Girl how could you dare  
If I were you I wouldnt lie not evena once  
To the face of the one that I love so much  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh thats what she said
