Come to me Ill fill the hole  
Why would I be lying  
End fan all planned out  
  
Offering a wonderful  
Peace of mind worth buying  
Bow down last round up  
  
I am wise and you dont know  
A cloud is my home  
Only some get in  
Got a maginary friend  
  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
Jesus dont like a queer  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
No problem with faith just fear  
  
Promise those whove gone before  
Waitin on you flyin  
Leading receiving us  
  
Im as flawed as any man  
Look at me Im smiling  
Drink me eat me up  
  
I am wise and you dont know  
A cloud is my home  
Only some get in  
Got a maginary friend  
  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
Jesus dont like a queer  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
No problem with faith just fear  
  
I am wise and you dont know  
A cloud is my home  
Only some get in  
Got a maginary friend  
  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
Jesus dont like a queer  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
The problem with faith  
  
Fear  
  
Liar liar liar liar liar liar
