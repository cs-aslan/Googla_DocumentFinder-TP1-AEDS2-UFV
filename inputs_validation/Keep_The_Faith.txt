If you call out loud  
Will it get inside  
Through the heart of your surrender  
To your alibis  
And you can say the words  
Like you understand  
But the powers in believing  
So give yourself  
A chance

Climb the highest mountain  
Swim the deepest sea hee  
All you need is the will to want it  
And little selfesteem  
  
So keep the faith  
Dont let nobody turn you round  
You gotta know when its good to go  
To get your dreams up off the ground  
  
Keep the faith baby yea  
Because its just a matter of time  
Before your confidence will win out  
Believe in yourself no matter what its gon take  
You can be a winner  
But you got to keep the faith

And when you think of trust  
Does it lead you home  
To a place that you only dream of when youre all alone  
And you can go by feel  
stead of circumstance  
But the powers in beliving  
So give yourself a chance

Sail across the water  
Float across the sky high  
Any road that you take will get you there  
If you only try
