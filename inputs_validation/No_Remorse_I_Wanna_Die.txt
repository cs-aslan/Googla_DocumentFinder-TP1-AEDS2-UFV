Its the terror that youve gotta miss  
And I wanna see you right in front of death  
Your eyes will shine  
Were all alone and there is no noise  
  
Step into my shadow  
With no remorse  
  
With no remorse you aint gotta die  
The loudest noise cant make me happy  
Come on bastards feels so good  
The records coming out baby  
  
With no remorse I want to die  
  
No remorse  
With no remorse I wanna die  
  
Remain calm Im coming to your house to kill you  
  
I cant come down  
  
No remorse  
With no remorse I wanna die  
  
What you want me to do  
What you want me to do  
  
No remorse cause I wanna die  
  
No remorse  
With no remorse I wanna die
