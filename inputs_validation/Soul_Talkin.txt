Some girls need emotion  
Some girls just want some fun  
Some look for devotion  
Some just wanna run  
Some crave for affection  
Burnin up inside  
Some need the direction  
For the world outside  
You can dance the dance til the mornin comes  
But Ill tell you where Im comin from  
CHORUS  
I wanna hear your soul talkin  
Wanna hear your soul talkin  
Wanna hear your soul talkin  
Its the heart of the matter  
Its the root of the cause  
Its the still of the moment  
Its that heavenly pause  
Well I dont need a savior  
And I dont need a slave  
I just want to hear you  
Through that magnetic wave  
What I need is a link to the inner mind  
If you want to know my bottom line
