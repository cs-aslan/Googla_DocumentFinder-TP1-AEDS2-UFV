So naive it helps me to breathe  
Your smile I keep on file  
You tickle me pink  
I love the way you think  
So when Im feeling low I know  
Im your greatest fan  
  
Little man Im endlessly proud of you  
In such a short time span  
Youve filled my heart with joy  
As I grow older you grow wiser  
Watching my mistakes  
Memorize where Ive gone wrong  
  
If they fall way  
Ill stay with you  
But do as I say and not as do  
Trust me and youll see  
All I want is what is best for you  
  
Little man your head is full of dreams  
If only I could spend one day touring  
Your imagination  
If I live longer youll grow faster  
At recognizing the traps that cause  
Me such frustration  
  
If they fall way  
Ill stay with you  
But do as I say and not as I do  
Trust me and youll see  
All I want is what is best for you  
  
So naive it helps me to breathe  
Your smile I keep on file  
You tickle me pink  
I love the way you think  
So when Im feeling low I know  
Im your greatest fan
