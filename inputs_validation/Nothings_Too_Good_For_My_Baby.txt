Hey  
  
Nothings too good for my baby  
Nothings too good for my girl  
Nothings too good for my baby  
Oh no  
Nothings too good for my girl  
  
Im the luckiest guy in the world  
Cause Ive got one pearl of a girl  
For my baby I work parttime  
Down at the neighborhood fiveanddime  
Half of my money goes to buy her  
Some of the things her little heart desires  
The other half goes dime by dime  
To show my cookie a real good time because  
  
Nothings too good for my baby  
Nothings too good for my girl  
Nothings too good for my baby  
Oh no  
Nothings too good for my girl  
  
Shes sweet and shes kind  
And she tells me that shes mine all mine now  
Aint that lovin aint that livin  
Aint that half the fun of givin  
  
Nothings too good for my baby  
Nothings too good for my girl  
Nothings too good for my baby  
Oh no  
Nothings too good for my girl  
  
I walk around with my chest stuck out  
Cause my babys worth bragging about  
Every Johnnie Jack and Jim  
Wished that she belonged to him  
I gave up the old gang of mine  
Cause with my girl goes all my time  
One of these days Im gonna buy her a ring  
And marry her  and everything because  
  
Nothings too good for my baby  
Nothings too good for my girl  
Nothings too good for my baby  
Oh no  
Nothings too good for my girl  
  
Shes sweet and shes mellow  
And she tells me that Im one heck of a fellow now  
Aint that lovin aint that livin  
Aint that half the fun of givin  
  
Coda  
Nothings too good for my baby  
Nothings too good for my girl  
Background voices continue
