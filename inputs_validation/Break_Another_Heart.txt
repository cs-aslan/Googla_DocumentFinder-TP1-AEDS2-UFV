You want the beating of another mans heart  
You want that face to tear us apart oh baby  
You want that love to take you high in the sky  
I watch you fly with tears in my eyes  
Now this is the end  
This is really goodbye  
Break another heart  
Find another fool  
Take another heart  
Run and treat it cruel  
Go break another heart into pieces baby baby  
Well I dont want to know and I dont want to stay  
Go cry to someone else I will walk away  
Go break another heart into pieces  
Baby baby Not mine  
I hold a woman I dont know anymore  
I kiss the lips Ive kissed a million times before  
I love that body but it dont feel the same  
You play the part in another mans game  
Och baby baby  
This love is in vain  
Break another heart  
Thinking bout all of the nights I held you so tight  
Two young hearts in the heat of the night together  
Side by side  
Break another heart
