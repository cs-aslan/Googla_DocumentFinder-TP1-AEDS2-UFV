Well Im out on a tear cause shes tearing me apart  
If I look rough on the outside you ought to see my heart  
And this look in my eyes shows beyond a doubt  
Since my woman left Im down and out  
  
Well Im down at the bar out of my mind  
Tighter than an eightday clock with no way to unwind  
That jukebox cries the blues like it knows what Im about  
Since my woman left Im down and out  
  
Well Im down to my last dollar but I dont really care  
My friends have all got whiskey and they dont mind if I share  
They know how it feels to have your heart torn inside out  
Since my woman left Im down and out  
  
Well Im down at the bar out of my mind  
Tighter than an eightday clock with no way to unwind  
That jukebox cries the blues like it knows what Im about  
Since my woman left Im down and out  
  
Since my woman left since my woman left
