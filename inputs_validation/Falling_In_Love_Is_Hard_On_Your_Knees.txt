One two three four  
Zummmbowayy  
  
Youre so bad youre so bad youre so  
Youre so bad youre so bad youre so  
  
You think youre in love

But every time you fall  
You get yo ass in a sling  
You used to be strong  
But now its ooh baby please  
Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
Youre so bad youre so bad youre so

We was making love  
When you told me that you loved me  
I thought ol cupid  
He was takin aim  
I was believer when you told me  
That you loved me  
And then you called me  
Someone elses name yeah  
  
There aint gonna be no more  
Beggin you please  
You know what I want  
And it aint one of these  
Youre bad to the bone  
And your girlfriend agreed  
That falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
Youre so bad youre so bad youre so  
Youre so bad youre so bad youre so  
  
Chip off the old block  
Man youre so much like your sister  
My fantasize it must be outta luck  
My old libido has been  
Blowing a transistor  
I feel like I have been hit by a fuck  
Yeah  
  
Im Jonesin on love  
Yeah I got the DTs  
You say that we will  
But there aint no guarantees  
Im major in love  
But in all minor keys  
Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
What are you looking for  
Its got to be hardcore  
Must be some kind of nouveau riche  
  
Is this your only chance  
Or some hypnotic trance  
Lets get you on a tighter leash  
Hold it hold it oh yeah yeah yeah  
  
Youre so bad youre so bad youre so  
Youre so bad youre so bad youre so  
  
You aint that good  
Is what you said  
Down to the letter  
But you like the way  
I hold a microphone  
Sometimes Im good but  
When Im bad Im even better  
Dont give me no lip  
I got enough of my own  
  
There aint gonna be  
No more beggin you please  
You know what I want  
And it aint one of these  
Youre bad to the bone  
And your girlfriend agreed  
That falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
Im jonesin on love  
Yeah I got the DTs  
You say that we will yeah  
But there aint no guarantees  
Im major in love  
But in all minor keys  
Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
