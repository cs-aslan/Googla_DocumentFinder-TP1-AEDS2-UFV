Well I just cant believe its time for leavin  
Even though Ive been deceivin you  
Guess I guessed that Ive been through it wrong again baby  
Though I remember when I fell in love with you  
Dont you think we ought a try it one more time  
Baby Im not gonna let you go this easy  
Dont you think we ought a try it one more time  
Oh I just cant get you outta my mind  
After all this time weve been together  
It just aint right to throw it all away  
Yes I know we have seen some stormy weather  
Though I know tomorrows gonna be a brand new day  
Dont you think we ought a try it one more time  
Baby Im not gonna let you go this easy  
Dont you think we ought a try it one more time  
Oh I just cant get you outta my mind
