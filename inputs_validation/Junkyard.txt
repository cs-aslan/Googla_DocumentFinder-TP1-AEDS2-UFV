Im long gone from vertical somewhere south is stopping me  
Im long gone from the american dream you may decide its not for me  
Im long gone but Ill let you through you may decide its not for you  
Im long gone but Ill let you through you may decide theres nothing there  
Born in a junkyard  
Im long gone but Ill let you through you may decide that its not good  
Im long gone but Ill let you leave you may decide on stopping me  
Im long gone but Ill let you through you may decide its not that good  
Im long gone but Ill let you leave you may decide on stopping me  
Born in a junkyard  
Gone
