There was a girl who couldnt speak  
Who couldnt speak her mind  
Only thing she was good at  
Was telling stories of faraway lands  
  
There was a guy who couldnt say  
Who couldnt say what he wanted  
Only thing he was good at  
Was cracking jokes to make people laugh  
  
So many words he swallowed  
So many thoughts she kept to herself  
And when they met they made love  
And talked about the world and the weather  
  
So many cities he walked  
So many countries she traveled  
And in their dreams they would listen  
To the sound of the sea they heard together
