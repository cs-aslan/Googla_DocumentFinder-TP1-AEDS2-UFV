Today I will be a savior  
Tomorrow a demon  
You crave my erratic behavior  
And watch my every move  
  
Obsession at all costs  
Youll be the death of me  
Broken and torn apart  
Why cant you let me be  
  
You build me up you break me down  
Until Im falling to pieces  
I crash and burn I never learn  
Im your guilty addiction  
Build me up  
Break me down  
  
Today a savior  
Tonight I am the new messiah you deify  
When Im no longer desired  
Ill be crucified  
  
The one whos free from sin  
The first to cast the stone  
Fighting the fear within  
I wont be left alone  
  
You build me up you break me down  
Until Im falling to pieces  
The price I pay to live this way  
And the fantasy stays alive  
I cant live up I cant let down  
And leave you falling to pieces  
I crash and burn I never learn  
Im your morning obsession  
Build me up  
Break me down  
  
I will be your savior  
  
You build me up you break me down  
Until Im falling to pieces  
The price I pay to live this way  
And the fantasy stays alive  
I cant live up I cant let down  
And leave you falling to pieces  
I crash and burn I never learn  
Your iconic fixation  
Build me up  
Break me down  
Build me up  
Break me down
