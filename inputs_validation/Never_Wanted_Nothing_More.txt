I couldnt wait to turn sixteen  
And drive all the boys around  
Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel  
Was all I could think about  
  
A little rust in the bed of that truck  
And a four speed on the floor  
Five hundred dollars  
It was mine all mine  
And I never wanted nothing more  
  
I took Katie down by the river  
With a six dollar bottle of wine  
Just a fool tryin to play it cool  
Hopin shed let me cross the line  
  
And I was prayin that she couldnt tell  
Id never been that far before  
The first times a one time feeling  
And I never wanted nothin more  
No I never wanted nothin more  
  
Chorus  
Well Im what I am and Im what Im not  
And Im sure happy with what Ive got  
I live to love and laugh a lot  
And thats all I need  
  
My buddies all tried to change my mind  
But I told them that I thought it through  
Well Katie laughed and my momma cried  
When they heard me say I do  
  
Her little ring was a little thing  
But it was all that I could afford  
Now shes mine all mine  
Till the day I die  
And I never wanted nothing more  
No I never wanted nothing more  
  
Well Im what I am and Im what Im not  
And Im sure happy with what Ive got  
I live to love and laugh a lot  
And thats all I need  
  
One Sunday I listened to the preacher  
And I knew he was preaching to me  
I couldnt help it I walked up front  
And I got down on my knee  
  
Right then and there I swear  
I changed when I found the Lord  
Glory Hallelujah good God Almighty  
I never wanted nothing more  
No I never wanted nothing more  
  
Well Im what I am and Im what Im not  
And Im sure happy with what Ive got  
I live to love and laugh a lot  
And thats all I need  
  
I never wanted nothing more  
And I never wanted nothing more
