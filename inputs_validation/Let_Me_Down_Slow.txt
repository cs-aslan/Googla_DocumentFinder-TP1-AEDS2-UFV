You look a little dressed up  
Youre acting way too smart  
Your face a little bit flushed  
For a walk in the park  
  
And youre clutching your phone  
As you walk in the dark  
And your smiles got a twist  
Youre looking so hardcore  
  
If youve something to say  
Dont be too direct  
Cause I feel a little fragile  
Dont hit the nail on the head  
  
Why I said baby baby let me down real slow  
Oh no no no  
Why I said baby baby let me down real slow  
No no no  
  
Theres a swish in your step  
Theres a gleam in your eye  
Are you coloring your hair  
With some new kind of dye  
  
But the first one to blink  
Is the first one to fall  
I dont want a confrontation  
Ive got my back to the wall  
  
Oh baby baby let me down real slow  
Oh no no no  
Why I said baby baby let me down real slow  
Oh na na no  
  
Oh baby baby let me down real slow  
Let me stretch out in the afterglow  
Oh na na na na  
  
Let me down real slow  
Oh na na na baby let me down real slow
