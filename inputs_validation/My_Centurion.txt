Somewhere in  
Dark corners  
I know  
Something is wrong  
  
No fear  
No talking  
Just this long wait for pain  
  
Scream scream  
Were going down  
My centurion dies  
  
All I can do now is wait for the noise  
  
Im so helpless and  
I could just cry inside  
No No  
  
Oh God  
Look at the speed  
Were going in  
  
So this  
Is death and  
Its so  
Calm Im surprised  
  
All I can do now is wait for noise  
  
This machine  
No sign of life  
Only the whisper of air  
  
She wont turn  
She wont climb  
She wont stop  
She wont fly  
  
Im falling  
Im silent  
Im thinking  
Im waiting for this thing to end  
  
All I can do now is wait for the noise
