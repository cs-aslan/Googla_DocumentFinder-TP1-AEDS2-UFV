I dont mind working cause I used to be jerking off most of my time in bars  
Ive been a cabbie and a stock clerk and a sodafountain jockjerk  
And a manic mechanic on cars  
Its nice work if you can get it now who the hell said it  
I got money to spend on my gal  
But the work never stops and Ill be busting my chops  
Working for Joe and Sal  
  
And I cant wait to get off work and see my baby  
She said shed leave the porch light on for me  
Im disheveled and Im disdainful and Im distracted and its painful  
But this job sweeping up here is gainfully employing me tonight  
  
Well Tom do this and Tom do that and Tom dont do that  
Count the cash clean the oven dump the trash  
Oh your loving is a rare and a copacetic gift  
And Im a moonlight watch manic its hard to be romantic  
Sweeping up over by the cigarette machine  
Sweeping up over by the cigarette machine  
  
I cant wait to get off work and see my baby  
Shell be waiting up with a magazine for me  
Clean the bathrooms and clean em good oh your loving I wish you would  
Come down here and sweep ame off my feet this broomll have to be my baby  
If I hurry I just might get off before the dawns early light
