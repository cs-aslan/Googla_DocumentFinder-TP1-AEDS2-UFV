Chorus  
Say I have known some  
Less than I should  
Say I have known some  
Too well for my own good  
Say Im a saint of mercy  
Say Im a whore  
Ive been a lot of things  
But never yours  
  
I wear my mamas dress  
Her finest clothes  
Daddy showed me outside  
To meet you on the front porch  
I laugh at all your jokes  
But you look bored  
Ive been a lot of things but never yours  
  
You never cross my mind  
You can be sure  
Youll never catch my eye  
Waiting for you watching the door  
I let you hold me  
Dry lip kiss me on the dance hall floor  
Ive been a lot of things  
But never yours  
  
Never yours Repeat x8  
  
So you say you won  
It was a bet  
A game of pool or cards  
I repay my familys debt  
I let you lie beside me  
With no remorse  
Ive been a lot of things  
But never yours  
  
Chorus
