Guess that it was bound to happen  
Was just a matter of time  
But now Ive come to my decision  
And its aone of the painful kind  
Cause now it seems that you wanted a martyr  
Just a regular guy wouldnt do  
But baby I cant hang upon no lovers cross for you  
  
Yes I really got to hand it to you  
Cause girl you really tried  
But for evry time that we spent laughin  
There were two times that I cried  
And you were tryin to make me your martyr  
And thats the one thing I just couldnt do  
Cause baby I cant hang upon no lovers cross for you  
  
Cause tables are meant for turnin  
And people are bound to change  
And bridges are meant for burnin  
When the people and memries they join arent the same  
  
So Ill hope that you can find  
Another who can take what I could not  
Hell have to be a super guy  
Or maybe a super god  
Cause I never was much of a martyr before  
And I aint bout to start nothin new  
And baby I cant hang upon no lovers cross for you  
  
Cause tables are meant for turnin
