In the Big Rock Candy Mountains  
Theres a land thats fair and bright  
Where the handouts grow on bushes  
And you sleep out evry night  
Where the boxcars are all empty  
And the sun shines evry day  
Oh Im bound to go where there aint no snow  
Where the rain dont fall and the wind dont blow  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains  
  
Oh the buzzin of the bees in the peppermint trees  
Round the soda water fountains  
Where the lemonade springs and the bluebird sings  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains  
  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains  
You never change your socks  
And little streams of lemonade  
Come atricklin down the rocks  
The hobos there are friendly  
And their fires all burn bright  
Theres a lake of stew and soda too  
You can paddle all around em in a big canoe  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains  
  
Oh the buzzin of the bees in the peppermint trees  
Round the soda water fountains  
Where the lemonade springs and the bluebird sings  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
