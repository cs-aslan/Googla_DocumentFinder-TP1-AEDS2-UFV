I pull the blinds then I take my clothes off  
Dance around the house like nature boy  
My genitalia and pectoral muscles arent quite what I would like them to be  
But you dont see me  
No one can see me  
  
I pull my blinds  
Fill out my income tax form  
Pen in hand I write so legibly  
I have my kitty  
His name is Allowishus I stroke him  
But you dont see me  
No one should see me  
  
I pull the blinds  
For the sun glares off my tele and I find it quite so irritating  
I have my videosloads of Ren and Stimpy  
Bottoma bit of pornography  
But you dont see me  
No one should see me
