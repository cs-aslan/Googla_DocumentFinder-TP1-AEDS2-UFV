Baby its no mystery  
You dont have to tell me  
What youre doing here  
With all the stars in your blue eyes  
Washed away by disappointed tears  
  
You say another love has left you  
Feeling sad and insecure  
Youd like to think that its all worth it  
But now youre not so sure  
Baby just because its painful  
It doesnt mean its real  
Sometimes were simply desperate  
For something to feel uhhuh  
Dont underestimate love  
  
Its the same old bedtime story  
The same old dreams of glory  
We all hold on to  
Its all so beautifully tragic  
So painfully romantic  
But so far from the truth  
  
Baby I could slay your dragons  
But Id rather set them free  
All Im really asking is a chance to make you see  
There doesnt have to be a struggle  
There doesnt have to be a fight  
Before you taste the victory  
Before you feel its right uhhuh  
Dont underestimate love  
  
Oh we all look for love in our lives  
But sometimes all youve gotta do is just open up your eyes  
But does there have to be a reason  
Or does there have to be a storm  
Before we we look for shelter in each others arms  
Baby leave behind this madness  
Ill give you tenderness  
I dont wanna see you have to settle for less uhhuh  
Dont underestimate love  
Dont underestimate love
