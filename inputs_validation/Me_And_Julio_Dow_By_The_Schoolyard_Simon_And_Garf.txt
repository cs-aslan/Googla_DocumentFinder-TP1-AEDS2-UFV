Mama pyjama rolled outta bed and go to the police station  
When my papa found out he began to shout  
And started the investigation  
It was against the law it was against the law  
What your mama saw it was against the law  
  
Mama looks down and spits on the ground  
Every time my name gets mentioned  
And my papa said oy if I ever get that boy  
Im gonna stick him in the house of Detenton  
Said Im on my way I dont know where Im goin  
Said Im on my way Im takin my time but I dont know where  
  
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona  
Seein me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
Seein me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
  
Well in a couple of days theyre gonna take me away  
When the press let the story leak  
Now when the radical breach comes to get me released  
We all got on the cover of Newsweek  
Said Im on my way I dont know where Im goin  
Said Im on my way Im takin my time but I dont know where  
  
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona  
Seein me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
Seein me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
Seein me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
  
Said Im on my way I dont know where Im goin  
Said Im on my way Im takin my time but I dont know where  
  
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona  
Seein me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
Seein me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
Seein me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
Seein me and Julio down by the schoolyard
