Kool Keith  
Well Im the equalizer known to be graphic  
I clear static breakin up traffic  
Move while I enter the groove  
Im on top and happy to prove  
to wack MCs who claim to be better than  
No way Im frankly more clever than  
all of you each and every one my son  
Pay close attention  
I take your brain to another dimension  
Hold it mold it shape it  
You got a knife yes I wanna scrape it  
up and down sideways any way I can  
be rude to you  
But Ill rap and be crude to you  
And eat up toy ducks I beat up  
I am the oven your brains I wanna heat up  
Mega supersonic degrees  
I come around roastin MCs  
with fire to burn the toy liar  
Raw meat turn the flame higher  
Cook it like a fish Ill hook it  
For any beat its time that I took it  
right correctly to the top  
with the rhythm and as your head bop  
Im hype for the critical beatdown  
  
Ced Gee  
Im attacking them my job is stacking them  
For every rapper must I be smacking them  
once or twice in the face  
With rough beats producin the bass  
that blow out cause power to go out  
Inner spark Im ready to blow out  
like this altitude level  
Reachin forth stompin every devil  
in sight you might just wanna bite  
My illusions mental confusions  
Youre a mark skulls Ive been abusin  
Losin any rapper who follow me  
Your girl loves me now she wanna swallow me  
Back up move on to the rear  
When Im on the stage should be clear  
Speakin goin ear to ear  
Places far ducks would appear  
for the countdown so you wait to rhyme  
and twist stuttering uttering  
Parkay margerine everything butter  
and another thing you shoulda been a Muppet  
A toy boy a fake scream puppet  
Im takin titles and punks better up it  
to me Ced Gee on the mic and Im hype  
for the critical beatdown  
  
Kool Keith  
Heres the K combined the doubleO  
Swing in the L Im ready to go  
as Keith Rap General Chief Executive  
plus exquisitive  
Mandatory capital statements  
I am the teacher preaching what makes sense  
Class you wasnt able to pass  
For any germ or lice who come last  
Im boric high computing acid  
Get off the mic and wont you please pass it  
to me for a onetwo check  
Give me a pound and lots of respect  
No hands you dissapointing my fans  
You on reverb and talking to cans  
Hello  how are you doing  
I come to wreck and parties Ill ruin  
with rhymes pumpin up smoke  
Diesel advances makin them choke  
and cough up the hardheaded Ill soften  
spongee then after that drink a   
Roll the sess the buddha with the ganji  
Puff up while I make tough stuff up  
Im Kool Keith cold rippin MCs  
Im hype  for the critical beatdown
