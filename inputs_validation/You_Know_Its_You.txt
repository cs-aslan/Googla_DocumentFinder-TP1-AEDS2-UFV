I want to shake up this world  
And not to feel so useless  
And I long to wake up happy  
And not to feel so hopeless  
I want arms that never held me  
To pull me to my senses  
And wrap themselves around me  
Oh please let it come true  
Theres only one thing for me  
Darling darling darling  
You know its you  
  
I want someone up here beside me  
To wake up in heaven with all my worries behind me  
Thats what Id love to do  
There is something I have seen  
A vision in my dreams  
Who only comes it seems to tell me  
What I already knew  
Theres only one thing that can save me now  
And baby you know its you  
  
Ah  dyou ever see just what I see  
My whole life just flashed in front of me  
All my fears all my mistakes  
The heart that sings before it breaks  
Oh I want arms that never held me  
To wrap themselves around me  
And not to let me down too gently  
I need something to look forward to  
Theres only one thing that will do  
And you know darling you know its you
