Are you a man of peace  
Or a man of holy war  
Too many sides to you  
Dont know which anymore  
So many full of life  
But also filled with pain  
Dont know just how many  
Will live to breathe again  
  
A life thats made to breathe  
Destruction or defense  
A mind thats vain corruption  
Bad or good intent  
A wolf in sheeps clothing  
Or saintly or sinner  
Or some that would believe  
A holy war winner  
  
They fire off many shots  
And many parting blows  
Their actions beyond a reasoning  
Only God would know  
And as he lies in heaven  
Or it could be in hell  
I feel hes somewhere here  
Or looking from below  
But I dont know I dont know  
  
Chorus  
Please tell me now what life is  
Please tell me now what love is  
Well tell me now what war is  
Again tell me what life is  
  
More pain and misery in the history of mankind  
Sometimes it seems more like  
The blind leading the blind  
It brings upon us more famine death and war  
You know religion has a lot to answer for  
  
Chorus  
  
And as they search to find the bodies in the sand  
They find its ashes that are  
Scattered across the land  
And as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind  
A shot is fired somewhere another war begins  
  
And all because of it youd think  
That we would learn  
But still the body count the city fires burn  
Somewhere theres someone dying  
In a foreign land  
Meanwhile the world is crying stupidity of man  
Tell me why tell me why  
  
Chorus x2  
  
For the greater good of God x8  
  
Chorus x2  
  
For the greater good of God x8  
  
He gave his life for us  
He fell upon the cross  
To die for all of those  
Who never mourn his loss  
It wasnt meant for us  
To feel the pain again  
Tell me why tell me why
