Your butt is wide well mine is too  
Just watch your mouth or Ill sit on you  
The word is out better treat me right  
Cause Im the king of cellulite  
Ham on ham on ham on whole wheat all right  
  
My zippers bust my buckles break  
Im too much man for you to take  
The pavement cracks when I fall down  
Ive got more chins than Chinatown  
  
Well Ive never used a phone booth  
And Ive never seen my toes  
When Im goin to the movies  
I take up seven rows  
  
Because Im fat Im fat come on  
Fat fat really really fat  
You know Im fat Im fat you know it  
Fat fat really really fat  
You know Im fat Im fat come on you know  
Fat fat really really fat  
Dontcha call me pudgy portly or stout  
Just now tell me once again whos fat  
  
When I walk out to get my mail  
It measures on the Richter scale  
Down at the beach Im a lucky man  
Im the only one who gets a tan  
If I have one more pie a la mode  
Im gonna need my own zip code  
  
When youre only having seconds  
Im having twentythirds  
When I go to get my shoes shined  
I gotta take their word  
  
Because Im fat Im fat sha mone  
Fat fat really really fat  
You know Im fat Im fat you know it  
Fat fat really really fat  
You know Im fat Im fat you know it you know  
Fat fat really really fat  
And my shadow weighs fortytwo pounds  
Lemme tell you once again whos fat  
  
If you see me comin your way  
Better give me plenty space  
If I tell you that Im hungry  
Then wont you feed my face  
  
Because Im fat Im fat come on  
Fat fat really really fat  
You know Im fat Im fat you know it  
Fat fat really really fat  
You know Im fat Im fat you know it you know  
Fat fat really really fat  
Woo woo woo when I sit around the house  
I really sit around the house  
  
You know Im fat Im fat come on  
Fat fat really really fat  
You know Im fat Im fat you know it you know it  
Fat fat really really fat  
You know you know you know come on  
Fat fat really really fat  
And you know all by myself Im a crowd  
Lemme tell you once again

Fat fat really really fat  
You know Im fat you know ho  
Fat fat really really fat  
You know Im fat Im fat you know it you know  
Fat fat really really fat  
And the whole world knows Im fat and Im proud  
Just tell me once again whos fat
