Chorus  
Babe break me off a piece of your love  
Once its on I cant seem to get enough  
So keep it up keep it comin uh what  
Break me off some baby  
  
Youre wicked baby so do whats right  
Break me off a piece of that love tonight  
Like a steel guitar that I love to play  
Everyone loves Jesus on judgment day  
You get hot just like gasoline  
In your cashmere shirt and your cutoff jeans  
Ive been workin all day heres what I made  
Baby what you say break me off some  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X  
  
Down in Mexico theres a man I know  
Who gave away his future for a piece of gold  
He washed his hands in Noahs flood  
Now those mountains theyre just red as blood  
I left this place just to come with you  
Walkin off the mesa in some dead mans shoes  
Ive been workin all day heres what I made  
Baby what you say break me off some  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X  
  
Eie yie yie yie yie yie yie  
Eie yie yie yie yie yie yie  
  
I like the way youre movin on the dance floor baby  
I like the way youre moving on the dance floor baby  
  
Shake shake shake til my eyes are sore baby  
Shake shake shake til my eyes are sore baby  
  
Bounce bounce bounce til your body is sore baby  
Bounce bounce bounce til your body is sore baby  
Feel the heat Moe Z Put his hands on  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X
