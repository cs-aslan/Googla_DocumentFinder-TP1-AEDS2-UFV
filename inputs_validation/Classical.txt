Ahhhhh gucci gu you u ci  
Ahhhhh gucci gucci ahh  
Nothings goin to stop my reign2x  
  
Gucci Mane  
Heard my opponents run through problems  
Stoppable I jump over obstacles  
To stop my grind like star force john so powerful  
Probable mission impossible  
I said it two times nigga nigga stop lying  
Nigga tryin to sell but Im just not buying  
Look so nice but the kids knocked down  
I swear its sicker than a new fruit I got called swine  
  
Standin on twine like a uniform  
Truck like a uniform  
Everydays a work day  
But dont wear uniform  
Gucci Mane a dubadun  
Trouble like a capacorn  
Trouble month goin on makin money miricles  
  
O joka I be robbin  
And the riddle is batmans comb  
Tryin fuck my money up  
And rep koril lik pacman johns  
Dont print me nigga print me  
But can we agree to disagree  
Im from isn on six wit a boy dun bricks  
Where we dont bump the blueprint three  
Nigga box me jus like mesh p  
Cant fuck me like resh p  
Like ali I float like a butterfly  
Sting like a bee cuz its bug gucci gucci  
  
Chorus  
  
Streets derail maybe god dun fell  
Make oppurtunity knock but it jus email  
Make d a mail make watch me jail  
Take it like a champ wile the world mail me  
Young dont like me jay outsellin  
Left ha in the world cry yay kachellie  
We can be in it one with gucci  
Jaws so hard I can hardly do it  
Kus whoever I hurt you should live that movement  
Bae giv hev a chance through you new  
Konvectid fellon my little friends jailin  
My stash here you go and my bones dun swellin  
Krazy so I need boyz dat really  
My home kept skerp and my porch so iry  
So heartbroken my first felt weary  
Fall in the club and the hoe start cherrin  
So heard me hear me I now yall hear me  
I dont like ritin to mutch not really  
But I like brilies thrown by jimmy  
But I got a second chance like this can fell me  
This ant slap music this is trap music  
Oo boy da kelly they got jerk movemont  
Brick squad we rock da block  
Gucci mane I will force shakocks  
  
Chours2x
