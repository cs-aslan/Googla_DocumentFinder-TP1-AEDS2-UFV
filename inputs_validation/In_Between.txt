I am love I am hate  
Im an atheist with faith  
Vent my anger with a smile  
Im polite or obscene  
Either whisper or I scream  
Im not quite what I seem  
Im somewhere in between  
  
I am young in my old age  
I am calm or in a rage  
Im your friend or enemy  
A pacifist or at war  
I am rich but I am poor  
Im all extremes  
Im nowhere in between  
  
Wide awake  
Or in a dream  
Nowhere in between  
Like the pulse of a machine  
Im driven to extremes  
  
I feel the turmoil boil in me  
Im neither healthy nor diseased  
I am all extremes  
But Im still in between  
  
Say right or say wrong  
Outcast yet I belong  
Im high or Im dry  
Say I am weak yet I am strong  
  
In between  
In between  
  
I am my alter ego  
I am subconsciously  
In depth but also shallow  
Or somewhere in between  
  
Oh I know I am  
Always first in line or last  
I swim with sharks or drown with rats  
Ill defend as I attack  
My world and yours are not the same  
I am in a different lane  
I am not where I seem  
But Im somewhere in between  
  
I seek revenge  
As I forgive  
I die to live ah  
Not afraid but scared to death  
I dont fit in  
  
In between all extremes
