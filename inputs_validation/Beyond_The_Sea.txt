Somewhere beyond the sea  
Somewhere waiting for me  
My lover stands on golden sands  
And watches the ships that go sailing  
  
Somewhere beyond the sea  
Shes there watching for me  
And if I could fly like birds on high  
Then straight to her arms  
Id go sailing  
  
Its far beyond the stars  
Its near beyond the moon  
I know beyond a doubt  
My heart will lead me there soon  
  
Well meet beyond the shore  
Well kiss just as before  
Happy well be beyond the sea and  
Never again Ill go sailing  
  
Yeah  
  
Yeah  
  
Its far beyond the stars  
Its near beyond the moon  
I know yes I know beyond a doubt  
My heart will lead me there soon  
  
Well meet I know well meet beyond the shore  
And well kiss just as before  
And happy well be beyond the sea  
And never again Ill go sailing  
  
And never again Ill go sailing  
And never again Ill go sailing yeah
