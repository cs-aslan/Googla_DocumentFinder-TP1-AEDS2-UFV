Dont have much say  
But I call you up anyway  
Just to try and tell you the way  
That I feel today  
Oh I miss you baby  
  
Sure Im on the road  
I dont need to say much more  
Im just the same old well known stranger  
That I was before  
Seems like yesterday now  
  
Daddys all gone  
Hes just halfway home  
Hes holding on to the telephone  
Saying please dont let the show go on  
  
Theres a bus every other hour  
Even a midnight train yeah  
But that dont leave me the power to see your face again  
Its not that simple anymore  
  
Your see theres a room full of smiling faces  
And theres a man standing by the door  
Oh and he says its time we take our places  
And get down on the floor  
Oh Id like to kill him baby  
Ah ah no now  
  
Daddys all gone  
Hes just halfway home  
Hes holding on to the microphone  
Singing please dont let the show go on
