Im at the point of no return  
Im watching the candle burn  
Both ends  
Theres a lesson we  
Both can learn this time  
So if you wanna make my day  
Theres something  
Youve gotta say  
Now please dont laugh  
And turn away this time  
I dont wanna make a fuss  
But this is the time for us  
And I aint gonna miss the buss  
This time  
  
No return  
So therell be no turning back  
Once I know that  
Youll be by my side  
No return  
Maybe youll give me all the love  
That you always felt  
You had to hide  
No return  
Ive come a thousand miles  
Across the ocean  
But that aint half  
As far as my emotion  
Now Ive reached  
The point of no return  
  
While on my way down the avenue  
I had to stop for a drink or two  
Or three  
Now not that I was stalling you  
For time  
Its just I wanted to feel my best  
And I almost passed the test  
I need your lovin to do the rest  
This time  
  
No return so please dont ever do  
What youve done  
So many times before  
No return  
Because Ive made up my mind  
That this time Ill make it  
Through your door  
No return I rode above the clouds  
So far below me  
But didnt get as high as  
When you hold me  
Now Ive reached  
The point of no return  
  
Im at the point of no return
