Now thats what I call a manWhat are you gonna do about Warren  
Thats the first time in my life I felt like the opposite sex  
What are you gonna do about Warren I wonder if hell ask me  
Tomorrow night What are you gonna do about Warren What am I  
  
Gonna do about Warren Oh Warren doesnt careWarren cares  
Warren cares but I dont care You have to care because youre  
Engaged to him and you dont have to care about him because how  
Will he know he cares about you Then what are you gonna do  
  
What did you say  
When you know theres someone loving you  
And you know theres someone you love too  
And theyre not the same what do you do  
  
Go to sleep girl Go to sleep Go to sleep  
Close your eyes and hide from every care  
When you wake up they may not be there  
But tell me how can I sleep  
  
Tell me who could  
When you see your whole life tangled up good  
I could drink I could weep  
But tell me how can I sleep  
  
Go to sleep Go to sleep  
And when you and someone have a date  
Which you made when you were thinking straight  
And when you and someone stay out late  
It was bad too  
  
MmmBut I had to  
When theyre not the same who gets the gate  
This is not the way to find a mate  
Go to sleep girl Go to sleep Go to sleep  
  
 Go to sleep girl Go to sleep Go to sleep  
Comes the dawn I may not feel the same  
Comes the dawn he may not know your name  
In the sunlight who can see a flame  
  
But tell me how can I sleep look what Ive done  
Mess around with two men  
Soon youll have none  
As you sow so you reap  
  
Which is why I cant sleep mmm  
Go to sleep girl Go to sleep Go to sleep Go to
