So close and yet so far away  
And all the things Id hoped to say  
Will have to go unsaid today  
Perhaps until tomorrow  
Your fear has built a wall between  
Our lives and all what lovin means  
Will have to go unfelt it seems  
And that leaves only sorrow  
  
You built your tower strong and tall  
Cant you see its got to fall some day  
  
You close your eyes and speak to me  
Of faith and love and destiny  
As distant as eternity  
Truth and understanding  
The wind blows cold outside your door  
It whispers words Ive tried before  
But you dont hear me anymore  
Your prides just too demanding  
  
The end is coming soon its plain  
A warm bed just aint worth the pain  
And I will go and youll remain  
With the bitterness we tasted  
A mothers breast a newborn child  
A poets tear and drunken smile  
Cant help thinkin all the while  
Their meaning wont be wasted
