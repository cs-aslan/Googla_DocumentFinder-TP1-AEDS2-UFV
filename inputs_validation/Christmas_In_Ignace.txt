Its Christmas in Ignace  
Mommys got a rock  
Shell give it to Daddy  
Its Christmas in Ignace Its Christmas in Ignace  
Its Christmas in Ignace  
Daddys got a rock  
Hell give it to Mommy  
Its Christmas in Ignace Its Christmas in Ignace  
Its a jolly time here in Ignace  
As we decorate the Christmas Rock  
Its a happy time  
And if the children are good theyll get toys to play with  
Like rocks  
Its Christmas in Ignace  
Bobs got a rock  
But hes gonna keep it  
Its Christmas in Ignace Its Christmas in Ignace

Jills got a rock

Its Christmas in Ignace Its Christmas in Ignace  
Its a jolly time  
As we sit and watch Rocky 12345  
Its a happy time  
Except for Malcolm  
His tongue is stuck to the sign that says  
Welcome to Ignace  
Its Christmas in Ignace  
And all through the houses  
Not a creature is stirring  
Except for the rats  
That live here in Ignace  
Under the rocks  
That are played with by children  
And thrown at Malcolm  
Whos still stuck to the sign that says  
Welcome to Ignace  
Its Christmas in Ignace Its Christmas in Ignace
