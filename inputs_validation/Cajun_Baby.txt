Way down yonder in the bayou country in dear old Louisianne  
Thats where lives my Cajun baby the fairest one in the land  
Her teethre white and pearly hair black as coal  
Wouldnt trade my Cajun baby for the worlds gold  
Way down yonder in the bayou country in dear old Louisianne  
  
My hearts been sad and lonely since the day I left her side  
But today I got her letter said shed be my Cajun bride  
Gonna go and wed my Cajun baby and Ive by the old bayou  
Eat a lotsa shrimp and craw fish ride around in my old pirogue  
Way down yonder  
  
Before the sun goes down this evening Ill be on my way  
To see my Cajun baby and there Im gonna stay  
On a Saturday night we go dancin and listen to the fiddleo  
Lord I got me a Cajun baby just a livin and a lovin by the old bayou  
Way down yonder
