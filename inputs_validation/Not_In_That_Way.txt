Verse 1  
  
And I hate to say I love you  
When its so hard for me  
And I hate to say I want you  
When you make it so clear  
You dont want me  
  
Chorus  
Id never ask you cause deep down  
Im certain I know what youd say  
Youd say Im sorry believe me  
I love you but not in that way  
  
Verse 2  
And I hate to say I need you  
Im so reliant  
Im so dependant  
Im such a fool  
When youre not there  
I find myself singing the blues  
Cant bear  
Cant face the truth  
  
Bridge  
You will never know that feeling  
You will never see through these eyes  
  
Chorus  
Id never ask you  
Cause deep down Im certain I know what youd say  
Youd say Im sorry  
Believe me  
I love you  
But not in that way  
  
Youd say Im sorry  
Believe me  
I love you  
But not in that way
