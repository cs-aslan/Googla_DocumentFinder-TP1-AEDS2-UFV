Lets play remember lets play remember  
Remember the way that its played  
  
Remember the day that we went to the moon  
We went to the moon in the middle of June  
And as we blew over we met an old Incomprehensible  
I know you remember that now  
  
Lets play remember lets play remember  
Remember the way that its played  
  
Remember the time we were seven feet tall  
We used to pick apples and play basket ball  
Our beds were too short so we slept on the floor  
And you bumped your head on the door  
  
Lets play remember lets play remember  
Remember the way that its played  
  
Remember the time that we dressed up like clowns  
Our smiles were real big and our noses were round  
We didnt get hurt every time we fell down  
I know you remember the clown  
  
Remember the time we were both on TV  
And every one said that they love you and me  
We sang and we dance and we played and we grim  
And they told us they loved us again  
  
Remember the time we were both millionaires  
We didnt have worries we didnt have cares  
We fed all the hungry the poor and the weak  
Next day we were back on the street  
  
Oh well lets play remember lets play remember  
Remember the way that its played
