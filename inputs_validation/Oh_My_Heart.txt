The kids have a new take  
A new take on faith  
Pick up the pieces  
Get carried away  
  
I came home to a city halferased  
I came home to face  
What we faced  
This place needs me here to start  
This place is the beat of my heart  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
  
The storm didnt kill me  
The government changed  
Hear the answer and call hear this song rearranged  
Hear the trees the ghosts and the buildings sing  
With the wisdom to reconcile this thing  
  
Its sweet  
And its sad  
And its true  
How it doesnt look bitter on you  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
  
Mother and father  
I stand beside you  
The good of this world might help see me through  
This place needs me here to start  
This place is the beat of my heart  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart
