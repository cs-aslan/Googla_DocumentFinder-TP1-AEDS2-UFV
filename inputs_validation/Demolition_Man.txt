Let me loose I just got back  
I was pushed and I got dragged  
I tasted mud I tasted wine  
Ive kissed the life Ive left behind  
So say I choose to stick around  
I got news for this here town  
I kick the ball I catch the bus  
And raise the roof for all of us  
  
Destination anywhere  
So far gone Im almost there  
Cant you see I cant deny  
Im out of here like Im on fire  
  
Living like a cagedup animal criminal  
Television newsman so subliminal  
Bringing down the walls of wonderland  
Just another highbrow cowboy telling me  
Everything and everyone and all the things I ought to be  
Here I am your demolition man  
  
Steal your car and leave a wreck  
Kiss your bride I cash your check  
And Tyson plus Im ripped and torn  
Been on the edge since I was born  
I kick the jukebox change the tune  
I break the bank and jump the moon  
I sink the fleet to catch a buzz  
And raise a glass for all of us  
  
Destination anywhere  
So far gone Im almost there  
Cant you see I cant deny  
Im out of here like Im on fire  
  
Living like a cagedup animal criminal  
Television newsman so subliminal  
Bringing down the walls of wonderland  
Just another highbrow cowboy telling me  
Everything and everyone and all the things I ought to be  
Here I am your demolition man  
  
Im a beast in space  
Im an acid taste  
Im a primitive gong stuffed in your face  
Its enough to bring you to your knees  
  
Living like a cagedup animal criminal  
Television newsman so subliminal  
Bringing down the walls of wonderland  
Just another highbrow cowboy telling me  
Everything everyone and all the things I ought to be  
Here I am your demolition man  
Living like a cagedup animal criminal  
Television newsman so subliminal  
Bringing down the walls of wonderland  
Just another highbrow cowboy telling me  
Everything and everyone and all the things I ought to be  
Here I am your demolition man
