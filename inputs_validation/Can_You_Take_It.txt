Popeyes big punch knocks pluto cold  
Cartoon people dont go old  
Yosemite sam blows up his head  
But you and me wind up dead  
Dreamed I laid a toaster  
Daddy caught me in the act  
Can you take it  
Beauty queens get bigger all the time  
Mamma is in a basket crossed a double  
Yellow line  
Magazines and tv show us nice behinds  
All the kind of stuff nobody ever finds  
Headlines in the paper killed by rock n roll  
Can you take it
