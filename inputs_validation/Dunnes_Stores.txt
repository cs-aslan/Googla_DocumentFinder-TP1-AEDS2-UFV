Close your eyes and come with me back to 1984  
Well take a walk down Henry Street to Dunnes  
Department store  
The supermarkets busy and the registers make a din  
The groceries go rolling out and the cash comes rolling  
In  
  
Mary Manning is at the checkout and shes trying to  
Keep warm  
When a customer comes up to her with a basket on her  
Arm  
The contents of the basket Marys future is to shape  
But the label clearly stated Produce Of The Cape  
  
I cant check out your oranges Mrs now wont you bring  
Them back  
For they come from South Africa where White oppresses  
Black  
Id have it on my conscience and I couldnt sleep at  
Night  
If I helped support the system that denies Black  
Peoples rights  
  
Our union says Dont Handle Them Its the least that  
We can do  
We Fought oppression here for centuries well help  
Them fight it too  
The managers descended in an avalanche of suits  
And Mary was suspended cos she wouldnt touch the  
Fruits  
  
Chorus  
Dunnes Stores Dunnes Stores  
Dunnes Stores with St Bernard Better Value Beats Them  
All  
  
Well her friends are all behind her and the union gave  
Support  
And they called a strike and the pickets brought all  
Dunnes Stores to a halt  
No one was going to tell the Boss what he bought or  
Sold  
These women are only workers they must do as they are  
Told  
  
Isnt it just typical of a partite screwball law  
Its not just in South Africa the Rich Temple and the  
Poor  
He wouldnt have a boycott he couldnt give a tinkers  
Curse  
Doesnt matter how he fills the shelves as long as he  
Lines his Purse  
  
Chorus  
  
The messages came rollin in from all around the world  
For such concern and sacrifice and for courage brave  
And bold  
When 14 months were over 10 women and a man  
Had helped to raise the consiousness all around the  
Land  
  
Clearys in OConnell street wouldnt sell South  
African shoes  
Best Man sent all their clothes back Roches Stores  
Sent back their booze  
Until all South African goods were taken off the  
Shelves in Dunnes  
And Mary Manning was down in Henry Street sticking to  
Her guns  
  
Chorus
