Well I try and I try  
You cant forget her  
Cant run cant hide  
When you remember  
  
Nights that wont fade away  
Yea fade away  
Well I still go crazy  
When you hear her name  
  
Feels like you just left today  
And it drives you insane  
But you keep holding on  
Yeah holding on  
  
In the back of my mind  
You live all the time  
In the back of my mind  
In the back of my mind  
  
Every night every day  
Thats where you still play  
In the back of my mind  
When I close my eyes  
  
You can still touch her  
And I fantasize  
Shes still your lover  
When I wake up I see  
  
The only place youll be  
I know where youll be  
In the back of my mind  
You live all the time  
  
In the back of my mind  
In the back of my mind  
Every night every day  
Thats where you still play  
  
In the back of my mind  
I remember your eyes burning bright  
Like we touched the summer sun  
I can see your shadow standing there  
  
On the streets where we used to run  
Remember  
In the back of my mind  
You live all the time  
  
In the back of my mind  
In the back of my mind  
Every night every day  
Thats where you still play  
  
In the back of my mind  
In the back of my mind  
You live all the time  
  
In the back of my mind  
In the back of my mind
