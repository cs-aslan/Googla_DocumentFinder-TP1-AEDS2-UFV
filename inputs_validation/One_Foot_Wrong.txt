Am I sweating  
Or are these tears on my face  
Should I be hungry  
I cant remember the last time that I ate  
Call someone  
I need a friend to talk me down  
  
But one foot wrong  
And Im gonna fall  
Somebody gets it  
Somebody gets it  
Put one foot wrong  
And Im gonna fall  
Somebody gets it  
Somebody gets it  
All the lights are on  
But Im in the dark  
Whos gonna find me  
Whos gonna find me  
Just one foot wrong  
Youll have to love me  
When Im gone  
  
Does anyone see this  
Lucky me  
I guess Im the chosen one  
Color and madness  
First in line I put my money down  
Some freedom  
Is the tiniest cell its hell  
  
But one foot wrong  
And Im gonna fall  
Somebody gets it  
Somebody gets it  
Put one foot wrong  
And Im gonna fall  
Somebody gets it  
Somebody gets it  
All the lights are on  
But Im in the dark  
Whos gonna find me  
Whos gonna find me  
Just one foot wrong  
Youll have to love me  
When Im gone  
  
Some people find the beauty in all of this  
I go straight to the dark side the abyss  
If its bad  
Is it always my fault  
Or did somebody bring me down  
Or did somebody bring me down  
Did somebody bring me down  
  
One foot wrong  
Im gonna fall  
I put one foot wrong  
And Im gonna fall  
Put one foot wrong  
Im gonna fall  
Somebody gets it  
Somebody gets it  
Just one foot wrong  
All the lights are on  
But Im in the dark  
Whos gonna find me  
Whos gonna find me  
Just one foot wrong  
Youll love me  
When Im gone  
  
Have to love me when Im gone  
Love me when Im gone  
Youll have to love me when Im gone  
Youll have to love me when Im gone
