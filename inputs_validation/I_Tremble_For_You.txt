This world that I live in is empty and cold the loneliness cuts me and
tortures my soul  
Im no child of destiny and no fortunes son  
Ive just chased you so long now Im too weak to run  
A new day is here but nothing is new alone in my room I tremble for you  
 piano   
I know Ill return to the backstreets again to find what I need to prove Im a
man  
And there Ill treat shame like an old friend from home  
That I can lean on till my misery is gone  
A new day is here and nothing is new Im a picture of weakness as I tremble
for you
