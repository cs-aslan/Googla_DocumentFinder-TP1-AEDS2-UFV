And what will happen in the morning when the world it gets  
So crowded that you cant look out the window in the morning  
  
What will happen in the evening in the forest with the weasel  
With the teeth that bite so sharp when youre not looking in the evening  
  
And all the friends that you once knew are left behind they kept you safe  
And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime  
  
What will happen  
In the morning  
When the world it gets so crowded that you cant look out the window  
In the morning  
  
Hey take a little while to grow your brothers hair  
And now take a little while to make your sister fair  
And now that the family  
Is part of a chain  
Take off your eye shade  
Start over again  
  
Now take a little while to find your way in here  
Now take a little while to make your story clear  
Now that youre lifting  
Your feet from the ground  
Weigh up your anchor  
And never look round  
  
Lets sing a song  
For Hazey Jane  
Shes back again in my mind  
If songs were lines  
In a conversation  
The situation would be fine
