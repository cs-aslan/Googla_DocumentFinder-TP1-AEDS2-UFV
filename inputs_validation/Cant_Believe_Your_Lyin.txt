Daylight breaks and I go to bed  
And I find myself worryin about things you said  
Oh honey I cant believe your lyin  
But you tell me things  
Things I know arent true  
  
You have changed my life  
In too many ways  
  
Well I lost my job thinkin about you  
Now theres another man workin in my place  
Oh honey I cant believe your lyin  
But you tell me things  
Things I know arent true  
  
You have changed my life  
In too many ways  
  
You have changed my life  
In too many ways  
  
Well my moneys gone and so are you  
My friends all tell me I have been a fool  
Oh honey I cant believe your lyin  
But you tell me things  
Things I know arent true  
  
You have changed my life  
In too many ways
