Ill take you out of the wishin well  
I thinkin I have a plan  
Go with your bad self  
Why did you cheat yourself  
You think youre losing  
Chinas not accusing  
You never gonna take a hit on the head  
Now if you dont care  
Take a ride somewhere  
  
Hey you got something  
You gotta try and buy our soul  
Hey you got something  
It goes round and round again  
Go go you shouldve never waste your lung  
Go go and the ride was shared  
Go limo go limo  
  
I got you stuck in the habit trail  
Youve grown to lovin this shit  
Way out on a back shelf  
Yeah you dont know what youve done  
Look what youre doin  
Now mama says its ruined  
Youve got a mollusk in the palm of your hand  
So its a bad smell  
Your eyes wanna win  
  
Hey you got something  
You wanna try and buy our soul  
Hey you got something  
It goes round and round and round again  
Go go youre never having to waste your lung  
Go go and the ride was shared  
Go go whatever happened to DayGlo Jones  
Go go and the ride was shared  
Go limo go limo
