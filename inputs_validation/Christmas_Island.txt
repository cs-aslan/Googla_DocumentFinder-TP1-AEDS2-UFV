Lets get away from sleigh bells  
Lets get away from snow  
Lets make a break some Christmas dear  
I know the place to go  
  
Howd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island  
Howd ya like to spend the holiday away across the sea  
Howd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island  
Howd ya like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree  
  
Howd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do  
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe  
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island  
You will never stray for everyday  
Your Christmas dreams come true  
  
Howd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do  
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe  
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island  
You will never stray for everyday  
Your Christmas dreams come true  
On Christmas Island your dreams come true
