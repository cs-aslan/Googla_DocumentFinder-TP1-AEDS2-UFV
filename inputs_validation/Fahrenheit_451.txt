Yeah  
Fahrenheit four fiftyone  
Ya  
Fahrenheit four fiftyone  
Smoke is in the air now  
Its been spreading just like wildfire all over town  
Everybody wants to get in on the latest thing  
Going down to the bookstore  burn that mother down  
Ya  
Somebody has to do whats right  
Fahrenheit four fiftyone  
Burning black and white  
Well I got some education  
I go down to the library every night  
And Im looking for somebody with a dream like mine  
We could share a few pages round the fire so bright  
Now its spreading cross the nation  
And its time to seize the moment thats what they says  
cause its all been well reported in the daily news  
You can read all about it before it turns to ashes
