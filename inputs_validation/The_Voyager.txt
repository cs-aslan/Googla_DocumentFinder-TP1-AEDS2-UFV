now shes touched the earth  you feel her love  
pouring down like an endless rain  
of colours on your skin  
she descends out of the blue  
a breathless victor of time  
after more than a million lightyears preparing her comeback  
and shes rushing in  
from the outside  
on the crest of the seventh wave  
shes the crown of creation  
creating you  
the voyager  
is here to stay  
the voyager  
shes calling all stars  
the voyager  
shes riding a rainbow  
the voyager  
gives you the kiss of life  
watch out you cant ignore whats going on  
when your visions are drying out  
like the oceans from the underworld  
dont you know  
before you turn to stone  
you better head out for a royal trip  
to the ivory cityside  
and shes rushing in  
from the outside  
on the crest of the seventh wave  
shes the crown of creation  
creating you  
the voyager  
is here to stay
