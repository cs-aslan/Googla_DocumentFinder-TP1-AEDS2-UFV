No Ill never give the hunt up  
And I wont muck it up  
Somehow this is it I knew  
Maybe fate wants you dead too  
Weve come together in the very same room  
And Im coming for you  
  
Do you think Id ever let you  
Get away with it huh  
He swooned in warm maroon  
Theres gas in your barrel and Im flooded with Doom  
Youve made a wake of our honeymoon  
And Im coming for you  
  
All of the headLines said Passion Crime  
Newly weds Groom Shot Dead  
Mystery Man God help the bride  
Shes a widow all in red  
With his red still wet She said  
  
Ill put him on the wedding list  
Ill put him on the wedding list  
Ill get him and I will not miss  
  
Now as Im coming for you  
All I see is Rudi  
I die with him again and again  
And Ill feel good in my revenge  
Im gonna fill your head with lead  
And Im coming for you  
  
And when its all over youll roll over  
The butt of my gun  
One in your belly and one for Rudi  
You got what you gave by the heel of my bootie  
BangbangOut like an old cherootie  
Im coming for you  
  
All of the headLines said Passion Crime  
Newly weds Groom Shot Dead  
Mystery Man God help the bride  
Shes a widow all in red  
With his red still wet She said  
  
She sure got him on the wedding list  
Ill got him on the wedding list  
Ill got him and I will not miss  
Ill put him on the wedding list  
  
And after she shot the guy  
She committed suicide  
Im coming Rudi  
And later when they analyzed  
They found a little one inside  
It must have been Rudis child  
I shot I shot I shot him honey  
Never mind she got the guy  
He hit the ground Rudi  
An eye for an eye  
Ashes to ashes  
Eye for an eye  
I hit him hit him  
Rudi Rudi  
Im coming coming coming honey  
Eye for an eye  
Rudi
