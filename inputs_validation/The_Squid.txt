Its Friday night  
Im tired of searching for this life  
The weeks been cruel to me  
I just want to feel alright  
And all over town the words been going around  
Where I want to be  
Is wherever youll be found  
  
Mmm Hmm  
And now it takes up nearly all of my time  
Oh and I need  
I need some way  
I need some way to get you off my mind  
  
Oh cause sometimes when you get close to me  
It brings me close to heaven  
But I cant get in  
Ah No no no  
And the more you shy away from me  
To search for something better  
It hurts me slow  
And I dont know  
Cause Im the squid  
  
And now all this time I wait for you to realize  
Ill treat you lovingly  
Oh open up your eyes  
And once again I say I need you my friend  
Touch your lips to me  
Ill be your cigarette  
Yeah  
  
You know I love you so  
But I dont know  
And I wont know  
Exactly where were gonna go  
Gonna go no  
  
Cause sometimes when you get close to me  
It brings me close to heaven  
But I cant get in  
Ah no no no  
And the more you shy away from me  
To search for something better  
It hurts me slow  
I still dont know  
Cause Im the squid
