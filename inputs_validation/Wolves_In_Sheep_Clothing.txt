Verse  
They say they out for dead presidents never respected  
First of all Ben Franklin was never elected  
That means him and Big Bills have never connected  
They just say it cause they think it sounds clever on records  
Secondly Gods first should never be second  
And if you living wrong money can never correct it  
Imma say it once then its whoever direct it  
You never get off on me Im never the exit  
All black everything in my black V  
It aint a game and if it was itd be a black Wii  
Im on my A game never on that B shit  
You on that Bshit never gonna be shit  
Thats how I C shit cause I am D shit  
True story like that Hollywood E shit  
I say F nggas cause Im on some G shit  
Yeah that redandgreen stripe double G shit  
That was for my homie just know Im thinking of you  
I told him stay on top so they cant get above you  
He told me I dig that like a fckin shovel  
Why it take a ngga go to jail to say he love you  
We be killing them boy we be killing them  
Damn we used to dream to have a million  
Now the family get money like Will and them  
Accounts rise like we filling them with helium  
My baby girl got ass its no secret that it  
Make you look away and still be peeking at it  
She said they come with painted faces trying to clown on you  
How they under you but try to talk down on you  
You see a rat is gonna be that and go for any cheddar  
Tell my bitch that Im no good as if they any better  
But her loyalty keep her from them other boys  
Let em holla she just gonna exist above the noise
