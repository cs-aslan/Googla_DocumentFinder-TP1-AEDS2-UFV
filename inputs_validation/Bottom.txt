My compassion is broken now  
My will is eroded  
And my desire stolen and it makes me feel ugly  
Im on my knees and burning  
My piss and moans are the fuel that set my head on fire  
So smell my soul burning  
Im broken looking up to see the enemy  
I have swallowed the poison you feed me  
But I survive on it  
And it leaves me guilt fed hatred fed weakness fed  
And I feel ugly and dead inside  
Shit adds up at the bottom  
Youve left me no choice but to go inside and rebuild  
Whats broken  
Too much too far too late to lie down now  
I must arm myself to fight you  
By making weapons out of my imperfections  
Its all I have left  
Theres no other choice  
Im shameless nameless nothing and no one now  
But my soul must be iron for my fear is naked  
Im naked and fearless  
But Im dead inside  
You see shit adds up now Im dead inside  
Hatred weakness and guilt keep me alive  
At the bottom
