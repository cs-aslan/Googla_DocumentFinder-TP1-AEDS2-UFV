No more will I do all the things that Ive done  
Ill live by the nature of moon and the sun  
Ive talked to a stranger whose sould gone away  
He warned me bout danger Id been in if I stayed  
  
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind  
Shed an iron tear Im trying to find  
  
His soul had wandered through years of despair  
Eyes without expression told to beware  
For soldiers of fortune have searched low and high  
To find theyre forgotten to rest and to die  
  
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind  
Shed an iron tear Im trying to find  
  
No more will I do all the things that Ive done  
Ill live by the nature of moon and the sun  
Ive talked to a stranger whose sould gone away  
He warned me bout danger Id been in if I stayed  
  
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind  
Shed an iron tear Im trying to find  
  
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind  
Shed an iron tear Im trying to find
