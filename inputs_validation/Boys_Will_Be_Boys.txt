Chorus  
Oh boys will be boys  
Oh boys will be boys  
  
Youve got something so that incredible in my eyes  
My heart my heart is stars to bumpin whenever you around  
My whole world upside down baby  
But I try to get closer and you always push me away  
You tell me its much too soon but I just cant help it  
Ive always got to make a play  
  
Chorus  
  
All my senses going around you all the time  
And I invences Ive never going hope  
Always gotta lose control  
I hear ya saying that you think that we should wait  
And I cant hold on any more my bodys callin for ya  
So please dont hesitate  
  
Chorus  
  
Go  
  
I hear ya saying that you think that we should wait  
And I cant hold on any more my bodys callin for ya  
So please dont hesitate  
My bodys callin for ya  
So please dont hesitate  
  
Chorus
