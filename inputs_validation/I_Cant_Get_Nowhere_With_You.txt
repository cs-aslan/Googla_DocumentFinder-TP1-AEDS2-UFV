I cant get nowhere with  
I cant get nowhere with  
  
Talk to me  
Say things to me  
Make me understand you love me  
I cant get nowhere with you  
  
Im saying  
Youre playing  
With my feelings  
Im just praying  
I cant get nowhere with you  
  
I put my trust in you  
But how you let me down  
I tried to treat you right  
But you made me look like a clown  
  
Im showing  
That youre going  
Tears me up  
My tears are flowing  
I cant get nowhere with you  
  
Verse 3  
Im showing  
That youre going  
Tears me up  
My tears are flowing  
I cant get nowhere with  
I cant get nowhere with  
I cant get nowhere with you
