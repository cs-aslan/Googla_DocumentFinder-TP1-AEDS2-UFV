My problem isnt that I miss you  
Cause I dont  
My problem isnt that I kissed you  
Whoa oh  
  
I figured out  
That youre nothin that I thought youre about  
Youre just caught in a place  
Its what time will erase in my heart  
  
Youre my type of guy I guess  
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High  
For the rest of my life  
But people change thank God I did  
  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesnt mean I like you now  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesnt mean I like you  
  
Your problems not for lack of tryin  
Cause you do  
Its just that youre at your best when youre lyin  
Whoa oh  
  
Now youre standing here  
And saying things you think I wanted to hear  
But you got it all wrong  
Ive already moved on my dear  
  
Youre my type of guy I guess  
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High  
For the rest of my life  
But people change thank God I did  
  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesnt mean I like you now  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesnt mean I like you  
  
When youre standing near me  
I dont see so clearly  
The feelings are still palpable  
But when I take two steps away  
It sheds some light on my day  
  
Yeah you cant go back  
Its all in the past  
Guess you gotta laugh at it  
  
Youre my type of guy I guess  
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High  
For the rest of my life  
But people change thank God I did  
  
And if theres some confusion  
Let me tell ya youre just delusional  
Get a clue cause people change  
Thank God I did  
Thank God I did  
Thank God I did  
  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesnt mean I like you now  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesnt mean I like you  
It doesnt mean I like you  
  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesnt mean I like you now  
  
Rock and roll rock it
