Im not going to lay around and whine and moan  
Cause somebody done done me wrong  
Dont think for a minute  
That Im gonna sit around and sing some old sad song  
I believe its half full not a half empty glass  
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last  
  
I aint here for a long time  
Im here for a good time  
So bring on some sunshine to hell with the red wine  
Pour me some moonshine  
When I am gone put it in stone he left nothing behind  
I aint here for a long time  
Im here for a good time  
  
Folks are always dreaming about what they like to do  
But I like to do just what I like  
Ill take the chance dance the dance  
It might be wrong but then again it might be right  
Theres no way of knowing what tomorrow brings  
Lifes too short to waste it I say bring on anything  
  
I aint here for a long time  
Im here for a good time  
So bring on the sunshine to hell with the red wine  
Pour me some moonshine  
  
When Im gone put it in stone  
He left nothing behind  
I aint here for a long time  
Im here for a good time  
I aint here for a long time  
Im here for a good time
