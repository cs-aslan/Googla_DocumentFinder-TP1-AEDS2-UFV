Its been a blue blue day I feel like running away I feel like running away
from it all  
My love has been untrue shes found somebody new  
Its been a blue blue day for me  
I feel like crying dying what can I do  
I feel like praying saying Im glad were through  
Its been a blue blue day I feel like running away  
I feel like running away from the blues  
  
How can I make believe that I dont sit  
And grieve its been a blue blue day for me  
I cant pretend and say that I dont love her anyway its been a blue blue day
for me  
I feel like crying dying  
I feel like running away from the blues
