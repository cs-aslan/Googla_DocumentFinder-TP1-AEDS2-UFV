Jesus I know Ive neglected to do the little things the big things you wanted
me to  
Ive let you down Jesus thats not hard to see Jesus oh Jesus dont give up on
me  
Stand by me Jesus forgive me somehow if theres any hope left dont leave me
now  
I might be worth saving Im trying to be Jesus oh Jesus dont give up on me  
  
Its late I know and Ive made you wait  
But dont turn the light out dont lock the gate  
Forgiveness and patience thats all I need Jesus oh Jesus dont give up on me  
Stand by me Jesus
