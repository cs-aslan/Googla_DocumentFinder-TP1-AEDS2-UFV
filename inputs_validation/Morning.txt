Its the same old situation  
Same old faces but a different town  
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide  
Im dancing with the shadows  
In a cold moonlight  
  
And I cant wait until the morning  
I cant wait another minute hour day or night  
I cant wait until the morning  
You know it wont feel so cold  
  
Its 5 am and I just got into bed  
And the heart of the city is almost gone  
And I know what is right  
And I know what is wrong  
Im dancing with the shadows  
In a cold moonlight  
  
And I cant wait until the morning  
I cant wait another minute hour day or night  
I cant wait until the morning  
You know it feels so cold  
  
Sometimes in between my dreams at night  
I walk alone Im going underground  
And in the distance I can hear a crowd  
It makes me wonder what its all about  
All about  
All about  
  
Its the same old consolation  
Different faces in the same old town  
Nowhere to run to  
Nowhere to hide  
Theyre dancing with the shadows  
In a cold moonlight  
  
And I cant wait until the morning  
I cant wait another minute hour day or night  
I cant wait until the morning  
You know it feels so cold
