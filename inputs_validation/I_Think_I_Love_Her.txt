Gorillas in the mist pull back pump they fist  
Im from the planet of the apes King kong clips  
Slince lambs btch  
Run through your land trippin  
Cant pretend when this is real as it gets can ya  
If sht hits the fan I Ron Artest nggas  
This how Im living getting tatted in some house slippers  
I like my btches simple laid back relax its mental  
Sht you know what I do  
Tell me what you tryna get into  
The man cars rented  
The man car killing  
Gossiping fck the car look at the man in it  
Ha boys to man business  
We dont hire btches  
Just fire btches  
Its young money fire spitters  
The Is with us  
And they aint ate they dinner  
  
Beginners feast feet lying fatality finish

Uhh Weezy F baby I do it big weigh me  
Them crazy freaky btches try to cirque du soliel me  
Got some new btches trail got me laughing  
The one that gave me head can suck the nail out a casket  
Shot gun on the kitchen table  
The shells in the cabinet  
Fcking with me is like stepping on the tail of a dragon  
Where pussy is my cabin  
More bthces than a pageant

Spending time backwards  
Hotter than a cactus  
And we aint in the building we the fcking contractors  
  
Y ym why muthafck why hate it  
Young Money down your throat gotta stay hydrated  
Quarter bag weezy  
Young time brady  
Open up your mouth and catch a bomb baby  
Hehe good morning dude  
Eagle street car in tune  
Long joe no short bread no lorna doon  
Im warning you  
We on the move  
Bunch of female dogs and garden tools  
Thats btches and hoes  
Hospital full sick of my flow  
Hip hop was washed up so I bought some change to finish my load  
I load millions and more millions  
Money to the ceiling  
Ngga no ceiling  
  
Shanell  
Step up in this btch 5 o clock in the morning  
The world is waking up you can hear the pigeons yawning  
Imma get that worm now

Yo nggas need a lesson on some ethic you gon learn now  
I do this for the love of it  
Saliva cos I love to spit  
And I duke it for my future records  
You gon love to spit  
Fucking with my bredren 10 years strong  
And he put them dreds in silver john long  
But hes more like platinum  
Hold up heres a napkin  
Pick your jaw up off the floor  
And tuck your tongue right back in  
Tell me where is Mack Maine
