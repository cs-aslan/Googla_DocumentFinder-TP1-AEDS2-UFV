Look mummy theres an aeroplane up in the sky  
  
Ooooh  
Did you see the frightened ones  
Did you hear the falling bombs  
Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the  
Promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath a clear blue  
Sky  
  
Oooooh  
Did you see the frightened ones  
Did you hear the falling bombs  
The flames are all long gone but the pain lingers on  
  
Goodbye blue sky  
Goodbye blue sky  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
The 1115 from Newcastle is now approaching  
The 1118 arrival
