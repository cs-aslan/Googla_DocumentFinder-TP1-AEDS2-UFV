Well ever since the day that time began  
Theres been this thing tween a woman and a man  
Well I dont know but I do believe  
It started in the garden with Adam and Eve  
Sampson and Delilah had their fling  
Til she cut his hair and clipped his wing  
It dont matter how the storys told  
Love stays young it cant grow old  
  
Chorus  
Let me tell you about love  
About the moon and stars above  
Its what weve all been dreamin of  
Let me tell you about love  
  
Well Bonaparte and Josephine  
I believe they had a pretty good scene  
Until she said Bonnie boy were through  
Thats when he met his Waterloo  
Julie baby and Romeo  
Fell in love and stole the show  
I know they are history  
But there aint been nothin like you and me  
  
Chorus  
  
Now Sheba she was a beauty queen  
The purtiest thing that you ever have seen  
Solomon he was a mighty wise  
Sheba she done caught his eye  
The world would be in a dreadful fix  
If it wasnt for the love between the cats and chicks  
The world wouldnt amount to much  
Without a hug and a kiss and a tender touch  
  
Chorus  
  
Let me tell you about love  
Let me tell you about love  
Yeah
