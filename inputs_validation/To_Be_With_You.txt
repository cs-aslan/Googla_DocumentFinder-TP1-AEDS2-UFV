Hold on little girl  
Show me what hes done to you  
Stand up little girl  
A broken heart cant be that bad  
When its through its through  
Fate will twist the both of you  
So come on baby come on over  
Let me be the one to show you  
  
Im the one who wants to be with you  
Deep inside I hope youll feel it too  
Waited on a line of greens and blues  
Just to be the next to be with you  
  
Build up your confidence  
So you can be on top for once  
Wake up Who cares about little boys  
That talk too much  
Ive seen it all go down  
The game of love was all rained out  
Let me be the one to hold you  
  
Im the one who wants to be with you  
Deep inside I hope youll feel it too  
Waited on a line of greens and blues  
Just to be the next to be with you  
  
Why be alone when we can be together baby  
You can make my life worth while  
I can make you start to smile  
When its through its through  
And fate will twist the both of you  
Let me be the one to show you  
  
Im the one who wants to be with you  
Deep inside I hope youll feel it too  
Waited on a line of greens and blues  
Just to be the next to be with you  
Im the one who wants to be with you  
Let me be the one to show you  
  
Im the one who wants to be with you  
Deep inside I hope youll feel it too  
Waited on a line of greens and blues  
Just to be the next to be with you  
Im the one who wants to be with you  
Let me be the one to show you
