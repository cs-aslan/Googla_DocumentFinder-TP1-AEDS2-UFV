Isadora  
Dancing  
Can you see her  
Che guavara  
Marching beside her  
Valentino  
Loving every minute  
Dont you see them looking  
Looking down on you  
Pictures on the walls of your room  
Gonna help you play the parts  
Of your ever changing mood  
Lying low  
The cast is set around your bones  
When all you ever wanted to be  
Was plain mister jones  
Cell of fame  
Its gonna trap you forever  
Self confessions  
And your backs against the wall  
Idolized by the hands that hold the key  
Not even time will set you free  
When its your turn to leave  
Hung at dawn  
Then you will join up  
With the faces looking on  
Thats where you belong  
Cell of fame  
Its gonna trap you forever  
Self confessions  
And your backs against the wall
