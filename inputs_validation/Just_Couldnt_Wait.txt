I miss her face but the girl left seven years ago  
Guess I never shouldve let her go  
Thats how I feel because I love her so  
But Im afraid that she will never know  
  
She just couldnt wait she said she couldnt wait til some day  
She just couldnt wait my baby just couldnt wait no  
She said she couldnt wait til some day til some day  
  
Oh tell me now where do the brokenhearted go from here  
You missed her love and now youre steering clear  
I aint afraid of nothin but my fear  
The fear that she might see this rollin tear  
  
She just couldnt wait she said she couldnt wait til sunday  
She just couldnt wait my baby just couldnt wait no  
She just couldnt wait my baby just couldnt wait no  
  
Oh she couldnt wait til Sunday no til sunday  
She just couldnt wait my baby just couldnt wait no  
She said she couldnt wait til sunday  
She just couldnt wait my baby just couldnt wait no  
She said she just couldnt wait  
You know she just couldnt wait no  
She said she couldnt wait til Sunday til sunday  
Oh oh
