Please forgive this platitude  
But I like your attitude  
You are just the kind Ive had in mind  
Never could find  
  
Honey Im so keen on you  
I could come to lean on you  
On a random bay give you your way  
Do what you say  
  
Gee its all fine and dandy  
Sugar candy when Ive got you  
  
Then I only see the sunny side  
Even trouble has its funny side  
When youre gone my sugar candy  
I get so lonesome I get blue  
  
But when youre handy  
Its fine and dandy  
But when youre gone  
What can I do
