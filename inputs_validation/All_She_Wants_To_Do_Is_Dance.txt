Theyre pickin up the prisoners  
And puttin em in a pen  
And all she wants to do is dance dance  
Rebels been rebels  
Since I dont know when  
And all she wants to do is dance  
  
Molotov cocktail the local drink  
And all she wants to do is dance dance  
They mix em up right  
In the kitchen sink  
And all she wants to do is dance  
  
Crazy people walkin round with blood in their eyes  
And all she wants to do is dance dance dance  
Wildeyed pistols wavers who aint afraid to die  
And all she wants to do is dance  
  
And make romance  
She cant feel the heat  
Comin off the street  
She wants to party  
She wants to get down  
All she wants to do is  
All she wants to do is dance  
  
Well the government bugged the mens room  
In the local disco lounge  
And all she wants to do is dance dance  
To keep the boys from sellin  
All the weapons they could scrounge  
And all she wants to do is dance  
  
But that dont keep the boys from makin a buck or two  
And all she wants to do is dance dance  
The still can sell the army  
All the drugs that they can do  
And all she wants to do is  
All she wants to do is dance  
And make romance  
  
Well we barely make the airport  
For the last plane out  
As we taxied down the runway  
I could hear the people shout  
They said dont come back here Yankee  
But if I ever do  
Ill bring more money  
Cause all she wants to do is dance  
And make romance  
Never mind the heat  
Comin off the street  
She wants to party  
She wants to get down  
All she wants to do is  
All she wants to do is dance  
And make romance  
All she wants to do is dance
