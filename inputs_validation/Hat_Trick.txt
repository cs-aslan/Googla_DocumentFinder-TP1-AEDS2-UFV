You can I make it known  
Id like to take you home  
You been away so long  
Id like to see you  
  
But when I saw you at the local hop  
I tried to take you but you made me stop  
Then I saw that you were dancing with a rentacop  
Whoa whoa  
  
The minute you pulled me through  
You thought that then you knew  
If not today Id find a way  
To get to you  
  
Just a little of nothin  
Thats all you had the time to give  
Just a little of nothin  
Aint gonna make it worthwhile for me  
  
If youd only have listened  
Youd have heard every word I said  
Just a little of nothin  
Aint gonna make it worthwhile for me  
  
Just a little of nothin just a little of nothin Repeat x4  
  
Newtonunderroseberry topping  
And its cold and its wet  
And you feel like youre part of all time  
  
Living in the gap between the echoes  
Feeling it hot  
And feeling it cold  
  
As long as there are fish in the sea  
Have a cup of tea  
Oh as long as there are fish in the sea  
Have a cup of tea  
  
cause you are running from the ring of the golden bell  
Like a bat out of hell  
You are running from the ring of the golden bell  
Like a bat out of hell  
You are running from the ring of the golden bell  
Like a bat out of hell  
You are running from the ring of the golden bell  
Like a bat out of hell  
  
Theres a lady across the hall  
Shes telling me its all right all right  
Im tryin to give her my all  
Shes sayin Im uptight  
Hell of a way to spend an afternoon  
  
Saw a movie tonight  
Got frightened and broke down broke down  
Got a call in the night  
My old lady just hit town  
Take her away shes tryin to turn me round  
Im nowhere to be found  
  
I cant unread the pages Ive already read  
And I cant feed these ages left in my head  
Theyre already dead yeah
