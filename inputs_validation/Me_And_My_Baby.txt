Roxie  
Look at my baby my baby and me  
  
Me and my baby  
My baby and me  
Were bout as happy as babies can be  
What if I find  
That Im causght in a storm  
I dont care  
My babys there  
And babys bound to keep me warm  
Were sticking together  
And aint we got fun  
So much together  
Youd count us as one  
Tell old man worry to go climb a tree  
cause Ive got my baby  
Im with my baby  
Look at my baby and me  
  
Looka my baby  
My baby and me  
A dream of a duo  
Now dont you agree  
Why keep it mum  
When theres nothing to hid  
And what I feel  
I must reveal  
Its more that I can keep inside  
And I can assure you  
It wont go away  
Let me assur you  
It grow every day  
I was a one once  
But now I a we  
cause I got my baby  
My dear little baby  
Looka my baby and me  
  
Roxie and boys  
Looka my baby  
My baby and me  
Facing the world  
Optimistically  
Nothing can stop us  
So nobody try  
cause babys rough  
And full of stuff  
And incidentally so am I  
Get out of our way folks  
And give us some room  
Watch how we bubble  
And blossom and bloom  
Life was a prison  
But we got the key  
Me and my baby  
My dear little baby  
My cute little baby  
My sweet little baby  
My fat little baby  
My soft little baby  
My pink little baby  
My bald little baby  
Looka my baby  
  
Roxie  
And me
