Youre sharp as a knife and you fit like a glove  
That is no way to live that is no way to love  
Full of fear in your skin and the weakness in giving in  
Your stabbed in the back but you feel no pain  
Push the heaviest doors that you cant open  
Yeah they tied me up and my body lies still again  
  
Youre as bright as the sun and as calm as the wind  
I dont know when youll break but its gonna be soon  
If my will caves in Ill be in the same boat as you  
  
Ive got the salt skin  
Running to where he is  
Never going to give in  
Even with the strength  
Hes stealing salt skin  
Telling me Im winning  
Wars they created  
Just to understand  
The meaning of  
  
Hands on strings and my mouth open  
Find the perfect words that Ive not spoken  
And I wont tell the truth unless you want me to  
  
For all of the times that I lost my head  
When it rolled to the floor and I found it again  
But when it came back  
I didnt know my own name  
  
Ive got the salt skin  
Running to where he is  
Never going to give in  
Even with the strength  
Hes stealing salt skin  
Telling me Im winning  
Wars they created  
Just to understand  
The meaning of
