This relationship is over  
Though my stomach still hurts  
And now Im gonna live alone  
Why is the pain much worse  
Youre so much better without makeup  
Why would you hide your face  
Dont want to spend the night and wake up  
Realize Ive made a big mistake  
  
Chorus  
I can not refuse your eyes  
Please dont look at me tonight  
My heart beats fast I know youre there  
And I pretend like I dont care  
It hurts so bad to know the truth  
But I am still in love with you  
  
I never meant to keep you waiting  
And now your food is getting cold  
I keep denying Im in love with you  
My routine is getting old  
And now you stand in front of the table  
And say you never look back  
Your super stupid when youre angry  
You only wake up sad  
  
Chorus  
  
It hurts too much to know the truth  
But I am still in love with you  
  
No more kisses on your lips tender touch oh please  
Id rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees  
And youre the girl to get me over what we start to be  
And I just cant get over you and until youre over me  
  
I can not refuse your eyes  
Please dont look at me tonight  
My heart beats fast I know youre there  
And I pretend like I dont care  
  
Chorus  
  
It hurts too much to know the truth  
But I am still in love with you
