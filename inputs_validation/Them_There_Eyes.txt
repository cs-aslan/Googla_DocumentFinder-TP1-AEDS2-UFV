I was just minding my business  
Life was a beautiful song  
Didnt have a care nor worry  
Then you had to come along  
I fell in love with you first time  
I looked into them there eyes  
Youve got a certain lil cute way of flirtin  
With them there eyes  
They make me feel happy they make me blue  
No stallin  
Im fallin  
Going in a big way for sweet little you  
My heart is jumpin  
You sure started somethin  
With them there eyes  
Youd better watch them if youre wise  
They sparkle they bubble  
Theyre gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble  
Youre overworkin em  
Theres danger lurkin in  
Them there eyes  
Maybe you think Im just flirtin  
Maybe you think Im all lies  
Just because I get romantic when I gaze in  
Them there eyes  
I fell in love with you first time  
I looked into them there eyes  
Youve got a certain lil cute way of flirtin  
With them there eyes  
They make me feel happy they make me blue  
No stallin  
Im fallin  
Going in a big way for sweet little you  
My heart is jumpin  
You sure started somethin  
With them there eyes  
Youd better watch them if youre wise  
They sparkle  
They bubble  
Theyre gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble  
Youre overworkin em  
Theres danger lurkin in  
Them there eyes
