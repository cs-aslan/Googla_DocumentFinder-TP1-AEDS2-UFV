Imma thug  
Even though I wan change my life then get it right  
City judge Im always gonna be a thug  
Like hold on many of society that wanna see me underground  
But I just bought a plane  
Sky is the limit sky  
My judge just took off the round now  
Aint nobody gonna stop my destiny destiny  
Ladies like pop a bottle now its gucci  
Cause their man just came home now  
Doing time in the penitentiary  
Gucci yeah  
And if come from the ghetto and you feel like a champion  
Lemme see you put your hands up  
Gucci put your hands up
