Here I sit drivin nails in the wall thinking I hear someone in my hall  
She said that shed be back in no time at all here I sit drivin nails in the
wall  
In the dark that stacks around me dreams of you keep pounding me  
Leading me to where Ive never been  
And the voice keeps telling me this could be insanity but I know my name as
well as you  
Here I sit drivin nails in the wall  
In the wilted patterns of my mind find that Ive left you behind  
Sowing up my torn memories  
Surviving living three bed room electric kitchen and living room  
Just burning and its on a new free way  
Here I sit drivin nails in the wall thinking I hear someone in my hall  
She said that shed be back in no time at all  
When she is back Im gonna nail to the wall
