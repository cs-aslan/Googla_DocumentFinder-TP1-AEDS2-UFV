Like everyone she knows shes holding out for true love  
Waiting on an answer ready for a change  
And everywhere she goes shes just a little bit on the lookout  
A day might mean tomorrow questions still remain  
Its not that shes so sad she always was a happy soul  
But lately she gets to wonder to herself whats the good of going on anymore  
  
I see her in her room sitting at the window  
Wondering if shes pretty feeling just a little small tonight  
She thinks of going home giving up on the city  
Maybe moving back down to Mobile its not that far to fall  
I know she wont see me but I might just say anyhow  
If I could be right there right now as I myself was told  
  
Hold tight to your hearts desire never ever let it go  
Let nobody fool you into giving it up too soon  
Tend your own fire lay low and be strong wait awhile wait it out  
Wait it on out wait it out itll come along  
  
I know she wont see me but I might just say anyhow  
If I could be right there right now as I myself was told  
  
Hold tight to your hearts desire never ever let it go  
Let nobody fool you into giving it up too soon  
Tend your own fire lay low and be strong  
Wait it out wait it out wait it on out  
Wait it out let it come along oh wait awhile wait awhile
