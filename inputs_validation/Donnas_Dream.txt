Dream Donna dream  
Dream Donna dream  
  
In a sleepy little border town  
Lives the cutest girl  
For miles around  
Never dreamed of things  
Like wealth and fame  
Oh Donna is her name  
  
Every night when shes fast asleep  
Donna always dreams a dream of me  
I know all her little plans and schemes  
Im the boy in Donna dream  
  
Every night  
When the moon is bright  
I meet my Donna  
And I hold her tight  
Her angel eyes  
And her golden hair  
When Donna needs a dream lover  
Ill be there  
  
When she wakes up  
And Im all alone  
I lose my Donna  
With every dawn  
Ill be with her  
Once again you see  
When my Donna dreams of me  
  
She gonna meet me  
Someday for sure  
I may even be the boy next door  
And if she finds me  
Shes gonna to know  
That Im her dream lover  
And I need her so  
  
But until I am reality  
I know my Donnas  
Gonna dream of me  
I know all her little plans and schemes  
Im the boy in Donnas dream  
  
Dream Donna dream  
Dream Donna dream
