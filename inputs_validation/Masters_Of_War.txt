Come you masters of war  
You that build all the guns  
You that build the death planes  
You that build all the bombs  
You that hide behind walls  
You that hide behind desks  
We just want you to know we can see through your masks  
You that never done nothing  
But build and destroy  
You play with our world  
Like its your little toy  
You put a gun in my head  
And then you hide from my eyes  
Then you turn and run following the fast foolish line  
Like Judas of old  
You lie and deceive  
A world war can be won  
You wont need to believe  
But I see through your eye  
And I see through your brain  
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain  
You that fasten all the trigger  
For the others to fire  
And you sit back and watch  
While the death toll gets higher  
You hide in your mansion  
While young peoples blood  
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud  
Youve thrown the worst fear  
That could ever be hurled  
The fear to bring children  
Into this world  
For threatening my baby  
Unborn and unnamed  
You aint worth the blood that runs through your veins  
How much do we know  
To talk out of turn  
You might say that were young  
You might say were unlearned  
But theres one thing I know  
Though Im younger than you  
Even Jesus would never forgive what you do  
Let me ask you one question  
Is your money that good  
Will it buy you forgiveness  
Do you think that it would  
Oh I think you will find  
When your death takes its toll  
All the money you made will never buy back your soul  
And I hope that you die  
And your death will come soon  
Ill stand on your Incomprehensible  
In the pale afternoon  
And Ill watch while youre lowered  
Into your deathbed  
And Ill stand on your grave till Im sure that youre dead
