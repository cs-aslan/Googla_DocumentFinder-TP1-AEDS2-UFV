Genevieve Genevieve  
I went down to some backroom joint  
Where I spent the night before  
Looking for the girl I love  
She left and wrote her name on my door  
Shes got a guilty conscience of her own  
Ive got to find out why she keeps running on  
Why she keeps running on  
Nobody gonna steal that woman nobody for sure  
Genevieve I got to find you woman tonight  
  
Deep in shadows of a neonlit street  
You know she gave me the slip  
I would love her every day  
But shes quicksilver in my grip  
Little darlin you move too fast  
Youre here one minute and youre gone in a flash  
Gone in a flash  
Nobody gonna steal that woman nobody for sure  
I got to find you  
Genevieve Im gonna find you tonight  
  
Genevieve why did you leave  
Genevieve why did you leave  
  
Dont you feel guilty loving two men  
Well Im the one to stand by your side  
Oh baby yes I love you so  
But do you listen to his lies  
Make up your mind whos your loving for  
Youre in the middle of a battle with the man at war  
Man at war  
Nobody gonna steal that woman nobody for sure  
  
Genevieve I got to find you woman tonight  
Genevieve Im gonna find you tonight repeat  
  
Genevieve
