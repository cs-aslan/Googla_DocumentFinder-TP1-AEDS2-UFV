Ive got a sayin in my life thats got me by so far  
Well it mat not be right but nobodys gonna tell me Im wrong  
The first mistake is leave it up to somebody else  
If you want somethin done you got to do it yourself  
Ill do it myself before somebody makes a fool out of me  
  
Chorus  
cause nothin comes easy for a man like me  
Everybody thinks the best things in life are free  
If they would open their eyes itd be so plain to see  
That the best things in life dont come so easily  
  
I met a man who thought just a little bit different from me  
He said you got it so easy but I just had to disagree  
It would have been alright but he pushed me too far  
If your lookin for trouble step outside of this bar  
If it comes down to fistin mister that aint nothin new to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Youll find in this life if theres somethin that you believe  
You got to get your hands dirty when its somethin that you really need  
If they ever give you somethin too easily  
Cant be too good cause nothin goods for free  
Tell ya straight from the heart a bed of roses it will never be
