If you can name that object

You cant stop the mold from growin  
Livin in the fridge

Tell me do you think it should be carbondated  
Fumigated or cremated and buried at sea  
You try to save a little bit of your home cookin  
Couple weeks later got a scarylookin specimen  
It always happens my friend  
Again and again and again and again
