By the side of the tracks where the train goes by  
The wind and the rain will catch you you will sigh  
Deep in your heart  
Then youll come arunning to me  
Youll come arunning to me  
Well you watch the train go round the bend  
Play in dust and dream that it will never end  
Deep in your heart  
Youll come arunning to me  
Youll come arunning to me  
Said hey come arunning to me  
Oh come arunning to me  
Yeah come arunning to me  
Said hey come arunning to me  
Oh come arunning to me  
Hey yeah come arunning to me  
With your hound dog by your side  
And your arms stretched out open wide  
I want to keep you satisfied in the morning sun  
By my side come on come on run  
And you kick the sand up with your heels  
You think to yourself how good it feels  
Put away all your walking shoes  
Then you come running to me  
Now you come running to me  
I said hey come arunning to me  
Oh come arunning to me  
Hey yeah come arunning to me  
You gotta rainbow if you run to me
