I remember it was late one night  
In the middle of a dream  
Woke up in a pool of sweat  
Thought I heard a scream  
Ran over to the window sill  
Stuck my head out for a peek  
Dressed in black was a man I didnt recognise  
Running down my back street  
My heart skipped a beat  
  
Chorus x2  
You better watch out theres a stranger in town  
You better watch out when he comes around  
Dont make a sound  
  
The morning paper and the headlines readDanger to the queen  
Buckingham Palace better tighten things up  
The son of a bitch is mean  
Vendors on the corner just doin their job  
Acting like nothings new  
Scotland Yards still looking for him  
But he doesnt leave  
A single clue  
  
Chorus x2  
  
You better watch out  
  
Whos this man who fell out of the sky  
Whats he done and wheres he live  
How can a man whos a criminal be a hero to the kids  
The old couple swear that the Ripers back  
They say its him all right  
The young girl says its Jesus and he wont be back again  
Tonight  
I wonder whos right   
  
Chorus  
  
You better watch out
