Come and get it Woo  
We got some fresh fills for your fat chickenass to snack on bitch  
So here start with a slice of this fresh piggy pie motherfucker  
  
The first little piggy his house is made of wood  
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood  
He likes to fuck his sister and drink his moonshine  
A typical redneck filthy fuckin swine  
I rode into town with my axe in my holster  
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy roaster  
A farmer at the border he tried to take me out  
I drew my ax with the quickness and cut his chicken feathers out  
Walked in the village and to the piggys place  
He opened up his door and popped me in the face  
And blew me off the porch and cracked my head in half  
But Im a Juggalo so it only made me laugh he he  
Forty in hand I rose from the dead  
And threw with all my might I made a ping noise off his head  
Since we out west I had a little fun  
And pulled his fuckin tongue out the back of his cranium  
  
Chorus  
Three little piggies to make a piggy pie  
Theres nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die  
I might use a gun no I might use an ax yes  
The carnivals in town come and get your piggy snacks  
  
The second little piggy his house is made of brick  
And this little piggy is a motherfucking dick  
He sits on his bench and gets all the respect  
But if I get a chance Im goin straight for the neck  
He walked in the room and everybody rose  
Lopped off bucket chillin underneath my clothes  
First they let the piggy now you can finally sit  
But what this piggy dont know is hes about to get his neck wet  
Now I see the bailiff Im thinkin what the fuck  
I can smoke this room before his hearing aid will pick it up  
Oldass man I let him get away  
That tired motherfucker will probably die tomorrow anyway  
Here come the piggy its time for my case  
His eyes are blood red with a wicked lookin face  
He saw my jokers smile and sentenced me to die  
So I ragged on the bucket made it fuckin rain pork rinds  
  
Chorus x2  
  
The last little piggy his house is made of gold  
He lives in a mansion on his own private road  
I started walking down it the guard he told me wait  
I bounced off his head and did a Jackie Chan over the gate  
Cause this little piggy must definitely fry  
Im a lop his nugget off and toss it in the sky  
And then I watch the moon take the form of the devil  
And pull it out the sky and beat it with a shovel  
People in my city they fightin for they meals  
He sleeps on a mattress stuffed with hundred dollar bills  
How rich he is the devil he never will admit it  
So Im a take his money stack and stuff his face with it  
Opened up his door hes sleeping in his bed  
I grabbed a brick of gold and laid it upside his head  
He begged for his life I told him its too late  
And took away his dough and watched the devil suffocate  
Cause I need  
  
Chorus x4
