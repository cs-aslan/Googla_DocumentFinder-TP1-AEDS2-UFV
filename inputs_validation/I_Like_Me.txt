Chorus  
I like me  
Yo you like  
Cause I like me  
Do you like me  
See I like me  
Cause he like me  
God likes me  
You you dont like me  
You you dont like me  
  
Short big nose big lips  
Kinda st st stutter but I never trip  
Got my daddys swagger and I walk with a limp  
Got a hot wife no need to be a pimp  
Never been cute never been fly  
Since I been changed got that twinkle in my eye  
Got my grill fixed now I smile when I speak  
Tell me who that is thats the Jesus freak its ya boy  
  
Chorus  
  
I just smile Im so content  
And I aint even got yellow stones on my wrist  
I hear the world Im supposed to be rich  
Bud I dont but that man I dont go with the trends  
Go the whole mile lose or win  
I hope thats the impression that the Cds give  
Im more concerned about how they see me live  
Than trying to get a house on MTV cribs  
  
Chorus  
  
When the light fade I know that you see  
More than my swagger But its you in me  
From the storefront church to the packed out floors  
They want an autograph but Id rather give em yours  
Ya ink dont fade the crowd wants more  
The kings on stage the final encore  
Cant believe its me now Im chillin backstage  
Big nose big lips gon get ya hands raised  
  
I like me  
Yo you like  
Cause I like me  
Do you like me  
See I like me  
Cause he like me  
God likes me
