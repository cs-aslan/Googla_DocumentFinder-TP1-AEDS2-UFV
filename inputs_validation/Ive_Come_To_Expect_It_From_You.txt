So upset  
Nervous wreck  
I cant believe you said goodbye  
  
Sit and smoke  
Cry and joke  
About these tears in my eyes  
  
How could you do what youve gone and done to me  
I wouldnt treat a dog the way you treated me  
But thats what I get  
Ive come to expect it from you  
  
A million times  
A million lines  
And Ive bought em every one  
  
You dont care  
You rip and tear  
Every dream Ive counted on  
  
I guess that I should thank my unlucky stars  
That Im alive and youre the way you are  
But thats what I get  
Ive come to expect it from you  
  
How could you do what youve gone and done to me  
I wouldnt treat a dog the way you treated me  
But thats what I get  
Ive come to expect it from you  
  
I could raise hell  
But what the hell  
It wouldnt do a bit a good  
  
Pack and leave  
My heart agrees  
It seems to think that I should  
  
There wont be no more next time doing me wrong  
Youll come back this time to find out that Im gone  
But thats what you get  
You should expect that from me  
  
Thats what I get  
Ive come to expect it from you
