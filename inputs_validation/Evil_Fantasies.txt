We turn and face each other  
My fingers pull your hair  
You wince and jerk my wrist off  
I bite my lip and stare  
Your stance at once defiant  
Im rigid to your pose  
You clench your teeth in anger  
My loving swells and grows  
  
You give me evil fantasies  
I wanna get inside your mind  
Come on and live my fantasies  
Ill show you evil you cant hide  
  
Youre dragged into my vision  
Trapped serving to my need  
Maybe imagination  
Is where my dark side feeds  
You slide your nails down in me  
I raise my structure high  
You pout I snarl you whimper  
And wave compassion by  
  
You give me evil fantasies  
I wanna get inside your mind  
Come on and live my fantasies  
Ill show you evil you cant hide  
  
Gonna take you gotta get through  
Gonna make you do what I want  
  
Youre dragged into my vision  
Trapped serving to my need  
Maybe imagination  
Is where my dark side feeds
