Heading out this morning into the sun  
Riding on the diamond waves little darlin one  
Warm wind caress her  
Her lover it seems  
Oh Annie  
Dreamboat Annie my little ship of dreams  
Going down the city sidewalk alone in the crowd  
No one knows the lonely one whose heads in the clouds  
Sad faces painted over with those magazine smiles  
Heading out to somewhere wont be back for a while
