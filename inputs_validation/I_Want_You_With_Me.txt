When Im walking down the street  
On a quite afternoon  
When I hear our favorite song  
and it gets me in the mood  
When I dont know who I am  
and the world is not my friend  
When I fight my way back up again  
  
Chorus  
I want you with me every move I make  
I want you to see all that I see  
Through the laughter and the madness  
and every moment in between  
Oh I want you with me  
  
When I tell my daddy bye  
for the very last time  
When I learn a whole new love  
in our babys first cry  
When you can tell Ive done it all  
  
by the lines on my face  
When I start regretting my mistakes  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I want you with me  
Oh oh yeah  
I want you with me
