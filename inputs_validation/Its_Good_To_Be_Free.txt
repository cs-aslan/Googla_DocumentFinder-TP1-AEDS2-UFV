Head like a rock spinning round and round  
I found it in a hole sitting upside down  
You point the finger at me but I dont believe  
Paint me a wish on a velvet sky  
You demand the answers but dont know why  
In my mind there is no time  
  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
All I want to do is live by the sea  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
But its good yes its good its good to be free  
  
So what would you say if I said to you  
Its not in what you say its in what you do  
You point the finger at me but I dont believe  
Bring it on home to where we found  
Head is like a rock sitting upside down  
In my mind there is no time  
  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
All I want to do is live by the sea  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
But its good yes its good its good to be free  
Yeah its good yes its good its good to be free
