Verse 1  
Hey whats up its been a while  
Talking bout its not my style  
Thought Id see whats up while Im lighting up  
Its coldhearted coldhearted

Saw your face and got inspired  
Guess you let it go now youre good to go  
Its coldhearted coldhearted

He dont know your body  
He dont do you right  
He wont love you like I would  
Love you like I would
