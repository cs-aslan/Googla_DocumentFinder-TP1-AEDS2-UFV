Now is the hour  
When we must say goodbye  
Soon youll be sailing  
Far across the sea  
  
While youre away  
Oh then remember me  
When you return  
Youll find me waiting here  
  
Sunset glow fades in the west  
Night oer the valley is creeping  
Birds cuddle down in their nest  
Soon all the world will be sleeping  
  
Now is the hour  
When we must goodbye  
Soon youll be sailing  
Far across the sea  
  
While youre away  
Oh then remember me  
When you return  
Youll find me waiting here
