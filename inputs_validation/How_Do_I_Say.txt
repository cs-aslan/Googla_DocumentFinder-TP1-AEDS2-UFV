Oh why  
Oh why  
Oh why  
  
A foreign beauty so exotic  
When she smiled at me  
She took my breath away  
Shes reminiscent of a goddess  
Its a shame that we could not communicate  
How do I say  
  
How do I say hello  
I just wanna talk to you  
How do I say youre beautiful  
When I cant take my eyes off you  
I dont wanna say the wrong thing  
I want just the right words to impress you  
Mujer bonita how do I say how do I say  
  
How do I say  
The room was filled with a sweet arom  
When she danced her hips moved oh so sensuous  
She speaks with her body so united  
In the language that I will never forget  
  
I hear her calling  
Spinning around in the crowd cause she found me  
And when she started moving closer and closer  
Does she know that i want her I want her  
I wanna be with her tonight  
So I caressed her face kissed her lips  
In my life Ive never felt like this  
Ive never had a lost for words  
One kiss from her has got me feenin  
  
How do I say hello  
I just wanna talk to you  
How do I say youre beautiful  
When I cant take my eyes off you  
I dont wanna say the wrong thing  
I want just the right words to impress you

How do I say youre beautiful  
When I cant take my eyes off you  
I dont wanna say the wrong thing  
I want just the right words to impress you
