If you got leavin on your mind  
Tell me now get it over  
Hurt me now get it over  
If you got leavin on your mind  
  
If theres a new love in your heart  
Tell me now get it over  
Hurt me now get it over  
If theres a new love in your heart  
  
Dont leave me here in a world  
Filled with dreams that might have been  
Hurt me now get it over  
I may learn to love again  
  
If theres a new love in your heart  
Tell me now get it over  
Hurt me now get it over  
If theres a new love in your heart  
  
Hurt me now get it over  
If theres a new love in your heart
