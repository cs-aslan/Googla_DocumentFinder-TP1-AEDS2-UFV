Waiting up all night  
Theres something on my mind  
I need to tell you why  
Hes playing you for a fool  
Hes fooling round on you  
And I just lost my cool  
Feeling so sad  
Too bad for the running man  
Cause he waits too long so he cant  
Come back again  
Too bad for the running man  
Cause Im rright here waiting to make  
That girl forget  
Too bad for the running man goodbye  
Life isnt what it seems  
Or something in a dream  
Thats not quite what I mean  
I need to say goodbye  
You think I didnt try  
Im not that other guy  
Im feeling so sad  
Too bad for the running man  
Cuase he waits too long so he cant  
Come back again  
Too bad for the running man  
Cause Im right here waiting to help  
That girl forget  
Too bad for the running man goodbye  
Too bad for the running man  
Cause he waits too long so he cant  
Come back again  
Too bad for hte running man  
Cause Im right here waiting to help  
That girl forget  
Too bad for the running man goodbye  
Its too bad for the running man  
Its too bad for the running man  
Its too bad for the running man  
Its too bad  
Its too bad  
Its too bad for the running man  
Its too bad for the running man  
Its too bad for the running man  
Its too bad  
Its too bad
