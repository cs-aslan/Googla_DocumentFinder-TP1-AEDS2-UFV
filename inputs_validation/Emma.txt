Emma stood in front of me  
Tellin me what Im supposed to be  
Jackie loves to run and hide  
Give her love and she will die  
  
Calling me oh my oh my  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
Bourbon streets and bicycles  
Holding you in carnivals  
  
Baby is my love too old for you  
Baby is my love too old for you  
Cause Emma Im for you  
Emma Im for you  
  
Dinner bells and loaded gun  
Innocence is bound to run  
Enemies are playing from  
But dont you touch that golden sun  
  
Innoncence and sentiment  
Is owned by hope its where youre at  
Baby is my love too old for you  
Emma Im for you  
Emma Im for you  
  
Hell and silence I can fight it I can fight it  
Hell and silence I can fight it I can fight it  
Hell and silence I can fight it I can fight it  
Hell and silence I can fight it I can fight it  
  
Hell and silence I can fight it I can fight it  
Hell and silence I can fight it I can fight it  
Hell and silence I can fight it I can fight it  
Hell and silence Emma Im for you  
  
Emma Im for you  
Emma Im for you you you you  
Emma Im for you you you you  
Emma Im for you  
Emma Im for you  
Emma Im for you  
Emma Im for you  
Emma Im for you
