I tell ya brother man shit happens  
By the way howzit with you  
Check out the kid finger on the button  
Oh yeah its a wonderful world huh  
  
Got no desire uh to desire  
Hey Jack aint that a trip  
And you Madam standing here for hire  
Oh yeah wheres your wonderful world  
  
Refrain  
Ill be leaving in the morning  
Far away from you  
yes Im taking that step  
Im gonna jump inthe blue  
Fallingending my depression  
Its calling oh my obsession  
  
There might be days when I think its better  
Hey Babe like you to want me to be  
Pull the chain down goes the water  
Oh yeah its a wonderful world

Agiant step in the blue

Falling ending my depression  
Its coming I can feel the vibration  
Falling ending my depression  
Its calling give me wings  
Give me the liberation

A final jump in the blue  
Oh no oh no  
A giant step in the blue  
Oh no oh no  
A final jump in the blue
