Lookin down the wrong end of a gun  
Im makin tracks for Jersey before Im wasted by the sun  
A simple man in a complex world got the means  
But the know how escapes me  
  
Opposite sides of the same fence  
Not far apart but still  
I dont like you  
Supersonic hate  
  
Bang bang bang bang bangin on yer skull  
Eatin everything is sight but still I dont seem full  
Complex man in a simple world got the means  
Got the know how to rape me  
  
In the park sharin the same bench  
Not far apart but still  
I could never love you  
Supersonic hate  
  
Here we go  
  
Here we go Sonic in the hate age  
Here we go  
  
Talkin talkin talkin till youre blue  
Screamin supersonic hate Ill get over you  
Opposite sides of the same fence  
Not far apart you know that I hate you  
Supersonic hate  
Hate
