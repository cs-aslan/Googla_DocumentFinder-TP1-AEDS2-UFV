Twelve men broke loose in seventythree  
From Mill haven maximum security  
Twelve pictures lined up across the front page  
Seems the Mounties had a summertime war to wage  
The chief told the people they had nothing to fear  
Said The last thing they wanna do is hang around here  
They mostly came from towns with long French names  
But one of the dozen was a hometown shame  
Same pattern on the table same clock on the wall  
Been one seat empty eighteen years in all  
Freezing slow time away from the world  
Hes thirtyeight years old never kissed a girl  
Hes thirtyeight years old never kissed a girl  
We were sitting around the table heard the telephone ring  
Father said hed tell em if he saw anything  
Heard the tap on my window in the middle of the night  
Held back the curtains for my older brother Mike  
See my sister got raped so a man got killed  
Local boy went to prison mans buried on the hill  
Folks went back to normal when they closed the case  
But they still stare at their shoes when they pass our place  
My mother cried The horror has finally ceased  
He whispered Yeah for the time being at least  
Over her shoulder on the squad car megaphone  
Said Lets go Michael son were taking you home  
Same pattern on the table same clock on the wall  
Been one seat empty eighteen years in all  
Freezing slow time away from the world  
Hes thirtyeight years old never kissed a girl  
Hes thirtyeight years old never kissed a girl  
Hes thirtyeight years old never kissed a girl
