Five gears in reverse  
For girls looking at the big lift  
Somebody send out for the night nurse  
Please dont stick me on the late shift  
If you dont know by now  
Nobodys gonna tell you  
If you dont know by now  
The shock will probably kill you  
  
But if your patience is corrupted and you still cannot decide  
Youre sitting in the garage contemplating suicide  
And you have no motivation you cant even catch your breath  
All of this acceleration is driving you to death  
  
Five gears in reverse  
You think I dont know what Im doing  
Another fashionable first  
Like walking down the road to ruin  
But if youre safe and sound  
Dont let me interrupt you  
And if youre gagged and bound  
Well how can I corrupt you  
  
Chorus
