Verse  
You have given me everything I needed  
According to your riches  
And the plans set for my life  
They are for blessings not for curses  
So Ill render unto You  
All of the glory You are due  
  
Chorus 2x  
Oh I cant hold it  
You dont know how  
Much the Lord has  
Done for me  
  
Verse 2 Unison  
Even when Im faithless  
Lord You are faithful  
For in the time of distress  
Youll hide me in Your tabernacle  
If these would hold their peace  
Then the rocks would cry out for me
