Sometimes when Im walking  
I dream Im being taken for granted  
Its then that I clearly imagine  
The Day That You Take Me For Granted  
  
You said one day youre gonna realize  
You really have no sense of yourself  
And with no way to take it back  
Youll get frozen in your tracks  
Frozen in your tracks  
  
Sometimes when were talking  
I feel like youre not even listening  
Its then that I clearly remember  
Rarely ever seeing you listening  
  
You said when you gonna realize  
You really have no sense of yourself  
Theres no way to take it back  
Youve been frozen in your tracks  
  
Simpler than the rest you dont do stupid games  
Youre not more complex you dont lay violent blame  
  
Tonight I was walking tonight I was walking  
Feeling alone on this planet feeling alone on this planet  
When all at once something stopped me when all at once something stopped me  
I realized Id taken you for granted I realized Id taken you for granted  
  
And tonight I realized  
I really have no sense of myself  
No way to take it back  
I am frozen in my tracks  
Im frozen in my tracks  
Frozen in my tracks
