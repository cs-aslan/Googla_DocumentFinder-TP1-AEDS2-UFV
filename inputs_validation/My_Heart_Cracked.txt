Youre spreadin lies all over town about the way you brushed me off and put me  
Down Im her to say make no mistake my heart cracked but it did not break I  
Cant deny the hurt was deep the way you slammed that door and walked right
out  
On me but Im telling you get one thing straight my heart cracked but it did
not  
Break shatterd dreams lay every where broken promises are all we share I  
Finally took all I could take my heart cacked but it did not break well I was  
Blue but for long cause this brand new love I got has made me strong and Im  
Over you and all the ache my heart cracked but it did not break shattered  
Dreams lay everywhere broken promises are all we share I finally took all I  
Could take mty heart cracked but it did not break
