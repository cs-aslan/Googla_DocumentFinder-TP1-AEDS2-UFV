Well Im a honky tonk man and I cant seem to stop  
Yeah I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old jukebox  
But when my moneys all gone Im on the telephone  
A hollerin hey hey mama can your daddy come home  
  
It takes a purty little gal and a jug of wine  
Thats what it takes to make a honky tonk mind  
With the jukebox a moanin honky tonk sound  
Thats when I want to lay my money down  
Cause Im a honky tonk man  
  
Well Im living fast and dangerously but Ive got plenty of company  
When the moon comes up and the sun goes down  
Thats when I want to see the lights of town  
Cause Im a honky tonk man
