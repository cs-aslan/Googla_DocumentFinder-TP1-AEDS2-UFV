Yes I know Im late gettin home tonight  
Can supper wait I quess I lost my appetite  
Yeah you can fix me a drink oh anythings okay  
Oh by the way I met a friend of yours today  
  
I was workin on the other side of town  
And comin home I thought Id stop and have a round  
And in this bar I heard someone speak your name  
And thats how I met a friend of yours today  
  
I listened for awhile and I could tell  
That that stranger there he knew you much to well  
And I introduced myself and you should have seen his face  
Oh what a shame I met a friend of yours today  
  
Please dont cry woman cause its much too late for tears  
Yeah Im sorry too cause it hurts after all these years  
  
And aint it sad a love like ours should end this way  
And all because I met a friend of yours today
