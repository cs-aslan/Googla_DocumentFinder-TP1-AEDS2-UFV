Ive just been to heaven with someone so true  
I dreamed about mama last night  
She read me the Bible like she used to do  
I dreamed about mama last night  
  
She never close her eyes and sleep till we were all in bed  
And on party nights till we came home she often sat and read  
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay  
Just how much mama worried when we children were away  
  
We only knew she never slept when we were out at night  
That she waited just to know that wed all come home alright  
Why sometimes when wed stay away till one or two or three  
It seemed to us that mama heard the turnin of the key  
  
For always when wed step aside shed call and wed reply  
But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why  
Until the last one had returned shed always keep a light  
For mama couldnt sleep until she kissed us all goodnight  
  
She had to know that we were safe before she went to rest  
Well she seemed to fear that the world might harm  
The ones that she loved the best  
And once she told me when youre grown to women and to men  
Perhaps Ill sleep the whole night through I may be different then  
  
And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mothers care  
That always when we got back home wed find her waitin there  
Then came the night that we were called together round her bed  
The children are all with you now the kindly doctor said  
  
And in her eyes the gleam again that old time tender light  
That told that shes just been waitin to know we were alright  
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep  
Her children safe from harm throughout the years  
And then she went to sleep  
  
My dream is a treasure that Ill always keep  
I dreamed about mama last night
