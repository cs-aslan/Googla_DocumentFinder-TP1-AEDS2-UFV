Shadows may hide you but also may be your grave  
Youre running today maybe tomorrow youll be saved  
You pray for daylight to save you for a while  
You wonder if your children will face the killers smile  
  
Dead men tell no tales  
Gangland murders up for sale  
Dead men tell no tales  
Gangland where jail birds die  
  
Face at the window leers into your own  
But its only your reflection still you tremble in your bones  
How long can you hide How long till they come  
A rat in a trap but youve got to survive  
  
Once you were glad to be free for a while  
The air tasted good and the world was your friend  
Then came the day when the hard times began  
Now youre alone but alive for how long  
  
A knife at your throat another body on the pile  
A contract to keep and its service with a smile  
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain  
Death on the streets or a blackened out jail  
  
Dead men tell no tales  
In Gangland murders up for sale  
Dead men tell no tales  
In Gangland where jail birds die  
  
In Gangland you tell no tales
