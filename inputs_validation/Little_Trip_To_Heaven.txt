Little trip to heaven on the wings of your love  
Banana moon is shining in the sky  
I feel like Im in heaven when your with me  
I know that Im in heaven when you smile  
Though were stuck here on the ground  
I got something that Ive found and its you  
  
I dont have to take no trip to outer space  
All I have to do is look at your face  
And before I know it Im in orbit around you  
Thanking my lucky stars that I found you  
When I see your constellation honey your my inspiration  
And its you  
  
Your my North Star when Im lost and feeling blue  
Your my sun thats breaking through dont you know its true  
Honey all the other stars seem dim around you  
Thanking my lucky stars that I found you  
When I see your smiling face  
Honey I know nothing ever gonna take your place  
And its you and its you and its you  
And its you and its you and its you
