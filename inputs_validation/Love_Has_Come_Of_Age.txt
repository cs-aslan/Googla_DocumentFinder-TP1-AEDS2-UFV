Love Has Come of Age  
Kenny Loggins  
This Is It  
The many times youve learned the lines  
That love has spoken  
So easily you love to leave  
Your hearts unbroken  
Youve opened up a hundred eyes  
And given them a point of view  
Now think about the times you knew  
And hold them up to me and you  
Love has come of age  
You close your eyes and  
Fantasize a lost horizon  
A memory a gentle breeze for love  
To ride in  
But in your dreams you turned arouind  
And stumbled on a Shangrila  
Youll never be along anymore  
Cause brother now youve gone too far  
Love has come of age  
Ill stop by by tomorrow  
Ill stop by by tonight  
Ill stop by by morning Momma  
Its alright  
If a gigolos what youre after  
Youll have to hold on tight  
Bye bye bye later baby  
Make it make it right
