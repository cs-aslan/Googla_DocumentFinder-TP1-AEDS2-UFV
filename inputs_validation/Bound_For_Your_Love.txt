Yeah its me again  
Coming round for your love  
The clock says 3 again  
And Im bound for your love  
The Cowgate fog wont hide me  
But streetlamps serve to guide me  
Back into your arms  
  
Yeah its me again  
And Im down on my knees  
Wont be free again  
From this love that I feel  
So if you hear me pleading  
To the God I cant believe in  
Dont laugh for too long dear  
  
And the cold night air  
Feels this love affair  
Even cold night air  
  
So if you hear me pleading  
To the God I cant believe in  
Dont laugh for too long dear
