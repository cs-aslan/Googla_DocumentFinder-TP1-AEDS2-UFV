Original by The Ramones  
  
Twentytwentytwenty four hours to go  
I wanna be sedated  
Nothing to do  
Nowhere to go  
I wanna be sedated  
Just get me to the airport  
And put me in a plane  
Hurry hurry hurry before I go insane  
I cant control my fingers  
I cant control my brain  
Oh no oh ho  
Twentytwentytwenty four hours to go  
I wanna be sedated  
Nothing to do  
Nowhere to go  
I wanna be sedated  
Just put me in a wheelchair  
And get me to the show  
Hurry hurry hurry before I go loco  
I cant control my fingers  
I cant control my toes  
Oh no oh ho
