Hey old pal  
Howve you been doing  
Im really not foolin  
Im so glad to see you  
Hey old pal  
My lifes been kind of crazy  
Im ready to be lazy  
Hangin around with you  
  
Well even in the very very worst of times  
Theres one thing that I know  
The way to guarantee  
A little peace of mind  
Is a walk in the woods  
A friend by your side  
And here we go  
  
Hey old pal  
Its great to be here with you  
The thing Id like to give you  
Is a real good time  
Hey old pal  
I really cant believe it  
But now that you can see it  
It looks just fine  
  
What a chance to play and sing  
And have some fun  
The day should never end  
This will be a Rocky Mountain holiday  
With you and me  
And all we can see  
And all of our friends  
  
Hey old pal  
We must be daydreamin  
At least the things were seein  
Are a dream come true  
Hey there gang  
Its great to be together  
It just keeps gettin better  
I can promise you  
  
This is going to be  
The very best of times  
And we will make it so  
No more hustle and bustle  
And no more telephone lines  
And now that were here  
Lets grab all our gear  
And off we go
