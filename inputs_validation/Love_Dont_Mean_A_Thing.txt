If I work hard every day  
For my money  
If I work my finger down to the bone  
That aint funny  
Now if I see  
Something I cant buy  
I put a dollar down  
Then I try try try  
To get my money  
I need my money  
A woman who aint got a dime  
I cant use her no  
If she aint got no cash money  
Ive got to refuse her  
I need a woman  
With a whole lotta will  
So she help me baby  
Help me pay my bill  
I need my money  
Ive got to have money  
  
I need lovin to give me a livin  
So dont ask me I dont need forgivin  
I will stand up to count the cost  
But I know I wont stand the loss  
  
I need a woman  
With a whole lotta will  
She can help me pay my bill  
I need my money  
I want my money  
Before I say my prayers  
I count my money  
When I wake up  
It has to be there  
My money  
You see love it dont mean a thing  
When she loves you  
She cant bring cant bring you no money  
Ive got to have my money  
  
Lookin for lovin  
I need a livin
