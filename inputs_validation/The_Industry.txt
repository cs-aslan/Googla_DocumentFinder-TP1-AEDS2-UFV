Intro  
Yeah I wanna dedicate this to everybody that love hip hop music  
Cause without hip hop music I wouldnt be here today  
Preachers son yeah  
  
Verse 1  
Imagine if Biggie and Pac never got shot  
And they both still were rulers of hip hop  
And Puffy and Suge was roomates from college  
And Big L never got found in the alley  
Nas and JayZ they were still homies  
Squash the beef with Ja Rule and 50  
Benzino shook hands with Eminem  
And on the same record I heard Eve Fox and Kim  
And sometimes when I dream thats when I wake up  
I kinda hoped that The Fugees didnt break up  
And when they walked into the studio I prayed they didnt spray  
Cause I miss that scratch from Jam Master Jay Whoa oh oh  
  
Chorus  
Shots go off mothers cry  
Death since rise homicide  
Black on black crime needs to stop  
Yall cant blame it on hip hop  
Cause what we say is what we see  
What we see is reality  
The ghettos the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow  
Soon they wont live to see tomorrow  
  
Verse 2  
Imagine if Big Pun was still alive  
I could see Fat Joe screamin Terror Squad  
Imagine if there were still four survivors still in Destinys Child  
And TLC never lost they Left Eye  
Imagine Refugees never needin a passport  
And John Forte never at Newark Airport  
Million Man March man that was a start  
Now I need a million more to meet me at Central Park  
When the revolution start yall gon have to play this  
Imagine Slick Rick not gettin deported Whoa oh oh  
  
Chorus  
Shots go off mothers cry  
Death since rise homicide  
Black on black crime needs to stop  
Yall cant blame it on hip hop  
Cause what we say is what we see  
What we see is reality  
The ghettos the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow  
Soon they wont live to see tomorrow  
  
Verse 3  
In the club never though Shyne shot the gun  
But in the limosine JLO had to run  
Paparazzi snappin shots through the mirror  
Thats when I saw a smile from Princess Diana  
Back and forth and forth and back  
Like Miss Aaliyah man do I miss her  
The war goes on with The ROC and The Lox  
Murder INC G Unit its a fight to the top  
Stop We lost too many soldiers like Freaky Tah  
While they get the cover of a magazine who got to die  
  
Chorus  
Shots go off mothers cry  
Death since rise homicide  
Black on black crime needs to stop  
Yall cant blame it on hip hop  
Cause what we say is what we see  
What we see is reality  
The ghettos the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow  
Soon they wont live to see tomorrow  
  
Outro  
Yeah peace be with yall
