Could you awould you  
Um hold me in your arms  
Ashow me all your charms  
Or make me sad or makea me blue  
  
Could you love me  
Like I love you

Could you awould you  
Um asqueeze ahold me tight  
Alove me all through the night  
And never ever let me go  
  
Could you love me  
Like I love you so

Every time I see you walkin down my avenue  
I say Hi hi hi hi hi are you all right  
And you say How do ya do  
Just like ya always do  
And if I had ya in my arms tonight  
  
Could you awould you  
Um hold hold me ohso near  
While I whisper in your ear  
The sweet words you long to hear  
  
Could you love me

Um hoold me ohso near  
While I whisper in your ear
