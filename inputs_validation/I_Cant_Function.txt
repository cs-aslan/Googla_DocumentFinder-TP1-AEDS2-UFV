Im working hard from morning til night  
My shoulder bent into the wheel  
I get home you start to run me down  
How do you think it makes me feel  
Your lashing turn  
It hurts my soul  
I start to think  
And I lose control  
Im not moving like I know I should  
Or feeling like Id like to feel  
And I spend my days just fooling around  
I cant function  
Honey when you run me down  
Oh darling dont you run me down  
I gotta make a little fortune  
So I can bring it on home to you  
Youre only hurting yourself my friend  
Treating me the way you do  
My hands are tied behind my back  
Im drinking dinner from a paper sack  
Every day is the Fourth of July  
And Im nothing but an April Fool  
Well I spend my days just cruising around  
I cant function  
Honey when you run me down  
Oh darling dont you run me down  
Im half a man  
With half a heart  
I hear you laughing  
And I fall apart  
Id like to put it on the table  
But Im lost before I even start  
You do me wrong and its bringing me down  
My idle ways are the talk of the town  
You make me feel like a donothingclown  
I cant function  
Honey when you run me down  
Oh darling dont you run me down  
Oh darling dont you run me down  
  
Background talk  
Dont you run me down darling  
 In public
