Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land  
A breeze upon the water rainfall upon the sand  
We celebrate a baby born from spirit into man  
And Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land  
Its morning in Australia in fact its Christmas Day  
And Colorado never seemed so very far away  
Back where night has fallen and its still Christmas Eve  
And snow is on the mountains where I always hate to leave  
Here I am down under with a brand new family  
And Christmas bells are ringing and theres presents neath the tree  
I know that its been said before and now I know its true  
That home is where the heart is and Christmas lives there too  
On this morning Peace On Earth is still our fervent prayer  
And I can hear it being whispered softly everywhere  
And guns are called to silence and anger called to still  
And brotherhood and sisterhood surrounded by goodwill  
Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land  
A breeze upon the water rainfall upon the sand  
We celebrate a baby born from spirit into man  
And Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land
