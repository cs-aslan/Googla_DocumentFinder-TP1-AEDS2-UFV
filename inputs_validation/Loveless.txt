Whatcha doin whatcha doin whatcha doin right now  
Have you found another lover Are you out of town  
I wont leave another message right after the tone  
Cause I know you got the others and you still dont call  
  
Theres no magic no sunshine  
No rainbows in my life  
Look at all the things you took from me  
  
Baby Im loveless  
Feeling so hopeless  
Feeling so foolish  
For being so helpless  
  
Baby Im loveless  
Its like you could care less  
If you did youd come right back to me  
  
Tell me what Im gonna do about this feeling inside  
Got me tossing and turning in the middle of the night  
Like an animal struggling in a trap  
Cuz I cant go forward and I cant go back  
  
Theres no springtime  
Just winter  
And each night gets colder  
Look at all that pain you took from me  
  
Baby Im loveless  
Feeling so hopeless  
Feeling so foolish  
For being so helpless  
  
And the sun dont shine  
Its just wintertime  
And every night theres no one in my life  
Take a look at what you took from me  
  
Baby Im loveless  
Feeling so hopeless  
Feeling so foolish  
For being so helpless
