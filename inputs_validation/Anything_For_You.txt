Verse  
For you Id climb the highest height  
Id dive the deepest sea  
Search for more of you  
  
For you Id fall upon my knees  
Cry out night and day  
Search for more of you  
  
PreChorus  
And I would give my riches away  
Theyre nothing without you  
  
Chorus  
Something to live for  
Something worth dying for  
Has taken my heart  
Someone to follow  
In good or in troubled times  
Id give all I have  
  
Do Anything for you  
Anything for you
