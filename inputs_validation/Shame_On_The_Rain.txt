Shame on the rain for making me twice as blue  
Its raining in my heart on my window too  
Days just like this have put out the flame  
Ive got that smoke in my eyes shame on the rain  
Youd think its enough just to know that shes gone  
With my kind of luck it will rain from now on  
After Id lost such a heartbreaking game  
Youd think the sun would shine shame on the rain  
 guitar   
Shame on the rain for adding to my unrest she took the sun it figures I guess  
I have my share of sorrow and pain look what a day it is shame on the rain  
Look what a day it is shame on the rain
