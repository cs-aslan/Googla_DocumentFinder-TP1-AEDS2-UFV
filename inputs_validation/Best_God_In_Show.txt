Ive no consideration  
Zero mutual respect  
For billions who suffer from  
Rational thought neglect  
I dont wanna waste a sentence  
I dont want a convertsation  
Thats gonna end in disdain  
Disbelief and aggravation  
  
And I find its getting harder to hang out  
With grown adults who actually believe  
In Santa Claus and Noahs Ark  
And that their god is the best  
My distaste has turned into detest  
  
Who would read a 2000  
Year old medical journal  
Techniques for bloodletting  
Advice on Trichinosis  
Would you navigate the globe  
With a map of a flat earth  
Without DNA testing  
Would you believe virgin birth  
  
And I find its getting painful to put up  
With grown adults who actually believe  
In Unicorns and Creation  
And God always takes their side  
Thats when my innocent jabbing turns snide  
  
Thank God for the Grammy  
Thank God for the touchdown  
Thank God for blowing up  
The enemys sacred ground  
  
So how am I supposed to take  
Anything you say seriously  
When youve swapped free will for faith  
How and predestiny  
  
And its getting agonizing to hang out  
With grown adults who actually believe  
Mythology and history  
Trump physics and science  
My aversion has turned to abhorrence
