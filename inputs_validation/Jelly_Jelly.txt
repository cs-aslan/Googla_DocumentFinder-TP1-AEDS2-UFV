Stormy stormy rain  
Im as lonesome as a man can be  
Oh its stormin stormin rain and  
Im as lonesome as a man can be  
Whoa the way youve been treatin me  
I realize its not the same  
  
Its a downright rotten  
Low down dirty shame  
Lord its a down right rotten  
low down dirty shame  
The way that you treated me  
Lord I know Im not to blame  
  
Jelly jelly jelly  
Jelly stains on my mind  
Jelly jelly jelly  
Jelly stays on my mind  
Jelly roll killed my pappy  
And drove my mama stone blind
