Music is the key to set yourself free  
From depression drugs and increasing poverty  
The key is to the lock the lock is on the door  
The door has a knob that youve never turned before  
The jack use the jack it opens up the lock  
Cause theres the key to unlock the body  
Place it like that to open up the door  
The door to the house full of people galore  
The beat wont stop til the JM jocks  
And he jacks the box til the party rocks  
The clock ticktocks and the place gets hot  
And believe it or not all the troubles you forgot  
Its just that easy if you want it to be  
For all the fellas and the young ladies  
So ease your mind and set yourself free  
To the mystifying music that we call Cindy see  
  
Oh Cindy see wont you play with me  
Oh Cindy see
