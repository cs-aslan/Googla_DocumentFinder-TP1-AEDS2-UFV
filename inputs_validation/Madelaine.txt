Standing watching a pale blue moon  
Rising slowly in the winter sky  
Waiting hoping shell be home soon  
And I wont ask her where or why  
  
As the evening shadows fall  
Madelaine Madelaine  
I can hear the night wind call  
Call her name Madelaine  
  
Turning slowly I hear her call  
Echo softly through the silver pines  
Walking home the first snowflake falls  
Still shes always on my mind  
  
As the evening shadows fall  
Madelaine Madelaine  
I can hear the night wind call  
Call her name Madelaine
