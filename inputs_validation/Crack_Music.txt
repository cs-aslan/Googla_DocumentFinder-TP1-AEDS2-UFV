Chorus  
Thats that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
Thats that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
  
How we stop the black panthers  
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer  
You hear that  
What Gil Scott was hearing  
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin  
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland  
We invested in that its like we got MerrilLynch  
And we been hanging from the same tree ever since  
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine  
So we cook it cut it measure it bag it sell it  
The fiends cop it  
Nowadays they cant tell if thats that good shit  
We aint sure man  
Put the CD on your tongue yeah thats pure man  
  
Chorus  
  
From the place where the fathers gone  
The mothers is hardly home  
And the  
Gonna lock us up in a home  
How the Mexicans say we just trying to party homes  
They want to pack us all in a box like Styrofoam  
Who gave Saddam anthrax  
George Bush got the answers  
Back in the hood its a different type of chemical  
Am and Hammer baking soda  
Raised they own quota  
Writing when our soldiers ran for the stove cause  
Cause dreams of being Hova went from being a brokeman to a being a dopeman  
Ta being a president look theres hope man  
This that inspiration for the mos and the folks man  
Shorty come and see if mama straight overdosing  
And this is the soundtrack  
This the type of music you make when you round that  
Crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
  
Thats that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
  
Godhow could you let this happen happen happen happen happen happen  
  
Thats that crack music crack music  
That real black music black music  
  
Thats that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
  
Thats that crack music crack musicthat real black music black music  
  
Our father give us this day our daily bread give us these days and take our
daily bread  
See I done did all this ole bullshit  
And to atone I throw a little something something on the pulpit  
We took that shit measured it and then cooked that shit  
And what we gave back was crack music  
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies  
So our mammas aint got to be they cooks and nannies  
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from Grammy  
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys  
This dark dixon has become Americas addiction those who aint even black use
it
