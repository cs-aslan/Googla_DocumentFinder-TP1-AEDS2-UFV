Tumbling greens a pickup screams alone above the square  
Whoa sing softly  
Above the trees where Billy breathes we float upon the air  
Whoa oh  
  
Softly sing sweet songs  
Softly sing sweet songs  
Softly sing sweet songs  
  
Silent scenes in motion means Ill wake you when were there  
Whoa sing softly  
Time it seems in broken dreams to sleep beside the stair  
Whoa oh  
  
Softly sing sweet songs  
Softly sing sweet songs  
Softly sing sweet songs  
  
Softly sing sweet songs  
Softly sing sweet songs  
Softly sing sweet songs  
Softly sing sweet songs
