Well its not far down to paradise  
At least its not for me  
And if the wind is right you can sail away  
And find tranquility  
Oh the canvas can do miracles  
Just you wait and see  
Baby believe me oh  
  
Its not far to Never Never Land  
No reason to pretend  
And if the wind is right you can find the joy  
Of innocence again  
Oh the canvas can do miracles  
Just you wait and see  
Baby believe me oh  
  
Sailing takes me away  
Takes me away  
To where Ive always heard it could be  
I heard it could be  
Just a dream and a wind to carry me  
Soon I will be free  
Soon I will be free yeah  
  
Fantasy it gets the best of me  
When Im sailing sailing  
All the world in a reverie  
Every word is a symphony  
Wont you believe me oh  
  
Sailing takes me away  
Takes me away  
Takes me away to where I want to be  
To where Ive always heard it could be  
I heard it could be  
Just a dream and a wind to carry me  
Soon I will be free  
Soon I will be free  
  
Well its not far back to sanity  
At least its not for me  
And if the wind is right you can sail away  
And find serenity  
Oh the canvas can do miracles  
Just you wait and see  
Baby believe me oh  
  
Sailing takes me away  
Takes me away  
To where Ive always heard it could be  
I heard it could be  
Heard it could be  
Just a dream and a wind to carry me  
Soon I will be free  
Soon I will be free free  
  
Sailing takes me away  
To where Ive always heard it could be  
I heard it could be  
I heard it could be  
Just a dream and a wind to carry me  
Soon I will be free  
Soon I will be free yeah
