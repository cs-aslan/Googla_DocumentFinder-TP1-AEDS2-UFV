Wait a minute baby  
Stay with me awhile  
Said youd give me light  
But you never told me about the fire  
  
Drowning in the sea of love  
Where everyone would love to drown  
But now its gone  
It doesnt matter what for  
When you build your house  
Then call me home  
  
And he was just like a great dark wing  
Within the wings of a storm  
I think I had met my match he was singing  
And undoing and undoing the laces  
Undoing the laces  
  
Said Sara youre the poet in my heart  
Never change never stop  
But now its gone  
It doesnt matter what for  
But when you build your house  
Then call me home  
  
Hold on  
The night is coming and the starling flew for days  
Id stay home at night all the time  
Id go anywhere anywhere anywhere  
Ask me and Im there yeah  
Ask me and Im there I care  
  
In the sea of love  
Where everyone would love to drown  
But now its gone  
They say it doesnt matter anymore  
When you build your house  
Then please call me home  
  
Sara youre the poet in my heart  
Never change and dont you ever stop  
Now its gone  
No it doesnt matter anymore  
When you build your house  
Ill come by  
  
Sara  
Sara
