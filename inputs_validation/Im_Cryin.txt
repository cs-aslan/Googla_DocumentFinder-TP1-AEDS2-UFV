Oh Im cryin tears are fallin down  
Im cryin the lonely tears of clowns  
Im tryin to wear a smilin face  
It was just yesterday things then they felt okay  
Now that has all gone away  
  
Oh Im cryin the only tears of clowns  
Im tryin tryin and rains fallin down  
Im cryin and thats a lonely place  
If I could hide the pain if I could stop the rain  
Then all my cryin could be gone  
  
Oh rain who will stop the rain the rain  
Oh Im cryin the tears are fallin down  
Im tryin the rain still beats the ground  
Im cryin those lonely tears of clowns  
  
Lonely lonely tears  
Lonely lonely tears
