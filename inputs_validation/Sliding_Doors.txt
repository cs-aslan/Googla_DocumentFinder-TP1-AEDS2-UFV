Hes right in the crossroad so he doesnt notice me  
Im staring cross the room and so is she  
Looking at you I wonder  
If theres somewhere else youd rather be  
  
He pays her no attention as he takes another call  
I just want to rescue her from it all  
I wanna rock right over  
Say you dont need him anymore  
  
Lets just pretend  
Were somebody else  
And I was someone  
That you want for yourself  
No secrets that hide  
And we leave the past behind  
Yeah  
  
Why dont we just go  
Walk right out the door  
When were leaving  
We wont look back anymore  
Why dont we just go go go  
Go go go  
  
If I was to gamble would I win or would I lose  
Tell you where my thoughts are racing to  
Is it too much to handle  
Or would I be the one youd choose  
  
Lets just pretend  
Were somebody else  
And I was someone  
That you want for yourself  
No secrets that hide  
And we leave the past behind  
Yeah  
  
Why dont we just go  
Walk right out the door  
When were leaving  
We wont look back anymore  
  
All these sliding doors  
That we could explore  
All the lifetimes  
When you were mine  
That we lived before  
Weve come so close  
But youre so far  
Still I can feel everything that you are  
Youre in my head  
Youre in my heart  
No happy end if we dont even start  
  
Why dont we just go  
Walk right out the door  
When were leaving  
We wont look back anymore  
  
All these sliding doors  
That we could explore  
All the lifetimes  
When you were mine  
That we lived before  
Weve come so close  
But youre so far  
Still I can feel everything that you are  
Youre in my head in my head  
Youre in my heart in my heart  
No happy end if we dont even start  
  
Weve come so close so close  
But youre so far so far  
Still I can feel everything that you are  
Youre in my head in my head  
Youre in my heart in my heart  
No happy end if we dont even start
