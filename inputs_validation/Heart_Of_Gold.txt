I want to live  
I want to give  
Ive been a miner for a heart of gold  
Its these expressions I never give  
That keep me searching for a heart of gold  
And Im getting old  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And Im getting old  
  
Ive been to Hollywood  
Ive been to Redwood  
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  
Ive been in my mind its such a fine line  
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And Im getting old  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And Im getting old  
  
Keep me searching for a heart of gold  
You keep me searching for a heart of gold  
And Im getting old  
Ive been a miner for a heart of gold
