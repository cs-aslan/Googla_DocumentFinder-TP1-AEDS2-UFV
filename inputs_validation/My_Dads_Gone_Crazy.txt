Daddy what are you doing  
Okay then  
Everybody listen up  
Im goin to hell  
Whos comin with me  
Somebody please help him  
I think my dads gone crazy  
  
Theres no mountain I cant climb theres no tower too high  
No plane that I cant learn how to fly  
What do I gotta do to get through to you  
To show you there aint nothin I cant take this chainsaw to  
Fuckin brains brawn and brass balls I cutem off  
And gotem pickled and bronzed in a glass jar inside of a hall  
With my framed autographed sunglasses with Elton Johns name on my drag wall  
Im out the closet Ive been lyin my ass off  
All this time me and Dre been fuckin with hats off Suck it Marshall  
So tell Laura and her husband to back off  
Before I push this motherfuckin button and blast off  
And launch one at these Russians and thats all  
Blow every fuckin thing except Afghanistan on the map off  
When will it stop When will I knock the crap off  
Hailie tell em baby  
My Dads Lost It  
  
Chorus  
Theres really nothin else to say I I cant explain it  
I think my dads gone crazy  
A little help from Hailie Jade wont you tell em baby  
I think my dads gone crazy  
Theres nothin you could do or say that could ever change me  
I think my dads gone crazy  
Theres no one on earth that can save me not even Hailie  
I think my dads gone crazy  
  
Its like my mother always told me and codeine and  
Goddammit you little motherfucker  
If you aint got nothin nice to say then dont say nothin  
Uh fuck that shit bitch eat a motherfuckin dick  
Chew on a prick and lick  
A million mutherfuckin cocks per second  
Id rather put out a mutherfuckin Gospel record  
Id rather be a pussy whipped bitch eat pussy  
And have pussy lips glued to my face  
With a clit ring in my nose then quit bringin my flows  
Quit givin me my ammo Cant you see why Im so mean  
If yall leave me alone this wouldnt be my MO  
I wouldnt have to go eenee meenee meini mo  
Catch a homo by his toe man I dont know no more  
Am I the only fuckin one whos normal any more  
Dad  
  
Chorus  
  
My songs can make you cry take you by surprise at the same time  
Can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme  
See what youre seein is a genius at work which to me isnt work  
So its easy to misinterpret it at first  
Cause when I speak its tongueincheek  
Id yank my fuckin teeth before Id ever bite my tongue  
Id slice my gums get struck by fuckin lightning twice at once  
And die and come back as Vanilla Ices son  
And walk around the rest of my life spit on  
And kicked and hit with shit every time  
I sung like R Kelly as soon as Bump and Grind comes on  
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl  
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade standin on Ronnies grave  
Screamin at the sky til clouds gather its Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade  
And thats pretty much the gist of it the parents are pissed but the kids
love it  
Nine millimeter heater stashed in two seaters with meat cleavers  
I dont blame you I wouldnt let Hailie listen to me neither  
  
Chorus  
  
Crazy  
Ha ha ha  
Youre funny daddy
