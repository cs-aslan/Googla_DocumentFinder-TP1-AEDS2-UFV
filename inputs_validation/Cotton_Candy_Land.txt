Sandmans comin yes hes comin  
To sprinkle you with sand  
Hell say one two three  
And youll be In cotton candy land  
Sandmans comin yes hes comin  
Hell take you by the hand  
And youll ride upon a big white swan  
In cotton candy land  
You and the swan will float upon  
A cloud of pink ice cream  
Where every star is a candy bar  
And the moon is a marshmallow dream  
Sandmans comin yes hes comin  
Take his magic hand  
Now goodnightnow sleep tight  
In cotton candy land  
In cotton candy land
