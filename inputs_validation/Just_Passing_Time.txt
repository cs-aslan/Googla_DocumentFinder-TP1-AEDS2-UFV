She was grasping for a way to tell us all  
The hurt she felt inside  
Were all too happy she says  
Lets have a war  
And the night digs deeper in  
  
Theyre just some words to pass the time  
Some words to pass the time  
  
Now when the silence gets to be too much  
I can feel the soul searching  
Where do I go when Ive lost my cause  
We are the stories  
Even the good ones let me down  
There all just words to pass the time  
  
I used to be so sincere  
And maybe I still am  
And all this small talk Ive been reeling off  
Is slowly getting out of hand  
  
I mix real feelings  
With the ones I wish I had  
And I catch the most important ones  
In between them all  
Sometimes it seems like theyre all just words  
To pass the time  
  
And then weve lost our time  
And weve wasted out words  
And all the strain is gone  
Sometimes its too unreal to believe  
Just dont give it all away  
Get a grip  
Causes sometimes there are just words to pass the time  
  
I said Im too high Im too high  
And Im scared of falling down  
Ive just been grasping for words  
To make you want to stay  
To make it worthwhile  
I dont want spend the rest of my life  
Just passing time  
I dont want to spend the rest of my life here  
Just passing time
