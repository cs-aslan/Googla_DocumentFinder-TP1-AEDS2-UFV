Theres a big ol hole  
Thats gone right through the sole  
Of this old shoe  
And the water on the ground  
Aint got no place else it found  
So its only got one thing left to do  
  
Creep on in  
Creep on in  
And once it has begun  
Wont stop until its done  
Sneaking in  
  
Theres a silver moon  
That came just a little soon  
  
For me to bare  
Shines brightly on my bed  
And the shadows overhead  
Wont let me sleep as long as theyre there  
  
Creep on in  
Creep on in  
And once it has beguun  
Wont stop until itd done  
Sneaking in  
  
Theres a big ol hole  
That goes right through my sole  
And that aint nothing new  
So long as youre around  
And got no place else youve found  
Theres only one thing left to do  
  
Creep on in  
Creep on in  
And once you have begun  
Dont stop until youre done  
Sneaking in
