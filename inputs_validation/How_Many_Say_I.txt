Are you ever so silent when she wanted to talk  
Or couldnt keep quiet when she needed a hug  
Come on too strong when a littles too much  
How many how many say I  
Go on and say yes and really mean no  
Would you rather guess when you just dont know  
And then say I love you but arent willing to show  
How many how many say I  
How many how many say I  
  
How many say I how many say I  
How many say I how many say I  
  
Say live and let live so quick to judge  
Slow to forgive when youre holding a grudge  
Dont always believe all you need is love  
How many how many say I  
How many how many say I  
How many how many say I  
  
How many say I how many say I  
How many say I how many say I  
How many say I how many say I  
How many say I how many say I  
  
Have you ever looked down when the homeless walked by  
Or changed the channel when you saw a hungry child  
Know something to be true then deny it  
How many how many say I  
How many how many say I  
How many how many say I  
  
How many say I how many say I  
How many say I how many say I  
How many say I how many say I  
How many say I how many say I
