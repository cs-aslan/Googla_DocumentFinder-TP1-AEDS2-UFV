Im making believe that youre in my arms though I know youre so far away  
Making believe Im talking to you wish you could hear what I say  
And here in the gloom of my lonely room were dancing like we used to do  
Making believe is just another way of dreaming so till my dreams come true  
  
Ill whisper Good night turn out the light and kiss my pillow  
Making believe its you  
Im making believe that youre in my arms though I know youre so far away

Making believe is just another way of dreamin so till my dreams come true  
Ill whisper Good night turn out the light and kiss my pillow  
Making believe its you  
  
And here in the gloom of my lonely room were dancing like we used to do  
Making believe is just another way of dreamin so till my dreams come true  
Ill whisper Good night turn out the light and kiss my pillow  
Making believe its you
