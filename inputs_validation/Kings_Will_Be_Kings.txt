All you have said is still in my ears  
You must have thought youre infallible  
Oh no oh no  
Youre not gonna say that much anymore  
  
Welcome to my peculiar dream  
Fact is that Im here  
Im the master of reality  
Hard to see  
But its real and you will read me  
  
So many ways to go  
Before were sanctified  
Few will be chosen ones  
Until we fade and die  
  
Kings will be kings  
Pawns will be pawns  
Aeons of tears  
Wildand severe  
Blessed be the young  
Strong enough to bear  
What before long will come  
Will be might never disappear  
  
I know that prides before the fall  
How can I fall if theres none left at all  
Tell me tell me  
How far can one fall from down below  
  
Its either time or everyone round  
To show us what or who might be exchangable  
Disposable  
In the game of life were playing  
  
Close to eternity  
I spread my wings and fly  
Like from a distant age  
I rule and you obey  
  
Kings will be kings  
Pawns will be pawns  
Aeons of tears  
Wild and severe  
Blessed be the young  
Strong enough to bear  
What before long will come  
Will be might never disappear
