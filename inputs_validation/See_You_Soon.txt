See you lost your trust and you never should have you never should have  
Dont break your back if you ever see this  
Dont answer that  
In a bullet proof vest with the windows all closed  
Ill be doing my best  
Ill see you soon  
In a telescope lens when all you want is friends  
Ill see you soon  
  
See they came for you they came snapping at your heels they came snapping at
your heels  
Dont break your back if you ever see this  
Dont answer that  
In a bullet proof vest with the windows all closed  
Ill be doing my best  
Ill see you soon  
In a telescope lens when all you want is friends  
Ill see you soon  
  
You lost your trust  
You lost your trust  
No dont lose your trust  
No dont lose your trust
