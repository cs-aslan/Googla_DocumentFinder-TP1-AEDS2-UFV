The five to fours cant take it no more  
The five to fours cant take it no more  
The five to fours cant take it no more  
The five to fours cant take it no more  
Five days  
I ran a wolf across highways  
In the early spring dont stop youre gonna break my heart  
The rest of my days  
Should I stay should I pray  
That Im here now clear now  
Live with the fears  
To extend my tears  
Shed no have no  
Undecided  
Five days in which I cant wait now I need you  
Cant wait now you needed me  
Bet you cant wait now whatever happened to compatible two  
Making you wait now  
  
I ran a wolf across highways in the early spring  
The five to fours cant take it no more  
The five to fours cant take it no more  
The five to fours cant take it no more  
The five to fours cant take it no more  
  
Have I the meanings  
I dont think Im cheating  
I create like the windy city Dont go  
But the drums spread I told you so  
Here we go with the games now  
Maintain now  
Might as well have you down now  
Five days that you cant wait now no need to smile  
Making you hate now  
  
The five to fours cant take it no more  
The five to fours cant take it no more  
The five to fours cant take it no more  
The five to fours cant take it no more  
  
Bet you cant wait now  
Making you wait now  
Dont go I told you so  
After what youve had  
That look on your face you rat  
When you talk like that  
I just want to get you back
