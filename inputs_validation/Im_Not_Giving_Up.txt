To be completely honest  
It scares me to imagine  
What life would be without you  
  
And for this very reason  
I ask you to forgive me  
For what Im putting us through  
  
Although there are so many things  
Against us Ive decided  
That Im not giving you up no  
  
Thinking back I see what we have  
Is something different  
I think weve known all along  
So how fair would it be  
To divide this loves existence  
Between whats right and whats wrong  
  
And you always wondering if well make it  
Time will tell you  
That Im not giving you up no no  
  
Well find a way to be together  
However long it takes wherever  
If it means having you for only a moment  
A moment just might be enough  
Im not giving you up no  
No Im not giving you up no  
  
Screaming in the silence the promises weve spoken  
Come back to haunt me false and broken  
Quiet desperation to see were lost forever  
Searching for water in the desert  
  
No I refuse to have to do  
Without your kisses  
Im not giving you up no no  
  
Well find a way to be together  
However long it takes wherever  
If it means having you for only a moment  
A moment just might be enough  
Im not giving you up no  
  
No Im not giving you up no  
No Im not giving you up
