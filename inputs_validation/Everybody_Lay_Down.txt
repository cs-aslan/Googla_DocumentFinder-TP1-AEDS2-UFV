Everybody go round go round go round  
Everybody lay down lay down lay down  
Dont nobody make a sound  
Everybody lay down  
Everybody give up give up give up  
Nobody hang tough hang tough hang tough  
Life a little too rough  
Everybody lay down  
  
Everybody say hey Dont nobody say no  
Everybody say wait Dont nobody say go CHORUS  
Everybody lay down  
  
Everybody cry loud cry loud cry loud  
Nobody too proud too proud too proud  
To tell you what theyre all about  
Everybody lay down  
  
Everybody dont care dont care dont care  
Nobody play fair play fair play fair  
Maybe everybody too scared  
Everybody lay down  
  
Chorus  
  
Everybody lookin higher  
Everybody want to touch the fire  
Nobody willing to lay it all down  
  
Everybody want heaven  
Everybody say Amen  
One thing is certain you gotta lay it all down

Everybody go round go round go  
Everybody lay down lay down

Everybody give up give up give up  
Nobody hang tough hang tough  
When its just a little rough everybody lay down
