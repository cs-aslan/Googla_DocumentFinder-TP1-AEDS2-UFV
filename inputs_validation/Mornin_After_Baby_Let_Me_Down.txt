The alarm clock woke my sleeping but I lay there for a minute  
With a million cobwebs clinging to my brain  
I stopped that bell from ringin in the times it takes a heartbeat  
Then I settled back and closed my eyes again  
I reached out for my baby for some early mornin lovin  
Then the terrible truth came staggering through my head  
There was just an empty pillow and the memry of his kisses  
Baby wasnt there beside me in the bed  
Its the morning after baby let me down  
Its the daybreak and the heartbreak that I found  
Only silence to torment me no strong hands to touch me gently  
Its the mornin after baby let me down  
  
There was nothing to hold on to but the sheets that fell around me  
And I started into trembling like a leaf  
How could he ever leave me he was more than just a lover  
And he knew all the ways to make me feel complete  
I can taste the salty teardrops God its gettin hard to swallow  
Hope a glass of wine will take his love away  
Got no appetite for eatin just a sick and empty feeling  
What a good for nothing way to start the day  
Its the morning after baby
