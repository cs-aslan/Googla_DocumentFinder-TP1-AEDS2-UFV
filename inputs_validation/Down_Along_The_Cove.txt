Down along the cove  
I spied my true love comin my way  
Down along the cove  
I spied my true love comin my way  
I say Lord have mercy mama  
It sure is good to see you comin today  
  
Down along the cove  
I spied my little bundle of joy  
Down along the cove  
I spied my little bundle of joy  
She said Lord have mercy honey  
Im so glad youre my boy  
  
Down along the cove  
We walked together hand in hand  
Down along the cove  
We walked together hand in hand  
Evrybody watchin us go by  
Knows were in love yes and they understand
