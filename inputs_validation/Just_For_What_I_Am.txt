Feeling of loneliness that I can feel right now  
Love has looked at me but tried to change me  
I wished that love would take me just for what I am  
  
Just for what I am I want someone to love me  
Someone who wont expect me to feel like that old memory  
Just for what they see just for being me  
  
I want someone to love me just for what I am  
Cry aint just a sound its a sadness  
Sadness that lives with me and follows me around  
Love wants me to be someone I cant be  
I wished that love would take me just for what I am  
  
Just for what I am I need someone to love me  
Someone who wont expect me to feel like that old memory  
Just for what they see just for being me  
I want someone to love me just for what I am
