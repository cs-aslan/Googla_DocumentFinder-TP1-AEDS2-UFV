Its just the soul that matters and I dont know why  
You know shes gonna make you cry you know shes gonna make you cry  
Shell have you walk beneath the ladder you were meant to climb  
You know shes gonna make you try you know shes gonna make you try  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh you know were lovers in the night  
Ooh you know were lovers in the night  
  
Its just the soul that matters and keeps her satisfied  
You know shes gonna make you cry you know shes gonna make you cry  
Shell have you wishing that you had her come your way to shine  
You know shes gonna make you try ooh you know shes gonna make you high  
  
Its just the soul that matters and keeps her satisfied  
You know shes gonna make you cry you know shes gonna make you cry  
Shell have you wishing that you had her come your way to shine  
You know shes  
  
Ooh you know were lovers in the night
