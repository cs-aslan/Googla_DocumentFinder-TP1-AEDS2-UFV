Im feeling mixed up  
A little bit confused  
About the time I hit it up again  
Im feeling left out  
A little bit concerned about  
The space between last night and Monday  
  
But Im still afraid  
That you havent  
Changed  
Given me a reason  
To pull of your tshirt  
But Im still ok  
And I dont know why  
Tell me your secret  
I wont tell your boyfriend now  
When you say that  
  
Youre mixing me up now  
Youre pulling my teeth out  
Youre wishing my argument away  
Ill follow directions  
Ill stick to your reasons  
This isnt the season to go running away  
Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh  
  
Ill leave you untouched  
I never once said  
I would be the one to tie you down forever  
I havent missed you much  
I never once said  
I would be the one to lose this love forever  
  
But Im still afraid  
That you havent  
Changed  
Given me a reason  
To pull of your tshirt  
But Im still ok  
And I dont know why  
Tell me your secret  
I wont tell your boyfriend now  
When you say that you dont need me to feel  
  
Youre mixing me up now  
Youre pulling my teeth out  
Youre wishing my argument away  
Ill follow directions  
Ill stick to your reasons  
This isnt the season to go running away  
Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh  
  
You dont understand  
You dont  
You dont understand  
You dont  
 I cant tell you how to feel  
You dont understand  
When Im on the outside  
You dont  
And you are in  
You dont understand  
  
Youre mixing me up now  
Youre pulling my teeth out  
Youre wishing my argument away  
Ill follow directions  
Ill stick to your reasons  
This isnt the season to go running away  
Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh  
Oh Oh  
  
You dont understand  
You dont  
You dont understand  
You dont  
You dont understand  
You dont  
You dont understand
