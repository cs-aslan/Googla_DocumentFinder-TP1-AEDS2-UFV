Lady mornings just a moment away  
And Im without you once again  
You laughed at me  
So many words we didnt say  
Two people lost in a storm  
Where did we go  
Whered we go  
We lost what we both had found  
You know we let each other down  
But then most of all  
I do love you still  
  
We played the games that people play  
We made our mistakes along the way  
Sometimes I know deep in my heart  
You needed me  
Because I needed you so desperately  
We were too blind to see  
But then most of all  
I do love you still
