Verse 1  
Yo ayo tonight is the night that Ima get twisted  
Myx Moscato and vodka Ima mix it  
Roll that spaceship we about to get lifted  
Lift and the President gift is for the gifted  
This what you came this what you came for  
You get what you buy this what you paid for  
So make sure the stars is what you aim for  
Make mistakes though  
  
PreChorus  
I never worry life is a journey  
I just wanna enjoy the ride  
What is the hurry Its pretty early  
Its ok well take our time  
  
Chorusx2  
The night is still young  
The night is still young  
The night is still young  
And so are we  
  
Verse 2  
Ayo drinks on you or the drinks is on me  
We aint going nowhere like tanks on E  
We still getting money which bank is it gonna be  
If he sexy he planking on me  
So when them big boys want all of that  
Tell the bartender say my order back  
Its bottle service he ordered that  
Might let him take it home and slaughter that  
He got friends for all of my friends  
They aint leaving till we say when  
And we gon hangover the next day  
But we will remember this day  
So drop the pop and get low  
Or we can drop the top and just cruise  
We fresh to death down to the shoes  
My only motto in life is dont lose  
  
PreChorus
