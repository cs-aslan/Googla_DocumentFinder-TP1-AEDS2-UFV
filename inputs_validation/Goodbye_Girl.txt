  
All your life youve waited  
For love to come and stay  
And now that I have found you  
You must not slip away  
I know its hard believin  
The words youve heard before  
But darlin you must trust them just once more  
  
Cause baby goodbye  
Doesnt mean forever  
Let me tell you goodbye  
Doesnt mean well never be together again  
  
If you wake up and Im not there  
I wont be long away  
Cause the things you do my Goodbye Girl  
Will bring me back to you  
  
I know youve been taken  
Afraid to hurt again  
You fight the love you feel for me  
Instead givin in  
But I can wait forever  
Ahelpin you to see  
That I was meant for you and you for me  
  
So remember goodbye  
Doesnt mean forever  
Let me tell you goodbye  
Doesnt mean well never be together again  
  
Though we may be so far apart  
You still will have my heart  
So forget your past my Goodbye Girl  
Cause now youre home at last
