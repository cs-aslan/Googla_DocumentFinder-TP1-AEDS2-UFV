When mommys around were the cutest little darlings polite  
Were squeaky clean  
We do the chores in the house as quiet as a mouse  
Better kids youve never seen  
Yes we are mamas little angels  
Yes we are mamas little angels  
You know we are mamas little angels  
As soon as mom leaves for work  
Out come the paint cans start to spray it on the wall  
Thats getting boring  
Go get the bats  
Gonna have us some indoor ball  
Yes we are mamas little angels  
Yes we are mamas little angels  
You know we are mamas little angels  
Well Randys up to bat  
Gonna hit me a home run  
Sorry bout that  
Outside ball one  
We lost our ball lets have some fun with the dishes  
Oops we aint doin too well  
When mommy gets home she wont blame it on us  
She knows that were really swell  
Yes we are mamas little angels  
Yes we are mamas little angels  
You know we are mamas little angels  
Yes we are mamas little angels  
Yes we are mamas little angels  
You know we are mamas little angels
