Youre so hot youre so cool  
I can see that youre nobodys fool  
Now tell me am I coming through  
Its too late I cant wait  
Believe its gonna be a big mistake  
But Im tempted to believe in you  
  
I dont want to run and I dont want to fight  
I just want to be the one you love tonight  
Unclose my eyes let it be  
  
Bring on the band of angels from the great divide  
Ill never get to heaven so take me for a ride  
Fruit on the tree is shaking my mind is in a daze  
I just want a taste of your love  
And learn your wicked ways  
  
Youre so bad it feels good  
Theres so much I never understood  
Oh Mama take a look at me now  
Im hung up strung out  
All I want to do is scream and shout your name  
Addicted to you somehow  
  
Electric in your touch theres magic in your kiss  
You know I never knew that love could feel like this  
Unclose my eyes set me free  
  
Bring on the band of angels from the great divide  
Ill never get to heaven so take me for a ride  
Fruit on the tree is shaking my mind is in a daze  
I just want a taste of your love  
And learn your wicked ways
