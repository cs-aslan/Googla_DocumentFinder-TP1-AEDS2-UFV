Youre lookin at me  
Nowhere to go  
What theyre sayin  
I just dont know  
A floor below me  
Ceiling above  
And Im in the middle  
With nobody to love  
Nobody to love  
Nobody to love  
Nobody to love  
Yeah  
Well lookin at me  
Nowhere to go  
Know what theyre sayin  
I just dont know  
A floor below me  
A ceiling up above  
And Im in the middle  
With nobody to love  
Nobody to love  
Yeah hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
