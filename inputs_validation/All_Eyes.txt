Everything you say is just a lie  
And now Im leaving to the city  
Where the people are awake  
To chase a dream that isnt real  
And we pose to be something that were not  
Just wanna change a lot and sign their name after the dot  
  
Everything you see is just a century of anarchy  
Among all my corresponding colors  
That symbolize the things we can attest  
A range we can assess we can attain  
We are the intrigue  
Entities to entice and entertain  
  
All eyes theyre on you  
Dont deny youve got to  
This is a call thats all youll ever get from me  
This is a call thats all youll ever get from me  
  
Take my side  
Take my side  
Dont look back  
Now Im easy  
And thats a fact  
And youre on my mind  
Ohh  
  
Everything you say is just a lie  
And now Im leaving to the city  
Where the people are awake  
To chase a dream that isnt real  
And we pose to be something that were not  
Just wanna change a lot and sign their name after the dot  
  
All eyes theyre on you  
Dont deny youve got to  
This is a call thats all youll ever get from me  
  
Now will the Sun come up tonight  
Because youre eyes they burn so bright  
Im all youve got  
When you say  
That you want it all  
You want it alll  
  
All eyes theyre on you  
Dont deny youve got to  
This is a call thats all youll ever get from me  
This is a call thats all youll ever get from me  
  
All eyes theyre on you  
Dont deny youve got to  
This is a call thats all youll ever get from me  
This is a call thats all youll ever get from me
