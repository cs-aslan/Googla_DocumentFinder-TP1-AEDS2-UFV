Youve gotta shout if youve got something to say  
I know its getting bad you read it every day  
And you you can try your best to fight it  
But you cant make it on your own  
  
Someone better tell the people up there  
I think they ought to know the bubbles just about to bust  
Tell them theyd better beware  
The word is on the street get up on your feet and shout out  
  
The kids out there dont know how to react  
The streets are getting tough and thats a matter of fact  
And I I cant take it any longer  
But we cant make it on our own  
  
The people there find it hard to relate  
They dont know how it feels to be standing there on your own  
Believe me its never too late  
Its time to make a move get up on your feet and shout  
  
Stop look down everybody do you see whats going on  
Around you stop  
  
Shout out shout it out shout loud  
Shout out shout it out shout loud  
  
There are people who give and there are people who take  
But I believe its gonna get better  
Realize what a difference you make  
And dont turn away hey Im talking to you  
  
So theres only the one solution  
Stop and think whats going on  
You can draw your own conclusions  
But we wont make it on our own  
  
Someone better tell the people up there  
I think they ought to know  
The bubbles just about to burst  
Tell them theyd better beware  
The word is on the street  
Get up on your feet and shout  
  
Stop look down everybody  
Do you see whats going on  
Around you stop
