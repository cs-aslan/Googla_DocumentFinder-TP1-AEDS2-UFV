Warm and lovely mystery fire smiling through  
Before this moment fades away I want to know you  
Ive got lightening in my pocket thunder in my shoe  
Have no fear Ive got something here I want to show you  
  
Low under the falling sky  
Easily we will lie  
While I bring it to you  
  
Its a low road a high wire going from me to you  
And in your eyes the distance left is closing  
Ive got a feeling in my oceans  
Blood underneath my skin  
That into your bright fields this prison is opening  
Our shadows wake each day though they dont know why  
They hope and try live and die  
So leave them in their frozen world  
Come and be my lover  
If only for one stolen moment  
We will live forever  
  
Warm and lovely mystery can you hear the choir  
Voices can no longer hold my desire  
Just abandon your sad history and meet me in the fire  
Angels wait to take me higher and higher  
Higher and higher
