I was born bad  
But then I met you  
You made me nice for a while  
But my dark sides true  
  
You never cared what I did at all  
Motel singer at a silver ball  
I did what I had to do  
  
Femme fatale always on the run  
Diamonds on my wrist whiskey on my tongue  
Before I give back I gotta get drunk  
So get over here pour me a cold one  
  
Babe you can see that Im danger  
Teetering off of the stage yeah  
Sparkling in sequins say heyyeah  
  
Time to give in to the kindness of strangers  
  
Is it wrowrong that I think its kinda fun  
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun  
My daddys in the trunk of his brand new truck  
I really want him back but Im flat outta luck  
  
Is it wrowrong that I think its kinda fun  
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun  
My daddys in the trunk of his brand new truck  
I really want him back but Im kinda outta luck  
  
Wrong I know killing someone  
It gets a little easier when youve done it once  
You know that Im fun you know that Im young  
So tell me your mind lets get it on  
  
Babe you can see that Im danger  
Glamorous but Im deranged yeah  
Teetering off of the stage yeah  
I said it really nicely so can you be my savior  
  
Is it wrowrong that I think its kinda fun  
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun  
My daddys in the trunk of his brand new truck  
I really want him back but Im flat outta luck  
  
Is it wrowrong that I think its kinda fun  
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun  
My daddys in the trunk of his brand new truck  
I really want him back but Im kinda outta luck  
  
I was a dangerous girl  
You were too nice for this world  
And now Im back on the prowl  
Who wants to give it a whirl  
  
Is it wrowrong that I think its kinda fun  
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun  
My daddys in the trunk of his brand new truck  
I really want him back but Im flat outta luck  
  
Is it wrowrong that I think its kinda fun  
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun  
My daddys in the trunk of his brand new truck  
I really want him back but Im kinda outta luck
