Shadows are fallin and Im runnin out of breath  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
If I leave you it doesnt mean I love you any less  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
When you get up in the mornin and you see that crazy sun  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
Theres a train leavin nightly called When All is Said and Done  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
Shalalalalalalilalalalo  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
Shalalalalalalilalalalo  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
Sometimes when youre doin simple things around the house  
Maybe youll think of me and smile  
You know Im tied to you like the buttons on your blouse  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
Hold me in your thoughts  
Take me to your dreams  
Touch me as I fall into view  
When the winter comes  
Keep the fires lit  
And I will be right next to you  
  
Engine drivers headed north up to Pleasant Stream  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
These wheels keep turnin but theyre runnin out of steam  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
Shalalalalalalilalalalo  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
Shalalalalalalilalalalo  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
Keep me in your heart for a while
