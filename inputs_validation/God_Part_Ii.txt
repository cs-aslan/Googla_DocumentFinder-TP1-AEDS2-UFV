Dont believe the devil  
I dont believe his book  
But the truth is not the same  
Without the lies he made up  
  
Dont believe in excess  
Success is to give  
Dont believe in riches  
But you should see where I live  
II believe in love  
  
Dont believe in forced entry  
Dont believe in rape  
But every time she passes by  
Wild thoughts escape  
I dont believe in death row  
Skid row or the gangs  
Dont believe in the Uzi  
It just went off in my hand  
II believe in love  
  
Dont believe in cocaine  
Got a speedball in my head  
I could cut and crack you open  
Do you hear what I said  
Dont believe them when they tell me  
There aint no cure  
The rich stay healthy  
While the sick stay poor  
II believe in love  
  
Dont believe in Goldman  
His type like a curse  
Instant karmas going to get him  
If I dont get him first  
Dont believe that rock n roll  
Can really change the world  
As it spins in revolution  
It spirals and turns  
II believe in love  
  
Dont believe in the 60s  
The golden age of pop  
You glorify the past  
When the future dries up  
Heard a singer on the radio late last night  
He says hes gonna kick the darkness  
til it bleeds daylight  
II believe in love  
  
I feel like Im falling  
Like Im spinning on a wheel  
It always stops beside of me  
With a presence I can feel  
II believe in love  
Stop
