Merrygorounds and burial grounds  
Are all the same to me  
Horses on post and kids and ghosts  
Are spirits that we ought to set free  
Then city slicker pickers got a lot of  
Slicker licks than me  
But ridin the range and acting strange  
Is where I want to be  
  
And I just wanna be a cosmic cowboy  
I just wanna ride and rope and hoot hoot  
Well I just wanna be a cosmic cowboy  
Talkin bout a supernatural country rockin galoot  
  
Well skinny dippin and lone star sippin and steel guitar  
And are just as good as hollywood and some boogiewoogie bars  
Im gonna buy me a vest and a head out west  
My little woman and myself  
And when we come to town the people gather around  
And marvel at the little babys health  
  
And I just wanna be a cosmic cowboy  
I just wanna ride and rope and hoot hoot  
Well I just wanna be a cosmic cowboy  
I said a supernatural country rockin galoot  
  
Then a big raccoon and a harvest moon  
Keep rolling through my mind  
And a home on the range where the antelope play  
Is sometimes hard to find  
So dont bury me on the lone prairie  
Id rather play there alive  
Well Im doing my best I keep my farm in the west  
My little bronco in overdrive  
  
And I just wanna be a cosmic cowboy  
I just wanna ride and rope and hoot hoot  
Well I just wanna be a cosmic cowboy  
Talkin bout a supernatural country rockin galoot  
  
And I just wanna be a cosmic cowboy  
I just wanna ride and rope and hoot hoot  
Well I just wanna be a cosmic cowboy  
Talkin bout a supernatural country rockin galoot
