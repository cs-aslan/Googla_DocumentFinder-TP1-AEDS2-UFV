Light comes through a crack in the door  
I tape up the windows once more  
Tight like a cold hand of steel  
Dont fear the stranger within  
Hands that petrify in the air  
Eyes catching things never there  
Sweet tension caught on my breath  
Dont fear the stranger within  
Watch every shape that escapes  
Scared to make the final mistake  
Speak to hear the sound of your voice  
Dont fear the stranger within  
Sit in the corner with your back to the wall  
Pray to your God with your head in your hands  
Your mask of fear is shrinking fast  
Its closing in more amour  
You stand on borrowed time your sweating palms and chilling brow  
Your wideeyed panic makes you laugh you cry and laugh  
Freeze until the noise decays a shuffle from behind a door  
Your throat is tight it makes you choke and smoke and choke  
Eyes will grow accustomed to the dark a stifled scream that wont come out  
Theres nothing more to fear from the stranger within  
Dont fear the stranger within  
I feel the stranger within  
I see the stranger within  
Dont know the stranger within  
I am the stranger within  
I am the stranger within
