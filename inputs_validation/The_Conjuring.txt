Welcome to our sanguinary sect or worship  
Feel at home in our black conventicle  
As we anathmastise  
All those who oppose us  
Dont summon the devil  
Dont call the priests  
If you need the strength  
The conjuring obey  
Behold the flames rise  
From the compass cardinal points  
Burn the sacred oil  
And with the ashes youll annoint  
Arrange the symbols  
Of the wizard and magician  
Light the candles  
Place the parchment paper in position  
Between its leaves place  
The lash from a black cats eye  
A straw of a broom  
Fold burn and centralize  
Dont summon the devil  
Dont call the priests  
If you need the strength  
The conjuring  
I am the devils advocate  
A salesman if you will  
You know my name  
I met your father years ago  
Gave him what hed please  
He called my name youll do the same  
Im claiming what is mine by right  
Its time to close the deal  
Youre bought and sold bought and sold  
Come join me in my infernal depths  
Mephistos Hall of Fame  
Ive got your soul Ive got your soul  
The conjuring Obey
