I dont know where Im going  
But I cant wait to get there  
All I know is Im just going  
  
I ran away from home last night gone forever  
I was running for my life  
And Ive heard the words of what I should be  
Live work die I am the orphan of the night  
  
Take me down Im coming home the road to ruins  
Inside the pleasure dome  
Take me down Im coming home arena of pleasures  
Where I belong  
  
Im in the eye of my rage  
Where no hurricane dies  
  
Im in the eye of my rage  
Where the hurricane lies  
Oh a storms in my eyes  
And like the beast thats in my soul  
Im the restless child  
Ah mama Im running for my life  
  
I was sixteen going nowhere  
Will I see seventeen alive  
And I was running from the nightmare  
I stand at the promised land with fire in my eyes  
Im at the crossroad of my destiny and desire  
Oh God what will I be  
And my obsession is the gasoline to feed my fire  
Oh its burning in me  
  
Dont waste the tears on my wasted years  
Mama Im outta here
