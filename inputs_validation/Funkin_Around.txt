ANDRE 3000 Hello well good evening ladies and gentlemen  
What we like to do right here  
Well first of all let me let you know who I am  
Well I go by the name of Andre 3000 right  
And we hail from a place called like Stankonia GA right  
You know right now everyone wants to be from space  
And like want to be from the country and everything like that  
You know like really like the south is like  
Its cool to be from the South right about now  
Girls listen up  
  
Torn between Saturday night and early Sunday morn  
I dont know im somewhere stuck in between tween  
Im out here knowing Hip Hop is dead  
The average nigga on my corner yelling  
What the fuck you mean mean  
See we aint even seen the mountain top counter clock  
Wise goes the neighborhood handmedowns and canned goods Wont cut the Grey
Poupon we got that make you run  
Back to the drawing board cant afford to lose yall make me yawn  
One slash one slash ninetyone  
My teacher sees potential in me says sit down son  
Now let me tell you like I heard it when I felt deserted  
It wasnt no other way to word it got my feelings murdered  
By the bullet of bad the singer of sad  
Songs to make you long for your mom and your dad  
Plaid clash with polka dots I hope you aint mad  
Back up little mama im about to react

BIG BOI Well Scottyis beaming Lil Pookie nem scheming Whats the use in
living my nigga  
While you snoozing Im dreaming  
No Tylenol PM you amount to the same thing  
Everyday like Per Diem  
Never trying to be nothing better than what you are being  
One nation under the cool should be the rule  
When a young man or a young lady begins or  
Starts grade school silent before violence  
Nine times out of ten times the quietest is livest  
Fumbling through your privates Daddy Fat Sax can I have you back Naw  
Ooh You such a player ooh Your southern drawl  
Got me sprawled out in your black book my name is crossed out Went from
starting second string now you in the dog house Reminiscin a part of you
was missing  
Instead of arguements you think about the hugs and kisses  
If this is something hard for you to take  
You better bounce rock roller skate
