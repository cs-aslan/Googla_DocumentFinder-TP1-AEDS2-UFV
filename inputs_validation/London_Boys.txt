Bow Bells strike another night  
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache  
Youve bought some coffee butter and bread  
You cant make a thing cause the meters dead  
You moved away  
Told your folks youre gonna stay away  
  
Bright lights Soho Wardour street  
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet  
Somebody shows you round  
Now youve met the London boys  
Things seem good again someone cares about you  
  
Oh the first time that you tried a pill  
You feel a little queasy decidedly ill  
Youre gonna be sick but you mustnt lose faith  
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace  
With the London boys with the London boys  
  
Youre only seventeen but you think youve grown  
In the month youve been away from your parents home  
You take the pills too much  
You dont give a damn about that jobs youve got  
So long as youre with the London boys  
  
A London boy oh a London boy  
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy  
A London boy a London boy  
You think youve had a lot of fun  
But you aint got nothing youre on the run  
Its too late now cause youre out there boy  
Youve got it made with the rest of the toys  
Now you wish youd never left your home  
Youve got what you wanted but youre on your own  
With the London boys  
  
Now youve met the London boys  
Now youve met the London boys  
Now youve met the London boys
