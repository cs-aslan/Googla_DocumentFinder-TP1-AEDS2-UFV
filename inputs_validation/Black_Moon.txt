Oh the devil is rising with the moon  
He cries and my blood runs cold  
Oh no never was the darkness so black  
No light and nowhere to go  
  
My spirit is crying for a love  
So tired of being alone  
I remember He came here to steal  
And You are His stealer of souls  
  
I see a Black Moon rising  
And its calling out my name  
Oh its calling my name  
  
Ive been blinded lost and confused  
Darkness will call me no more  
Heaven is no friend of mine  
No god ever knocked on my door  
  
I see a Black Moon rising  
And its calling out my name  
Oh its calling my name  
  
Im standing on the dark side of time  
Reaching for the power of Her hand  
Shes weaving an unholy light  
And calls from Lucifers land  
  
I see a Black Moon rising  
And its calling out my name  
An angel of Hell is rising  
Heavens no friend of mine  
  
I see a Black Moon rising  
And its calling out my name  
I see a Black Moon rising  
And it causes so much pain  
  
An angel of Hell is rising  
Heavens no friend of mine  
I see a Black Moon rising  
And its calling out my name  
  
Its calling my name  
This spirits crying for love  
  
Heavens no friend of mine
