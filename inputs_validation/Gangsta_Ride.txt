Chorus  
Its a gangsta gangsta ride  
On the nutty danger side  
As we ride dip and slipping  
Take your mind on a high  
Its a gangsta gangsta ride  
On the nutty danger side  
As we ride dip and slipping  
Take your mind on a high  
  
Yo yo from that DPG nigga to the CP3  
Back to the house East to the West  
Now take it BACK to the South  
You know how I switch my flow  
If Im lapsing you glad niggasll get mad then hit the flo  
Gotta bag me some dank so I hit the sto  
In the winter its the Hummer for the summer its the sixfo  
Got niggas mad at me why Cause they cant get no six  
Bitches upset with me why Cause they cant get no dick  
Ima be on top of the game whether Im broke or rich  
I dont stop once Im on top I just drop mo hits  
Im in the club with the thug I just pop mo Crist  
Tell Snoop to get the Coupe his new shit I just gots to go get  
Cause when I cock my shit usually I pop my shit  
Tell all you teary eyed females gettin overoffended  
Cause I dont jock no chick  
Im the Boss and I dont follow no person I follow Jesus  
Yall blame a bunch of kids so I gotta roll my Adidas  
  
Chorus  
  
Boom bam as I step in the jam god damn  
Dont need no introduction cause you know who I am

Now motherfuckers let me hear you say hoe  
I spit ya spat at ya whoot wham get at ya  
Rider I threw a slider right at ya  
Mash ya gat ya dripdrop the hatchet  
Keep the party cracking while Im steady rapping  
This game we run yall know whats happening  
We back in effect we got the heat on deck  
Im sliding down South with a blunt in my mouth  
I catch a plane out East and try to make some peace  
Im hanging with my niggas in the projects  
The homies throwing a party I gotta get back West  
Oh yeah thats right we are the best  
No Limit DPG Southwest connects ya feel me
