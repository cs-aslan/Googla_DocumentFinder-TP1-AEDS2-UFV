Would you mind if I still loved you  
Would you mind if things dont last  
Would you mind if I hold onto  
You so that I wont crash  
  
Morning light Im at your door  
One last time and no ones there  
Nobody nobody nobody no  
Drove all night just to beat you home  
Would you mind if I waited  
Would you mind if I wait right here  
  
And I really really wanna love you  
And Im really only yours  
Even if it dont last forever I wanna let you know  
We really had something special its hard tryna let it go  
Im just being honest Im still in the moment  
  
Would you mind if I still loved you  
Would you mind if things dont last  
Would you mind if I hold onto  
You so that I wont crash  
  
Up all night cant let go  
Wont stop trying need you to know  
Its worth the fight if I get back come  
Hope you dont mind I waited  
Would you mind if I wait right here  
  
And I really really wanna love you  
And Im really only yours  
Even if it dont last forever I wanna let you know  
We really had something special its hard tryna let it go  
Im just being honest Im still in the moment  
  
Would you mind if I still loved you  
Would you mind if things dont last  
Would you mind if I hold onto  
You so that I wont crash  
  
Im not thinking bout nobody else but you  
Youre the only one who takes me there  
Im not thinking bout nobody else but you  
Youre the only one who takes me there  
Im not thinking bout nobody else but you  
Youre the only one who takes me there  
Im not thinking bout nobody else but you  
Youre the only one who takes me there  
  
Would you mind if I still loved you  
Would you mind if things dont last  
Would you mind if I hold onto  
  
You so that I wont crash
