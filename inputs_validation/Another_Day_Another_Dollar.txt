Another day another dollar  
Thats what Im working for today  
Another day another dollar  
Sure cant buy my blues away  
Im just trying to make a living  
Working jobs that I enjoy  
But it aint easy finding something  
For this lonesomehearted boy  
Another day another dollar  
Thats what Im working for today  
Another day another dollar  
Sure cant buy my blues away  
You know my life is like a highway  
Just too many roads to take  
You know Ill try to take the right one  
Just gets harder every day  
Another day another dollar  
Thats what Im working for today  
Another day another dollar  
Sure cant buy my blues away  
Another day another dollar  
Thats what Im working for today hey  
Another day another dollar  
Sure cant buy my blues away  
Another day another dollar  
Sure cant buy my blues away
