You tell me that youre leavin  
I cant believe its true  
Girl theres just no livin without you  
Dont take your love away from me  
Dont you leave my heart in misery  
Cause if you go then Ill be blue  
Breakin up is hard to do  
  
Remember when you held me tight  
And you kissed me all through the night  
Think of all that we been through  
And breakin up is hard to do  
  
They say that breakin up is hard to do  
Now I know I know that its true  
Dont say that this is the end  
Instead of breakin up I wish that  
We were makin up again  
  
I beg of you dont say goodbye  
Cant we give our love just one more try  
Come on baby lets start anew  
Breakin up is hard to do
