Jackson Browne Craig Doerge and Rosemary Butler  
  
Ive been sitting up all night without you  
Trying not to think that much about you  
How do you expect me not to doubt you  
I dont want to but Im here  
And I cant stop this whispering in my ear  
  
Chorus  
Ill fly away without you Ill fly away without you  
Ill fly away without you babe without you fly away  
Without you  
  
You know I never wanted to confine you  
I always let you come and go your way  
Honey if you let that freedom blind you you know I wont wait around  
It took too long to find this love we found  
  
Ill fly away wthout you Ill fly away without you  
Ill fly away if you dont do something to make me stay  
I want to but I cant be the only one to say I want you  
  
When I think how easily you caught me  
Well it wasnt hard to pull me to the ground  
Whether it was something that you taught me  
Or just something that I found  
Loving you is all that holds me down  
  
Ill fly away without you Ill fly away without you  
Ill fly away if you dont do something to make me stay  
I want to but I cant be the only one to say I want to  
And I wont have your love no other way  
  
Chorus
