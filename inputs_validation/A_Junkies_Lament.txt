Rickys been kicking the gong lickitysplit didnt take too long  
A junkies sick a monkeys strong thats whats wrong  
Well I guess hes been messing around downtown so sad to see the man losing
ground  
Winding down behind closed doors on all fours  
  
Mama dont you call him my name he cant hear you anymore  
Even if he seems the same to you thats a stranger to your door  
Go on ask him whats he come here for  
  
Oh my God a monkey can move a man Send him to hell and home again  
An empty hand in the afternoon shooting for the moon  
Its halfway sick and its halfway stoned Hed sure like to kick but hes too
far gone  
They wind him down with the methadone hes all on his own  
  
But baby dont you throw your love away I hate to seem unkind  
Its only that I understand the man that the monkey can leave behind  
I used to think he was a friend of mine  
  
Oh La la la la la la la la  
Oh la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la
