Your sweet embrace your hand in mine  
So close together  
How many times Ive made you mine  
Is this forever  
Promises and dreams weve shared  
Do you remember  
Oh here we are so near and yet so far  
From each other  
Chorus  
Handle my heart with love  
Dont let me hope in vain  
Only your touch can save my heart  
From breaking again  
So handle my heart with love  
Stay and youll ease my pain  
Only your touch can save my heart  
From breaking again  
Your gentle smile your tender touch  
So captivating  
No other love has meant this much  
And Ill go on waiting  
One day in your arms Ill hear  
This is forever  
I know its there though right now its hard to care  
For each other  
Repeat chorus  
Dont make us part  
Please dont brake my heart again
