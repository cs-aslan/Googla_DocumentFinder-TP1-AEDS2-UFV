You hear the cries of love a sad tune  
And feel the saltlick stingin loves wound  
Those tears that you cry leave a blood stain  
They fall to the ground like a sweet rain  
Cause bad girls they do  
BAD  
Bad make your mom and daddy sad  
BAD  
Bad Its the bloody fix you do oh Look out  
You see whats in you head fantasy  
And need but you cant have BAD  
Call a spade a spade only if you want to  
Cause by any other name its taboo  
Cause bad boys they do  
BAD  
Bad make your mom and daddy sad  
BAD  
Bad Its the bloody fix you do the bloody fix you do  
BAD  
Bad make your mom and daddy sad  
BAD  
Bad gonna drive you raving mad  
BAD  
Bad make your mom and daddy sad  
BAD  
Bad Its the bloody fix you do
