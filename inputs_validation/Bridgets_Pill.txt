Bridget OReilly was a fine looking girl  
Well her skin was like ivory and her teeth shone like  
Pearls  
The fellas all chased her in vain til one day  
She went and got married to Barney OShea  
  
Theyd been married a year when to their pride and joy  
Along came a baby a fine strapping boy  
When three years had past theyd two boys and a girl  
How to feed them and clothe them made Bridgets head  
Whirl  
  
Bridget went to the priest she was near desperation  
Because of this process of constant gestation  
O Father this business is making me Ill  
Would it be a sin if I took to the Pill  
  
The priest heard her story and when he had heard it  
To higher authorities perplexed he referred it  
The bishops were baffled the cardinals too  
Not one could tell Bridget just what she should do  
  
Two years they debated with holy profundity  
What should be done about Bridgets fecundity  
For now Bridgets children amounted to five  
And she scarcely was able to keep them alive  
  
They gave due attention to points theological  
Points philosophic and physiological  
Til in desperation the Pope cried o sod  
Theres just one thing to do Id best go and ask God  
  
So the Pope sent a letter by five penny post  
On Papal notepaper addressed Holy Ghost  
Come send me an answer in double quick time  
  
You can reach me at home just ring vat 69  
  
The Pope got his answer and then he announced it  
Oral contraception he thoroughly denounced it  
All chemical means to prevent procreation  
Are banned on the pain or eternal damnation  
  
If we were to allow it unashamed fornication  
Would spread like a flash to all parts of the nation  
Thered be plagues fire and famine and moral  
Pollution  
Atheistical notions and red revolution  
  
And the Lord knows what women would do with their lives  
If they werent kept so busy as mothers and wives  
They might get ideas not befitting their station  
And wind up in womens or gay liberation  
  
So Bridget my dear theres no need for frustration  
Because of the banning of this medication  
The Church she is merciful holy and gracious  
Surely the old rhythm method youll find efficacious  
  
Away now said Bridget Ill have none of your row  
For I tried it before and just look at me now  
Whatever I did we continued to breed  
And shes off to the chemists with maximum speed  
  
Now the Church is in ferment in great trepidation  
Lest such thought should spread to the whole  
Congregation  
And theyve issued a record to prevent a schism  
By the Pope and the Hierarchy called Ive got rhythm
