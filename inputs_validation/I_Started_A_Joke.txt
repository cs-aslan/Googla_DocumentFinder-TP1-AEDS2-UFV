I started a joke which started the whole world crying  
But I didnt see that the joke was on me oh no  
I started to cry which started the whole world laughing  
Oh If Id only seen that the joke was on me  
  
I looked at the skies running my hands over my eyes  
And I fell out of bed hurting my head from things that I said  
Till I finally died which started the whole world living  
Oh If Id only seen that the joke was on me  
  
I looked at the skies running my hands over my eyes  
And I fell out of bed hurting my head from things that I said  
Till I finally died which started the whole world living  
Oh If Id only seen that the joke was on me  
Oh no that the joke was on me
