Im changing arranging  
Things I never thought Id move before  
Im changing arranging  
To your personality I asked for it before  
I need a soul wholl never say what I feel  
Just fearing that I will accept the ideal  
I look up high and I swear all I see  
Its a carbon copy image of me  
Im dying hard trying  
Baby baby for the rest of my life  
Im trying hard dying  
Maybe maybe hes trying to be my life  
Ive got a never ending battle inside  
Just trying to rectify my personal pride  
I swear I dont know what its got over me  
But I know it doesnt want to be free
