Ive got to be honest  
I think you know  
Were covered in lies and thats OK  
Theres somewhere beyond this I know  
But I hope I can find the words to say  
  
Never again no  
No never again  
  
Chorus  
Cause youre a god  
And I am not  
And I just thought  
That you would know  
Youre a god  
And I am not  
And I just thought  
Id let you go  
  
But Ive been unable  
To put you down  
Im still learning things I ought to know by now  
Its under the table so  
I need something more to show somehow  
  
Never again no  
No never again  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive got to be honest  
I think you know  
Were covered in lies and thats OK  
Theres somewhere beyond this I know  
But I hope I can find the words to say  
Never again no  
No never again  
  
Chorus
