Greeting cards have all been sent  
The Christmas rush is through  
But I still have one more wish to make  
A special one for you  
  
Merry Christmas Darling  
Were apart thats true  
But I can dream and in my dreams  
Im Christmasing with you  
  
Holidays are joyful  
Theres always something new  
But every days a holiday  
When Im near to you  
  
The lights on my tree  
I wish you could see  
I wish it every day  
The logs on the fire  
Fill me with desire  
To see you and to say  
  
That I wish you a merry Christmas  
Happy New Year too  
Ive just one wish  
On this Christmas Eve  
I wish I were with you  
I wish I were with you
