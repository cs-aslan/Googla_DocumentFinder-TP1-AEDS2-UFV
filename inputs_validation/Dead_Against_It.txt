And when she drowns  
Within and in the fizzy gin begins to sigh  
Good God oh my I cry  
And die and lie beside  
She is the apple in my eye  
She talked to God  
I couldnt cope ord hope eloped  
A dope she roped this salty lie  
And when shes dreaming I believe  
And when shes reading I retreat  
Cant believe her telling me shes dead again  
Telling me shes dead against it  
And deep my wound  
Within for every second chance it was thy tore  
From deep within despite the rain  
My words are worn  
She loves to talk into the phone  
No matter who no matter when  
No matter where  
No better than the faulty line  
And when shes dreaming I believe  
And when shes reading I retreat  
Cant believe her telling me shes dead again  
Telling me shes dead against it
