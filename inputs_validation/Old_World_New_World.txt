Natives wearing turquoise and silver  
Dirty dogs barking in the distance  
Oh people of a thousand tongues  
Im learning the primitive rights  
Im doing as the Romans do  
  
Mt Kalais to Mt Everest  
Then down to the River Ganges  
Oh to follow your mighty past  
Were learning the primitive rights  
Were doing as the Romans do  
  
Old world new world  
I know nothing  
But Ill keep dancing  
  
Citys crumble into the ocean  
Citys getting built in the sky  
Oh now were talking digital  
Were learning the primitive rights  
Were doing as the Romans do  
  
Millions playing at Monopoly  
Rolling the dice of their life  
Oh Im dancing and shaking hands  
Were learning the primitive rights  
Were doing as the Romans do  
  
Old world new world  
I know nothing  
But Ill keep listening
