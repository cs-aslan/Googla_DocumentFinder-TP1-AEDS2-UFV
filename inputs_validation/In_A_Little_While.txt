Heres to the good life or so they say  
All those parties and games that all those people play  
They tell me this is the place to be  
All those beautiful people and nothing to see  
  
Chorus  
Sometimes I feel like something is gone here  
Something is wrong here  
I dont belong here  
Sometimes I feel like a stranger in town  
And Ive lost what Ive found  
Itll all turn around  
In a little while Ill be thinking about you  
In a little while Ill still be here without you  
You never gave me a reason to doubt you  
In a little while Ill be thinking about you baby  
Ill be thinking about you baby  
  
On the other side of a coin theres a face  
Theres a memory somewhere that I cant erase  
And theres a place that Ill find someday  
But sometimes I feel like its slipping away  
  
Chorus  
  
Some things are lost some left behind  
Some things are better left for someone else to find  
Maybe in time I could finally see  
I just wonder wonder if you think about me  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill be thinking about you baby  
Ill be thinking about you baby baby baby
