I got a dollar in my pocket  
There aint a cloud up above  
I got a picture in a locket  
That says baby I love you  
Well if you didnt look then boys  
Then fellas dont go lookin now  
Well here she comes awalkin  
All that heaven will allow  
  
Say hey there mister bouncer  
Now all I want to do is dance  
But I swear I left my wallet  
Back home in my workin pants  
Cmon Slim slip me in man  
Ill make it up to you somehow  
I cant be late I got a date  
With all that heaven will allow  
  
Rain and storm and dark skies  
Well now they dont mean a thing  
If you got a girl that loves you  
And who wants to wear your ring  
So cmon mister trouble  
Well make it through you somehow  
Well fill this house with all the love  
All that heaven will allow  
  
Now some may want to die young man  
Young and gloriously  
Get it straight now mister  
Hey buddy that aint me  
Cause I got something on my mind  
That sets me straight and walkin proud  
And I want all the time  
All that heaven will allow
