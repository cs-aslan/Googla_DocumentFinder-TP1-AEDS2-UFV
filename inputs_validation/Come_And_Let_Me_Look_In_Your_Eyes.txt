I guess growin isnt hard to do just stand against the wall  
Once I was just two feet high  
Today Im six feet tall  
But knowin who to listen to is somethin else again  
Words just whistle around my head  
like seasons in the wind  
All across the water the clouds are sailin  
they wont let me look at the sky  
All I want to do is try to find myself  
Come and let me look in your eyes  
  
In searchin for the way to go Ive followed all the rules  
The way they say to choose between the wise men and the fools  
I listened to the words they say  
I read what I should read  
I do whatevers right to do  
Try to be what I should be  
Someone let me in I think the sky is falling  
Seems Ive gotten lost on my way  
All I want to do is try to find myself  
Come and let me look in your eyes  
But wisdom isnt underground nor on a mountainside  
Where am I to take myself theres no place here to hide Where can I hide  
All across the universe the stars are fadin seems Ive gotten lost on my way  
All I want to do is try to find myself  
Come and let me look in your eyes  
Come and let me look in your eyes  
Come and let me look in your eyes
