Raindrops keep fallin on my head  
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed  
Nothin seems to fit  
Those raindrops are fallin on my head they keep fallin  
  
So I just did me some talkin to the sun  
And I said I didnt like the way he got things done  
Sleepin on the job  
Those raindrops are fallin on my head they keep fallin  
  
But theres one thing I know  
The blues they send to meet me wont defeat me  
It wont be long till happiness steps up to greet me  
  
Raindrops keep fallin on my head  
But that doesnt mean my eyes will soon be turnin red  
Cryins not for me  
Cause Im never gonna stop the rain by complainin  
Because Im free  
Nothins worryin me  
  
It wont be long till happiness steps up to greet me  
  
Raindrops keep fallin on my head  
But that doesnt mean my eyes will soon be turnin red  
Cryins not for me  
Cause Im never gonna stop the rain by complainin  
Because Im free  
Nothins worryin me
