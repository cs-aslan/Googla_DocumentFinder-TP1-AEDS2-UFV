Ready steady gonna meet you on the ballroom floor  
Brother Eddie quit your banging on my bathroom door  
After shaving yeah and after three  
Im after having me some fun you see  
Im getting ready for the night to come  
And here i come  
  
Chorus  
Im just a hot shot hitting town  
have a little fun  
Just a hot shot getting down  
ready steady run  
Im just a hot shot looking around  
loving on the run  
Im having fun  
  
Get the recognition each and every place i go  
Fashion leader in the Cuban heel and pointed toe  
My Italian suit is pressed and clean  
Im the Latin lover of the local scene  
Im getting ready for the night to come  
  
Chorus  
  
A faded picture on the mantelshelf  
My older brother looks like myself  
Remember Donny dated Susie  
And Susie rated johnny  
Johnnys into Susie  
But Susies into Ronnie  
Ronnie waits for Louie  
But Louies singing Louie  
  
Chorus
