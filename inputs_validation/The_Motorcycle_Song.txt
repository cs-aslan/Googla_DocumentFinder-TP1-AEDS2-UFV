Chorus  
I dont want a pickle  
Just want to ride on my motorcycle  
And I dont want a tickle  
Cause Id rather ride on my motorcycle  
And I dont want to die  
I just want to ride on my motorcycle  
  
It was late last night the other day  
I thought Id go up and see Ray  
So l went up and I saw Ray  
There was only one thing Ray could say was  
  
Chorus  
  
Just last week I was on my bike  
I run into a friend named Mike  
Run into my friend named Mike  
Mike no longer has a bike He cries  
  
Chorus
