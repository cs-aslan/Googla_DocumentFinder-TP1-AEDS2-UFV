There are things that I said I would never do  
There are fears that I can not believe have come true  
For my soul is too sick and too little too late  
And myself I have grown too weary to hate  
  
The more I stay in here  
The more its not so clear  
The more I stay in here  
The more I disappear  
As far as I have gone  
I knew what side Im on  
But now Im not so sure  
The line begins to blur  
  
Theres somebody on top of me  
I dont know I dont know  
Isnt anybody stopping me  
I dont know I dont know  
I wont try and hold my breath  
I dont know I dont know  
Just how far down can I go  
I dont know I dont know  
  
As I lie here and stare  
The fabric starts to tear  
Its far beyond repair  
And I dont really care  
As far as I have gone  
I knew what side Im on  
But now Im not so sure  
The line begins to blur
