I aint got time to think about money  
Or what it can buy ah ah ah ah  
And I aint got time to sit down and wonder  
At what makes a birdie fly ah ah ah ah  
I dont have time to think about what  
Makes a flower grow  
And I never given a thought  
To where rivers flow  
Too busy thinking about my baby  
  
Oh yeah  
Aint got time for nothing else  
I aint got time to discuss the weather  
Or how long its gonna last ah ah ah ah  
And I aint got time to do no studying  
Once I get out of class ah ah ah ah  
And Im just a fella  
With a one a one track mind  
And when it comes to thinking about  
Anything but my baby  
I just dont have time  
Too busy thinking about my baby  
  
Oh yeah  
Aint got time for nothing else  
And I know its all its alright  
  
I aint got time to read a newspaper  
Or look at TV ah ah ah ah  
Cause Im not concerned with what the future holds  
In store for me ah ah ah ah  
Im just a fella  
With a one a one track mind  
And when it comes to thinking about  
Anything but my baby  
I just dont have time  
Too busy thinking about my baby  
  
Oh yeah  
Aint got time for nothing else  
You know Im too too busy  
Too busy thinking about my baby  
  
Oh yeah  
Aint got time for nothing else
