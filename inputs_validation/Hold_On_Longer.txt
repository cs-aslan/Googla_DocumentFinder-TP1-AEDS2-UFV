Broken hearts rain on our angelic flies  
But I wont run Im with you thats enough  
Kiss me now so you wont run  
  
Out of breath underwater  
Girl you can hold on longer  
Girl you can hold on longer  
Girl you can hold on longer  
Long as you want  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Love is an ocean  
Swimming and try not to drown  
Right in the waves  
Praying we dont go down  
In the undertow Ill pull you out  
  
Out of breath underwater  
Girl you can hold on longer  
I know the waves get stronger  
Girl you can hold on longer  
Long as you want  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Hold on
