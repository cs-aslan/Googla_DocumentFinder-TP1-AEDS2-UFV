Watching people roll by  
Wonder where theyre going  
Hey whats your job  
Whatre you knowing  
  
Driving to the grocery store  
Pull my money out  
Passing by the liquor store  
Throw my money down  
  
Aint life grand  
Aint life grand  
  
My wifes got the blues  
Now Ive got them  
Gonna bring her a kiss  
Make those blues run  
  
Aint life grand  
Aint life grand  
  
The sun came out the other day  
Through those dusty clouds  
And in my mind I was a child  
And it felt good  
  
Aint life grand  
Aint life grand  
Aint life grand  
Aint life grand
