All I have is strictly forbidden  
And all I have is strictly insane  
We know what we want  
But thats not always good for us  
Insanity is not always despair  
  
All I have means nothing to me  
And all I give is so much more  
When nothing is left  
Theres nothing to lose  
When theres nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind  
  
We all fall into oblivion  
And history slowly fades  
Whats done doesnt matter  
What matters not done  
All we have belongs to no one  
  
All I have means nothing to me  
And all I give is so much more  
When nothing is left  
Theres nothing to lose  
When theres nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind  
  
All I have means nothing to me  
And all I give is so much more  
When nothing is left  
Theres nothing to lose  
When theres nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind  
When theres nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind  
  
When theres nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind  
When theres nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind
