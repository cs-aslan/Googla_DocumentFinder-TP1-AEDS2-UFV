Sally dances on the floor  
She says that she cant do it anymore  
She walks down St Marks Place  
And eats natural food at my place  
  
Now Sally cant dance no more  
she cant get it off of the floor  
Sally cant dance no more  
Sally she cant dance no more  
  
Sally is losing her face  
She lives on St Marks Place  
In a rentcontrolled apartment eighty dollars a month  
She has lots of fun she has lots of fun  
  
But Sally cant dance no more  
Oh Sally she cant dance no more  
She went and carried on and cant get off of the floor  
Now Sally oh she cant dance no more  
  
She was the first girl in the neighborhood  
To wear tieddyed pants like she should  
She was the first girl that Ive ever seen  
That had flowers painted on her jeans  
Now she wears a sword like Napoleon  
And she kills the boys and acts like a son  
  
Sally cant dance no more  
Sally cant dance no more  
Sally cant dance no more  
Sally hey she cant dance no more  
Sally cant dance  
Sally cant dance  
  
She knew all the really right people  
She went to Les Jardins  
She danced with Picassos illegitimate mistress  
and wore Kenneth Lane jewels really hey its trash but  
  
Sally cant dance no more yeah  
Sally she cant dance no more you tell em about it  
Sally cant get herself off the floor  
Hey Sally girl she cant dance no more  
Sally cant dance  
Sally cant dance  
  
Sally cant dance Sally cant dance  
Sally cant dance Sally cant dance  
Sally cant dance Sally cant dance  
Sally cant dance Sally cant dance
