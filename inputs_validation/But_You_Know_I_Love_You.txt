When the mornin sun  
Streaks across my room  
And Im wakin up  
From another dream of you  
Yes you know Im on the road  
Once again it seems  
All thats left behind  
Is a chain of broken dreams  
  
But you know that I love you  
You know that I love you  
Oh I love you  
  
And how I wish that love  
Was all wed need to live  
What a life wed have  
Cause Ive got so much to give  
But ya know I feel so sad  
Down inside my heart  
That the dollar sign  
Should be keepin us apart  
  
But you know that I love you  
You know that I love you  
Oh how I love you  
  
And if only I could find my way back to the time  
When the problems of this life  
Had not yet crossed my mind  
And the answers could be found in childrens nursery rhymes  
Id come runnin back to you  
Id come runnin back to you  
  
But you know we cant  
Live on dreams alone  
Got to pay the rent  
So I must leave you all alone  
Cause you know I made my choice many years ago  
And now this travelin life  
Well its the only life I know  
  
But you know that I love you  
You know that I love you  
Oh I love you  
But you know that I love you  
You know that I love you  
Oh how I love you  
But you know that I love you  
You know that I love you  
Oh how I love you  
  
But you know I love you  
But you know I love you  
Oh I love you  
But you know that I love you  
But you know that I love you  
Oh how I love you  
But you know that I love you  
But you know that I love you  
Oh how I love you
