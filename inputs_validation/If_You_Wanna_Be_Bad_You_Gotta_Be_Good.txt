She got a nasty reputation and a talent for sin  
Shes the kinda trouble I like to be in  
I wanna be your lover  
I wanna be your slav  
Shes the kinda women makes me wanna misbehave  
So give it what you want boy  
Lets make it understood  
That if ya wanna be bad ya you gotta be good  
  
She says therell be no lying  
No foolin around  
No seven day weekends  
No nights on the town  
Well thats the way I want it  
Thats the way its gotta be  
If youre looking for trouble better get it from me  
So get on your knees boy and do what you should  
If ya wanna be bad ya gotta be good  
  
Lets make a night to remember  
From January to December  
Lets make love to excite us  
A memory to ignite us  
Lets make honey baby soft and tender  
Lets make sugar darlin sweet surrender  
Lets make a night to remember all life long
