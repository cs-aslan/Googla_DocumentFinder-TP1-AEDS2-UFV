There aint no space and time  
To keep our love alive  
We have existence and its all we share  
There aint no real truth  
There aint no real lies  
Keep on pushin cause I know its there  
  
Oh can you just tell me  
Its all right Its all right  
Let me sleep tonight  
Oh can you comfort me  
Tonight Its all right  
Make it all seem fine  
  
I just cant make it alone  
Oh no no  
I just cant make it alone  
Oh no no  
  
Therell be no lullabies  
Therell be no tears cried  
We feel numb cause we dont see  
That if we really care  
And we really loved  
Think of all the joy wed feel  
  
Oh can you just tell me  
Its all right Its all right  
Let me sleep tonight  
Oh can you comfort me  
Tonight Its all right  
Make it all seem fine  
  
I just cant make it alone  
Oh no no  
I just cant make it alone  
Oh no no  
I just cant make it alone  
Oh no no  
I just cant make it alone  
Oh no no  
  
Aint got no lullaby no no  
Aint got no lullaby oh no  
There is no space and time  
Oh lord  
There is no space and time  
Oh lord  
  
We have existence and its all we share  
We have existence and its all we share  
We have existence and its all we share  
We have existence and its all we share  
We have existence and its all we share  
Keep on pushing cause I know its there  
Keep on pushing cause I know its there  
Keep on pushing cause I know its there  
Keep on pushing cause I know its there
