Engineer Arent you a little young to build a rollercoaster  
Phineas Yes yes I am  
Eng Well I must say that Im really quite impressed  
But all your permits are in order  
Dont forget the bricks and mortar  
And if you need a power loader be my guest  
But if Im pressed   
Id say you look a little young to drive a forklift  
Phineas Yes yes I am  
Eng Its good to see a younger guy like you  
Whos creative and ambitious  
A little bigger than his britches  
And who got a fresh exciting point of view  
Yes its true  
That you seem a little young  
To do the things that you do  
Even with all the moxie youve got  
Yes you seem a little green  
To be controlling this machinery  
Phineas Yeah I get that a lot
