Hello God  
Are You out there  
Can You hear me  
Are You listenin anymore  
Hello God  
If were still on speakin terms  
Can You help me like before  
I have questioned Your existence  
My resistance leaves me cold  
Can you help me go the distance  
Hello God  
Hello  
Hello  
  
This old world has gone to pieces  
Can we fix it  
Is there time  
Hate and violence just increases  
Were so selfish cruel and blind  
We fight and kill each other  
In Your name defending You  
Do You love some more than others  
Were so lost and confused  
  
Hello God  
Are you out there  
Can you hear us  
Are you listenin anymore  
Hello God  
If were still on speakin terms  
Can You help us like before  
Oh the free will You have given  
We have made a mockery of  
This is no way to be livin  
Were in great need of Your love  
Hello God  
  
Hello hello  
Hello God  
Can You grant us  
Love enough to make amends  
Hello God  
Is there still a chance  
That we could start again  
Hello God  
Weve learned our lesson  
Dear God dont let us go  
Hello hello  
More than ever  
Hello God  
Hello  
Hello  
Hello God  
We really need You  
We cant make it without You  
Hello God  
We beseech You  
In the name of all thats true  
Hello God  
Please forgive us  
For we know not what we do  
Hello God  
Give us one more chance  
To prove ourselves to You  
Hello God  
Hello God
