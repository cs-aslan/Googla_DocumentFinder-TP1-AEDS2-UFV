I know you well  
You are a part of me  
I know you better than I know myself  
I know you best  
Better than anyone  
I know you better than I know myself  
You dont judge  
You cant speak  
You cant leave  
You cant hurt me  
Youre just here for me to use  
I know you best  
Better than one might think  
I know you better than I know myself  
Its time for you  
To make a sacrifice  
Its time to die a little  
Give it up  
You are a part of me
