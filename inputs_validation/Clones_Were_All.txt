Im a clone  
I know it and Im fine  
Im one and more are on the way  
Im two doctor  
Threes on the line  
Hell take incubation another day  
CHORUS Im all alone so are we all  
Were all clones  
All are one and one are all  
All are one and one are all  
We destroyed the government  
Were destroying time  
No more problems on the way  
  
REFRAIN Im through doctor  
We dont need your kind  
The other ones  
Ugly ones  
Stupid boys  
Wrong ones  
CHORUS  
Six is having problems  
Adjusting to his clone status  
Have to put him on a shelf  
Please dont put me on the shelf  
All day long we hear him crying so loud  
I just want to be myself  
I just want to be myself  
I just want to be myself  
Be myself  
Be myself  
  
Im all alone so are we all  
We destroyed the government  
Were destroyed time  
No more problems on the way  
REFRAIN  
CHORUS  
Im all alone so are we all  
Were all clones  
All are one and one are all  
All are one and one are all
