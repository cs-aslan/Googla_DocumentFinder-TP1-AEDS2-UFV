I just blew in from the windy city  
The windy city is mighty pretty  
But they aint got what we got no sirree  
Theyve got shacks up to seven storeys  
Never see any Morning Glorys  
But a step from our doorway  
We got em for free  
  
Theyve got those minstrel shows  
Pretty ladies in the big chapeauxs  
Private lawns public parks  
For the sake of civic virtue  
Theyve got fountains there that squirt you  
  
I just blew in from the windy city  
The windy city is mighty pretty  
But they aint got what we got  
Im tellin ya boys  
We got more life in Deadwood City  
Than in all of Illinois  
  
You shoulda seen me awindo shoppin  
Awindo shoppin with eyes apoppin  
At the sights that you see there yes sirree  
Press a bell and a moment later  
Up you go in an elevator  
Just as fast as a polecat aclimbin a tree  
  
I heard claim hundreds came  
To a thing they call a baseball game  
Cigar stores revolving doors  
They got new inventions coming  
Stead of outdoor indoor plumbing  
  
I just blew in from the windy city  
The windy city is mighty pretty  
But they aint got what we got  
Im tellin ya boys  
I aint aswappin half of Deadwood  
For the whole of Illinois
