You say your dreams are burned to ashes  
And your smiles have turned to tears  
It seems to me you welcome sanest  
As you surrender to your fears  
  
So whats a man like me supposed to do  
When all I want is just to make love to you  
  
Dont turn away before the night is over  
Dont turn away before the night is gone  
Dont turn away the night may hold the answer  
So dont turn away before the night  
Before the night is gone  
  
You say your heart is lost forever  
And youre always gonna give your love in vain  
So you paint yourself a lonely portrait  
And hide your love away again  
  
You turn away from what you feel inside  
You cant forget all your foolish pride  
  
Dont turn away before the night is over  
Dont turn away before the night is gone  
Dont turn away the night may hold the answer  
So dont turn away before the night is gone  
  
So now Im asking you this question  
Am I gonna give you all my love in vain  
Do you want to drown in your own sorrow  
Or are you gonna try to love again  
  
Dont turn away from what you feel inside  
You should try to forget about all your foolish pride  
  
Dont turn away before the night is over  
Dont turn away before the night is gone  
Dont turn away the night may hold the answer  
So dont turn away before the night  
Before the night  
Before the night is gone  
  
Dont turn away from me baby  
No no no no  
Dont put me away  
Dont walk away from me darling  
I need your love  
Oh baby  
I need your love to rescue me  
An Im coming for you baby
