Now when I learned to play the ukulele  
I used to practice day and night  
My pals all roared as I fumbled at a chord  
But I couldnt get the darned thing right  
  
They laughed when I started to play they laughed so hearty  
Only two lessons I had I went up the scale and down the scale  
It wasnt so bad  
But one chap he said Oh what a mug why you cant learn that way  
He took the uke off me and said Now Ill have a try  
Just then the g string bust and flew right into his eye  
He laughed when I started to play but he didnt laugh again all day  
  
Oh they laughed when I started to play oh they laughed so hearty  
Strip poker thats a good game  
Once I lost my trousers to a gambling dame  
But when I started shuffling the cards then the luck came my way  
I won a frock and undies she was left I declare  
As bare as any savage and as savages are bear  
She laughed when I started to play  
But she didnt laugh again that day  
  
Now once I watched a game of water polo  
With players from a ladies school  
The girls all cried Wont you make up a side  
So I dashed into the bathing pool  
They laughed when I started to play oh how they laughed so hearty  
In goal I paddled about a big ball in the water soon I started to clout  
Each time that it came bobbing back well I smacked it away  
Just then the ball turned over and a girl said No larks  
Seven times youve hit me where I cant show the marks  
She laughed when I started to play  
But she didnt laugh again that day
