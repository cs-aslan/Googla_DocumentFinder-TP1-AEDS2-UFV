Im far from home  
And tired of this place  
I miss your good good love  
And your sweet embrace  
Cant sleep at night  
With you on my mind  
I just want to run to you baby  
Leave it all behind  
  
Cause it seems so long  
Since I heard your song  
Im coming home to you baby  
Back where I belong  
  
Your precious love  
Thats all I need  
Angel spread your wings  
And bring it on home to me  
  
Sometimes in my life  
I dont know what to do  
Tho Im weak for myself  
I try to be strong for you  
Youre there when I need you  
After all these years  
So I send you this letter baby  
Written in tears  
  
Cause it seems so long  
Since I heard your song  
Im coming home to you baby baby  
Back where I belong  
  
Your precious love  
Thats all I need  
Angel spread your wings  
And bring it on home to me  
  
Cause it seems so long  
Since I heard your song  
Im coming home to you baby  
Back where I belong  
  
Your precious love  
Thats all I need  
Angel spread your wings  
And bring it bring it bring on home  
  
Your precious love your precious love  
Thats all that I need  
Angel spread your wings and  
Bring it bring it bring on home  
Bring it baby baby thats all I want
