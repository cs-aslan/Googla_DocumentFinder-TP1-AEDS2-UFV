Throw your hands in the sky nigga  
Im stickin ice picks on the tip of ya dick  
Give your testicles a swift kick aint that some shit  
Am I hard hard core harder than a Plymouth  
It aint no myth its a nigga with the spliff  
And a chrome four fifth pressed on ya back  
So what you want nigga How you wanna act  
I hope civilized cause I love to see niggaz die  
Brains all leakin out on the street  
And the pastor preachin He was a good man  
Played the bad man when the burner was in his hand  
Now hes singin sad songs with Elvis  
Three to the head bout six cross the pelvis  
Ya fuck with the high guy ya die  
Yeah the same motherfucker yellin Look up in the sky  
Im on some old neck shit Suplex shit hardcore sex shit and Tec shit  
  
Chorus

A repetitive loop  
All I need to destroy a soloist or group  
Huh I put it to ya boy  
Hope you got the scoop  
Biggie Smalls the rap genius  
I keep the glock by the penis the cleanest cut  
Fuck the sluts with the big humongous butts  
Huh I use a rubber but  
My style is gushy like the hookers pussy  
And it dont take a lot of back talk to push me  
Into flamin em like that little nigga Damien  
Pop 19 to my motherfuckin cranium  
Game tight gun totin motherfucker  
Niggaz in the grave thought Biggie was a sucker  
I tricked em I gave em work then I sticked em  
I stripped em cause niggaz dont want the friction  
Told you before how I bring the drama  
Slam Larry Johnson and his Grandmama  
  
Chorus  
  
Aye yo  
Time to bring em back  
Yeah
