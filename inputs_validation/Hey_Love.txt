Hey love  
May I have a word with you  
Id like to tell you yeah  
Just what Ive been going through  
My nights are so long  
As I watch each hour go by  
Hoping and praying  
That someday I will be your guy  
  
Hey love  
Youre my one true soul desire  
Hey love baby  
Can you feel this burning fire  
  
Hey love  
Theres one thing I find so true  
When you are near me  
I go through a change or two  
Hearing your footsteps  
I hurry to catch your eye  
And I stand there waiting yeah  
But girl you just walk on by  
  
Say love  
With a cold heart you are dealing  
Hey love yeah  
Its an awful hurting feeling  
  
Hey love  
Dont pass me without some sign  
Just look me over yeah  
I want to change your mind
