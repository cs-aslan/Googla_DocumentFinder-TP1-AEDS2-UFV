Cmon everybody yeah  
I said lets play a game  
I betcha I can make a rhyme  
Out of anybodys name  
  
The first letter of the name  
Ill treat it like it wasnt there  
But if a B or an F ever will appear  
Then I say a for and a fi and I say the name  
Banana fano and for  
And then I say the name again  
  
And I say the name again  
With an M this time  
There isnt a name  
That I cant rhyme  
  
Arnold Arnold bo barnold  
Banana fano for farnold  
Fe fi mo marnold  
arnold  
  
But if the first two letters  
Are ever the same  
Drop them both  
And say the name  
  
Like Bob Bob drop the B spells ob  
or Fran Fran drop the F spells ran  
or Mary Mary drop the M spells ary  
Thats the only rule that is contrary  
  
Now lets say Divi Divi  
Now Divi with a B Bivi  
Then banana fana for banana fana for  
Then you say the name again with an F very plain Fivi  
Fe fi then mo and fe fi then mo  
Then you say the name again with an M this time Mivi  
  
And there isnt any name that I cant rhyme  
Now do Divi
