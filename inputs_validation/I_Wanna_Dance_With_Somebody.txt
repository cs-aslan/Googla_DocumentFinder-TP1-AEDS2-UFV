Clock strikes upon the hour  
And the sun begins to fade  
Still enough time to figure out  
How to chase my blues away  
Ive done alright up to now  
Its the light of day that shows me how  
And when the night falls loneliness calls  
  
Chorus  
Oh I wanna dance with somebody  
I wanna feel the heat with somebody  
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody  
With somebody who loves me  
Oh I wanna dance with somebody  
I wanna feel the heat with somebody  
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody  
With somebody who loves me  
  
Ive been in love and lost my senses  
Spinning through the town  
Sooner or later the fever ends  
And I wind up feeling down  
I need a man wholl take a chance  
On a love that burns hot enough to last  
So when the night falls  
My lonely heart calls  
  
Chorus  
Oh I wanna dance with somebody  
I wanna feel the heat with somebody  
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody  
With somebody who loves me  
Oh I wanna dance with somebody  
I wanna feel the heat with somebody  
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody  
With somebody who loves me  
  
Somebody oo Somebody oo  
Somebody who loves me yeah  
Somebody oo Somebody oo  
To hold me in his arms oh  
I need a man wholl take a chance  
On a love that burns hot enough to last  
So when the night falls  
My lonely heart calls  
  
Chorus  
Oh I wanna dance with somebody  
I wanna feel the heat with somebody  
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody  
With somebody who loves me  
Oh I wanna dance with somebody  
I wanna feel the heat with somebody  
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody  
With somebody who loves me  
  
Dontcha wanna dance with me baby  
Dontcha wanna dance with me boy  
Hey Dontcha wanna dance with me baby  
With somebody who loves me  
  
Dontcha wanna dance say you wanna dance  
Dontcha wanna dance  
Dontcha wanna dance say you wanna dance  
Dontcha wanna dance  
Dontcha wanna dance say you wanna dance  
With somebody who loves me  
Dance
