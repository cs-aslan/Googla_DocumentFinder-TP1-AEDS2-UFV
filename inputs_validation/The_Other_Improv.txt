Its an alliance  
Its another lie Id say  
  
Fall in love tonight  
Even if my eyes  
Even though sometime  
Im burning out tonight  
  
Its another thing that Ill write  
Feeling like Ill die by myself  
Why  
  
Its mad enough tonight  
And for its never cold  
  
Its not a right  
When I can nevermind  
Its all mine  
Its all mine  
Inside I hide  
  
But Id never mind  
  
Then I said  
Minerals will make The world  
If we did not have chemicals  
You would not be writing my  
Death  
Certificate  
  
Fighting is my friend  
My dog left me  
Yes Im sad  
One more day then I can climb inside safe from you  
  
Fighting isnt my friend  
When I will never have my friend  
Fighting silence as a friend  
Im silent and I cant turn it around  
  
And she improvised  
Cause she was supervised  
And I was idolized  
I was idolized  
For those For those For those  
I was aroused and fucked  
  
Finally  
And I  
Was in my trap  
And I  
Another guy  
And a knife  
  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
Its hard and boiled  
  
And sour all again  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
It revolves it revolves  
It revolves and around  
And over all  
Liver and bones  
Liver and bones  
Liver and bones  
Liver and bones  
With the Ramones  
Come out and smile  
And Ill watch when  
  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your  
My milk is your  
My milk is your shit  
  
My milk is it  
Psst Got to get all of it  
Cause I cant fight
