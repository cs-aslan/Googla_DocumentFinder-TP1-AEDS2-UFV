Well I got no worry and I got no pain  
Cause when I get rid of them they come back again  
I just keep on doing what I want to do  
If I keep on trying Im sure to come through  
  
Well moneys no problem it comes and it goes  
It stops me from starving it keeps me in clothes  
Theres a God and a devil Im sure it must be  
But why should I bother them they dont bother me  
  
So Ill keep on playing and do what I do  
These strings on my fingers are all that is true
