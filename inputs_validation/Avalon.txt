Evry morning memries stray  
Across the sea where flying fishes play  
And as the night is falling  
I find that Im recalling  
That blissful all enthralling day  
  
Just before I sailed away  
She said the word I longed to hear her say  
I tenderly caressed her  
Close to my heart I pressed her  
Upon that golden yesterday  
  
I found my love in Avalon  
Beside the bay  
I left my love in Avalon and sailed away  
I dream of her and Avalon  
From dusk til dawn  
And so I think Ill travel on  
To Avalon
