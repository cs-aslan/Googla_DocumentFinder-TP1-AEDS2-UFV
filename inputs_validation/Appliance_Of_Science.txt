Come into the parish of wisdom  
But leave your nervous system  
With the bouncer on the door  
Sell your innocence  
For a decade of decadence  
Everything all at once all the time is yours  
  
Dont believe in Jesus Christ  
Since I believed in your cocaine  
All that praying and wailing will leave a stain  
So take your Sunday songs and shove it  
  
Hey now my baby maybe now were free  
With the appliance of science  
We can be anyone we want to be  
  
Theyll come bearing you  
And charge the earth for it  
If youre lucky theyll let you breathe  
So scream as you go faster  
If thats the world youre after  
But make sure youre home for tea  
  
Dont believe in clever people  
Clever people drop the bomb  
Dont believe your big and evil theyre aliens  
So take your rocket science and shove it  
  
Hey now my baby maybe now were free  
With the appliance of science  
We can be anyone we want to be  
  
We interrupt this song for a newsflash  
Daisy the first sheep to be cloned  
Has died today at the rivaled age of 101 days  
Other news  
Two people burned to death whilst they were on the internet  
And now to the sport  
  
Hey now my baby maybe now were free  
With the appliance of science  
We can be anyone we want to be  
  
Hey now my baby maybe now were free  
With the appliance of science  
We can be anyone we want to be  
  
Hey now my baby maybe now were free  
With the appliance of science  
We can be anyone we want to be
