I tried to disappear  
But your the only reason Im floating here  
Eyes painted crystal clear  
I can see our future through the atmosphere  
  
Dont you go no dont you go  
Dont you know Im up here alone  
Yeah I am like a satellite  
Sending you a signal tonight  
  
Oh oh oh like a streak of light  
Oh oh oh watch the world fly by  
Oh oh oh rev your engine up  
Everybodys racing at the speed of love  
  
You were so hard to find  
With oh so many clouds across my summer sky  
You my constellation prize  
Yeah every single star is sparkling in your eyes  
  
So dont you go no dont you go  
Cause dont you know Im up here alone  
So high like a satellite  
Im sending you a signal tonight  
Oh oh oh like a streak of light  
Oh oh oh watch the world fly by  
Oh oh oh rev your engine up  
Everybodys racing at the speed of love  
  
Oh oh oh like a streak of light  
Oh oh oh watch the world fly by  
Oh oh oh rev your engine up  
Everybodys racing at the speed of love  
  
One track one mind one race to win  
One start one heart one life to live  
One track one mind one race to win  
One start one heart one life to live  
  
Oh oh oh like a streak of light  
Oh oh oh watch the world fly by  
Oh oh oh rev your engine up  
Everybodys racing at the speed of love  
  
Oh oh oh like a streak of light  
Oh oh oh watch the world fly by  
Oh oh oh rev your engine up  
Everybodys racing at the speed of love
