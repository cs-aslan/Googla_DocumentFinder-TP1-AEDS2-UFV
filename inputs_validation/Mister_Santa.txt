Mister Santa  
Bring me some toys  
Bring merry Christmas  
To all girls and boys  
And every night  
Ill go to sleep singing  
And dream about  
The presents youll be bringing  
Santa  
Promise me please  
Give every reindeer  
A hug and a squeeze  
Ill be good  
As good can be  
Mister Santa  
Dont forget me  
  
Mister Santa  
Dear old saint nick  
Be awful careful  
And please dont get sick  
Put on your coat  
When breezes are blowin  
And when you cross the street  
Look where youre goin  
Santa  
Weve been so good  
Weve washed the dishes  
And done what we should  
Made up the beds  
Scrubbed up our toesies  
Weve used a Kleenex  
When weve blown our noseies  
Oh Santa  
Look at our ears  
Theyre clean as whistles  
Were sharper then shears  
Now weve put you on the spot  
Mister Santa  
Bring us a lot
