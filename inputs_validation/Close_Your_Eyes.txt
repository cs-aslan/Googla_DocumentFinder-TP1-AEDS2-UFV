I watch you sleep  
youre everything I hoped for  
But never dreamed of finding  
I cant believe that all Ive ever wanted  
Is lying here beside me  
Hold me now theres a beacon  
And it shines in me like gold  
Tonight for it cannot be  
Denied in me so  
Hold me now I can see a new horizon  
In my soul  
So lose control  
  
Close your eyes and dream  
youre safe within my arms tonight  
And this love will last a lifetime  
Everything we need  
Is ours under the stars tonight  
Every wish is my command  
The words that lie behind your eyes  
Mean everything to me  
So Ill hold you while you  
Close your eyes and dream  
  
youre safe with me  
Ill chase away the nightmares  
Ill shield you til the storm  
Runs and you will see  
Ill always leave a light there  
To burn until the dawn comes  
  
Hold me now theres a beacon  
And it shines in me like gold  
Tonight for it cannot be  
Denied in me so  
Hold me now I can see a new horizon  
In my soul  
I wont let go  
  
Close your eyes and dream  
youre safe within my arms tonight  
And this love will last a lifetime  
Everything we need  
Is ours under the stars tonight  
Every wish is my command  
The words that lie behind your eyes  
Mean everything to me  
So Ill hold you while you  
Close your eyes and dream
