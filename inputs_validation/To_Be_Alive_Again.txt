Doin timewhere it takes you  
You know its time that can break you  
We get caught in the moment  
Just sleepwalkin most of our lives  
In your mind when you need it  
With a song to help you believe it  
You can reinvent your world  
Anytime you like  
  
Chorus  
To be alive again  
Wakin up from where youve been  
Younger now than you were then  
Youre comin round again  
Do you remember when  
Life was so much simpler then  
Like summer nights that never end  
To be alive again  
  
Find the smile youve been missin  
Theres someone that you could be kissin  
So open your eyes and youll see  
Whats been there all along  
  
Chorus  
  
To be alive again  
  
Youre not among the walkin wounded anymore  
Theres a time to fall  
Theres a time to rise above it all  
  
Chorus  
  
To be alive again  
To be alive again
