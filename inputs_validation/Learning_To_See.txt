The loss that you feel I know that its real  
Its so hard when love is blind  
You put your heart on the line  
Now you feel like Im wasting your time  
  
But I know that someday somehow youll learn to love  
I know ooh  
  
chorus  
Im learning to see  
But I dont have glasses  
You broke every heart  
By the masses  
Im learning to see  
Im learning to see  
  
That you werent meant for me oh  
They said our love was out of sight  
But you smashed my heart in two  
And that just wasnt right ooh  
Cause at the end of the day you could just walk away  
When you find what you want isnt even the thing you need  
I know uh huh  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
And all that youve lost its not all that youve gained no  
Theres something thats left behind uh huh  
If theres a tear in your eye  
There will be a blue sky  
Remember  
The time of your life  
When you were learning to see ooh
