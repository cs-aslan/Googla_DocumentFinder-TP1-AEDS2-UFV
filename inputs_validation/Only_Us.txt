Only Us  
  
It wasnt in the words that kept sticking in their throats  
It wasnt with the angels in their quilted coats  
These battered wings still kick up dust  
Seduced by the noise and the bright things that glisten  
I knew all the time I should shut up and listen  
And Im finding my way home from the great escape  
  
Chorus  
  
The further on I go oh the less I know  
I can find only us breathing  
Only us sleeping  
Only us dreaming  
Only us  
  
I hear you calling me  
Yes I hear you calling me  
Home from the great escape  
Yes I can read you loud and clear  
  
The further on I go oh the less I know  
Friend or foe theres only us  
  
Im coming home again home again  
And I hear you calling me home again  
I am coming home again  
  
Only us
