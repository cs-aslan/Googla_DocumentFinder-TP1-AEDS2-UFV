Death be my mistress guns be my wife  
Breath is my witness and roads are my life  
Just give my futures clean as a knife  
Far on the way from LA  
  
The sun heats the saddle sand in my hair  
Looking for water and theres sweat everywhere  
Know that Im nearer I smell damp air  
I aint tasted coffee for days  
  
When the leaves are down Ill be southward bound  
Hunters hunt the outsider  
When the wind grows cold when the sun grows old  
Nothing holds the outsider  
  
Just killed a man in a town called Nightfall  
Damned if I cant remember it all  
My hand it was shaking but his talk it was tall  
I paid for the funeral crew  
And it seems like I never reach Mexico  
Theyre heading me off every place that I go  
Im sick of the fact that Ive got to lay low  
What else can an outsider do  
  
I know theyre near to me I dont have to see  
Just let me be the outsider  
They aint far behind theyre always on my mind  
They wont find the outsider  
The outsider  
  
When the leaves are down Ill be southward bound  
Hunters haunt the outsider  
When the wind grows cold when the sun grows old  
Nothing holds the outsider  
The outsider The outsider
