All my life Ive never stopped to worry bout a thing  
Open up and shout it outan never try to sing  
Wondering if Ive done it wrong  
Will this depression last for longwont you tell me  
Where have all the good times gone  
Where have all the good times gone  
Where have all the good times gone  
Once we had an easy ride and always felt the same  
Time was on our side and we had everything to gain  
This could be like yesterday  
Is this me with your happy days  
Where have all the good times gone  
Where have all the good times gone  
Where have all the good times gone  
Ma and pa look back on all the things they used to do  
Never had no money and they always told the truth  
Daddy didnt need no little toys  
Mommy didnt need no little boyswont you tell me  
Where have all the good times gone  
Where have all the good times gone  
Where have all the good times gone  
Ow  
Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play  
Ah but then lets face itthings are easier today  
Yes you need some bringing down  
Get your feet back on the ground  
Where have all the good times gone  
Where have all the good times gone  
Where have all the good times gone  
Where have all the good times gone  
Where have all the good times gone
