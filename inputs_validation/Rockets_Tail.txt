That Novenber night looking up into the sky  
You said Hey wish that was me up there  
Its the biggest rocket I could find  
And its holding the night in its arms  
If for only a moment  
I cant see the look in its eyes  
But Im sure it must be laughing  
But it seemed to me the saddest thing Id ever seen  
And I thought you were crazy wishing such a thing  
  
I saw only a stick on fire  
Alone on its journey  
Home to the quickening ground  
With no one there to catch it  
  
I put on my pointed hat  
And my black and silver suit  
And I check my gunpowder pack  
And I strap the stick on my back  
And dressed as a rocket on Waterloo Bridge  
Nobody seemed to see me  
Then with the fuse in my hand  
And now shooting into the night  
And still as a rocket  
I land in the river  
  
Was it me said you were crazy  
I put on my cloudiest suit  
Size 5 lightening boots too  
Coz I am a rocket  
On fire  
Look at me go with my tail on fire  
With my tail on fire  
On fire  
Hey look at me go look at me
