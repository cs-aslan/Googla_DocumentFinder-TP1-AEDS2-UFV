Weve got trouble thats for sure  
We got millions unemployed  
Some kids cant write  
Some kids cant read  
Some kids are hungry  
Some overeat  
  
Our TV leader boldly speaks  
The words of Christ he tries to preach  
We need more power to hold the line  
The strength of darkness still abides  
  
Must be hell living in the world  
Living in the world like you  
Must be hell living in the world  
Suffering in the world like you  
  
Keep in a straight line stay in tune  
No need to worry only fools  
End up in prison of conscience cells  
Or in asylums they help to build  
  
Must be hell living in the world  
Suffering in the world like you you you you  
Must be hell living in the world  
Suffering in the world like you  
Must be hell  
Suffering in the world like you  
  
Were free to worship were free to speak  
Were free to kill thats guaranteed  
We got our problems thats for sure  
Clean up the backyard dont lock the door  
  
Must be hell living in the world  
Suffering in the world like you  
Must be hell living in the world  
Suffering in the world like you  
  
I say we we are heaven bound  
I say we we are heaven bound  
I say we we are heaven bound  
  
I say we we are heaven bound  
I say we we are heaven bound
