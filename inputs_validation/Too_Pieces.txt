Write me a letter a face in the hall  
Hiding from someone afraid of the fall  
And shes waiting for someone to take her back to where she came from  
And shell wait alone for hours she wont mind because theres someone  
In the story she remembers she remembers in the letter  
And the tears locked up inside her make her heart break open wider  
Shuts her eyes and takes the picture from the wall
