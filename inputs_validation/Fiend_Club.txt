We wont pretend that this is the end  
Were not losers all of the time  
We march and we fall  
Were one and for all  
Its just evil all of the time  
All the time  
  
We are the fiend club  
We are the fiend club  
We are the fiend club  
Not you Not you  
  
You dress so messed up  
Your hair is too long  
But Im changing all of the time  
We march and we fall  
Were one and for all  
Its just evil all of the time  
All of the time  
Evil all the time  
  
We are the fiend club  
We are the fiend club  
We are the fiend club  
Not you Not you  
  
We are the fiend club
