If I ever get back home again  
If I ever get back to you  
I wont care if the sun never shines  
Youre all I want to do  
  
All that lays in front of us  
Wont get left behind  
Cause I can see just fine around you  
Sorry Im not colorblind  
I can see just fine  
Youre all I wanna do  
I can see just fine around you  
Youre all I ever wanted to do  
Maybe Im just colorblind  
I can see just fine  
Youre all I wanted to  
Sorry Im just blind around you  
All I want is you  
  
If I ever get back home tonight  
If I ever get lost in you  
I wont care if the moon never shines  
Youre all I wanna do  
  
All that lays in front of us  
Wont get left behind  
Cause I can see just fine around you  
Sorry Im not colorblind  
I can see just fine  
Youre all I wanna do  
I can see just fine around you  
Youre all I ever wanted to do  
Maybe Im just colorblind  
I can see just fine  
Youre all I wanted to  
Sorry Im just blind around you  
All I want is you  
  
Sorry Im not colorblind  
I can see just fine  
I can see just fine around you  
Maybe Im just colorblind  
I can see just fine  
Sorry Im just blind around you
