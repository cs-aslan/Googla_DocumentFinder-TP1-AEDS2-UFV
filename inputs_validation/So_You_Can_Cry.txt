So its over  
Hes with someone else and you know her  
And you just can get any lower  
You sit in the dark alone  
And wont answer your phone  
Well Im sorry I want to attend your pity party  
I rather go have calamari  
And maybe a drink  
And yes I think  
You should come with me  
  
Life is long  
There will be pain but life goes on  
With everyday a brand new song  
But if you rather stay at home  
Let me do you a favor  
  
Chorus  
Ill ask the sun to shine away from you today so you can cry  
If thats what you want  
Ill ask the clouds to bring the rain for you today so you can cry  
If thats what you want alright  
Oh If thats what you want alright  
  
Ima Lover  
And the pain of a heart from another  
Can be difficult to recover  
Yes this I know  
But difficult isnt impossible  
And you shiver Shiver  
He was your warmth  
You Cry Lips Quiver  
Well honey go on cry me a river  
You wanna be down you wanna be down  
Fine let me help you out  
How bout  
  
Chorus  
  
And your tears wont bring him back  
I know you wish that it did  
But it just dont work like that  
Oh I know that healings takes time  
Hey even your heart has a pace  
Oh but how much time are you gonna take  
Hmm too much will be a mistake  
  
Chorus
