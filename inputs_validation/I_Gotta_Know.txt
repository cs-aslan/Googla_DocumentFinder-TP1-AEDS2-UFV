Well I thought that you were a wantin romance  
But all you ever do is dance dance dance  
So I boppity bop the whole night long to the knocked out music of a jukebox
song  
One thing I gotta know I gotta know I gotta know  
If our loves the real thing wheres my weddin ring  
Yes we rocked and rolled till the broad daylight  
Youre a little too pooped to kiss your baby goodnight  
I know youve had it when the rockin is through  
So I let you go home what else could I do  
One thing I gotta know  
  
Well I thought that you were a wantin romance  
When youre on that floor youre cool man cool  
But when it comes to lovin you need to go to school  
You know Im longin for a weddin day but all you ever do is play boy play  
One thing I gotta know
