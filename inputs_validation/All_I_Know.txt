For all I know you could be near  
And every breath I take you could feel  
For all I know youre just a thought that crossed my mind  
What I wouldnt give to live that thought of mine  
  
For all I know is nothings changed  
Nothing ever will if I dont leave this place  
For all I know youre waiting for me to whisper your name  
What I wouldnt give to kiss your sweet face  
  
Cause all I know is I need you here  
And all I have I would give away so I could say this dear  
All I feel oh I tried so hard to not feel  
Its killing me  
  
For all I know you forgot me  
For all I know youre different completely  
And everything we had was never what I thought it was  
But for all I know oh it was love  
  
cause all I know is I need you here  
All I have I would give away to so I could say this dear  
All I feel oh I tried so hard to not feel  
Its killing me  
  
Now everyone has a name  
And every face always somehow looks the same  
I always feel so alone especially when it rains  
For all I know boy you do the same yeah  
  
Yeah I didnt know that I need you here  
All I had I gave away cause I was still afraid to feel  
All I feel oh I tried so hard to not feel  
Its killing me its killing me  
  
All I know  
All I know  
For all I know
