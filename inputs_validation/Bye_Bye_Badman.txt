Soak me to my skin  
Will you drown me in your sea  
Submission ends and I begin  
Choke me smoke the air  
In this citrus sucking sunshine  
I dont care youre not all there  
  
Every backbone and heart you break  
Will still come back for more  
Submission ends it all  
  
Here he go  
Got no question got no love  
Im throwing stones at you man  
I want you black and blue and  
Im gonna make you bleed  
Gonna bring you down to your knees  
Bye bye badman ooh bye bye  
  
Choke me smoke the air  
In this citrus sucking sunshine  
I dont care youre not all there  
  
Youve been bought and paid  
Youre a whore and slave  
Your docks no holy shrine  
Come taste the end youre mine  
  
Here he go  
Got no question got no love  
Im throwing stones at you man  
I want you black and blue and  
Im gonna make you bleed  
Gonna bring you down to your knees  
Bye bye badman ooh bye bye  
  
Ive got bad intention  
I intend to knock you down  
These stones I throw  
Oh these French kisses  
Are the only way I found  
  
Ive got bad intention  
I intend to knock you down  
These stones I throw  
Oh these French kisses  
Are the only way I found
