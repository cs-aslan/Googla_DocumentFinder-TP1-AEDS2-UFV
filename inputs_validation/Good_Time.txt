Whoauhoh  
Its always a good time  
Whoauhoh  
Its always a good time  
  
Woke up on the right side of the bed  
Whats up with this Prince song inside my head  
Hands up if youre down to get down tonight  
Cause its always a good time  
  
Slept in all my clothes like I didnt care  
Hopped into a cab take me anywhere  
Im in if youre down to get down tonight  
Cause its always a good time  
  
Good morning and good night  
Ill wake up at twilight  
Its gonna be alright  
We dont even have to try  
Its always a good time Whooo  
  
Whoaohoh ohohoh whoaohoh  
Its always a good time  
Whoaohoh ohohoh  
We dont even have to try its always a good time  
  
Freaked out dropped my phone in the pool again  
Checked out of my room hit the ATM  
Lets hang out if youre down to get down tonight  
Cause its always a good time  
  
Good morning and good night  
Ill wake up at twilight  
Its gonna be alright  
We dont even have to try  
Its always a good time Whooo  
  
Whoaohoh ohohoh whoaohoh  
Its always a good time  
Whoaohoh ohohoh  
We dont even have to try  
Its always a good time  
  
Whoaohoh ohohoh whoaohoh  
Its always a good time  
Whoaohoh ohohoh  
We dont even have to try  
Its always a good time  
  
Doesnt matter when  
Its always a good time then  
Doesnt matter where  
Its always a good time there  
  
Doesnt matter when  
Its always a good time then  
  
Its always a good time  
  
Whoaohoh ohohoh whoaohoh  
Its always a good time  
Whoaohoh ohohoh  
We dont even have to try  
Its always a good time  
  
Whoaohoh ohohoh whoaohoh  
Its always a good time  
Whoaohoh ohohoh  
We dont even have to try  
Its always a good time
