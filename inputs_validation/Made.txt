Ever since my early teens Ive been a loc on these streets  
Gold is for twenty four I go for broke on these streets  
My flow is a young Mike Tyson I put the hit on niggas  
And even when Im countin off I still spit on niggaz  
No super friends I smoke purple stuff alone in my room  
That cush made me leave my body I was gone in my room  
Mad swangas to mo no blocks I switch cars like socks  
Either its somethin with the roof missin or a hard white top  
  
Remember me Im the one they laughed at in all my classes  
Now what they spend on a house I blow on designer glasses  
Even without a platinum plaque this aint cappin  
Im just tellin you what my life like so this aint rappin  
Dont you ever tell the captain that my money aint right  
Im a have to pay money to spray money cause money aint right  
No more throwin no bodies so I can stand on these streets  
I got an army behind me cause Im the man on these streets  
  
I did some time locked down but now Im back on these streets  
Here to save yall from all this wack rap on these streets  
I left yall with Im still livin provin I wasnt dead  
If you wonder why Im out early my lawyer got his bread  
Much love to my industry homies who didnt forget about me  
Paul Wall Pimp C and my partner Fliperaci  
  
But since I do business with Rap A Lot the feds watch me  
But Im like Shaq up under the backboards you cant stop me  
When I was hustlin no police could find a rock near me  
Now that I aint hustlin they can see all of my rocks clearly  
B S foldas ava smokas these are of Joseph  
Known to catch you in the club flee and make women wanna come closer  
Homie dont get it twisted cause you see me on a poster  
You disrespect me the magnum come out the holsta like its sposed ta  
  
  man on these streets  
I dont give a fuck cause Im the man on these streets  
Im a hitman whatever Im aimin at I hit man  
After I hit her she cant stand up without a kickstand  
Not a special kind of fool just hit her with the mule  
If she find the itch to set me up Ill hit her with the tool  
I got a daughter to raise I aint tryin to leave  
Plus all this money Im makin you think I aint tryin to breathe  
Inhale exhale now thats better  
Over eight hundred thousand independent now thats cheddar
