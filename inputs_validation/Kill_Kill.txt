Bound up the stairs  
Im in the shower  
Do you know I am going to leave you  
Do you know I am going to leave you  
  
Im in love with a dying man  
Im in love with a dying man  
All our love is flying in the sand  
Im in love with a dying man  
Im in love with a dying man  
Ive done every thing I can  
  
Tell me about Brian and his girl  
Do I know Brian is going to meet you  
Love you I do  
Stay here I wont  
As stars fade from your eyes  
  
Im in love with a dying man  
Im in love with a dying man  
All our love is flying in the sand  
Im in love with a dying man  
Im in love with a dying man  
Ive done every thing I can  
  
One two make it fun  
Dont trust anyone  
One two make it fun  
Dont trust anyone  
  
Im in love with a dying man  
Im in love with a dying man  
I have done every thing I can  
Im in love with a dying man  
Im in love with a dying man  
I have done every thing I can  
  
One two make it fun  
Dont trust anyone  
One two make it fun  
Make it fun
