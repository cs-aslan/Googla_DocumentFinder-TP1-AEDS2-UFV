I miss you  
And I wonder how you feel about me too  
Do you miss the way we were  
And how we used to be  
Suddenly  
Were apart and I cant see you everynight  
Do miss the way we loved  
And I cant feel your touch  
  
Oooo girlfriend  
Thats the end  
And Im lost without your love  
Oh love  
  
In your arms  
I was happy as a little boy could be  
Taking pills and medicine  
Now I just want to shout  
For you love  
Cause Im drifting further from you every day  
Driving by your place every night  
I used to feel all right  
  
Oooo girlfriend  
Thats the end  
And Im lost without your love  
Oh love  
  
Feeling ancy every night  
When I dream to be all right  
Oh love  
Oh love  
  
Ooo girlfriend  
Thats the end  
And Im lost with out your love  
Oh love  
  
In your arms  
I was happy as a little boy could be  
Taking pills and medicine  
Now I just want to shout  
La la la la la la la la la  
Now I just want to shout  
La la la la la la la la la  
Now I just want to shout
