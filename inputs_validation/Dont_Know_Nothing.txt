Living inside my head pulling my strings  
Letting me think Im in control  
Giving you all of my heart was a good start  
But it turns out you want my soul  
  
I dont know nothing about that  
In fact I dont know nothing at all yeah  
Im tired of proving you right  
By doing everything so wrong so wrong  
So tell me what you really want really want  
Cause I dont wanna be no I dont wanna be alone  
Ooh alone now oh yeah dont wanna be  
  
Uh Pushing me over the edge  
Cant forget those things you said  
Cut to the bone  
Go ahead take your swing  
What did you think  
I was just gonna roll overoh no

In fact I dont know nothing at all

By doing everything so wrong so wrong  
Gotta tell me what you really want what you want  
Cause I dont wanna be

Ooh alone now

And Im tired of wasting my time  
Theres got to be a reason why
