All my lifetime plans  
I got em in my hands  
Balancing my fate upon a wire  
Got to let it go  
Everywhere I turn I see  
Theres nowhere left to go  
All my dreams are far  
Too much for me to hold  
Still I hate to drop them  
Werent they from you  
What did I do  
  
You are the one that can see  
Into the heart of me  
Am I really giving up tomorrow  
Got got got to let it go  
This is gonna hurt a little  
Still its right I know  
Got to let it   
Even though I fear  
Too much of me might show  
I cant wait any longer for it  
Ive had enough  
Ill give it up  
  
Lord heres my heart  
Ive been keeping it from you  
And I got to let it go  
Holding on just breaks me worry  
Got to let it go  
Come and take it from me hurry  
Got to let it go  
Go to let it got to let it go  
Got to give up all of my control  
  
Holding on too tight  
Where do I lose sight  
Wheres the lamb that seems to bring frustration  
Go to let it go  
The best of dreams can turn to nightmares  
When my heart takes hold  
How long must I learn  
This lessons getting old  
Ive got to catch a clearer vision  
Im in your hands  
Youre in command  
  
Lord heres my heart heres my heart heres my heart  
Ive been keeping it keeping it keeping it from you  
And I got to let it go  
Holding on just breaks me worry  
Got to let it go  
Come and take it from me hurry  
Got to let it go  
Oh Ive got to let it go  
Got to give up all of my control  
  
Lord heres my heart heres my heart heres my heart  
Ive been keeping it keeping it keeping it from you  
And I got to let it go  
Holding on just breaks me worry  
Got to let it go  
Come and take it from me hurry  
Got to let it go  
Oh Ive got to let it go  
Got to give up all of my control  
  
Lord heres my heart heres my heart heres my heart  
Ive been keeping it keeping it keeping it from you  
And I got to let it go  
Holding on just breaks me worry  
Got to let it go  
Come and take it from me hurry  
Got to let it go  
Oh Ive got to let it go  
Got to give up all of my control
