Way down yonder you can hear the wind blow  
Through the tall grass growing in the old bayou  
The old bayou  
  
Theres a dark haired woman that looks so fine  
Wearing hand me down clothes drinking homemade wine  
No one ever knew who her daddy was  
The people down here say its all because  
Shes the daughter of the devil the sister of a snake  
The keeper of souls down on Voodoo Lake  
  
Theres a city boy across the county line  
Came looking for the legend of the girl so fine  
Well the stories that he heard well they had to be lies  
But he found out different when he looked in her eyes  
Well he tried to run away but she had control  
Hes findin out now what everybody knows  
He knew it was over when she started to shake  
Now theres one more soul down on Voodoo Lake  
  
Theres an eerie silence at the break of dawn  
A chill in the air something wrong  
When a shadow crosses the ground  
Those long lost souls never make a sound  
Youd think by now theyd realize  
Shell never break her bayou ties  
  
Shes the daughter of the devil the sister of a snake  
The keeper of souls down on Voodoo Lake  
  
Voodoo Lake Voodoo Lake  
Daughter of the devil sister of a snake  
Voodoo Lake  
Down on Voodoo Lake down on Voodoo Lake  
You can see her down on Voodoo Lake
