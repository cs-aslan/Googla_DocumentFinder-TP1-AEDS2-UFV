All of me why not take all  
Cant you see Im no good without you  
Take these arms I want to lose them  
Take these lips Ill never use them  
Your goodbye left me with eyes  
How can I go on to without you  
You took the best so why not take the rest  
Why not take all of me  
All of me why not take all of me  
Cant you see Im no good without you  
Take these arms I want to lose them  
Take these lips Ill never use them  
Your goodbye left me with eyes to cry  
How can I go on to without  
You took a part that once was my hart  
Why not take all of me
