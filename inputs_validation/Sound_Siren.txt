Sail with me across the sea  
So we could see whats goin on  
Along the way red stack the bong  
  
Well make it tight alright  
Well write the one that makes her cum  
That one that makes it so she cant sleep tonight  
  
So bombs away  
And as they say  
Heres to oblivion  
  
And cheers to you  
As well its through  
Sound siren  
  
Chorus  
Shes still cryin  
Its over  
Its over  
Sound siren  
Its over  
Its over  
  
Well have some fun  
Play with a loaded gun  
Try not and shoot and kill no one  
cause I would feel like shit  
  
But in the same regard  
Its getting hard to deal with it  
And Im sick of it  
And no place is too far  
  
So bombs away  
And as they say  
Heres to oblivion  
  
And cheers to you  
As well its through  
Sound siren  
  
Chorus x2  
  
So bombs away  
And as they say  
Well its over now  
Its over now  
Shes gone yeah  
And he wont go away  
  
So sound siren  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Ssssound siren  
Ssssound siren  
Ssssound siren  
Ssssound siren  
  
Chorus x2
