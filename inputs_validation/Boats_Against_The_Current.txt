I know its over  
You know its over  
Were just goin through the motions  
But were sailing separate oceans worlds apart  
And you know its breakin my heart  
  
I was a dreamer  
You were a dreamer  
But perfection is consuming  
And it seems were only human after all  
And weve both been takin the fall  
  
Chorus  
But tomorrow  
Well run a little bit faster  
Tomorrow  
Were gonna find what were after at last  
Feelings that we left in the past  
Theres romance in the sunset  
Were boats against the current to the end  
  
Maybe were older  
And maybe were colder  
So we disregard solutions  
While we cling to our illusions once again  
And we keep remembering when  
Seasons are changing  
Oh my reasons are changing  
But the story isnt ending  
So we find ourselves pretending one more day  
And the years keep slipping away  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Romance in the sunset  
Were boats against the current to the end  
To the end
