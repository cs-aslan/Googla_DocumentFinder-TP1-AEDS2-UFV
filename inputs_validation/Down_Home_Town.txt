The world outside dont like us much  
Cause they aint got our classy touch  
But they aint good enough to breathe  
This towns good air we make em leave  
  
Chorus  
But its no no no you really cant do that  
No no no down home town  
  
No monkey business in this town  
Well who do you think youre pushing round  
This towns respectable and clean  
Just look around youll see what I mean  
  
Chorus  
  
Down home town down home town  
  
Chorus  
  
We got the best town band around  
Just listen to their crazy sound  
When they get hot they gonna blow  
You see them winnin every show  
Down home town down home town Repeat  
  
Chorus  
  
Look out
