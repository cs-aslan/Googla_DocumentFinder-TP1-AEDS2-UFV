Can you see the view Can you feel the heat  
Im savin no time for you no time for me  
Youre up on the news Im wild in the streets  
Im under the lights tonight I wont have to hide the need  
But you got love in its place  
In its own time and space  
You got love in its place in your  
Little Paradise  
  
You got fashion secure in your own little world  
Diamonds are forever for Hollywood girls  
No need to cover no reason to lie  
Life without your Maserati is grounds for suicide  
  
But you got love in its place  
In its own time and space  
You got love in its place in your  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise  
  
You got love in its place  
In its own time and space  
You got love in its place in your  
  
You got love in its place  
In its own time and space  
You got love in its place in your  
  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise
