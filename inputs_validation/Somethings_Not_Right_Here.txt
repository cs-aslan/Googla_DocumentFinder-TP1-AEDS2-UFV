Come come my dear take flight come near  
I see your fear creeping around you  
First love then hate then love no wait  
Your confusion its gonna kill me  
  
I broke for you I woke for you  
You tore me through god love you  
I see the signs are out of line  
No fault of mine except for  
  
Dont say his name now  
  
Im breaking out something aint right here  
Youve fallen out something aint right here  
  
You screamed I begged whats that you said  
Your clouded heads telling you lies now  
You hear my voice you make some noise  
You stole my choice its over  
  
And I pray for you now  
I speak to you  
  
Im breaking out something aint right here  
Youve fallen out something aint right here  
Im breaking out something aint right here  
Youve fallen out fallen out for  
Fallen out youve fallen out  
Why cant you see it  
  
Ill pray for you now  
Im speaking to
