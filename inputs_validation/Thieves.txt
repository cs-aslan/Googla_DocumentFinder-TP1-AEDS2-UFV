Youre happy all the time  
I just dont understand why I cant be happy too  
Your smiles are salt in the wound  
A slap upon a back thats been toiling in the sun  
  
When will I get mine  
Or must I be a Godfearing white American  
Oh everything is fine  
As long as youre a Godfearing white American  
  
Why should the thieves have all of the fun  
Selling us water by the river they dont speak for everyone  
Im ready to run and youre making me crawl  
Selling me water by the river they dont speak for me at all  
  
The man about the town  
The beauty queen the paragon of civilization  
But shadows cling to us all  
Even those convinced that theyre sheltered and immune  
  
Oh when will I get mine  
Or must I be a Godfearing white American  
Yeah  
  
Why should the thieves have all of the fun  
Selling us water by the river they dont speak for everyone  
Im ready to run and youre making me crawl  
Selling me water by the river they dont speak for me at all  
They dont speak for me at all  
  
Why should the thieves have all of the fun  
Selling us water by the river they dont speak for everyone  
Im ready to run and youre making me crawl  
Selling me water by the river they dont speak for me at all  
  
Im ready to run and youre making me crawl  
Selling me water by the river they dont speak for me at all  
They dont speak for me at all  
They dont speak for me at all
