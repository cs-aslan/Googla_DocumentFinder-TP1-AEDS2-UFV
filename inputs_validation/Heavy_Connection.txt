In the land of a thousand dances  
I dance with you  
I was out I was taking my chances  
When dreams came true  
When you came into my dream  
Like from a whisper to a scream  
  
And its a real heavy connection  
Its just a real heavy connection  
Its a real heavy connection  
Lalalala  
  
I remember when I got your message in Amsterdam  
I was going through my letters  
And found a picturepostcard of the Reeperbahn  
When you came into the room  
Not too late and not too soon  
  
And its a real heavy connection  
And its a real heavy connection  
And its a real heavy connection  
Lalalala  
  
And you came into my dreams  
From a whisper to a scream  
  
And its a real heavy connection  
And its a real heavy connection  
Its just a real heavy connection  
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala  
  
And its a real heavy connection  
And its a real heavy connection  
And its a real heavy connection  
Lalalala  
Baby baby baby  
I cant stop this rainbow  
Touching my soul  
I cant stop this rainbow  
In my soul  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby
