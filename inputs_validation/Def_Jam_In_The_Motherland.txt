Drivin Bombs that inveterate your ego  
Suckers all weird no let the best go migo

Forget Mako you gonna need a makeover

They crown me the King of doin nothin but harm

To decapatate amputate and take titles  
The legend of leather Ima real live idol  
Damn I take souls condemn we men  
And make microphones men again and again  
Cause Im blood thirsty watch and try to curse me  
Youll lose the battle even if you out rehearsed me  
Ima rip holes watch heads roll like a mole  
When Im strollin with my neck on a goal  
My battles like a blackout you cant back out  
Only difference no time to feel a track out

Chorus  
  
So come forward admit youre guilty  
Admit that your thoughts of New Jack killed me  
Admit you were sleepin on the skills of L  
Now know that I handle mine very well  
I burn buildings eat emcees  
Smack DJs and tell the seated girls please  
They try to jam hard but Ima fan God  
And they could never get a piece of the man Todd  
King Posse ruler and high roller  
You losin it son your games gettin colder

Chorus

Now just another rapper with a chain and a beeper  
One sample is ample four emceesll get trampled  
Bein absent from God Ima give you sample  
My vocabularys legendary my rumpy your temporary  
So what your name in the bituary  
Step back the conqueror spreads his wings  
Kindergarten rappers Im back to change things  
I rock the clearest one hell of a learer  
Since I cant miss and Im kinda like a chemist  
When I put a potion together its splendid and fatal  
You can never make a move on me cause youre still premado  
Grip the mic tight sometimes I get calasis  
And when Im through you face baralysis  
Im gettin thinner watch me eat dinner  
Im down to skinner beginner to be a winner

Chorus  
  
Who gets the roughest you know the answer  
Youre a dandelion Im a panther  
When I pick up the mic as my fist see mo  
King of Rackadochio Im magnifigo  
When I rock hearts roll on and walk bad  
Cause I know its makes the facesuckerducks mad  
I came back to smack wifes and pull cards  
Introducin the original Todd  
Just like a bloodhound but I got this spellbound  
Your rhymes are snowbound and I can throw down  
Im like a thundercloud I drop heavy  
Hold steady get ready your petti confetti  
Techniques and styles they aint ready  
Ah ah yeah full of horsepower and Ima devour  
Stay clean when I scream youre soft las cauliflower  
I set the track and record you like a brown mouse  
Then flick and do a Bruce Lee roundhouse  
No threat exist no man can stand  
Say mic check and expect to take the man  
  
Chorus
