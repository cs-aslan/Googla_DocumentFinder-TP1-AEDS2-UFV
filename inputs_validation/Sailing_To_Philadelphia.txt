From Mark Knopflers Sailing To Philadelphia  
  
I Am Jeremiah Dixon  
I Am A Geordie Boy  
A Glass Of Wine With You Sir  
And The Ladies Ill Enjoy  
All Durham And Northumberland  
Is Measured Up By My Own Hand  
It Was My Fate From Birth  
To Make My Mark Upon The Earth  
  
He Calls Me Charlie Mason  
A Stargazer Am I  
It Seems That I Was Born  
To Chart The Evening Sky  
Theyd Cut Me Out For Baking Bread  
But I Had Other Dreams Instead  
This Bakers Boy From The West Country  
Would Join The Royal Society  
  
We Are Sailing To Philadelphia  
A World Away From The Coaly Tyne  
Sailing To Philadelphia  
To Draw The Line  
The MasonDixon Line  
  
Now Youre A Good Surveyor Dixon  
But I Swear Youll Make Me Mad  
The West Will Kill Us Both  
You Gullible Geordie Lad  
You Talk Of Liberty  
How Can America Be Free  
A Geordie And A Bakers Boy  
In The Forests Of The Iroquois  
  
Now Hold Your Head Up Mason  
See America Lies There  
The Morning Tide Has Raised  
The Capes Of Delaware  
Gome Up And Feel The Sun  
A New Morning Is Begun  
Another Day Will Make It Clear  
Why Your Stars Should Guide Us Here  
  
We Are Sailing To Philadelphia  
A World Away From The Coaly Tyne  
Sailing To Philadelphia  
To Draw The Line  
The MasonDixon Line
