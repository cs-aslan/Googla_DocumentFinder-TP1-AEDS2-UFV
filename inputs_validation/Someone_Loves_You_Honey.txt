I want to share your life every minute every day and night  
And I want you to know that whatever you do wherever you go  
Remember someone loves you honey no matter what Ill be your girl  
Someone loves you honey more than anything in the world  
Im glad that Im the one that you come to when you need someone  
Thats what my love is for its a shoulder to lean on a port in the storm  
Remember someone loves you honey  
Oh someone loves you honey no matter what I just want to be your girl  
Someone loves you honey more than anything in the world  
Oh someone loves you honey no matter what just let me be your girl
