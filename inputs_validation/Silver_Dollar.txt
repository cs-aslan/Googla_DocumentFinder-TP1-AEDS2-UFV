I shouldve known you couldnt take it  
You had to make it with another man  
You know thats true baby  
And I can play that game if you can  
Its been a long time since Ive come here  
To give you what you need  
My roots are in Chicago  
But I know where I wanna plant my seed  
I I bet a silver dollar you youd love another  
And you know that silver dollar it would make me rich  
Girl like you easy pitch  
But I miss you now youre gone  
Im coming home girl just to show you  
What this mans been living for  
A tip for you dont be surprised baby  
When I come busting through that door  
Its been a long time since Ive been here  
To give you what you need  
My roots are in Chicago  
But I know where I wanna plant my seed  
I I bet a silver dollar you youd love another  
And even though that silver dollar would make me rich  
I wanna tell you that there is a hitch  
Miss you know youre gone  
And all I got left is my old guitar  
I I bet a silver dollar you youd love another  
Even though that silver dollar would make me rich  
I wanna tell you that there is a hitch  
Miss you know youre gone
