Ahaha hurry hurry step this way  
Ahaha hurry hurry step this way  
Now the show youre going to see is strictly high class  
Therell be ten hoola dancers shaking their grass  
So step right up and put your money down  
This way to Carny Town  
  
We got a man so skinny you can see his bones  
We play on his ribs like a xylophone  
With a pair of spoons we get a rockin song  
Youll hear it all in Carny Town  
  
Hurry hurry hurry the house is almost full  
We got a two headed cow and thats no bull  
Theres a man who swallows swords and he never gets hurt  
He eats razor blades for dessert  
Hes just about the sharpest guy around  
Youll see him here in Carny Town  
  
Ahaha hurry hurry step this way  
Ahaha hurry hurry step this way  
Ahaha hurry hurry step this way  
Ahaha hurry hurry step this way  
Ahaha I say were gonna win  
I said hurry up
