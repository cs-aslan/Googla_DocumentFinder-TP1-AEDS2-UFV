This whole country is scared of failure  
My head keeps trying to sell me ambition  
But in my heart I want selfrespect  
Theres a conflict  
  
Boy I feel so outgunned today  
But Ill get up and fight back anyway  
You and I are not huge mainstream stars  
But unlike them were really what we are  
  
We got Main Street eyes  
Watchin as the big boys roll by  
Under rotten television skies  
We got Main Street eyes  
  
I saw a kitten squashed in the street  
I read about a plastic surgeon and his art collection  
  
We are played for suckers all the time  
Phony rock and roll  
Its a crime  
I dont want to dip myself in trash  
I dont want to give myself for cash  
  
We got Main Street eyes  
Tryin to do whats decent with our lives  
Under funny television skies  
We got Main Street eyes  
  
Walkin around sometimes  
I see a tension under the surface  
People are just about ready to explode  
  
So hold me and trust me  
I love you dont worry  
Keep your Main Street eyes Repeat x3  
Eyes  
Eyes
