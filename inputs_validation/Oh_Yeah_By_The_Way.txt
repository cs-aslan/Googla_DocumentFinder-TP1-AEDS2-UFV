Oh no oh no oo oo  
Im going to be left out  
Im going to break you  
And if you only knew just how I took my time  
Im going to take it off I am going to make you  
I gotta dance gotta dance  
Gotta seem all right  
  
Oh Yeah and By The Way Im going to make you cry  
18 with a face like that  
Kick it twice in the eye  
And dont you go home to Daddy

Im want to take it down and make it go away  
And if you see my soul Im going make you  
I going see I gotta see gotta be ok  
  
Oh Yeah and By The Way Im going to make you cry  
18 with a face like that  
Kick it twice in the eye  
And dont you go home to Daddy  
  
Guitar Solo  
  
Oh Yeah and By The Way Im going to make you cry  
18 with a face like that  
Kick it twice in the eye  
And dont you go home to Daddy

Kick it twice in the eye  
And dont you go home to Daddy
