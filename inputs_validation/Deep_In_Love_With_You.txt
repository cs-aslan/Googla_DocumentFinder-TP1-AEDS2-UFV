Sitting at Your feet is where I want to be  
Im home when I am here with You  
Ruined by Your grace enamored by Your gaze  
I cant resist the tenderness in You  
  
Im deep in love with You Abba Father  
Im deep in love with You Lord  
My heart it beats for You precious Jesus  
Im deep in love with You Lord  
  
Humbled and amazed that You would call my name  
I never have to search again  
Theres a deep desire thats burning like a fire  
To know You as my closest friend  
  
Lord my redeemer Your blood runs through my veins  
My love for You is deeper than it was yesterday  
I enter through the curtain parted by Your grace  
Oh Your the lover of my soul
