Im sitting here sad and lonely  
Thinkin bout my one and only  
I been sittin here cryin my eyes out  
Feelin sorry for myself cause I just dont know what its all about  
No I just dont know  
  
But I miss my baby  
Im lookin for a lady  
Said I miss my baby  
I think Im goin crazy  
Well I miss my baby  
Ill die without her maybeyeah yeah  
Im lookin for my baby  
Alright n allright

She was eager just to please her baby  
But I miss her and its drivin me crazy
