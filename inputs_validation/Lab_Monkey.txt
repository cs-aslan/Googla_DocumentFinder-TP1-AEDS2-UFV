Anybody out there  
Anyone at all  
Can you finally hear this deep in  
Scratching through the wall  
Came far to find me  
Down the rabbit hole  
Watch me smiling back while chewing on my skull  
  
I know wont forget  
Limped away from the wreck  
  
Is the monkey breathing  
Looking kinda sick  
Got a witty comment for me  
Have yourself a kick  
Does it make you feel good  
Are you full and strong  
Gonna end up in this cage and I hope your stay is long  
  
I know wont forget  
Limped away from the wreck  
  
Well never know what this is  
til we take a look inside  
Im sure well find what came before it dies  
  
Well never know what this is  
til we take a look inside  
Im sure well find what came before  
  
Had enough I dont need you to stick my hide  
Had enough no more tears for me left to cry  
Had enough I dont need you to blind my eyes  
Had enough no more tears for me left to cry  
  
I know wont forget  
Limped away from the wreck  
  
Well never know what this is  
til we take a look inside  
Im sure well find what came before it dies  
  
Well never know what this is  
til we take a look inside  
Im sure well find what came before  
  
Had enough I dont need you to stick my hide  
Had enough no more tears for me left to cry  
Had enough I dont need you to blind my eyes  
Had enough no more tears for me left to cry
