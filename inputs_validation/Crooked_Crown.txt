I could say what I mean  
or I could dance around it  
It would feel good to scream  
I should quiet down  
I could be recognized  
or I could stay in bed  
Look the world in the eyes  
or just hang my head  
  
Im holding steady this crooked crown  
Knowing Ill lose it if I look down  
  
When my ship has come in  
when it runs aground  
Ill be smiling again  
turn those corners down  
Ive got something to say  
no ones listening  
Its my reckoning day  
so wheres the reckoning  
  
Im holding steady this crooked crown  
Knowing Ill lose it if I look down  
Im holding steady this crooked crown  
  
My prodigy and my idiot play  
For the prize of my delicate line  
Somehow the score at the end of  
The day is still 5149  
  
Im holding steady this crooked crown  
Knowing Ill lose it if I look down  
Im holding steady this crooked crown
