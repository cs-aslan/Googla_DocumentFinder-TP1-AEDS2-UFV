Well you think youre the hardest thing a goin  
The way things come to you you think youre in  
But one of these days that winds a gonna start blowin  
You may not lose the big boy you wont win  
Cause the devil gets his dues and youll start payin  
When he collects you know youll pay your debt  
The devil gets his dues like I been sayin  
You hurt just like youve hurt me you can bet  
 guitar   
When it comes to love you wear the devils menu  
And you bribe a lot that you just cant be hurt  
Youre not the only one who knows the trick or two  
Some day I might rub your face in the dirt  
Well your little play house is sittin on sticks of dynamite  
And I get mad tonight and light the fuze  
If you come in and find out that my dog bites  
Youll know the devils here collectin dues  
Cause the devil gets his dues
