A pattern sunrise swept  
Along the way a sunrise  
And under these overpasses  
A towering mountain does rise  
Dont cross the river not over there  
Therell be a mystery revealed  
And I bet you dare  
And if I am to seek this place you can see  
Whos chariot to follow so I can be free  
  
At night the stars cry  
I gaze upon a lake of backyard  
And under these overpasses  
A towering mountain does lie  
Dont cross the river not over there  
Therell be a mystery revealed  
That were meant to share  
So if I am to seek this place you can see  
Whos chariot to follow so I can be free  
  
Oh No here we are again  
Oh No here we are again  
  
My momma told me  
Dont go cross that river  
Because you might not make it back  
The beast gonna eat your heart  
She said Dont go out there  
Stay upon your track  
This money has torn my family apart  
And I cannot buy it back  
So of course I built my boat  
And I was half upon my way  
When I got to the other side  
The water came rushing down  
Washed me away  
  
Whos Chariot Whos Chariot Whos Chariot  
Chariot Whos Chariot Whose Chariot  
Chariot Chariot Whos Chariot  
Chariot Chariot  
  
Freedom Freedom Whos Chariot  
Freedom Freedom Whos Chariot  
Freedom Freedom Whos Chariot  
Whos Chariot Take me home  
Take me home  
  
Oh No said Im out that door again  
I left my house my money  
And my dearest friend  
Im not going back jack  
I cross the river got a little  
Bit of business that Im doing today  
You didnt feel me  
You cant really see no good  
I made my life out a stack of wood  
Ive been moving cross the river today  
But Whos Chariot  
Take me home Take me home  
  
Whose chariot Take me home  
Hallaluyah Coming home  
Chariot gotta where will you take me  
Chariot will ya will ya take me  
Chariot will ya will ya take me  
Oh Chariot would ya pick me up take me  
Oh Chariot gotta oh will you take me  
Chariot just pick me up and take me  
Oh Chariot come and get me  
Whos Chariot Take me home
