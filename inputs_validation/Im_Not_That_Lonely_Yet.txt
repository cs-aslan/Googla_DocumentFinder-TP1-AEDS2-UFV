I dont mind to give you a slow dance or two  
Im sorry Im not at my best  
I know you can see Im incredibly blue  
But Im not that lonely yet  
  
I look in your eyes while youre dancing with me  
And try to fulfill your request  
But dont ask for favors when its time to leave  
Cause Im not that lonely yet  
  
Now dont say you want me  
Ive heard that before  
The words weigh like stones in my head  
There may come a time when Ill think of you more  
But Im not that lonely yet  
  
Its nice to be dancing  
To waltzes again  
And maybe it helps to forget  
Youve opened the door but Im not waltzing in  
Cause Im not that lonely yet  
No Im not that lonely yet
