Now the parking lot is empty  
Everyones gone someplace  
I pick you up and in the trunk Ive packed  
A cooler and a two day suitcase  
Cause theres a place we like to drive  
Way out in the country  
Five miles out of the city limit were singin  
And your hands upon my knees  
So were ok were fine  
Baby Im here to stop your crying  
Chase all the ghosts from your head  
Im stronger than the monster beneath your bed  
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  
Look at them together then well take them apart  
Adding up the total of a love thats true  
Multiply life by the power of two  
I know the things that I am afraid of  
Im not afraid to tell  
And if we ever leave a legacy  
Its that we loved each other well  
Cause Ive seen the shadows of so many people  
Trying on the treasures of youth  
But a road fancy and fast ends in a fatal crash  
And Im glad we got off to tell you the truth  
Cause were ok were fine  
Baby Im here to stop your crying  
Chase all the ghosts from your head  
Im stronger than the monster beneath your bed  
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  
Look at them together then well take them apart  
Adding up the total of a love thats true  
Multiply life by the power of two  
All the shiny little trinkets of temptation  
Something new instead of something old  
But all you gotta do is scratch beneath the surface  
And its fools gold  
Fools gold  
Now were talking about a difficult thing  
And your eyes are getting wet  
I took us for better and I took us for worse  
And dont you ever forget it  
Now theres steel bars between me and a promise  
Suddenly bend with ease  
And the closer Im bound in love to you  
The closer I am to free  
So were ok were fine  
Baby Im here to stop your crying  
Chase all the ghosts from your head  
Im stronger than the monster beneath your bed  
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  
Look at them together then well take them apart  
Adding up the total of a love thats true  
Multiply life by the power of two
