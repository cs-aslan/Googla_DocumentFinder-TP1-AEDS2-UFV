Ive taken time to say goodbye to my sadness  
But now I know Im free  
You took my hand and led me out of the darkness  
To help me find a brand new me Baby  
Though all the world around me criticized  
The love you gave was never compromised  
  
I never heard you say through all of the madness  
Maybe maybe  
Theres no denyin I feel the same way too  
Baby I would die for you Yeah  
I would Die for you  
With you I know Im in a place  
That darkness can not touch  
  
Givin it up  
Givin it up  
Givin it all up to the feelin  
Givin it up  
Givin it up  
Baby I know youve got that somethin  
Givin it up  
  
Learning the truth that exposed me to my blindness  
Has opened up my world  
Gone are the barriers that kept me out in darkness  
Living in a twilight world  
You guided me where others feared to tread  
And through it all no grudging words were said  
  
I never heard you say through all of this madness  
Maybe maybe  
Theres no denial I feel the same way too  
Honey I would die for you  
I would Die for you  
With you I know Im in a place  
That darkness can not touch  
  
Givin it up  
Givin it up  
Givin it all up to the feelin  
Givin it up  
Givin it up  
Babe I know youve got that somethin  
Babe I know youve got that somethin  
Give it up  
I want to give it up  
  
Theres no denial I feel the same way too  
Baby I would die for you Yes  
I would Die for you  
With you I know Im in a place  
That darkness can not touch  
  
Givin it up  
Givin it up  
Givin it all up to the feelin  
Givin it up  
Givin it up  
Babe I know youve got that somethin  
Babe I know youve got that somethin  
Thats why Im givin it all up to you Baby
