Its Saturday  
Im ready to go out and have some fun  
Get in the club around bout twelvish  
Me my homies hoochie huntin  
Lovin the way the DJs mixin  
And everybodys on the floor  
Moet Alize  
  
Chorus  
Every day and every night humpin and bouncin  
All I wanna do Repeat x2  
Summertime Saturday night  
  
Hey whatcha doin  
Chillin strokin the town  
Sure you dont wanna come over here  
Nah I aint comin over there man  
What you mean you aint comin over here  
Cause you dont be talkin about doing shit  
Who you wit  
Dont worry about who Im wit  
See thats why I dont call you  
  
Its time to be havin a good time tonight  
Music got you in the mood youll be dancin all night  
Lovin the way the DJs mixin and everybodys on the floor  
I cant seem to stop thinkin about you baby  
No matter what I do  
  
Chorus x2

Leave all your troubles behind  
Let me see you hump and bounce  
  
Chorus x2
