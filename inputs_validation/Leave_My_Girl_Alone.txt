You better leave you better leave my little girl alone  
You better leave you better leave my little girl alone  
Lord before I get evil man and I go and do something wrong  
  
You call my house just yesterday  
I picked up the extension and I heard every word you say  
Why dont you just go man and leave my little girl alone  
Now before I get evil man and I go and do something wrong  
  
You call my house all hours of the night  
Let me tell you mister thats a sure sure way to start a fight  
Why dont you just go on man and leave my little girl alone  
Lord before I get evil man and Im gonna do something wrong
