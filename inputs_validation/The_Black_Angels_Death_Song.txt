The myriad choices of his fate  
Set themselves out upon a plate  
For him to choose  
What had he to lose  
  
Not a ghost bloodied country  
All covered with sleep  
Where the black angel did weep  
Not an old city street in the east  
Gone to choose  
  
And wanderings brother  
Walked on through the night  
With his hair in his face  
On a long splintered cut from the knife of gt  
  
The rally mans patter ran on through the dawn  
Until we said so long  
To his skullshrill yell  
  
Shining brightly redrimmed and  
Redlined with the time  
Infused with the choice of the mind  
On ice skates scraping chunks  
From the bells  
  
Cut mouth bleeding razors  
Forgetting the pain  
Antiseptic remains cool goodbye  
So you fly  
To the cozy brown snow of the east  
Gone to choose choose again  
  
Sacrificials remains make it hard to forget  
Where you come from  
The stools of your eyes  
Serve to realize fame choose again  
  
And rovermans refrain of the sacrilege recluse  
For the loss of a horse  
Went the bowels and a tail of a rat  
Come again choose to go  
  
And if epiphanys terror reduced you to shame  
Have your head bobbed and weaved  
Choose a side to be on  
  
If the stone glances off  
Split didactics in two  
Leave the colors of the mouse trails  
Dont scream try between  
If you choose if you choose try to lose  
For the loss of remain come and start  
  
Start the game i che che che che i  
Che che ka tak koh  
Choose to choose  
Choose to choose choose to go
