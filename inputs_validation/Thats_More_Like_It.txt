When I wanted you you would not reciprocate  
When I needed you you would always show up late  
But things have changed and Ive got the upper hand  
You can run and Ive got you eating out of my hand  
  
Thats more like it yeah  
Thats more like it  
Make my dinner bring it to me  
Thats more like it  
Thats more like it  
Yeah thats more like it  
Yeah thats more like it  
I see where and when it happens  
Thats more like it  
Thats more like it  
Thats more like it  
Thats more like it  
  
When my birthday came you would not remember it  
When I talked to you you were never listening  
But tables turn and its great to be on top  
Got you good to appreciate the good that youve got  
  
Thats more like it yeah  
Thats more like it  
Make my dinner bring it to me  
Thats more like it  
Thats more like it  
Yeah thats more like it  
Yeah thats more like it  
I see where and when it happens  
Thats more like it  
Thats more like it  
Thats more like it  
Thats more like it  
  
I like chocolate and I like daisies  
Maybe you better write this down  
I love cashmere and I want diamonds  
Im ready for my massage right now oh right now  
  
Thats more like it yeah  
Thats more like it  
Make my dinner bring it to me  
Thats more like it  
Thats more like it  
Yeah thats more like it  
Yeah thats more like it  
I see where and when it happens  
Thats more like it  
Thats more like it  
Thats more like it  
Thats more like it
