Well I heard that it might be raining bed sheets and lovers words  
Lets throw out the hotel comforter and hang the do not disturb  
Sign me up for the storm  
Ill wear my suit for the shower  
Cause Ill have you to keep me warm in the coldest hour  
  
And when the darkness falls under your hair there Ill be  
And crazy is the forecast all week  
  
Well every kiss every hug is so light on that touch delicate like a
snowflake  
Well I can taste I can taste I can taste I can taste you all over my face  
And everyone might find it foolish to not be counting on the sun  
But your mouth is my umbrella now  
Because Im holding your tongue  
  
And when the darkness falls under your hair there Ill be  
And crazy is the forecast all week  
  
Theres a good chance in hell  
Like cats and dogs well be flying  
And Im no weatherman  
But you are lightning striking  
  
Here comes the sun and the rain  
All at once down the sink  
  
In the midst of the morning pull up a blanket of a cloud  
And await for the warning of another come down  
Because the water is healthy for the roses in your cheeks  
My well holds plenty for penny wishin in your deep end  
And when the lights go out no doubt with you Ill be  
  
And crazy is the forecast all week  
  
And if them rains should fall for sure with you Ill be  
Ah because crazy is the forecast all week long  
Crazy is the forecast
