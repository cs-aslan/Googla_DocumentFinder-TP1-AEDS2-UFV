Its a nine mile walk from the office to the pumps  
Sometimes you think youre gonna drop  
In the end youre filthy dirty horny and pissed off  
And before you can leave you gotta sweep the fuckin shop  
  
Its a real real bitch to be workin for the man  
But shit I do it well so what the fuck  
I could probably wash dishes at some other fuckin dump  
But its all the same to me bustin ass to make a buck  
  
So read em up and stick em  
Pump that fucker good  
Some woman down on Main Street needs a jump  
Get your fingers outta your ass  
And pump some fagots gas  
And think about how bad New Hope sucks  
  
And its a piss poor life when the ladies fire you up  
And then you check their oil and know youre fucked  
Cause no one wants a loser who works for 5 an hour  
Smells like gas looks like shit works in the rain and rude as hell  
  
Now I can fix a tire like Hurricane Melinda  
I know that Im the best for what its worth  
So if I choose to help you dont look like you expect it  
Cause its a gift that God gave me at birth  
  
So read em up and stick em  
Pump that fucker good  
Some woman down on Main Street needs a jump  
Get your fingers outta your ass  
And pump some fagots gas  
And think about how bad New Hope sucks woo hoo
