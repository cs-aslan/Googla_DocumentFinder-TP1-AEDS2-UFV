The revolutions over baby  
The revolutions over baby now  
The revolutions over baby  
The revolutions over baby now  
  
Reelin and Quakin  
Bringin home the bacon  
Were all getting taken for a ride  
  
Kiss your mama goodbye  
Time to let it all fly  
Dont get caught  
With your fingers in the pie  
  
The revolutions over baby  
The revolutions over baby now  
The revolutions over baby  
The revolutions over baby now  
  
Time to start a new one  
Different than the old one  
Something that theyve never seen before  
  
The revolutions over baby now  
The revolutions over baby now  
The revolutions over baby now  
The revolutions over baby now
