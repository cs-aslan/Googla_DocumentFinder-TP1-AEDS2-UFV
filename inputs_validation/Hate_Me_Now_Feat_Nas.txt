1st Chorus after Nas add Puff Daddy ad lib  
Well you hate me Im gon hate you too  
Its as simple as that  
Die motherfucker die motherfucker die  
You dont give a fuck I dont give a fuck  
Go down any way you want it to go down do it now  
Weak jealous motherfuckers do it now do it now  
Fuck yall  
Verse 1  
Dont hate me hate the money I see clothes that I buy  
Ice that I wear clothes that I try close your eyes  
Picture me rollin sixes money foldin  
Bitches honies that swollen to riches Nas get in ya  
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer prize winner  
Best storyteller thug narrator my styles greater  
Model dater big threat to a lot of you haters  
Commentators ringside try watchin my paper  
Almost a decade quite impressive  
Most of the best is in the essence  
For this rap shit that I stand for  
Expandin more to the big screen Bill Gates dreams  
But it seems youd rather see me in jail with state greens  
Want me off the scene fast but good things last  
Like your favorite MC still makin some mean cash  
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects  
But you still wanna hate
