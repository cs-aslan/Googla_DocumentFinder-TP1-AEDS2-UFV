When I was a young man I busted my jeans hopping a freight down to New Orleans  
Worked on the oil rigs and played in the bars but nothing ever killed me so
far  
Now Im waitin on the other shoe to fall and right now youre walking out on
me  
I can hear your footsteps going down the hall  
And I am waitin on the other shoe to fall  
  
Fiddle  
  
Well I joined the army and I did my time they sent me right up to the front
lines  
People were shoutin and shootin at me but I had to keep America free  
Now Im waitin on the other shoe to fall  
  
Dobro  
  
Ive been to California and Ive been to New York  
And all in between I had beans on my fork  
Clothes on my back and a song on my mind but Ive never met a woman like your
kind  
Now Im waitin on the other shoe to fall  
  
Fiddle  
  
Well right down the street theres an old boardin house  
You better be careful bout throwin me out  
When she hears my footsteps comin up their stairs shes gonna start combing
her hair  
Shes a waitin on the other shoe to fall right now youre walking out on me  
I can hear your footsteps going down the hall  
And she is waitin on the other shoe to fall
