Is there anyone out there  
Or am I walking alone  
When I turned around and found that youd gone before  
The first rain could fall  
  
It seems every single time I was bleeding  
Broken promises that never came true  
Well it aint so long before the dawn  
When the sun is gone so are  
Well so are you  
  
So whats it gonna take  
To get you back in bed  
Gossip drugs and snakes  
Theyre just our best fair weather friends fair weather friends  
Fair weather friends fair weather friends  
  
One day when were far away  
From everything that hurts  
Drink and screw is all well do  
Every day  
  
So whats it gonna take  
To get you back in bed  
Gossip drugs and snakes  
Theyre just our best fair weather friends fair weather friends  
  
And though the hours late  
Dont let em in your head fair weather friends  
Gonna pray for rain again and again  
Fair weather friends  
Fair weather friends  
  
Fair I dont give a shit about em anyhow
