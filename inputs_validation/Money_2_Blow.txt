I am on that 24 hour  
Champagne diet spillin while Im sippin  
I encourage you to try it  
Im probably just saying that cause I dont have to buy it  
The club owner supply it  
Boy Im on that fly shit  
I am what everybody in my past dont want me to be  
Guess what I made it  
Im the mother fucking man  
I just want you to see  
Come take a look get a load of this nigga  
Quit fronting on me  
Dont come around and try to gas me up I like runnin on E  
I I I Im on my disneyg shit  
Goofy flow on records Im Captin Hook  
And my new car is Rupio  
Damn where my roof just go  
Im somebody that you should know  
Get to shaking something cause thats what Drama produced it fo  
Yes I make mistakes that I dont ever make excuses for  
Leaving girls that love me and constantly seducing hoes  
Im losing my thoughts I said damn where my roof just go  
Top slipped off like Janet at the Super Bowl

He cant they cant and I cant blame em  
Since I got famous bitch I got money to blow  
Gettin it in letting these bills fall  
All over your skin  
Got money to blow oh oh oh oh oh oh
