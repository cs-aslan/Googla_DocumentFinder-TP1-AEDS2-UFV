Ive been around these vicious lies too  
Too long to be neglecting the truth  
Im getting closer and Im fully armed  
  
Im about to hunt you down through  
The big black hole right behind you  
And Im about to cut your wings away  
  
Cause Ive been finding out  
Where youve broken in  
And I will take you out  
When I close you in  
  
Im killing them all  
I put my soul on the line  
I purify sins  
That I committed in life  
Ill follow them all  
And Ill be bringing them down  
Wherever they go  
Im right behind  
Theres nowhere to go  
Your head on the line  
There is no rope  
Youre running out of time  
So where will you go  
When I will murder your soul  
  
Im about to do it your way  
I will make your world unsafe  
I never thought youd get this far  
  
  
You dont believe what all the signs say  
I dont believe in judgment day  
But you wont be leaving here unharmed  
  
Cause Ive been finding out  
Where youve broken in  
And I will take you out  
When I close you in  
  
Im killing them all  
I put my soul on the line  
I purify sins  
That I committed in life  
Ill follow them all  
And Ill be bringing them down  
Wherever they go  
Im right behind  
Theres nowhere to go  
Your head on the line  
There is no rope  
Youre running out of time  
So where will you go  
When I will murder your soul  
  
You cant feel the pain  
I scream in vain  
You sink away  
To the bottom  
  
You cant break your chains  
Break away from here  
  
Im killing them all  
I put my soul on the line  
I purify my sins  
That I committed in life  
Ill follow them all  
And Ill be bringing them down  
Wherever they go  
Im right behind  
Theres nowhere to go  
Your head on the line  
There is no rope  
Youre running out of time  
So where will you go  
When I will murder your soul
