Lay back enjoy the fall lover I wont hurt you  
I take it all on if you trust me  
Dont hesitate let it go let me know baby show me  
I dont read minds but Im trying my best to read yours  
  
Chorus  
Yeah  
Let me know let me know  
Yeah  
Let me know its all for you  
  
Help me help yourself  
I want to give it all to you but  
Dont make me second guess I dont want to play games no more  
For sure Ive got your back Ive never wanted anything more than you and your
sexy smile  
I love you so try not to blow it this time  
  
Chorus  
  
Everything inside you about you  
I want to know taste hold love you anytime I want to  
Let me show you let me give you everything I have saved just for you  
I know you love me but Im gonna need more than what youre giving me  
I want to feel you but I feel empty  
You gotta help me you gotta meet me halfway  
There I see you can you see me closer now  
Just tell me show me what its gonna take to get you to trust me love me
like I know you can  
  
Chorus
