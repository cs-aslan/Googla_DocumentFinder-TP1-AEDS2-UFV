I Almost Care  
Even though I hurt you all the time  
Youre on my mind I wont deny  
Everything I did I take it back  
Ill make it right at least Ill try  
Now theres only one thing on my mind  
Its taken me some time girl  
Im ready now to lay it on the line  
I hope you want to try still you know I will  
Dont give up when youre so close  
Dont give up when youre almost there  
Dont give up when youre so close  
I almost care I almost care  
I admit I dont know why youd stay  
Ive tried so hard to push you away  
Im saying all the words you used to say  
Its turned around youve turned away  
Now theres only one thing on my mind  
Its taken me some time girl  
Im ready now to lay it on the line  
I hope you want to try still you know I will  
Dont give up when youre so close  
Dont give up when youre almost there  
Dont give up when youre so close  
I almost care  
Dont give up when you almost care  
Now theres only one thing on my mind  
I hope you want to try still you know I will  
Dont give up when youre so close  
Dont give up when youre almost there  
Dont give up when youre so close  
I almost care
