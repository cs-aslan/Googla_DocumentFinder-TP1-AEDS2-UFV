Youre so squarebaby  
Youre so square   
Oh you dont like greasy diners  
You dont like sleazy bands  
You just want to go  
To a movie show  
And sit there holding hands  
Youre so square  
Baby I dont care  
  
You dont like going to parties  
To toot and talk all night long  
You just want to park  
Where its nice and dark  
And kiss me sweet and strong  
Youre so square  
Baby I dont care  
  
You dont know any dance steps  
That are new  
But nobody else can love me  
Like you do  
  
I dont know why my heart flips  
I only know it does  
I wonder why  
I love you baby  
I guess its just because  
Youre so square  
Darlin I dont care  
  
Oh I dont know why my heart flips  
I only know it does  
I wonder why  
I love you baby  
I guess its just because  
Youre so square  
I dont care  
  
Youre so square
