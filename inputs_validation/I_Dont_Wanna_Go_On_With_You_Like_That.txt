Ive always said that ones enough to love  
Now I hear youre bragging one is not enough  
Something tells me youre not satisfied  
You got plans to make me one of four or five  
  
I guess this kind of things just in your blood  
But you wont catch me carving up my love  
I aint no puzzle piece that needs to fit  
If it takes more than me lets call it quits  
  
Chorus  
Cause I dont want to go on with you like that  
Dont want to be a feather in your cap  
I just want to tell you honey I aint mad  
But I dont want to go on with you like that  
  
It gets so hard sometimes to understand  
This vicious circles getting out of hand  
Dont need an extra eye to see  
That the fire spreads faster in a breeze  
  
Chorus  
  
No I dont want to go on with you like that  
One more set of boots on your welcome mat  
Youll just have to quit them if you want me back  
cause I dont want to go on with you like that  
  
Oh if you want to spread it around sister thats just fine  
But I dont want no second hand feeding me lines  
If you want to hold someone in the middle of the night  
Call out the guards turn out the light
