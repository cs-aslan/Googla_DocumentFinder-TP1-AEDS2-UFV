I know Ive said Ive changed for you  
But I think Ive changed my mind  
I cant be what you want me to  
And were just wastin time  
  
And Im doing the best I can  
Remember Im just a man  
And my best thing good in love  
Baby thats tough baby thats tough  
  
Im doing the best I can  
Remember Im just a man  
And my best thing good in love  
Baby thats tough baby thats tough  
  
Well Im doing the best I can  
Remember Im just a man  
And my best thing good in love  
Baby thats tough baby thats tough
