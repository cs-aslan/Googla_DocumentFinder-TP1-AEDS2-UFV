Dont chop off his head  
To make yourself look tall  
Dont tear a strip off  
To make yourself feel wonderful  
Who wants to compare  
As if this was a competition  
Leave that to teachers at school  
Must preserve their tradition  
bout time you realized  
You are a specialty  
There is no one like you  
Spend your life worrying  
bout what you could have been  
Cant you like being you  
Dont need a scalp  
Dont need to be a juror  
Take care of yourself  
No need to feel so insecure  
Waste of energy  
To prove a holier than him  
Waste of energy  
To find out who commits what sin  
bout time you realized  
You are a specialty  
There is no one like you  
Spend your life worrying  
bout what could have been  
Cant you like being you  
Dont chop off his head   
bout time you realized
