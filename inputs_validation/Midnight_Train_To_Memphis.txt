I was hiding from the sun once again  
I was running from time my friend  
Ive lost another war  
So I poured one more and went home drunk again  
  
She was up when the key hit the lock  
And the clock looked at me just like the devil in disguise  
I saw it in her eyes  
Shed be gone before the evening  
  
So I poured another strong one  
And chopped a line from here to Texas  
Cause Ive lost another good one  
Shes on the midnight train to Memphis  
  
With a brand new start  
I swore Id love from the heart  
I meant to change my ways  
But Ive seen better days  
  
Than the one thats here this morning mmhm  
With a wife and kids at home  
With a job somewhere on some assembly line  
I wish I had that life  
I bet you wish you had mine  
  
So I poured another tall one  
And chopped a line from here to Texas  
Cause Ive lost another good one  
Shes on the midnight train to Memphis  
  
Dude what station is this K snooze  
Kid Rock I thought he was the American bad ass  
Hes putting me to sleep  
Nudge me if he gets over five decibels  
I knew his first album was the good one  
  
But thats the way I am and this is how I jam  
All across the land from Alabam to bandstand  
Doped up rebel with an attitude shit  
So fuck a bitch fuck a bitch fuck a bitch  
  
I wont switch wont quit no vices  
Flip the script cause Im a slice the righteous  
Havent you heard I dont refrain  
Free as a bird and so I wont change  
  
Livin it up givin it up fuckin shit up what  
Im a run the track from the D to Nantucket  
So fuck it if you dont dig that you can suck it  
Yeah and it dont and it dont  
  
With an old suitcase I swear Ill leave this place  
Ill get you back in time cant drink you off my mind  
So Ill see you when Im sober  
I been looking for some reasons  
But I aint found one down in Texas  
I been changing with the seasons  
Walked in a new line back to Memphis
