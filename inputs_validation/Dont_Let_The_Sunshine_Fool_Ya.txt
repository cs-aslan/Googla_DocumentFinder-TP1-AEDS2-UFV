Now me and this friend named Streetlife Brown  
We got a bottle of red and walked downtown  
One hand on the jug and one on time  
He said I bet you a dollar against this next line  
I said dont let the sunshine fool ya  
Dont let the bluebirds tool ya  
Dont let the women do ya  
Put your hand in mine  
Oh advice is fine if youve got a mind  
To listen to the end thats got the time  
But the musell get ya if you dont watch out  
Hes equipped to know what its all about  
dont let the sunshine fool ya  
Dont let the bluebirds tool ya  
Dont let the women do ya  
Put your hand in mine  
Oh Fanon street in the afternoon is  
An easy way to get out of tune  
But the hard soap salesman he said No dice  
When I asked politely for a better price  
He said dont let that sunshine fool ya  
Dont let the bluebirds tool ya  
Dont let the women do ya  
Put your hand in mine  
Well heres a song for you child of mine  
I hope you make it through this time  
Get yourself a piece of that rainbow pie  
No reason in the world you cant get by  
But dont let the sunshine fool ya  
And dont let the bluebirds tool ya  
And dont let the women do ya  
Put your hand in mine  
Oh dont let the sunshine fool ya  
Dont let the bluebirds tool ya  
Dont let the women do ya  
Put your hand in mine  
Oh dont let the sunshine fool ya
