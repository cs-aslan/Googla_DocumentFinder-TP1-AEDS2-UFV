Freedom  
Calls my name  
  
Serenity  
Keeps me sane  
  
Happiness  
It dulls the pain  
  
Honor  
To save my fate  
  
Hoping  
To run away  
  
Willingness  
To understand  
  
Justice  
For you not judge  
  
Courtesy  
For all to start  
  
Kindness  
Its not that hard  
  
Selfrestraint  
The self impaired  
  
Inventory  
My daily bread  
  
Analysis  
Until youre gone  
  
Look in the mirror  
What do you see  
The shattered fortress that once built me  
  
Faithful ascent through darkest fires  
Ive found the path to take me higher  
  
Youre smart enough for me to trust  
Go live your life now  
Just keep these steps in your life  
  
And youll know how  
  
If youre not sure ask yourself  
Have I done to them  
  
As I would have them do to me  
  
Look in the mirror  
Whats that you see  
The shattered fortress fly now be free  
  
Faithful ascent through darkest fires  
Ive found the path to take me higher  
  
I once thought it better to be right  
But now I have finally seen the light  
Sometimes youve got to be wrong and learn from mistakes  
I live with serenity now not selfrighteous hate  
  
help me be a channel of thy peace  
That were there is hatred I may bring love  
that were there is wrong I may bring the spirit of forgiveness  
that were there is discord I may bring harmony  
that were there is error I may bring truth  
that were there is doubt I may bring faith  
  
Now that you can see all you have done  
that were there is despair I may bring hope that were there is shadow I
may bring light  
  
Its time to take that step into the kingdom  
that were there is sadness I may bring joy  
  
All your sins will help to make you strong  
that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted  
That I may seek to understand rather than to be understood  
  
And help you break right through the prison wall  
that I may seek to love rather than to be loved  
For it is by selfforgetting that one finds  
It is by forgiving that one is forgiven  
  
Keep all of me the desires  
  
That once burned me deep inside  
Help me live today and help to give me grace  
To carry out your ways  
  
I am ready help me be all I can be  
I am ready help guide me and keep me brave  
  
I am responsible when anyone anywhere  
Reaches out for help I want my hand to be there  
I am responsible when anyone anywhere  
Reaches out for help I want my hand to be there
