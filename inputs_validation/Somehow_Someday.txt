So the blue bird will fly oer the world and the stars  
In the moonlight we prays for forgiveness thats ours  
Only now can she rest from the singing of songs  
And the freedom of love  
  
Chances are when you give the love you have  
You will find it coming right back  
Giving into the love  
You know its right  
Its a feeling youll long remember  
  
Hearts will be chosen  
Somehow  
Someday  
Hearts will be chosen  
  
Sailing into the dreams of what could be  
Reaching out for some form of contact  
Waiting for the one you know is right  
All youre needing to do  
Surrender  
  
Someday  
Hearts will be chosen  
Somehow  
Someday  
Hearts will be chosen  
  
So many times on the clouds of forgiveness  
We walk through the country and feel so at ease  
A gentle reminder how things really are  
In the homelands of love  
  
Face to face with the one you really love  
Moving forward down the right track  
Chances are when you give all that you have  
You will find it flooding right back  
  
Someday  
Hearts will be chosen  
Somehow  
Someday  
Hearts will be chosen  
  
Oer the green mountains and oer the green valleys  
The bluebird of faith sails far off to the shore  
She sleeps on the breeze of the coming of love  
For the homelands of Ireland  
  
So many times on the clouds of forgiveness  
We walk through the country and feel so at ease  
A gentle reminder how things really are  
In the homelands of love  
  
So the blue bird will fly oer the world and the stars  
In the moonlight she prays for forgiveness thats ours  
Only now can she rest from the singing of songs  
And the freedom of love
