Wont you take me  
Wont you take me to the edge of night and make me  
Wont you make me walk into the light  
And therell be no eyes  
No eyes that see such beauty would lose their sight  
And therell be no lies  
No lies that you could tell me to make things right  
  
Cos I gave all my money to people and things  
And the price Im still playing for the shit that it brings  
Doesnt fill me with hope for the songs that you sing  
Tonight this is your life  
Angel child  
  
When you find out  
When you find out who you are you know youll be free  
To see your own ability  
But therell be no eyes  
No eyes that see such beauty would lose their sight  
And therell be no lies  
No lies that you could tell me to make things right  
  
Cos I gave all my money to people and things  
And the price Im still playing for the shit that it brings  
Doesnt fill me with hope for the songs that you sing  
Tonight this is your life  
Angel child  
Tonight this is your life this is your life  
Angel child of mine  
  
Tonight this is your life this is your life  
Angel child  
Tonight this is your life this is your life  
Angel child of mine  
Tonight this is your life this is your life  
Angel child  
Tonight this is your life this is your life  
Angel child
