Do you love me for me though  
The real me not my fly alterego  
I know Im never not fly  
But if I ever was would you still ride  
  
If its early in the morning and my breath stink  
Would you still roll over kissing on me like it aint  
If I didnt have millions in the bank  
Im talking cardboard box and a fish tank  
Better yet a fish bowl  
And if the fame got old  
If the cameras didnt flash when I walk through  
If I wasnt makin them bands when I walk through  
Is it where I lost you  
Or is you holding me down  
You never let em bring me down  
All the haters in the world right now  
Would you add to the stress  
Or would you make it easy  
  
For me to take it easy  
Thats what Im lookin for  
Baby let me know would you make it easy  
Easy for me to chill easy for us to feel  
Easy to take it easy  
Thats what Im looking for  
Baby let me know eh  
  
Uh girl I know what I need  
Se appeal intelligence positive energy  
When the drama comes she become serenity  
Lady when I need a lady freak when I need a freak  
Shawty ride like me like I ride the beat  
Everything bout her quality  
Why I send her and her girls to Dubai for bout a week  
Just a little reward for for when she hold me down  
Never let em bring me down  
All the haters in the world right now  
Youre the one that Im lookin for to make it easy  
  
Baby girl  
For me to take it easy  
Thats what Im lookin for  
Baby let me know would you make it easy  
Easy for me to chill easy for us to feel  
Easy to take it easy  
Thats what Im looking for  
Baby let me know eh

We got trips to take if you cool with that  
Show me that you got my back  
Let me see that you got my back  
Then well get into all that

You have to make it easy  
For me to take it easy  
Thats what Im lookin for  
Baby let me know would you make it easy  
Easy for me to chill easy for us to feel  
Easy to take it easy
