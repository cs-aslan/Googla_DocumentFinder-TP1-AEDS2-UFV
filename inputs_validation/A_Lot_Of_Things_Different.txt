Id spent a lot more time in the pouring rain covering my head  
And Id stood up to that bully when he pushed and called me names  
I was to afraid  
And Id gone on and saw Elvis that night he came to town  
Mama said I couldnt  
Id went skinny dippin with Jenny Carson that time she dared me to  
I didnt  
Oooh I Id done a lot of things different  
  
I wish I woulda spent more time with my dad when he was alive  
Now I dont have the chance  
I wish I wouldve told my brother how much I loved him before he went off to
war  
But I just shook his hand  
I wish Id gone to church on Sunday morning when my grandma begged me to  
But I was afraid to go  
I wish Id woulda listened when they said boy your gunna wish you hadnt  
But I wouldnt  
Oooh I Id dont a lot of things different  
  
People say they wouldnt change a thing  
Even if they could  
Oooh but I would  
  
There was this red dress she wanted one time so bad she could taste it  
I shouldve bought it  
But I didnt  
She wanted to paint our bedroom yellow trimed in blues and greens  
But I wouldnt let her  
It wouldnt have hurt nothin  
She loved to be held and kisses and touched  
But I didnt do it  
Not nearly enough  
And if Id known that dance was gunna be our last dance  
Id asked that band to play  
On and on  
Ooon and ooon  
Oooh I Id done a lot of things different  
  
People say they wouldnt change a thing  
Even if they could  
Oooh but I would  
Ooooh oooh  
Oooh I Id done a lot of things different  
Oooh I Id done a lot of things  
I think wed all do a lot of things different
