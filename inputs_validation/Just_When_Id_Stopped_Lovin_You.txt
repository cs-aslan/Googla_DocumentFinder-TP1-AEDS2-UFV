3 oclock in the mornin when the telephone started ringin  
I had a feelin it wouldd be you  
Id didnt want to take it but I let my imagination think  
Of some kind of trouble you gotten into  
And I just had to answer n you had to stop cryin  
And I I tried to fight it  
But I thought if I didnt listen to you  
That I wouldnt be much of a friend  
I let you come over n cry on my shoulder  
For the hundredth time over again  
And all those old emotions came rainin out of the room  
Just when I thought Id stopped lovin you  
  
You got a way of knowin when Im on the edge of givin in  
And how to use those beautiful eyes  
So if one day youre askin me if I ever thought that maybe  
We outta give it one more try  
And I just had to answer n you you had to start smilin  
And I thought about lyin  
But I thought if I wasnt honest with you  
That I wouldnt be much of a friend  
I let you come over n cry on my shoulder  
For the hundredth time over again  
And all those old emotions came rainin out of the room  
Just when I thought Id stopped lovin you  
  
Oh I hate you for makin me crazy  
So why is it that I  
I keep on takin you right back baby  
But I thought if I didnt listen to you  
That I wouldnt be much of a friend  
I let you come over n cry on my shoulder  
For the hundredth time over again  
And all those old emotions came rainin out of the room  
Just when I thought Id stopped lovin you  
Just when I thought Id stopped lovin you  
  
You take two steps down the highway  
But you come runnin back  
What am I supposed to do  
What am I supposed to do  
What am I supposed to do with that  
Wrap my arms around you  
Yeah eh yeah
