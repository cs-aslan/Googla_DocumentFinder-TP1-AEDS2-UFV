Ill chase it away Ill chase it away Ill chase it babe  
Ill chase it away Ill chase it away Ill chase it babe  
  
I was here before when I been born  
I was loved once Now mine  
Lessons learned  
Now Im so afraid to loose control  
So my heart says yes I still say no  
Im chasing your love Im chasing your love away  
One taste of your love and Im chasing your love away  
  
They say nothing ventured is nothing gained  
I dont know if falling in love is ever worth the pain  
If I bathe in your river then I may drown  
  
So the chance of a lifetime Ill turn it down  
Im chasing your love Im chasing your love away  
One taste of your love and Im chasing your love away  
  
Oh maybe this could last forever baby I dont know  
But I dont wanna wait forever baby you should go  
Im chasing your love Im chasing your love away  
One taste of your love and Im chasing your love away  
Im chasing your love Im chasing your love away  
One taste of your love and Im chasing your love away
