I bet you think the Stuarts were an English dynasty  
But we only came to England when the crown belonged to me  
Our clan may hail from Scotland  
But our tales are not a bonnie one youll see  
  
We got the blue blooded blues  
In our blue Stuart shoes  
Each king queen and heir  
Had a personal nightmare  
Have you heard the news  
We got the blue blooded blues  
  
Lets start with me King Robert iii  
Some say I was a fool  
Once fell off my horse and hurt my self  
Quite badly how uncool  
Ended up with a limp  
And limp was what they called my rule  
And I tell you for why  
  
We got the blue blooded blues  
Strapping sons he had two  
One in prison starved in jail  
The other captured epic fail  
The worst of kings my review  
I got the blue blooded blues  
  
The next Stuarts all called James  
But none was lucky Jim  
James I hid down a sewer  
Got caught by assassins  
James ii was less unpopular  
But killed by his own cannon so pretty dim  
And it doesnt end there Youre not wrong  
  
We got the blue blooded blues  
So many ways to lose  
3 and 4 killed in battle  
5 lost at war and thatll  
Explain why we got confused  
About the Stuart clan blues  
Sing it Mary go on girl  
  
Im Mary queen of Scots  
Misfortune I had lots  
To Queen Liz was a threat  
She threw me into prison yeah  
Still accused me of plottin  
Can you see where Im heading  
Liz is a Tudor take a guess  
Beheaded Yeah  
  
Well after queen Liz died  
I was made King of England too  
Became James the first in England  
But the Stuart luck stayed true  
Guy Fawkes try to blow me up  
And turn me into Stuart stew  
  
One more time Yeah   
We got the blue blooded blues  
Not the role I would choose  
With my son Charles a decapitee  
We briefly killed off royalty  
Stuart mourners its true  
Cause were the blue blooded blues  
Thats what Im talking about
