Well theres a jukebox in my ear  
Playing so loud I can hardly hear  
And its telling a story  
About a boy like you  
  
And each selection that I make  
Tells me how my heart will break  
Falling in love with a cowboy like you  
  
When its just an old machine  
Without a heart but oh so mean  
Says Ill probably spend my whole life feeling blue  
So Ill just put in one more dime  
And play that same song one more time  
Cause I want to hear about a cowboy like you  
  
Repeat Verse number three  
I guess that I should go on home  
But I cant stand to be alone  
Cause Ill only dream about  
A cowboy like you  
Yeah Ill only dream about  
A cowboy like you
