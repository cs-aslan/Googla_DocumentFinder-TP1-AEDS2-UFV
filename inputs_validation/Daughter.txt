You and I can see whats going wrong  
We know we dont like it going wrong  
Daughter can you have sons for yourself  
Daughter can you have some for yourself  
  
All your whiskered friends their wings and life  
Who knows what o ever reason why  
Daughter can you have sons for yourself  
Daughter can you have some for yourself  
  
Listen to the sounds of lowry pride  
Seen her in the truth within her life  
Daughter can you have sons for yourself  
Daughter can you have some for yourself
