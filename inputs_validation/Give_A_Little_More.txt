Now youve been bad and it goes on and on and on  
Til you come home babe til you come home  
You taste past the poison you learned to love is gone  
Im all alone baby Im all alone  
  
Im waiting for something always waiting  
Feeling nothing wondering if itll ever change  
And then I give a little more oh babe  
Oh I give a little more oh babe  
  
Im not fallin in love with ya Im not fallin in love  
And Im not fallin in love with ya Im not fallin in love  
Til I get a little more from you baby  
Oh get a little more from you babe  
  
You were wrong for turning me on and on and on  
And on and on yeah  
You make it so hard  
  
Im waiting for something always waiting  
Feeling nothing wondering if itll ever change if itll ever change  
Then I give a little more oh babe  
Oh give a little more oh babe  
  
Im not fallin in love with ya Im not fallin in love  
And Im not gonna love with ya Im not gonna love  
Til I get a little more from you baby  
I get a little more from you babe  
  
I have no defense  
I know youre gonna get me in the end  
And I cannot pretend  
I never wanna feel this way again  
  
Im not fallin in love with ya Im not fallin in love  
And Im not fallin in love with ya Im not fallin in love  
Til I get a little more from you baby  
Oh get a little more from you babe  
  
Im not gonna love with ya Im not gonna love  
And Im not gonna love with ya Im not fallin in love  
Til I get a little more from you baby  
Oh get a little more from you babe
