I walked through this place although it wasnt really there  
And when I reached the other side thought I didnt really care  
I moved round a bit and started seeing people  
And the people that I met oh were all covered in treacle  
  
Everyone was laughing everyone except for poor old me  
So I tried to entertain them oh but they were hard to please  
As time went by oh backwards I walked  
Backwards I talked and backwards I laughed
