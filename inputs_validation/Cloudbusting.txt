I still dream of Orgonon  
I wake up crying  
Youre making rain  
And youre just in reach  
When you and sleep escape me  
  
Youre like my yoyo  
That glowed in the dark  
What made it special  
Made it dangerous  
So I bury it  
And forget  
  
But every time it rains  
Youre here in my head  
Like the sun coming out  
Ooh I just know that something good is going to happen  
And I dont know when  
But just saying it could even make it happen  
  
On top of the world  
Looking over the edge  
You could see them coming  
You looked too small  
In their big black car  
To be a threat to the men in power  
  
I hid my yoyo  
In the garden  
I cant hide you  
From the government  
Oh God Daddy  
I wont forget  
  
Cause every time it rains  
Youre here in my head  
Like the sun coming out  
Ooh I just know that something good is going to happen  
And I dont know when  
But just saying it could even make it happen  
  
The suns coming out  
Your sons coming out
