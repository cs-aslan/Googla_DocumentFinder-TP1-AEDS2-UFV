If you could find a dry way Id forever be still

Give me a million reasons

About a million reasons

To cut through all his worn out leather  
Ive got a hundred million reasons to walk away  
But baby I just need one good one to stay

Give me a million reasons

About a million reasons  
  
And if you say something that you might even mean  
Its hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
