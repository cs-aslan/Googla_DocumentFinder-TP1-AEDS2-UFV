Keep the fire burnin  
Let it keep us warm  
The world will keep on turnin  
Let it turn you on  
  
And let us not stop learnin  
We can help one another be strong  
Let us never lose our yearnin  
To keep the fire burnin all night long  
  
Youve been changing so much  
Im not sure your in touch with whats real  
You just come and you go  
Never letting me know how you feel  
  
And Im livin here in doubt  
Theres so much to talk about  
I know that we can work it out  
  
We can keep the fire burnin  
Let it keep us warm  
The world will keep on turnin  
Let it turn you on  
  
And let us not stop learnin  
We can help one another be strong  
Let us never lose our yearnin  
To keep the fire burnin all night long  
  
Weve been through this enough  
It gets rough but theres nowhere to run  
This is where we belong  
We are strong we can never give up  
  
If we wanted to we could  
But weve always understood  
To keep lookin for the good  
  
Keep the fire burnin  
Let it keep us warm  
The world will keep on turnin  
Let it turn you on  
  
And let us not stop learnin  
We can help one another be strong  
Let us never lose our yearnin  
To keep the fire burnin  
  
Keep the fire burnin  
Let it keep us warm  
The world will keep on turnin  
Let it turn you on  
  
And let us not stop learnin  
We can help one another be strong  
Let us never lose our yearnin  
To keep the fire burnin all night long  
  
Keep the fire burnin  
Keep the fire burnin  
Keep the fire burnin
