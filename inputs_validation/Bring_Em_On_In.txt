Sings  
See them stumbling by the way side  
See them stumbling by the way side  
Though it wont sail cross the water yeah  
Rowin boats across the water  
Pick them up baby row them on  
Bring em on in bring em on home  
  
Well I was driving in my Jagyouare  
Doin ninety miles an hour  
I was driving up a clear way  
It was just my luckiest day  
An I kept speed up  
An I rowed these boats  
Abring em on in  
Abring em on in  
  
Bidoa didoa didoado  
  
Now I went walking down by Queensway  
When I met a friend of mine  
He said Come on back back to my pad  
We will have a nice time  
If you pick me up row me on  
Bring me in bring me in  
  
When I stepped off the boat  
And I walked upon the dry land  
Slowly to the car park  
And I jumped in out of my mind  
Out of my mind  
Bring em in bring em on in bring em in  
  
Ayolotta oliotta oliotta oliotta  
Oliotta oah  
  
Bring em in baby bring em on in
