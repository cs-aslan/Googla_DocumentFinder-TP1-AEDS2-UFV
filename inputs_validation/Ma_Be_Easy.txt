Uh uh yeah uhhuh  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Verse 1  
Yo I aint got no reason to trick or spend  
Mami Im the reason the chicks begin cheesein and snickering  
Player like me every season these chicks have been  
Talking how I came through the Ps in a sicker Benz  
Heard about the platinum visas the bricker bends  
Jewels so icey I need freezers to stick em in  
I bes in the keys with a click of friends  
Trees and a liquor blend I be too queezy and sick to grin  
I dont care if a skeezer is thick or thin  
Its going look like she having a seizure I stick it in  
Skeos say can I get the keys to ya six again  
After I nut thats when amnesia be kicking in  
Most broads I done met aint see a guy  
Who spend a G on Gucci Ts five for sweats  
Im what chicks strive to get I stay in the PJs  
You thinking Im talking private jets uh  
  
Chorus  
I need the cash in my palm the ice in my charm ma be easy  
Watch it please  
Want to lean to the side while I cruise in your ride ma be easy  
Put down that cheese  
Gotta have a broad wanting and let me hold something ma be easy  
You get nothing from me  
You get nothing  
  
Verse 2  
So the kid never stresses a female  
And if you ask where I live they gon give you  
Addresses to email  
All that cops can suggest is that he sell  
How Im goin push it unless its a v12  
From Ss to CLs I request is  
In the head rests his TVs dwell  
They heard how many albums I presses for retail  
And they cant get a dime unless its a weed sale  
And lets be real catch me at the bar wit them crispy bills  
Getting Cris refills my wrist be chilled  
And my wardrobe look like I got an Ice Berg History deal  
Still dames have been giving me slow neck  
And I dont even know what they real names have been  
I feel ashamed to spend cause when it comes to knocking em down  
Im right behind Wilt Chamberlin  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
Ma you must of had too many weed totes  
Cause I aint giving you any seenotes  
Im all about floating on them new skinny speed boats  
Hundred and something with two skinny deep throats  
Winter hit Im in a new finny ski coat  
See the screens aint gotta use any remotes  
No more shopping sprees Im rough wit the ends  
Keep honeys on their knees scuffin they shins  
I deal wit nothing but tens  
I be the club king wit diamonds shuffling your friends  
Chickens get keys scuffing the Benz  
Cause they want to lock me down like Im Puff in the pens  
Snatch any chink blond who feel my link long view  
One try I aint trying to put clinks on you  
Hope tricking aint one of the things you think John do  
Cause thats the way you end up wit a drink on you mami  
  
Chorus
