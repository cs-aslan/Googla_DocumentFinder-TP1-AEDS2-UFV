Once in a while I need a friend  
So why wont you let me recover  
Its just a moment in your life  
But sometimes we divide each other  
  
Maybe we could find a time  
Eliminate whats on your mind  
Wed do everything we could  
Our presence in the neighborhood  
  
We could break every rule  
Anytime we wanted to  
Dont be afraid to live this way  
Lets defend the things we say  
  
I want to be up in the air  
I could be anywhere  
Tell me Im wrong at least till tomorrow  
Set me free and I will follow  
  
Maybe we could find a time  
To elevate whats on your mind  
Recreate for me and you  
A master plan just for two  
  
We could break every rule  
Anytime we wanted to  
Dont be afraid to live this way  
Lets defend the things we say  
  
Elevate whats on your mind  
Eliminate whats on your mind
