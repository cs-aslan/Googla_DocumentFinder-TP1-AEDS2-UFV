Im flowing crazy I need to stop this  
Dont knock this  
You niggas lazy yall need to watch this  
Preposterous  
If you can fathem how you can block this  
My phantom was seen on candler  
You ride the transit  
No options you niggas cant act like yall forgot this Im tired  
But switch ya flow up its so monotonous its my metropolis  
Ill drop a 12 on ya so colossus  
My swag plus my drop top yellow jag why they gossip  
Im the nigga upload your twitter bitch Im the topic  
Profess it but  
Gucci didnt graduate from college  
Your girlfriend says my ear rings are erotic  
My lambo doors open upward theyre robotic its Gucci  
  
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool  
Birds in the living room its like Atlanta zoo  
Lions tigers minks crocs and gators for my shoes  
Monkey niggas in my hood Im living in the zoo  
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too  
Im a tiger in the bedroom ask your baby boo  
I got lions tigers bears in my hood and closet too  
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo Gucci  
  
Drop beam  
Off set things color ice cream  
White dreams  
She can fuck me thats a pipe dream  
SO poppin xpills so exciting  
My ex chick n ex homeboy uninvited  
Cases of ace of spade bitch getcha wasted  
The waitress I made her reloaded like the matrix  
I lean laid with a bad bitch black n Asian  
On 20 headed to buckhead Im racing baby  
But take that fake jewelery off that shit is fugasey  
You think that youre hotter than the kid youre mistaken  
Real n you niggas really really good at faken  
So trill Im a keep it real Im back to the basics  
  
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool  
Birds in the living room its like Atlanta zoo  
Lions tigers minks crocs and gators for my shoes  
Monkey niggas in my hood Im living in the zoo  
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too  
Im a tiger in the bedroom ask your baby boo  
I got lions tigers bears in my hood and closet too  
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo Gucci  
  
Heads up  
My partner stashin bricks up on his roof top  
Whole key half a key quarter key  
Gucci got more quarters than a motherfuckin jukebox  
Poppop hear the glock cock  
And I gotta Colt 45 like Billy D  
Semi automatic that I keep up in the attic in shank  
That shape like Tennessee ugh  
I cut ya  
I cut ya til the white meat  
And my partner pushin more crack than a bike seat  
I smoke the best I get my dro from California  
Get high n go to sleep you couldnt wake me from a coma  
I might wake up if these rappers got beef I smell the aroma  
But these niggas aint got no heart not even if they had a doner  
I roam the streets so who the fuck is YOU  
Southside Collipark king of the jungle my name is Ludacris living in Atlanta
zoo  
  
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool  
Birds in the living room its like Atlanta zoo  
Lions tigers minks crocs and gators for my shoes  
Monkey niggas in my hood Im living in the zoo  
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too  
Im a tiger in the bedroom ask your baby boo  
I got lions tigers bears in my hood and closet too  
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo gucci
