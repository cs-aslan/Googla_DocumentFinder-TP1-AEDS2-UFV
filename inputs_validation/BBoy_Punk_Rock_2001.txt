Ha Ha  
Whitey Ford  
Xecutioners Style  
  
MC am I  
People call me Ev  
When Im busting up the party hear my engine rev  
With high resolution in the late pm  
XMen scratch this beat while I drop this gem  
Got tints on my window so you cant see in  
Pack it up pack it in baby once again  
Aint no way to check me check me  
No way to wreck me wreck me  
When shit gets hectic if you disrespect me  
While you stare at my knife imma see my life  
On the top of the mall kid can build me right  
You know it aint right but yo its ok  
Cuz see  
This type of shit happens every day  
Cuz see  
This type of shit happens every day  
XMen Everlast  
You know  
This type of shit happens every day  
  
It go  
One for the thugs  
Two for the chickens  
Peckerwoods stats classic like Slim Pickins  
Cut the democrats and republicans  
Got all your cars bouncing like a bunch of mexicans  
Quarterrock style I Touch you like Tony  
You claim you keeping it real but still coming out phoney  
Just one MC and four DJs  
Give them six turntables and a mic to blaze  
Now imma set it like Run  
In the house of Fun  
I burn hotter than the heat thats made by sun  
Got a gun and a uzi  
But it weighs a ton

The world keeps spinning  
XMen keep winning
