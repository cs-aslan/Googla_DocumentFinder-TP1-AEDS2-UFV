Just A name  
Writer Sonny Bono  
  
Its just a name its just a name  
Its not too long and its kinda plain  
Hes just a guy just a little guy  
And hes not too brave not too shy  
And hell never make me stay  
And hes not very much of a mystery  
Hes not even handsome nor is he tall  
But theres no way I could live at all  
Without his funny name  
  
Hes just a guy just a little guy  
That can make me laugh  
That can make me cry  
Did I mention this before  
Hes got all I want and even more  
But he gives me all that he has to give  
And I guess thats why I just couldnt live  
Without his funny name  
  
Shes just a girl shes just a girl  
Her hair is straight she dont have a curl  
Shes not so hot I mean whats she got  
Shes got all that I want and even more  
Shes the girl I love that I adore  
Cause she gives me all that she has to give  
And I guess thats why I just couldnt live  
Without her funny name  
  
Just a name  
Its just a name  
Its just a name  
Its just a name
