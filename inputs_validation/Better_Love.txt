Lately I toss and turn at night  
I hold my pillow very tight  
Wake up to find the covers on the floor  
I cant go on since you been gone  
Sometimes I dont know what Im living for  
  
See I dont know what he told you bout the better life  
His better cars and how he can treat you better  
But none of that will keep you warm at night  
Hell give you more  
But who could have a better love  
  
Better love  
A better love  
A better better love  
Who could love you better  
  
There is no reason  
Honey you should ever worry what Im doing  
While youre gone Im being true to you  
My fire burns for your return  
And Ill just dream of you until you do  
  
See I never could replace your love with anyones  
I do believe its easier said than done  
No matter whose promises you dream of  
Go search the world  
You couldnt find a better love
