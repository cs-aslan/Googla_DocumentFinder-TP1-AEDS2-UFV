Another Saturday night  
By Jimmy Buffett  
  
Another Saturday night and I aint got nobody  
Ive got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had someone to talk to  
Im in an awful way  
  
I got in town a month ago  
Ive seen a lot of girls since then  
If I could meet em I could get em  
But as yet I havent met em  
Thats why Im in the shape Im in  
  
Oh another Saturday night and I aint got nobody  
Ive got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had someone to talk to  
Im in an awful way  
  
Now another fella told me  
He had a sister who looked just fine  
Instead of being my deliverance  
She had a strange resemblance  
To a cat name Frankenstein  
  
Oh another Saturday night and I aint got nobody  
Ive got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had some chick to talk to  
Im in an awful way  
  
Yeah another Saturday night and I aint got nobody  
Ive got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had someone to talk to  
Im in an awful way  
  
Its hard on a fella  
When he dont know his way around  
If I dont find me a honey  
To help me spend this money  
Im headin back to key west town  
  
Oh another Saturday night and I aint got nobody  
Ive got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had someone to talk to  
Im in an awful way  
  
Just another Saturday night and I aint got nobody  
Ive got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had some chick to talk to  
Im in an awful way  
  
Its awful all dressed up and no place to go no one to help me spend  
My flow another Saturday night get me the pizza man
