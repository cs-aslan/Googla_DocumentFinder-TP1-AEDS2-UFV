These are the last tears Im gonna cry for you  
My cryins through Im moving on  
I dont regret and wont forget  
A single thing that we went through  
But these are the last tears Im gonna cry for you  
You take things so much easier than I do  
And you could live your life without me if you had to  
And you believe that in the end it all works out right  
And I might if not for you  
And if you ask one which one lives just alone for love  
I do  
These are the last tears Im gonna cry for you  
My cryins through Im moving on  
I dont regret and wont forget  
A single thing that we went through  
But these are the last tears Im gonna cry for you  
There was a time when all signs pointed to the warm south  
The planets all lined up and built a new house  
And everything we talked about felt like a prophecy  
And when you looked at me they all came true  
And if you asked which one wants to go the distance  
I do  
But these are the last tears Im gonna cry for you  
My cryins through Im moving on  
I dont regret and wont forget  
A single thing that we went through  
But these are the last tears Im gonna cry for you  
Im gonna rack my mind one last time until I cannot think  
Im gonna dip into your memory and take a good stiff drink  
And when Im drunk on the last drop of sadness about how we went wrong  
Im gonna play this song  
Make some coffee black and strong  
Give thanks for healing time  
Finally make up my mind  
These are the last tears Im gonna cry for you  
Baby my cryins through Im moving on  
I dont regret and wont forget  
A single thing that we went through  
But these are the last tears Im gonna cry for you  
These are the last tearsIm gonna cry for you
