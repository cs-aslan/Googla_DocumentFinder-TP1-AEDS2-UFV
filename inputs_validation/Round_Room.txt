My room is tound when I lay dowm when I wake up its sqare  
When I go outside its on a spiral set of stairs  
The people that souround me are waiting out there  
In a round room they cant find me anywhere  
  
Right angle rooms drive me craizer each day  
Put me in a box I know Im never going to play  
Put me in a square room and I wont know what to say  
I want a round room at the end of the day  
  
I had an apartment four corners on the walls  
couldnt eat couldnt sleep there at all  
I want a curve to the place where I stay  
I want a round room at the end of the day  
  
If I pass out take me to the round church  
where echoes resound  
and my spirit is found  
and when I float high  
Take my armand Ill fly by you  
The outskirts of town to a garden thats round  
  
I went to the lighthouse and I likes the veiw  
I looked out the window and I could see you  
Put me in a sqare house and I wont have a clue  
I want a round room just to be with you
