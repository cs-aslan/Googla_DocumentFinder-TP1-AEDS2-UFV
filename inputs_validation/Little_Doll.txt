Little doll I cant forget  
Smoking on a cigarette  
In my life a real queen  
Prettiest thing I ever seen  
Uhhuh  
Youre the one who makes me sing  
Bring happiness and everything  
Youre the only real one  
A real way to have some fun  
Uh huh  
But I dont know you little doll  
I dont know you little doll  
Come on shake  
Come on shake  
Come on shake you little doll  
Shake you little doll  
Come on Shake  
Come on shake  
Shake you little doll
