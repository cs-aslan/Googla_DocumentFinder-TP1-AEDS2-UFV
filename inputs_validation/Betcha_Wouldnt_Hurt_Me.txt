Loving you came easily  
Yet it made me blind to all there was to see  
Now my heart is filled with pain  
  
You understand I never will  
How did it come to be that you dont love me still  
Now its getting to be plain  
  
If you really cared about anyone else  
I know you wouldnt hurt me  
If you cared about more than yourself  
I bet ya wouldnt go  
If you really cared about anyone else  
I know you wouldnt hurt me  
If you cared about more than yourself  
You wouldnt walk out the door  
  
Though some days the blues was our parade  
Still we marched through all the tears we made  
Now I find that it wasnt no game of charades that you played  
  
I did my best to bring you joy  
How can you just leave me like a broken toy  
Wheres the man that once was you  
  
If I could be within your mind  
I would never think to treat you this unkind  
The pain you caused will come to you
