Looking back yeah I feel alright  
Getting more than my expectations  
Yeah my future looks clear and bright  
Im living up to my reputation  
  
Yeah Im satisfied  
Yeah until the day I die  
  
I gave my blood and I gave my soul  
I stood my ground and I took control  
The legends growing as the storys told  
I pledge allegiance to the state of rock and roll  
Oh yeah  
  
Ive been a rebel for all my life  
I never cared about regulations  
I only went for the things I liked  
And my guitar was my inspiration  
  
Yeah we pay a price  
Yeah I made the sacrifice  
  
I gave my blood and I gave my soul  
I stood my ground and I took control  
The legends growing as the storys told  
I know that heavens gonna wait  
I pledge allegiance to the state of rock and roll  
  
solo  
  
Yeah Im satisfied  
Yeah until the day I die  
  
I gave my blood and I gave my soul  
I stood my ground and I took control  
The legends growing as the storys told  
I know that heavens gonna wait  
  
I gave my blood and I gave my soul  
I stood my ground and I took control  
The legends growing as the storys told  
I pledge allegiance to the state I pledge allegiance to the state  
Of rock and roll of rock and roll  
  
Rock and roll
