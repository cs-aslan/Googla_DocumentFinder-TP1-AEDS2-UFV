Anyway the wind blows is fine with me  
Anyway the wind blows it dont matter to me  
cause Im through with the fussin and fightin with you  
I went out and found a woman who is gonna be true  
She makes me oh so happy now Im never ever blue  
Anyway the wind blows is fine with me  
Anyway the wind blows it dont matter to me  
cause she treats me like she loves me  
And she never makes me cry  
Im gonna stick with her till the day I die  
Shes not like your baby she would never ever lie  
Anyway the wind blows is fine with me  
Anyway the wind blows it dont matter to me  
Now Im going to go away and leave you standin at the door  
Ill tell you this baby I wont be back any more  
cause you dont even know what love is for  
Anyway the wind blows anyway the wind blows  
Anyway the wind blows anyway the wind blows
