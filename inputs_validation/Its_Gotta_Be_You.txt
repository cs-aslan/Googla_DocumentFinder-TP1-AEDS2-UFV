Baby its the way you make me  
Kinda get me go crazy  
Never want to stop  
Its gotta be you uh huh uh huh  
  
I cant control it anymore  
Ive never felt like this before  
you really make me lose my head  
My hungry heart must be fed uh huh uh huh  
  
Baby its the way you make me  
Kinda get me go crazy  
Never want to stop  
  
Chorus  
Its gotta be you uh huh uh huh  
All the way  
Its gotta be you uh huh uh huh  
Everyday  
I promise you I will be true yeah  
Its only you  
  
Now I know why I was born  
You feel my feelings one by one  
Cant see the world Im walking through  
Cause baby I see only you oh yeah  
  
Baby its the way you make me  
Kinda get me go crazy  
Never want to stop  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby its the way you make me  
Kinda get me go crazy  
Never want to stop  
And you know  
I cant see the world Im walking through  
Cause of you yeah  
Its gotta be you all the way  
All that I ever wanted  
Its gotta be you I will be true yeah  
Its only you  
  
Chorus
