Big Boi  
Time and time again see I be thinking about that future  
Back in the day when we slaves up everyones a cool ass nigga  
But now we vultures slam my nigga back out  
To make his ass black out or even pull your fucking head  
To make his whole crew believers youre harder than a bitch full of dicks  
But that dont be sounding like hes shit to me  
See now in the ghetto or should I say Lakewood  
You better be strapped cause them niggas over there just aint good  
Just being a hustler serving on all your customers  
Rent was due on the 1st of the month so Im hustling  
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo  
And niggas be wanting drinks and shit from the fucking sto yo  
But thats alright tho cause I be getting paid  
And every trip I take theres a dollar to be made  
Im digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five  
Deep there it is now its time to smoke that jive  
  
Chorus x2  
If you smoke a dime then Ill smoke a dime  
  
Hey Dre Let em know whats up  
  
Andre  
Ive been slipping slowly but surely  
Niggas I used to hang wit wants to act like they dont know me  
Come and listen to my story I gots a lot of shit up on my mind  
I wipe the booboo from my brain then I finish your behind  
Take a number I caught you in a slumber  
I hit you for a lick Im in the slammer for the summer  
But now its the fall Im having a ball making my nickels act strong  
To my niggas got to serving when they beep and when they call  
I got the Peter Paul and plus that Mary Jane  
Im rolling reefer out of a Regal how could I refrain  
From being rough from being tough from being dangerous  
Im hanging with the PA Niggas aint no gankin us  
See you can try if you try if you dont you dont  
If you want to battle its either that you will or you wont  
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke  
If you got some fly shit yo niggas gonna how we tote  
Dope is not what I be slanging on this track  
Niggas dont comprehend that it be deeper that Cadillacs  
You know that right you bite you fucked up  
You wont be getting away this time Im real as hell so whats up  
I rip shit wit pimp shit Im flinging it from the south  
Talk bad about the A town Ill bust you in your fucking mouth  
  
Chorus
