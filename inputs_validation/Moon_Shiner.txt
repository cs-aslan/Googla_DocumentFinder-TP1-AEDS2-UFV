Ive been a moonshiner  
For seventeen long years  
And I spent all my money  
On whisky and beer  
And I go to some hollow  
And set up my still  
If whisky dont kill me  
Lord I dont know what will  
  
And I go to some barroom  
To drink with my friends  
Where the women they cant follow  
To see what I spend  
God bless them pretty women  
I wish they was mine  
With breath as sweet as  
The dew on the vine  
  
Let me eat when Im hungry  
Let me drink when Im dry  
Two dollars when Im hard up  
Religion when I die  
The whole world is a bottle  
And life is but a dram  
When the bottle gets empty  
Lord it sure aint worth a damn
