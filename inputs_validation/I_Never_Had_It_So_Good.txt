I never had much money  
I never won a race  
My jokes dont end that funny  
And I had door slammed on my face  
But I think youve charmed me  
I always hoped that someone would  
I never had a love like this before  
  
No I never had it so good  
Im not the type thats trusted  
Always tripping over logs  
And often Ive been busted  
And chased by friendly dogs  
But I think youve charmed me  
I always hoped that someone would  
I never had a love like this before  
  
No I never had it so good  
Hm  
But I think youve charmed me  
I always hoped that someone would  
I never had a love like this before  
No I never had it so good
