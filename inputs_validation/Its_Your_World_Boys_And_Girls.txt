Well this old lonely lonely street  
Reminds me of a dream that I once had and then I loost my way  
And them years they just roll and theyre takin their toll  
And I keep payin the cost  
Well Im not tryin to please nobody but me  
But cant you see I tow the line religiously  
Well you wont be here for ever so just hang on to your heart  
And dont let them old deemons tear you apart  
Cause its your world boys and girls  
Its your world til your life is through  
If it was gone tomorrow you wouldnt have anything  
It wouldnt be nothiin without you hey without you  
You can struggle and strive and you can handle your liife  
But they still want blood yeah  
So just stroll like that river and stick to your ground  
Ajust like this old mother earth  
Well I was born free and Ill probly die young  
But Ill leave some happy people with some good songs that Ive sung  
Well you wont be here forever so just hang on to your heart yeah  
And dont let them old deemons tear you apart  
Cause its your world boys and girls  
Its your world til your life is throuough  
If it was gone tomorrow you wouldnt have anything  
It wouldnt be nothin without you hey without you  
Well it wouldnt be nothin noo noothin  
No it wouldnt be nothin without yall  
Well it wouldnt be nothin noo nothin  
Well it wouldnt be nothin without you  
Well it wouldnt be nothin noo noothin  
Well it wouldnt be nothin without you  
Well it wouldnt be nothin no it wouldnt be nothin  
No no no nothin it would be nothin without you yeah  
Well it wouldnt be
