It must be the way that you move inside my head  
Yeah yeah  
Or it must be the songs that you sing to me in bed  
Yeah yeah  
It must be the moon and the sun that sets so red  
Yeah yeah  
Or it could be the stars when were lying under them  
Yeah yeah yeah  
It must be the it must be the  
It must be the it must be the way  
It must be the it must be the  
It must be the it must be the way  
It must be the way that with you I dont pretend  
No no  
And it must be your skin that when I touch just drives me mad  
Yeah  
Or it must be the blues that with you I never have  
Mo no no no  
Its all those little things that you do make me so glad  
Yeah oh yeah  
And Im telling you that I wonder just what it is to me that you do  
Oh  
But I say that it doesnt matter  
Cause all I know is that theres something about you  
Oh  
It must be the it must be the  
It must be the it must be the way  
It must be the it must be the  
It must be the it must be the way  
And I dont know what it is baby that you do  
But it must be the way that keeps me fallin for you  
It must be the it must be the  
It must be the it must be the way  
It must be the it must be the  
It must be the it must be the way  
It must be the it must be the  
It must be the It must be the way  
It must be the It must be the  
It must be the it must be the way
