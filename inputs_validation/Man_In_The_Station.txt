Theres a man in the station and a train in the rain  
Theres a face in the mirror thats showing the strain  
Theres a woman in the dark thats standing apart  
Theres a love in the man thats breaking his heart  
But its alright Im catching the next train home  
The next train home  
Theres one more circle Im dying to try  
Theres a piece of my head thats asking why  
Theres a piece of my heart thats dying to fly  
Theres a baby in the woman thats waiting to cry  
But its alright Im catching the next train home  
The next train home  
Theres got to be a way for a lazy face and  
Get up and start loving the human race  
Theres just got to be a way for a crazy face  
Get out from under this paper chase  
But its alright Im catching the next train home  
Next train home  
Theres a man in the station and a train in the rain  
Theres a face in the mirror thats showing the strain  
Theres a woman in the dark thats standing apart  
Theres a love in the man thats breaking his heart  
But its alright Im catching the next train home  
Next train home
