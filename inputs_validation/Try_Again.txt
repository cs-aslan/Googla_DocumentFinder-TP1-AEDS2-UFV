I cant see your face  
Hear the excuses for  
The mistakes that you make  
Ive heard all your lies  
I dont know how much I can take  
Before I break  
Ive tried to be so strong  
While you broke the promises  
All the vows that we made  
We know somethings wrong  
But we carry on anyway  
Day by day  
Youre the one who let me down  
And now I find it hard to forgive  
In my heart  
  
Chorus  
But Ill try again  
To forget all the pain  
And love you again  
Ill try again  
Though you hurt me I know  
I cant let you go  
  
How can we forget  
The sweetness of yesterday  
We just cant let it go  
Lost in bitterness  
Im losing my self control  
And my soul  
Cause youll be the one who let me down  
And now I find it hard to forgive  
In my mind  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh why why do we hurt each other more  
When theres a way  
Cause we never really found  
What we were looking for  
Can we try again  
  
Cause youre the one who let me down  
And now I find it hard to forgive  
In my heart  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh Ill try again
