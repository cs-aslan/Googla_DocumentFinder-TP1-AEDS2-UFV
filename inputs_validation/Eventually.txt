I am an opportunity and I knock so softly  
Sometimes I get loud when I wish everybodyd just  
Get off me  
So many playas youd think I was a ball game  
Its every man for themself there are no  
Team mates  
This life gets lonely when everybody wants  
Something  
This might have been your fate  
But theyll get theirs eventually  
And I hope Im there  
  
Surrounded by familiar faces without names  
None of them know me or want to share my pain  
And they only wish to bask in my light then fade  
Away  
To win my love to them a game  
To watch me live my life in pain  
When all is done and the glitter fades fades  
Away  
Theyll get theirs eventually  
And I hope Im there  
  
I drank your poison cause you told me its wine  
Shame on you if you fool once  
Shame on me if you fool me twice  
I didnt know the price  
Youll get yours eventually  
  
So what good am I to you if I cant be broken  
Youll get yours yes youll get yours  
Eventually
