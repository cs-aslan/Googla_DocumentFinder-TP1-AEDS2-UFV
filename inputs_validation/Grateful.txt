This is as real as it gets yall  
And it dont get no realer than this  
This is as real as it gets yall huh  
  
Maybe my mother coulda been my father  
Perhaps it was my sister probably my brother  
Maybe the church coulda been the street  
Perhaps it was the guitar or Jerry Wonder beats  
Maybe the money when I didnt have a dime  
Maybe a way out before committing crimes  
Coulda been Lauryn perhaps it was Pras  
Probably the mirror looking dead in my eyes  
Coulda been reggae or the love of hiphop  
Maybe my fans at the show saying dont stop  
Probably the struggle of all refugees  
Maybe the sign how the diamonds blingbling chingching  
Ring ring theres a call from my wifey whoo  
Perhaps I gotta make it home but music keep calling me  
And maybe its all I know whatever it is Im grateful for being  
  
A man with a guitar a dude from the streets  
A cat with a song a ReFugee MC  
Wyclef Jean a Fugee for life  
A preachers son first one on the run  
Im grateful that I havent been shot  
Stopped by the cops and they didnt find a glock  
WYCLEF Im grateful  
  
Coulda been a crack fiend with no place to go  
Lord oh mighty God have mercy on my soul  
Coulda been Pablo king of Yayo  
Or a pimp with a limp screaming we dont love them hoes  
Oh no God knows perhaps I was chosen  
A source of inspiration for the next generation  
And maybe its all I know whatever it is Im grateful for being

Everybody sing along now  
You can make it like I made it  
Dont let anyone tell you different  
When doors close another door will open  
Many have called but my people are chosen  
You can make it if I made it  
Dont let anyone tell you different  
When doors close another door will open yeah  
Many have called but my people are chosen yeah
