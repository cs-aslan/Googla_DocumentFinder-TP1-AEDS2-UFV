Lying alone at night  
Listen to the rain thats falling down  
Youre calling out your babys name  
Ah but she just aint around  
Sleep dont come at all  
You cant ease a troubled mind  
Yeah they call it love  
Ah but its the heartbreak kind  
  
Rumors whispered low  
Theres been talk around the town  
Phone dont ring no more  
Friends they say dont come around  
Suspicion running high  
But she says everythings just fine  
She tells you that its love  
Ah but its the heartbreak kind  
  
Theres darkness all around  
As the evening shadows fall  
Time keeps dragging by  
But she aint coming home at all  
You tell yourself she still cares  
But pretty soon youre gonna find  
You thought it was a lasting love  
Ah but its the heartbreak kind  
You thought it was a lasting love  
Ah but its the heartbreak kind
