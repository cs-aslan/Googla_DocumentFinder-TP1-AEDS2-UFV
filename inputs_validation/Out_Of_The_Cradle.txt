Its not a place its a yearning  
Its not a race its a journey  
Its not an act its attraction  
Its not a style its an action  
  
Its a dream for the waking  
Its a flower touched by flame  
Its a gift for the giving  
Its a power with a hundred names  
  
Surge of energy spark of inspiration  
The breath of love is electricity  
Maybe time is bird in flight  
Endlessly mocking  
Here we come out of the cradle  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking  
  
Its a hand that rocks the cradle  
Its a motion that swings the sky  
Its method on the edge of madness  
Its a balance on the edge of a knife  
Its a smile on the edge of sadness  
Its a dance on the edge of life  
  
Surge of energy spark of inspiration  
The breath of love is electricity  
Here we come out of the cradle  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking  
  
Surge of energy spark of inspiration  
The breath of love is electricity  
Maybe time is bird in flight  
Endlessly rocking  
  
Here we come out of the cradle  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking  
  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking  
  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking endlessly rocking  
  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking
