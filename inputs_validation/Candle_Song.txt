Pray by the candle and I hope to see light  
Wait for the moment but its never right  
So now Im sailing on the oceans so wide  
Im all alone me and my daydreams and I  
Pray by the candle and I hope to see light  
Wait for the moment but its never right  
So Im the captain my ships got a hole in the side  
Im all alone me and my daydreams at night  
Can you see me walking through the trees  
Can you hear me laughing in the breeze  
Can you see me walking through the trees  
Can you hear me laughing in the breeze  
Pray by the candle and I hope to see light  
Wait for the moment but its never right  
Across the water I watch my ship waves goodbye  
Im all alone me and my daydreams at night
