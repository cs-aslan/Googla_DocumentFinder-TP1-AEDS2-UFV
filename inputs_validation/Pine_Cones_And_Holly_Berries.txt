Pine cones and Holly Berries  
Popcorn for you apples for me  
Red striped candy nut cracker handy  
Kettle abubbleing hot as can be  
Snow clouds hang low and threatening  
Maybe in wont praying it may  
The brightest fireplace glows in every face  
Waiting for Christmas day  
  
Therell be walkaround songs and  
Talkaround songs  
Songs of the inn and stable  
Therell be morning time songs and  
Evening time songs  
And grace at every table  
And Jingle bells will jingle all the way all day  
  
Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Everywhere you go
