Always in all ways  
Youll be in my mind  
For always in all ways  
Words have been so hard to find  
  
I still remember you as a child  
Holding you in my arms  
The way you looked up to me  
I thought that Id always be  
Id be there beside you  
For always in all ways  
  
For always in all ways  
Youll stay in my heart  
Always in all ways  
This distance is too far apart  
  
I thought youd always be daddys child  
And suddenly you were grown  
Now that youre on your own  
If ever you feel alone  
  
Ill be there beside you  
For always in all ways  
  
I never thought that this day would come  
When wed have to say goodbye  
But now that your on your own  
Whenever you need a home  
  
Ill be there inside you  
Always in all ways  
Ill be there beside you  
For always in all ways
