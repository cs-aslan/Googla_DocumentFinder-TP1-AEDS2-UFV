No sleep  
Today  
Cant even rest when the suns down  
No time  
Theres not enough  
And nobodys watchin me now  
  
When we were children wed play  
Out in the streets just dipped in fate  
When we were children wed say  
That we dont the meaning of  
Fear fear fear  
Fear fear fear  
We dont know the meaning of  
  
When we were children wed play  
Out in the streets just dipped in fate  
When we were children wed say  
That we dont the meaning of  
Fear fear fear  
Fear fear fear  
We dont know the meaning of  
  
Wish I  
Didnt know the meaning of
