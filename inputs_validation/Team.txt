Wait til youre announced  
Weve not yet lost all our graces  
The hounds will stay in chains  
Look upon your greatness that youll send the call out  
Send the call out  
  
Call all the ladies out theyre in their finery  
A hundred jewels on throats  
A hundred jewels between teeth  
Now bring my boys in their skin in craters like the moon  
The moon we love like a brother while he glows through the room  
Dancin around the lies we tell  
Dancin around big eyes as well  
Even the comatose they dont dance and tell  
  
We live in cities youll never see onscreen  
Not very pretty but we sure know how to run things  
Livin in ruins of a palace within my dreams  
And you know were on each others team  
  
Im kind of over gettin told to throw my hands up in the air  
So there  
  
So all the cups got broke  
Shards beneath our feet  
But it wasnt my fault  
And everyones competing for a love they wont receive  
Cause what this palace wants is release  
  
We live in cities youll never see onscreen  
Not very pretty but we sure know how to run things  
Livin in ruins of a palace within my dreams  
And you know were on each others team  
  
Im kind of over gettin told to throw my hands up in the air  
So there  
Im kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care  
So there  
  
We live in cities youll never see onscreen  
Not very pretty but we sure know how to run things  
Livin in ruins of a palace within my dreams  
And you know were on each others team  
  
Were on each others team  
And you know were on each others team  
Were on each others team  
And you know and you know and you know
