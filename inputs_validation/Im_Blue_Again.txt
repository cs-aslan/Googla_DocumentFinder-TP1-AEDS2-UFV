Im blue again  
My friends all said Id be  
Im blue again  
Because your leavin me  
  
This heart of mine  
So well remembers you  
Although Ive lost your love  
To someone new  
  
The nights are long  
So long my darlin hear me  
I pray that dawn will come  
And somehow youll be near me  
  
Im blue again  
My heart is filled with tears  
Im blue again  
As I think of wasted years  
  
The nights are long  
So long my darlin hear me  
I pray that dawn will come  
And somehow youll be near me  
  
Im blue again  
My heart is filled with tears  
Im blue again  
As I think of wasted years
