I picture us together  
Framed in gold leaf  
On the mantle with the others  
One big happy family  
But that snapshot cant be found  
And I dont trust my memory  
  
Chorus  
But its alright its alright  
For a dream  
  
I imagine we are gathered  
But this time not dressed in black  
Theres laughing and smiling  
Not stabbing in the back  
But its too good to be true  
And too bad I still recall the screams  
  
Chorus  
  
I keep half the picture  
Mostly in my mind  
Mama dressed in white  
Ripped when she held your hand  
Showing no signs of age  
Just slightly frayed along the seam  
  
Chorus  
  
Its alright  
All that I can claim  
Its alright  
And it will have to do  
Its alright  
Better than the pain  
Its alright  
Better than the truth  
Its alright  
Alright for a dream  
Its alright  
Better than fate and the great scheme  
Its alright  
Its alright  
  
For Christmas and for New Year  
I wish and I resolve  
But Im disappointed by myself Jesus and Santa Claus  
I want to believe  
Shes been saved  
And hes be redeemed  
  
And its alright its alright  
For a dream
