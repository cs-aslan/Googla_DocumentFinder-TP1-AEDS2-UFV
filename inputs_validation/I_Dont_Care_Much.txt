I dont care much  
Go or stay  
I dont care very much  
Either way  
Hearts grow hard  
On a windy street  
Lips grow cold  
With the rent to meet me  
So if you kiss me  
If we touch  
Warnings fair  
I dont care very much  
I dont care much  
Go or stay  
I dont care  
Very much  
Either way  
Words sound false  
When your coats too thin  
Feet dont waltz  
When the roof caves in  
So if you kiss me  
If we touch  
Warnings fair  
I dont care  
Very much
