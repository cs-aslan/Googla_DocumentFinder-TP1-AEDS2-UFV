Chorus 1 BIG  
What do ya do when yo bitch is untrue  
You cut that hooker off and find someone new  
I need another bitch another bitch in my life  
  
Verse 1 BIG  
Uhhuh uhh uhh  
I know he dont treat you like I treat you  
Time to explain the game you see through  
Sex is lethal I aint gon lie  
Means to get ya back I aint gon try  
Like this yall my girl sucked anotha nigga dick whyall  
Light skinned with the chrome die six whyall  
Thought they was creepin two trips to VA every third weekend  
While you was sleepin he hit you on the box  
Sixtynine go nonstop  
Shoulda left ya then but my heart said not  
You knew too much the relationship grew too much  
You knew about the crack vials means to be trialed  
Way I hid dough under the bathroom tile  
Waited for a while thought you was my right thing  
Then things got frightening  
Peep the scene sorta like Sam Rothstein  
Guess you Ginger huh go figure  
Never thought you could be a gold digger  
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga  
Asked my man Trigga my ace boom coon  
Told me cut the bitch off fore the shit balloon  
Now Im like Brandy Sittin In My Room  
Pissy drunk listenin to Stylistic tunes  
Or the OJays thinkin bout the old days  
My niggas like fuck that bitch go play  
Baller did she beep you Dont call her  
Guess who I seen that freak bitch Paula  
She was askin bout ya whereabouts  
Heres the digits I know you can wear that out  
Tear that out the frame ya game so tight  
Youll be all fuckin night  
  
Chorus 2 Lil Kim  
What do ya do when your man is untrue  
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new  
I need another man in my life  
  
Verse 2 Lil Kim  
Mmm uhhh uhhh  
Member when you said you would die for me shit  
All of that was just lies to me  
Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me  
Now you cry for me like Jodeci  
Its like that whyall my nigga hit another bitch from the back whyall  
Black nasty and matter fact yall  
Shoulda seen the hoe nigga pack ya shit  
You out the door ohh  
What about the fight in the Mirage  
I seen ya Benz parked outside my sisters garage  
Said it was ya friend Rog bullshit  
I aint gonna keep puttin up wit the bullshit  
And still I never sweat these bitches  
Who be hanged like plaques on the wall and ya pictures  
Scalin fishes my love is concrete  
Stashin ya heat in the passenger seat  
of the Nautica Jeep weve been down for so long  
Still a bitch like me tryin to hold on  
Teary eyed damn a bitch steamin  
Girls steady screamin Kim you need to leave him  
When I testified in court couldnt think straight  
thinkin bout the bitches I fought  
over you nigga half the shit you bought  
And fuck you movin is my last resort  
You see nine outta ten niggaz aint shit  
One outta five niggaz suck a dick  
Ya mad at me too bad she aint as bad as me  
Choulda kept the freak bitch off my canape  
Now you see aint no pussy warm as mine  
Long as mine aint no love as strong as this  
When I sucked ya dick its like smokin a roach  
Uhh I go from first class to coach  
  
Chorus 1 Chorus 2 Chorus 1 Chorus 2
