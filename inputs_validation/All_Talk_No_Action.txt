First time I saw you girl  
I knew that it wouldnt be long  
I tried holding back my feelings  
But you came on so strong  
No one told me about her  
But I know they all knew  
That I know all about the girls  
That do the things you do  
  
Cause youre all talk no action  
Youre all talk no action  
  
Youre playing those games with me baby  
But one of us has got to win  
Someday all the boys are gonna find out  
That you wont even play it with them  
Youre running out of numbers baby  
You wont say no you just say maybe  
One of these days youre gonna get  
Whats coming to you  
  
Cause youre all talk no action  
All talk no action  
Youre all talk no action  
You better stop this fooling around  
Youre all talk no action  
You turn it up to cool me down cool me down cool me down  
  
Sticks and stones will break my bones  
But their names could never hurt me  
Cause I aint afraid of you running away  
If you love me tonight then desert me  
  
Cause youre all talk and no action  
Youre all talk but no action  
Youre all talk but no action  
Youre all talk  
Youre all talk no action  
Youre all talk no action  
All talk no action  
All talk no action
