For even the most trusting soul  
This world can be a scary place  
So much that we cant control  
In every moment that we face  
When a thousand what ifs  
Whisper in our ears  
We remember whos we are  
And watch them disappear  
I wanna live with a fearless heart  
Courage thats coming from trust in God  
Its constantly guiding me though the road may seem dark  
I wanna live wanna live with a fearless heart  
There are worries chasing everyone  
Its evident in times like these  
But I have found the confidence that comes  
From time I spend on my knees  
Theres a truth Im holding onto  
As these days unfold  
Greater is He God is in you  
And hear it in the world  
I wanna live with a fearless heart  
Courage thats coming from trust in God  
Its constantly guiding me though the road may seem dark  
I wanna live wanna live with a fearless heart  
Hes my strength Hes my shelter  
He is with me all the way  
Hes my light and my salvation  
Of whom shall I be afraid of whom shall I be afraid  
I wanna live with a fearless heart  
Courage thats coming from trust in God  
Its constantly guiding me though the road may seem dark yeah  
I wanna live with a fearless heart  
Courage thats coming from trust in God  
Its constantly guiding me though the road is dark  
I wanna live wanna live with a fearless heart  
With a fearless heart with a fearless heart  
With a fearless heart
