Black cat come visit me I dont care what people say  
I saw your hazel eyes sparkling in the moonlight  
  
Black cat one day things will change Im gonna wipe away your bad name  
My friend tells me youre no good and I say hey Im not afraid  
  
Black cat youre beautiful why does everybody run away  
Has anybody told you I care  
Has anybody told you I love you  
  
Black cat come visit me I dont care what people say  
I saw your hazel eyes sparkling in the moonlight  
Black cat things will change Im gonna wipe away your bad name  
Black cat youre beautiful black cat black cat
