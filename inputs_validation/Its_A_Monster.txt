Everybody was born in it  
Sure as hell gonna die in it  
Some people dont give a shit  
Whether or not theyre full of it  
  
Its on my mind most of the time  
Thats when you find we all go blind  
Then it will start to get in our hearts  
Its gone too far thats who we are  
  
Its a monster  
We all have within us  
Its a monster  
Its a monster  
Turns us into sinners  
Its a monster  
  
It started when I played with it  
It turned into a habit  
And after that once youve been bit  
You cant seem to get rid of it  
  
Its on my mind most of the time  
Thats when you find we all go blind  
Then it will start to get in our hearts  
Its gone too far thats who we are  
  
Its a monster  
We all have within us  
Its a monster  
Its a monster  
Turns us into sinners  
Its a monster
