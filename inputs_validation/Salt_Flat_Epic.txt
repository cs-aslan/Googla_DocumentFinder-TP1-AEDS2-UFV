Salt lakes I saved for myself  
I never thought youd leave  
Countries Ive claimed to myself  
I know youll never be yourself again  
But what you were is still in question  
Pacific oceans way too small  
For both of us to swim  
Antarctica will have to thaw  
For us to meet again  
And I respect the all of what is fair and worthy  
And I will never feel this way about another person  
And I will never feel this way again  
I want to make you understand  
Its not the songs and its not the band  
Im still afraid but Im doing the best I can  
Given grace and all the saints  
Youll never be near me  
You got your drummer  
You got your faith  
Ive redefined the laws of friends  
And what wont happen ever again  
And I will never feel this way about another person  
And I will never feel this way again  
I want to make you understand  
Its not the drugs and its definitely not a man  
Im still afraid but Im doing the best I can  
Doing the best I can  
Im doing the best I can  
Thats enough for now  
Thats enough for now  
Thats enough for now  
Thats enough for now  
Now I practice the art of forgetting
