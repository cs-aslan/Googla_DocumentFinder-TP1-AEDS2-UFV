Wednesdays child is a child of woe  
Wednesdays child cries alone I know  
When you smiled just for me you smiled  
For a while I forgot I was Wednesdays child  
  
Fridays child wins at love they say  
In your arms Friday was my day  
Now youre gone well I should have known  
I am Wednesdays child born to be alone  
  
Now youre gone well I should have known  
I am Wednesdays child born to be alone  
  
Wednesdays child born to be alone
