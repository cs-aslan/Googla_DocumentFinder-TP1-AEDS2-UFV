Each day youve got someone new  
A new heart to break  
And leave feeling blue  
  
For youre a handsome guy  
Girls just cant pass you by  
But I can my friend  
Im the exception to the rule  
  
I know you think Im just acting the part  
Of the girl with the cold cold heart  
And it wont take long  
For you to capture me  
With your innocent but meaningful plea  
  
But you wont capture me  
Im the exception to the rule  
  
You tell me  
Darling thats where youre wrong  
That your love for me is oh so strong  
That you will soon very soon  
Make me give in  
  
I know that nine girls out of every ten  
Wants you to be their man  
But there I am again  
That one in ten  
  
So its useless  
For you to try and change me  
Because I wont give in my friend  
  
You could fool all the girls  
With your lies  
About you being so sweet and kind  
  
But oh no not me  
Im the exception to the rule  
Give it up  
  
Im the one you cant fool  
Im the one  
Im the exception to the rule  
Give it up  
  
Im the one you cant fool  
Im the one  
The exception to the rule  
Give it up  
  
Im the one you cant fool  
Im the one  
Im the one you cant fool
