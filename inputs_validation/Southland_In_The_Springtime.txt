Maybe well make Texas by the morning  
Light the bayou with our taillights in the night  
Eight hundread miles to El Paso from the state line  
And we never have the money for the flight  
  
Im in the back seat sleepy from the travel  
Played our hearts out all night long in New Orleans  
Im dirty from the diesel fumes drinking coffee black  
When the first breath of Texas comes in clean  
  
And theres something bout the Southland in the springtime  
Where the waters flow with confidence and reason  
Though I miss her when Im gone it wont ever be too long  
Til Im home again to spend my favorite season  
  
When God made me born a Yankee He was teasin  
Theres no place like home and none more pleasin  
Than the Southland in the springtime  
  
In Georgia nights are softer than a whisper  
Beneath a quilt somebodys mother made by hand  
With the farmland like a tapestry passed down through generations  
And the peach trees stitched across the land  
  
Therell be cider up near Helen off the roadside  
And boiled peanuts in a bag to warm your fingers  
And the smoke from the chimney meets its maker in the sky  
With a song that winter wrote whose melody lingers
