Thats it baby When you got it flaunt it flaunt it  
  
This is the Divine Miss M and Im here to share with you some rare and

smiply believe with all my heart

Go away little girl they used to say  
Hey youre too fat baby you cant play  
Hold on miss thing what you trying to do  
You know youre too wack to be in our school  
  
Too wack too smart too fast too fine  
Too loud too tough too too divine  
I said you dont belong You dont belong  
Too loud too big too much to bear  
Too bold too brash too prone to swear  
I heard that song for much too long  
  
Aint this my sun Aint this my moon  
Aint this my world to be who I choose  
Aint this my song Aint this my movie  
Aint this my world I know I can do it  
  
Im not too short Im not too tall  
Im not too big Im not too small  
Ooh dont lemme start lovin myself  
Ooh dont lemme start lovin myself  
Im not too white Im not too black  
Im not too this Im not too that  
Ooh dont lemme start lovin myself  
Ooh dont lemme start lovin myself

Its time to call it what it is Dont play the naming game  
Become what you were born to be and be it unashamed  
Go away little boy I can hear them say  
Everybody on the block says they think youre gay  
Hold on my friend do you think were blind  
Take a look at yourself Youre not our kind  
  
Too black too white too short too tall  
Too blue too green too red too small  
I said you dont belong You dont belong  
Too black too white too short too tall  
Too blue too green too red too small  
I heard that song for much to long  
  
Aint this my sun Aint this my moon  
Aint this my world to be who I choose  
Aint this my song Aint this my movie  
Aint this my world I know I can do it  
  
People always ask me  
Miss M how did you get so far  
On so little Shut up  
Well I woke up one morning  
Flossed my teeth and decided  
Damn Im fierce You look good  
You can be just like me A goddess Yeah  
Dont just pussy foot around and sit on your assets  
Unleash your ferocity upon an unsuspecting world  
Rise up and repeat after me Im beautiful

Aint this our song Aint this our song  
Aint this our movie Aint this our movie  
Aint this our world to be who we choose  
  
Im not too short Im not too tall  
Im not too big Im not too small  
Ooh dont lemme start lovin myself

Im not too white Im not too black  
Im not too this Im not too that  
Ooh dont lemme start lovin myself
