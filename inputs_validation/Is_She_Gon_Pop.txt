Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Art of seduction  
Hoes jump like Vince Carter backstage like they apart of production  
We talked about her dreams you gotta start off with somethin  
Her momma went to college but yet her father was hustlin  
Found it funny cause now they daughter is stuckin  
A similar predicament Im askin where her nigga went  
She said your guess is good as mine  
Dropped outta school now he run the streets like all the time  
Left me alone with this baby I dont hear from the nigga  
And to keep hundred with you I dont care for the nigga  
Well movin on  
Funny cause I only know a couple of your songs  
But I love when they come on  
Word  
  
Ill take it baby Ill take it  
Why Im starin at you cause Im picturing you naked  
Know whats on your mind embrace it do not fake it  
Tonight is what you make it take it do not waste it  
Take a shot you not wasted look in the blocks with mind play  
Im in a small ass town with a superstar chick  
This is superstar dick  
Girl how could you not taste it  
  
Thats a little egotistic  
My amigos be hocking in Toledo  
Niggas winning off me its all G  
Cause he know bitches cant get the Michael  
So they settling for Tito  
We know yeah nigga we know  
Hot bitch fell in my lap like cappuccino  
Niggas so thirsty it irks me  
You keep on putting bitches over money but that aint my cup of tea though  
Nah nigga the game is to get  
A bunch of paper just to change your fucking neighbors and shit  
I swear if niggas put half  
Of what they put in chasing ass into a craft  
By now youd be famous and rich  
But I get it you rather lay with a bitch  
While you play with her pussy and let her play with your dick  
She thinking she got a first round pick  
She thinking bout all the things she can get  
She thinking you got a range for a whip  
And a fly ass cribbo but its not that simple cause  
All you got is a phone full of bitches and they just like her  
Meanwhile Im stacking paper up my word  
Had more hoes coming than a bus driver  
Got a full grown woman wanna fuck my word wanna ride my nouns  
Let her suck my verbs aye  
  
Ill take it baby Ill take it  
Why Im starin at you cause Im picturing you naked  
Know whats on your mind embrace it do not fake it  
Tonight is what you make it take it do not waste it  
Take a shot you not wasted look in the blocks with mind play  
Im in a small ass town with a superstar chick  
This is superstar dick  
Girl how could you not taste it
