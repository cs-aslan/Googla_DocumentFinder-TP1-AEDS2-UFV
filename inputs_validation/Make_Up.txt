Your face when sleeping is sublime  
And then you open up your eyes  
  
Then comes pancake factor number one  
Eyeliner rose hips and lip gloss such fun  
Youre a slick little girl youre a slick little girl  
Rouge and coloring incense and ice  
Perfume and kisses oh its all so nice  
Youre a slick little girl youre a slick little girl  
  
Now were coming out out of our closets  
Out on the streets yeah were coming out  
  
When youre in bed its so wonderful  
Itd be so nice to fall in love  
When you get dressed I really get my fill  
People say that its impossible  
  
Gowns lovely made out of lace  
And all the things that you do to your face  
Youre a slick little girl youre a slick little girl  
Eyeliner whitener then color the eyes  
Yellow and green oh what a surprise  
Youre a slick little girl oh youre such a slick little girl  
  
Now were coming out out of our closets  
Out on the streets yes were coming out  
Yeah were coming out
