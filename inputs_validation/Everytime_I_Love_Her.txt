Diesel smoke climbin to the clear blue sky I sit here wonderin wanderin why  
I leave her everytime I love her  
Green grass growin by picket fence Lord I just dont make no sense  
But I leave her everytime I love her  
I guess its just to my blood to roam I aint never had no permanent home  
So I leave her everytime I love her  
I guess its just knowin that shell be there  
With her dark brown eyes and her yellow hair  
And I love her Lord knows I love her  
Though my minds dissatisfied just a hoppin that big ole Mack and ride  
And leave her everytime I love her  
I guess its just to my blood to roam I aint never had no permanent home  
So I leave her everytime I love her  
  
One of these days I want to go back  
To that yelllow haired girl and the tumble down shack  
And never leave her all I do is love her  
Well I guess to that Ill be content  
Just to drivin this track and sendin home the rent  
And leave her everytime I love her  
Well I guess its just to my blood to roam I aint never had no permanent home  
So I leave her everytime I love her  
You guess it I really love her
