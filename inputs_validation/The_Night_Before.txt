I ring your bell  
The buzzer opens the door  
As I walk in I only mind the floor  
  
I raise my head and I see  
A shadow on the wall  
Vibrantly  
Reminding your last call  
  
Chorus  
You are lying on the floor  
Trying to remember  
What happened the night before  
  
Step by step  
The sound of breaking glass  
What happened here well I can only guess  
  
You seem asleep  
As I try to put you on the bed  
As I find traces of regret  
  
Chorus  
You are lying on the floor  
Trying to remember  
What happened the night before  
You are you really that sure  
That Im the prince wholl wake you  
  
We cant rewind the movie called our life  
And though Im your hero  
Im not that sure so unsure Ill save  
You are lying on the floor  
Trying to remember  
  
Chorus  
You are lying on the floor  
Trying to remember  
What happened the night before  
You are you really that sure  
That Im the prince wholl wake you
