Mmmm  
  
Hey little girl when you grow up  
Dont make the same mistakes I did  
Learn to say no Ive had enough  
Then nothing and no one can harm you  
  
Follow your heart  
And youll be fine  
Follow your dreams  
And take all of the time that you need  
  
Little girl dont you look back  
Dont let your memories haunt you  
Learn to be strong  
All on your own  
Make sure you get what you wanted  
  
Follow your heart  
And youll be fine  
Follow your dreams  
And take all of the time that you need  
  
Little queen wearing your crown  
Leave all your sadness behind you  
Dont waste your time suffering fools  
One day prince charming will find you  
  
Mmmm  
Mmmm  
Mmmm  
Mmmm
