I see a house a house of stone  
A lonely house cos now youre gone  
Seven rooms thats all it is seven rooms of gloom  
I live with emptiness without your tenderness  
  
You took the dream I had for us and turned that dream into dust  
I watch a phone that never rings I watch a door that never rings  
I need you back into my life and turn this darkness into light  
Im all alone in this house turn this house into a home  
  
I need your touch to comfort me your tender tender arms that once held me  
Without your love your love inside  
This house is just a place to run and hide  
Seven rooms thats all it is seven rooms of gloom  
I live with emptiness without your tenderness  
  
Dont make me live from day to day watching a clock that ticks away  
Another day another way another reason for me to say  
I need you here here with me I need you darlin desperately  
Im all alone all alone in this house thats not a home  
  
I miss your love I once have known I miss your kiss that was my very very own  
Empty silence surrounds me lonely walls they stare  
Seven rooms thats all it is seven rooms of gloom  
I live with emptiness without your tenderness  
  
And all the windows are painted black Ill wait right here til you get back  
I keep waitin and waitin til your face again I see  
  
I want you back now I keep waitin and waitin I want you back now  
I want you back now I keep waitin and waitin cmon back now  
I keep waitin and waitin and waitin waitin waitin waitin  
I want you back now Cmon back now
