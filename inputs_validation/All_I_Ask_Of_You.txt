No more talk of darkness  
Forget these wideeyed fears  
Im here nothing can harm you  
My words will warm and calm you  
  
Let me be your freedom  
Let daylight dry your tears  
Im here with you beside you  
To guard you and to guide you  
  
Say youll love me every waking moment  
Turn my head with talk of summer time  
Say you need me with you now and always  
Promise me that all you say is true  
Thats all I ask of you  
  
Let me be your shelter  
Let me be your light  
Youre safe no one will find you  
Your fears are far behind you  
  
All I want is freedom  
A world with no more night  
And you always beside me  
To hold me and to hide me  
  
Then say youll share with me one love one lifetime  
Let me lead you from your solitude  
Say you need me with you here beside you  
Anywhere you go let me go too  
Christine thats all I ask of you  
  
Say youll share with me one love one lifetime  
Say the word and I will follow you  
  
Share each day with me each night each morning  
  
Say you love me  
  
You know I do  
  
Love me thats all I ask of you  
  
Anywhere you go let me go too  
Love me thats all I ask of you  
  
I gave you my music made your song take wing  
And now how youve repaid me denied me and betrayed me  
He was bound to love you when he heard you sing  
Christine Christine  
  
Say youll share with me one love one lifetime  
Say the word and I will follow you  
Share each day with me each night each morning  
  
You will curse the day you did not do  
All that the Phantom asked of you
