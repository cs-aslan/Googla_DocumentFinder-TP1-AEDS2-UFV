Its one in the mornin  
You know what time it is  
Its one in the mornin  
Its one in the mornin  
You gonna have come out your clothes on this one  
Its one in the mornin  
  
Yeah Im still at it the microphone addict  
You get your dome splattered cause homey will not have it  
Your ashes get scattered across the Atlantic  
For actin like you a teenage chick with her bra padded  
You might laugh at it but if you do the knowledge  
Its really a tad tragic how they runnin through they cabbage  
You know my track record L battle like a savage  
I think and grow rich that gives me the advantage  
Uncle LL I got product for sale  
So I can bail Al Sharpton out of jail  
Somebody gotta do it somebody in the black community  
Gotta get this money while yall march for unity  
So march on Ima get my Bentley park on  
Then get my dogs a platform to bark on  
The realest brother you Nicole Kidman one of The Others  
Children shiverin under the covers  
The man in black the tilted Fedora hat  
Im bringin it raw you never want your money back  
Im focused baby livin like a quarterback  
Playin in the wishbone L keep options black  
Systematically burn you like calories  
Watch your mouth go earn your lil salary  
Im a classic like Nike Airs and Wallabees  
You could catch it like the flu homey follow me  
  
Chorus  
Its one in the mornin flash the dough  
Its one in the mornin crack the Mo  
Its one in the mornin get on the flo  
Its one in the mornin who want to go  
  
Thats right Sleeping Beauty wake up see the light  
That Tylenol PM got you caught for your BM  
Everybody can see Im the king of rippin coliseums  
Cmon youse a male groupie beggin for per diem  
A fruitcake laid out in the masoleum  
Im the richest man in Babylon nobody could see him  
Moneys my slave it do what I say  
It cry for me like Denzel in Glory  
But I broke the cycle no more poverty  
I wonder if you hatin on the low probably  
But cats know Im real I keep em on they heels  
Damn Look at my body coulda been a Navy Seal  
But you lack the discipline to do what I do  
Reinvention Im in the 11th dimension  
Im a value stock pop get it while its hot  
Cause once I blow Ima split and thats it  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Aye yo E its one oclock  
Time to get one and bounce baby  
Its time to get one and bounce  
You know what time it is  
  
Your honor last week he punched me in my face  
I want twenty million you know he liftin weights  
Last week me and the President was takin flicks  
Last week my video dropped and you was sick  
Last week I copped my lil shorty some kicks  
That cost 29 hundred homey you dont want it  
My ears stay flooded like your man stay blunted  
My American Express is Black Im at the Sumit  
The Benjamin Grier of Def Jam yall know  
My potfolio was sicker than polio  
For real God is good he took me out the hood  
Got me livin in a mansion like a big boy should  
And I never do Cribs I aint gonna have yall fruitcakes  
Knowin how I live bed extra big  
You sit around run your mouth potbelly on the couch  
Claimin you hot but honey what you wove out  
When she alone pump L I make her bounce  
You on the corner riskin your life to sell a ounce  
Wish you was Pablo lay in the carbo  
With a chick named Margo who flew from Chicago  
But no in real life cats catch it  
Its not what you expected huh Life kinda hectic huh  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Yeah yeah  
Its the definition  
Definition  
Definition potna eleven in a row
