I could walk this fine line between elation and success  
But we all know which way Im going  
So strike the stake between my chest  
Well You have to prove yourself  
Youll have to prove it to me  
  
So now youre waiting up for him  
Youre wasting time every time  
  
I cant do it by myself  
  
I cant wake up to these reminders of who I am  
A failure at everything  
18 going on extinct  
I know my place  
Its nowhere you should roam
