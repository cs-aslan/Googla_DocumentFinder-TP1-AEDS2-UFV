Well goodbye tubs and clothes lines goodbye pots and pans  
Im a gonna take a greyhound bus as further as I can  
I aint a gonna wash no windows and I aint a gonna scrub no floors  
And when you realize Im gone Im a gonna hear you roar  
And youll say hey Loretta I love you more than my Irish Setter  
Hey Loretta dont leave me alone  
Hey Loretta I swear Im a gonna treat you better  
Buy you brand new overalls if youll only come back home  
I work my fingers to the bone and we dont hardly speak  
And all I ever get is just a little kiss about once a week  
So you can feed the chickens and you can milk the cow  
This a womans liberation honey is a gonna start right now  
And youll say hey Loretta  
Ill dress up like a movie star and pretty up my hair  
And no one here is a gonna know what Ill be doing there  
Ill be swinging from a chandelier and bouncin off the walls  
Instead of lovin just one man Im a gonna love em all  
And youll say hey Loretta
