Roamer roamer  
Hello Im coming at your town again  
Hows about a night hows about a flight supernova  
I know Ive been kinda hot and cold  
But you never go away no matter what I say  
In the mornings  
  
Chorus  
My need is running low  
Ive been moving everywhere  
Spreading out my wings trying everything  
But thats over cause when Im on my own  
Waking up with someone new  
And now I feel the same Im mixing up their name  
Its like a roamer  
  
Goodbye Im going on the road again  
But Im bringing you along  
In each and every song that we cover  
And I I always want to see your face  
Cause looking in your eyes is where I see my life  
When Im older  
  
Chorus  
  
Like a roamer like a roamer  
Mississippi Tennessee  
California  Lexico like a roamer  
Russia San Francisco bay to the UK  
Round the world in 80 days  
Like a roamer  
  
When I go away dont want to go away  
Dont want to go away dont want to go away  
Dont want to go away dont want to go away  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Mississippi Tennessee  
California Lexico like a roamer  
Russia Francisco bay to the UK  
Round the world in 80 days  
Like a roamer
