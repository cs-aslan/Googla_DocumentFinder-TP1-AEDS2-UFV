I will never forget the time we spent together  
And let the whole wide world go by  
I cant forget the dreams that we made come true  
As the clouds in the sky rolled on  
  
And I cant forget the day we met  
Oh our love came so easy  
Its so hard for me to say  
That we can never go back to yesterday  
  
You must know that it dont happen everyday  
Now I see that I let love slip through my fingers  
Someone said that love is just a beautiful dream  
And let it drift away  
  
Oh another lonely teardrop  
Just one more careless love  
Its so hard for me to say  
That we can never go back to yesterday  
  
Baby lets fall in love again  
Baby lets fall in love  
Baby lets fall in love again  
And maybe we can go back to yesterday
