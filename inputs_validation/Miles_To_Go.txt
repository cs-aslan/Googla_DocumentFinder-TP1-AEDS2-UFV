Its feelin longer now than it ever has before  
Another memory is another slammin door  
Its gettin too dark now to see  
  
Every photograph is another lesson learned  
Every sleepless night is another page Ive turned  
I wake up to fallin dreams  
  
And the petals start to fade by the picket fences  
Just another shade of miles and miles to go  
  
If I had a chance I mustve missed it long ago  
If I could run away I wouldnt have to let you go  
This angels bound to stray  
  
Like an hourglass Im a soul to sinkin sand  
You try to hold my heart and I will slip right through your hands  
Time just blows away  
  
And the petals start to fade by the picket fences  
Just another shade of miles and miles to go  
And the tears forever flow  
  
And the petals start to fade by the picket fences  
Just another shade of miles and miles to go  
And this angels bound to stray  
Its another shade of miles and miles to go
