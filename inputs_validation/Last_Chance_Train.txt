October leaves are falling so am I  
A harvest moon is calling me and I know why  
The traffics like a symphony in blue  
  
In the autumn air I smell your sweet perfume  
I miss you sitting cross legged in this empty room  
Yesterdays are eating me alive  
  
Im your angel baby  
Ive got broken wings  
I cant walk I cant run I cant drop  
Until youre next to me so the only thing  
  
You gotta meet me tonight  
Im on a last chance train  
Leave a flower the station  
I know my destination  
Love bring me home again  
  
You try to reach me but Ive sailed away  
You tried to read me but my words got in the way  
The musics over but the dance has just begun  
  
I wish that I could just get back to Baltimore  
You know Id scratch Id claw Id scream  
Till Im raw just to fall down at your door  
  
You gotta meet me tonight  
Im on a last chance train  
Leave a flower at the station  
I know my destination  
Love bring me home again  
  
Let the scarecrows laugh coming down the tracks  
At the broken hearts that dont come back  
Cause the train has left the station with my pain  
Let them forget my name oh  
  
Im on a last chance train  
  
Sitting here I smoke my nineteenth cigarette  
Now all thats left are ashes butts and my regrets  
Its your taste that I just cant forget  
  
You gotta meet me tonight  
Im on a last chance train  
  
Let the scarecrows laugh coming down the tracks  
At the broken hearts that dont come back  
Well be laughing at them crying in the rain  
Its you and I again oh  
  
You gotta meet me tonight  
Im on a last chance train  
Leave a flower at the station  
I know my destination  
Love bring me home again  
  
Im on a last chance train  
Its gonna bring me home to you  
Oh the last chance train  
Coming through my babe  
This time Im coming through  
Coming through
