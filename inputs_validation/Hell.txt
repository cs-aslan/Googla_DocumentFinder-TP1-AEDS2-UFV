This state Im in  
A place Ive never been  
Im dying to meet you here  
  
Come break this skin  
Ill let you sink right in  
And show you everything  
See you in hell  
See you in hell  
  
Well gather around the fire  
And I will lead the choir  
Sing farewell  
See you in hell  
  
Come break my spell  
Well down the wishing well  
Well find some time to kill  
  
Ill be right there  
The buzz inside your head  
The whole electric chair  
See you in hell  
  
Well gather round the fire  
And I dont need the choir  
Sing farewell  
See you in hell
