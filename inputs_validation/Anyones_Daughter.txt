I stood under your bedroom window  
Throwing up a brick  
No one came I threw one more  
That really did the trick  
Your daddy came and banged my head  
He said what kind of man  
Is this thats hanging round my girl  
And threw me in the can  
Youre a farmers daughter  
Youre a farmers daughter  
Why do I always get  
The kinda girl I didnt oughta get  
I wont get no more eggs and water  
Now Ive laid the farmers daughter  
  
Imagine I was a fullgrown man  
And I could talk just right  
Could I come and see you here  
And do this every night  
Wham The door comes crashing down  
Your daddys face all pale  
Says come with me you hairy bum  
Ill put you in my jail  
Youre a judges daughter  
Youre a judges daughter  
Why do I always get  
The kinda girl I didnt oughta get  
Now Im getting jail and torture  
Cause I made the judges daughter  
  
It seems theyre screaming law and order  
When I go with anyones daughter  
  
Woman I should like some peace  
And daddy hold your tongue  
I think youre gonna die of fright  
When I tell you what Ive done  
I can hear your tales and lies  
You say Im dumb and scraggy  
But man this dumb and scraggy is  
Your daughters babys daddy  
Shes a lucky daughter  
Such a lucky daughter  
Why did I always get  
The kinda girl I didnt want to get  
Now Ive got what I always fought for  
Cause Ive married a rich mans daughter
