Are we lovers  
Or only just friends  
Come tomorrow  
Will I be lonely again  
When you see me  
Is it love in your eyes  
Whats your feeling  
Deep down inside  
  
Do you think about me think about me  
When Im far away  
Do you dream about me dream about me  
Can I find a way  
To make you want me make you want me  
The way that I want you  
Cause I think I love you think I love you  
Could you love me too  
  
Chrous  
Take me to your heart  
Never let me go  
If you knew what Im feeling  
You would not say no  
Take me to your heart  
Never let me go  
For your love for your love  
Is all I need to know  
  
Can you tell me  
When you look at me  
If you need me  
In all honesty  
Because Im certain  
As sure as can be  
Id make you happy  
Eternally  
  
Cause I think about you think about you  
When youre far away  
And I dream about you dream about you  
Night and day  
Can I make you want me make you want me  
The way that I want you  
Cause I think I love you think I love you  
Could you love me too  
  
Chorus x2  
Take me to your heart  
Never let me go  
If you knew what Im feeling  
You would not say no  
Take me to your heart  
Never let me go  
For your love for your love  
Is all I need to know  
  
Cause I think about you think about you  
When youre far away  
And I dream about you dream about you  
Night and day  
Can I make you want me make you want me  
The way that I want you  
Cause I think I love you think I love you  
Could you love me too  
  
Chorus x3  
Take me to your heart  
Never let me go  
If you knew what Im feeling  
You would not say no  
Take me to your heart  
Never let me go  
For your love for your love  
Is all I need to know
