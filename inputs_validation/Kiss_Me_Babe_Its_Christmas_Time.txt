Well its Christmas time and Im warm inside  
Despite the bitter cold  
Cause youre here with me and I guarantee  
My heart is yours to hold  
So we smile below this mistletoe as if we need a hint  
And the falling snow well I bet it knows  
How love can pull you in  
  
Prechorus  
Little lights flash in your eyes  
Glowing by the fireside  
Leave the presents on the floor  
Cause youre the one Im waiting for  
Oh let me lead the way this Holiday  
  
Chorus  
Lets fly around the world tonight oh yeah  
Kiss me babe its Christmas time  
I love the way you hold me tight oh yeah  
Kiss me babe its Christmas time  
Little lights flash in your eyes  
Kiss me babe its Christmas time  
Cant fight the way I feel inside  
Kiss me babe its Christmas time  
Oh let me lead the way this Holiday  
  
Well its Christmas time and Im warm inside  
Despite the bitter cold  
And its crystal clear that this Christmas cheer  
Is healthy for the soul  
  
Prechorus  
Little lights flash in your eyes  
Glowing by the fireside  
Leave the presents on the floor  
Cause youre the one Im waiting for  
Oh let me lead the way this Holiday  
  
Chorus  
Lets fly around the world tonight oh yeah  
Kiss me babe its Christmas time  
I love the way you hold me tight oh yeah  
Kiss me babe its Christmas time  
Little lights flash in your eyes  
Kiss me babe its Christmas time  
Cant fight the way I feel inside  
Kiss me babe its Christmas time  
Oh let me lead the way this Holiday  
  
Lets fly around the word tonight oh yeah  
Kiss me babe its Christmas time  
I love the way you hold me tight oh yeah  
Kiss me babe its Christmas time
