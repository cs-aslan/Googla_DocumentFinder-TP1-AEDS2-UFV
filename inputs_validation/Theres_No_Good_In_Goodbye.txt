Tears fall times called  
Sunsets in your heart  
The games lost the spinning world stops  
  
You say the course has been run  
Now the end has now come  
Please dont mean its over cause theres  
  
No good in goodbye  
Lets dry our tears and give this love  
Just one more try  
  
Theres so much history  
Dont throw it away  
Cause tomorrows a brand new day  
Stay with me  
  
Dreams die the crow will fly  
A kiss cant last all night  
The moon sinks and for my last wish  
You and I share this heart  
Please dont mean its over cause theres  
  
No good in goodbye  
Lets dry our tears and give this love  
Just one more try  
  
Theres so much history  
Dont throw it away  
Cause tomorrows a brand new day  
  
Your heart Incomprehensible  
Please dont take all the stars from the skies and  
  
No good in goodbye  
Lets dry our tears and give this love  
Just one more try  
  
Theres so much history  
Dont throw it away  
Cause tomorrows a brand new day  
  
And its lived by destiny  
Dont throw it away  
Find a brand new day  
  
Well get out if we try  
Cause theres no good in goodbye
