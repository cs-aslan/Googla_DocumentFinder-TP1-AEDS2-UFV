Just dig that scenery floating by  
Were now approaching Newport Rhode I  
Weve been for years In Variety  
But Cholly Knickerbocker now were going to be  
  
In High High So  
High Soci  
High Society  
  
I want to play for my former pal  
He runs the local jazz festival  
His name is Dexter and hes good news  
But sumping kind of tells me that hes nursing the blues  
  
In High High So  
High Soci  
High Society  
  
Hes got the blues cause his wife alas  
Thought writing songs was beneath his class  
But writing songs hed not stop of course  
And so she flew to Vegas for a quickie divorce  
  
In High High So  
High Soci  
High Society  
  
To make him sadder his former wife  
begins tomorrow a brandnew life  
She started lately a new affair  
And now the silly chick is gonna marry a square  
  
In High So  
High Soci  
High Society  
  
But Brother Dexter just trust your Satch  
To stop that wedding and kill that match  
Ill toot my trumpet to start the fun  
And play in such a way that shell come back to you son  
  
In High High So  
High Soci  
High Society
