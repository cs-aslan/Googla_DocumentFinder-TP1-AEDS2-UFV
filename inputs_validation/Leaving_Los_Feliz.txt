Verse 1  
Im on the guests list down the Pollsberry Grand  
That hipster doorman he dont know who I am  
When started and  proof I belong so I pass  
Some bells and bees are like grinding bombs on the walls  
Some never learn to cut the lock from the stores  
Floras the border between paradise  
I fight on  
  
Chorus  
Im leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
Im all outta sisters  
Im leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
Im leaving Los Feliz  
  
Verse 2  
I close the rumors that are trapped in the past  
My server jeans are more like Im outta pants  
But I dont wanna go just yet so I suppose I should dance  
The music vibes are looking at you in dread  
Like get aburning and can never get sad  
And I shoulda pretend that it never will end inside my head  
  
Chorus  
Im leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
Im all outta sisters  
Im leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
Im leaving Los Feliz  
  
Bridge  
Im young enough to know Im too young to quit  
Im old enough to wanna get over it  
But yearning is timeless and mine is as deep as the pill  
  
Chorus  
Im leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
Im all outta sisters  
Im leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
Im leaving Los Feliz
