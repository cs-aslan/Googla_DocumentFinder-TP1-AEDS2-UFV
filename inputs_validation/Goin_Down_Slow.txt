Well Its a quarter a two  
and looking at you  
and going down going down slow  
Well Its a quarter a two  
and looking at you  
and going down going down slow  
  
TV went off about one we have only begun  
I know that the Wednesday may come  
but I have no intention of going home  
  
Well Its a quarter a three  
digging on me  
and going down going down slow  
  
Could stay here all night  
they claim your outta sight  
please get up and turn out the light  
There aint nothing better than the middle of the night  
  
And Its a quarter a four  
begging for more  
and going down going down slow  
going down going down slow  
going down going down slow  
going down going down slow
