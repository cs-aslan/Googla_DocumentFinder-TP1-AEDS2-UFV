No need to feel ashamed  
Theres nothing to be gained  
When your dreams are in the past  
  
Like stars we crush and burn  
Only to return  
Life goes by so fast  
  
So who is left to play  
Nothings quite the same  
We cant live in the past  
  
Im burning inside as the sun  
And I only just begun  
Love it fades so fast  
  
Sometimes I forget all I will regret  
When I leave this world behind  
And sometimes Im not sure  
What Im fighting for  
It happens all the time  
  
I know Ive had enough maybe far too much  
Its easy to be kind  
And when its just me and you  
I know what I have to do  
I know I can leave this world behind  
  
No need to feel ashamed  
When theres nothing to be gained  
When your dreams are in the past  
Like stars we crush and burn  
Only to return  
These lines are change so fast  
  
Sometimes I forget all I will regret  
When I leave this world behind  
And sometimes Im not sure  
What Im fighting for  
It happens all the time  
It happens all the time  
It happens all the time
