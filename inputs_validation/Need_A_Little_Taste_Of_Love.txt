Hey Mister walkin with the blues  
Hey Mister payin heavy dues  
Havin troubles and it aint so hard to find  
When youre ridin double and youre running out of time  
  
No need to feel that you lack the spirit  
Within the body but its in the soul  
If you wanna be loved then let somebody hear it  
Might as well face the facts no need to be holdin back  
Need a little taste of love  
  
Hey Mister tell me how long has it been  
Hey sister so how could you pretend  
Why keep the sorrow where it dont belong  
Well come tomorrow oh help me sing the song  
  
No need to feel that you lack the spirit  
Within the body but its in the soul  
If you wanna be loved then let somebody hear it  
Might as well face the facts no need to be holdin back  
Need a little taste of love  
  
Need a little taste of love
