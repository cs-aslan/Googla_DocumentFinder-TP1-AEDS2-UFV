Oh Lord I got eggs on my plate  
I got em Damn right  
I got four walls I live here  
Hey I live here  
Now this big Jewman uptown  
He told me one day  
He said boy  
  
You look at that house On the hill  
That cost a hundred thousand dollars  
You could be up there  
You know what  
Ill put you on the hit parade  
Everybody will know your name  
Iggy  
  
But man Solomon  
Who does my name belong to then  
What have I got Four walls  
What have I got Four walls  
I thank you Lord  
I thank you Lord above this orange carpet  
And the ceiling above it  
Who left Murph the Surf On my ceiling  
Iggy  
  
Now here we go boys  
Four walls Four walls  
Here I go  
  
Im looking for love again  
Im looking for love  
Im running from friend to friend  
Im looking for love in the wine  
Im looking for love  
In anybody I can find  
  
Thank you God  
For these four walls I love  
But are they secure  
Heh God Are you above  
Then tell me who let that fucking door half open  
Oh Lord I got something  
Ill tell you what I got boys I got this  
Four walls Three walls  
Two walls Four walls  
But they cant talk Four walls  
But they cant talk Four walls  
But they cant talk Four walls  
  
But if they could talk What would they say  
Theyd say Nash the slash  
Why did you leave your sticker on my  
Fortytwo dollar and fifty cent suite  
In James Deans head bed
