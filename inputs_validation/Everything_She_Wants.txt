Uh huh huh  
Oh yeah  
Work work  
  
Somebody told me  
Boy everything she wants is everything she sees  
I guess I must have loved you  
Cause I said you were the perfect girl for me  
Maybe  
But now were six months older  
And everything you want and everything you see  
Is out of reach not good enough  
I dont know what the hell you want from me but boy  
  
Uh huh huh  
Oh oh  
Uh huh huh  
Doo doo doo  
La la la la  
  
Somebody tell me  
Wont you tell me  
Why I work so hard for you  
All to give you money  
All to give you money  
  
Some people work for a living  
Some people work for fun  
Girl I just work for you  
They told me marriage was a give and take  
Well show me you can take youve got some giving to do  
And now you tell me that youre having my baby  
Ill tell you that Im happy if you want me to  
One step further and my back will break  
If my best isnt good enough  
Than how can it be good enough for two  
I cant work any harder than I do  
  
Somebody tell me  
Wont you tell me  
Why I work so hard for you  
All to give you money  
All to give you money  
  
Oh  
Why do I do the things I do  
Id tell you if I knew  
My God  
I dont even think that I love you  
Wont you tell me  
Tell me tell me tell me  
  
How could you settle for a boy like me  
When all I could see was the end of the week  
All the things we sign  
And the things we buy  
Aint gonna keep us together  
Its just a matter of time  
  
My situation  
Never changes  
Walking in that manner through that door  
Like a stranger  
But the wages  
I give you all you say you want is love  
  
And all I can see is the end of the week  
All the things we sign  
And the things we buy  
Aint gonna keep us together  
Girl its just a matter of time
