How can I help it if Im not neat  
If there were creeps before you  
How can I help you if I am weak  
If I dont know how to help me  
But I love you  
I love you  
  
imperfect x2  
Imperfectly I love you  
Imperfect x2  
Imperfectly  
  
how can I help it if Im high strung  
If I was born with a sharp tongue  
Will you marry me if I stay sweet  
If I am the one with the cold feet  
But I love you I love you  
  
imperfect x2  
Imperfectly I love you  
Imperfect x2  
Imperfectly I love you  
Imperfect x2  
Imperfectly yeah yeah yeah x8
