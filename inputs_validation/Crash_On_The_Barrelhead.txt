Youre gonna crash on the barrelhead son  
Youll regret the things that you done  
One of these days youre gonna rue  
All the messed up things you do  
Youre gonna die the way you live  
And the way you drink youre like a river  
Bound for falls and not much fun  
Youre gonna crash on the barrelhead son  
Youre gonna wake up in your shoes  
No one you love watching you  
Youll hate youre face when the morning shines  
On the mirror frame and your guilty mind go  
Youre gonna crash on the barrelhead son  
And do the walls know what you done  
And do they listen in on you  
Do the walls know what you do  
Youre gonna wake up in your shoes  
No one you love watching you  
Youll hate youre face when the morning shines  
On the mirror frame and your guilty mind  
On the mirror frame and your guilty mind  
On the mirror frame and your guilty mind
