For a little peace in any season  
Id give up anything but your love  
I dont want to trade tryin to be happy  
Thats only playin anyway  
But if I dream about it it makes me wonder  
For every good thing must you get bad  
But I wont worry and if Im living on borrowed time  
Im gonna keep on the way Im going  
For every crime theres retribution  
And every vally has a mountainside  
No I dont like to trade just to be happy  
That kind of deal wont turn out right  
See it aint good to stare inside yourself too long  
For every true thing therees one more lie  
But I wont worry cause if Im living on borrowed time  
Ill just try to keep on the way Im going
