Donna on my mind when I get up in the morning  
Donna on my mind the whole day through  
Love cant come so quick and real without any warning  
Wonder if shes thinking of me too  
  
Once I thought that no one girl could ever hold me  
Even thought this thing called love was just fantasy  
Now I wont be satisfied until shes mine  
Till then Ill just have Donna on my mind  
  
Once I thought that no one girl could ever hold me  
Even thought this thing called love was just fantasy  
Now I wont be satisfied until shes mine  
Till then Ill just have Donna on my mind
