Black Jack Davey come ariden on back  
Awhistlin loud and merry  
Made the woods around him ring  
And he charmed the heart of a lady  
Charmed the heart of a lady  
  
How old are you my pretty little miss  
How old are you my honey  
She answered to him with a lovin smile  
Ill be sixteen come Sunday  
Be sixteen come Sunday  
  
Come and go with me my pretty little miss  
Come and go with me my honey  
Take you where the grass grows green  
You never will want for money  
You never will want for money  
  
Pull off pull off them highheeled shoes  
All made of Spanish leather  
Get behind me on my horse  
And well ride off together  
Well both go off together  
  
Well she pulled off them highheeled shoes  
Made of Spanish leather  
Got behind him on his horse  
And they rode off together  
They rode off together  
  
At night the boss came home  
Inquiring about this lady  
The servant spoke before she thought  
Shes been with Black Jack Dave  
Rode off with Black Jack Davey  
  
Well saddle for me my coal black stud  
Hes speedier than the gray  
I rode all day and Ill ride all night  
And Ill overtake my lady  
Ill bring back my lady  
  
Well he rode all night till the broad daylight  
Till he came to a river ragin  
And there he spied his darlin bride  
In the arms of Black Jack Davey  
Wrapped up with Black Jack Davey  
  
Pull off pull off them long blue gloves  
All made of the finest leather  
Give to me your lilywhite hand  
And well both go home together  
Well both go home together  
  
Well she pulled off them long blue gloves  
All made of the finest leather  
Gave to him her lilywhite hand  
And said goodbye forever  
Bid farewell forever  
  
Would you forsake your house and home  
Would you forsake your baby  
Would you forsake your husband too  
To go with Black Jack Davey  
Rode off with Black Jack Davey  
  
Well Ill forsake my house and home  
And Ill forsake my baby  
Ill forsake my husband too  
For the love of Black Jack Davey  
Ride off with Black Jack Davey  
  
Last night I slept in a feather bed  
Between my husband and baby  
Tonight I lay on the river banks  
In the arms of Black Jack Davey  
Love my Black Jack Davey
