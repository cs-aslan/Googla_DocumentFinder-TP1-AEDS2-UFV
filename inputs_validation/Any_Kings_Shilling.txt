Youre a fine one oh yes you are  
Youre a fine one just like me  
And were friends now oh wouldnt you say  
Weve been friends now oh havent we  
Stay at home tonight if you know whats good for you  
I cant say more it would be telling  
For if you dont what will become of you  
Just isnt worth any kings shilling  
  
I will answer when they make that call pull upon this ragged uniform  
Up til now I know its been your trade  
Spit and polish the potato parade  
Stay at home tonight if you know whats good for you  
I cant say more it would be telling  
For if you dont what will become of you  
Just isnt worth any kings shilling  
  
Please dont put your silly head in that pretty soldiers hat  
Youve done your duty thats enough of that  
  
I dont know if what Im doing is right  
I dont know if you should be forgiving  
But for me it seems it means my life  
While for you it could just be a living  
Stay at home tonight if you know whats good for you  
I cant say more it would be telling  
For if you dont what will become of you  
Just isnt worth any kings shilling  
  
Please dont put your silly head in that British soldiers hat  
Youve done your duty thats enough of that  
  
Youre a fine one oh yes you are  
Youre a fine one just like me
