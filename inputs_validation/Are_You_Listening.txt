I was hungry you feed me  
Naked you clothed me  
They will know us by our love  
  
Cant imagine how it felt as layed there  
Through the dark through the heat through the cold  
With your friend by your side held his hand and watched him die  
And you cried as you prayed for his soul  
  
I cant imagine how it felt as you stood there  
Through the winds that would just not go away um huh  
  
Kiss my wife tell my son my work on earth is done  
Youre the one that can still hear them say ooh  
  
Is there anybody out there listening  
And does anybody know my name  
No my friend we were not there  
But were here and we care  
And yes we feel your pain ooh yes  
And yes we feel your pain  
  
I cant imagine how you felt as you sat there  
Trying to hide the fear upond your face  
  
As the earth begins to cry and you ask the preacher why  
Tonight we can hear the children say hear them say  
  
Is there anybody out there listening  
And does anybody know my name anybody  
No my friend we were not there

And yes we feel your pain ooh
