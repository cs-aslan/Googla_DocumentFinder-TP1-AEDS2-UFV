Its just the way that I feel about tomorrow  
Ill be sad and alone all the time  
Its just the way that you said you dont love me anymore then Goodbye  
I cant believe what youre saying  
You dont love me anymore Goodbye  
  
Just the way that I feel about tomorrow  
Knowing you wont be there by my side  
I wish that I could say to you well cant we just be good friends  
Would you leave the door open let me walk in again  
  
Thats the way I been thinking bout tomorrow  
I only know that friends cant be lovers again
