And you stare at me  
In your Jesus Christ pose  
Arms held out  
Like youve been carrying a load  
And you swear to me  
You dont want to be my slave  
  
But youre staring at me  
Like I need to be saved  
In your Jesus Christ pose  
Arms held out  
In your Jesus Christ pose  
Thorns and shroud  
Like its the coming of the Lord  
And I swear to you  
That I would never feed you pain  
  
But your staring at me  
Like Im driving the nails  
In your Jesus Christ pose  
And you stare at me  
In your Jesus Christ pose  
Arms held out like its  
The coming of the Lord  
  
And would it pay you more to walk on water  
Then to wear a crown of thorns  
It wouldnt pain me more to bury you rich  
Then to bury you poor  
In your Jesus Christ pose
