Ive always heard people say it  
But I guess I never fully understood it  
I thought that they meant youd be easy to forget  
But its drivin me crazy  
  
Chorus  
Out of sight out of mind  
You opened my eyes and now I can see  
What you mean to me I was so blind  
Out of sight out of mind  
  
You know it hurt when you left me  
But I thought life would go on without you  
That was easier said cant get you outta my head  
I dont know if Ill make it  
  
Chorus  
  
I was so blind  
Out of sight out of mind
