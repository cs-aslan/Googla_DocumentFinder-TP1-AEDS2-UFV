In the land of make believe  
Youre mine tonight  
Although you are far away  
In the land of make believe  
Im holding you tight  
  
The silver moon is shining above  
And theres love in your eyes  
And Im kissing you  
Like I used to do  
Yesterday in paradise  
  
Ive been living in the land of make believe  
Since youve been gone  
I need you so much  
That without your love  
I must deceive myself  
To go on  
  
Your loving hand caresses my face  
We embrace tenderly  
Never will we part  
Deep down in my heart  
You are always here with me  
You are always here with me  
In the land of make believe  
In the land of make believe  
In the land of make believe  
  
Your loving hand caresses my face  
We embrace tenderly  
Never will we part  
Deep down in my heart  
You are always here with me  
You are always here with me  
In the land of make believe  
In the land of make believe  
In the land of make believe  
In the land of make believe
