Im on the fire but what can I do  
Im singing in the choir but Im lookin at you  
Ill be outside pick me up after school baby blue baby blue  
  
Pour me up a bit of that liquid courage  
Lookin so good like an axle rose  
Cuttin school listenin to the techno music  
Will we ever do right God knows  
Me and Claudeen at the Seven Eleven  
Smokin in the back in our mini skirts  
Take us back to class so we look like heaven  
You say Im so fine that it hurts  
  
Im on the fire but what can I do  
Im singing in the choir but Im lookin at you  
Ill be outside pick me up after school  
In your thunder black baby blue  
Thunder black baby blue  
Baby blue  
  
Baby if you want to join our entourage  
Paint your face on it here we go  
Letting on keepin on so dangerous  
Keeping it cool yeah god knows  
Riding around town blue and leather  
Walking them streets like the queen of hearts  
Laughing at nothin be alone together  
 Have starts  
  
Im on the fire but what can I do  
Im singing in the choir but Im lookin at you  
Ill be outside pick me up after school  
In your thunder black baby blue  
Thunder black baby blue  
Baby blue  
  
 Anything to have me  
I know youd do anything to love me  
Cuz Im a bad girl and Ia got a good plan  
Bank across the street Im a dangerous man  
Ask you who sweet you tell em I am baby blue baby blue  
  
Im on the fire but what can I do  
Im singing in the choir but Im lookin at you  
Ill be outside pick me up after school  
In your thunder black baby blue  
Thunder black baby blue  
Baby blue
