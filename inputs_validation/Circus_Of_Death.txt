Nine oclock flight from Hawaii  
The trident is just touching down  
Were waiting here on the tarmac  
McGarrett is wearing a frown  
  
Hes here to help with a problem  
A bloodspattered curse on our land  
Please cast your eye over this map sir  
This business is quite out of hand  
  
The circus of death is approaching  
Its pathway is painted in red  
Before it the frightened and helpless  
Behind it a trail of the dead  
  
The narcotic that forges their union  
Is a substance known only to one  
To the clown it is known as dominion  
Its a secret that hell give to none  
  
The drug which gives the clown power  
Means the circus can never be stopped  
And his dream can go on unhindered  
Til the last human being has dropped  
  
Spare me and my family  
Ive done you no wrong  
Go away please let us be  
Ive known you for too long
