I let go of the world that was holding  
A passenger that could not fly  
In search of souls  
Souls in search of something  
Let it go  
Let it slide  
When I find out what went on  
Ill bring it back  
It wont be easy  
They wont believe how a man  
He could drown  
In a starseed  
I hoped to find why this world wasnt glowing  
Glowing it darkens as we end this ride  
Ive fallen back under the equator  
Im back inside Im back inside  
When I find out what went on  
Ill bring it back but it wont be easy  
They wont believe the man he could  
But Id choose starseed over nothing  
Nothing
