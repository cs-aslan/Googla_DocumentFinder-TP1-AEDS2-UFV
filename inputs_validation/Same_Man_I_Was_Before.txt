Im not the same man I was before  
I havent changed my perception  
I havent lost my protection  
I havent lost havent lost havent lost  
What I have lost intentions  
Two by two coming through the door  
Singing like a bird  
Boys and girls voices joined in song  
Voices in the air  
Fire crackers making so much noise  
Flying in the air  
They all start yelling at me  
     Everything you do is wrong  
Im not the same boy I was before  
But Ive not changed my desires  
Ive not extinguished the fires  
I havent lost wide eyed wonder  
I havent lost havent lost havent lost  
The stupid fear of thunder  
Two by two walking hand in hand  
Walkin in the air  
The bone come marching from the promised land  
Comes from everywhere  
Their voices carry like the sound of glass  
Breaking on the ground  
It burns my ears when they sing  
     Everything you do is wrong  
Im not the same ghost I was before  
But I still converse with the spirits  
When people talk I dont hear it  
I walk through doors when no one sees me  
I disappear I disappear disappear  
Whenever it may please me
