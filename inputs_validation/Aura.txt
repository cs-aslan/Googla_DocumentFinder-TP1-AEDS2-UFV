I killed my former and  
Left her in the trunk on highway ten  
Put the knife under the hood  
If you find it send it straight to Hollywood  
  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  
Auraaaa auraaaa  
Auraaaa auraaaa  
Auraaaa auraaaa  
  
Im not a wandering slave I am a woman of choice  
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face  
You ought to pity me cause was always one man to love  
But in the bedroom the size of hims more than enough  
  
Do you wanna see me naked lover  
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover  
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura behind the aura  
Do you wanna touch me cosmic lover  
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover  
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura  
Behind the aura behind the aura behind the aura  
  
Enigma pop star is fun she wear burqa for fashion  
Its not a statement as much as just a move of passion  
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil  
I hear you screaming is it because of pleasure or toil

Dance sex art pop tech  
  
Do you wanna see me naked lover  
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover  
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura behind the aura  
Do you wanna touch me cosmic lover  
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover  
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura  
Behind the aura behind the curtain behind the burga
