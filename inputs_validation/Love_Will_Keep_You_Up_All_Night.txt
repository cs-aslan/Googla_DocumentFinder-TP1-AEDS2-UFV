Brian  
I wont tell nobody  
Ill just scream it in my mind  
Nothing good in life is scripted  
Its not like we predicted  
That the one you want  
Is gonna be the one you thought  
  
Nick  
I wont tell nobody  
But I wont live like a prisoner  
Nothing has to be so perfect  
Can you tell me was it worth it  
Because her heart cant lie  
And even though her face may try  
Love can keep you up all night  
  
Chorus mainly Nick  
Cause love will keep you up all night  
Its not something you can decide  
One day youre all alone  
The next youre crying on the phone  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
Love will keep you up all night  
  
Brian  
If I dont tell a living soul  
Still everyone would know  
Yes they would  
Its always three am somewhere  
You know it when you get there  
  
AJ  
Some people try to cover it up  
Some people think its never enough never enough  
  
Chorus mainly AJ  
Cause love will keep you up all night  
Its not something you can decide  
One day youre all alone  
The next youre crying on the phone  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
Love will keep you up all night  
  
Nick  
I dont mean to scare you  
But everybody has a first time  
One day when youre old and gray  
Dont look back and never say  
You should have tried  
Stayed up all night  
  
Love will keep you up all night  
Its not something you can decide  
  
AJ  
One day youre all alone  
The next youre crying on the phone  
  
All  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
To the other side  
Love will keep you up all night  
Its not something you can decide  
One day youre all alone  
The next youre cryin youre cryin  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
  
Love will keep you up all night  
Love will keep you up all night  
  
AJ  
Love will keep you up all night
