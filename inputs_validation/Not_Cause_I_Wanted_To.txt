Well Im calling you  
Cause you deserve to know  
You are not the reason that I had to go  
Late at night in these hotel rooms  
I think of all Ive lost  
What Ive put you through  
  
And if I knew the reason  
I would tell you why somehow  
The feeling slipped away  
I only did what I had to do  
Not cause I wanted to  
  
Ive got a guilty heart  
And a troubled mind  
No matter where I go  
Youre never far behind  
Id like to think  
That youve forgiven me  
But forgiveness aint enough  
To wash my conscience clean  
  
Oh and if I knew the reason  
I would tell you why somehow  
The feeling slipped away  
I only did what I had to do  
Not cause I wanted to  
  
I only did what I had to do  
Not cause I wanted to
