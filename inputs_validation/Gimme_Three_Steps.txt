I was cutting the rug  
Down at place called The Jug  
With a girl named Linda Lou  
When in walked a man  
With a gun in his hand  
And he was looking for you know who  
He said Hey there fellow  
With the hair colored yellow  
Whatcha tryin to prove  
Cause thats my woman there  
And Im a man who cares  
And this might be all for you  
I said Excuse me  
  
I was scared and fearing for my life  
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree  
Cause he was lean mean  
Big and bad Lord  
Pointin that gun on me  
Oh wait a minute mister  
I didnt even kiss her  
Dont want no trouble with you  
And I know you dont owe me  
But I wish youd let me  
Ask one favor from you  
  
Oh wont you  
Gimme three steps gimme three steps mister  
Gimme three steps toward the door  
Gimme three steps gimme three steps mister  
And youll never see me no more  
  
For sure  
  
Well the crowd cleared away  
And I began to pray  
And the water fell on the floor  
And Im telling you son  
Well it aint no fun  
Staring straight down a fortyfour  
Well he turned and screamed at Linda Lou  
And thats the break I was looking for  
Well you could hear me screaming a mile away  
I was headed out toward the door  
  
Oh wont you  
Gimme three steps gimme three steps mister  
Gimme three steps toward the door  
Gimme three steps gimme three steps mister  
And youll never see me no more  
  
Show me the back door
