I can see you come to gossip and they tell me so and so  
But theres not a thing about him I dont already know  
I guess you think Im crazy but it keeps him here with me  
And I only see the things I wanna see  
I only see the things I wanna see where hes concerned  
It wouldnt do my heart no good believe in what Ive learned  
I cant face the truth about the man hell never be  
So I only see the things I wanna see  
 piano   
I only see the things I wanna see where hes concerned  
It wouldnt do my heart much good believe in what Ive learned  
But its worth all my heartaches when I have him here with me  
So I only see the things I wanna see yes I only see the things I wanna see
