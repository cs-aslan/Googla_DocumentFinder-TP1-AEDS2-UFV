I have waited oh so long  
Please dont tell me baby I was wrong  
Dreaming of you every night  
Holding back until the time was right  
  
Ive counted the days day after day  
Since weve been apart  
Now Ive found my way Ive found my way  
Right back to your heart  
  
Ive been searching for you every where  
Calling you but you were never there  
Seeking in the dark of night  
Hoping one day you would shine a light  
  
Ive counted each day day after day  
Since weve been apart  
Now Ive found my way Ive found my way  
Right back to your heart  
  
I have waited oh so long  
Please dont tell me baby I was wrong  
Dreaming of you every night every night every night  
Holding back until the time was right  
  
Ooh I have waited so long  
Aah dont tell me I was wrong  
  
I dream of you Im dreaming of you baby  
  
Dont go away
