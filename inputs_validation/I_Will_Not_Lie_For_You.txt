I will not lie I will not lie I will not lie I will not lie for you  
  
Every time I see you fooling around on him  
I cant help but remember that he calls me his friend  
Its only right for me to tell you when its the wrong thing to do  
Its only right that you should know  
If he comes to me I will not lie for you no I wont lie for you  
  
Its hard enough to see him stumbling blind  
I refuse to see him lose you and me at the same time  
Its only right for me to tell you when its the wrong thing to do  
Its only right that you should know  
If he comes to me I will not lie for you no I wont lie for you  
  
To come here as your friend and have you come on like my lover  
like to bring things to an end between myself and my brother  
If it was any other man I would not interfere  
But if you come on to me again I dont see how to stand clear  
Its only right for me to tell you when its the wrong thing to do  
Its only right that you should know  
if he asks me I will not lie for you mama I wont lie for you  
  
If it was any other man I would not interfere  
But if you come on to me again I dont see how to stand clear  
Its only right for me to tell you when its the wrong thing to do  
Its only right that you should know  
If he asks me I will not lie I will not lie I will not lie I will not lie
for you  
  
No I wont lie for you little girl I wont lie for you  
No I wont lie to him for you I will not lie for you
