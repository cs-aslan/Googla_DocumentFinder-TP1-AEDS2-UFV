Oh Sandy Grey are you going away  
Leave me a message before parting  
Time has changed you and the things that pain you  
Are the things you think of as youre starting  
Oh Sandy Grey its only this Ill pray  
That you might stay here one more day in laughter  
Wont you hang around and hold me repeat all the lies you told me  
Do your rambling after  
Oh Sandy Grey what ever made you want to stay  
And now what makes you want to be aleaving  
Is it the same thing they found when they laid your father down  
Or are your reasons even worth retrieving  
Oh Sandy Grey dont leave me just today  
Dont think on the road youll be agoing  
Think of all the time and the days weve had to mind  
Of the future theres no way of knowing  
Oh Sandy Grey I thought I heard you say  
That you aint heard one word that Ive been speaking  
Theres no use in trying you escaping from my mind  
And Ill never see the world youre seeking
