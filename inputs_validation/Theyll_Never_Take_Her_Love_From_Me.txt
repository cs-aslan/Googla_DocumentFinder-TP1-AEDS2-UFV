If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares  
There is still one smiling face the Gods would see  
But shell walk along beside me up those golden stairs  
Oh theyll never ever take her love from me  
  
What a fool I was to go and break the trust she gave  
And watch her love turn into sympathy  
Its the one regret Ill carry with me to my grave  
Oh theyll never never take her love from me  
  
Im so thankful for each golden hour of happiness  
That we shared together in the use to be  
Someone elses arms may hold her now in fond caress  
But theyll never never take her love from me  
  
Well I though Id make her happy if Id step aside  
But I knew her love would never set me free  
And even on the morning she became anothers bride  
I said theyll never never take her love from me  
  
No theyll never never take her love from me
