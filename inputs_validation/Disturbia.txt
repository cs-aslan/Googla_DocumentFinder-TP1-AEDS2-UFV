Bum bum bedum bum bum bedum bum  
Bum bum bedum bum bum bedum bum  
Bum bum bedum bum bum bedum bum  
Bum bum bedum bum bum bedum bum  
  
No more gas in the red  
Cant even get it started  
Nothing heard nothing said  
Cant even speak about it  
All my life on my head  
Dont want to think about it  
Feels like Im going insane  
Yeah  
  
Its a thief in the night  
To come and grab you  
It can creep up inside you  
And consume you  
A disease of the mind  
It can control you  
Its too close for comfort  
  
Chorus  
Throw on your break lights  
Were in the city of wonder  
Aint gonna play nice  
Watch out you might just go under  
Better think twice  
Your train of thought will be altered  
So if you must falter be wise  
Your mind is in Disturbia  
Its like the darkness is the light  
Disturbia  
Am I scaring you tonight  
Your mind is in Disturbia  
Aint used to what you like  
Disturbia  
Disturbia

Faded pictures on the wall  
Its like they talkin to me  
Disconnectin your call  
Your phone dont even ring  
I gotta get out  
Or figure this shit out  
Its too close for comfort  
  
Its a thief in the night  
To come and grab you  
It can creep up inside you  
And consume you  
A disease of the mind  
It can control you  
I feel like a monster

Ive been trying to maintain  
But Im struggling  
You cant go go go  
I think Im going to oh oh oh
