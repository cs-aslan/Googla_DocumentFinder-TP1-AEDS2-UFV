You ask how much I need you must I explain  
I need you oh my darling like roses need rain  
You ask how long Ill love you Ill tell you true  
Until the 12th of Never Ill still be loving you  
Hold me close never let me go hold me close melt my heart like April snow  
Ill love you till the bluebells forget to bloom  
Ill love you till the clover has lost its perfume  
Ill love you till the poets run out of rhymes  
Until the 12th of Never and thats a long long time  
Until the 12th of Never and thats a long long time
