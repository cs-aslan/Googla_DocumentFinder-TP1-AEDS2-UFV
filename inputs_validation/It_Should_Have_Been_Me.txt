As I passed by  
A real fine hotel  
A chick walked out  
She sure looked swell  
I gave her the eye  
And started to carry on  
When a Cadillac cruised up  
And swish she was gone  
It shouldve been me  
With that real fine chick  
It shouldve been me  
With that real fine chick  
Hey hey hey hey driving that Cadillac  
A little later on  
A theater I passed  
I spotted another chick  
And did she have class  
I was all set  
To write her name in my book  
When her husband came up and gave me a  
Real dirty look  
It shouldve been me  
With that real fine chick  
It shouldve been me  
With that real fine chick  
It shouldve been me  
To have been her chaperone  
When I got to the corner  
I saw a sharp cat  
With a 300 dollar suit on  
And a 100 dollar hat  
He was standing on the sidewalk  
By a Dynaflow  
When a voice within said  
Cmon daddy lets go  
It shouldve been me  
With that real fine chick  
It shouldve been me  
With that real fine chick  
It shouldve been me  
Hey hey hey hey driving that Dynaflow  
I ate a bowl of chili  
And I felt ok  
At least until I passed  
This fine Cafe  
I saw a guy eatin  
A great big steak  
While a waitress stood by feedin him  
Ice cream and cake  
It shouldve been me  
With that real fine chick  
It shouldve been me  
With that real fine chick  
You know it shouldve been me  
Eatin ice cream and cake  
It shouldve been me  
Gettin my natural kicks  
It shouldve been me  
Gettin my natural kicks  
Hey hey hey hey lovin those crazy chicks
