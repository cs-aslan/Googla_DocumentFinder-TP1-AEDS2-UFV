I felt this way before  
I fell right through the floor  
And I am certain Ive become  
Broken bruised and numb  
Would you restate your opinion  
And hold back your investigation  
Do you see the sins youre making  
Cause Ive made them all before  
  
I will now rise from the ashes  
Dont call me pretentious  
Im sitting here making my own rules  
And if I fall from the ceiling  
Youll be down there waiting  
And my only hope  
Is falling down  
  
And by my own admission  
Youll find that my condition  
Is worse than you imagined  
Youre better off if you know  
But every time before that I  
Tried to measure pain inside  
You cant ignore it  
Right now I cant ignore it  
  
I will now rise from the ashes  
Dont call me pretentious  
Im sitting here making my own rules  
And if I fall from the ceiling  
Youll be down there waiting  
To finish me  
  
Inside of me x7  
Ill take my heart  
And rip my feelings out  
Before they make me doubt  
And Ill fall down with flames burning  
Alive again  
As long as you know that  
  
I will now rise from the ashes  
Dont call me pretentious  
Im sitting here making my own rules  
And if I fall from the ceiling  
Youll be down there waiting  
To finish me  
Finish me
