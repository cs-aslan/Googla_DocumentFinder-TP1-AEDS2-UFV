I can hear through these walls  
I can hear it when theyre foolin around  
I can hear through these walls  
And I hear every sign every sound  
I can hear through these walls  
In the dark with the shades pulled down  
  
Every word that they say  
Every noise they make feels its coming my way  
  
My favorite moment  
Putting the glass up next to the wall  
Imagination  
Tho I see nothing I hear it all  
Putting my sign up  
Do not disturb me speak or shout inside out  
Oh mind my clothes theyre all laid out  
  
I can see through my windows  
I can see the girls and the boys  
I can see through my windows  
And I can imagine the noise  
I can see through my windows  
I can see them playing with toys  
  
Oh I hope it wont end  
If I promise not to touch just be a friend  
  
Life is so lonely  
I dont get high off just being me  
I like pretending  
Wanting to touch them wanting to see  
Its only normal  
Creeping behind you now dont shout cos its alright  
They keep the windows locked and the door shut tight  
  
Oh Im feeling like Im locked in a cage  
No way in no way out and it gets so lonely  
Am I really asking a lot  
Just to reach out and touch somebody  
Cos when I look through my windows or open my door  
I can feel it all around me  
  
I can hear through these walls  
I can hear it when theyre foolin around  
I can hear through these walls  
And I hear every sight every sound  
I can hear through these walls  
In the dark with the shades pulled down  
  
Every word that they say  
Every noise they make feels its coming my way  
  
Ah yeah
