Imagine  
The dreams we had since we were children  
Are real  
Its magick  
To see their minds filled with the music  
We feel  
Well heres your message from above  
And if you want to push come to shove  
Alright  
This aint no lullaby  
Were right at home in the California sky  
  
Illusions  
Are taking part of the confusion  
In me  
Tomorrow  
Therell be no heroes left to follow  
Youll see  
Bright lights that flash across the sky  
May be the reason why were all insane and I  
I dont want to get away and  
Were right at home in the California sky  
  
Live from the mansion on the hill  
Reminds me of the way we used to feel right  
Orions aligned now  
Turn back the time  
The California sky
