Theres a grey horse standin still  
As a soldier climbs in the saddle for one last ride  
As the rain pours off his hat  
You can see the shadows of the past written in his eyes  
  
Now the cannons are silent  
His friends are all gone  
Gotta put it all behind him  
If he ever wants to find his way home  
Hes the last rebel on the road  
  
Just a boy with his old guitar  
Keeps to himself but everybody takes him wrong  
But he carries on  
Got a dream that will never die  
Cant change him no use in stayin where you dont belong  
  
Now hes rollin down the highway  
Gone too far too fast  
No one will ever find him hell never look back  
  
Chorus  
cause hes the last rebel  
And hes all alone  
Hes the last rebel  
His friends are all gone  
Hes the last rebel  
The last rebel on the road  
  
Therell never be another like him  
Hes the last of a dying breed  
Aint no use in tryin to tame him  
cause hes the last rebel  
  
Chorus
