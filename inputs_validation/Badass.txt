Ooohhhhh  
I could feel it from the start  
Couldnt stand to be apart  
Something about you caught my eye  
Something moved me deep inside  
Dont know what you did boy but  
You had it and Ive been hooked ever since  
I told my mother my brother my sister and my friend  
I told the others my lovers both past and present tense  
Everytime I see you everything starts making sense  
  
Just do your thang honey  
  
Chorus  
  
Aint no other man can stand up next to you  
Aint no other man on the planet does what you do  
What you do  
Youre the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon  
You got soul you got class  
You got style with your bad ass  oh yeah  
Aint no other man its true  all right   
Aint no other man but you  
  
Just do your thang honey  
  
Never thought Id be all right No no no  
Till you came and changed my life Yeah yeah yeah  
What was cloudy now is clear Yeah yeah  
Youre the light that I needed  
You got what I want boy and I want it  
So keep on givin it up  
  
Tell your mother your brother your sister and your friend  
And the others your lovers better not be present tense  
Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine and no one elses  
  
Oooooooo oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Aint no other man can stand up next to you  
Aint no other man on the planet does what you do
