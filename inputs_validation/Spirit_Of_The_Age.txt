Hate lust soul rage  
Youre so full of hate youre so full of lust  
Youre so full of soul youre so full of rage  
Spirit of the age  
Here comes the voodoo king here comes a powerful man  
My face on every front page my plans for everyone  
I reason your existence that is what I want to be  
Your whore and your messiah if you believe in me  
Im not a true creator Im just a cheap reflection  
Im the impersonator of anyones conception  
But if you read my lips just on your own behalf  
Ill be a remedy not just an epitaph  
Youre so full of hate you need a vacation  
So full of lust you need liberation  
You need damnation you need salvation  
Youre so full of hate  
Spirit of the age  
Here comes the new religion of everything you are  
My sword is your conviction my voice your media  
Im here to justify you thats what I want to do  
I dont believe in visions but I believe in you  
Here comes the voodoo king here comes a powerful man  
My face on every front page my plans for everyone  
Im here to satisfy you thats what I want to be  
Your whore and your messiah if you believe in me  
Youre so full of crime you wipe out a nation  
So full of sex youre a sensation  
You need damnation you need salvation  
Youre so full of fear  
Youre so full of hate you need a vacation  
So full of lust you need liberation  
You need damnation you need salvation  
Youre so full of hate  
Spirit of the age
