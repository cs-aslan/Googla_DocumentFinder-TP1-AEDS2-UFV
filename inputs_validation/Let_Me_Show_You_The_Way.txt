Im looking at you old friend of mine  
Theres no use pretending that everythings fine  
Now dont be so brave dont be so proud  
I want you to know that Im here for you now  
  
I can see you hurting and its hurting me  
It doesnt have to be this way  
  
Chorus  
Somebody gonna hold your head up  
If you let me hold you closer  
Somebody gonna show you the light  
Let me know you  
Somebody gonna hold your head up  
Let me show you the way  
Somebody gonna see you right  
  
Im feeling for you feeling so much  
When this heart is big enough for the both of us  
Ill give you my love if you give me your pain  
Ill hold it inside of me till youre stronger again  
  
Well I hate seeing you so far away  
When not a word can say it enough  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill be your rock for this day  
When I hear you calling out my name  
Cause I know youd only do the same for me  
  
Chorus
