Its the way we touch  
Oh feel it oh feel it  
I was alone waiting with my fantasies  
Until you came liberated me  
And taught me so much about humanity  
Yeahe yeaheyeah  
  
I needed you to know  
Youre more than just a one night stand  
And girl with your permission  
Baby you can give me your hand  
Not your romance  
  
Chorus  
Coz its the way you touch me baby  
Oh its the way you touch me baby  
If you want we can talk all night long  
But its the way you touch me baby  
  
I was alone grasping for my sanity  
You beauty came free of vanity  
Opened my mind gave me your anatomy  
Yeah  e  yeah  e  yeah  
  
I needed you to know  
Your more than just a one night stand  
I need some supervision  
Im losing all control of my hands  
In your command  
  
Chorus  
  
Come on baby oh oh yeah  
Oh baby  
  
You should really know youve got me eating from your hand  
And the ship is gonna blow  
And baby its not gonna end  
Till your coming  
  
Its the way you touch  
  
Chorus  
Its the way we touch  
Its the way we touch  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh feel it  
Oh oh yeah  
Oh feel it  
Oh oh yeah  
  
Fade
