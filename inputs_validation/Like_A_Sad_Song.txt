Usually in the morning Im filled with sweet belonging  
And evrything is beautiful to see  
Even when its raining the sound of heaven singing  
Is simply joyful music to me  
  
Sometimes I feel like a sad song  
Like Im all alone without you  
  
So many diffrent places a million smiling faces  
Life is so incredible to me  
Especially to be near you and how it is to touch you  
Oh paradise was made for you and me  
  
I know that life goes on just perfectly  
And evrything is just the way that it should be  
Still there are times when my heart feels like breaking  
And anywhere is where Id rather be  
  
Oh and in the night time I know that its the right time  
To hold you close and say I love you so  
To have someone to share with  
And someone I can care with  
And that is why I wanted you to know  
  
Sometimes I feel like a sad song  
Like Im all alone without you without you
