Drink it up dont waste a drop  
Squeeze every second out of that old clock  
Kick it back man enjoy the ride  
Keep livin everyday like its Saturday night

Cuz you only get so much lighting in the bar  
Its only so many times you get to feel like this  
Light it up burn it down thats what lifes all about  
And you cant just take a lil sip fill yo cup drink it up

Live out every single minute while youre in it
