You see me smile but you paint an ugly face  
Everything you do is all about the chase  
Dont let them see you cry  
Dont let them know  
You wont lay down and die for their show  
  
Why dont you go ahead tear my heart out  
Why dont you go ahead hang me out to dry  
Go ahead play your game go ahead  
Spread my name all over your blood red sky  
  
They colour your stars till the light begins to fade  
But never give up cause every dog has its day  
Dont let them see you cry  
Dont let them know  
You wont lay down and die for their show  
  
Why dont you go ahead tear my heart out  
Why dont you go ahead hang me out to dry  
Go ahead play your game go ahead  
Spread my name all over your blood red sky  
Go ahead  
  
Why dont you go ahead go ahead go ahead  
Why dont you go ahead hang me out to dry  
I said go ahead play your game go ahead play your game go ahead play your
game  
Your blood red sky  
Why dont you go ahead tear my heart out  
Why dont you go ahead lay me out to dry  
Go ahead  
I said go ahead play your game go ahead  
Spread my name all over your blood red sky  
Go ahead  
Why dont you go ahead tear my heart out  
Why dont you go ahead hang me out to dry  
Go go go go go go go ahead and hang my heart out  
I said go ahead and play your game go ahead  
Spread my name all over your blood red sky  
Your blood red sky  
Blood red sky
