Ive been here before  
But always hit the floor  
Ive spent a lifetime running  
And I always get away  
But with you Im feeling something  
That makes me want to stay  
  
Im prepared for this  
I never shoot to miss  
But I feel like a storm is coming  
If Im gonna make it through the day  
Then theres no use in running  
This is something I gotta face  
  
If I risk it all  
Could you break my fall  
  
How do I live How do I breathe  
When youre not here Im suffocating  
I want to feel love run through my blood  
Tell me is this where I give it all up  
For you I have to risk it all  
Cause the writings on the wall  
  
A million shards of glass  
That haunt me from my past  
As the stars begin to gather  
And the light begins to fade  
When all hope begins to shatter  
Know that I wont be afraid  
  
If I risk it all  
Could you break my fall  
  
How do I live How do I breathe  
When youre not here Im suffocating  
I want to feel love run through my blood  
Tell me is this where I give it all up  
For you I have to risk it all  
Cause the writings on the wall  
  
The writings on the wall  
  
How do I live How do I breathe  
When youre not here Im suffocating  
I want to feel love run through my blood  
Tell me is this where I give it all up  
How do I live How do I breathe  
When youre not here Im suffocating  
I want to feel love run through my blood  
Tell me is this where I give it all up  
For you I have to risk it all  
Cause the writings on the wall
