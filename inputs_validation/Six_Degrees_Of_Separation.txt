Youve read the books youve watched the shows  
Whats the best way no one knows  
  
Meditate yea hypnotized  
Anything to take it from your mind  
But it wont go  
Youre doing all these things out of desperation  
Youre going through six degrees of separation  
  
You had the drink you take a toke  
Watch the past go up in smoke  
You fake a smile ya lie and say  
Youre better now than ever and your lifes okay  
But its not no  
  
Youre doing all these things out of desperation  
Youre going through six degrees of separation  
  
First you think the worst is a broken heart  
Whats gonna kill you is the second part  
And the third is when your world splits down the middle  
And fourth youre gonna think that you fixed yourself  
Fifth you see them out with someone else  
And the sixth is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little  
  
Oh no there aint no helping to remember ones self  
Oh no there aint no helping to remember ones self  
  
You tell your friends yea strangers too  
Anyone who will throw an arm around you  
Tarot cards gems and stones  
Believing all the shits gonna heal your soul  
Well its not whoa  
  
Youre only doing things out of desperation  
Youre going through six degrees of separation  
  
First you think the worst is a broken heart  
Whats gonna kill you is the second part  
And the third is when your world splits down the middle  
And fourth youre gonna think that you fixed yourself  
Fifth you see them out with someone else  
And the sixth is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little  
  
Oh no there aint no helping to remember ones self  
  
Oh no theres no starting over  
Without finding closure  
You take them back no hesitation  
Thats how you know youve reached the sixth degree of separation
