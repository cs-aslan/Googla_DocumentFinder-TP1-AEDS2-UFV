Motherfucker youd better break yourself  
  
My skin is my sin look at my complexion  
Section 8 erection great  
Balls like Ru Paul and a big fat plank  
Get you higher than a Spike Lee joint  
See Im a chicken hawk and Im hunting chicken and watermelon  
It aint nothing but hard time bailing  
Just got a misdomener  
Cause I got a deucefive and Im black as Sarafina  
Get the hell out Somolia we didnt call yall  
I cant wait till I can kill all yall  
Fuck Reggie Denton and Jimmy Johnny Cochran  
Damn I couldnt get close enough to sock him  
I plead guilty your honor  
Cause I dissed the Pope more times than Sinead OConnor  
Huh huh cool like Butthead and Beavis  
Truer than the Mack but Im downer than he is  
And that police chief named Willie  
Can take his motherfucking ass back to Philly  
Dropped a bomb on a crew named Move  
Years ago heres a hoe  
Thats ready to stop me they think Im Khadafi  
Rolling in a sixtre jalopy  
They want to give me ten in the pen cause Im smelling like Hen  
My skin is my sin  
  
My SKIN is my SIN Burning our black skin  
My SKIN is my SIN Burning our black skin  
  
I Get Around like Tupac just bought a new glock  
And I want what you got  
So please give it up so I can live it up  
Just like the rich but I still eat grits  
I dont know karate  
But I can still beat the dog shit out of Nazis  
You claim you want to put in work  
Plotting to blow up a church  
See you devils are all the same  
Youll gun down a congregation in Jesus name  
Using me as a scapegoat well cracker dont sleep  
Far from a goat more like a black sheep  
Lamb of God and its odd  
That Allah is a man that dont need a tan  
And you cant stand when I talk like that  
And why do black men have to walk like that  
Cause we swing low like a chariot  
And now I got Harriet all on my dick  
Cause my shoe size is much bigger than a motherfucking 10  
My skin is my sin  
  
My SKIN is my SIN Burning our black skin  
My SKIN is my SIN Burning our black skin  
  
Whos that jankyass nigga with last  
Standing like a G pissing on Americas flag  
Dub C the nigga from Westside  
Westide Maad Circle bailing with a double barrel  
Cause uh my skin is my sin  
And all I need is knowledge of self and ammunition is my best friend  
When its time to roll nigga we aint calling on Jesus  
Im calling Mad Dog for the 9 millimeters  
Cause I give the song with those peckerwoods to the fullest  
And a bitch by the name of Americas on it  
The same bitch that jacked my forefathers  
And the Indians took my motherfucking religion  
Place a holy Bible in my hand but for what  
Like Jim Kelly said You try to set me up Shit  
Im too slick for your lies in disguise  
When will you devils open your eyes and realize  
Like Pepsi niggas got a new generation  
And we dont want your American education  
Aint no brain washing this way  
Fuck America Tom Meztger and KKK  
And to the cracker named JB Stoner  
Dont let me catch you on no corners  
I see you on TV talking more shit  
But just like your punkass ancestors yous a bitch  
Yous a bitch if I ever saw one  
Grand Wizard bring your ass on Imperial so we can get physical  
And watch God show and prove  
Not only mentally but physically the black man rules  
So run devil run yous to best start running  
Because the niggas are coming oh the niggas are coming  
And aint no way you gon win  
Cause I come from a tribe of OGs and my skin is my sin  
  
My SKIN is my SIN Burning our black skin  
My SKIN is my SIN Burning our black skin
