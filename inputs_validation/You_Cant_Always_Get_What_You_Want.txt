I saw her today at the reception  
A glass of wine in her hand  
I knew she was gonna meet her connection  
As at her feet was a footloose man  
  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes  
You just might find  
Youll get what you need  
  
I went down to the demonstration  
To get my fair share of abuse  
Singing were gonna vent our frustrations  
And if we dont were gonna blow a 50amp fuse  
  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes  
Well you just might find  
Youll get what you need  
  
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore  
To get your prescription filled  
I was standing in line with Mister Jimmy  
And man did he look pretty ill  
We decided that we would have a soda  
My favorite flavor was cherry red  
I sung my song to Mister Jimmy  
And he said one word to me and that was dead  
  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
No no you cant always get what you want  
Oh you cant always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes  
You just might find  
Youll get what you need  
  
I saw her today at the reception  
In her glass was a bleeding man  
She was practiced at the art of deception  
Well I could tell by her bloodstained hands  
Oh yes I could  
  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes  
Yeah you just might find  
Youll get what you need  
Oh sugar youll get what you need yeah yeah yeah  
Youll get what you need yeah yeah yeah  
Youll get what you need yeah yeah yeah
