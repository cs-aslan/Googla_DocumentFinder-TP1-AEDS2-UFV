Dont go dont leave me here alone  
With nothing but a memory to call my own  
We shared each day and the days to years  
But now the love we share is blinded by tears  
  
Look in my eyes and speak to me  
Can you really forget me  
Ooh in the light youll be alright  
But every evening Ill be haunting you  
  
Chorus  
Dont close your eyes tonight  
Cause you know Ill be there in your dreams  
  
Oh babe dont go dont go  
Dont leave me here alone  
Forget me not whatever you do  
And please remember that  
I still love you  
  
I made it clear I need you here  
Every night I cry for you  
And do you know I cant let go  
Open up your arms Im coming home  
  
Chorus  
  
I made it clear I need you here  
Every night I cry for you  
And do you know I cant let go  
Open up your arms Im coming home  
  
Chorus
