Its that time of day  
That we all knew would come  
To pay for all the rum  
And pull up anchor cause were done  
Its that time of day  
I see a cotton candy sky  
So many colors in my eyes  
Proof again Gods alive  
  
This aint a goodbye  
Its a till I see you again  
What a wonderful time  
Weve all shared my friends  
Another day at sea  
Has come and gone away  
So adios to Jost  
Adios to Jost  
Adios to Jost  
Its that time of day  
  
Its that time of day  
When we bottle up the sun  
Let our inhibitions run  
Feeling courageous and numb  
Its that time of day  
When we take a leap of faith  
Hand in hand as we pray  
In this moment we could stay  
  
This aint a goodbye  
Its a till I see you again  
What a wonderful time  
Weve all shared my friends  
Another day at sea  
Has come and gone away  
So adios to Jost  
Adios to Jost  
Adios to Jost  
Its that time of day  
  
Adios to Jost  
Adios to Jost  
Adios to Jost  
Its that time of day  
  
I see sails in silhouette  
A sailors sky turning red  
So many I love yous said  
Toasts are made  
Its that time of day  
Its that time of day  
Its that time of day  
  
Adios to Jost  
Adios to Jost  
Adios to Jost  
Its that time of day
