If you feel your love might quit  
You only need a tiny bit  
Of two things I can help you see  
Togetherness and unity  
Take a tiny measure of them  
To restore your flag in love  
And if it still is running down  
Dont concentrate and  
Spread It Round  
Never cast it carelessly  
And save a tiny bit for me  
Because I know theres much to spare  
And people need it everywhere  
together we are all alone united  
On a spinning stone  
So if your love is running down  
Dont concentrate and  
Spread It Round  
Spread It Round  
Spread It Round  
so if its love that you have found  
Dont ever trade it  
Spread It Round  
Spread It Round  
Spread It Round  
Spread It Round  
And round and round  
Spread It Round  
Spread It Round  
Spread It Round  
Spread It Round  
And round and round  
Spread It Round  
Spread It Round  
Spread It Round
