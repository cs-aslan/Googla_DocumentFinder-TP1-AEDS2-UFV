I remember this afternoon  
When my sister came into the room  
She refused to say how my father was  
But i knew hed be dying soon  
  
And i was oh so glad and it was oh so sad  
That i realized that i despised this man i once called father  
In his hanging on with fingers clutching  
His body now just eightyeight pounds  
Blinded eyes still searching  
For some distant dream that had faded away at the seams  
Dying alone naturally  
  
I was his favourite child i had him a little while  
Just as long as i could play the piano and smile a little smile  
Just when i needed him most he was already a ghost  
And for all my life there where promises and they always have been broken  
  
Leaving me alone with all my troubles  
Not ever once touching me and saying  
daugther ill help you get over  
Now hes fadig away and im glad to say  
Hes dying at last naturally  
  
Its a very sad thing to see that my mother with all her heart  
Believes the words that the bible said til death do us two part  
For her that was forever and ay he decided her night and day  
How could some english words so small affect someone so strangely  
  
Taking her away from us her soul included  
She might es well be gone with him all the children are excluded  
Loneliness is hell i know so well  
For im alone naturally  
  
I waited three weeks for him to die  
I waited three weeks for him to die  
Every night he was calling on me  
I wouldnt go to him  
I waited three weeks for him to die  
Three weeks for him to die  
  
And after he died after he died  
Every night i went out every night i had a flight  
It didnt matter who it was with  
cos i knew what it was about  
And if you could read between lines my dad and i close as flies  
I loved him then and i loved him still thats why my hearts so broken  
  
Leaving me to doubt god in his mercy  
And if he really does exist then why does he desert me  
When he passed away i smoked and drank all day  
Alone again naturally
