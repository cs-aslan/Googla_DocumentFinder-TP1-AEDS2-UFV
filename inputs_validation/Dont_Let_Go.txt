I got your letter  
I felt so scared to  
Pick up the paper knife and read within  
I read the contents  
I got what you meant  
I know its hard for you but dont give in  
Maybe maybe slow things go fast  
Maybe maybe its all in the past  
  
Chorus  
Oh oh if you need me dont let go  oh  
You know Ill never give up on you  
Oh oh if you need me dont let go  oh  
You know I wont give up on you  
oo oo  oo oo oo  oo  
You know Ill never give up on you  
  
I phoned the station  
For information  
To try and get the times of trains to York  
And on the platform  
I saw your hatform  
A kind of halo in the crowd  crush talk  
  
But baby baby dont run away  
Maybe maybe its just today  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I saw your sad face  
You dropped your suitcase  
And I appreciate the state youre in  
You mustnt hurry  
You mustnt worry  
I know its hard on you but dont give in  
  
Maybe maybe slow things go fast  
Maybe maybe its all in the past
