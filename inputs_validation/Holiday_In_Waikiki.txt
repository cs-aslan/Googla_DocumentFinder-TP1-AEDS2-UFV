I won a competition in a little column in my local paper  
So I packed my bags and flew across the sea all on my local paper  
Sailing to Hawaii in the USA  
Im just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki  
  
I didnt realize it was commercialized when I unpacked my cases  
Because a genuine Hawaii ukulele cost me 30 guineas  
And even when Im swimming I have to pay  
Im just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
Across the coral sands I saw a hula hula dancer looking pretty  
I asked her where she came from and she said to me  
I come from New York City  
And my mother is Italian  
And my dads a Greek  
Im just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki  
  
Its a hooka hooka on the shiny briny on the way to Kona  
And in a little shack they had a little sign that said Coca Cola  
And even all the grass skirts were PVC  
Im just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
In Waikiki  
In Waikiki
