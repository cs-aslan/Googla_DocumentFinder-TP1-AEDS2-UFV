Verse 1  
First you love me and I let you in  
Made me feel like I was born again  
You empowered me you made me strong  
Built me up and I could do no wrong  
I let down my guard I fell into your arms  
Forgot who I was I didnt hear the alarms  
Now Im down on my knees alone in the dark  
I was blind to your game  
You fired a shot at my heart  
  
PreChorus  
Took me to heaven let me fall down  
Now that its over Im gonna carry on  
Lifted me up and watched me stumble  
After the heartache Im gonna carry on  
  
Chorus  
Living for love Im living for love  
Im not giving up  
Im gonna carry on  
Living for love Im living for love  
Not gonna stop  
Loves gonna lift me up  
  
Dance Break  
Love lift me up  
Loves gonna lift me up  
Love lift me up  
  
Verse 2  
I could get caught up in bitterness  
But Im not dwelling on this crazy mess  
I found freedom in the ugly truth  
I deserve the best and its not you  
Youve broken my heart but you cant break me down  
That have fallen apart what was lost now Im found  
I picked up my crown put it back on my head  
I can forgive but I will never forget  
  
PreChorus  
Took me to heaven let me fall down  
Now that its over Im gonna carry on  
Lifted me up and watched me stumble  
After the heartache Im gonna carry on  
  
Chorus  
Living for love Im living for love  
Im not giving up  
Im gonna carry on  
Living for love Im living for love  
Not gonna stop  
Loves gonna lift me up  
  
Dance Break  
Love lift me up  
Loves gonna lift me up  
Love lift me up  
  
Bridge  
Loves gonna lift me up  
Lift me up  
Loves gonna lift me up  
Upupupup

Loves gonna lift me up  
Upupupup
