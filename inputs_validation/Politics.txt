Everyones corrupt  
You should just shut up  
Lay down back off  
The demon you disrupted  
  
Dont want to talk about politics  
Dont preach or talk about politics  
Dont let me talk about politics  
Dont give a shit about politics  
  
You want to sleep with him to get to who you need to know  
Think thats the way to go dont you  
Its in religion sex and everything we do and say  
I look the other way wont you  
  
Everybodys raped  
Lying to your face  
Kicks you in the gut  
Slayed you here on the stop  
  
Dont want to talk about politics  
Dont preach or talk about politics  
Dont let me talk about politics  
Dont give a shit about politics  
  
You want to sleep with him to get to who you need to know  
Think thats the way to go dont you  
Its in religion sex and everything we do and say  
I look the other way wont you  
  
Tiniest dream living in your soul  
Darkest life in the deepest hole  
All the guilt from the things youve told  
What you thought was so much fun  
Youll have to pay for  
  
Dont want to talk about politics  
Dont preach or talk about politics  
Dont let me talk about politics  
Dont give a shit about politics  
  
You want to sleep with him to get to who you need to know  
Think thats the way to go dont you  
Its in religion sex and everything we do and say  
I look the other way wont you  
  
Dont want to talk about politics  
Dont preach or talk about politics  
Dont let me talk about politics  
Dont give a shit about politics  
  
Dont want to talk about politics  
Dont preach or talk about politics  
Dont let me talk about politics  
Dont give a shit about politics
