I am the eye I go blink blink  
Yes I am the eye and I can wink  
I am the eye but I cant think  
That belongs to my friend the brain  
  
Fritter fratter frit fritter fratter frit  
Im the brain with electric current patter pit  
Im the brain and I fritter learning bit by bit  
Yes I fritter fratter fritter all the time  
  
I go lub dub lub dub I go  
I am the heart I pump like so  
Im bringing life to all the parts  
I am consistent Im the heart  
  
Swinging Im swinging  
Swinging on lifes merry way  
Im the arm Im the arm  
Bringing grace to all  
  
Hearing hearing  
Small ears hearing  
We dont miss much  
Hearing all the time  
  
We are the body of Christ  
We are the body of Christ  
Together bringing His love to the world
