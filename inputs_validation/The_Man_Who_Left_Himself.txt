All good people your time will come  
Work forever and still not be done  
Close your tired eyes no one knows youve gone  
Its not forever but today youve become  
The man who left himself  
  
Dont belong here your heart beats too fast  
Feel the misbeat it starts and stops  
Dont be frightened these things never last  
Maybe tomorrow your time will have passed  
Its the man who left himself
