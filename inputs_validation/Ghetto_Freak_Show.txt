Ghetto freak show  
Its three oclock in the morning and youre sleeping  
Wicked clowns in the moonlight creeping  
Slide through your window under your bed  
  
Crawl in through your ear eat your head  
Bumping into bones cause I need light  
Tiptoeing down through your windpipe  
Climbing down your spine was the fun part  
  
Looky looky and I think I see your fucking heart  
Uh huh so Im stabbing like it aint nothing  
Wicked clown cut his way out your belly button  
Im like a vulture waiting in a dark place  
  
Swooping down and Im picking at your dead face  
Im sick but you dont know the whole deal  
No one ever loved me and they never will  
Bitch I take you out on a blind date  
  
But then they find you dead under a wooden crate  
Rapped in a bag deep in the woods  
Cause my mother always said I was no good  
Locked me in a closet fed me dog shit  
  
Well Im out now so motherfucker watch it  
The insanitys grip will never let go  
Heres your chance to a glimpse of a ghetto freak show  
Id rather be deadghetto freak show  
  
Im a freak show coming to your house  
Standing at your porch chewing on a dead mouse  
Im looking like a fly so you swat me  
Keep chasing me even though you got me  
  
So what you wanna do to a ghetto thug  
First you starve me and feed me them fuckin drugs  
Turn me into a wicked wicked cat  
Im coming to your house so catch ya catch ya clown  
  
Gotta have a fucking throat hatchet once hatchet twice  
Gotta have the governor the richer fucker pay the price  
Driving with your woman thats sweet  
Never even know Im in the back seat  
  
Chat chitchat about the weather  
But then I slam they fucking heads together  
Is it jealousy they never loved me  
So now Im ripping out your guts and its ugly  
  
Im trapped dont wanna be a rich man  
Not a poor man I need my own land  
Because the rich man be stressing all the dumb stuff  
They cut there fucking wrists if the grass aint green enough  
  
Right there in your face you cant tag it  
Just found out your son is a faggot  
Dicksucking buttfucking homo man  
If ya stressing then you better talk to mojo man  
  
Insanitys grip will never let go  
Heres your chance to catch a glimpse of a ghetto freak show  
Id rather be deadghetto freak show
