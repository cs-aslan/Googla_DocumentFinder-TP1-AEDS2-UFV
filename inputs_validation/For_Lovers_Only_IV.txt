The last verse was the hardest the hardest to get through  
This verse for old lost lovers this song I wrote for you  
Shes at the point of no return theres no more candles left to burn  
Shes broken every chain that bound her to your soul  
She doesnt care whats right or wrong youve been her victim for too long  
She knows youre too weak to be strong youll lose control  
Nothing seems to bother her shes as cool as cool has ever been  
She knows she can handle you youve been her fool since God knows when  
 sax   
Theres no more chances left to take youre just another heart shell break  
Youre not the first one or the last to come along  
She knows exactly how you feel you think you got a dirty deal  
You left your heart where she could steal it for a song  
 sax  banjo
