Why can you read me like no one else  
I hide behind these words  
But Im coming out  
I wish I kept them behind my tongue  
I hide behind these words  
But Im coming out  
  
Put your hand between an aching head  
And an aching wound  
Well make them so jealous  
Well make them hate us  
An aching head  
And an aching wound  
Well make them so jealous  
Well make them so jealous  
  
Always you made my stomach turn  
And all the long drives  
With my friends blur  
And I wish I kept them inside my mind  
I hide behind these words  
And think of all the places  
Where youve been lost  
And found out  
In between my sheets  
In between the rights and the wrongs  
  
Put your hand between an aching head  
And an aching wound  
Well make them so jealous  
Well make them hate us  
An aching head  
And an aching wound  
  
Think of all the places  
Where youve been lost  
And found out
