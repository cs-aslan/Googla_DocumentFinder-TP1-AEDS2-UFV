Wake up  Theres a new day dawning  
I think Ill take a little walk for a while  
I need shades cause the sun is blinding  
And I can see for miles and miles  
Then I can feel the earth beneath me  
I lie down we are as one  
And they look but they cannot find me  
Im off heading for the sun  
  
Im getting colder  
I feel a chill the air  
Theres a change in the weather  
Here it comes again  
Now I can feel the rain  
  
The wind that brings on the change  
Is taking me over  
The wind that brings on the rain  
Is making me older  
  
Downtown the moon is shining  
Im gonna dress me up in style  
My business everybodys minding  
I need to get away for a while  
  
Im getting colder  
I feel a chill the air  
Theres a change in the weather  
Here it comes again  
Now I can feel the rain  
  
The wind that brings on the change  
Is taking me over  
The wind that brings on the rain  
Is making me older
