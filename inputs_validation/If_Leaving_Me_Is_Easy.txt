I read all the letters I read each word that youve sent to me  
And though its past now and the words start to fade  
All the memories I have start still remain  
  
Ive kept all the pictures but I hide my feelings so noone knows  
Oh sure my friends all come round but Im in a crowd on my own  
Its cause youre gone now but your heart still remains  
And itll be here if you come again  
  
You see Id heard the rumors I knew before you let me know  
But I didnt believe it not you  
No you would not let me go  
Seems I was wrong but I love I love you the same  
And thats the one thing that you cant take away but just remember  
  
If leaving me is easy  
Going back is harder
