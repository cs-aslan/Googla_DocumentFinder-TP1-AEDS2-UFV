In a book in a box in the closet  
In a line in a song I once heard  
In a moment on a front porch late one June  
In a breath inside a whisper beneath the moon  
  
There it was at the tip of my fingers  
There it was on the tip of my tongue  
There you were and I had never been that far  
There it was the whole world wrapped inside my arms  
And I let it all slip away  
  
Chorus  
What do I do now that youre gone  
No back up plan no second chance  
And no one else to blame  
All I can hear in the silence that remains  
Are the words I couldnt say  
  
Theres a rain thatll never stop falling  
Theres a wall that Ive tried to take down  
What I shouldve said just wouldnt pass my lips  
So I held back and now weve come to this  
And its too late now  
  
Chorus  
  
Are the words I couldnt say  
  
I should have found a way to tell you how I felt  
Now the only one Im tellin is myself  
  
Chorus  
  
What do I do what do I say  
And no one else to blame  
All I can hear in the silence that remains  
Are the words I couldnt say
