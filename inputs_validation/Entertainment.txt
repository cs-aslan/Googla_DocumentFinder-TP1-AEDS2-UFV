Theres been another assassination  
TV cameras moving in  
To shoot the bloodstains on the pavement  
And get them on the News at Ten  
Will he live or will he die before we go on the air  
Yes the networks are all there in the name of  
Entertainment  
  
Superstar psycho from a killer to a hero  
An overnight sensation on the lips of all the nation  
Is he mad or is he sane It makes for good conversation  
I call it suffering and pain but they call it entertainment
