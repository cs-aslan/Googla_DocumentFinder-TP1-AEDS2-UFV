I love you more than the first sunset  
The first star I saw I would surely bet  
So how could you ever could you ever forget  
  
Youre here but youre gone  
Its in your eyes  
Somethings gone wrong  
Youve stifled your cries  
You cant expect that Ill ever forget  
  
All the details of your mind you would tell me through the night  
After wed made love and the way was so open  
Now you turn your back to me  
As if wed never spoken  
  
But I still love you more than the first sunset  
I swear I caught a shooting star the first time we met  
So how could you ever  
I know that Ill never  
How could you ever ever forget
