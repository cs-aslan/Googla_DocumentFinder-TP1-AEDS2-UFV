intro walking tall full of tedious charm  
The smoothest     in      
The mission boys all cross their palms  
Dont you know who I am  
I guess you miss the lights huh  
I guess you miss the fame  
I guess you miss everybody  
Hanging onto your name  
Little caesar is prince of the city  
    
In this town theres no pity  
This man stands alone  
I guess you miss the lights  ha  
I guess you miss the fame  
I guess you miss everybody  
Hanging onto your name  
Sometimes when youre all alone  
And the blue turns to gray  
Better get down on those pinky knees  
And you start to pray  
I guess you miss the lights  ha  
I guess you miss the fame  
I guess you miss everybody  
Kisskissing your name  
instrumental  
A glimmering   a twilight star  
And so much love for show  
A returning wave from the gallery bar  
And share the afterglow  
I guess you miss the lights  
I guess you miss the fame  
I guess you miss everybody  
Hanging onto your name  
Ha  
I guess you miss the lights  
I guess you miss the fame haha  
I guess you miss everybody  
Hanging onto your name  
fade out music and chorus  
I guess you miss the lights  
I guess you miss everybody  
Kisskissing your name
