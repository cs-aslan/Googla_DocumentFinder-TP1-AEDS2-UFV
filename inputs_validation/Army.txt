Verse 1  
I know that Ive messed up  
You never let me give up  
All the nights and the fights  
And the blood and the breakups  
Youre always there to call up  
Im a pain Im a child Im afraid  
But yeah you understand  
Yeah like no one can  
I know that we dont look like much  
But no one fucks it up like us  
  
Verse 2  
Sixteen and you never even judged me  
Matter of fact I always thought you were too cool for me  
Sitting there in the caravan  
All the nights weve been drunk on the floor  
And yeah you understand  
Yeah like no one can  
We both know what they say about us  
But they dont stand a chance because  
  
Chorus  
When Im with you  
When Im with you  
Im standing with an army  
Im standing with an army  
When Im with you  
When Im with you  
Im standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
  
Verse 3  
Dark times you can always find the bright side  
Im amazed by the things that you would sacrifice  
Just to be there for me  
How you cringe when you sing out of tune  
And yeah its everything  
So dont change a thing  
We both know what they say about us  
But they dont stand a chance because  
  
Chorus  
When Im with you

Yeah like no one can  
We both know what they say about us  
  
Chorus  
When Im with you
