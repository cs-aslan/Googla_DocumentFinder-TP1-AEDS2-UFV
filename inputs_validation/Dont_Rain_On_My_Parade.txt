Dont tell me not to live just sit and putter  
Lifes candy and the suns a ball of butter  
Dont bring around a cloud to rain on my parade  
  
Dont tell me not to fly I simply got to  
If someone takes a spill its me and not you  
Who told you youre allowed to rain on my parade  
  
Ill march my band out Ill beat my drum  
And if Im fanned out your turn at bat sir  
At least I didnt fake it hat sir  
I guess I didnt make it  
  
But whether Im the rose of sheer perfection  
A freckle on the nose of lifes complexion  
The cinder or the shiny apple of its eye  
  
I gotta fly once I gotta try once  
Only can die once right sir  
Ooh life is juicy juicy and you see  
I gotta have my bite sir  
  
Get ready for me love cause Im a comer  
I simply gotta march my hearts a drummer  
Dont bring around a cloud to rain on my parade  
  
Im gonna live and live now  
Get what I want I know how  
One roll for the whole shebang  
One throw and that bell will go clang  
Eye on the target and wham  
One shot one gun shot and bam  
Hey Mister Arnstein here I am  
  
Ill march my band out Ill beat my drum  
And if Im fanned out your turn at bat sir  
At least I didnt fake it hat sir  
I guess I didnt make it  
  
Get ready for me love cause Im a comer  
I simply gotta march my hearts a drummer  
Nobody no nobody is gonna rain on my parade
