Christmas present Christmas tree  
Childrens eyes are wide to see  
Santas presents neath the tree  
All day asked for on his knee  
  
Christmas present Christmas past  
From the presents which ones last  
Christmas future sure to be  
Looking underneath the tree  
  
For the present look high not low  
Christmas was a gift itself many years ago  
Christmas presents at the start  
Was a gift from someones heart  
  
Christ is Christmas that day is His  
Thats what Christmas presents is
