Tuesday mornin now  
I gotta have somewhere to go  
I call up Tommy now  
I call him on the telephone  
Oh wont you wake up and come with me now  
Im going to the pawn and loan  
Walkin down thirty three  
Walkin down thirty oh  
  
What am I supposed to think  
  
I love people like a brother now  
But Im not gonna be their mother now  
What if someone walked up to me  
And  
Like and apple cut right through me  
Im no just gonna stand their grinnin  
Cause Im not the one whos sinnin  
Screwdriver  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Now that you have heard my story now  
I got a little endin to it now  
Whenever you go out alone  
Take a little dog a bone  
And think about your little sister  
And then you gotta drive it home  
Screwdriver  
  
I got a little feeling goin now x11  
Now now
