Oh the prairie lights are burnin bright  
The Chinook wind is amovin in  
Tomorrow night Ill be Alberta bound  
Though Ive done the best I could  
My old luck aint been so good and  
Tomorrow night Ill be Alberta bound  
No oneeyed man could eer forget  
The Rocky Mountain sunset  
Its a pleasure just to be Alberta bound  
I long to see my next of kin  
To know what kind of shape theyre in  
Tomorrow night Ill be Alberta bound  
  
Alberta bound Alberta bound  
Its good to be Alberta bound  
Alberta bound Alberta bound  
Its good to be Alberta bound  
  
Oh the skyline of Toronto  
Is somethin youll get onto  
But they say youve got to live there for a while  
And if you got the money  
You can get yourself a honey  
A written guarantee ta make you smile  
But its snowin in the city  
And the streets and brown and gritty  
And I know theres pretty girls all over town  
But they never seem ta find me  
And the one I left behind me  
Is the reason that Ill be Alberta bound  
  
Alberta bound Alberta bound  
Its good to be Alberta bound  
Alberta bound Alberta bound  
Its good to be Alberta bound  
Its good to be Alberta bound
