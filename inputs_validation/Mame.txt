You coax the blues right out of the horn Mame  
You charm the husk right off of the corn Mame  
Youve got the banjos strummin and plunkin out a tune to beat the band  
The whole plantations hummin since you brought Dixie back to Dixieland  
  
You make your Louis feel like the king Mame  
You make the world were living in swing Mame  
You make the old magnolia tree blossom at the mention of your name  
Your special fascinationll prove to be inspirational  
I think youre just sensational Mame
