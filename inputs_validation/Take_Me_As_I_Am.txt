Woman you dont understand  
Oh Im just a man  
Baby thats all I am  
Thats all I have ever been  
And you you dont understand  
Oh Ive gotta live  
  
You make it so hard to do  
You know you hurt me baby  
Take me take me as I am  
Take me as I am baby  
Oh oh take me as I am  
  
All I believe is that youve taken me  
For some kind of dream  
I dont want to wait too long  
For my love is in the way to see it  
I dont want to lose you baby  
But your love is in the way  
  
You gotta listen  
Its time to listen to me  
You you dont realize  
Oh Ive gotta live  
You make it so hard to bear  
It may be hard for me to go on  
  
And I know I know I know  
Youll understand  
Im just a man baby  
Thats all I am  
Dont make it hard on me  
  
Just take me take me as I am baby  
Take me as I am baby  
Take me as I am oh  
Take me as I am baby  
Oh take me as I am now
