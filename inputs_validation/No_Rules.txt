Dont give me your problems  
I got plenty of my own  
Everyday you come around here  
Giving me your own set of moans  
I dont want a situation  
Going nowhere I aint planned  
So you better listen here  
While I try and make you understand  
  
No rules no ties  
No rules no lies  
  
Take me as you see me  
Take me any way I am  
Im no victim man  
Ill just come and see you if I can  
I dont want no long term ties  
Fantasise twofaced lies no way  
So you better listen here  
While I try to make you understand  
  
Chorus
