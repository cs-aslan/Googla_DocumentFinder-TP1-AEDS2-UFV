I did my best to please you  
But my best was never good enough  
Somehow youre only able to see  
All I am not  
Did you ever look behind  
Arent you afraid of the pieces youll find  
I have failed you  
But you have failed me too  
Its so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
Do you ever wonder if its justified  
Its so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
In your life why didnt you ever try  
I close my eyes as I walk the thin line  
Between love and hate  
For the person with the same blood  
In his veins  
You show no regrets  
About all the things you did or said  
I have failed you  
But believe me you failed me too  
Its so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
Do you ever wonder if its justified  
Its so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
In your life why didnt you ever try  
Its so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
Do you ever wonder if its justified  
Its so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
Do you ever wonder if its justified
