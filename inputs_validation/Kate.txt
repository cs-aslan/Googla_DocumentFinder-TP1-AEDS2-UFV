She plays Wipeout on the drums  
The squirrels and the birds come  
Gather round to sing the guitar  
Oh IHave you got nothing to say  
  
When all words fail she speaks  
Her mix tapes a masterpiece  
Walks through the garden  
So the roses can see  
Oh IHave you got nothing to say  
  
And you can see the daisies in her footsteps  
Dandelions butterflies  
I wanna be Kate  
KateKateKate  
  
Everyday she wears the same thing  
I think she smokes pot  
Shes everything I want  
Shes everything Im not  
Oh IHave you got nothing to say  
  
She never gets wet  
She smiles and its a rainbow  
And she speaks  
And she breathes  
I wanna be Kate  
  
Down by Rosemary and Cameron  
She hands out the BhagavadGita  
I see her around every couple days  
I wanna meet her so I can sayhey Kate  
  
ooh la la la  
ooh la la la  
ooh la la la la  
  
She never gets wet  
She smiles and its a rainbow  
You can see  
I wanna wanna wanna be Kate  
KateKateKate  
Na Na Kate  
KateKateKate  
Na Na Na Na Na Na
