Theres a time when the heart can no longer give in  
You try to stand up and fight  
Youve known pain for so long and you know whats gone wrong  
But you cant make it right  
Another broken heart is all youre feeling  
How can you go on  
But the memories of the times there was love in your eyes  
Keep leading me on  
Chorus  
If it were you  
Would you hold on and hope that it might  
Bring back the dreams we once knew  
Or just give up forever that part of your life  
Tell me what would you do  
If it were you  
You can never take back all youve given in love  
No matter how hard you try  
Once its over and done you just have to let go  
Though a part of you died  
Another waste of time is all thats left now  
But life must go on  
All the nights that we spent never thought they would end  
Why cant they go on  
Chorus  
If it were you  
Would you hold on and hope that it might  
Bring back the love we once knew  
Or just give up forever that part of your life  
Tell me what would you do  
If it were you  
If it were you  
Tell me what would you do  
If it were you  
Over and over I go back through time  
Didnt we promise our love till we die  
Asking you deep down inside  
Did we really try  
Another broken heart is all thats left  
But life must go on  
All the nights that we spent never thought they would end  
Why cant they go on  
Chorus
