Every time I leave  
You say you wont be there  
And youre always there  
Every time I cry your name at night  
You pull close and say its alright  
I look in your eyes just like the rain  
Washing me rain wash over me  
Touching your face I feel the heat of your heartbeat  
Echo in my head like a scream  
What you do to me  
Waited so long I cant wait another day without you  
  
Jet City Woman  
Its a long way home to my  
Jet City Woman  
I see her face everywhere cant get her out of my mind  
  
Whenever Im alone Im thinking  
Theres a part missing from my life  
Wonder where Id be without your love  
Holding me together now Im  
Watching the time tick tick away  
Face grows longer every day  
Fortunes are lost on the women Ive seen  
But without you I cant breathe  
Youre the air to me  
Waited so long I cant wait another day without you  
  
Jet City woman  
Got to find my way home to her  
Jet City Woman  
I see her face everywhere I look  
Jet City Woman  
Just a thousand miles and Ill be there  
Jet City Woman to make the clouds go away  
Time for some blue sky  
  
Waited so long now the planes delayed  
An hour reminds me of all our days apart  
Hold on just a little longer  
  
Jet City woman  
Wonder where Id be youre the air to me  
Jet City Woman  
Eyes like the rain rain down on me  
Jet City woman  
No more nights alone  
Im almost home now  
Jet City Woman  
Close my eyes Im there in my Jet City
