Ive been kicked right down  
Ive been spat in the face  
Ive been pulled weighed down  
To the lowest place  
Ive been lied to shamed  
I have been disgraced  
Been excommunicated from every holy place  
Ive been beat up and robbed  
Ive been left for dead  
For the way I look  
For the things I said  
  
When trouble thinks its found us  
The world falls down around us  
I promise baby you wont ever  
You wont ever feel a thing  
  
Chorus  
Cause I will take it on the chin  
Eh for you  
So lay your cuts and bruises over my skin  
I promise you wont feel a thing no  
Cause everything the world could throw  
Ill stand in front Ill take the blow for you  
For you  
  
Ive been cleared on the street  
Ive been left in the cold  
Had my dreams held up  
Had them shot full of holes  
Ive been laughed at burnt beat and butt of the joke  
Ive been lit up in flames  
I have gone down in smoke  
Ive been stabbed in the back  
While they promised the earth  
Tried to keep my head high  
For all I am worth  
  
Outside our double glazing  
I know a war is raging  
I promise baby you wont ever  
You wont ever feel a thing  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah  
And if I fall here  
At least you know my dear that I would die for you  
Promise you wont ever feel a thing  
And if I fall here  
At least you know my dear that I would die for you  
Promise you wont ever feel a thing  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah everything the world could throw  
Ill take the sticks Ill take the stones for you  
For you
