And Ill coming to say goodbye  
Took inside and maids by buckbye  
More than dreams and the bottom come  
When she would come back right and well  
  
And if you catch me Ill take your time  
Ride on home in Mondays own  
Of this coldness in my heart  
And this whole world riding home  
  
Sweet baby jane sweet baby jane  
Sweet baby jane sweet baby jane  
  
And if you call Ill come running  
And if you ask I will be given  
And if you need me I will be there  
When you rush when the feelings gone  
Ill give you hope Ill give you hate  
By the burdens own by the sun but it burns on
