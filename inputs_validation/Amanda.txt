Ive held it all inward God knows Ive tried  
But its an awful awakening in a country boys life  
To look in the mirror in total surprise  
At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes  
  
Amanda light of my life  
Fate should have made you a gentlemans wife  
Amanda light of my life  
Fate should have made you a gentlemans wife  
  
Its a measure of people who dont understand  
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band  
I got my first guitar when I was fourteen  
Well I finally made forty still wearing jeans  
  
Amanda light of my life  
Fate should have made you a gentlemans wife  
Amanda light of my life  
Fate should have made you a gentlemans wife
