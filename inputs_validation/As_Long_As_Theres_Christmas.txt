Dont look inside a stocking  
Dont look under the tree  
The one thing were looking for  
Is something we cant see  
Far more precious than silver  
And more splendid than gold  
Is something to treasure  
But is something we cant hold  
  
As long as theres Christmas  
I truly believe  
That hope is the greatest of the gifts  
Well receive well receive  
  
As we all pray together  
Its the time to rejoice  
And though we may look different  
We are singing with one voice  
  
As Long As theres Christmas  
I truly believe  
That hope is the greatest of the gifts  
Well recieve  
  
There is more so much more  
To this time of year to this time of year  
Than sleigh bells and holly  
Mistletoes and snow  
Those things will come and go  
Come and goooo  
  
As long as there is Christmas  
I truly do believe that  
Hope is the greatest of the gifts  
We will receive well receive  
  
As Long As theres Christmas  
I truly believe I truly believe  
That hope is the greatest of the gifts  
Well recieve  
  
That Hope Is the Greatest gift well receive
