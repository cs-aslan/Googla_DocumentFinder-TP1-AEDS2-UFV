If we fuss and we fight  
Why do we have to do it every Saturday night  
We can act for our friends  
But why cant we face each other when the masquerade ends  
Well now I dont know whats happening  
I cant tell just whos to blame  
But two forgiving people  
Could be so in love again  
  
Stop Were breakin up a happy home  
Oh darlin  
Stop Cause I never was much good alone  
Sweet baby  
Oh dont turn your back and walk away  
Dont do it no  
Stop Were breakin up a happy home yeah  
  
Its a game noone wins  
Trying to hurt each other with those needles and pins  
I cant go back cant go on  
But somehow I know the feeling isnt totally gone  
Oh theres so much love between us  
That were so afraid to show  
Its been keeping us together  
But for how long I dont know  
  
Stop Yeah were breakin up a happy home  
Oh darlin  
Stop I never was much good alone  
Listen baby  
Ooh dont no turn your back and walk away  
Dont do it oh stop  
Stop Were breakin up a happy home yeah  
  
Ooh  
Stop Stop Dont break it up  
Stop Stop Dont break it up  
Gotta be another way we can try  
Stop Stop Dont break it up  
Stop Stop Dont break it up  
I dont want to hear you saying goodbye  
Oh baby sweet baby ahh yeah baby ooh baby
