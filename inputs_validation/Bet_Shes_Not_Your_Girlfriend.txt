Whisper round the town  
Cause youre my friend and thats the end  
For youre the only one in town  
Who they will beg to hang around with  
Youre so beautiful and calm  
But with an attitude that says  
Handsoff youre just not good enough  
  
Every boy and man feeling lonely  
Cant understand why youd be with me  
Furthermore we laugh and we draw  
More attention everyday so they say  
  
Girlfriend Bet shes not your girlfriend oh no  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend You better make her happy  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend Bet shes not your girlfriend oh no  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend You better make her happy  
  
Well that says maybe in a way but its okay  
We are touching while they stare in front of us  
They draw away as if to say  
Who are these people anyway  
How dare they confront us  
  
Every boy and man feeling lonely  
Cant understand why youd be with me  
Furthermore we laugh and we draw  
More attention everyday so they say  
  
Girlfriend Bet shes not your girlfriend oh no  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend You better make her happy  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend Bet shes not your girlfriend oh no  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend You better make her happy  
  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Girlfriend Oh oh oh Girlfriend  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend oh oh oh Girlfriend  
  
Id rather die than satisfy their curiosity  
Im kind of shy and dry and verging on ugly  
They wonder what that I have got that they have not  
Theyll never understand that none of that matters  
  
Every boy and man feeling lonely  
Cant understand why youd be with me  
Furthermore we laugh and we draw  
More attention everyday so they say  
  
Girlfriend Bet shes not your girlfriend oh no  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend You better make her happy  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend Bet shes not your girlfriend oh no  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend You better make her happy  
  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend Oh oh oh Girlfriend  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend  
Bet shes not your bet shes not your  
Bet shes not yourbet shes not your  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend  
Bet shes not your girlfriend oh no  
  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend Bet shes not your girlfriend  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend You better make her happy  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend Bet shes not your girlfriend  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend You better make her happy  
  
Bet shes not your girlfriend
