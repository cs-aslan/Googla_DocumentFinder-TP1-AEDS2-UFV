I love you because you understand dear  
Every little thing I try to do  
Your always there to lend a helping hand dear  
But most of all I love you cause youre you  
  
No matter what may be the style or season  
I know your love will always see me through  
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons  
But most of all I love you cause youre you  
Most of most of all I love you because youre you  
  
I love you because my heart is lighter  
Every time Im walking by your side  
I love you because the futures brighter  
The glow to happiness youve opened wide  
  
No matter what the world may say about me  
I know your heart will always be true  
I love you for the way you never doubt me  
But most of all I love you cause youre you
