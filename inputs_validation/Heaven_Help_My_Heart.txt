If it were love  
I would give that love  
Every second I had  
And I do  
  
Did I know where hed lead me to  
Did I plan  
Doing all of this  
For the love of a man  
  
Well I let it happen anyhow  
And what Im feeling now  
Has no easy explanation  
Reason plays no part  
  
Heaven help my heart  
  
I love him too much is  
What if he das my whole existence  
Turning around a word a smile  
  
One of these days  
And it wont be long  
Hell know more about me  
Than he should  
All my dreams will be understood  
  
No surprise  
Nothing more to learn  
From the look in my eyes  
Dont you know that time is not my friend  
Ill fight it to the end  
Hoping to keep that best of moments  
When the passions start  
  
Heaven help my heart  
  
The day that I find  
Suddenly Ive run out of secrets  
Suddenly Im not always on his mind  
  
Maybe its best to love a stranger  
Well  
Thats what Ive done  
Heaven help my heart  
  
Heaven help my heart
