Red wine and sleeping pills  
Help me get back to your arms  
Cheap sex and sad films  
Help me get where I belong  
I think youre crazy maybe  
I think youre crazy maybe  
Stop sending letters  
Letters always get burned  
Its not like the movies  
They fed us on little white lies  
I think youre crazy maybe  
I think youre crazy maybe  
I will see you in the next life  
Beautiful angel  
Pulled apart at birth  
Limbless and helpless  
I cant even recognize you  
I think youre crazy maybe  
I think youre crazy maybe  
I think youre crazy maybe  
I think youre crazy maybe  
I think youre crazy maybe  
I think youre crazy maybe  
I will see you in the next life
