I was hanging with the fellas  
Saw you with your new boyfriend it made me jealous  
I was hoping that Id never see you with him  
But its all good cause Im glad that I met him  
Cause now I know the competitions very slim to none  
And I can tell by looking that hes not the one  
Hes not the type you said you liked  
His style is wack clothes are bad  
Come on girl let him go  
I want you back  
  
Call me a hater if you want to  
But I only hate on him cause I want you  
Say Im trippin if you feel like  
But you without me aint right  
You can say Im crazy if you want to  
Thats true Im crazy bout you  
You could say Im breakin down inside  
Cause I cant see you with another guy  
  
Chorus  
It makes me ill  
To see you give  
Love and attention at his will  
And you cant imagine how it makes me feel  
To see you with him  
Oh it makes me ill  
To see you give  
Love and attention at his will  
And you cant imagine how it makes me feel  
To see you with him  
  
Girl I know that we broke up  
But that doesnt mean you should give the cold shoulder  
Cause you know that I truly do adore ya  
And that other guy cant do nothin for ya  
See  
I can tell that you dont really love that guy  
But theres no need for you to go and waste your time  
I think you know I love ya more  
Girl you gotta let him go  
I want you so just give him the boot  
  
Call me a hater if you want to  
But I only hate on him cause I want you  
You can say Im trippin if you feel like  
But you without me aint right  
You can say Im crazy if you want to  
Thats true Im crazy bout you  
You could say Im breakin down inside  
Cause I cant see you with another guy  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh  
It makes me ill cause you used to be my girl  
Used to be my girl Used to be my girl yeah  
It makes me ill oh cause you used to be my girl cmon  
My girl  
So baby come back to me baby  
  
It makes me ill  
To see you give  
Love and attention at his will at his will  
And you cant imagine how it makes me feel  
To see you with him when I see you with him  
Oh it makes me ill baby Im jealous  
To see you give  
Love and attention at his will at his will  
And you cant imagine how it makes me feel  
To see you with him  
  
Oh it makes me ill  
To see you give  
Love and attention at his will  
And you cant imagine how it makes me feel  
To see you with him you cant imagine how it makes me feel
