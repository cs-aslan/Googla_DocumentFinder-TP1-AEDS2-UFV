I got shot through a space not long ago  
I thought I knew the place so well  
It wasnt the same now it goes to show  
Sometime you never can tell  
  
Im lookin high and low dont know where to go  
I got to double back my friend  
The only way to find what I left behind  
I got to double back again double back again  
  
You know Im movin on in this fine machine  
Rollin on through the night  
Seein things like Ive never seen  
And its taking me outta sight  
  
Lookin high and low dont know where to go  
I got to double back my friend  
The only way to find what I left behind  
I got to double back again double back again  
  
Its got me up and down  
I been lost and found  
Down in a deep dark hole  
Looks like my luck has changed  
I been rearranged  
And Im coming out on a roll  
  
Lookin high and low dont know where to go  
I got to double back my friend  
The only way to find what I left behind  
I got to double back again double back again
