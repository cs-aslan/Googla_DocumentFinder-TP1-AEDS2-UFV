Theres a rich girl  
You know youve gone too far  
And you know it dont matter anyway  
You can rely on your old mans money  
You can rely on your old mans money  
Its a bitch girl  
And youve gone too far  
And you know it dont matter anyway  
Money money  
Wont get you too far get you too far  
  
Dont you know dont you know  
That its wrong to take what is given you  
So far gone on your own  
And you can get along but you gotta be strong  
You can never be strong

So far gone on your own  
And you can get along but you gotta be strong  
You can never be strong
