Think of me sweet darlin  
When everything is going bad  
Think of me sweet darlin  
Every time youre feeling sad  
Think of me sweet darlin  
Every time you dont come  
Can you feel the fever  
  
Think of me sweet darlin  
Every time things get rough  
Think of me sweet darlin  
When the best just isnt enough  
Think of me sweet darlin  
Every time you dont come  
Can you feel the fever  
  
Cause nobody else is doing it whoa  
And nobody else is doing it no no  
Wheres the harmony Wheres the humanity  
Love was a little too scarce  
Hey hey ooh yeah  
  
I said I was going before it got away  
Shes been here a while  
Living in the guest room  
I guess she goes in style  
I said I was going before it got away  
But I just cant let her go  
Can you feel the fever  
  
Now I lay me down to sleep in this enemy bed  
Tomorrow morning I will wake up  
Hurting from the things weve said  
One thing leads to another  
But I guess you know about that  
Can you feel the fever  
  
Cause nobody else is doing it whoa  
And nobody else is doing it no  
Wheres the harmony Wheres the humanity  
Love was a little too scarce  
Hey hey ooh yeah  
  
Cause nobody else is doing it yeah  
No nobody else is doing it doing it are they now now now  
Wheres the harmony Wheres the new harmony  
Love it was a little too scarce  
Hey hey ooh yeah  
Take it  
  
Think of me sweet darlin  
Every time you dont come
