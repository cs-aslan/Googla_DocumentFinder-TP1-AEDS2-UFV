Say everybody  
And everyone  
Weve been waitin so very long  
To play some music  
And have some fun  
  
Bring some happiness to everyone  
Well come with us and try and learn  
Whats on your mind  
Open your ears and eyes and lets see what you can find  
Youre not so different I dont mean to be unkind  
Somethings unfolding if you really take the time  
  
So let the sun shine  
Its just begun  
Youve given all you could to anyone  
Well dont you lose it  
Dont run away  
Its getting stronger day after day  
  
Youre sittin there you say youre  
Waiting for the show  
And what you have and what you  
Hear is what you really want to know  
Youve only come here cause heres  
Nowhere else to go  
Were only sorry that we have  
To end the show  
  
Play some music  
Play some music  
Play some music

Play some music  
Play some music
