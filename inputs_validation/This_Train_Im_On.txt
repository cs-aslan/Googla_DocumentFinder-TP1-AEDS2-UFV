This train Im on is right on time  
In the mornin Ill be there  
Its been so long since I held her in my arms  
Im goin back where I belong  
Where a love will always keep me safe from harm  
This train Im on is right on time  
Now I know Im on my way  
I can hear that whistle blow all down the line  
And as the towns go rollin by  
I can almost smell the wind blow through the pines  
And theyll all be out to meet me  
Cause theres no place where they treat you quite so fine  
  
Well Ive been all around and I know theres no place better  
Sun is gonna shine again in my back door  
Each time the wheels go round  
Im closer to the one Ive waited for
