On the third floor of the hotel theres a pregnant Flamenco dancer  
In the bathtub with a razor and shes planning her great escape  
  
In a way shes giving up on herself whoooa  
Either way shes giving up some of herself whoooa  
  
In the backyard theres a small boy playing soldiers with an army ranger  
In the front room theres a mother to the small boy  
Shes a total stranger  
In a way shes giving up on herself whoooa  
Either way shes giving up some of herself whoooa  
  
Love is only what you give up  
Life isnt what you get  
Love wont always fill your cup  
But lifes when you start to live  
Lifes when you learn to give  
  
When I leave here Im going to go to the small boy  
And that flamenco dancer  
Leave the guitar and the spotlight Im gonna go home to my biggest fans  
  
In a way Im giving up some of myself whoooa  
In a way isnt that what its about whoooa  
  
In a way Im giving up some of myself whoooa  
Whoooa oh whoooa oh whoooa  
Isnt that what its about  
  
Oh whoooa oh whoooa whoooa no no noo  
Oh whoooa oh whoooa  
  
Isnt that what its about  
Oh whoooa oh whoooa  
Isnt that what its about
