Ive got a bike You can ride it if you like  
Its got a basket a bell that rings and  
Things to make it look good  
Id give it to you if I could but I borrowed it  
  
Youre the kind of girl that fits in with my world  
Ill give you anything evrything if you want things  
  
Ive got a cloak Its a bit of a joke  
Theres a tear up the front Its red and black  
Ive had it for months  
If you think it could look good then I guess it should  
  
Youre the kind of girl that fits in with my world  
Ill give you anything evrything if you want things  
  
I know a mouse and he hasnt got a house  
I dont know why I call him Gerald  
Hes getting rather old but hes a good mouse  
  
Youre the kind of girl that fits in with my world  
Ill give you anything evrything if you want things  
  
Ive got a clan of gingerbread men  
Here a man there a man lots of gingerbread men  
Take a couple if you wish Theyre on the dish  
  
Youre the kind of girl that fits in with my world  
Ill give you anything evrything if you want things

Some rhyme some ching Most of them are clockwork  
Lets go into the other room and make them work
