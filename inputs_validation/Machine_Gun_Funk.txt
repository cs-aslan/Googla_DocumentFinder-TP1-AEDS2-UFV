So you wanna be hardcore  
With your hat to the back talkin bout the gats in your raps  
But I cant feel that hardcore appeal  
That youre screamin baby Im dreamin  
This aint Christopher Williams still some  
MCs got to feel one caps I got to peel some  
To let niggaz know that if you fuck with BigandHeavy  
I get up in that ass like a wedgie  
Says who Says me the lyrical  
Niggaz sayin Biggie off the street its a miracle  
Left the drugs alone took the thugs along with me  
Just for niggaz actin shifty  
Sticks and stones break bones but the gatll kill you quicker  
Especially when Im drunk off the liquor  
Smokin funk by the boxes packin glocks is  
Natural to eat you niggaz like chocolates  
The funk baby  
  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
  
All I want is bitches big booty bitches  
Used to sell crack so I could stack my riches  
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches  
From stayin in my business what is this Relentless  
Approach to know if Im broke or not  
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot  
Dont mean I dont tote the glock  
Sixteen shots for my niggaz in the pen  
Until we motherfuckin meet again  
Huh Im doin rhymes now fuck the crimes now  
Come on the ave Im real hard to find now  
Cause Im knee deep in the beats  
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the Mac10 by the seats  
For the jackers the jealous ass crackers in the car sirens  
Ill make you prove that its bulletproof  
Hold ya head cause when you hit the bricks  
I got gin mad blunts and bitches suckin dick  
The funk baby  
  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
  
So I guess you know the story the rapside crackside  
How I smoked funk smacked bitches on the backside  
BedStuy the place where my head rests  
Fifty shot clip if a nigga wan test  
The rocket launcher Biggie stomped ya  
High as a motherfuckin helicopter  
Thats why I pack a nina fuck a misdeameanor  
Beatin motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina  
Whats Love Got to Do  
When Im rippin all through your whole crew  
Strapped like bamboo but I dont sling guns  
I got bags of funk and its sellin by the tons  
Niggaz wanna know how I live the mack life  
Making money smoking mics like crack pipes  
Its type simple and plain to maintain  
I add a little funk to the brain  
The funk baby  
  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk  
I live for the funk Ill die for the funk
