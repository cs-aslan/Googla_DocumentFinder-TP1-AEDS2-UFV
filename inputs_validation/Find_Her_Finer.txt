Wrapped like a mummy till you finally unwind her  
Find her blinder see who designed her  
Act like a dummy till you finally grind her

And maybe you might think I am rude  
And maybe this approach I have spewed

As you impress her with your mind  
That you would just be left behind  
For a wiser fool
