Ah yeah Im glad I put this tape in

Look at the stars in the sky  
And drift off into the sweet memories that I have  
  
Of a love that my heart has been searching for  
For so long and I know somewhere  
If I keep searching that love Ill find  
The picture grows clearer and clearer  
  
From the back to the front of my mind  
And like love a love I know Ill have  
The girl that I want shell be mine shell be fly and itll last
