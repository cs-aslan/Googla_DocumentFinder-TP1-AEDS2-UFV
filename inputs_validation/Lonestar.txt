Lonestar where are you out tonight  
This feeling Im trying to fight  
Its dark and I think that I would  
Give anything  
For you to shine down on me  
  
How far you are I just dont know  
The distance Im willing to go  
I pick up a stone that I cast to the sky  
Hoping for some kind of sign  
  
Lonestar where are you out tonight  
This feeling Im trying to fight  
Its dark and I think that I would  
Give anything  
For you to shine down on me  
For you to shine down on me
