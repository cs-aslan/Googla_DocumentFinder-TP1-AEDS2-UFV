Im not afraid to show you who I am  
And I am not ashamed of my life  
Though Ive walked alone down this cold and soulless road  
Ive always felt you deep in my bones  
  
With every step I rise and fall  
With everything to gain I end up losing it all  
When the darkness gets in  
I scream out and your light sets me free  
  
Im not afraid of the past no more  
Im not afraid and Im bad for good  
I used to dance to the devils beat  
If I could bust into hell I would  
  
Im not afraid to shed all my skin  
Im not afraid of the faults you see  
Im tearing down these walls right now  
Theyre comin down cause I believe  
  
Your love is blind blind as a bat  
The way that youre leading me home like that  
Your love is blind blind as bat  
  
Im not afraid when they kick me down  
Im not afraid when I start to bleed  
Im not afraid if I live or die  
Im not afraid cause I believe  
  
Your love is blind blind as a bat  
The way that youre leading me home like that  
Your love is blind blind as bat  
  
And I wish that I could give you something in return  
For the precious time you wasted on the tears Ive never earned  
For reaching out to help me cross the bridges that I burned  
  
And in the end youll finally see  
That baby Ive done everything I possibly can  
I do it again cause know youre everything that I need  
  
Im not afraid of the the truth no more  
Im not afraid of the lies I hid  
Im not afraid of the past of my sins  
Cause I paid for the wrongs I did  
  
Im not afraid of the things you know  
Im just a book for the world to read  
My final words on the final page  
Will be amends cause I believe  
  
Your love is blind blind as a bat  
The way that youre leading me home like that  
Your love is blind blind as bat  
  
Your heart is kind mines painted black  
The way me forgive me and just take me back  
Your love is blind blind as bat  
  
Your love is blind blind as a bat  
The way that youre leading me home like that  
Your love is blind blind as bat  
  
Your heart is kind mines painted black  
The way me forgive me and just take me back  
Your love is blind blind as bat
