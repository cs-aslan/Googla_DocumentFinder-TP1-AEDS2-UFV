Tears fill up my eyes  
Im washed away with sorrow  
And somewhere in my mind  
I know theres no tomorrow  
  
I see that youre leaving soon  
I guess youve had your fill  
But if I cant change your mind then no one will  
  
And all throughout all the years  
Ive never strayed from you my dear  
You suspect Im somewhere else  
Youre feeling sorry for yourself  
  
Leaving with a broken heart  
I love you even still  
But if I cant change your mind then no one will  
If I cant change your mind  
  
Even though my heart keeps breaking  
Dont you know that Ill be waiting here for you  
I hope you see Im dedicated  
Look how long that I have waited  
If you come back you will find a different person  
If you change your mind  
  
How can I explain away somethin I havent done  
And if you cant trust in me now youll never trust in anyone  
With all the crazy doubts youve got  
I love you even still  
But if I cant change your mind then no one will  
If I cant change your mind  
If I cant change your mind  
Wish I could change your mind
