Did you do that girl that was in that soap  
 Did ya  
Will you save the whale  
Will you be Bob Hope Will ya  
Ill tell you about my Pepsi deal if you like  
A celebrity village bike with a mike  
I get more press when theres a war on  
  
Come sing a song with me  
A simple symphony  
Ill be a karaoke star  
Lush strings and Timpani  
Have got it in for me  
Look how Im dancinglove  
  
Justify what you get paidCan ya  
Doctors save lives and you get laid  
Dont ya  
Apologize for the job that you do  
It would be nice if you were talented too  
I think you better lock up your daughter  
  
Come sing a song with me  
My simple symphony  
Ill be a kareoke star  
Lush strings and Timpani  
Have got it in for me  
Look how Im dancinglove  
  
Instrumental
