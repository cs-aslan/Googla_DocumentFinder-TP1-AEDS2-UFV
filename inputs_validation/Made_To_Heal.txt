I gave up on you  
And your exercise  
And the world that I knew  
Then I fell back on you  
Cause I need more time  
And I need an excuse  
  
Im a thief a liar  
An angel in the fire  
Im a king a drug  
The push that comes to shove  
Im a freak a star  
Im everything you are  
Im your Jesus Im your pride  
  
Were made to heal  
  
I depend on you  
For the wings of life  
And the air that you move  
And I defended you  
For this one last time  
For the nerves you abuse  
  
Im a thief a liar  
An angel in the fire  
Im a king a drug  
The push that comes to shove  
Im a freak a star  
Im everything you are  
Im your Jesus Im your pride  
  
Were made to heal
