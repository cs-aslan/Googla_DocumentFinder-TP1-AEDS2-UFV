I try to keep you out of my heart  
But somehow I find  
Trying to keep you out of my heart  
Im out of my mind  
I tell myself Im through with you  
And Ill having nothing more to do with you  
I stay away but every day  
Im just foolin myself  
  
Tell my friends that I dont care  
I shrug my shoulders at the whole affair  
But all know it isnt so  
Im just foolin myself  
  
And every time I pass  
And see my face in a looking glass  
I tip my hat and say  
How do you do you fool  
Youre trowing your life away  
Im acting gay  
Im acting proud  
And every time I see you in a crowd  
I may pretend  
But in the end  
Im just fooling myself
