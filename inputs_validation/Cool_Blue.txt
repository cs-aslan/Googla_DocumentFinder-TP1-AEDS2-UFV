Blue the color suits you cool blue  
How will you stay this way for ever  
Blue again its a lasting chill  
To keep you cold as winter  
How can I forget you  
Im never gonna give you up up I said  
How can I forget you baby  
Im never gonna give you up up I said  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
Blue the color fools you cool blue  
Ill never stay away for ever  
How can I forget you  
Im never gonna give you up up I said  
How can I forget you baby  
Im never gonna give you up up I said  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
How could she fall for a boy like that  
How could she fall for a boy like that  
How could she fall for a boy like that  
How could she fall for a boy like that  
Blue the color suits you cool blue  
Blue the color fools you blue again  
Blue cool blue  
How will you stay this way for ever  
How can I forget you baby  
Im never gonna give you up up I said  
How can I forget you baby  
Im never gonna give you up up I said  
How can I forget you baby  
Im never gonna give you up up I said  
How can I forget you baby
