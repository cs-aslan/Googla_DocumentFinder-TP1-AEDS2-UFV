Ill take the legs from some old table  
Ill take the arms from some old chair  
Ill take the neck from some old bottle  
  
And from a horse Ill take the hair  
Ill take the hands and face from some old clock  
And baby when Im through  
Ill get more loving from the dumbdumbdummy  
Than I ever got from you  
Get me some legs get me a chair  
And a bottle too  
Give a horse give me some time  
And baby when Im through  
  
Ill take the legs from some old table  
Ill take the arms from some old chair  
Ill take the neck from some old bottle  
  
And from a horse Ill take the hair  
Ill take the hands and face from some old clock  
And baby when Im through  
Ill get more loving from the dumbdumbdummy  
Than I ever got from you  
I get more loving from the dumbdumbdummy  
Than I ever got from you  
Yeah Mama get more loving  
From a dummy than I get from you
