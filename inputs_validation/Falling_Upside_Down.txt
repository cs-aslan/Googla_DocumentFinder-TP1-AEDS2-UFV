Theres no gravity up here  
Its kind of hard to explain  
Every time Im holding you  
Its like backwards rain yeah  
  
You lift me up like a kite on a string  
Like a bird on newfound wings  
So high on you Im floating and  
Flying around  
Your loves like fallin upside down  
  
Youve got me so lightheaded  
Its a dizzy mood  
Spinning uncontrollably  
And gaining altitude  
  
You lift me up like a kite on a string  
Like a bird on newfound wings  
So high on you Im floating and  
Flying around  
Your loves like fallin upside down  
  
Look at me  
Used to be I could keep my feet  
On the ground  
When you said you could take  
Me higher  
You werent playing around  
You werent playing around  
  
You lift me up like a kite on a string  
Like a bird on newfound wings  
So high on you Im floating and  
Flying around  
Your loves like fallin upside down
