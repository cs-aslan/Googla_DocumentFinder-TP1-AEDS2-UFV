ChorusRepeat x2  
Are you a killer What it is  
Oh yeah what it is  
Drug dealer what it is  
Young player ridings hard  
I just wanna sit up in the air  
Get high I just wanna be up in the air

Aint coming down why  
Up here dammit where  
Aint coming down please  
Bubbilish coat twenty sixs in the town  
Im a killer too  
Killing bitches in town  
Chevy with the beat down  
Make you spin around  
I could fishtail  
Off Fishdale  
Ask the niggas over there  
If Im the shit there  
I dont tolerate  
My impala grape  
Bring the top out  
Bet I discombobulate  
Im a tough nigga  
You a fuck nigga  
See me in the club all prodded up nigga  
I got a semi too  
My whole penny do  
I got diamonds earned like Winnie Pooh  
Given talapia  
And caviar for dinner too  
Mafia as a mother fucker  
Dont make me have to get at you  
I throw a hundred shots  
Plus fiftytwo  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
My car actually  
Willy Wonka factory  
Ice look like raspberry  
These hoes tryna tackle me  
Nigga Im a killer I suggest you dont come after me  
Bitch Ill be in Collipark  
Plus Ill on Mcafee  
Bankhead faculty  
Boy you need to rap with me  
Come and talk to me  
Before I open up your cavity  
Shots come rapidly  
I told you not to mess with me  
I dont play with little boys  
You trying to Michael Jackson me  
Know a nigga ride in the air fantastically  
Till their daddy kill somethin else  
I put my rims up  
Actually car flop purple when the sun come  
When it get dark that thing  
Itll look Dro won  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
Mink coat  
Shit polar bear  
Hoes over here  
Hoes over there  
Im about to take flight  
Im goin in the air  
Candy with the gloss  
Im about to lift it off  
Cant you see someone on me you dont like  
And then lick it out  
We dont need to look at a town  
We rip em off  
My wrist forty  
Forget how much tip costs  
Buy a hundred k I dont wanna play  
Young Dro rides tall on a summer day  
Selling dope it be junkies where my mamas day  
Bad hoes get treated like runaways  
Bitch you need to go home cool out and smoke a blunt today  
Go and say how my cutlass look like egg yolk  
I keep two with me all in the bed though  
My money fed though  
Its Grand Hustle bread boy  
We got twenty eight inches in the air  
What you scared for  
  
ChorusRepeat x2
