Say you want to rip it up  
Paint the town red  
Wanna do the hot spots  
Get it in the head  
You drive me crazy  
I know your game  
You done it all before  
Youll do it all again  
  
You say yes I say no  
  
My bloods on fire  
I grit my teeth  
Youre nothin but a teaser  
Gimme some relief  
Im lookin at the bottle  
Sinkin to the floor  
I gotta white knuckles  
Cant take it anymore  
  
You say yes I say no  
  
What do you treat me so  
What I do I do for you
