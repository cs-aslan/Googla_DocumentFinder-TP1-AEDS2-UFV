I flip the switch on my laser video  
And theres the man staring back at me  
He starts to speak in a voice so righteous  
About the sins of society  
  
Hes got answers to all my problems  
Says hell decide what I should hear and see  
I try to change to another station  
But all I get is more of his morality  
And morality yeah  
  
But I see the kids of a new generation  
And they wont stand for this mind control  
Theyre gonna change this world we live in  
Theyre gonna bring back the rock and roll  
  
So if I can Im gonna break from this prison  
Gonna get out and join in the fight  
Take a chance on what I believe in  
Win or lose I know its right  
  
Cause its high time  
For us to start a revolution  
High time  
Just like an Abomb explosion  
High time  
It aint the music thats in question  
High time  
Its more the freedom of expression
