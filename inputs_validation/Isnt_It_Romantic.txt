Ive never met you yet never doubt you  
I cant forget you  
Ive thought you out dear  
I know your profile and I know the way you kiss  
Just the thing I miss  
On a night like this  
If dreams are made of imagination  
Im not afraid of my own creation  
With all my heart my heart is here for you to take  
Why should I quake  
Im not awake  
Isnt it romantic  
Music in the night a dream that can be heard  
Isnt it romantic  
Moving shadows write the oldest magic word  
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above  
While all the world is saying you were meant for love  
Isnt it romantic  
Merely to be young on such a night as this  
Isnt it romantic  
Every note thats sung is like a lovers kiss  
Sweet symbols in the moonlight  
Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance  
Isnt it romance  
  
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above  
While all the world is saying you were meant for love  
Isnt it romantic  
Merely to be young on such a night as this  
Isnt it romantic  
Every note thats sung is like a lovers kiss  
Sweet symbols in the moonlight  
Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance  
Isnt it romance  
Isnt it romance  
Isnt it romance
