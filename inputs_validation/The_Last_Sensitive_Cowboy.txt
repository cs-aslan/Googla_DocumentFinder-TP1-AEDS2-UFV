When you hear that Im a cowboy  
And I work the cattle trail  
You probably assume Im big and tough big and tough  
But the trails worn me down  
I dont wanna hang around  
Ive just about had enough had enough  
Ya see I like a nice cup of Espresso  
And I like to read my People magazine  
I coordinate my chaps  
But everybody laughs  
And say they dont like that shade of green  
Oh no its true  
Im a sensitive cowboy and I dont know what to do  
Oh no its kinda strange  
Im the last sensitive cowboy on the range  
Well I try to eat a healthy balanced diet  
But they all eat their brown beans from the can  
They all have to smoke about 6 packs a day  
Youd think they was the Marlboro man  
And they dont like to go to see the opera  
On Friday nights when they get paid  
And they dont help me bring in the hanging plants  
Every time theres a Native American raid  
Oh no its true  
Im a sensitive cowboy and I dont know what to do  
Oh no its kinda strange  
Im the last sensitive cowboy on the range  
Cowboy life sure is different these days  
Why brand your cattle when you can just use bovine psychology  
Why have a gunfight when there are so many good paralegals out there  
Nobody drinks in bushwhacks anymore Besides were all switching  
Over to equalsalt produced tofu jerkey And if youre gonna ride off  
Into the sunset make sure youre using an effective sunblock  
Oh no its true  
Im a sensitive cowboy and I dont know what to do  
Oh no its kinda strange  
Im the last sensitive cowboy on  
Oh no its true  
Im a sensitive cowboy and I dont know what to do  
Oh no its kinda strange  
Im the last sensitive cowboy on the range
