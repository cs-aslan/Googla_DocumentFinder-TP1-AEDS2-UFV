Lady when youre with me Im smiling  
Give me all your love  
Your hands build me up when Im sinking  
Touch me and my troubles all fade  
  
Lady from the moment I saw you standing all alone  
You gave all the love that I needed  
Shes so shy like a child who has grown  
Youre my  
  
Lady of the morning  
Love shines in your eyes  
Sparkling clear and lovely  
Youre my lady  
  
Lady turn me on when Im lonely  
Show me all your charms  
Evenings when you lay down beside me  
Just take me gently into your arms  
Youre my  
  
Lady of the morning  
Love shines in your eyes  
Sparkling clear and lovely  
Youre my lady
