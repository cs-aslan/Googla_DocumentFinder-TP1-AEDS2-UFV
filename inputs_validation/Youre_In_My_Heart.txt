Do you remember the first time you fell in love  
The way it felt the way it feels  
Being able to say from the bottom of your heart  
I love you for real  
Your eyes meet you feel your heartbeat  
Palms are sweaty you cant keep still  
And when you finally touch em and hug em and kiss em  
Oh what a thrill  
You was always searching and finally your dream came true  
They came strolling along  
And you promised em straight up and down sweetheart  
I swear Ill never do you wrong  
Hand in hand heart to heart  
Nothing in the world could separate the two  
And even though youve only known that person for a short time  
You tell em I love you youre my heart  
  
You argue witcha parents and they argue BACK  
Youre too young to be so serious  
You tell em thats not true Ill go on without you  
And walk away aggravated and furious  
You want em to approve but then again it dont matter  
The relationships yours  
You feel youre maturing and hey  
You can fight your own battles and wars  
You discuss it with your love and its the same for them  
So the two of you decide were gonna weather the storm  
Life is sweet kissing caressing and hugging  
And keeping each other warm  
But now comes the serious part cause love  
Believe me it aint a easy task  
Wed have one argument too many  
And youd have to ask am I still your heart  
  
Am I still your heart or is something pulling us apart  
Cause baby if it is please let me know what  
You run out the door I tell you come back  
I love you you shout out so what  
How could you hurt me How could you treat me  
Like you never loved me were you playing a game  
And if so I only have one request sit down and explain  
To me the person who treated you right did you right  
And held you tight every night  
Is there another lover in your life that has you uptight  
Cause if it is aw baby please dont do this to me  
Im trying to reach you trying to talk to you  
Its killing me cause youre my heart  
Thats right I admit it  
  
Youre my heart I refuse to let you go  
I struggle and fight for you against all odds  
Get down on my knees and pray to God  
That our love is in the cards  
Cause I know youre right for me  
And I know Im right for you  
Theres no way in the world Ill let you slip out of my hands  
People say forget about it move on  
But see they dont understand  
Youre nothing to them but youre so much to me  
So much in fact that Id give my life  
To stare into your eyes and caress your face  
As the priest announces us man and wife  
Wed live happily ever after  
White picket fence and the whole nine yards  
And anything that anybody said  
Id disregard if I was still your heart  
  
So make up your mind cause Ive made up my mind  
Im begging you baby please come back home  
Ill be tossing and turning as I lay in my bed  
Sorrow surrounds me I can feel it in my bones  
This cant be true Im losing you  
Oh Lord have mercy please make it alright  
All I wanna do in this whole wide world is hold you tight  
Ive ripped open my heart shed tears and cried  
Now its up to you baby please understand  
I forgive you for everything and give you anything  
Just let me take ya by the hand  
And lead ya baby I got ya  
Protect you like a mother protects a child  
Now its up to you Ima call you in a little while  
Youre my heart
