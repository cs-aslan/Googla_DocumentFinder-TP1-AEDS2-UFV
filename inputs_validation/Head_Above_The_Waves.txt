You quit the band and got a job  
Decided to take a wife  
Then you stood still  
And I went on  
  
And almost lost my life  
No I dont want to be in your shoes  
And I dont want to read local news  
And though I know we had the same views  
  
Whos the fool  
Try and keep your head above the waves  
Try and tell yourself that youre safe  
I know you do your best to keep faith  
  
So round and round we go  
Its a shame  
Oh but you never know  
There you go praised again  
  
Your head pressed against the glass  
You always tried to put me down  
But I knew that it couldnt last  
Cause I dont want to be in your shoes  
  
And I dont want to read local news  
And though I know we had the same views  
Whos the fool  
Try n keep your head above the waves  
  
Try and tell yourself that youre safe  
I know you do your best to keep faith  
So try and keep your head above the waves  
Oh feels so good  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I knew it would  
Oh it just dont mean that much anymore oh
