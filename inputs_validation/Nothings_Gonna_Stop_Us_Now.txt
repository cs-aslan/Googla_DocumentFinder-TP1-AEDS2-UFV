Looking in your eyes I see a paradise  
This world that Ive found  
Is too good to be true  
Standing here beside you  
Want so much to give you  
This love in my heart that Im feeling for you  
  
Let em say were crazy I dont care about that  
Put your hand in my hand baby  
Dont ever look back  
Let the world around us just fall apart  
Baby we can make it if were heart to heart  
  
And we can build this dream together  
Standing strong forever  
Nothings gonna stop us now  
And if this world runs out of lovers  
Well still have each other  
Nothings gonna stop us nothings gonna stop us now  
  
Im so glad I found you  
Im not gonna lose you  
Whatever it takes I will stay here with you  
Take it to the good times  
See it through the bad times  
Whatever it takes is what Im gonna do  
  
Let em say were crazy what do they know  
Put your arms around me baby  
Dont ever let go  
Let the world around us just fall apart  
Baby we can make it if were heart to heart  
  
And we can build this dream together  
Standing strong forever  
Nothings gonna stop us now  
And if this world runs out of lovers  
Well still have each other  
Nothings gonna stop us nothings gonna stop us  
  
Ooh all that I need is you  
All that I ever need  
And all that I want to do  
Is hold you forever ever and ever hey  
  
And we can build this dream together  
Standing strong forever  
Nothings gonna stop us now  
And if this world runs out of lovers  
Well still have each other  
Nothings gonna stop us  
Nothings gonna stop us whoa
