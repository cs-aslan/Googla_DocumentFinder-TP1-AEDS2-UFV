Dont you feel a change acoming  
From another side of time  
Breaking down the walls of silence  
Lifting shadows from your mind  
Placing back the missing mirrors  
That before you couldnt find  
Filling mysteries of emptiness  
That yesterday left behind  
  
Chorus  
And we all know its better  
Yesterday has passed  
Now lets all start the living  
For the one thats going to last  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont you feel the day is coming  
That will stay and remain  
When your children see  
The answers  
That you saw the same  
When the clouds have all gone  
There will be no more rain  
And all the beauty of all things  
Is uncovered again  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Dont you feel the day is coming  
And it wont be too soon  
When the people of the world  
Can all live in one room  
When we shake off the ancient  
Chains of our tomb  
We will all be born again  
Of the eternal womb  
  
Chorus x3
