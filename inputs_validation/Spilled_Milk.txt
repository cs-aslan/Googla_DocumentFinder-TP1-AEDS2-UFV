Well baby our love was born the moment that we met  
But early in the morning the grass is always wet  
So just like the dewdrops our love would fade away  
But how was I to know it couldnt last a day  
  
But now theres no use crying  
Theres no use crying over spilled milk  
No use crying theres no use crying over spilled milk  
  
I know just what went wrong the cards I didnt play  
If my game was strong shed still be mine today  
But losing aint my name although I not the same  
I aint gonna be no fool put myuself to shame  
  
Cause theres no use crying  
Theres no use crying over spilled milk  
No use crying theres no use crying over spilled milk  
  
Were all washed up its true the rain came all to soon  
But Ill find someone new this wont be my ruin  
And if I play it smart on a brand new start  
I know just how to hold on to my new found heart  
  
And then theres no use crying  
Theres no use crying over spilled milk  
No use crying theres no use crying over spilled milk  
Spilled milk yeah spilled milk
