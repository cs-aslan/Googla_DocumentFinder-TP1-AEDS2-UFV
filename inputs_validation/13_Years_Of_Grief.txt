Youre so fuckin tough so motherfuckin bad  
13 years of grief is all your folks ever had  
Just an ignorant cunt talkin such shit  
Tryin to act like a man you little fuckin punk kid

Day of court day of fear in walks the judge  
Half a year nothing less no he wouldnt budge  
Hand over your belongings and your motherfuckin soul  
Thats the joy of life six months in the hole
