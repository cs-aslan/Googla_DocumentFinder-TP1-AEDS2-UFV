I got a cocaine woman and shes cookin up a pound of pills  
Another ride to the station and you know Im gonna pay the bills lord  
I gotta go see my baby  
Gotta run run run  
The only girl I loved  
Itll be the last one  
I know I know  
Shes hell on wheels  
I know how she feels boy  
  
I like the way that she moves when she moves me  
I like the way that she feels when she feels me  
She dont complain when I say that Im leavin  
Im in love  
  
I got a cyclone woman shes cookin up a pound of thrills  
Another night shes away couldnt take cause you know it kills  
I missed her for six days  
Cant wait to see that finelookin woman motherfuckin lyin next to me  
Shes hell on wheels  
I know how she feels boy  
  
I like the way that she moves when she moves me  
I like the way that she feels when she feels me  
She dont complain when I say that Im leavin  
Im in love  
  
I spent a lifetime finding you  
Oh my love  
And Id die a thousand times for you my love  
  
Yeah gotta run run run  
Oh shell be the last one  
I know I know
