I aint gonna lie  
I cant even count the days  
Or the many nights I tried living here alone  
A heart full of pride  
Couldnt see the enemy was me  
I was blind and thought my second chance was gone  
A ship without a sail  
Battered by the raging sea  
Taking any love I can to try and stop the rain  
While waiting to exhale I finally got on my knees  
I know its been a long time  
Do you still remember my name  
  
Can I go back in time  
Can I have another try  
But I cant change yesterday  
  
Chorus  
Oh I  
Cant take another day without you  
Cause this heart dont beat the same without you  
I forgot who I was  
Got caught up in this world  
Jesus I apologize  
I shouldve lost my mind without you  
Not another sleepless night without you Jesus  
Im sorry and Im asking please  
Make us how we used to be  
  
I try and try to keep my mind on you  
But trouble keeps calling me  
Every time a wound heals  
Something else takes the healing away  
But even when Ive gone too far  
You dont even call my name  
Mama said if you love let it go  
And if it comes back then its back to stay  
You already knew I belong to only you  
I run to your arms and say  
  
Chorus  
  
Never knew a life so cold  
Thought that things could fulfill my soul  
Tried to find love on my own  
It was hard to admit I was wrong  
No money no cars no fame no lies no games my life is taken  
  
Now weve come to the break  
Tell me what you gone say you gone say  
I know I know  
I give my life right  
But you know  
You aint promised tonight  
Babygirl  
Without you  
I cant breathe  
Without you  
I cant exist  
Without you  
This world aint got nothing for me  
Im coming home  
  
Chorus 2x
