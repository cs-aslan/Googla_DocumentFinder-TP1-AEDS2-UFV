I cant stand to watch the six oclock news  
Its enough to give an average sensitive person the blues  
Cant get it up  
I dont know about commercial appeal  
But what you put in your head  
Just cant help affect how you  
So lets keep it up  
Prophets of doom try to capture you  
They get around like the Asian flu  
But they cant get me  
  
Because I go for the up  
Im on the up side  
I look for the up That down just aint my style  
I go for the up  
Im hooked on the up  
Im on the upswing I got my sights set high  
I go for the up  
  
Whats the point of standing out in the rain  
Whats the sense of looking down  
It just gives your shoulders a pain  
Cant get it up  
Its a selffulfilling prophecy  
If you look for the worst then thats just  
What it turns out to be  
So keep looking up  
The fickle finger just may point your way  
It touches someone different every day  
But it cant touch me  
  
Because I go for the up  
And everybodys yelling at me to get back in line  
And they say Im crazy  
But still they have their sessions of deep depressions  
But it cant get me  
Because I go for the up
