Plans made in the nursery  
Can change the course of history  
Remember that  
  
Mummys annoyed says go and play  
Dont show your face  
Stay away all day  
Shouldnt have done that  
  
A small boy and his infantry  
Marching around so naturally  
Shouldnt have done that  
  
Grows up and goes to school  
Such a nice boy  
Obeys all the rules  
Mummys proud of that  
  
Leaves school to follow his ambition  
Knows what he wants  
To be a politician  
Shouldnt have done that
