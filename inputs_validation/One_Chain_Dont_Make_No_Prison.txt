Just because in a moment of madness  
I took advantage of your sweet love  
Dont just hand me a lifetime of sadness  
Cause theres so little of beauty  
  
Oh baby one chain dont make no prison  
Two wrongs dont make no right  
One rain dont make no river  
One punch dont make no fight  
  
Cant you spare me a little affection  
Would that be asking too much of you  
Dont point love in another direction  
I swear Ill make it all up to you  
  
Oh baby one chain dont make no prison  
Two wrongs dont make no right  
One rain dont make no river  
One punch dont make no fight  
  
Theres a bed Im keeping room in for you  
Theres a lot I know I gotta do  
Dont let as simple misunderstanding  
Be a mountain that we cant move  
  
Oh one chain dont make no prison  
Two wrongs dont make no right  
One rain dont make no river  
One punch dont make no fight  
  
One chain dont make no prison  
Two wrongs dont make no right  
One rain dont make no river  
One punch dont make no fight
