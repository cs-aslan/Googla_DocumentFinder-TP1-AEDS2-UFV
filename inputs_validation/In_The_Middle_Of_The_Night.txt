Ive been walking this road of desire  
Ive been begging for blood on the wall  
I dont care if Im playing with fire  
Im aware that Im frozen inside  
I have known all along  
  
So much more going on no denying  
But I know Im not standing alone  
  
Youve been playing my mind through my wishes  
You can feel that were haunting the truth  
Dont know I cant hold on always losing control  
  
In the middle of the night  
I dont understand whats going on  
Its a world gone astray  
In the middle of the night  
I cant let it out  
Someone keeps searching  
And shatters your life  
It will never be afraid  
In the middle of the night  
  
No more tears  
No cause nothing else matters  
Ive been closing my eyes for too long  
  
Only vengeance will make me feel better  
Theres no rest till I know that its done  
  
Youve been playing my mind through my wishes  
You can feel that were haunting the truth  
Dont know I cant hold on always losing control  
  
In the middle of the night  
I dont understand whats going on  
Its a world gone astray  
In the middle of the night  
I cant let it out  
Someone keeps searching  
And shatters your life  
It will never be afraid  
In the middle of the night  
  
In the middle of the night  
In the middle of the night  
  
In the middle of the night  
I dont understand whats going on  
Its a world gone astray  
In the middle of the night  
I cant let it out  
Someone keeps searching  
And shatters your life  
It will never be afraid  
In the middle of the night
