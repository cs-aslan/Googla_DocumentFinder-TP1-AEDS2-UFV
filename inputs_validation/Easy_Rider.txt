Well now come on easy rider  
Give me something  
For my pain  
Well now come on easy rider  
Though I know youre not to blame  
  
The dogs are out to get me  
And pull me down again  
  
Well now come on easy rider  
Turn this screaming fire  
Down low  
Yeah come on easy rider  
Pull this pain  
And let it go  
  
This time around  
Dont think that I can take it  
This twisting pain  
Ive come to know  
Easy rider  
Help me  
Easy rider
