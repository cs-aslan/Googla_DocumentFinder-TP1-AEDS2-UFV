Well I dont know how I found her  
Love works in mysterious ways  
Well I could hardly afford a cup of coffee back then  
Werent exactly my salad days  
She knew I was just pretending  
To be some kind of big shot  
It took her two hours to tell a little something about herself  
And thats when my heart stopped  
  
She was just enough Ashland City  
To want to watch the sun go down  
She was just enough small town girl  
To cook my supper in an evening gown  
But Lord didnt she look pretty  
Doin that shake and bake  
She was just enough Ashland City  
And buddy thats about all it takes  
  
A week later we got married  
Yeah I was gonna show her the world  
Cause I was Mr Sophisticated and she was just a country girl  
She wound up showing me everything  
Id ever been dreaming of  
Well I mightve known the way to San Jose  
But I didnt know a thing about love  
  
She was just enough Ashland City  
To want to put the ttop down  
Take a skinny dip in that old gravel pit  
About twenty miles out of town  
But Lord didnt she look pretty  
Swimming out of those bell bottom jeans  
She was just enough Ashland City  
And thats more than Id ever seen  
  
That was fifteen years ago  
Nothing much has changed  
Well I still try to play the big shot yeah and shes still dressing strange  
She still has a hard time  
Telling you about herself  
So let me tell you a little about the woman I love  
Cause buddy shes something else  
  
Shes just enough Ashland City  
To want to watch the sun go down  
Just enough small town shy  
To keep this ol boy hanging around  
Lord dont she look pretty  
In an evening gown or jeans  
Shes just enough ashland city  
Thats just enough woman for me
