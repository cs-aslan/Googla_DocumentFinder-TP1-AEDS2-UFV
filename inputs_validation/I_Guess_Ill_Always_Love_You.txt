I guess Ill always love you  
Youve got the love I need  
Youve got the love I need  
  
Open up your arms  
And let me walk on in  
Open up your heart  
And let me live again  
  
When you left you left with me  
A dream no longer reality  
I live the shadows of our past  
With this love thats born to last  
  
I guess Ill always love you  
Youve got the love I need  
Youve got the love I need  
  
The only time Im happy  
Is when youre on my mind  
Every day I live  
All my love I give  
  
Ive been a thousand places  
Seen your smile on a thousand faces  
No matter what I try to do  
Im always dreaming of you  
  
I guess Ill always love you  
Youve got the love I need  
Youve got the love I need  
  
Every boy that passes by  
I see your sparkle in his eye  
Right away I stop and stare  
Close my eyes and see you there  
  
Whenever I feel almost free  
Memories take hold of me  
I love you now so much more  
Than I ever did before  
  
I guess Ill always love you  
I guess Ill always love you  
I guess Ill always love you
