Intro  
Im sorry for everything  
Oh everything Ive done  
  
Verse 1  
Am I out of touch Am I out of my place  
When I keep sayin that Im lookin for an empty space  
Oh Im wishin youre here but Im wishin youre gone  
  
I cant have you and Im only gonna do you wrong  
Oh Im gonna mess this up oh this is just my luck  
Over and over and over again  
  
Chorus  
Im sorry for everything no everything Ive done  
From the second that I was born it seems I had a loaded gun  
And then I shot shot shot a hole through everything I loved  
Oh I shot shot shot a hole through every single thing that I loved  
  
Verse 2  
Am I out of luck Am I waiting to break  
When I keep sayin that Im lookin for a way to escape  
Oh Im wishin I had what Im takin for granted  
  
I cant have you and Im only gonna do you wrong  
Oh Im gonna mess this up oh this is just my luck  
Over and over and over again  
  
Chorus  
Im sorry for everything no everything Ive done  
From the second that I was born it seems I had a loaded gun  
And then I shot shot shot a hole through everything I loved  
Oh I shot shot shot a hole through every single thing that I loved  
  
Bridge  
In the mean time we let it go  
At the road sign we used to know  
We can let this drift away  
Oh we let this drift away  
At the bay side we used to shore  
In the moonlight we let it go  
We can let this drift away  
Oh we let this drift away  
Cause youve always got to change your mind  
Cause youve always got to change your mind  
Oh love can you hear me  
Oh let it drift away  
  
Chorus

Bridge

Cause youve always got to change your mind  
Oh love can you hear me  
Oh let it drift away
