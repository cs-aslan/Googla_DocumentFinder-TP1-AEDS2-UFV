Time will come when we know what happened here  
Change will come in time and make it clear  
We learn one thing if we learn at all  
In the secret wars we call our lives anything can happen  
We watch the days we make our plans  
We change in ways a life demands  
But whatever pleasure this life may allow  
Ill give you the love I have for you now  
Because anything can happen in a world so full of fear  
Dreams are whispered in the dead of night and people disappear  
But you hear my heart and you know Im still here  
Although you know and I know you know  
While I swear Ill never let you go anything can happen  
Yeah if this love can happen here  
Anything can  
We watch the days we make our plans  
We change in ways a life demands  
Ill always remember this time this place  
The hope in your voice the light on your face  
Because anything can happen in a world so full of pain  
People give their lives to making war and we call those people sane  
But I love you where your dreams remain  
Though you never say it anymore  
One day therell be an end to this war and who knows  
We may see what were here for anything can happen  
Yeah if this love has found us here  
Anything can it can happen  
Anything can anything can happen  
Anything anything anything anything
