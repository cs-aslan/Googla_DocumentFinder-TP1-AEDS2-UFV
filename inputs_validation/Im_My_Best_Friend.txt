Best friend

Mmmm  
When the moon came up  
And the sun went down  
All I could see was a national frown  
It was pounded from flesh  
And harder than steel  
Pretty in pink thats just how I feel  
Leave me alone cause Im my best friend  
  
If you wanna be with me Ill be there til the end  
Til the end of time and time again  
Just leave me alone cause Im my best friend  
Yeah yeah  
cause Im my best friend now  
cause Im my best friend now  
  
All I got is might and will  
If all I got is might and will  
Cant slow down cause down well go  
Where I step you dont wanna know  
Round round round well go  
Where I step is where I wanna go  
Go go go go  
Where I wanna be is where I wanna go  
Lofty thoughts high ideals  
Lofty skirts  
Is what appeals  
This baby is no Baby Ruth  
He was too smart for her  
She was so damned cute  
Im sick and tired cant be late  
Im so damn mad I cant keep straight  
Time and time and time again  
Leave me alone cause Im my best friend yeah  
Leave me alone cause Im my best friend yeah  
Im my best friend yeah  
Im my best friend yeah
