Celebrate dont be late  
Finish whats on your plate  
Be the change you wanna see  
Seek the truth set it free  
  
And I wanna tell you  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
  
Why does time move so fast  
Precious things never last  
Figure out dont forget  
Only love no regrets  
  
And I gotta tell you  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
  
All of the things you never noticed  
All of the lines you cling to that dont mean a thing  
All of the dates that you were late for  
All of the rounds you shouldve paid for  
  
And I wanna tell you  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder
