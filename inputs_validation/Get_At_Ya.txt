Where you going slow it  
Dont act like you dont see me  
Im glowing show me  
What you look like in the morning  
Tone it on it floating on 25s  
I wouldnt be fly if I threw some Ds on it  
  
When I step to the floor Im fresh low key  
When I step through the door all eyes on me  
Wanna be a star get on TV  
Its bout to jump off in my car so come with me  
Oh baby  
  
Chorus  
Hey girl I love what you do yeah  
The way ya making it move  
Im tryna give it to you oh  
Said girl tryna get at ya tryna  
Tryna get at ya  
You see me sitting on chrome  
And Im tryna get at ya  
Hey I want ya girl

Move oh you Im on ya  
Said girl tryna get at ya tryna  
Tryna get at ya hey hey hey hey  
You see me sitting on chrome  
And Im tryna get at ya  
  
Girl Im slowly approaching  
Dodging those misdemeanors  
They on it on it want it want it  
I know they waiting on me  
To run it run it

If you with it be a bad girl  
  
When I step to the floor Im fresh low key low key  
When I step through the door all eyes on me on me  
Wanna be a star get on TV  
Its bout to jump off in my car so come with me hey girl  
  
Chorus  
  
Chris Rap  
700 horsepower  
Speakers beating down the block  
Girls stop automatic static  
Better call the cops  
  
Bad chick looking like she finna let me grab it  
Im gonna have to snatch it  
But Im tryna get at ya  
200 miles per hour  
  
Speakers beating down the block  
Girls stop automatic static  
Better call the cops  
Bad chick looking like she finna let me grab it  
  
Im gonna have to snatch it  
But Im tryna get at ya  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat x 2  
Tryna give it to you  
Do you feel me girl  
Tryna give it to you  
Do you feel me girl  
Tryna give it to you  
Do you feel me girl  
Do you feel me girl  
Do you feel me girl
