Oh baby wont you please come home  
Cause your mamas all alone  
I have tried in vain  
Never no more to call your name  
  
When you left you broke my heart  
Because I never thought wed part  
Every hour in the day you will hear me say  
Baby wont you please come home  
  
When you left you broke my heart  
Because I never thought wed part  
Every hour in the day you will hear me say  
Oh baby my baby  
Baby wont you please come home  
Cause your mama needs some lovin  
Baby wont you please come on home
