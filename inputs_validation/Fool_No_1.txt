Am I fool number one or am I fool number two  
How many other girls have been fooled by you  
I suppose that the number is far from being small  
But Ill bet that Im the biggest fool of all  
  
If I had the chance I guess Id do it all again  
Id go down that same old road even knowing at the end  
Youd leave me when your heart hears a new love call  
So I guess that Im the biggest fool of all  
 piano   
Am I fool number one
