Been dazed and confused for so long  
Its not true  
Wanted a woman never bargained for you  
Lots of people talk and few of them know  
Soul of a woman was created below  
  
You hurt and abused telling all of your lies  
Run arounds sweet baby lord how they hypnotize  
Sweet little baby I dont know where youve been  
Gonna love you baby here I come again  
  
Every day I work so hard bringing home my hard earned pay  
Try to love you baby but you push me away  
Dont know where youre going only know just where youve been  
Sweet little baby I want you again  
  
Been dazed and confused for so long its not true  
Wanted a woman never bargained for you  
Take it easy baby let them say what they will  
Wont hurt so much when I send you the bill
