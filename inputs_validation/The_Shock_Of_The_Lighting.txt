Im over my hearts desire  
I feel cold but Im back in the fire  
Outta control but Im tied up tight  
Come in come out tonight  
  
Coming up in the early morning  
I feel love and the shock of the lightning  
Ill follow into the blinding light  
Come in come out come in come out tonight  
  
Love is a time machine  
Up on the silver screen  
Its all in my mind  
Love is a litany  
A magical mystery  
And all in good time  
And all in good time  
And all in good time  
  
Ive got my feet on the street but I cant stop flying  
My heads in the clouds but at least Im trying  
Im outta control but Im tied up tight  
Come in come out tonight  
  
Theres a hole in the ground into which Im falling  
So God speed to the sound of the pounding  
Im all in to the blinding light  
Come in come out come in come out tonight  
  
Love is a time machine  
Up on the silver screen  
Its all in my mind  
Love is a litany  
A magical mystery  
And all in good time  
And all in good time  
And all in good time  
  
Its all in my mind  
Love is a time machine  
Up on the silver screen  
And all in good time  
And all in good time  
And all in good time
