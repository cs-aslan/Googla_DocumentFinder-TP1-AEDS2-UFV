Backwoods killer from a river town  
A mixed up kid that let his hair hang down  
High school rebel hes always been bad  
And his poor old mans still wondring bout the lad  
But hes gone gone away to find his fortune  
  
Theres a longhaired lady lookin for a home  
With her young son hed left them both alone  
And his blackhaired lovers got a broken heart  
Cause her lonely boy just wont play the part  
Cause hes gone gone away to find his fortune  
  
And its been a long long way  
From that little town to LA  
And I cant turn around  
Ladies Im gone gone away to find my fortune  
  
A restless nature fed my crazy dreams  
So I packed my bags in a big limousine  
laughed at the people who were laughin at me  
Laughed and said Im gonna be what I be  
And Im gone gone away to find my fortune
