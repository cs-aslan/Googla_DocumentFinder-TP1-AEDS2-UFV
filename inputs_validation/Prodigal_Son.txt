Listen to me Lamia listen to what Ive got to say  
Ive got these feelings and they wont go away  
Ive got these fears inside thatll bring me to my knees  
Oh help me Lamia or Im sure Ill die oh please  
  
I feel unsettled now I know that Ive done wrong  
Ive messed around with mystic things and magic for too long  
I feel Im being paid with this nightmare inside me  
The devils got a hold on my soul and he just wont let me be  
  
Im on my knees oh help me please  
Im on my knees help me please  
  
Oh Lamia please try to help me  
The devils got a hold of my soul and he wont let me be  
Lamia Ive got this curse Im turning to bad  
The devils got a hold of my soul and its driving me mad Oh  
  
Oh Lamia please try to help me  
The devils got a hold of my soul and he wont let me be  
Lamia Ive got this curse Im turning to bad  
The devils got a hold of my soul and its driving me mad Oh
