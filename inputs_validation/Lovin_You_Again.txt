You call me from a phone booth with tears in your voice  
Tell me youve been out all night runnin with the boys  
You say youre cold and tired and lonely  
And you got no place to go  
There wasnt any phonebook  
Mines the only number that you know  
  
Well call yourself a taxi and Ill pay Im at the door  
If you dont mind sleepin on the sofa or on the floor  
And I spend an hour hatin you  
Til the cab pulls in  
My heart has found another way  
To be loving you again  
  
And every time is the last time  
And every time is the first  
Everytime is the last time with you  
Oh it never gets no better  
And it couldnt get no wore  
  
Then I hear the footsteps the drivers at the door  
He says I look familiar has he made this run before  
And I tell him I dont think so  
Whats it matter anyway  
Just tell me what the meter reads  
And Ill go and get your pay  
  
Well now its down to you and me though it dont seem right  
We both know where well be and what well do tonight  
And after an hour or two  
When the night comes to an end  
My heart has found another way  
To be lovin you again  
  
And every time is the last time  
And every time is the first  
Everytime is the last time with you  
Oh it never gets no better  
And it couldnt get no worse  
  
I know that there should be more to say Ill just reed your mind  
Lets save whats left unsaid for another time  
Cause I know therell be another time  
So until then  
My heart has found another way  
To be lovin you again  
My heart has found another way  
To be lovin you again  
Oh my heart has found another way  
To be lovin you again
