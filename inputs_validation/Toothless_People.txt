They only show you their gums when they smile  
Aint got a tooth in their heads now how vile  
Only can eat things like pudding and applesauce  
They never have to buy toothpicks or dental floss  
  
Hey stand up  
Toothless people their breath is lethal want to tell you  
Hey come on stand up get on your feet  
Toothless people old and feeble what I say  
  
No more of those pearly whites will they possess  
Their oral hygiene is frightful a mess  
Lots of em suffering from trench mouth and gum disease  
At least they dont have to worry bout cavities  
  
Hey stand up take out your teeth  
Toothless people old and feeble oh yes  
  
You can brush em you can floss em  
Theyre something you just cant ignore  
If you lose em youre in trouble  
Cause the tooth fairy wont come no more  
You need something to show your dentist  
The next time he makes you say Ah  
You dont want to have to wind up  
Eating all of your food through a straw  
  
Like toothless people toothless people  
Youd better brush your teeth now hey  
Toothless toothless toothless toothless people  
Hey stand up toothless people
