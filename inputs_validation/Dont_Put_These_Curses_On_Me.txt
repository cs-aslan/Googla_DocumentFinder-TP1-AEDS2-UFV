Dont put these curses on me oh no you dont  
Dont put these curses on  
Dont put these curses on me oh no you dont  
Dont put these curses on  
  
Dont curse me with the love of money  
It will burn me up and waste my time  
Dont curse me with the love of intellect  
You know it knots up my brain and makes me think that  
You know more than I do  
  
Dont put these curses on me oh no you dont  
Dont put these curses on  
Dont put these curses on me oh no you dont  
Dont put these curses on  
  
Dont curse me with the idea  
That work is good and holy  
It only took you to the grave with a bitter heart  
Dont curse me with this patriotic love  
Of parents ideas country and wife  
You invite war into your home  
  
Dont put these curses on me oh no you dont  
Dont put these curses on  
Dont put these curses on me oh no you dont  
Dont put these curses on  
  
Dont put these curses on me oh no you dont  
Dont put these curses on  
Dont put these curses these curses on me oh no you dont  
Dont put these curses on
