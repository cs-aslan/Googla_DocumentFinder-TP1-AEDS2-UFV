Its the most wonderful time of the year  
  
Its the most wonderful time of the year  
With the kids jinglebelling  
And everyone telling you be of good cheer  
Its the most wonderful time of the year  
Its the haphappiest season of all  
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings  
When friend come to call  
Its the haphappiest season of all  
Therell be parties for hosting  
Marshmallows for toasting  
And caroling out in the snow  
Therell be scary ghost story  
And tales of glories of christmas long long ago  
Its the most wonderful time of the year  
Therell be much mistletoeing and hearts will be glowing  
When love ones are near  
Its the most wonderful time of the year  
Therell be much mistletoeing and hearts will be glowing  
When love ones are near  
Its the most wonderful time  
Its the most wonderful time  
Its the most wonderful time of the year
