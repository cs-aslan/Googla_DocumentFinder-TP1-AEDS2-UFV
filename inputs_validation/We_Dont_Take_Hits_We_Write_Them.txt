And you lock the house to keep your secret from coming out  
I wont No Im sorry because youre old news  
  
And my life is holding our heads to this gun  
You and your new boy think you can come in and keep me off but youre wrong  
  
I find myself on the street out in front of your house you can kiss safe
thoughts goodbye  
Im coming up to break your heart  
Youre sleeping with the light on like youre dying to be found out
