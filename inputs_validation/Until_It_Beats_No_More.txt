I was down for the count  
Feeling like Ive come to the end  
Nothing really mattered  
Nothing left for me to mean ooh  
  
And then you came  
And I still couldnt see  
Till you tore down every wall in me  
How you healed me with your patience  
If its all I ever do  
Ill never stop loving you  
  
Chorus  
Cause Im alive I can breathe I can feel I believe  
And there aint no doubt about it there aint no doubt about it  
Im in love and its all because of you  
I was fading but you pulled me through  
Cause Im awake I survived I was hurt thought Id die  
And there aint no doubt about it  
Its love and I have found it  
Feel the beat again stronger than before  
Im gonna give you my heart until it beats no more  
  
I was in a place full of pain  
With a broken down heart in despair  
He took away my feelings  
And made it hard for me to care oh  
But then you crashed through the door to my soul  
Put back all the pieces and made me home  
I was living in the past oh no  
Now Im never looking back Im never looking back  
  
Chorus  
  
Whatever you want me to  
Im gonna see you through  
All that I ever do  
Never stop loving you  
  
Cause Im alive I can breathe I can feel I believe  
And there aint no doubt about it there aint no doubt about it  
Im in love and its all because of you  
I was fading but you pulled me through  
Fading but you pulled me through  
Cause Im awake I survived I was hurt thought Id die  
And there aint no doubt about it  
Theres just no doubt  
Feel the beat again stronger than before  
I wanna give you my heart until it beats no more
