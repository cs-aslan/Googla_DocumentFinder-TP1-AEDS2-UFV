Look at me  
There has to be  
Something more than what they see  
Wholesome and pure  
So scared and unsure  
A poor mans Sandra dee  
  
When they criticise and make fun of me  
Dont they see the tears in my smile  
Dont they realize theres just one of me  
It has to last me a while  
  
Sandy you must start at a new  
Dont you no what you must do  
Hold your head high  
Take a deep breath and sigh  
Goodbye  
To Sandra Deeeeee
