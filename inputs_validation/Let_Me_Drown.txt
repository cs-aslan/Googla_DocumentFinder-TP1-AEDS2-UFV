Stretch the bones over my skin  
Stretch the skin over my head  
Im going to the holy land  
Stretch the marks over my eyes  
Burn the candles deep inside  
Yeah you know where Im coming from  
  
Give up to greed you dont have to feed me  
Give up to fate you dont have to need me  
So let it go let it go let it go wont you let it  
Drown me in you drown me in you drown me in you  
  
Slip down the darkness to the mouth  
Damn the water burn the wine  
Im going home for the very last time  
  
So throw it away you dont have to take me  
Make no mistakes Im what you make me  
So let it go let it go let it go wont you let it  
Drown me in you drown me in you drown me in you  
  
I see you turn around and burning down  
The feeling stars to sink  
I feel the hurt surround me  
Please dissolve me  
Shes resolved to be  
  
Heal my wounds without a trace  
Seal my tomb without my face  
Im going to the lonely place  
  
Give up to greed you dont have to feed me  
Give up to fate you dont have to need me  
So let it go let it go let it go wont you let it  
Drown me in you drown me in you drown me in you
