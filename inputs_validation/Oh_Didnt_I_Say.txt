Hollow  
Faces staring through my window  
Sometimes  
I can play a boy you might know  
Station  
Standing cold and old Im insane  
Gender  
Is uncertain just like my name  
  
The lemon kid is my friend  
But even he dont know me well  
Oh thats too bad  
The waiter is an old man  
Who looks at me so sly and strange  
Whats on his mind  
  
Oh didnt I say Im not one of you  
Oh didnt I say Im not one of you  
  
Queenie  
From a doorway says You got time  
Panic  
Not tonight if you dont mind  
Oh no  
My fear of streets I cover  
Today  
My room is home for hours  
  
You can stay if you know your lines  
But please take care  
Ill suck your mind dry  
Youll never guess  
And you can never know me  
Ill change if I begin to feel  
Whats your name  
  
Zero hero says Im noone  
He could be right but whos to know  
Man from the sky  
Oh well Im growing tired of this place  
I think its time to change my face  
You cant even try  
  
Oh didnt I say Im not one of you  
Oh didnt I say Im not one of you  
Oh didnt I say Im not one of you  
Oh didnt I say Im not one of you
