Backstreet  
Check it uh  
Hey  
  
Lets talk about one baby  
You gotta hear me out  
Did you really think Id be the last to know  
What its all about  
  
Lets talk about you  
You say  
Hes the essence of your life  
But hell eat you up from inside slow  
And then he doesnt want to know  
  
Im tellin you hell eat you up from inside  
And then he doesnt want to know  
  
Chorus  
Listen I mean it  
Theres nothin that hes worthy of  
Hes just another player  
Playing in the name of love  
Ive seen enough  
Now this must come to an end  
Get another boyfriend  
  
Lets talk about what hes done hes done  
To become your number one  
Or was it all the promises of diamonds pearls and party dresses  
That turn you on  
Ive seen it before dont take  
Anymore free too  
Youre through for sure  
Just go get on with your life  
Stop acting like youve given up  
Im tellin you to go get on with your life  
Stop acting like youve given up  
  
Listen I mean it I mean it  
Theres nothin that hes worthy of  
Hes just another player player  
Playing in the name of love  
Ive seen enough  
Now this must come to an end must come to an end  
Get another boyfriend  
  
All right

Get another boyfriend  
Stop

You must know you must know  
What its all about baby  
That hes just a player in love love  
This must come to an end  
Get another boyfriend
