Marius  
A heart full of love  
A heart full of song  
Im doing everything all wrong  
Oh God for shame  
I do not even know you name  
Dear madmoiselle  
I am lost in your spell  
  
Cosette  
A heart full of love  
  
Both  
A heart full of of you  
  
Marius  
The words are foolish but theyre true  
Cosette Cosette  
Or were dreaming when we met  
  
Cosette  
Who can say  
  
Marius  
Who can tell  
  
Cosette  
A heart full of love  
A heart full of you  
  
Marius  
I saw you waiting and I knew  
  
Cosette  
Waiting for you  
  
Marius  
At your feet  
  
Cosette  
At your call  
  
Cosette and marius  
And it isnt a dream  
Not a dream after all  
  
EponineInterjections  
He was never mine to lose  
  
Why regret what could not be  
  
There are words hell never say  
Not to me  
  
Not to me not for me  
  
His heart full of love  
  
He will never fell this way
