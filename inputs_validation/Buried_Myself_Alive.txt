You almost always pick the best times  
To drop the worst lines  
You almost made me cry again this time  
Another false alarm  
Red flashing lights  
Well this time Im not going to watch myself die  
  
I think I made it a game to play your game  
And let myself cry  
I buried myself alive on the inside  
So I could shut you out  
And let you go away for a long time  
  
I guess its okay I puked the day away  
I guess its better you trapped yourself in your own way  
And if you want me back  
Youre gonna have to ask  
  
I think the chain broke away  
And I felt it the day that I had my own time  
I took advantage of myself and felt fine  
But it was worth the night  
I caught an early flight and I made it home  
  
I guess its okay I puked the day away  
I guess its better you trapped yourself in your own way  
And if you want me back  
Youre gonna have to ask  
Nicer than that  
Nicer than that  
  
With my foot on your neck  
I finally have you  
Right where I want you  
Right where I want you  
Right where I want you  
Right where I want you  
  
I guess its okay I puked the day away  
I guess its better you trapped yourself in your own way  
And if you want me back  
Youre gonna have to ask  
Nicer than that  
  
I guess its okay I puked the day away  
I guess its better you trapped yourself in your own way  
And if you want me back  
Youre gonna have to ask  
Nicer than that  
Nicer than  
Nicer
