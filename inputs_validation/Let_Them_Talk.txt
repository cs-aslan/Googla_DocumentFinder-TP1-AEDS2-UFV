Let them talk if they want to  
Talk dont bother me  
I want the whole wide world to know  
That I love you so  
  
Let them whisper  
For they know not whats  
Between you and I  
Ill keep on loving you  
Until the day I die  
  
Theyre tryin to breakup our romance  
But they dont have a chance  
We have the kind of love  
Thats so strong  
Well be together from now on  
  
Idle gossip comes from the devils workshop  
But true love will make it stop  
I want the whole wide world to know  
That I love you so  
  
Theyre envious of everything we do  
But its so wonderful wonderful  
When you love some one love someone  
When that someone loves you
