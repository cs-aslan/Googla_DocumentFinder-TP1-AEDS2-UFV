Whats left for me to see  
In my ship I sailed so far  
What can the answer be  
Dont know what the questions are  
And after all Ive done  
Still I cannot feel the sun  
Tell me save me  
In the end our lost souls must repent  
I must know it is for certain  
Can it be the final curtain  
As long as the wind will blow  
Ill be searching high and low  
Who knows whats really true  
They say the end is so near  
Why are we all so cruel  
We just fill ourselves with fear  
And heaven and hell will turn  
All that we love shall burn  
Hear me trust me  
Inthe end our lost sould must repent  
I must know it is for certain  
Can it be the final curtain  
As long as the wind will blow  
Ill be searching high and low  
Final curtain  
Final curtain
