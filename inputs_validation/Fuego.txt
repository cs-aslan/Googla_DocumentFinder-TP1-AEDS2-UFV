Im a sailors girl the best is yet to come  
Rolling in my Fuego I do my own stunts  
I see guilty people angels blowing horns  
  
Some days its just not worth gnawing through the straps  
Freak out and throw stuff Worlds Greatest Dad  
Read a little book about Vlad the Impaler  
  
Whoa oh  
Whoa oh  
  
Inside your Fuego we keep it rolling  
Inside your Fuego we keep it rolling  
Inside your Fuego we keep it rolling  
Inside your Fuego we keep it rolling  
  
I asked Diego if it was stolen  
Inside your Fuego we keep it rolling  
Rolling rolling rolling  
Diego Diego Diego
