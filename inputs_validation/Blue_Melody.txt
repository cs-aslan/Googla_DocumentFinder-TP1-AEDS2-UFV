Well I was born a blue melody  
A little song my mama sang to me  
It was a blue melody  
Such a blue  
Youve never seen  
  
There aint no wealth  
That can buy my pride  
There aint no pain  
That can cleanse my soul  
No just a blue melody  
Sailing far away from me  
  
One summer mornin  
I was raised  
But I dont know  
One summer morning  
I was left  
But I dont know  
One summer morning  
So all alone  
  
Late in evning  
Ill sing in your dreaming  
Down from the mountain  
Along with the breezes  
So close inside  
Love grew smiles  
  
So if you hear that blue melody  
Wont you please send it home to me  
Its just my  
Blue melody  
Callin far away to me
