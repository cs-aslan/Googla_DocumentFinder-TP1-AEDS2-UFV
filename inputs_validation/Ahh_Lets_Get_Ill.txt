Im the Ladies Love legend in leather  
Long and lean and I dont wear pleather  
Last of the red hot loving MCs  
Looking for a little thats my theory  
It goes quick like lightning too exciting  
Lover of ladies dont allow biting  
Levelheaded leader toy boy feeder  
Good love life and a rhyme biter beater  
Looking learning the one youre liking  
Listen and you will love what Im writing  
Ladies love long hard and lean  
And now you know what LL means  
  
Chorus  
Lets get ill  
Come on now  
Lets get ill  
Everybody  
Lets get ill  
Everybody  
Lets get ill  
  
Lightning in the sky LL dont lie  
I can hold a larger load than those other little guys  
My literature is the lands highest law  
The man of the brand one you look out for  
Im loose like the lace in your brand new sneaker  
Release the bass in your face like a large Vega speaker  
Listen to my rhyme  
Here to satisfy the listeners who stood on line  
Bought tickets to see me kick it and wasnt late  
The love every little bit of the cuts he creates  
First not last leader of the class see  
From London Long Beach and down to Tallahassee  
Ladies are pleased Im not wearing Lees  
The Kangol is mine the godfather is E  
I bust your lip my level wont slip  
Clocking crazy dollars on the LL tip  
Come on  
  
Chorus  
  
Loose with the ladies loud like a ref  
When I die there will be no lovers left  
Im the little girl liker legendary writer  
Lets see I never lost cause I burn like a lighter  
My love is long and my lyrics rock loud  
Lurking shadow in the shadows like Little McLoud  
Im the Ladies Love lyrical lord in the club  
Ladies Love the man you dream of  
  
Chorus  
  
Never ever lost not lonely or alone  
You can call me the last Capone  
Not a little kid playing with garbage can lids  
Dont need a legal lawyer I aint doing no bid  
Cause the ladies know my bass is low  
Rocking L after L ever since the intro  
Liberace couldnt rock it like the longlegged pro  
Two legs not four like Lassie I dont eat Alpo  
Come on  
  
Chorus  
  
All over the land they listen to my jams  
Like a cherry lollipop when youre licking your hand  
Im popping and locking so I can give you a list  
All of my lyrics are swift so the losers never riff  
I love giving em bliss having my name on the list  
Im the life of the party and my rhymes are priceless  
Each jam is like a lesson other rappers must learn  
Cold laugh cause they dont like it every time I return  
Come on  
  
Chorus x2
