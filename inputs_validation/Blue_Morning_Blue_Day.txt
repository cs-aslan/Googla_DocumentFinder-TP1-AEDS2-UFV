Out in the street at six AM another sleepless night  
Three cups of coffee but I cant clear my head from what went down last night  
Know we both have our own little ways but somehow we keep it together  
You hear me talk but you dont hear what I say I guess it dont even matter  
  
Chorus  
Blue morning blue day wont you see things my way  
Blue morning cant you see what your love has done to me  
  
Ive always listened to your point of view my ways Ive tried to mend  
And Ive always been a patient man but my patience has reached its end  
You tell me youre leaving you tell me goodbye  
You say you might send a letter  
Well honey dont telephone cause I wont be alone  
I need someone to make me feel better  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus  
Blue morning blue morning blue morning blue morning  
Blue morning blue morning blue blue blue day yeah
