She never thought that she would  
Get her second chance  
Running so far from all shes ever known  
Convinced shes lost all meaning  
Where did her dreams go  
Still she knew that there was something more  
  
Dont be scared theres someone there  
To say these words you need to hear  
  
Chorus  
Dont let anyone tell you that your not strong enough  
Dont give up theres nothing wrong with just being yourself  
So come on and raise your voice  
And sing hey heyyyahh  
  
Youll find yourself in you  
  
Sometimes people tell you  
Be like me to fit in  
Do you know your identity is not in them  
  
Dont be scared theres someone there  
To say these words you need to hear  
  
Chorus  
  
Why should I measure the world  
By someone elses design  
Oh I wont let this fly by  
Hey look over here I just found the real me  
Now its your turn to see  
Now its your turn to see  
  
Chorus
