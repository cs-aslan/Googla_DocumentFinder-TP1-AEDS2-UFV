Lets go out  
On an ocean ride  
Leave all your cares  
And the past behind  
  
Lets venture out  
To a deserted isle  
Lets get in touch  
With what is alive  
  
Ohhh I love you  
Ohhh its wonderful  
Ohhh its magical  
  
Lets get high  
Lets get high  
Lets get high  
High on this feeling of love  
  
Lets go out  
On an ocean ride  
Well tell no one  
Well just go and hide  
Just spread your wings  
And go with the tide  
Let our love be our one desire  
  
Ohhh I love you  
Ohhh its wonderful  
Ohhh its magical  
  
Lets get high  
Lets get high  
Lets get high  
High on this feeling of love  
  
Ohhh I love you  
Ohhh its wonderful  
Ohhh its magical  
  
Lets get high  
Lets get high  
Lets get high  
High on this feeling of love
