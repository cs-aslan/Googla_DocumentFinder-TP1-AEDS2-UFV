If I could design forever  
Id put you and me together each night  
Together each night  
The best I can do is promise  
Ill love you true and honest and right  
Ill love you right  
  
Chorus  
Starting tonight and from now on  
I will be yours and yours alone  
Dependable and strong  
A rock by your side  
Ill be beside you through the stom  
Youll have a fire to keep you warm  
Not just for now but from now on  
Starting tonight  
  
If a man ever loved a woman  
Then surely this is the moment for me  
The moment for me  
Ive never known a feeling  
So deep so real as being with you  
As being with you  
  
Repeat chorus
