Im losin my mind completely  
From you telling lies so sweetly  
Breaking my heart too neatly  
I give up  
You told me that you once loved me  
And you placed yourself above me  
Now I know you never loved me  
I give up  
I give up Im through with trying  
I give up Im through with your lying  
I give up Im through with you  
I give up Ive done all I can do  
I dont want to share tomorrow  
I dont want your love to borrow  
My life is filled with sorrow  
I give up  
I give up Im through with trying  
I give up Im through with your lying  
I give up Im through with you  
I give up Ive done all I can do  
I dont want to share tomorrow  
My life is filled with sorrow  
I dont want your love to borrow  
I give up
