You always give me something  
To help me understand  
Turn those tracks around me one more time  
But all you give is killing me  
  
I cant turn around  
Im gettin loaded on a darker side of town  
I dont know who I am on a darker side of town  
I came to win some game I played  
  
When I was just a boy  
Ive done too much have nothing in my life  
I understood the rules back then  
Now I cant decide  
  
Im gettin loaded on a darker side of town  
Im gettin wasted on a darker side of town  
Oh I give to you everything Ive got  
Even start again to make you smile yeah  
  
But my lucks run out  
My head is burned  
I cant turn around  
Im gettin loaded on a darker side of town  
  
Im drownin in some wine on a darker side of town  
Darker side of town
