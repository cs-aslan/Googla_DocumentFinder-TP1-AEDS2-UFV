Three cheers  
Theyre yellin again  
Three cheers  
Theyll be at it to the end  
  
So drink some big beers and go crazy tonight  
Theyre all dressed up and theyll be gettin it tonight  
Big swingers in double knits tonight  
Big babies gonna get in a fight  
Actin crazy bustin up the chairs  
Doubled over gettin sick on the stairs  
  
They know the limits cause they cross them every night  
The dull sensations as it turns real hot  
Why the guys in the back with their heads on the floor  
Surrounded by their buddies theyre all hollerin for more  
Whoa whoa whoa  
Its Mr Bs ballroom  
  
Party time turn the music up loud  
Party time lose your head in the crowd  
Yellin laughin tryin hard to act smart  
Put em under pressure and you watch them fall apart  
  
Freeze Come on out of there  
Freeze You aint goin nowhere  
Freeze Put your hands on your head  
Freeze  
Its Mr Bs ballroom  
  
Repeats  
Whoa whoa whoa  
Its Mr Bs ballroom
