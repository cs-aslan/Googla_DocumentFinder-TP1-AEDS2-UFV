I hear a thousand drums a million miles away  
I feel the Wembley rock I get a buzz off a big parade  
I get the music  
Everywhere  
Get off on the music  
If this is the end there I dont care  
I get so excited  
So excited  
Call me a fan thats just what I am  
I said I I I I I get  
So excited  
So excited  
My nerves are alive  
I feel like a knife  
I said I get so excited  
  
I hear a choir singing way up above the sea  
I feel the sound achanging as the night rocks a spell on me  
I get the music  
Everywhere  
Get off on the music  
If this is the end there I dont care I get  
So excited  
So excited  
Ill throw you a line come far behind  
I said I I I I I get  
So excited  
So excited  
Its happening so fast  
And the drummers a blast  
I said I get so excited  
By your mind oh yeah oh yeah  
Excited by your warmth oh yeah oh yeah  
Excited by your body oh yeah oh yeah  
Excited by your

Band on the run just for the fun

So excited  
So excited  
It lasts and it lasts  
Get up off your past  
I said I I I I I I I get  
So excited  
So excited  
Call me a fan thats just what I am  
I said I I I I I I I get  
So excited  
So excited  
My nerves are alive  
I feel like a knife
