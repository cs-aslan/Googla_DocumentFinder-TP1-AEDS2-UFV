Hes go so many problems  
You can count them one by one  
Hes a filthy stupid apeman  
He never has any fun  
He lives in the jungle in a cave by a hill  
Plays an old loud drum  
Hes primitive barely human  
  
Apeman hop apeman hop  
Paint the face of a demon glowing by the fire light  
Hoppin like an elephant  
Thunderin like me tonight  
Hes the worlds worst recycler  
The iceman comes a lot  
Hes the devils apprentice  
Hes a prehistoric man  
  
Apeman hop apeman hop  
At night hes gonna sacrifice his beloved apeman girl  
Tie her to the alter pull out her heart and eat her flesh  
  
Apeman hop apeman hop apeman hop apeman hop  
Apeman
