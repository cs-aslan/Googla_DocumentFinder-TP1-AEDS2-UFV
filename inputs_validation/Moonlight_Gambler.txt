You can gamble for match sticks you can gamble for gold  
The stakes may be heavy or small  
But if you havent gambled for love and lost you havent gambled at all  
  
They call me a moonlight gambler  
Ive gambled for love and lost  
When I gamble for love and it isnt in the cards  
Oh what heartaches it can cost me  
  
Win or lose Im a moonlight gambler  
And a winner is what I long to be  
So Ill gamble for love just as long as I live  
Till the day Lady Luck smiles at me  
  
You can gamble for match sticks  
You can gamble for gold  
The stakes may be heavy or small  
But if you havent gambled for love and lost  
Then you havent gambled at all  
  
No if you havent gambled for love in the moonlight  
Then you havent gambled at all  
  
So Ill gamble for love just as long as I live  
Till the day Lady Luck smiles at me  
  
They call me the moonlight gambler  
They call me the moonlight gambler
