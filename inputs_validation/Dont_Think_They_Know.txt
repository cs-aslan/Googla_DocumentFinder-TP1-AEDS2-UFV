I thank you for the autographs  
And the cheers over the years  
You stood by me you didnt doubt me  
I think you want some more  
I do more than sing  
Im older now actin now  
Plus I got my own movie now  
After all the awards  
That they gave me you still found me  
You didnt play me you didnt doubt me  
Think you want some more  
I truly believe that  
If it wasnt all for you  
I dont know what I would do  
  
I dont think they know the truth  
Say they saw  
I dont think they know how could they know  
I dont think they know the truth they dont know  
Say they saw  
I dont think they know how could they know  
  
Dont listen to How could they know  
What people say How could they know  
They dont know about How could they know  
Bout you and me How could they know
