Would you like to go on the Coney Island Steeple  
Go and have a good time  
Well take the subway right down to Kings Highway  
Gonna have a good time  
If its all right it would be so nice  
If you come and go with me  
The rollercoaster you and me  
Just try  
Would you like to go on the Coney Island Steeple  
Go and have a good time  
Like a sister and brother well cling to each other  
When they find out their parents arent there  
Oh itd be so nice  
Like choco with ice  
Oh if you come and go with me  
How nice it would be  
Dont be so shy  
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday  
Maybe not Friday  
Saturday Sunday  
Coney Island Coney Island Coney Island
