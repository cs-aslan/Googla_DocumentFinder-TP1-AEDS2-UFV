Let me rock you let me roll you  
Take my hand  
I will take you to a new start  
Calling the promised land  
Let me love you let me hold you  
With all my heart  
Trust me baby like I trust you  
I did it from the start  
And each and every day  
Im gonna always say  
  
Lets talk about love love love love  
Thats all Im dreaming of  
Lets talk about love  
Its up to you  
To make your dreams come true  
Look in my eyes theres a way  
Dont throw your dreams away  
Youll never lose  
Keep love alive  
Babe then our love survive  
  
Let me rock you let me roll you  
Ill be close to you  
We can have a one way trip to paradise for two  
Theres so much  
I can give you  
Ill give all my heart  
We can always be together  
And never break apart  
And each and every day Im gonna always say
