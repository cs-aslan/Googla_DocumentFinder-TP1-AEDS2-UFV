Some boys kiss me  
Some boys hug me  
I think theyre ok  
If they dont give me copper pennies  
I just walk away  
  
Some boys beg and some boys plead  
But they dont see the light  
Only the boy with the  
Cold harsh cash  
Is always Mr Right  
  
We are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
  
Some boys moan and some boys groan  
And thats alright with me  
If they cant raise my interest  
Then I have to let them be  
Some boys cry and some boys die  
But I dont let them play  
Only boys that save their pennies  
Make my rainy day  
  
We are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
  
Boys may come  
And boys may go  
And thats alright you see  
Experience had made me rich  
And theyre after me  
  
Were living in a material world  
And I am a material girl
