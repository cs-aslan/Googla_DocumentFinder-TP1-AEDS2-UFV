Cause he aint got rhythm  
Every night he sits in the house alone  
He aint got rhythm  
Every night he sits there and wears a frown  
He attracted some attention  
When he found the fourth dimension  
But he aint got rhythm  
So no ones with him  
The loneliest man in town  
  
Oh lonely man is he  
Bending over his books  
His wife and family  
Keep giving him dirty looks  
Cause he aint got rhythm  
When they call him up  
Its to call him down  
With that daring aviator  
He encircled the equator  
But he aint got rhythm  
So no ones with him  
Loneliest man in town
