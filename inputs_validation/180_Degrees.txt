Its so easy to defend the Status Quo  
With everyone so cool and cynical  
But when you see the end dont justify the means  
Its just that 180 degrees  
  
The great thing about bein a human  
The ability to reason  
But reasoning dont work when no one cares  
2 parts apathy one part despair  
  
Guess what this might come as a surprise  
Ill no longer roll my eyes  
A change of heart to let the conscience breath  
One quick twist just 180 degrees  
  
Yeah I now know the right thing to do  
Yeah anti tradition tried and true  
Yeah a world where wrong has right of way  
Yeah fuck that world fuck that hierarchy  
  
Go ahead work waste your life away  
Fuck that world go fuck that right away
