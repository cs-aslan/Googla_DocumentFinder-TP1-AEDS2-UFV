Shes getting older  
Yeah shes getting wise  
But a change has changed the girl  
Gones the sparkle from her eyes  
  
She wants to be a good mother  
So shell do the best she can  
But what about the other  
What about the man  
  
Well its cold to leave a woman  
With family on her own  
Its chill factor  
To the bone  
  
Resignation  
In her sighs  
Is a sorry indication  
Of how time  
Can brutalize  
  
Take away the hope  
And the will will follow  
Take away the faith  
And goodbye tomorrow  
  
Well its cold to leave a woman  
With family on her own  
Its chill factor  
To the bone  
  
She had her dreams too  
But how can she pursue  
Her ambitions be they great or small  
  
You took her wings and flew  
But remember when youre through  
Your rise was due  
To somebody elses fall  
  
When the hard parts over  
And the kids are almost grown  
Youll be their big hero  
Whenever you make it home  
Shower them with presents  
Things she could never buy  
Delight them with your stories  
About the great big great big world outside  
But dig  
  
Its cold to leave a woman  
With family on her own  
Its chill factor  
Chill factor  
To the bone
