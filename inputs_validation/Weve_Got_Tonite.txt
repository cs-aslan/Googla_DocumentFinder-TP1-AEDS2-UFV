I know its late I know youre weary  
I know your plans dont include me  
Still here we are both of us lonely  
Longing for shelter from all that we see  
Why should we worry no one will care girl  
Look at the stars so far away  
Weve got tonight who needs tomorrow  
Weve got tonight babe  
Why dont you stay  
  
Deep in my soul Ive been so lonely  
All of my hopes fading away  
Ive longed for love like everyone else does  
I know Ill keep searching even after today  
So there it is girl Ive said it all now  
And here we are babe what do you say  
Weve got tonight who needs tomorrow  
Weve got tonight babe  
Why dont you stay  
  
I know its late I know youre weary  
I know your plans dont include me  
Still here we are both of us lonely  
Both of us lonely  
  
Weve got tonight who needs tomorrow  
Lets make it last lets find a way  
Turn out the light come take my hand now  
Weve got tonight babe  
Why dont you stay  
Why dont you stay
