I cant kiss the telephone I cant hug your picture  
And these postcards just remind me how far away you are  
Theres two thousand miles of highway lyin between us  
But the way I feel tonight it doesnt seem like all that far  
  
Cause when I get home  
I know the first thing were gonna do  
When I get home  
Im gonna turn my body loose on you  
Its been so long Ive been so true  
I want you when I get home  
  
If I could Id order you for breakfast every morning  
Thered be a headline story about you in my USA Today  
Every inflight movied feature you and all your glory  
And into your friendly skies this airplane would carry me away  
  
Cause when I get home  
I know the first thing were gonna do  
  
Now you could move and leave no forwarding address  
You could be living on the moon  
But I know just where you are I dont have to guess  
Youre waiting up for me and praying that Ill be home safe and soon  
  
Cus when I get home  
I know the first thing were gonna do
