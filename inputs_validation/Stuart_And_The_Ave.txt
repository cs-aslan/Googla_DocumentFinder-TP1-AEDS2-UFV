Standing on the corner of  
Stuart and the Avenue  
Ripping up my transfer  
And a photograph of you  
Youre a blur of my dead past and rotting existance  
As I stand laughing on the corner of insignificance  
  
Well destiny is dead  
In the hands of bad luck  
Before it might have made some sense  
But now its all fucked up  
  
Seasons change as well as minds  
And Im a two faced clown  
Youre mommys little nightmare  
Driving daddys car around  
Im beat down and half brain dead  
The long lost king of fools  
I may be dumb  
But Im not stupid enough to stay with you  
  
Repeat x2  
Well destiny is dead  
In the hands of bad luck  
Before it might have made some sense  
But now its all fucked up  
  
All fucked up  
All fucked up
