When morning breaks  
We hide our eyes and our loves aching  
Nothings strange  
  
It was in our hands from 6 to 10  
It slipped right out again  
  
Therell be no better time  
Therell be no better way  
Therell be no better day to save me  
Save me  
Yeah save me  
  
I hope you see like I see  
I hope you see what I see  
I hope you feel like I feel  
  
And the world dont stop  
There is no time for cracking up  
Believe me friend  
Cause when freedom comes  
Ill be long gone  
You know it has to end  
  
Therell be no better time  
Therell be no better way  
Therell be no better day to save me  
Save me  
Yeah save me  
Yeah save me  
I hope you see what I see  
I hope you feel like I feel  
Someone to stand beside me  
Beside me  
Beside me  
Beside me  
Beside me  
  
Weeping willow  
The pills under my pillow  
Weeping willow  
Pills under my pillow  
Weeping willow  
The Gun under your pillow  
Weeping willow  
Beside me  
Beside me  
Beside me  
Beside me
