Boy if I told you I love you  
That doesnt mean that I dont care oooh  
And when I tell you I need you  
Dont you think that Ill can never be there ooooh  
  
Baby Im so tired of the way you turn my words into  
Deception and lies  
Dont misunderstand me when I try to speak my mind  
Im only saying whats in my heart  
Cupid doesnt lie  
But you wont know unless you give it a try  
Oh baby true love  
Wont lie but you wont know unless we give it a try  
Give it a try  
  
Boy when I ask you to trust me  
That doesnt mean that Im gonna cheat on you  
Cause Im gonna never do anything to hurt you  
Or mislead you I love you  
  
Baby Im so tired of the way you turn my words into  
Deception and lies  
Dont misunderstand me when I try to speak my mind  
Im only saying whats in my heart  
Cupid doesnt lie  
But you wont know unless you give it a try  
Oh baby true love  
Wont lie but you wont know unless we give it a try  
Give it a try  
  
Aint no doubt about it

I rather die before I before I lie to you  
Never wanna leave you  
Aint no life without you  
Never gonna leave never gonna go  
No no no no no no no no oh
