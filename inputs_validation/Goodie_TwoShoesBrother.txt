I bear lots of animosity to bellhops they never bring my luggage up on time  
And taxi drivers really tax my patience  
If they vanished would it really be a crime  
I dont like meter maids or underwater welders  
Health fanatic cooks or camera crews  
Not fond of monks or yoga teachers or sports fans in the bleachers  
And Im not sure how Im feeling about you  
There are lots of horrid people on this planet  
That I would love to give a lashing to  
But my goodytwoshoes brother the favorite of my mother  
Hes the one I want to smother in a ton of pigeon goo  
Yes my goodytwoshoes brother the favorite of my mother  
Hes the one I want to smother  Thank you Sir Ill have another  
Hes the one I want to smother in a ton of pigeon goo
