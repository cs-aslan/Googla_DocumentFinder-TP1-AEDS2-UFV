Chorus 2x  
I smoke kush and I pop bean  
And I dont give a damn how you feel about me  
I sip lean pure codeine  
And I dont give a damn what you say about me

Sumbody help me I cant get up

And I smoked da shit up  
No more purp lets restore  
Call da cush man tell him bring much more  
We ask anotha 2 litter

Chain so bright that you got a eye sore  
If yu aint wanna fuck what yu spend the night for  
Pulled all da hos

To win all da money
