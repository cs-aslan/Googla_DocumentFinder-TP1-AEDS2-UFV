Well I wish real hard when I close my eyes  
If I could change the worldwould I even try  
If I found a reason to regain my pride  
Oh if I try to believetry to believe  
  
CHORUS  
Its so hard to find an answer  
Its so hard to stand alone  
Its so hard to find a feeling  
That was buried long ago  
Its so hard to trust another  
When its easier to hide  
Its so hard to believe  
Unless we try baby try  
  
If I had a dream and it got away  
If I found the words would I know what to say  
If I had a chance to be someone else  
Yeah if I try to believe try to believe  
  
CHORUS  
  
If I found a door Ive never been through  
Would I have the courage to go in without you  
Try To Believe  
And if time runs short would I recognize  
The things I couldnt see  
If I try to believetry to believe  
  
If we listen to the voices that were silent for so long  
If you thought they went away well you couldnt be more wrong  
If I tell you there is something that weve lost but can retrieve  
If I tell you there is hope if we try to believe  
You remember theres a dream that we long since put aside  
With the toys that we discarded  
And the tears we never cried  
We could have had it once again if we try baby try
