One day Ill get home before the sun hits the blinds  
And give you  Ill give you something to remember me by  
Thats the way I am  
Its what I got in mind but I dont know if I can  
You gotta shoot your gun  dont expect me to dance  
Hold me up to the spotlight but  
Dont dont hold your breath  
Dont hold your breath  
Dont hold your breath  
Dont hold your breath  
These empty pockets are my deepest friends  
Full of nothing but good intentions  
Thats the way it is  
It may not be much but I can blow you a kiss  
Ive been wrong  Ive been wrong once before  
Ill be all right tomorrow but  
Dont dont hold your breath  
Dont hold your breath  
Dont hold your breath  
Dont hold your breath  
  
I may be lazy or a living wreck  
I wont be swayed by your expectations  
Thats the way it is  
It may not be much but you know what to kiss  
Ive been wrong  Ive been wrong once before  
Ill be all right tomorrow but  
Dont dont hold your breath  
Dont hold your breath  
Dont hold your breath  
Dont hold your breath
