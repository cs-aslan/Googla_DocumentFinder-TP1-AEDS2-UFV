Subways runnin under the city  
Condos reachin to the sky  
Each of this own but I feel at home  
Standing on this mountain high  
  
And right where I am  
Is where I want to be  
Its all I want  
Its all I need  
Forever in your arms  
Its alright with me  
Cause right where I ams where I want to be  
  
Talk on the cell phone checkin her email  
The fax is a way of life  
Shes shoppin at home with QVC on  
And surfin online  
  
And right where I am  
Is where I want to be  
Its all I want  
Its all I need  
Forever in your arms  
Its alright with me  
Cause right where I ams where I want to be  
  
Satellite feed out in the country  
Oh what a way of life  
Turn off the tv  
Shut down the pc  
And click off the world tonight  
  
And right where I am  
Is where I want to be  
Its all I want  
Its all I need  
Forever in your arms  
Its alright with me  
Cause right where I ams where I want to be  
  
Yeah  
Right where I am  
Where I want to be  
  
Subways runnin under the city  
Satellite feed out in the country  
Each to his own I feel at home  
Standin on this mountain high  
Right where I am  
Right where I am where I want to be  
Where I want to be
