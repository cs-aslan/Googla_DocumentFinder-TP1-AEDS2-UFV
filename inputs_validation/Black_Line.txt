What was done is licking me with fire  
Do with medo what you will  
Im cold and sickIm cold and sick and tired  
Yeah Ive had enoughIve had my kill  
And dare I say that Im walking on today  
With no direction ever had  
Please forget meleave me to what will  
Ill be with you again at the end of the line  
We all walk in a long black line  
We all walk in time  
We all walk in the black sunshine  
We dont know who we are  
we all walk in a long black line  
We all walk in time  
We all walk in the black sunshine  
We dont know who we are  
What is done still licking me with fire  
Do with medo what you will  
Im sick and tired of being sick and tired  
Yeah Ive had enoughIve had my kill  
And dare I say that Im missing you today  
With no direction ever had  
I cant forget youor leave you to what will  
Ill see you once again at end of the line
