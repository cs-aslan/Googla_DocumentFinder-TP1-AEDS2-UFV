At the table with the family  
Having dinner Blackberry on the hip and then the game a little slicker  
Then it gave a lil flicker then  
I took a look to see before it activates the ringer  
Came to realize the homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter  
Then I hit him back thats right I had some food up on my fingers  
Sipping eggnog with a little sprinkle of vanilla  
Even though its kind of cool Im pulling on a chinchilla  
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter  
I said cool cool  
You know I will deliver lets collaborate and make the holiday a little
bigger  
Before we work I gotta get this off  
See the other family members and drop gifts off  
Then Im headed to the studio cause aint nothing stopping  
How you know we about to turn it up and really get it poppin now  
People everywhere and all our twitter followers  
Merry Christmas Kwanzaa happy Hanukkah

If you wanna give its the time of year  
JB on the beat yeah yeah Im on the stand  
Its crazy how some people say they dont care  
When theres people on the street with no food its not fair  
Its about time for you to act merrily  
Its about time for you give to charity  
Rarely to people dont wanna even help at all  
Cause they wont bother buying getting toys getting dolls  
Not thinking theres a family out hungry and cold  
Wishin wishin that they had somebody they could hold  
So I think some of you need to act bold  
Can we give to a tribe lets change the globe

Ima drummer boy so do do
