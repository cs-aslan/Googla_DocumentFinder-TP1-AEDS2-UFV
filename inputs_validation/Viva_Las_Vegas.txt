Yall still want me to come with you  
Bright light city gonna set my soul gonna set my soul on fire  
Theres a whole lot of money thats ready to burn  
So get those stakes up higher  
Theres a thousand pretty women just awaiting out there  
And theyre all livin devilmaycare  
Im just the devil with a love to spare  
  
Viva Las Vegas  
Viva Las Vegas  
  
Ah thankya very much baby  
And how I wish that there were more  
Than twentyfour hours in the day  
But even if there were forty more  
I wouldnt sleep a minute away  
Oh theres blackjack and poker and a roulette wheel  
A fortune won and lost on every deal  
All you needs a strong heart and a nerve of steel  
  
Viva Las Vegas  
Viva Las Vegas  
Viva Las Vegas  
Viva Las Vegas  
  
Viva Las Vegas with your neon flashin  
And your onearmed bandits crashin  
All those hopes down the drain  
Viva Las Vegas turnin day into nighttime  
Turn the night into daytime  
If you see it once youll never come home again  
Im gonna keep on the run  
Im gonna have me some fun  
If it costs me my very last dime  
  
If I wind up broke  
Then Ill always remember that I had a swingin time  
Im gonna give it everything Ive got  
Lady Luck please let the dice stay hot  
Let me shoot a seven with every shot  
  
Viva Las Vegas  
Viva Las Vegas  
Viva Las Vegas  
Viva Las Vegas  
Viva Viva
