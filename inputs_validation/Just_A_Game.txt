Theres a way  
Theres a way for you and I  
If youll just stay  
If youll just stay to keep me hidden from the day  
  
And all its light  
Thats covered up by night when youre away  
When youre away the image of your face is clear  
It is clear across the room and I am here  
  
Against the wall afraid that it is all  
Just a game  
Just a game thats played in fun  
But not too real  
  
Not too real to take a chance on finding out  
Youve really lost  
I cant see you clearly while Im here  
While Im here and you are in my state of mind  
  
My state of mind is changing places all the time  
And I am lost  
Trying to get across another time  
When youre away the image of your face is clear  
  
It is clear across the room and I am here  
Against the wall afraid that it is all  
  
Just a game  
Just a game  
Just a game
