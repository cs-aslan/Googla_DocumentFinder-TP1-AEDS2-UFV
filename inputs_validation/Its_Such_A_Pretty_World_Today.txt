Its such a pretty world today I look at the sunshine  
And every days the same since I met you  
Its such a pretty world today knowin that youre mine  
And happinsess is being close to you  
  
And though the rain may fall my skies will all be blue  
If I look close enough the sun would come shinin through  
Its such a pretty world today look at the sunshine  
Today and every day since I met you  
  
Though the rain may fall  
Today and every day since I met you
