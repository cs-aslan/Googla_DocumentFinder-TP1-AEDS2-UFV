On  
Sailing on  
To our fate  
To India  
  
Above the seas with the wind we are flying high  
Our wings are sails and our trail means no second try  
Golden and silver the future will be  
When were at the aim  
  
Forward we sail into the unknown  
We have no fear were sacred  
Were going to where no one has gone before  
Keep on till we have reached the sunset  
There will be no withdrawal  
Were heading for the the treasures of India  
  
Stars show the way through the night we dont look behind  
Water supplies getting low but were strong in mind  
Power and Glory will come to us all  
When were at the aim  
  
Once there was a vision to find  
A new land behind the horizon  
When we chased the sun  
A whole new world was born  
  
My dearest wishes they will be fulfilled  
When we have reached our destination  
  
Forward we sail into the unknown  
We have no fear were sacred  
Were going to where no one has gone before  
Keep on till we have reached the sunset  
There will be no withdrawal  
Were heading for the the treasures of India
