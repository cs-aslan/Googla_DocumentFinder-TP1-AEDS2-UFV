I tossed and turned all last night  
I thought you werent treating me right  
I love you much too much  
Its jealousy I guess  
  
I tossed and turned all last night  
I rolled and tumbled all last night  
I dreamed someone was holding you tight  
There aint no use to lie Ill love you till I die  
I tossed and turned all last night  
  
I guess Im jealous and cant help it  
But I love you much too much  
I asked the Lord to please help me  
So I dont dream of such  
  
I guess you think silly of me  
But Im living down in misery  
There aint no use to lie Im tore up in my lie  
I tossed and turned all last night  
  
I guess Im jealous and cant help it  
But I love you much too much  
I ask the Lord to please help me  
So I dont dream of such  
  
But I guess you think silly of me  
But Im living down in misery  
There aint no use to lie Im tore up in my lie  
I tossed and turned all last night  
  
Oh baby now you know you know Im jealous of you  
So why dont you why dont you come on and treat me right  
You know I love you daddy show me that you love me too
