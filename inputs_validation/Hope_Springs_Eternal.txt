Pictures of you race across my mind  
Filling all the space there is to find  
Melting loves own ice that lay so frozen  
I give that sacrifice for feeling chosen  
  
So if I face another day without you next to me  
Ill lock you in my mind and wish away the key  
  
CHORUS  
Hope springs eternal when youre near  
All the passion reappears  
All emotion seems so strong  
  
Hope springs eternal through your eyes  
Draws me closer to your side  
And keeps me there where I belong  
  
Given back the trust that was so fleeting  
Captured by one my heart was seeking  
Taken to my destinys horizon  
Searching for the moon we see it rising  
  
And in the silence of the night I hold you next to me  
Feeling dreams take flight they set the spirit free  
  
CHORUS
