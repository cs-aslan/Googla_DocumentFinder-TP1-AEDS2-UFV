High in a tree on the top of the hill  
By the light of the lonesome ol moon  
I hear the call of a lone whippoorwill  
Singing his mournful tune  
Way off in the night blows the long freight train  
With a roar and a ramble of wheels  
My poor heart is breaking with every refrain  
Cause it sounds just like the way I feel  
And its high lonesome  
High lonesome heartbroken and blue  
High lonesome  
Lil darling Im lonesome for you  
Do you ever get weary roamin around  
Do you think of the sweet love we knew  
Do you ever get lonesome the way I am now  
Lil darling Im lonesome for you  
And its high lonesome  
High lonesome heartbroken and blue  
Its a high lonesome  
Lil darling Im lonesome for you  
Its high lonesome  
Lil darling Im lonesome for you
