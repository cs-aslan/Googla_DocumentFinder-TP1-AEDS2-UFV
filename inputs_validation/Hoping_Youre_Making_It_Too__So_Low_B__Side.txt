Dont let my feet get off the ground  
Today Im glad to be standing here  
But all the time I spent tunnelling down  
To some place where Im not so clear  
  
Ive been holding out for this time  
Standing straight in my own line  
Was hoping youre making it too  
  
All the hours we were learning to fly  
Were chasing nightlights round the room  
I can never repay when I learnt from you  
I know youre seeing it your own way too  
  
Your head just went for another walk  
But its coming home and it hangs in the hall  
Your head in your hand as youre suffering  
But you I know what state youre in  
  
Fall on my knees and my hair rolls around  
But even on my knees I know I can stand  
If its coming home its coming for you  
I can see me standing with dunston and you  
  
Ive been holding out for my neighbour  
Standing straight for my brother  
Was hoping youre making it too
