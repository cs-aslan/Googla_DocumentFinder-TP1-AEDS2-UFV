There are things that I regret  
There are things I cant forget  
There are things that believe  
Through the hints that I receive  
Im not giving up not yet  
  
So many things I wanna say  
But words are getting in my way  
So many things I wanna do  
I can make it up to you  
I believe well find a way  
  
Cause  
Sometimes it rains in december  
we all know that  
Sometimes the snow falls in june  
Dont you know that  
Although it hurts to remember  
Our fall in september  
I know that Ill never surrender  
  
Can I get it through to you  
In spite the stupid things I do  
I never meant to say those words  
Wanna see you though it hurts  
Wish that we could talk it through  
  
I try to call you on the phone  
Just to see if youre at home  
I try to find the words to say  
How I miss you everyday  
Baby please pick up the phone  
  
Cause  
Sometimes it rains in december  
we all know that  
Sometimes the snow falls in june  
Dont you know that  
Although it hurts to remember  
Our fall in september  
I know that Ill never surrender  
  
Sometimes it rains in december  
we all know that  
Sometimes the snow falls in june  
Dont you know that  
Although it hurts to remember  
Our fall in september  
I know that Ill never surrender  
  
Sometimes it rains in december  
Sometimes the snow falls in june  
Although it hurts to remember  
Our fall in september  
I know that Ill never surrender  
  
Sometimes it rains in december  
Sometimes it rains  
Sometimes the snow falls in june  
Sometimes the snow falls in june  
Although it hurts to remember  
Our fall in september  
I know that Ill never surrender  
Ill never surrender  
Ill never surrender  
Ill never surrender
