Maybe life is like a ride on a freeway  
Dodging bullets while youre trying to find your way  
Everyones around but no one does a damn thing  
It brings me down but I wont let them  
  
If I seem bleak  
Well youd be correct  
And if I dont speak  
Its cause I cant disconnect  
But I wont be burned by the reflection  
Of the fire in your eyes  
As youre staring at the sun  
  
When I ran I didnt feel like a runaway  
When I escaped I didnt feel like I got away  
Theres more to living than only surviving  
Maybe Im not there but Im still trying  
  
Though you hear me  
I dont think that you relate  
My will is something  
That you cant confiscate  
So forgive me but I wont be frustrated  
By destruction in your eyes  
As youre staring at the sun
