Oh yeah  
Sh de da de dup dem de doo  
  
All the time I think of you  
Holding on to someone new  
Dont make me lose my mind  
Seems like I been here before  
Baby I cant take no more  
Of you trying to play me out baby  
  
I feel so strange thinking about you  
After all the wrong youve done to me  
I cant go on feeling like I do  
Cause my heart loves you  
Im so confused  
  
All the time I think of you  
Holding on to someone new  
Dont make me lose my mind  
Seems like I been here before  
Baby I cant take no more  
Of you trying to play me out baby  
  
Dont waste my time  
Cause someone like me youll never find  
I thought we had a good thing  
But I was wrong and now I must move on  
  
To another love one that I can trust  
With my heart I know shell never run away  
Just cant talk no more  
So Im out the door  
Talk to me  
Why you wanna play love games  
  
All the time I think of you  
Holding on to someone new  
Dont make me lose my mind  
Seems like I been here before  
Baby I cant take no more  
Of you trying to play me out baby  
  
All the time I think of you  
Holding on to someone new  
Dont make me lose my mind  
Seems like I been here before

Of you trying to play me out baby  
  
To another love one that I can trust  
With my heart I know shell never run away  
Just cant talk no more

All the time I think of you  
Holding on to someone new
