Intro  
Were so late nights  
Red eyes amnesia on ice  
Late nights red eyes  
Amnesia I need ya  
  
Verse 1  
Right now I cant see straight  
Intoxicated its true when Im with you  
Im buzzing and I feel laced  
Im coming from a different phase when Im with you  
  
PreChorus  
Another way now like were supposed to do  
Take you to the back now Id take a shot for you  
Wasted every night gone for every song  
Faded every night dancing all night long  
  
Chorus  
Drunk all Summer drunk all Summer  
Weve been drunk all Summer  
Drinking and flowing and rolling  
Were falling down  
  
Refrain  
Were so late nights  
Red eyes amnesia I need ya  
  
Verse 2  
Right now Im emotional  
I lose control when Im with you  
I hope I havent said too much  
Guess I always push my luck when Im with you  
  
PreChorus  
Another way now like were supposed to do  
Take you to the back now Id take a shot for you  
Wasted every night gone for every song  
Faded every night dancing all night long  
  
Chorus  
Drunk all Summer drunk all Summer  
Weve been drunk all Summer  
Drinking and flowing and rolling  
Were falling down  
  
Refrain  
Were so late nights  
Red eyes amnesia on ice  
Late nights red eyes  
Amnesia I need ya

Drunk drunk drunk drunk  
Drunk drunk drunk drunk  
You put your drinks up  
Drunk drunk drunk drunk  
Drunk drunk drunk drunk  
Drunk all Summer  
Drunk all Summer
