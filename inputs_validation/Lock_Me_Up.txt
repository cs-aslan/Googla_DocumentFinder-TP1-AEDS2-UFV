Alice Cooper  
You have been accused of mass mental cruelty  
How do you plead  
Guilty  
  
Dont want to be clean  
Dont want to be nice  
The whips gonna crack  
My leather is black and so are my eyes  
Im gonna be rough  
Im gonna be mean  
Im here til the end my sick little friend  
Im back in your dreams  
You can take my head and cut it off  
But you aint gonna change my mind  
  
If you dont like it you can lock me up  
Woah oh oh oh oh  
If you dont like it you can lock me up  
Woah oh oh oh oh  
  
Cover your eyes or cover your head  
Youll never know what hit you til youre covered in red  
Screaming bloody murder til the barricades bend  
Sweatin in the fog til the end  
  
Its gotta be loud  
I want it to roar  
I want it to blow everyone at the show off of the floor  
Im in for the kill  
Im back with a rage  
I want them to write in the paper each night how I bloodied the stage  
  
Oh If you dont like it you can lock me up  
Woah oh oh oh oh  
If you dont like it you can lock me up  
Woah oh oh oh oh  
Oh lock me up or shut up  
No no no no no  
  
Cover your eyes or cover your head  
Youll never know what hit you til youre covered in red  
Screaming bloody murder til the barricades bend  
Sweatin in the lights til the end  
  
If you dont like it you can lock me up  
Woah oh oh oh oh  I want to be hot  
If you dont like it you can lock me up  
Woah oh oh oh oh  I want to be cool  
If you dont like it you can lock me up  
Woah oh oh oh oh  I want to be sick  
If you dont like it you can lock me up  
Woah oh oh oh oh  ah real sick
