Youve got me achin more than I should  
My heart is breakin oh dont it feel good  
Cause I know for certain were magic in love  
Youve got me hurtin cause I cant get enough  
  
I just couldnt say no even though I should  
Even if I did wonder if you could  
I just couldnt say no when your eyes say yes yes  
I just cant say no Ive tried my best  
  
The way you tease me makes me want you more  
You purr like a kitten but I hear you roar  
Your body language is talkin to me  
Right here in the darkness its so plain to see  
  
I just couldnt say no even though I should  
Even if I did wonder if you could  
I just couldnt say no no when your eyes say yes yes  
I just cant say no Ive tried my best I just couldnt say no  
  
I just couldnt say no no when your eyes say yes yes  
I just cant say no Ive tried my best  
I just couldnt say no Ive tried my best  
  
I just couldnt say no
