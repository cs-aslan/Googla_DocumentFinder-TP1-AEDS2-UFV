I try to discover  
A little something to make me sweeter  
Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart  
Im so in love with you  
Ill be forever blue  
That you gimme no reason  
Why you makeame work so hard  
  
That you gimme no  
That you gimme no  
That you gimme no  
That you gimme no  
  
Soul I hear you calling  
Oh baby please give a little respect to me  
  
And if I should falter  
Would you open you arms out to me  
We can make love not war  
And live at peace with our hearts  
Im so in love with you  
Ill be forever blue  
What religion or reason  
Could drive a man to forsake his lover  
  
Dont you tell me no  
Dont you tell me no  
Dont you tell me no  
Dont you tell me no  
  
Soul I hear you calling  
Oh baby please give a little respect to me  
  
Im so in love with you  
Ill be forever blue  
That you gimme no reason  
You know you makeame work so hard  
  
That you gimme no  
That you gimme no  
That you gimme no  
That you gimme no  
  
Soul I hear you calling  
Oh baby please give a little respect to me  
  
Soul I hear you calling  
Oh baby please give a little respect to me
