She got a buddy named Young JB and now you know the deal  
We turnt up in the studio late night  
Thats why the songs that you hear are comin real tight  
OVO crew nigga thought I told you  
If you a player in the game this should hold you  
And man shout my nigga Game he just rolled through  
Eatin crab out in Malibu at Nobu  
A lot of fools puttin salt in the game  
Until these women get the notion that they runnin the game  
They got money that they jumpin on the pole to make  
Did the motto took a flight to the golden state  
Im the general just makin sure my soldiers straight  
Had to leave my nigga homie got an open case  
But Im big on the west like Im big in the south  
So we gon pay some people off we gon figure it out  
And my name too big and my gang too big  
Young Money shit me and Lil Wayne too big  
Imma crush that ass even if it aint too big  
I would pinky swear but my pinky ring too big Wassup
