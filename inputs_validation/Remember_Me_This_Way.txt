Every now and then we find a special friend  
Who never lets us down  
Who understands it all  
Reaches out each time you fall  
Youre the best friend that Ive found  
I know you cant stay  
But part of you will never ever go away  
Your heart will stay  
  
Ill make a wish for you  
And hope it will come true  
That life will just be kind  
To such a gentle mind  
If you lose your way  
Think back on yesterday  
Remember me this way  
Remember me this way  
  
I dont need eyes to see  
The love you bring to me  
No matter where I go  
And I know that youll be there  
For ever more a part of me youre everywhere  
Ill always care  
  
Ill make a wish for you  
And hope it will come true  
That life will just be kind  
To such a gentle mind  
If you lose your way  
Think back on yesterday  
Remember me this way  
Remember me this way  
  
And Ill be right behind your shoulder watching you  
Ill be standing by your side in all you do  
And I wont ever leave as long as you believe  
You just believe  
  
Chorus  
Ill make a wish for you  
And hope it will come true  
That life will just be kind  
To such a gentle mind  
And if you lose your way  
Think back on yesterday  
Remember me this way  
Remember me this way  
Reeeemember meeee thiiiiias waaaay
