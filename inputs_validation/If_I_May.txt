Id like to love you every day  
If I may If I may  
And dream dreams of you every night  
If I might If I might  
And if I may Id like to say  
I wish that you were mine  
If I had you all I would do  
Is adore you all of the time  
  
Id like to tell you of your charms  
Every day if I may  
Id like to hold you in my arms  
Every night if I might  
Youre the object of my affections  
And if you have no objections  
Id like to love you night and day  
If I may
