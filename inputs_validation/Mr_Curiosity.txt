Hey Mr Curiosity  
Is it true what theyve been saying about you  
Well are you killing me  
You took care of the cat already  
And for those who think its heavy  
Is it the truth  
Or is it only gossip  
Call it mystery or anything  
Oh just as long as you call me  
I sent the message on did you get it when I left it  
Said well this catastrophic event  
It wasnt meant to mean no harm  
But to think theres nothing wrong is a problem oh  
  
Im looking for love this time  
Sounding hopeful but its making me cry  
Trying not to ask why  
This love is a mystery  
Mr Curious  
  
Come back to me  
Im a Mr waiting on and never patient cant you see  
That Im the same the way you left me left me  
In a hurry to spell check me  
Now Im underlined already in envy green  
And pencil red  
And Ive forgotten what youve said  
Will you stop working for the dead and return  
A Mr Curious well I need some inspiration  
Its my birthday and I cannot find no cause for celebration  
The scenario is grave but Ill be braver when you save me  
From this situation laden with hearsay oh  
  
Im looking for love this time  
Sounding hopeful but its making me cry  
Trying not to ask why  
This love is a mystery  
Mr Curiosity  
Hey Mr please  
Do come and find me oh  
Oh come on oh yea yea  
  
Im looking for love this time  
Sounding hopeful but its making me cry  
Trying not to ask why  
Cause love is a mystery  
Mr Curiosity  
Hey Mr please  
Do come and find me  
  
Love is blinding when your timings never right  
Oh but who am I to beg for difference  
Finding love in a distant instant  
But I dont mind  
Oh love at least I tried well I tried
