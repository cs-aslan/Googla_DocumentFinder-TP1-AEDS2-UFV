When the curtains of the night are pinned back by the stars  
And the beautiful moon sweeps the sky  
Dewdrops from heaven are kissing the rose  
Its then that your memory flies  
  
Well upon the wings of a beautiful dove  
Ill hasten this message of cheer  
And Ill bring you a kiss of affection and say  
Ill remember you love in my prayers  
  
Now the angels of heaven are guarding the good  
As God has ordained them to do  
In answer to prayers that I offer to him  
I know theres one waiting for you  
  
Now go where you will upon land or on sea  
And Ill share all your sorrows and cares  
At night as I kneel by my bedside to pray  
Ill remember you love in my prayers  
  
Well at night as I kneel by my bedside to pray  
Ill remember you love in my prayers
