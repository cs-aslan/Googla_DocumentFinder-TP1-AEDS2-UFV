Turn around  
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and youre never coming round  
Turn around  
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my
tears  
Turn around  
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years
have gone by  
Turn around  
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in
your eyes  
Turn around bright eyes every now and then I fall apart  
Turn around bright eyes every now and then I fall apart  
  
Turn around  
Every now and then I get a little bit restless and I dream of something wild  
Turn around  
Every now and then I get a little bit helpless and Im lying like a child in
your arms  
Turn around  
Every now and then I get a little bit angry and I know Ive got to get out and
cry  
Turn around  
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified but then I see the look in you
eyes  
Turn around bright eyes every now and then I fall apart  
Turn around bright eyes every now and then I fall apart  
  
And I need you now tonight  
And I need you more than ever  
And if youll only hold me tight  
Well be holding on forever  
And well only be making it right  
Cause well never be wrong  
Together we can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time  
I dont know what to do and Im always in the dark  
Were living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight  
Forevers gonna start tonight  
Forevers gonna start tonight  
  
Once upon a time I was falling in love  
But now Im only falling apart  
Theres nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
  
Once upon a time there was light in my life  
But now theres only love in the dark  
Nothing I can say  
A total eclipse of the heart  
  
Turn around bright eyes Turn around bright eyes  
Turn around  
Every now and then I know youll never be the boy you always wanted to be  
Turn around  
Every now and then I know youll always be the only boy who wanted me the way
that I am  
Turn around  
Every now and then I know theres no one in the universe as magical and
wonderous as you  
Turn around  
Every now and then I know theres nothing any better theres nothing I just
wouldnt do  
  
Turn around bright eyes every now and then I fall apart  
Turn around bright eyes every now and then I fall apart  
  
And I need you now tonight  
And I need you more than ever  
And if youll only hold me tight  
Well be holding on forever  
And well only be making it right  
Cause well never be wrong together  
We can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time  
I dont know what to do and Im always in the dark  
Were living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight  
Forevers gonna start tonight  
Forevers gonna start tonight  
  
Once upon a time I was falling in love  
But now Im only falling apart  
Theres nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
Once upon a time there was light in my life  
But now theres only love in the dark  
Nothing I can say  
A total eclipse of the heart
