Miracle of miracles  
Look what the night dragged in  
Its a pocket full of misery  
And trouble on the wind  
You spoiled the best years  
Of your life  
You took them all in vain  
Now you think that youre forgiven  
But you cant be born again  
  
And you say  
Why  
You say why  
You say why  
Dont ask me why  
  
I dont love you anymore  
I dont think I ever did  
And if you ever had  
Any kind of love for me  
You kept it all so well hid  
  
Promises sweet promises  
You kept them from your mind  
Like all the lost forgotten things  
You never seemed to find  
Like all the disappointments  
You displayed upon your shelf  
Now youve got no one to turn to  
Youve got noone but yourself  
  
And you say  
Why
