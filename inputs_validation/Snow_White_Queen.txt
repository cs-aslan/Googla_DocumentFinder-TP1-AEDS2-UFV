Stop light lock the door  
Dont look back  
Undress in the dark  
And hide from you all of you  
  
Youll never know  
The way your words have haunted me  
I cant believe youd ask these things of me  
You dont know me now or never  
  
You belong to me  
My snow white queen  
Theres nowhere to run  
So lets just get it over  
  
Soon my love youll see  
Youre just like me  
Dont scream anymore my love  
Cause all I want is you  
  
Wake up in a dream  
Frozen fear  
All your hands on me  
I cant scream I cant scream  
  
I cant escape  
The twisted way you think of me  
I feel you in my dreams  
And I dont sleep I dont sleep  
  
See you belong to me  
My snow white queen  
Theres nowhere to run  
So lets just get it over  
  
Soon my love youll see  
Youre just like me  
Dont scream anymore my love  
Cause all I want is you  
  
Cant save your life  
Though nothing I bleed for  
Is more tormenting  
  
Im losing my mind  
And you just stand there  
And stare as my world divides  
  
You belong to me  
My snow white queen  
Theres nowhere to run  
So lets just get it over  
  
Soon my love youll see  
Youre just like me  
Dont scream anymore my love  
Cause all I want is you  
  
All I want is you  
All I want is you  
All I want is you
