Sometimes I think about our good old high school days  
You would always kid about my adolescent ways  
Oh Mary Mary good to see you too  
Havent seen to many of the old crew  
The time just flew and how are you  
  
Strange we should meet here  
Seeing off our friends  
Its hard to draw the line between  
Beginnings and ends  
Oh Mary Mary must you go so soon  
We must be a sight to see  
Salon and saloon  
Ill look you up soon  
Maybe sing you a tune
