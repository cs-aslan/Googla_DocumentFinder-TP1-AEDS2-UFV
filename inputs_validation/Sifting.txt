Afraid to grade  
Wouldnt it be fun  
Cross says floss  
Wouldnt it be fun  
Wet your bed  
Wouldnt it be fun  
Sun felt numb  
Wouldnt it be fun  
  
Your eyes  
Teacher said  
Your eyes  
Teacher said  
Your eyes  
Teacher said  
The Preacher said  
  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
  
Spell the smell  
Wouldnt it be fun  
Search for a church  
Wouldnt it be fun  
Wet your bed  
Wouldnt it be fun  
Colt aint cold  
Wouldnt it be fun  
  
Your eyes  
Teacher said  
Your eyes  
Teacher said  
Your eyes  
The Preacher said  
The Preacher said  
  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you  
Dont have nothing for you
