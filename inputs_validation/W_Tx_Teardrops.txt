Well the road maps of West Texas never gave me good advice  
The trains all roll where the roads dont go now I lay awake at night  
Just wondering where the rest is so I hit that iron gate  
And I yelled goodbye to that wife of mine I may be running late  
Im arolling on Im arolling on  
Rolling out past El Paso Texas where I might have had a home  
I made my bed so here I lie  
Im rolling West Texas teardrops in my eye  
Though I felt a lonesome feeling in Dulce New Mexico  
I was happier than Id ever been in my El Paso home  
But I thought about the woman whom I left to roam the land  
And I cried so much it dug a rut they call the Rio Grande  
Im arolling on Im arolling on  
Rolling out past El Paso Texas where I might have had a home  
I made my bed so here I lie  
Im rolling West Texas teardrops in my eye  
And my destination is written upon my feet  
And the stars above are about the only company I keep  
So raise my pass and take my seat  
Im rolling fast with a teardrop on my cheek  
So I guess therell be no family so I guess therell be no wife  
Gonna roll away on an old steel dray its gonna be my life  
And the road maps I been reading I never came to figure out  
All I know is Id explode by any other route  
Im arolling on Im arolling on  
Rolling out past El Paso Texas where I might have had a home  
I made my bed so here I lie  
Im rolling West Texas teardrops in my eye  
Im arolling on Im arolling on  
Rolling out past El Paso Texas where I might have had a home  
I made my bed so here I lie  
Im rolling West Texas teardrops in my eye  
And Im rolling West Texas teardrops in my eye  
And Im rolling West Texas teardrops in my eye
