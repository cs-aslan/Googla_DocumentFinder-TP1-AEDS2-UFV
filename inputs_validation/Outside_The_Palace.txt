Ive been outside the palace  
Ive been outside the gate  
I still dont feel that I made any mistake  
When I got off that train  
  
I felt my feet hit the ground  
I didnt want to go  
Where that gravy train was bound  
God help me to see  
  
Ive been loved all along  
And not to get too confused  
Between the moonlight and the dawn  
If I go back to the palace  
  
Ill walk right through the gate  
Nobody knows how much here was at stake  
I might get on that train  
In feel the wheel on the train  
  
Move it on up the mountain like a foregone fact  
God help me to know  
Ive been in love my whole life  
And not to get so confused  
  
Between the struggle and the strife
