We felt this coming on  
Weve seen it for a while  
But there are no regrets between us  
We can leave here with a smile  
We have to talk about it  
What weve always known  
The hardest part about today  
Is tonight well be alone  
Alone  
  
Chorus  
We were just two hearts  
Bound for different roads  
Oh why they didnt lead us to forever  
We may never know  
Oh I will carry you with me  
I will hold on to our memories  
Dont let the dreams we didnt find  
Make you feel like giving up  
Keep holding on and  
Dont lose your faith in love  
  
Lifes gonna move on  
And the pages start to turn  
Well be stronger people now  
From the lessons that weve learned  
This ones gonna hurt  
Its a little deeper break  
But just know Im praying for you  
As I watch you walk away  
  
Chorus  
  
It can hold you it can save you  
From anything or anyone  
Heaven knows whos waiting for you  
When two hearts come undone  
  
Oh I will carry you with me  
I will hold on to our memories  
Dont let the dreams we didnt find  
Make you feel like giving up  
Keep holding on and  
Dont lose your faith  
Oh never ever lose your faith  
  
In love  
  
Dont ever lose your faith
