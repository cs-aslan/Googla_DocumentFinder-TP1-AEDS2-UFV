I want to be a cowboys sweetheart  
I want to learn to rope and to ride  
I want to ride oer the plains and the deserts  
Out west of that great divide  
I want to hear the coyotes howlin  
While the sun sinks in the West  
I want to be a cowboys sweetheart  
Thats the life I love the best  
  
I want to ride Old Paint goin at a run  
I want to feel the wind in my face  
A thousand miles from all the city lights  
Goin a cowhands pace  
I want to pillow my head near the sleeping herd  
While the moon shines down from above  
I want to strum my guitar and yodelayheehoo  
Oh thats the life that I love  
  
I want to be a cowboys sweetheart  
I want to learn to rope and to ride  
I want to ride oer the plains and the deserts  
Out west of that great divide  
I want to hear the coyotes howlin  
While the sun sinks in the West  
I want to be a cowboys sweetheart  
Thats the life I love the best
