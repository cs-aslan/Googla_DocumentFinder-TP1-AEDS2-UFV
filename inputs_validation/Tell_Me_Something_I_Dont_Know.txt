Sun going up  
Making its rounds  
It keeps on moving  
Painting the town  
Before you know it  
Shes sinking low  
So tell me something     
  
Something I dont already know  
I dont know  
  
Toward the south  
Then turning north  
Whirlwind spinning  
On a circular course  
The answer my friend  
Returns to blow  
So tell me something     
  
Something I dont already know  
I dont know  
Tell me something  
I dont know  
  
As for the wise men who pursue  
Their knowledge  
Same as the fool free falling  
Prey to folly  
Can only one fate befall  
Them both  
So tell me something     
  
Chorus  
If every song been sung  
Under the sun  
Whats left for me then  
Eat drink and have fun  
It must go on as for the show  
So tell me something
