Im staring at a face  
I dont recognize  
Rotten and replaced  
Lifeless and benign  
You can never say  
That I didnt try  
I can not erase  
Whats in my mind  
  
Im the one to give to you  
Im the one to break you through  
Anything you ever do will  
Eat you up and impale you  
  
Im bleeding out  
Been crucified by trusting you  
Hate turns to shame  
By praising you adoring fool  
Im the one that set you free  
Bound to burn for eternity cause  
Im bleeding out  
Youre never there when I need you  
  
My thoughts they interlace  
Been spun out for sometime  
I wander in this maze  
An act that is sublime  
You can never say  
That I didnt try  
I cannot erase  
Whats in my mind  
  
Im the one to give to you  
Im the one to break you through  
Anything you ever do will  
Eat you up and impale you  
  
Im bleeding out  
Been crucified by trusting you  
Hate turns to shame  
By praising you adoring fool  
Im the one that set you free  
Bound to burn for eternity cause  
Im bleeding out  
Youre never there when I need you  
  
Im bleeding out  
Been crucified by trusting you  
Hate turns to shame  
By praising you adoring fool  
Im the one that set you free  
Bound to burn for eternity cause  
Im bleeding out  
Youre never there when I need you
