Well you can go out with him

But takin care of you darlin  
Aint for one of the boys  
Oh theres somethin in your soul

Your hands on his neck as the music sways  
All my illusions slip away

Someone to save the day  
Well darlin my feet

But Ive got something in my soul  
And I want to give it up  
But gettin up the nerve
