Oh the Deadwood Stage is arollin on over the plains  
With the curtains flappin and the driver slappin the reins  
A beautiful sky a wonderful day  
Whip crackaway whip crackaway whip crackaway  
Oh the Deadwood Stage is aheadin on over the hills  
Where the Injun arrows are thicker than porcupine quills  
Dangerous land no time to delay  
So whip crackaway whip crackaway whip crackaway  
Were headin straight for town loaded down  
With a fancy cargo care of Wells and Fargo Illinois  Boy  
Oh the Deadwood Stage is acomin on over the crest  
Like a homin pigeon thats ahankerin after its nest  
Twentythree miles weve covered today  
So whip crackaway whip crackaway whip crackaway  
The wheels go turnin round homeward bound  
Cant you hear em hummin  
Happy times are comin for to stay  hey  
Well be home tonight by the light of the silvery moon  
And my hearts athumpin like a mandolin aplunkin a tune  
When I get home Im fixin to stay  
So whip crackaway whip crackaway whip crackaway  
Whip crackaway whip crackaway whip crackaway  
Introducin Henry Miller just as busy as a fizzy sarsparilla  
Aint a showman and hes smarter operates the Golden Garter  
Where the cream of Deadwood City come to dine  
And Im glad to say hes a very good friend of mine  
Hi Joe say where dyou get them fancy clothes  
I know off some fellas laundry line  
Hi Beau arent you the Prairie Rose  
Smellin like a watermelon vine  
Heres the man the Sheriff watches  
On his gun theres more than twentyseven notches  
On the draw theres noone faster and youre flirtin wit
