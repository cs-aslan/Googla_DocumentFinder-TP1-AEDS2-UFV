Lord knows that I love you why cant we get along   
Lord knows that I love you why cant we get along   
You dont have to run around doin things you know is wrong  
Ill do anything in this world to please you but I wont let you run around  
Ill do anything to please you darlin but I wont let you run around  
Last time I held on to you this time I might put you down  
So long so long baby theres no future for me and you  
So long pretty baby no future for me and you  
I love you too much to let you run around the way you do
