Look at me I appear in the night  
Look at me Im made up of lights  
Look at me I am really a sight  
A sight to behold  
  
To hold with your eyes  
Look at me I can move like you  
Look at me I can zoom in on you  
Look at me I can and scream  
I can make you laugh I can make you scream  
  
3d the more you look  
The more youll see  
3d the more you  
The closer Ill see you  
Look at me Im out of control  
Look at me  
  
You can look down my throat  
Look at me but cant out just me  
Im mind Im matter on the video screen  
Look at me ooh the reds and greens  
Look at me all the colors so real  
Look at me Ill make you laugh  
And Ill make you scream  
Im mind Im matter on the video screen  
3d the more you look  
The more youll see  
3d the more you  
The closer Ill see you  
I like what I see  
I feel good about me  
  
Youll like what you see  
Youll like what you see  
Youll like what you see  
Youll like what you see  
Youll like what you see  
  
Well its in 3d  
3d the more you look  
The more youll see  
3d the more you look  
The more youll see  
3d the more you look  
The more youll see  
3d the more you look  
The closer Ill see you
