I hide only to defy you  
Take away the only love inside you  
I see your face through everyone  
Inside Ive just begun  
You think Im out to scare you  
Im only up to prepare you for when you stop and turn around  
Your bodys going down  
  
Youre gonna waste your time  
Your life will soon be mine  
Youre definitely one of a kind and  
Youre suffering cause of me  its divine  
  
Tell me why you never liked me  
Tell me why its that you fight me  
Pulled out and wait for the perfect time to take whats rightfully mine  
You think theyre dumb to defy me  
You said you dont want to defy me  
You wait to dumb run anyone  
Oh well  
  
Fuck you  
Im fed up with you  
Im not as good as you  
Fuck no Im better than you  
Did you really think youd beat me at my own game  
You try to say what you got  
Were ripping at your brain
