Madonna  
Prides that splendid liar  
Sworn enemy of love  
  
Jennifer  
Kept my lips from saying  
Things my heart was thinking of  
  
Madonna  
But now my pride youve humbled  
Ive cast it to the winds  
  
Jennifer  
Broken beaten sick at heart  
  
Both  
Our compassion begins  
  
Madonna  
We played the game of stay away  
But it costs more than I can pay  
Without you I cant make my way  
I surrender dear  
  
Jennifer  
I may seem proud I may act gay  
Its just a pose Im not that way  
Cause deep down in my heart I say  
I surrender dear  
  
Madonna  
Little mean things we were doing  
Must have been part of the game  
Lending a spice to the wooing  
  
Both  
But I dont care whos to blame  
  
Madonna  
When stars appear  
Jennifer  
When stars appear  
Madonna  
And shadows fall  
Jennifer  
And shadows fall  
Madonna  
Why then youll hear  
Jennifer  
Why then youll hear  
Both  
My poor heart call  
To you my love my life my all  
I surrender dear
