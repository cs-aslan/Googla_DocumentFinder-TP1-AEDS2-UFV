If only a song could capture a memory  
I would be with you  
If only a heart could fall for a melody  
I know youd love me too  
  
But a song is just a song  
And a melody wont do  
If you dont belong to me  
In the way Id want you to  
  
But just as long as you know  
This is song is for you  
For as long as the memory of this melody lives on  
Id always remember  
The way you are to me  
And thats how youd always be  
Here in the memory of a song  
  
If only a dream could be realized  
Id have you here with me  
Here in my arms  
Here in my life  
The way its meant to be  
  
But Ive had enough of dreaming  
Of a life Id never have  
If you dont belong to me  
I guess Id have to live with that  
  
But just as long as you know  
This is song is for you  
For as long as the memory of this melody lives on  
Id always remember  
The way you are to me  
And thats how youd always be  
Here in the memory of a song  
  
For as long as you know  
This song is for you
