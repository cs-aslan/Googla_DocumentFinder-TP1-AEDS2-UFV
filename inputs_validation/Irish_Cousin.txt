Id like to say that you gave me the best days of your life  
So have one on me  
Ive been away but I think of you much more these days  
Thanks for the memories  
Here comes the moon again  
It makes me think of when I last saw  
My irish cousin  
  
He looked so happy then  
I cant believe that hes gone at all  
My irish cousin  
  
He said surprise  
And I could not believe my eyes  
When I saw love  
Yes I saw love  
  
Hey its good to hear your voice  
Even if Im number 32 in your little black book of things to do  
Hey would you like to go out today  
Maybe see a show  
I dont know about you  
So little time so many things to do  
I used to have these conversations all of the time  
With my irish cousin  
  
Well here comes the moon again  
I cant believe thats when I last saw  
My irish cousin  
  
We had a row in every bar in dublin  
But we loved it cause we were equal  
Two very lonely people  
Oh is it too late to tell him that I miss him  
I cant remember kissing him goodbye  
My irish cousin  
  
I let him down so many times but he never kicked me out  
He let me cry hed let me shout  
He said thats what its all about  
Here comes the moon again  
It makes me think of when I last saw  
My irish cousin  
  
He made me laugh beyond the call of duty and I loved him  
Im so glad I told him  
But maybe thats what did him in  
I wouldnt put it past him  
My irish cousin  
  
He said surprise  
And I could not believe my eyes  
When I saw love  
Yes I saw love  
In my irish cousin
