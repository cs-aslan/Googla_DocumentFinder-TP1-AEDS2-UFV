Couldnt taste the taste that I was tastin  
Couldnt hear the waste that I was makin  
Tired of the life I was facin  
  
Couldnt tell one from another  
Couldnt hide a secret from my mother  
Any other mother wouldnt bother  
  
Makin time breakin ground  
Sail brown bay to chocolate town  
  
Got me on the porch Im in the front row  
Says shits for real man like I dont know  
Get your punk ass back to the dog show  
  
Makin time breakin ground  
Sail brown bay to chocolate town  
  
A new breath I feel the grip releasin  
Scraping my guts off of the ceiling  
Ive got that sunny bunny feeling  
  
Makin time breakin ground  
Sail brown bay to chocolate town  
Makin time breakin ground  
Greyhound bus to chocolate town
