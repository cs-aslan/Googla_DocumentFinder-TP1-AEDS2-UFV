Dont come on so cocksure boy you cant escape your genes  
No point in feeling purer boy your background intervenes  
Listen good and listen straight youre not the master of your fate  
To this you must be reconciled youll always be your fathers child  
At times acclaimed at times reviled  
You wind up doing just what Ive done  
Like father like son  
Like father like son  
  
Dont assume your vices get handed down the line  
That a parents blood suffices to condemn the childs design  
Ive done wrong I cant deny but at least I know that I  
Shouldnt blame that on my stock this may come as quite a shock  
But Im no chip off any block I wouldnt wish those words on anyone

Son youre nervous take my hand  
All is settled all is planned  
Youve got the world at your command  
I dont think you understand  
  
Just have the slave if you must and be done with her  
Dont ever speak of her like that again  
  
I appreciate too well the squalor at which you excel  
It isnt very hard to tell evils a distinctive smell  
  
From this day on I choose my own way  
If I choose to be with Aida then I will be  
And no one not you not even the gods can stop me  
  
Hes lost all sense of reason and why some foreign slut  
Not only is that treason some doors are slamming shut  
Just like me hes found that flesh can excite but will it mesh  
Watch me rid him of this blight once the harlots out of sight  
Then I think he will see the light  
He wont walk back to daddy he will run
