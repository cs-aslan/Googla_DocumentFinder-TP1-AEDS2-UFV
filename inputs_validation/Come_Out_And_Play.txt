You gotta keep em separated  
  
Like the latest fashion  
Like a spreading disease  
The kids are strappin on their way to the classroom  
Getting weapons with the greatest of ease  
The gangs stake their own campus locale  
And if they catch you slippin then its all over pal  
If one guys colour and the others dont mix  
Theyre gonna bash it up bash it up bash it up bash it up  
Hey man you talkin back to me  
Take him out  
You gotta keep em separated  
Hey man you disrespecting me  
Take him out  
You gotta keep em separated  
Hey they dont pay no mind  
If youre under 18 you wont be doing any time  
Hey come out and play  
  
By the time you hear the siren its already too late  
One goes to the morgue and the other to jail  
One guys wasted and the others a waste  
It goes down the same as the thousand before  
No ones getting smarter  
No ones learning the score  
Your never ending spree of death and violence and hate  
Is gonna tie your own rope tie your own rope tie your own  
Hey man you disrespecting me  
Take him out  
You gotta keep em separated  
Hey man you talkin back to me  
Take him out  
You gotta keep em separated  
Hey they dont pay no mind  
If youre under 18 you wont be doing any time  
Hey come out and play  
  
It goes down the same as the thousand before  
No ones getting smarter  
No ones learning the score  
Your never ending spree of death and violence and hate  
Is gonna tie your own rope tie your own rope tie your own  
Hey man you talkin back to me  
Take him out  
You gotta keep em separated  
Hey man you disrespecting me  
Take him out  
You gotta keep em separated  
Hey they dont pay no mind  
If youre under 18 you wont be doing any time  
Hey come out and play
