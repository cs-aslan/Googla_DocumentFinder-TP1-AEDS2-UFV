I was born in Puerto Rico  
We came here when I was a child  
Before I made to my sixteenth  
I was running with the gang and we were wild  
  
He keeps looking but dont recognize me  
Some guy from Lexington or Park  
Rrd beans and rice from kitchen windows  
Its suppertime and the barrio is dark  
  
No one knows you like I do  
No one can know your heart the way I do  
No one can testify to all that youve been though  
But I will  
  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
And my blood is taino  
Spanish Caribbean in my soul  
We came here wearing summer clothes in winter  
Hearts of sunshine in the cold  
  
Your family rented this apartment  
Youd watch the street lamps from your perch  
In the sacramental house your stepfather in black  
Preached the fire of the pentecostal church  
  
No one knows you like I do  
Nobody can know your heart the way i do  
No one can testify to all that youve been through  
But this will  
  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
Came here when I was a child  
Small change and sunlight then I left these streets for good  
My days as short as they were wild  
  
Im Frenchy Cordero Im Angel Soto  
Indio Rivera Baboo Charlie Cruz  
The faces blurred in every grainy photo  
And fading headline of the Daily News  
  
Judges Voice  
Wiltwych School for Criminal Children  
Auburn Brooklyn House of D  
Dannemora SingSing Attica  
Greenhaven  
  
Twenty years inside today youre free  
  
You cannot even read your story  
The pages piling up in shame  
Before the words released you the  
Guard would kill the light  
The night you took The Capeman for your name  
  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
Yo nacir in Puerto Rico  
All my heart is Puerto Rico  
All my soul is Puerto Rico
