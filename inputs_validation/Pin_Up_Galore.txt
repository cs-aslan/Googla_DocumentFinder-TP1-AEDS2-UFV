Baby I have become  
Baby I have become someone  
A monster ehehyeah  
A monster ehehyeah  
  
Vrizes Wrizes a diamond tiara  
Heres to the girl with the blue mascara  
I have a disco ball mind  
Lights flashing all of the time  
I have ideas go by my mind  
I wanna die I wanna die  
I wanna die I wanna die  
Uh yeah  
  
Baby I have become someone  
Baby I become who iiii  
Baby I have become someone  
Not of this world ehehyeah  
Not of this world uhuhyeah
