A night flight out to DC  
Phone rings with the news

Its time to look for baby shoesyes  
Everyone says Im glowing  
From a heart filled with joy  
To soon to be showing

Chorus  
Found out your My Darling Girl  
Dont you know you change my world  
Your my little doll so sweet  
You nearly knock me off my feet  
Your my little darling child seeing you makes me smile  
God Bless the day he sent my little angel to me  
  
Heres my favorite picture  
When you were 10 minutes old  
And we were right there with ya  
To wrap you up and keep you warm  
And now that your a little older  
I see your personality  
And every time that I hold ya  
Im sure youll know much more than me

Cause your My little Darling Girl  
Dont you know you change my world  
Your my little doll so sweet  
You nearly knock me off my feet  
Your my little darling child seeing you makes me smile  
God Bless the day he sent my little angel to me

Im not ashamed to stand up and tell  
The world that your my my my baby girl oh
