Growing up with kids  
I can truly call my friends  
There from the beginning  
And theyll be there until the end  
Together weve built this  
And all done our part  
Together weve stood here  
Right from the start  
With all these great experiences  
I know I wont forget  
All the places that weve traveled  
And the people weve fucking met  
Together weve built this  
And all done our part  
Together weve stood here  
Right from the start  
I will never forget  
All that weve done  
All that its meant  
Theres a youth culture rising  
In front of your eyes  
Take pieces of you in my memory  
Until the day I die  
Together weve built this  
And all done our part  
Together weve stood here  
Right from the start
