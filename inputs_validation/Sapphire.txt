I watch the day go down  
Sapphire  
I watch my luck turn round  
A high flyer  
I threw my bones around  
Sure fire  
I watch the current run  
Live wire  
Clear blue  
Too true  
Clear blue  
Too true  
  
I dont know what to do  
I got no place to go  
Oh the day I lost my sweet Sapphire  
My precious gems are dust  
Theres nothing left to trust  
Oh the days Ill miss sweet Sapphire  
  
I saw her running round  
Sweet liar  
And I ran the garden path  
Sweet briar  
I did just what I could  
So tired  
I threw my keys away  
With no desire  
Clear blue  
Too true  
  
I dont know what to do  
I got no place to go  
Oh the days I miss sweet Sapphire  
My precious gems are dust  
Theres nothing left to trust  
Oh the days Ill miss sweet Sapphire  
  
I got no place to go  
I dont know what to do  
Ooh the dream about Sapphire  
I dont know what to do  
I got nowhere to go  
I got no face to show without Sapphire  
  
My precious gems are dust  
Theres nothing left to trust  
oh since the day I lost my sweet Sapphire  
Theres nothing I can trust  
My precious gems are dust  
Oh the day I lost sweet Sapphire  
  
I dont know what to do  
I dont know where to go  
Oh the day I lost my sweet Sapphire
