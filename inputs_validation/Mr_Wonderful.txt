Why this feeling Why this glow  
Why the thrill when you say hello  
Its a strange and tender magic you do  
Mister Wonderful thats you  
Why this trembling when you speak  
Why this joy when you touch my cheek  
I must tell you what my heart knows is true  
Mister Wonderful thats you  
  
And why this longing to know your charms  
To spend forever here in your arms  
  
Oh theres much more I could say  
But the words keep slipping away  
And Im left with one point of view  
Mister Wonderful thats you  
  
One more thing then Im through  
Mister Wonderful  
Mister Wonderful  
Mister Wonderful I love you
