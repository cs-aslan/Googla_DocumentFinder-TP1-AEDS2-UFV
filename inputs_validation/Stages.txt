Its a fine time to fall in love with you  
I aint got a single thing to do  
It happened before I knew what was going on  
I fell out and knew that I was gone  
Stages keep on changing  
stages rearranging love  
  
Then you left me standing all alone  
I couldnt even get you on the phone  
Were you just confused and didnt know  
if you should stay or if you had to go  
Stages keep on changing  
stages rearranging love  
  
Now youre back and say youre gonna stay  
I wouldnt have it any other way  
Tell me its for real and let me know  
why does lovin have to come and go  
Stages keep on changing  
stages rearranging love
