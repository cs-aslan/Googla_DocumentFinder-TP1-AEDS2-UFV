Words David Mullen and Michael W Smith  
  
I know theres a prayer flowing from  
The longing for the healing to come  
Someday no more dark aching nights  
Someday I will open your eyes  
The light will come and I will set you free  
Sometimes theres a joy in the pain  
Sometimes peace that cant be explained  
Some find a longing there in their souls  
Someday I will make all things whole  
I promise to set the children free  
  
Someday youll find your place in the sun  
Someday when all hearts beat as one  
Youll sing with the heart of a child  
Someday when the river runs wild  
My Father comes to set His children free  
  
Some say its a vision  
Some say its just a dream  
I say its a promise  
A covenant a destiny  
I will come to set my children free  
  
Someday what the young ones have dreamed  
Someday all youve hoped and believed  
Will be you will all understand  
The longing placed inside every man  
Overcomes the world and sets the children free  
And I will come to set my children free
