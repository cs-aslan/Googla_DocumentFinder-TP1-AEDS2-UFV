Doctor every night I have the strangest dreams  
Doctor listen to me tell me what this means  
First Im goin shoppin in my underwear  
Then all of sudden Im floating in mid air  
My lips fall off and everybody starts to stare  
Donuts and hot dogs are flying everywhere  
  
Now Doctor wait a minute you aint heard nothin yet  
Next comes the part that I wont ever forget  
Now Im bein followed by these Russian spies  
They give me some velcro and an order of fries  
Suddenly Im bowling on the Starship Enterprise  
I fall down a hole and thats when I realize  
  
I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
Im stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
Night after night after night after night  
  
All right  
  
Doctor wont you tell me am I going insane  
Was it something I ate or something wrong with my brain  
See Im naked in church when I meet a dinosaur  
Try to run but my feet have been nailed to the floor  
Then a midget pushes me through a revolving door  
And Im back in the very same place I was before  
  
Now Im stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
Im stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
Night after night after night after night  
  
And I cant bust out and I cant break free  
And its gettin just a little too stuffy here for me  
And I cant go home and I cant get loose  
And I try to escape but its just no use  
  
And I cant ever leave and I cant ever win  
And were runnin outta air and the walls are closin in  
And I cant go back and I cant get through  
But Vanna since youre here why dont you let me buy a vowel from you  
  
Come on Vanna come on  
  
Ow buhhh  
  
Doctor all those crazy dreams have started again  
Thats right I even wake up screaming now and then  
See Im coming home from work but I forgot my address  
Im half an hour late for my algebra test  
Then some slimy alien jumps out of my chest  
And Im falling and falling and I guess you know the rest  
  
I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
Im stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
Night after night after night after night  
  
I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
Stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
Nnnnight after night after night night night  
  
Then Im stuck in a closet with Vanna White yaya yaya yaya ya yaya  
Im stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
Night after night after night after night  
  
I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White yaya yaya yaya yaya  
I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White
