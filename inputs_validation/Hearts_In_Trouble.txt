Nothings gonna change your head you wouldnt let it  
Nothings gonna change your mind  
You just wanna let ahead and you cant forget it  
Leaving all the best behind  
Take a look at yourself in the mirror  
Youll find youll find  
  
Chorus  
Hearts in trouble  
Its hard to tell when youre losing touch  
You cant find love when you got so much  
Hearts in trouble  
Dont you know that Ill be there for you  
Turn around and see what love can do for you  
  
Somethin gettin in your way you cant shake it  
Its never gonna let you go  
Running from your yesterday you wont make it  
If you never let it go  
  
All the things that you need  
Youve been leaving behind  
Soon your hearts gonna bleed  
Youve been losing your mind you cant hide  
  
Chorus  
  
Never know what you got  
Till its moved down the line  
Take a look at yourself in the mirror  
Youll find youll find  
  
Hearts in  
  
Chorus  
  
Somethings gonna turn your head youre gonna get it  
Somethings gonna change your mind
