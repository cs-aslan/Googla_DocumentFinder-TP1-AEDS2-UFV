The way you looked at me  
Tells me youre sorry  
You walked by me  
Whispering you love me  
When I tried to hold you tight  
You pulled away  
But you wanted me to stay  
Instead you ran away  
Baby talk to me lets stop playing games  
Dont turn away from me  
Just look me straight in the eyes  
Dont try to sweet talk me  
  
With those nasty words you say  
Baby just be real and tell me how you feel  
  
Ooh baby come and talk to me  
Together we can work this out  
We gotta love thing  
Were talking about  
  
The way you tricked me  
You know that wasnt right ooh  
You tried to hit me  
Theres no need to fight  
Because I gave you everything  
I had to give  
If you know its worth the fight  
We gotta compromise  
Baby talk to me  
And tell me whats wrong  
Come sit down next to me  
And let me feel the vibe you on  
Cause everything will be alright  
But we must communicate  
Tomorrow it could be too late  
  
Cause I love you boy  
And I you need you me here too  
Together we can make this thing work out  
  
To think about  
What we could miss  
You cry like this  
Cause every time  
I taste your kiss  
It makes me want to lose my mind  
Ooh baby come and talk to me  
Together we can work this out  
We gotta love thing  
Were talking about
