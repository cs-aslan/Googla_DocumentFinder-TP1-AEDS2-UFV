In Chocolate Town all the trains are painted brown  
On the silver paper of the wrapper  
Theres a dapper little man  
And he wears a wax mustache  
That he twists with nicotine fingers  
As he drops his cigarette ash  
And someone comes and sweeps it up  
And then he doffs his cap  
And theres a rat in someones bedroom  
And theyre shutting someones trap  
And theyll soon be pulling down the little palaces  
  
And the doors swing back and forward from the past into the present  
And the bedside crucifixion turns from wood to phosphorescent  
And theyre moving problem families from the South up to the North  
Mothers crying over some soft soap opera divorce  
And you say you didnt do it but you know you did of course  
And theyll soon be pulling down the little palaces  
  
Its like shouting in a matchbox filled with plasterboard and hope  
Like a picture of Prince William in the arms of John the Pope  
Theres a world of good intentions and pity in their eyes  
The sedated homes of England are theirs to vandalize  
  
So you knock the kids about a bit because theyve got your name  
And you knock the kids about a bit until they feel the same  
And they feel like knocking down the little palaces  
  
Youre the twinkle in your daddys eye a name you spray and scribble  
You made the girls all turn their heads and in turn they made you miserable  
To be the heir apparent to the kingdom of the invisible  
  
So you knock the kids about a bit because theyve got your name  
And you knock the kids about a bit until they feel the same  
And they feel like knocking down the little palaces
