Keep back watch it crumble  
See the drownin watch the fall  
I feel just terrible about it  
Thats sarcasm let it burn  
  
Im gonna make a toast when it falls apart  
Im gonna raise my glass above my heart  
Then someone shouts thats what they get  
For all the years of hit and run  
For all the piss poor bands on VH1  
Where did all their money go  
Dont we all know  
Parasitic music industry  
As it destroys itself  
Well show them how its supposed to be  
  
Music written from devotion  
Not ambition not for fame  
Zero people are exploited  
There are no tricks up our sleeve  
  
Were gonna fight against the mass appeal  
Were gonna kill the seven record deal  
Make records that have more than one good song  
The dinosaurs will slowly die  
And I do believe no one will cry  
Im just fucking glad Im gonna be  
There to watch the fall  
Prehistoric music industry  
Three feet in La Brea tar  
Extinction never felt so good  
  
If you think anyone will feel badly  
You are sadly mistaken  
The time has come for evolution  
Fuck collusion kill the five  
  
Whatever happens to the handshake  
Whatever happens to deals noone would break  
What happens to integrity  
Its still there it always was  
For playing music just because  
A million reasons why  
All dinosaurs will die  
All dinosaurs will die  
All dinosaurs will die
