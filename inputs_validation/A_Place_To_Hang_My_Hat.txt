I can see it in your eyes  
I can tell you think that Im  
Just some troubled soul whos lost  
Out all alone  
  
But I know each step I take  
Brings me closer to the day  
Ill be walking on them shining  
Streets of gold  
  
Cause Im just passing through  
Wearing worn out gloves and shoes  
But it matters not just what a man has on  
This old flesh and blood of mine  
Is will on borrowed time  
Its just a place to hang my hat  
Til I go home  
  
Mister I dont know your name  
But I thank you for your change  
God bless you son  
You must have Jesus in your life  
  
A little help along the way  
Never hurts too much these days  
Even though I know in his hand  
Ill be all right  
  
Cause Im just passing through  
Wearing worn out gloves and shoes  
But it matters not just what a man has on  
This old flesh and blood of mine  
Is will on borrowed time  
Its just a place to hang my hat  
Til I go home  
  
Its just a place to hang my hat  
Til I go home
