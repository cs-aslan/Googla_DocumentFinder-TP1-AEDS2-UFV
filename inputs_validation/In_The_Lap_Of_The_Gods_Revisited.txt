Its so easy but I cant do it  
So risky  But I gotta chance it  
Its so funny theres nothing to laugh about  
My money thats all you want to talk about  
I can see what you want me to be  
But Im no fool  
Its in the lap of the Gods  
I can see what you want me to be  
But Im no fool  
No beginning theres no ending  
Theres no meaning in my pretending  
Believe me life goes on and on and on  
Forgive me when I ask you where do I belong  
You say I cant set you free from me  
But thats not true  
Its in the lap of the Gods  
I can see what you want me to be  
But Im no fool  
Its in the lap of the Gods  
Wo wo la la la wo  
Wo wo la la  
Wah wah ooh  
But thats not true
