I was just another lonely guy  
Searching for my lucky star in vain  
And then just one day  
You just happened by  
And Ive never been the same  
  
Nights just dont seem as long  
When youre around  
I dont walk alone down lovers lane  
You just picked me up when I was down  
And Ive never been the same  
  
I never realized what I was missing  
Until I came to know  
The magic of your charms  
I used to spend my nights  
Alone just wishing  
But now Ill spend my time  
Alone in your arms  
  
You must be an angel in disguise  
My heads been in the clouds  
Since you first came  
You showed me the way to paradise  
And Ive never been the same  
  
No no no no  
Ive never been the same  
Well you know  
Ive never been the same  
No no no no  
Ive never been the same
