The world is a hungry place and its never satisfied  
Youre leaving home on the run your mama she was right  
Home was a crowded space but it sometimes gratified  
Look around freedom found now youve gone  
  
you dont belong to me Ive just gotta let you go  
You dont belong to me Ive just gotta let you know  
  
Your life is a precious thing you can never be denied  
You need a job a place to live you couldnt help but try  
Home was a crowded place and it sometimes satisfied  
Turn around freedom found now youve gone  
  
Baby turn back dont ride the highway  
Baby good luck when you do it your way  
  
You dont belong to me Ive just gotta let you go  
You dont belong to me Ive just gotta let you go  
I dont belong to you its only an ocean away  
You dont belong to me Ive just gotta let you go  
  
When theres nothing in your way and all of it burns inside  
Reaching out on your own reaching out youre reaching out on your own  
  
Lust is a hungry place and its never satisfied  
You need to find the gift of love that comes from deep inside  
Your heart is a special place and youre always there Im always there for
you  
  
You dont belong to me Ive just gotta let you go  
You dont belong to me Ive just gotta let you know  
I dont belong to you its only an ocean away  
You dont belong to me Ive just gotta let you go  
  
Baby turn back dont ride the highway  
Baby good luck when you do it your way
