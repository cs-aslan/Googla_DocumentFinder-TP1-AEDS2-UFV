Eat Eat Eat all day long  
Eat Eat Eat while I sing this song  
Eat Eat Eat goldfish taste real good  
Eat Eat Eat in your neighborhood  
  
Lets break it down now  
  
Eating eating gets me by  
On day that I just wanna die  
Weather it be cookies or some pumkin pie  
Eatings what Im doing so moy tai  
  
Eateateateateat whoooo Im outta air  
Mommy gonna finish that sweet ecclair  
Or that pepsi thats sitting there  
I cant have it Wow that aint fair  
  
Eat eat eat never stop  
Pretty ppplease with cream on top  
Once start my eating I never stop  
Daddy heres some bacon so  
Chop chop chop  
  
I want some food can almost taste it  
As cheech marin said Lets get back T basics  
  
Eat Eat Eat all day long  
Eat Eat Eat while I sing this song  
Eat Eat Eat everything looks good  
Eat Eat Eat if you wish you could
