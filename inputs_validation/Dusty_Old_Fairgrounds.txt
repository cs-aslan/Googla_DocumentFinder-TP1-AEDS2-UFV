Well its all up from Florida at the start of the spring  
The trucks and the trailers will be winding  
Like a bullet well shoot for the carnival route  
Were following them dusty old fairgrounds acalling  
  
From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun  
Cross that Minnesota border keep em scrambling  
Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands  
Were following them dusty old fairgrounds acalling  
  
Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen  
Cross them old Black Hills keep em rolling  
Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana  
Were following them fairgrounds acalling  
  
As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels  
Ive gazed from the trailer window laughing  
Oh our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright  
Following them dusty old fairgrounds acalling  
  
Its amany a friend that follows the bend  
The jugglers the hustlers the gamblers  
Well Ive spent my time with the fortunetelling kind  
Following them fairgrounds acalling  
  
Oh its pound down the rails and its tie down the tents  
Get that canvas flag aflying  
Well let the caterpillars spin let the ferris wheel wind  
Following them fairgrounds acalling  
  
Well its roll into town straight to the fairgrounds  
Just behind the posters that are hanging  
And its fill up every space with a different kind of face  
Following them fairgrounds acalling  
  
Get the dancing girls in front get the gambling show behind  
Hear that old music box abanging  
Hear them kids faces smiles up and down the midway aisles  
Were following them fairgrounds acalling  
  
Its adrag it on down by the deadline in the town  
Hit the old highway by the morning  
And its ride yourself blind for the next town on time  
Following them fairgrounds acalling  
  
As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime  
Drinking red wine as were rolling  
Many a turnin I turn many a lesson I learn  
From following them fairgrounds acalling  
  
And its roll back down to St Petersburg  
Tie down the trailers and camp em  
And the money that we made will pay for the space  
From following them dusty old fairgrounds acalling
