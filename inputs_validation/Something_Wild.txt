Sometimes I dont even move a muscle  
Baby while you lie awake all night  
I think Ive got 9 lives in these corpuscles  
Girl you know sometimes I dont think right  
  
I hear voices in the hall  
I wake up and its nothing at all  
A hungry wolfan angry child  
Or something wild  
Something wild  
Something wild  
Something wild  
  
Its not as if we could think that things  
Was one way  
Or they would all just be that way right now  
When I was a kid I thought that some day  
I could tame this lion heart some  
Way some how  
  
Now Im hungry for the love  
That doesnt know what its thinking of  
Searching for the meek and mild  
Like something wild  
Something wild  
Something wild  
Something wild  
  
Theres a hole where the wind blows through  
And some curtains too  
But I cant hide a thing from you  
You know where Im comin from  
Well I tried gettin there under my own steam  
But my very last chance was shot  
Now youre ridin me down like a submarine  
I can feel you in my veins runnin hot  
I went out and stole a new pair of shoes  
Some pocket money and a place to go  
Now we gotta get up and scream at the  
Top of our lungs like it was gonna die  
If we didnt make it so  
I hear voices in the hall  
I wake up and its nothing at all  
A hungry wolfan angry child  
Something wild
