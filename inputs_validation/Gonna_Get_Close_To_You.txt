I like to look at shadows sweating on the wall  
I get excited when I hear footsteps in the hall  
Outside your balcony I have a room with a view  
And Im watching you  
  
I dial your telephone each and every afternoon  
I wait by your door till youre asleep at night  
And when youre alone I know when you  
Turn out the light  
  
Im gonna get close to you  
OhOh so close to you  
Im gonna get close to you  
Im gonna get close  
  
You fumble for your keys  
Im six or seven steps behind you  
Im so close to you  
Are you terrified of me What do I know about you  
How did I find out  
You think Im a fool or maybe some kind of lunatic  
Say Im wasting my time but I know what to do with it  
Its as plain as black and white  
  
Im gonna get close to you  
OhOh so close to you  
Im gonna get close to you  
Oh so close  
  
If you knew my infinite charm  
Thered be no reason to be so alarmed  
Maybe Im wrong maybe Im right  
Maybe Im some kind of lunatic  
You say Im wasting all of my time  
But I know what to do with it  
It is plain as black and white  
  
Im gonna get close to you  
OhOh so close to you  
Im gonna get close to you  
Im like a hungry Criminal  
and your protection is minimal  
So minimal
