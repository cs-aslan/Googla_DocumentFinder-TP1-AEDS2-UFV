Why do you cry He has risen  
Why are you weeping Hes not dead  
Why do you cry he has risen  
Why are you weeping Hes not dead  
He paid it all on that lonely highwayhayyyy  
And his anointing I can feel  
He shed his blood ohh ohh ohh  
For my transgressions ohh ohh ohh  
And by his stripes we are healed  
  
Why do you cry He has risen  
Why are you weeping Hes not dead  
So as you go through lifes journeyneeeee Dont you worry lift up your head
Dont you cry ohh ohh ohh stop your weeping  
ohh ohh ohh He has risen Hes not dead  
  
Chorus  
Dont cry  
wipe your eyes  
Hes not dead  
  
ohh ohh ohh ohh  
Dont weep  
Hes not asleep  
Jehovah  
Hes not dead  
  
ohh ohh ohh ohh  
Dont cry  
wipe your eyes  
Hes not dead
