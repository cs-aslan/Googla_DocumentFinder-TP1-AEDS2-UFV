Oh oh  
Oh oh  
  
Back against the wall  
But you know the weekends on its way  
Waiting for the fall  
But you know the weekends on its way  
  
I got my eyes on you  
I see some trouble comin into view  
Dont you know that Im doin alright on my own  
  
I cant understand it  
Whats a matter with you oh oh  
I cant understand it  
Whats a poor man to do oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Walking down the hall please stop in anytime of day  
Lets do more than talk  
About the weekend games we play  
  
I set my sights on you  
Lets make tonight a deep interview  
Dont you know that Im doin alright on my own  
  
I aint out to destroy you oh  
Im comin out to enjoy you oh  
Its just a case of paranoia in my brain  
  
Ive got my eyes on you  
Ive got my gun loaded just for two  
If you knew my feelings  
Im tellin the truth  
  
I cant understand it  
Whats a matter with you oh oh  
I cant understand it  
Whats a poor man to do oh oh oh oh oh  
  
I cant understand it  
Whats a matter with you oh oh

Whats a poor man to do oh oh oh oh oh  
  
I cant understand it  
Whats a matter with you oh oh
