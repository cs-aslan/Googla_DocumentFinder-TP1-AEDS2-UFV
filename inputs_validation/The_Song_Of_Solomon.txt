The song of Solomon  
The song of everyone  
Who walks the path  
Of the solitary heart  
The soul cries out  
Hear a woman singing  
  
Chorus  
Dont want your bullshit yeah  
Just want your sexuality  
Dont want excuses yeah  
Write me your poetry in motion  
Write it just for me yeah  
And sign it with a kiss  
  
Just take any line  
Comfort me with apples  
For I am sick of love  
His left hand is under my head  
And his right hand  
Doth embrace me  
This is the Song of Solomon  
Heres a woman singing  
  
Chorus  
  
And Ill do it for you  
Ill be the Rose of Sharon for you  
Ill do it for you  
Ill be the Lily of the Valley for you  
Ill do it for you  
Ill be Isolde or Marion for you  
Ill do it for you  
Ooh Ill come in a hurricane for you  
Ill do it for you  
  
Dont want your bullshit  
Just want your sexuality
