I just dont like this kind of living  
Im tired of doing all the giving  
I give my all and sit and yearn  
And get no loving in return  
And I just dont like this kind of living  
  
Why do we stay together  
We always fuss and fight  
You aint never known to be wrong  
And I aint never been right  
  
Tell me where you think were going  
cause I aint got no way of knowing  
When things go wrong you go your way  
You leave me here to pay and pay  
And I just dont like this kind of living  
  
I just dont like the things youre doing  
Your evil heart will be your ruin  
When things start running smooth and free  
You haul right off and you pick on me  
And I just dont like this way of living  
  
They say the road of love is long  
Its rocky and its rough  
But if this road dont start to get smooth  
Ive traveled it long enough  
  
Why dont you act a little older  
And get that chip up off your shoulder  
I told you once  
Now Ill tell you twice  
You better start to treat me nice  
cause I just dont like this way of living
