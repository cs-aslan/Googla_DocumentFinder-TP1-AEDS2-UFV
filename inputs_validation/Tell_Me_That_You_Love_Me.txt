So far away on a cold lonely night  
If I could only hear your voice  
That Id be alright  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell me that you care  
I just wanna hear your voice  
Come floating through the air  
Telephones are lonely  
Tell me youre alright  
I just wanna feel you near  
When I lay down tonight  
Id give anything to see your face  
Just to share the silence of your eyes  
Your love is something no one can replace  
And While Im gone I dont want you to cry  
Please dont cry  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell me youre okay  
Telephones are lonely  
It sounds so far away  
Tell me that you need me  
Tell me its alright  
I just wanna hear your voice  
When I lay down tonight  
Id give everything to taste your kiss  
Just to feel your body touching mine  
It hurts me to be wanting you like this  
So tell me that you love me one more time  
One more time  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell me youre alone  
I just wanna hear your voice  
Im so far from home  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell me that you care  
I just wanna hear your voice  
Come floating through the air  
Oh Tell me that you love me  
Tell me that you care  
I just wanna hear your voice  
Come floating through the air  
Telephones are lonely  
Tell me youre alright  
I just wanna feel you near  
When I lay down tonight  
so far away
