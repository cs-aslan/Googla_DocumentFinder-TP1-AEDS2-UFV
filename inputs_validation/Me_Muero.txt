Everyday in my lifes in shambles  
Its easy took the love away  
I got nothing left to gamble  
Ive thrown it all away  
  
Chorus  
Now and then Im suicidal  
Flirting with a new temptation  
Happiness inside a bottle is what I need today  
Oh my lovers gone away gone to Istanbul  
Light as a feather  
I lie in my bed and flip through TV channels  
Eating Godiva  
Im smoking my days away reading old emails  
In my old pajamas  
What a day me muero muero muero  
  
Loneliness makes its arrival  
Depression starts to settle in  
Try to go where no onell write her  
And do some crazy thing  
  
Chorus  
  
Its the good stuff oh my lover  
Lover  
Smoking Im smoking my days away  
What a day me muero muero muero  
What a day  
  
Gone away yeah  
Doctor doctor  
You give me my lover  
Oh yeah  
Oh my lover  
Gone gone away  
My lover gone away  
What a day me muero muero muero
