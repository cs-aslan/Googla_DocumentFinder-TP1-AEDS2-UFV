Walter quit the RAF  
When there was no good air left  
Made it back to the clan  
The dog the wife the betting slip wet in his hand  
And no ones listening  
To the boys  
Tim Jaimme and Gab  
Keeping him up while his mistress rings his hands  
Picked him up after school  
Just make sure youre looking good  
And no ones leaving  
  
Walter plays  
Get off your knees  
Walter plays  
Get off your knees  
  
Its mini coke and prawns again  
In his room or on the sand  
Not a day before he fell  
Propping up the bar at the Raffles hotel  
And no one leaving  
  
Walter plays  
Get off your knees  
Give the kids a hand  
Down on the sand  
  
No ones listening  
Walter plays  
Get off your knees  
Give the kids a hand  
Down on the sand
