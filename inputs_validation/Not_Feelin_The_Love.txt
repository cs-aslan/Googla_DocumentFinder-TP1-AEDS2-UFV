Lately youre be acting strange towards me baby  
And your heart seems to grown straight cold  
You used to laugh at everything I said baby  
Now you play me like my jokes are old  
  
Chorus  
And girl we used to talk about everything  
Like make love until were old and grey  
And all these photo I took  
You dont give me the same love  
And when I ask you you say everything is okay  
Well Im not feeling the love no more  
And although I see you standing there I cant find you anywhere  
Well Im not feeling the love no more  
Tell me how where we go wrong  
  
Feels like Im living all alone in this old house  
Cause youre distance brings the worst of you  
Its like a battle of silence for  
Cause it seems Im just a ghost to you  
  
Chorus  
  
I remember we used to make love through the night  
And we were doing it til the morning light  
Put you are not there  
  
Repeat x2  
Well Im not feeling the love no more  
And although I see you standing there I cant find you anywhere  
Well Im not feeling the love no more  
Tell me how where we go wrong
