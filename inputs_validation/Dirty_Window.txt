I see my reflection in the window  
It looks different so different than what you see  
Projecting judgment on the world  
This house is clean baby  
This house is clean  
  
Am I who I think I am  
Am I who I think I am  
Am I who I think I am  
Look out my window and see its gone wrong  
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down  
  
Im judge and Im jury and Im executioner too

I see my reflection in the window  
This window clean inside dirty on the out  
Im looking different than me  
This house is clean baby  
This house is clean  
  
Am I who I think I am  
Am I who I think I am  
Am I who I think I am  
I look my window and see its gone wrong  
My court is in session and now I slam my gavel down
