You know my old car needs washing  
And the front yard needs a trim  
And the telephone keeps ringing  
And the boss man knows I know its him  
And the bills aint gonna pay themselves  
No matter anyway  
Cause I aint in no hurry today  
  
Theres nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole  
And the smell of early spring  
Sit down in a foldup easy chair  
On a quiet shady river bank  
Let the world go on without me  
Wouldnt have it any other way  
Cause I aint in no hurry today  
  
Aint in no hurry  
Id be a fool now to worry  
About all those things I cant change  
And the time that I borrow  
Can wait till tomorrow  
Cause I aint in no hurry today  
  
When I must return  
To the cold cold ground  
Have em take their time  
When they lay this sinner down  
  
Heaven knows that I aint perfect  
Ive raised a little Cain  
And I plan to raise a whole lot more  
Before I hear those angels sing  
Gonna get right with the lord  
But therell be hell to pay  
But I aint in no hurry  
  
Aint in no hurry  
Be a fool now to worry  
About all those things I cant change  
And the time that I borrow  
Can wait til tomorrow  
Cause I aint in no hurry  
Aint in no hurry  
Aint in no hurry today
