No hes not a man who brags about his good look wealth or fame  
Though his reputations talk about but he dont hide a thing  
He lives the way he wants to live and thats how he should be  
Im all hes got but hes got all of me  
Yes Im all hes got but hes got all of me  
Ill be contented in his loving arms eternaly  
For could he give me more than love how richer could I be  
Im all hes got but hes got all of me  
 steel  piano   
Yes we have a lot in common and thats more than others have  
Take you preachin out for something but theres nothing there to brag  
His love is all he has to give but he gives it all to me  
Im all hes got but hes got all of me  
Yes Im all hes got
