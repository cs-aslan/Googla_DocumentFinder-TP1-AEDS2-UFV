I met a little girl sitting in the front  
Pardon me miss for seeming quite so blunt  
But your beauty and your presence  
Just took me by surprise  
  
She said theres a meaning in my sexy stare  
But thats my old man thats sitting over there  
And thats not the look of love that hes got for you in his eyes  
  
You know what youve gotta do  
Theres no one else to blame but you  
Nobodys gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
You know what youve gotta do  
Theres no one else to blame but you  
Nobodys gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
I took her home and we was doing nip and tuck  
How was I to know that I was out of luck  
And before I knew it the devil took my soul  
  
In two weeks time it seemed to be the steady con  
She told me youre about to be a papa John  
And I just looked around and tried to crawl into the nearest hole  
  
You know what youve gotta do  
Theres no one else to blame but you  
Nobodys gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
You know what youve gotta do  
Theres no one else to blame but you  
Nobodys gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
Well in two more weeks I started feeling sore  
I found myself waiting at my doctors door  
He said son Im sorry but Ive got some slightly less than tragic news  
  
yeah it seems youve been sociable with certain shes  
Cause youve contracted what we call a social disease  
And next time you better ask and use it no dont refuse  
  
You know what youve gotta do  
Theres no one else to blame but you  
Nobodys gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
You know what youve gotta do  
Theres no one else to blame but you  
Nobodys gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
You know what youve gotta do  
Theres no one else to blame but you  
Nobodys gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask
