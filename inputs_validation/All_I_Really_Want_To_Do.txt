Im in the right place just at the wrong time  
Oh what am I gonna do  
She left her name but she left no number  
Oh what am I gonna do  
  
Im in the thick of it no one to turn to  
Let me explain what I mean to do  
Coming and going and going and coming  
Im going to be coming the better Ill be gone  
  
Chorus  
All I really wanna do is love you ooh ooh  
Open up your heart and let me love you ooh ooh  
I cant help it I cant stop it  
I cant keep my heart from saying  
All I really want to do is love you ooh ooh ah yeah  
  
I let her in but she couldnt stay well  
Oh what am I gonna do  
I said the right thing just at the wrong time  
Dont know what Im gonna do  
  
Coming and going and going and coming  
Im going to be coming the better Ill be gone  
  
Chorus  
  
chorus repeat to fade
