I can see by your grin  
That youre trembling within  
Its all over town cheer down  
And the smile on your face  
Is sometimes out of place  
Dont mind no frowns cheer down  
  
If your hair should fall  
If your shares should crash  
Youll get by even without getting a rash  
  
Theres no tears to be shed  
Im gonna love you instead  
I want you around cheer down  
  
When your teeth drop out  
Youll get by even without taking a bite  
  
If your dog should be dead  
Im gonna love you instead  
The world loves a clown cheer down  
I want you around cheer down
