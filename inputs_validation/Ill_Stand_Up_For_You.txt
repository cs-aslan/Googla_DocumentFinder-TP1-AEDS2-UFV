When youre too worn out to fight  
Ill stand up for you and when you need a bed for the night  
Ill stand up for you when my friends put you down  
Ill stand up for you when they run you out of town  
Ill stand up for you oh what the hell  
Ill take a greyhound bus with you  
They call you a fool and say that Im too foolish to see  
Well Ill stand up for you and you stand up for me  
Ill stand up I wont sit back Ill stand up  
I wont sit back well the cigarettes are gone  
And the ashtrays are full honey  
Everyone thinks were trash so I take I take it out on you  
Im sorry the dreams are gone and Ive made you mad or two  
Thats the exactly wrong time to pick a fight with you  
Oh what the hell lets call it a night  
They call you a fool and say that Im too foolish to see  
Well Ill stand up for you and you stand up for me  
Ill stand up I wont sit back Ill stand up I wont sit back
