I dont know what he does to make you cry  
But Ill be there to make you smile  
I dont have a fancy car  
To get to you Id walk a thousand miles  
I dont care if he buys you nice things  
Does his gifts come from the heart I dont know  
But if you were my girl  
Id make it so wed never be apart  
  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I dont think I can live  
I wish I could give the world to you but  
Love is all I have to give  
  
When you talkdoes it seem like hes not  
Even listening to a word you say  
Thats okay babe just tell me your problems  
Ill try my best to kiss them all away  
Does he leave when you need him the most  
Does his friends get all your time  
Baby please Im on my knees  
Praying for the day that youll be mine  
  
To you hey girl I dont want you to cry no moreinside  
All the money in the world could never add up to all the love  
I have inside I Love You  
  
And I will give it to you  
All I can give all I can give  
Everything I have is for you  
But love is all I have to give
