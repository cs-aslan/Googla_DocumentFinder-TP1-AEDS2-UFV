When I think back on these times  
And the dreams we left behind  
Ill be glad cause I was blessed to get to have you in my life  
  
When I look back on these days  
Ill look and see your face  
You were right there for me  
  
In my dreams Ill always see you soaring by the sky  
In my heart therell always be a place for you  
For all my life  
Ill keep a part of you with me  
And everywhere I am there youll be  
And everywhere I am there youll be  
  
Well you showed me how it feels  
To feel the sky within my reach  
And I always will remember all the strength you gave to me  
Your love made me make it through  
Oh I owe so much to you  
You were right there for me  
  
In my dreams Ill always see you soar above the sky  
In my heart therell always be a place for you  
For all my life  
Ill keep a part of you with me  
And everywhere I am there youll be  
  
Cause I always saw in you my light my strength  
And I want to thank you now for all the ways  
You were right there for me  
You were right there for me  
You were right there for me  
For always  
  
In my dreams Ill always see you soar above the sky  
In my heart therell always be a place for you  
For all my life  
  
Ill keep a part of you with me  
And everywhere I am there youll be  
And everywhere I am there youll be  
There youll be
