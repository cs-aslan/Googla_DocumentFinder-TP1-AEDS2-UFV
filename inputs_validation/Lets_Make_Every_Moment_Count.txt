The bittersweet sadness of time passing by  
Trying to hold back the years  
you try to reach out and touch yesterday  
But yesterday just disappears  
  
Weve shared a lot of sadness  
Weve shared a lot of pain  
Lets make good use of the time that remains  
  
Lets make every moment count  
Lets taste the richness of life to its fullest amount  
Between me and you and all weve been through  
There are no problems that we cant surmount  
Lets make every moment count  
Lets make every moment count  
  
I still remember the day we first meet  
We both didnt have a care  
The years have flown but weve both grown  
Were none of the worse for the wear  
  
Were only just beginning  
Im still your lover and your friend  
And its never too late to dream again  
  
You say weve seen the best of all our memories  
But if your heart and soul are in it  
Well make a new one every minute
