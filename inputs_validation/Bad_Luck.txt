I have to tell a story  about a man  
Never in the mood  to change his life  
Nobody wants to help him  as he spirals down  
But one day the wrong decision  hit him overnight  
  
No more cocktail parties  champagnes run dry  
No company takeovers  stock markets high  
No more handjobs in the boardroom  sex is history  
And no saunas no jacuzzis  the penalties youll reap  
  
At last he realized  he did it wrong  
Messed big time everywhere  doubledealing lies  
  
Hes going down on his bad luck  his just deserts  
Hes going down on his bad luck  what he deserved  
  
His old man told him always  listen son  
Its a twoway street to fortune  you gotta hit and run  
Dont forget the mirror  look whos behind  
And dont you come up crying  when its faster coming down  
  
At last he realized  he did it wrong  
Messed big time everywhere  doubledealing lies  
  
Hes going down on his bad luck  his just deserts  
Hes going down on his bad luck  what he deserved  
Hes going down on his bad luck  its his time  
Hes going down on his bad luck  cant rewind  
  
Do you get the story  you know this man  
Have you learned a lesson  do you understand  
When all you got is crystal  you shouldnt cast a stone  
So be careful when you go up  cause youll meet them coming down  
  
Hes going down on his bad luck  his just deserts  
Hes going down on his bad luck  what he deserved  
Hes going down on his bad luck  its his time  
Hes going down on his bad luck  cant rewind
