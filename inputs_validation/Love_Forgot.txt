Learn to love and you learn to survive  
My mistake was thinking love wouldnt catch me  
It was the story of my life  
I awakened seeing with new eyes  
I begged forgiveness but love wouldnt hear me  
Taught you to fear me baby  
  
Love forgot we used to be just fine  
And love forgot about the tender times  
Love forgot to ask you if youd want to give me  
Give me one more try  
Maybe love forgot this time  
  
Love cant love someone who breaks a vow  
But I was not myself my heart wasnt in it  
I still loved you every minute  
I could fix it if you show me how  
You didnt hear it from somebody else I told you  
Praying youd let me hold you  
  
I cant believe Love forgot the power to forgive  
Impossible And love forgot that we depend on it  
It couldnt be Love forgot that its the only way  
Our poetry will ever rhyme  
I think love forgot this time  
  
But who would have ever known  
Id ever be tempted but Im hopin  
Love will show me what to do  
cause if it was all so easy  
Then anybody else coulda shown me  
I dont understand how you wouldnt know  
I never even meant it  
  
I cant believe Did love forget this was the only time  
Impossible Did love forget I tried to set things right  
It couldnt be Did love forget to remember  
That regret lives in this heart of mine  
Maybe love forgot this time  
  
I cant believe Love forgot the power to forgive  
Impossible And love forgot that we depend on it  
It couldnt be Love forgot that its the only way  
That poetry will ever rhyme  
Maybe love forgot this time  
  
Did you forget this time  
Did you forget this time  
Dont forget me now  
Dont forget me now  
Did you forget somehow  
Did you forget somehow
