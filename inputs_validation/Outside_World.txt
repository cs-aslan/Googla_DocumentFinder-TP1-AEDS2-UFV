She has six swans singing in her sauna  
So she cant hear whats going on  
No she cant hear whats going on  
In the outside world  
In the outside world  
In the outside  
Bad black and white men  
Standing in their pigpen  
Selling guns to simpletons  
To shoot em in the abdomen  
And shes not interested in that  
And shes not interested in that  
She has six swans singing in her sauna  
Outside  world  outside  
  
She has eleven lions laughing at her lakeside  
So she cant hear whats going on  
No she cant hear whats going on  
In the outside world  
In the outside world  
In the outside  
Bad brown and yellow men  
Splitting on their fellow men  
Drape her in a newspaper  
And stab her with a poison pen  
Shes not interested in that  
Shes not interested in that  
She has eleven lions laughing at her lakeside  
Outside  world  outside  
  
You can keep your animals  
All the noise and the din  
Just make a little space for me  
Im coming in
