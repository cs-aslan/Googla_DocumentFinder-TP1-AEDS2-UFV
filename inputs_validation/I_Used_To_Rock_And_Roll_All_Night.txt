You loved us when the band was hot  
And now were gonna give it one more shot  
Were gettin old  
We must be crazy  
  
Were puttin on the makeup again  
It covers up a buncha wrinkled skin  
You bring the bread  
Well make the gravy  
  
You keep on standin  
Well keep on singin  
  
I used to rock and roll all night  
But now my hairs turning gray  
I have to get to bed by nine  
Rub on a tube of Bengay  
  
Havent picked up my guitar for a while  
Not since them hulahoops went outta style  
Its been a while  
Im pretty rusty  
  
Well give you everything we got  
Would you like to see my liver spots  
You drive us home if we get sleepy  
If the shirts keep on sellin  
Well keep on yellin  
  
I used to rock and roll all night  
But now my hairs turning gray  
I have to get to bed by nine  
Rub in a tube of Bengay  
  
I wanna rock and roll all night  
But I cant stay awake  
Id like to rock and roll all night  
But then my body would ache  
Ill try to rock and roll all night  
If theres some dough to be made  
I wanna rock and roll all night  
But I get drowsy by eight
