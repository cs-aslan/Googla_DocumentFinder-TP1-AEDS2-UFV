Let someone start believing in you  
Let him hold out his hand  
Let him touch you and watch what happens  
One someone who can look in your eyes  
  
And see into your heart  
Let him find you and watch what happens  
Cold no I wont believe your heart is cold  
Maybe just afraid to be broken again  
  
Let someone with a deep love to give  
Give that deep love to you  
And what magic youll see  
Let someone with a deep love to give  
  
Give that deep love to you  
And what magic youll see  
Let someone give his heart  
Someone who cares like me  
  
Let someone give his heart who cares like me  
As sung by johnny mathis  
Cold no I cant believe your heart is cold  
Maybe slow to warm from a long lonely night  
  
Let someone start believing in you  
Let him hold out his hand  
Let him touch you and watch what happens  
One someone who can look in your eyes  
  
And see into your heart  
Let him find you and watch what happens  
Cold no I wont believe your heart is cold  
Maybe just afraid to be broken again  
  
Let someone with a deep love to give  
Give that deep love to you  
And what magic youll see  
Let someone give his heart  
  
Someone who cares like me
