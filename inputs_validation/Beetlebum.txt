Beetlebum  
What youve done  
Shes a gun  
Now what youve done  
Beetlebum  
Get nothing done  
You beetlebum just get numb  
Now what youve done  
Beetlebum  
  
And when she lets me slip away  
She turns me on all my violence is gone  
Nothing is wrong  
I just slip away and I am gone  
Nothing is wrong  
She turns me on  
I just slip away and I am gone  
  
Beetlebum  
Because youre young  
Shes a gun  
Now what youve done  
Beetlebum  
Shell suck your thumb  
Shell make you come  
Coz shes your gun  
Now what youve done  
Beetlebum  
  
And when she lets me slip away  
She turns me on all my violence is gone  
Nothing is wrong  
I just slip away and I am gone  
Nothing is wrong  
She turns me on  
I just slip away and I am gone
