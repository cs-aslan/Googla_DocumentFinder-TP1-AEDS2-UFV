Cold and lonely night you dont have to leave at all  
A car rolls up outside on time a moment from your call  
And handshake seems more fitting than a kiss  
Such a shame that you and I should have to end like this  
  
Cant we just sit down and talk it over  
Surely you can ask the better way  
Strange that youre the one so set on leaving  
And Im the one who said last night that it was all too late  
  
Cant we just sit down and talk it over  
Who knows maybe in a little while  
Well forget our pride and the things we said last night  
And maybe you and I can talk it out  
  
Tonight stay somewhere warm they say its gonna freeze  
You may not find a place at all so be sure and take your keys  
I can almost taste the silence now  
Does it really matter still  
Who was wrong who let who down  
  
Cant we just sit down and talk it over  
Who knows maybe in a little while  
Well forget our pride and the things we said last night  
And maybe you and I can talk it out  
  
Hold on hold on  
Surely you and I can talk it out  
Hold on hold on  
Surely you and I can make it right  
Hold on hold on yeah  
Cant we just sit down and talk it over  
Hold on hold on  
Hold on hold on
