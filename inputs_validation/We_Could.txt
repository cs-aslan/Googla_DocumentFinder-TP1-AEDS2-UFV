If anyone could find the joy that true love brings a girl and boy  
We could we could you and I  
  
If anyone could ever say that their true love was here to stay  
We could we could you and I  
  
When youre in my arms I know youre happy to be there  
And just as long as Im with you Im happy anywhere  
  
If anyone could pray each night and thank the Lord that all is right  
We could darling we could you and I  
  
If anyone could find the joy
