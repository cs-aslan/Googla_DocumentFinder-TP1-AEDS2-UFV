Id like to think about her  
And the way she used to love me  
But I just cant live without her  
Cause her arms are not around me  
And the seasons getting later  
And my bodys getting colder  
And the vespers ring and Im all alone  
Without my love beside me  
  
Shed call me in the evenin  
And ask me to come over  
Shed be standing by the window  
With her hair down around her shoulder  
Wed talk a while and then shed smile  
Then shed lock the door  
And she would sit beside me  
And we would talk no more  
  
The bells would ring at six oclock  
And shed be in my arms  
Her head upon my shoulder gently resting  
And then shed wake and look at me  
Not knowing Id been watching  
Kiss me softly then drift off to sleep  
  
Shed call me in the evenin  
And ask me to come over  
Shed be standing by the window  
With her hair down around her shoulder  
Wed talk a while and then shed smile  
Then shed lock the door  
And she would sit beside me  
And we would talk no more
