Im falling in this pit of sorrow  
I really dont care anyway  
Happiness Im looking to borrow  
Even four last seconds okay  
Im starting to feel so so hollow  
Fill me up then go on your way  
I doubt Ill be leasing tomorrow  
So Ill just do my best anyway  
  
Hold me now  
Ive been knocking down  
Killing all these waves of shame  
Hold me down  
Feeling not so sound  
Wish I wasnt born today  
  
Im starting to break my devotion  
What does that mean anyway  
Running into signs interwoven  
So much that it gets in my way  
Im starting to feel so so hollow  
Fill me up then go on your way  
I doubt Ill be leasing tomorrow  
So Ill just do my best anyway  
  
Hold me now  
Ive been knocking down  
Killing all these waves of shame  
Hold me down  
Feeling not so sound  
Wish I wasnt born today  
  
Hold me now  
Ive been knocking down  
Killing all these waves of shame  
Hold me down  
Feeling not so sound  
Wish I wasnt born today
