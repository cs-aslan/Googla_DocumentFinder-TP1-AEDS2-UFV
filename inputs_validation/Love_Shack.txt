I was with you when you wrote it and I liked it better then back when I
thought you were mine and sang all your songs for me  
I liked this song when you were mine and I liked it better then  
The people in here they dont know that tonight Im one of them  
Heres to you and your voice on the juke box  
Heres to you I  
Im dancin at the love shack  
Shakin it down at the love shack  
Payin for being a fool like that  
At this run down place they call the love shack  
Now the damn country loves you  
Your voice belongs to them  
They bought it for a quarter and they sing along for a beer  
So just one more boys whaddya say  
One more if you pleaseand I might find a reason why you dont belong to me  
You can sing your song boy cause you sing it good  
Raise your glass to me when youre out on the road  
Cause tonight I paid my quarter and that still makes you mine  
Once I said that but now Im shakin at the love shack  
Heres to you and your voice on the juke box  
Heres to you  
Im dancin at the love shack  
Shakin it down at the love shack  
Payin for being a fool like that  
At this run down place they call the love shack
