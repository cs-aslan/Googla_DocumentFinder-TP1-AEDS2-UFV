Theyre taking me down my friend  
And as they usher me off to my end  
Will I bid you adieu  
Or will I be seeing you soon  
If what they say around here is true  
Then well meet again  
Me and you  
  
My time is at hand my dove  
Theyre gonna pass me to that house above  
Is heaven just for victims dear  
Where only those in pain go  
Well it takes two to tango  
We will meet again my love  
I know  
  
If youre in heaven then youll forgive me dear  
Because thats what they do up there  
If youre in hell then what can I say  
You probably deserved in anyway  
I guess Im gonna find out any day  
For well meet again  
And therell be hell to pay  
  
Your face comes to me from the depths dear  
Your silent mouth mouths yes dear  
Dark red and big with blood  
Theyre gonna shut me down my love  
Theyre gonna launch me into the stars  
Well all things come to pass  
Glory hallelujah  
  
This prayer is for you my love  
Sent on the wings of a dove  
An idiot prayer of empty words  
Love dear is strictly for the birds  
We each get what we deserve  
My little snow white dove  
Rest assured
