Are you going to help me or will you let me down  
Im looking for a true love but am I lost or found  
And will we cry in passion or will we cry in pain  
And will our lonely teardrops fill the world with rain  
  
Help me up dont you let me down  
Im gonna wake up in heaven not the cold cold ground  
  
Cant you hear the lovers crying in the night  
They spend their whole lives trying still cant get it right  
I dont know where were going but I guess well start  
And just to show that I mean it baby heres my heart  
  
Help me up dont you let me down  
Im gonna wake up in heaven not the cold cold ground  
  
Living on my feelings feelings all I know  
Baby once we touch it well never let it go  
  
Are you going to help me or will you let me down  
Im looking for a true love but am I lost or found  
And will we cry in passion or will we cry in pain  
And will our lonely teardrops fill the world with rain  
  
Help me up dont you let me down  
Im gonna wake up in heaven not the cold cold ground  
Help me up dont you let me down  
Im gonna wake up in heaven not the cold cold ground
