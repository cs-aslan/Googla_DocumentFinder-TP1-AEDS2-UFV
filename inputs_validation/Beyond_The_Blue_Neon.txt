Swingin doors  
Sawdust floors  
A heartache drowns as the whiskey pours  
Theres a hole in the wall  
From some free for all  
The ringin crack of that old cue ball  
  
Ive been fallin in here  
For what seems like years  
Where the tears and the lonely belong  
And wonder whats going on  
Beyond that blue neon  
  
Chorus  
I hear tell theres people out there who dont know  
What losin you means  
They dont have a heart  
That just falls apart  
At the mention of your name  
  
I heard they pretend  
The world didnt end  
Right when I knew you were gone  
I guess life still goes on  
Beyond that blue neon  
  
Chorus  
  
But its a quarter til two  
And I dont have a clue  
As to what Ill do from now til dawn  
I wonder whats going on  
Beyond that blue neon  
  
Lord whats going on  
Beyond that blue neon
