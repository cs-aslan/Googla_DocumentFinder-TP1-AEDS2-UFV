When it started out so easily  
She was lonely I was free  
I couldnt pass another lonely night on my own  
She just poured her life into a drink  
  
Looked at me said what do you think  
I said you need a little loving baby  
So I picked her up  
She gave me all the loving that I would ever need  
  
Oh she picked me up  
I didnt know her name  
Im playing love games  
Keep on playing love games  
  
Win or lose  
I get a broken heart  
Just playing love games  
Aint no doubt in my mind  
  
These love games  
Are tearing me apart  
Oh this game of love is burning me  
No way out that I can see  
  
Its like a fire I cant control I cant control  
Oh they pick me up  
Give me all the loving  
Ive ever need  
  
Yeah I love and run  
I never know their names  
Just playing love games  
I keep on playing love games  
  
Win or lose  
I get a broken heart  
Playing love games  
Aint no doubt in my mind  
  
That these love games  
Are tearing me apart  
Now my love is like a fire  
Burning me up  
  
And the flames  
Are getting higher  
Up to my heart  
Im playing love games  
  
Keep on playing love games  
Win or lose  
I get a broken heart  
Just playing love games  
  
Aint no doubt in my mind  
That these love games  
Are tearing me apart  
I keep on playing love games  
  
Keep on playing love games  
Whether I win  
Or whether I lose  
I end up with a broken heart  
  
Keep playin love games  
Aint no doubt about it  
Oh these love games  
Are tearing me apart
