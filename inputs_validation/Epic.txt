Can you feel it see it hear it today  
If you cant then it doesnt matter anyway  
You will never understand it cuz it happens too fast  
And it feels so good its like walking on glass  
Its so cool its so hip its alright  
Its so groovy its outta sight  
You can touch it smell it taste it so sweet  
But it makes no difference cuz it knocks you off your feet  
  
You want it all but you cant have it  
  
Its cryin bleedin lying on the floor  
So you lay down on it and you do it some more  
Youve got to share it so you dare it  
Then you bare it and you tear it  
  
You want it all but you cant have it  
Its in your face but you cant grab it  
  
Its alive afraid a lie a sin  
Its magic its tragic its a loss its a win  
Its dark its moist its a bitter pain  
Its sad it happened and its a shame  
  
You want it all but you cant have it  
Its in your face but you cant grab it  
  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it  
  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it  
  
You want it all but you cant have it  
Its in your face but you cant grab it  
  
Its it  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it  
Its it  
What is it
