Ive been out of weeks for ages  
Ive been on and off the train  
Ive been losing sheep  
And counting sleep  
And Ive drunk too much again  
But Ill take another cup  
Even though it dry me up  
Ooh though I know that I should pass  
I will take another glass  
  
The cellar is empty the cupboard is bare  
Im joining the church and taking to prayer  
The landlords complaining  
Cause the rent is outstanding  
And Old Mother Hubbards ran off with the chair  
Though I know its time to stop  
I will take another drop  
Though I know Im very sick  
I will take just one more sip  
  
Come on Captain punch my ticket  
Call my mothers name  
I once heard  
That a fly cant bird  
But I drunk too much again  
Though Ive really drunk a lot  
I will take another shot  
Though I know its a time to pass  
I will take just one more glass
