You were standin and I was thinkin  
Of all the time that I spend hangin around  
Situation could only get better  
I got closer to see what I found  
In the mornin movin easy  
Everything seems so right  
But when the night comes Ive been dreamin  
Dreamin bout leavin you one more time  
  
Girl you gave me good love  
But it aint quite right  
  
Mmm no I wont tell you  
That youre the only one for me  
And Id be a liar if I promised  
I could give you every single thing you ever need  
  
You gave me good love  
But it aint quite right  
  
Yeah you gave me good love  
But it aint quite right mmm  
  
Lookin back now seems so easy  
You were the best thing ever happened to me  
I cant complain  
It was worth every minute we had  
  
Cause you gave me good love  
But it aint quite right  
  
Yeah you gave me good love  
But it aint quite right
