If it was in your mind to really cut me down  
If it was in your plan to walk me in the ground  
You left with him last night then daylight told the rest  
And if you planned on hurtin me youre an overnight success  
  
I couldnt blame someone whod steal your love away  
Because I know what Ive lost and all hes gained  
Sweetheart last night I know he got the very best  
And if you planned on hurtin me youre an overnight success  
  
Can you handle all youve won from breaking my pride  
Will he stay with you and help you spend all the tears Ive cried  
Sweetheart I love you so and wish you happiness  
And if you planned on hurtin me youre an overnight success
