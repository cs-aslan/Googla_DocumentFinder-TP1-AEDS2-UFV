Blackout heatwave44 caliber homicide  
The bums drop dead and the dogs go mad  
In packs on the West Side  
Young girl standing on a ledge looks like another suicide  
She wants to hit those bricks  
Cause the news at six gotta stick to a deadline  
While the millionaires hide in Beekman Place  
The bag ladies throw their bones in my face  
I get attacked by a kid with stereo sound  
I dont want to hear it but he wont turn it down  
Life is tough but its just enough  
To hold back the tears until its closing time  
I survived Im still alive  
But Im getting close to the borderline  
Close to the borderline  
  
A buck three eighty  
Wont buy you much lately on the street these days  
And when you can get gas  
You know you cant drive fast anymore on the parkways  
Rich man poor man either way American  
Shoved into the lost and found  
The nonukes yell were gonna all go to hell  
With the next big meltdown  
I got remote control and a color TV  
I dont change channels so they must change me  
I got real close friends that will get me high  
They dont know how to talk and they aint gonna try  
I shouldnt bitch I shouldnt cry  
Id start a revolution but I dont have time  
I dont know why Im still a nice guy  
But Im getting close to the borderline  
Close to the borderline  
  
I thought Id sacrificed so many things  
I thought Id thrown them all away  
I didnt think I needed anything  
But you cant afford to squander what youre not prepared to pay  
  
I need a doctor for my pressure pills  
I need a lawyer for my medical bills  
I need a banker to finance my home  
But I need security to back my loan  
It isnt new what Im going through  
But everybody knows you got to break sometime  
Another night I fought the good fight  
But Im getting closer to the borderline  
Closer to the borderline
