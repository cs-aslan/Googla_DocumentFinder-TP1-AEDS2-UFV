Found on Heard  
  
Snow is falling  
Evening calling  
On knees a calling friends  
Cant you see  
Doesnt help to be  
The end  
  
Strolling through lost times with you  
What were we thinking of  
Could it be they jumped the queue  
In the winter of our love  
  
Baby we shouldve known  
Where we were going  
Shouldve known  
Where we were going  
Were in the sea of destiny  
In the winter of our love  
  
Do you know were alone out here  
What am I thinkin of  
Did this come to the time of year  
Called the winter of our love  
  
Baby we shouldve known  
Where we were going  
We shouldve known  
Where we were going  
Were in the sea of destiny  
In the winter of our love  
  
Oh I needed you so  
Ah you know I never never want to let you go
