Way down in the south of France all the ladies love to dance  
Kick their heels up in the air snap their fingers for romance  
  
While the gentlemen compare blonde or black or auburn hair  
Check the motion and the style Oh you know they take their while  
  
Hey to make the motion more complete yeah to make it more a treat  
Club DJour is where to go come on down and see the show  
  
When the rhythms really right you can burn it down tonight  
When the singings really fine sweet as Spanish sherry wine  
  
When the club cant contain the beat it just rolls out in the street  
Spills on down the avenue bringing dancers to their feet  
  
When its good as it can be it gets better wait and see  
Oh these folks dont ever sleep till theyre passed out in the street  
  
Way down in the south of France all the ladies love to dance  
Clap their hands and walk on air yeah the feelings really there  
Wont you take a little taste raise it to your charming face  
  
When the rhythms really right you can burn it down tonight  
When the singings really fine sweet as Spanish sherry wine  
  
Go on take a chance the ladies do love to dance
