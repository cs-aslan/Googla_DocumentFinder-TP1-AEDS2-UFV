Words and music by bob seger  
  
Wallys getting anxious thinkin bout tonight  
Bruce is all spiffy lookin wicked lookin right  
Eddies getting spruced  
And donnas getting loose  
Theyre passin round the bottle  
And theyre gettin good and juiced  
B G s winin dinin checkin talent at the club  
Skippers hauntin second lookin forward to his rub  
The busters from the country  
And the hitters from the shop  
Everybody wants to do the horizontal bop  
  
Someone bring the records  
Someone get the brew  
Someone get a house  
Buddy well know what to do  
Someone tell the ladies  
Someone make a deal  
If we cant find a house  
Then someone better find a field  
  
Grass is good as carpet  
Anyplace is fine  
Its time to get to rockin  
Babe its time to make it shine  
Tell em well be dancin  
Dancin till we drop  
Its time to get down and do the horizontal bop  
  
Theyre fillin up the corners  
Theyre fillin up the streets  
You can feel the tension  
You can almost feel the heat  
The musics gettin louder  
The beats gittin fast  
Summers finally made it  
Yeah its finally here at last  
  
The pony cars are cruisin on woodward avenue  
Go and try to passem  
Theyll smoke you if you do  
The whole towns shakin from the bottom to the top  
Everybody wants to do the horizontal bop  
The busters from the country  
And the hitters from the shop  
Everybody wants to do the horizontal bop  
Tell em well be dancin  
Dancin till we drop  
Everybody wants to do the horizontal bop
