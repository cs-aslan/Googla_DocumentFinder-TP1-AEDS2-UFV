I took a trip down to LAmerica  
To trade some beads for a pint of gold  
I took a trip down to LAmerica  
To trade some beads for a pint of gold  
LAmerica LAmerica LAmerica  
LAmerica LAmerica LAmerica  
  
Come on people dont you look so down  
You know the rain man is coming to town  
Hell change your weather change your luck  
And itll teach you how to  
Find yourself  
LAmerica  
  
Friendly strangers came to town  
All the people put them down  
But the women loved their ways  
Come again some other day  
Like the gentle rain  
Like the gentle rain  
That falls  
  
I took a trip down to LAmerica  
To trade some beads for a pint of gold  
I took a trip down to LAmerica  
To trade some beads for a pint of gold  
LAmerica LAmerica LAmerica  
LAmerica LAmerica LAmerica
