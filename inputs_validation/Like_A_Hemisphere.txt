He sees what Im lacking and he tells me without attacking my life  
He sees what Im needing and he gives me love without my pleading  
I see where his worries lie and I help him to decide  
He sees what Im missing that sometimes I need to be alone but sometimes I
need him to listen  
  
Like a hemisphere he surrounds me with a wisdom that astounds me  
Like the horizon he draws my eye to him and he makes me see just how lonely I
have been  
  
He knows what Im thinking without a sign without blinking my eyes  
I know what hes asking in our love there aint no masking no disguise  
I know what hes after its the truth and the laughter  
Why cant we see in ourselves all the beauty we see in everybody else  
  
Like a hemisphere he surrounds me with a wisdon that astounds me  
Like the horizon he draws my eye to him and he makes me see  
Like a radio he calls out to me in the middle of the night  
Like a hemisphere he is perfectly clear and he makes me see just how lonely I
have been  
  
I dont want to go through this life just getting by I want to fly  
I dont want to go through this life not asking why  
I need to know why we are here we are here together now  
I dont want to go through this life just to die  
Well you made me see just how lonely I have been  
  
Like a hemisphere he surrounds me with a wisdom that astounds me  
Like the horizon he draws my eye to him and makes me see  
Like a radio he calls out to me in the middle of the night  
Like a hemisphere he is perfectly clear and he makes me see just how lonely I
have been
