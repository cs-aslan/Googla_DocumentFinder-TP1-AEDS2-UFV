The sacred heart is bleeding  
Go tell the Holy Ghost  
That the junkie is still cheating  
To get the thing he needs the most  
  
Lady Luck has me covered  
Keeping her watchful eyes over me  
The lovers are discovered  
The charge is first degree  
  
Angel shes a killer  
Just flown in from the coast  
Makes the hit its a winner  
Leaves you dead as the post  
  
Sally took to playing poker  
The joker is her favorite card  
The drunk he cant stay sober  
He says its much too hard  
  
Meantime something seedy  
Was happening across the hall  
Somebody seemed to be groaning  
You could hear it through the wall  
  
The cops they came like lightning  
The bullets flew astray  
The noise it was frightening  
The crook he got away
