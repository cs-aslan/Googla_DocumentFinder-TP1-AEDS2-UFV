If you have the time would you keep me in mind  
Mind you I only want to treat you kind  
If youre all alone would you pick up the phone  
And dial the number that you know  
  
Will bring back the glow  
Thats been gone for such a long long time  
I feel like Im just acting like a fool  
Talking to my pillow once a happy fellow was I  
  
I know that Ill get over you if I have to but do I have to  
I dont want to spend another day being so far away  
From the girl that I love  
  
Its been gone for such a long long time  
I feel like Im just acting like a fool  
Talking to my pillow once a happy fellow was I  
I know that Ill get over you if I have to but do I have to  
I dont want to spend another day being so far away  
From the girl that I love  
  
If you have the time would you keep me in mind  
Mind you I only want to treat you kind  
If youre all alone would you pick up the phone  
And dial the number that you know  
Will bring back the glow  
Thats been gone for such a long long time
