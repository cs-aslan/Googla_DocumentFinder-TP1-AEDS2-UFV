I watch as it stops for a girl  
A moment elaborate and weak  
I am easy in her midst  
Why elaborate when theres no need to  
But I do all night  
My words ring like money off a bar  
Shes here asleep now  
One can only go alone so far  
One can only go alone so far  
I dream of a deep dark grave  
Seven feet below Saint Augustine  
And shes so easy in her breathing  
Why fall in love when theres no need to  
But we do all night  
Sleep like spoons and forget whom we are  
Shes here and shes wound down now  
One can only go alone so far  
One can only go alone so far  
But we do all night  
Sleep like spoons and forget whom we are  
Shes here and shes wound down now  
One can only go alone so far  
One can only go alone so far  
One can only go alone so far
