Tonight were listening to the sweetest song  
Tonight the melodies go on and on  
Well dream of love and the days gone by  
Then we sail to dawn  
  
And the lights of love will feel the sky  
Nobody loves you like I do sweet lady Jane  
Nobody feels the way I do may I explain  
Ill jump a train Ill steal an airplane  
To be with you  
  
Ill fight a samuraj if he made you cry  
Am I getting through   
  
Tonight I watched the people standing still  
Tonight its almost like I want them there  
I dont mind a bit  
  
Youre a just as long as I know the lady will be going home with me  
Nobody loves you quite the same  
Nobody loves you more my lady Jane
