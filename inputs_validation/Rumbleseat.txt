All the leaves are green  
All my friends are gone  
Im livin in my hometown  
I can barely get along  
I feel sorry for myself  
Thats an easy thing to do  
I feel sorry for the world  
I feel sorry for you  
Yes I am a pitiful sight  
I cant even get one thing right  
  
I know just what its like  
To be ridin in the rumbleseat  
Yes I know just what its like  
To be a big time rider in the rumbleseat  
  
Well I could have a nervous breakdown  
But I dont believe in shrinks  
I should be drunker than a monkey  
But I dont like to drink  
Call up some girls  
But Im afraid of the phone  
Im always talkin to myself  
I guess Im never alone  
Am I the only one that feels this way  
Id buy myself some stylish clothes  
But I sure hate to pay  
  
I know just what its like  
To be ridin in the rumbleseat  
Yes I know just what its like  
To be a big time rider in the rumbleseat  
  
The sun is coming up  
Just goin to bed  
I combed my hair with my pillow  
Still got some dreams left  
Tomorrow is a new day  
Gonna make these dreams come true  
Im gonna believe in myself  
Ill tell you what Im gonna do  
Im gonna stop puttin myself down  
Im gonna turn my life around  
  
Ill be ridin high  
With my feet kicked up in the rumbleseat  
Yeah well go for a drive  
And well be singin shotgun from that rumbleseat  
Yes Ill blow you a kiss  
And well be ridin big time in my rumbleseat
