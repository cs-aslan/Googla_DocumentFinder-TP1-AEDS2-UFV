When I hold you in my arms  
Its a breath of fresh air  
When I hold you in my arms  
I forget whats out there  
All those people with their faces  
Walkin up the street  
They dont have to say a thing  
Just look around and you see  
  
New buildings going up  
Old buildings coming down  
New signs going up  
Old signs coming down  
You gotta hold onto something in this life  
  
Well the older generation  
They got something to say  
But they better say it fast  
Or get outta the way  
All those gangsters with their crimes  
They make it look so good  
Weve been blowing up the planet  
Just like the old neighbourhood  
  
New buildings going up  
Old buildings coming down  
New signs going up  
Old signs coming down  
You gotta hold onto something in this life  
  
If I only had a heart  
It would beat all night for you  
If I only had a heart  
I would cry the whole day through  
When I hold you in my arms  
Its like a breath of fresh air  
When I hold you in my arms  
I forget whats out there  
  
Old hearts going up  
Old hearts coming down  
My feelings going up  
My feelings coming down  
You gotta hold onto someone in this life  
  
When I hold you in my arms  
Its a breath of fresh air  
When I hold you in my arms  
I forget whats out there
