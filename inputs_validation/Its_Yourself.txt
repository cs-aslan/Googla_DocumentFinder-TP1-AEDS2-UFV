Stepping out the back way  
Hoping nobody sees  
Feeling can be easy  
Think how I feel  
What will can you say  
What will you do  
Why cant you see  
Its yourself I love  
Dont you know Im not asking  
You must have made up your mind  
Is it worth the pain youre causing  
To those youre leaving behind  
What will you say  
What will you do  
Why cant you see  
Its yourself I love  
Dont you know Id like some answers  
You could give me a call  
I hardly know the reason  
And I really feel no good at all  
Where will you go  
Where will you be  
Where can I try  
Its yourself I love
