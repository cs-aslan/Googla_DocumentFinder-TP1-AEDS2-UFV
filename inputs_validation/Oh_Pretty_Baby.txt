Your just too good to be true  
Cant take my eyes off of you  
Youd be like heaven to touch  
I want to hold you so much  
At long last love has arrived  
And I thank God Im alive  
Youre just too good to be true  
Cant take my eyes off of you  
  
Pardon the way that I stare  
Theres nothing else to compare  
The site of you leaves me weak  
There are no words left to speak  
But if you feel like I feel  
Please let me know that its real  
Your just too good to be true  
Cant take my eyes off of you  
  
I need you baby and if its quite alright  
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights  
I love you baby trust in me when I say oh yay  
Oh pretty baby dont let me down I pray  
Oh pretty baby now that I found you stay  
And let me love you love you oh baby  
  
Your just too good to be true  
Cant take my eyes off of you

And I thank God Im alive  
Youre just too good to be true  
Cant take my eyes off of you

Oh pretty baby now that I found you stay  
And let me love you oh baby let me love you oh baby
