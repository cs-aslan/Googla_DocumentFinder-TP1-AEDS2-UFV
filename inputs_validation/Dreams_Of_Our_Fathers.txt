Oh Im choking Im choking  
On the smoke from this burning house  
I claw and I scrape  
But I cant seem to get out  
But who then who is this  
Thats scratching from the ground  
Oh its my world too  
But whos gold is this Im digging out  
  
Where we go when we go  
When were dead  
Is the verdict still out  
Do we get into line  
To line up with those long dead now  
With the muffled tears of sorrow  
Bones underground  
Is this time our time  
Yes it is  
Without of with this shadow of doubt  
  
I dont want to wake up  
Lost in the dreams of our fathers  
Oh its such a waste child  
To live and die for the dreams of our fathers  
Though I must confess yes  
My view is a wonder about this  
This love I possess love  
It must be the dreams of our fathers  
  
I want to go I want to run  
We turn so sure someones looking down  
Its haunting me haunting me  
Leaves us here to get out  
Though I dont believe I dont believe  
This flavor in my mouth  
Is from my tongue alone  
So bitter I want to spit it out  
  
I repeat these words  
They come out  
Under the blue light in the sky  
My empty pages are filling up  
With these wicked lies  
But I hear deep in myself  
An echo an echo  
Of empty empty emptiness  
Comes up and swells inside  
  
I dont want to wake up  
Lost in the dreams of our fathers  
Oh its such a waste child  
To live and die for the dreams of our fathers  
Though I must confess yes  
My view is a wonder about this  
This love I possess love  
It must be the dreams of our fathers  
  
Rain on my head  
Rain on my head  
Rain on me  
And then give me air  
Rain on my love  
Again and again  
Why cant I dream you away from me  
  
Look here look here  
Bloated floating  
Go belly down  
Belly up in the water  
But who is this here thats drowned  
We followed a drunken man  
He got us all spinning round  
But its like he swallowed himself  
And didnt leave us a way out  
  
I dont want to wake up  
Lost in the Dreams of our Fathers  
Oh its such a shame child  
To live and die for the Dreams of our Fathers  
Though I must confess yes  
My view is a wonder about this  
This love I possess love  
It must be the Dreams of our Fathers  
  
This love I possess love  
It must be the Dreams of our Fathers  
This love I possess love  
It must be the Dreams of our Fathers  
This love I possess love  
It must be the love of our fathers  
  
The dreams  
The dreams  
The dreams  
This love I possess love
