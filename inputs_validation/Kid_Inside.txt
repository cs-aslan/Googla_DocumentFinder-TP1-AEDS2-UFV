Talking One time only gulp if you dont  
Get it right this time tough shit tough shit  
Everybody ready tell me when say when your  
Rolling here a one a two a one two three die  
  
I press my face to the window  
I ran my fingers through my hair  
I watched my life go around in a circle  
And I realized that no body but me cares  
  
And I saw the hurt of my system  
And I felt the madness of our faults conforming  
And I walked around your house for hours  
And I could feel that you had me in some kinda of stranglehold  
  
And I dont know why you said those bad things about me  
Well it must be the way of protecting some kind of crazy pride  
Yeah you always direct your attention toward others  
And look you know its so easy to see that my wounds have been open  
Wide  
  
And you can just kid the kid inside so many times  
You can just kid the kid till he grabs you by the throat  
And is choking your young ass blind  
And you just kid the kid till youre walking on the tightrope in my my  
Mind   
Yeah you can just kid the kid inside so many times  
  
Well it wasnt funny no when I was bleeding all over the table  
Yeah now as I recall hey it wasnt funny at all  
But you kept on laughing huh like it was some kind of party yea  
Your always looking to belittle someone to make you feel tall  
  
Yea well its the same reaction in every situation  
Do you really think its so necessary to be so mean  
Yeah and its hard for me to justify my position  
Yeah when everything that Im saying can be said bad about Mr  
Springsteen yea  
  
chorus  
Yeah you know  
  
Yeah well I really really am the first to desire you   
And I feel so badly for his misery   
Well Ill dont throw five dollars to get into the kitty   
And Ill bet my ass that this problem isnt me  
  
Now now dont get me wrong wrong  
Hey now dont you feel sorry yeah  
Cause theres no one dead or alive that Id rather be  
And Ive learned to deal with my mortal existence  
And the moral is now dont you go believe nothing that you cant see  
Yeah  
  
chorus  
Yeah and you can just kid the kid inside so many times yea  
  
Ha ha ha well keep it
