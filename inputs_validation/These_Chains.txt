Everybody keeps talkin about you I cant lie anymore  
Been too long what went wrong Its a mystery  
Why you ever walked out that door  
What direction should I go Girl whats next for me I dont know  
  
Chorus  
Is it gonna get easier than tryin to break these chains around my heart  
Oh oh  
Does it ever get easier without you I cant pull these chains apart  
Oh oh  
  
I see your face when I look in the mirror  
I feel your touch but youre not there  
Wakin up had enough of this dream of mine girl this just isnt fair  
What direction should I go Girl whats next for me I dont know  
  
Chorus  
  
Day by day until they break oh oh  
  
Chorus x2
