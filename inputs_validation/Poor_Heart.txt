You wont steal my poor heart again  
You wont steal my poor heart again  
You wont steal my tape recorder  
Ill call the Lord and hell put you in the pen  
You wont steal that thing again  
  
I didnt even know your name or what was your game  
But stealin things has sure brought you to fame  
I want to know if you stole mine  
It was one of a kind and Im sayin if youre to blame  
Your life will never be the same  
  
I cant track you anymore  
Detective work has sure become a bore  
So tell me what you did with it  
And stop this shit give up yourself  
Before they come knockin at your door  
  
You wont steal my poor heart again  
You wont steal my poor heart again  
When I feel the blade of that Cupid sword  
Ill call the Lord and hell put you in the pen  
You wont steal that thing again  
You wont steal my poor heart again
