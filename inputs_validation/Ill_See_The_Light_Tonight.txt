Ive seen visions in the night passing through the stars  
Whos to run and whos to fight  
  
Evil tries to pull me in enslaving me to die  
Whos to lose and whos to win  
  
Ill see the light tonight  
Flashing through the sky  
Take my life tonight  
  
Now the chaos has begun people crying out  
Youre all alone you gotta run  
  
Victims of circumstance not able to decide  
No we never had a chance  
  
Ill see the light tonight  
Flashing through the sky  
Take my life tonight  
  
Evil tries to pull me in enslaving me to die  
Whos to lose and whos to win  
  
Victims of circumstance not able to decide  
No we never had a chance  
  
Ill see the light tonight  
Flashing through the sky  
Take my life tonight
