Sometimes I really want to be alone  
But thats one state Im never in  
Because I know that Ive got millions upon millions  
Of tiny onecelled organisms living on my skin  
  
Germs I rub and scrub until my flesh is raw and bleeding  
Germs But they just come right back again  
Germs I cant even seeem  
but I know theyre up to something  
Hey dont touch that  you dont know where its been  
  
Theyre all over me  
Theyre inside of me  
Cant getem off a me  
  
Im covered with microscopic bacteria  
What do they want from me  
Whatll they do to me  
Theres no escape for me  
Im crawling with microscopic bacteria  
  
Now if I ever dare to go to sleep  
Thats when they start their sneak attack  
In the morning I wake up in utter horror  
To find my teeth are covered with bacterial plaque  
  
Germs Cant get those parasitic creatures off my face  
Germs And theres more comin every day  
Germs I never said that they could camp out on my body  
I wish theyd pack their tiny little bags and move away  
  
Theyre all over me  
Theyre inside of me  
Cant getem off a me  
Im covered with microscopic bacteria  
What do they want from me  
Whatll they do to me  
Theres no escape for me  
Im crawling with microscopic bacteria  
  
Theyre creepin around my shorts  
Theyre under the bathroom sink  
Theyre ridin inside my car  
Theyre swimmin in every drink  
Theyre hidin between my toes  
Theyre lurkin in every kiss  
I gotem way up my nose  
In every orifice  
Im gonna show them whos boss  
Im gonna get even yet  
Just gimme some Lysol spray  
Just hand me a moist towelette  
Dont tell me Im paranoid  
I know that theyre after me  
Look under the microscope  
See  
  
Theyre all over me  
Theyre inside of me  
Cant getem off a me  
Im covered with microscopic bacteria  
What do they want from me  
Whatll they do to me  
Theres no escape for me  
Im crawling with microscopic bacteria  
  
Theyre all over me  
I can feelem all over me  
Over every part of me  
Microscopic bacteria  
I know theyre watching me  
Theyre always watching me  
Theyre coming after me  
Microscopic bacteria  
Wont somebody help  
Please somebody help me  
Youve got to believe me  
Theyre out to get me  
They want to control me  
They want to destroy me  
Theyre tryin to kill me  
It kind of upsets me
