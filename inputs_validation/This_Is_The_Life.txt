I eat filet mignon seven times a day  
My bathtubs filled with Perrier  
What can I say  
This is the life  
  
I buy a dozen cars when Im in the mood  
I hire somebody to chew my food  
Im an upwardly mobile dude  
This is the life  
  
They say that money corrupts you  
But I cant really tell  
I got the whole world at my feet  
And I think its pretty swell  
  
I got women lined up outside my door  
Theyve been waitin there since the week before  
Who could ask for more  
This is the life  
  
Youre dead for a real long time  
You just cant prevent it  
So if money cant buy happiness  
I guess Ill have to rent it  
  
Yeah every day I make the front page news  
No time to pay my dues  
I got a million pairs of shoes  
This is the life  
  
I got a solid gold Cadillac  
I make a fortune while I sleep  
You can tell Im a living legend  
Not some ordinary creep  
  
No way Im the boss  
The Big Cheese  
Yeah I got this town on its knobby little knees  
I can do just what I please  
This is the life  
  
Thats right Im the king  
Number One  
I buy monogrammed Kleenex by the ton  
I pay the bills  
I call the shots  
I grease the palms  
I buy the yachts  
  
One thing I can guarantee  
The best things in life they sure aint free  
Its such a thrill just to be me  
This is the life  
  
This is the life
