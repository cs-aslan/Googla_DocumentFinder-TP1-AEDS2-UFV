Born of the river  
Born of its everchanging neverchanging murky water  
Oh riverboat just rollin along through the great great greasy city Huck
standing like a Saint upon its deck  
If ya wanna catch a Saint  
then bait ya hook lets take a walk  
  
  
O come to me O come to me is what the dirty city  
say to Huck HUCK  
  
  
woahwoah woah woah  
woahwoah woah woah  
Saint Huck Huck  
  
  
Straight in the arms of the city goes Huck  
down the beckonin streets of oppotunity  
whistling his favorite riversong  
And a badblind nigger at the piano  
Buts a sinister blooo lilt into that singalong  
Huck senses somthings wrong  
  
  
Sirens wail in the city  
and lilUlysses turn to putty  
and Ol Man Rivers got a bone to pick  
and our boys hardly got a bone to suck  
He go woahwoah woah woah  
woahwoah woah woah  
Saint Huck Huck  
  
  
The moooon its huge cycloptic eye  
watches the city streets contract  
twist and cripple and crack  
Saint Huck goes on a dogsleg now  
Saint Huck goes on a dogsleg now  
  
  
You know the story  
Ya wake up one morning and you find youre a thug  
blowing smoke rings in some dive  
Ya fingers hot and itchin ya cracking ya knuckles  
Ya bull neck bristling  
Still Huck he ventures on whistling  
and Death reckons Huckleberrys time is up  
O woah woah woah  
Saint Huck  
O woah woah woah  
Saint Huck Huck  
  
  
Yonder go Huck minus pocketwatch an wallet gone  
Skin shrinkwraps his skeleton  
No wonder he gets thinner what with his coldnskinny dinners  
Saint HuckaSaint Elvis Saint HuckaSaint Elvis  
O you recall the song ya used to singalong  
Shifting the rivertrade on that ol steamer  
Life is but a dream  
  
  
But ya traded in the Mighty ol man River  
for the Dirty ol Man Latrine  
The brothel shift  
The hustlenthe bustle and the greenbacks rustle  
And all the sexycash  
And the randycars  
And the two dollar fucks  
O o o ya outa luck ya outa luck  
Woahwoahwoahwoah  
Saint Huck Huck  
  
  
This is the track of deception  
leads to the heart of despair  
Huck whistles like he just dont care  
but in the pocket of the jacket is a chamber  
Lead pellets sleeps in there  
Wake Up  
  
  
Now Huck whistles and he kneels  
and he lays down there  
See ya huck good luck  
A smoke ring hovers above his head  
And the rats and the dogs and the men all come  
and put a bullet through his eye  
and the drip and the drip and the drip of the Mississippi cryin And Saint
Huck hears his own Mississippi just rollin by him Woahwoahwoahwoah  
Woahwoahwoahwoah  
Saint Huck Saint Huck Saint Huck  
Woahwoahwoahwoah  
Woahwoahwoahwoah  
Saint Huck Saint Huck Saint Huck  
Woahwoahwoahwoah
