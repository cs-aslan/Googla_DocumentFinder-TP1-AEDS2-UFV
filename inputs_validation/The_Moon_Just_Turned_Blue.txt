Hang up the phone lose my number leave me alone so I can cry  
Dont touch my heart anymore its broken and sore  
And the moon just turned blue goodbye goodbye  
  
Just go on back to your old boyfriend hell take you home and I know why its
only fair I guess  
My heart wont die from this and the moon just turned blue goodbye  
Goodbye I said the moon must turned blue  
I was looking right at you looking sweet and unknown blue and shy  
  
Oh lord got me thinking baby  
Such a fancy lad she might be telling mighty fancy lies so count me out of
your triangle  
Im number three and honey I cant pretend  
I dont need heartache at all my heart cant take the fall and the moon just
turned blue  
  
Goodbye goodbye its only fair I guess  
And the moon just turned blue I said the moon  
It just turned blue baby bye bye
