Memories fill your harbor  
History to be made  
Jealousy in the cupboard  
You with me until the grave  
  
Midlife krysis you invited everyone  
You cant wake you cant wake from this nightmare  
  
Everyday is like the movies  
Third world war on the rise  
Take it in the city  
Making love to get high  
  
Midlife krysis you invited everyone  
You cant wake you cant wake from this nightmare  
  
I waste my time I waste my  
Dont waste my time dont waste my  
I waste my time I waste my  
Dont waste my time dont waste my  
  
Little Jane say youre in love with me  
Say it yourself  
Maybe then youll have some children  
Maybe you aint have one  
  
Midlife krysis you invited everyone  
You cant wake you cant wake from this nightmare  
You invited everyone  
You cant wake you cant wake from this nightmare
