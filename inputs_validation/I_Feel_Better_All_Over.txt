Well I feel better all over more than anywhere else baby when Im out with you  
Well I feel better all over more than anywhere else when you kiss me like you
do  
Well am as wild as a buck every time you cause me up  
You sure make me feel like a wheel  
Well I feel better all over more than anywhere else thats exactly how I feel  
  
Oh I feel better all over more than anywhere else  
When you whisper sweet nothings in my ear  
Oh I feel better all over more than anywhere else honey anytime that youre
near  
Well my heart beats double time when you hold your hand in mine  
You sure is a wonderful deal  
Well I feel better all over more than anywhere else thats exactly how I feel  
Oh thats exactly how I feel
