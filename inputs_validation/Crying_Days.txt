Force yourself to use your brain  
The only way to gain  
A lot of things are just a lie  
This world we love comes down in pain  
With hate and bloody games  
A questionmark up in the sky  
  
Look you cant keep away  
And you cant hide  
Tomorrow yesterday today   
  
Some people say well do it better  
Some people say everythings good  
Some people sing lets come together  
But nobody has ever brought it through  
Maybe you and me
