Bubba is a friend hes a beer drinkin buddy of mine  
But lately somethins happened that aint hard to define  
Bubbas got himself a cousin and Im gonna make her mine  
And shes brushin both his teeth  
And shes makin him biscuits and gravy I just know it  
And shes lovin him in that double wide late late at night  
  
Yknow I wish that I had Bubbas girl

Why cant I find a cousin like that  
Like bubbas girl

Why cant I find a cousin like that
