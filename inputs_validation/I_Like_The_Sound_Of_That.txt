I love hearing that shower turn on  
Bet theres nothin but a towel on you  
You sing along with some Timberlake bumpin  
But he aint got nothin on you  
I dont wanna hear the coffee pouring  
A goodbye kiss then lockin the door yeah  
Sounds like leavin you oh  
  
Its a little too loud on the highway  
I wanna pull back in your driveway  
Its way too quiet at my place  
Wanna come on over come on over  
I just wanna hear that ringtone  
I like it turned up when youre blowin up my phone  
Wanna hear you say come on over  
Cause when you tell me to come on over  
I like the sound of that  
  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound I like the sound of that  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound I like the sound of that  
  
Love the sound of the thunder rollin  
Makes you move a little closer to me  
Girl I bet that your neighbors hate us  
Cause we could laugh all night and never sleep  
We can worry bout the world in the mornin  
Light up a candle lock the door  
Wanna stay right here with you yes I do  
  
Its a little too loud on the highway  
I wanna pull back in your driveway  
Its way too quiet at my place  
Wanna come on over come on over  
I just wanna hear that ringtone  
I like it turned up when youre blowin up my phone  
Wanna hear you say come on over  
Cause when you tell me to come on over  
I like the sound of that  
  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound I like the sound of that  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound I like the sound of that  
  
Turn your radio on baby turn down the lights  
Im aint goin nowhere Im all yours tonight  
  
Its a little too loud on the highway  
I wanna pull back in your driveway  
Its way too quiet at my place  
Wanna come on over come on over  
I just wanna hear that ringtone  
I like it turned up when youre blowin up my phone  
Wanna hear you say come on over  
Cause when you tell me to come on over  
I like the sound of that  
  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound I like the sound of that  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound I like the sound of that  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound I like the sound of that  
Yes I do  
I like the sound of that  
Oh
