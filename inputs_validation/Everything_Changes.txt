Everybody wants you you got it goin on  
And you know its not fair  
All the ladies want to profess their love to you  
And yet you really dont care  
You might think you have everything  
Whether you do or not I think that you forgot that  
Everything changes left to right cold gets hot  
Everything changes one day will turn to night  
Whether you like it or not  
Now I am no authority  
But Ive been around and Ive seen a lot  
Loves the one priority  
Either settle down or lose the little youve got  
We dont have forever  
Its now or never so shoot your best shot  
Everything changes left to right cold gets hot  
Everything changes one day will turn to night  
Whether you like it or not  
Its no good to keep on holdin back  
All those good emotions Ill be there for you  
You might think you have everything  
Whether you know or not I think that you forgot that
