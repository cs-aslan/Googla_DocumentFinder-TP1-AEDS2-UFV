Go to the woman like a switchblade knife  
Baby says were gonna break the law tonight  
Oohif your daddy could see you now  
RocknRoll rebel on a jailbreak run  
This operator but a little high strung  
Theres one in every crowd  
You got coming to you it happens every time  
Thats what you get for a life of crime  
You got it coming to you if you cross the line  
And you cant back up when the going gets tough  
And if you fly that high youd better get some  
Slow down sister youre burn burn burnin at the speed of light  
Better slow down sister  
Put on tile brakes or you wont get through the night  
She dont love you gonna shoot to thrill  
I tell you that little girls kiss could kill  
She got me standing on a one way street  
Cant break the chains the ties that bind  
Slave to the rhythm and my hearts in time  
Beware the taste is bittersweet  
When the lights go down and you hit the ground  
Itll happen so fast  
Slow down sister  
I said look out now danger in a little girls eyes  
Slow down sister  
Well youre gonna find out theres trouble in paradise  
that aint nice  
Youll never stop your butterfly ball  
in the black you think youve done it all  
Come on now baby you know its true  
You want all the money and the price of fame  
Ride to glory on another mans name  
Now theres a lesson here for you  
Youd better slow down sister  
I said look out now theres danger in a little girls eyes  
Slow down sister slow down slow down  
Well youre gonna find out theres troubletrouble in paradise  
I said slow
