Pretty little mongo  
Everybody wants her toilet  
Same old story  
She wont let nobody near it  
  
The way she teases them  
Its such a shame  
Shes got all the huboons  
Crying out her name  
  
Soo bawls soo bawls  
Shes got em howling  
Shes got em growling  
Soo bawls soo bawls  
  
Shes got em going clean out of their minds  
Soo bawls soo bawls  
There aint a man in town who wouldnt  
Have her for his daughter  
  
Theys all trade their brains for  
One taste of her toilet water  
1234 tell the people what she wore  
Theyre all trying hard to call her up  
  
But her phones been disconnected  
Since she sold her butt
