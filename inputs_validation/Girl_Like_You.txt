Boy meets girl in prime of life  
Blinded by big city lights  
Im on fire and youre the flame  
You inspire the road I take  
You take me to a better place  
Youre the sun and Im the rain  
  
Youre all that I need to make me believe  
Im over the edge but Im not afraid  
Cause I know its true  
  
With a girl like you like you to be by my side  
With a girl like you love me for the inside  
With a girl like you I set the scene to follow  
With a girl like you love for all tomorrow  
With a girl like  
You  
  
You were raised to be so good  
I grew up misunderstood  
We were distant worlds apart  
Feels so right its meant to be  
Shootin stars and chemistry  
They unite a beating heart  
  
Youre pullin me up I cant get enough  
Comin on strong but Im not that tough  
But I know its true  
  
With a girl like you like you to be by my side  
With a girl like you love me for the inside  
With a girl like you I set the scene to follow  
With a girl like you love for all tomorrow  
With a girl like  
  
You  
You  
  
With a girl like you like you to be by my side  
With a girl like you love me for the inside  
With a girl like you I set the scene to follow  
With a girl like you love for all tomorrow  
With a girl like  
You
