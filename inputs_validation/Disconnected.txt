Disconnected its the way that I wanted it to be  
The Cult Electric is my favorite record of the week  
Cause Im not feeling sweet  
  
But I cant say that when everyone is so judgmental  
And I cant play back all the times when you were gentle  
Cause even you cant be true  
  
Its astounding what love can do to a city  
Laurel Canyon was the best place for you and me to be  
I chose the curtains and I dreamed a dream of domesticity  
What a freak you made of me  
  
Now Im on Zoloft because you told me I was crazy  
And I wont jump cause now I know youd never catch me  
And I cant leave you because you swore youd never let me  
But even you talk shit too  
  
Its January when I jumped the fence of your backyard  
Finish the fairy tale that you werent drunk enough to start  
Its kind of scary when your lover leaves you for a movie star  
But Im still in the dark  
  
But you have trained to watch my back and drop my standards  
And you have shamed me since the first time you were with her  
And you cant make me love your band or buy your records  
Cause you have tainted my respect for your adventures  
  
And you will never have the chance to trace my features  
And you will never make me feel like such a loser  
And you can have the past cause Im in love with the future  
  
Im in love with the future  
  
And I have met a boy  
Who makes you look so shallow Im in love with the future  
And there is so much time  
And so much space to travel Im in love with the future  
And I will make the climb and I will kiss the gravel Im in love with the  
Future  
  
Touch the sky Its kinda scary  
And I will kiss the gravel Im in love with the future  
  
Touch the sky Its kinda scary  
And I will kiss the gravel  
  
Ill touch the sky  
Ill touch the sky  
Watch me watch me  
Ill touch the sky  
Ill touch  
The sky the sky
