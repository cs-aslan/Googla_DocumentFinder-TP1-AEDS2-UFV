I never saw you before  
I never sound strained before  
Now Im at your door  
And I hope youre unusual  
Very unusual  
  
Now Im at your door  
And when you nicely ask me in  
Im staring at your shoes  
And I dont wonder why  
I feel like a horse  
We can stray out on the open range  
Missing me every day with its hidden claws  
Spring snow  
  
And when you brush me  
Brush me with your eyes  
I think youve noticed that  
I dont want to be a bad guy anymore  
I never saw you before  
But youre unusual  
And now Im at your door  
  
I feel safe and warm  
I feel  
I feel  
I feel  
I feel  
Like a horse  
Ha ha ha ha  
Whats this
