I must leave from fear they send  
Journey with the dawn  
As I take the winding road  
Bow my head forlorn  
Now I must go  
  
Im banished in exile  
I wander this land  
No faith in the future  
Im in their command  
  
Cross over the mountains  
And valleys so wide  
I walk as I wonder  
With hope by my side  
  
All my friends are far away  
How I miss my home  
Where do I find peace of mind  
Guide me as I roam  
I cry for you  
  
Im banished in exile  
To meet their demand  
Rejected messiah  
They dont understand  
  
Im searching for something  
Thats lost in my heart  
God knows Im a sinner  
Im falling apart  
  
If this is my destiny  
Ive got to believe  
The passion inside me  
Has left me to bleed  
  
Im banished in exile  
I wander this land  
No faith in the future  
Im in their command  
  
Cross over the mountains  
And valleys so wide  
I walk as I wonder  
With hope by my side  
  
If this is my destiny  
Ive got to believe  
This passion inside of me  
Has left me to bleed
