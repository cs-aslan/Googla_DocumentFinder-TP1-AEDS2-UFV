Lipstick and lashes the traces of stardom  
Lit up on a billboard so everyone sees them in neon  
Behind a counter she stares out the window  
Up at the billboard thats like a reminder in neon  
  
She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror  
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon  
For two cents of danger shed trust anybody  
Shed smoke like a gun if it meants she might wind up   
  
Chorus  
In neon the dreams in the light of a promise that dies  
A shimmering city a glimmer of hope and a lie  
In neon the names gone theres no reason why anymore  
Trust them and wind up alone behind a locked door  
  
In neon in neon  
  
Pictures and patterns the touches of glamour  
Cut into fashion that flashs above em in neon  
A hot cup of coffee held in her fingers  
A perfect complexion that lingers above her in neon  
  
She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror  
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon  
For a shot at the title shed slip into something  
Shed smoulder like ashes if it meant she might wind up   
  
In neon  
  
Chorus
