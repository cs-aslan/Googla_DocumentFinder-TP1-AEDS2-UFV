Shes got the magic touch  
And youre walkin around in a dream  
Shes got the magic touch  
Oh no but it aint what it seems  
You feel theres a fire burnin  
When she feels cold inside  
But you still want her much too much  
  
One day when she leaves you lonely  
You wont be satisfied wont be satisfied  
Until you feel her magic touch  
Her magic touch her magic touch her magic touch  
  
Shes got the magic touch  
And youre under a spell that shes cast  
Shes got the magic touch  
Oh no but it aint gonna last  
  
Shes keepin her love light shinin  
To blind you from her lie blind you from her lie  
But you still need her oh so much  
  
And when she says shes leaving  
Thats when you realize when you realize  
How much you need her magic touch  
Her magic touch her magic touch her magic touch  
  
And in the night in the crowd  
Shell be there  
As she prances by your watch  
While your dreams fade away  
  
Shes got the magic touch  
And youre walkin around in a dream  
Shes got the magic touch  
Oh no but it aint what it seems  
  
One day when she leaves you lonely  
Youll miss her oh so much  
Until you feel her magic touch feel her magic touch  
Her magic touch her magic touch  
Feel her magic touch her magic touch  
  
Shes got the magic touch I really want her  
Shes got the magic touch and I still need her  
Shes got the magic touch I really want her  
Shes got the magic touch and I really want her  
Shes got the magic touch and I still need her
