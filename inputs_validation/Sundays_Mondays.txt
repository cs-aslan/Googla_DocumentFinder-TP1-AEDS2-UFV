The sun is out  
The clouds are slowly going  
And now my heart is growing fast  
So lets get up  
Put on you hat and clothing  
Lets take a trip and lose our minds  
  
Lets go walking through the park today  
I love sunday mondays any day  
When the skies are blue and its not grey  
Ill take sunday mondays any every day  
  
Sometimes its fun  
To just escape and run  
And leave the troubled world behind  
So lets get lost  
And get our juices flowing  
And lets go see what we can find  
  
Lets go walking through the park today  
I love sunday mondays any day  
When the skies are blue and its not grey  
Ill take sunday mondays any every day  
  
Lets go walking through the park today  
I love sunday mondays any day  
When the skies are blue and its not grey  
Ill take sunday mondays any every day
