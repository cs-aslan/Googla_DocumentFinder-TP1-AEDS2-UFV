A flower ladys daughter  
As sweet as holy water  
Said Im the school reporter  
Please teach me well I taught her  
  
Two fingered levid sister  
Said Peace I stopped I kissed her  
Said Im a male resister  
I smiled and just unzipped her  
  
High diving Chinese trender  
Black hair and black suspender  
Said Please me no surrender  
Just love to feel your Fender  
  
All of you know that the girls of the road  
Are like apples you stole in your youth  
All of you know that the girls of the road  
Been around but are versed in the truth  
  
Stoneheaded Frisco spacer  
Ate all the meat I gave her  
Said would I like to taste hers  
And even craved the flavor  
  
Like marronglaced fish bones  
Oh lady hit the road  
  
All of you know that the girls of the road  
Are like apples you stole in your youth  
All of you know that the girls of the road  
Been around but are versed in the truth
