If you think that youre strong  
Wanna fight well come on  
And line up  
When the goin gets tough  
And your talk aint enough then come on  
And line up  
We gotta get up get out before they get us down  
Cause livin up against the wall yeah  
Has got us locked up  
Come on and line up  
So dont be surprised  
When they pull the wool over your eyes  
Yeah dont get funked up  
If you got all the stuff  
And you cant get enough  
Then line up  
If youre out on a limb  
And you wanna come in  
Then line up  
Your heads down sittin round  
Pick yo face up off the ground  
And get yourself together baby  
And learn to stand tough  
Come on an line up  
We better get to it  
Instead of just standin around  
Its time to get down  
If youre playin to win  
Then your only way in  
Is line up  
If we all wanna live  
Then we all gotta give  
Line up  
We gotta get up get out  
Before they get us down  
Cause livin up against the wall yeah  
Has got us locked up

Instead of just standin around

If you got all the stuff  
And you cant get enough  
Then line up  line up

Wanna fight well come on
