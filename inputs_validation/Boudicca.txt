Intro  
Gonna cause a stink  
Wont be the first to blink  
Im not who you think  
Dont mess with me Im Boudicca  
  
Verse 1  
My husband Presotagus died  
He was a Celtic king  
I was his queen so due to me  
Was half of everything  
  
Verse 2  
Roman law gave half to me  
So half was what they got  
Till their nasty soldiers came  
And took the blessed lot  
  
Verse 3  
Hey mister  
I say you got the wrong end of the stick  
His answer turned this sister  
Into one angry chick  
  
Chorus  
No man Romanll  
Push around this woman  
You wont get far with Boudicca  
Foeman yeoman  
Smash the Roman foeman  
All say yah Yah Boudicca  
  
Verse 4  
I built a massive army  
Headed straight for the city  
Beat em all with ease  
And like me it wasnt pretty  
  
Verse 5  
Chopped em and hacked but  
What made their red blood curl  
Bad enough being beaten  
But beaten by a girl  
  
Verse 6  
Wacked em smacked em  
Boy how we attacked em  
Near and far ha ha ha  
Flayed em slayed em  
Up and down parade em  
Boudicca Toughest by far  
  
Hook  
Colchester London St Albans  
Everybody talk about dead Romans  
  
Verse 7  
We marched on up the Roman road  
Thats known as Watling Street  
They trapped us in the forest  
Then thrashed us to our defeat  
  
Verse 8  
By now youd guessed Im not the kind  
Of girl to sit and cry  
Be sold a slave to Romans  
You know Id rather die  
  
Verse 9  
They tried to take me prisoner  
So I led the Roman boys on  
Instead of giving in to them  
I swallowed special poison  
  
Chorus  
Martyr smarter  
Capturer nonstarter  
This was our last hurrah  
Slaughtered dismembered  
Our tribe always remember
