Well Im chasin the blues  
Right out of my mind  
Im leavin my cares  
And worries behind  
  
Cause Im on my way  
Im leavin town today  
My lonesome old heart  
Is broken into  
  
Ive been walkin the floor  
Every night over you  
But our love is all gone  
Im movin on  
  
Im aleavin town today  
I got no love no cares  
Just heartaches  
Im leavin them all behind  
  
Like the sun and the moon  
And the stars above  
Were gonna be one of a kind  
Well Im movin along  
  
I gotta be free  
Ill find a new love  
Wherever Ill be  
But my old love is gone  
  
Im movin on  
Im aleavin town today  
I got no love no cares  
No heartaches  
  
Im leavin them all behind  
Like the sun and the moon  
And the stars above  
Were gonna be one of a kind  
  
Well Im movin along  
I gotta be free  
Ill find a new love  
Wherever Ill be  
  
But my old love is gone  
Im movin on  
Im aleavin town today  
Im leavin this town today
