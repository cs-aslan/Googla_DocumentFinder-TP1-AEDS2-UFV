Time is me and I should know  
I knew this several months ago  
I knew more than I do now  
For Ive been turned around somehow  
  
Relax the world will spin beside itself and suck you in  
With threats and hopes beyond compare  
  
I change the landscape as I pass  
Meandering from sand to glass  
I suction there for one whole day  
Until the feeling goes away  
  
I dont need these orbits in my life  
Revolve and cycle through  
Dont keep coming back for more  
  
I dont need this circular design  
Wheel and spin away from me  
Youve been by here before  
  
Ive lost my mind  
Ive lost my way  
Im bound to lose  
You wonder where I am
