From Hank to Hendrix  
I walked these streets with you  
Here I am with this old guitar  
Doin what I do  
  
I always expected  
That you should see me through  
I never believed in much  
But I believed in you  
  
Can we get it together  
Can we still stand side by side  
Can we make it last  
Like a musical ride  
  
From Marilyn to Madonna  
I always loved your smile  
Now were headed for the big divorce  
Californiastyle  
  
I found myself singin  
Like a longlost friend  
The same thing that makes you live  
Can kill you in the end  
  
Can we get it together  
Can we still stand side by side  
Can we make it last  
Like a musical ride  
  
Sometime its distorted  
Not clear to you  
Sometimes the beauty of love  
Just comes ringin through  
  
New glass in the window  
New leaf on the tree  
New distance between us  
You and me  
  
Can we get it together  
Can we still walk side by side  
Can we make it last  
Like a musical ride
