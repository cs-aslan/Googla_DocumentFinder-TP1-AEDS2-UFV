Hey everybody take a look at me  
Ive got street credibility  
I may not have a job  
But I have a good time  
With the boys that I meet down on the line  
  
I dont need you  
So you dont approve  
Well who asked you to  
Hey jerk you work  
This guys got better things to do  
Hell  
I aint never gonna work get down in the dirt  
I choose to cruise  
Gonna live my life sharp as a knife  
Ive found my groove and I just cant lose  
Im style from head to toe  
Cool cat flash gonna let you know  
Im a soul boy Im a dole boy  
Take pleasure in leisure I believe in joy  
  
Chorus  
Wham  
Bam  
I am  
A man  
Job or no job  
You cant tell me that Im not  
Do  
You  
Enjoy what you do  
If not  
Just stop  
Dont stay there and rot  
  
Party nights and neon lights  
We hit the floors we hit the heights  
Dancing shoes and pretty girls  
Boys in leather kiss girls in pearls  
Hot damn everybody lets play  
So they promised you a good job no way  
One two three rap  
Seemon everybody dont need this crap  
  
Chorus  
  
If youre a pub man  
Or a club man  
Maybe a jet black guy with a hip hifi  
A white cool cat with a trilby hat  
Maybe leather and studs is where youre at  
Make the most of every day  
Dont let hard times stand in your way  
Give a wham give a bam but dont give a damn  
cause the benefit gang are gonna pay  
  
Now reach up high and touch your soul  
The boys from wham will help you reach that goal  
Its gonna break your mamas heart so sad  
Its gonna break your daddys heart too bad  
Just throw the dice and take
