What would possess you to justify  
Such dark and twisted ways  
What kind of monster would come to feast  
When the devil shows his face  
What does it take for life to change  
And a mind to lose control  
Cruelly left you to suffer the blame  
After all the lies you told  
  
I am finding courage in my darkest hour  
I am bent not broken  
Calling out  
  
Someone save me look behind the veil  
Please dont walk away  
Someone save me bring me home tonight  
I cant face another day  
  
Can you see the stranger  
Hiding in plain sight  
Feeding on the chaos  
When the lightning strikes  
Theres no redemption  
Theres no being saved  
Theres no salvation  
For a soul depraved  
  
You are finding promise in your finest hour  
You are bent not broken  
Calling out
