Susanna Clark  
  
If theyll play another love song  
And if that Miller Highlife light stays dim  
And if youll keep my glass full of whiskey  
Ill whisper words I wish Id said to him  
  
Just ask me to dance all the slow ones  
Hold me close and take me cross the floor  
Ill gently lay my head on your shoulder  
And pretend this never happened before  
  
I dont want to hear a sad story  
We both already know how it goes  
So if youll be my tall dark stranger  
Ill be your San Antone Rose  
  
I wish I could tell you I love you  
I wish that he werent always on my mind  
I wishes were fast trains to Texas  
Id ride and Id ride how Id ride
