Tears from my eyes keep on falling  
cause you are leaving leaving with another  
Things that weve done together  
Ill always remember though youre with another baby  
Tears from my eyes keep on falling  
cause you are leaving leaving with another  
Things that weve done together  
Ill always remember though youre with another baby  
  
Ive done everything one man can do girl  
Said every word one man can say  
The thing that we had has gone astray girl  
Im missing you from day to day  
  
Tears from my eyes keep on falling  
cause you are leaving leaving with another  
Things that weve done together  
Ill always remember though youre with another baby
