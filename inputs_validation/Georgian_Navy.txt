Sometimes its best to die  
If youre hit by the enemy  
Youre lucky to survive Magic sponge Magic saw  
  
Nelson  
Youve got to wait to fight  
Only do it when its right  
Got to break their line  
Theyll be swimming in the brine  
Pick your time to shoot  
Then theyre ships were going to loot  
Going to be a hoot  
For scurvy have some fruit
