Leaves are fallin down on the beautiful ground  
I heard a story from the man in red  
He said the leaves are fallin down  
Such a beautiful sound  
Son I think youd better go ahead  
But you always hold your head up high  
Cause its a long long long way down  
This town was meant for passing through  
Boy it aint nothin new  
Now go and show em that the world stayed round  
But its a long long long way down  
  
You better run for the hills  
Before they burn  
Listen to the sound of the world  
Dont watch it turn  
I just want to show you what I know  
And catch you when the current  
Lets you go  
  
Or should I just get along with myself  
I never did get along with everybody else  
Ive been tryin hard to do whats right  
But you know I could stay here  
All night  
And watch the clouds fall from the sky  
This river is wild  
This river is wild  
  
Run for the hills before they burn  
Listen to the sound of the world  
Dont watch it turn  
I shake a little  
Sometimes Im nervous when I talk  
I shake a little  
Sometimes I hate the line I walk  
I just wanna to show you what I know  
Catch you when the current  
Lets you go  
  
Or should I just get along with myself  
I never did get along with everybody else  
Ive been trying hard to do whats right  
But you know I could stay here  
All night  
And watch the clouds fall from the sky  
Because this river is wild  
Godspeed ya boy  
This river is wild  
  
Now Adams taking bombs and hes stuck on his mom  
Because that bitch keeps tryin to make him pray  
Hes with the hippie in the park combing over the dark  
Just tryin to get some of that littlegirl play  
  
You better run for the hills before they burn  
Listen to the sound of the world  
Dont watch it turn  
I just want to show you what I know  
And catch you when the current  
Lets you go  
  
Or should I get along with myself  
I never did get along with everybody else  
Ive been tryin hard to do whats right  
But you know I could stay here  
All night  
And watch the clouds fall from the sky  
This pain is hell in me tonight  
Because this river is wild  
Godspeed ya boy  
This river is wild  
This river is wild  
Godspeed ya boy  
This river is wild  
  
And cars are everywhere  
Raisin dust at the fairground  
I dont think I ever seen so many headlights  
But theres somethin pullin me  
The circus and the crew  
Well theyre just passin through  
Makin sure the merry still goes round  
But its a long long long way down
