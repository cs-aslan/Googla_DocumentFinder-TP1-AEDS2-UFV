I smoked Consulates and Park Drive drank Nookie Brown  
Learned how to skive  
Polo mints to hide my breath from my mum  
Did a little weed cause it felt like fun  
Did a little bit of speed if my friend had some  
Nicked Volkswagen badges Im a Beastie Boys son  
Me so horny me so young and I still get my washing done  
Auntie Joe died of cancer God didnt have an answer  
Rhythm was a dancer  
Any room for a chancer Thats me in the corner thanks sir  
I wore a troop track suit British Knights shoes Kangol hat like LL Cools  
Before I was avin it avin it large  
They nicked the BMX from out my garage  
Knew it was Tier from off the estate cuz every time hed see me hed smile
like we were mates  
From then on in Id have to walk to me Nans  
And Id dream my dreams through a sea of prams  
Like a hooligan on the football stands  
And Id throw the vs to Leeds and West Ham  
Then I ran I ran so far away down Scotia Road to a taxi bay  
Then I ran again cuz I couldnt pay a Muslim didnt get his fare that day  
I apologize today  
  
Things are better when they start  
Thats how the 80s broke my heart  
  
And who are you calling poof You like Wham man I hate that stuff  
And then my grandad died and left a hole in the family and lots of women had
to nanny me  
School was a laugh they didnt have ADD thick was the term they used for me  
over and over  
Repeatedly  
over and over  
  
Take my breath away take my breath away  
Bidly bidly bidly bong  
Pass it on the left hand side right turn Clyde  
  
That girl in the fourth year got pregnant and she was raised Catholic
brilliant  
I cried she cried we cried her youth died  
Drank cider in the cemetery  
The year above us had discovered E and I said it werent for me  
1250 I could rob me mums purse and buy one off chalcky  
Met a girl on Monday drank fizzy pop on Tuesday  
Fingered her on Wednesday and on Thursday and Friday and on Saturday  
Dumped by Sunday  
  
Things are better when they start  
Thats how the 80s broke my heart  
The wonder years Ive played my part  
Thats how the 80s broke my heart  
  
Like I said I lost my virginity to a girl called AnneMarie well she said
she fancied me  
And then she said fuck me and I thought fuck me Im all talk and itll be
over too quickly  
And it was but I couldnt care less Id seen a girls partmade a mess on her
dress oh yes  
Youre now rocking with the best second person in my year that had seen a
breast  
Im in my 30s now and Im still impressed  
Where are the Falklands mum And what have they done  
Where do girls come from Where do girls come from Where do girls come from  
  
Its the 80s what you looking at ya mong  
So young so long so young so long  
Too short so long  
What you looking at ya mong  
Too short so long too short so long  
So long
