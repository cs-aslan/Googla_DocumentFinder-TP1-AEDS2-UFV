You know I love my music its really all I got  
I never really cared that much if I was cold or hot  
Now I got a job to do I dont want to begin  
Ive gotta write a sad song for my friend  
He was not like me no he tried a lot but just like me he cried a lot  
Oh I never thought Id have to cause that aint what Im in  
Ive gotta write a sad song for my friend  
She was quite a lady and he was quite a guy  
They were quite a couple it was quite a cry  
They used to sit and laugh a lot cause I like to pick and grin  
They helped me write a sad song for my friend  
He was not like me unverified  
I dont wanna sing no sad songs for my friend
