Paint a rumour  
Whats it gonna spread  
Paint a rumour  
See the place go red  
I could tell you something  
Promise not to tell  
I could tell you something  
Promise not to sell  
Its a secret  
Its a secret  
Its a secret  
Its a secret  
I have heard a whisper  
I have heard a whisper  
What did it say  
I heard a whisper  
Make it go away  
Dont believe a word of it  
Promise not to tell  
Dont repeat a word of it  
Promise not to sell  
Its a secret  
Its a secret  
Its a secret  
Its a secret  
Its a secret  
Its a secret  
Its a secret  
Its my secret  
Its a secret  
Its a secret  
Paint a rumour  
Paint a rumour  
See the place go red  
I could tell you something  
I could tell you something  
Promise not to sell  
Paint a rumour  
Paint a rumour  
Make it go away  
I could tell you something  
I could tell you something  
Promise not to sell  
Paint a rumour  
Whats it gonna spread  
Paint a rumour  
I could tell you something  
Promise not to tell  
I could tell you something

I could tell you something  
Promise not to tell

Its a secret
