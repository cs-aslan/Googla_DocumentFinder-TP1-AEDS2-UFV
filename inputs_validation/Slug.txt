Lying in bed one summers night  
Everything wasnt alright  
Something started crawling on me  
A SLLyouG  
I saw her walking in the woods last night  
And I knew something wasnt right  
SLyouG  
A no no no no whyd she have to goohohoh  
I saw her walking in the woods last night  
And I knew something wasnt right  
SLyouG  
A no no no no whyd she have to goohohoh  
And I know that if I had her back today  
Yeah I know  
I know  
I know  
I know  
Why is it always this way
