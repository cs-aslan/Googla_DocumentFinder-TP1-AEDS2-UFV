There were nights when the wind was so cold  
That my body froze in bed  
If I just listened to it  
Right outside the window  
  
There were days when the sun was so cruel  
That all the tears turned to dust  
And I just knew my eyes were  
Drying up forever  
  
I finished crying in the instant that you left  
And I cant remember where or when or how  
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made  
  
But when you touch me like this  
And you hold me like that  
I just have to admit  
That its all coming back to me  
When I touch you like this  
And I hold you like that  
Its so hard to believe but  
Its all coming back to me  
Its all coming back its all coming back to me now  
  
There were moments of gold  
And there were flashes of light  
There were things Id never do again  
But then theyd always seemed right  
There were nights of endless pleasure  
It was more than any laws allow  
Baby Baby  
  
If I kiss you like this  
And if you whisper like that  
It was lost long ago  
But its all coming back to me  
If you want me like this  
And if you need me like that  
It was dead long ago  
But its all coming back to me  
Its so hard to resist  
And its all coming back to me  
I can barely recall  
But its all coming back to me now  
But its all coming back  
  
There were those empty threats and hollow lies  
And whenever you tried to hurt me  
I just hurt you even worse  
And so much deeper  
  
There were hours that just went on for days  
When alone at last wed count up all the chances  
That were lost to us forever  
  
But you were history with the slamming of the door  
And I made myself so strong again somehow  
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then  
  
But if I touch you like this  
And if you kiss me like that  
It was so long ago  
But its all coming back to me  
If you touch me like this  
And if I kiss you like that  
It was gone with the wind  
But its all coming back to me  
Its all coming back its all coming back to me now  
  
There were moments of gold  
And there were flashes of light  
There were things wed never do again  
But then theyd always seemed right  
There were nights of endless pleasure  
It was more than all your laws allow  
Baby Baby Baby  
  
When you touch me like this  
And when you hold me like that  
It was gone with the wind  
But its all coming back to me  
When you see me like this  
And when I see you like that  
Then we see what we want to see  
All coming back to me  
The flesh and the fantasies  
All coming back to me  
I can barely recall  
But its all coming back to me now  
  
If you forgive me all this  
If I forgive you all that  
We forgive and forget  
And its all coming back to me  
When you see me like this  
And when I see you like that  
We see just what we want to see  
Al coming back to me  
The flesh and the fantasies  
All coming back to me  
I can barely recall but its all coming back to me now  
  
Its all coming back to me now  
And when you kiss me like this  
Its all coming back to me now  
And when I touch you like that  
Its all coming back to me now  
If you do it like this  
Its all coming back to me now
