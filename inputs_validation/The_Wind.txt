I listen to the wind to the wind of my soul  
Where Ill end up well I think only God really knows  
Ive sat upon the setting sun  
But never never never never  
I never wanted water once  
No never never never  
  
I listen to my words but they fall far below  
I let my music take me where my heart wants to go  
I swam upon the Devils lake  
But never never never never  
Ill never make the same mistake  
No  never never never
