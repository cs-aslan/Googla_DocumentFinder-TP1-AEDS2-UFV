I leave my son the legacy of dangers  
The tragedy of synthesizing rhymes  
The genocide that comes from total strangers  
Apocalyptic dreams to kill mankind  
  
I see the mystery unwind  
My spirits telling me  
  
The sky is dying  
And the whole worlds falling down  
  
Dont buy your fate  
From media messiahs  
God gave you breath  
Dont blow it all away  
  
I see the misery unwind  
You must be stupid or be blind  
My spirits telling me that  
  
The sky is crying  
Burning holes into the ground  
The sky is dying  
And the whole worlds falling down  
  
What did you see or dont you know  
You only reap the seeds you sow  
Oh no  
  
The sky is crying  
Burning holes into the ground  
Messiahs coming  
But will he hang around  
Cause the sky is dying  
And the whole worlds falling down
