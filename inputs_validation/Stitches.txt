If it stayed Id never leave it  
If that turned around Id grieve  
The special dirty things  
That we used to talk about  
I mean that loving you is strange  
And adored by me throughout  
Oh no its you again  
Someday soon youll find that someone  
Waiting for the chance to beat you  
Drooling on the set to feel you  
Blessing you with every kiss  
  
Tying yourself to me stitch up my emptiness  
Cause youre the death of me  
So precious loving the thrill  
Tying yourself to me stitch up my emptiness  
Cause youre the death of me  
So precious loving the thrill  
  
Such the patient one who needs me  
The spoiled one who wins  
So shocking wheres your sense  
Dont you know I hate you so  
Unsatisfied you little girl  
  
Tying yourself to me stitch up my emptiness  
Cause youre the death of me  
So precious loving the thrill  
Tying yourself to me stitch up my emptiness  
Cause youre the death of me  
So precious loving the thrill  
  
Rolling dice and seeming queer  
Bastard love a sick affair  
Lets see what new disease youll fetch  
I mean that fucking you is strange  
And adored by me thoughout  
Oh no its you again  
Blessing you with every kiss  
  
So precious you know this hate of mine exploded  
Im so deranged you know  
I will never be the same  
  
Tying yourself to me stitch up my emptiness  
Cause youre the death of me  
So precious loving the thrill  
Tying yourself to me stitch up my emptiness  
Cause youre the death of me  
So precious loving the thrill  
  
So precious loving the thrill  
  
So precious loving the thrill  
  
Cause youre the death of me  
  
So precious loving the thrill
