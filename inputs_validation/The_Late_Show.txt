Everyone Ive ever known has wished me well  
Anyway thats how it seems its hard to tell  
Maybe people only ask you how youre doing  
Cause thats easier than letting on how little they could care  
But when you know that youve got a real friend somewhere  
Suddenly all the others are so much easier to bear  
  
Now to see things clear its hard enough I know  
While youre waiting for reality to show  
Without dreaming of the perfect love  
And holding it so far above  
That if you stumbled onto someone real youd never know  
Youd never know  
You could be with somebody who is lonely too  
Sometimes it doesnt show  
He might be trying to get across to you  
Words can be so slow  
When your own emptiness is all thats getting through  
There comes a point when youre not sure why youre still talking  
I passed that point long ago  
Long ago  
Now Im so tired of all this circling  
And all these glimpses of the end  
You know its useless to pretend  
Thats all the voices say  
  
Click to learn more  
Youll go right on circling  
Until youve found some kind of friend  
  
I saw you through the laughter and the noise  
You were talking with the soldiers and the boys  
While they scuffled for your weary smiles  
I thought of all the empty miles  
And the years that Ive spent looking for your eyes  
Looking for your eyes  
And now Im sitting here wondering what to say  
that you might recognize  
Afraid that all these words might scare you away  
And break through the disguise  
No one ever talks about their feelings anyway  
Without dressing them in dreams and laughter  
I guess its just too painful otherwise  
  
Look  
Its like youre standing in the window  
Of a house nobody lives in  
And Im sitting in a car across the way  
Lets just say  
Its an early model chevrolet  
Lets just say  
Its a warm and windy day  
You go and pack your sorrow  
The trash man comes tomorrow  
Leave it at the curb and well just roll away
