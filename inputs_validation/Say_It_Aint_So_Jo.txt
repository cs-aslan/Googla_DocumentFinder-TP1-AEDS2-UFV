Say it aint so Jo please say it aint so  
Thats not what I wanna hear Jo  
And I got a right to know  
Say it aint so Jo please say it aint so  
Im sure theyre telling us lies Jo  
Please tell us it aint so  
They told us that our hero has played his trump card  
He doesnt know how to go on  
Were clinging to his charm and determined smile  
The good old days have gone  
The image and the empire may be falling apart  
The money has gotten scarce  
One mans word held the country together  
But the truth is getting fierce  
Say it aint so Jo please say it aint so  
We pinned our hopes on you Jo  
And theyre ruining our show  
Ooh baby dont you think  
Were gonna get burned  
Ooh baby dont you think  
Were gonna get burned  
Were gonna get turned  
Were gonna get burned  
Yes were gonna get turned  
Were gonna get burned  
Were gonna get turned  
Yes were gonna get burned  
Were gonna get burned  
Were gonna get burned  
Yes were gonna get turned  
Were gonna get burned  
Say it aint so Jo please say it aint so  
Thats not what I wanna hear Jo  
And I got a right to know  
Say it aint so Jo please say it aint so  
Im sure theyre telling us lies Jo  
Please tell us it aint so  
Say it aint so Jo please say it aint so  
Thats not what I wanna hear Jo  
And I got a right to know  
Say it aint so Jo please say it aint so  
Im sure theyre telling us lies Jo  
Please tell us it aint so  
Say it aint so
