Theres no more waiting  
Holding out for love  
You are my god send  
That I have been forever dreaming of  
My angel from above  
  
Heaven knows  
Im head over heels  
And it shows  
Ive played every field I suppose  
But theres something about you  
When youre around  
Baby I have found  
I get lost in you  
  
What is this feeling  
Ive never known before  
That I should touch you  
Swearing to surrender ever more  
Thats what I came here for  
  
Heaven knows  
Im head over heels  
And it shows  
Ive played every field I suppose  
But theres something about you  
When youre around  
Baby I have found  
I get lost in your wonderful daze  
Lost in your wonderful ways  
Heaven knows  
  
Lost in you  
Heaven knows  
  
Oh when youre around  
Baby I have found  
I get lost  
Heaven knows  
  
Heaven knows  
Im head over heels  
And it shows  
Ive played every field I suppose  
But theres something about you  
When youre around  
Baby I have found  
I get lost  
  
Heaven knows  
  
Heaven knows  
Im head over heels  
And it shows  
Ive played every field I suppose  
But theres something about you  
When youre around  
Baby I have found  
  
I get lost in you
