Hello Did you miss me  
I know Im hard to resist  
Yall can come and help me pick the sweetcorn out of this  
Its hard to be humble  
When youre so fucking big  
Did you ever meet a sexier male chauvinist pig  
  
Im gonna milk it till I turn it into cheese  
Tell your babes in arms and OAPs  
Come take a piece of me  
  
If you drop me Ill fall to pieces on you  
If you dont see me I dont exist  
Its nice to meet you  
Now let me go and wash my hands  
Cause you just met the worlds most handsome man  
The worlds most handsome man  
  
Yall know who I am  
Im still the boy next door  
Thats if youre Lord Litchfield and Roger Moore  
If Ive gone up in the world  
Or is the world gone down on me  
Im the one who put the Brits in celebrity  
  
Give in and love it  
Whats the point in hating me  
You cant argue with popularity  
Well you could  
But youd be wrong  
  
If you drop me Ill fall to pieces on you  
If you dont need me I dont exist  
You voted for me  
Now let me see a show of hands  
Keeping for your stands  
  
Can you make me laugh and sign this autograph  
Though its not for me  
Flip a grin shake a thing name a shame  
Then Im out of here  
Its not very complicated  
Im just young and overrated  
  
Please dont drop me Ill fall to pieces on you  
If you dont see me I dont exist  
Its nice to meet you  
Now let me go and wash my hands  
Keeping for your stands  
  
Please dont drop me Ill fall to pieces on you  
If you dont need me I dont exist  
Its nice to meet you  
Now let me see a show of hands  
Cause you just met the worlds most handsome man  
The worlds most handsome man  
The worlds most handsome man  
The worlds most handsome man
