Got to get to know your mind  
Let it be your friend  
Dont be scared of what youll find  
Lets not pretend  
  
Say it isnt true  
You gave up on your dream  
Blinded by the spotlight  
Falling through the screen  
  
You got to be strong  
You go to fight on  
For everyone  
  
Hold a mirror to your life  
Polish night and day  
You can find the clear blue sky  
When the tarnish scrapes away  
  
Hold on a minute  
Let me be your friend  
Strict as you want it  
Or gently take the bends  
  
You got to be strong  
You go to fight on  
For everyone  
  
There are times when the snowstorm hits  
And everything becomes a blur of cold and white  
Then you know that you must fight  
And believe that mountains shift  
And when the snowstorm lifts  
Youll see the sun and the moon so clear
