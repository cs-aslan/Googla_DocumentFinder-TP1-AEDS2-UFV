Heaven sent the promised land  
Looks alright from where I stand  
Cause Im the man on the outside looking in  
  
Waiting on the first step  
Show where the key is kept  
Point me down the right line because its time  
  
To let me in from the cold  
Turn my lead into gold  
Cause theres chill wind blowing in my soul  
And I think Im growing old  
  
Flash the readies  
Wotsuh the deal  
Got to make to the next meal  
Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel  
  
Mile after mile  
Stone after stone  
Turn to speak but youre alone  
Million mile from home youre on your own  
  
So let me in from the cold  
Turn my lead into gold  
Cause theres chill wind blowing in my soul  
And I think Im growing old  
  
Fire bright by candlelight  
And her by my side  
And if she prefers we will never stir again  
  
Someone said the promised land  
And I grabbed it with both hands  
Now Im the man on the inside looking out  
  
Hear me shout Come on in  
Whats the news and where you been  
Cause theres no wind left in my soul  
And Ive grown old
