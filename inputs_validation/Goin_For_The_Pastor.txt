Ive been in love for a short time  
I had a little trouble makin up my mind  
Somthin got in my way babe  
I find it really hard for me to say  
I know that my head was hot girl  
Hot enough to hit the spot that makes you trot  
But girl I aint no liar  
Gonna set your little heart on fire yeah  
  
Ive had my hit and miss girl  
Im ready now to settle right down to this  
I hope that your love is true babe  
As true as the love I hold for you  
Theres one thing that Id say girl  
I love you for ever and a day  
Now girl I aint no liar  
Im gonna set your little heart on fire yeah  
  
chorus  
cause when Im thinking of you  
Thinkin about you  
My heart beats faster Im goin for the pastor  
I got me a love and Im gonna make it last girl  
Girl

Thinkin about you  
My heart beats faster Im goin for the pastor  
I got me a love and Im gonna make it last girl

For cuttin loose that bloodthirsty dave the knave
