No woman no cry  
No woman no cry  
No woman no cry  
No woman no cry  
And I remember when we used to sit  
In a government yard in Trenchtown  
Oba obaserving the hypocrites  
As we would mingle with the good people we meet  
Good friends we have and good friends weve lost along the way  
In this bright future we cant forget our past  
So dry your tears I say  
No woman no cry  
No woman no cry  
No woman no cry  
No woman no cry  
I remember when we used to sit  
In a government yard in Trenchtown  
And Georgie would make fire light  
Log wood burnin through the night  
And we would cook corn meal porridge of  
Which Ill share with you mmm you and you  
My feet is my only carriage now  
So Ive got to push on through  
But while Im gone  
Evrythings gonna be alright  
Evrythings gonna be alright  
Evrythings gonna be alright  
Evrythings gonna be alright well  
Evrythings gonna be alright  
Evrythings gonna be alright well  
Evrythings gonna be alright  
Evrythings gonna be alright  
No woman no cry  
No woman no cry  
No woman no cry
