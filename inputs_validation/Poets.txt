Spring starts when a heartbeats pounding  
When the birds can be heard above the reckoning carts doing some final
accounting  
Lava flowing in Superfarmers direction  
Hes been getting reprieve from the heat in the frozen food section  
  
Dont tell me what the poets are doing  
Dont tell me that theyre talking tough  
Dont tell me that theyre antisocial  
Somehow not antisocial enough all right  
  
And porn speaks to its splintered legions  
To the pink amid the withered cornstalks in them winter regions  
While aiming at the archetypal father  
He said with such broad and tentative swipes why do you even bother  
  
Dont tell me what the poets are doing  
Those Himalayas of the mind  
Dont tell me what the poets been doing  
In the long grasses over time  
  
Dont tell me what the poets are doing  
On the street and the epitome of vague  
Dont tell me how the universe is altered  
When you find out how he gets paid all right  
  
If theres nothing more that you need now  
The lawn cut by bare breasted women  
Beach bleached towels within reach for the women  
Got to make it thatll make it by swimming
