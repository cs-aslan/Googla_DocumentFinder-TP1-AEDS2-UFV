I packed my bags  in the land of rags  
Cause I dont believe in them dimmo drags  
Dont want to vote for the left wing  dont want to vote for the right  
I gotta have bothto make me fly  
  
Just a whitey from Blighty  heading out west  
Got my little green card an my bulletproof vest  
Goin to old tube city  where the buzz is the best  
On down the line down the line down the line down the line  
  
Well I was born on the line an I was raised on the line  
I was schooled on the line an I was fazed on the line  
An I was used on the line an I was dazed on the line  
Just had to split off the line cause I was crazed off the line  
  
An I remember all the good times  me n Miller enjoyed  
Up and down the M1 in some luminous yoyo toy  
But the future has to change  and to change Ive got to destroy  
Oh look out Lennon here I come  land ahoyhoyhoy  
  
All American Alien Boy All American Alien Boy  
Dont look down put your feet on the ground dont drown in the big aquarium  
Dont walk slow  put on a big show  shove your meat down vegetarians  
Dont get slugged get mugged get bugged or theyll sling you in the jug  
Shove you under some rug give you some drug  pull out the plug and then  
  
And theyre telling me this hamburgers cheaper than the other  
An this televisions cheaper than the other  
And theyre selling me hotdogs cheaper than the other  
An these pizzas cheaper than the other  
And I dont understand all this  Im just an All American Alien Boy  
  
An theyre telling me rifles are shot in Connecticut  
Theyre telling me pistols are shot in Westchester  
You can get a Saturday Night Special on Flatbush on the Bowery or the Bronx  
  
Or on 42nd Street  And I dont understand all this  being an All American
Alien Boy  
Ive got sodium nitrate rotting in my guts  
My heads full of ulcers I got lungs full of butts  
My heart wants a transplant  it thinks that Im nuts  
My luggage wont open  my eyes wont shut  
An Im beginning to dig all this  being an All American Alien Boy  
  
And your women are always right alright  
They always know so much more  
Cause the women came from heaven  
An the men came outta some store  
An they dont know who they are and they dont know what theyre for  
  
Im an All American Alien Boy  look out Mary Tyler Moore  
All American Alien Boy
