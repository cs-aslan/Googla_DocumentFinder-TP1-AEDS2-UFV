Name your price  
A ticket to paradise  
I cant stay here any more  
And Ive looked high and low  
Ive been from shore to shore to shore  
If theres a short cut Id have found it  
But theres no easy way around it  
  
Light of the world shine on me  
Love is the answer  
Shine on us all set us free  
Love is the answer  
  
Who knows why  
Someday we all must die  
Were all homeless boys and girls  
And we are never heard  
Its such a lonely world  
People turn their heads and walk on by  
Tell me is it worth just another try  
  
Tell me are we alive or just a dying planet  
What are the chances  
Ask the man in your heart for the answers  
  
And when you feel afraid love one another  
When youve lost your way love one another  
When youre all alone love one another  
When youre far from home love one another  
When youre down and out love one another  
All your hopes run out love one another  
When you need a friend love one another  
When youre near the end love one another  
We got to love one another  
  
Light of the world you got to shine  
Love will be a means yeah yeah  
Shine on us all  
Know that love can save the day  
Just give it one more chance  
Lord you just cant let it stop lord  
Love is the answer  
Got to be free to let love into your life  
Let it shine
