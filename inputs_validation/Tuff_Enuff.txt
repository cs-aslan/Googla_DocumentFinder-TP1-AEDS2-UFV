I would walk ten miles on my hands and knees  
Aint no doubt about it baby its you I aim to please  
Id wrestle with a lion and a grizzly bear  
Its my life baby but I dont care  
  
Chorus  
Aint that tough enough  
Aint that tough enough  
Aint that tough enough  
Aint that tough enough  
  
For you baby I would swim the sea  
Nothin Id do for you thats too tough for me  
Id put out a burning building with a shovel and dirt  
And not even worry about getting hurt  
  
Chorus  
  
Id work twentyfour hours seven days a week  
Just so I could come home and kiss your cheek  
I love you in the morning and I love you at noon  
I love you in the night and take you to the moon  
  
Chorus  
  
Lay in a pile of burning money that Ive earned  
And not even worry about getting burned  
Id climb the Empire State and fight Muhammad Ali  
Just to have you baby close to me  
  
Chorus  
  
I would walk ten miles on my hands and knees  
Aint no doubt about it baby its you I aim to please  
Id wrestle with a lion and a grizzly bear  
Its my life baby but I dont care  
  
Chorus
