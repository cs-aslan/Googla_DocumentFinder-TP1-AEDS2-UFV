If heaven aint a lot like Dixie I dont want to go  
If heaven aint a lot like Dixie Id just as soon stay home  
I was one of the chosen few to be born in Alabam  
Im just alike my daddys son Im proud of who I am  
  
I went through a lot of good women and shook old Jim Beams hand  
If I never see the pearly gates Ive walked through the promised land  
  
If heaven aint a lot like Dixie I dont want to go  
If heaven aint a lot like Dixie Id just as soon stay home  
  
If they dont have a Grand Ole Opry like they do in Tennessee  
Just send me to hell or New York City it would be about the same to me  
Ive got wild honey trees and crazy little weeds growin around my shack  
These dusty roads aint streets of gold but Im a happy right where Im at  
  
All these pretty little southern belles are a country boys dream  
They aint got wings or halos but theyre sure looking good to me  
  
If heaven aint a lot like Dixie I dont want to go  
If heaven aint a lot like Dixie Id just as soon stay home  
If heaven aint a lot like Dixie I dont want to go  
If heaven aint a lot like Dixie Id just as soon stay home  
If they dont have a Grand Ole Opry like they do in Tennessee  
just send me to hell or New York City it would be about the same to me
