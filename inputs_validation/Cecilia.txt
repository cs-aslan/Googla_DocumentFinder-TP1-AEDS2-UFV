Cecilia youre breaking my heart  
Youre shaking my confidence daily  
Oh Cecilia Im down on my knees  
Im begging you please to come home  
  
Oh Cecilia youre breaking my heart  
Youre shaking my confidence daily  
Oh Cecilia Im down on my knees  
Im begging you please to come home  
Come on home  
  
Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia  
Up in my bedroom making love  
I got up to wash my face  
When I come back to bed  
Someones taken my place  
  
Oh Cecilia youre breaking my heart  
Youre shaking my confidence daily  
Oh Cecilia Im down on my knees  
Im begging you please to come home  
Come on home  
  
Jubilation she loves me again  
I fall on the floor and Im laughing  
Jubilation she loves me again  
I fall on the floor and Im laughing
