Rockland  
In my life  
Track Masters  
Youre all I need in my life  
Make money  
Youre all I need in my life  
Duece duece  
Youre all I need in my life  
  
Uh huh yo yo yo yo  
I remember in the days  
yall niggas talking all that shit about keepin it real  
But when it comes to this game Imma play the field  
Rockland had loot before we signed the deal  
Haters get in the way and catch the sky like Seal  
We used to use the streets for the football field  
In church free lunch was our only meal  
But now we push whips with Lorenzo wheels  
Living it up in Beverly Hills  
  
Tone  
You know 9 to 5 was only temporary  
Now the ladies want to find Tone in a hurry  
Got em hittin notes that Mariah couldnt carry  
All you player haters going down like Mary  
Cop the Rolls Royce a player with a choice  
Ladies stay moist from the sound of my voice  
The lady killers pass the keys to our villas  
Rockland Track Masters top billers  
  
Chorus x2  
Only the loot can make me happy  
Nothing but the loot baby  
Happy Show me the loot baby  
Happy Show me the loot  
  
I never thought that I  
Could make someone like you  
I felt energized  
When you went through my groove  
Ill never let you go no  
Youre so right for me  
Ive got to let you know  
Forever you and me  
The ballas anthem right here  
  
Chorus  
  
You must be heaven sent  
Sent into my life  
And I compliment you honey the money  
We have a love thats long  
And true I make you in many ways  
Ive got to roll with you  
In each and every day  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre all I need in my life  
I dont need no one I dont need no one but you  
Youre all I need in my life  
I dont need no one I dont need no one but you  
I said youre all I need in my life  
I dont need no one I dont need no one but you  
Youre all I need in my life I dont need no one  
I dont need no one but you  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre all I need in my life  
I said youre all I need in my life
