Dreamin I must be dreamin  
Or am I really lyin here with you  
  
Baby you take me in your arms  
And though Im wide awake  
I know my dream is comin true  
  
And oh I just fall in love again  
Just one touch and then it happens every time  
And there I go I just fall in love again and when I do  
Cant help myself I fall in love with you  
  
Magic it must be magic  
The way I hold you and the night just seems to fly  
Easy for you to take me to a star  
Heaven is that moment when I look into your eyes  
  
And oh I just fall in love again  
Just one touch and then it happens every time  
And there I go I just fall in love again and when I do  
Cant help myself I fall in love with you  
  
And oh I just fall in love again  
Just one touch and then it happens every time  
And there I go I just fall in love again and when I do  
Cant help myself I fall in love with you  
  
Cant help myself I fall in love with you
