You say youre down and out  
And need some help to get you through each day  
Well heres a thought or two  
Ive used and like to pass them on your way  
I found them lying there  
The answers that you say youre looking for  
Make what you will of them  
And you can change the way it was before  
  
You got to make it by yourself  
You know you got to make it by yourself  
Ill be your friend and Ill lend a helping hand  
But you got to try and help yourself before I can  
  
I hear you talk of all the happiness  
And emptiness youve known  
Well let me reassure you  
Never were you really all alone  
They say in quiet desperation many people cannot see  
They cannot see the simple truth  
Thats not the way it has to be  
  
You got to find it for yourself  
God helps the man who helps himself amen  
I am your friend and Ill lend a helping hand  
But you gotta try and help yourself before I can  
  
We got to help each other each other  
You got to help your brother when you can  
When you can  
  
Now dont you think that I was preachin  
Im just reachin out for you  
Cause thats the only way  
That I know how to get the message through  
Then you in turn and got to learn and teach it  
To somebody who  
Who felt the happiness and emptiness the same as you
