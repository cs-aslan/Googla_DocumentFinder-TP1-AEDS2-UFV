I dont know  
I dont know whats on your mind  
I thought everything was fine  
But it was my surprise  
  
I dont know  
I dont know whats going on  
Something surely must be wrong  
Youre living secret lives  
  
Living secret lives secret lives  
And I wonder where she goes to in the night  
In secret lives  
  
Wish I knew  
Wish I knew where I fit in  
Wish that I knew everything  
About your secret lives  
  
If it means  
If it means that much to you  
I dont want to stop the things you do  
I dont need alibis  
  
Living secret lives secret lives  
And I wonder where she goes to in the night  
In secret lives  
  
I dont care  
I dont care what goes on there  
So long as one day I can share  
Share your secret lives  
  
Living secret lives secret lives  
And I wonder where she goes to in the night  
In secret lives  
  
Living secret lives secret lives  
And I wonder where she goes to in the night  
In secret lives  
  
Living secret lives secret lives  
And I wonder where she goes to in the night  
In secret lives  
  
Secret lives secret lives  
Secret lives secret lives
