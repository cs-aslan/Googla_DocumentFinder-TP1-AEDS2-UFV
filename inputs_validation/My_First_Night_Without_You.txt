Im driving home from work  
Knowing youre not there  
I used to hurry home  
Now I dont even care  
The sun is in my eyes  
So I cant see  
But when it sets down behind the  
Mountain its gonna be  
  
My first night without you  
My first night without you  
My first night without you  
Ohwithout you  
  
I sit here like a fool  
Remembering everything  
The way we used to talk  
The songs that we used to sing  
Ive got to try and leave  
The past behind  
But my memorys so good  
I think that Im losing my mind  
  
My first night without you  
My first night without you  
And I wonder what Ill do  
Ohwithout you  
  
Will I be able to sleep  
Will I lie in my bed and weep  
What if I forget  
And reach for you  
Will I dream about you  
My first nightmy first night  
  
My first night without you  
My first night without you  
And I wonder what Ill do oh  
  
My first night without you  
My first night without you  
And I wonder how Ill get through  
Ohwithout you
