Lets all make babies  
And salsa from Sainsburys  
Cause this is a Happy Song  
Play on my pink flute  
But make it through Beirut  
Cause this is a happy song  
  
You need a mood maker  
Then go meet my tailor  
I know its going too fast  
Your sister your brother  
His mistress your lover  
Is getting on with it  
  
Chorus  
Yeah  debonair   
Im feeling so debonair cause I care   
Send you my love cause I care its a love song   
This is a love song  
We bring news from Jamaica  
  
Goose step through Gangland  
And drive Chitty Ban Bang  
Cause this is a happy song  
Bosnians and Kurds  
Back with some big bird  
Whos singing a happy song  
  
Fly in the sunshine  
Get there at your own time  
You tell us if Im in Hong Kong  
Your sister your brother  
His mistress your lover  
Just singing a happy song  
  
Chorus   
  
Happy Song  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
  
Yeah debonair  
Im feeling so debonair in the air  
Everythings up in the air from Jamaica  
Tease me from bedtime  
We bring news from Jamaica  
  
Chorus   
This is a happy song
