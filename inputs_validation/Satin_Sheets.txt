Satin sheets to lie on satin pillows to cry on  
But still Im not happy dont you see  
Big long Cadillacs pretty clothes upon my back  
But still I want you to set you free  
I found another man who can give me more than you can  
So youve given everything that money can buy  
But your money cant hold me tight like he does on a long long night  
No you didnt keep me satisfied  
Satin sheets to lie on  
Oh but still I want you to set you free
