I was angry  
I said things I shouldnt say  
But please dont turn your back  
Sometimes I get so upset  
But I take it all back  
Please dont go  
I know I was wrong  
Sometimes I dont know what comes over me  
But I try to remember  
Dont hurt a woman  
Dont hurt a woman  
I was angry  
I said things I shouldnt say  
I must have lost control  
Sometimes something clicks in my head  
And Im not myself anymore  
That wasnt me  
You cant believe everything you see  
Lets make believe I never said a word  
And Ill try to remember  
Dont hurt a woman  
Try to remember  
Dont hurt a woman  
Try to remember  
Dont hurt a woman  
Ill try to remember  
Dont hurt a woman  
Cause I lovin you  
So long
