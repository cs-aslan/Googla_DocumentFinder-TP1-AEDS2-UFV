With Sugar Pie Desanto  
  
I dont wanna believe  
The bad things about you  
Oh no now  
  
Cause if theyre true  
Ill have to get along without you  
Oh ooh now  
  
I said the word the sound  
The song about the things you do  
  
Moving and a grooving  
Using and a fooling  
Chasing around every skirt in town  
If its true youll be on your way  
  
Do I make myself clear  
Do I make myself clear  
  
I said youre gonna have to  
Stop and check yourself  
Oh yeah now  
  
Im not gonna have a man  
Thats got somebody else oh no  
Oh you tell him now girl now now  
  
So if youre running around baby  
Thinking of putting me down  
Youre wrong  
  
Taking away what belongs to me  
Giving to her when Im in need  
If its true youll be on your way  
  
Do I make myself clear  
Do I make myself clear  
  
I said do do I  
Do I make myself clear  
Do you understand me  
Do do I do I make myself clear  
Oh you better listen to her now  
  
Oh yeah ohh yeah now  
Oh oh oh  
  
So why wont you try to do  
Something to change it  
Yeah yeah  
  
And make me know its not  
The way they claim it oh yeah  
Now let me tell you something  
  
All I wanted you to be true honey  
Love me like you say you do oh yeah  
And I wont care for what they say  
Instead Ill turn my head and walk away  
But if its true you know what to do  
  
Do I make myself clear  
Do I make myself clear  
  
I said do do I  
Do I make myself clear  
And oh oh oh yeah now  
Oh oh  
  
I said do do do do  
Do I make myself clear
