Aint no use to sit and wonder why babe  
It dont matter anyhow  
Aint no use to sit and wonder why babe  
If you dont know by now  
  
When your roofs too close at the break of dawn  
Look out your window and Ill be gone  
You are the reason Im traveling home  
Dont think twice its alright  
  
Aint no use in turning on your light babe  
That night I never know  
Aint no use in turning on your light babe  
Im on the dark side of the road  
  
Still I wish there was something you would do or say  
To try and make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talking anyway  
Dont think twice its alright  
  
But there aint no use in calling out my name babe  
Like you never did before  
And there aint no use in calling out my name  
Cause I cant hear you anymore  
  
Well Im thinking and wondering while Im way down on the road  
I once loved a man but that love grew old  
I gave him my heart but he wanted my soul  
Dont think twice its alright  
  
Walking down that lone lonesome road babe  
Where Im bound I cant tell  
But goodbye is too good away babe  
So Im gonna say farewell  
  
But I aint saying you treated me unkind  
You could have loved me better but no I dont mind  
But you just kinda wasted my precious time  
Dont think twice its alright
