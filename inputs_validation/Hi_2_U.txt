A brother sayin hi to you say it  
I really wouldnt lie to you  
I want to get inside of you  
Inside of you what you try to do can I hit it  
A brother sayin hi to you wish me luck  
I really wouldnt lie to you yea  
I want to be inside of you fo real  
And after I do goodbye to you  
  
Verse 1  
Watch my floors fo sho hock up the kitchen  
Suck me dry lets get high then wash the dishes  
You get three wishes if youre cute and ambitious  
Like Tisha and Denisha boy them chickens was vicious  
Wicked how I kick it I stick it in the eye  
Oops slid it on the accident  
But when I first met her she was so   
So it made no sense why she did that for the hell of it  
We did it on the wall me and my dogg  
And I met her at the mall  
Lakewood so good when I be inside of you  
Im just tryna freak it make it fly for you  
Make you want to come back and get another piece  
And share with your peoples and tell your little niece  
My khackis every crease with the rubber in my pocket  
Ride it divide it and please dont knock it til you tried it  
  
Chorus  
A brother sayin hi to you  
I want to be inside of you  
I know Im lookin fly to you  
I wouldnt lie to you whatcha tryna do  
A brother sayin hi to you  
You know I wouldnt lie to you  
I want to be inside of you  
And after I do goodbye to you  
  
Verse 2  
Ay ay baby who with cause your thang like tendin girl  
Get it wit your fit in and welcome to my world  
Fancy cars yachts n pools basketball courts thats made for high schools  
Backyard full of dogs got a pawn full of fish  
But a bad girl I think thats all thats missin from my list  
Unless you want to be the girl that fill that voidacap
