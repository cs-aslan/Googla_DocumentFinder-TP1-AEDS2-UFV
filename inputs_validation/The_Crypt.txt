The moon is outside but it cant get in  
Almost dead from his nightly sin  
Jonathan is deep asleep a perfect time to visit the heap  
  
Down the hallway to the lair down down the slippery stairs  
Abigail is in the crypt a lantern in her hand  
  
The secret of the crypt  
A coghing made for a child wondering who is inside  
Oh Abigail and off comes the lid  
  
The smell is sick  
Mummified in front on its side  
A name was cut deep in the lid with a knife  
And it said Abigail  
  
A silvery necklace was round the mummys neck  
It had wings and was sharpened round the edge  
What are you doing here Henry had come in unseen  
  
Abigail pulled on the necklace and the little mummys head  
Was separated clean from its tiny neck  
Then up up up up into his throat  
Twisting and turning it oh she couldnt stop  
  
Brandon Henry was going down in a pool of blood  
He was on the ground  
  
Theres an eerie glow in the crypt down below  
Mummified infant on its side  
Gotta go gotta run Ill be back for you little one  
  
In the crypt Abigails twin is searching for a home  
Abigails twin is searching for her Mom  
But Mommys in the floor and its made of stone  
Her mommys in the floor and she doesnt know  
Oh she doesnt know she doesnt know  
Will she ever know
