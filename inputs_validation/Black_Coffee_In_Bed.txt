Theres a stain on my notebook  
Where your coffee cup was  
And theres ash in the pages  
Now Ive got myself lost  
I was writing to tell you  
That my feelings tonight  
Are a stain on my notebook  
That rings your goodbye  
With the way that you left me  
I can hardly contain  
The hurt and the anger  
And the joy of the pain  
Now knowing I am single  
Theyll be fire in my eyes  
And a stain on my notebook  
For a new love tonight  
From the lips without passion  
To the lips with a kiss  
Theres nothing of your love  
That Ill ever miss  
The stain on my notebook  
Remain all thats left  
Of the memory of late nights  
And coffee in bed  
Now shes gone  
And Im back on the beat  
A stain on my notebook  
Says nothing to me  
Now shes gone  
And Im out with a friend  
With lips full of passion  
And coffee in bed
