Ill come in your car to talk business  
No business no money talk  
Zero in on my full of intentions  
I think you got it because you pulled up and stopped  
If money is the root of all evil  
Im begging at the feet of the devil  
Talk to me please  
Money talk to me  
  
Twenty gets you straight  
Forty gets you other  
Think of what a hundred could do  
Ive been gifted with the thing that you want  
Whos better than who  
Never underestimate a woman like me  
The kids have got to eat  
And man thats reality you see  
Money talk to me  
  
Youre so deluded  
You think that Im real  
You pass your hormones off as love  
For five minutes you feel  
You can buy a squeegee little silicone sack  
But it wont feed the world  
Like the ones that I pack naturally  
Money talk to me
