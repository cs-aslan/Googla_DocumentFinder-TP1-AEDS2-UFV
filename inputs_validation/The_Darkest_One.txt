Come in come in come in come in  
From under these darling skies come in  
Its warm and its safe here and almost harkening  
Off to a time and place now lost on our imagination  
  
Where you dont complain but you still do  
And you dont explain if you want to explain  
What you believe you say without shame I just do  
To say what you mean you dont mean what you say  
Or you do  
  
Where the wild are strong Wild are strong  
And the strong are the darkest ones The strong are the darkest ones  
And youre the darkest one  
  
Come in come in come in come in  
From thin and wicked prairie winds come in  
Its warm and its safe here and almost heartening  
Here in a time and place not lost on our imagination  
  
Where you dont explain but you still do  
And you can complain if you want to complain  
Where youre real instrumental or supple  
Or sexy as hell  
Where you say I believe or say without shame  
I cant tell  
  
Where the wild are strong Wild are strong  
And the strong are the darkest ones The strong are the darkest ones  
And youre the darkest one  
And youre the darkest one  
And if thats what you want  
Oh then youre the darkest one
