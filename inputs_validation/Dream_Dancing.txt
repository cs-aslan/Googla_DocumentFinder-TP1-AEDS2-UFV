When the lights go down and the music gets pretty  
Get that cheektocheek look in your eye  
Little boy go better grab your honey  
Girl youd better grab your guy  
Its time for dream dream dancing  
Dream dream dancing  
  
Out on the dance floor everybodys all alone  
Just squeeze my hand and then lets close our eyes  
And listen to the man play on the saxophone  
As we swerve cross the floor just there stars in the sky  
Dream dream dancing  
Dream dream dancing  
  
Close your eyes hold me tight  
Let the night last forever repeat  
And I dont mind if the sun never shines  
And I dont care if tomorrow never comes  
As long as we are  Dream dream dancing  
Dream dream dancing  
  
When the joint shuts down  
And Im still feeling up  
We go on home for a little cosy cover  
For our favorite station on the radio  
Well be dancing close  
Well be dancing slow  
  
Dream dream dancing
