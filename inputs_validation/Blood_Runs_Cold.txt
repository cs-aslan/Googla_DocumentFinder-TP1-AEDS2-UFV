I heard this line one time bout tryin to save the world  
But have you ever tried to save yourself  
A wideeyed suicide drive  
Remains a fake  
As if youd ever  
Ever go and make the same mistake  
Strung out as the night comes crawlin  
Your halo of thorns is fallin  
  
Chorus  
Blood runs cold  
I feel it in my bones  
But you dont know your time is up  
Blood runs cold  
  
Somebody somewhere is screamin out the words  
But do they ever really ease the pain  
I guess what Im trying to say  
Is whose life is it anyway because livin  
Living is the best revenge  
You can play  
This fall from grace  
I see your face  
Its over  
  
Chorus  
  
From you love was kind  
Resolved left scarred and blind  
Wasted and naked in the wings  
  
Denying twist of fate  
Demanding Heavens gate  
Lying in wait above the wind  
  
Strung out as the night comes crawlin  
Your halo of thorns is fallin  
  
Chorus  
  
Blood runs cold  
Blood runs cold
