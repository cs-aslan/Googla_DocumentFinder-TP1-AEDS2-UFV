Im on the white cliffs of Dover  
Thinking it over and over  
But if I jump its all over  
A cautionary tale for you  
Id like to roll in the clover  
With you over and over  
On the white cliffs of Dover  
And then Id let you push me over  
  
Chorus  
And if that is the fact  
Then in actual fact its  
Not where its at  
And its over  
And if that is the fact  
Then in actual fact its  
Not where its at  
And its over  
Yes it is  
  
And now the bluebirds are over  
Over the white cliffs of Dover  
So when you push me over  
Dont bury me Im not worth anything  
  
Chorus
