I dont drink coffee I take tea my dear  
I like my toast done on one side  
And you can hear it in my accent when I talk  
Im an Englishman in New York  
  
You see me walking down Fifth Avenue  
A walking cane here at my side  
I take it everywhere I walk  
Im an Englishman in New York  
  
Whoa Im an alien  
Im a legal alien  
Im an Englishman in New York  
Whoa Im an alien  
Im a legal alien  
Im an Englishman in New York  
  
If manners maketh man as someone said  
Hes the hero of the day  
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and mile  
Be yourself no matter what they say  
  
Whoa Im an alien  
Im a legal alien  
Im an Englishman in New York  
Whoa Im an alien  
Im a legal alien  
Im an Englishman in New York  
  
Modesty propriety can lead to notoriety  
But you could end up as the only one  
Gentleness sobriety are so rare in this society  
At night a candles brighter than the sun  
  
Takes more than combat gear to make a man  
Takes more than a license for a gun  
Confront your enemies avoid them when you can  
A gentleman will walk but never run  
  
If manners maketh man as someone said  
Hes the hero of the day  
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile  
Be yourself no matter what they say  
Be yourself no matter what they say  
Be yourself no matter what they say  
Be yourself no matter what they say  
Be yourself no matter what they say  
Be yourself no matter what they say  
Be yourself no matter what they say  
Be yourself no matter what they say  
Be yourself no matter what they say  
Be yourself no matter what they say
