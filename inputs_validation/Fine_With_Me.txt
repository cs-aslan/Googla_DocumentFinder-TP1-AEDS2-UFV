I must admit  
I cant remember your name  
I know we just met  
But since then Ive had a lot to think about  
Before we part ways well theres something that Id like to say  
I realize its late  
But if youll hear out Im sure  
Dave Letterman can wait  
And if youd like to  
Maybe continue what we started with a smile  
From across the room  
Thatd be fine with me  
When I first saw  
  
Your face I knew for sure  
That from now on  
Things would be different than before  
I walk in weak  
From yet another day  
I need you to say  
That tomorrow Im gonna hear your voice again  
And if youd like to maybe continue  
What we started with a smile from across the room  
Thatd be fine with me  
And I only hope that I can be what you were looking for  
Cause all I ask is that you look my way  
And thatd be fine with me  
I know its clich
