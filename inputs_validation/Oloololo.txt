Lala Salama  
To the Masai Mara  
And asante sana  
Kichwa Tembo  
Im going Oloololo  
Back to the world where Im from  
Soon Ill be flying solo  
On a heading that follows the sun  
Oloololo Oloololo loololo  
Cause Ive been down from Nairobi  
Southeast of Kisumu  
To the waiting savanna  
Like a place that I once knew  
And the river was flowing  
While the crocodile baked in the sun  
With the elephant knowing  
That a change had already begun  
Oloololo Oloololo loololo  
Oloololo Oloololo  
Lala Salama Oloololo To the Masai Mara  
And asante sana Oloololo To Kichwa Tembo
