Alarm Clock ring about a quarter after five  
Ive been up all night raisin hell  
With some friends of mine  
I take one good look in the mirror  
But only one things gettin clearer  
The way I live Im lucky to be alive  
  
There I go lying to myself  
Said I wasnt gonna do it  
Next thing ya know  
Here I go again  
Talked myself right into it  
  
Supposed to be to work an hour ago  
When I passed that boss stormin down the road  
Now theres an angel on my shoulder  
Thinkin she can win me over  
The Devils got my number dont you know  
  
There I go lying to myself  
Said I wasnt gonna do it  
Next thing ya know  
Here I go again  
Talked myself right into it  
Maybe Maybe have I gone too far this time  
Maybe Maybe is my conscience workin overtime nah  
  
Theres a knockout Georgia peach givin me the eye  
Well if the truth be known Im just a little shy  
Turns out she wasnt alone  
She had a six foot chaperon  
But that didnt slow me down  
Dont ask me why  
There I go lying to myself  
Said I wasnt gonna do it  
Next thing ya know  
Here I go again  
I got no one to blame except myself  
Said I wasnt gonna do it  
Next thing ya know  
Here I go again  
Talked myself right into it  
Talked myself  
Talked myself right into it  
Talked myself talked myself  
Talked myself right  
Said I wasnt gonna do it  
Talked myself talked myself  
Talked myself right into it  
Talked myself talked myself  
Talked myself right into it
