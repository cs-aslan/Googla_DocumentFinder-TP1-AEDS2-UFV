Theres a light in the distance burning faithfully  
Cant you show your resistance to the enemy  
Make your way under cover of night  
You brave bad weather and you hold on tight  
See the light in the distance burning faithfully  
Why dont you see it burn its plain as day  
When will you ever learn that its better this way  
You point a finger and you turn your back   
Theres no disguise for the faith you lack  
Theres a light in the distance burning faithfully  
The pale blue yonder is calling me  
These days I wonder where youll go  
And what youll be  
Wait out the storm thats all that you can do  
Praying for dawn let the bell ring true
