Standing alone in the night  
People talk around me  
Under the neon street light  
Tryin hard to hold on  
I need somebodys love to  
Surround me  
Tossing a coin in the air  
Making my decision  
What has gone wrong with my life  
Ive drunk all my religion  
I need somebodys love  
To remind me  
I wont be lonely tonight  
All I wants another baby  
I wont be lonely tonight  
All I needs another baby  
Heads I leave town in the night  
Tails I drink a bottle  
If it should land on its side  
Ill return to love you  
I need somebodys life to  
Surround me  
I wont be lonely tonight  
All I wants another baby  
I wont be lonely tonight  
All I needs another baby  
And this is the last time  
I wanna be  
Im gonna be  
I wont be lonely tonight  
All I wants another baby  
I wont be lonely tonight  
All I needs another baby
