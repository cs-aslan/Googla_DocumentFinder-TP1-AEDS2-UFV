I dont know why shes with me  
I only brought her trouble since the day she met me  
If I was her by now I would have left me  
I would have walked away  
But now Ive broken away  
Somehow instead she forgave me  
She said a womans got to do what shes got to do  
Even if it means she denied herself the truth  
Cause when youre in too deep you wake up when its too late  
Youve fallen in love in the worst way  
And if you dont go now then youll stay  
Cause Ill never let you leave never let you breathe  
Cause if youre looking for heaven baby it sure as hell aint me  
  
So walk away  
walk away  
Walk away oh  
Save yourself from the heartache oh  
Go now before its too late  
So walk away  
walk away  
Walk away oh  
Save yourself from the heartache oh  
Go now before its too late  
But still she stays  
  
Shes standing in the heart of darkness  
Saying I know you got a soul even though youre heartless  
How could any woman in their right mind be so blind  
To find something this safe  
Instead of walking with me she should have walked away  
  
She finds color in the darkest places  
She finds beauty in the saddest of faces  
For such a clued in headstrong city girl  
Couldve had the world but shes fallen in love in the worst way  
And if you dont go now then youll stay  
Cause Ill never let you leave never let you breathe  
Cause if youre looking for heaven baby it sure as hell aint me  
  
So walk away  
walk away  
Walk away oh  
Save yourself from the heartache oh  
Go now before its too late  
So walk away  
walk away  
Walk away oh  
Save yourself from the heartache oh  
Go now before its too late  
But still she stays  
Oh yeah  
But still she stays  
Oh yeah  
  
I dont know why shes with me  
I only brought her trouble since the day she met me  
If I was her by now I would have left me  
I would have walked away  
  
But youve fallen in love in the worst way  
And if you dont go now then youll stay  
Cause Ill never let you leave never let you breathe  
Cause if youre looking for heaven baby it sure as hell aint me  
  
So walk away  
walk away  
Walk away oh  
Save yourself from the heartache oh  
Go now before its too late  
So walk away  
walk away  
Walk away oh  
Save yourself from the heartache oh  
Go now before its too late  
But still she stays  
  
Yeah  
But still she stays eh  
Im saying walk away  
Yeah  
Im saying walk away  
Save yourself from the heartache go now before its too late  
But still she stays  
Still she stays  
Yeah she stays  
She stays
