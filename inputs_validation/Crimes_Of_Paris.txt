I thought it was you and your optimists view of the clock  
And how its always another day  
Just after twelve oclocks struck  
You said Now I only want you so I dont have to promise  
But tiny children in grownup clothes whispered all the Crimes of Paris  
  
Chorus  
Youre not the girl nextdoor or a girl from France  
Or the cigarettegirl in the sizzle hotpants  
All the words of love seem cruel and crass  
When youre tough and transparent as armoured glass  
Youre everywhere girl in an everyday mess  
Wholl pay for the Crimes of Paris  
  
I heard that you fell for the Hell or to Hammersmith Blues  
In the tiny torn up pieces of his mind hes irresistible too  
Now its hard to say now if hes only stupid or smart  
When he crawled through the door  
And poured out more of his creepingJesus heart  
  
Chorus  
  
And its all here and now  
She hit him with that paperweight Eiffel Tower  
And I tried to hold on to you but I dont know how  
And I find it hard to swallow good advice  
Like going down three times to only come up twice  
  
Shes so convenient hes always stiff as hairlacquer  
Its hard to discover now hes in love with her  
It was her way of getting her own back  
You never did anything she couldnt do on her own  
Youre as good as your word and thats no good to her  
Youd better leave that kitten alone  
  
Chorus
