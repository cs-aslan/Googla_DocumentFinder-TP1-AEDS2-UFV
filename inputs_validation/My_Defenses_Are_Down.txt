Frank butler  
Ive had my way with so many girls  
An was lots of fun  
My system was to know many girls  
To keep me safe from one  
I find it cant be done  
My defenses are down  
Shes broken my resistance  
And I dont know where I am  
I went into the fight like a lion  
But I came out like a lamb  
My defenses are down  
Shes got me where she wants me  
And I cant escape no how  
I could speak to my heart when it weakened  
But my heart wont listen now  
Like a toothless clawless tiger  
Like an organgrinders bear  
Like a knight without his armor  
Like Samson without his hair  
My defenses are down  
I might as well surrender  
For the battle cant be won  
But I must confess that I like it  
So theres nothing to be done  
Yes I must confess that I like it  
Being miserables gonna be fun

His defenses are down  
Shes broken my resistance  
And hes in an awful jam
