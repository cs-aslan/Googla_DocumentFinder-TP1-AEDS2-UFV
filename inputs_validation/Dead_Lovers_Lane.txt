Despair has a face  
And all these wounds remain unhealed  
Blessed to kill and enslaved  
Are all hearts around loves will  
Thrilled to start all over again  
  
Crawl down dead lovers lane  
The maze of memories stained  
And suck the blood right out of my heart  
  
Fear has a name  
Written on unhallowed ground  
With dead leaves  
Those words never fail  
To feed the hunger that dreams  
Our needs beyond Gods grasp  
  
Crawl down dead lovers lane  
The maze of memories stained  
And suck the blood right out of my heart  
  
Scream out loves name in vain  
Embrace the pain again  
And lose yourself alone in the dark  
Dead lovers lane  
  
Crawl down dead lovers lane  
The maze of memories stained  
And suck the blood right out of my heart  
  
Scream out loves name in vain  
Embrace the pain again  
And lose yourself alone in the dark  
  
And suck the blood right out of my heart  
  
Right out of my heart
