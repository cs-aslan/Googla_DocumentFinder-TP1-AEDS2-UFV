Have I told you lately that I love you  
Have I told you theres no one else above you  
Fill my heart with gladness take away all my sadness  
Ease my troubles thats what you do  
  
For the morning sun in all its glory  
Meets the day with hope and comfort too  
You fill my life with laughter somehow you make it better  
Ease my troubles thats what you do  
  
Theres a love thats divine  
And its yours and its mine  
Like the sun  
And at the end of the day  
We should give thanks and pray  
To the one to the one
