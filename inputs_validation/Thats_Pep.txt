Vigor vim vitality and punch  
The ability to act on a sudden hunch  
Nerve to tackle the hardest thing  
Feet that climb and hands that cling  
A heart that never forgets to sing  
Thats pep Repeat x3  
  
Sand and grit in a concrete base  
A friendly smile on an honest face  
A spirit that helps when anothers down  
Knows how to scatter the blackest frown  
Loves its neighbor loves its town  
Thats pep Repeat x4  
  
Say I will for you know you can  
Look for the best in every man  
Meet each thundering knockout blow  
Come back with a smile cause you know  
You get the best of the whole damn show  
Thats pep Repeat x6  
  
You know thats pep
