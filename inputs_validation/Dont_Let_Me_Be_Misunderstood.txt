Baby you understand me now  
If sometimes you see that Im mad  
Doncha know that no one alive can always be an angel  
When everything goes wrong you see some bad  
  
Well Im just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood  
  
Ya know sometimes baby Im so carefree  
With a joy thats hard to hide  
Then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry  
And then you burn to see my other side  
  
But Im just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord please dont let me be misunderstood  
  
If I seem edgy  
I want you to know  
I never meant to take it out on you  
Life has its problems  
And I get more than my share  
But thats one thing I never mean to do  
  
Cause I love you  
Oh baby  
Im just human  
Dont you know I have faults like anyone  
  
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting  
Some little foolish thing  
Some simple thing that Ive done  
  
Cause Im just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord please dont let me be misunderstood  
  
Dont let me be misunderstood I try so hard  
So please dont let me be misunderstood
