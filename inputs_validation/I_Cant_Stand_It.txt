Its hard being a man  
Living in a garbage pail  
My landlady called me up oh  
She tried to hit me with a mop  
  
I cant stand it any more more  
I cant stand it any more more oh  
I cant stand it any more more  
  
But if baby would just come back itd be all right  
Yeah if baby would just come back it would be all right  
Come on baby  
  
I live with thirteen dead cats  
A purple dog that wears spats  
Theyre all living out in the hall  
And I cant stand it any more  
  
I cant stand it any more more  
I cant stand it any more more  
I cant stand it any more more  
  
But if baby would just come back itd be all right  
Oh if baby would just come back it would be all right  
Be all right now  
  
Come on baby  
  
Im tired of living all alone yeah  
Nobody ever calls me on the phone  
But when things are getting better  
I just play my music louder  
  
I cant stand it any more more  
I cant stand it any more more  
I cant stand it any more more  
I cant stand it I cant stand it  
I cant stand it I cant stand it
