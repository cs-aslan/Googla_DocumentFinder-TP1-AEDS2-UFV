Everything in your shadow turns to vapour  
You pierce my heart like it was paper  
Radios crackling with the headlines  
Sun upon your shoulder winds in the phone line  
American beauty will you be mine  
Out on this highway counting white lines  
  
I remember last summer drifting through our eyes  
Were in the high grass my finger in your hemline  
Boot heels click clacking honey when you shine  
All them blue skies   
American beauty wherever youd sigh  
Out on this highway counting white lines  
  
Your hand cups your breast pledging your time  
The things we carried shining skylines  
Falling sparrow sky torn apart  
Dark shining arrow your kiss pierces my heart  
American beauty forever mine  
Out on this highway counting white lines
