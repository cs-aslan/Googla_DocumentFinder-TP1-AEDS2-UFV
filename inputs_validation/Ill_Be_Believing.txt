When Im walking the straight and narrow  
Sometimes life throws a little curve  
If I slip on the stones beneath me  
Will I lose my nerve  
Looking up when Ive hit the bottom  
Giving thanks that the motions stopped  
I still have a rock to hold to  
If the bottom drops  
Out here on my own  
I wont be alone  
Ill keep believing You  
  
Chorus  
Ill be believing  
I will be believing  
Oh Ill be believing You  
Ill be believing  
I will be believing  
Oh Ill be believing You  
  
If I find all my hopes are hollow  
Even if all my wells run dry  
If Im left here with next to nothing  
And I dont know why  
Im here on my own  
I wont be alone  
Ill keep believing You  
  
Chorus 3X
