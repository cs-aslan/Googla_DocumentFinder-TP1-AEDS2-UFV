I woke up this mornin and the world was gray  
Havent seen the sun since they hauled me away  
The boss man says theres no use in tryin  
He wont let me color outside of the lines  
  
Got these chains on me  
And theyre draggin me down  
Got these chains on me  
Hear that clankin sound  
Got these chains on me  
Mister hear my song  
Dont say imagination is morally wrong  
  
Mmhmmhmm  
Drink of water boss  
  
As long as Ive been here I got nothin to show  
Try to make somethin but the boss says no  
Wanna be creative but the man wont hear it  
That big boss man is tryin to crush my spirit  
  
Got these chains on me  
They wont let me fly  
Got these chains on me  
Wont tell me why  
Got these chains on me  
Mister hear my song  
Dont say imagination is morally wrong  
No they wont let us dance or bang that gong  
Cause they say imagination is morally wrong
