Got a hole in my shoe  
And a bad case of the blues  
On top of that its raining too  
I picked a bad day to let you go  
  
I got nothing but time  
Nothing but you here on my mind  
I guess the stars got out of line  
I picked a bad day to let you go  
  
Chorus  
Why did I walk away  
I must have been crazy  
If I could relive that day  
Id make it right baby  
It was just the wrong frame of mind  
Wrong place wrong time but I know  
I picked a bad day to let you go  
  
Im staring holes through these walls  
Waitin on lady luck to call  
Girl Im only human after all  
Just picked a bad day to let you go  
  
Chorus  
Why did I walk away  
I must have been crazy  
Im paying for it everyday  
That youre gone baby  
It was just a wrong frame of mind  
Wrong place wrong time but I know  
I picked a bad day to let you go  
  
repeat first chorus
