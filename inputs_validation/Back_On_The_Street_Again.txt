I was so lonely until I met you  
Told myself Id get by without love  
Drownin my sorrows  
Avoiding tomorrows  
And I felt that I just had enough  
Your light on my face  
And your jokes and your smiles  
And the way that you came every night  
I dont what you got  
But Im sure glad I found you  
But I sure feels right  
Here I am  
Im back on the street again  
Here I am  
Im back on my feet again  
  
Surprised at myself  
By the way that I feel  
So happy that youre here with me  
Some men that Ive known have left me with nothing  
But I guess that was just meant to be  
Here I am  
Im back on the street again  
Here I am  
Im back on my feet again  
  
I was down for the count  
I was down I was beat I was cryin  
I was caught up in hate  
Hiding my face and got trying  
  
I was so lonely until I met you  
Told myself Id get by without love  
Drownin my sorrows  
Avoiding tomorrows  
And I felt like I just had enough  
Here I am  
Im back on the street again  
Here I am  
Im back on my feet again
