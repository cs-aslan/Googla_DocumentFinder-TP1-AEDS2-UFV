Youll find me in a Berlin bar  
In a corner brooding  
You know that I go very quiet  
When Im listening to you  
  
Theres something very special indeed  
In all the places where Ive seen you shine boy  
Theres something very real in how I feel honey  
  
Chorus  
Its in me  
Its in me  
And you know its for real  
Tuning in on your saxophone  
  
The candle burning over your shoulder is throwing  
Shadows on your saxophone a surly lady in tremor  
The stars that climb from her bowels  
Those stars make towers on vowels  
  
Youll never know that you had all of me  
Youll never know the poetry youve stirred in me  
Of all the stars Ive seen that shine so brightly  
Ive never known or felt in myself so rightly  
  
Chorus
