She hasnt that money to live a good life  
And she just cant wait to Saturday night

Chorus   
New York city girl the girl is mine  
New York city girl give her some time  
New York city girl oh here she comes  
New York city girl oh she wants fun  
Shes a New York city lover New York is the place to go  
And I swear there is no other and no better place I know  
  
Oh on lower east side shes working til 5  
Shes working so hard she has to survive  
And she just cant wait to Saturday night  
In New York New York New York  
On 5th avenue she look for her dreams  
They are so far but sometimes it seems  
She lives her life just on her own  
She need the city thats her home  
In New York New York New York
