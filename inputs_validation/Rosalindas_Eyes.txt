I play nights in the Spanish part of town  
Ive got music in my hands  
The work is hard to find  
But that dont get me down  
Rosalinda understands  
  
Crazy Latin dancing solo down in Herald Square  
Oh Havana Ive been searching for you everywhere  
And though Ill never be there  
I know what I would see there  
I can always find my Cuban skies  
In Rosalindas eyes  
  
When she smiles she gives everything to me  
When shes all alone she cries  
And Id do anything to take away her tears  
Because theyre Rosalindas eyes  
  
Senorita dont be lonely I will soon be there  
Oh Havana Ive been searching for you everywhere  
Ive got a chance to make it  
Its time for me to take it  
Ill return before the fire dies  
In Rosalindas eyes  
  
All alone in a Puerto Rican band  
Union wages wedding clothes  
Hardly anyone has seen how good I am  
But Rosalinda says she knows  
  
Crazy Latin dancing solo down in Herald Square  
Oh Havana Ive been searching for you everywhere  
And though Ill never be there  
I know what I would see there  
I can always find my Cuban skies  
In Rosalindas eyes
