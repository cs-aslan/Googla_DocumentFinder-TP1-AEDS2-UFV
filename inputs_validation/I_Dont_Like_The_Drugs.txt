Norm life baby  
were white and oh so hetero  
And our sex is missionary  
  
Norm life baby  
were quitters and were sober  
Our confessions will be televised   
  
You and I are underdosed and were ready to fall  
Raised to be stupid taught to be nothing at all  
  
I dont like the drugs but the drugs like me  
I dont like the drugs the drugs the drugs  
  
Norm life baby  
our god is white and unforgiving  
Were piss tested and were praying  
  
Norm life baby  
Im just a sample of a soul  
Made to look just like a human being  
  
Norm life baby  
were rehabbed and were ready  
For our 15 minutes of shame  
  
Norm life baby  
were talkshown and were pointing  
Just like christians at a suicide  
  
You and I are underdosed and were ready to fall  
Raised to be stupid taught to be nothing at all  
  
I dont like the drugs but the drugs like me  
I dont like the drugs the drugs the drugs  
  
theres a hole in our soul that we fill with dope  
And were feeling fine  
  
I dont like the drugs but the drugs like me  
I dont like the drugs the drugs the drugs
