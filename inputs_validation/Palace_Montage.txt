I played the state  
The capital  
And people said  
Dont stop  
Until you play the Palace  
You havent played the top  
For years I had it preached to me  
And drummed into my head  
Until you play the Palace  
You might as well be dead  
A team of hoofers was the headline  
At the Majestic down in Dallas  
But they canceled the day  
Their agent called to say  
You can open the bill at the palace  
So it became the Hall of Fame  
The Mecca of the trade  
When you had played the Palace  
You knew that you were made  
So I hope you understand my wondrous thrill  
cause Vaudevilles back as the Palace  
And Im on the bill  
  
Shine on  
Shine on  
Harvest moon  
Up in the sky  
I aint had no lovin  
Since January  
Febuary  
June or July  
  
Some of these days  
Your gonna miss me honey  
Some of these days  
Your gonna feel so lonely  
You miss my hugging  
You miss my kissing  
Youll miss me honey  
When Im far away  
  
Oh my man  
I love him so  
Hell never know  
All my life is just despaire  
But I dont care  
When he takes me in his arms  
The world is bright alright  
  
I dont care  
I dont care  
If people frown  
On me  
Im happy go lucky  
They say that Im plucky  
Contented and carefree  
I dont care  
I dont care  
If hes a clerk or just a millionare  
If Im not successful  
It wont be degressful  
cause I dont care  
  
And all around me  
I hear voices that I cant ignore  
The voices of the stars  
Who played the Palace long before  
The stars who entertained you  
Until the rafters rang  
You dont need there names  
For the whole world acclaims them  
For the wonderful songs they sang  
Theres Eddie Canter  
Georgie Jessle  
Louie Holts  
Johnson and olson  
Cowerson boys  
Howerdson boys  
Aand that singing fool Al Jolson  
And so with deep humility  
I stand in front of you  
Im proud to play the palace  
Its like a dream come true  
Which is why Id like to shout it up and down  
Just to tell Broadway  
That the two a day is back in town
