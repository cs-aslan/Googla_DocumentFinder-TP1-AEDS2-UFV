So thats what you look like  
  
At last I know  
  
Youre better better than a dream  
  
What you are is better far better than a dream  
  
Well I tried to picture your face  
  
But now I see you youre out of this world youre out of this sphere youre
out of that outer space  
  
Better better than a dream  
  
What is real is more ideal than a dream  
  
To see and hear you to be so near you is better better than a dream

Can this be a dream  
  
Can I still be asleep on the couch there  
  
Can this girl be really here  
  
She seems to know by sheer intuition how I landed in this condition  
  
Or does she know me the way I think the way that I drink the fact that I slept
all year  
  
But its not a dream cause look Ive got some words on the paper  
  
Steady boy dont faint or scream  
  
Dont ask who sent you this angel its better better than a dream
