Verse 1  
Running around chasing hearts  
Chasing bodies to fix the parts  
I dont know how I reached this place  
So far from heaven so far from grace  
  
PreChorus  
And I want to give in to the pressure  
Cause I feel like the citys got the better of me  
Oh this casual love isnt what it seems  
And I try to imagine something closer  
And somebody who is good for me  
Im so tired of all this searching  
Do I do I do I do I  
  
Chorus  
Go home to nothing or stay out for more  
Give in to someone or lock down my door  
Or drown all my shadows drown them like before  
Drowning shadows once more  
  
Verse 2  
The more I drink the more I drown  
If Im not thinking I wont lay down  
The more I rise above it all  
The less I care about the fall  
  
PreChorus  
And I want to give in to the pressure  
Cause I feel like the citys got the better of me  
Oh this casual love isnt what it seems  
And I try to imagine something closer  
And somebody who is good for me  
Im so tired of all this searching  
Do I do I do I do I  
  
Chorus  
Go home to nothing or stay out for more  
Give in to someone or lock down my door  
Or drown all my shadows drown them like before  
Drown them shadows once more  
Once more  
Once more ooh  
  
Chorus  
Go home to nothing or stay out for more  
Give in to someone or lock down my door  
Or drown all my shadows drown them like before  
Drown them shadows once more
