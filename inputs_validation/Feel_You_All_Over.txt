Feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
  
Would be beyond understatement to  
To simply say that I miss you  
And the sky outside is blue  
But my mind inside is too  
  
Dont think about it  
I only think about it  
When gets old  
  
When the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
And the stars come out  
I can feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
All over  
Feel you all over  
  
Every time I breathe  
Air into my lungs  
I can close my eyes  
And feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
All over  
Feel you all over  
  
God never makes mistakes I know  
So theres a reason you had to go  
Theres a reason for no more lies  
I just wish I knew what it was  
  
Dont think about it  
I only think about it  
When gets old  
  
When the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
And the stars come out  
I can feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
All over  
Feel you all over  
  
Every time I breathe  
Air into my lungs  
I can close my eyes  
And feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
All over  
Feel you all over  
  
And dont think about it no  
Suffer when the wind blows  
Dont think about it  
Suffer every time my heart goes  
  
When the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
And the stars come out  
I can feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
All over  
Feel you all over  
  
Every time I breathe  
Air into my lungs  
I can close my eyes  
And feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
All over  
Feel you all over  
  
When the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
And the stars come out  
I can feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
All over  
Feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
  
Every time I breathe  
Air into my lungs  
I can close my eyes  
And feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
Feel you all over me  
Feel you all over
