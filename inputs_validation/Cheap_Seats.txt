This town aint big this town aint small  
Its a little of both they say  
Our ball club may be minor league but at least its triple A  
We sit below the Marlboro man above the right field wall  
We do the wave all by ourself  
Hang off a blind man couldve made that call  
  
We like beer flat as can be  
We like our dogs with mustard and relish  
We got a great pitcher whats his name  
Well we cant even spell it  
We dont worry about the penant much  
We just like to see the boys hit it deep  
Theres nothing like the view from the cheap seats  
  
The game was close well call it a win  
Go off to toast the boys again  
That local band is back in town  
They got a kinda minor league sound  
Theyre not that bad theyre not that good  
But all in all its understood  
We wanna dance they wanna play  
We wouldnt have it any other way  
  
We like beer flat as can be  
We like our dogs with mustard and relish  
We got a great pitcher whats his name  
Well we cant even spell it  
We dont worry about the penant much  
We just like to see the boys hit it deep  
Theres nothing like the view from the cheap seats  
Cheap seats  
  
Now the majors called up oh whats his name  
And one more buildin rises come  
And suddenly were all grown up  
And this old town not quite so small  
But Ill always miss the middle size town  
In the middle of the middlewest  
With no name pitchers and local bands  
And mustard and relish and all the rest  
  
We like beer flat as can be  
We like our dogs with mustard and relish  
We got a great pitcher whats his name  
Well we cant even spell it  
We dont worry about the penant much  
We just like to see the boys hit it deep  
Theres nothing like the view from the cheap seats  
Cheap seats
