Went out walkin through the wood the other day  
And the world was a carpet laid before me  
The buds were bursting and the air smelled sweet and strange  
And it seemed about a hundred years ago  
  
Mary and I we would sit upon a gate  
Just gazin at some dragon in the sky  
What tender days we had no secrets hid away  
Well it seemed about a hundred years ago  
  
Now all my friends are wearing worried smiles  
Living out a dream of what they was  
Dont you think its sometimes wise not to grow up  
  
Went out walkin through the wood the other day  
Cant you see the furrows in my forehead  
What tender days we had no secrets hid away  
Now it seems about a hundred years ago  
  
Now if you see me drinkin bad red wine  
Dont worry bout this man that you love  
Dont you think its sometimes wise not to grow up  
  
Youre gonna kiss and say goodbye yeah I warn you  
Youre gonna kiss and say goodbye yeah I warn you  
Youre gonna kiss and say goodbye oh Lord I warn you  
And please excuse me while I hide away  
  
Call me lazy bones  
Aint got no time to waste away  
Lazy bones aint got no time to waste away  
Dont you think its just about time to hide away Yeah yeah
