Dont leave me dont leave me here  
On the dark side of the world  
  
My days are darker than your nights  
Since I lost you babe  
Since I lost you babe  
  
Im like an ember  
Fading out of sight  
One more tear and I know Ill disappear  
Bring back the sunshine  
That you took away  
  
Cause I need ya  
And I want ya  
Just dont think Im gonna make it without your love  
  
Dont you know  
Such a loneliness Ive never known  
Since I lost you babe  
Since I lost you babe  
Im like a woman who once knew splendor  
Now all her wealth and riches  
They are gone  
  
Bring back the sunshine  
That you took away  
Cause I need ya  
And I want ya  
And I just dont think Im gonna make it without your love  
  
Bring back the sunshine that you took away  
Now my future lies in back of me  
Since I lost you babe  
Since I lost you babe  
I walk this lonely road to eternity  
Just despair and emptiness everywhere  
  
Bring back the sunshine  
That you took away  
Cause I need ya  
And I want ya  
I just dont think Im gonna make it without your love  
  
Dont leave me dont leave me here  
On the dark side of the world  
  
Oh dont you leave me here  
On the dark side of the world  
Cause I need ya  
Oh you know I want ya  
Right here on the dark side of the world
