Weve bid our time  
All patience claimed  
Content with nothing  
Our lives lived not in vain  
  
Not in vain  
Its calling  
Its calling  
I fear the hold as met is end  
  
Its truth or consequences  
Each wall built must fall  
Its truth or consequences  
This wall will fall  
  
I fear the hold as met is end  
  
Im drowning  
Anger my bitter breath  
Im drowning  
  
Weve bid our time  
All patience claimed  
Content with nothing  
Our lives lived not in vain  
  
Its truth or consequences  
Each wall built must fall  
Its truth or consequences  
This wall will fall  
  
Im drowning  
Anger my bitter breath  
Its calling  
Anger my bitter breath
