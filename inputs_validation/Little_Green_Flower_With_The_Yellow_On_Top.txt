The little green flower with the yellow on top  
You told me the name but I soon forgot  
I know roses and forgetmenots whats  
That little green flower with the yellow on top  
We got married in a little white church  
I had a big red rose on my shirt  
You had some flowers but you gave them away  
And the little green flower was bloomin that day  
Its that little green flower with the yellow on top  
You told me the name but I soon forgot  
I know roses and forgetmenots whats  
That little green flower with the yellow on top  
Remember the night that I came home drunk  
Stopped in the driveway got you a bunch  
You got mad said they shouldnt be picked  
They were there next morning when I woke up sick  
Its that little green flower with the yellow on top  
You told me the name but I soon forgot  
I know roses and forgetmenots whats  
That little green flower with the yellow on top  
Its been a long time since I gave you that ring  
You often said I didnt know a bloomin thing  
But happy anniversary and look what I got  
Some little green flowers with the yellow on top
