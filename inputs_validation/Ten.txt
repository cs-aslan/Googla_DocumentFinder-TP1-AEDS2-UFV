Mm  
Mm  
  
I found out in the fall Ive been gone  
On the road for a year  
She said  
Honey Ive got real bad news and  
Then there were just tears  
And we would never be the same again  
Since then Ive often wondered  
What you might have been like  
How it would have felt to hold you  
Would you have my eyes  
Dont you think we wouldve been best friends  
  
You would be ten and Id be  
Driving you to school  
You would tell all your friends  
That you thought I was cool  
And you would have  
All the love in my heart  
Yeah you would have  
All the love in my heart  
  
We were twentytwo years young then  
Breaking rules all around  
We were  
Moving in that first apartment  
It felt like it was never gonna end  
Both so lost and crazy  
We were young so we ran  
Now I live in a dream where I am  
Holding your little hands  
I never got to meet you my best friend  
  
You would be ten and Id be  
Driving you to school  
You would tell all your friends  
That you thought I was cool  
You would be out in the sun  
Until it was gone  
You would be watching Star Wars  
With your PJs on  
And you would have  
All the love in my heart  
Yeah you would have  
All the love in my heart  
  
Mm  
Mm  
  
Dont you think we would have been best friends  
  
You would be ten and Id be  
Driving you to school  
You would tell all your friends  
That you thought I was cool  
You would be out in the sun  
Until it was gone  
You would be watching Star Wars  
With your PJs on  
You would be playing tunes on  
On your first guitar  
You would be harmony to  
Every single part of me  
And you have  
All the love in my heart  
Yeah you would have  
All the love in my heart  
  
Mm  
Mm
