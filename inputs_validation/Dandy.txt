Dandy Dandy  
Where you gonna go now  
Who you gonna run to  
All you life  
Youre chasing all the girls  
They cant resist your smile  
Oh they long for Dandy Dandy  
  
Checkin out the ladies  
Tickling their fancy  
Pouring out your charm  
To meet all your own demands  
And turn it off at will  
Oh they long for Dandy Dandy  
  
Knockin on the back door  
Climbing through the window  
Hubbys gone away  
And while the cats away  
The mice are gonna play  
Oh you low down Dandy Dandy  
Dandy  
  
Dandy you know youre moving much too fast  
And Dandy you know you cant escape the past  
Look around you and see the people settle down  
And when youre old and grey you will remember what they said  
That two girls are too many threes a crowd and four youre dead  
  
Oh Dandy Dandy  
When you gonna give up  
Are you feeling old now  
You always will be free  
You need no sympathy  
A bachelor you will stay  
And Dandy youre all right  
Youre all right  
Youre all right  
Youre all right  
Youre all right  
Youre all right
