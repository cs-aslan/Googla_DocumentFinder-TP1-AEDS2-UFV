Girl when the moon across the water starts to rise  
Ill be looking for tomorrow and Ill see it in your eyes  
Girl though the strongest heartll shatter in a storm  
Now we got this love that we can run to  
Tonight Ill keep you warm  
  
Chorus  
Man to woman  
When youre lying next to me  
Man to woman  
Girl youre everything I need  
Hold on well always be  
Always you and me  
Hold me close  
Youre the nearest thing to heaven that Ive known  
I can feel the fire that burns inside you  
Look how this love has grown  
  
Chorus  
Man to woman man to woman  
Man to woman man to woman  
Just say well always be  
Always you and me  
I want to hold you in the night  
Cant you see  
That Im just livin for your light  
I want the world to know  
I cant let you go  
  
Chorus  
Man to woman man to woman  
Man to woman man to woman  
I want the world to see  
Baby what you mean to me
