Im not a perfect person  
Theres many things I wish I didnt do  
But I continue learning  
I never meant to do those things to you  
And so I have to say before I go  
That I just want you to know  
  
Ive found a reason for me  
To change who I used to be  
A reason to start over new  
And the reason is you  
  
Im sorry that I hurt you  
Its something I must live with every day  
And all the pain I put you through  
I wish that I could take it all away  
And be the one who catches all your tears  
Thats why I need you to hear  
  
Ive found a reason for me  
To change who I used to be  
A reason to start over new  
And the reason is you  
  
And the reason is you  
And the reason is you  
And the reason is you  
  
Im not a perfect person  
I never meant to do those things to you  
And so I have to say before I go  
That I just want you to know  
  
Ive found a reason for me  
To change who I used to be  
A reason to start over new  
And the reason is you  
  
Ive found a reason to show  
A side of me you didnt know  
A reason for all that I do  
And the reason is you
