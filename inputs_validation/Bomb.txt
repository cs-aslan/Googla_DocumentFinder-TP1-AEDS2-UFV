Im just tryna beat it up he could it acapella  
We should go back to my crib thats what Ima tell her  
Bring one or two of them cause your friends looking kinda jealous  
Rolling papers like propellers blowing mozzarella  
Lotta niggas in the club who cares Im the realest  
Tell the waiters we gon need more cases  
And when you think the moneys gone we spending more faces  
She with homeboy but she want this  
Six cars eight chains three cribs one Wiz  
  
She thick in her hips Cold than a mother  
Licking her lips a bad mothersucker  
Apple looking so right she make me want a piece  
I give it to her all night so she dont wanna leave

And theres so much ice up on my neck it look like I play hockey  
So hold up nigga stop me

Any stage or any beat you know Ima body  
And Wiz roll that good shit up and he riding shotty

Licking her lips a bad mothersucker  
Apple looking so right she make me want a piece  
I give it to her all night so she dont wanna leave  
  
If you got that bombbombbabombbabombbomb  
Know you got that bombbombbabombbabombbomb  
Ladies put ya hands up if you got bombbomb
