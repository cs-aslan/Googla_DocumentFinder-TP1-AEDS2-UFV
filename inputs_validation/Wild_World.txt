Now that Ive lost everything to you  
You say you want to start something new  
And its breaking my heart youre leaving  
Baby Im grieving  
But if you want to leave take good care  
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear  
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there  
  
Ooh baby baby its a wild world  
Its hard to get by just upon a smile  
Ooh baby baby its a wild world  
Ill always remember you like a child girl  
  
You know Ive seen a lot of what the world can do  
And its breaking my heart in two  
Cause I never want to see you sad girl  
Dont be a bad girl  
But if you want to leave take good care  
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there  
But just remember theres a lot of bad and beware  
  
Oh baby baby its a wild world  
Its hard to get by just upon a smile  
Oh baby baby its a wild world  
And Ill always remember you like a child girl  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la  
Baby I love you  
  
But if you want to leave take good care  
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there  
But just remember theres a lot of bad and beware  
  
Well baby baby its a wild world  
Its hard to get by just upon a smile  
Ooh baby baby its a wild world  
And Ill always remember you like a child girl  
  
Ooh baby baby its a wild world  
Its hard to get by just upon a smile  
Ooh baby baby its a wild world  
And Ill always remember you like a child girl
