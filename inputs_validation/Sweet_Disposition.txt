Sweet Disposition  
Never Too Soon  
Oh Reckless Abandon  
  
Like No Ones Watching You  
No One  
  
A moment a love  
A dream aloud  
A kiss a cry  
Our rights our wrongs  
A moment a love  
A dream aloud  
A moment a love  
A dream aloud  
  
So stay there  
Because Ill be coming over  
And while our bloods still young  
Its so young  
It runs  
And we wont stop until its over  
Wont stop to surrender  
  
Songs of desperation  
I played them for you  
A moment a love  
A dream aloud  
A kiss a cry  
Our rights our wrongs  
A moment a love  
A dream aloud  
A moment a love  
A dream aloud  
  
So stay there  
Because Ill be coming over  
And while our bloods still young  
Its so young  
It runs  
And we wont stop until its over  
Wont stop to surrender
