If half of what Im saying of what Im saying is true  
Will you rub my head make it all shiny and new  
And you drag my coat tails drag my coat tails down  
And Ill be the only cold assed king around  
If you wait Ill give all my aches to you  
Take the chance to ignore what youre going through  
My cold hand is there for you to take  
If you leave can I fall down  
Im your Berlin chair wont you lean on me til I break  
  
Ill ignore each golden dragging kiss you can give  
On the blankest face that you ever had to forgive  
If you see my failings see my failings through  
Im the rerun that youll always force yourself to sit through  
  
If you wait Ill give all my aches to you  
Take the chance to ignore what youre going through  
My cold hand is there for you to take  
If you leave can I fall down  
Im your Berlin chair wont you lean on me til I break  
  
Well youre too late Youre too late  
Youre too late
