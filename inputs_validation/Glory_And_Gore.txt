Theres a humming in the restless summer air  
And were slipping off the course that we prepared  
But in all chaos there is calculation  
Dropping glasses just to hear them break  
Youve been drinking like the world was gonna end it didnt  
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend go figure  
Its clear that someones gotta go  
We mean it but I promise were not mean  
  
And the cry goes out ha  
They lose their minds for us and how it plays out ha  
Now were in the ring and were coming for blood  
  
Oh Oh  
You could try and take us ohoh  
But were the gladiators Oh Oh  
Everyone a rager ohoh  
But secretly theyre saviors  
Glory and gore go hand in hand  
Thats why were making headlines Oh Oh  
You could try and take us ohoh  
But victorys contagious  
  
Delicate in every way but one the swordplay  
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun the old way  
Chance is the only game I play with baby  
We let our battles choose us  
  
And the cry goes out ha oh  
They lose their minds for us and how it plays out ha oh  
Now were in the ring and were coming for blood  
  
Oh Oh  
You could try and take us ohoh  
But were the gladiators Oh Oh  
Everyone a rager ohoh  
But secretly theyre saviors  
Glory and gore go hand in hand  
Thats why were making headlines Oh Oh  
You could try and take us ohoh  
But victorys contagious  
  
Noone round heres good at keeping their eyes closed  
The suns starting to light up when were walking home  
Tired little laughs gold lie promises  
Well always win at this I dont ever think about death  
Its alright if you do its fine  
We gladiate but I guess were really fighting ourselves  
Roughing up our minds so were ready when the kill time comes  
Wide awake in bed words in my brain  
Secretly you love this do you even wanna go free  
Let me in the ring Ill show you what that big word means  
  
Oh Oh  
You could try and take us ohoh  
But were the gladiators Oh Oh  
Everyone a rager ohoh  
But secretly theyre saviors  
Glory and gore go hand in hand  
Thats why were making headlines Oh Oh  
You could try and take us ohoh  
But victorys contagious
