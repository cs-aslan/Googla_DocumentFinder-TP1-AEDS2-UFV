Its good to see that I can cry again  
Now I return to life and live again  
As the teardrops wash the heartaches from a man  
Im glad to say that I can cry again  
So long my pride would not let my tears to fall  
I walk walk to burning hell and never cry at all  
As the teardrops wash the heartaches from a man  
Im glad to say that I can cry again  
  
So long my pride would not let my tears to fall  
I walk walk to burning hell and never cry at all  
As the teardrops wash the heartaches from a man  
Its good to know that I can cry again  
Im glad to say that I can cry again
