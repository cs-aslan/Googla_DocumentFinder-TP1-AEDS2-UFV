I hope its too late  
And youre already to far gone  
cause my heart aches  
Whenever Im away too long  
  
cause if I miss you even by a minute  
Ill lose my whole world everything in it  
I never wanna say goodbye  
  
Baby cause I hope its too late  
To change your mind  
cause Im never changing mine  
And I I just gotta say its gotta be you  
Until the end of time  
And I hope its too late  
  
Turn back  
We cant turn back the hands of time  
It was over  
The moment that your eyes met mine  
  
And now I find  
When Im with you hours seem like minutes  
Youre my whole world  
Everything thats it in  
Nobodys gonna say goodbye  
  
Baby cause I hope its too late  
To change your mind  
cause Im never changing mine  
And I I just gotta say its gotta be you  
Until the end of time  
And I hope its too late  
  
Time keeps ticking away  
If Im right here never escape  
Baby cause I hope its too late  
Dont wanna say goodbye  
  
Baby cause I hope its too late  
To change your mind  
cause Im never changing mine  
And I I just gotta say its gotta be you  
Until the end of time  
And I hope its too late  
  
Tell me its too late  
And youre already too far gone
