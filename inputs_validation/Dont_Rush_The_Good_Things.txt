Bought me a bottle of wine  
Im gonna drink it tonight  
And you can join me  
Its gonna make us feel alright  
Dont rush the good things  
Dont rush the good things in life  
Dont rush the good things  
Dont rush the good things in life  
Im gonna sip it slowly  
Im not gonna rock it back  
I am no historier but I  
Ive learned from my past what Ive learned  
Dont rush the good things  
Dont rush the good things in life  
Dont rush the good things  
Dont rush the good things in life  
Its a slow job falling in love  
Its a slow job falling in love  
Its a slow job  
Dont rush good things tonight  
You and me baby  
No need to rush it tonight  
Cause we got all the time in the world  
To get it right get it right get it right get it right  
Get get get get get it get it get  
Dont rush the good things  
Dont rush the good things in life  
Dont rush the good things  
Dont rush the good things in life  
Cause its a slow job falling in love  
Its a slow job tonight  
Its a slow job falling in love

Dont rush the good things  
Dont rush the good things in life  
Dont rush the good things

I said we got all the time in the world  
Get it right get it right get it right get it right  
Get get get get get it get it get
