Baby I know the story  
Ive seen the picture  
Its written all over your face  
Tell me whats the secret that youve been hiding  
And whos gonna take my place  
I should have seen it coming  
I should have read the signs  
Anyway I guess its over  
  
Chorus  
Cant believe that Im a fool again  
I thought this love would never end  
How was I to know  
You never told me  
Cant believe that Im a fool again  
And I who thought you were my friend  
How was I to know  
You never told me  
  
Baby you shouldve called me  
When you were lonely  
When you needed me to be there  
Sadly you never gave me  
Too many chances to show you  
How much I care  
Ooh should have seen it coming  
I should have read the signs  
Anyway I guess its over  
  
Chorus  
  
About the pain and the tears  
Ooh If I could  
I would turn back the time  
Ooh yeah I should have seen it coming  
I should have read the signs  
Anyway I guess its over  
  
Chorus
