The grey mist ushers in the day  
A beggar walks along the kings highway  
Where does he come from who can tell  
They cant escape the gaze they know so well  
The dream came true in far off lands  
He always knew shed understand  
The march of time her love did wane  
Anothers crime played on the ladys pain  
And now the ring shines in her hand  
Whos the stranger with her wedding band  
With faith so true robbed of his lands  
He always knew shed understand
