Heres a glue guy performance god  
A makeshift shrine a newly lain sod  
Hardly even tryin gives the nod  
I sure hope Im not the type to dwell  
Hope Im a fast healer fast as hell  
Heaven is a better place today because of this  
But the world is just not the same  
If and when you get into the end zone  
Act like youve been there a thousand times before  
Dont blame dont say people lose people all the time anymore  
A toonie to the busker and a husky keep it comin under my breath  
But then said Though if you wouldnt mind  
Less cryin and more tryin more tryin and less cryin  
Im not the type to dwell  
Im a fast healer fast as hell  
Heaven is a better place today because of this  
But the world is just not the same  
Oh if and if and when you get into the end zone  
Act like youve been there a thousand times before  
Dont blame dont say people lose people all the time anymore  
Dont say people lose people all the time anymore  
If and when you get into that end zone  
Act like youve been there a thousand times before  
Dont change but dont say people lose people all the time anymore  
Ooh its just not the same because of this  
Ooh its not the same
