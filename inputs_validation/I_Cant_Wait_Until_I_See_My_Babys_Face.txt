I cant wait until I see my my babys face  
When I tell him that Im through  
Yes Im through with him  
Cause hes been running round  
And I got to to put him down  
I cant wait to see the look  
The look in his eyes  
  
I wonder if hell cry  
When I tell him this is goodbye yes it is  
Or will he try to change my mind  
And make me stay yeah  
  
Or will he turn around  
And with a smile on his face  
Just walk away  
Just walk away  
  
I cant wait until I see my my babys face  
Gotta find out what I mean  
What I mean to him  
Cause just one tear is all hes got to to shed for me  
And I know that l will run yes Ill run to him  
Ill hold him tight  
Never never let him go nooo  
  
And I cant wait until I see my my babys face  
You know I just cant wait until I see my babys babys face  
You know I just cant wait until I see my my babys face  
I cant wait until I
