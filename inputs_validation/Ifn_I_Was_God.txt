Ifn I was God  
Well just for spite  
I wouldnt set the sun at night  
Til everyone was treated right  
By everyone else they see  
  
Ifn I was God  
Id fix it so without explaining  
Folks would know theyd know  
Whats going on inside  
Of everyone else like me  
  
Nobody hurt nobody else  
Oh no I wouldnt let it be  
Nobody have a need to pray  
Except for thanking me  
  
Ifn I was God  
Id make us wise  
So everyone could realize  
That everywhere beneath the sun  
Everyone needs everyone  
  
And God that in heaven what I would do  
Ifn I was you  
Ifn I was God  
Love each other reach out  
And touch somebodys hand
