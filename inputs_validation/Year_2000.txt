I wanna speak to you motherfuckers for a minute  
Yea thanks for the lighter  
Anybody smoke here  
Aight thats more for me you punk  
Motherfuckers  
Look check it out look  
verse 1  
Everybody he was born to hustle  
Its a very thin line between the boss  
And the muscle  
We foot soldiers  
Face first in the trenches  
Only time Im on my back is fucking these  
Hoes and weight bitches  
Hells kitchen raw kitchen  
Never crying and bitching and settling  
For less  
Metal in your chest take a final breath  
Revolutionary  
Its xman the mercenary  
Carry a 44 desert eagle  
Feeding the people even if it aint legal  
Lowriding in the regal or the cadillac  
Money stacked probably give yo ass a  
Heart attack  
Purchased your last cd I want my money  
Back  
You see the battle ima see you in the  
Street  
Survival of the first to draw the heaters  
And the cannons  
Im guaranteed to be the last man standing  
chorus 2x  
Crack a bottle for your hard time  
Its dedicated to my soldiers on the  
Front line  
This ones for all of us  
Thinking bout your casualties  
Learn from mistakes protect your family  
Cause its the year 2000  
verse 2  
Everybody wannabe king  
Fuck everything  
All this shit is bout to me mine  
I hear it all the time  
Live your life for the day  
Easier to burn than papiermache  
Started with dre  
Graduate to radioplay  
I still aint satisfied  
Bout to blast off worldwide  
Get in line check the politics  
Ever wonder why only certain  
Motherfuckers get rich  
Aint this a bitch  
Barely can eat barely can pee  
I dedicate my life to the street  
Its not for you if your stomach is weak  
Relax with dead bodies covered with sheets  
Thats the only time I really find peace  
Having violent standoffs with the police  
North hollywood beef  
Grinding my teeth  
Have you stuck and stunned in disbelief  
New breed Im the bad seed  
Smoke your weed til my mothafucking eyes  
Bleed  
Dedicated to the niggas that despise us  
So aint nobody sposed to be here  
Besides us  
Catch a flatline  
chorus 2x  
verse 3  
I was one that never begged for nothing  
Me and my homies build penitentiary  
Huffit  
Running your mouth like a bitch cause you  
All on my dick  
What is he dogg pound now is he still  
With tha liks  
Is he rich is xzibit a crip this is  
Business stay the fuck out of my family shit  
A grown man the back of my hand is what  
You will see  
If the xfives make you believe  
You check the sound scan I do the math  
Me and my staff run a worldwide warpath  
A bloodbath make xzibit have a good laugh  
Its going down hit the ground like a  
Plane crash  
You lil fags aint prepared for the xman  
Scared and desperate  
Young and restless  
There is no guest list  
Move to the back of the line  
Yo its my time prime time only where the  
Beats and the rhyme shine  
chorus 2x
