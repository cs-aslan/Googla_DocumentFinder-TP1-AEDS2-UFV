Dont ever say you do  
Dont ever say you want to make me shine  
You keep your mystery dont ever try  
To be my guiding light  
Mmm  
  
Dont ever say you care  
Dont follow when Im here and everywhere  
Im blinded by your looks but theres a scent  
Of heartache in the air  
In the air  
Hey you  
Walk out through that door  
And into that dream  
Where I met you before  
Oh oh  
  
Babe you seduce me  
You take my heart and use me  
My feelings all run wild  
When you seduce me all the time  
  
Dont ever call me up  
I never wanna hear your voice again  
Oh lay your pretty hands on someone else  
Somebody who dont know you well  
Know you well  
  
Hey you  
Your sweet sweet talk cant stay  
And get back to that dream  
Lets both keep it that way  
Hey hey  
  
Oh you seduce me  
You pull my heart and use me  
And I keep running blind  
When you seduce me all the time  
Mmmm get back to that dream  
Lets both keep it that way  
Hey hey  
Tell me once again  
  
You seduce me  
You take my heart and use me  
My feelings all run wild  
When you seduce me all the time  
When you seduce me all the time  
You seduce me all the time  
You seduce me
