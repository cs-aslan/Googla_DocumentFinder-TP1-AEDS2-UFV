Theres been a sayin goin round  
And I begin to think its true  
Its awful hard to love someone  
When they dont care about you  
  
Once I had a lovin gal  
The sweetest little thing in town  
But now shes gone and left me  
She done turn me down  
  
Now I aint got nobody and nobody cares for me  
Thats why Im sad and lonely  
Wont somebody come and take a chance with me  
  
Ill sing you love songs honey all the time  
If youll only say youll be sweet gal of mine  
Oh I aint got nobody nobody cares for me  
  
Ill sing you love songs honey all the time  
If youll only say youll be sweet gal of mine  
Oh I aint got nobody nobody cares for me
