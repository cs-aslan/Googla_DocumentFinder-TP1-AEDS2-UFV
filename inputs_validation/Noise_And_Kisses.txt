Look in my eyes  
Im jaded now whatever that means  
By sharing these things  
I rip my heart out  
Its worth my time  
Whatever that means  
Hard to see up  
My neck feels stiff until I wake up  
The orange I choked  
And back to my neck  
Its worth my time  
Whatever that means so  
  
Share with me  
Cause I need it right now  
Let me see your insides  
Or write me off  
Cause Id rather stop now  
If you wont open up  
  
Give it to me  
Give me all whatever you want  
Its never been me  
To want this much from you  
I can see  
It tears me up
