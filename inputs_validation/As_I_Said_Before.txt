And I said before  
I dont want no more  
And I cant complain  
cause my minds insane  
I wont say it again and I wont even think about it  
I just hope you believe me but I  
Think that youre gonna doubt it  
When I say it again  
As I said before  
I dont want no more  
And I cant complain  
cause my minds insane  
I wont say it again and I wont even think about it  
I just hope you believe me but I  
Think that youre gonna doubt it  
When I say it again  
Leaves on the trees  
Nothing more to believe  
I cant be sure  
And I know Im not crazy  
Life is just a pleasant breeze  
Tides rush the shore  
Pleasing me a little more  
Nothing here to fight me  
Everything delights me  
Hope I get my tea by 4  
But dont lay no second laughs down my way  
Dont let the evenings that devour you lie forever  
Dont you lay no second laughs down my way  
Dont let the evenings that devour you lie forever  
As I said before  
I dont want no more  
And I cant complain  
cause my minds insane  
I wont say it again and I wont even think about it  
I just hope you believe me but I  
Think that youre gonna doubt it  
When I say it again
