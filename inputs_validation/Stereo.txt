Stereo  
We hear both sides  
We sympathize  
We live our lives in stereo  
The left and the right  
The dark and the light  
We wrestle with the balance  
We change our tone  
We leave our phone  
And tape record our absence  
In lovin memory  
  
Stereo  
Were livin it in stereo  
We fix it so our love is high fidelity  
Mix it so we never lose the melody  
We try to equalize our lives in stereo  
  
So on we go  
From side to side  
As we divide  
A single life in stereo  
The far and the wide  
We override  
The feedback from the others  
The unkind phrase  
We lock in phase  
Were only really listening to the stereo  
  
Stereo  
Were livin it in stereo  
We tune it till we have a perfect parody  
Commune with such a finecut crystal clarity  
It seems to symbolize  
Our lives in stereo  
  
Oo la la la la la la yeah yeah yeah  
Oo la la la la la la yeah yeah yeah  
Oo la la la laa  
  
Stereo  
Stereo  
We fix it so our love is high fidelity  
Mix it so we never lose the melody  
We try to equalize our lives in stereo  
  
Stereo  
Stereo  
We fix it so our love is high fidelity  
Mix it so we never lose the melody  
We try to equalize our lives in stereo
