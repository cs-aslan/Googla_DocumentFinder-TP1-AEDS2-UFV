Wont do no good to hold no seance  
Whats gone is gone and you cant bring it back around  
Wont do no good to hold no searchlight  
You cant illuminate what time has anchored down  
  
Oh honey Ive gone away  
Honey Ive gone away  
Ive gone away  
  
Wont do no good to sing no love song  
No sound could simulate the presence of a man  
Wont do no good asking no questions  
Your divination should acquaint you with the plan  
  
Oh honey Ive gone away  
Honey Ive gone away  
Honey Ive gone away  
  
Chorus  
I feel for you boy  
Is decaying in front of me  
Like the carrion of a murdered prey  
And all I want is to save you honey  
Or the strength to walk away  
  
Wont do no good to go no distance  
The space between us is a boundless as the dark  
Wont do no good to throw no fist babe  
You cant intimidate me back into your arms  
  
Cause honey Ive gone away  
Honey Ive gone away  
Ive gone away  
  
I feel for you boy  
Is decaying right in front of me  
Like the carrion of a murdered prey  
And all I want is to save you honey  
Or the strength to walk away  
  
Chorus x3
