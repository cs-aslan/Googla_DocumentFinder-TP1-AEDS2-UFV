A million stars light  
This beautiful night  
This is not a night to die  
Let me sing and dance beneath the sky  
I have such love to giveto give  
I want a chance to live  
  
Live for the one I love  
Love as no one has loved  
Give asking nothing in return  
  
Free free to find my way  
Free to have my say  
Free to see the day  
Be like I used to be  
Like Im wild bird free  
With all of life in me  
  
Live for the one I love  
Love as no one has loved  
Give asking nothing in return  
  
Though this world tears us apart  
Were still together in my heart  
I want the world to hear my cry  
And even if I have to die  
Love will not die  
Love will change the world  
  
Live for the one I love  
Love like no one has loved  
Give asking nothing in return  
  
Ill love until love wears me away  
Ill die and I know my love will stay  
And I know my love will stay
