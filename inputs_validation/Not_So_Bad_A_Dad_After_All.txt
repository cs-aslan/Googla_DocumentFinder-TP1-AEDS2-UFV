You were a substandard dad  
But the only one I had  
I grew up hearing your evil scheming down the hall  
  
But when I look at this thing  
It makes me wanna sing  
Maybe youre not so bad a dad after all  
  
At my first ever swim meet  
You stepped on the other teams feet  
At my recital you clapped louder than you should  
  
But when you taught me how to drive  
We actually made it home alive  
I guess its possible not every part of you isnt good  
  
I know at times I would cringe  
Like when you wore all that fringe  
And when you went out of your way to catch that foul ball boos  
  
But this piece of plastic in my hand  
Makes me finally understand  
Maybe youre not so bad a dad  
Not so bad a dad after all
