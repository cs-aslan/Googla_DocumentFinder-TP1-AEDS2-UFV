Well I used to know someone fair  
She had orange ribbons in her hair  
She was such a trip  
She was hardly there  
But I loved her  
Just the same  
  
There was rain in our window  
The FM set was ragged  
But she could talk yeah  
We learned to speak  
  
And one year  
Has gone by  
  
Such a long long road to seek it  
All we did was break and freak it  
We had all  
That lovers ever had  
We just blew it  
And Im not sad  
  
Well Im mad  
  
And Im bad  
  
And two years  
Have gone by  
  
Now her world was bright orange  
And the fire glowed  
And her friend had a baby  
And she lived with us  
Yeah we broke through the window  
Yeah we knocked on the door  
Her phone would not answer  
Yeah but shes still home  
  
Now her father has passed over  
And her sister is a star  
And her mother smokes diamonds  
And she sleeps out in the car  
  
Yeah but she remembers Chicago  
The musicians and guitars  
And grass by the lake  
And people who laughd  
And made her poor heart ache  
  
Now we live down in the valley  
We work out on the farm  
We climb up to the mountains  
And everythings fine  
  
And Im still here  
And youre still there  
And were still around
