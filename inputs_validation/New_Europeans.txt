In a quiet street washed by the rain the room within the home  
A lonely man sits cheek to cheek with unique designs in chrome  
The mellow years have long gone by but now he sits alone  
He has a brand new radio but never turns it on  
  
Chorus  
New Europeans  
Young Europeans  
New Europeans  
  
A photograph of lovers lost lies pressed in magazines  
Her eyes belong to a thousand girls shes the wife whos never seen  
Their educated son has left in search of borrowed dreams  
His televisions in his bed hes frozen to the screen  
  
Chorus  
  
On a crowded beach washed by the sun he puts his headphones on  
His modern world revolves around the synthesizers song  
Full of future thoughts and thrills his senses slip away  
Hes a European legacy a culture for today  
  
Chorus  
  
Young Europeans
