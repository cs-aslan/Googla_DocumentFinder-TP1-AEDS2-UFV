Uh they call me G H E T T O nigga  
Uh uh Im back on that bullshit  
Ha ha who could fuck around Huh Uh  
I bet you look at things from a different perspective  
When you see the size of the slugs the fifth or the tech get  
A couplell lift a detective and make sure the legs  
That he used to walked with is defective  
All you niggas do is sit on blocks and jive  
About whos the baddest bitch and if Pacs alive  
Nigga Im in a aqua five with a button  
That make the roof flip back like pocket knives  
I cant knock ya drive you feelin like Rocky  
Till you get a beatin like he got in Rocky 5  
The squadll still hold toast and get these bitches  
To open they legs wider than a field goal post  
Broke niggas dont wanna stand my grind so they knock it  
Think my jeans got Mickey Ds signs on my pockets  
The hydro combined with the chocolate have ya eyes  
Lookin like the tall dude who signed with the Rockets  
The flow is so sick sooner or later  
These niggas gonna need barf bags bigger than golf bags  
The coke get flew on planes monthly and cops search me  
For weapons harder than they do in Hussein country  
And any chick that get a view of the chain wit me  
I guess thats what Jay meant by chain reactions  
Bitch its nothin to thumb off some notes  
Fuck a dealer I get em when they come off the boat fucka  
Yeah ghetto Fab nigga uh uh Street Family

You could love Fab hate Fab I dont care
