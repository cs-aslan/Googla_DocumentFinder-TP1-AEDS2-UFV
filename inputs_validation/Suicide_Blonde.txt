Dont you know what youre doing  
Youve got a death wish  
  
Suicide blonde Repeat x4  
  
Suicide blonde was the color of her hair  
Like a cheap distraction for a new affair  
She knew it would finish before it began  
Wow baby I think you lost the plan  
  
You want to make her suicide blonde  
Love devastation suicide blonde  
You want to make her suicide blonde  
Love devastation suicide blonde  
  
She stripped to the beat but her clothes stay on  
White light everywhere but you cant see a thing  
Such a squeeze  
A mad sad moment  
Glory to you  
Glory to you  
Take me there  
Take me there  
  
Got some revelation  
Put into your hands  
Save you from your misery like rain across the land  
Dont you see the color of deception  
Turning your world around again  
  
Thats the story
