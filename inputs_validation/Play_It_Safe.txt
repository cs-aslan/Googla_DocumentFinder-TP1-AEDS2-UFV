Say Ta  
Eisenhower saw the thing  
He said this is sickening  
I swear I saw the very thing  
I saw it in America  
  
Lets play safe  
I never knew how  
How to play safe  
You told me how  
how to play safe  
A thousand times  
  
I dont believe in fairies any more  
  
Today I saw a very very thing  
But thats another song  
Youre too simple minded  
Lets play it safe  
  
What do we have in common  
Play it safe  
What do we have in common  
Play it safe  
  
I want to be a criminal  
Play it safe
