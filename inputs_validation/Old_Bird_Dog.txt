Sometimes Im mad at the world  
Mad at this town  
Mad cause I cant lose the same five pounds  
That Ive been tryin to lose for three or four years now  
  
Sometimes I feel like a truck that just wont run  
On the side of the road in the July sun  
There aint another car for miles  
That I can thumb down  
  
I guess every now and then  
Youre going to land on a bad day  
Though I still do  
I know I cant complain  
  
Cause I love what I do  
Love where Im at  
The stage my band and my old black hat  
My big wool blanket  
Sleepin in my cowboy boots  
I love my old bird dog  
I like to watch him run  
My red guitar I bang around on some  
And I love lovin you  
Baby I love lovin you  
  
Now heaven to me its a simple thing  
Its just you and me  
And a phone that dont ring  
Popcorn poppin on a lay around Friday night  
  
Seein you smile when I wake up  
The way you slide to the middle of my pick up truck  
The way you say baby its all gonna be all right  
When I walk in at the end of a worn out day  
And I see you baby how can I complain  
  
Cause I love what I do  
Love where Im at  
The stage my band and my old black hat  
My big wool blanket  
Sleepin in my cowboy boots  
I love my old bird dog  
I like to watch him run  
My red guitar I bang around on some  
And I love lovin you  
Baby I love lovin you  
Yes I do  
  
Well I love where Ive been  
I dont look back  
I thank God for the life he lets me have  
My big wool blanket  
Sleepin in my cowboy boots  
I love my old bird dog  
I like to watch him run  
My red guitar I bang around on some  
And I love loving you  
Baby I love lovin you  
  
Baby I love  
Oh yes I do  
Love lovin you  
  
I love my old bird dog  
I like to watch him run  
  
Lovin you
