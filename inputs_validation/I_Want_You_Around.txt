I want you around I want you around  
  
Theyre telling us  
Theyre gonna make a fuss  
About the two of us  
  
I want you around  
I want you around  
  
I know what youre thinking about  
That you must have some doubts  
I know what youre thinking  
When you find out I want you around  
  
You know if it comes true  
Ill be so good to you  
Ill never treat you cruel  
As long as Ive got you around  
  
I want you around  
I want you around  
  
You heard that Im no good  
Yeah yeah Im no good  
But Ill treat you like I should  
  
I want you around  
I want you around  
  
You know if it comes true  
Ill be so good to you  
Ill never treat you cruel  
As long as Ive got you around  
  
I want you around I want you around  
  
Theyre telling us  
Theyre gonna make a fuss  
About the two of us  
  
I want you around  
I want you around  
  
I want you around  
I want you around
