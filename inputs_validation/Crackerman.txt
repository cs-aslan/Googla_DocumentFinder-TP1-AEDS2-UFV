Kickin as Im Trying to sleep Got the mud beneath my shoes  
Rubber band rubberband Gun in hand gun in hand I wanna use  
Roamin roamin roam Get away gotta get away  
And I think I think too much I dont care yeah but I dont care  
Roamin roamin roam Get away gotta get away  
And I think I think too much  
  
Trippin as Im thinkin about a boy his name was sue  
Hes a man hes a man crackerman crackerman hes a woman too  
Roamin roamin roam Get away gotta get away  
And I think I think too much I dont care yeah but I dont care  
Roamin roamin roam Get away gotta get away  
And I think I think too much  
  
And Im thinkin While Im thinking

Roamin roamin roam Get away gotta get away  
And I think I think too much I dont care yeah but I dont care  
Roamin roamin roam Get away gotta get away  
And I think I think too much
