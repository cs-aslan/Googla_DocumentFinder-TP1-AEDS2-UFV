When I was a young buck  
I tried to be liked by  
Everyone  
Everyone  
I tried so hard to be funny and nice  
I tried so hard to be sugar and spice  
Didnt work for me  
Got old quickly  
But now Im not losing sleep at night  
No ones calling me on the telephone  
To see if Im at home  
Cause now Ive got everything that I have ever wanted or so it seems  
Yeah so it seems yeah  
  
You dont  
Have to  
Like me  
Anymore  
Ive got money now  
I dont care  
What you say  
About me  
Anymore  
Ive got money now  
  
When I got a little older  
I realized  
Its all lies  
There is no prize  
There is no prize  
There is no heartache if you can afford  
Everything delivered right to your door  
Responsibilities  
This life is easy  
So now girl with everything  
How could she complain  
Cause shes got it made  
Yeah shes got it made  
I dont need to be tucked in at night  
Told that everything is gonna be alright  
Is gonna be alright  
Cause I dont have to fight  
  
You dont  
Have to  
Like me  
Anymore  
Ive got money now  
I dont care  
What you say  
About me  
Anymore  
Ive got money now  
  
I wouldnt trade a dollar for some sense  
I wouldnt trade a lifetime for some friends  
Ive got everything  
And all is what it seems  
I worked so hard all of my life  
Just to have things I could call mine  
I dont need no love  
Cause I have got enough  
So now I dont mind being alone all the time  
Its alright  
Ive got money now  
Thats what its all about  
And Im so busy buying things and traveling the world  
I dont have time for friends  
Or family  
And thats fine with me  
So it seems  
  
You dont  
Have to  
Like me  
Anymore  
Ive got money now  
I dont care  
What you say  
About me  
Anymore  
Ive got money now  
  
You dont  
Have to  
Like me  
Anymore  
Ive got money now  
I dont care  
What you say  
About me  
Anymore  
Cause Ive got money now
