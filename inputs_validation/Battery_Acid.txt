Make you into dark  
Straight into your heart  
Sorry all you are  
I dont really care  
Well I know you are  
  
Robots robots  
Brainwashed babies blood from a leech  
Spoken rabies  
Spastic plastic battery acid  
Yank on the leash  
Draggin you backwards  
Oh my closed eyes  
Never see it comin  
  
Theres nothing you can say  
You cant wish me away  
Every masochist gets a turn  
The sadistic twist youll never learn  
Battery acid battery acid  
  
Battery acid in my veins  
Unidentified remains  
Yes button broke to automatic  
Irrational dosage of furious static erasing what you are  
You were  
  
Jealous  
To feel the way you do  
To mention  
A lie then call it true  
Feel for  
Nothing except for yourself and nobody else  
Hanging over the edge  
  
Theres nothing you can say  
You cant wish me away  
Every masochist gets a turn  
The sadistic twist youll never learn  
In battery acid battery acid hey
