You say that you miss him  
I can tell by the way you kiss him  
Get yourself together  
And youll be alright  
You say that you love him  
Now hes gone so please forget him  
Get yourself together  
And youll be alright  
Im just like you so take my lead  
You see me as a friend but  
Im a friend in need  
  
Get yourself together  
And youll be alright  
  
So if you feel that you need me  
Im here beside you  
Cant you see me  
Get yourself together  
And youll be alright  
  
Get yourself together  
Youre gonna be alright
