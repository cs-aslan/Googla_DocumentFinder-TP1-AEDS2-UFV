Intro  
All my friends are heathens take it slow  
Wait for them to ask you who you know  
Please dont make any sudden moves  
You dont know the half of the abuse  
All my friends are heathens take it slow  
Wait for them to ask you who you know  
Please dont make any sudden moves  
You dont know the half of the abuse  
  
Verse 1  
Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people  
That they loved one day docked away  
Just because we check the guns at the door  
Doesnt mean our brains will change from hand grenades  
  
PreChorus  
Youre loving know the psychopath sitting next to you  
Youre loving know the murderer sitting next to you  
Youll think Howd I get here sitting next to you  
But after all Ive said please dont forget  
  
Chorus  
All my friends are heathens take it slow  
Wait for them to ask you who you know  
Please dont make any sudden moves  
You dont know the half of the abuse  
  
Verse 2  
We dont deal with outsiders very well  
They say newcomers have a certain smell  
You have trust issues not to mention  
They say they can smell your intentions  
  
PreChorus  
Youre loving know the freakshow sitting next to you  
Youll have some weird people sitting next to you  
Youll think How did I get here sitting next to you  
But after all Ive said please dont forget  
watch it  
Watch it  
  
Chorus  
All my friends are heathens take it slow  
Wait for them to ask you who you know

You dont know the half of the abuse  
  
Bridge  
All my friends are heathens take it slow watch it  
Wait for them to ask you who you know watch it  
Please all my friends are heathens take it slow watch it  
Wait for them to ask you who you know  
  
Outro  
Whyd you come You knew you should have stayed its blasphemy  
I tried to warn you just to stay away
