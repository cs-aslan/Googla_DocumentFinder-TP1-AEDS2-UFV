I was alright for a while  
I could smile for a while  
But when I saw you last night  
You held my hand so tight  
As you stopped to say hello  
Oh you wished me well  
And you couldnt tell  
That id been  
  
Crying over you  
Crying over you  
  
When you said so long  
You left me standing all alone  
Alone and crying  
  
Crying  
Crying  
Im crying  
Its hard to understand  
That the touch of your hand  
Could start me crying  
  
I thought that I was over you  
But its true oh so true  
I love you even more  
Than I did before  
But darling what can I do  
cause you dont love me  
And Ill always be  
  
Crying over you  
Crying over you  
  
And now that youre gone  
And from this moment on  
Ill be crying  
Crying  
Crying  
Crying  
Im crying  
Im crying  
Over you
