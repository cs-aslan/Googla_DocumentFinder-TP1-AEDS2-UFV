Verse 1 Fabolous  
Im on the streets like a gangstas supposed to  
Two way and cell on my hip I throw my heats on my ankle roaster  
Ride low on my seat blowin Dinkin Roasters  
When Im blowin my heaters point blank and closer  
Face show on the streets and it aint from posters  
Sells get low on my heat I got anxious soldiers  
Talkin like you bullet proof  
Well find where you move  
Put slugs in ya back to close to ya spine to remove  
Im waitin for the first one to front  
So I can put they family and friends in a limo and the hearse in the front  
As much as I take on the first of the month  
I wouldnt give a fuck about a 5 Mics or a Verse Of The Month  
I see ya with the jake too often  
Ill leave you in Miami with a hole in ya head gettin mistaked for dolphins  
Ice Jacob can custom make ya coffin  
Its Ghetto FABOLO  
YouS hello  
  
Talking  
Hes a monster  
This is the Godzilla of rap
