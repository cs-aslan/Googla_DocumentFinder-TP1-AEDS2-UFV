Look out the gangsters back  
I done traded in my old horse for a brand new Cadillac  
Im gonna play some blues  
Cause I know you like that  
Gonna get real loose  
And do the jumpback jack  
When I walk into a bar  
Girls from near and far  
Say Im the gangster  
Listen while a play for you  
A crazy little thing called guitar blue  
Red black yellow or white  
It dont matter mamas  
Youre all outta sight  
Dont get too heavy  
Now dont get uptight  
Cause the gangsters here to turn on your light  
Youre my horse and you never win a race  
And I dig you mama and your real crazy legs  
When I walk into a bar  
Girls from near and far  
Say Im the gangster  
Do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do  
Go gangster do do do do do  
Go gangster do do do do  
Go gangster do do do do do  
Go gangster do do do do  
Im a gangster  
Started long time ago  
Down in Texas where the guitars grow  
Folks down there got all shook up  
When I cut myself loose and did my stuff  
Now its ready set  
Ready set go  
Time for the gangster to start the show  
Well Im lookin for women  
Im on the road again  
You know the gangster dont lose  
He always win  
When I walk into a bar  
Girls from near and far  
Say Im the gangster  
You better look out the gangsters back
