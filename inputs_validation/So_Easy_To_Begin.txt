Well Ive been so far away from you  
Though standin by your side  
And there were nights we were so in love  
That lovin made me blind  
But that time is so far below us now  
The memory so thin  
Its so easy to begin  
But its so hard to stop this love  
Its just so hard to stop  
When a heart thats lookin for lovin leads you in  
Its so easy to begin  
And Ive at least saved some lessons from  
A time I fell apart  
And I know youve been wondering why  
I look at you so hard  
But I never want to wake up someday  
And wonder where weve been  
Its so easy to begin  
But its so hard to stop this love  
Its just so hard to stop  
When a heart thats lookin for lovin leads you in  
Its so easy to begin
