Turn the cards slowly while youre dealin darlin  
Please dont doubledeal to win my heart  
Turn the cards slowly while youre dealin darlin  
Dont go breakin rules right from the start  
The ramblin gamblin reckless way you treat my hearts a sin  
Each night down on my knees I pray your gamblin ways will end  
Turn the cards slowly while youre dealin darlin  
And if you stack the deck then Ill move on  
Turn the cards slowly while youre dealin darlin  
Please dont doubledeal to win my heart  
Turn the cards slowly while youre dealin darlin  
Dont go breakin rules right from the start  
The ramblin gamblin reckless way you treat my hearts a sin  
Each night down on my knees I pray your gamblin ways will end  
Turn the cards slowly while youre dealin darlin  
And if you stack the deck then Ill move on  
Turn the cards slowly while youre dealin darlin  
And if you stack the deck then Ill move on
