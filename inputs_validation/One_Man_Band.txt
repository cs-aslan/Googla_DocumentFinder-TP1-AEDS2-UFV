When Im talkin nothings getting through  
If Im sreaming its never clear to you  
Can you hear me am I wasting my time  
Am I working in a one man band  
When Im lookin straight into your eyes  
Is there anyone home Youre tellin me lies  
Listen to me are you wasting my time  
Its lonely in a one man band  
Lonely in a one man band  
Words out of line dont ever hurt you  
Forever crying trying to turn you around  
Woh oh oh oh  
Woh oh oh oh  
Woh oh oh oh  
Woh oh oh oh  
One man band  
Anticipating what youre gonna do  
Still waiting for a sign from you  
Come together are we wasting our time  
And Ill always be a one man band  
Ill always be a one man band  
Its lonely in a one man band  
Woh oh oh oh  
Woh oh oh oh  
Woh oh oh oh  
Woh oh oh oh
