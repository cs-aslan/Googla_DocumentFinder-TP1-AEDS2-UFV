Like father like son  
Not flesh nor fish nor bone  
A red rag hangs from an open mouth  
Alive at both ends but a little dead in the middle  
Atumbling and abumbling he will go  
All the kings horses and all the kings men  
Could never put a smile on that face  
  
Hes a sly one hes a shy one  
Wouldnt you be too  
Scared to be left all on his own  
Hasnt a hasnt a friend to play with the ugly duckling  
The pressure on the bubble will burst before our eyes  
All the while in perfect time  
His tears are falling on the ground  
But if you dont stand up you dont stand a chance  
  
Go a little faster now you might get there in time  
  
Mirror mirror on the wall  
His heart was broken long before he ever came to you  
Stop your tears from falling  
The trail they leave is very clear for all to see at night  
All to see at night  
  
In season out of season  
Whats the difference when you dont know the reason  
In one hand bread the other a stone  
The hunter enters the forest  
All are not huntsmen who can blow the huntsmans horn  
By the look of this one youve not got much to fear  
  
Here I am Im very fierce and frightening  
Come to match my skill to yours  
Now listen here listen to me dont you run away now  
I am a friend Id really like to play with you  
Making noises my little furry friend would make  
Ill trick him then Ill kick him into my sack  
You better watch out you better watch out  
  
Ive got you Ive got you youll never get away  
  
Walking home that night  
The sack across my back the sound of sobbing on my shoulder  
When suddenly it stopped  
I opened up the sack all that I had  
A pool of bubbles and tears  just a pool of tears  
  
All in all you are a very dying race  
Placing trust upon a cruel world  
You never had the things you thought you should have had  
And youll not get them now  
And all the while in perfect time  
Your tears are falling on the ground
