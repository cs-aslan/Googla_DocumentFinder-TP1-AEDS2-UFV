Hey darlin darlin gonna say it true  
No one understands me like you do  
I got the story when I was a child  
I took me over and turned me wild  
Only to make it true  
  
But when Im alone all alone  
No one home the TV and the phone  
Still say it will rain today  
Okay  
  
Hey darlin darlin help me to understand  
What went wrong with the peaceful plan  
Was it bold  
  
I aint wishing for what used to be  
I only hope that you and me  
Can keep hold unsold  
  
When you got no history youre free  
You sing and you believe so strong  
You hold out fast and long so long  
  
Now the latest is the greatest is their plan  
But they didnt make us and they cant break us  
Darlin darlin I dont think they can  
Darlin darlin I dont think they can  
  
Hey darlin darlin hows it gonna be  
I love to hear what you sing to me
