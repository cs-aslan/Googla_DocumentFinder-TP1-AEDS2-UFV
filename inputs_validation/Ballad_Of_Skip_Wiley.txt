Jimmy Buffett Russ Kunkel Jay Oliver Roger Guth and Peter Mayer  
HES A MAN ON A MISSION  
WILD AS A RICOCHET  
PICTURE IF YOU CAN  
WHEN THE EVERGLADES RAN  
FROM THE GULF COAST TO BISCAYNE BAY  
  
HES GONNA GIVE IT BACK TO THE GATORS  
LOCK THE TOURISTS UP IN THEME PARKS AND ZOOS  
HE SAYS JOIN ME FOR LUNCH AT THE REPTILES BRUNCH  
WHERE THE BAROMETER SOUP IS YOU  
  
HES CRAZY AND DANGEROUS  
BUT WHO ELSE CAN YOU TRUST  
HES THE OUTLAW IN ALL OF US  
THE ENVIRONMENTAL TERRORIST  
  
Chorus  
YOU CAN MESS WITH THE MOUSE IN ORLANDO  
JILT A TOURIST IN ST AUGUSTINE  
YOU CAN SHOPLIFT ALL DAY AT BLOCKBUSTER  
BUT YOU CANT STEAL THE ORANGE BOWL QUEEN  
NO YOU CANT STEAL THE ORANGE BOWL QUEEN  
  
Verse  
THERE WERE CRIMES OF EPIC PROPORTIONS  
ALL PART OF SKIP WILEYS CRUSADE  
TOURISTS WERE CACKIN AND TOURISTS WERE PACKIN  
WHILE HE AND SKINK COOLED THEIR HEELS IN THE SHADE  
  
THEN CAME THE CITRUS SENSATION  
WELCOME TO THE REVOLUTION HE SAID  
WITH A PIRATES PERSONA HE SNATCHED THE GRIDIRON MADONNA  
AND THE BIG MOVERS CALLED FOR HIS HEAD  
  
HES CRAZY AND DANGEROUS  
BUT WHO ELSE CAN YOU TRUST  
HES THE OUTLAW IN ALL OF US  
THE ENVIRONMENTAL TERRORIST  
  
Chorus  
YOU CAN MESS WITH THE MOUSE IN ORLANDO  
JILT A TOURIST IN ST AUGUSTINE  
YOU CAN RAG ON THE MIAMI DOLPHINS  
BUT YOU CANT STEAL THE ORANGE BOWL QUEEN  
NO YOU CANT STEAL THE ORANGE BOWL QUEEN  
NO YOU CANT STEAL THE ORANGE BOWL QUEEN  
  
WILL SKIPS CAPER IT KIND OF BACKFIRED  
AND GOT THE ORANGE JUICE BARONS RATHER UPSET  
IN THE LIGHT OF BAD MOODS THESE MANHUNTS ENSUED  
BUT SKIP EASILY SLIPPED THROUGH THE NET  
  
HE WAS LAST SEEN A TOP OF A MANGROVE  
PERCHED LIKE A WOUNDED OSPREY  
HE WAS NOT MEANT TO LAST HE BELONGS TO THE PAST  
AND I HOPE HE GETS THERE ONE DAY  
  
HES CRAZY AND DANGEROUS  
BUT WHO ELSE CAN YOU TRUST  
HES THE OUTLAW IN ALL OF US  
THE ENVIRONMENTAL TERRORIST  
  
Chorus  
YOU CAN MESS WITH THE MOUSE IN ORLANDO  
JILT A TOURIST IN ST AUGUSTINE  
YOU CAN SHOPLIFT YOUR DAYS AT BLOCKBUSTER  
BUT YOU CANT STEAL THE ORANGE BOWL QUEEN  
NO YOU CANT STEAL THE ORANGE BOWL QUEEN  
NO YOU CANT STEAL THE ORANGE BOWL QUEEN
