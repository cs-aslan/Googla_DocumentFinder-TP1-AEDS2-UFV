Swingin doors  
Neon lights  
Hardwood floors  
Its Saturday night  
Got on my dancing boots  
Ive got a cold Lonestar  
Ive got a two steppin mind  
And a honky tonk heart  
  
Ive got a two steppin mind And a honky tonk heart  
I need a fivepiece band with a fiddle and steel guitar  
Someone to hold when the music starts  
Ive got a two steppin mind and a honky tonk heart  
  
Its happy hour when I get there  
Pretty girls man theyre everywhere  
There aint no way to keep us apart  
Ive got a two steppin mind and a honky tonk heart  
  
Ive got a two steppin mind and a honky tonk heart  
I need a fivepiece band with a fiddle and steel guitar  
Someone to hold when the music starts  
Ive got a two steppin mind and a honky tonk heart  
  
Ive got a two steppin mind and a honky tonk heart  
I need a fivepiece band with a fiddle and steel guitar  
Someone to hold when the music starts  
Ive got a two steppin mind and a honky tonk heart  
Hey Ive got a two steppin mind and a honky tonk heart
