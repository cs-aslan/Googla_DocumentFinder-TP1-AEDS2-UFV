Shes been waiting in the cold  
Waiting for her moment  
Killing time  
Sitting in the ballroom  
Hoping he will notice  
  
Heavenly  
She put a spell on me  
Heavenly  
Wheres she gone  
Amelia  
  
Shes been caught up in the twilight  
Always on the outside  
Slowly drowning in the water  
Drowning from the tears  
Those green eyes  
Shes a pretty flower  
Waiting in wind  
  
Heavenly  
She put a spell on me  
Heavenly  
Wheres she gone  
  
So dont disappear  
Shine  
So dont disappear  
Shine  
Dont know how sometimes  
Dont know shine shine  
See your Amelia  
Theres nothing to fear  
Dont disappear  
Shine  
See your Amelia  
Theres nothing to fear  
Dont disappear  
Shine  
Theres noting to fear  
Dont disappear  
Amelia  
Theres nothing to fear  
So dont disappear  
Shine x2
