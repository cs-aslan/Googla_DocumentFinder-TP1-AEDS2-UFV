Josie works the counter at the downtown five and dime  
Anything at all to help her pass the time  
Her mama keeps the baby and grandpa rambles on  
About the good times playing in his mind  
  
Its a hard life living when youre lonely  
Its a long night sleeping alone  
Its a hard time waiting for tomorrow  
Its a long long way home  
  
Josie spends the evening with the people in the pages  
Of the paperback she picked up in the store  
Or sometimes its the TV or shell try to write a letter  
But they dont come too often anymore  
  
Its a hard life living when youre lonely  
Its a long night sleeping alone  
Its a hard time waiting for tomorrow  
Its a long long way home  
  
And I stare at the gray walls before me  
And I see her face in the stone  
And I try to imagine our baby  
And I wish they would let me go home  
And I wish they would let me go home  
And I wish they would let me go home  
  
Its a hard life living when youre lonely  
And I wish they would let me go home  
Its a long night sleeping alone  
And I wish they would let me go home  
Its a hard time waiting for tomorrow  
And I wish they would let me go home  
Its a long long way home  
And I wish they would let me go home  
Its a long long way home  
And I wish they would let me go home  
Bring me and the other boys home  
And I wish they would let me go home  
Bring me and the other boys home  
And I wish they would let me go home  
Bring me and the other boys home
