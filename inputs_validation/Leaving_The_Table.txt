Im leaving the table  
Im out of the game  
I dont know the people  
In your picture frame  
If I ever loved you or no no  
Its a crying shame if I ever loved you  
If I knew your name  
You dont need a lawyer  
Im not making a claim  
You dont need to surrender  
Im not taking aim  
  
I dont need a lover no no  
The wretched beast is tame  
I dont need a lover  
So blow out the flame  
  
Theres nobody missing  
There is no reward  
Little by little  
Were cutting the cord  
Were spending the treasure oh no no  
That love cannot afford  
I know you can feel it  
The sweetness restored  
  
I dont need a reason  
For what I became  
Ive got these excuses  
Theyre tired and lame  
I dont need a pardon no no no no no  
Theres no one left to blame  
Im leaving the table  
Im out of the game  
  
Im leaving the table  
Im out of the game
