Emily  
  
Were all alone on the stage tonight  
Weve been told were not afraid of you  
We know all our lines so well uhhuh  
Weve said them so many times  
Time and time again  
Line and line again  
  
Ooh yeah youre amazing  
We think youre incredible  
You say were fantastic  
But still we dont head the bill  
  
Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Unbelievable  
Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Unbelievable  
  
When the actor reaches his death  
You know its not for real He just holds his breath  
But he always dives too soon too fast to save himself  
  
Hell never make the screen  
Hell never make the Sweeney  
Be that movie queen  
Hes too busy hitting the Vaseline  
  
Ooh yeah youre amazing  
We think you are really cool  
Wed give you a part my love  
But youd have to play the fool  
  
Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Unbelievable  
Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Unbelievable  
  
Were all alone on the stage tonight  
Were all alone  
On the stage  
Tonight
