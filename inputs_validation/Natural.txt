Everything around is natural dont fight it  
Dont disagree with this and that no  
Astrology evolution thisandthatity  
This religion and that no  
  
Chorus  
And if they were not meant to be  
Well dont you think they wouldnt be  
And if they were not meant to be  
Well dont you think they wouldnt be oh  
  
Your beliefs philosophy dont give us peace  
Destruction of our enemy does it make us right  
And if you took them apart and destroyed them all now one by one  
This still wont make it work no  
  
Everything we like and dont like is whole and natural  
I know is doesnt feel like it and the world seems wrong  
But if we dont like it now then who can we blame  
Blame god be still find harmony
