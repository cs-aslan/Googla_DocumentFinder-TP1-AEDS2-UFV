Im just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And Im waiting for my rocket to come  
Im just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And Im waiting for my rocket  
  
You see it started way back in NYC  
When I stole my first rhyme from the MIC  
At a west end avenue at 63  
The beginning of a leap year February 96  
With a guitar picked up in the mix  
I committed to the licks like a nickel back of tricks  
Well look at me now  
Look at me now  
Look at me now now now now  
  
Im just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And Im waiting for my rocket to come  
Im just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And Im waiting for my rocket  
  
Well youre never gonna guess  
Where Ive been been been  
And I have no regrets  
That I bet my whole checking account  
Because it all amounts to nothing up in the end  
  
Well you can only count on the road again  
Well soon be on the radio dial  
And I been payin close attention to the Willie Nelson style  
Like a band of gypsies on the highway while  
Im one man pushin on the California skyline drive  
Up the coast mc brag the most  
Im pickin up my pace and makin time like space ghost  
  
Raising a toast to the highway patrol with the most  
Put my cruise control on coast  
cause Im tourin around the nation on extended vacation see  
I got Elsa the dog who exceeds my limitation  
I say I like your style crazy pound pup  
You need a ride  
Well come on girl hop in the truck  
  
Im just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And Im waiting for my rocket to come  
Im just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And Im waiting for my rocket  
Im just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And Im waiting for my rocket to come on  
Im just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And Im waiting for my rocket  
  
See Im a down home brother redneck undercover  
With my guitar here  
Im ready to play  
And Im s a sucker for a filly  
Got a natural ability to give the freestyle  
Look at my flexibility  
Dangerous at the mike  
My ghetto hats cocked right  
The ladies say yo that kid is crazy  
The backstage betties taking more than they can get  
They say whats up with mareaz  
  
Hey hey somethings different in my world today  
Well they changed my traffic sign to a brighter yellow  
Hey hey somethings different in my world today  
They changed my traffic sign to a brighter yellow  
Im just a curbside prophet  
  
Curbside prophet now  
Curbside prophet now  
Curbside  
Come on now  
Curbside prophet  
Waiting for my rocket to come
