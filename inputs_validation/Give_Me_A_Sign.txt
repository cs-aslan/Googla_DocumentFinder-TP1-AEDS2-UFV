Its such a heavenly sight  
Stars are shining just right  
And if your heart is thumping just like mine  
Give me a look give me a word give me a sign  
I yearn for one little kiss  
Cant continue like this  
I get a crazy feeling down my spine  
Give me a look give me a word give me a sign  
What can I say what can I do  
I love to go around with you  
But dear its much too much  
When romancing I find that were going Dutch  
I feel suspended in air  
You suspended me there  
So darling please have pity say youre mine  
Give me a look give me a word give me a sign  
Such a heavenly sight  
Stars are shining just right  
And if your heart is thumping just like mine  
Give me a look give me a word give me a sign  
I yearn for one little kiss  
Cant continue like this  
I get a crazy feeling down my spine  
Give me a look give me a word give me a sign  
What can I say what can I do  
I love to go around with you  
But dear its much too much  
When romancing I find that were going Dutch  
I feel suspended in air  
You suspended me there  
So darling please have pity say youre mine  
Give me a look give me a word give me a sign  
Both Give me a kiss give me a cue give me a hug  
Both Give me a clue give me a look give me a word give me a sign
