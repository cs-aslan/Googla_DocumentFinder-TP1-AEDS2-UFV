Stolen from an Africa land  
Chased out with a knife  
With a face like Bob Marley and a mouth like a motor bike  
Oh well the bars are always open and the time is always right  
And if Gods good word goes unspoken the music goes all night  
And it goes  
  
If I was Bob Marley I said could you be loved  
If I was Half Pint Id ball the lord up above  
If I was Mike Tyson Id look for a fight  
If I was a Boomtown Rats I would be stayin up all night  
If I was the King AdRock I would get stupid dumb  
If rhymes were Valiums Id be comfortably numb  
  
If I had a shotgun you know what Id do  
Id point that shit straight at the sky  
And shoot heaven on down for you  
Because the bars are always open and the time is always right  
And if Gods good word goes unspoken the music goes all night  
And it goes  
  
I want a lover I cant find the time  
I want a reason I cant find the rhyme  
And I want to start some static but I cant afford  
Just lay on the ground like I fell off my skateboard  
Now a days as clear as you please strap with protection or strap with
disease  
Laughter its free any time just call me  
4390116 when your down with Sublime you get  
Funky fresh lyrics you get nothin  
  
Stolen from an Africa land  
Got chased out of the bar  
I saw my best friend tonight so dont push me too far  
  
Im gonna run come down with the new lyrics  
Get hit get hip dont slip you knuckle heads  
Racism is schism on a serious tip  
You dont believe me that I wont bust your lip  
I hear the mountain it hard to climb  
Ruffle the rhythm and it must be Sublime  
Listen yellow lover yeah it right on time  
We got cricket with the quickness and the bass line  
  
Go and raid the sound and tell the people the news oh hey  
Tell them reggae music is on the loose  
Here I am from the place where the sun keeps shine new style in a unique
fashion  
And good good vibes that keep on playin playin  
  
People want to come up and they want to tell me smokin crack cocaine better
than sensi  
Youre pumpin that shit yo were sick of it  
Teakin every weekend and we just cant take it  
We dont want plastic
