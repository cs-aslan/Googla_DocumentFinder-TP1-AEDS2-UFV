This song is sung for anyone thats listening  
This song is for the brokenspirited man  
This song is for anyone left standing  
After the strain of a slow sad end  
  
It seems everybody wants what someone else has  
Theres sorrow enough for all  
Just go in any bar and ask  
With a beer in each hand and a smile in between  
All arounds a world grown mean  
  
Weve all had our ups and downs  
Its been mostly down around here  
Now this whole damn mess is becoming quite clear  
  
Looks like were all looking for a life worth livin  
Thats why we drink ourselves to sleep  
Yeah were all looking for a life worth livin  
Thats why we pray for our souls to keep  
  
Theres nothing left now but broken pieces  
Of one mans broken will to care  
And in the end before all is said and done  
How many others might follow him there  
  
This song is sung for anyone thats listening  
This song is for the brokenspirited man  
This song is for anyone left standing  
After the strain of a slow sad end  
  
Midnight is comin round  
Still mostly down around here  
Now this whole damn mess is becoming quite clear
