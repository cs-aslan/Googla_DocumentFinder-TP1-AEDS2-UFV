Come come come into my world  
Wont you lift me up up high upon your love  
  
Take these arms that were made for lovin  
And this heart that will beat for two  
Take these eyes that were meant for watching over you  
And Ive been such a long yime waiting  
For someone I can call my own  
Ive been chasing the life Im dreaming  
Now Im home  
  
I need your love  
Like night needs morning  
  
Come come come into my world  
Wont you lift me up up high upon your love  
  
Na na na na  
  
Take these lips that were made for kissing  
And this heart that will see you through  
And these hands that were made to touch and  
feel you  
  
So free your love  
Hear me Im calling  
  
Oh wont you  
Come come come into my world  
Wont you lift me up up high upon your love  
  
I need your love  
Like night needs morning  
  
Oh wont you  
Come come come into my world  
Wont you lift me up up high upon your love
