Always you will be part of me  
And I will forever feel your strength  
When I need it most  
Youre gone now gone but not forgotten  
I cant say this to your face  
But I know you hear  
  
Ill see you again  
You never really left  
I feel you walk beside me  
I know Ill see you again  
  
When Im lost Im missing you like crazy  
And I tell myself Im so blessed  
To have had you in my life my life  
  
Ill see you again  
You never really left  
I feel you walk beside me  
I know Ill see you again  
  
When I had the time to tell you  
I never thought Id live to see the day  
When the words I should have said  
Would come to haunt me  
In my darkest hour I tell myself  
Ill see you again  
  
Ill see you again  
You never really left  
I feel you walk beside me  
I know Ill see you again  
  
Ill see you again  
You never really left  
I feel you walk beside me  
I know Ill see you again  
  
I will see you again  
Ill see you again  
I miss you like crazy  
Youre gone but not forgotten  
Ill never forget you  
Someday Ill see you again  
I feel you walk beside me  
Never leave you yeah  
Gone but not forgotten  
I feel you by my side  
No this is not goodbye
