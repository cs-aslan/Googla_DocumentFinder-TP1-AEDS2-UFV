Ever homeward ever homeward yearns the weary rover  
Ever homeward ever homeward till the journeys over  
Warm embraces and friendly faces saying welcome home  
Let me lie there neath the sky there never more to roam  
Ever homeward ever homeward yearns the weary rover  
Ever homeward over homeward now the journeys over  
Ever homeward ever homeward yearns the weary rover  
Ever homeward over homeward now the journeys over
