Any way the wind may blow  
Any way the creek may flow  
Any way the crow may fly  
Within the confines of the sky  
I will prove my love to you  
In everything I say and in all I do  
Anywhere the song is king  
Anywhere the robin sings  
Anywhere the lake is cold  
Anywhere the bell is tolled  
I will prove my love to you  
In everything I say and in all I do  
Anytime our paths dont cross  
And the losin dice are tossed  
Anytime you know whats best  
Anytime I cant care less  
Ill make it up to you  
In everything I say and in all I do  
Any way the wind may blow  
Any way I stub my toe  
Any way the tree might bend  
Any way the day might end  
I will prove my love to you  
In everything I say and in all I do  
I will make it up to you  
In everything I say and in all I do
