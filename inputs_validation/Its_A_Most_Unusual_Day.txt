Its a most unusual day  
Feel like throwing my worries away  
As an old nativeborn Californian would say  
Its a most unusual day  
Theres a most unusual sky  
Not a sign of a cloud passing by  
And if I want to sing throw my heart in the ring  
Its a most unusual day  
There are people meeting people  
There is sunshine everywhere  
There are people greeting people  
And a feeling of Spring in the air  
Its a most unusual time  
I keep feeling my temperature climb  
If my heart wont behave in the usual way  
Well theres only one thing to say  
Its a most unusual day  
There are people meeting people  
There is sunshine everywhere  
There are people greeting people  
And a feeling of Spring in the air  
I keep feeling my temperature climb climb climb climb climb climb climb  
Till there is only one thing to say  
Its a most most most most most unusual most unusual  
Most unusual daayay  
Most unusual daay
