Ive loved you all my life in all my dreams  
So why am I surprised here with me  
Thats how it should be  
But you look in my eyes turn away  
You can see inside Im afraid  
Afraid of feeling  
  
I dont know what to say  
I dont understand  
Its not the way I planned  
  
I cant stay I cant leave  
Im torn between two people I need  
One of them is you the other is me  
We come from different world different stars  
But when youre lying here in my arms  
All I wanna do is love the way you do  
All I wanna do is love the way you do  
  
How can I go on but nothings changed  
You and I both know the choice was made  
When I first touched you  
Now if I stay or leave its all the same  
Awake or in my dreams I see your face  
I will love you  
  
Im always in control now here I stand  
A heart is in my hand  
  
I cant stay I cant leave  
Im torn between two people I need  
One of them is you the other is me  
We come from different world different stars  
But when youre lying here in my arms  
All I wanna do is love the way you do  
All I wanna do is love the way you do
