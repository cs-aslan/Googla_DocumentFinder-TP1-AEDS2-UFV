I can tell you got plans for me  
And your eyes are saying you made them carefully  
But tonight I have to say there just might be another way  
Wont you spare me all the charms and take me in your arms  
I cant wait I cant wait  
  
Im the one you want thats all I want to be  
So come on baby make a move on me  
Got nowhere to go all my time is free  
So come on baby make a move on me tonight  
I cant wait I cant wait  
  
You made the prettiest speech Ive heard  
But a single touch surely is worth a thousand words  
To a heart thats open wide and from the start was on your side  
Wont you spare me all the charms and take me in your arms  
I cant wait I cant wait  
  
Im the one you want thats all I want to be  
So come on baby make a move on me  
Got nowhere to go all my time is free  
So come on baby make a move on me tonight  
I cant wait I cant wait  
  
Im the one you want thats all I want to be  
So come on baby make a move on me  
Got nowhere to go all my time is free  
So come on baby make a move on me tonight  
I cant wait I cant wait
