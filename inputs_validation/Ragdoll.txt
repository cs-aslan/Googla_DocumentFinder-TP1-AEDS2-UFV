Rag Doll  
How ya feelin  
The day has had its way with both of us  
And no Ive gone out of my way  
But Im not free  
From this pain Im reelin  
I was a fool to think some day you would come around  
But no no no Im not thinking that way  
Cause now I see  
  
You are not what you seem  
You are a mystery to me  
Sometimes I just wanna scream  
  
I think you should just go away cause  
Theres no necessity for you to stay and  
Next time you come around my way  
Forget it baby your not comin in  
  
Hows your day been  
Cause mine has taken strange and ugly turns  
But no no no I feel better today  
Cause Im off my knees  
  
You are not what you seem  
You are a mystery to me  
Sometimes I just wanna scream  
  
I think you should just go away cause  
Theres no necessity for you to stay and  
Next time you come around my way  
Forget it baby your not comin in  
  
A heart made for a lot of sorrow  
No you cant come back tomorrow  
Shut my windows lock my doors  
Cause my heart wont be your rag doll anymore  
Yeah  
  
I think you should just go away cause  
theres no necessity for you to stay and  
Next time you come around my way  
Forget it baby your not comin in  
  
A heart made for a lot of sorrow  
No you cant come back tomorrow  
Shut my windows lock my doors  
Cause my heart wont be your rag doll anymore  
Whoa
