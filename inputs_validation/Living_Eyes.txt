Would you believe me if I told you your tomorrow is my yesterday  
But be alive I know that we will  
The world keeps on moving but Im holding still  
  
In the beginning I was far away and praying for my destiny  
That would arrive the moment youre born  
For we will be here when the miracle comes  
  
Chorus  
Living eyes when under the sun dont cry  
No war in my mind  
The state of my heart  
Living eyes when out in the rain will fall  
The day I deny the face of my love  
  
Bridge  
We are of age we are in time we are forever  
Right now when the power is mine  
I leave you Heaven and the Earth I leave you never  
And living to love is the reason to shine  
  
I been over I been under I dont own a dream to analyze  
But living eyes you know that I do  
Believe in the soul and the magic of you  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus
