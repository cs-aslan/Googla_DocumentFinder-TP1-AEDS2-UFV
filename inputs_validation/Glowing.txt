You knocked me sideways  
When you said that you were leaving  
You knocked me over  
When you cried and told the truth  
And you left me speechless  
The secrets youve been keeping  
Youre running now but someones chasing you  
And you bought a ticket  
But you dont know where youre going  
And you wont tell me  
For fear Ill follow soon  
And youre tryin to save me  
From your past of bad decisions  
But my decisions always gonna be  
To follow you To follow you  
  
Never gonna stop til the clock stops tickin  
Never gonna quit til my leg starts kickin  
I will follow you and well both go missin Yeah  
No Im never givin up til my heart stops beatin  
Never lettin go til my arm stops breathing  
I will follow you and well both go missin Yeah  
No I And we dont even know where were going  
But Im fleeing with you and Im glowing Ooh  
  
I woke up this morning  
To a kiss just like a whisper  
And it takes to kiss  
When I knew that you were gone  
And you left the motel  
When youre headin off on nowhere  
But the lady on the door said  
You havent left that long long no  
  
No I And we dont even know where were going  
But Im fleeing with you and Im glowing Ooh  
  
I still watch as shes runnin away  
So she was born to live this way  
Bad mans gonna take her awaytake her away yeah  
I still watch as shes runnin away  
So she was born to live this way  
Ill never let a bad man take you awaytake you away  
So Ill  
  
And we dont even know where were going  
But Im fleeing with you and Im glowing Ooh  
And we dont own now with all we got  
We have everything we own in a cardboard box  
And we dont own now with all we got  
We got everything we own in a cardboard box  
And we dont own now with all we got  
We have everything we own in a cardboard box
