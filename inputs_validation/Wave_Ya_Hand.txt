Nicki Minaj  Chorus  
Wave Ya Hand if you look good  
Throw some shade if you look good  
Wave Ya Hand if you look good  
Anyway but you look good  
Wave Ya Hand if you look good  
Those them shade if you look good  
Wave Ya Hand if you look good  
Anyway but you look good  
  
Verse  
I tell them bitches anyway  
Cause we dont care what none of them galopies say  
You cant stop me Imma fulfil my prophecy  
I do it I did it the proper way  
I might popatay now watch how we operate  
Bottles on ice the bottles is on ice  
The vip light is hitting us just right  
So if you getting money just throw it up in the air  
Your hands in the air like I was your puppeteer  
Cause I I I Im am Zolanski  
Some call me Barbie yes Im life size  
Yes Im humble yes but why lie  
I am the reason why these girls go bye bye  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 2  
Ok now this right here can get me in trouble  
Cause when I say I ball I dont mean in a huddle  
Im always in a Lam never do nothing subtle  
Cause its Pink Friday hoe thats there rebuttal  
My 2 guns up lets blaze it lets go  
I keep a lot of money up in the Escrow  
And when Im at the game Im in the best row  
I am the baddest bitch up in the pet store  
Cause I I I am Onika  
And these shoes here me Fashionista  
Cause these dont come out til its Easter  
Im vip bound with Leighton Meester
