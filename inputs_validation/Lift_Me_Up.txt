When Im down on my luck and Im searching for my soul  
When Im feeling too much and I start to lose control  
When Im down so low that even enemies dont want to know  
You still care for me say a prayer for me and I know  
Ooo I like you hanging around  
Cause you lift me up when I am upside down  
Ooo you are my favourite sound  
Cause youre always down for  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when Im feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I dont want to let you go  
When Im lost along way and I cant face another day  
And if I stumble on the road and if I cant carry the load  
And if I lose my faith and kindness and generousity  
Would you hold my hand  
Say you understand my pain  
Ooo I like you hanging around  
Cause you lift me up when I am upside down  
Ooo you are my favourite sound  
Cause youre always down for  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when Im feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I dont want to let you go  
Its been a long hard road and its only just begun my friend  
And this I know you helped me carry the load  
Cause youre always down for  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when Im feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
Whell youre always around  
Youre my favourite sound  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when Im feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I dont want to let you go  
I dont want to let you go  
Cause you lift me up now  
Whell youre always around  
Youre my favourite sound  
Lift me up now  
You lift me up  
Lift me up now  
Yeah youre always around  
Youre my favourite sound  
Lift me up  
OhhYear
