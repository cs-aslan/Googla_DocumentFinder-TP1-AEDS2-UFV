Farewell heartless world  
Ill send you a postcard burnt in flames  
Youve tried so hard to extinguish with the fear of failing  
Ill write down everything I have learned  
And edit it down to a single word Love  
For you Im waiting anticipating  
  
Chorus  
Sparks will fly beneath the Luna alight  
Lazarus at Frankensteins  
Babe Ill be a flatliner for a heartkiller  
A little we die above the lesser light  
For you Im open wide  
Babe Ill be a flatliner for a heartkiller  
  
Heartkiller  
  
Top hats off to the return  
Of the beat to lick a wound  
Too cursed for some and blessed for a few  
It doesnt have to make any sense at all  
Come hither and well fall in love  
For love Im crawling out of patience baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Paint all your sorrows for me to sing hearkiller  
Draw your pain and hear me hum it out  
  
Chorus  
  
Heartkiller  
Heartkiller  
  
Babe Ill be a flatliner for a heartkiller  
Babe Ill be a flatliner for a heartkiller
