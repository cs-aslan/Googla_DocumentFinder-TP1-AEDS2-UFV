She was all that I could ask for  
I could see it in her eyes And her smile told me  
That I was on her mind And you should have seen the way  
That she looked at me across the room  
I could see her thinking man that boy is fine  
  
Chorus  
Do ya know shes tryin to fool ya  
I know what shes doin to ya She loves me more than you  
Ya ya know she wants me Do ya think Id lose her to ya  
But you dont get that do ya  
You know shes nothing to ya She wants me  
  
So what makes you think a girl like her could fall in love with you  
When a guy like me has everything she needs  
Well I dont believe you understand The power of my game  
You just got to know that girl is into me  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont care how much you say You think about my girl about my girl  
But Im telling you I know shes feeling me  
You just might wanna think twice  
About messin with my girl with my girl  
Shes my girl shes my girl And I know she want me  
  
Chorus  
  
She wants me She wants me And I know that she wants me  
  
Chorus
