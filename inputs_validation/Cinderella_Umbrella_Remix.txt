Uhuh uhuh Good girl gone bad  
Uhuh uhuh Take three Action

No clouds in my storms  
Let it rain I hydroplane into fame Eh eh  
Comen down with the Dow Jones  
When the clouds come we gone

And she rocks it better  
You know me  
An anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day Eh eh  
Jay rain man is back with lil Ms Sunshine

Verse  
You have my heart and well never be a world apart  
Maybe in magazines but youll still be my star  
Baby cause in the Dark You cant see a shiny Car  
And thats when you need me there  
With you Ill always share  
Because  
  
Chorus  
When the sun shines  
Well shine together  
Told you Ill be here forever

Took an oath Imma stick it out till the end  
Now that its raining more than ever

A fairytale fantasy  
Nothing can ever compare  
An image to my memory  
And girl Im asking could you be my queen  
A vision on a magazine

Its something we both share  
Because  
When the sun shine well shine together  
You know Ill be here forever  
Although its a not a rain outside  
Girl its gettin late and you can stay the night  
But you can dip out anytime whenever  
I can call a car I aint tryna stress ya
