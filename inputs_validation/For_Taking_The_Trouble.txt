For taking the trouble for hanging on and tryin  
Youve been working through the rubble of a shattered mind  
Yeah Baby tell me why the tears are falling from your eye  
Tears of laughter tears of grief are they the tears of a captured thief  
You thought that you were home free you thought you had her well in hand  
But there were things about her you didnt understand  
Yeah Baby tell me how youre gonna keep that promise now  
To live your life without regret and make it work with what you get  
You didnt then but now you know  
When she began to lie you really should have let her go  
Youre learnin how to talk about it youre learnin how to bend  
Its like youre learning how to walk all over again  
Yeah Baby tell me who youre gonna give your lovin to  
That girl who catches every eye or the one you can set your compass by  
You set it by her soulful smile the fire in her eye  
And the way she goes that extra mile  
The love you wanted this to be is somewhere down the line  
Youll find her eventually  
Your grandma and her grandma are sittin round heaven discussin the law  
Lovin that girl was not your crime livin without her gonna take some time  
Lovin that girl next thing you knew youd turned away from the thing you do  
Lovin that girl you couldnt see living without her gonna make you free
