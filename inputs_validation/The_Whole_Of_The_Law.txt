Well I used to have the notion I could swim the length of the ocean  
If I knew that you were waiting for me  
I used to have the notion I could swim the length of the ocean  
Id plumb the depths of every sea for you  
Id escape from my chains and Ill reach out for you  
  
Maybe Im in love with you  
Maybe maybe Im in love with you  
I had to contact you found out I was in love with you  
I had to contact  
  
Thats it thats the law thats the whole of the law  
The whole of the law
