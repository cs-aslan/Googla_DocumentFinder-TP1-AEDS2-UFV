Im waiting this mornin  
Im waiting for my baby to come back home  
Im waiting this mornin  
Im waiting for my baby to come back home  
You know she left me this mornin  
And I dont know where she gone  
  
She said she wasnt gonna leave me  
She said she always gonna stay by my side  
She said she wasnt gonna leave me  
She said she always gonna stay by my side  
This time she mistreated me  
And I dont know how many times she lied  
  
Well I love my baby  
And Ill tell the world I do  
I love my baby  
Ill tell the world I do  
But now Ive lost my baby  
I dont know what in the world Im gonna doyeah
