I dont know why I love ya like I do  
I dont know why I just do  
Well I dont know why you thrill me like you do  
I dont know why you just do  
You never seem to want my romancing  
Ah the only time you hold me is when were dancing  
  
I dont know why I love ya like I do  
I dont know why I just do  
I dont know why I love you like I do  
I dont know why I just do  
I dont know why you thrill me like you do  
I dont know why you just do  
You never seem to want my romancing  
Ah the only time you hold me is when were dancing  
  
I dont know why I love you like I do  
I dont know why I just do  
I dont know why I love ya like I do  
I dont know why I just do  
I dont know why you thrill me like you do  
I dont know why but you do  
You never seem to want my romancing  
Ah the only time you hold me is when were dancing  
  
I dont know why I love ya like I do  
I dont know why I just do
