Whenever Im alone with you  
You make me feel like I am home again  
Whenever Im alone with you  
You make me feel like I am whole again  
  
Whenever Im alone with you  
You make me feel like I am young again  
Whenever Im alone with you  
You make me feel like I am fun again  
  
However far away I will always love you  
However long I stay I will always love you  
Whatever words I say I will always love you  
I will always love you  
  
Whenever Im alone with you  
You make me feel like I am free again  
Whenever Im alone with you  
You make me feel like I am clean again  
  
However far away I will always love you  
However long I stay I will always love you  
Whatever words I say I will always love you  
I will always love you  
  
However far away I will always love you  
However long I stay I will always love you  
Whatever words I say I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
Cause I love you
