Girl I surrender thats no lie  
You dont remember how I tried  
All I can dream all I say  
  
Dont make it better  
Walking around with a brick in my head  
Hanging around still trying to make it better  
Thinking by now that Im sick in the head  
Cause its everything that you dont want  
Give you everything but you dont care  
Girl I love you but you say you dont  
Hell its everything that you dont want  
  
Girl its a wonder I survived  
You are the hunger burning my insides  
Living your dream call my name  
  
Ill make it better  
Walking around with a brick in my head  
Hanging around still trying to make it better  
Thinking by now that Im sick in my head  
Cause its everything that you dont want  
Give you everything but you dont care  
Girl I love you but you say you dont  
Hell its everything that you dont want  
  
Wait a minute you got a noose around my heart  
Come on come on come on squeeze  
All that your breaking is my heart  
Your gonna freeze it baby youve gone so cold
