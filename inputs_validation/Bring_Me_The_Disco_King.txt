You promised me the ending would be clear  
Youd let me know when the time was now  
Dont let me know when youre opening the door  
Stab me in the dark let me disappear  
  
Memories that flutter like bats out of hell  
Stab you from the city spires  
Life wasnt worth the balance  
Or the crumpled paper it was written on  
  
Dont let me know were invisible  
Dont let me know were invisible  
  
Hot cash days that you trailed around  
Cold cold nights under chrome and glass  
Led me down river of perfumed limbs  
Sent me to the streets with the good time girls  
  
Dont let me know were invisible  
Dont let me know were invisible  
We could dance dance dance through the fire  
Dance dance dance through the fire  
  
Feed me no lies  
I dont know about you I dont know about you  
Breathe through the years  
I dont know about you I dont know about you  
Bring me the disco king  
I dont know about you I dont know about you  
Dead or alive bring me the disco king  
Bring me the disco king bring me the disco king  
Bring me the disco king  
  
Spinoffs with those who slept like corpses  
Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs  
Killing time in the 70s  
Smelling of love through the moist winds  
Dont let me know when youre opening the door  
Close me in the dark let me disappear  
Soon therell be nothing left of me  
Nothing left to release  
  
Dance dance dance through the fire  
Dance dance dance through the fire  
Feed me no lies  
I dont know about you I dont know about you  
Breathe through the years  
I dont know about you I dont know about you  
Bring me the disco king  
I dont know about you I dont know about you  
Dead or alive bring me the disco king  
Bring me the disco king  
Bring me the disco king bring me the disco king  
Bring me the disco king bring me the disco king  
Bring me the disco king bring me the disco king
