He was not or never had been in favor  
Of setting are people free  
If it wasnt for the thirteenth Amendment  
We woulda been born in slavery  
He was not or never had been in favor  
Of letting us vote so you see  
Abraham Lincoln was a racist who said  
You cannot escape from history  
  
Like the snow comin down the mountain  
That landed on Wounded Knee  
Nobody wants to take the weight  
The responsibility  
  
Hear the joyous sound of freedom  
The Harlem Renaissance  
Hear Duke Ellington and his band  
Kick another jungle jam  
Ooh do you wanna dance  
Whos that lurking in the shadows  
Mr John Hammond with his pen in hand  
Sayin Sign youre kingdom over to me  
And be known throughout the land  
But you aint got no money you aint got no cash  
So you sign yo name and he claims innocence  
Just like every snowflake in an avalanche  
  
Like the snow comin down the mountain  
That landed on Wounded Knee  
Nobody wants to take the weight  
The responsibility
