Theres a tramp sittin on my doorstep  
Tryin to waste his time  
With his methylated sandwich  
Hes a walking clothesline  
And here comes the bishops daughter  
On the other side  
She looks a trifle jealous  
Shes been an outcast all her life  
  
Me Im waiting so patiently  
Lying on the floor  
Im just trying to do my jigsaw puzzle  
Before it rains anymore  
  
Oh the gangster looks so frightning  
With his Luger in his hand  
When he gets home to his children  
Hes a family man  
But when it comes to the nittygritty  
He can shove in his knife  
Yes he really looks quite religious  
Hes been an outlaw all his life  
  
Me Im waiting so patiently  
Lying on the floor  
Im just trying to do this jigsaw puzzle  
Before it rains anymore  
  
Me Im waiting so patiently  
Lying on the floor  
Im just trying to do this jigsaw puzzle  
Before it rains anymore  
  
Oh the singer he looks angry  
At being thrown to the lions  
And the bass player he looks nervous  
About the girls outside  
And the drummer hes so shattered  
Trying to keep on time  
And the guitar players look damaged  
Theyve been outcasts all their lives  
  
Me Im waiting so patiently  
Lying on the floor  
Im just trying to do this jigsaw puzzle  
Before it rains anymore  
  
Oh theres twentythousand grandmas  
Wave their hankies in the air  
All burning up their pensions  
And shouting Its not fair  
Theres a regiment of soldiers  
Standing looking on  
And the queen is bravely shouting  
What the hell is going on  
  
With a bloodcurdling tallyho  
She charged into the ranks  
And blessed all those grandmas who  
With their dying breaths screamed Thanks  
  
Me Im just waiting so patiently  
With my woman on the floor  
Were just trying to do this jigsaw puzzle  
Before it rains anymore
