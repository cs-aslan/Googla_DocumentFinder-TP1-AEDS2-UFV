I thought she had to have it  
Since the first time she came  
Who knows the situation  
Mysteries do remain  
And now I wonder why  
I breakdown when I cry  
Is it something I said  
Or is it just a lie  
is it just a lie  
  
I try so hard to love you  
Some things take  
Time and shame  
I think the whole world  
Of you  
Your thoughts of me remain  
Ill play the fool for you  
Ill change the rules for you  
Just say it and Ill do  
Just make this thing come true  
make a dream come true  
  
If I let her get away  
Though Im begging  
On my knees  
Ill be crying everyday  
Knowing the girl  
That got away  
  
I cant let  
I cant let her get away  
I cant let  
I cant let her get away  
  
I cant let  
I cant let her get away  
I cant let  
I cant let her get away  
  
I tried to mastermind it  
By saying let it be  
But every time I did it  
The hurt came back at me  
I told you that I need you  
A thousand times and why  
I played the fool for you  
And still you said goodbye  
still you said goodbye  
  
If I let her get away  
Then the world will  
Have to see  
A fool who lives alone  
And the fool who  
Set you free  
  
I cant let  
I cant let her get away  
I cant let  
I cant let her get away  
  
I cant let  
I cant let her get away  
I cant let  
I cant let her get away  
Ive got the feelin  
  
Cant let go  
Cant let go  
  
I cant let  
I cant let her get away  
I cant let  
I cant let her get away  
  
I cant let  
I cant let her get away  
I cant let  
I cant let her get away
