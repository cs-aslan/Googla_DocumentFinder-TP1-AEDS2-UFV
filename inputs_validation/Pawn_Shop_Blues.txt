Well I didnt know it would come to this  
But thats what happens when youre on your own  
And youre alright letting nice things go  
  
Well I pawned the earrings that you gave me  
Gold and made of flowers dangling  
And I almost cried as I sold them all  
I dont mind living on bread and oranges no no  
But I gotta get to and from where I come  
And its gonna take money to go  
Oh no oh oh oh oh  
  
In the name of higher consciousness  
I let the best man I knew go  
Cause its nice to love and be loved  
But its better to know all you can know  
I said its nice to love and be loved  
But Id rather know what God knows  
Oh no oh no oh no  
  
I can do this once more  
No man can keep me together  
Been broken since I was born  
  
Well I didnt know it would come to this  
But thats what happens when youre on your own  
And youre alright letting nice things go
