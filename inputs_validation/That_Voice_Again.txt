I want to be with you  
I want to be clear  
But each time I try  
Its the voice I hear  
I hear that voice again  
  
Im listening to the conversation  
Judge and jury in my head  
Its coloring everything  
All we did and said  
And still I head that sharp tongue talking  
Talking tangled words  
I can sense the danger  
Just listen to the wind  
  
I want you close I want you near  
I cant help but listen  
But I dont want to hear  
Hear that voice again  
  
I want to be with you  
I want to be clear  
But each time I try  
Its the voice I hear  
I hear that voice again  
  
Im hearing right and wrong so clearly  
There must be more than this  
Its only in uncertainty  
That were naked and alive  
I hear it through the rattle of a streetcar  
Hear it through the things you said  
I can get so scared  
Listen to the wind  
  
I want you close I want you near  
I cant help but listen  
But I dont want to hear  
Hear that voice again  
  
What I carry in my heart  
Brings us so close or so far apart  
Only love can make love  
  
I want you close I want you near  
I cant help but listen  
But I dont want to hear  
I hear that voice again  
  
I want to be with you  
I want to be clear  
But each time I try  
Its the voice I hear  
I hear that voice again
