Im feeling so confused today  
It seems theyve changed the rules again  
cause in my life Im trying hard  
To do it all so I can remain  
Healthy and sane  
  
Ill live forever  
Always one more tomorrow  
Living forever  
Always one more tomorrow  
  
I heard it on the radio  
Too much of what they said wasnt so  
And now weve got to do those things  
That they brought before were so wrong  
To be healthy and strong  
  
And live forever  
Always one more tomorrow  
Living forever  
Always one more tomorrow  
  
I know we dont need you  
I know we dont believe you  
You dont really have the answer  
You think you know better  
You think it really matters  
You just want to rule over everybodys lives  
  
I think Ill change my life today  
Gone are the times of taking care  
And I dont need a reason why  
All I need is all in a day survive in a way  
  
Or just till tomorrow  
Always one more tomorrow  
Living forever  
Do you really want to live forever
