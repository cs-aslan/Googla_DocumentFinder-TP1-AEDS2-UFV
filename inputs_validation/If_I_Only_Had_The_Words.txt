If I only had the words to tell you  
If you only had the time to understand  
Though I know it wouldnt change your feelings  
And I know youll carry on the best you can  
  
If I only had the urge to tell you  
If you only knew how hard it is to say  
When the simple lines have all been taken  
And the radio repeats them evry day  
  
If I never find the song to sing you  
If you always find it hard to comprehend  
Well you know there wouldnt be much meaning  
If I had to sing those tired words again  
  
Life goes on and on  
And tonight will soon be gone  
But if we try we can be sure  
  
If I only had the words to tell you  
If you only had the time to understand  
But I only have these arms to hold you  
And its all that you can ask of any man  
  
La la la la la la la la  
  
If I only had the words to tell you  
If you only had the time to understand  
Oh but I only have these arms to hold you  
And its all that you can ask of any man
