Try your best to see through the confusion  
Seems the more you see  
The less you try  
You dont know whats real and whats illusion  
If you dont know by now then how should I  
Ive been thinking bout the  
  
Love gone by  
Honey has the well run dry  
Its enough to make you cry  
Thinking bout the love gone by  
  
Give me back my heart  
And call it even  
Aint no use in figuring whos to blame  
Once I thought this love was made in heaven  
Now I think its just a crying shame  
And Ive been thinking bout the  
  
Love gone by  
Honey has the well run dry  
Its enough to make you cry  
Thinking bout the love gone by  
  
Winners never know the worth of losing  
Til the prize has slipped right through their hands  
Love will take a heart of its own choosing  
And break it if you try to understand  
Were left with nothing but the  
  
Love gone by  
Honey has the well run dry  
Its enough to make you cry  
Thinking bout the love gone by
