Downtown hipsters drinking up the drug line  
Down in the kitchen working in the coal mine  
Got a special sin mister you cant quite confess  
Messy little problem maybe baby need a new dress  
Razorback diamond you shine too hard  
Need a hammer help you handle a little trouble in your backyardBring it on
down to Harrys Place  
  
When Harry speaks its Harrys streets in Harrys house its Harrys roads  
You dont wanna be around brother when Harry scolds  
Its Harrys car Harrys wife Harrys dogs run Harrys town  
Your blood and money spit shines Harrys crown  
You dont fuck with Harrys money you dont fuck Harrys girls  
These are the rules this is the world  
  
You bring it on down to Harrys Place  
Bring it on down to Harrys Place  
  
You need a little shot of something dear to improve your health  
A taste of that one little weakness you allow yourself  
Youre looking for the key of that box you locked yourself in  
Just stood up to the line and be one of Harrys friends  
  
Shadow on the corner no light no sign  
Nobody on the street cept the deaf dumb and blind  
Now Connors on the couch Father McGowans at the bar  
Chief Hordens at the door checking who the fuck you are  
  
C saw Bobby dressed in drag and Mr Nice  
Carry me into a back room and dim the lights  
My arms strapped to the table a thousand angels spinning up the room  
A voice whispers in my head We do what we must do  
When we bring it on down to Harrys Place  
Bring it on down to Harrys Place  
Bring it on down to Harrys Place  
Bring it on down to Harrys Place  
  
Nobody knows his number nobody knows his name  
If he didnt exist itd all go on just the same  
Bring it on down to Harrys Place  
Bring it on down to Harrys Place  
Bring it on down to Harrys Place  
Bring it on down to Harrys Place
