Daybreak  
How can I ever leave this place beside you  
You were the only one I ever cried to  
The night is through  
  
Now its heartache  
I got to get home before he sees its daybreak  
Light from the sky is shining through the curtain lace  
I never really meant to stay  
  
And now its daybreak  
We were just sitting and talking  
Oh who would have thought wed be spending the night  
Dreading the light of daybreak  
  
How can I leave this place beside you  
How can I leave you baby leave you  
I dont want to go  
  
And now its daybreak  
We were like storybook children  
Hey but like all good fairy tales this one must end  
Here is the end Its daybreak  
  
How can I ever leave this place beside you  
You were the only one I ever cried to  
The night is through  
  
Lord knows its daybreak  
And it feels like heartbreak  
I dont want to leave you  
I dont want to leave you I need you  
Looks like its daybreak  
But it feels like its heartache  
I dont want to leave you  
Dont make me leave you I need you  
Daybreak  
Sunlight shining through the lace  
I need you  
Sun is smiling on your face  
I need you  
Dont make me leave you  
Lord
