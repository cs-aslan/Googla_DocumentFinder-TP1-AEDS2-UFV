Every day is a lost weekend  
Every day since my baby said goodbye  
Every day is a lost weekend  
I feel just like crawling off somewhere to die  
Just like a clown I played around  
Too many times I was untrue  
I still remember your parting words were  
If you need me Ill call you  
Every day is a lost weekend  
Every day since my baby said goodbye  
Just like a clown I played around  
Too many times I was untrue  
I still remember your parting words were  
If you need me Ill call you  
Every day is a lost weekend  
Every day since my baby said goodbye  
Well Im choking choking on heartaches  
I feel just like crawling off somewhere to die  
I feel just like crawling off somewhere to die
