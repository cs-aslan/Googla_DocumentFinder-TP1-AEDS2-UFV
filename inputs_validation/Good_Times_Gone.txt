Lost it on the chesterfield  
Or maybe on  
A gamblin wheel  
Lost it in a diamond mine  
Its dark as hell  
And hard to find  
You can climb to the  
Top of the highest tree  
You can look around  
But you still wont see  
What Im lookin for  
  
Where the good times gone  
Where the good times gone  
All the stupid fun  
And all that shit weve done  
Where the good times gone  
Well I still dont know  
  
Out in the back  
In the old corn field  
Underneath the tractor wheel  
Thought Id dig  
Till Id found it first  
Broke my back  
And died of thirst  
You can bribe the devil  
You can pray to God  
You can sell off  
Everything you got  
And you still wont know  
  
Where the good times gone  
Where the good times gone  
All the stupid fun  
And all that shit weve done  
Where the good times gone  
And you still dont know  
  
Saw it on the silver screen  
Preacher says  
Dont know what it means  
Last page ad  
In a comic book  
Bought me a map  
Showed me where to look  
It aint carved of stone  
Or made of wood  
And if you paid for it  
Then its still no good  
And you still wont know  
What Im looking for  
  
Where the good times gone  
Where the good times gone  
All the stupid fun  
And all that shit weve done  
Where the good times gone
