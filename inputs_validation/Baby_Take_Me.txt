Baby take me  
And if you want a love that cant be beat  
Baby take me  
And if you want a love thats oh so sweet  
Baby take me

Dont you know you know my heart  
All you gotta do is make a start  
And if you want a love that cant be beat  
Baby take me  
And if you want a love thats oh so sweet

If you want a love that cant be beat  
And if you want a love that cant be beat  
And if you want a love that cant be beat
