In fear every day every evening  
He calls her aloud from above  
Carefully watched for a reason  
Painstaking devotion and love  
Surrendered to self preservation  
From others who care for themselves  
A blindness that touches perfection  
But hurts just like anything else  
Isolation isolation isolation  
Mother I tried please believe me  
Im doing the best that I can  
Im ashamed of the things Ive been put through  
Im ashamed of the person I am  
Isolation isolation isolation  
But if you could just see the beauty  
These things I could never describe  
These pleasures a wayward distraction  
This is my one lucky prize  
Isolation isolation Isolation isolation isolation
