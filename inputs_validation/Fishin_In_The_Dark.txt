Lazy yellow moon coming up tonight  
Shining through the trees  
Crickets are singing and lightning bugs  
Are floating on the breeze baby get ready  
  
Cross the field where the creek turns back  
By the old stump road  
Im gonna take you to a special place  
That nobody knows baby get ready  
  
You and me going fishin in the dark  
Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows  
Down by the river in the full moonlight  
  
Well be falling in love in the middle of the night  
Just moving slow  
Spend the whole night through  
Feels so good to be with you  
  
Spring is almost over and the summers coming  
The days are getting long  
Ive waited all winter for the time to be right  
Just to take you along baby get ready  
  
And it dont matter if we sit forever  
And the fish dont bite  
Well jump in the river and cool ourselves  
From the heat of the night baby get ready  
  
You and me going fishin in the dark  
Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows  
Down by the river in the full moonlight  
  
Well be falling in love in the middle of the night  
Just moving slow  
Spend the whole night through  
Feels so good to be with  
You and me going fishin in the dark  
Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows  
Down by the river in the full moonlight  
  
Well be falling in love in the middle of the night  
Just moving slow  
You and me going fishin in the dark  
Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows  
  
Down by the river in the full moonlight  
Well be falling in love in the middle of the night  
Just moving slow  
You and me going fishin in the dark
