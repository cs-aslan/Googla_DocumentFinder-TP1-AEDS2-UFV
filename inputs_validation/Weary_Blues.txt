Words and music by hank williams sr  
  
Capo 3rd fret key f play d  
The d snow falls g round my d window  
But g it cant chill my d heart  
God g knows it died the d day you left  
My dream world a7 fell ad part  
  
Chorus  
Weary d bluueue g ues from d waitin  
Lord Ive been e7 waitin too a7 long  
These d blues have g got me d cryin  
Oh sweet maama a7 please come d home  
  
Thru tears I watch young lovers  
As they go strollin by  
Oh all the things that might have been  
God forgive me if I cry  
  
Chorus
