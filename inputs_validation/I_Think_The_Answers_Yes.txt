Im walking through these pastures  
Im picking up sweet fruit  
Im shaking hands with people  
That previously Id shoot  
But nothing will dissuade me  
Nothing will dilute  
I want to execute  
I want to execute  
  
And you tend to meet a lot of scum en route  
It doesnt mean youve joined the other side  
And because I still wear shorts and my smile is oh so cute  
It doesnt mean Ill run away and hide  
  
To a world where the leaders finally confess  
I think the answers yes I think the answers yes  
To the burning of the Stock Exchange and bombing of the press  
I think the answers yes I think the answers yes  
  
I think the answers yes yes yes I think the answers yes  
  
Im walking through these corridors  
Where crime meets pantomime  
Theyre laughing and theyre drinking  
On the swill of overtime  
And noone seems to know about  
The deathwish that theyve signed  
Ah lifes unkind  
Ah lifes unkind  
  
And they see me as a potential new recruit  
They rub their hands slap their backs and smile  
But I still wear suspenders underneath my business suit  
So neednt worry about me for a while  
  
So to a world without hunger where royalty face death  
I think the answers yes I think the answers yes  
To the breaking down of barriers of North South  
East and West  
I think the answers yes I think the answers yes  
  
I think the answers yes yes yes I think the answers yes  
I think the answers yes yes yes I think the answers yes  
  
And noone seems to know about  
The deathwish that theyve signed  
Ah lifes unkind  
Ah lifes unkind  
Lifes unkind lifes unkind  
From poor old U2 to poor old Simple Minds  
No amnesty for murderers of poor old working class  
Rope or gas rope or gas rope or gas  
No amnesty for murderers of poor old working class  
Rope or gas rope or gas
