Cindy oh Cindy  
Cindy dont let me down  
Write me a letter soon  
And Ill be homeward bound  
  
I joined the Navy to see the world  
But nowhere could I find  
A girl as sweet as Cindy  
The girl I left behind  
Ive searched the wide world over  
Cant get her out of my mind  
  
Cindy oh Cindy  
Cindy dont let me down  
Write me a letter soon  
And Ill be homeward bound  
  
I see her face in every wave  
Her lips kiss every breeze  
Her loving arms reach out to me  
Through calm and stormy sea  
At night I face the lonely day  
Caressed by memories  
  
Cindy oh Cindy  
Cindy dont let me down  
Write me a letter soon  
And Ill be homeward bound  
  
I know my Cindys waiting for me  
As I walk the decks alone  
Her loving arms reach out to me  
Soon Ill be heading home  
Then my sailing days will be over  
No more will I roam  
  
Cindy oh Cindy  
Girl oh dont you let me down  
Write me a letter soon  
And Ill be homeward bound  
  
Oh homeward bound  
Well just to see my Cindy oh Cindy Cindy oh Cindy fade
