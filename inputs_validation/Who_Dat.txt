And I aint talkin AKs Im talkin shit wit propellers  
Fly to the club make my old bitch jealous  
Thug motivation this is straight celebration  
I see Gizzle in his chopper outside Central Station  
This aint a mixtape but the tapes mixed  
Black tape red tape all on one brick  
Get it on the flo get get it on the flo  
Last night I swear to God half a mil on the flo  
Fell asleep on the money like a pillow on the flo  
Woke up got money had to get it off the flo  
  
Chorus  
  
What you know about twenty grand stuffed in a white sock  
Pull off in a white drop like I play for the White Sox  
Play wit them white blocks play wit them white squares  
You call it what you want who the fuck cares  
I dont never sleep why too paranoid OK  
State of paranoia all I do is call my lawyer  
Tell em I know them niggas that might have a lil trouble  
OK you knows me if you beat it I pay you double  
Yall niggas knows me if I want to I make it double  
Just know its water whipped so you might have a lil trouble  
Might move a little slower might get a few complaints  
Say he ran outta gas he might need a half a tank  
Thank God its Friday fresh off the highway  
Seen too manys out he bout to pull in the driveway  
Where In the driveway  
Take the work out cut the duct tape  
Check the work out young
