Mama is having problems  
always comes to me  
Your daddys been a drinker since 1943  
They tell you Im a loser  
Cause I like bein free  
But truth is in the mirror  
Its what they never see  
  
I sing Yeah  
Long time ago  
You tried to tell me son  
keep our daughter home  
I said no no no no  
  
Now I dont mind them saying  
That you should be praying  
For me fast taker  
Right heres where Im staying  
Lifes a game I play  
For keeps fast taker bed breaker love maker  
Take it away  
  
Only sixteen  
a woman not a girl  
Old enough  
For a trip around the world  
Pick you up on Friday  
When daddy goes to sleep  
Bring you back on Sunday  
When hes watching Billy Graham on TV  
  
Oh yeah he wont see me  
  
Now do it right with music  
Then you learn how to use it  
All night fast taker  
Right heres where Im staying  
Lifes a game I play  
For keeps fast taker bed breaker love maker  
Take it away
