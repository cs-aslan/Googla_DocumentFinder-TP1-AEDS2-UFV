So Ive seen my future  
And Ive seen dream killers  
And Ive seen you everytime  
So Ive heard opinions  
And Ive heard dark rumours  
And Ive heard you everytime  
You hurt my feelings  
You hurt my family  
You hurt my reasons to try  
I cant forgive you  
I will remember  
Ill pay you back one cold day  
So Ive seen my weakness  
And Ive seen my heart break  
And Ive seen you everytime  
So Ive heard promises  
And Ive heard every lie  
And Ive heard you everytime  
You lied to father  
You lied to mother  
You lied to brother and me  
I used to dream now  
I forget how to  
So should I learn how to lie  
You take my picture  
You take my ghosts and laugh  
You take my reason  
You take my soul away  
You take my heartbeat  
You take my innocence  
You take my dreams and  
Youll take my life away  
So now Im old news  
And you would change me  
But Im so tired of this  
There is no comfort  
In fame when it dies  
And Im so tired of it
