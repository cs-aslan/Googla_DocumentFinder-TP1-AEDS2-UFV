Somebodys been lyin  
Somebodys been callin me tellin me he still loves me  
But not the way I thought it would be  
Hes makin fun of me and laughin at my dreams  
And I know that he keeps  
Sayin not to worry  
Hes tellin me to just hold on  
But hes not here to learn on  
And words wont warm my bed now hes gone  
It isnt easy letting go of what we had  
And I guess Im just scared  
And I still believe him though  
Id be wiser to go on my own way  
Somebodys been lyin  
And I know youre tellin me only the things you want to  
I guess I lie as much as you do  
It seems so funny letting go of yesterday  
Guess were much too afraid and were much too alone  
Were we just too much in love
