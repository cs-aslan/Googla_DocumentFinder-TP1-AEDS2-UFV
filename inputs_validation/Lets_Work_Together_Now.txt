Those in need and those with plenty  
All are one

Towards a better kind of world  
One for our childrens child

Respect our neighbors way of life  
Weve got to harmonize

And you will find yourself  
With all the friends you need

Are only due to selfish acts of mens on greed  
Lets stop all this creed
