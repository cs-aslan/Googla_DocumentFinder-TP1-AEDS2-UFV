She knows about me  
I heard about your secret life  
She thinks that youre a family man  
You got two babies and a wife  
  
I never thought youd sink this love  
Two many lovers in this wrong  
Im suffocating  
  
And now youre standing in front of me  
Begging me not to leave  
Complicated disaster  
And as I struggle to understand  
What became of the man who  
Promised me ever after  
  
I turn away but I cant run  
Youre all that I remember  
  
Its been three hours  
Since she shared her story in this room  
She seems like such a gentle girl  
You came and left her much too soon  
  
She said it lasted just six months  
  
The fear of being completely wrong  
Has taken over  
  
And now youre standing in front of me  
Begging me not to leave  
Complicated disaster  
And as I struggle to understand  
What became of the man who  
Promised me ever after  
  
I turn away but I cant run  
Youre all that I remember  
  
All the plans we were making  
Just got washed away with the tears  
Im drowning  
But you cant save me  
This time  
  
Complicated disaster  
  
And now youre standing in front of me  
Begging me not to leave  
Complicated disaster  
And as I struggle to understand  
What became of the man who  
Promised me ever after
