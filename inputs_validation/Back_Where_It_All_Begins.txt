Say you want to be a rollin stone  
n get your sail out in the wind  
Get out on the highway  
And just let it roll on  
Roll on back to someplace you aint never been  
Hey hey  
When I was younger  
I was hard to hold  
Seem like Is always goin  
Whichever way the wind was blowin  
Now that travelin feelin  
Calls me again  
Callin me back where it all begins  
  
Moon rise  
And sun go down  
Turn my whole world around  
Little star up in the sky  
Tell my sweet baby  
Please dont cry  
Please dont cry  
  
Moon rise  
And sun go down  
Turn my whole world around  
Little star up in the sky  
Tell my sweet baby  
Please dont cry  
Please dont cry  
  
Travel out  
Across the burnin sand  
Across the ocean  
To some distant land  
When we reach the end  
Well all be singin  
And well all be friends  
Back where it all begins
