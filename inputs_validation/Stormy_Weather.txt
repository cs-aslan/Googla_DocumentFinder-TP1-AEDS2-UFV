Dont know why  
Theres no sun up in the sky  
Stormy weather  
Since my man and I aint together  
Keeps raining all the time  
  
Life is bare  
Gloom and misery everywhere  
Stormy weather  
Just cant get my poor old self together  
Im weary all the time the time  
So weary all of the time  
  
When he went away  
The blues walked in and met me  
If he stays away old rocking chair will get me  
All I do is pray  
The lord above will let me  
Walk in the sun once more  
  
Cant go on  
Everything I had is gone  
Stormy weather  
Since my man and I aint together  
Keeps raining all the time  
Keeps raining all of the time  
  
I walk around  
Heavyhearted and sad  
Night comes around  
And Im still feeling bad  
Rain pourin down  
Blinding every hope I had  
This pitter n patter n beatin n spatterin drivin me mad  
  
Love love love love  
This misery will be the end of me  
  
When he went away  
The blues walked in and met me  
If he stays away old rocking chair will get me  
All I do is pray  
The lord above will let me  
Walk in the sun once more  
  
Cant go on  
Everything I had is gone  
Stormy weather  
Since my man and I aint together  
Keeps raining all the time the time  
Keeps raining all the time
