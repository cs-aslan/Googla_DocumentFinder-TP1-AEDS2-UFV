I turned around  
Before I could run I found you already settled down in the back of my mind  
I know this is just a customary feelin  
The moon is our deceiver that will leave you running blind  
  
Your heart is pullin  
If I didnt know any better  
Id be fallin  
Deeper and deeper its true  
Id hear it callin  
If I didnt know any better  
And Id be in love with you  
  
Didnt want to  
Look in the eyes of the one that I would be drawn to  
Im a moth lost in a fire  
And I know this is just a beautiful illusion a case of the confusion between
love and desire  
  
Your heart is pullin  
If I didnt know any better  
Id be fallin  
Deeper and deeper its true  
Id hear it callin  
If I didnt know any better  
And Id be in love  
  
When the flame burns out  
And finely settles down  
And youd forget I ever came around  
  
Your heart is pullin  
If I didnt know any better  
Id be fallin  
Deeper and deeper its true  
Id hear it callin  
If didnt know any better  
And Id be in love with you  
  
I turned around  
Before I could run I found you already settled down in the back of my mind
