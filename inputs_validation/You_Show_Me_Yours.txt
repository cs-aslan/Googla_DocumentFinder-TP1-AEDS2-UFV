If youre feeling salty then Im your tequila  
If youve got the freedom Ive got the time  
There aint nothing sweeter than naked emotions  
So you show me yours hon and ill show you mine  
  
No mam I know this aint all that youve ever been used to  
You with your rings on your fingers and time on your hands  
Sometimes its nice to have somebody nice to be close to  
God knows Ive been there before you and I understand  
  
Chorus  
  
I wish that I was the answer to all of your questions  
God knows I know you wish you were the answer to mine  
Darling if you aint a thing but a change in direction  
Lord dont you know youd be somethin Im lucky to find  
  
Chorus  
  
So you show me yours and ill show you mine
