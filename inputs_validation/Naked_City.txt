All the victims have turned to stone  
No one is happy theyre all alone  
Id sacrifice my social position tonight  
In New York millionaires and lonely people with lonely stares  
Im not lookin for love and Im lost in this night  
In the naked city in the city  
There are ten million stories naked city  
Im not lookin for pity in the city  
In this naked city naked city  
Street vampires in the night young lovers and love at first sight  
This is my flesh and my fantasy  
Older women with younger men Ive got a feelin Im in trouble again  
But Ive got to live my destiny  
In the naked city in the city its a race with the devil naked city  
All the pain and the sorrow in the city  
Is there more tomorrow naked city  
In the naked naked city in the city naked city  
Lonely people lookin for someone lonely people goin their way  
Lonely people lookin for something lonely people goin their way  
In New York millionaires lonely people with lonely stares  
Im not lookin for love and Im lost in this night  
In the naked city there are ten million stories  
Im not lookin for pity in this naked city  
In the naked naked city in the city  
Its a race with the devil naked city  
All the pain and the sorrow in the city  
Is there more tomorrow naked city  
In the city naked city
