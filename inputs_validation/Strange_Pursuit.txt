Intersecting love lines  
Drew us closer every day  
Always kept your distance  
When you felt my presence near you  
Love keeps on rolling over  
  
Fly in retreat  
I would follow without shame  
A stupid spud staggering to the flame  
To be had and rehad  
Be a victim of the pain  
Now its strange its so strange  
Its a strange pursuit  
Its a strange pursuit  
Its a strange pursuit  
  
I come running like a fatboy  
In lead shoes  
But like a fatboy  
Huff puffing after you  
Its hopeless to hope for  
The one thing that Im wanting  
Cause its strange  
Its so very strange  
  
Its a strange pursuit  
Darling Im dazzled  
But you know Im too Frazzled  
Its a strange pursuit  
Makin my mind up  
While it lies in little pieces  
Its a strange pursuit  
  
You know its getting tough  
When youre getting real rough  
Its a strange pursuit  
Darling Im dazzled  
But you know Im too frazzled  
Its a strange pursuit  
Makin my mind up  
While it lies in little pieces  
It s a strange pursuit
