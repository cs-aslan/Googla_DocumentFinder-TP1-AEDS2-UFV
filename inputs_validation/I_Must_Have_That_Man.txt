Dont want my mammy  
I dont need a friend  
My heart is broken  
It wont ever mend  
I aint much carin  
Just where I will end  
I must have that man  
  
Im like an oven  
Thats cryin for heat  
He treats me awful  
Each time that we meet  
Its just unlawful  
How that boy can cheat  
But I must have that man  
  
Hes hot as Hades  
A ladys not safe in his arms  
When shes kissed  
But Im afraid that hes cooled off  
And maybe Im ruled off his list  
Ill never be missed  
  
I need that person much worsen just bad  
Im falf alive and its drivin me mad  
Hes only human if hes to be had  
I must have that man  
Dont want my mammy  
I dont need a friend  
My heart is broken  
It wont ever mend  
I aint much carin  
Just where I will end  
I must have that man  
  
Im like an oven  
Thats cryin for heat  
He treats me awful  
Each time that we meet  
Its just unlawful  
How that boy can cheat  
But I must have that man  
  
Hes hot as Hades  
A ladys not safe in his arms  
When shes kissed  
But Im afraid that hes cooled off  
And maybe Im ruled off his list  
Ill never be missed  
  
I need that person much worsen just bad  
Im half alive and its drivin me mad  
Hes only human if hes to be had  
I must have that man
