Theres nothing I want but money and time  
Million dollar bills and a tick tick tick tick  
Theres nothing more cruel  
Than only nine lives  
A limit in spite  
Will do the trick trick trick trick  
  
We can leave the house lead the party let the people know  
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go  
  
Theres nothing as fun as coming untied  
And running with the kids in the park park park park  
Theres nothing that hurts like letting you go  
Tiger burn eyes in the dark dark dark dark  
  
We can leave the house lead the party let the people know  
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go  
Its not about just being out with all our people  
Cause we can get in trouble just by going free throw  
And now Im letting you know and now Im letting you know  
And now Im letting you know and now Im letting you know
