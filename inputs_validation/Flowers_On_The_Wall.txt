I keep hearin your concern about my happiness  
All that thought youve given me is conscience I guess  
If I were walkin in your shoes I wouldnt worry none  
While you and your friends are worryin bout me  
Im havin lots of fun  
  
Countin flowers on the wall that dont bother me at all  
Playin solitaire til dawn with a deck of fifty one  
Smokin cigarettes and watchin Captain Kangaroo  
Now dont tell me Ive nothin to do  
  
Last night I dressed in tails pretended I was on the town  
As long as I can dream its hard to slow this swinger down  
So please dont give a thought to me Im really doin fine  
You can always find me here and havin quite a time  
  
Countin flowers on the wall that dont bother me at all  
Playin solitaire til dawn with a deck of fifty one  
Smokin cigarettes and watchin Captain Kangaroo  
Now dont tell me Ive nothin to do  
  
Its good to see you I must go I know I look a fright  
Anyway my eyes are not accustomed to this light  
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete  
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete  
  
Countin flowers on the wall that dont bother me at all  
Playin solitaire til dawn with a deck of fifty one  
Smokin cigarettes and watchin Captain Kangaroo  
Now dont tell me Ive nothin to do  
Dont tell me Ive nothin to do
