You always come back when Im at my weakest  
When Im fool enough to let you in  
Sayin how this time around is different  
Asking if I want to try again  
  
Chorus  
I do  
But I dont  
I want to  
But I wont  
I am  
But I aint  
I could  
But I just cant  
It feels right  
But its wrong  
And Ive hurt way too long  
So when you ask me if I know what I want  
I do  
But I dont  
  
What resistance I have left within me  
I lose each time youre holding me this close  
With every bitter sweet kiss girl you tempt me  
Asking if I want to let you go  
  
Chorus  
  
So dont ask me if I know what I want  
Cause I do  
But I dont
