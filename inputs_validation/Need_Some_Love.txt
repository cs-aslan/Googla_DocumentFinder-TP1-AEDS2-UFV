Im running here  
Im running there  
Im looking for a girl  
Cause theres nothing I need  
Theres nothing I want more  
In the whole wide world  
  
Well I need it quick  
And I need it now  
Before I start to fade away  
Thats why Im searching  
Thats why Im looking  
Each and every day  
  
Oh I need some love  
I said I need some love  
Oh yes I need some love  
This feeling I cant rise above  
Yeah yeah  
  
Well I been hustling here  
I been hustling there  
I been searching for about a week  
And I started feeling  
This strange sensation  
My knees are starting getting weak  
  
Well I need what keeps  
A young man alive  
Im saying I need it now  
Im gonna get the message  
Across to you  
Someway somehow  
  
Oh I need some love  
I said I need some love  
Oh yes I need some love  
This feeling I cant rise above  
Oh yeah yeah
