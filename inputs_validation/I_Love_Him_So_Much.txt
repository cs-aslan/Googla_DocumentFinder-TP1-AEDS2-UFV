Today we broke up tomorrow well make up  
And again hell hang up on me  
But you see I know hell never hurt me  
I know hell never desert me  
And so I just say thats my man anyway  
Tonight well love plenty tomorrow maybe not any  
But Im sure hell come through just in time  
And to me hes more than just a man  
Hes my life so I understand why things has got to be his way  
And I love him so much so much til it hurts me  
Yes I do so much so much til it hurts me  
He makes me cry when I wanna laugh sometimes  
His moods they keep changing all the time  
But I know just where his head is when its not laying on top of mine  
His world is not so different and you may not believe  
But Im sure youd understand him if you were me  
And thats why this world cant look and frown  
But Ill never let him down  
That is my man and he means the world to me  
And I love him so much so much til it hurts me  
Yes I love him so much so much til it hurts me  
Oh so much so much til it hurts me  
I love him so so much so much til it hurts me much  
So much so much
