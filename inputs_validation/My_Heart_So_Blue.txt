Ive got her picture  
Its there on the wall  
I cant remember why  
I keep it at all  
The doors are cold and  
All the windows seem gray  
I write the book  
Theres so much more I should say  
  
Chorus  
Wave goodbye  
See my heart so blue  
Wave goodbye  
See my heart so blue  
  
And now its over  
I write it all down  
No one to notice  
One less face in the crowd  
Our eyes are open  
When it suits us to say  
Dear god in heaven  
Show no mercy to me  
  
Wave wave goodbye  
See my heart so blue  
Wave wave goodbye  
Lost for you  
  
I shed no tears  
And theres no reason for shame  
A small consolation  
Hides a stone with her name  
Just a victim  
Still the light shines all bright  
Ive got her picture  
Think Ill hold it tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
Wave wave goodbye  
See my heart so blue  
Wave wave goodbye  
Lost for you
