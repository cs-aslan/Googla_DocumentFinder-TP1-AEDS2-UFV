I got a kindhearted woman  
Studies evil all the time  
I got a kindhearted woman  
She studies evil all the time  
You would do to quit me  
Just to have it on your mind  
  
I got a kindhearted woman  
Do anything in this world for me  
I got a kindhearted woman  
Do anything in this world for me  
Lord these evilhearted women  
Lord they will not let me be  
  
Aint but one thing  
Makes Mr Johnson drink  
Swear bout how you treat me baby  
I begin to think  
  
Oh baby  
My life dont feel the same  
You break my heart  
When you call Mr SoAndSos name  
  
Shes a kindhearted woman  
She studies evil all the time  
Shes a kindhearted woman  
She studies evil all the time  
You wish to quit me baby  
Just to have it on your mind
