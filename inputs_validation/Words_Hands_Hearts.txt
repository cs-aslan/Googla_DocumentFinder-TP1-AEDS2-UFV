The whole world was sleeping  
And I was there  
You could just sense this feeling in the air  
Like no ones words were good enough to define what we feared  
And no ones words were strong enough to fix what happened here  
  
Chorus  
  
Lead on to save me  
Lead us all there  
Find me some answers  
One nation beware  
Cant tell the difference between myth and man  
Or whats necessary or where I should stand  
  
The whole world is different now men have died  
They can just sense this feeling in our eyes  
Like no ones hands are big enough  
To hold onto this fear  
And no ones hands are strong enough to fix what happened here  
  
Chorus  
  
So do we do now  
Raise our voices loud  
Were searching for something that cannot be found  
Here open mouths  
I see open hands  
Blinded and silent I cant understand  
  
The whole word is watching with one blank stare  
I can just sense this feeling of illrepair  
Like no ones heart is full enough  
To keep away this fear  
And no ones heart is strong enough to fix what happened here  
  
Lead on to save me  
Lead us all there  
Find me some answers  
Its time that you cared  
Cant tell the difference between myth and man  
Or whats necessary or where I should stand  
  
So do we tell now  
Raise our voices loud  
Were searching for something that cannot be found  
I hear open mouths  
And I see open hands  
Like the blinded and silent I cant understand
