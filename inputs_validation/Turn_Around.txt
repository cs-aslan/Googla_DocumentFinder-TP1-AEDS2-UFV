Want to cross but I dont think I can  
Its too weak here even where I stand  
Come here darling let me see you hold my hand  
So we can mend your broken halo  
  
All I want from you  
And all I want from you is for you to  
Turn around  
Turn around  
  
Want to damage so I damaged it some  
We use to have it all now I just got some  
Silent perfections mystery all easy to fall from your lips  
All the while lies are told to me in shapeless secrets  
  
When all I want from you  
All I want from you  
Is for you to  
Turn around Repeat x4  
  
Cant your turn around  
Cant you turn around  
Cant you turn around  
Why cant you turn around  
  
Turn around  
Turn around  
Turn around
