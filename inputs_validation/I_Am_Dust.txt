We were dust in a world  
Of grim obsession  
  
We were torn from our  
Life of isolation  
  
We were pulled from our path  
Of least resistance  
  
And the songs we sang  
What became of us  
  
Were here waiting for you  
Were here waiting for you  
  
We are yours  
Were waiting for you  
We are yours  
Were waiting for you  
  
We all pray for the end  
For the god to take us  
  
We were falling down  
One by one  
  
We were weak and the fear  
Was all around us  
  
The machines screamed from  
Moon to sun  
  
Were here waiting for you  
Were here waiting for you  
  
We are yours  
Were waiting for you  
We are yours  
Were waiting for you
