You took me out so far that I cant swim to shore  
Ive been holding on but youre not anymore  
Our love would always lead us home constant as the Northern Star  
Heres a storm we wont get through cause its not in your heart  
  
I can feel you drifting slowly out of reach  
Out there in the distance theres something else you need  
If I could be whats missing thats all Id want to be  
I can feel you drifting  
  
In the silence thats become the company we keep  
Ive realized how far we are from what we used to be  
A part of you has gone somewhere I cant seem to touch  
I could stay and take whats left but baby thats not us  
  
I can feel you drifting slowly out of reach  
Out there in the distance theres something else you need  
If I could be whats missing thats all Id want to be  
I can feel you drifting  
  
If I could be whats missing thats all Id want to be  
I can feel you drifting I can feel you drifting youre out of reach
