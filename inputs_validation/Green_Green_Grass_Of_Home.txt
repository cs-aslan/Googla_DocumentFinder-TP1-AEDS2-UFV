The old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train  
And there to meet me is my mama and papa  
And down the road I look and there runs Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries  
Its good to touch the green green grass of home  
Yes theyve all come to meet me  
Arms reaching smiling sweetly  
Its so good to touch the green green grass of home  
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry  
And theres that old oak tree that I used to play on  
Down the lane Id walk with my sweet Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries  
Its good to touch the green green grass of home  
Yes theyve all come to meet me  
Arms reaching smiling sweetly  
Its so good to touch the green green grass of home  
Then I awake and look around me at the gray walls that surround me  
And I realized that I was only dreaming  
For theres a guard and theres a sad old padre  
Arm in arm well walk at daybreak  
Again Ill touch the green green grass of home  
Yes theyll all come to see me  
In the shade of that old oak tree  
As they lay me neath the green green grass of home
