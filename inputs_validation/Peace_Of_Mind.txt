Every time I have it made  
I let it rain on my parade  
I need a star that doesnt fade  
When I open my eyes  
Everything is clear to see  
Youve given me a destiny  
I know theres something left for me  
And I found it this time  
  
Chorus  
I dont want it all I just want a little bit  
And Ill never stop til I get to it  
  
Being with a woman like you  
Is all I ever wanted to do  
Give me something I can hold on to  
Then Ill have it all  
  
Find a little place in the sun  
Wont you tell me Im the chosen one  
Say you need me when the day is done  
Then Ill have enough  
To get me through my life  
  
Chorus  
  
I never will reget it  
Cause Im having the time of my life  
I can fly on the wings of our love here in the night  
Oh it hurts if I let it  
But its something Id rather forget  
Now the past isnt holding me down  
Oh dont you know  
Ive learned to let it go
