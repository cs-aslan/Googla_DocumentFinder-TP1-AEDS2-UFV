I must look away  
I must find a way  
You know there is a line  
Dont try to take whats mine  
I feel it bottled up inside  
This hate and all this pride  
Cant you let me have some of it  
  
Daddy youre drinking your life away  
Mummy please go away  
Must that man stay  
Cant he go away  
Mum Your fucked inside  
Brought him to your life  
Now youre his wife  
This isnt right  
  
Must I feel this way  
Must I crawl inside  
Get me out of here  
Dont need him by my side  
Dont tell me what to fucking do  
Ill fuck you up I promise you  
Get the fuck out of my site  
  
Daddy youre drinking your life away  
Mummy please go away  
Must that man stay  
Cant he go away  
Mum Your fucked inside  
Brought him to your life  
Now youre his wife  
This isnt right  
  
Get the fuck out of my face  
I dont need you around this place  
You worry me go away  
Dont burry me feel my hate  
Just go away  
Hey my times gone for today  
And your still here with me  
Ill fuck you up leave  
Just leave me alone  
  
Alone x3  
  
Mummy x5
