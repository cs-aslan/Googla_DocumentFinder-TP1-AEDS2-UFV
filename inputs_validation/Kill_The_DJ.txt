Walkin after dark  
In the New York City park  
Your thoughts are so unholy  
In the holiness of old  
On with Christian soldiers  
Filled with jivin mind control  
  
The blood left on the dance floor  
Runnin runnin red  
The bullet that you asked for  
Killin you to death  
Unless you  
  
Someone kill the DJ shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ shoot the fucking DJ  
Voices in my head are sayin  
Shoot that fucker down  
  
We are the vultures  
The dirtiest kind  
Well cut you once  
In your heart and your mind  
  
Walkin after dark  
In the New York City park  
Ill pick up whats left in the club  
My pocket full of pills  
Sodom and Gomorrah  
In the century of thrills  
The blood left on the dance floor  
Runnin runnin red  
The bullet that you asked for  
Killin you to death  
Unless you  
  
Someone kill the DJ shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ shoot the fucking DJ  
Hold him underwater  
Till the motherfucker drowns  
  
We are the vultures  
The dirtiest kind  
Well cut you once  
In your heart and your mind  
Someones gonna get you boy  
Shoot that fucker down  
  
Someone kill the DJ shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ shoot the fucking DJ  
Shoot that fucker down  
  
Someone kill the DJ shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ shoot the fucking DJ  
Voices in my head are sayin  
Shoot that fucker down
