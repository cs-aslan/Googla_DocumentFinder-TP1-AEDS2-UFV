I wanna get to know what you have below  
That handsome halo that you show  
I wanna get behind the light in your eyes  
In case your smile is hiding some darkness I love inside  
  
And it might not be the right time  
But thats when they say Ill find  
The next great love of mine  
So tell me whos making these rules  
And if youd like to break them too  
Cause if you do then baby Im following you  
  
I wanna take a quick taste of your lips  
In case theyre perfection to kiss  
And I swear that Ill be gentle with your promises  
And I know that this isnt slow  
Like a friend said we should go  
But I dont wanna miss on the chance to hold  
Someone like you really close  
  
And this might not be the right time  
But thats when they say Ill find  
The next great love of mine  
So tell me whos making these rules  
And if youd like to break them too  
Cause if you do then baby Im following you  
  
I think you should know that Im broken  
I hope youre broken too  
Cause I believe that two broken pieces dont need no glue  
  
And it might not be the right time  
But thats when they say Ill find  
The next great love of mine  
So tell me whos making these rules  
And if you like to break rules too  
Cause if you do then baby Im following  
Ill follow you  
Ill follow you
