Lady are you crying do the tears belong to me  
Did you think our time together was all gone  
Lady youve been dreaming Im as close as I can be  
And I swear to you our time has just begun  
  
Close your eyes and rest your weary mind  
I promise I will stay right here beside you  
Today our lives were joined became entwined  
I wish that you could know how much I love you  
  
Lady are you happy do you feel the way I do  
Are there meanings that youve never seen before  
Lady my sweet lady I just cant believe its true  
And its like Ive never ever loved before  
  
Chorus  
  
Lady are you crying do the tears belong to me  
Did you think our time together was all gone  
Lady my sweet lady Im as close as I can be  
And I swear to you our time has just begun
