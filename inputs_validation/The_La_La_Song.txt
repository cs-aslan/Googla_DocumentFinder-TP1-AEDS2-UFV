I wont be the fool in my life  
I wont change the rules in my life  
In all your silence  
I knew it all along  
You havent got the sense to know  
Whats right from what is wrong  
And I really havent got the time to  
Tell you about the things that are absurd  
  
Dont fear tomorrow  
Dont fear tomorrow  
  
I wont play the fool to your knife to your knife  
You cant change the tune in my sight in my life  
With all you science I knew it all along  
You havent got the nerve to write the words  
Within this song  
And you really havent got the time to tell  
Me why you really are  
You really havent got the time to tell me  
Why you really are  
You really havent got the time to tell me  
Why you really are  
  
Dont fear tomorrow  
Dont fear tomorrow
