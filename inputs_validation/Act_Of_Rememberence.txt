Arms of steel hair of gold  
Royal blue eyes with a rebel soul  
You scared me you still do  
But I loved you  
More than you ever knew  
This is my act of remembrance  
My act of remembrance  
Doctors face said the time had come  
I stood up and began to run  
My boys voice called your name  
You roared back and the silence came  
This is my act of remembrance  
My act of remembrance  
Drove my car to your street  
Hoped a ghost I would meet  
Well that ghost hes moved on  
But his anger Dad is it gone  
Is the pain gone is it all gone  
This is my act of remembrance  
My act of remembrance  
This is my act of remembrance
