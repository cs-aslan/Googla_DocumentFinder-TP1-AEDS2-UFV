I want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad  
Wont you play for me a down home country song  
Cause when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off  
With a barefoot ballad you just cant go wrong  
  
Give me a honktonk fiddle with a guitar in the middle and a melody  
Humming like a fountain swinging out on Smokey mountain  
  
I want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad  
Wont you play for me a down home country song  
Cause when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off  
With a barefoot ballad you just cant go wrong  
  
Now the big toes connected to the two toe  
And the two toes connected to the three toe  
And the three toes connected to the four toe  
And the four toes connected to the five toe  
And the five toe and away we go  
  
I want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad  
Wont you play for me a down home country song  
Cause when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off  
With a barefoot ballad you just cant go wrong  
  
Now the big toes connected to the two toe  
And the two toes connected to the three toe  
And the three toes connected to the four toe  
And the four toes connected to the five toe  
And the five toe and away we go  
  
I want to barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad  
Wont you play for me a barefoot ballad song
