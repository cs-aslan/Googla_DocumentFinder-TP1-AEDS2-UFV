I threw my robe on in the morning  
Watched the ring on the stove turn to red  
Stared hypnotized into a cup of coffee  
Pulled on my boots and made the bed  
Screen door hangin off its hinges  
Kept bangin me awake all night  
As I look out the window  
The only thing in sight  
  
Is dry lightning on the horizon line  
Just dry lightning and you on my mind  
  
I chased the heat of her blood  
Like it was the holy grail  
Descend beautiful spirit  
Into the evening pale  
Her appaloosas  
Kickin in the corral smelling rain  
Theres a low thunder rolling  
Cross the mesquite plain  
But theres just dry lightning on the horizon line  
Its just dry lightning and you on my mind  
  
Id drive down to Alvarado street  
Where she danced to make ends meet  
Id spend the night over my gin  
As shed talk to her men  
  
Well the piss yellow sun  
Comes bringin up the day  
She said aint nobody gonna give nobody  
What they really need anyway  
  
Well you get so sick of the fightin  
You lose your fear of the end  
But you cant lose your memory  
And the sweet smell of your skin  
And its just dry lightning on the horizon line  
Just dry lightning and you on my mind
