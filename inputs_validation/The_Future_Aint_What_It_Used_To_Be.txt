I never knew so many bad times  
Could follow me so mercilessly  
Its almost surreal  
All the pain that I feel  
The future aint what it used to be  
  
It doesnt matter what theyre thinking  
It doesnt matter what theyre thinking of me  
Its always so cold  
Im to young to be old  
The future aint what it used to be  
  
Were there ever any stars in the sky  
Did the sun ever shine so bright  
Do you have any dreams I could borrow  
Just to get me through the lonely night  
Is there anything left to hold on to  
When the rivers wash it all away  
Is there anyone left to hold on to  
Is there anything left I can say  
  
Chorus  
Say a prayer for the falling angels  
Stem the tide of the rising waters  
Toll a bell for the broken hearted  
Burn a torch for your sons and daughters  
The endless night has got a hold of me  
Dark days are pulling me forward  
And all the tears are washing over me  
Im crying lost forever  
In a future that aint what it used to be  
No more no more no more  
  
Its like a storm thats never ending  
Its like a shadow on the land and the sea  
Theres nothing so sad as  
A tomorrow gone bad  
The future aint what it used to be  
  
Some days I feel so numb and empty  
And those would be the good days for me  
Nothing gets to me now  
Unless Im thinking of how  
The future aint what it used to be  
  
Is there anything left to hold on to  
When the rivers wash it all away  
Is there anyone left to hold on to  
Is there anything left I can say  
  
Chorus  
  
The future just aint what it used to be  
Its never gonna be like it was  
The future just aint what it used to be  
I wish it wouldnt come but it does  
I wish it wouldnt come but it always does
