Lets have a black celebration  
Black Celebration  
Tonight  
To celebrate the fact  
That weve seen the back  
Of another black day  
I look to you  
How you carry on  
When all hope is gone  
Cant you see  
Your optimistic eyes  
Seem like paradise  
To someone like  
Me  
I want to take you  
In my arms  
Forgetting all I couldnt do today  
Black Celebration  
Black Celebration  
Tonight  
To celebrate the fact  
That weve seen the back  
Of another black day  
I look to you  
And your strong belief  
Me I want relief  
Tonight  
Consolation  
I want so much  
Want to feel your touch  
Tonight  
Take me in your arms  
Forgetting all you couldnt do today  
Black Celebration  
Ill drink to that  
Black Celebration  
Tonight
