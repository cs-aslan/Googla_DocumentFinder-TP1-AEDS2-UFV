After six hours of school Ive had enough for the day  
I hit the radio dial and turn it up all the way  
  
I gotta dance dance dance dance now the beats really hot right on the spot  
Dance dance dance right there on the spot  
The beats really hot  
Dance dance dance now the beats really hot  
Dance dance dance dance dance dance yeah  
  
When I feel put down I try to shake it off quick  
With my guy by my side the radio does the trick  
  
I want to dance dance dance dance now the beats really hot right on the
spot  
Dance dance dance right there on the spot  
The beats really hot  
Dance dance dance now the beats really hot  
Dance dance dance dance dance dance yeah  
  
At a weekend dance we like to show up late  
I play it cool when its slow and jump it when its fast

Dance dance dance right there on the spot  
The beats really hot  
Dance dance dance now the beats really hot  
Dance dance dance dance dance dance yeah
