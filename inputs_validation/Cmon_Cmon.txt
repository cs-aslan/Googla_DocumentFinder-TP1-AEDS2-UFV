When you walked in the room I thought Id forgotten you  
Turns out it isnt true after all  
And now I do regret all the things I said  
I cant take this anymore  
  
I want you  
Im telling you  
Oh oh  
  
Cmon cmon I know I was wrong  
Throw my hands up and take the blame  
I still believe in you and me  
Do you feel the same  
Im sitting there waitin for you and baby I cant ignore you  
I just adore you and I cant get you outta my head  
Cmon cmon cmon cmon  
Ooooooo  
  
Ill do overtime just to make you mine  
I cant remember why I left you behind  
Things that I shoulda done I was having too much fun  
Why did I let you go  
  
I want you and Im telling you  
Oh oh  
  
Cmon cmon I know I was wrong  
Throw my hands up and take the blame  
I still believe in you and me  
Do you feel the same  
Im sittin there waitin for you and baby I cant ignore you  
I just adore you and I cant get you outta my head  
Cmon cmon cmon cmon  
Ooooooo  
  
I was such a fool  
Oh I was so damn cruel  
But Im willing to change  
I wanna be your man again  
  
Cmon cmon I know I was wrong  
Throw my hands up and take the blame  
I still believe in you and me  
Do you feel the same  
Im sitting there waitin for you and baby I cant ignore you  
I just adore you and I cant get you outta my head  
Cmon cmon cmon cmon
