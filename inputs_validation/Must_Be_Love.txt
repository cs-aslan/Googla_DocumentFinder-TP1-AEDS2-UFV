Never had trouble sleepin  
Always had someone next to me  
Nights I wont remember  
I fooled around til the fool was me  
  
Never thought much about you  
On and off like a well worn shoe  
Now I worry where youre walkin  
I guess the shoes on another foot  
  
Ohoh a little more pain and Ill know it  
A little more hurt Ill know its love  
Over and over til its over  
Drives me crazy it must be love  
  
Lately Im hearin rumors  
Youve been makin serious plans  
Should I have held you when I had you  
Right here in the palm of my hand  
  
Chorus  
  
This much heartache it must be love  
  
Ohoh a little more pain and Ill know it  
A little more hurt Ill know its love  
Over and over til its over  
Drives me crazy  
A little more pain and Ill know it  
A little more hurt and Ill know its love  
Over and over til its over  
Drives me crazy drives me crazy  
  
This much heartache it must be love  
  
Must be love it must be love  
Oh it must be love must be love  
It must be love must be love  
It must be love oh it must be love  
Must be love oh it must be love
