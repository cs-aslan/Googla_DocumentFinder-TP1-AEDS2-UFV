Alone in this house again tonight  
I got the TV on the sound turned down and a bottle of wine  
Theres pictures of you and I on the walls around me  
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me  
Ill never get over you walkin away  
  
Chorus  
Ive never been the kind to ever let my feelings show  
And I thought that bein strong meant never losin your selfcontrol  
But Im just drunk enough to let go of my pain  
To hell with my pride let it fall like rain  
From my eyes  
Tonight I want to cry  
  
Would it help if I turned a sad song on  
All By Myself would sure hit me hard now that youre gone  
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters  
Its gonna hurt bad before it gets better  
But Ill never get over you by hidin this way  
  
Chorus x2
