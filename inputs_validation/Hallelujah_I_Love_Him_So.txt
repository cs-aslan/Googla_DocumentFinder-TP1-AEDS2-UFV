Let me tell you bout a boy I know  
He is my baby and he lives next door  
Every morning before the sun comes up  
He brings my coffee in my favorite cup  
Thats why I know yes I know  
Hallelujah I just love him so  
  
When Im in trouble and I have no friends  
I know hell go with me until the end  
Everybody asks me how I know  
I smile and tell them he told me so  
Thats why I know yes I know  
Hallelujah I just love him so  
  
Now if I call him on the telephone  
And tell him that Im all alone  
By the time I count from one to four  
I hear him on my door  
In the evening when the sun goes down  
When there is nobody else around  
He kisses me and he holds me tight  
He tells me baby everythings all alright  
Thats why I know yes I know  
Hallelujah I just love him so
