Your touch  
Your taste  
Your breath  
Your face  
Your hands  
Your head  
Youre sweet  
Your love  
Your teeth  
Your tongue  
Your eye  
Youre mine  
Your lips  
Youre fine  
Youre heaven on earth  
  
Ive waited all my life for you  
My favorite kiss  
Your perfect skin  
Your perfect smile  
  
Waking up and youre next to me  
Wrap me up in your arms and back to sleep  
Lay my head on your chest and drift away  
Dream of you and Im almost half awake  
  
The palest green Ive ever seen  
The color of your eyes  
Youve taken me so far away  
One look and you stop time  
  
Fell in love with you and  
Everything that you are  
Nothing I can do Im really  
Crazy about you  
When youre next to me  
  
Its just like heaven on earth  
Youre heaven  
Youre heaven on earth  
  
Tell me that Ill always be the one that you want  
Dont know what Id do if I ever lose you  
Look at you and what I see is heaven on earth  
Im in love with you  
  
Your breath  
Your face  
Your hands  
Your head  
Youre sweet  
Your love  
Your tongue  
  
Id move across the world for you  
Just tell me when  
Just tell me where  
Ill come to you  
  
Take me back to that place in time  
Images of you occupy my mind  
Far away but I feel you hear with me  
Dream of you and youre almost next to me  
  
The palest green Ive ever seen  
The color of your eyes  
Youve taken me so far away  
One look and you stop time  
  
Fell in love with you and  
Everything that you are  
Nothing I can do Im really  
Crazy about you  
When youre next to me  
Its just like heaven on earth  
Youre heaven  
Youre heaven on earth  
  
Tell me that Ill always be the one that you want  
Dont know what Id do if I ever lose you  
Look at you and what I see is heaven on earth  
Im in love with you  
  
Im in love with you  
I said Im so in love  
I said Im so in love  
So in love  
  
Fall off the edge of my mind  
I fall off the edge of my mind  
For you  
I fall off the edge of my mind  
I fall off the edge of my mind  
For you  
  
Fell in love with you and  
Everything that you are  
Nothing I can do Im really  
Crazy about you  
When youre next to me  
Its just like heaven on earth  
So in love  
Youre heaven  
Youre heaven on earth  
  
Tell me that Ill always be the one that you want  
Dont know what Id do if I ever lose you  
Look at you and what I see is heaven on earth  
Im in love with you  
  
Im so in love  
Im so in love  
  
I fall off the edge of my mind  
Im so in love  
When I just look at you  
I feel like Im gonna jump into heaven  
So in love  
And youll catch me  
Catch me if I jump  
Will you catch me
