Down at the Lido they welcome you  
With sausage and beer  
Klaus and the Rooster have been there too  
But lately he spends his time here  
  
Hanging with the mayor and all his friends  
And nobody cares  
Where the sailor shuts out the sunrise  
Blacked out on the stairs  
  
Chorus  
Knock twice rap with your cane  
Feels nice youre out of the rain  
We got your skinny girl  
Here at the Western World  
  
Ruthie will give you the silver key  
To open the red door  
Lay down your Jackson and you will see  
The sweetness youve been crying for  
  
In the night you hide from the madman  
Youre longing to be  
But it all comes out on the inside  
Eventually  
  
Chorus  
  
In the night you hide from the madman  
Youre longing to be  
But it all comes out on the inside  
Eventually  
  
Chorus
