She told me I should straighten up my ways or shed be walkin out  
I guess I was just too blind to see or maybe just too proud  
So I never thought twice when she loaded up her things and drove away  
Cause I knew shed be back someday I knew shed be back  
  
Took off my work clothes and left them right there on the floor  
Cause I knew shed pick em up  
When she got home like a hundred times before  
And just to make it easier for her I left the light on on the porch  
Cause I knew shed be back someday I knew shed be back  
  
I guess I showed her how much she had to lose  
Showed her who was really who  
I know shes hurtin now  
Looks like I showed her  
  
I must have seen the movie of the month a dozen times or more  
I watched my favorite team play ball but I never heard a score  
Cause the whole time I was listening  
For the moment when shed walk through the door  
Cause I knew shed be back someday I know shell be back  
  
I guess I showed her how much she had to lose  
Showed her who was really who  
I know shes hurtin now  
Looks like I showed her  
  
If I could I show her how much she had to lose  
Id show her Ive been hurtin too  
If I could hold her now  
Id really show her
