Were straining at the leash  
We smell the human meat  
The only way for us to go  
The order of the pack  
Command is kill attack  
Obey the masters law  
Bad temper rules our minds  
The hunt is on this time  
We cant wait  
No way to stay alive  
The prey is finalized  
Its total genocide  
Were on the manhunt we keep on pushing  
Were on the manhunt  
Were on the manhunt we keep on pushing  
Were on the manhunt  
We train our deadly pride  
No way for man to hide  
Were always aiming for your neck  
This is your final day  
Just believe and pray  
Were feasting on your eyes  
Bad temper rules our minds  
Were on the manhunt we keep on pushing  
Were on the manhunt  
Were on the manhunt we keep on pushing  
Were on the manhunt this aint no suicide  
Were on the manhunt  
What is the victims face not us whos wrong  
The terror of the chase cant be undone  
We turned the game around not us whos wrong  
You made us go to ground cant be undone  
Were on the manhunt  
Were on the manhunt we keep on pushing  
Were on the manhunt this aint no suicide  
Were on the manhunt we keep on pushing  
Were on the manhunt try to hide no way to run
