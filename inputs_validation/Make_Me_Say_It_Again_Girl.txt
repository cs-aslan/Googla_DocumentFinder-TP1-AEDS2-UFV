Oh I believe you are an angel  
All the heaven I need to see  
Youre the promise everlasting  
Where you are I hope to be  
  
Chorus  
Make me say it again girl  
Make me say it again girl  
Make me say it again girl  
Youre all I need oh yes you are  
Youre all I need oh yes you are  
Youre all I need  
  
Whatever pains inside you make it better  
You seem to realize when Im concerned  
You are the only one who goes through the changes  
Giving my life directions when I am turned  
  
Chorus  
  
How am I worthy of love from an angel  
Princess Imperial of my soul  
Dont really matter if you choose not to answer  
Hoping what I reveal you already know  
  
Chorus
