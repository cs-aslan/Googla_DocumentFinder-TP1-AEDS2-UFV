Ill spread me open stuck to my ribs  
Are all your infants in abortion cribs  
You run like roaches and you try to die  
I know your poison in our space well lie  
To an obscene god we will dance and spit  
The skin is thin in our beds we sit  
We take off our rings and we kneel  
Our scabbed knees are so slow to heal  
Sketch a little key hole  
For lookingglass people  
I dont want to be me  
I dont want to fear no  
Mommas got a scarecrow  
Got to let the corn grow  
A man cant always reap what he sows  
Cut cut cut in pantomime mime mime  
Ill be your devil if youll admit youre mine  
Leave yourself to be ultrahere  
The chill of fall is always crawling near  
Spiders in the flowers  
Never know their smell  
The barbers here know secrets  
They will never tell  
Cut cut cut in pantomime mime mime  
Ill be your devil if youll admit youre mine
