Hush now my baby  
Be still love dont cry  
Sleep like youre rocked by the stream  
Sleep and remember  
my lullaby  
And Ill be with you when you dream  
  
Drift on a river  
that flows through my arms  
Drift as Im singing to you  
I see you smiling  
so peaceful and calm  
And holding you Im smiling too  
Here in my arms  
safe from all harm  
Holding you Im smiling too  
  
Hush now my baby  
Be still love dont cry  
Sleep like youre rocked by the stream  
Sleep and remember this river lullaby  
And Ill be with you when you dream  
Ill be with you when you dream
