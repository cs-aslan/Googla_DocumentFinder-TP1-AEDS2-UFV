I never fail to count my blessing when each day is done  
But I always wait and count you last cause youre my greatest one  
And I ask God to let me be with you till my life ends  
Cause I wanna stay here in your arms as long as I can  
  
Were gonna stay here we wanna stay here  
Were gonna stay in each others arms as long as we can  
Were gonna live with no regrets loving each other like the day we met  
And were gonna stay in each other arms as long as we can  
  
I could never ask for love no greater than you share  
To me Id find no better love if I search every place  
Youll alway be my only love just like its always been  
Cause I wanna stay here in your arms as long as I can  
  
Were gonna stay here we wanna stay here  
Were gonna stay in each others arms as long as we can  
Were gonna live with no regrets loving each other like the day we met  
And were gonna stay in each other arms as long as we can  
  
Were gonna stay in each other arms as long as we can
