It aint so much a question of not knowin what to do  
I knowed whats right an wrong since Ive been ten  
Ive heard a lot of stories and I reckon theyre true  
About how girls are put upon by men  
I know I musnt fall into the pit  
But when Im with a feller  
I ferget  
  
Im just a girl who caint say no  
Im in a terrible fix  
I always say come on lets go  
Just when I oughta say nix  
  
When a person tries to kiss a girl  
I know she oughta give his face a smack  
But as soon as someone kisses me  
I somehow sorta want to kiss him back  
  
Im just a fool when lights are low  
I caint be prissy an quaint  
I aint the type that can faint  
How can I be what I aint  
I caint say no  
  
Watcha gonna do when a feller gets flirty  
And starts to talk purty  
Whatcha gonna do  
Supposin that he says  
Your lips are like cherries  
Or roses or berries  
Whatcha gonna do  
  
Supposin that he says  
That yer sweeter than cream  
And hes gotta have cream or die  
Whatcha gonna do when he talks that way  
Spit in his eye  
  
Im just a girl who caint say no  
Caint seem to say it at all  
I hate to disserpoint a beau  
When he is payin a call  
  
Fer a while I act refined and cool  
A settin on the velveteen setee  
Then I think of that ol golden rule  
And do fer him what he would do fer me  
  
I caint resist a Romeo  
In a sombero and chaps  
Soon as I sit on their laps  
Somethin inside of me snaps  
I caint say no  
  
Im just a girl who caint say no  
Kissins my favorite food  
With or without the mistletoe  
Im in a holiday mood  
  
Other girls are coy and hard to catch  
But other girls aint havin any fun  
Every time I lose a wrastlin match  
I have a funny feeling that I won  
  
Though I can feel the undertoe  
I never make a complaint  
Till its too late for restraint  
Then when I want to I caint  
I caint say no
