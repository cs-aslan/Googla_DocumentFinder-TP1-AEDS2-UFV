Verse 1  
Never ending symptoms in my head  
We lay hollow in the emptiness  
Im too tired to push you from the bed  
  
PreChorus  
No more fighting no more fighting  
No more fighting for us  
  
Chorus  
Feel the void in our bed  
The space between is deafening  
Oh we dont bend or break it  
The space between is deafening  
The space between is deafening  
  
Verse 2  
No ones moving we lack the courage to  
We lay in stalemate wishing the other would  
But were too tired were at the embers core  
  
PreChorus  
No more fighting theres no more fighting  
Theres no more fighting for us  
  
Chorus  
Feel the void in our bed  
The space between is deafening  
Oh we dont bend or break it  
The space between is deafening  
  
Bridge  
No more fighting weve given up now  
Silence has more than worth  
Imagination cures loneliness  
When you become a prisoner  
  
Chorus  
Feel the void in our bed  
The space between is deafening  
Oh we dont bend or break it  
The space between is deafening
