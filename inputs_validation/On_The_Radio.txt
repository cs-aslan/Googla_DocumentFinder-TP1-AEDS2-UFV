On the radio  
I love the music  
On the radio  
Its what theyre playing  
When the radios on and you  
And me get crazy  
  
Hey mister on the radio  
Please play my favorite song  
The one where she didnt go away  
Hey mister on the radio  
Youre really my best friend  
Please play my favorite song for me  
Hey mister on the radio  
Youre with me every day  
  
And late at night I turn you on  
On the radio  
I love the music  
On the radio  
Its what theyre playing  
When the radios on and you  
And me get crazy  
All of the rock and roll djs  
Got their fingers on the world  
cause they play the songs  
That make you and me feel so good  
Turn up your radios  
And hear the music  
  
On the radio  
This song is playin  
When the radios on  
And you and me get crazy  
Radio DJ monologue  
  
One minute the back side of midnight its me captain gonzo  
Ready to roll hot wax anything you want to hear  
All night its a balmy 73 degrees in fog city  
71 in the valley 80 in Santa Cruz but remember if you snooze you lose  
Im gonna hang with you Ill crank it on  
So let me know what you want to hear phone lines are open now  
You say it you know Im gonna play it  
And be ready to win when I tell you to call in and whatever you do  
Remember the phrase that pays puts your brain on vacation  
And let your toes take over keep your pedal to the metal  
Ill be back in sixty seconds in the meantime go with it  
Go for it go nuts go completely wild
