On the stairs she sits and waits  
Shes crying out but nobody even cares  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Holding in the hurt and pain  
Looking for love to come pull her from this place  
Pull her from this place  
  
Im not gonna sit and stay in silence  
Im not gonna walk away in silence  
  
Sometimes were loudest when  
The doors are shut and no one can see our face  
No one can see our face  
But it seems were quiet when  
Someone needs a touch of heavens grace oh yeah  
  
Im not gonna sit and stay in silence  
Im not gonna walk away in silence  
  
We are all Gods children  
We need to count off all weve been given oh yeah  
We are all Gods children  
We need to tell off all weve been given oh yeah oh yeah  
  
Im not gonna sit and stay  
Im not gonna walk away  
  
Im not gonna sit and stay in silence  
Im not gonna walk away in silence yeah in silence  
Im not gonna walk away in silence
