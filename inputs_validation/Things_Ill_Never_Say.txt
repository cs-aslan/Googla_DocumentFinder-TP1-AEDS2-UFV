Im tugging at my hair  
Im pulling at my clothes  
Im trying to keep my cool  
I know it shows  
Im staring at my feet  
My cheeks are turning red  
Im searching for the words inside my head  
  
Cause Im feeling nervous  
Trying to be so perfect  
Cause I know youre worth it  
Youre worth it  
Yeah  
  
Chorus  
If I could say what I want to say  
Id say I want to blow you away  
Be with you every night  
Am I squeezing you too tight  
If I could say what I want to see  
I want to see you go down  
On one knee  
Marry me today  
Guess Im wishing my life away  
With these things Ill never say  
  
It dont do me any good  
Its just a waste of time  
What use is it to you  
Whats on my mind  
If aint coming out  
Were not going anywhere  
So why cant I just tell you that I care  
  
Cause Im feeling nervous  
Trying to be so perfect  
Cause I know youre worth it  
Youre worth it  
Yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Whats wrong with my tongue  
These words keep slipping away  
I stutter I stumble  
Like Ive got nothing to say  
  
Cause Im feeling nervous  
Trying to be so perfect  
Cause I know youre worth it  
Youre worth it  
Yeah  
  
Guess Im wishing my life away with these things Ill never say  
If I could say what I want to say  
Id say I want to blow you away  
Be with you every night  
  
Am I squeezing you too tight  
If I could say what I want to see  
I want to see you go down  
On one knee  
  
Marry me today  
Guess Im wishing my life away  
With these things Ill never say  
These things Ill never say
