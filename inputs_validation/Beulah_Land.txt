Beulah Land  
Got a wasted gun  
Liberation man  
Some you are  
Sometimes  
Got something in that saying  
Beulah girl  
You better hitch me up  
  
Got some candy  
And sweet saying  
Give me religion  
And a lobotomy  
Beulah land  
Beautiful home  
Tell me when  
I dont need you anymore  
  
Said that somewhere  
Youre gonna get something  
Youre so  
Youre right in the middle  
And then Im you  
Something is coming back again  
I said  
You  
Maybe I dont want to go  
To where youre not  
  
So  
Beulah land  
Gonna find me a warm  
Place to bathe  
This body on down  
Got a rubber boat  
And a crocodile  
Gonna float on past your home  
  
And say when  
Just say when  
Just say when
