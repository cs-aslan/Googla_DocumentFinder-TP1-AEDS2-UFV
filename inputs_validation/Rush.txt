I kissed your sweet lips  
I floated so high  
Your eyes looked at mine  
The world froze in time  
What is this feeling  
I am on cloud nine  
Guess  
Im still reeling  
From your body  
Next to mine  
  
Its a rush  
I cant explain  
Like you shot  
Something crazy  
Into my veins  
And Im ten feet  
Off the ground  
And I dont want  
To come down  
Dont want  
To come down  
  
I know  
Youre sleeping  
I wish you  
Were right here  
Cause my beds so empty  
Id hold you so close dear  
And I sang my song to you  
Your smile was priceless  
What else can I do  
  
Im a junkie over you  
  
Its a rush  
I cant explain  
Like you shot something  
Crazy into my veins  
And Im ten feet  
Off the ground  
And I dont want  
To come down  
  
Is it me  
Or is everything spinning  
Im wide awake  
But I must be dreaming  
Its like  
Youre some kind of drug  
Try to catch my breath  
And see  
If Im still breathing  
Touch my heart  
And make sure  
Its beating  
Its like  
Im falling in love  
  
Its a rush  
I cant explain  
Like you shot  
Something crazy  
Into my veins  
And Im ten feet  
Off the ground  
And I dont  
No I dont  
No  
Dont want  
To come down  
Dont want  
To come down  
Gonna come down
