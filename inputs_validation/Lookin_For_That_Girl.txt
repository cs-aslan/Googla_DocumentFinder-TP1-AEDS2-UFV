That girl shes a party all nighter  
Little Funky Cold Medina  
Little Strawberry Winer  
That girl shes a love gone stringer  
Me a year old bum country singer  
That girl shes the walk on the wild side  
Shes the day glory snow ride

If you see her tell her Im lookin for  
That girl that girl that girl  
Hard to find Ill be spending every night  
Lookin for that girl that girl that girl  
  
Sun down heaven town  
Drivin round hittin the bars  
Shooting the stars  
Rollin up on every party

Lookin for that girl that girl that girl  
Driving me crazy  
Something says baby yeah

That girl shes a sugarsweet drive by  
Hold my dreams in her blue jeans oh my  
Yellow hammer south Georgia  
Mississippi chick  
Drink cherry wine  
Louisiana lipstick  
  
That girl likes to drink it up real loud  
Blowing smoke in a back broke rebel cloud  
Drop it down summer heat  
I gotta seat up high silver rebel seat  
  
Waiting for that girl that girl that girl  
Hard to find  
Got me spending every night

Shooting the stars  
Rollin up on every party

Lookin for that girl that girl that girl  
Driving me crazy  
Something says baby yeah

Hair like a field of corn  
Body like a honey comb  
Smile like a country song
