Mama was the one who reached down and tied my shoelace  
Mama spit on her fingers and used it to clean dirt off my face  
  
Brush your teeth qtip your ear

Mama always calmed down dad when he got too mean  
Like the time he almost hit me for stealing his juggs magazine  
  
Stop your jumping  
Youll break the bed  
Dont you fill up  
On the bread

Take those  
trying to read cue card  
Take Carrots out of your nose  
Thats not a hat thats pantyhose  
Dont play baseball in your suit

Dont forget vicks vaporrub  
Stop masturbating in the tub  
Thanks for making corn beef hash
