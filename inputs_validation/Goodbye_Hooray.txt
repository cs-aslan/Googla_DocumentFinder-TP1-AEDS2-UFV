Wooh wooh ha  
  
Junior paints that old cafe  
Hes gotta chase those girls around  
Westbound drunk with lots to say  
But he never makes a sound  
  
Hustlers get what they deserve  
But its always half the game  
Good things come to those who wait  
Like an expiration date  
  
See you around Ill see you around  
Ill play all night hey dont get uptight  
Ill lead all your mind games astray  
Well Ill see you around Ill see you around  
Ill play all night hey dont get uptight  
See you so long goodbye hooray  
Oh oh  
  
Curb your tongue oh scallywag  
Because you got no flag to wave  
Save your breath for the black and white  
Every dog will have its day  
  
See you around Ill see you around  
Ill play all night hey dont get uptight  
Ill lead all your mind games astray  
Well Ill see you around Ill see you around  
Well Ill play all night hey get on top  
See you so long goodbye hooray  
Well Ill see you around Ill see you around  
  
Aw yeah  
Aw yeah  
Aw yeah  
  
Ill see you around Ill see you around  
Ill play all night hey dont get uptight  
Ill lead all your mind games astray  
Well Ill see you around Ill see you around  
Ill play all night hey dont get uptight  
See you so long goodbye hooray  
  
Well Ill see you around Ill see you around  
Ill see you around Ill see you around  
Ill see you around  
Goodbye and hooray  
Well Ill see you around Ill see you around  
Oh no no no no
