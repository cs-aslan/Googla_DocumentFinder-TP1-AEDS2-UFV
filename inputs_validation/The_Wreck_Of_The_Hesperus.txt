Well hoist a hand becalmed upon a troubled sea  
Make haste to your funeral  cries the Valkyrie  
Well hoist a hand or drown amidst this stormy sea  
Here lies a coffin  cries the cemetery it calls to me  
And all for nothing quite in vain was hope forever tossed  
No thoughts explained no moments gained no hope forever lost  
One moments space one moments final fall from grace  
Burnt by fire blind in sight lost in ire  
  
Well hoist a hand becalmed upon a troubled sea  
I fear a mighty wave is threatening me  
Well hoist a hand or drown amidst this stormy sea  
Come follow after  cry the humble You will surely see  
But still for nothing quite in vain was hope forever tossed  
No moments gained no thoughts explained no hope forever lost  
One moments space one moments final fall from grace  
Burnt by fire blind in sight lost in ire
