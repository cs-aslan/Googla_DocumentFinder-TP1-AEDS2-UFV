There may be trouble ahead  
But while theres music and moonlight and love and romance  
Lets face the music and dance  
Before the fiddlers have fled  
Before they ask us to pay the bill and while we still have the chance  
Lets face the music and dance  
Soon well be without the moon humming a different tune and then  
There may be teardrops to shed  
So while theres moonlight and music and love and romance  
Lets face the music and dance
