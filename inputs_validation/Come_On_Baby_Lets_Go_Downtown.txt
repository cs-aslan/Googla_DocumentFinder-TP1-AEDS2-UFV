Come on baby lets go downtown  
Lets go lets go  
Lets go downtown  
Come on baby lets go downtown  
Lets go lets go  
Lets go downtown  
  
Walk on talk on  
Baby tell no lies  
Dont you be caught  
With a tear in your eye  
  
Sure enough  
Theyll be sellin stuff  
When the moon begins to rise  
Pretty bad when  
Youre dealin with the man  
And the light shines in your eyes  
  
Come on baby lets go downtown  
Lets go lets go  
Lets go downtown  
Come on baby lets go downtown  
Lets go lets go  
Lets go downtown  
  
Snake eyes French fries  
And I got lots of gas  
Full moon and a jumpin tune  
Now you dont have to ask  
  
Sure enough  
Theyll be sellin stuff  
When the moon begins to rise  
Pretty bad when  
Youre dealin with the man  
And the light shines in your eyes  
  
Come on baby lets go downtown  
Lets go lets go  
Lets go downtown  
Come on baby lets go downtown  
Lets go lets go  
Lets go downtown  
  
Walk on talk on  
Baby tell no lies  
Dont you be caught  
With a tear in your eye  
  
Sure enough  
Theyll be sellin stuff  
When the moon begins to rise  
Pretty bad when  
Youre dealin with the man  
And the light shines in your eyes  
  
Pretty bad when  
Youre dealin with the man  
And the light shines in your eyes
