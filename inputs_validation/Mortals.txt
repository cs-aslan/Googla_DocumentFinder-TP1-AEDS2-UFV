Hear me mortals  
Or Ill condem you to that shit and puke  
You were destined to lounge in  
Youll work the blood fields  
Sail the semen seas  
Feelings of pain and fear  
Mortal man  animal  prepare to feel hot  
See me mortals  
In nightmares eat your mind  
Amongst endless screaming drones  
Regurgitating bones to plant  
And water with your tears  
Mortal man  animal  prepare to feel hot  
Fear me mortals  
Or your mind and guts will explode  
In your very own sickly self  
Youll haunt the realms of purgatory  
Dying off pain and fear  
Mortal man  animal  prepare to feel hot
