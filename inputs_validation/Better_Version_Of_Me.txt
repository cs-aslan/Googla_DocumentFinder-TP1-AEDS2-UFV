The nickel dropped when I was on  
My way beyond the Rubicon  
What did I do  
And the games that I could handle  
  
And then the ones with a candle  
What can I do  
Im a frightened fickle person  
Fighting cryin kickin cursin  
  
What should I do  
Oooh after all the folderol  
And hauling over coal stops  
What will I do  
  
Cant take a good day without a bad one  
Dont feel just to smile until I had one  
Where did I learn  
I make a fuss about a little thing  
  
The rhyme is losing to the riddling  
Wheres the turn  
I dont want a home  
I go into habits where my habits have a habitat  
  
Why did it turn  
Oooh after all the folderol  
And hauling over coal stops  
What did I learn  
  
I am likely to miss the main event  
If I stop to cry and complain again  
So I will keep a deliberate pace  
Let the damn breeze dry my face  
  
Ooh mister wait until you see  
What I plan to be  
Ive got a plan to demand and it just began  
And if youre right youll agree  
  
Heres coming a better version of me  
Heres coming a better version of me  
Here comes a better version of me
