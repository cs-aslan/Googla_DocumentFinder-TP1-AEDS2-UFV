Last round  
Looks like Im in for a fight  
Knocked down  
There is nowhere left to hide  
Stick n move  
When I try to run away  
Old onetwo  
I only end up face to face  
  
Mirror mirror getting clearer  
Its just me and my shadow  
Dancing round the ring  
I try to fight it  
But then how can I win  
When Im only shadow boxing  
  
Time out  
Im looking for a  
Standing eight  
No doubt  
My inside has come out to play  
Bob n weave  
Its conscious of my  
Every move  
Been deceived  
Can no longer ignore the truth  
  
Mirror mirror getting clearer  
Split decision blur my vision
