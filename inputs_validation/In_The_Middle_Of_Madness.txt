instrumental intro  
Dont you really love her dont you really care  
Youve been looking forever how did she get you there  
In the middle of madness when all has gone  
In the middle of madness she walks she breathes babylon  
Isnt she so pretty isnt she so fine  
Havent you been blessed to hold her all the time  
In the middle of madness when all has gone  
In the middle of madness she walks she breathes babylon  
cant figure out this part  
instrumental  
Have you found a heaven try to see the worth  
Looking at the future shes right here on earth  
In the middle of madness when all has gone  
In the middle of madness she walks she breathes babylon  
In the middle of madness when all has gone  
In the middle of madness she walks she breathes babylon  
fade out
