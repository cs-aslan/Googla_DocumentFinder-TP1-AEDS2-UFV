Choices that we make in life  
May take us far  
Chances that we take tonight  
May lead us into darken places  
But at the end of Godly choices  
Are higher dreams  
But in the game of chance  
Theres only a guilty wave or stream  
Sometimes I dont know which road I should take  
Sometimes I dont know which move I should make  
But its only if God says yes  
Ill make my move  
And its only if God says yes  
Then I will choose  
For its only if God would just  
Bow his head  
Then I will do it  
Thats what I will do  
I started down the right road  
Only to end up wrong  
The endless journey carried me so far away  
From my home and family  
But Im learning I was never meant to go alone  
Neither was it meant for me to go on my own no  
Sometimes I dont know which road I should take  
Sometimes I dont know which move I should make  
Ill never go on my own  
Ill never go all alone  
Sometimes I dont know which road I should take  
Sometimes I dont know which move I should make  
But its only if God says yes  
Ill make my move  
For its only if God says yes  
Then I will choose  
For its only if God would just answer me  
And its only if God would just hear my plead  
And its only if God would just bow his head  
Then I will do it  
Thats what I will do  
Thats what I will do
