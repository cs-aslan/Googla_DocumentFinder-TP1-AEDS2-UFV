My shoes are heavy  
My feet are winding down  
I look for her in corners  
But shes not around  
What I eat is eating me  
It hits me hard  
Im one jack short of a royal flush  
A stranger holds the card  
Here come the salvation in the shape of my guitar  
And Im gonna ride it like a shooting star  
  
I dont want your money  
I dont want your soul  
I dont need a reason  
I just want to get right down and lick it up  
  
Mother Mercy told me  
A picture never lies  
She told me no self respecting hero ever cries  
The prisoner walks in circles  
The victim walks alone  
Scissors cut the paper  
The paper wraps the stone  
Standing at the entrance to the gates of paradise  
The lights go down the heat goes up thats when I cry  
  
I dont want your money  
I dont want your soul  
I dont a reason  
I just want to get right down and lick it up  
  
I put my faith in fortune reaching for the sky  
The only game in town that gets me high  
  
I dont want your money  
I just want to get right down and lick it up  
I dont want your soul  
I just want to get right down and lick it up  
I dont need a reason  
I just want to get right down and lick it up
