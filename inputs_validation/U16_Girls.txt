I met a girl in LA  
The million dollar kind  
She was all for all or nothing  
She was open all the time  
  
But when I called her number  
Her mothers on the line sayin  
Youve no business  
As gods my witness  
  
With a child as young as mine  
So make sure that shes old enough  
Before you blow your mind  
She may look like she knows enough  
  
But look in her eye  
And if so  
Let her go  
Youll let her down in style  
  
I met a girl in paris  
She talked like vera lynn  
And her eyes were full of dew drop  
The moment I walked in  
  
She was awfully nice  
The kind that likes to win  
But if Id been wiser  
A whole lot wiser  
  
Then I might have thought again
