I was told about a second chance  
Now I know thats not a rule in a game called romance  
I was fooling around  
Foolin around  
  
we lie and we cheat  
Desire indeed  
I knew where this would lead us to when I  
Was fooling around  
I was fooling around  
Foolin around  
  
No more  
No more sweet music  
Just straight tell me straight  
If you got to do what you got to do  
No more  
No more sweet music  
Just straight tell me straight  
  
We know there is no happy end  
But still Im tempted every time  
Were fooling around  
Foolin around  
We are fooling around  
Foolin around  
  
Now we know there is no second chance  
In this lost game of romance  
Too much fooling around  
Foolin around  
Too much fooling around  
Foolin around  
  
No more  
No more sweet music  
Just straight tell me straight  
If you got to do what you got to do  
No more  
No more sweet music  
Just straight tell me straight  
  
If you got to do what you got to do  
Know there is no second chance  
If you got to do what you got to do  
Not in this game called romance  
If you got to do what you got to do  
There wont be a happy end  
If you got to do what you got to do  
Know that there wasnt and wont be a chance  
  
No more  
No more sweet music  
Just straight tell me straight  
If you got to do what you got to do  
No more  
No more sweet music  
Just straight tell me straight
