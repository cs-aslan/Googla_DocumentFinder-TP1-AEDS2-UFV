In the cul de sac so smooth  
I look down  
Be less sure sir  
And take your rest  
  
Its been much too long  
Since we drifted in song  
Lay it down wet  
In this hideaway  
  
Oh I traveled far  
To the nearest star  
And met Palomar mar mar  
And we dont care just who you know  
Its who you are  
And when they all go home  
Down the cobblestones  
You can double back spoken This is it  
To a cul de sac  
Mmm  
  
Oh I traveled far  
The nearest star  
And Mount Palomar Palomar Palomar Palomar  
And we dont care just who dyou know who dyou know  
And who you really are really are  
  
And when they all  
All go home  
Down the cobblestones  
You will double back  
To a cul de sac  
You know you know you will  
You will oh will double back  
And not very far  
To a cul de sac  
You you you will double back  
To a cul de sac  
You know you know its not very far away  
No no  
Its just a cul de sac  
  
And you know and you know and you know its not very very far away  
No  
Its just a cul de sac  
Donn donn donn  
Youre not very far away no oh  
Its not its not very far away  
Its not as far as a country mile  
You got it  
Its just a cul de sac
