You got your book baby with all your fears  
Let me honey and Ill catch your tears  
Ill take your sorrow if you want me to  
Come tomorrow  
Thats what Ill do  
Listen to me  
Janey dont you lose heart  
Janey dont you lose heart  
Janey dont you lose heart  
Janey dont you lose heart  
Well you say you got no new dreams to touch  
You feel like a stranger babe who knows too much  
You come home late and get undressed  
You lie in bed and feel this emptiness  
Well listen to me  
Janey dont you lose heart  
Janey dont you lose heart  
Janey dont you lose heart  
Janey dont you lose heart  
Till every river it runs dry  
Until the suns torn from the sky  
Till every feel youve felt burst free  
Gone tumblin down into the sea  
Listen to me  
Janey dont you lose heart  
Janey dont you lose heart  
Janey dont you lose heart  
Janey dont you lose heart
