The sun goes down and leaves me sad and blue  
Even another night of this cold war with you  
Though you wont speak and I wont speak its true  
Two stubborn people with a cold war to go through  
Oh why oh why should love ever come  
To a couple like you and me  
Whos cold cold wars are never done  
And hearts just cant be free  
So lets do right  
Or lets just say were through  
I just cant stand  
Another cold cold war with you  
The sun goes down and leaves me sad and blue  
Even another night of this cold war with you  
Though you wont speak and I wont speak its true  
Two stubborn people with a cold war to go through  
Oh why oh why should love ever come  
To a couple like you and me  
Whos cold cold wars are never done  
And hearts just cant be free  
So lets do right  
Or lets just say were through  
I just cant stand  
Another cold cold war with you
