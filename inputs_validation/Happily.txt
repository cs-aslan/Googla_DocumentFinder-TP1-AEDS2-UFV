You dont understand you dont understand  
What you do to me when you hold his hand  
We were meant to be but a twist of fate  
Made it so you had to walk away  
  
Cause were on fire  
We are on fire  
Were on fire now  
Yeah were on fire  
We are on fire  
Were on fire now  
  
I dont care what people say when were together  
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep  
I just want it to be you and I forever  
I know you wanna leave  
So cmon baby be with me  
So happily  
  
Its four am and I know that youre with him  
I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin  
And if he feels my traces in your hair  
Sorry love but I dont really care  
  
Cause were on fire  
We are on fire  
Were on fire now  
Yeah were on fire  
We are on fire  
Were on fire now  
  
I dont care what people say when were together  
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep  
I just want it to be you and I forever  
I know you wanna leave  
So cmon baby be with me  
So happily  
  
So happily  
One two three four  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Were on fire now  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Were on fire now were on fire  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Were on fire now  
  
I dont care what people say when were together  
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep  
I just want it to be you and I forever  
I know you wanna leave  
So cmon baby be with me  
So happily  
  
I dont care what people say when were together  
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep  
I just want it to be you and I forever  
I know you wanna leave  
So cmon baby be with me  
So happily
