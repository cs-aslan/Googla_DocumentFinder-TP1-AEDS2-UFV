Words and music by Bob Seger  
Beside of Like A Rock and on the soundtrack to the movie About Last Night  
When the sun came up this morning  
And she smiled her smile for me  
I felt it for the first time  
Something deep inside of me  
So you can take your midnight ramblin boys  
And you can keep your winding roads  
Shes livin inside my heart now  
Livin inside  
Oh theres an easiness about her  
Theres a softness in her way  
But she gets me through the hard times  
We get closer everyday  
I know Ill never be alone now boys  
Cause even if Im far away  
Shes livin inside my heart now  
Livin inside  
Yeah  
And I dont know what I did to deserve her  
But Ill tell you this my friend  
Im never gonna lose her  
Never gonna lose her  
Cause every night  
Shes livin inside my heart now  
Livin inside
