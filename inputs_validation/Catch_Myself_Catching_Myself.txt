This time I am falling further away  
Nothing has changed  
Nothing has changed like I said it would  
Faster towards the ground  
Thats where they wait where they wait for me  
And enter my veins  
Feel them crawling through my skin  
Collecting my nerves  
That they feed to their children  
I swear it has to stop  
Cause there is nothing left to give  
Nothing left to give  
  
Ill be the victor  
I will destroy them  
  
I wanna watch them burn it down  
So I can breathe again  
  
Inhale cause after tonight  
I wont be the same  
Exhale Exhale and find my feet  
On the ground  
  
Im not the same anymore  
Im not the same anymore  
  
As I sink down into the floor  
And the walls are caving in  
And I dont believe in them anymore  
Now I try to balance my walk  
I am coming down alone  
And I have to get them out of my head  
  
I wanna watch them burn it down  
So I can breathe again  
I wanna watch them burn it down  
So I can breathe again  
  
One breath at a time Ill be just fine  
Cause Ill be right on the inside  
I steady my hands inside of my shell  
And I wait till their backs are turned  
Oh inside of my head  
Where they thought they would win  
But I got them right where I want them  
Pushed to either side  
Im burning them alive  
I hear them begging and pleading
