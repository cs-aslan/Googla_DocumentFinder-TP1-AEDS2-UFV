I feel responsibility to hate what I cant eat  
A sack full of hissin snakes laying at my feet  
I see colors that dont exist feel pain that isnt mine  
Gone from dirt to mud  
Gone from mud to slime  
  
When youre ready To come home  
When youve had enough  
  
When youre standing all alone  
Ya know Ill be waiting here  
  
Theres pride in what you call yourself but then whats in a name  
I feel responsibility to hate and pass the blame  
Know you no security theyll beat you with a stick  
I feel responsibility to hate what makes me sick  
  
I know youre standing All alone  
Yeah Im still waiting here  
  
They eat their young They eat their young  
Without question  
They eat their young They eat their young  
Cant be done all by myself send help  
  
I feel responsibility to hate what I cant eat  
An I feel no security just standin on my feet  
I see colors that dont exist feel pain an its all mine  
Gone from dirt to mud  
Livin in the slime  
  
When youre ready To come home  
I know you had enough  
When youre standing All alone  
Ya know Im still waiting here  
  
They eat their young
