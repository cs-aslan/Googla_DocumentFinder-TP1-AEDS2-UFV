I used to live but now I survive  
I used to believe but now its just one day at a time  
The circus is gone its all packed away  
The clowns hat the makeups been packed in his case  
So we wave goodbye to Miss Fourth of July  
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns  
Dont say we never tried Miss Fourth of July  
The stars that we reached for left us with nothing but dawn  
I used to laugh but Ive learned to cry  
And I aint too proud to let you see tears fall from these eyes  
For all of my hopes my heartaches and fears  
For a night I just watched and you walked out of here  
I just waved goodbye to Miss Fourth of July  
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns  
Dont say we never tried Miss Fourth of July  
The crown that we reached for left us with nothing  
But your thorns left me wounded not unlike the truth  
When innocence sang his last song  
Hed tell me that its all gone  
Just look me in the eyes and say it meant nothing at all  
I used to live Ive learned to die  
And I used to dream I used to dream  
So now we wave goodbye to Miss Fourth of July  
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns  
Dont say weve never tried Miss Fourth of July  
The stars that we reached for theyve left us with nothing but dawn  
Oh yeah  
Nothing but a heavy hit of heartbreak  
A handful of blues  
Oh yeah  
Ill never get off these
