I wont let anyone hurt you  
And Ill stop them if they try to  
Nobody knows you like I do baby  
And I dont care where you run to  
Because Im gonna find you  
  
When the stars all align  
We can try again  
  
Is anybody out there  
Can anybody see  
Seems like everythings gone crazy  
Youre exactly what I wanted  
And exactly what I need  
Dont need anybody but my baby  
  
So where did all your love go  
You play me like a solo  
Then you threw my broken heart away yeah  
  
I know that we can make it  
And I know that you can feel me  
So stop fooling around and just stay  
  
Is anybody out there  
Can anybody see  
Seems like everythings gone crazy  
Youre exactly what I wanted  
Exactly what I need  
I dont need anybody but my baby  
  
Its taken such a long time  
To find what Ive been looking for  
And now that you are all mine  
I never felt quite like this before  
Still want more  
All you need in my mind  
Because if so then you already know  
Youre all that I want and youre all that I needed  
  
Is anybody out there  
Can anybody see  
Seems like everythings gone crazy  
Youre exactly what I wanted  
And exactly what I need  
Dont need anybody but my baby
