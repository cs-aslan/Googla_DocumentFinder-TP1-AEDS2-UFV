Doo ooh doo ooh doo ooh doo ooh  
Doo ooh doo ooh doo ooh doo ooh  
  
My ears getting tired of listening all the time  
Theyve been talking lots of garbage all their lives  
And suddenly they decided to ring one back  
Ringring ringring my ears are ringing like a warning  
  
My eyes getting tired of looking all the time  
Theyve been talking a lot of winking all their lives  
And finally they decided to flash one back  
Flashflash flashflash my eyes are flashing like a warning  
  
My nose is getting tired of sniffing all the time  
Shes been taking Memphis blues all her life  
And surely she decided to sneeze one back  
Sneezesneeze sneezesneeze my nose is sneezing like a warning  
  
My bodys getting tired of taking all the time  
Shes been taking lot of cornballs all her life  
Suddenly she decided to hit one back  
Bangbang bangbang she hits back like a warning  
  
She hits back like a warning  
Ringring flashflash  
Sneezesneeze bangbang  
She hits back like a warning  
  
Shes gonna hit back  
Yeah  
Shes gonna kick back  
Yeah  
You wont know what hit you  
Till you see her flashing  
Yeah  
  
Shes gonna hit back  
Yeah  
Shes gonna kick back  
Yeah  
You wont know what hit you  
Till you see her head flashing  
Yeah yeah
