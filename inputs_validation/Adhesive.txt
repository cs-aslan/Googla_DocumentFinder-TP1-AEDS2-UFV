My friend Blue he runs the show with hot pink purple china glow  
His family trees are molded no longer grows in summer  
He holds it closer lets it go Picks a fruit but keeps it whole  
Cant keep the submarine Cant keep the light from fading  
  
Grab the hate and drown it out  
Grab the beat and drum it out  
Its all so confusing  
  
Aint the same for you and me Cartoons like reality  
Dogs and cats and children The deepest wound is hidden  
Aint the same for you and me Comatose commodity  
The superheroes dyin All the children cryin  
  
Sell more records if Im dead Purple flowers once again  
Hope its sooner hope its near corporate records fiscal year  
  
Down the river  
  
Have a listen lend an ear  
Heres a song now if you care  
We can all just hum along  
Words dont matter anymore  
Grab the hate and drown it out  
Grab the beat and drum it out  
Its all so confusing  
  
Adhesive love Adhesive  
  
Flyin high across the plain  
Purple flowers ease the pain  
Here now have a listen  
Aint the songs youre missin  
Down the river  
Down the river  
  
Stitch the womb and wet the bed  
With a whisper Ill be dead  
Dont let the living die yet  
Grab the hate and drown it out  
Grab the beat and drum it out  
Its all so confusing  
  
Adhesive love Adhesive
