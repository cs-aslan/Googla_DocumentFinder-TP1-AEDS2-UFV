When I was just a child  
My folks would drive me wild  
Theyd spy upon my every move  
Until it drove me to despair  
They told me what to wear  
They told me not to cut my hair  
But thats all over now  
I had to tell them anyhow  
  
Its my affair  
Where I go and what I do  
Its my affair oh yeah  
Its my affair  
Its up to me and not to you  
Its my affair  
  
Thats the way I want to keep it  
I kissed the boy in secret  
Thrilled me to the very core  
I couldnt stop I wanted more and  
I didnt hear the door and  
They caught me on the floor  
With my affair  
  
And when we first got wed  
We used to stay in bed  
All day and night all night and day  
We bedded half our lives away  
But thats all over now  
We move in higher circles  
Chomping through the upper crust  
I couldnt see you for the dust  
And then you met that girl  
Who left you with your money spent  
And now its no concern of yours  
If I sleep with the President  
  
Its my affair  
And if I dont come home tonight  
Its my affair alright  
Its my affair  
Who I see is up to me  
Its my affair  
  
Thats how I want to keep it  
I kiss the boys in secret  
Hiding in the parking lot  
Is just as far as I have got but  
If the phone should ring and  
Theres no one there  
Then its my affair  
  
Eso es asunto de ella  
Donde va why lo que hare  
  
Well its all over now  
Youve seen the last of me  
And I dont have to put up with you  
Giving me the third degree  
So you go on your way  
And dont come sneaking round the back door  
Trying to get yourself
