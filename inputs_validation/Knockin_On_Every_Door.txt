Hey now honey  
You got to face the floor  
You headed for the heart  
But you couldnt find the door could you

But Im living in the rain  
I got to get awhirlin like a human hurricane over you  
Over you

And youre faster than a shot from a gun  
Im pointing at you oh you

You keep on knockin on every door  
Keep keep knock knockin on every door  
You keep on knockin on every door  
  
Hey now honey  
Time is all youve spent  
You moved into the bed  
But you couldnt pay the rent could you  
Could you  
  
In the twinkle of an eye  
You electrify  
I got to get ashootin like a rocket in the sky bye bye  
Goodbye  
  
Now youre burning like youre hot on the scene  
Dont you love to steal a part of my dream  
Im looking at you oh you
