Ive got the dynamo of volition  
With popole position  
Automatic transmission with loow emissions  
Im a brand new addition to the old edition  
With the love unconditional  
  
Im a drama abolitionist  
Damn no opposition to my proposition  
Half of a man half magician  
Half a politician holding the mic  
Like ammunition  
And my vision is as simple as light  
  
Aint no reason we should be in a fight  
No demolition  
Get to vote get to say what you like  
Procreation  
Compositions already written by themselves  
Saying heck is for the people not believin in gosh  
  
Chorus  
Good Job  
Get em up way high  
Gimme gimme that high five  
Good time  
Get em way down low  
Gimme gimme that low dough  
Good God  
Bring em back again  
Gimme gimme that high ten  
  
Youre the best definition of good intentions  
  
I do not answer the call if  
I do not know who is calling  
I guess the whole point of it all is  
That we never know really  
  
Im tryin to keep with the Joneses  
While waiting for guns and the roses  
To finish what we all suppose is  
That shits so silly  
  
Oh fist like pumpin and wrist lock  
Twisting up a rizla  
Kid Icarus on the transistor  
Nintendo been givin me the blister  
I bend over take it in the kisser  
  
Best friends are hittin on my sister  
Try to tell them that they still wisha  
Cause she already got herself a mister  
And besides thats gross to want to dis her  
Didnt I say didnt I say  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre a representation of good versus evil  
  
I do not keep up with statistics  
I do not sleep without a mistress  
I do not eat unless its fixed with  
Some kind of sweet like a licorice  
My home is deep inside the mystics  
Im known to keep diggin on existence  
Im holdin in the heat like a fishstick  
And my phone it beeps because I missed it  
  
I do not answer the phone if  
I do not know who is calling  
I guess the whole point of it all is  
Fucks sake can I get a witness  
  
Im only a boy in a story  
Just a hallucinatory  
Trippin on nothing there is  
Living in the wilderness  
  
With a tiger spot on my back  
Living life of a cat  
I just wanna relax here  
And sing another rap tune  
Driving off on your blind mans bike  
You can say just what you like  
Or nothing can stop you  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre the best definition of good versus evil  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre a representation of good intention  
Youre the best definition of good intention  
  
Repeat x3  
Youre the best around  
And nothings ever gonna take you down  
  
Youre the best around
