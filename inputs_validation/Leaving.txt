Watching the clock on the wall  
Been a while since you called  
I cant help but wait  
Its late and I cant get no sleep  
Somethings different this time  
It just doesnt feel right  
Have we broken in two  
Am I really gonna lose you tonight  
You come walking in  
Tears in your eyes  
Pretending like its alright  
  
But I know youre leaving  
I know that smile  
I can tell youve been crying  
Youre gonna say goodbye  
I wish I could stop you  
But youve made up your mind  
I beg you dont go  
But I already know youre leaving  
  
Where does the time go  
Between goodbye and hello  
How did we come to this is there something we missed  
Along the way  
With your bags at the door  
I wanna pull you in close  
And hold you once more even though  
  
But I know youre leaving  
I know that smile  
I can tell youve been crying  
Youre gonna say goodbye  
I wish I could stop you  
But youve made up your mind  
I beg you dont go  
But I already know youre leaving  
  
Here come the sleepless nights  
Here come the tears Im gonna cry  
Here comes the last goodbye leaving us behind  
Oh this cant be right  
  
But I know youre leaving  
I know that smile  
I can tell youve been crying  
Youre gonna say goodbye  
I wish I could stop you  
But youve made up your mind  
I beg you dont go  
But I already know youre leaving
