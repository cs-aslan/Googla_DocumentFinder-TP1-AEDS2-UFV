Well it wont be long now  
Til that ol sun goes down  
And darkness helps me hide my shameful tears  
My wife works all night long  
For a man whos halfway gone  
Shes the barmaid in the honkytonk downstairs  
  
Its a shame she wears the name  
Of a man whos locked and chained  
To a bottle thats destroyin all hopes and cares  
To the men with hungry eyes  
She works and hides her pride  
Shes the barmaid in the honkytonk downstairs  
  
Its a shame she wears the name  
Of a man whos locked and chained  
To a bottle thats destroyin all hopes and cares  
To the men with hungry eyes  
She works and hides her pride  
Shes the barmaid in the honkytonk downstairs
