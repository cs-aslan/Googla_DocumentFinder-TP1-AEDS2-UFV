I dont buy what I make dont give but I take it from  
You  
Well the most that I want is all youve got and thats  
True  
I can help you along with a smile and a song oh yeah  
But youre out on your own and you aint gonna get  
Nowhere  
  
Chorus  
Are you man enough are you man enough  
Are you man enough for me  
Are you man enough are you man enough  
Are you man enough for me  
  
Sweet smell of success sure got you into a mess  
But the smoke in your eyes dont tell you no lies  
Now its plain to see that were gonna stay number one  
It aint just for money no you know that we do it for  
Fun  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus to fade
