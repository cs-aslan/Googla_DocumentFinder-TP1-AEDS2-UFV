Ive flown around the world in a plane  
Ive settled revolutions in Spain  
The North Pole I have charted  
But cant get started with you  
  
Around the golf course Im under par  
And all the movies want me to star  
Ive got a house a show place  
But I get no place with you  
  
Youre so supreme lyrics I write of you  
scheme just for a sign of you  
dream both day and night of you  
and what good does it do  
  
In nineteen twenty nine I sold short  
In England Im presented at court  
But you got me so downhearted  
Because I cant get started with you  
  
Youre so supreme lyrics I write of you  
scheme just for a sign of you  
dream both day and night of you  
and what good does it do  
  
In nineteen twenty nine I sold short  
In England Im presented at court  
But you got me so downhearted  
Because I cant get started with you
