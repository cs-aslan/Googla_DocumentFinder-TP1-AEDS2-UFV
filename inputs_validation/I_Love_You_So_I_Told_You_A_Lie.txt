Every time I hear your name you know  
I wonder why you wanted to go  
I said no you couldnt come along for the ride  
I said hey I want outta here and nobody taggin behind  
  
Chorus  
Dont cha know I love you so I told you a lie  
I love you so I told you a lie when I told you goodbye  
  
A family life and a lovin wife just aint my kinda scene  
Well when Im all alone when the nights are cold  
I get to thinkin I was kinda mean  
We coulda had a good thing but I never wanted to try  
  
Chorus  
  
You know I told you a lie  
  
ah ah ah ah ah  
Ut ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah ah  
Ut ah ah ah ah  
  
A family life and a lovin wife just aint my kinda scene  
Well when Im all alone when the nights are cold  
I get to thinkin I was kinda mean  
We coulda had a good thing but I never wanted to try  
  
Chorus  
  
You know I told you a lie when I told you goodbye  
  
Dontcha know I love you so I  
Dontcha know I love you so I told you  
Dontcha know I love you so I told you a lie  
Love you so I told you a lie  
I loved you so I told you a lie  
I loved you so I told you a lie  
Loved you so loved you so  
Ah  
Loved you so I told you a lie  
Ah  
Loved you so I told you a lie
