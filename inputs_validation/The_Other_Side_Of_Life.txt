The atmosphere  
On the streets tonight  
Is the driving beat  
Of the world  
  
The word down here  
On the streets tonight  
Is the truest music  
Youve heard  
  
So take your share  
Of the gifts that are there  
They all belong to you  
And come what may  
At the break of each day  
We all begin anew once more  
  
We all begin anew  
  
Chorus  
Baby baby baby  
Lets investigate  
The other side of life tonight  
The lovers and the fighters  
And the risks they take  
Are on the other side of life tonight  
Lets lose our way  
Go completely astray  
And find ourselves again  
You know the only way to get there  
Is to take that step  
To the other side of life tonight  
  
The atmosphere  
On the streets tonight  
Is the driving beat  
Of the world  
The word down here  
On the streets tonight  
Is the truest music  
Youve heard  
  
So take your share  
Of the gifts that are there  
They all belong to you  
And come what may  
At the break of each day  
We all begin anew once more  
We all begin anew  
  
Chorus  
  
Lets lose our way  
Go completely astray  
And find ourselves again  
You know the only way to get there  
Is to take that step  
To the other side of life tonight
