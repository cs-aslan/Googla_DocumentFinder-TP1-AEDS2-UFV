Im a Ladys Man Oh yessiree  
I like the gals and the gals like me  
Can I make em swoon Oh yes I can  
Dont know what it is about me they love  
But what it is I got plenty of  
Make way for me Im a lovin Ladys Man  
  
Im a Ladys Man and thats no crime  
I like em round me all of the time  
Ive got a line of talk they understand  
Now you may like a baseball game  
But as for me thats much too tame  
I get my thrill just bein a Ladys Man  
  
Been a Ladys Man since I was three  
The women used to bounce me on their knee  
They would always say When he grows up watch out  
When the gals see his big blue eyes  
Theyll hang around like a bunch of flies  
Those women knew what they were talkin about  
  
Im a Ladys Man I get the breaks  
I guess Ive got everything it takes  
When it come to lovin they like my brand  
Oh the gals wont leave me alone  
I have to disconnect my phone  
Thats how it is when youre a Ladys Man  
  
Im a Ladys Man Oh yessiree  
I love the gals and the gals love me  
And when it comes to dates Im in demand  
Oh I like em short I like em tall  
As a mater of fact I love em all  
Make way for me Im a lovin Ladys Man
