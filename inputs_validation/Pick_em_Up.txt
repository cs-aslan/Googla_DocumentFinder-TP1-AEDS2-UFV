Well sometimes I lose my direction  
And sometimes I jump off track  
But when I hide out baby I can always get it back  
I need to feel the cool breeze  
In my face the rumble of the engine between my legs  
Hey little sister you can color me gone  
  
Chorus  
So if I want to stay out all night long you cant stop me from runnin wild  
Dont you worry how long Im gone I come back every once in a while  
I pick em up and lay em all down  
I never like my feet to ever hit the ground  
Dont miss when Im gone cause Ill be around  
Im a free spirit baby pick me up and lay me on down  
  
Now I know that I got me a good life  
Jim Bean and women they treat me right  
I make my own rules like it or not  
Now dont misunderstand me baby I give in every once in a while  
Well its times like honey Ill leave you with a smile  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive been here Ive been there Ive been everywhere  
I wouldnt tell you no lies  
And just like me youre a wild one  
Wont you take me for a ride  
I pick em up and lay em all down  
I dont like my feet to ever hit the ground  
Dont miss me while Im gone cause Ill be around yeah  
Im a free spirit baby pick me up  
And lay me on down
