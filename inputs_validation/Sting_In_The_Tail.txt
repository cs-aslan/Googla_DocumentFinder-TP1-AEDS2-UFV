Well I dont care  
About the summer rain  
I know its good for the garden  
Dont care what blue skies  
They turn to gray  
When you come around  
And try to run me down  
Storm clouds darken yeah  
I dont get down when the fields go brown  
Its just a charm of the season  
Well things in nature have their reason  
But when you come along and try to do me wrong  
Well the first time Ill ignore it  
But dont you push beyond the pale  
But then youre gonna find  
Theres no more water in the well  
And you may think youre gonna walk  
Right all well over me  
But theres a sting in the tail  
Of this honey bee  
The wind blows cold as the year grows old  
Yeah thats just the natural way it goes  
I feel a chill from my head down to my toes  
Each time you call my name and tell me Im to blame  
Well the first time Ill ignore it  
But dont you push beyond the pale  
But then youre gonna find  
Theres no more water in the well  
And you may think youre gonna walk  
Right all over me  
But theres a sting in the tail  
Of this honey bee  
I said the first time Ill ignore it  
But dont you push beyond the pale  
And then youre gonna find  
Theres no more water in the well  
You may think youre gonna walk  
Right all over me  
Theres a sting in the tail  
Of this honey bee  
Yes theres a sting in the tail  
Well the cold winds gonna blow  
Let it rain let it snow  
And dont give me your grief  
I cant take it anymore
