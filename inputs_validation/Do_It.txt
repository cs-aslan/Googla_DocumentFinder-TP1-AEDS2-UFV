Im walkin downtown  
No lookin around  
Cause Im a fool and a half  
Blessed and beaten by love  
  
I walk in the direction  
But then I stop the action  
Cause when I try to do it  
My heart is gone I blew it  
  
Do it do it  
  
Im going on and on just on and on  
Just walkin talkin not a winner at all  
Im boozing losing getting out of control  
She dances hiphop shes on the top  
Im still a fool and a half blessed and beaten by love  
  
Do it do it  
  
Im walkin back home  
Keep lookin around  
Still a fool and a half  
Blessed and beaten by love  
  
She walks in my direction  
Why dont she start the action  
I got no guts to do it  
And then shes gone I blew it  
  
Do it do it
