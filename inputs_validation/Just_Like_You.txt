Its just like you to talk when Im not around  
Its just like you to kick me when Im down  
Symptoms of your lunacy  
Tryin to be what you cant be  
I dont want to end up just like you  
  
I cant hear you  
I cant see you  
I wont hear you  
  
Its just like you to think youre playin god  
Its just like me to know youre not  
Weakening with every day  
Turn down the sound and fade away  
No Ill never end up just like you  
  
I dont need you  
I can read you  
Never need you  
You cant see me  
You cant bleed me  
Cold and empty  
Just like you  
  
There lies a fallen man  
Fallen by his own hand  
Once the way it used to be  
Believed in you but now Im free  
I believed in you but now Im free  
Now Im free  
  
Its just like you  
I dont need you  
I can read you  
Never need you  
You cant see me  
You cant read me  
I set me free  
Just like you
