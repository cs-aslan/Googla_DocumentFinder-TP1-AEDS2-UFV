Drove my car to the top of the hill  
And I looked out across the town  
I got the urge to move again  
I guess Ill never settle down  
  
We talked about things getting better  
But they still looked the same to me  
Could be a near sighted heart  
Seein what it wants to see  
  
So take me to the highway  
Take me far from here  
These days Im not seein anything too clear  
  
Nothin seems to move fast enough  
When time isnt on your side  
Cant seem to keep the wheels in motion  
No matter how hard you try  
  
I need another point of view  
Someplace Ive never seen  
Keepin my eyes wide open  
Goin where Ive never been  
  
So take me to the highway  
Take me far from here  
These days Im not seein anything too clear  
  
Ive been lookin for an answer  
And Ive got a long way to go  
But when I reach that place  
I know Ill find what Im lookin for
