I want to  
I want to be someone else or Ill explode  
Floatin upon this surface for the birds  
The birds  
The birds  
  
You want me  
Fuckin well come and find me  
Ill be waitin  
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches  
And nothin

You want me  
Well come and break the door down  
You want me  
Fuckin come and break the door down  
Im ready Im ready Im ready  
Im ready
