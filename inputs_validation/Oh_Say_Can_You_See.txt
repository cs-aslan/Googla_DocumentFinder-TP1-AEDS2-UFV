Oh say can you see my stars  
The night time is almost ours  
To wander through Hayleys and look at the bars  
Night time is almost ours  
  
The headlights from passing cars  
They illuminate my face then theyve made the dark  
The voice of Nirvana says Come as you are  
And I will  
The night time is almost ours  
  
A sway of the hips and arms  
Well cradle you from afar  
They swing till you tire and send it alarms  
Night time is almost ours
