Judah to Jesse It is getting hard  
For you to be  
God of broken light  
Will you be the martyr  
Cant you see  
Well follow you for life  
  
Come and walk on water  
Letem see  
The Chosen Ones Alive  
Wont be their father  
Dont you see  
They all believe your lies  
  
Are you coming back  
To the black where we hide  
Are you coming back  
Ill make you larger than life  
  
Judas and Jesus were  
Prophecies here for all time  
And with a kiss and the our  
Destinies are sealed for life  
  
Disciples to Jesse Come back to black
