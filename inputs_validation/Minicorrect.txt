They say always use a condom I say always use a whip  
They say be careful where you come at night I just shoot straight from the
hip  
When it comes to loves great fountain I wont just take a sip  
Ill swallow and Ill gulp until the fountain makes me sick  
  
So its me left with the baby and disease  
You cant say you didnt want it on your hands and on your knees  
You made me feel so special  
Well you were especially good  
Im sorry that you misunderstood  
  
These neatly folded corduroys hide rubber underneath  
But the only rubber you have worn is that useless rubber sheath  
I wont have what Ive got for you stolen by no thief  
Cause the safest sex Ive ever had was hanging from a tree  
  
So youve left me for another pretty face  
Thats not true I left you for one half the human race  
Now Im by myself  
A woman who knows her place  
Its not so much the chase its the race  
  
They say treat her like a lady and shell treat you like her jewels  
They say cruel to be kind I just say cruel to be cruel  
They say only marry once I say only marry fools  
They wouldnt have made the cane if you werent meant to break the rules  
  
Have you told them that youll hurt them then be gone  
Ive told them that Ill hurt them if that really turns them on  
You left a bitter scar  
I tied those ropes too tight  
Ill tie them loose for you tonight  
  
When I told you that I loved you  
I meant minicorrect  
When I said Id never leave you  
I meant minicorrect  
A ring around your finger a chain around your neck  
That was major correct
