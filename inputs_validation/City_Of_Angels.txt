Under the bridge  
  
Sometimes I feel like I dont have a partner  
Sometimes I feel like my only friend  
Its the city I live in the city of angels  
Lonely as I am together we cry  
  
I drive on her streets cause shes my companion  
I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am  
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy  
I never worry now that is a lie  
  
I dont ever wanna feel like I did that day  
Take me to the place I love  
Take me all the way I dont ever wanna feel like I did that day  
Take me to the place I love  
Take me all the way yea yea yea  
  
Its hard to believe that theres nobody out there  
Its hard to believe that Im all alone  
At least I have her love the city she loves me  
Lonely as I am together we cry  
  
And I dont ever wanna feel like I did that day  
Take me to the place I love  
Take me all the way  
And I dont ever wanna feel like I did that day  
Take me to the place I love  
Take me all the way yea yea yeyea  
Oh no no no  
Yea yeyea  
Love me I say yea yeyea  
  
Under the bridge downtown  
Is where I drew some blood  
Under the bridge downtown  
I could not get enough  
Under the bridge downtown  
Forgot about my love  
Under the bridge downtown  
I Gave my life away  
Yeah yeah yeyeah  
Oh no no no  
Yeah yeyeah  
Oh no no  
I said yea yeyea  
Ill stay
