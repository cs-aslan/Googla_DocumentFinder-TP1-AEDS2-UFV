Little Nemo rubbed his eyes and got out of bed  
trying hard to piece together a broken dream  
His visions lifelike and full of imagination  
its strange to think they came from such a tiny head  
  
Dragons breathing fire but friendly  
Mushrooms tall as houses  
Giant Nymphs and goblins playing  
scenes from a nights dream poor Little Nemo  
  
Eating all kinds of food so close to bedtime  
they always made him have these nightmares it seemed  
  
Helped young Washington in the garden  
cut the cherry tree down  
Now we all know thats not history  
scenes from a nights dream poor Little Nemo  
  
Nemo get out of bed  
Dont tell me stories I dont want to know  
Come on you sleepy head were waiting to go  
  
Once he went to the Carnival of Nations  
dancing with the princess through the night  
  
Found themselves on a moving platform  
ten ton weights above them  
seeking audience with King Morpheus  
Scenes from a nights dream poor little Nemo  
  
Nemo get out of bed  
Dont tell me stories I dont want to know  
Come on you sleepy head were waiting to go
