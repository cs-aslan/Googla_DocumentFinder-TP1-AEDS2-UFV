Junk fuck  
A good night the best in a long time  
A new friend turned me on to an old favorite  
Nothing better than a dealer whos high  
Be high convince them to buy  
Whats my drug of choice  
Well what have you got  
I dont go broke  
And I do it a lot  
Seems so sick to the hypocrite norm  
Running their boring drills  
But we are an elite race of our own  
The stoners junkies and freaks  
Are you happy I am man  
Content and fully aware  
Money status nothing to me  
Cause your life is empty and bare  
Whats my drug of choice  
Well what have you got  
I dont go broke  
And I do it a lot  
I do it a lot yeah  
You cant understand a users mind  
But try with your books and degrees  
If you let yourself go and opened your mind  
Ill bet youd be doing like me  
And it aint so bad  
Whats my drug of choice  
Well what have you got  
I dont go broke  
And I do it a lot  
Say I do it a lot  
I do it a lot  
I do it a lot  
Say I do it a lot
