Love love is a dream  
We were like two young strands of driftwood  
Caught up in a stream  
We were destined for each other  
From our very first hello  
We came bustin through that river dam  
And made that river flow  
We will sail upon the ocean  
Til the shoreline meets the sky  
Carried on the first trade wind  
That favours you and I  
We have both of us between us  
Known misfortune in our days  
Darling this time were on our way  
  
Cause were here  
And here well stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
We are here  
And here well stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
  
Life oh life is a chance  
We were the only two who spun the wheel  
And never scored romance  
If wed stayed to play for fortune  
Wed have broke the banks of gold  
Wed have taken old Las Vegas  
For every cent that she could hold  
Love like ours was made in heaven  
It was blessed by Lord above  
We will spend our lives together  
Forever hand in glove  
We have both of us between us  
Known misfortune in our days  
Darling this time were on our way  
  
Cause were here  
And here well stay  
We wont ever throw this love of ours away  
We are here  
And here well stay  
We wont ever throw this love of ours away  
  
Cause were here  
And here well stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
We are here  
Here well stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
  
Cause were here  
And here well stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
So we are here  
And here well stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away
