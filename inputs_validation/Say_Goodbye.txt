Verse 1  
We havent really talked about it  
All we do is walk around it now  
I hate to say I thought about it  
I wished that we could make this work somehow  
  
Chorus  
Its not really complicated  
I can hear it when you sigh  
It comes a time we have to face it  
Maybe its just time to say goodbye  
  
Verse 2  
Lately I can feel us drifting  
Even tho the good outweighs the bad  
It feels like our world is shifting  
And yet you are the best Ive ever had  
  
Chorus  
I still love to watch you sleeping  
I still see that look in your eyes  
But theyre seein and believin  
That maybe its just time to say goodbye  
  
Bridge  
Say goodbye to all the times we treasured  
Say goodbye let the chips fall where they lay  
Say goodbye to things we cannot measure  
Walk away say goodbye  
  
Verse 3  
Ill remember you forever  
Ill remember every single year  
Runnin through the rain and laughin  
And later in our bed we feel so near  
And Ill know when I am older  
And the clouds fill up the sky  
I may look over my shoulder  
And noone was too young to say goodbye  
Years from now when I am older  
I may sit and wonder why  
Will I look over my shoulder  
And know I was too young to say goodbye  
I was just too young to say goodbye  
To say goodbye
