Woman if I were a woman I would be man enough to keep you warm  
And boy if I were a man I would be strong enough to hold you tight  
And when I cry and Im in the mood I will try to keep from loving you  
Love is divine  
Love is the rage  
Leave me alone  
Lovely day  
Love is bizarre  
Lover be mine  
Dont wanna lose ya  
Dont wanna lose ya  
Love is divine  
Love is the rage  
Melancholy  
Dont wanna go  
Lovely time  
Lover be mine  
Dont wanna lose ya  
Lover if you were my lover would you be kind enough to take no other  
Boy if I were a man would I be strong enough to practice what I preach  
When your out of reach I would sigh and stomp and prove my speech  
Love is divine  
Love is the rage  
Leave me alone  
Lovely day  
Love is bizarre  
Lover be mine  
Dont wanna lose ya  
Dont wanna lose ya  
Love is divine  
Love is the rage  
Melancholy  
Dont wanna go  
Lovely time  
Lover be mine  
Dont wanna lose ya
