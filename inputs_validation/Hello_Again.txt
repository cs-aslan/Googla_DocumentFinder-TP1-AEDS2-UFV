Hello again hello  
I just called to say hello  
I couldnt sleep  
At all tonight  
And I know its late  
I just couldnt wait  
  
Hello my friends hello  
I just called to let you know  
I think about you every night  
When Im here alone  
And your there at home  
Hello  
  
Lately its been crazy  
Maybe Im to blame  
But I put my heart above your head  
Weve been through it all and you love me just the same  
And when your not there  
I still need to hear  
  
Hello again hello  
Its good to need you so  
Its good to love you like I do  
I feel this way when I hear you say  
Hello  
  
Hello my friend hello  
Just called to let you know  
I think about you every night  
And I know its late but I couldt wait  
Hello
