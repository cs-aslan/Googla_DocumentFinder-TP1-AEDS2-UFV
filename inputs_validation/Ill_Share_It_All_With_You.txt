TOMMY  
What is mine dear will be yours  
When the sun shines and when it pours  
Summer Winter Spring and Fall  
Fiftyfifty in evrything  
Havent got much even that much to my name  
Fortunes door shut cant get in but just the same  
  
My ear for music my feet for dancing my lips for kissing  
Ill share it all with you  
  
My sense of humor my disposition my rosy future  
Ill share it all with you  
  
Someday honey Ill have money  
You know what that brings  
Furs and diamond rings  
And besides those things  
Therell be  
  
My ear for music my feet for dancing my lips for kissing  
Ill share it all with you  
  
WINNIE  
My head for thinking my face for smiling my hands for cooking  
Ill share it all with you  
  
My understanding my loving nature my good intentions  
Ill share it all with you  
  
Im not twenty but theres plenty  
Underneath my hat  
I know where Im at  
And on top of that  
Therell be  
  
My ear for music my feet for dancing my lips for kissing  
Ill share it all with you
