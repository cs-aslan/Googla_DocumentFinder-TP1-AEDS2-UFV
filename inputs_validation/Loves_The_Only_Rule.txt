I dont give a damn how its supposed to be  
That might work for you it dont work for me  
You write your truth and Ill write mine  
One mans ceilings another mans sky high  
  
Flying like an aeroplane  
Crying like the lonely whistle of a long black train  
Dance in the pouring rain  
Spit in the eye of a hurricane  
Who said life has got to be so cruel  
Loves the only rule  
  
Its written in the stars where I fit in  
Its going to hurt sometimes you got to lose to win  
You got your sins and I got mine  
Sell your secrets kiss them all goodbye  
  
Flying like an aeroplane  
Alive like a lonely note from John Coltrane  
Run like its a getaway  
Say those things that you shouldnt say  
Think about it wouldnt that be cool  
Loves the only rule  
  
Might be a wrecking ball  
Or just a wake up call  
Dont matter where the pieces fall  
  
Woohoos  
Woohoos  
Woohoos  
  
Im gonna fly like an aeroplane  
Cry like the whistle of a long black train  
Dance in the pouring rain  
Im alive like a lonely note from John Coltrane  
Run like its a getaway  
Say those things that you shouldnt say  
  
Where love loves the only rule  
Yes love loves the only rule
