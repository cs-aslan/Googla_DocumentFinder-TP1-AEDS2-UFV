I shouldnt have walked away  
I wouldve stayed if youd say  
We couldve made everything okay but we just  
Threw the blame back and forth we treated love like a sport  
The final blow hit so low Im still on the ground  
  
I couldnt have prepared myself for this fall  
Shattered in pieces curled on the floor  
Super natural love conquers all remember we  
Used to touch the sky  
And lighting dont strike  
The same place twice when you and I  
Said goodbye I felt the angels cry  
True loves a gift  
But we let it drift in a storm  
Every night I feel the angels cry  
  
Cmon babe cant our love be revived  
Bring it back and we gon make it right  
Im on the edge just tryin to survive  
As the angels cry  
  
Limitless omnipresent kind of love  
Couldnt have guessed it would just stop and disappear  
In a whirlwind  
Here I am walkin on this narrow rope wobbling  
But wont let go waitin for a glimpse of the suns glow  
  
I know I can stand just pull me back up  
Like there aint no hurricane its just us  
Im willing to live and die for our love  
Baby we can get back that shine  
  
Cause lighting dont strike the same place twice  
When you and I said goodbye I felt the angels cry  
Cause true loves a gift but we let it drift in a storm  
Every night I feel the angels cry  
  
Cmon babe cant our love be revived  
Bring it back and we gon make it right  
Im on the edge just tryin to survive  
As the angels cry  
  
Baby Im missin you dont allow love to lose Dont let our love  
We gotta ride it through  
Im reaching for you Baby Im missin you  
Baby Im missin you dont allow love to lose You can  
We gotta ride it through We gotta ride it  
Im reaching for you And Im gonna say  
  
Ou lighting dont strike the same place twice  
You and I said goodbye felt the angels cry  
Cause true loves a gift we let it slip in a storm  
Every night I feel the angels cry  
Oh babe dont let the angels cry
