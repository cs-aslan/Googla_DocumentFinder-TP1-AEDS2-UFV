The boys got problems  
The boys got stress  
The boys a 38 hidden in his desk  
The boys got a chickie  
With four months to go  
Grim Facts  every parent better know  
  
The girls a deadly teaser  
Wants to do a private show  
Shes got a hundred thousand fantasies  
She wants the band to know  
She likes to brush across my Levis  
She likes to watch him grow  
Grim Facts  every parent better know  
Grim Facts  every parent better know  
  
Chorus  
Red lights  Gang fights  
Brewing in the heat  
Cop cars  Gay bars  
On your precious street  
That aint so neat  
  
Sisters on the street now  
Looking for some Joe  
Only got about an hour  
To pay for her new nose  
She gets a hundred for her body  
A nickel for her soul  
These are grim facts  every parent must know  
Grim facts  every parent must know  
  
Chorus  
Red lights  Gang fights  
Brewing in the heat  
Cop cars  Gay bars  
On your precious street  
That aint so neat  
  
And Im feeling itchy  
Got a fire down below  
Im a walkin loaded time bomb  
Just about to blow  
Tries to slide inside my pockets  
But its strictly SRO  
Grim facts  every parent gonna know  
Grim facts  every parent gonna know  
  
Chorus  
Red lights  Gang fights  
Brewing in the heat  
Cop cars  Gay bars  
On your precious street  
That aint so neat  
  
Mmm Grim facts you know growing all the time  
Mmm Grim facts real grim Yeah
