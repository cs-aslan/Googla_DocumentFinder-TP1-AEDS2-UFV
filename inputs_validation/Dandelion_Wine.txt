Stoned all the time on dandelion wine  
What else can I do  
Ive been this way everyday  
now that were through  
  
Do I love you  
You can bet your life that I dododo  
Do I love you  
I would drink my wine from your shshshoe  
  
Stoned all the time on dandelion wine  
Its all down to on you  
Ive been this way everyday  
thinking of you  
  
Chorus x2  
Stoned all the time on dandelion wine  
What else can I do  
Ive been this way everyday  
now that were through
