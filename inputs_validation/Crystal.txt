Were like crystal  
Hey  
We break easy  
Hoo  
Im a poor man  
Hey  
If you leave me  
Hoo  
Im applauded  
Hey  
Then forgotten  
It was summer  
Hey  
Now its autumn  
Hoo  
I dont know what to say  
You dont care anyway  
Im a man in a rage  
With a girl I betrayed  
Here comes love  
Its like honey  
You cant buy it with money  
You shook me to the core  
You shook me to the core  
  
Hoo hey  
Were like crystal  
Hey  
Its not easy  
Hoo  
With your love  
Hey  
You could feed me  
Hoo  
Every man  
Hey  
And every woman  
Hoo  
Needs someone  
Hey  
So keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
  
I dont know what to say  
You dont care anyway  
Im a man in a rage  
With a girl I betrayed  
Here comes love  
Its like honey  
You cant buy it with money  
Youre not alone anymore  
You shook me to the core  
You shook me to the core  
  
I dont know what to say  
You dont care anyway  
Im a man in a rage  
With a girl I betrayed  
Here comes love  
Its like honey  
You cant buy it with money  
Youre not alone anymore  
You shook me to the core  
You shook me to the core  
You shook me to the core  
You shook me to the core
