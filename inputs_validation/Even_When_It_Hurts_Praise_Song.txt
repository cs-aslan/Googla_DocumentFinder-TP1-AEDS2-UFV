Take this fainted heart  
Take these tainted hands  
Wash me in Your love  
Come like grace again  
  
Even when my strength is lost  
Ill praise You  
Even when I have no song  
Ill praise You  
Even when its hard to find the words  
Louder then Ill sing Your praise  
  
Chorus  
I will only sing Your praise  
I will only sing Your praise  
I will only sing Your praise  
  
Take this mountain weight  
Take these ocean tears  
Hold me through the trial  
Come like hope again  
  
Even when the fight seems lost  
Ill praise You  
Even when it hurts like hell  
Ill praise You  
Even when it makes no sense to sing  
Louder then Ill sing Your praise  
  
Chorus  
  
And my heart burns only for You  
You are all You are all I want  
And my soul waits only for You  
And I will sing till the morning has come  
  
Lord my heart burns only for You  
You are all You are all I want  
And my soul waits only for You  
And I will sing till the miracle comes  
  
Chorus  
  
Even when the morning comes  
Ill praise You  
Even when the fight is won  
Ill praise You  
Even when my time on earth is done  
Louder then Ill sing your praise  
  
I will only sing Your praise
