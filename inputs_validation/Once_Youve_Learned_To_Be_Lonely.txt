Youre asking me to open up  
Im tryin my best to give enough  
To keep this love alive  
It wouldnt be so hard for me to do  
If it hadnt have been for all my hearts been through  
  
But once youve learned to be lonely  
And lonely is the only thing youve known  
It begins to feel like home  
It becomes your comfort zone  
  
And once youve learned to be without someone  
And settle for the silence of an empty room  
Oh it changes you  
Theres a lot you have to undo  
Once youve learned to be lonely  
  
It becomes a habit of the heart  
To be afraid to even start  
To try and love again  
I want to give you myself to you  
But Ive been alone that Im scared to move  
  
But once youve learned to be lonely  
And lonely is the only thing youve known  
It begins to feel like home  
It becomes your comfort zone  
  
Once youve learned to be without someone  
And settle for the silence of an empty room  
Ohit changes you  
Theres a lot you have to undo  
Once youve learned to be lonely  
  
Ive built these walls but I feel them falling down  
Touch by touch your love is my way out  
  
But once youve learned to be lonely  
And lonely is the only thing youve known  
It begins to feel like home  
It becomes your comfort zone  
  
Once youve learned to be without someone  
And settle for the silence of an empty room  
Ohit changes you  
Theres a lot you have to undo  
Once youve learned to be lonely  
Theres a lot you have to undo  
Once youve learned to be lonely
