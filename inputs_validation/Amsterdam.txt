Looking good through the window  
Shinin red and blue light  
A little thick in the bottom  
But still lookin alright yeah  
Got a pocket fulla money  
Got me a long night ahead  
A quick stop by the bulldog  
Score me some panama red yeah  
Wham bam oh Amsterdam  
Yea yea yea  
Stone you like nothin else can  
Yea yea yea  
Hot damn roll an Amsterdam  
Yea yea yea  
If she cant then nothin else can  
Caught a plane outta Moscow  
Spent one cold night in Berlin  
Its a long hard way  
But Im a comin back again yea  
Wham bam oh Amsterdam  
Yea yea yea  
Stone you like nothin else can  
Yea yea yea  
Yea come on now roll an  
Amsterdam

If she cant then no one else can  
Yea yea yea  
Wham bam oh Amsterdam

Stone you like nothin else can  
Yea yea yea  
Hot damn roll an Amsterdam  
Yea yea yea  
If she cant then no one else can  
Yea yea yea  
Wham bam oh Amsterdam
