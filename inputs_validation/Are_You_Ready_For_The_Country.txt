Slippin and aslidin playin Dominoes  
Leftin and arightin aint a crime you know  
Well I gotta tell the story before its time to go  
Well are you ready for the country  
Are you ready for me  
Are you ready for the country  
Aint that the sight to see  
Talkin to a preacher said God was on his side  
Talkin to a butcher they both were sellin hide  
Well I gotta tell the story boys  
I dont know the reason why  
Are you ready for the country  
Are you ready for me  
Are you ready for the country  
Aint that a sight to see  
Incomprehensible  
Are you ready for the country  
Are you ready for me  
Better get ready for the country  
Ready for me  
Are you ready for the country  
Ready for me  
Are you ready for the country  
Aint that the sight to see
