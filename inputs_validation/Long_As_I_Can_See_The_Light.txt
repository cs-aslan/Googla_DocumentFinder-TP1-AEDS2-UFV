Put a candle in the window  
Cause I feel Ive gotta move  
Though Im goin goin  
Ill be comin home soon  
Long as I can see the light  
  
Pack my bag and lets get moving  
Cause Im bound to drift awhile  
Though Im gone gone  
You dont have to worry  
Long as I can see the light  
  
Guess Ive got that old travelin bone  
Cause this feeling wont leave alone  
But I wont wont  
Be losin my way  
Long as I can see the light  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Put a candle in the window  
Cause I feel Ive gotta move  
Though Im goin goin  
Ill be comin home soon  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light
