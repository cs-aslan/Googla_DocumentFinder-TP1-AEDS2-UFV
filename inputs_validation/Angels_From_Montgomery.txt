Named after my mother  
My old man is another  
Child thats grown old  
If dreams were lightning  
And thunder were desire  
This old house would have burnt down  
A long time ago  
  
Chorus  
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery  
Make me a poster of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to  
To believe in this livin is just a hard way to go  
  
When I was a young girl  
I had me a cowboy  
He werent much to look at  
Just a free ramblin man  
But that was a long time  
And no matter how I try  
The years just flow by  
Like a broken down dam  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres flies in the kitchen  
I can hear em in there buzzin  
And I aint done nothin  
Since I woke up today  
How the hell can a person  
Go to work in the mornin  
Come home in the evenin  
And have nothin to say  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X
