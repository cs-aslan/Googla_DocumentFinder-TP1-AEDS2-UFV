Hey pretty mama Im as blue as the skies above  
Hey pretty mama youre the only woman I love  
And your daddys gonna love you  
But I just cant have you blues honey ease my mind  
  
You told me if I called you on the phone tonight youd be in  
What makes you tell me them lies when you know its a dog gone sin  
I guess Ill have to settle for  
Them lovin cant have you blues she just wasnt there thats all  
  
You may be havin your fun you may be out on the run thats fine  
But a love like yours baby someday is bound to go blind  
So come home because your daddys got  
Them love you cant have you blues you gotta change your mind  
  
Ive reached my verdict that you women are all the same  
You run away and leave me then you say I got myself to blame  
So come on back daddys got them  
Love you cant have you blues Ill never change my mind  
  
If I look at the wall that old wall looks back at me  
Everywhere that I look its the same old colour to me blue  
So hurry home daddys got  
Them love you cant have you blues
