Oh Im waitin in the darkness  
Hesitatin in the darkness  
Follow on your shadows in the night  
Im feelin its burnin  
The point of no return babe  
Easy for two  
Baby its so hard for one  
Princess of the night of the night  
Im drownin in the light in the light  
Princess of my dream of my dream  
Crossfire of feeling  
Princess of night what have you done  
Baby I know our day will come  
Princes of night princess of day  
When the night will fade away  
Gotta date babe with an angel  
With a hot child of the city  
Follow all your shadows in the night  
Oh somewhere there is someone  
And two hearts beatin as one  
Easy for two  
Its so hard for one
