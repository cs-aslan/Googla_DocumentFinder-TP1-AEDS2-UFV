Beneath still waters  
Theres a strong undertow  
The surface wont tell you  
What the deep water knows  
  
Darling Im saying  
I know somethings wrong  
Beneath still waters  
Your love is gone  
  
Even a fool could see  
That youll soon be leaving me  
But each and every heart  
Must share there turn for misery  
  
This time its me  
And Ill cry alone  
Beneath still waters  
Your love is gone  
  
Even a fool could see  
That youll soon be leaving me  
But each and every heart  
Must share there turn for misery  
  
And this time its me  
And Ill cry alone  
Beneath still waters  
Your love is gone  
  
Beneath still waters  
Your love is gone
