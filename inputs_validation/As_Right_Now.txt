Youre still the lady of my dreams  
Youre still my high school beauty queen  
To me its still magic when we touch  
And I have never loved you so much  
  
As right now  
As right now  
Youre still my actress on the screen  
Still the leading lady in my scenes  
  
To me its still magic when we touch  
And Ive still never loved someone so much  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now  
  
Youre still the one Im with when Im alone  
And youre still the lover calling on my phone  
To me its still magic when we touch  
And I will never love someone so much  
  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now
