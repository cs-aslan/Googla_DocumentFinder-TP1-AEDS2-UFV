You go on your way  
Ill go on mine  
Please dont you call me  
Or drop me a line  
  
Ill be better off now  
With somebody new  
And you should find someone  
More suited to you  
  
Cause were wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Lets fight another round  
  
I couldnt explain it  
I cant tell you why  
Ive got such a talent  
For making you cry  
  
And one day youll thank me  
For saying so long  
For making an end to  
A love that was wrong  
  
Cause were wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Lets fight another round  
  
Cause were wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other
