They call me love  
They call me dear  
They kiss off and leave me  
For their own career  
I got a satellite dish Im all alone  
With my little goldfish  
And eminem em on my headphones  
You heard that yet You will  
  
Selfish pigs put the blame on me  
So hacked off what I came to be  
Im off the tracks  
Now Im all at sea  
They like jogging more than they like me  
  
Im evil  
Evil no2  
  
Then need to have something  
Becomes the seed to have anything  
The lonely tears have dried up  
And the brain cells start to fry  
My heart cries out for new things  
Turns to anything will do things  
My left sides like a train crash  
Form all the things I tried  
  
I was so scared  
I was lonely  
I got mixed up  
Now Im only  
  
Im evil  
Evil no2  
  
Mummy and daddys on prozac  
Said theyre happy but  
They wont be back  
I hope they have a heart attack  
cause of what they done to me  
  
They left me for a wine bar  
They left me for the wrong car  
I dunno how I got this far  
  
Im evil  
Evil no2  
  
Eminem aint so far away from this  
  
Mummy got a boyfriend  
Daddy got a girlfriend  
Gotta go away at weekends  
I tell you what Ill do  
Take every pill that I see  
You can do what you want to me  
Im only trying to break free  
From the evil that you do  
  
Im evil  
Evil no2
