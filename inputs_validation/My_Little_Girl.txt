Gotta hold on easy as I let you go  
Going to tell you how much I love you  
Though you think you already know  
I remember I thought you looked like an angel  
Wrapped in pink so soft and warm  
Youve had me wrapped around your finger  
Since the day you were born  
  
Chorus  
Beautiful baby from the outside in  
Chase your dreams but always know  
The road that will lead you home again  
Go on take on this old world but to me  
You know youll always be my little girl  
  
When you were in trouble that crooked little smile  
Could melt my heart of stone  
Now look at you  
I turned around and youve almost grown  
Sometimes when youre asleep  
I whisper I love you in the moonlight at your door  
As I walk away I hear you say  
Daddy love you more  
  
Chorus  
  
Someday some boy will come and ask me for your hand  
But I wont say yes to him  
Unless I know hes the half that makes you whole  
He has a poets soul and the heart of a mans man  
I know hell say that hes in love  
But between you and me he wont be good enough  
  
Chorus
