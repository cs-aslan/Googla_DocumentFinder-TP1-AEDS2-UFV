You just stepped into the main track  
climbed down off the fence  
Words are your weapon  
lies are your defense  
I know what you want  
and I see what you see  
Youre looking for somebody  
but he isnt me  
Find yourself another  
because we will not be lovers  
How your eyes are like tortures  
and your presence is bliss  
I never knew time  
could speed and zip like this  
The touch of your flesh  
is tough to resist  
Planets collide collide  
at the smack of your kiss  
But you can kiss your brother  
because we will not be lovers  
Now youre pulling down curtains  
Youve been sparking old flames  
Youve been causing disturbance  
crying for shame  
Youve been Knocking on doors  
Youve been abusing my name  
Youve been casting up doubt  
youve been throwing your blame  
But you can throw it at your mother  
we will not be lovers  
Now the worlds full of trouble  
everybodys scared  
The landlords are frowning  
cupboards are bare  
People are scrambling  
like dogs for a share  
Its cruel and its hard  
but it nothing compared to  
what we do to each other  
to each other  
We will not be lovers  
we will not be lovers no  
We will not be lovers no
