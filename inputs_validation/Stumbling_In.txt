I dont mind confiding  
That I make stupid mistakes  
Been misled and misguided  
And Im easily led astray  
  
But you can dance with disaster  
Never missing a step  
Spinning faster and faster  
Long after Ive already slipped  
  
But in the middle of it all  
You always break my fall  
In the middle of it all  
  
Chorus  
Over and over again and again  
You float through the door and Im stumbling in  
Im twisted and tangled and soaked to the skin  
You float through the door and Im stumbling in again  
  
Pulled in every direction  
Ive a million regrets  
Youre the perfect protection  
When Im diving in over my head  
  
But in the middle of it all  
You always break my fall  
In the middle of it all  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres bones in my closet  
Ive collected quite a few  
God knows what causes an angel to love a fool  
  
But in the middle of it all  
You always break my fall  
In the middle of it  
  
Chorus
