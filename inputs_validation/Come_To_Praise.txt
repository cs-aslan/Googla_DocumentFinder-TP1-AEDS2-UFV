When I think of the way that He gave all for me  
I just cant stop singing this song that I sing  
He is so unbelievable take it from me  
His Love is irreplaceable its all that I need  
For everything that Hes done in me  
All I wanna do is just Praise Him  
Everybody  
I dont know what youve come to do  
Ive come to Praise Him Praise Him Praise Him  
Its just plain to see that when Im Praising Him  
I cant contain it I cant hold it in
