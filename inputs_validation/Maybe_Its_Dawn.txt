Out of the sky the rain comes driving down  
Washing away the hills of darkest brown  
Heading out through another country town  
White lace curtains  
  
Something certainly gets into me  
Call it jealousy  
And when Im so far away  
Somewhere the light shines bright along the highway  
  
Somewhere inside me  
Somewhere above the night  
And maybe youve gone your way  
And Ill go my way  
  
Somewhere inside me  
Somewhere inside the night  
Maybe its dawn  
Out of my heart my love comes falling free  
  
Healing the pain that burns you and me  
Heading towards another warm country  
Smiles are dancing shades entrancingly  
Gets into me  
  
Call it fantasy  
And when Im so far away  
Somewhere the light shines bright along the highway  
Somewhere inside me  
  
Somewhere above the night  
And maybe youve gone your way  
And Ive gone my way  
Somewhere inside me  
  
Somewhere inside the night  
Somewhere the light shines bright along the highway  
Somewhere inside me  
Somewhere above the night  
  
And maybe youve gone your way  
And Ive gone my way  
Somewhere inside me  
Somewhere inside the night  
  
And maybe its dawn  
In the city where Ill be  
Maybe its dawn  
When youre near me
