Wholl take the only hearts they got  
And throw them into the fire  
Wholl risk their own self respect  
In the name of desire  
Wholl regret everything theyve done  
And who will get the bill  
  
Lovers will  
Wholl hurt each other all the time  
And never give it a thought  
Wholl lie about where theyve been  
And hope they never get caught  
Wholl say each others kisses  
No longer thrill  
Lovers will  
Lovers will do almost anything  
  
For the thrill that only love can bring  
If love is a healer wholl be the first ones ill  
Lovers will  
  
Wholl never know what theyve got  
Until its just about gone  
And whose arms will gather up whats left  
To carry on  
  
And wholl stalk that little bit of love  
That hasnt been killed  
Lovers will
