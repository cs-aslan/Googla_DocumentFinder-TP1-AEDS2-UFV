Twice in a lifetime if youre really really lucky  
You may discover why you were brought here  
Tutta la vita you try to find your destination  
You search for the truth you try to make communication  
All of your life  
Tutta la vita asking Where is the party  
Its not a mansion in Malibu or a face lift at forty  
No you wont find it there  
Love is everywhere  
If youll only dare to try  
Its not on a map so we all have to muddle through  
You cant get there in a carnot even your BMW  
Twice in a lifetime youll know the answer  
Once when you find love  
Once when you give love to another  
Yesyou will find it there  
Love is everywhere  
If youll only dare to fly
