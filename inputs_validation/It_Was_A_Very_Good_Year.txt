When I was seventeen  
It was a very good year  
It was a very good year for small town girls  
And soft summer nights  
Wed hide from the lights  
On the village green  
When I was seventeen  
  
When I was twentyone  
It was a very good year  
It was a very good year for city girls  
Who lived up the stair  
With all that perfumed hair  
And it came undone  
When I was twentyone  
  
When I was thirtyfive  
It was a very good year  
It was a very good year for blueblooded girls  
Of independent means  
Wed ride in limousines  
And their chauffeurs would drive  
When I was thirtyfive  
  
But now the days grow short  
Im in the autumn of my years  
And I think of my life as vintage wine  
From fine old kegs  
From the brim to the dregs  
And it poured sweet and clear  
It was a very good year
