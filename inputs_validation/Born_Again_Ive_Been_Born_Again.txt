Chorus  
I have been born again  
Ive been born again  
Been o the water and Ive been baptized  
Ive been born again  
  
Verse 1  
I went to a meeting one night  
My heart was full of sin  
The preacher looked me straight in the eye  
And said  You must be born again  
I felt the Spirit movin deep down in my soul  
I head the voice of Jesus say  
Sinner Ill make you whole  
  
Verse 2  
I stepped into the water  
The water was chilly sand cold  
It chilled my natural body  
But it warmed my sinsick soul  
I came up out of the water  
Baptized in Jesus Name  
I jumped I shouted and spoke in tongues  
When the Holy Ghost came in  
  
Bridge  
Born Ive Been born again  
Born Ive been born again  
Born of the water  
Born of he Spirit
