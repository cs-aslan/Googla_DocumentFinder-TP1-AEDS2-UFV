If I tell you  
Will you listen will you stay  
Will you be here forever  
Never go away  
  
Never thought things would change  
Hold me tight  
Please dont say again  
That you have to go  
  
A bitter thought I had it all  
But I just let it go  
Oh this silence its so violent  
Since youre gone  
  
All my thoughts are with you forever  
Until the day well be back together  
I will be waiting for you  
  
If I had told you  
You would have listened  
You had stayed  
You would be here forever  
  
Never went away  
It would never have been the same  
All our time would have been in vain  
Cause you had to go  
  
The sweetest thought I had it all  
Cause I did let you go  
All our moments keep me warm  
When youre gone  
  
All my thoughts are with you forever  
Until the day well be back together  
I will be waiting for you
