I once had an ice cube  
Purty little ice cube  
Now its gone  
Now its gone  
  
Her name was Mary  
Purty little ice cube  
Now shes gone  
Now shes gone  
  
She was so shiny  
My Purty little ice cube  
Now shes gone  
Where she gone  
Shes gone with the others  
The shiny little ice cubes  
Movin on Movin on  
  
Shes gone  
Doesnt nothin ever last forever  
  
I miss my ice cube  
Purty little ice cube  
Since shes withdrawn  
  
I held her in my hand  
My chilly little ice cube  
Was it wrong Was it wrong  
  
She slipped away  
My moist little ice cube  
To oblivion oblivion  
  
She left me standing  
With tears on my face  
On the lawn  
So I wrote this song  
  
Purty little ice cube  
Where have you gone  
  
Doesnt nothing ever last forever  
  
Now shes gone  
Nothing ever lasts forever  
  
Doesnt nothing ever last forever  
  
Its been declared  
That its not wise  
To prize something too much  
I just wish to find something to  
Flaunt the right to  
Touch so gently  
  
Doesnt nothing ever last forever
