She comes in every morning at nine and sits down at her desk  
Smiles and says hello to everybody and tries to do her best  
To act like nothings wrong and nothings missin in her life  
But her eyes tell a story  
That her smile cant disguise  
  
Shes got that needin somebody wantin somebody who  
Will treat her like somebody for once in her life  
Shes lonely for love  
Is that asking too much  
For someone to treat her right  
Shes got that lonely needin lovin wantin somebody look in her eyes  
  
Sometimes I want to walk on over and tell her I can help  
Cause I know losing a love is tough  
Ive been there myself  
You still feel the pain long after all the tears have dried  
And its so hard to cover up  
The hurt you feel inside  
  
Shes got that needin somebody wantin somebody who  
Will treat her like somebody for once in her life  
Shes lonely for love  
Is that asking too much  
For someone to treat her right  
Shes got that lonely needin lovin wantin somebody look in her eyes  
  
Well I wish I could hold her right now  
And take her in my arms and show her  
That love can still be found  
  
Shes got that needin somebody wantin somebody who  
Will treat her like somebody for once in her life  
Shes lonely for love  
Is that asking too much  
For someone to treat her right  
Shes got that lonely needin lovin wantin somebody look in her eyes  
  
Shes got that lonely needin lovin wantin somebody look in her eyes  
  
Somebody look in her eyes  
Lonely needin lovin wantin somebody look in her eyes
