You dont love me pretty baby  
You dont love me yes I know  
You dont love me pretty baby  
You dont love me yes I know  
  
Well if you leave me pretty baby  
Dont you know youre gonna hurt me so  
Well Im gonna tell my mother  
Im gonna talk to my father too  
Well Im gonna tell my sweet mother  
Ill have a word with my father too  
Well Im gonna tell everybody  
What those young girls will do to you  
  
Goodbye now pretty baby  
If I dont see you no more  
Lord goodbye now pretty baby  
If I never see you no more  
Well if you think Ill be your fool Lord  
You better be on your merry way
