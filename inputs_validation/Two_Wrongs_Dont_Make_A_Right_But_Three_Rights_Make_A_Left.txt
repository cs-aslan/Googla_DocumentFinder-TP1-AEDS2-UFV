Fuck it I get the feeling tonight that its going down  
I get the feeling she might hit the fan  
I get the feeling cause she left without a reason  
But I dont care shes a fucking nightmare  
  
Like a fool back in school run around on the weekend  
Took a bit of time but now I see it like a bee can  
When Im not around youre with another dude streaking  
Like bount chica bount bount chica bount bount  
  
I I spy girls gone wild weekend  
I I spy youre hittin up my best friend  
I I spy youre going down in the deep end  
6 6 6 my Antichrist girlfriend  
  
I take back all the shit I gave you  
I take back every word I said to you  
I take back everything except the part  
Where I said we were through  
  
I take back all the shit I gave you  
I take back every word I said to you  
I take back everything except the part  
Where I said we were through  
  
Bust it I get the feeling she might sleep with other guys  
I get the feeling tonight shes not alone  
I get the feeling cause he picked her up this evening  
But I dont care shes a fucking nightmare  
  
Smokin Kools by the pool saw your tail when I was peeking  
Went to grab a beer and heard the box spring squeakin  
Walked into the room and there you were freakin  
Like bount chica bount bount chica bount bount  
  
I I spy girls gone wild weekend  
I I spy youre hittin up my best friend  
I I spy youre going down in the deep end  
6 6 6 my Antichrist girlfriend  
  
I take back all the shit I gave you  
I take back every word I said to you  
I take back everything except the part  
Where I said we were through  
  
I take back all the shit I gave you  
I take back every word I said to you  
I take back everything except the part  
Where I said we were through  
  
Good riddance and goodbye take your promise turned to lies  
Take your lows and your highs like a roller coaster ride  
Like a polar thats a white lie woo  
Thats a sigh of relief so listen Im gonna tell you why  
  
Youre gonna get what you deserve  
What goes around comes around havent you heard  
Like a boomerang bound to round the curve  
Youre gonna get what you deserve  
  
I take back the life that I gave you  
I take back all my fucking money too  
I take back everything except the part  
Where I said we were through  
  
Im taking back all the flowers that I gave you  
Im taking back all the dinners that I bought you  
Im taking back the time you stole my heart my soul  
Are you even listenin  
  
I take back all the shit I gave you  
I take back every word I said to you  
I take back everything except the part  
Where I said we were through  
  
I take back all the shit I gave you  
I take back every word I said to you  
I take back everything except the part  
Where I said we were through
