I tried so very hard not to cry  
I kept hanging around to forget all the good things  
We both used to do  
Time to remember the nights without you  
  
No no no one can take your place how I love  
I miss your embrace Im a prisoner of love  
Waiting for you its true  
Time to remember Im lost without you  
Time to remember the nights without you  
  
Oh lets get it together I know that youll soon understand  
Were wasting time cause loves hard to find  
Oh how could we both be so blind Oh babe  
  
Ive been losing control Ive been told  
But I I must touch your soul  
If I go out with you I dont mind if I do  
Time to remember Im lost without you  
  
I tried so very hard not to cry  
I kept hanging around to forget all the good things  
We both used to do  
Time to remember the nights without you  
  
No no no one can take your place how I love  
I miss your embrace Im a prisoner of love waiting for you its true  
Time to remember Im lost without you  
Time to remember the nights without you  
Time to remember the nights without you
