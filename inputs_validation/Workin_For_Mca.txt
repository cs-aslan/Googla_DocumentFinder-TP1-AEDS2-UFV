Seven years of hard luck comin down on me  
From the Florida border yeah up to Nashville Tennessee  
I worked in every joint you can name mister every honky tonk  
Along come Mr Yankee Slicker sayin maybe youre what I want  
  
Chorus  
Want you to sign your contract  
Want you to sign today  
Gonna give you lots of money  
Workin For MCA  
  
Nine thousand dollars thats all we could win  
But we smiled at the Yankee Slicker with a big ol Southern grin  
Theyre gonna take me out to California  
Gonna make me a superstar  
Just pay me all of my money  
And mister maybe you wont get a scar  
  
Chorus  
  
Suckers took my money since I was seventeen  
If it aint no pencil pusher it got to be a honky tonk queen  
But Ill sign my contract baby and I want you people to know  
That every penny that I make Im gonna see where my money goes  
  
Chorus
