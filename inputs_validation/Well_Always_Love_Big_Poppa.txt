Well always love Big Poppa Yeah  
Well always love Big Poppa Well always love you Big  
  
I look in the clouds hope you past the sun  
Hope you right next to God and he calling you Son  
Taking you in Angels breaking you in  
This is heaven and no longer do you have to sin  
And may God bless your mom and your two children  
Your wife your family and all your friends  
Everybody stay strong the good die young  
Where we from its all wrong we all confused  
Never know what we have til what we have we lose  
Think Big we just lost a very big jewel  
Hiphop itself is at a pitstop itself  
Seeing Big die I wish the shit would stop itself  
It hurts youre probably too good for this earth  
Genius at his work  
Made dirty cats wanna get a clean shirt  
Pop Cristal and rock they ice work word go Big go Big  
Everybody wanted to know Big  
Made the rap biz glitter like showbiz  
Ask anybody who could flow Big  
All the cats shined but you would glow Big  
Frank White lyrically moved niggaz spiritually  
Made you wanna get a cup fill it up with Hennessee  
Front in the club and light a dutch where the women be  
If you seen the show then I know you felt the energy  
  
Well always love Big Poppa Well always love you Big repeat 8X  
  
Just to let yall know everything is all real  
But its sad when a good fella catch a raw deal  
And pain is a part of life that we all feel  
Today this whole rap game is getting more ill  
It make me look back to where he took rap  
Dude brought the East back yall better believe that  
He never had a warning One More Chance  
Was right before him everybody must answer when Gods callin  
I flew Bs wit him I blew trees wit him  
Couldnt wait to go on tour across seas wit him  
People seem to get lost and blow things out of proportion  
Life is worth more than the coffin  
I need answers and they better be the truth  
Hurts like a bad tooth we losin mad youth  
Lyrically therell never be no one above you  
And no matter how they judge you we always gonna love you  
  
Well always love Big Poppa Well always love you Big repeat 4X  
  
Right now I know you missin it smokin in peace  
After all this bullshit dont cease huh Big  
Right now you and Pac in harmony probably huggin  
While everybody from Brooklyn to West coast is buggin  
All these gang wars Big show me a sign  
As for your son Ima raise Shorty like he was mine no doubt  
It seems that the devil got his stinkin back whooped  
And we should pray for Jesus and ask for forgiveness  
I can remember all the studio time getting twisted  
Bottle after bottle Bacardi Lime I miss it  
We clicked like heels when we first met the  
Junior Mafia and Big Poppa  
Nearly broke down four times writin this verse  
Filled with wild madness and sadness it hurts  
But aint no need to cry cause right now where you at  
Is more laced than any place a millionaire lived at  
But its sad that it takes that for us to unite  
The only time you see your family is funeral night  
Christopher Wallace Frank White holdin it down  
I guess you with the real king in New York now  
For real  
  
Well always love Big Poppa Well always love you Big repeat 6X  
Well always love Big Poppa Big Poppa repeat 2X  
Well always love Big Poppa Big Poppa Well always love you Big  
Well always love Big Poppa Big Poppa Well always love you Big  
Well always love Big Poppa Big Poppa Big Poppa  
Well always love you Big
