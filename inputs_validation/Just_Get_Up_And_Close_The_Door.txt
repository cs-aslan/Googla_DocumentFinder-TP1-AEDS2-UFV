How can I be sure youre being honest with me can I take your love for truth  
There comes a time in every womans life when she needs a little proof  
So show me something different something I aint never seen before  
This time instead of gettin up and goin home to her just get up and close
the door  
Just get up and close the door  
And say youll stay with me tonight say you wont regret the morning light  
Then Ill believe the words of love youve said to me before  
If youll just get up and close the door  
This time instead of gettin up and goin home to her just get up and close
the door
