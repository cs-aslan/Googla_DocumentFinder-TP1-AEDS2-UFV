Anytime you rise Im here  
And Im crazy for you pink thing  
You make me want to laugh  
You make me want to cry  
When I stroke your head I feel a hundred heartbeats high  
Pink thing  
  
I want to take you out and show you round the world  
Pink thing itll be OK  
If I could only wake you from your slumber curled  
Pink thing what would straight folks say  
  
That man isnt fit to enter heaven  
That man is a sinner  
Ever burning in disgrace  
Pink thing spit in my face  
Id love you for it  
  
Anytime you call Ill fall  
Into madness for you pink thing  
You make me want to live  
You make me want to die  
And when I stroke your head I feel a hundred heartbeats high  
Pink thing  
  
I want to take you out and show you to the girls  
Pink thing theyre a whole new tribe  
If you could only see the way the way the gingham swirls  
Pink thing its a whole new vibe  
  
That man isnt fit to be a father  
That man is a sinner  
Fore they cast me down to die  
Pink thing spit in my eye  
Id love you for it  
Yes Id love you for it  
  
Anytime you rise Im here  
And Im crazy for you pink thing  
You make me want to laugh  
You make me want to cry  
When I stroke your head I feel a hundred heartbeats high  
Pink thing  
Hundred heartbeats high  
Pink thing  
Hundred heartbeats high  
  
I want to introduce you  
Take you to the brink thing  
I want to introduce you  
Tell me what you think thing I want to introduce you  
Make that missing link thing  
Dont you think its time you met some female pink thing  
  
You make me want to laugh  
You make me want to cry  
So why is it Im happy when theres tears down in your eye  
  
Little pink thing
