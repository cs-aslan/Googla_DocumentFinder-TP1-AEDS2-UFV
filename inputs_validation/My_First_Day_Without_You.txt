Gettin up was the first mistake I made today  
Maybe if Id stayed in bed I wouldnt hurt this way  
For now Ill have to face the world admit that were all through  
And begin my first day without you  
  
Goin out was the next mistake I made today  
I tried to find a place to hide to pass a time away  
I knew I couldnt stand to see someone we once knew  
All alone my first day without you  
  
Goin home was the last mistake I made today  
Hes gone and now youre all alone the silence seems to say  
A million lonely nights to all I can look forward to  
As I end my first day without you as I end my first day without you
