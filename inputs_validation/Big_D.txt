Stranded here in Dallas cold and hungry I aint got a dime  
Sleepin in the filty trainyard at the warmest driest place that I can find  
What have I done that would justify the way you treatin me Big D  
Stranded here in Dallas cold and hungry I dont know a soul  
I could feel a little warmer but I find that theres no coat in my woredraw  
My clothesre paper thin still you let your chill of winter fall on me Big D  
 guitar   
Why I wanna go where the winds dont blow till summer  
Somewhere the sun will warm this chill in me  
Stranded here in Dallas cold and hungry I dont even know my name  
Oh my temperature keeps risin and I feel that its done damage to my brain  
Could this dirty trainyard be the last and final restin place for me Big D
Big D
