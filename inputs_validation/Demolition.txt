I spy with my little eye  
Anything here that I can buy  
I see a little thatched cottage  
Looking so neat  
With compulsory purchase we can buy it up cheap  
Then well pull up the floor boards  
Knock down the walls  
Rock the foundations  
Until the house falls  
Like a pack of cards  
Crashing to the ground  
Then well build a row  
Of identical boxes  
And sell them all off at treble the profits  
Demolition  
  
The deeds are in my pocket  
Ive got a contract in my hand  
An opportunity for luxury living  
Ill arrange the mortgage  
To be repaid a hundred percent  
I cant wait around so make your decision  
Well buy up all the cottages  
And every house and every street  
Until weve got everything we need  
Every town in the vicinity  
Every farm and village green  
Were gonna buy up everything  
Then its Demolition  
Demolition Demolition  
  
Two up two down  
It hasnt got a garden  
But its got a lovely patio  
Stainless steel kitchen sink  
Gas fired central heating  
Whaaa  specifically designed for modernday living  
Nothings permanent and nothing lasts  
Weve sold all the houses so put em up fast  
Were gonna buy up this town  
And pull it all down  
How I love to hear the demolition sound  
Of concrete crashing to the ground  
Demolition  
  
Its time to make some money  
Its time to get rich quick  
Its the wonderful world of capitalism  
Ive got to make a profit  
Ive got to satisfy my greed  
Its my faith and my religion  
Demolition Demolition Demolition  
And we
