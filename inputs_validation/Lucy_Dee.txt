Ive been sittin here talkin at you all night long  
Now honey you still come off cool  
Well you could have walked away instead youre leadin me on  
Lucy who you tryin to fool  
  
Yeah Lucy Dee  
You aint got to run that line on me  
Well its plain to see  
That you aint all that youre made out to be  
Well you can tell all your friends  
That you finally met your equal Lucy Dee  
  
Youve known all along just what Im talkin about  
Well you knew someday thered come a man  
Who wouldnt keep on givin til he finally gave out  
Lucy honey here I stand  
  
Well you tell me youve known every thrill there is to know  
And nothin in this life comes free nothin  
Well you tell me youve been every way there is to go  
Lucy you aint been with me  
  
Poor Lucy Dee
