Damn it feels good to be back  
Im having a relapse  
  
How the hell did he manage  
To get more felony charges  
Hes already got life in jail  
Man what the hell is his problem  
  
Well to be honest the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic  
They compelled me  
To kill this elderly man  
  
And I get these panic attacks  
Pop a xanax relax  
Try to stick my fucking dick  
Inside a mannequins ass  
  
Then I get manic depressed  
And the orthodontist get gas masked  
Kick ass  
The first thing Ill put on is the mask  
  
Speaking of masks man  
It aint to late to have a change of pace  
And take it off and show my face  
So you can see the things you face  
And slice you up  
And cook you after your murder  
By strangulation  
  
thats bacon souffle  
You making aint you  
Well thank you jason  
  
There goes one more coma  
Due to blunt force trauma  
Just give me one more soma  
And Ill be done for it mama  
  
Go in the damn broom closet  
Another valium lost it  
Shovin the vacuums nozzle  
Down the bathroom faucet  
  
It seems like every day I get a little flakier  
The medication is making my hands a little shakier  
Hand me that 18 month old baby  
To shake him up  
Itll only take me a second to choke his trachea  
Breaking his neck in 80 some places  
  
Baby here shady comes lady  
Hes got the razor bablades and the chachachainsawsaw baby  
You bebeblundering bumbling mmmumbling dumm dumms  
Yeah here I come come you hear the rumbling vrum vrum  
  
theres something inside of that blue tarp  
And that drum drum  
A head and torso of someone  
Whered it come from  
  
Whos it belong to  
Maybe that girl with the long blond hair  
Who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom poms  
Clearly theres somen wrong  
Cause she didnt come home  
  
shes missing  
Where is she  
Something fishy is going on  
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs  
  
Now everybody get your dance on  
To my damn song  
Cmon
