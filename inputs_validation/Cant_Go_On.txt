Ive been feeling sentimental  
In a melancholy way  
Blues siting on my shoulder  
Getting heavier every day  
  
Staring into space  
One thing on my mind  
Ive been trying to drown  
The thought of you  
By drinking too much wine  
  
Then my imagination  
Starts running wild  
I snap my fingers  
And youre there by my side  
  
Cant go on without your love  
Theres no song without your love  
Aint no reason aint no rhyme  
Without your love  
Ill go out of my mind  
  
Been getting too lazy  
Letting myself go  
Feeling like a refugee  
No one cares for anymore  
Endless lonely days  
I just try to get through  
And theres no escape  
Even when I sleep  
Cause all I dream is you  
  
Then my imagination  
Gets the better of me  
Cause youre everywhere I go  
In everything I see  
  
I cant go on without you love  
Theres no song without your love  
There aint no reason there aint no rhyme  
Without your love  
Ill go out of my mind  
  
You make me dance  
You make me sing  
When Im with you  
I can do anything  
When Im cold  
You keep me warm  
And give me shelter  
From the howling storm  
  
There aint no reason there aint no rhyme  
Without your love  
Ill go out of my mind  
  
Cant go on without your love  
Theres no song without your love
