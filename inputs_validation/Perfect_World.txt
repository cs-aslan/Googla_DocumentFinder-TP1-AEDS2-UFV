Well I know what it is  
But I dont know where it is  
Where it is  
Well I know where it is  
But I dont know what it looks like  
What it looks like  
Well I know what it looks like  
But I dont know where she comes from  
Well I know where she comes from  
But I dont know whats her name  
  
Chorus  
and she said This is a perfect world  
Im riding on an incline  
Im staring in your face  
Youll photograph mine  
  
And Ive been walking talking  
Believing the things that are true  
And Ive been finding  
The difference between right and wronggood and bad  
See me put things together  
Put them back where they belong  
Am I just like the others  
Have I always been singing the same song  
  
Chorus  
  
Somebody said that it happens all over the world  
I do believe that its true  
And the suns coming up  
And were doing all the things that we should  
Doesnt everybody here believe in the things we do  
  
And she said  
  
Chorus  
  
Its a strange situation  
Whats wrong with you  
Babybabybaby  
What you doing in my house  
And its all true  
Theres nothing wrong with you  
And I said  
  
Chorus
