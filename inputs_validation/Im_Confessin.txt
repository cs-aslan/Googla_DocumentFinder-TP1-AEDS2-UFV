Im confessin that I love you  
Tell me do you love me too  
Im confessin that I need you  
Honest I do need you every moment  
In your eyes I read such strange things  
But your lips deny theyre true  
Will your answer really change things  
Making me blue  
Im afraid someday youll leave me  
Say n cant we still be friends  
If you go you know youll grieve me  
All in life on you depends  
Am I guessin that you love me  
Dreamin dreams of you in vain  
Im confessin that I love you  
Over again  
Im afraid someday youll leave me  
Say n cant we still be friends  
If you go you know youll grieve me  
All in life on you depends  
Am I guessin that you love me  
Dreamin dreams of you in vain  
Im confessin that I love you  
Over again
