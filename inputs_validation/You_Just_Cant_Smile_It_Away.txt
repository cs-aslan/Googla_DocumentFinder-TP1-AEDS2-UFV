You just cant smile it away  
Its much more than passion its love  
And Ive heard some people say  
Theyve seen love move mountains  
  
You just cant laugh it away  
Its too deep inside its love  
Not just some game you can play  
For a laugh then go on your way  
  
Lets sit and talk it over  
And work it out I love you so  
And cant we just talk it over  
And see what we can do  
  
You cant just pass it away  
Like some silly fashion no its love  
And love comes eager to stay  
It wont just leave you that way  
  
You cant just pass it away  
Like some silly fashion no its love  
And Ive heard some people say  
Theyve seen love move mountains no its love  
And Ive heard some people say  
Theyve seen love move mountains
