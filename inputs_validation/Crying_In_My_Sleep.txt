Breaking up  
Is breaking my heart  
Is showing me the door  
And if I get it open  
Ill discover that theres much more to life than this  
As I hit the wall with the full force of my fist  
I concede this time to defeat  
I keep crying in my sleep  
Dear boy poor boy  
I keep crying in my sleep  
  
Breaking up  
Is making me see  
Inside myself again  
And if I can keep looking  
Inside then I might change the things that I fear  
It keeps my heart awake and stops the tears  
My nights are incomplete  
I keep crying in my sleep  
  
The sound of her voice  
The sound of her words  
I hear every breath  
Each whisper is heard  
But its so hard now  
Now she is gone  
Everything I did I did wrong  
I keep crying in my sleep  
  
And if I turn full circle  
Perhaps Ill see that the road ahead is clear  
When the world thats on my shoulder disappears  
At night the footsteps creak  
I keep crying in my sleep
