The sun is fading in the west  
Out where the cattle roam  
Im like a bird at the end of the day  
Flying to my home  
Im flying to my home sweet majesty  
Im flying to my home  
  
The sky is like a painted flag  
Above a sea of chrome  
Ive got a woman living in my life  
Living in my home  
Im flying to my home sweet majesty  
Im flying to my home  
  
I havent been back for so long  
I dont know if Im going to recognise it  
They gave the old place a new face  
And Im going to take some time  
To size the situation up
