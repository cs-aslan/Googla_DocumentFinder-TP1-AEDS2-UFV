It wasnt very long ago that he held me so close  
But the little love he had has died for me who loved him most  
He left me for another and didnt say goodbye  
And if youre next to love him then youll be next to cry  
Get set for a heartache thats all I can say  
Get set for a heartache on its way  
 fiddle  steel   
Hell make you think he loves you too but youll find its not true  
Youll learn that when you need him most hell be with someone new  
Your love will all be wasted thats how it was with me  
And soon heartaches will tell you youre just his used to be  
Get set for a heartache thats all I can say  
Get set for a heartache on its way
