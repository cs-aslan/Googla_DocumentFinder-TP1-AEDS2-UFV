Dear Mr Fantasy play us a tune something to make us all feel happy  
Do anything to take keep us out of this gloom  
Sing a song play guitar make us happy  
  
You are the one who makes us feel glad  
Please dont be sad to take up the straight life you had  
We wouldnt have known you all these years  
  
Dear Mr Fantasy play us a tune something to treat us happy  
Do anything to take keep us out of this gloom  
Sing a song play guitar make us happy
