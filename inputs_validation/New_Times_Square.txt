Ill see you round about midnight  
You know I wont be late  
Lets dive into this crap house  
And truth hell have to wait  
  
The truth of what has gone before  
Lies bleeding on the floor  
The only truth remaining still  
Is that truth dont matter anymore  
  
So meet me round about midnight  
I wont let you down I swear  
Well hang on to each other  
Down at the new Times Square  
  
It seems that we cant run from this  
No matter how we try  
Theres nothing here worth keeping  
So lets kiss it all goodbye  
  
Tell me whats worth keeping anyway  
It doesnt seem to matter  
What we do or what we say  
Everything we had  
They have now taken it all away  
The truth dont matter anymore
