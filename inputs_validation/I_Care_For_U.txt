Im saying I care but is like you dont hear me  
What more could I do  
  
Girl you can keep that trying to make me jealous  
I admit that Ive been careless  
But we cant take back whats done  
I know why you did that  
Youre frustrated cause I dont react  
Maybe you want some feedback  
Cause normally my feelings dont show  
  
But baby I care for you  
By now you should know that I care for you  
You say my actions never show it  
And I wear my heart on my sleeve  
But what you gets what you see  
The truth is girl underneath  
Gotta believe that I care for you  
Baby I care for you  
I I I I care  
I I I I care for you  
  
Everyday Im tryna prove myself to you  
But whats the point  
No such thing as satisfying you  
Maybe youll appreciate it later  
By the time Im gone  
Better get your act together  
Dont wait too long  
Dont wanna change what we have  
So what do we had  
Girl I need you to know  
  
That I care for you  
By now you should now that I care for you  
You say my actions never show it  
And I wear my heart on my sleeve  
But what you gets what you see  
The truth is girl underneath  
Gotta believe that I care for you  
Baby I care for you  
I I I I care  
I I I I care for you I do  
  
Gotta believe it  
Gotta believe it

You know I care  
You should know be better by now  
  
Girl I care for you  
By now you should now that I care for you  
You say my actions never show it  
Dont wear my heart on my sleeve
