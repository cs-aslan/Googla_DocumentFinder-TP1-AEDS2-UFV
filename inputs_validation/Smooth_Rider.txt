Last night no way  
I was gonna be left hungry  
Then your daddy caught me sneaking out your bed  
Its just a game I play  
Its just a roll that way  
These things sweet baby  
Are messing with your head  
  
Im a smooth rider baby  
You know I just keep moving on  
Dont know why I like to carry on  
The way i do  
Its just that Im in love with you  
  
If you see me out there runnin  
And you hear the sheriffs comin  
Your daddys crazy with that gun in his hand  
If you know theyre comin for me  
And you know theyre runnin for me  
You my love wont let them keep me away  
  
Im a smooth rider baby  
You know I just keep movin on  
Dont know why I like to carry on  
The way I do  
Its just that Im in love with you  
  
If you see me out there runnin  
And you hear the sheriffs comin  
Your daddys crazy with that gun in his hand  
If you know theyre comin for me  
And you know theyre runnin for me  
You my love wont let them keep me away  
  
Im a smooth rider baby
