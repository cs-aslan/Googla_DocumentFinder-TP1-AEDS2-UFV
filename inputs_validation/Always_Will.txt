VERSE  
Where I go  
You will go  
You never leave me  
When Im lost  
Theres always hope  
  
In every high  
In every low  
Youre standing next to me  
In the fire  
Theres always hope  
  
PRECHORUS  
I will lift my eyes  
Let my heart cry out  
Youre alive  
Alive  
  
With an anthem we raise  
Up our voice proclaim  
Youre alive  
Alive  
  
CHORUS  
Your love keeps chasing me  
And it always will  
It always will  
Your grace keeps changing me  
And it always will  
It always will  
  
You gave Your life away  
Once and for all  
Once and for all  
Forever You will reign  
And You always will  
You always will  
  
VERSE  
In my joy  
In my pain  
Youre right beside me  
In Your arms  
Theres always hope  
  
When I fall  
You are there  
Your mercy will catch me  
All my hope  
In Christ alone
