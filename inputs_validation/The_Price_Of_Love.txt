Wine is sweet and gin is bitter  
Drink all you can but you wont forget her  
You talk too much you laugh too loud  
You see her face in every crowd  
  
Thats the price of love the price of love  
A debt you pay with tears and pain  
The price of love the price of love  
It costs you more when youre to blame  
  
Kiss one girl kiss another  
Kiss them all but you wont recover  
Youre dancing slow youre dancing fast  
Youre happy now but that wont last  
  
Thats the price of love the price of love  
A debt you pay with tears and pain  
The price of love the price of love  
It costs you more when youre to blame
