I thought Id write to Juliets for she would understand  
And when someone is already dead they can no longer let you down  
Instead I find myself talking to you as my oldest friend  
Tell me how I can advise someone that I dont even know  
To welcome death  
  
For I received a letter that is worth reporting  
And though it may raise a cynical smile  
It leaves a sinking feeling  
Like when a soldier in a story says to the sergeant  
Have you seen my pride and joy  
You know the restand its no jokeforgive me please as I quote  
This is a letter of thanks as Im so bored here in I cant say where  
So Im writing to people that I may never meet  
And I was thinking if something you said  
  
Im a female soldier my name is Constance  
I enlisted in the military needing funds for college  
Im twentythree years old and if I do get home alive  
I imagine I may think again  
  
Im sleeping with my eyes open for fear of attack  
Your words are a comfort theyre the best thing that I have  
Apart from family pictures and of course my gas mask  
I dont know why I am writing to you
