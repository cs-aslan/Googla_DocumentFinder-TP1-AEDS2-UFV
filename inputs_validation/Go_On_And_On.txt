On and on  
On and on  
  
She broke my heart he hurt me too  
Thats something that only unworthy souls do  
  
They said goodbye we say hello  
An introduction for a perfect love to grow  
  
Lets stop thinking about the past  
And start thinking about the future  
So that love can go on and on  
Lets stop thinking about the past  
And start thinking about the future  
So that love can go on and on  
  
She said shed stay he said that too  
So sad when you find out your love has found a new  
  
She made me cry he made me weep  
But life has love in store for us thats ooh so sweet  
  
On and on love keeps going on  
On and on theyve got the whole of life  
On and on love keeps going on  
On and  
  
Its time to say goodbye to crying eyes and broken dreams  
And get back to the joy that to each other we will bring  
That starts from summer love to last through autumn winter spring  
Our hearts will sing forever love
