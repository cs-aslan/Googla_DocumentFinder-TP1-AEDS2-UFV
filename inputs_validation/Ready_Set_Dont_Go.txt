Shes gotta do what shes gotta do  
And Ive gotta like it or not  
Shes got dreams too big for this town  
And she needs to give em a shot  
Whatever they are  
  
Looks like Im all ready to leave  
And nothing left to pack  
Aint no room for me in that car  
Even if she asked me to tag along  
God I gotta be strong  
  
Im at the startin line of the rest of my life  
As ready as Ive ever been  
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes  
The prize is mine to win  
  
Shes waitin on my blessings  
Before she hits that open road  
But baby get ready oh Im ready get set dont go  
  
Looks like things are fallin in place  
Feels like theyre fallin apart  
I painted this big old smile on my face  
To hide my broken heart  
If only she knew  
  
This is where you dont say  
What you want so bad to say  
This is where I want to  
But I wont get in the way  
Of her and her dreams  
And spreadin her wings  
  
Im at the startin line of the rest of my life  
As ready as Ive ever been  
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes  
The prize is mine to win  
  
Shes waitin on my blessings  
Before she hits that open road  
But baby get ready get set dont go  
  
Im at the startin line of the rest of my life  
As ready as Ive ever been  
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes  
The prize is mine to win  
  
Shes waitin on my blessings  
Before she hits that open road  
But baby get ready get set please dont go  
  
Dont go dont go now  
Mmm dont go  
Ill be all right Ill be ok  
Incomprehensible  
Thinking of you each and every day  
Shes gotta do what shes gotta do
