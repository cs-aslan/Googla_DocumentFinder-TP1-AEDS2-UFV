Can I believe my ears  
Is this really you  
Pacing the floor with one eye on the door  
Watching the winners go through  
Why do you hang back now  
Why dyou hesitate  
You fires dont burn  
For he who waits  
  
Out of all of the people  
That I ever knew  
If one should have made it  
It should have been you  
  
I know who Im looking for  
But I dont believe my eyes  
The sight of you with your head hung low  
Is a sick sad surprise  
Why do you hang back now  
Why dyou hesitate  
How dare you throw it all away then tell me  
Aw man it must be fate  
  
Out of all of the people  
That I ever knew  
There had to one I could believe in  
And it should have been you  
  
A gift that dies is a tragic thing  
And it happens all the time  
But a gift thats wasted thrown to hell is the  
Worst of stupid crimes  
I saw you hang back now  
I watched you hesitate  
Youre a well respected man but bullshit  
You couldve been great  
  
Out of all the people  
I ever knew  
There should have been one  
And it should have been you  
  
I spent my whole life  
Looking for someone like you
