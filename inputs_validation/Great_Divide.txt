Keep on looking find a way out  
Get a hold on hoping scream and shout  
A new addiction another show  
Truth and fiction well I did not know  
  
Chorus  
I didnt know you and you didnt know me  
Broken branches and a family tree  
Blown over this wind is wide  
A lone loners and our great divide  
  
Running forward warning signs  
Looking backward at the yellow lines  
All the great suggestions and the horoscope  
Stubborn lessons and we could not cope  
  
Chorus  
  
And I know its not forever  
This time its not the same  
Why cant we live together  
And share more than a name  
  
In the name of friendship and the mask of love  
Careful not to trip on the kid gloves  
Or the cooking apron and the wedding gown  
Fabric so thin that it ties us down  
  
Chorus
