I wasnt jealous before we met  
Now every woman I see is a potential threat  
And Im possessive it isnt nice  
Youve heard me saying that smoking was my only vice  
But now it isnt true  
Now everything is new  
And all Ive learned has overturned  
I beg of you  
  
Dont go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
Dont go sharing your devotion  
  
It was like shooting a sitting duck  
A little smalltalk a smile and baby I was stuck  
I still dont know what youve done with me  
A grownup woman should never fall so easily  
I feel a kind of fear  
When I dont have you near  
Unsatisfied I skip my pride  
I beg you dear  
  
Dont go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Dont go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
Ive had a few little love affairs  
They didnt last very long and theyve been pretty scarce  
I used to think I was sensible  
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible  
Cause everything is new  
And everything is you  
And all Ive learned has overturned  
What can I do  
  
Dont go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Dont go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me
