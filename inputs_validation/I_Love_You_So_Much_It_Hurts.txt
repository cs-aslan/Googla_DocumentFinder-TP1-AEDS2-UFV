I love you so much it hurts me  
Darlin thats why Im so blue  
Im so afraid to go to bed at night  
Im afraid of losing you  
  
I love so much it hurts me  
And theres nothing I can do  
I want to hold you my dear forever and ever  
I love you so much it hurts me so  
  
I love you so much it hurts me  
And theres nothing I can do  
I want to hold you my dear forever and ever  
I love you so much it hurts me so
