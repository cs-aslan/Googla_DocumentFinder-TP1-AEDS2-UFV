I know just how much I love you  
But there is no time to explain  
I realize just what Id give to  
Get you back in my arms  
  
And I see you hand in hand with another man  
And I dont know what you see in him and why you let us go  
  
So if youre gonna lie  
At least you could just let us die  
And if youre gonna cry to me baby  
At least you could just say goodbye  
  
And Im caught between myself and me  
And I cant find the bridge  
From my mind to reality  
Im trying to find a place in the sun  
But Im drowning in the rain  
Thats falling every place I run  
  
And I see you hand in hand with another man  
And I dont know what you see in him and why you let us go  
  
So if youre gonna lie  
At least you could just let us die  
And if youre gonna cry to me baby  
At least you could just say goodbye  
  
Well Im not gonna sit around just waiting for you to get overhim  
So oh no no no  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye now  
  
Well if youre gonna lie  
Well at least you could just let us die  
And if youre gonna cry to me baby  
At least you could just said goodbye  
  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Wont you say goodbye  
Wont you say goodbye now  
Wont you say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye now  
  
Wont you kiss me goodbye  
Youve gotta tell me goodbye  
  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now
