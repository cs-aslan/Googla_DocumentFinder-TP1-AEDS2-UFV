You already made up your mind  
Just who youre looking for and what kind of love youll find  
Holding out for a dream  
But I can see youre lonely living isnt only a fantasy  
  
I dont fit into your plans but you can reach for my hands  
  
Tomorrow doesnt matter tonight Im holding you and it feels so right  
I know you didnt plan it this way let yourself go if you want to stay  
Its all right cause tomorrow doesnt matter tonight  
  
Really hate to see you confused  
I want no promises so what have you got to lose  
When you look in my eyes  
Dont think about tomorrow this feeling isnt meant to be analyzed  
  
Why should you be all alone til your heart finds a home  
  
Tomorrow doesnt matter tonight Im holding you and it feels so right  
I know you didnt plan it this way let yourself go if you want to stay  
Its all right cause tomorrow doesnt matter tonight  
  
Tomorrow doesnt matter tonight tomorrow Let yourself go  
Tomorrow doesnt matter tonight tomorrow  
  
Tomorrow doesnt matter tonight Im holding you and it feels so right  
I know you didnt plan it this way let yourself go if you want to stay  
Its all right  
  
Tomorrow doesnt matter at all Im holding you and it feels so right  
I know you didnt plan it this way let yourself go if you want to stay  
Its all right tomorrow doesnt matter tonight  
  
Tonight
