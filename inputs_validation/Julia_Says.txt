And here I go again through the back streets of my mind  
It seems my life was standing still  
Whos sorry now sorry now  
Its funny how I didnt notice  
  
Here we go again fighting things we never win  
It seems our love was standing still  
Oh Im sorry now sorry now  
Its funny how funny how  
I dont feel the love  
I just hear the words  
  
Julia says  
She doesnt know what its all about  
She doesnt seem to care at all  
Open your eyes and see  
Love hurts  
  
I wont be fooled again  
Looking for the dream I couldnt find  
The dream for me was left behind  
Woh Im sorry now sorry now  
Its funny how funny how  
I dont feel the love  
I just hear the words  
  
Julia says  
She doesnt know what its all about  
She doesnt seem to care at all  
Open your eyes and see love hurts  
Julia please open your eyes and see  
  
Julia wants to be on her own  
Sharing her thoughts she is all alone  
Dreaming of the things she wants to be  
Where Julia dont belong  
  
Julia says  
She doesnt know what its all about  
She doesnt know  
Julia please open your eyes see  
Cmon Julie open your eyes and see  
She dont know what its all about  
Julia please Julia please  
Julia you dont care at all  
Cause I want you  
Cmon cmon cmon cmon  
Julie Julie Julie
