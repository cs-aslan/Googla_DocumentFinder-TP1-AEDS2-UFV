One day a mother  
Come to a prison  
To see an erring  
But precious son  
She told the warden  
How much she loved him  
It did not matter  
What he had done  
  
Chorus  
She did not bring to him  
Bring to him  
Parole or pardon  
Pardon free  
She brought no silver  
Brought no gold  
No pomp nor style  
Him to see  
It was a halo  
Halo bright  
Sent down from heaven  
Heavens light  
The sweetest gift  
A mothers smile  
  
Her boy had wandered  
Far from the far side  
Though she had pleaded  
With him each night  
But not a word did  
She ever utter  
That told her heartaches  
Her smile was bright  
  
Chorus  
  
She left a smile  
You can remember  
Shes gone to heaven  
From heartaches free  
Them bars around you  
Will never change her  
He was her baby  
An error will be  
  
Chorus  
  
It was a halo bright  
Sent down from heavens light  
The sweetest gift  
A mothers smile
