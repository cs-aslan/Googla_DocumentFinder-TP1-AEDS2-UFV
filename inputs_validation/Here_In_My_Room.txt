This party is old and uninviting  
Participants in black and white  
You enter in fullblown technicolor  
Nothing is the same after tonight  
  
If the world would fall apart  
In a fictionworthy wind  
I wouldnt change a thing  
Now that youre here  
  
Love is a verb  
Here in my room Repeat x3  
Your love is a verb  
Here in my room Repeat x3  
  
You enter and close the door behind you  
Now show me the world seen from the stars  
If only the lights would dim on winter  
Im wary of eyes upon the skies  
  
If the world would fall apart  
In a fictionworthy wind  
I wouldnt change a thing  
Now that youre here  
  
Love is a verb  
Here in my room Repeat x3  
Your love is a verb  
Here in my room Repeat x3  
  
Tractor beam into your incision  
Spinning as free  vicious world  
I came here expecting next to nothing  
So thank you for being that kind of girl  
Kind of girl Repeat x10
