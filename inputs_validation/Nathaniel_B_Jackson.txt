Make up your mind what you want  
Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
You can see that Im sorry  
For runnin round with someone new  
But I know you dont mean it  
And mister till I think you do  
You can keep al your hugs  
Dont want your kisses  
You had to many tries  
And too many misses  
  
Make up your mind what you want  
Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
If you think that Im greedy  
For wanting you all to myself  
Well youre right yes indeedy  
I wont share your love with no one else  
And if you think  
That your lies are gonna hurt me  
Well you just think again  
Cause you dont know me  
  
Make up your mind what you want  
Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
You make me think everything is ok  
Then you go out and play the field  
And make me play the fool  
  
Go and say that youre sorry  
I cant live on apologies  
If you want all my loving  
Then there will have to be some guarantees  
Say youll settle down and in addition  
Say that youll eliminate the competition  
  
Make up your mind what you want  
Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
This time I mean what I say  
Hey  
Nathaniel B Jackson
