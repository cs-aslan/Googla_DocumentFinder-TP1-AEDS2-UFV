I want you  
Try to forget her  
In your heart  
You know that shell never  
Love you love you love you  
  
I want you  
Try to forget her  
She wont call  
Or write you a letter  
Of love love loves proof  
  
I want you  
Try to forget her  
Give her time  
And youll wait forever  
For love love loves proof  
  
Its not in the stars  
Its all in the proof  
The chances the odds  
The one you love will love  
And fall for you  
And fall for you  
  
I want you  
Try to forget her  
You think shes good  
Ill be better  
And love you love you love you
