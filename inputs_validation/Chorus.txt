Go ahead with your dreamin  
For what its worth  
Or youll be stricken bound  
Kickin up dirt  
For when its dark  
You never know what the night it may bring  
  
Go ahead with your schemin  
And shop at home  
Youll find treasure  
While cookin up bones  
But the knife is sharp  
Youd better watch that you dont cut your hands  
  
And they covered up the sun  
Until the birds had flown away  
And the fishes in the sea  
Had gone to sleep  
  
And they covered up the sun  
Until the birds had flown away  
And the fishes in the sea  
Had gone to sleep  
  
Go ahead with your dreamin  
For what its worth  
Or youll be stricken bound  
Kickin up dirt  
For when its dark  
You never know what the night it may bring  
  
Go ahead with your schemin  
And shop at home  
Youll find treasure  
While cookin up bones  
But the knife is sharp  
Youd better watch that you dont cut your hands  
  
And they covered up the sun  
Until the birds had flown away  
And the fishes in the sea  
Had gone to sleep  
  
And they covered up the sun  
Until the birds had flown away  
And the fishes in the sea  
Had gone to sleep  
  
Holy Moses our hearts are screaming  
Souls are lifting only dreaming  
Well be waiting some are praying  
For a time when no ones cheating  
  
The sunlight rising over the horizon  
Just a distant memory a dawn chorus  
Birds singing bells ringing  
In our hearts in our minds  
  
And they covered up the sun  
Until the birds had flown away  
And the fishes in the sea  
Had gone to sleep  
  
And they covered up the sun  
Until the birds had flown away  
And the fishes in the sea  
Had gone to sleep  
  
And they covered up the sun  
Until the birds had flown away  
And the fishes in the sea  
Had gone to sleep  
  
And they covered up the sun  
Until the birds had flown away  
And the fishes in the sea  
Had gone to sleep
