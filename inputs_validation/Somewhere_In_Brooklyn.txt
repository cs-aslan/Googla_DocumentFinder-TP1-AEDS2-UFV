She was covered in leather and gold  
Twenty one years old  
I lost her in the cold  
Its unfair shes out there  
  
Somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn  
Shes somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn  
  
Little miss perfect sitting at the train stop  
Red Nike high tops listening to hiphop  
While we were waiting started conversating  
Before I got her name along came a train  
  
uh next stop Brooklyn  
uh now Im lookin  
  
She was covered in leather and gold  
Twenty one years old  
I lost her in the cold  
Its unfair shes out there  
Somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn  
Shes somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn  
  
On the street kickin rocks circling the same block  
Green farm flat bush checking every corner shop  
Tappin peoples shoulders askin if they know her  
Everydays the same back to the train  
  
uh next stop Brooklyn  
uh Im still lookin  
  
She was covered in leather and gold  
Twenty one years old  
I lost her in the cold  
Its unfair shes out there  
Somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn  
Shes somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn  
  
Ohohohoh  
I wonder if well ever meet again  
Ohohohoh  
I wonder we well ever meet again  
Yeah I wonder if well meet again  
I hope we do somewhere in Brooklyn
