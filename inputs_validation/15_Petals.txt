Fifteen petals  
One for every year I spent with you  
Jewels and precious metals will never do  
  
I love you twisted  
And I love you straight  
Id write it down but I cant concentrate  
Words wont me obey they do as they please  
And all I am left with is these  
  
Fifteen petals  
One for every year I spent with you  
Jewels and precious metals will never do  
  
The thorn is blunted  
And the perfume will fade  
I stand where sun is set  
I crave the shade  
Down in the tavern with Mary and Joe  
Palms reached for alms as they throw  
  
Fifteen petals  
One for every hour that were apart  
Tears and useless battles  
Ill never start  
  
Mussolini highway  
Theres a frankincense tree  
I picked some up there to carry with me  
You take me to places where I never go  
I love you more than you know  
  
Fifteen petals  
Scattered in the path where you will tread  
Fifteen petals  
Of vivid red  
  
One winebar vamp with the polythene  
Ein Panzer Kommander with no hair in place  
The crooked battalions drilled holes in the square
