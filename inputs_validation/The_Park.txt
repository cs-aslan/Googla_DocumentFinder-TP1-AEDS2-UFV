Let me walk a while alone  
Among the sacred rocks and stones  
Let me look in vain belief  
Upon the beauty of each leaf  
  
There is green in every blade  
The tree tops lean providing shade  
Maypoles spin in happy sound  
All natures strength around  
  
And theres a horse that feels no pain  
Its iron strength to take the strain  
Children rock it to and fro  
And gaily drink its colourglow  
  
Above the sky devoid of cloud  
Thinks not to cast a thunder shroud  
Upon this place so full of joy  
A field of gold of loves employ  
  
So why my heavy heart You say  
When tears would stain  
The sights so gay  
My brothers dreams once here did soar  
Until he died at the hand  
Of needless war
