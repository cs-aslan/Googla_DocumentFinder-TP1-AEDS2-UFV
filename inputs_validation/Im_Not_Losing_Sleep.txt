Yes Ive read the morning papers  
Telling me that youve made money  
Do you think Im gonna crawl then think again  
  
Though Im dressed in rags Im richer  
Though I eat from tins Im healthier  
Though I live in slums Im purer than you my friend  
  
Too bad Im not losing sleep  
Too bad Im just counting sheep  
Too bad Im not losing sleep my friend  
  
Look around and see the friends  
The ones you left our friends deserted  
See the guys that used to talk and drink with you  
  
Dont look down your nose at me  
Cause I wont ask your sympathy  
I wont be your yessir man for anything  
  
Too bad Im not losing sleep  
Too bad Im just counting sheep  
Too bad Im not losing sleep my friend  
  
I would walk with you  
Talk with you drink with you  
If you drop that halo that youre wearing on the ground  
  
Too bad Im not losing sleep  
Too bad Im just counting sheep  
Too bad Im not losing sleep my friend  
  
I cant get my satisfaction  
Knowing you wont get reaction  
What makes me the big attraction anyway  
  
Its too bad Im not losing sleep  
Too bad Im just counting sheep  
Too bad Im not losing sleep my friend  
Too bad Im not losing sleep  
Too bad Im just counting sheep  
Too bad Im not losing sleep my friend  
Oh its too bad Im not losing sleep  
Too bad Im just counting sheep  
Too bad Im not losing sleep my friend
