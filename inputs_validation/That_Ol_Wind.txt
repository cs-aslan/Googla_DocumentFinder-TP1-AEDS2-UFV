She dropped her boy at school on time  
One less worry on her mind  
Now its off to work and on the radio  
Comes an old familiar song  
And then the DJs voice comes on  
And says hes back in town tonight for one last show  
  
Her eyes well up with tears  
God could it be its been ten years  
Since that Autumn night outside the county fair  
When two strangers shared a night  
And in the darkness found a light  
That to this day is still alive and burning there  
  
He asked her twice to come along  
They said goodbye at the break of dawn  
Cause you cant hold back the wind  
If its meant to be again  
Then someday hell find his way back to her arms  
  
The marquee misspelled his name  
And not too many people came  
But that didnt matter to them  
They laughed and loved all through the night  
And as they faced the morning light  
They found themselves standing there again  
  
And he asked her twice to come along  
They said goodbye at the break of dawn  
As his bus left out she cried  
With him standing by her side  
That ol wind had once again found its way home  
Someday hell tell her about the money he hid  
And someday shell tell him that the boy is his kid  
But for right now theyre both in love  
The only thing theyre thinkin of  
Is that theyre finally where their hearts have always been
