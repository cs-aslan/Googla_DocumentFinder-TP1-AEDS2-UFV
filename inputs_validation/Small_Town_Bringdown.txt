Been to Reno  
Drives an El Camino  
Can you dig that style  
  
Hip canteen  
You always make the scene  
Youre a crazy child  
  
Its a sad thing  
Bourbons all around  
To stop that feeling when youre living  
In a small town  
  
Youre long and lean  
But things dont get you down  
Youre a top ten kingpin in the borders  
Of youre hometown  
  
You cant get hip  
You work the jobs Ive quit  
Can you dig that style  
  
Wont admit  
You just dont give a shit  
Youre a crazy child  
  
Cant live to die  too easy  
Why stick around  
Not another small town hometown bringdown  
  
This is it  
You might as well get pissed  
Can you dig that style  
  
Make your trip  
There aint that much to miss  
Youre a crazy child
