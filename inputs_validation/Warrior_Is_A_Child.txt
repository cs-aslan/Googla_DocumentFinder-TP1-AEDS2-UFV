Lately Ive been winning battles left and right  
But even winners can get wounded in the fight  
People say that Im amazing  
Im strong beyond my years  
But they dont see inside of me  
Im hiding all the tears  
Chorus  
They dont know that I come running home when I fall down  
They dont know who picks me up when no one is around  
I drop my sword and cry for just a while  
Look up for His smile  
Coz deep inside this armor  
The warrior is a child  
Aahhh  
Unafraid because His arrow is the best  
But even soldiers need a quiet place to rest  
People say that Im amazing  
I never face retreat oh no  
But they dont see the enemies  
That lay me at His feet  
Chorus  
They dont know that I come running home when I fall down  
They dont know who picks me up when no one is around  
I drop my sword and cry for just a while  
Look up for His smile  
Coz deep inside this armor  
The warrior is a child  
Aahhh  
They dont know that I come running home when I fall down  
They dont know who picks me up when no one is around  
I drop my sword and cry for just a while  
Look up for His smile  
Coz deep inside this armor  
The warrior is a child  
Aahhh
