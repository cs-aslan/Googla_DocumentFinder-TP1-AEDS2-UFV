  
Darlin dont you know Ive had enough  
Wasting all my time  
Darlin put it on the line  
Cos I heard you lying time and time again  
Ooh and I dont want to any more  
This is where our loving has to end  
Darlin now you know the score  
So goodbye Baby  
  
Hey Mr Heartache how much can you fake  
How many hearts break before you get enough  
Hey Mr Heartache you dont give you just take  
I hope for your sake you dont turn your back on love  
  
Darlin dont know what youre looking for  
But Im not waiting around to see  
Darlin cant take any more  
I still love you but Im gonna set you free  
Ooh thats the way its got to be  
Cos I know I cant change you anyway  
Darlin theres nothing left to say  
But goodbye baby  
  
Hey Mr Heartache how much can you fake  
How many hearts break before you get enough  
Hey Mr Heartache you dont give you just take  
I hope for your sake you dont turn your back on love  
  
Listen to me so listen to me  
Ooh baby baby baby baby baby baby  
Cos I was stupid to believe  
You could give me what I need  
You use anyone you can  
Yet you call yourself a man  
Well seen through your disguise  
And its all that I despise  
Now youve just run out of time  
Go before I change my mind  
  
Hey Mr Heartache cos I love you baby  
Hey Mr Heartache I still love you baby  
  
I still love you but Im gonna set you free  
Ooh thats the way its got to be  
Cos I know I cant change you anyway  
Darlin theres nothing left to say  
But goodbye baby  
  
JuniorYou dont know what Im going through  
You got me wrong oh so wrong  
Think youve sown me up  
But youre so wrong  
I want you girl all the time  
Come on now  
You dont know what Im going through baby
