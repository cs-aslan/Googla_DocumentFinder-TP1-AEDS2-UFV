In the morning madness and the stabbing light  
She pours the coffee and she says  
What was wrong with you last night  
Dreams just dreams my love were half asleep  
But the headlines on tennis  
So it seems everythings all right  
Theres a girl from the Midwest with a pretty face  
Scratched where it itched they said it was a disgrace  
I dont want to go to work today  
want to stay at home and watch that girl play  
Do you like tennis  
Yes I do  
  
There are people in boats in the middle of the sea  
Crying and dying like Jews  
Do you like tennis  
Freedom is the man with the red grenade  
She ran out of gas got beat and raped  
Do you like tennis  
Well do you like tennis  
Yes I do
