You could leave tomorrow fly to Mandalay darling I would love you anyway  
I just couldnt help but care anytime anywhere  
You can keep me waiting every single day Ill be there to meet you anyway  
You make life a love affair anytime anywhere  
  
Why should I lie and pretend I dont belong to you  
Why even try when it makes no difference what you do Ill be true  
Take my heart completely treat me as you may I am yours forever anyway  
All I have is yours to share anytime anyplace anywhere
