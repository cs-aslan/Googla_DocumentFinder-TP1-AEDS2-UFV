I am a strong man  
Not such a young man  
I will do all I can  
For that special woman  
  
My arms will stay strong  
My love will burn along  
Like the fire in the hearts song  
If shes the right one  
  
I know how to love  
I aint no liar  
Theres a flame in my heart  
It burns like a fire  
  
Ive got all this love  
I can give you if you let me  
And Ill be your baptism by fire  
Ill be your baptism by fire  
  
Cause I am a strong man  
Not such a young man  
I will do all I can  
For that special woman ooh  
  
I know how to love  
I aint no liar  
Theres a flame in my heart  
It burns like a fire  
  
Ive got all this love  
I can give you if you let me  
And Ill be your baptism by fire  
Ill be your baptism by fire  
  
Oh Ive searched for you  
So you must know that its true  
And how I found you  
Yes I found you  
Im gonna leave it all up to you  
  
I know how to love  
I aint no liar  
Theres a flame in my heart  
It burns like a fire  
  
Ive got all this love  
I can give you if you let me  
And Ill be your baptism by fire  
Ill be your baptism by fire
