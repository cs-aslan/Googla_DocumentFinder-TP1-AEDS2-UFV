Fast young girl wants to go  
Body s red mouth is whole  
Got the worst in the world  
But this won t be hasslefree  
  
Lovers kiss in the heat  
Body crush basement suite  
Mind my eyes behind my hair  
Hide my face and look nowhere  
Change addresses ditch that guy  
Don t pick up when he calls  
Runaway everyday  
  
Coffee beans and hideaways  
They want these they want those  
First my nose then my toes  
Presidents and super meaks  
Litey dogs and love boutiques  
  
Afternoons waking up  
Neighborhood slouch and stuff  
Drifters too in a flow  
Nowhere they got to go  
Shave haired girl with a dog  
Dressing cool not too new  
I want to talk I want to know  
What she feels and what she knows  
  
I m so fucking alone  
I m so fucking alone  
Ok okthis is me  
Ok okthis is me  
  
Evening breeze river east  
Music mix salsa speed  
Metal rap lonely sax  
Open jeep with the speakers back  
Rock n roll band practicin  
Shaking those walls next to me  
Everybody is in a dream  
Of what they want and who they need  
To feel all right to be alive  
To wipe out words that they despise  
  
From a thunder brain  
Thats quick to pain  
And only once to live again  
When that set up gets in the way  
The dreamin brain will make a play  
To wipe it all outta space  
Press record and then erase  
cause theres something here  
They gotta face  
  
Everyeody in this place  
Its the same for everyone  
They gotta figure out something  
They gotta figure out themselves  
They gotta figure on their own  
They gotta figure out OK  
Ok ok ok ok  
I m so fucking alone  
I m so fucking alone  
Oh no being alone  
Im so fucking alone  
Ok ok so this is me  
Ok ok so this is me  
This is me  
Ok  
I m not even sure what she wanted  
I m not even sure what she wanted
