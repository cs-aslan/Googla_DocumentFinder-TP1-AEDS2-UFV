Ise The bewhy that builds the boat and  
Ise The bewhy that sails her and  
Ise The bewhy that catches the fish and  
Brings em home to Liza  
  
Chorus  
Hipyerpartner Sally Tibbo  
Hipyerpartner Sally Brown  
Fogo Twillingate Mortons Harbour  
All around the circle  
  
Sods and rinds to cover your flake  
Cake and tea for supper  
Cod fish in the spring of the year  
Fried in maggoty butter  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont want your maggoty fish  
Theyre no good for winter  
Well I can buy as good as that  
Way down in Bonavista  
  
Chorus  
  
I took Liza to a dance  
As fast as she can travel  
And every step that she could take  
Was up to her knees in gravel  
  
Chorus  
  
Susan White shes outta sight  
Her petticoat wants a border  
Well old Sam Oliver in the dark  
He kissed her in the corner  
  
Chorus  
  
Ise The bewhy that builds the boat and  
Ise The bewhy that sails her and  
Ise The bewhy that catches the fish and  
Brings em home to Liza  
  
Chorus
