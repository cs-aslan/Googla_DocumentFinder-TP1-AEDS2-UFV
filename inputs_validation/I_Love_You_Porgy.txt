I want to stay here  
But I aint worthy  
You are to descent to understand  
For when I see him  
He hypnotizes me  
When he takes hold of me  
With his hard hand  
  
Someday I know hes comin back  
To call me  
Hes gonna handle me and hold me so  
Its gonna be like dyin Porgy  
Deep inside me  
But when he calls I have to go  
  
I love you Porgy  
Dont let him take me  
Dont let him handle me  
And drive me mad  
If I can stay here and you would keep me  
  
I love you Porgy  
Dont let him take me  
Dont let him handle me  
And drive me mad  
If you can keep me I wants to stay here  
  
With you forever and Id be glad  
I love you Porgy
