Do or die that is my question  
A little seed burning in me  
Its hot I must get water  
Racing towards the sun  
Do or die break or burn  
Ive still got so much to learn  
My breath is tearing with the dying sun  
Racing towards the sun  
I cant breath  
I got sucked underneath  
She wont fight for breath now  
Have a little taste of death now  
Rise and fall rise and fall  
Ive seen it all  
Racing towards the sun
