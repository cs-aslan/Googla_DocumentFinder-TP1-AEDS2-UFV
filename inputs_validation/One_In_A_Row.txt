A step in the right direction a stitch in time saves nine  
To me you are perfection and the love you saved was mine  
When I think of all the girls that Ive ever kissed  
And the ones that Id wished I could know  
Its a real short list with just one name youre one in a row  
  
Youre a class by yourself  
Youre the state of the art  
Youre alone on the shelf  
Youre the top of the chart  
Youre the singular case  
Youre the queen of the place  
Youre the star of the show  
Youre one in a row  
  
Theres one chance in a million theres one sun up in the sky  
Im glad you were willin and heres the reason why  
When I think of all the girls that Ive ever kissed  
And the ones that Id wished I could know  
Its a real short list with just one name youre one in a row  
  
Youre the unrivaled champ  
Youre the boss of the camp  
Youre the mavin of charm  
Youre a shot in the arm  
Youre alone in the bunch  
Youre a dark horse hunch  
Youre a heavyweight blow  
Youre one in a row
