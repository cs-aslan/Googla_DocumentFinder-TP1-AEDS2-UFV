Youre on a mission to open my heart  
I learned your lesson dont play it smart  
You came close I played it tough  
You went away Im in the rough  
  
Running crying turning around  
Screaming shouting love to be found  
Im in love  
  
I got to know it got a solution  
Shift my cards and bring them back to center  
I got to know it end of confusion  
Shift my heart and try to remember  
Desire motion shout and kiss  
Im in love  
  
Im on a mission crawling on the floor  
I learned my lesson please open your door  
You came close I played it cool  
You went away Im such a fool  
  
Running crying turning around  
Screaming shouting love to be found  
Im in love  
Im in love  
  
Shes got to know it got a solution  
Shift my cards and bring them back to center  
Shes got to know it end of confusion  
Shift my heart and try to remember  
Desire motion shout and kiss  
Im in love
