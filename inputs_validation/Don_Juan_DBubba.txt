He wears tall black boots  
Has Porter Wagoner suits  
Got a four wheeler thats all wrong  
  
Now his palace is a lot  
On a rough rocky top  
And a bright red bobo on  
  
He flies the red white and blue  
And Im telling you  
He knows how to honky tonk all night  
  
When he pulls up in his truck  
All the guys are out of luck  
The girls know his reputation is fine  
  
Hes Don Juan DBubba  
Hes got a Spanish mother  
But his daddy worked in a coal mine  
  
He cooks squirrel hors doeuvres  
And he only serves  
The very cheapest supermarket wine  
  
Now hes cool as a rule  
Hes nobodys fool  
If theres a party  
Hes the first to be found  
  
Don Juan DBubba  
The hillbilly lover  
Blue Ribbon country hound  
  
Hes a playboy true  
And he pitches his woo  
To a different girl every night  
  
Hes a practical joker  
A smooth talkin stroker  
A real man if you want a fight  
  
And when he gets on a roll  
He puts on a show  
Barnum and Bailey aint never seen  
  
He is fine and dandy  
Handsome and handy  
Bubbas in every country girls dream  
  
Hes Don Juan DBubba  
Hes got a Spanish mother  
But his daddy worked in a coal mine  
  
He cooks you squirrel hors doeuvres  
And he only serves  
The very cheapest supermarket wine  
  
Now hes cool as a rule  
Nobodys fool  
Make him the man you dont want to be around  
  
Don Juan DBubba  
The legendary lover  
Blue Ribbon country hound  
  
Don Juan DBubba
