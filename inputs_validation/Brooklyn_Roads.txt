If I close my eyes  
I can almost hear my mother  
Callin Neil go find your brother  
Daddys home and its time for supper  
Hurry on  
  
And I see two boys  
Racin up two flights of staircase  
Squirmin into Papas embrace  
And his whiskers warm on their face  
Wheres it gone  
Oh wheres it gone  
  
Two floors above the butcher  
First door on the right  
Life filled to the brim  
As I stood by my window  
And looked out on those  
Brooklyn Roads  
  
I can still recall  
The smell of cookin in the hallways  
Rubber drying in the doorways  
And report cards I was always  
Afraid to show  
  
Mamad come to school  
And as Id sit there softly crying  
Teacherd say Hes just not trying  
Hes got a good head if hed apply it  
But you know yourself  
Its always somewhere else  
  
I built me a castle  
With dragons and kings  
And Id ride off with them  
As I stood by my window  
And looked out on those  
Brooklyn Roads  
  
Thought of going back  
But all Id see are strangers faces  
And all the scars that love erases  
But as my mind walks through those places  
Im wonderin  
Whats come of them  
  
Does some other young boy  
Come home to my room  
Does he dream what I did  
As he stands by my window  
And looks out on those  
Brooklyn Roads
