You say your heart will never break  
I hope so for your sake  
But happiness is sometimes hard  
For hearts to cling to  
You say hell always be with you  
I hope so for your sake  
But should he find somebody new  
What would you do  
  
If you were wrong would you confess  
I wouldnt know but I could guess  
That you would act the same as I  
An cry  
And should these things ever come true  
When love is gone what will you do  
Will you accept my love for you  
I hope so for my sake  
  
If you were wrong would you confess  
I wouldnt know but I could guess  
That you would act the same as I  
An cry  
And should these things ever come true  
When love is gone what will you do  
Will you accept my love for you  
I hope so for my sake
