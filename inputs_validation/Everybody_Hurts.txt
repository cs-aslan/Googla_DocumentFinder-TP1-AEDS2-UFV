Dont know dont know if I can do this on my own  
Why do you have to leave me  
It seems Im losing something deep inside of me  
Hold on onto me  
  
Now I see  
Now I see  
  
Everybody hurts some days  
Its okay to be afraid  
Everybody hurts  
Everybody screams  
Everybody feels this way  
And its okay  
La di da di da  
Its okay  
  
It feels like nothing really matters anymore  
When youre gone  
I cant breathe  
And I know you never meant to make me feel this way  
This cant be happening  
  
Now I see now I see  
Now I see  
  
Everybody hurts some days  
Its okay to be afraid  
Everybody hurts  
Everybody screams  
Everybody feels this way  
And its okay  
La di da di da  
Its okay  
La la la la la  
  
So many questions so much on my mind  
So many answers I cant find  
I wish I could turn back the time  
I want to  
  
Everybody hurts some days some days  
Everybody hurts some days some days
