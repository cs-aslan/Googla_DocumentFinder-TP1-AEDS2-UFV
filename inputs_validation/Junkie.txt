Youre coming down badly  
Youre crippled inside  
A rat in your sewer  
Youve no place to hide  
A gut wrenching fever  
Addicted to death  
You dont give a fuck  
If it means your last breath  
  
You try so hard to quit  
But youll never admit  
Youre the junkie  
Theres no reasoning why  
Cause the mirror dont lie  
Youre the junkie  
  
You crave for the needle to stick in your vein  
Cant for the poison to kill all the pain  
You buy your cheap ticket to take a short ride  
That beautiful flower is eating your mind  
  
You try so hard to quit  
But youll never admit  
Youre the junkie  
Theres no reasoning why  
Cause the mirror dont lie  
Youre the junkie  
  
Your name means nothing  
You dont know the score  
Body is aching you still crave for more  
Sometimes you wish that youd never been born  
Tormenting came with a crown full of thorns  
  
Youre chasing the dragon  
Youre chasing the high  
A bird with one wing  
Whos still trying to fly  
Youre all out of spirit  
A dead man alive  
A born again junkie  
Youll never survive  
  
You try so hard to quit  
But youll never admit  
Youre the junkie  
Theres no reasoning why  
Cause the mirror dont lie  
Youre the junkie  
  
Junkie  
Junkie  
Junkie  
Junkie
