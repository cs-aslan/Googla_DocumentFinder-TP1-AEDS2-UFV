Take a look at my girlfriend  
Shes the only one I got  
Not much of a girlfriend  
Never seem to get a lot  
  
Take a jumbo across the water  
Like to see America  
See the girls in California  
Im hoping its going to come true  
But theres not a lot I can do  
  
Could we have kippers for breakfast  
Mummy dear Mummy dear  
They got to have em in Texas  
Cos everyones a millionaire  
  
Im a winner Im a sinner  
Do you want my autograph  
Im a loser what a joker  
Im playing my jokes upon you  
While theres nothing better to do  
  
Dont you look at my girlfriend  
Shes the only one I got  
Not much of a girlfriend  
Never seem to get a lot  
  
Take a jumbo cross the water  
Like to see America  
See the girls in California  
Im hoping its going to come true  
But theres not a lot I can do
