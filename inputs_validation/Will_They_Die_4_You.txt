Obviously we all know you type of cats  
Let they man get struck never strike back  
Stay in the street seven days a week  
Shit get hot you never blaze your heat  
Stupid motherfucker wanna play me sweet  
So I keep em on his toes that way he never sleeps  
Bigger than the king and the Pope sling no dope  
Call me anything but broke  
When its on I guarantee my team dont choke  
Want a war you niggas better bring yo force  
And when I say we wont quit believe this shit  
When I talk about a Benz let you see the 6  
And when Im talkin to a ho let you meet my bitch  
When Puff talk you niggas take heed to this  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Mase  
Yo if you down to act we came to scrap  
We beef 89 still watch your back  
A nigga smack me Imma smack em back  
If it lead to the guns then that be that  
And lately niggas that snake me just make me  
Wanna send em heat without ac  
Thinks Im sweet taste me  
How much you really want it  
Enough to put a mil on it or your deal on it  
This year Cancun guess who Im going wit  
My own niggas see I pay my own trip  
Make my own chips I copped my own 6  
I knock my own shit like Im on my own dick  
My day be short need coke raid the fort  
Im knocked by the cops come blaze the court  
And though niggas die for go on the shelf  
Disrespect and spend like a man below your belt  
Me I always had so I never go for self  
Had thousand dollar bills with Teddy Roosevelt  
Better slow down tellin you now put the dough down  
Kick your door down surround the block  
Where you go now  
Fifty shots spit at you and that is not a whole round  
Way I leave the furniture think it was cofound  
Heres the lowdown messin with Mase gotta go down  
What more could I say but hey guess you niggas know now  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Lil Kim

This shit here nothing to fuck with  
Im the same bitch all yall wanna try yall luck with  
Lil Kim spread like syphilis  
You think Im pussy  
I dare you to stick your dick in this  
Chrome 44 inconspicuous in the 600 shits ridiculous  
Speak when youre spoken to and only with permission  
Like E F Hutton when I talk niggas listen  
So dont yall be mad at me cuz Im the Q to the B  
To the motherfuckin EE  
Copped my cd now all yall wanna be me  
See me on the tv beds will dip in 3D  
Peep the cd chromed out and phoned out  
My shit is paid for your shit is loaned out  
I gets it on money keep growin  
Ice fully glowin plus Im bad to the bone  
In the danger zone I hold my own when the pain is gone  
Like a splinter I enter  
So why should I throw my blows in those  
Do a bit upstate and take the weight for your troubles  
My nigga B I G Imma ride for  
But it aint too many niggas that Id die for  
  
Repeat 1
