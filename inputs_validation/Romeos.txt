heres a boy  
with a little black dog  
theres a boy  
with a little black dog  
and he looks  
at his watch  
for a while  
and the falling years  
wash away his make up  
and the falling years  
wash away his make up  
just like rain  
on the fading snow  
hes a lonesome streetside romeo  
you can see him from your window tonite  
this worlds a devided place you know  
hes awaiting you  
were all lonesome streetside romeos  
you can see us from your window tonite  
we all change our points of view  
sometimes  
were awaiting you  
all the boys  
are locked in a fortress  
all the girls  
are locked in a fortress  
just because  
its a crime  
it could be  
it could be  
flesh and blood  
in iron and steel  
flesh and blood  
in iron and steel  
just because  
its a crime  
it could be  
it could be  
were all lonesome
