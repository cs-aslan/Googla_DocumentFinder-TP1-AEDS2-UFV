She wants to know where Ive been  
Shes got the gloves on again  
She thinks shes smooth now Im saying  
Im not going down Im not going down  
You say this aint the end to me  
Fall down pull the rug under me  
Feels like Im falling but I tell you  
Im not going down  
One day youll be the end of me  
Go blind pull the wool over me  
Feels like Im falling but I tell you  
Im not going down  
Because you push me over the edge  
Tired of wasting my time tired of wasting my breath  
Because you push me over the edge  
Tired of wasting my time  
And youre putting me through this again through this again  
She wants to fight and Ive been drinking  
We put the walls up again  
I know shes right that Im tripping  
But Im not going down  
Repeat Chorus  
Because you  
Never did try  
Never did look to see that Im alright whoa  
Because youre  
Always right  
Gotta fight  
Always want to know whoa  
Because you
