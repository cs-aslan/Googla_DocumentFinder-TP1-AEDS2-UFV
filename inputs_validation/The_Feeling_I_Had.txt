I cannot take the heat  
This girls going home  
Standing on my own two feet  
Standing alone  
Im just a little weary of  
All the talk and all the buzz  
And all I ever wanted was  
The feeling I had with us  
I cannot take the heat  
I guess Im letting go  
Im tired of stitching up my dreams with  
This thread of hope  
Im still a believer of  
Twin hearts and timeless love  
And all I ever wanted was  
The feeling I had with us  
All I ever wanted was  
The feeling I had with us  
The road of life is rugged  
Any road you choose  
And when I find the other side  
Ill look for you  
But I cannot take the heat  
And so Ill say goodbye  
A million things I never said  
Didnt even try  
cause words are cheap and sometimes cruel  
And stuff you hear is seldom true  
And all I ever wanted was  
The feeling I had with you  
Yeah all I ever wanted was  
The feeling I had with you
