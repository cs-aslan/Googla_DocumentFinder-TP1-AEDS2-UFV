I love you I want you I need you  
Are the lines Ive heard  
Im wanting so much to believe you  
But dont use words  
By the look in your eyes I see youre getting weak  
Please fight the urge to speak  
And dont say that not now not here  
I just want to feel your touch  
Dont say that to soothe my fear  
Show me something I can trust  
You stole my heart on the night we met  
But Im not ready to follow it yet  
So whatever you do dont say that  
Dont say that  
Just hold me and show me you love me  
That says it all  
These moments of tenderness  
Mean so much more  
And well get there eventually  
So please be patient with me  
And dont say that not now not here  
I just want to feel your touch  
Dont say that to soothe my fear  
Show me something I can trust  
You stole my heart on the night we met  
But Im not ready to follow it yet  
So whatever you do dont say that  
Dont say Well last forever  
Well always be together  
Just lay here silently next to me and dont say that  
Dont say that no  
Dont say that not now not here  
I just want to feel your touch  
And dont say that to soothe our fear  
Show me something I can trust  
You stole my heart on the night we met  
And Im not ready to follow it yet  
So whatever you do  
Your kisses are all of the proof I need yeah  
So whatever you do dont say that  
Dont say that oh dont say that  
Dont speak dont talk  
Just hold me honey  
You dont have to use words  
Just hold me honey  
No need to speak  
No no no no dont use words
