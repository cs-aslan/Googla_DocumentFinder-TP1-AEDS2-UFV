Im starting to walk and Im learning to run  
Im seeing my friends and Im having some fun  
And the heartache and pain  
Like the thunder and rain have all disappeared  
Cause Im not gonna cry my eyes out anymore  
Theres a brand new world just waiting outside my door  
I aint gonna cry tonight not while the music feels so good  
Youve got your friends and Ill get mine  
Were out and have a real good time  
Im changing my style with a positive grin  
And this feeling of joy comes from within  
And the heartache and pain  
Like the thunder and rain have all disappeared  
Cause Im not gonna cry my eyes out anymore  
Theres a brand new world just waiting outside my door  
I aint gonna cry tonight not while the music feels so good  
Youve got your friends and I be fine  
Were out and have a real good time  
And the heartache and pain  
And the thunder and rain have all disappeared  
And Im not gonna cry my heart out anymore  
I aint gonna cry tonight gonna have a party  
I aint gonna cry tonight I aint gonna cry tonight  
Not while the music feels so good  
Youve got your friends and I get mine  
Were out and have a real good  
I aint gonna cry tonight not while the music feels so good  
I aint gonna cry tonight I aint gonna cry tonight  
Learning to walk learning to run  
Seeing my friends and having some fun
