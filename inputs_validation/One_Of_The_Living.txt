In the desert sun every step that you take could be the final one  
In the burning heat hanging on the edge of destruction  
You cant stop the pain of your children crying out in your head  
They always said that the living would envy the dead  
  
So now youre gonna shoot bullets of fire  
Dont want to fight but sometimes youve got to  
Youre some soul survivor  
Theres just one thing youve got to know  
Youve got ten more thousand miles to go  
  
Because youre one of the living  
And if we cant stick together  
One of the living  
Whos gonna make it tonight  
  
Walk tall cool collected and savage  
Walk tall bruised sensual ravaged  
Its every man for himself every woman every child  
A new breed ferocious and wild  
  
And all they want to do is shoot bullets of fire  
They want to fight and sometimes youve got to  
Youre some soul survivor  
Theres just one thing youve got to know  
Youve got ten more thousand years to go  
  
Because youre one of the living  
And if we cant stick together  
One of the living  
Whos gonna make it tonight
