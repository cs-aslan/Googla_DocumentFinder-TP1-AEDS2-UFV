The only time Ill get up early  
Is to meet my mules at the fishin hole  
I want to catch the one that got away  
I want to feel my pole bending in that way  
Since I was a kid Ive felt this way  
I fell hook line and sinker  
  
Gone Fishin Yeah  
  
St Johns River runs north not south  
Smart enough to have a large mouth  
If you can hook em you can mount em you can keep em around  
But if they break your line theyre gonna go back down  
  
Since I was a kid Ive felt this way  
I fell hook line and sinker  
  
Gone Fishin Oh  
  
Aint nothing like sunrise on a lake  
But when the moon comes up at night  
Theres things out there that can take your life  
You might just die of fright  
  
But Ill be there come rain or shine  
You see its what I like to do  
Only thing better than settin a hook  
is settin my hook in you  
  
I fell hook line and sinker  
Gone Fishin Oh Oh Yeah Yeah Wooo Yeah  
  
I been everywhere tried everything  
But there aint nothing that feels the same  
When you find the right one its a magical thing  
Next thing you know its a diamond ring  
  
She hooked me and took my name  
I fell hook line and sinker  
  
Gone Fishin Yeah  
Gone Gone Fishin  
She Hooked Me  
  
Gone Gone Fishin Yeah  
Gone Gone Gone Fishin Yeah  
  
Shes my baby  
Well Im gone  
  
Gone Fishin Yeah Yeah Oh Oh  
Gone Fishin
