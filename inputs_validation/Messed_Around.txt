She wants to give up love for good  
She kicks the fence and splits the wood  
She cries her eyes out in the rain  
She swears aloud and so again  
She feels messed around  
She takes her coat off as it pours  
The passing daytime she ignores  
Sits with a problem on a bench  
And with her heel she digs a trench  
She feels messed around  
She rips her skirt and tears her dress  
Climbing over his garden fence  
Mud on her mourning as tears still fall  
Shes in no mood for his love at all  
She feels messed around  
  
Her door wont shut her match wont light  
The bulb went out her skirts too tight  
She feels messed around  
The words dont match her heart wont heal  
The phone wont pip her fruit wont peel  
She feels messed around  
  
She left herself open for him all the time  
But always kept off of his cloud  
All the kings horses and all the kings men  
Have come to mess her around
