Roll out down to midnight  
Then roll on downtown til its light  
Because tomorrow we may die  
Oh but tonight were dancing in the faint light  
Dont you rob yourself of what youre feeling  
Dont rob yourself of all that you could be  
Roll hard til midnight  
Roll til its light  
  
Come on now  
Stay up and make some memories  
Yeah with us now  
Roll the red carpet out with friends  
To whom to love and roll on  
  
Our love is so right  
I wont waste a minute here tonight  
Our love is so right  
And tonight my dance is all about you  
  
To midnight love you  
Roll on and run the red lights  
You know the game now is keep it tight  
  
Oh how I love your pretty rockroll kisses  
Come on and stay with me  
Roll on and run the red lights  
Come on this love is so right  
  
Stay up and make some memories  
Yeah with us now  
To roll the red carpet out with friends  
Oh to love and roll on now  
  
Our love is so right  
I can taste  
Were in it here tonight  
Our love is so right  
And tonight my dance  
Is all about you  
  
Im going crazy  
And its all cause of you its all cause of you  
Im going under over you over you  
  
This time is so alive  
Everybodys tranced dancing tonight  
Oh so beautiful and so strange  
Oh it was empty until you came  
  
Our love is so right  
Forget the clouds that rain on your light  
Our love is so right  
Ill not forget how you look right now  
  
Our love is so right  
Remember lets just move together  
Our love is so right  
I swear it would last forever  
  
Our love is so right  
Forget the clouds that rain down on you  
Our love is so right
