Shiruetto ya kage ga  
Kakumei o miteiru  
Mo tengoku no giyu no kaidan wa nai  
  
Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution  
No more free steps to heaven  
Its no game  
  
Ore genjitsu kara shime dasare  
Nani ga okkote irunoka wakara nai  
Doko ni kyokun wa arunoka  
Hitobito wa yubi o orareteiru  
Konna dokusaisha ni iyashime rareru nowa kanashii  
  
I am bored from the event  
I really dont understand the situation  
But its no game  
  
Documentaries on refugees  
Couples gainst the target  
You throw a rock against the road  
And it breaks into pieces  
Draw the blinds on yesterday and its all so much scarier  
Put a bullet in my brain and it makes all the papers  
  
Nammin no kiroku eiga  
Hyoteki o se ni shita koibito tachi  
Michi ni ishi o nage reba  
Kona gona ni kudake  
Kino ni huta o sureba  
Kyohu wa masu  
Ore no atama ni tama o buchi kome ba  
Shinbun wa kaki tateru  
  
Theres always tomorrow when people have their fingers broken  
To be insulted by these fascists  its so degrading  
And its no game  
  
Shutup shutu
