Lately Ive been going through more bullshit than a bull fighter  
So when I say my praises to God one verse is like a full choir  
My every thought is pain strain and stressing me to death  
Everyday is like a rehearsal thats prepping me for death  
I think Im ready because this world aint no friend of mine  
Only thing I qualify for is murder and Penitentiary time  
yall should of shot me in the jimmy instead  
But I guess they was feeling eachother to get head in the bed  
Here I am first born torn between heaven and hell  
I tell my people so no to dope but I let it sell  
Need to practice my preaching calling the kettle black  
I know Im on pot before or not I gotta peddle crack  
Aint nobody got my back except the laws when they on it  
So I be going for broke demolishing my opponents  
Leaving no traces just blood on faces believe that  
HK Ima squeeze that you wont even want be back  
Hook  
I got through so much so I try to stay fucked up  
Because when Im sober I cant maintain  
Even though I do my best the only thing I earn is stress  
So I spend most of my days chilling with Mary Jane  
ZRo  
I cant focus Im losing my mind real fast  
Dreaming and fiending for the day I could make some real cash  
Dropping album after album platinum song after song  
But its like I aint did nothing cause the lights aint on  
How can I win its like everything I do is a motherfucking sin  
It got a nigga fiending to see my end  
All of my friends are fake they come around when Im spending cash  
But when Im broke they out the do with wheels spinning fast  
Lonely daily dodging the devil but he on me  
Telling my people fuck him cause he be working through my homies  
Burning bridges and I dont give a fuck  
Remember yall laughing at me when I couldnt get a buck  
Its all gravy baby I got bigger hurdles Im trying to jump over my residence  
And my vehicle is something I dump over  
And it might not be much but its all I got  
So when I paint it promethazyne is all I pop  
Hook  
ZRo  
Im on pretrial now and I cant smoke no weed  
Cause if I catch a dirty Im facing TIME  
My first time ever sober its fucking with my brain  
Got a nigga with an attitude I cant maintain  
If you cross me Ill bring it to you hard not softly  
Living like Im invincible one day its gonna cost me  
When its time to pay up and I lay up in a grave  
Bury me with a fifty sack and a motherfucking 12 gauge  
Hey no love in my heart  
Cause my homies was phony straight from the motherfucking start  
Why couldnt I get a ride if I aint have no weed these motherfuckers  
Aint my people they gotta be strangers up a reverend breed  
So I bless the streets with my smithnwesson  
And if you beefing with me nigga better get your weapon  
You better pray that Im codeine and Im just tripping  
But I wont let you add up to my problems I will leave you tripping
