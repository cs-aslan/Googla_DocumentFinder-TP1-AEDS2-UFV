Looking at the pages of my life  
Faded memories of me and you  
Mistakes you know Ive made a few  
I took some shots and fell from time to time  
Baby you were there to pull me through  
Weve been around the block a time or two  
Im gonna lay it on the line  
Ask me how weve come this far  
The answers written in my eyes  
  
Chorus  
Every time I look at you baby I see something new  
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more  
I dont wanna sleep tonight dreamins just a waste of time  
When I look at what my lifes been comin to  
Im all about lovin you  
  
Ive lived Ive loved Ive lost Ive paid some dues baby  
Weve been to hell and back again  
Through it all youre always my best friend  
For all the words I didnt say and all the things I didnt do  
Tonight Im gonna find a way  
  
Chorus  
Every time I look at you baby I see something new  
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more  
I dont wanna sleep tonight dreamins just a waste of time  
When I look at what my lifes been comin to  
Im all about lovin you  
  
You can take this world away  
Youre everything I am  
Just read the lines upon my face  
Im all about lovin you  
  
Guitar Solo  
  
Chorus  
Every time I look at you baby I see something new  
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more  
I dont wanna sleep tonight dreamins just a waste of time  
When I look at what my lifes been comin to  
Im all about lovin you  
  
All about lovin you
