You want to leave me baby be my guest  
All Im gonna do is cry  
And then Im gonna find theres someone else  
And tear the stars out of the sky  
Looking for something when theres nothing there to be found  
Make it easy on yourself  
Go out and find your body someone else  
And tear the stars out of the sky  
Baby youre too wellread  
Baby youre too wellspoken  
Baby youre too pristine  
When I cry do you feel anything  
Baby youre too wellread

They say storms are right for summertime

Whatcha gonna do when you open your eyes  
Its a brand new day and baby  
No blue skies  
Baby youre too wellread

Baby youre far too clean
