See in me the side of you  
  
That sometimes makes you jump with fright  
Smiler with knife its your big night  
  
Sinking bed all warm and clean  
Only sadness waits for me  
Smiler with knife youre just in time  
Youre just in time  
  
Press the blade against my skin  
Never to make love again  
Smiler with knife its alright  
  
Surrender will I am before you  
I am sick to death of life  
Smiler with knife alight  
Alight  
  
If such things werent meant to be  
Then they would never come to me  
Smiler oh dont worry so  
  
Slamming one shots gentle pain  
Someone calling out my name  
Sex and love are not the same  
Are not the same  
  
Time has frittered long and slow  
All I am and was will go  
But where to and why now  
  
When my last breath falls away  
Smiler trust me when I say  
Youll be OK Youll be OK
