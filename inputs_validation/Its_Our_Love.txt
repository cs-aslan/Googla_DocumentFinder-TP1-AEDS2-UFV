I found you looking for the rainbow  
You found me waiting for a chance  
Now we got something good together  
A life where we have joined our hands  
And there aint nobody gonna break that  
Our love  
And there aint nobody gonna break it  
Our love  
Our love  
  
I didnt have too much to offer  
You didn t have much to expect  
A cold hotel room full of trouble  
Beside a blinking traffic light  
On all night  
And there aint nobody gonna break this  
It s our love  
There aint nobody gonna take it  
Not our love  
Nobodys gonna take this  
It s our love  
Love  
  
I know the feeling of being outside  
Alone and watching all the fun  
The crowds together laughing loudly  
And long  
But that type they re never really strong  
An there aint nobody gonna take it  
An there aint nobody gonna take it  
An there aint nobody gonna take it  
There aint nobody whos gonna break it  
Its our love
