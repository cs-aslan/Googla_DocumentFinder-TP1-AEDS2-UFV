Give me one thing I can believe  
Give me one thing I can touch  
Taste  
Want  
  
Take again  
And again  
And again  
Give me something I cant remember  
  
Forget me not  
Give me something over and over  
Dont forget  
Keep me loved  
  
Give me something I cant ignore  
No  
Keep me preoccupied  
Keep me satisfied  
  
With a womans touch  
Yeah  
Hold on baby  
Hold on tell you when  
  
Dream baby  
Dream again  
And again  
And again  
  
I want you tonight  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Make this thing right  
  
You know you want it  
You know I want it too  
Give it all  
Come on come through  
  
Give me something to believe in  
Give me  
Give me a womans touch  
Yeah  
  
Yeah  
Oh  
Its all I want  
I want you  
  
And nobody else will do  
I need you  
Now  
Feels like a honeymoon  
  
Want you so  
Take my hand  
Dont let go  
You know you want it  
  
Yeah  
Nothing could ever mean as much  
No  
Keep me preoccupied  
  
Keep me satisfied  
With a womans touch  
Yeah  
Keep me happy tonight  
  
Keep me wide awake  
Give me a womans touch  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Make me feel alright  
Dont forget
