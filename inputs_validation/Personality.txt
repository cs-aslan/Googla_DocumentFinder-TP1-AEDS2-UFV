When Madam Pompadour was on a ballroom floor  
Said all the gentlemen Obviously  
The madam has the cutest personality  
  
And think of all the books about do Barrys looks  
What was it made her the toast of Paree  
She had a welldeveloped personality  
  
What did Romeo see in Juliet  
Or Figaro in Figarette  
Or Jupiter in Juno  
You know  
  
And when Salome danced and had the boys entranced  
No doubt it must have been easy to see  
That she knew how to use her personality  
  
A girl can learn to spell and take dictation well  
And never sit on the bosss left knee  
Unless shes got a perfect personality  
  
A girl can get somewhere in spite of stringy hair  
Or even just a bit bowed at the knee  
If she can show a faultless personality  
  
Why are certain girls offered certain things  
Like sable coats and wedding rings  
By men who wear their spats right  
Thats right  
  
So dontcha say Im smart and have the kindest heart  
Or what a wonderful sister Id be  
Just tell me how you like my  
Rufff  
Personality  
  
Baby youve got the cutest  
Personality
