Lyrics by bernie taupin  
Released as a uk bside in november 1973  
  
Sitting here on christmas eve with a brandy in my hand  
Oh ive had a few too many and its getting hard to stand  
I keep hearing noises from my fireplace  
I must be going crazy or the brandys won the race  
  
And i keep hearing ho ho ho guess whos here  
Your fat and jolly friend draws near  
Ho ho ho surprise surprise  
The bearded weirdys just arrived  
  
  
Ho ho ho guess whos here  
Your fat and jolly friend draws near  
Ho ho ho surprise surprise  
The bearded wierdys just arrived  
  
  
On my roof theres snorting sounds and bells inside my head  
My visions blurred with colour and all he sees is red  
Theres a pair of large sized wellies coming down my flue  
And the smell of burning rubber oh is filling up the room
