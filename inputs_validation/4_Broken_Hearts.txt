Ooh ooh ooh  
  
People cant be handmade  
But he keeps slaving away  
At a stone thats too hard to break  
A girl whos too lost to save  
  
So you tried to replace me  
But you didnt get far  
And I tried to repay you  
But I only got scarred  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
Shell be breaking your fall  
And Ill be building new walls  
But this time Ill have to make sure  
To add a window for you to come back  
  
And we tried to be faithful  
But didnt get far  
Now all well be left with is four broken hearts  
I tried to erase you  
But didnt get get far enough away from you  
Because you still can break my heart  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh
