From Russia with love I fly to you  
Much wiser since my goodbye to you  
Ive travelled the world to learn  
I must return from Russia with love  
  
Ive seen places faces and smiled for a moment  
But oh you haunted me so  
Still my tongue tied young pride  
Would not let my love for you show  
In case youd say no  
  
To Russia I flew but there and then  
I suddenly knew youd care again  
My running around is through  
I fly to you from Russia with love
