Hang a picture up on your wall  
Tighten all the nails so it dont fall  
In this picture could have been a picture of my face  
Something painful went and took its place  
If he cant have you guess that no one else will  
Watch him think a while smoke a cigarette and smile as I frown  
If he cant have you guess that no one else will  
Watch him think a while smoke a cigarette and smile as I frown  
  
Drink your coffee in the morning  
And at night go and drink your beer  
All along you dont feel so welcome here  
And I walk by and you steer clear  
You always said itd come passionate here  
Dont like what you see you dont like what you hear  
  
If he cant have you guess that no one else will  
Watch him think a while smoke a cigarette and smile as I frown  
If he cant have you guess that no one else will  
Watch him think a while smoke a cigarette and smile as I frown
