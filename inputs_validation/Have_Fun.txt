Have fun  
And if you cant have fun  
Have someone elses fun  
Cause someone sure had mine  
They came in  
now theyre having a whale of a time  
  
You should grow a beard  
A beard to tell a thousand stories never told before  
A beard to tell you tales whilst the fireplace roars  
The closing of relationships and the opening of doors  
The starting of hostilities and the ending of wars  
  
Take care  
And if you couldnt care  
Take someone elses care  
Cause someone took my care  
They went there and then they were not there  
  
We should have a baby  
And then I wouldnt feel quite so sad  
Then Id feel like Paul the Saint and not Jack the Lad  
A baby thatll make me feel so very glad  
Ive had a life of booze but thats all Ive ever had  
  
Cause Im the King of Misery  
The Prince of the torn apart  
And youre the lighthouse keeper  
To the owner of a shipwrecked heart  
  
Take heart  
And if you cant take heart  
Take someone elses heart  
Someone took my heart  
They came in now Im torn apart  
  
We should grey together  
Not that pigeonchested Trafalgar grey  
The grey that greets you on that first October day  
The grey of Russian front whilst wolves bay  
And the skeleton of life that love decays  
  
Cause youre the Queen of Sadness  
The Princess of the House of Pain  
And youre the final match  
To the holder of this flickering flame  
  
Have fun
