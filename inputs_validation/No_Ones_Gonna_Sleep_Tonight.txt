Here I stand  
Looking in your eyes Im an open book  
Shatter heart is all I have to give  
And thats what you took  
Feels so good that I cant say goodbye  
Watching time fly by  
Will it stop if I close my eyes  
  
If I could make a moment last forever  
This would be the one I choose  
You and me here together  
Feels so right feels so true  
Every star let to you shine so bright  
No ones gonna sleep tonight  
No no ones gonna sleep tonight  
  
From the start  
I knew that wed be here dancing in the dark  
Feel the spark  
You can sign your name right across my heart  
Its so good  
I just want you to stay  
Tell me why we feel  
Its never gonna go away  
  
If I could make a moment last forever  
This would be the one I choose  
You and me here together  
Feels so right feels so true  
Every star let to you shine so bright  
No ones gonna sleep tonight  
No no ones gonna sleep tonight  
  
All my life Ive waited  
Afraid to surrender  
Always gone whatever  
Now Im wondering  
  
If I could make a moment last forever  
This would be the one I choose  
You and me here together  
Feels so right feels so true  
Every star let to you shine so bright  
No ones gonna sleep tonight  
No no ones gonna sleep tonight  
  
Tonight Can you hear me  
Tonight Can you hear me  
No ones gonna sleep tonight  
Can you hear me  
No ones gonna sleep tonight
