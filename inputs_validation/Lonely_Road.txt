I tried to get over you  
I tried to find something new  
But all I could ever do  
Was fill my time with thoughts of you  
  
I tried to go somewhere old  
To search for my pot of gold  
But all I could ever hold  
Inside my mind were thoughts  of you  
  
I hear your music and its driving me wild  
Familiar rhythms in a different style  
I hear your music and its driving me wild  
Again ohhh  
  
Dont want to let you take me down  
Dont want to get hurt 2nd time around  
Dont want to walk that lonely road again yeahh  
Ohh love you yeah  
  
I hear your music and its driving me wild  
Familiar rhythms in a different style  
I hear your music and its driving me wild again ohhh  
Dont want to let you take me down  
Dont want to get hurt 2nd time around  
Dont want to walk that lonely road again  
Dont want to let you take me down  
Dont want to get hurt 2nd time around  
Dont want to walk that lonely road again  
I dont want to walk that lonely road  
Oh no
