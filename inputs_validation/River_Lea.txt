Verse 1  
Everybody tells me its bout time that I moved on  
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young  
But my heart is a valley its so shallow and man made  
Im scared to death if I let you in that youll see Im just a fake  
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch  
But I know thats just me cause nothing ever is enough  
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea  
There was something in the water now that somethings in me  
Oh I cant go back but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips  
I cant go back to the river  
  
PreChorus  
But its in my roots its in my veins  
Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
But its in my roots its in my veins  
Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
  
Chorus  
So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea  
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea  
  
Verse 2  
I should probably tell you now before its way too late  
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face  
Consider this my apology I know its years in advance  
But Id rather say it now in case I never get the chance  
No I cant go back but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips  
I cant go back to the river  
  
PreChorus  
But its in my roots its in my veins  
Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
Its in my roots its in my veins  
Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
  
Chorus  
So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea  
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea  
So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea  
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea
