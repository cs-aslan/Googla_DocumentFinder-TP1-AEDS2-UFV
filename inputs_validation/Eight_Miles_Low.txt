When I was a little boy  
I dreamed of playing with bigger toys  
I just knew what I just knew  
What else was I supposed to do  
  
Scream dream scream dream  
Scream dream scream dream  
Scream dream  
  
Another notch on the bedpost  
Another notch on your gun  
Put your lips on the list of life  
Another notch on your gun  
  
Years gone by and now Im eight  
The girl next door I cant tolerate  
She found a patient oh I give in  
Shes the nurse with the medicine  
  
Scream dream scream dream  
Scream dream scream dream  
Scream dream  
  
Another notch on the bedpost  
Another notch on your gun  
Put your lips on the list of life  
You had it all but youre not the only one  
Youre not the only boy  
  
Violins I can hear you call  
I found out you dont care at all  
Violins tell me what to do  
All I want is to play with you  
  
The day that I turned twentyone  
Thought I was the biggest gun  
Lusted from your face to view  
What else was I supposed to do  
  
Scream dream scream dream  
Scream dream scream dream  
Scream dream  
  
Another notch on the bedpost  
Another notch on your gun  
Put your lips on the list of life  
You had it all but youre not the only boy  
Youre not the only one  
  
Violins I can hear you call  
I found out you dont care at all  
Violins tell me what to do  
All I want is to play with you
