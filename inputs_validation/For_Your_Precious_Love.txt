For your precious love means more to me  
Than any love could ever be  
For when I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue  
For thats what love will do  
  
Darling Im so surprised  
Oh when I first realized  
That you were fooling me  
Darling they say that our love wont grow  
  
I just want to tell them that they dont know  
For as long as you long as you are loving me  
Our love will grow wider deeper than any sea  
And all the things in the world in this whole wide world  
Is just that you would say that youd be my girl  
  
Wanting you Wanting you Im lonely and blue whoa lonely  
Thats what love will do  
  
For your precious love means more to me  
Than any love could ever be  
For when I I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue  
Thats what love will do
