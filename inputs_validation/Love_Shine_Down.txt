Where do I go from here tell me baby  
If I cant have you near  
Ive been running in circles for you  
Got a fever of a hundred and two  
Cant fake how I feel for you  
  
This foolish heart of mine gets frustrated  
Cant read between the lines  
And the signal that Im waiting for  
Is always locked behind the door  
And It makes me want you more  
  
So let your love shine down on me  
And I will surrender  
Wear my heart upon your sleeve  
Just put your trust in me and I will be there forever  
So let your love shine down on me  
  
If I could have my way Id take you baby  
Out every night and day  
Youre the battery to my heart  
And without you I cant start  
Dont you leave me in the dark  
  
So let your love shine down on me  
And I will surrender  
Wear my heart upon your sleeve  
Just put your trust in me and I will be there forever  
So let your love shine down on me  
  
You know I wanna believe  
I wanna see the light  
So let your love shine down on me  
  
You know I wanna believe  
I wanna see the light  
So let your love shine down on me  
  
You know I wanna believe  
I wanna see the light  
So let your love shine down on me  
  
You know I wanna believe  
I wanna see the light  
So let your love shine down on me  
  
Just shine it right down  
You know I wanna believe  
I wanna see the light  
So let your love shine down on me  
  
Just shine it right down  
You know I wanna believe  
I wanna see the light  
So let your love shine down on me  
  
So let your love shine down on me  
And I will surrender  
Wear my heart upon your sleeve  
Just put your trust in me and I will be there forever  
So let your love shine down on me
