Its like a storm  
That cuts a path  
Its breaks your will  
It feels like that  
  
You think youre lost  
But your not lost on your own  
Youre not alone  
  
I will stand by you  
I will help you through  
When youve done all you can do  
If you cant cope  
I will dry your eyes  
I will fight your fight  
I will hold you tight  
And I wont let go  
  
It hurts my heart  
To see you cry  
I know its dark  
This part of life  
Oh it finds us all finds us all  
And were too small  
To stop the rain  
Oh but when it rains  
  
I will stand by you  
I will help you through  
When youve done all you can do  
And you cant cope  
I will dry your eyes  
I will fight your fight  
I will hold you tight  
And I wont let you fall  
  
Dont be afraid to fall  
Im right here to catch you  
I wont let you down  
It wont get you down  
Youre gonna make it  
Yeah I know you can make it  
  
Cause I will stand by you  
I will help you through  
When youve done all you can do  
And you cant cope  
And I will dry your eyes  
I will fight your fight  
I will hold you tight  
And I wont let go  
Oh Im gonna hold you  
And I wont let go  
Wont let you go  
No I wont
