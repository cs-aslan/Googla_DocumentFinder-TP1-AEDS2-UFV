Well I looked for my baby bout the break of day  
I said I looked for my baby bout the break of day  
But a blue train took my baby away  
Now the rail is rusted and the road is long  
I said The rail is rusted and the road is long  
And that blue train wont bring my baby home  
I hear that whistle moaning steel whinning on the track  
I hear that whistle moaning steel whinning on the track  
But that blue train wont bring my baby back no no no  
Im going down to the station down that road Im going  
Im going down to the station down that road Im going

Gonna catch that blue train bring my baby home  
Gonna catch that blue train gonna bring my baby back
