Sia  
I was bound was tired  
Hadnt seen a light so long  
Thought I lost my fight  
Couldnt find my way back home  
And I found the light stepping out of me  
I was bound and tired  
Waiting for daylight  
  
PreChorus  
Bang my head up against the wall  
Though I feel light headed now I know I will not fall  
I will rise above it all  
Found what I was searching for  
Though I feel light headed  
I should have failed and nailed the floor  
Instead I rose above it all  
  
Chorus  
Oh oh oh  
Bang my head up against the wall  
Oh oh oh  
Instead I rose above it all  
Bang my head against the wall  
  
Verse 2  
When you think youre giving up  
Just know you might think youre dying but you wont  
And you feel the love stepping out of you  
But when you think of giving up dont  
  
PreChorus  
Bang your head up against the wall  
You may feel light headed but you wont crawl no you wont fall  
You will rise above it all  
Youll find what youre searching for  
And you may feel light headed  
You think youre gonna hit the floor  
Instead you rise above it all  
  
Chorus  
Oh oh oh  
Bang your head against the wall  
Oh oh oh  
Instead you rise above it all  
Bang my head against the wall  
  
Bridge  
I have broken wings  
I keep trying keep trying  
No one get out  
Oh Im flying oh Im flying  
  
PreChorus  
Bang my head against the wall  
Though I feel light headed now I know I will not fall  
I will rise above it all  
Found what I was searching for  
Though I feel light headed I should have failed and nailed the floor  
Instead I rose above it all  
  
Chorus  
Oh oh oh  
Bang my head up against the wall  
Oh oh oh  
Bang my head against the wall  
Bang my head against the wall  
Instead I rise above it all
