Its only human to despise the weak  
Its only human to despise yourself when youre weak  
I dont know why  
But thats the way that its always been  
And I play by the rules I dont understand at all  
  
Its only human to be lazy and vain  
Its only human to expect a world thats just as vain  
I dont know why  
I want to believe that its not that way  
But Im johnny come lately its not my place to say  
  
Theres no escape tell me why do they try so hard  
And I pretend that Im invincible that I can go it all alone  
But Im only human trying to get by  
And praying to heaven I might find out why am I human  
Mere flesh and blood  
Afraid to go on without someone to hold me up  
  
Its just a human thing to fear the unknown  
But isnt it a tragic thing to live and die alone  
Oh lord look at the world  
Have you ever seen so much misery  
Like a ghost ship of fools lost and floating out to sea  
  
And they climb and they fall  
Yet they struggle on the same fault  
But theyre only human trying to get by  
And praying to heaven they might find out  
Why are we human  
Mere flesh and blood  
Were afraid to go on without someone to hold us up
