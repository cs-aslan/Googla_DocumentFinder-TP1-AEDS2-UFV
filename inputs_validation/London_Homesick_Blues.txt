Well when youre down on your luck and you aint got a buck in London youre a
goner  
Even London Bridge has fallen down and moved to Arizona  
Now I know why and Ill substantiate the rumor that the English sense of humor  
Is drier than the Texas sand  
You can put up your dukes or you can bet your boots but Im leavin as fast as
I can  
I want to go home with the armadillo good country music from Amarillo and
Abilene  
The friendliest people and the prettiest women youve ever seen  
Well its cold over here Lord I swear I wish theyd turn the heat on  
And where in the world is that English girl I promised I would meet on the
third floor  
And of the whole damn lot the only friend I got is a smoke and a cheal guitar  
My mind keeps rollin and my heart keeps yearnin to be home in Texas bar  
I want to go home with the armadillo  
Well I decided that Id get my cowboy hat and go down to Marble Arch Station  
Cause when a Texas fancies hell take his chances  
Chances will be taken thats for sure  
And them Limey eyes they were eyin the prize some people call manly footwear  
And they said youre from down south and when you open your mouth  
Son you always seem to put yout foor there  
I want to go home with Armadilla  
I want to go home with Armadilla
