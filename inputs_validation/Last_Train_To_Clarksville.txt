Take the last train to Clarksville  
And Ill meet you at the station  
You can be there by 430  
Cause Ive made your reservation  
Dont be slow  
Oh no no no oh no no no  
  
Cause Im leaving in the morning  
And I must see you again  
Well have one more night together  
Til the morning brings my train  
And I must go  
Oh no no no oh no no no  
And I dont know if Im ever coming home  
  
Take the last train to Clarksville  
Ill be waiting at the station  
Well have time for coffee flavored kisses  
And a bit of conversation  
Oh no no no oh no no no  
  
Take the last train to Clarksville  
Now I must hang up the phone  
I cant hear you in this  
Noisy railroad station all alone  
Im feeling low  
Oh no no no oh no no no  
And I dont know if Im ever coming home  
  
Take the last train to Clarksville  
And Ill meet you at the station

Cause Ive made your reservation dont be slow  
Oh no no no
