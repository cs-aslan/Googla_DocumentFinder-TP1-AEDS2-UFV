I cannot sleep  the night is young  
I cannot eat  I want some fun  
I pick you up  Route 66  
Life gives me the kick  
I cannot live  I love this life  
I cannot die  can I survive  
I cannot breathe  without your love  
I cant get enough  
  
Its the last exit to Brooklyn  
New York City oh is waiting  
Youre a new boy youre a party guy  
Baby lets dance and have some joy  
West coast east side that is the place where  
New York LA I wanna live there  
New York City boy LA party girl  
Baby lets dance in a brand new world  
  
4  6  0  1  East Avenue  
Why does my heart  beats just for you  
I cannot give  you more Ill give  
Baby please forgive  
I cannot tell  you thousant lies  
I have the love  right in my eyes  
The night is young  I want your heart  
Baby can we start  
  
In between  
Hold on baby baby hold on  
Party up party up party up baby party up party up  
  
I cant believe  oh what I see  
I cant control  its extacy  
I cant explain  oh what I feel  
My dream comes so real  
I cannot leave  your love alone  
I cannot go  Im not a stone  
I cannot say  good bye to you  
When my dream comes true
