The day wont open its eyes  
The heavens above must be sick  
Im stood at the windows since five  
All decked out for the trip  
  
Hey Hey Im dying to meet with you  
Hey Hey Im living to speak with you  
Hey Hey Im waiting to meet you baby  
Hey Hey Hey  
  
Chorus  
  
Big trip to Portland  
No more cooling my heels  
Big trip to Portland  
My soul shall be healed  
  
The masters out of my reach  
He wanders around in the rain  
Today is all that I seek  
Today when I hold you again  
Hey Hey  
  
Chorus  
I take the prize I win the day  
You say you love me all the way  
I kill the pain that drags you down  
You take us on from town to town  
  
The suns burning all through the day  
Its doing the best it can do  
I came with my bucket and spade  
I came with the same things as you  
  
Chorus  
Big trip to Portland  
No more cooling my heels  
Big trip to Portland  
My soul shall be healed
