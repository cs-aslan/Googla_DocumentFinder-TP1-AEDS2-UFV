The moon was bright the night was clear  
No breeze came over the sea  
When mary left her highland home  
And wandered forth with me  
The flowers bedecked the mountainside  
And fragrance filled the vale  
But by far the sweetest flower there  
Was the rose of allendale  
Oh the rose of allendale  
Sweet rose of allendale  
By far the sweetest flower there  
Was the rose of allendale  
Where eer I wandered east or west  
Though fate began to lour  
A solace still was she to me  
In sorrows lonely hour  
When tempests lashed our lonely barque  
And rent her quivering sail  
One maidens form withstood the storm  
twas the rose of allendale  
Oh sweet rose of allendale  
Sweet rose of allendale  
One maidens form withstood the storm  
twas the rose of allendale  
And when my feverd lips were parched  
On africs burning sands  
She whispered hopes of happiness  
And tales of distant lands  
My life has been a wilderness  
Unblessed by fortunes wheel  
Had fate not linked my love to hers  
The rose of allendale  
Oh sweet rose of allendale  
Sweet rose of allendale  
Had fate not linked my love to hers  
The rose of allendale
