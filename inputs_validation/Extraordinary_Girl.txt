Shes an extraordinary girl  
In an ordinary world  
And she cant seem to get away  
  
He lacks the courage in his mind  
Like a child left behind  
Like a pet left in the rain  
  
Shes all alone again  
Wiping the tears from her eyes  
Some days he feels like dying  
She gets so sick of crying  
  
She sees the mirror of herself  
And image she wants to sell  
To anyone willing to buy  
  
He steals the image in her kiss  
From her hearts apocalypse  
From the one called whats her name  
  
Shes all alone again  
Wiping the tears from her eyes  
Some days he feels like dying  
She gets so sick of crying  
  
Shes all alone again  
Wiping the tears from her eyes  
Some days he feels like dying  
Some days hes not worth trying  
Now that theyre both up on it  
She gets so sick of crying  
  
Shes an extraordinary girl  
An extraordinary girl  
An extraordinary girl  
An extraordinary girl
