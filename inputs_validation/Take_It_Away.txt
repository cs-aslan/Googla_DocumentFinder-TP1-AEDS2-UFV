Im lying to myself  
And this dagger is my excuse  
Im a pawn  
I should have paid up  
And I left an hour late  
I was laid up  
  
I must abuse myself  
Im against all that Ive made up  
Set in stone the sun will come  
And I hate light  
You know I hate light  
To me it looks so pretty burning  
  
Burn the sun  
Burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand  
Take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
  
I must have caught something  
In the heat of all these dances  
Im a worm with no more chances  
And Ive lost all doubt  
In a chemical romance  
  
I cant stop itching  
Over thoughts of tarnished hope  
Kinda funny  
Lonely feeling  
Im not in love  
You know its not love  
Dont make it look so pretty burning  
  
Burn the sun  
Burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand  
Take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
  
Burn the sun  
Burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand  
Take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
  
Brothers and sisters  
Im right here with you  
Cause everyones got one  
A story to to kill me  
Im so apathetic in my resentment  
Living loving knowing not  
  
Take my handx8  
Take my life  
Take my heart take my mind  
Take my life take my life  
  
Burn the sun burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
Burn the sun burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand take my life  
Take my life  
Take my life
