Take a step outside yourself  
And turn around  
Take a look at who you are  
Its pretty scary  
So silly  
Revolting  
Youre not much  
You cant do anything  
Take a step outside the city  
And turn around  
Take a look at what you are  
It is revolting  
Youre really nowhere  
So wasteful  
So foolish  
Poppycock  
Who said dont look back  
Dont believe em  
Go for that crazy sounding restaurant  
Cause theyre gonna try and get behind you  
Dont you let them do it  
You know what Im talking about  
You hear me talking  
You hear me talking  
Its pretty scary its so revolting  
Take a step outside the country  
And turn around  
Take a look at what you are  
It is amazing  
Take a good look  
Youre no big deal  
Youre so petty  
Its lots  
Take a step outside the planet  
Turn around and around  
Take a look at where you are  
Its pretty scary
