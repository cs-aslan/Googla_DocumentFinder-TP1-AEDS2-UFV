Shes all laid up in bed with a broken heart  
While Im drinking Jack all alone in my local bar  
And we dont know how we got into this mad situation  
Only doing things out of frustration  
  
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard  
She needs me now but I cant seem to find a time  
Ive got a new job now in the unemployment line  
And we dont know how we got into this mess its a gods test  
Someone help us cause were doing our best  
  
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard  
But were gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine  
Sit talking up all night  
Saying things we havent for a while a while yeah  
Were smiling but were close to tears  
Even after all these years  
We just now got the feeling that were meeting  
For the first time  
  
Shes in line at the dole with her head held high  
While I just lost my job but didnt lose my pride  
But we both know how were gonna make it work when it hurts  
When you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt  
  
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard  
But were gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine  
Sit talking up all night  
Doing things we havent for a while a while yeah  
Smiling but were close to tears  
Even after all these years  
We just now got the feeling that were meeting  
For the first time  
  
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine  
Sit talking up all night  
Saying things we havent for a while a while yeah  
Were smiling but were close to tears  
Even after all these years  
We just now got the feeling that were meeting  
For the first time  
For the first time  
Oh for the first time  
Yeah for the first time  
Just now got the feeling that were meeting  
For the first time  
  
Oh these times are hard  
Yeah theyre making us crazy  
Dont give up on me baby  
Oh these times are hard  
Yeah theyre making us crazy  
Dont give up on me baby  
  
Oh these times are hard

Dont give up on me baby  
  
Oh these times are hard  
Yeah theyre making us crazy  
Dont give up on me baby
