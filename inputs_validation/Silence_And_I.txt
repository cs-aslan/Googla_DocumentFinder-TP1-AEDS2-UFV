If I cried out loud  
over sorrows Ive Known  
And the secrets Ive heard  
It would ease my mind  
Someone sharing the load  
But I wont breathe a word  
  
Were two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We need a chance to talk things over  
Two of a kind  
Silence and I  
Well find a way to work it out  
  
While the children laughed  
I was always afraid  
of the Smile of the clown  
So I close my eyes  
Till I cant see the light  
And I hide from the sound  
  
Were two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We need a chance to talk things over  
Two of a kind  
Silence and I  
Well find a way to work it out  
  
I can hear the cry  
Of the leaf on a tree  
As it Falls to the ground  
I can hear the call  
of an Echoing voice  
And theres no one around  
  
Were two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We need a chance to talk things over  
Two of a kind  
Silence and I  
Well find a way to work it out
