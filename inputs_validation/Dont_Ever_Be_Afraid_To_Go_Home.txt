Dont ever be afraid to go home  
Dont ever be afraid to go home  
When youve hitched your wagon to a fast falling star  
And the last string is broken on your lovesick guitar  
  
Whatever youre doing and wherever you are  
Dont ever be afraid dont ever be afraid to go home  
I used to be afraid to go home  
But one day I was made to go home  
  
Now I was almost certain they would lock the door on me  
Cause Im that sour apple on my old family tree  
But folks who really love me made me welcome as could be  
Dont ever be afraid dont ever be afraid to go home  
  
I used to be afraid to go home  
But one day I was made to go home  
Now I was almost certain they would lock the door on me  
Cause Im the sour apple on my old family tree  
  
But the folks who really love me made me welcome as could be  
Dont ever be afraid dont you ever be afraid  
Dont ever be afraid to go home
