Dolly Parton  
Theres a bit of magic in a simple little smile  
Something that just makes life seem a little more worthwhile  
And theres a world of meaning in the touch of someones hand  
A gentle touch that lets your brother know you understand  
Oh if people would stop taking and just once try to give  
We could make the world were living in a better place to live  
La la la la la la la la la la la la  
And if wed love one another instead of finding faults  
We could afford the price of peace love is all it costs  
Oh wouldnt it be great to live and sing in harmony  
Everybody take your brothers hand and sing my song with me  
La la la la la la la la la la la la  
All life has to offer thats what most folks desire  
But offer nothing in return cause they dont seem to care  
And if wed ask to be forgiven and be willing to forgive  
We could make the world were living in a better place to live  
And if wed all climb together we could climb the highest hill  
We could make the world were living in a better place to live  
And if wed love one another instead of finding faults  
We could afford the price of peace love is all it costs  
Oh wouldnt it be great to live and sing in harmony  
Everybody take your brothers hand and sing my song with me  
La la la la la la la la la la la la
