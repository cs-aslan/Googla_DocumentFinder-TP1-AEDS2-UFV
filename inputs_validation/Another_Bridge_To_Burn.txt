Ive had to burn most every bridge Ive crossed  
It seems like everything Ive loved Id lost  
When I met you Ive thought my luck had turned  
But our loves just another bridge to burn  
  
So Ill soon light the fire and move on  
Oh Ive already been here much too long  
Im so hurt and youre so unconcerned  
But our loves just another bridge to burn  
  
Sometimes one must love enough for two  
And thats the way its been with me and you  
Ill see your face no matter where Ill turn  
But that will be another bridge to burn  
  
So Ill soon light the fire and move on  
Oh Ive already been here much too long  
Im so hurt and youre so unconcerned  
But our loves just another bridge to burn  
  
Our loves just another bridge to burn
