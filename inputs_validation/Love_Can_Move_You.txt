Get me through the heart of the freeway  
I got to see the lights up in New York city  
Im so close I think I can hear the sound of the taxi siren symphony  
Dont you want to feel amazing  
Baby you know I do  
Youll get back ten times what you give freely  
Like my mamma told me  
  
Love can move you take you deeper every time  
Can make the darkest moments feel like heavens come alive  
Love can move you to a place inside your heart  
Where you can fear no evil and acceptance is a natural part of life  
  
Climb into the heart of the subway  
Creepin like a snake into New York city  
Im so close I think I can see those lights  
Let the sun get closer to the ground  
Dont you want to feel amazing  
Baby you know I do  
Youll get back ten times what you give freely  
Like my mamma told me  
  
Love can move you take you deeper every time  
Can make the darkest moments feel like heavens come alive  
Love can move you to a place inside your heart  
Where you can fear no evil and acceptance is a natural part of life  
  
Its about the one thing  
Its about the one thing  
About the kind of shoes your wearin  
About religion  
  
And I breathe the love youve given  
And I feel the love youve hidden  
And though its cold down here well I can honestly say  
I can still stay  
  
That love can move you  
Love can move you baby  
Love can move you  
That love can move you too child  
  
Love can move you take you deeper every time  
Can make the darkest moments feel like heavens come alive  
Love can move you to a place inside your heart  
Where you can fear no evil and acceptance is a natural part  
  
Love can move you take you deeper every time  
Can make the darkest moments feel like heavens come alive  
Love can move you to a place inside your heart  
Where you can fear no evil and acceptance is a natural part  
  
And I breathe the love youve given  
And I feel the love youve hidden  
And though its cold down here well I still I still try  
  
Love can move you  
You know that love can move you too child  
Love can move you  
You know that love can move you  
  
And I breathe the love youve given  
And I feel the love youve hidden  
Its cold down here but I still I still say
