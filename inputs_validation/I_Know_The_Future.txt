feat Mack Maine  
  
Young money mothafucka  
Uhh huh  
Thats right  
Now dont you know  
Ima beast  
Eastside  
Up in tha beat  
  
Verse  
Straight from the bottom of the cut  
I give it to these bitch niggas like momma taught me  
One man with no weopon at war but Im an army  
My flow is capital attention lieutenant your penit pension  
And they demolished that invention  
You better get your dollars up  
And guess what I was up  
I get my cheese like mickey mouse  
Or else you better donald duck  
Like a shooting range target  
I get all kinda bucks  
Be my shooting range target  
Nigga I got good luck  
Nigga bye bye good luck  
Got your momma shook up  
Lil bad ass nigga who thought popeye wasnt tough  
Im on that lala twist it up  
Im on that syrup slow it down  
And I like four freeks too and I aint young jock but its going down  
I buy that marijuana field then I just smoke it down  
Big bad wolf yes I just blow it down  
No homo and to holly grove I will hold it down  
Like a circle of knives I got the sharpest flow around  
  
Chorus  
Future I know

Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world  
Future I know  
Future I know

Future I know  
Future I know  
Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world  
  
Verse 2  
Bitch Im Mack Maine  
I got tha heart of a king blood of a slave  
Feel like I been there before my second time to the grave  
But its one life to live thats why Im gettin paid  
Off a flow thats priceless I just got it appraised  
Spit like I need a raise  
Blaze as I gaze at the stars and ask the lord  
Why the culprit at the pall pit  
It make me sick to my stomach  
Thats why I rap like a pregnant woman I dont spit I vomit  
So pay homage me and wayne two Gs  
Like twenty hundreds  
And we keep the semis blunted  
And we live like brothas from anotha  
So fuck with him and mack gonna react like you did me something  
Thats a hint to you David  
Throwin shots at Goliath  
This the new testament where the victor is tha giant  
So you should get your way and lose the hate  
Remember males shouldnt be jealous thats a females trait  
  
Chorus  
Future I know  
Future I know  
Future I know  
Future I know  
Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world  
Future I know  
Future I know  
Future I know  
Future I know  
Future I know  
Future I know  
Future I know  
Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world
