Im getting edgy all the time  
Theres someone around me just a step behind  
Its kinda scary the shape Im in  
The walls are shakin and theyre closing in  
  
Too fast or a bit too slow  
Im paranoid of people and its starting to show  
Theres one guy that I cant shake  
Over my shoulder is a big mistake  
  
Sitting on the bed  
Or lying wide awake  
Theres demons in my head  
And its more than I can take  
  
Chorus  
I think Im on a roll  
But I think its kinda weak  
Saying all I know is  
I gotta get away from me  
  
I tell you something just aint right  
My head is on loose but my shoes are tight  
Avoiding my friends cause they all bug  
Life is a riddle and Im really stumped  
  
If you reason dont you know  
Your own preoccupation is where youll go  
I think Im being followed I look around  
Its only my shadow creepin on the ground  
  
Chorus
