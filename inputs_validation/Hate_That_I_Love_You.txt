Thats how much I love you  
Thats how much I need you  
And I cant stand you  
Must everything you do make me wanna smile  
Can I not like you for awhile No  
  
But you wont let me  
You upset me girl  
And then you kiss my lips  
All of a sudden I forget that I was upset  
Cant remember what you did  
  
But I hate it You know exactly what to do  
So that I cant stay mad at you  
For too long thats wrong  
  
But I hate it You know exactly how to touch  
So that I dont want to fuss and fight no more  
Said I despise that I adore you  
  
And I hate how much I love you boy yeah  
I cant stand how much I need you I need you  
And I hate how much I love you boy ooh whoa  
But I just cant let you go  
And I hate that I love you so ooh  
  
And you completely know the power that you have the power that you have  
The only one makes me laugh one that makes you laugh  
  
Sad and its not fair  
How you take advantage of the fact  
That I love you beyond a reason why  
And it just aint right  
  
And I hate how much I love you girl  
I cant stand how much I need you yeah  
And I hate how much I love you girl  
But I just cant let you go  
But I hate that I love you so  
  
One of these days maybe your magic wont affect me  
And your kiss wont make me weak  
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me  
So youll probably always have a spell on me  
Yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Thats how much I love you how much I need you  
Thats how much I need you how much I love you  
Thats how much I love you Oh need you  
Thats how much I need you I need you  
  
And I hate that I love you so  
And I hate how much I love you boy  
I cant stand how much I need ya I cant stand how much I need you  
And I hate how much I love you boy  
But I just cant let you go but I just cant let you go no  
And I hate that I love you so ooh  
  
And I hate that I love you so so
