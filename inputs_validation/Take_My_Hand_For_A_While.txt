Take my hand for a while  
Explain it to me once again  
Just for the sake  
Of mywhy broken heart  
  
Look into my eyes  
And maybe I will understand  
How love I counted on  
Was never there  
  
You see II thought  
That you might love me  
  
So you caught me it seems  
Off balance with a heart so full  
Of love and pretty dreams  
That two should share  
  
And so II know  
But please before you go  
  
Take my hand for a while  
Explain it to me once again  
Just for the sake  
Of mywhy broken heart
