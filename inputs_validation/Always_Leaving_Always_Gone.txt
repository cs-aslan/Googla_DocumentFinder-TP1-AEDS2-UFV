Dusty dreams of yesterday of women in the snow  
Always leavin and always gone  
Reachin for the sparkle in the yello afternoon  
Always leavin and always gone  
Always leavin and always gooone  
Always gone  
  
The image of the girl appears there clearly upon my mind  
Always leavin and always gone  
Lost among the promises of the days Ill never fiind  
Always leavin and always gone  
Always leavin and always gooone  
Always gone  
  
I could hide the pain inside me but what would I win  
I would lose the right to live and turn the pain to siiiin  
So Ill find another way some other words to sing  
And whether youre stayin or leavin baby I lose everythiing  
  
Here I am another day just a wonderin where Im at  
Always leavin and always gone  
You fall on my memory but I try to get you there  
Always leavin and always gone  
Always leavin and always gooone  
Always gone  
  
Always leavin always goone  
Always leavin always goone  
Always leavin always goone
