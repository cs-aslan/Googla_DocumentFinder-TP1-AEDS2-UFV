Dont kiss my lips and say goodbye it makes me want you more  
Anyway I knew somebody like you once before  
I know that love is waiting for you farther down the line  
Candy in the window of my mind  
  
Youre candy in the window and Im that ragged child  
That came to town to stare into the window for awhile  
I wish you every happiness youll ever hope to find  
Sweet candy in the window of my mind  
  
Remember me for Im the one who never will forget  
Now you know the way life is you may decide you want me yet  
Take care sweeet heart and keep in touch if you can spare the time  
Candy in the window of my mind  
  
Youre candy in the window and Im that ragged child  
That came to town to stare into the window for awhile  
I wish you every happiness youll ever hope to find  
Candy in the window of my mind  
Sweet candy in the window of my mind
