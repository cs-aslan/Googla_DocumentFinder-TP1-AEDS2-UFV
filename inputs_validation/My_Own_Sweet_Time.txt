Hello goodbye my friend  
Feels like the start all over again  
But Id rather not pretend  
There arent things still left to mend  
Somebody break my fall  
Im slipping down all over again  
  
Im doing it all over  
Taking my own sweet time  
I may make it slower  
But Im taking my own sweet time  
Im taking my own sweet  
  
Tell me where I begin  
You cant deny whats already been  
I wont break but I can bend  
Shaping the scars that I cant mend  
Feel your fingers around my throat  
Theres nothing but bones beneath my skin  
Somebody break my fall  
Im slipping down all over again  
  
Im doing it all over  
Taking my own sweet time  
I may make it slower  
But Im taking my own sweet time  
Im taking my own sweet  
  
Im doing it all over my friend  
You know Id do it all over again  
  
Hello goodbye my friend  
Until we start all over again  
Somebody break my fall  
Im slipping down all over again  
  
Im doing it all over  
Taking my own sweet time  
I may make it slower  
But Im taking my own sweet time  
Im taking my own sweet time
