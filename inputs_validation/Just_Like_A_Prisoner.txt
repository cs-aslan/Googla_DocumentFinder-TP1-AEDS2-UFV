Chorus  
Just like a prisoner  
He dont know right from wrong  
Just like a baby  
He sings a pleading song  
  
And thats why  
So many tears must fall  
Yes thats why  
So many tears must fall  
  
Just like a sailor  
He steers away from home  
He feels a tidal wave  
In his heart but he aint alone  
  
Chorus  
  
Im like that prisoner  
I dont know right from wrong  
Just like that baby  
I sing a pleading song  
  
And thats why  
Youll never know how I feel  
Yes thats why  
Youll never know how I feel
