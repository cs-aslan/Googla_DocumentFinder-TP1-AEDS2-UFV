Baby theres something I like about you  
You make me feel so wild and free  
I dont know what youve been through  
Youre just crazy enough for me  
And when you touch me I come undone  
Do you do that to everyone  
  
Chorus  
Baby me Ill baby you  
I know that youre a big baby too  
This world is crazy you need someone to coo  
Baby me and Ill baby you  
Ooh Ill baby you  
  
Its past my bedtime I cant sleep alone  
Lay down beside me Ill pull out the phone  
Take me in your arms and rock me tonight  
Ill tell you a story if you hold me tight  
Cause when you touch me I come undone  
You better not do that to everyone
