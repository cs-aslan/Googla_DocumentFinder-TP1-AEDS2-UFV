Theres nothing in the way I walk that could tell you where Im going  
Theres nothing in the words I speak that can betray anything Im knowing  
Dont think about the way I dress you can fit me on a labeled shelf  
Dont pretend that you know me cause I dont even know myself  
Ooh I dont know myself  
  
I dont mind if you try once in a while  
I dont mind if I cry once in a while  
The doors arent shut as tight as they might seem  
Im just trying to fight my way out of this dream  
  
Dont listen to the words I say weighing up if Im enlightened  
Dont shiver as you pass me by cause mister Im the one whos frightened  
The police just came and left they wanted me and no one else  
Dont pretend that you know me cause I dont even know myself  
I said I dont know myself  
  
I dont mind if you try once in a while  
I dont mind if I cry once in a while  
The doors arent shut as tight as they might seem  
Im just trying to fight my way out of this dream  
  
Do you remember me I dont remember you  
Do you still love me you know I think you do  
I have been gone and some prison warder knows my scream  
Im just trying to fight my way out of this dream  
  
Theres only five who know my real name  
And my mother dont believe they know it  
What she called me is the way Im staying  
And no onell ever know it  
Come on all of you big boys come on all of you elves  
Dont pretend that you know me cause I dont even know myself  
I said I dont know myself  
  
I dont mind if you try once in a while  
And I dont mind if I cry once in a while
