I hear voices  
Inside my head  
Can I deceive  
Can I believe  
My whispering friends  
What do I hear  
About war and peace  
What do I hear  
About love and sex  
Im delirious  
For an answer  
Im delirious  
For an answer  
Taking me deeper  
And deeper in mind  
Taking me deeper  
And deeper in mind  
  
Fascination for  
Limits of love  
Should I aim higher  
And higher and higher  
Will I break you  
Like some possession  
To leave my lesson  
  
Taking me deeper  
And deeper in mind  
Taking me deeper  
And deeper in mind  
Im only looking  
Taking me deeper  
And deeper in mind
