How does she know that you love her  
How Do you show her you love her  
How does she know that you really really truly love her  
Its not enuogh to take the one you love for granted  
You must remind her or shell be inclined To say  
How do I know he loves me  
How do I know hes mine  
Well does he leave you a little note to tell you  
You are on his mind  
Does he send you  
Yellow flowers when the sky is gray yeah  
Hell find a new way to show you a little  
Bit everyday  
Thats how you know thats how you know hes your love  
Everybody wants to live happily ever after  
Everybody wants to know that true love is true  
How do you know he loves you how do you know hes yours  
Does he take you out dancing just  
So he can hold you close  
Dedicate a song with words meant just for you  
Hell find a new way to show you with the little things hell do  
Thats how you know thats how you know hes you love  
Hes you love  
Thats haow you know  
How do you know  
How does she know that you love her  
How do you show her you love her  
How does she know that you really really truly love her  
Thats how you know  
Because hell wear your favorite color just so he canmatch your eyes  
Rent a private pinic by the fire glow oh oh  
His heart will be yours forever something everyday will show
