Lets go to the park lets go watch em floodin out there after dark  
Dont have to think of nothin and I love that for for the way Im feeling
700 foot 700 foot ceiling  
  
Lets take it to the top of the tobacco nation we can aim the dish for
hardcore invitations and I hate that for for the things Im thinking when the
clouds are low 700 are sinking  
  
Its part hard hard to remember its part hard to say parts unknown  
Unknown forever and those parts fade away but leanings toward toward a full
stops all I hear you say  
  
One foot on the stump the others on the pulpit 700 foot  
700 foot pulpit and I love that for for the way Im feeling 700 foot  
700 foot ceiling in our own backyard we can do some floodin when its cold
and dark  
Dont have to think or nothin
