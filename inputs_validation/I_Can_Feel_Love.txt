I feel love  
  
I couldnt believe it happened to me  
You knocked me away  
So close to my heart dont know who you are  
So sudden but maybe too far  
How could I believe it  
Finding us here where we are  
I still dont know who you are  
  
I can feel love I can feel love in your eyes  
Im finding my way to your heart  
I can feel love in my mind  
And it doesnt matter whatever youre saying  
In everything you show me I feel love  
  
So much I have seen so far I have been  
But never so close  
So deep in my soul so much Ive been told  
That love is a heartbreaking game  
How can I believe it  
Finding us here where we are  
Ive never been so far  
  
I can feel loveI can feel love in your eyes  
Im finding my way to your heart  
I can feel love in my mind  
And it doesnt matter whatever youre saying  
In everything you show me I feel love  
  
And I know deep in my heart  
Nothing could ever bring me down  
When you feel love you know who you are  
Its moving you on and on  
  
I can feel loveI can feel love in your eyes  
Im finding my way to your heart  
I can feel love in my mind  
And it doesnt matter whatever youre saying  
In everything you show me I feel love
