Sweet woman are you feeling right  
What was it that you did last night  
You made me crazy you made me fly  
I cant forget the hungry look in your eye  
Ooh whats the matter with me  
Im just a runner I was born free  
But since I met you I cant leave you alone  
Im leaving now but Ill be coming home  
  
Keep it warm rat the place by your side  
Nobodys gonna take away our magical ride  
Keep it warm for when we talk on the phone  
Dont forget will you pretty one that your man is coming home  
  
Dyou hear the rumour that is going around  
Say Im ruined cause Ive settled down  
Its not true well maybe half and half  
You know I love you but I still like a laugh  
Ooh Im feeling fine I got it right for the first time  
Sweet woman I cant stay for long but everybody will be prove wrong  
  
Im like a gypsy I need to roam  
But dont worry Ill be coming home  
I need the danger I need the thrill  
I need to know what is over each hill  
Ooh Im a different man Im still running but you understand  
Since I met you I cant leave you alone  
Im leaving now but Ill be coming home
