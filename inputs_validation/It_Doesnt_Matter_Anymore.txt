There you go and baby here am I oh well you left me here so I could sit and
cry  
Oh will you apology what have you done to me but it really doesnt matter
anymore  
Do you remember baby last September when you held me tight each and every
night  
Oh well you was so dazy how you drove me crazy but it really doesnt matter
anymore  
Theres no use in me of cryin Ive done everything and now I keep on tryin  
Ive thrown away my nights wasted all my days over you  
Youll go your way Ill go mine now and forever till the end of time  
Ill find somebody new and baby well say were through  
Honey you wont matter anymore  
  
Do you remember baby last September  
No sugar you wont matter anymore
