Hey come old Blackeye  
Hes looking for me again  
Hes got a hard head  
Hes always stinkin of gin  
If he thinks he owns me  
He better think again  
He likes to hurt me  
He dont love me at all  
He never phones me  
Hes never there when I call  
Hes a low down dirty dog  
Its time I leave him thats all  
Bye bye Blackeye  
Hes a low down dirty dog  
I dont need him at all  
Hey watch what Im saying man  
Hey where you goin Blackeye   
When will you win  
You still got your shoulder holster  
You still packin yo little friend  
Well one things for certain  
Youre never gonna wipe that smile off my face again  
Oh yeah
