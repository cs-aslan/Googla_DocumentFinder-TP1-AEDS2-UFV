Dont set me free  
And leave me all alone  
Dont make me be  
Just a rolling stone  
Lock me up and throw the key away  
Make me a prisoner night and day  
And whatever you do to me  
Dont set me free  
Dont set me free  
On my knees I pray  
Have mercy on me  
Dont send me away  
Like a train jumpin off a track  
Without ya baby Id blow my stack  
And whatever you do to me  
Dont set me free  
Like a stamp on a letter if you let me stick with you  
I could love you better than anyone else can do  
So dont set me free  
Though Ive done you wrong  
Baby cant you see  
Without you I cant get along  
Keep me in a state of agony  
Make me miserable as can be  
And whatever you do to me  
Dont set me free  
Like a stamp on a letter if you let me stick with you  
I could love you better than anyone else can do  
So dont set me free  
Though Ive done you wrong  
Baby cant you see  
Without you I cant get along  
Keep me in a state of agony  
Make me miserable as can be  
And whatever you do to me  
Dont set me free  
No no no dont set me free  
Im saying no no dont set me free  
Baby no no dont set me free
