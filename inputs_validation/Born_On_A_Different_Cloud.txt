Born on a different cloud  
From the ones that have burst round town  
Its no surprise to me  
That youre classless clever and free  
  
Loaded just like a gun  
Youre the hero thats still unsung  
Living on borrowed time  
Youre my sun and youre gonna shine  
  
Talking to myself again  
This time I think Im getting through  
Its funny how you think  
Its funny how its funny how when you do  
  
Born on a different cloud  
From the ones that have burst round town  
Its no surprise to me  
That youre classless clever and free  
  
Lonely soul  
Busy working overtime  
Nothing ever gets done  
Especially when your hands are tied  
  
Lonely soul  
Baking up your mothers pride  
Nothing ever gets done  
Not until your wars won  
  
Born on a different cloud  
Youre born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud
