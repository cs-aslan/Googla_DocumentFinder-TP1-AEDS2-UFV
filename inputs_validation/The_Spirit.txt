The sun and moon every day  
Day and night mark my play  
See the future in the past  
Try to change or make it last  
Go for broke dont regret  
Get your hands dirty get your feet wet  
Take your place use me well  
Im in your hands so make me tell  
A broken dream seems unkind  
But I can help for I am time  
I can heal you  
Its not a matter of sleight  
Only of sound  
Let me feel for you  
Feel for yourself  
The love all around  
I can lead you  
Is your soul afraid  
Of what youve made  
Do you know the way  
The spirit goes  
  
All around on the wind  
Distant whispers of what I bring  
In the day in the night  
Locked in the words of lovers delight  
If Im lost or mislaid  
Just keep looking dont be afraid  
In the eye on the mind  
Im everything and yours to find  
Im not far just discover  
Im in you for I am love  
  
I can heal you  
Its not a matter of sleight  
Only of sound  
Let me feel for you  
Feel for yourself  
The love all around  
I can lead you  
Is your soul afraid  
Of what youve made  
Do you know the way  
The spirit goes
