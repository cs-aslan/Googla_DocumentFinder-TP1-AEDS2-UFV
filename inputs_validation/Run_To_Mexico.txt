Come on baby dont you want to go  
I could take you there  
You could get what you want in the south  
You could let down your hair  
  
I said do you dont you will you wont you  
Baby wont you please let me know  
I aint talkin bout Chicago

Na na na na na

Makin a run for Mexico  
Makin a run for Mexico  
  
Could you  
Come on baby cause I got to know  
The law is after me  
I killed a man in a bar last night  
  
There was no other way it could be  
While the air in this joint could be cut with a knife  
As the jukebox got rotten selections  
Bring a compass and some money for gas  
  
Cause I aint gonna stop for directions  
Not to Mexico  
Na na na na na  
Makin a run to Mexico  
  
Na na na na na  
Makin a run to Mexico  
Could you  
Oh oh  
  
Come on baby dont you want to go  
I gotta get away  
And everytime the phone rings  
It scares me to death  
  
Saw my face in the paper today  
I dont want to hear the stories  
About your mama and papa  
No I dont want to hear you cry  
  
For me theres no second chance right now  
Its the F B fucking I
