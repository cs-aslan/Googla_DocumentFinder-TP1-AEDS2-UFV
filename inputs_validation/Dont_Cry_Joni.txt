Jimmy please say youll wait for me

Savin all my kisses just for you  
Signed with love forever true  
  
Joni was the girl who lived next door  
Ive known her I guess 10 years or more  
Joni wrote me a note one day  
And this is what she had to say  
  
Jimmy please say youll wait for me  
Ill grow up someday youll see  
Savin all my kisses just for you  
Signed with love forever true  
  
Slowly I read her note once more  
Then I went over to the house next door  
Her teardrops fell like rain that day  
When I told Joni what I had to say  
  
Joni Joni please dont cry  
Youll forget me by and by  
Youre just fifteen Im twenty two  
Joni I just cant wait for you  
  
Soon I left our little home town  
Got me a job and tried to settle down  
But her words kept haunting my memory  
The words that Joni said to me  
  
Jimmy please say youll wait for me  
Ill grow up someday youll see  
Savin all my kisses just for you  
Signed with love forever true  
  
I packed my clothes and I caught a plane  
I had to see Joni I had to explain  
How my heart was filled with her memory  
And ask my Joni if shed marry me  
  
I ran all the way to the house next door  
But things werent like they were before  
My teardrops fell like rain that day  
When I heard what Joni had to say  
  
Jimmy Jimmy please dont cry  
Youll forget me by and by  
Its been five years since youve been gone  
Jimmy I married your best friend John
