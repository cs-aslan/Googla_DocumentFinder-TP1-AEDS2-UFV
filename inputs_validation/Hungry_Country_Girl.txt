Now my babys a country girl  
And she just cant help herself  
Yes my babys a country girl  
And she just cant help herself  
And every time I tell her Im gonna leave her  
She say I dont want nobody else  
  
I sat around and cried  
til the tears run down my cheek  
Yes I sat around at night and cried  
til the tears run down my cheek  
I said Baby dont you worry  
I got you plenty milk and meat  
  
One day baby you gonna think your dads gone  
Oh baby Dont every think your daddys gone  
Well you know he right there with you  
Standing in blood and all  
  
Well I buys her everything she need  
She dont even have to go nowhere  
My baby gets everything she needs  
She dont even have to go nowhere  
Now God aughta bless me aughta bless me  
I even bought that girl some help  
  
Werent for lipstick and powder  
No I dont know what my baby would do  
Werent for lipstick and powder  
I dont know what in the world that girl would do  
But I love that woman in this story Im tellin you  
  
Baby honey do you feel alright  
Hey baby I wanna know do you feel alright  
I wanna love you baby  
If you tell me daddy you knew I aint tired tonight
