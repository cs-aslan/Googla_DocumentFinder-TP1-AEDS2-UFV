Times have changed  
for the better  
You like to say  
Nice house in the country  
Now youre on your way  
You took advantage of our possibilities  
Got your sights set far  
No time for sympathy  
  
Keeping up with the Joness  
Smiling at the neighbors  
Dont let them see your  
  
Dirty Dirty Little Secret  
Keep your hands over your eyes and  
Maybe it will go away  
Dirty Dirty little secret  
Joe McCarthy is alive and well today  
  
When you face the mirror  
Consider this  
Why judge another when youve got  
Your own shit to fix  
Theres no solution  
good enough for everyone  
And your interpretations dont work  
In every situation  
  
You side with your religion  
With your interpretation  
But dont let them see your  
  
Dirty Dirty Little Secret  
It seems the most opinionated  
Are the ones who hide their  
Dirty Dirty Little Secret  
Ill be leaving the status quo behind  
  
How can you know someone  
Until you walk in their shoes  
Our parents taught us segregation  
Now were singing the blues  
The dynamic of America is progress for all  
Well cant hold us back were right on the track  
No wall is too tall  
By the will of the people  
Well take a road to higher ground  
And dont worry about that  
  
Dirty Dirty Little Secret  
Everybodys got one  
So many you can pass them around  
Dirty Dirty Little Secret  
Ill be leaving the status quo behind
