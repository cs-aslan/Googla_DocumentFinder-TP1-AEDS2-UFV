85 miles out of Nashville thinkin bout  
The way things change  
Try an keep it by the reigns  
Im a lone drifter big money flipper  
Take anything you got on the rocks in snifter  
I missed her in Kentucky went down to Louisiana  
I never had no lovin like I had in Alabama  
A man of my word aint out to hurt nobody  
Im just a M see to keep the boogie in the party  
Been singin lodi dodi since 84  
And Ill be singin lodi dodi til Im 84  
I couldnt ask for more lifes been sweet  
So you can save the planet  
Ill save your seat  
  
I been gone for weeks I aint slept days  
I cant find myself in this self made maze  
Its been so long since Ive been fine  
Im just tryin to see the bottom of this bottle of wine  
And I know Ill see better days  
Well I know youll see things my way  
I never thought about change until  
Spend a little time where time stood still  
Been lookin for a mill but I keep comin up shy  
I been a broke fool I aint tryin to be that guy  
Want to ride like lightning roll like thunder  
Im tryin to get some money I aint getting any younger  
At times I wonder at times I wont  
Sometimes I give a fuck but most times I dont  
  
even care through stained glass windows these eyes stare  
I try to stay straight but its kickin my ass  
Every time I look ahead I get a glimpse of the past  
I sit half mass like a soldiers flag  
Thats why my left leg limps and my Dickies sag  
Its been so long since Ive been fine  
Im just tryin to see the bottom of this bottle of wine  
And I know Ill see better days  
Well I know youll see things my way  
And I know Ill see better days  
Well I know youll see things my way  
Well I been around this crooked land  
I come across walks I shook Jim Beams hand  
I got no plans and no place to go  
It keep getting harder to just say no  
I see the people laugh and people cry  
Thats how some live and thats how some die  
Well me myself Im gonna sit right here  
And Im a watch this world break down in tears  
All my fears and dark grey skies  
Couldnt crack my smile or break my stride  
Got too much pride I got too much shout  
I might be down but I still aint out  
Got too much time and thats all I have  
When I leave this world Ill still be sad  
Its been so long since Ive been fine  
Im just tryin to see the bottom of this bottle of wine  
And I know Ill see better days  
Well I know youll see things my way  
And I know Ill see better days  
Well I know youll see things my way
