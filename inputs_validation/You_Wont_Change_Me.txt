Im just a man and I am what I am  
Nobody will ever change my ways  
I dont need money and I dont need no lies  
I only need to live for today  
But Id like to talk things over with you  
I want to hear the things you say today  
Although you wont change my anyway no no way  
  
I wish youd come and see me Id like to hold you  
I want to set my mind all free  
You understand me woman you give me time  
But I dont need no sympathy  
Still I wonder what its like to be loved  
Instead of hiding in myself  
Nobody will change me anyway no no way  
  
Nobodys gonna change my world  
Thats something too unreal  
Nobody will change the way I feel  
  
So listen to me now hear what I say  
Please give me time and maybe love  
If theres a God up there well I hope he helps me  
I need him now to set me free  
Cause it may be that its over for me  
If you dont hear the things that I say today  
Nobody will change me anyway no no way  
  
Nobodys gonna change my world thats something too unreal  
Nobody will change the way I feel
