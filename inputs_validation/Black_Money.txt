Do you deal in black money  
Do you deal in black money  
Do you deal in black money  
Do you deal in black money  
  
Fortunes find you  
Cross out every emotion  
Standing right behind  
A shadow of devotion  
Somebody elses life  
Cannot be mine  
  
But when you love someone  
And they dont love you in return  
When you love someone  
Youve got money to burn  
  
Do you deal in black money  
Do you deal in black money  
Do you deal in black money  
Do you deal in black money  
  
I believe that  
Nothing could come between us  
Magic potions  
Wont you save them for dreamers  
Somebody elses life cannot be mine  
But when you love someone  
And they dont love you in return  
When you love someone  
Youve got money to burn  
  
Do you deal in black money  
Do you deal in black money  
Do you deal in black money  
Do you deal in black money  
  
Give me some love  
But dont waste my time  
Black money  
Ill love you again  
But you must be mine  
Black money  
Give me some love  
But dont waste my time  
Black money  
Fortunes find you  
Cross out every emotion  
Standing right behind  
A shadow of devotion  
Somebody elses life  
Cannot be mine  
  
But when you love someone  
And they dont love you in return  
When you love someone  
Youve got money to burn  
  
Do you deal in black money  
Do you deal in black money  
Do you deal in black money  
Do you deal in black money  
  
Give me some love  
But dont waste my time  
Black money  
Ill love you again  
But you must be mine  
Black money  
Give me some love  
But dont waste my time  
Black money
