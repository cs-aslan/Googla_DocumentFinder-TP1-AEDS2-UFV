Sain y niwl  
Gaunt y goydwig fwsog  
Gwenithfaen cen y coed ar lleuad  
Un gway fadenydd I dapestri bywyd  
  
Light shines bright beyond all the cities of gold  
On a road of bird song and chocolate shops  
Of buskers jugglers innkeepers welcoming call  
The sound of mist smell of mossgrown woods  
  
Weaving my wings from manycolored yarns  
Flying higher higher higher into the wild  
Weaving my world into tapestry of life  
Its fire golden in my Walden  
  
I will taste the manna in every tree  
Liquid honey and wine from the distant hills  
An early morning green wood concerto  
Greets my Walden with its eternal voice  
  
Weaving my wings from many colored yarns  
Flying higher higher higher into the wild  
Weaving my world into a tapestry of life  
Its fire golden in my Walden  
  
Weaving my wings from many colored yarns  
Flying higher higher higher into the wild  
Weaving my world into a tapestry of life  
Its fire golden in my Walden  
  
Weaving my wings from many colored yarns  
Flying higher higher higher higher higher higher higher higher higher
higher  
  
I do not wish to evade the world  
Yet I will forever build my own  
  
Forever build my own  
Forever my home
