John Hardy he was a desperate little man  
Carried two guns every day  
Shot a man down by the West Virginia line  
They saw John Hardy get away  
They saw John Hardy get away  
  
They cornered John Hardy on the Tombstone bridge  
He thought that he was free  
Til the deputy sheriff came and grabbed him by the arm  
Said Johnny come along with me  
Johnny come along with me  
  
John Hardy he stood inside his cell  
Tears running down his eyes  
Said Ive seen the death of many a poor boy  
Now Im ready to die  
Now Im ready to die  
  
Well Ive been to the east and Ive been to the west  
Ive been the whole world round  
Ive been to the north and Ive been to the south  
Now Im going to my hanging ground  
Im going to my hanging ground
