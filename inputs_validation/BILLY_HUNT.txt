If its not you moaning then its someone else  
Jumping down my throat every chance you get  
If its not you crying then its probably me  
youre the little dog messing up my tree  
Billy hunt is a magical world  
Full of strippers and long legged girls  
Clark Kents got nothing on me  
Ill spy like James Bond and die like King Kong  
  
Chorus  
Billy hunt billy hunt billy billy billy  
Billy hunt billy hunt billy billy billy  
  
I remember the first day at my job  
I didnt get along with the foreman bob  
Do this do that dont even stop for a cough  
He used to be a sergeant in the raf  
  
No one pushes billy hunt around  
Well they do but not for long  
cause when I get fit and grow bionic arms  
The whole worlds gonna wish it werent born  
  
I could be a superman  
Satisfy any whim that I wanted to  
I could be a human machine  
I could show Steve Austin a thing or two  
  
If its not you moaning then its someone else  
Jumping down my throat every chance you get  
If its not you crying then its probably me  
youre the little dog messing up my tree  
  
No one pushes billy hunt around  
Well they do but not for long  
cause when I get fit and grow bionic arms  
The whole worlds gonna wish it werent born  
  
Chorus
