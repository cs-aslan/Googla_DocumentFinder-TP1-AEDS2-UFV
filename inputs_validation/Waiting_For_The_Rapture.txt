I still dont know what I was waiting for  
A big love to fall down from the sky  
She took my hand and picked me up off the floor  
She put an apple in my eye  
  
Chorus  
I said Im tired  
Come get me off the merrygoround  
Im wired  
Come feed me and then bringame down  
  
She come up to me  
I cant remember what she said  
Cause I was in a trance and I forgot it all  
Banging on about all that  
Revolution in her head  
Shed make a lover seem so magical  
  
She said Im tired  
Come get me off the merrygoround  
Im wired  
Well heaven must have sent ya  
To save me from the rapture  
  
Chorus
