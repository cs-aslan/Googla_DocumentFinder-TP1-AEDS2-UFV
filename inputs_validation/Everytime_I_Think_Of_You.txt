I wrote a letter but I threw it away  
I cant forget you thats what I want to say  
Anytime or place just to see your face  
Everytime I think of you  
You know it makes me sad  
That you feel this way cause I want you so bad  
And it dont seem right that you wont be here tonight  
Everytime I think of you  
  
Everytime I think of you I want to shout about it  
But waitings so hard when you live without love  
Ohohohoh everytime I think of you  
  
Theres nothing left at all  
Only a photograph ahanging on my wall  
It was my mistake but its my heart that aches  
Everytime I think of you  
  
Everytime I think of you I want to shout about it  
But waitings so hard when you live without love  
Ohohohoh everytime I  
  
I wrote a letter down to let you know  
That I still want you and I just cant let go  
And it still aint right that you wont be here tonight  
Everytime I think of you  
  
Everytime I think of you I want to shout about it  
But waitings so hard when you live without love  
Ohohohoh everytime I think of you  
Everytime I think of you  
Everytime I think of you  
Everytime I think of you
