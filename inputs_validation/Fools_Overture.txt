History recalls how great the fall can be  
While everybodys sleeping the boats put out to sea  
Borne on the wings of time  
It seemed the answers were so easy to find  
Too late the prophets profits cry  
The islands sinking lets take to the sky  
  
Called the man a fool striped him of his pride  
Everyone was laughing up until the day he died  
And though the wound went deep  
Still hes calling us out of our sleep  
My friends were not alone  
He waits in silence to lead us all home  
  
So tell me that you find it hard to grow  
Well I know I know I know  
And you tell me that youve many seeds to sow  
Well I know I know I know  
  
Can you hear what Im saying  
Can you see the parts that Im playing  
Holy Man Rocker Man Come on Queenie  
Joker Man Spider Man Blue Eyed Meanie  
  
So you found your solution  
What will be your last contribution  
Live it up rip it up why so lazy  
Give it out dish it out lets go crazy  
Yeah
