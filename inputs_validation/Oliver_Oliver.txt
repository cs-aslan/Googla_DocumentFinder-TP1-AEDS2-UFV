Mr Bumble Oliver Oliver  
Never before has a boy wanted more  
Oliver Oliver  
Wont ask for more when he knows whats in store  
Theres a dark thin winding stairway without any banister  
Which well throw him down  
And feed him the cockroaches served in a canister

What will he do when hes turned black and blue  
He will rue the day somebody named him Oliver  
  
Both Oliver Oliver  
Never before has a boy wanted more

Which well throw him down  
And feed him the cockroaches served in a canister
