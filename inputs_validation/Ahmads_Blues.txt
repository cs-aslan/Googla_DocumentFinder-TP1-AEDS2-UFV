I go through the strangest kind of changes  
Tryin to find myself a way to pay my dues  
And would you believe it Im so urban  
My suburban friends dont know my bag of blues  
Im up in the morning on the corner so siditty  
  
That youd hardly know its me  
And late in the evening when Im mellow  
Theres my fellow with the world for me to see  
Its a world full of cocktails at nine  
And dinners and wine very late shows  
And where the crowd goes  
  
Im a girl with a world of her owna queen on her throne  
Till everythings gone and then  
I wake up to find that Im a stranger  
In a world where I have never before  
I look for my man who held my hand  
  
But now I know that hell be coming back no more  
Im telling you bout this bag of blues  
Paid a whole lotta dues baby  
Gonna change my way of livin talkin bags of blues  
Mister dont you see Im paying dues  
Gonna change me some shoes baby  
  
Walkin in a daze to my apartment where Ill grab another wink  
And doze on the sofa til eleven then get up and pour myself another drink  
While back at the party Ill be hardy while Im waitin for some better news  
But now in the meantime Ill just sit right here and cool it  
Were gonna cool it now and listen to the rhythm  
Ahmads blues
