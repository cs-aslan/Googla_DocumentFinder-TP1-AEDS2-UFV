Yet another early morning and you walk in like its nothing  
Hold up hold up hold up  
Aint donuts aint no coffee  
See ya know ya see me calling and calling  
I should crack ya right in ya forehead  
  
Let me take a breathe Let me take a breathe  
And regain my composure  
Told you one more time Told you one more time  
If you fd up its over  
When its gone its gone its gone its gone its gone  
You dead wrong so wrong so wrong so wrong so wrong  
So just scoo do do doot baby  
  
Chorus  
Its a wrap for you baby Its a wrap  
Its a wrap for you boy Its a wrap  
Oh baby  
  
If I ever misrepresented my selfimage  
Then Im sorry  
I was oh so acquiescent  
But I learn my lesson  
Boy you sorry  
Buh buh buh  
All out in the open  
Dont make me go call Maury Povich  
  
Let me take a breathe Let me take a breathe  
And regain my composure  
Told you one more time Told you one more time  
If you fd up its over  
When its gone its gone its gone its gone its gone  
You dead wrong so wrong so wrong so wrong so wrong  
So just scoo do do doot baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Put all of your shit in the elevator  
Its going down like a denominator  
Trying to keep holding on holding on  
Boy let me go  
You go wake my neighbors get away from my door  
That was your last shot you aint coming back  
Its the martini I mean it baby  
Its wrap  
  
When its gone its gone its gone its gone  
You dead wrong so wrong so wrong so wrong so wrong you dead wrong  
So just scoo do do doot baby  
Boy I aint playing a game  
I told you I told you  
If you fd up one more time its over Its wrap  
So get out of my face its over  
Been sitting here all night leave me alone  
Since one oclock AM been drinking patron  
Let the credits role its a wrap
