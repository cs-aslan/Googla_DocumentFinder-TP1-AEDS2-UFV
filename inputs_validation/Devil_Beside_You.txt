Just by the look of it  
As in the way you wrote me off  
Im not supposed to see  
Your eyes tell lies your mouth could never spill  
I wasnt feeling it  
I dont even need to shake your hand  
Guess you were born to quit  
Your eyes tell lies your mouth could never spill  
Eyes tell lies your mouth could never spill  
So nice to meet you  
I see right through that smile  
So in other words  
So nice to meet you  
I hope I never see your face again  
You dont want a part of it  
Dont wanna be seen with a type like you  
I know you were born to quit  
Your eyes tell lies your mouth could never spill  
Can we get on with it  
We both need to go our separate ways  
Never be seen again  
Your eyes tell lies your mouth could never spill  
Eyes tell lies your mouth could never spill  
So nice to meet you  
I see right through that smile  
So in other words  
So nice to meet you  
I hope I never see your face again  
Devil beside you  
To watch you die when you cant find a remedy  
So nice to meet you  
I hope I never see your face  
I hope I never see your face again  
I hope I never see  
Hope I never see your face  
I hope I I hope I I hope I  
I hope I never see your face  
So nice to meet you  
I see right through that smile  
So in other words  
So nice to meet you  
I hope I never see your face again  
Devil beside you  
To watch you die cause you cant find a remedy  
So nice to meet you  
I hope I never see your face  
I hope I never see your face again
