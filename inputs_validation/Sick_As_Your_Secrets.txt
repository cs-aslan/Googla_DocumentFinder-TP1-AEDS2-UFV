Sick  
Sick of the night  
Sick of the day  
Sick of the sun that burns you  
White  
Knuckling it  
Wasting away  
Color yourself back in again  
Youre as sick as your secrets  
Youre as sick as your secrets  
Youre as sick as your secrets  
Slip  
Into the bath  
Into the grey  
Hating yourself so much it hurts  
Wake  
Up from a nap  
Wish you were brave  
But youre not that kind of person  
Youre as sick as your secrets  
Youre sick of it  
Youre as sick as your secrets  
Youre sick of it  
Youre as sick as your secrets  
Youre sick of it all  
Ill take you back  
Ill take you on  
I want you to crack  
I want you to crawl  
Ill take your mistakes  
I want you to break  
Ill bring you home  
Scared  
Scared of yourself  
And what you might say  
So you just let the phone ring  
Hey  
You could come back  
Back to LA  
You used to like the summer
