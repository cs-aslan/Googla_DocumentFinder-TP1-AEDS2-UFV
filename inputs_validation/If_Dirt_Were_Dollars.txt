Walkin like a millionaire  
Smilin like a king  
He leaned his shopping cart against the wall  
He said I been a lot of places  
And I seen a lot of things  
But sonny I seen one thing that beats em all  
I was flyin back from Lubbock  
I saw Jesus on the planeor maybe it was Elvis  
You know they kinda look the same  
Hey look out Junior youre steppin on my bed  
I said I dont see nothin  
He just glared at me and said  
If dirt were dollars  
If dirt were dollars  
If dirt were dollars  
I wouldnt worry anymore  
Lookin like a beauty queen  
Loyal as a wife  
She raised her little voice and testified  
I am a good girlIve been one all my life  
But her virtue was as swollen as her pride  
She shouldve had the Oscar  
She must have been miscast  
Her fifteen minutes went by so fast  
I said Now baby have you got no shame  
She just looked at me uncomprehendingly  
Like cows at a passing trainIf dirt were dollars  
If dirt were dollars  
If dirt were dollars  
I wouldnt worry anymore  
We got the bully pulpit  
And the poisoned pen  
We got a press no better  
Than the public men  
This brave new world  
Gone bad again  
Gods finest little creatures  
Looking brave and strong  
Whistling past the graveyard  
Nothing can go wrong  
Quoting from the scriptures  
With patriotic tears  
We got the same old men  
With the same old fears  
Standing at attention  
Wrapped in stars and stripes  
They hear the phantom drummers  
And the nonexistent pipes  
These days the buck stops nowhere  
No one takes the blame  
But evil is still evilIn anybodys name  
If dirt were dollarsIf dirt were dollars  
If dirt were dollars  
Wed all be in the black
