There was a hint of danger  
They told him its ok  
There was a chance of failure  
They told him its alright  
A false security driven by  
A weakened state of mind  
Its calling and calling  
  
He had a big decision  
They told him its ok  
Bound by his inhibitions  
They told him its alright  
Time for reality  
Time to gain control of his own life  
Its calling and calling  
  
Do you know what is wrong  
Try to keep it in line  
You cant go back cant go back  
There must be something  
  
He tried  
Once was not enough  
They told him its alright  
He tried  
Wasnt good enough  
That doesnt make it right
