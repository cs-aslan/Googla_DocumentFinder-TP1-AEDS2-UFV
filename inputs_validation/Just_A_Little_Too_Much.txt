Sometimes I think I love you  
Just a little too much  
You know you thrill me baby  
With you magic touch  
Thats why I want you honey  
And I love you like I do  
Im gonna scream and shout it  
There aint no doubt about it  
Thats why I love you like I do  
  
Sometimes I think you kiss me  
Just a little too much  
You drive me crazy baby  
With your magic touch  
You make me feel so good  
When the moon is shining bright  
With our lips together  
And youre squeezin me so tight  
  
Now I went steady once before  
Thought I loved the boy next door  
He stepped out on me you see  
He couldnt be true  
Now I got over all my dreams  
Time went by so fast it seems  
Now I know Ill never get over you  
Well all right all right  
  
Sometimes I think I love you  
Just a little too much  
You know you thrill me baby  
With you magic touch  
Thats why I want you honey  
And I love you like I do  
Im gonna scream and shout it  
There aint no doubt about it  
Thats why I love you like I do  
Thats why I love you like I do
