feat Mark Knopfler  
  
My mamma and my daddy  
Told me that love is a twoway street  
But lately baby youve been finding  
New ways of dragging yout feet  
So come on make your best shot  
You dont have to take the blame  
Ill be your belle star  
You can be my Jesse James  
  
Theres lonely people everywhere  
From Abilene to Arkansas  
The way they run for cover  
Youd think love was against the law  
Well i dont need a pistol  baby  
You wont have to rob a train  
You can be my belle star  
And i can be your Jesse James  
  
I know youve done some hard time  
Baby and youve got your doubts  
When you feel surrounded  
And its looking theres no way out  
Ill come riding to rescue  
All you gotta do is call my name  
Ill be your belle star  
You can be my Jesse James  
  
It dont take a genius baby  
There aint no big mystery  
You cant play it safe  
And still go down in history  
So saddle up the horses  
Cos were headed for the hall of fame  
Ill be your belle star  
You can be my Jesse James  
Ill be your belle star  
You can be my Jesse James
