Gonna run running from the city  
Gonna run running to the country  
Gonna run running from the city  
Gotta ease my aching mind oh yeah  
  
Gonna hide hiding from the smoke fumes  
Gonna hide sing myself some new tunes  
Gonna hide hiding from the smoke fumes  
Gotta clean myself inside oh yeah  
  
Gonna run runnin from the ego  
Gonna run to find out where the free go  
Gonna run runnin from the ego  
I want to free myself inside oh yeah  
  
Run run run Im running  
Yes Im running baby  
Running all night long  
Baby Im running  
  
Keep on running  
Yeah time is flying  
Yeah time is gone  
Yes Im running Im running Im running  
Gotta keep trying
