Wash your back so you wont stab mine  
Get in bed with your own kind  
Live your life so you dont see mine  
Drape your back so you wont shine  
  
Oooh then she hold my hand  
And I lie to get a smile x2  
  
Using what I want  
To get what you want x4  
  
Ooh sweet amber  
  
How sweet are you  
How sweet does it get x2  
  
Chase the rabbit fetch the stick  
She rolls me over till Im sick  
She deals in habits deals in pain  
I run away but Im back again  
  
Oooh then she holds my hand  
And I lie to get a smile  
And she squeezes tighter  
I still lie to get a smile  
  
Using what I want  
To get what you want x4  
  
Ooh sweet amber  
  
How sweet are you  
How sweet does it get x2  
  
She holds the pen that spells the end  
She traces me and draws me in x2  
  
Ooh sweet amber  
Ooh sweet amber  
  
How sweet are you  
Oooh how sweet does it get x2  
  
Its never as sweet as it seems
