Found on your move the very best of America and highway  
  
Yesterday she stood here with me  
I kissed her mouth I had her in my hands  
That kind of love it could last forever  
And together we made our plans  
  
And then I woke up today  
There on the table her letter lay  
Tellin me shes goin away  
  
Runaway boy have you seen a  
Girl like an angel runnin in the night  
Shes run away boy if you see her  
Im beggin you to stop her on sight  
  
Chorus  
If you see her tonight then stop her on sight  
Shes a runaway a runaway  
And why shed leave I still cant believe  
That she would run away run away  
Run away run away  
Shes a runaway  
  
I walked the streets through the heart of the city  
Go to the places where she might be  
I see her friends they say its a pity  
I get the same thing from everyone that I see  
  
Ill keep searchin if its gotta be  
And when I find her Ill make her see  
No other man could love her like me  
  
Runaway boy have you seen a  
Girl like an angel runnin in the night  
Shes run away boy if you see her  
Im beggin you to stop her on sight  
  
Chorus  
  
Run away run away  
If you see her tonight then stop her on sight  
Shes a runaway a runaway  
And why shed leave I still cant believe  
That she would run away run away  
  
If you see her tonight then stop her on sight  
Shes a runaway a runaway  
And why shed leave I still cant believe  
That she would run away run away
