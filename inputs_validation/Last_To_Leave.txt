Lonely sunshine days come easy  
Spend my time alone at rest  
And if I were the last to leave here  
Now would these roads be any less  
  
Oh Im the last to leave  
Now would these ribbon highway roads  
Be less wonderful to me  
Why must I always be so slow  
  
Many friends come and go  
You know theres a lot of feelings that Ive left behind  
And its a lonely world I know  
When your friends are hard to find  
  
But take the time my memory fails  
And soak my eyes in the morning rain  
Like a sailor sailing over Jordan  
On the road back home again  
  
Oh Im the last to leave  
Would these ribbon highway roads  
Be less wonderful to me  
Why must I always be so slow
