The crowd was getting old  
The discos back or so Im told  
But weve got nothing here  
Except a tired set of ears and we say  
  
Hey mama Im something  
Check it out see what its all about  
Cos this is soap disco so charming  
See the floor from a cleaner point of view  
  
The children had the time  
To overthrow the slime  
The superchildren said they could see  
  
Bright lights and clean colors  
Check it out see what its all about  
Cos this is soap disco so charming  
See the floor from a cleaner point of view
