I dont have the time of day  
I dont know what day I is  
Someones falling on my head  
Get up Get up  
Were going out on the raz  
  
Razzle dazzle  
Call it what you want  
To me it dont matter  
Its where I belong  
Its a matter of distinction  
A real fine line  
Between an orgy of destruction  
And a wonderful time  
  
This rooms so cold and bare  
Theres nothing here for me  
Ive got to find some heat somewhere  
Get up Get up  
Were going out on the raz  
  
Razzle dazzle  
Call it what you want  
It really doesnt matter  
When Im bangin on a gong  
While someones holding out  
To a willing congregation  
And we can all forget about  
The state of the nation  
  
Cant hear a thing  
But I see your lips are moving  
Im working on my thinking  
And I think its improving  
Im going to get the blame  
So I might as well deliver  
If only I can swim across  
This weird human river  
  
I know I started out  
With the best of intentions  
Some blinding inspiration  
And a few nottomention  
And now Im looking deep  
Into the last dying embers  
Shouting what are we doing here  
And nobody remembers  
  
Ive lost a friend or two  
I dont know where they have gone  
Only one thing I can do  
Get up Get up  
Im going out on the raz  
  
Razzle dazzle  
Call it what you want  
To me it dont matter  
Its where I belong  
Its a matter of distinction  
A real fine line  
Between an orgy of destruction  
And a wonderful time
