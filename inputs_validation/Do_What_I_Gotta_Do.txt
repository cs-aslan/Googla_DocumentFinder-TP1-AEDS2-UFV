It seems like every time I come around  
You say jay where have you been  
Cause you cant get your mind off all  
The things you hear from your friends  
Well I dont give a damn cause they dont understand  
The things that we do  
They dont even know me  
How the going to know whats best for you  
  
So I do what I gotta do Im gunna get through to you  
Im yours no doubt I do what I gotta do  
Im trying to get through to you right here right now  
  
Living in the city it can be so hard to stay on your feet  
A girl that why its good to know that Im there for you and youre there for
me  
While were trying to get that paper its a struggle just for us to get by  
But if we stick together we gon make it baby well be alright  
  
I do what I gotta do Im gunna get through to you Im yours no doubt  
I do what I gotta do Im trying to get through to you right here right now  
I do what I gotta do Im gunna get through to you Im yours no doubt  
I do what I gotta do Im trying to get through to you right here right now
