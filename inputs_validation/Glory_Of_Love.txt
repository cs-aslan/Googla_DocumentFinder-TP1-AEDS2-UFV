Youve got to give a little  
Take a little  
And let your poor heart break a little  
  
Thats the story of  
Thats the glory of love  
Youve got to laugh a little cry a little  
Before the clouds roll by a little  
  
Thats the story of  
Thats the glory of love  
As long as theres the two of you  
Youve got the world and all its charms  
And when the world is through with you  
Youve got each others arms  
  
Youve got to win a little Lose a little  
And always have the blues a little  
Thats the story of Thats the glory of love  
Thats the story of thats the glory of love
