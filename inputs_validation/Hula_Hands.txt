Lovely hula hands graceful as a bird in motion  
Riding like the doves over the ocean lovely hula hands  
Kah Li ma na niae  
Lovely hula hands telling of the rain in the valleys  
And the swirling winds over Na Pali lovely hula hands  
Kah Li ma na niae  
  
I can feel the soft caresses of your hula hands your lovely hula hands  
Every little move expresses so Ill understand all the tender meanings  
Of your hula hands fingertips that say Aloha  
Say to me again I love you lovely hula hands  
Kah Li ma na niae  
  
I can feel the soft caresses of your hula hands your lovely hula hands  
Every litte move expresses so Ill understand all the tender meanings  
Of your hula hands fingertips that say Aloha  
Say to me again I love you lovely hula hands  
Kah Li ma na niae
