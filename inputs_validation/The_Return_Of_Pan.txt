I stood upon the balcony with my brand new bride  
The clink of bells came drifting down the mountainside  
When in our sight something moved  
Lightning eyed and cloven hoofed  
The great god Pan is alive  
  
He moves amid the modern world in disguise  
Its possible to look into his immortal eyes  
Hes like a man youd meet anyplace  
Until you recognize that ancient face  
The great god Pan is alive  
  
At sea on a ship in a thunder storm  
On the very night that Christ was born  
A sailor heard from overhead  
A mighty voice cry
