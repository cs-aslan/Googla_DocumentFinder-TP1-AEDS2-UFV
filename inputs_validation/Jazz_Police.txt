Can you tell me why the bells are ringing  
Nothings happened in a million years  
Ive been sitting here since Wednesday morning  
Wednesday morning cant believe my ears  
Jazz police are looking through my folders  
Jazz police are talking to my niece  
Jazz police have got their final orders  
Jazzer drop your axe its Jazz police  
  
Jesus taken serious by the many  
Jesus taken joyous by a few  
Jazz police are paid by J Paul Getty  
Jazzers paid by J Paul Getty II  
  
Jazz police I hear you calling  
Jazz police I feel so blue  
Jazz police I think Im falling  
Im falling for you  
  
Wild as any freedom loving racist  
I applaud the actions of the chief  
Tell me now oh beautiful and spacious  
Am I in trouble with the Jazz police  
  
Jazz police are looking through my folders  
  
They will never understand our culture  
Theyll never understand the Jazz police  
Jazz police are working for my mother  
Blood is thicker margarine than grease  
  
Let me be somebody I admire  
Let me be that muscle down the street  
Stick another turtle on the fire  
Guys like me are mad for turtle meat  
  
Jazz police I hear you calling  
Jazz police I feel so blue  
Jazz police I think Im falling  
Im falling for you
