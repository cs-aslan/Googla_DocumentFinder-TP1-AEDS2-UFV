Black and white  
Male female  
For life and love  
Black and white  
Male female  
For life and love  
Sometimes when I fly  
So high  
Slowly in the sky  
Myiten shamai kerioh  
Hamah gurah Vhamaym ka li retoh  
Ha samovim rachuah  
Hamah hareh al kah teruah  
For life and love  
For life and love  
Floating as I find  
My dreams aid me for the night  
For life and love  
For life and love  
Floating as I find  
My dreams aid me for the night  
In the beginning Gd created  
The Heaven and the Earth  
And the light and the dark  
Gd created man  
In His own image  
In the image of Gd He created us  
Black and white  
Male female  
For life and love  
For life and love  
Sometimes when I fly  
So high  
Slowly in the sky  
Myiten shamai kerioh  
Hamah gurah Vhamaym ka li retoh  
Ha samovim rachuah  
Hamah hareh al kah teruah
