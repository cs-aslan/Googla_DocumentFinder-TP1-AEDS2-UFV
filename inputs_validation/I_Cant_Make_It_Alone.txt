Now you know me  
You know how proud I am  
And what Im gonna tell you now  
Wont be easy to say  
  
Before I left your side  
Ooh I was so happy then  
But Ive been so lonely  
Since Ive been away  
Oh baby  
  
Ive tried and I know I cant make it alone  
Its such a hard way to go  
I just cant make it alone  
Theres something in my soul  
That will always  
Lead me back to you  
  
What can I say now  
Sorry is just not good enough  
I couldnt blame you if you hurt me now  
The way I hurt you then  
  
But who else can I turn to  
Oh baby Im begging you  
Wont you reach out for my dying soul  
And make me live again  
Oh baby its so hard  
  
Ive tried and I know I cant make it alone  
Its such a hard way to go  
I just cant make it alone  
Theres something in my soul  
That will always  
Lead me back to you  
  
Baby help me  
Ive tried and I know I cant make it alone  
Its such a hard way to go  
And I cant make it alone  
Theres something in my soul  
That will always  
Lead me back to you  
  
Oh help me  
Please help me  
You know I need you  
I need you  
Im saying that I need you  
I just cant make it by myself  
I just cant make it by myself  
I just cant make it all alone  
I just cant make it all alone  
I just cant make it by myself  
I just cant make it by myself  
Come on baby
