She was she was  
She was all that she said she was  
She was all that she said she was  
I couldnt want for more  
But all I want is more  
I just want her more and more  
And more and more and more  
But shes untouchable  
  
And I lay my head down  
I lay my head down  
And then shes lovable  
  
Who were you with last night  
Who were you with last night  
Were you thinking of me  
And were you thinking of me  
Unforgivable sin unforgivable sin  
Unforgivable  
Youre untouchable  
  
And I lay my head down  
I lay my head down  
  
She coming my way  
She coming my way  
I dont know what to say  
She coming my way  
She fading away  
She fading away  
And I lay my head down  
I lay my head down
