Standing here alone with you  
Wondering what it is that Im supposed to do  
And there you are with the love light in your eye  
The bridges are burnt down  
Your arms are open wide  
Am I in too deep or should I swim to the shore  
Is this the real thing  
  
I dont know but Ive never been here before  
And I feel a thunder in my heart that I cant control  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Should I walk away or follow my soul  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Where it comes from I just dont know  
  
Oh no oh no  
  
Theres a storm ragin deep in my soul  
Theres a howlin wind that I just cant control  
Theresa fire inside me I cant explain  
Every time you touch me my love falls like rain  
Ive only known you for an hour or more  
The time is standin still  
Your love has opened up the door  
  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
It takes my breath away  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Will I ever be the same  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Its telling me youre here to stay  
  
Oh no oh no  
  
Theres a thunder in my heart  
Theres a thunder in my heart  
Theres a thunder in my heart  
Theres a thunder in my heart  
  
Take me baby Im all yours  
Do just what you wanna do with my love  
Lets not let the night overtake us  
Cause whats happening right now may make or break us  
Do you feel the way I do  
Open up your heart now baby  
Im comin through  
  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Takin my breath away  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Since I met you Ill never be the same  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
I know youre here to stay  
  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Takin my breath away  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Since I met you Ill never be the same  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
I know youre here to stay
