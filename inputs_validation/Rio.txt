When things get stale  
You get on a boat and sail to Rio  
The beaches and the sea  
Thats where I long to be  
In Rio  
But Im workin for the man every day up in the city  
Got to get away on a boat around the corner  
And its waiting there for you and me  
In Rio  
  
Dark eyed lady  
Drive Mercedes everywhere  
In Rio  
She said Do you want to take a ride  
So I jumped right in beside her  
In Rio  
  
But Im workin for the man every day up in the city  
Got to get away on a boat around the corner  
And its waiting there for you and me  
In Rio

Got to get away on a boat around the corner  
And its waiting there for you and me
