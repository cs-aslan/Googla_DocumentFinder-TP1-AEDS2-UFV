Your comin home  theres blood on the walls and charlie  
And the family made house calls If youre alone then watch  
What you do cos charlie and the family might get you  
  
Can you hear them in the darkness helter skelter spiral  
Madness yeah bloodbath in paradise but theres no where  
You can run to baby bloodbath in paradise forever sleep in  
Paradise  
  
California sun  but youre still in bed and the California rain  
Is turning red No sign of life or the keepers of doom in  
Charlie and the keepers scarlet room  
  
Can you hear them in the darkness helter skelter spiral  
Madness yah bloodbath in paradise but theres no where  
You can run to baby bloodbath in paradise  forever sleep in  
Paradise  
  
Theyll summon you to wake from the dead as you lie  
Bleeding murdered in your bed The sweetest dreams are all  
In your mind but no one wakes when charlie creeps behind  
Yeah  
  
Execution halts your breath helter skelter spiral death  
Bloodbath in paradise but theres no where you break out baby  
Bloodbath in paradise forever sleep in paradise
