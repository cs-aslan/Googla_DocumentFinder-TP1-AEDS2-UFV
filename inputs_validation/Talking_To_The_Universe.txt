Hey Yoko imagine a grapefruit and squeeze it on me  
Ah  
  
You say mustnt do this and that  
You say cant do this and that  
While youre losing your pants in a bullet proof car  
Losing your hair in a downtown bar  
Forget it just forget it  
Its the curse youre my curse it could be worse  
  
Im just talking to the universe  
Im just talking to the universe  
Im just talking to the universe  
Im just talking to the universe ooh listen  
  
You say mustnt have this and that  
You say cant have this and that  
While youre losing your apple and squeezing our balls  
Losing your mind and crawling up the walls  
Forget it just forget it  
Its the curse youre my curse it could be worse  
  
Im just talking to the universe  
Im just talking to the universe ooh  
Im just talking to the universe  
Im just talking to the universe ooh listen  
  
Ooh yeah do you wanna touch me Oh yeah  
Do you wanna break your mind boy  
  
Youre a dildo Im a whore  
Im a Barbie youre a whore  
Living in a glass house having fun  
Lying in a glass house watching the sun  
Forget it just forget it  
Its the curse you are my curse it could be worse  
  
Im just talking to the universe  
Im just talking to the universe  
Im just talking to the universe  
Im just talking to the universe  
  
Ooh
