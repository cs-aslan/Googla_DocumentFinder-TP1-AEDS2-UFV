Hello  
  
This is devo  
We would like  
to say Things go both ways  
New ideas stupid moves  
Nightmares or dreams come true  
Mucho work minus play  
Tension mounts in a twisted face  
Dark clouds in the crystal ball  
Tension mounts in a foreign place  
The screw turns someone calls  
  
Chorus x2  
Time out for fun  
Time out for fun  
  
So youre living under the gun  
Circumstances have you on the run  
A doctor frowns you feel bad  
Take this youve just been had  
  
Dont you lose it now listen to us  
Everythings going to be all right  
Take a break take some time  
Everythings going to be all right  
Dont you lose it remember to take  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont you lose it now listen to us  
Everythings going to be all right  
Take a break take some time  
Everythings going to be all right  
Dont you lose it remember to take  
  
Chorus x2  
  
So your life has just begun  
Somebody else is saying that its done  
Nurses whisper others grin  
Somethings funny at your expense again  
  
Dont you lose it now listen to us  
Everythings going to be all right  
Take a break take some time  
Everythings going to be all right  
Dont you lose it remember to take  
  
Chorus
