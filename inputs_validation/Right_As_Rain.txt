Who wants to be right as rain  
Its better when something is wrong  
You get excitement in your bones  
And everything you dos a game  
When night comes and youre on your own  
You can say I chose to be alone  
Who wants to be right as rain  
Its harder when youre on top  
  
Cause when hard work dont pay off  
And Im tired there aint no room in my bed  
As far as Im concerned  
So wipe that dirty smile off  
We wont be making up  
Ive cried my heart out  
And now Ive had enough of love  
  
Who wants to be riding high  
When youll just crumble back on down  
You give up everything you are  
And even then you dont get far  
They make believe that everything  
Is exactly what it seems  
But at least when youre at your worst  
You know how to feel things  
  
Cause when hard work dont pay off  
And Im tired there aint no room in my bed  
As far as Im concerned  
So wipe that dirty smile off  
We wont be making up  
Ive cried my heart out  
And now Ive had enough of love  
  
Go ahead and still my heart  
To make me cry again  
Cause it will never hurt  
As much as it did then  
We were both right  
And no one had blame  
But now I give up  
On this endless game  
  
Cause who wants to be right as rain  
Its better when something is wrong  
I get excitement in my bones  
Even though everythings a strain  
When night comes and Im on my own  
You should know I chose to be alone  
Who wants to be right as rain  
Its harder when youre on top  
  
Cause when hard work dont pay off  
And Im tired there aint no room in my bed  
As far as Im concerned  
So wipe that dirty smile off  
We wont be making up  
Ive cried my heart out  
And now Ive had enough of love  
  
No room in my bed  
As far as Im concerned  
So wipe that dirty smile off  
We wont be making up  
Ive cried my heart out  
And now Ive had enough of love
