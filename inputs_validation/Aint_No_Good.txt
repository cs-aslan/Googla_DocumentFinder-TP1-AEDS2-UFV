Shes gonna hand you a red headed Gabriel  
Coming from the bar in a plastic tie  
Hes gonna swing from the Tree of Life  
Hes gonna try to sell you on a great big lie  
  
But when you speak to her  
Her eyes light up  
The music spills right into your cup  
The minstrels play and the waitress brings ice  
  
There are pies on a carousel  
Have a slice  
But watch out  
She aint no good for you  
  
Hes gonna spin like the tractor pull  
Shell sit back when he tells his tale  
Hes gonna yell when he drinks his beer  
Shell sit back and drink ginger ale  
  
But when you speak to her  
Her eyes light up  
The music spills right into your cup  
Its so abrupt and its so concise  
  
There are pies on a carousel  
Have a slice  
But watch out  
She aint no good for you  
  
I say watch out  
She aint no good for you  
Shed like to put you in her zoo  
Right between the canaries and the cockatoos  
  
Shell pull out your feathers  
For her brand new hat  
And when shes done that  
Shell feed you to her cat  
  
So watch out  
She aint no good for you  
Watch out  
She aint no good for you  
  
Watch out  
She aint no good for you
