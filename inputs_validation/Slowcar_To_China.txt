Shell take a slowcar to China  
Shell pay the rent for the use of you  
Shell take a slowcar to China  
Shell pay the rent for the use of you tonight  
  
We are not afraid to love but no new ideas  
You almost get used to such things you know  
The mechanics on the phone again we break down  
The others youd remember if I could spare some time  
  
In love with this elegant bitch  
And here am I just a shy young fool  
In love with this elegant bitch  
She only sparkles at times for you tonight  
  
She forgets that we know  
She forgets who we are  
  
I suppose the things I overheard were quite by chance  
The only story I ever knew or cared for  
Best left unheard I suppose dont you  
You look for somewhere to start to look  
  
Well take a slowcar to China  
Everything that you need is here  
Well take a slowcar to China  
Everything that you need is here tonight  
  
I forgot not to call  
And now were out of love  
  
Shell take a slowcar to China  
A little green worm inside my head  
Shell take a slowcar to China  
A little green worm inside my head tonight  
  
Theres nothing much to keep us alive but Dance  
All that she can say is goodbye All things change I suppose  
Well sing without voice without heart and leave no address  
I well never ever see you again I know  
  
Dont take a slowcar to China  
She needed nothing and no one so  
Dont take a slowcar to China  
She needed nothing and no one here tonight  
  
You will pay like before  
Always one step behind  
You will pay Mr Jones  
Always one step away  
  
Theres no one here to leave you behind but me
