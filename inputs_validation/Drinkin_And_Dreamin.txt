Everybodys looking for someway in  
Im looking for someway out  
Ive been wasting my time standing in line  
If this is what its all about  
  
All Ive got is a job that I dont like  
And a woman that dont understand  
So tonight in the bar Ill get in my car  
And take off for the promise land  
  
Chorus  
Drinkin and dreamin knowing damn well I cant go  
Ill never see Texas LA or ol Mexico  
But here at this table Im able to leave it behind  
Drink till Im dreaming a thousand miles out of my mind  
  
This suit and this tie is just a disguise  
This aint really me  
Some people were born to be tied down  
Some people were born to be free  
  
When I look down the road she dont know  
How it gets under my skin  
Shes got my body but my heart and soul  
Are out there riding the wind  
  
Chorus x2
