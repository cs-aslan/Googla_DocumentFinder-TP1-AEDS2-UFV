One two three four  
  
Never been anywhere south of the Delaware  
Never been through Kalamazoo  
Never been to Timbuktu  
  
Livin is fantasy travelin mentally  
Makin up tunes in hotel rooms  
Bout places Ive never been to  
  
Though Ive never crooned under a Kentucky moon  
  
I had my dream Kentucky moon  
But its only moon dreams  
From songs films and TV  
  
But I can visualize what Ive never seen  
But I had my dream Kentucky moon  
  
Route sixty six to me is still a mystery  
And Ohio too  
Went Chicago blue down to St Louis blues  
  
Never been anywhere south of the Delaware  
Never been through Kalamazoo  
Never been to Timbuktu  
  
But I can visualize what Ive never seen  
So I sit and dream Kentucky moon  
  
As I sit by a stream in the moon  
But its just imagery  
From songs films and TV  
  
But I can visualize what Ive never seen  
So I sit and dream Kentucky moon
