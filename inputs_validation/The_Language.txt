I dont know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring  
Bank account statements just look like Im ready for early retirement  
Fuck any nigga thats talkin that shit just to get a reaction  
Fuck going platinum I looked at my wrist and its already platinum  
I am the kid with the motor mouth  
I am the one that you should worry about  
I dont know who youre referring to who is this nigga you heard about  
Someone just talking that bullshit someone just gave you the runaround  
Niggas downplaying the money but thats what you do when the money down  
I dont waste time putting money down  
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash  
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first

I cant even listen you whylin Id much rather sit here in silence  
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians I do  
People are funny you dont even know about the shit that I been through  
I just want some head in a comfortable bed it could all be so simple  
Talking that shit with your back to me just know it always get back to me  
Come get your girl she been here for three days and she way too attached to
me  
Hate when they get too attached to me  
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road  
Get what I can out the country and then I just get on the jet and go back to
the cold  
Cant even drive with the top off  
Been workin so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
