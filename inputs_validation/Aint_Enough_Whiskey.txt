Verse 1  
They talk about money talk about jobs  
Talk about religion and playing the odds  
Talk about freedom talk about faith  
They talking bout taking my guns away  
Monkeys in suits writing laws and rules  
They just bicker and fight  
But I aint gotta listen to them goddamn fools cause I know whats right

Aint enough whiskey women and wine  
Aint enough money stitches and time  
Moonshine honey a little white line  
Aint enough change to change my mind  
Rock on

They talking bout sending my daughter to war

But I aint gotta listen to them goddamn fools cause I know whats right  
  
Chorus  
Aint enough whiskey women and wine  
Aint enough money stitches and time

Aint enough money stitches and time  
Moonshine honey a little white line
