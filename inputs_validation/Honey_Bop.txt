Well once they had a dance they called the bunnyhop  
Now the cats are in a trance all they wanna do is bop  
So bop honey bop well bop ahoney bop  
Oh bop honey bop well dont stop ahoney bop  
When the band begins to rock and its rockin to your blues  
If you think you blow your top  
Well put on your rockin shoes  
And bop honey bop well bop ahoney bop  
Lets bop honey bop dont stop ahoney bop  
  
When the night is up and gone but you still wanna go  
Though you see light of dawn baby tell the band to blow  
And bop honey bop well bop ahoney bop  
Well bop honey bop dont stop ahoney bop  
Well the waltz is for the square and the rhumba is too old  
Baby were just rockin let it satisfy your soul  
So bop honey bop well bop ahoney bop  
Oh bop honey bop well dont stop ahoney bop  
  
Well now youve heard the dance they call the bunnyhop  
But the cats are in a trance all they wanna do is bop  
So bop honey bop well bop ahoney bop  
Well bop honey bop well dont stop abopbopbop
