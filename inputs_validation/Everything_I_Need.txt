Moving up and down and from side to side  
With so many things to do  
I want to go again I want another ride  
This time should see it through  
  
We never realized as the years rolled by  
No we never really had a clue  
But we knew one day wed come alive  
And in the end theres me and you  
  
My babe she gives me everything  
She gives me everything I need  
  
When the winter comes and the cold sets in  
As this citys prone to do  
They forecast heavy seas and gale force winds  
Thats really nothing new  
  
When Im falling down  
Deeper than the underground  
My thoughts race back to you  
Again and again  
  
My babe she gives me everything  
She gives me everything I need  
  
And if you think us fools  
And you criticize  
Then my friend the jokes on you  
  
My babe she gives me everything  
She gives me everything I need
