We got no razor blades we got no victory gin  
I got no tiny alcove to hide myself in  
To say things werent good would not be an untruth  
But I just met a girl from the antisex youth  
We get up in the morning for physical jerks  
We might pass in the hall as were going to work  
I have found us a place where theres no telescreen  
And theres no hidden mikes and its not too unclean  
While the high remain high  
and the middle change places  
The low dont want to know they tell all with their faces  
She might sit afront of me for the two minutes hate  
I might see her again if its not already too late  
So they will take the book away from me  
So let them catch me talking in my sleep  
I guess I never really understood the law  
So Winston Smith takes it on the jaw  
So lets do what we want it makes no difference now  
When the thought police find us were dead anyhow  
Kick us out of the party and bust us to parole  
Then theyll stuff us both into a memory hole  
So let them haul me off to 101  
Public confessions of everything weve done  
Of everything I heard and everything I saw  
When Winston Smith takes it on the jaw
