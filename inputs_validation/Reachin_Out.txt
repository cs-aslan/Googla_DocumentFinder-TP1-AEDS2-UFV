I  
What must I do to make you understand  
You mean everything to me  
Dont have the strength to say  
Give this heart of mine a chance  
And maybe then you will see  
  
Refrain 1  
And Ill do anything do anything that you tell me  
And Ill be there Ill be there if you need me  
  
Chorus 1  
Reachin out to you  
Do you feel it too  
Loving you is all I wanna do  
Im completely sure  
Ive never felt this way before  
When I smile you know that there is something more  
  
Ii  
What must I do so I can make you see  
The light that shines in my eyes  
You brighten up my day  
You even help me find my way  
I wish youre always by my side  
  
Refrain 2  
And I cant stop dont know how to stop thinkin of you  
And Ill do anything do anything to be near near you  
  
Chorus 2  
Reachin out to you  
Do you feel it too  
Loving you is all I wanna do  
Im completely sure  
Ive never felt this way before  
Deep inside you know that there is something more  
  
Repeat chorus 2  
  
Deep inside you know that there is something more
