Honey why you calling me so late  
Its kinda hard to talk right now  
Honey why are you crying Is everything okay  
I gotta whisper cause I cant be too loud  
  
Well my girls in the next room  
Sometimes I wish she was you  
I guess we never really moved on  
Its really good to hear your voice say my name  
It sounds so sweet  
Coming from the lips of an angel  
Hearing those words it makes me weak  
  
And I never wanna say goodbye  
But girl you make it hard to be faithful  
With the lips of an angel  
  
Its funny that youre calling me tonight  
And yes Ive dreamt of you too  
And does he know youre talking to me  
Will it start a fight  
No I dont think she has a clue  
  
Well my girls in the next room  
Sometimes I wish she was you  
I guess we never really moved on  
Its really good to hear your voice say my name  
It sounds so sweet  
Coming from the lips of an angel  
Hearing those words it makes me weak  
  
And I never wanna say goodbye  
But girl you make it hard to be faithful  
With the lips of an angel  
  
Its really good to hear your voice say my name  
It sounds so sweet  
Coming from the lips of an angel  
Hearing those words it makes me weak  
  
And I never wanna say goodbye  
But girl you make it hard to be faithful  
With the lips of an angel  
  
And I never wanna say goodbye  
But girl you make it hard to be faithful  
With the lips of an angel  
  
Honey why you calling me so late
