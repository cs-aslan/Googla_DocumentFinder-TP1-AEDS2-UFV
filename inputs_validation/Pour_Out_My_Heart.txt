Here I am once again  
I pour out my heart  
For I know that you hear  
Every cry  
You are listening  
No matter what state my heart is in  
  
You are faithful to answer  
With words that are true  
And a hope that is real  
As I feel your touch  
You bring a freedom  
To all thats within  
In the safety of this place  
Im longing to  
  
Pour out my heart  
To say that I love you  
Pour out my heart  
To say that I need you  
Pour out my heart  
To say that Im thankful  
Pour out my heart  
To say that youre wonderful
