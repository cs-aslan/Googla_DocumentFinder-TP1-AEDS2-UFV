Turn away from the pain you dont want  
Turning down to avoid them when they call  
Strange words I heard a long long time ago  
I wish I could go back to a summer time  
I knew more than twenty years ago  
Lay between the sheets we lie underneath the maple tree  
Now I cant smile  
Lying down in the grass with the wind around us as we smile and talk  
Listen to your Grandma sing those country songs  
Shed tell us how the maple turns to fire every four years  
Wed lay in the grass all summer just to watch the autumn come around  
I cant smile  
Now I cant smile  
I live alone and youre so far away  
I call you every year just around the holiday  
I still see you in the night lying above me in the grass  
I cant smile  
Turn away from the pain you dont want  
Turning down to avoid them when they call  
I cant believe this letter that says you died  
I think Im gonna go back to the house in North Carolina and lay in the
backyard  
Get drunk and let the leaves just bury me  
Bury me  
I cant smile  
Now I cant smile  
I dont know whats happening to me  
I dont know whats happening to me  
I cant smile
