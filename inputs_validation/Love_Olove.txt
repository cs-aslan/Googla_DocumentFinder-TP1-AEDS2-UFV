Love olove olove olove  
Say love olove olove olove  
I had a love so pure so strong  
I keep wondering just where my love went wrong  
My love went wrong  
  
I say why oh why wont love free me  
Why o why wont love love free me  
Oh untie my hands unchain my feet  
And set my poos ol body free  
  
I Why must love keep me a slave oh  
Why why must love keep me a slave  
I cant help myself I aint got no friends  
It will take me take me straight to my grave  
Love will take me straight to my grave
