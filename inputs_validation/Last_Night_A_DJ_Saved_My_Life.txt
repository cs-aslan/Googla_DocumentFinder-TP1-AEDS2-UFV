Last night a DJ  
Saved my life  
Last night a DJ  
Saved my life  
Cause I was sittin there  
Bored to death  
And in just one breath  
He said  
You gotta get up  
You gotta get on  
You gotta get down girl  
You know you  
Drive me crazy baby  
Youve got me  
Turning to another man  
Called you on the phone  
No ones home  
Baby why ya  
Leave me all alone  
And if it wasnt for the music  
I dont know what Id do  
Last night a DJ  
Saved my life  
Last night a DJ  
Saved my life  
From a broken heart  
Last night a DJ  
Saved my life  
Last night a DJ  
Saved my life with a song  
  
You know  
I hopped into my car  
Didnt get very far no  
Because I had you  
On my mind  
Why be so unkind  
Youve got  
Your women all around  
All around this town boy  
But I was trapped  
In love with you  
And I didnt know  
What to do  
But when I turned  
On my radio  
I found out all  
I needed to know  
Check it out  
  
Last night a DJ  
Saved me life  
Last night a DJ  
Saved me life  
From a broken heart  
Last night a DJ  
Saved me life  
Last night a DJ  
Saved my life with a song  
  
Last night a DJ  
Saved me life  
Last night a DJ  
Saved me life  
From a broken heart  
Last night a DJ  
Saved me life

Saved me life with a song  
  
Hey listen up to your local DJ  
You better hear  
What hes got to say  
Theres not a problem  
That I cant fix  
Cause I can do it  
In the mix  
And if your man  
Gives you trouble  
Just you move out  
On the double  
And you dont let it  
Trouble your brain  
Cause away goes troubles  
Down the drain  
I said away goes troubles  
Down the drain  
  
Last night a DJ  
Saved me life  
Theres not a problem  
That I cant fix  
Cause I can do it  
In the mix  
Theres not a problem  
That I cant fix  
Cause I can do it  
In the mix
