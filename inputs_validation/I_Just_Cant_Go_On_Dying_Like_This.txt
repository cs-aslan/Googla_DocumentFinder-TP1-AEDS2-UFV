Im driving in my car alone  
You called me on the telephone  
How many times will it take till Im convinced  
That youre using me Im just a usedtobe  
Its a lie I know its a lie  
But I just cant go on dying like this  
  
Can I see you tonight  
Baby Ill act just like you want me to  
Or is that just exactly what Im not supposed to do  
  
Ill just stop in here have a glass of beer  
Im just a fool I guess  
But I just cant go on dying like this  
  
Here I am again its four AM  
I think Ill play that song again  
The one called Im So Lonesome I Could Cry  
And Ill wonder where you are tonight  
I dont know I just dont know  
But I just cant go on dying like this  
  
Can I see you tonight  
Baby Ill act just like you want me to  
Or is that just exactly what Im not supposed to do  
  
Ill just stop in here have a glass of beer  
Im just a fool I guess  
But I just cant go on dying like this  
  
Lord knows I just cant go on dying like this
