Stop cryin  
Aint feeling sorry for you  
Why dont you fade away  
Got no time  
No time for what I gotta do  
And get a message through  
Kiss my ass  
Your bitchins a bore  
Dont want to hear it no more  
So stop cryin  
Aint feelin nothing for you  
Dont like it theres the door  
  
Sorry if Im not as nice as you could be  
Why dont you take the time to see  
That the world does not revolve around only you  
And we got better things to do  
  
Youre starvin  
Just startin to talk  
I think you know it all  
Im sick  
I eat this shit everyday  
Why dont we give you a call  
Authoritative  
And a reason to live  
You answer questions for me  
Opinionated  
With a brain like a sieve  
Why dont you let it be  
  
Come back here drink our beer  
Bend my ear with no idea  
Wrong or right  
A true philosopher  
Defining our performance  
  
Why dont you get yourself a life  
Just get the fuck out  
  
We dont care what they say  
Well be there tomorrow like were here today  
And all the criticism in the world  
Wont change a note we play  
  
Mix it up throw it down  
We came to play not to mess around  
We dont care what they say  
Well be there tomorrow like were here today  
Dont do it for the money  
Do it for the thrill  
True to life is what you get  
Were livin for the kill  
  
Drunken  
Wisdom
