Woke up this morning  
With this feeling inside me that I cant explain  
Like a weight that Ive carried  
Been carried away away  
  
But I know something is coming  
I dont know what it is  
But I know its amazing can save me  
My time is coming  
And Ill find my way out of this longest drought  
  
Chorus  
It feels like today I know it feels like today  
Im sure its the one thing thats missin  
The one thing Im wishin  
Lifes sacred blessin in me  
It feels like today I know  
Feels like today  
  
You treat life like a picture  
But its not a moment thats frozen in time  
Its not gonna wait  
Til you make up your mind at all  
  
So while this storm is breakin  
While theres light at the end of the tunnel  
Keep running towards it  
Releasing the pressure thats my heartache  
Soon this dam will break  
  
Chorus  
  
Feels like feels like your life changes  
Feels like feels like your life changes  
  
Its the one thing thats missin  
The one thing youre wishin  
Lifes sacred blessin  
It feels like today I know  
  
Feels like feels like your life changes  
Feels like feels like your life changes
