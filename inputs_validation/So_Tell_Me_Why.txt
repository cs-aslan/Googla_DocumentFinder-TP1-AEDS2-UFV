Id like to put to rest the rumours  
Id like to put to rest the lies  
Id like to throw away the past  
And show you how I feel inside  
  
Ill be your taxi and your driver  
Ill be your road if you need  
Id like to push and push and push  
Just to make you pleased  
  
But your river of emotion for me  
flows like a dried up stream  
  
Chorus  
So tell me why  
Your satisfactions like a heart of stone  
So tell me why  
Your love reaction chills me to the bone  
  
You make my blood boil hot  
And my heart beat like a drum  
Id like to do to you girl  
Things that aint never been done  
  
From the rain Ill be your shelter  
From the cold Ill be your heat  
Ill push and push and push  
just to make you pleased  
  
Chorus  
  
So tell me your reason  
for tearing me up inside  
Girl you gotta tell me why  
  
But your river of emotion for me  
flows like a dried up stream  
  
Chorus
