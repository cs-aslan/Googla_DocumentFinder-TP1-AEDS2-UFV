Over Bridges of Sighs  
To rest my eyes in shades of green  
  
Under Dreaming Spires  
To Itchycoo Park thats where Ive been  
  
What did you do there  I got high  
What did you feel there  Well I cried  
But why the tears there  Ill tell you why  yyyyy  
Its all too beautiful Its all too beautiful  
Its all too beautiful Its all too beautiful  
  
I feel inclined to blow my mind  
Get hung up feed the ducks with a bun  
They all come out to groove about  
Be nice and have fun in the sun  
Ill tell you what Ill do  What will you do  
  
Id like to go there now with you  
You can miss out school  Wont that be cool  
Why go to learn the words of fools  
  
What will we do there  Well get high  
What will we touch there  Well touch the sky  
But why the tears there Ill tell you why  
Its all too beautiful Its all too beautiful  
Its all too beautiful Its all too beautiful  
  
I feel inclined to blow my mind  
Get hung up feed the ducks with a bun  
They all come out to groove about  
Be nice and have fun in the sun  
Its all too beautiful Its all too beautiful  
Its all too beautiful Its all too beautiful
