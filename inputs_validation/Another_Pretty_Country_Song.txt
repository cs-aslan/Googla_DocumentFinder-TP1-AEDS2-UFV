I bought this rhinestone suit in California  
These boots came all the way from Mexico  
This Cadillac aint nothin son you ought to see the Greyhound  
I bought to take my band from show to show  
Seen my face a thousand times on TV and heard me on your local radio  
And in your eyes I see the admiration there for me  
But son theres something that you ought to know  
  
Well Ive got to take a drink to keep from shakin  
Motel rooms aint nothing like a home  
Money cant make love grow any stronger when you leave your woman home alone  
She cant raise the children with no daddy  
She cant love a man thats always gone  
It takes a whole lot more than pride to keep your feelings locked inside  
While you sing another pretty country song  
Play it Pete Drake  
 steel   
Ive seen your face a thousand times on TV Ive heard you on my local radio  
  
Its true I took some pills to stay awake son  
And this diamond ring I wear is just for show  
Ive got a little cabin in the country  
When Im not on the road thats where I go  
Try and put my feelings down on paper  
Right or wrong the show has to go on  
I can cry down deep inside and keep on smilin  
While I sing another pretty country song  
But Ive got to take a drink to keep from shakin
