Just a castaway an island lost at sea oh  
Another lonely day with no one here but me oh  
More loneliness than any man could bear  
Rescue me before I fall into despair oh

A year has passed since I wrote my note  
But I should have known this right from the start  
Only hope can keep me together  
Love can mend your life but  
Love can break your heart

Seems Im not alone at being alone  
Hundred billion castaways looking for a home
