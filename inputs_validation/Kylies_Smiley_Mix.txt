Im seeing in your way  
But I dont believe its true  
That Im not the one to make you happy  
It would be so wrong  
For us to break in two  
But do what you gotta do  
  
I hope that you find someone  
Who can love you like I do  
Ill be strong inside  
But ill still be loving you  
  
Its no secret x4  
  
When I first meet you  
How you changed my life that day  
But with each tomorrow  
You just seem to drift away  
  
Then I discovered  
That you were cheating  
You were cheating on me  
But I was the last to know  
Ooh ooh  
  
Our love was a life  
And its no secret  
Its no secret  
How you hurt me inside  
And its no secret  
Because you told everybody  
  
Rain falling down  
Another minute passes by  
Ill wait for you  
But this time I wont cry  
Where are you now  
Are you with another love  
Its not the first time  
You stood me up and let me down  
I I Im wondering why  
  
I still love you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
I still want you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
  
Did you believe Id let you down  
Your jealous heart  
Gave you the runaround  
You couldnt see that  
I would always be a friend  
If you could look inside your heart  
And understand whats tearing you apart  
You gotta trust someone  
Dont let hate get in the way  
  
Just turn it into love  
Turn it into love  
And open up your heart  
And youll never feel ashamed  
If you turn it turn it  
Turn it into love  
  
In my imagination  
There is no complication  
I dream about you all the time  
In my mind of celebration  
The sweetest of sensation  
Thinking you could be mine  
In my imagination  
There is no hesitation  
We walk together hand in hand  
Im dreaming  
  
You fell in love with me  
Like Im in love with you  
But dreamings all I do  
If only theyd come true  
  
I should be so lucky  
Lucky lucky lucky  
I should be so lucky in love  
I should be so lucky  
Lucky lucky lucky  
I should be so lucky in love  
  
You keep on asking me  
Why cant we be together  
I keep saying  
Wont you wait a while  
Whats all the hurry  
I thought we had forever  
I just need time  
Till I can make up my mind  
  
Im not asking for  
A love to last forever  
I dont expect  
To get a guarantee  
Its just that I believe  
Lovers should stick together  
Im only saying  
Wont you wait for me  
  
Ive got to be  
Got to be certain  
Ive got to be so sure  
Ive had my share  
Of hearts broken  
And I dont wanna take that anymore  
  
All aboard
