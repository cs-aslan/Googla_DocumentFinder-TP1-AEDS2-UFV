Ive felt you coming girl as you drew near  
I knew youd find me cause I longed you here  
Are you my destiny Is this how youll appear  
Wrapped in a coat with tears in your eyes  
Well take that coat babe and throw it on the floor  
Are you the one Ive been waiting for  
  
As youve been moving surely toward me  
My soul has comforted and assured me  
That in time my heart it will reward me  
And that all will be revealed  
So Ive sat and Ive watched an iceage thaw  
Are you the one Ive been waiting for  
  
Out of sorrow entire worlds have been built  
Out of longing great wonders have been willed  
Theyre only little tears darling let them spill  
And lay your head upon my shoulder  
Outside my window the world has gone to war  
Are you the one Ive been waiting for  
  
O we will know Wont we  
The stars will explode in the sky  
But they dont Do they  
Stars have their moment and then they die  
  
Theres a man who spoke wonders though Ive never met him  
He said He who seeks finds and who knocks will be let in  
I think of you in motion and just how close you are getting  
And how every little thing anticipates you  
All down my veins my heartstrings call  
Are you the one Ive been waiting for
