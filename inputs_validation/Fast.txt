I cant believe whats happening to me  
My heart leaps when I hear your name  
Youre all I think about whenever Im alone  
I think Im falling  
Im falling  
I cant believe whats happening to me  
Cant believe the joy seeing you can bring  
I never thought Id know what it means to be in love  
But Im falling  
Im falling  
CHORUS  
Falling fast oh so fast  
Im falling fast for you  
Oh so fast  
Hold me fast and make my dreams come true  
Hear my heart beat faster  
Now happy ever after  
I think Ive found true love in you at last  
And love Im falling fast  
Oh so fast  
I cant believe whats happening to me  
Things are brighter than theyve ever been  
Youve brought the light into my life  
In the wink of an eye  
Iam falling  
Im falling  
Repeat Chorus twice
