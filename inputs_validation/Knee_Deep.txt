Gonna put the world away for a minute  
Pretend I dont live in it  
Sunshine gonna wash my blues away  
Had sweet love but I lost it  
She got too close so I fought it  
Now Im lost in the world tryin to find me a better way  
  
Wishin I was  
Knee deep in the water somewhere  
Got the blue sky breeze and it dont seem fair  
The only worry in the world  
Is the tide gonna reach my chair  
Sunrise theres a fire in the sky  
Never been so happy  
Never felt so high  
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  
  
Wrote a note said Be back in a minute  
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it  
Dont think anybodys gonna miss me anyway  
Mind on a permanent vacation  
The ocean is my only medication  
Wishin my condition aint ever gonna go away  
  
Cause now Im knee deep in the water somewhere  
Got the blue sky breeze blowin wind through my hair  
Only worry in the world  
Is the tide gonna reach my chair  
Sunrise theres a fire in the sky  
Never been so happy  
Never felt so high  
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  
  
This champagne shore watchin over me  
Its a sweet sweet life livin by the salty sea  
One day you can be as lost as me  
Change your geography and maybe you might be  
  
Knee deep in the water somewhere  
Got the blue sky breeze blowin wind through my hair  
Only worry in the world  
Is the tide gonna reach my chair  
Sunrise theres a fire in the sky  
Never been so happy  
Never felt so high  
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  
  
Come on in  
The waters nice  
Find yourself a little slice  
Grab a backpack  
Otherwise youll never know until you try  
When you lose yourself  
You find a key to paradise
