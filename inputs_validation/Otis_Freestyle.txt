Verse 1 justin bieber  
Damn damn jb where the hell you been  
Yeah I got a new necklace diamonds  
2 big face rollies no I aint lyin  
Making momma so proud that she cryin  
Yeah you say Im crazy guess that makes two  
But I never knew that dreams really came true  
Started playing drums when I was only 2  
Now we kick it in japan kungfu  
So Im heading for the gold Im sweating  
I swear otis redding will be ohso ready  
I already got aheady of the game Im with kenny  
And we steady getting many I mean money  
Riding in an allblack benz with the all black rims  
And we looking at some 10s through our allblack lenses  
  
Justin bieber  
Wait Im not done  
  
Verse 2 justin bieber  
I thanked jesus at the awards Im never going to hell  
Call me zack morris Im saving you by the bell  
My girl says Im perfect she just loves them perfect persons  
Perfectly personally I think she is perfectly perfect  
I get it done abundantly she wants to get up under me  
I swear I got honey bees cause baby Im a money tree  
So be my little honey be my littlebitty bunny  
I got honeys all up on me baby I just get it doney  
Possibly youre probably thinking this type of swag is impossible  
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically  
Try to feel me spiritually get out your mind literally  
Theres a bigger me inside this little me  
Screaming out I should make history  
I am like a mystery hated by jealousy cause they envy me  
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me  
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory  
Cant you see the private jets flying over you  
I aint even notice but my focus on my photos  
Might be bogus no they shouldnt be a photoshoot  
Its funny how you wanna take my picture and its like your first time  
Playing with camera claiming that its not mine  
Just calm down you dont gotta hurry  
Dont be nervous you dont gotta worry  
And my fans are like my glasses yeah without them Id be blurry
