I would have waited forever  For you to return into my life  
I would have waited forever  I would have given you everything I had  
I would have waited forever  Theres no question no question at all  
  
So true in the prize would you wait for me  
All because you got burned so you took what you needed  
Some will always turn away say its reason enough  
Its another game of exploration  
Something calls at reverse and it comes to you  
Experience everything as it comes true  
  
So  It will be then  
Change  It will happen  
See  That we feel it  
All  Is completed  
  
Dont you want the world to stop short of giving  
Anytime of night or day the magic things you love  
Everybody hurts when you shout when you walk away  
Talk about it according to you  
  
I would have waited forever  For you to return into my life  
I would have waited forever  To give you everything I had  
I would have waited forever  Theres no question about it at all  
  
So in between the perfect flame of you this love will never let you down  
Just take it as it comes for everything will come around  
  
You put your hand up stop the flow of where youre going to  
Its another game called exploration  
How we imagine everything that we think were going through  
Its another reason to make the break  
Everyone will move with you now to the riverside  
Experience everything but dont let the land slide  
  
I would have waited forever  For you to return into my life  
I would have waited forever  To give you everything I had  
I would have waited forever  No question in my body and soul  
Forever
