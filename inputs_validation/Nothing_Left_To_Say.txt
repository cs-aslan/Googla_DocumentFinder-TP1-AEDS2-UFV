Who knows how long  
Ive been awake now  
The shadows on my wall dont sleep  
They keep calling me  
Beckoning  
Who knows whats right  
The lines keep getting thinner  
My age has never made me wise  
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on  
  
Theres nothing left to say now  
Im giving up giving up hey hey giving up now  
Theres nothing left to say now  
Im giving up giving up hey hey giving up now  
  
Below my soul  
I feel an engine  
Collapsing as it sees the pain  
If I could only shut it out  
Ive come too far  
To see the end now  
Even if my way is wrong  
I keep pushing on and on and on and on  
  
Theres nothing left to say now  
Im giving up giving up hey hey giving up now  
Theres nothing left to say now  
Im giving up giving up hey hey giving up now  
  
I keep falling I keep falling down  
If you could only save me  
Im drowning in the waters of my soul  
  
Theres nothing left to say now  
Im giving up giving up hey hey giving up now  
Theres nothing left to say now  
Im giving up giving up hey hey giving up now
