April skies are in your eyes  
But darling dont be blue  
  
Dont cry  
Oh honey please  
Dont be that way  
  
Clouds in the sky  
Should never make you feel that way  
  
The rain  
Will bring the violets of May  
Tears are in vain so honey please dont be that way  
  
As long as we  
See it through  
Youll have me  
Ill have you  
  
Sweetheart  
Tomorrow is another day  
Dont break my heart  
Oh honey please dont be that way  
  
Dont cry  
Oh honey please  
Dont be that way  
  
Clouds in the skies  
Should never make you feel that way  
  
The rain  
Will bring the violets of May  
Tears in vain  
So honey please dont be that way  
  
As long as we  
Will see it through  
Youll have me  
And Ill have you  
  
Sweetheart  
Tomorrow is another day  
Dont break my heart  
Oh honey please dont be that way  
  
Dont cry

Oh honey please dont be that way

Pitterpatter of rain drops  
Tears in vain

So honey please dont be that way

Will see it through  
Oh baby youll have me  
And Ill have you
