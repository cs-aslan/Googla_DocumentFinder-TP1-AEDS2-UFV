Do you remember Hullabaloo  
Upbeat Shindig and Ed Sullivan too  
Do You Remember Rock N Roll radio  
Do You Remember Rock N Roll radio  
  
Do you remember Murray the K  
Alan Freed and high energy  
Its the end the end of the seventies  
Its the end the end of the century  
  
Do you remember lying in bed with your covers  
Pulled up over your head Radio playin so one can see  
We need change we need it fast before rocks just part  
Of the past ause lately it all sound the same to me  
  
Ohoh  
Will you remember Jerry Lee  
John Lennon T Rex and Ol Moulty  
Its the end the end of the 70s  
Its the end the end of the century
