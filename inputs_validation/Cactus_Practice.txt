Maybe he and I  
  
Are like a pair of suns  
That are captured  
  
Maybe he and I are like a pair of suns  
That are captured  
  
Eternally linked into chasing  
Each others spin  
  
Eternally linked into chasing  
Each others spin  
Bound by beliefs  
  
That have become steel cords  
  
Why the disharmony  
Lets resynch my world  
With a harmonic defiance Ill face this  
  
Id like to induct you into  
The drink of the cactus practice  
Cactus  
  
Cactus  
  
Practice  
  
Will you induct me into  
The drink of the cactus practice  
Cactus  
  
Cactus  
  
Practice  
Are you saying Im  
  
Reactive but I can work with a doll face  
  
Every couple has their version of what they call the truth  
Every couple has their version of what they call the truth  
Call all that lies  
  
Beneath both stories  
  
Back to my fire  
  
Embrace what you find  
  
With a harmonic defiance Ill face this  
  
Its time to induct you into  
The drink of the cactus practice  
  
Cactus

Practice  
  
Id like to induct you into  
The drink of the cactus practice  
  
Cactus

Will you induct me into  
The drink of the cactus practice
