Held captive Im a prisoner  
In the back room where the water leaks and Im oh so cold  
Command me on what to do but we both know neither you or I are in control  
  
Theres nothing left for me here  
Im grabbing on to whats left of this hole  
Its all too real this cant be happening  
  
Never again ever again will I say Im OK  
Im scared of the fate that will become mine  
  
No time to talk you know the drill  
  
Under my desk this cant be it  
Im only dreaming Ive got to be dreaming  
But I cant get up No time to talk not this time this is my place  
This is where I arrange  
  
Its so funny how we see things so clear when we have no time left to live  
  
So lay back now and take it in  
I wont say a word I wont say anything  
  
I cant believe how it feels  
To stand here in this room  
And feel like its going to blow  
I think were all going to blow  
  
Ive got to be dreaming  
Weve got to be dreaming  
Please dont wake me up  
This is the end
