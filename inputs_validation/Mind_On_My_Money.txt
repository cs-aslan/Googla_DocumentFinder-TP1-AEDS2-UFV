Chorus  Sean Paul  
I got my mind on my money my money on my mind  
Got my mind on my money and my money on my mind  
I got my mind on my money money on my mind  
Got my mind on my money and my money on my mind  
I got my mind on my money my money on my mind  
Got my mind on my money and my money on my mind  
I got my mind on my money my money on my mind  
Got my mind on my money and my money on my mind  
Verse 1  Sean Paul  
I got my mind on my money my money on my mind  
The thing I got I sell it to get it all the time  
A nickle or a dime a half or a pound  
Long as my bitch ridin Ill put a nigga down  
Im a playa from the jump a hustler from the start  
Something in your chest then open up your heart  
Im bouta bet itlike Memphis 10 they get it get it  
Gotta have it have it take it all man if they let me  
Ima run it put somethin on it instead of bet it  
Its that money dont make no money buddy Im ready  
Can I get it Its win or lose you know the rules  
We rollin we didnt hit it now pay your dues  
JBo  
Now when it comes to gettin that cash flow  
Im all about that paper no credit just straight dough  
And for all who dont know theres money out to be made  
So get it while you can and still its just a phase  
In the eyes of a hustler nigga youd be amazed  
That time waits for no one so God I pray  
Try hard not to fall through life stuck unemployed  
So instead I keep on livin whats given within my void  
Put a end after hours scrapin up all my change  
From quarters to dimes as you see this aint no game  
So pick up on your pimpin get on it and never slip  
cause all on my mind is my money fully gripped fully gripped  
Chorus  
Verse 2  Sean Paul  
Just call me the money maker bread taker  
Nigga Breaker the pocket raper money scraper  
May do me a favor stay the fuck up out my waya  
The rock that I can take it buddy to collect my paper  
That might save ya think of no anger no player hater  
No bumpin heads when it come to gettin this paper  
Im a player runnin wit the hand that was dealt  
Flippin my work ridin the left fully equipped  
aint fuckin wit hoes unless talkin bout bread  
Duckin these streets givin these strangers some head  
Bringin it back makin sho my pockets swole  
Workin the streets now they know they my hoes  
JBo  
I must aint had it I gotta get it  
Nothin to lose shoot me a quarter and watch me flip it  
Shakin these haters down the line they somethin wicked  
You on a roll then pay yo dues then buy a ticket  
Gather your cheddar round this world theres nothin better  
But keep it boomin like a system through any weather  
Stackin my green thats somethin good Im on a mission  
Trappin hard just like I should no penny pinchin  
And for the gold we steady missin and reminisin  
Buy some S aint even hittin so stop yo flippin  
cause when I pull in all my cheese you besta know  
There aint no playin wit my thang when you see my foe  
Act like ya know
