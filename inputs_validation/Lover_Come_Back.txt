Fun may be fun  
But its not when the one  
That you love has gone  
  
I try to sleep  
But the counting of sheep  
Goes on and on  
  
Without your kiss  
I just cannot exist  
From the night til dawn  
  
Lover lover lover  
Come back  
  
You had me where  
I was walking on air  
Never touched the ground  
  
Now I have learned  
Theres a torch to be burned  
Since youre not around  
  
Im gonna place  
An ad in the space  
Under lost and found  
  
Lover lover lover  
Come back  
  
Im like a birdy without its wings  
Like a pupper without its strings  
Im not anything without you  
  
Thinking about you  
Being without you  
Is what it took  
  
Now Im all set  
Gonna go out and get you  
By hook or crook  
  
Whoever said they  
Like crawling in bed  
With a real good book  
  
Ive made my conclusion  
I know what I lack  
Theres no substitution  
So please hurry back  
  
Lover lover lover  
Lover lover come on back  
Come on back lover come back
