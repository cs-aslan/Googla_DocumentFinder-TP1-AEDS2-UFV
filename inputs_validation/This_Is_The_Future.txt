Wake up on your own  
And look around you cause youre not alone  
Release your high hopes and theyll survive  
cause this is the future and you are alive  
  
Dive in and swim away  
From your loneliness and miserable days  
  
And when you wake up on your own  
Look around you cause youre not alone  
Let your hopes go and theyll survive  
cause this is the future and you are alive  
Youre headed home
