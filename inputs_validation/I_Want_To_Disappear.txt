Look at me now  
Got no religion  
Look at me now  
Im so vacant  
  
Look at me now  
I was a virgin  
Look at me now  
Grew up to be a whore  
  
And I want it  
I believe it  
Im a million different things  
And not one you know  
  
Hey and our mommies are lost now  
Hey daddys someone else  
Hey we love the abuse  
Because it makes us feel like we are needed now  
  
But I know  
I want to disappear  
  
I want to die young  
And sell my soul  
Use up all your drugs  
And make me come  
  
Yesterday man  
I was a nihilist and  
Now today Im  
Just too fucking bored  
  
By the time Im old enough  
I wont know anything at all  
  
Hey and our mommies are lost now  
Hey daddys someone else  
Hey we love the abuse  
Because it makes us feel like we are needed now  
  
But I know  
I want to disappear
