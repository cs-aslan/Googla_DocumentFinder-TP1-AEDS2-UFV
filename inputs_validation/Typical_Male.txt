Tell me lawyer what to do  
I think Im falling in love with you  
Defend me from the way I feel  
Wont you give me some advice  
On how to handle my private life  
Im sure we can make a deal  
I confess Im a fool for men with a clever mind  
But your intellect aint no match with this heart of mine  
  
All I want is a little reaction  
Just enough to tip the scales  
Im just using my female attraction  
On a typical male on a typical male  
  
Your sense of justice Ill embrace  
But your defense dont help my case  
Im deep in trouble with the law  
Something about authority  
Seems to bring out the bad in me  
Hey lawyer gotta catch me when I fall  
Oh they say that you match your wits with the best of them  
But I know when Im close youre just like the rest of them  
  
All I want is a little reaction  
Just enough to tip the scales  
Im just using my female attraction  
On a typical male on a typical male  
  
So put your books aside  
Loosen off the suit and tie  
Gotta open up your heart and let me in  
Open up your heart and let me in
