This is the room the start of it all  
No portrait so fine only sheets on the wall  
Ive seen the nights filled with bloodsport and pain  
And the bodies obtained the bodies obtained  
  
Where will it end Where will it end  
Where will it end Where will it end  
  
These are your friends from childhood through youth  
Who goaded you on demanded more proof  
Withdrawal pain is hard it can do you right in  
So distorted and thin distorted and thin  
  
Where will it end Where will it end  
Where will it end Where will it end  
  
This is the car at the edge of the road  
Theres nothing disturbed all the windows are closed  
I guess you were right when we talked in the heat  
Theres no room for the weak no room for the weak  
  
Where will it end Where will it end  
Where will it end Where will it end  
  
This is the room the start of it all  
Through childhood thorugh youth I remember it all  
Oh Ive seen the nights filled with bloodsport and pain  
And the bodies obtained the bodies obtained the bodies obtained  
  
Where will it end Where will it end  
Where will it end Where will it end
