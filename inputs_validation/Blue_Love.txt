Blue love whyd you have to go and make me sad and blue  
Love youre the only one I gave it to and

You never know love until your baby leaves you  
You never know love until your loves turns to

Tony  
I been hanging on such a long long time  
Waiting for the return of your smiling face  
Chaka  
And the test and the time that changed every mind cant you see  
That my world is an unhappy place  
Tony  
Oh this love in my heart is tearing me apart  
Chaka  
Need ya here wit me how happy we could be  
Tony  
Together  
Chaka

They say you never know love until somebody leaves you  
You never know love until your baby leaves you  
You never know love until your loves turns to blue
