Your bad self  
Verse 1  
All right stop spread yourself around  
Get loose girl lets break it down  
Get down straight to the floor  
Get excited and beg for more  
As I go on flow on with a smile  
Pay attention to my style  
Dirty but hot ya know what I mean  
Get loose girl like a sex fiend lets do it  
cause you know what I want  
Me and you babe go one on one  
Get freaky and I do the same  
Get hot and I ride like a sex machine  
Chorus  
Ice cool and youre colder than ever I like it  
Ice cool and youre colder than ever  
Verse 2  
Ice cold cooler than ever  
Never say never cause Im so damn clever  
Lickin your lips Im ridin your hips  
Vip posse and were pimps  
Be on the lookout in your vicinity  
Im robbin virgins of their virginity  
Like robin hood gave to the poor  
I rock kashla and now she wants more  
She calls everday its gettin kinda silly  
But she rides my saddle like bronco billy  
In a rodeo somewhere out west  
She screams out vanilla ice youre the best  
Echoing out can you hear  
She screams out everywhere  
Just a pimp and you know  
Snatchin women so yo  
You can beg plead and tell me you love me  
But theres no way id put a girl above me  
Unless its sex and you want to ride  
Jump on my saddle baby and get live  
Chorus  
Verse 3  
Move your body all around  
This is the dope jam so get down  
Now that you like what Im sayin admit it  
This is the jam and vanilla just did it  
I made you work til your butt got sore  
In other words Im about to get raw  
On stage its a vip doin dances from a to zpumpin it pushin it stick
it hard  
I freaked your girl in the back of your car  
I wore a jimmy that I slapped on  
Popped a rubber duckie so bought me a trojan  
Get ready hyped into the groove  
As I practiced to make your body move  
Youre fienin for a meanin oh yes Im comin  
Vanilla ice is here so you suckers start runnin  
This is the jam I know youre gonna like  
Deshay he cuts like a knife  
He wont smirk and he wont smile  
Deshay get funky for a while  
Yo its time for me to pump pump  
Pump up the volume  
Chorus
