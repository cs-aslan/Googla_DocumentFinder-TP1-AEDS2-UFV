You know my girl just called me up  
And she woke me from my sleep  
You should have heard the things she said  
You know she hurt my feelings deep  
Im gonna buy me a dog A dog a dog Why  
Cause I need a friend now Say you need all the friends you can get  
Im gonna buy me a dog  
My girl my girl dont love me no how  
  
She used to bring me my newspaper  
Cause she knew where it was at  
She used to keep me so contented  
But I can teach a dog to do that  
Im gonna buy me a dog  
Cause I need a friend now  
Im gonna buy me a dog  
My girl my girl dont love me no how
