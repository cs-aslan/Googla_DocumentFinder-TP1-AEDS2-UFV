Moonlight took me by surprise  
light coming from your eyes  
Are you with me  
Am I here with you  
Are we in paradise  
Tell me Im not dreamin  
  
I know Ive been here before  
You go then you come back for more  
Its a mystery how you disappear  
Like a shadow in the night  
Tell me Im not dreamin  
  
Chorus  
Are you too good to be true  
Tell me Im not dreamin  
Are you too good to be true  
Tell me Im not dreamin  
  
Midnight images of you  
You slipped slipped into my room  
Could be magic could be fantasy  
Could it be that were in love  
Tell me Im not dreamin  
  
Your voice whispers in the dark  
You talk talking to my heart  
Are you with me  
Am I here with you  
Are we in paradise  
Tell me Im not dreamin  
  
Chorus  
  
When the morning comes  
Wake me with your love  
Let me know that Im not dreamin  
Tell me this is real  
Show me how you feel  
Say its what we both believe in  
  
Chorus
