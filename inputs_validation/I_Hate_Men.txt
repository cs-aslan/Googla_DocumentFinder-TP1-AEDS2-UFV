I hate men  
I cant abide em even now and then  
  
Than ever marry one of them Id rest a maiden rather  
For husbands are a boring lot and only give you bother  
Of course Im awfully glad that mother deemed to marry father  
But I hate men  
  
Of all the types Ive ever met within our democracy  
I hate the most the athlete with his manner bold and brassy  
He may have hair upon his chest but sister so has Lassie  
Oh I hate men  
  
I hate men  
They should be kept like piggies in a pen  
  
Dont wed a travling salesman though a tempting Tom he may be  
For on your wedding night he may be off to far Araby  
While hes away in Mandalay it is thee who have the baby  
Oh I hate men  
  
If thou shouldst wed a businessman be wary oh be wary  
Hell tell you hes detained in town on business necessary  
His business is the business with his pretty secretary  
Oh I hate men  
  
I hate men  
Though roosters they I will not play the hen  
  
If you espouse an older man through girlish optimism  
Hell always stay at home at night and make no criticism  
Though you may call it love the doctors call it rheumatism  
Oh I hate men  
  
From all Ive read alone in bed from A to Z about them  
Since love is blind then from the mind all womankind should rout them  
But ladies you must answer too what would we do without them  
Still I hate men
