This is my five string serenade  
Beneath the water of play  
And while Im playing for yo  
It could writing thats you  
  
This is my five string serenade  
Beneath the water of play  
And while Im playing for you  
It could writing thats you  
  
And on my easel I drew  
While I was thinking of you  
And on the roof of my head  
And came my five string serenade  
  
This is my five string serenade  
Beneath the water of play  
And while Im playing for you  
It might writing thats you  
  
And on my easel I drew  
While I was thinking of you  
And on the roof of my head  
And came my five string serenade  
  
This is my five string serenade  
Beneath the water of play  
And though Im playing for you  
It could writing thats you  
  
This is my five string serenade
