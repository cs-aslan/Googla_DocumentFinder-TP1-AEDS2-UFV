We must have played  
For more than ten years  
We must have thought  
That were immortal  
Shame shame on us  
Ah little hussy  
What did you think I was  
I look at us  
We have grown older  
A lot too much  
For me to take  
I thought  
We were immortal  
Im so sorry  
I couldnt keep my promise  
To carry on your flag for you  
Some superherobeing  
  
It seems to me  
That we are changing  
There aint no limit to imagination  
The world just turns around  
Without a care  
Sometimes I feel like crying  
And every time  
I need to touch you  
How can I ever  
Break the distance  
Thats why my love  
Became so strong and pure  
Thats why I keep on  
Trying forever  
To carry on your flag for you  
Some superherobeing  
For you  
Some superherobeing  
Waiting  
Under the light of the moon  
For you  
Im coming soon
