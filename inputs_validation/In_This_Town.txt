I could be anywhere else but here  
But the rain wont let me go  
Theres a photograph  
Hanging on my wall  
Of a place Ive never been to  
  
Ill never make the grade  
Feels like Sunday everyday  
And I cant stop the rain  
Feels like Sunday everyday  
What do the papers say  
Feels like Sunday everyday  
Get up and go now  
  
Chorus  
In this town somethings gotta change  
In this town somethings gotta change  
  
Im looking at the world  
Looking for a scene  
Waiting for a day  
Filling in time like Im digging  
My own grave  
  
Ill never make the grade  
Feels like Sunday everyday  
And I cant stop the rain  
Feels like Sunday everyday  
What do the papers say  
Feels like Sunday everyday  
Get up and go now  
  
Chorus
