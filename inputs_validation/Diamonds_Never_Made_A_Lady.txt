Oh my heart is crying in the night for you  
Oh my God oh dont you feel like a fool  
Youre fooling yourself with a millionaire  
You think its love but he dont care  
And one of these days  
Youre gonna be surprised  
  
Diamonds never made a lady lover or a friend  
I know it  
Diamonds never made a lady all your dreams will end  
I know it  
  
Your Californian nights  
Warm body held you tight  
Was just a dream  
But all the diamond lights  
Cant give you peaceful lives or sweet dreams  
  
Oh my God you really think you have it made  
Your heart is won with first class expenses paid  
You drink campaign eat caviar  
A colour TV in the back of your car  
But one of these days  
Youre gonna be surpised
