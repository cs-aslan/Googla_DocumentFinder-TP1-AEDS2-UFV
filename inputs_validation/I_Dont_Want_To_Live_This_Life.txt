Now that youre gone i feel the painmy heart trembles i call your name  
I miss your touch your soft blonde hair i keep searching for an answer  
It just aint there  
  
And i dont want to live this life and i dont want to live this life  
And i dont want to live this life anymore  
  
Everywhere i turn the finger points on me youll never understand im in
misery  
cause baby without you i have no one oh my sweet darling what have i done  
  
And i dont want to live this life and i dont want to live this life  
And i dont want to live this life anymore  
  
She smiled at me as i held her carefully her last words were i love you  
Thought it ser me free and i cant forget that look on her face  
It looked like an angel as she died in my prayers  
  
And i dont want to live this life and i dont want to live this life  
And i dont want to live this life anymore
