I could be an animal for many years to come  
It would be understandable if this animal had fun  
My wayward soul will never set me free  
And commitments a miracle and Im physical you see  
  
Im not your lover baby  
Im not the one  
I wont meet your mother lady  
I dont do love  
  
You wont buy my attitude  
So its solitude for free  
And I cant help being rude  
If you get to close to me  
You are the one with your finger on the gun  
So I am that animal and animals will run  
  
Im not your loves baby  
Im not the one  
I wont meet your mother lady  
I dont do love  
  
I cant believe  
Its not in me  
You see me leave  
If I cant breathe  
  
I could be an animal for many years to come  
It would be understandable if this animal had fun  
And Ive got my alibi so Ill say goodbye  
  
Im not your lover baby  
Im not the one  
Ive been too smothered lately  
I dont do love  
  
I cant believe  
That you cant see  
Its not in me  
Now see me leave  
  
I dont do love  
I dont do love  
I dont do love  
I dont do love  
I dont do love  
I dont do love
