I have waited  
For your love  
For so long  
How do i go on  
I have told you  
So many times  
Its no good  
Youre treating me so wrong  
  
Out there so far away  
Above the sky will say  
For you  
Here it comes again  
Its all around me  
It must be magic  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
I can see you  
In my mind  
The lost time  
That youre saving  
I could reach out  
And touch you  
What can i do  
The sun aint shining  
  
Out there so far away  
Above the sky will say  
For you
