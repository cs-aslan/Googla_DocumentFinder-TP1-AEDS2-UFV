Its taste was sweet like summer wine  
the heart that beats in double time  
So he waltzed right in he bowled you over  
and youre still reeling from the feeling when hes gone  
The door is closed the lock is turned  
and all the memories and letters have been burned  
  
So when you pick the handsome flower  
dont forget the thorn upon the rose  
Its cut is deep and its scar lasts forever  
it follows love wherever love goes  
  
Just how we fall its hard to know  
when what we feel we seldom show  
So we show the parts we feel are best  
we squirm around the edges trying to cover up the rest  
You think you know him and he thinks the same  
when underneath it all its just a crazy guessing game  
  
So when you pick the handsome flower  
dont forget the thorn upon the rose  
Its cut is deep and its scar lasts forever  
it follows love wherever love goes  
  
Win or lose its just the same  
tears of joy tears of pain  
Theyre hand in hand they come as one  
youll never see the moon without the promise of the sun  
For all the bruises for all the blows  
Id rather feel the thorn than to never see the rose  
  
So when you pick the handsome flower  
dont forget the thorn upon the rose  
Its cut is deep and its scar lasts forever  
it follows love wherever love goes  
  
It follows love wherever love goes
