Im full of pride and my heart feels good  
Got news from my family up in the woods  
At last I can go back where I belong  
Sweated it all out for nine long years  
  
Couldnt believe the voice in my ears  
When the man saying no hiding son  
So I left the only folks I had known  
I was fifteen then hardly grown  
  
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud  
Couldnt get back and I couldnt go far  
Said to myself stay right where you are  
Done found yourself a ma and pa  
  
Chorus  
Everybody said the kids no good  
Come home johnny bride come home  
Johnny bride come home  
Were all wrong without you  
How did we ever doubt you  
He confessed to the killing  
Its his role we had you filling  
We didnt really mean to make you sad  
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad  
  
I left the only folks I had known  
I was fifteen then  hardly grown  
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud  
  
Couldnt get back and I couldnt go far  
Said to myself stay right where you are  
Done found yourself a ma and pa  
  
Chorus  
  
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad Repeats
