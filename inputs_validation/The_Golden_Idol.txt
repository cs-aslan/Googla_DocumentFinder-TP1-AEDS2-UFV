Well theyve made a Golden Idol of the girl you used to be  
Hangin bangles on your branches like a lonely Christmas tree  
Yeah theyve dressed you fit for killin in your thrillin new disguise  
Nailin artificial spangles to the diamonds in your eyes  
In that golden coach that turns into a bed  
You better make it gal before you wake up dead  
Cause theyll paint your burning beauty with a coat of shiny lies  
And theyll blind you with their wine so you wont even realize  
Til you watch the face youre washing disappearing down the drain  
And youre staring in your mirror going privately insane  
And that golden crown theyve pushed down on your head  
You better make it gal before you wake up dead  
Look around them golden sidewalks that youre walking on today  
And youll see that lonely gutter just a careless step away  
And that altar that theyre building you dont even understand  
Cause youre dazzled by the flashing of the daggers in their hands  
Youll be dancing in the darkness when their music disappears  
And the jangle of your chains will be the only sound you hear  
Til your broken bodys bleeding on an altar made of stone  
And youve sacrificed your soul to please a world thats sick and wrong  
And you never heard a single word I said  
Aww make it gal before you wake up dead
