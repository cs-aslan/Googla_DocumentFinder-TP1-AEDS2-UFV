Non dimenticar means  
Dont forget you are my darling  
Dont forget to be  
All you mean to me  
Non dimenticar my love  
Is like a star my darling  
Shining bright and clear  
Just because youre here  
  
Please do not forget  
That our lips have met  
And Ive held you tight dear  
Was it dreams ago  
My heart felt this glow  
Or only just tonight dear  
  
Non dimenticar  
Although you travel far my darling  
Its my heart you own  
So Ill wait alone  
Non dimenticar  
  
Se ci separ se ci allontan  
Lala del destino  
Non ne ho colpa no  
E mi sentiro sempre a te vicino  
  
Non dimenticar  
Although you travel far my darling  
Its my heart you own  
So Ill wait alone  
Non dimenticar
