I can in every way  
Distinct the pain I feel inside  
It comes to me  
Evil thoughts is creeping through my mind  
Who are you to say that I cant speak whats on my mind  
It runs away  
Its so predictable  
I can in every way  
Feel the strength that tingles up inside  
Too blind to see emptiness and sorrow of their lives  
You run away to the cover of their pointless ties  
  
You ax me  
Its so predictable  
Im gonna try  
Im gonna die  
Im gonna try  
  
Another day  
silence overwhelms my mind  
Who is to say  
if I have the time all wide  
Should I pray  
for all the hate to go away  
Another day  
I can never break free  
You wait for me  
I call out to you  
Another day  
Ill live forever
