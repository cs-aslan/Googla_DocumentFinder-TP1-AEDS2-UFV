I step into the light so you can clearly see  
And I dont know the first thing about you  
Here I stand before you now what you make of me  
Do I measure up to what you want  
I been rollin on the river too long  
Im a fool for rock n roll maybe too long too long  
Im a fool for rock n roll maybe too long  
Im a fool for loving it cause you know I do yes I do  
Im a fool for rock n roll maybe too long too long  
Just take stock of your life I hear him say to me  
Now youve got your fortune and your fate  
How long can things go on before they cease to be  
But you know that somethings never change  
And Ill keep rollin on the only way that I can  
Im a fool for rock n roll maybe too long too long  
Im a fool for rock n roll maybe too long too long  
Im a fool for loving it cause you know I do yes I do  
Im a fool for rock n roll  
I remember the way it used to be  
But any way that you want it thats alright with me  
For maybe too long too long  
Ill keep rollin on the only way that I can  
Im a fool for rock n roll for maybe too long too long  
Im a fool for rock n roll maybe too long too long long long yeah  
Yes Im a fool for rock n roll maybe too long too long  
Im a fool for rock n roll for maybe too long too long long long  
Im a fool for rock n roll rock n roll rock n roll baby  
Im a fool baby for rock n roll rock n roll rock n roll
