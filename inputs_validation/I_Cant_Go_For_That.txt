What I want youve got  
It might be hard to handle  
Like the flame that burns the candle  
The candle feeds the flame eh eh  
  
What Ive got is a full stock  
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter  
You pull them all together  
And how I cant explain oh yeah  
  
Well well you I cant go for that  
You make my dreams come true  
I cant go for that I cant go for that  
Well well well you  
I cant go for that  
Oh yeah you make my dreams come true  
I cant go for that I cant go for that  
  
On a night when bad dreams become a screamer  
When theyre messin with a dreamer  
I can laugh it in the face  
Twist and shout my way out  
And wrap yourself around me  
Cause I aint the way you found me  
And Ill never be the same oh yeah  
  
Well cause you I cant go for that  
You make my dreams come true  
I cant go for that I cant go for that  
Well well well you  
I cant go for that  
Oh yeah you make my dreams come true  
I cant go for that I cant go for that  
  
Oh listen to this  
  
Oh  
Im down on my daydream  
But that sleepwalk should be over by now  
I know  
  
Yeah you  
I Ill do anything that you want me to  
I Ill do almost anything  
You make my dreams come true  
I Ill do anything oh yeah that you want me to  
I Ill do almost anything  
You make my dreams come true  
I cant go for that  
You make my dreams come true  
I cant go for that I cant go for that  
  
You make my dreams come true  
I cant go for that I cant go for that  
You make my dreams come true
