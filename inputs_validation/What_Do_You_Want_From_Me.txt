As you look around this room tonight  
Settle in your seat and dim the lights  
Do you want my blood do you want my tears  
What do you want  
What do you want from me  
Should I sing until I cant sing any more  
Play these strings until my fingers are raw  
Youre so hard to please  
What do you want from me  
  
Do you think I know something you dont know  
What do you want from me  
If I dont promise you the answers would you go  
What do you want from me  
Should I stand out in the rain  
Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you  
Im not the one you need  
What do you want from me  
  
You can have anything you want  
You can drift you can dream even walk on water  
Anything you want  
  
You can own everything you see  
Sell your soul for complete control  
Is that really what you need  
  
You can lose yourself this night  
See inside there is nothing to hide  
Turn and face the light  
  
What do you want from me
