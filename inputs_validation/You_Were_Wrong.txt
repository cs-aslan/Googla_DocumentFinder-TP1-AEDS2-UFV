You were wrong you were wrong  
You were wrong yeah you were wrong  
You were wrong baby stayin away too long  
You know it aint right it aint right  
It aint right it aint right  
It aint right stayin out all night  
I try and I try with all my might to do the thing thats right  
No matter how good I treat you baby you only wanna fuss and fight  
You were wrong you were wrong  
You were wrong yeah you were wrong  
You were wrong baby stayin away too long  
You know it aint right it aint right  
I ask myself and I ask myself and ask myself again  
How can you do the things that right when you keep on livin in sin  
You were wrong you were wrong  
You were wrong yeah you were wrong  
You were wrong baby stayin away too long  
You know it aint right it aint right
