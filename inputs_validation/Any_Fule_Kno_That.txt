If youre in the right city at the right time  
Whats the last thing going through your mind  
Not talking bout your ask no questions you know its a lie  
Youre just a victim of a corporate crime  
All the signs of a shark attack  
Youve got rivers of blood on the streets dont look back  
Nothing personal just another snack  
N Harley said youre better off sticking to your guns  
Any fule kno that  
  
Oh Moronica Queen of the Biz  
And her friend Flash Harry thinks he knows what it is  
Tin Pan Alley Fat Head Larry dont know shit  
Just trying to keep her happy  
Theres no laughing in heaven not the one not the seven  
And youll never get to heaven in her row boat  
Pea brain pisser dog breath kisser  
N Harley said youre better off sticking to your guns  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that  
  
Ooh  
Wont it be nice  
When everything falls into place  
  
Salad days go atickling by  
Have a high time burn money in the meantime  
They bleed you dry  
Those suckers are smaller than life  
Oh Moronica Queen of the Biz  
And her friend Flash Harry thinks he knows what it is  
Tin Pan Alley Fat Head Larry dont know shit  
Im better off sticking to my guns  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that  
  
Ooh  
Wont it be nice  
When everything falls into place  
  
Danny went down to the river one day  
Didnt come back thats the last they say  
We ever saw of him thats no lie  
Spitting in your eye have no fear  
You dont want the truth  
Stick your finger in your ear  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that
