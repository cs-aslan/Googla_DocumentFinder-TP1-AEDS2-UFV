I remember the first time you laughed with me  
And I remember the promises  
You would never leave my side  
Now Im standing with the news of a tragedy  
Standing here with a fragile heart  
You see I never shed a tear  
I stayed strong for them oh yes I did  
When everybody disappears  
Its only you who keeps me strong  
And I cant imagine going on  
Without you in my life  
Going on with a fragile heart  
  
When I think aboutthink about life  
Lord I think of you  
I forget about everything else theres only you and I  
And I cant think about ever giving up  
Cant give up the fight no no  
The only thing that matters Lord is you  
  
I aint got no time to pretend  
That Im not missing you oh no no no no  
I know youre in good hands  
Same hands that hold my heart  
And Ill cherish every moment we spent  
As a gift from God above  
For he takes care of all the fragile hearts  
  
When I think about think about life  
Lord I think of you and I  
Forget about everything else  
Theres only you and I  
I cant think about ever ever ever giving up  
For the only thing that matters when Im going through  
Is giving my fragile heart right back to you  
  
You see my fragile hearts been broken  
And youre the only one who can put it all together again  
So Im trusting you Lord to see me through  
  
Theres only you and I  
I cant think about ever giving  
I cant give upup a fight  
The only thing that matters  
When Im going through  
Is giving my fragile heart right back to you  
When I think about my life  
IIII forget about everything else  
Only you and I  
And I cant think about ever giving up  
Cant give up No no no no  
The only thing that matters when Im going through  
Is giving my fragile heart back to you  
  
When I think about my life I forget about everything else  
Only you and I  
And I cant think about ever giving up  
Cant give up cant give up  
For the only thing that matters when Im going through  
Is giving my fragile heart back to you
