Lying here for hours  
Cant get my eyes to close  
Cant get one moments peace  
To save my doggone soul  
Ive been doin more than drinkin  
Tryin to ease my pain  
Everywhere I go  
Somebody speaks your name  
Oh my friends keep on askin  
Boy whats wrong with you  
I say Im worried  
Worried down with the blues  
Try to be a good man  
Work my fingers to the bone  
And you return the favor  
By messing up my happy home  
You played so many dirty tricks  
Till I lost my faith in you  
Now you want me to take you back  
Whats a poor man supposed to do  
Worried down with the blues  
Oh yes I am  
Worried down with the blues  
Oh I feel like I was born to lose  
Used to walk with pride with my head held high  
Now Im starin down at my shoes  
Yes I am worried  
Worried down with the blues  
You made me turn my back  
On my very best friend  
And when my back was turned  
You were messin around with him  
Id give up everything  
To have you by my side  
Cause in the cold cold night when I reach for you  
Im holdin to my foolish pride  
Worried down with the blues  
Oh yes I am  
Worried down with the blues  
Feel like I was born to lose  
Used to walk with pride with my head held high  
Now Im starin down at my shoes  
Yes I am worried  
Worried down with the blues oh yeah
