Closing my mouth  
before I scream  
Noone can shake  
my selfesteem  
  
Whisper my name  
confuse my mind  
To me its the same  
if Ill survive  
  
This game you cant win  
Who is free from sin  
I wont be afraid  
My soul will remain  
  
Go on and sleep  
the sleep of the just  
If your conscience is clean  
do what you must  
  
One day you will know  
I was a friend not foe  
I wont be afraid  
My soul will remain  
Let go of your hate  
I wont be afraid  
  
I wont be afraid  
My soul will remain  
let go of your hate  
I wont be afraid oh no
