It was the summer of 793  
When we sailed across the Great North Sea  
Comets crossed the skies that night  
Must have known something wasnt right  
  
We arrived upon your English shore  
And you offered friendship  
But we wanted more  
Yeah so much more  
  
Were tearing up this place tonight  
Literally  
Were gonna set this sleepy town alight  
Literally  
Well kill and steal and burn and drink  
Cause us vikings dont care what you think  
Woah oh oh  
  
Let me in wont you please  
Were here to raid your monasteries  
Were primed and ready to attack  
And we love how monks just dont fight back  
  
Youll die or become a slave to me  
Though our slaves often get chucked up in the sea  
If the boats heavy Yeah yeah  
  
Youre gonna lose your head my friend  
Literally  
Were gonna getcha in the end  
Literally  
And Ill drink a toast from your skull  
Cause were vikings and thats how we roll  
  
Play that axe Ragnor  
  
Were gonna paint the whole town red  
Literally  
With the blood of the dead  
Literally  
Well take everything that you own  
And get back on our ship and go back home  
Woah oh oh  
  
Were going home  
Woah oh oh  
Were going home  
Woah oh oh  
We are going home  
Woah oh oh  
We are going home  
Woah oh oh
