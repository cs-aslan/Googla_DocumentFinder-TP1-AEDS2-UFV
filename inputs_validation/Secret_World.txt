This is a garden  
This is a steeple  
I hear the crowd  
Before I ever  
See the people  
Yours for the asking  
And for the taking  
There is a power  
In the vacuum  
We are making  
  
You and I have a secret world  
And we can keep it unfurled  
And pay no attention  
To the cradle or the grave  
  
And when were crossed  
We can say that were lost  
In the middle of nowhere  
Think youll like it a lot  
And if were wrong  
And we end up alone  
Well light a candle  
For their innocent bones  
  
You and I have a secret world  
And we can keep it unfurled  
And pay no attention  
To the cradle or the grave  
  
You and I have a secret world

Think youll like it a lot
