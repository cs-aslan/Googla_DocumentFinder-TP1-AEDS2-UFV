You threw away the ballast and you rowed your boat ashore  
Didnt you now Didnt you  
You made your ultimatum too big to ignore  
Didnt you now Didnt you  
  
So you worked out your excuses  
Turned away and shut the door  
The worlds too vast for us now  
And you wanted to explore  
  
Its a long long long road  
And I dont know which way to go  
If you offered me your hand again Id have to walk away  
  
When I saw you at the street fair you called out my name  
Didnt you now Didnt you  
You said we could start over try and make it all okay  
Didnt you now Didnt you  
  
So our past has been rewritten  
And you threw away the pen  
Youd said that I was useless  
But now youll take me in again  
  
Well Jesus loves me fine  
And your words fall flat this time  
  
Was it my imagination or did I hear you say  
We dont have a prayer between us  
  
Didnt you believe that I have finally turned away  
Didnt you now Didnt you  
Anything to hold onto to help me through my day  
Didnt you now Didnt you  
  
Jesus loves me fine  
But his words fall flat this time  
  
Its a long long long road  
And I dont know which way to go  
If you offered me your world did you think Id really stay  
If you offered me the heavens I would have to turn away  
Was it my imagination or did I hear you say  
We dont have a prayer between us  
Didnt you now Didnt you now  
Didnt you
