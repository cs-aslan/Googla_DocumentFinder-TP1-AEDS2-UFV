She is an American car  
She isnt legal so she cant go far  
She got her mind stuck up in second gear  
Where she going aint exactly clear  
Baby please baby please I want to drive you home  
  
Low mileage without a pink slip  
Clean upholstery and it aint been ripped  
She stripped her gears only late last night  
I dont think that thing was oiling right  
Baby please baby please I want to drive you home  
  
She shakes and shimmies all over the road  
Shes always happy when she carry a load  
Another lonesome automobile  
Something bout the way she makes me feel  
Baby please baby please I want to drive you home
