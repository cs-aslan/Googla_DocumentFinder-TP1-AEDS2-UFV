When night time comes  
And Im ten thousand miles away  
Just lose yourself  
And watch the band kick back and play  
  
Get up keep in line  
Its gettin tighter all the time  
You say youre feelin fine  
Its gettin tighter all the time  
  
Get a load off your mind  
This place is right  
Its hard to find  
The mood is set alright  
Its gonna be a long long night  
You keep spinnin round  
You find it hard to touch the ground  
And time is all it takes  
Youll find it easy once you make  
  
Get up keep in line  
Its gettin tighter all the time  
Gettin tighter  
Gettin tighter
