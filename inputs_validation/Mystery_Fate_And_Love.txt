All my life Im waiting for you  
Mystery fate and love  
To pray for you but you merahef  
Far away Neelam  
Oh mystery fate and love  
Mystery fate and love  
My Lord my Lord give me a chance  
Give me a hand to hold on to  
Give me a chance give me a hand  
To hold on to  
Oh mystery fate and love  
  
All alone all alone  
Beemuna ubitfilam tefilah ho  
But you merahef far away neelam  
Oh mystery fate and love  
Mystery fate and love  
My Lord my Lord give me a chance  
Give me a hand to hold on to  
Give me a chance give me a hand  
To hold on to  
Oh mystery fate and love
