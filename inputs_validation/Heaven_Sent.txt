Your eyes are like deep wells of desire  
Once in your arms Im on fire  
You were sent girl so perfectly true  
Changing my life  
Now Im a survivor  
  
Chorus  
Heaven sent  
Thats what I call you  
Heaven sent  
Thats what I call you  
  
Late at night when the evening fire has died  
Theres a look in your eye  
Seductive images fly  
  
Chorus  
  
One day youll see what angels can see  
Dressed in black if she comes back  
I think Ill loose my mind  
  
Tuesday she works  
In the library uptown  
Some useful knowledge  
Can always be found  
Dont burn the library  
Till youve read all the books  
Sometimes in life  
You get a second look  
  
Chorus  
  
Heaven sent  
Thats what I call you  
Heaven sent  
Thats what I call you  
  
Heaven sent Repeat x5
