Let the right one in  
Let the old dreams die  
Let the wrong ones go  
They cannot  
They cannot  
They cannot do what you want them to do  
Oh  
  
Let the right one in  
Let the old dreams die  
Let the wrong ones go  
They do not  
They do not  
They do not see what you want them to  
Oh  
  
Let the right one in  
Let the old things fade  
Put the tricks and schemes for good away  
  
AhI will advise  
AhUntil my mouth dries  
AhI will advise you to  
  
Ahlet the right one slip in  
Slip in  
Slip in  
  
And when at last it does  
Id say you were within your rights to bite  
The right one and say what kept you so long  
What kept you so long  
Oh
