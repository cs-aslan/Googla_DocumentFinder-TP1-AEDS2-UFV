Dont go and hide  
Yesterday you were my girlfriend  
If you do  
My inside goes around and around in a whirlwind  
  
Theres a stone in my shoe  
So I cant catch you up  
My heads in a lions mouth  
Wants to eat me up  
Right here today  
Dont look away  
Ive always been true  
And I still love you  
So dont look away  
Theres a lot you can do  
To get me away  
Youve got to stay  
Dont look away  
Dont look away  
  
I once heard you say  
If I ever was down you would help me  
Now my heads being chewed up  
You pretend that you dont see  
  
Theres a stone in my shoe  
So I cant catch you up  
My heads in a lions mouth  
Wants to eat me up  
Right here today  
Dont look away  
Ive always been true  
And I still love you  
So dont look away  
Theres a lot you can do  
To get me away  
Youve got to stay  
Dont look away  
Dont look away  
  
Ive always been true  
And I still love you  
So dont look away  
Theres a lot you can do  
To get me away  
Youve got to stay  
Dont look away  
Dont look away  
Dont look away  
Dont look away  
Dont look away
