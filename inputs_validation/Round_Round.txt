I just cant help thinking  
What youve done to me  
You built a wall of love and tore it right down  
In front of me  
And you think you know whats going on  
You keep telling me that I am wrong  
I dont care about what you do  
Cause if you mess with me Ill get rid of you  
  
The picture you see is no portrait of me  
Its too real to be shown to someone I dont know  
And its driving me wild  
It makes me act like a child  
  
You think I am crazy but what can I do  
You waste your time like my money  
It aint so funny but its true  
Dont waste my money baby  
Now you cant tell me whats going on  
And that I am weak while you are strong  
What is it you need that makes your heart bleed  
Do you really know Cause it doesnt show  
  
The picture you see is no portrait of me  
Its too real to be shown to someone I dont know  
And its driving me wild  
It makes me act like a child  
  
The picture you see is no portrait of me  
Its too real to be shown to someone I dont know  
And its driving me wild  
It makes me act like a child
