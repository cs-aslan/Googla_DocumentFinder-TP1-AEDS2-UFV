A long tailed cat sitting by the old rocking chair  
Now he dont realize that theres a danger there  
But he dont care no rock n roll chair is gonna boogie on his day  
Cause when his tail took a low down syncopate yeah  
  
Im going down to Orleans town to get a pound of feed  
Be back home in just bout a half of week yeah  
You may be a symphony babe but I believe in song  
Got a catchy melody so you can sing along  
  
Oh they say you know theyre talking bout the girls that work up town  
I dont realize the amount of danger now  
No swinging tail no rock n roll girl is gonna boogie woogie on my day  
Cause I made my time on a Dixie holiday yeah  
  
Im going down to Orleans town on a Dixie holiday  
To get myself a tonk of that harmony yeah  
You may be a symphony baby but I believe in song  
Its got a catchy melody so you can sing along  
  
Everybody sing along along  
Dont know what you sing along  
Well youre gonna sing along along  
  
All you sing is oh my oh my my  
Your daddys getting older and the cows are going dry  
Gotta go bye go bye bye  
On a Dixie holiday  
  
Oh my oh my my  
Your daddys getting older and the cows are going dry  
You gotta go bye go bye bye  
On a Dixie holiday  
  
Oh my oh my my  
Your daddys getting older and the cows are going dry  
You gotta go bye go bye bye  
On a Dixie holiday
