Chorus  
Going nowhere fast  
Weve reached the climax  
Were together now were undone  
Wont commit so we choose to  
Run away  
Do we separate Oh  
Dont wanna give in so we both gave up  
Cant take it back its too late weve reached the climax  
Climax  
  
Ive fallen somehow  
Feet off the ground  
Love is the cloud  
That keeps raining down  
Where are you now  
When I need you around  
Im on my knees but it seems were  
  
Chorus  
  
I gave my best it wasnt enough  
You get upset we argue too much  
We made a mess of what used to be love  
So why do I care I care at all  
At all  
At all  
At all  
  
Chorus  
  
You say its better if we  
Love each other separately  
I just need you one more time  
I cant get what we had out my mind  
Where are you now  
When I need you around  
Im on my knees  
But it seems were going  
  
Chorus
