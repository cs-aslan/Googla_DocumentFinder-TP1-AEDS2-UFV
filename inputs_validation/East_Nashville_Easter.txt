Engines running hot  
But now its burnin down  
Everyone says that this is going well  
But I can hear every sound  
  
Four gray walls  
Make it all seem right  
But everything looks wrong  
In these cheap hotel lights  
  
Chorus  
Going up and down  
Down and out  
  
Cheap cologne and expensive perfume  
Ive never seen so many lost souls in my life  
Air so thick so busy and loud  
One crazy young man standing out in the crowd  
  
Chorus  
  
One of these days when the sun comes up and Im tossin and turnin alone  
Im gonna pull myself up outta this state  
Im gonna make everything seem alright alright  
Know how it feels with the sun in my eyes still that heartbroken winds at my
door  
One of these days Im gonna wreck myself and this engine wont run no more no
more  
  
Chorus x2
