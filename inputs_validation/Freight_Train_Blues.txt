I was born in Dixie in a boomers shack  
Just a little old shanty by a railroad track  
The hummin of the drivers was my lullaby  
And a freight train whistle taught me how to cry  
  
Ive got the freight train blues Lordy Lordy Lordy  
Got em in the bottom of my ramblin shoes  
And when that whistle blows Ive gotta go  
Oh Lordy guess Im never gonna lose  
The mean old freight train blues  
  
Now my Pappy was a fireman and my Mammy dear  
Was the only daughter of an engin eer  
My sister married a brakeman and it aint no joke  
Now its a shame the way she keeps a good man broke  
  
Ive got the freight train blues Lordy Lordy Lordy  
Got em in the bottom of my ramblin shoes  
Andwhen the whistle blows Ive gotta go  
Oh Lordy guess Im never gonna lose  
The mean old freight train blues
