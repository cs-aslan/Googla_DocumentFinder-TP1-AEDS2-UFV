Does it hurt to be polite  
Or is it just cool to be unkind  
Must you always hurt the ones you love  
And then get paid back in time  
Now now now  
Andy is fine but his taste is not mine  
Let me tell you I dont mean maybe  
Im getting really tired of andys babies  
Some say that children should be seen and not heard  
Thats what id preferred  
Lets go downtown for a wine  
Im sure youll be forced to smile  
When you see andys babies  
And the bohemian lifestyle  
Now now now  
Andys a saint  
But im loosing my patience  
I really dont mean maybe  
Dont even wanna talk about andys babies  
So andy says his children will inherit the earth  
Isnt that absurd in a word  
Trudys in the bathroom  
Shes trying to clean up her eyes  
And donalds gone to mass  
Yes we are thankful for that  
Its eight in the morning  
And still you cant get no sleep  
On account of this perfect day and  
All this white light white heat  
Ah isnt that sweet
