Lets take on the world forget that you feel a girl  
Once youre away everyones still the same  
If I could rip at your shirt just to see if itd hurt  
Everydays golden day when youve got someone to blame  
Could you feel so much in a bus youre sure theres nothing you can trust  
Once youre away everyone stabs the same  
Sleep forever on your breast treat everyday now like a test  
But youll still say everyones to blame
