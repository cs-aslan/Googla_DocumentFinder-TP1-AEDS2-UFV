Well Ive been waiting all year  
Just for this day to get here  
And Ive been learning nothing goes  
Exactly like you plan  
  
Yeah Ive been flying solo  
Wishing I was in Soho  
I thought Id be a nogo for this show  
But here I am  
  
You might have seen me checking out  
Whats underneath that tree  
But I have realized that there is  
Just one gift for me  
  
Its a perfect Christmas  
Its a perfect Christmas  
Its a perfect Christmas  
Cause Im with you  
  
Wooh  
  
The ornaments are rocking  
Somebody stole my stocking  
I think I threw out all my gift cards  
With the recycling  
  
The Christmas lights are tangled  
The mistletoe got mangled  
And even though my nerves are jangled  
Im good with everything  
  
Cause now I know the reason  
Its the season of good cheer  
Id even eat the fruit cake  
Its the same one as last year  
  
Its a perfect Christmas  
Its a perfect Christmas  
Its a perfect Christmas  
Cause Im with you  
  
Hey Hey Hey  
Put your hands up in the air  
Ho Ho Ho  
Santa can you feel it  
Here we go  
Spread the magic everywhere  
Hey Ho Everybody shout out loud  
  
Its a perfect Christmas  
Its a perfect Christmas  
Its a perfect Christmas  
Cause Im with you Hey Hey Hey  
Cause Im with you Ho Ho Ho  
Cause Im with you Here we go  
Cause Im with you Ho Ho Ho  
Cause Im with you
