They say radiations harmful  
Its a fact of life  
Without it we would die  
  
Were nuclear babies now  
Were nuclear babies now  
  
Were nuclear babies now  
Were nuclear babies now  
Were nuclear babies now  
  
Radiations here to stay  
I think Ill cop some cosmic rays  
It gives my skin that healthy glow Ohwoah  
  
Makes my eyes shine clear and bright  
And when its dark I dont need light  
Im irridescent all the time Ohwoah  
  
Theres nothing wrong with a mutation  
Theyre good for mankind and the nation  
Theyre useful for society  
It breaks up the monotony  
  
Different sizes different colours  
Some have bones that bend like rubber  
No two faces look alike  
We snap We crawl  
We bounce We fly  
Our temperatures unique and vary  
Long and short Were Bald and hairy  
Theres one thing that were all sure of  
Were mutants and we just dont care  
  
Were nuclear babies now  
Were nuclear babies now  
  
Radiations fine by me  
The unpredictability  
I like the way it changes chromosomes  
  
Theres nothing wrong with a mutation  
Theyre good for mankind and the nation  
Theyre useful for society  
It breaks up the monotony  
  
Ive been soaking up those rays for such a long time  
That I feel fine when Im blue  
Plutonium will do or Cobalt too  
Neutrons Xrays dont forget the Gamma rays  
Bop ba bop ba bop ba bop  
  
Theres one thing were sure of  
Were mutants and we just dont care  
  
Were nuclear babies now  
Were nuclear babies now  
  
Ahhhh ah ah ah ah ah ahhhh  
  
Were nuclear babies  
Were nuclear babies  
Were nuclear babies  
  
Ahhh ah ah ah ah ah ahhhhh  
  
Were nuclear babies  
Were nuclear babies  
Were nuclear babies  
  
Ahhhhhhh
