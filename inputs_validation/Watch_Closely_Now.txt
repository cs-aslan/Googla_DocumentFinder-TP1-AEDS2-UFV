Watch closely now  
Youll observe a curious exchange of energy  
Are you a figment of my imagination  
Or I one of yours  
  
Watch closely now are you watching me now  
Your eyes are like fingers  
Theyre touching my body and arousing my soul  
Ridin the passion arising inside me  
How high can I go  
Youre comin with me girl  
Im gonna show you how  
When its scary dont look down  
  
Watch closely now are you watching me now  
I see the hunger arise in your eyes and its aurging me on  
Higher and harder and faster and farther  
Than Ive ever gone  
Youre comin closer lady  
Dont ya leave me now  
Were gonna make it  
Dont look down  
  
Maybe Im takin me too many chances  
With no net at all  
Maybe Ill teach you at least that  
Youve got to be free when you fall  
  
Watch closely now are you watching me now  
Im the master magician whos setting you free  
From the lies youve been told  
When theyre breaking your back  
Bring your last straw to me  
I turn straw into gold  
Im gonna need you later  
When youre not around  
But I can take it  
Dont look down  
  
Watch closely now  
Are you watching me now
