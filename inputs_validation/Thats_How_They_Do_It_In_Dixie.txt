Cutoff jeans an cowboy boots  
Long blonde hair an dark brown roots  
Lord pinch me  
Thats how they do it in Dixie  
  
Electric slidin on a sawdust floor  
Longneck chaser for a  
Shot of hard core whiskey  
Thats how they do it in Dixie  
  
Blue red GO stickers on the window says Sugar n spice  
Baby crank the bass up ride it till you see girl  
Those pink paradise  
Oh aint that nice  
  
Down to the river to go for a dip  
Rollin them Levis off of her hip  
Goin Big Kenny skinny  
Thats how they do it in Dixie  
Splishsplash  
  
Instrumental Break  
  
Watermelon lipgloss kiss beneath the swamp moss  
On a moonlit night  
Bubble gum perfume well placed tattoo  
Above her hiney high  
Oh my  
  
Belly button danglin a twenty minute tan  
You know Ill go to Jerry Springer if you hit on my man  
That girl will throw a hissy  
Thats how they do it in Dixie  
  
Cutoff jeans an cowboy boots  
Long blonde hair an dark brown roots  
Lord pinch me
