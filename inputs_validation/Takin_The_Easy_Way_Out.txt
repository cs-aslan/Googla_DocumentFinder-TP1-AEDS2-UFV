You contend  
That youll never got back to her again  
Youre as free as a night without end  
So you tell your friends  
  
Just what you had to endure  
When you told her never never again  
And as the room about you starts to bend  
You pretend  
  
That youve taken the easy way out  
Though you know ehn you told her last night  
You were fakin the easy way out  
With one hand reachin fo the door  
  
But your feet werent movin  
They were nailed to the floor  
As she told you once more  
Theres no easy way to get out  
  
Shes not like you  
Shed rather stay at home  
n not get the blues  
And if you ever do try to intrude  
  
Shes so respectfully rude  
So it was hard to believe  
Last night while you were drunk n  
Threatening to leave  
  
That she walked through the door with such ease  
n threw you the key  
And shes takin the easy way out  
And youre alone with no number to call  
  
Shes taken the easy way out  
With one hand reachin for the door  
And you so speechless  
Marooned on the floor  
  
She walked out of your life  
Couldnt stand it no more  
Now youre all on your own  
Cause shes taken the easy way out  
  
You know shes taken the easy way out  
Oh but your pride will only admit to a lie  
Yeah shes taken the easy way out  
But to your friends  
  
Youre the hero of the night  
Drowning with beef all the tears in your eyes  
Hopin it dont show that youre dyin inside  
Cause you cant quite believe  
  
That shes taken the easy way out  
Theres no goin back now  
Stuck here on your own  
Lookin for a home  
  
Drunk and on the streets  
Stuck on your feet
