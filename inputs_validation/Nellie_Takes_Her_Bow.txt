Who thanked the Lord for the clothes  
That she wore and mended  
Nellie with the big old fashioned eyes  
  
Who won the heart of a crowd  
Tore apart took a bow  
Nellie theres a different world backstage  
  
Chorus  
I see the flood lights burning  
I hear the band play on  
Now Nellie takes her bow  
  
She said she really could not stay  
She had a brand new play to play  
And so she paints her face and smiles  
And shell be someone else in a while  
  
Chorus  
  
Just a lonely girl who could not face a broken world  
And so she acts out all her dreams and wishes thats how it had been  
But when the audience is near it seems as though she doesnt even care  
  
Chorus  
  
Nellie just sent me a line to tell me she was doing fine  
She got the lead and on Broadway and now theyre digging her today  
And as she turns the final page living  
Someones life upon the stage  
  
Chorus
