The summertime has gone  
Youll never ever be alone  
  
You are my sun  
All the strangers in time  
Please call me later tonight  
Cause Im waiting for love  
The summertime has gone  
Youll never ever be alone  
  
You are my sun  
In the darkness of time  
The night is so long  
Youll never ever be alone  
  
The summertime has gone  
Youll never ever be alone  
  
When you are crying  
And the moon starts to shine  
Please take my hand  
Into the ocean of love  
The summertime has gone  
Youll never ever be alone  
  
When you are smiling  
And the moon starts to shine  
Cause tonight is so long  
Youll never ever be alone  
  
The summer night has gone  
Youll never ever be alone  
  
You are my sun  
All the strangers in time  
Please call me later tonight  
Cause Im waiting for love  
The summertime has gone  
Youll never ever be alone  
  
You are my sun  
In the darkness of night  
The night is so long  
Youll never ever be alone
