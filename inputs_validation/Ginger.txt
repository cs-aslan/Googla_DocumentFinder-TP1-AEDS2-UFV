Something infests me when Im alone  
Its lunacy  
I want to vomit spit out my life  
So queer is seems  
Retract your reverence and slander me  
Im the traitor of mine  
A closeup picture of my lost chastity  
Theres nothing left of me anymore  
and no rain can wash away those bloody tears  
As sweet sounds of destruction reach my ears  
Red lips like roses call my name  
But laughter is all the woman of now hears  
in gloom I wander it batters me  
Though I subsist of it  
The smell of incense arouses me  
Abeyance maddens me  
A ginger sunset is my caress  
As I expire  
As musics fading I fade within  
Theres nothing left of me anymore  
and no rain can wash away those bloody tears  
As sweet sounds of destruction reach my ears  
Red lips like roses call my name  
But laughter is all the woman of now hears
