See the funny little people running round in circles  
Throwing bombs as they do  
See the funny side of it  
Theyre heading straight for you  
  
See the funny little holes theyre making  
Looking like craters on the moon  
See the funny side of it  
Well be living in them soon  
  
But its a super life a super dupa dupa life we live  
Yes its a super life a super dupa dupa life we live  
But its getting pretty near the end  
Cause with a super life you will borrow everything you lend  
So theres never anything to spend  
Youre broke you dope you  
  
See the funny little flying saucers we found  
Painted up just for you  
See the funny man inside  
His color matches too  
  
See the silly little camera he loves  
Shooting pictures with all day  
See the funny side of it  
His friends are on their way  
  
But its a super life a super dupa dupa life we live  
Yes its a super life a super dupa dupa life we live  
But its getting pretty near the end  
Cause with a super life you will borrow everything you lend  
So theres never anything to spend  
Youre broke you dope you  
  
Baby its a super life a super dupa dupa life we live  
Yes its a super life a super dupa dupa life we live
