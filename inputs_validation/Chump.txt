I dont know you but I think I hate you  
Youre the reason for my misery  
Strange how youve become my biggest enemy  
I have never even seen your face  
  
Maybe its just jealousy  
Mixed up with a violent mind  
A circumstance that doesnt make much sense  
Or maybe Im just dumb  
  
Youre the cloud hanging out over my head  
Hail comes crashing down welting my face  
Magic man egocentric plastic man  
Yet you still got one over on me
