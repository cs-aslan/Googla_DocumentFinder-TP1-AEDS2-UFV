I was dreaming of the past  
And my heart was beating fast  
I began to lose control  
I began to lose control  
I didnt mean to hurt you  
Im sorry that I made you cry  
I didnt mean to hurt you  
Im just a jealous guy  
I was feeling insecure  
You might not love me any more  
I was shivering inside  
I was shivering inside  
I didnt mean to hurt you  
Im sorry that I made you cry  
I didnt want to hurt you  
Im just a jealous guy  
I was trying to catch your eyes  
I thought that you was trying to hide  
I was swallowing my pain  
I was swallowing my pain  
I didnt mean to hurt you  
Im sorry that I made you cry  
I didnt mean to hurt you  
Im just a jealous guy
