Verse 1  
Pummeled from the moment you wake a void of confusion 24 hours a day  
Twisted reality eternal debate the clouds are flowing somethings going to
break  
Deliver me it will deliver you faceless masses of grey and blue  
The sky is falling a rain of blood  
The souls are empty above  
  
Chorus  
Strange Daze its hard to accept  
Strange ways you never expect  
Strange dazeNothing makes sense  
Strange Daze trying to make sense of it all  
  
Verse 2  
Loss of balance with an axe to grind  
People talking with nothing really on their minds  
No provocation no sparks to the flame  
Investigations with nothing left say  
Remember me I wont remember you  
Dogs are howling over what you do  
Skin is crawling you embrace your self Im not feeling too well
