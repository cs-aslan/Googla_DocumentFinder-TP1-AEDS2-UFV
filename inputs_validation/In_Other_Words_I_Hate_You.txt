It took a few packed bags and a few slammed doors  
It took a false false smile with a septic pause  
From my plastic moustache to your clipon claws  
In other words I hate you  
  
It took a thousand fights with a thousand draws  
It took a blinkered vision for a long lost cause  
As Romeo leaves to light applause  
And softly says I hate you  
  
My attitude leaves a lot to be desired  
My fashion sense has never been quite right  
But Id rather live in drainpipes  
Than with friends that Ive acquired  
In so many words I hate you  
  
Those winter nights just spent indoors  
That criminal fizz in the drink he pours  
We smooch all night to The Theme From Jaws  
In other words I hate you  
  
Whats yours is mine and mine is yours  
A screaming for a get out clause  
Heres the man with a thousand motherinlaws  
In other words I hate you  
  
My looks leave a lot to be desired  
My music taste has never been the trend  
But me and Perry Como well our patience has expired  
In so many words I hate you
