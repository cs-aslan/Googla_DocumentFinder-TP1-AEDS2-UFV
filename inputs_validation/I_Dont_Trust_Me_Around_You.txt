Youre standing much too close to me again  
Id never once touched you  
But in my mind Ive already sinned  
Youre making it hard for me to be true  
I dont trust me around you  
  
Seems like every place I go I see you there  
I cant keep my eyes off you  
I just stand and stare  
You tempt me more than anyone I ever knew  
  
I dont trust me around you  
I dont trust me around you  
I belong to someone else  
Not once have I been untrue  
But when Im close to you this way I find myself wanting to  
  
I dont trust me around you
