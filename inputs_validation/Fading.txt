Running around  
Trying to figure out now  
Where you put your smile down  
You cant let them see you like this  
Thinking what mask youre gonna front  
You grab the nearest one  
You take your place  
  
Amongst these faceless others  
Underneath the surface  
Everythings so backwards  
Its all a lie  
  
Chorus  
Run away  
Save yourself let it go  
Its too late  
Im losing you  
Youre fading  
  
Dont move  
Sit there in a trance  
Do not make a sound  
Fool what were you thinking  
Fallen no ones gonna call  
No hands were up at all  
Youre on your own again  
  
Walls are closing in  
You cant feel anything  
Becoming one of them  
Come back to me  
  
Chorus  
Run away  
Save yourself let it go  
Its too late  
Im losing you  
Youre fading  
  
Fading fading fading  
Fading fading fading  
  
Chorus  
Run away  
Save yourself let it go  
Its too late  
Im losing you  
Youre fading away  
  
Save yourself let it go  
Its too late  
Im losing you  
Youre fading  
  
Fading fading
