My place  
Some people say its  
Bad taste  
One thing that I can see  
They take themselves  
Too seriously  
My shoes  
They once were worn by  
Howard Hugues  
But I know  
Im never gonna walk  
That way  
  
Thats why I need you  
I need you  
There is no other girl  
In any other world  
No barbarella kiss  
Can make me feel like this  
I need you  
  
Tell me your stars  
Ill tell you what your chances are  
One thing that I can see  
You take yourself too seriously  
My place  
It might as well be outer space  
But I know its always gonna be that way  
  
Thats why I want you  
I want you  
There is no other chance  
No other circumstance  
No way to change the past  
Now is here to last  
I want you  
  
Have you ever been stood in the middle of the street  
With a mindful of doubt and the world at your feet  
When your heads full of rain on a bright sunny day  
And the words in your head are like cold lumps of clay  
Never feeling home was a place you belong  
So you get lost in the words of a Bob Dylan song  
Staying up all night with a royal marine  
Trying to learn the chords to Moonage Daydream  
  
Thats why I need you  
And I want you  
There is no other girl  
In any other world  
No way to chage the past  
Now youre here at last  
And I need you
