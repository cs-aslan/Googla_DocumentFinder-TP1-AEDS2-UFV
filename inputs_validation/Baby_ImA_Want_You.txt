Baby Ima want you  
Baby Ima need you  
Youre the only one I care enough to hurt about  
Maybe Ima crazy  
But I just cant live without  
  
Your lovin and affection  
Givin me direction  
Like a guiding light to help me through my darkest hour  
Lately Im aprayin  
That youll always be astayin beside me  
  
Used to be my life was just emotions passing by  
Feeling all the while and never really knowing why  
  
Lately Im aprayin  
That youll always be astayin beside me  
  
Used to be my life was just emotions passing by  
Then you came along and made me laugh  
And made me cry  
You taught me why  
  
Baby Ima want you  
Baby Ima need you  
  
Oh it took so long to find you baby  
Baby Ima want you  
Baby Ima need you
