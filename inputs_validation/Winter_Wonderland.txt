Sleigh bells ring  
Are you listening  
In the lane  
Snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight  
Were happy tonight  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away  
Is the bluebird  
Here to stay  
Is a new bird  
He sings a love song  
As we go along  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow  
We can build a snowman  
And pretend  
That he is Parson Brown  
Hell say are you married  
Well say No man  
But you can do the job  
When youre in town  
  
Later on well conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid  
The plans that weve made  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow  
We can build a snowman  
And pretend  
That hes a circus clown  
Well have lots of fun  
With Mr Snowman  
Until the other kids  
Come knock him down  
  
When its cold  
Aint it thrilling  
When your nose  
Gets to chilling  
Well frolic and play  
The eskimo way  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland
