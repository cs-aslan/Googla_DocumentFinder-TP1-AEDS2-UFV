She was a bad thing coming  
But I did not know  
And everytime I came over she told me I had to go  
I said Hey whats going on I really want to know  
She said I cannot tell you now but Ill call you tomorrow  
Thats not enough  
I want more  
I want it all  
I want to bang on your front door  
Turn off the lights  
And shut out the world  
Cause at the end of the day  
Arent we all just boys and girls  
Yeah  
Shes snake me with sophisication  
So much class  
She drinks a Santa margarita  
Would you like a glass  
I dont know how to say no  
And after three or four  
I was on the floor  
Singing my song  
La la la  
No no  
Thats not enough  
I want more  
I want it all  
I want to bang on your front door  
Turn off the lights  
And shut out the world  
Cause at the end of the day  
Arent we all just boys and girls  
Yeah  
La la la  
No no  
Thats not enough  
I want more  
I want it all  
I want to bang on your front door  
Turn off the lights  
And shut out the world  
Cause at the end of the day  
Arent we all just boys and girls  
Arent we all just boys and girls  
Arent we all just boys and girls all just boys and girls  
Oh yeah Oh  
Arent we all just boys and girls  
Arent we all just boys and girls
