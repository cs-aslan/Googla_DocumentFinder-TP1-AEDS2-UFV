A Bridge That Just Wont Burn  
I threw away the pictures of those better days in Dallas  
But I cant throw away these pictures in my mind  
Shes a page of precious memories  
  
Ive tried hard to turn  
Shes standing on a bridge that just wont burn  
If only time will heal the hurt  
Then this may last forever  
  
I may never know how it feels to forget  
Every time I think about her  
Those old feelings still return  
Shes standing on a bridge that just wont burn  
  
Ive burned a lot of bridges in my time  
But the one I just crossed over  
It aint the burning kind  
Shes that once in a lifetime  
  
Kind of love that never will return  
Shes standing on a bridge that just wont burn  
Shes standing on a bridge that just wont burn
