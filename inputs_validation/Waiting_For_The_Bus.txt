We got the mother and the kids  
We got the guy and his date  
We all get mad  
We all get laid  
Looks like somebody forgot about us  
Standin on the corner  
Waitin for a bus  
Say hey mister driver man  
Dont be slow  
Cause I got somewhere I got to go  
Say hey mister driver man  
Drive that thing fast  
My precious time keep slippin past  
Lets call the mayor lets complain  
Looks like the citys done to us again  
Tied up in traffic whatya know  
The damn city bus moves so slow  
I said hey mister driver man  
Dont be slow  
Cause I got somewhere I got to go  
Say hey mister driver man  
Drive that thing fast  
My precious time keep slippin past
