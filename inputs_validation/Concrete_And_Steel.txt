Hard and cold like a street of gold  
Its easy to find but so hard to hold  
Smooth and strong but it wont last long  
When the rust sets in shell be good as gone  
  
Concrete Concrete and steel  
Its like concrete  
Hey baby whats the deal  
  
A heart of stone make you feel alone  
but what can you do when your hand is blown  
Hard as ice its like tumblin dice  
before you fall for her boy you better think twice  
  
Concrete Concrete and steel  
Its like concrete  
Hey baby whats the deal  
  
Dark as night diamond bright  
Never seen such a strange delight  
Slick as glass and just as fast  
Youll feel the pain but it wont last
