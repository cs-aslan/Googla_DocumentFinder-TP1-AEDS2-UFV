I aint in no rush  
I handle you niggas when I feel like it  
I just be chillin  
Your bitch is chillin too  
  
When I feel like it kill these hoes when I feel like it  
When I feel like it thats my bitch when I feel like it  
When I feel like it kill these niggas when I feel like it  
Now I do this shit when I feel like it  
When I feel like it smoke one when I feel like it  
When I feel like it pou up when I feel like it  
When I feel like it cash out when I feel like it  
Now I do this shit when I feel like it  
  
The way its shaped they say its fake  
I cant lie I still like it  
No snitch I cant tell if it look real and it feel like it  
She bend it over I will hike it  
Number one pick got skills like it  
Heard she fucks with some ball player  
When I touch down I still spike it  
Know I got that check on me  
Im not Nike but it feel like it  
At the game in them floor seats  
I aint Spike but I feel like it  
We aint friends we dont chill like it  
You aint my dog we dont bill like it  
My nigga no camera man  
But he be flashing them steels like it  
Where Im from it aint Iraq  
But swear to God it get real like it  
Got soldiers in the field like it  
Bout mine you get killed like it  
Pussy niggas be commentating  
Say they aint hating but it feel like it  
Just post a pic of me and his boo on Instagram  
Think hell like it  
  
When I feel like it kill these hoes when I feel like it  
When I feel like it thats my bitch when I feel like it  
When I feel like it kill these niggas when I feel like it  
Now I do this shit when I feel like it  
When I feel like it smoke one when I feel like it  
When I feel like it pou up when I feel like it  
When I feel like it cash out when I feel like it  
Now I do this shit when I feel like it  
  
I aint a chef I make meals like him  
Cut em up into thin slices  
I got bricks like constructions  
You want instructions  
You niggas aint built like me  
Competition aint real like me  
Im so sick who ill like me  
Two bricks in my suite  
So when I leave I bet them bitches still dyking  
Family good cause I feel like it  
Im hood cause I feel like it  
Might not be your favorite artist  
But your favorite artist got a verse from me  
So they still like it  
Aint nobody popping seals like me  
Codeine like a supplement  
If I make her cum its a compliment  
Nigga fuck you like a parking ticket  
Now I got caine like a walking stick  
Shoot you for a argument  
Make all my bitches take all your bitches and play hide and get  
Im getting rich cause I feel like it  
Take your girl cause I feel like it  
Cash her out toss her up  
Wash her up thats the spin cycle  
And them niggas never did like it  
In the car and I got the title  
Grandma bought me a hand bible  
I bought me a hand rifle Fire  
Cause I feel like it  
All you niggas look recycled  
And Im getting head in the car while shes driving  
  
When I feel like it kill these hoes when I feel like it  
When I feel like it thats my bitch when I feel like it  
When I feel like it kill these niggas when I feel like it  
Now I do this shit when I feel like it  
When I feel like it smoke one when I feel like it  
When I feel like it pou up when I feel like it  
When I feel like it cash out when I feel like it  
Now I do this shit when I feel like it
