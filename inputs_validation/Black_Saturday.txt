Promise something  
Kill me right away if I start to get slow  
And dont remember  
How to separate the worm from the apple  
Dont wait til tomorrow  
Kill me right away if I start to listen  
To the voices  
Telling all the mouths what they need to swallow  
  
Do that for me its the least that you can do  
Dont be afraid I would do the same for you  
Burn out any memory of me ever breathing  
Til Im born again  
  
I was thirsty  
I remember that you gave me some water  
I was angry  
Everything at once you gave me no trouble  
I was crying  
I remember that you gave me your shoulder  
  
Do that for me its the least that you can do  
Dont be afraid I would do the same for you  
Burn out any memory of me ever breathing  
Til Im born again born again  
  
Do that for me its the least that you can do  
Dont be afraid I would do the same for you  
Burn out any memory of me ever breathing  
Til Im born again born again born again born again
