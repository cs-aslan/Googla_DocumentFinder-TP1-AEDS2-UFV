Hey see you soon  
Sail through your room  
Ill meet you there  
  
Hey be my friend  
Stay til the end  
Dont walk away  
Hey hey heyhey  
  
Hey take them off  
Dont talk that way  
Dont hear my lover say  
Hey hey hey  
  
Chains move that thing  
Chains we dont see  
My chains way too long  
Chains  
  
Chains move that thing  
Chains we dont see  
Chains are way too long  
And hear my song  
Hear my song
