Same shit different day just riding through the city looking prettiest as
usual  
Its the same old thing got the name on the chain just to let them know whos
who  
And they know Ive over here so they come and find me right after they lose
you  
For you niggas in the way we can let the guns say excuse you  
At the end of the day we just trying find our way and I might be a come up  
And baby you hitch a ride but u gotta know how to do more than how to keep a
thump up  
Its so incredible that it aint edible but they know the cakes real  
Yo I couldnt even say ask these other silicon niggas how being fake feel  
  
Chorus  
Everyday is my day Ima do it my way everyday  
Everything about me what they love about me everything  
Everywhere that I be feel VIP baby  
And everybodys cool but yall just aint me  
  
Somebody better tell em that we in this bitch like an unborn baby  
See we be everywhere and they aint never there couldnt tell you where they
be  
And you already know you aint gotta ask me you can see that everything is up  
And Im so bout my money you aint talking about no money you aint even gotta
bring it up  
And I hope you dont think me give a sugar honey iced tea or a middle finger
up  
I just stay suckerfree leave the lames where they be and I let my chips
pringle up  
Everybody calm down theres enough to go around you just gotta say how much
you want  
Dont know what youre looking for unless its a problem I promise this
aint what you want  
  
Chorus  
  
Can you do me this favor answer this question yall gon try who  
See the shoes by Gucci bag by Louie the hatingll be by you  
And I appreciate the love thank the man above cause a nigga feel so blessed  
And I aint gonna stop better get them red bulls I dont give these haters
no rest  
  
Chorus
