These ol white lines on the highway  
Lord its all I know  
Seems like Ive been out all my life  
But I just cant let it go  
Oh you know I aint complainin  
  
Cause I can tell lord its just your plan  
So I thank you for what I have  
And thats a song  
All I have is a song  
  
I keep thinkin about the friends Ive had  
And all the meories weve shared  
They keep comin back time and time again  
Sometimes I wonder was it worth the cost  
And all Ive lost  
  
Oh you know I aint complainin  
Cause I can tell lord its just your plan  
So I thank you for what I have  
And thats a song  
All I have is a song  
  
So I play this song one more time cause lord its all I know  
Ill be standin at your door following along  
Cause all I have is a song  
And this song will live on  
  
All I have is a song  
A piece of me to live on
