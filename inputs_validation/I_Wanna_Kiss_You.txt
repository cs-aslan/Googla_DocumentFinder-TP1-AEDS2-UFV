Woke up this morning and I put on my shoes  
Fixed up my hair and then I put on my rouge  
Hopped out my window into your brand new car  
Somethings happening between You and I  
Somethings going on deep down inside  
  
Were going dancing babe all through the night  
My heart is beating cant be wrong it feels right  
I know for sure that it was love at first sight  
Somethings happening between you and I  
Somethings going on deep down inside  
  
I wanna kiss you but Im afraid  
I wanna touch you but Im afraid  
Daddys gonna get mad  
I dont wanna lose you  
I wanna kiss you but Im afraid  
I wanna touch you but Im afraid  
Daddys gonna get mad  
I dont wanna lose you  
  
Last night I dreamed that we were running away  
The same old story and babe the same old game  
But I know honey this time its not the same  
Somethings happening between you and I  
Somethings going on deep down inside  
  
I wanna kiss you but Im afraid  
  
I guess Im too romantic for you babe  
I guess Im too romantic for you babe  
And Id sail across the atlantic for you babe  
Id sail across atlantic for you babe  
  
I wanna kiss you but Im afraid
