In time this fire will turn to ashes  
The sun will fall out the sky  
Still you see no urgency  
To spend some time with me  
Time with me  
  
I cant believe you havent noticed  
Just how long Ive been waitin for you  
Ive been such a patient man  
But I still dont understand  
You wont  
  
Give me a chance to show how much I love you  
Give me a chance to show how much I care  
How I care  
  
Its hard to know just what youre thinkin  
You cloak yourself in mystery  
Conversations always brief  
Like a sigh with no relief  
You wont  
  
Give me a chance to show how much I love you  
Give me a chance to show how much I care  
Give me a chance to show how much I love you  
if you dare  
  
You gotta give me a chance to show how much I love you  
Give me a chance to show how much I care  
Give me a chance to show how much I love you  
Give me a chance
