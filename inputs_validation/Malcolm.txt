Billy solves his problems by calling up his mom  
Heather solves her problems with drugs and Alcohol  
Daniel solves his problems with a doctor and the law  
But Malcolm has his own way and its better than them all  
CHORUS  
Cause Malcolm solves his problems with a chainsaw  
And he never has the same problem twice  
Whether its a bill or a cheque arriving late  
Rancid marble cheese or a steak thats second rate  
Awful TV programs or a broken ELvis plate  
Or his fiancee who dumps him because hes gaining weight  
CHORUS  
Aaaaggghhh Aaaaggghhh  
Problem solved
