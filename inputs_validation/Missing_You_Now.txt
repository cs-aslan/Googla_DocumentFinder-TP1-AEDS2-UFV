I talk to you but its not the same as touchin you  
And every time you whisper my name I want to run to you  
Well be together it wont be long it wont be long  
But it feels like forever and its hard to be strong  
  
Chorus  
Baby cause Im missing you now  
And its drivin me crazy  
How Im needin you baby  
Im missing you now  
Cant wait till Im alone with you  
To show you how Im missing you now  
  
Wishin you were here by my side is all that I can do  
Got my arms around my pillow at night they should be holdin you  
Thought I was stronger how could I know how could I know  
I cant take this much longer  
Its so hard on my soul  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby I just cant wait  
Till I see your face  
Chase away this loneliness inside  
  
When youre close to my heart  
Right here in my arms  
Then and only then  
Will I be satisfied  
Im missing you now  
Well be together it wont be long it wont be long  
But it feels like forever and its hard to be strong  
  
Chorus
