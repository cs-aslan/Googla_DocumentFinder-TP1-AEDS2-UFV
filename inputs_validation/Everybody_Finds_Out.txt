We see no change in sight  
Watching her decline  
She gets on a midnight plane  
Shes done it a thousand times  
  
When love starts out in the darkness  
It doesnt do well in the light  
Affairs of the heart  
That start out in the dark  
Usually stay with the night  
  
I know you dont agree  
Everyday you tell me  
I know you dont agree  
  
I know he loves me  
Everyday he calls me  
He says he adores me  
What can I say  
You cant love him  
You cant have him  
I do have him most of the time  
Anywhere we can  
Anytime we can  
Get away get away  
  
Maybe its just something else  
That you cant tell me  
Maybe its in the way that you  
Look away from me  
  
Its not like any words  
Need to be said  
Well you always know when somethings wrong  
My friend  
  
I know you dont agree  
Everyday you tell me  
I know you dont agree  
  
I know he loves me  
Everyday he calls me  
He says he adores me  
What can I say  
You cant love him  
You cant have him  
I do have him most of the time  
Anywhere we can  
Anytime we can  
Get away get away  
  
I know you dont agree  
Well I know you dont agree  
  
You cant love him  
You cant have him  
I do have him most of the time  
Anywhere we can baby  
Anytime we can  
Get away  
  
We see no change in sight  
Watching her decline  
She gets on a midnight plane  
Shes done it a thousand times  
  
When love starts out in the darkness  
It doesnt do well in the light  
Affairs of the heart  
That start out in the dark  
Usually stay with the night  
  
When nobody sees them  
At least not together  
She rarely goes out  
She spends every day  
Waiting for the day  
  
When everybody finds out  
  
Dont you know dont you know  
  
You cant love him  
You cant have him  
I do have him most of the time  
Anywhere we can  
Anytime we can  
Get away get away
