Here somewhere in the heart of me  
There is still a part of me  
That cares  
  
And Ill Ill still take the best youve got  
Even though Im sure its not  
The best for me  
  
When youre born a lover  
Youre born to suffer  
Like all soul sisters  
And soul brothers  
  
I I can see the danger signs  
They only help to underline  
Your beauty  
  
Im not looking for an easy ride  
True happiness cannot be tried  
So easily  
  
When youre born a lover  
Youre born to suffer  
Like all soul sisters  
And soul brothers  
  
Like all soul sisters  
And soul brothers  
  
You can take your time  
Ill be waiting in line  
You dont even have to give me  
The time of day  
  
When youre born a lover  
Youre born to suffer  
Like all soul sisters  
And soul brothers  
  
Like all soul sisters  
And soul brothers
