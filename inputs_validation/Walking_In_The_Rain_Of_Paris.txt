Oh baby I tell I never say never ce soir ce soir  
I know you deserve what love just can do ce soir ce soir  
And this is the final call for you angel oh angel oh angel  
This is the final call to you  
  
Chorus  
Im not walking in the rain of Paris  
I dont promise  that Ill die for you  
And I never said I want to marry that is true  
But Baby I swear you  
My love is true  
  
Tonight oh I miss you like I miss the sunshine ce soir ce soir  
Babe you and I  
We can fly  
One mile high ce soir ce soir  
Oh dont tell a lie about me my angel oh angel oh angel  
And I wont tell the truth on you
