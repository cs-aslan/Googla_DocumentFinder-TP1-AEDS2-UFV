See the people all in line whats making them look at me  
I cant imagine that their minds are thinking the same like me  
I can hear the grass grow I can hear the grass grow  
I see rainbows in the evening  
  
My heads attracted to a magnetic wave of sound  
With a stream of coloured circles making their way around  
I can hear the grass grow I can hear the grass grow  
I see rainbows in the evening  
  
Cant seem to puzzle out the signs  
My senses form a microline  
So get a hold of yourself now baby  
You see I need you to help now baby  
Get a hold of yourself now baby  
  
Put your head down to the ground and listen to your mind  
If you cant spell what you find Ill know that youre not my kind  
I can hear the grass grow I can hear the grass grow  
I see rainbows in the evening  
  
Cant seem to puzzle out the signs  
My senses form a microline  
So get a hold of yourself now baby  
You see I need you to help now baby  
Get a hold of yourself now baby  
  
See the people all in line whats making them look at me  
I cant imagine that their minds are thinking the same like me  
I can hear the grass grow I can hear the grass grow  
I see rainbows in the evening  
  
I can hear the grass grow I can hear the grass grow  
I see rainbows in the evening  
I can hear the grass grow I can hear the grass grow  
I see rainbows in the evening
