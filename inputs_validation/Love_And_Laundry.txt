Here I go again its another messy morning  
Walk around the clothes that are covering the floor and  
Take my kiss and coffee to go  
Then put on my mascara while Im driving down the road  
I thought that I could do it all  
Turns out I was crazy  
Man I need an iPhone and a cleaning lady  
We havent had a date night in what seems like forever  
It might take a miracle to get myself together  
  
Oh I wish that there were more than  
24 hours in a day  
I havent found it yet but theres gotta be a way  
And I keep praying that  
I can get everything done  
And still have time for love  
And a load of laundry  
  
Id sure like to relax laying in a bubble bath  
But then Id have to clean the tub and really whos got time for that  
There goes my day dream Im just wishful thinking  
Oh shoot Im running late I gotta make it to a meeting  
  
Ive been waiting for this moment all day just you and me  
The lights are low next thing I know  
Were both drifting off to sleep
