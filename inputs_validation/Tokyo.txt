Feels like Ive been away for a thousand years  
So tired of these airports and souvenirs  
I shiver in the night and I think of you  
  
I stroll the boulevards  
I stare up at the stars  
And wish they all aligned  
You keep me on my toes  
And this is how it goes  
You never leave my mind  
  
Are you having fun yet  
Ill send you the sunset  
I love the most when Im in Tokyo  
Ill melt in the moonlight  
and follow the shoreline  
On down the coast when Im in Tokyo  
Oh cant sleep the whole night through  
Ohand Im missing you  
  
Im thinking it out loud  
I wish I could reach out  
And hold you close when Im in Tokyo  
  
I wander all alone in the pouring rain  
Lineshocking on the wind in the bullet train  
I shiver in the night and I think of you  
  
I stroll the boulevards  
I stare up at the stars  
And wish they all aligned  
You keep me on my toes  
And this is how it goes  
You never leave my mind  
  
Are you having fun yet  
Ill send you the sunset  
I love the most when Im in Tokyo  
Ill melt in the moonlight  
and follow the shoreline  
On down the coast when Im in Tokyo  
Oh cant sleep the whole night through  
Oh Im missing you  
  
Im thinking it out loud  
I wish I could reach out  
And hold you close when Im in Tokyo  
I stroll the boulevards  
I stare up at the stars  
And wish they all aligned  
You keep me on my toes  
And this is how it goes  
You never leave my mind  
  
Are you having fun yet  
Ill send you the sunset  
I love the most  
Ill melt in the moonlight  
and follow the shoreline  
On down the coast  
Oh cant sleep the whole night through  
Oh Im missing you  
  
Im thinking it out loud  
I wish I could reach out  
  
And hold you close when Im in Tokyo  
When Im in Tokyo when Im in Tokyo  
When Im in Tokyo when Im in Tokyo  
When Im in Tokyo when Im in Tokyo  
When Im in Tokyo when Im in Tokyo
