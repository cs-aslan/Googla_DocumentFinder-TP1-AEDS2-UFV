I guess it finally dawned on me youre gone  
Well maybe I can make it on my own  
I dont stay up wonderin if youll call  
And some nights I dont dream of you at all  
  
Your memorys still hurtin deep inside  
Thats something Im still learnin how to hide  
Though this heart of mine has lost an ache or two  
Ive only turned a lighter shade of blue  
  
Chorus  
Lookin down the line sometimes  
I think I see a change  
But then I think again and think of you  
Here and there Ive turned a stone  
But the mountain hasnt moved  
Ive only turned a lighter shade of blue  
  
Im still afraid of turning out the light  
And it takes all my strength to face the night  
Cause thats the time I face the bitter truth  
Ive only turned a lighter shade of blue  
  
Chorus
