Oooh  
  
Its hard to remember a time  
When I didnt have you  
Didnt have nothing but a cold bed to come to at night  
That was all I knew  
Until there was you  
  
And then you took my world  
And turned it all around  
I couldnt live without you now  
  
Baby  
If I cant have your love  
If I cant feel your touch  
I got nothin  
Baby  
If I cant taste your kiss  
Then I dont exist  
I got nothin yeah  
  
No I cant imagine livin life without you  
I cant imagine livin life without your love  
  
I wake up with you by my side  
I cant let go  
I cant even bear the thought of you in another mans eyes  
I would lose control  
I would die  
  
Cause now youre in my heart  
And I cant let you out  
I gotta keep you here somehow  
  
Baby  
If I cant have your love  
If I cant feel your touch  
Ive got nothing  
Baby  
If I cant taste your kiss  
Then I dont exist  
I got nothing  
If I cant be your man  
I wouldnt know who I am  
I got nothing I got nothing  
  
whispered  
No I cant imagine living life without you  
I cant imagine living life without your love  
  
Sung  
Cause I cant imagine living live without you  
Cant imagine living life wiouthout your love  
  
Believe me baby I dont mean to doubt you  
But if you ever leave  
That would be the end of me  
Baby Baby  
  
If I cant feel your touch I got nothin  
If I cant taste your kiss then I dont exist  
Then I got nothin  
I got nothin  
  
Baby  
If I cant be your man  
I wouldnt know who I am  
Id be nothing  
Baby  
If I cant have your love  
If I cant feel your touch  
Ive got nothin yeahh  
  
No I cant imagine living life without you  
No I cant imagine living life without your love
