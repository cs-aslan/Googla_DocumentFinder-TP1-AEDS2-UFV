Mission of Burma  
  
Walk into my room  
Ask me jerky questions  
Dont mean what you say  
Immaculate Conception  
Play by the rules  
So close to the chest chest  
Show that alls not lost  
This is not a test  
Stay just as far from me as me from you  
Make sure that you are sure of everything I do  
Cause Im not not not not not not not not  
Your academy  
The halls are like piss  
The rooms are underlit  
Still it must be nice  
Such a perfect fit fit  
Whats that I hear  
The sound of marching feet  
It has a strange alure  
Has a strange alure  
Stay just as far from me as me from you  
Make sure that you are sure of everything I do  
Cause Im not not not not not not not not  
Your academy  
Your academy  
Maybe youre right  
I shouldnt judge  
Whats wrong or right  
Its all too much  
Im not judging you  
Im judging me  
My academy  
Your academy  
My academy  
Your academy
