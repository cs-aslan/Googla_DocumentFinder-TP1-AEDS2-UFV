Come on baby to a drivein show  
I know just the very place to go  
Ill be over pick you up at 8  
This will be our very first date  
  
When were parkin in the drivein show  
Well be sittin in the moonlight row  
Ill bet my peanuts to a candy bar  
Youll be cuter than a movie star  
  
When its over and were headin back  
Well stop in for just a little snack  
Six hot dogs oughtta be just right  
After such a wonderful night
