With a face like a crabs bus ticket  
And skin like a llamas door mat  
He was always gonna struggle  
Nature had seen to that  
  
He dreamt of those oldfashioned movies  
Where Bogart gets the dame  
But a lorry load of Lorre  
Is still the score of pain  
  
And he sings  
I may be ugly  
But Ive got the bottleopener  
He may be fat but hes got the corkscrew  
And in the party party politics of this ugly fame  
There is no orderly queue  
  
With a chin like a tramps jukebox  
And eyes like a rhinos ashtray  
It was always going to be pantomime  
That made him sing and dance anyway  
  
When you feel like London  
And you look like Hull  
You think Travolta pulled Newton John  
Who did John Hurt pull  
  
And they compliment the compliment  
And its driving you insane  
Its like talking to a helicopter  
When you know that youre a plane  
  
Breath like a mountain goats satchel  
Nose like a pool of sick  
But you always leave your flies ahoy  
Cause the world wants to suck your dick  
Let it suck  
  
And he sings  
I may be ugly  
But Ive got the bottleopener  
He may be fat but hes got the corkscrew  
And in the party party politics of this ugly fame  
There is no orderly queue
