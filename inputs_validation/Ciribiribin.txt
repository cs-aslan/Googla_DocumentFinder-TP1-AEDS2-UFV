When the moon hangs low in Napoli theres a handsome gondolier  
Every night he sings so happily so his lady love can hear  
In a manner oh gravissimo he repeats his serenade  
And his heart beats so fortissimo when she raises her Venetian shade  
Ciribiribin chiribiribin ciribiribin  
Ciribiribin he waits for her each night beneath her balcony  
Ciribiribin he begs to hold her tight but no she wont agree  
Ciribiribin she throws a rose and blows a kiss from up above  
Ciribiribin ciribiribin ciribiribin theyre so in love  
musical interlude  
Ciribiribin ciribiribin ciribiribin theyre so in love
