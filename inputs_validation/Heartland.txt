Theres a home place under fire tonight in the heartland  
And the bankers are taking my home and my land from me  
Theres a big achin hole in my chest now where my heart was  
And a hole in the sky where God used to be  
Theres a home place under fire tonight in the heartland  
Theres a well where the waters so bitter nobody can drink  
Aint no way to get high and my mouth is so dry that I cant speak  
Dont they know that Im dyin whys nobody cryin for me  
My American dream fell apart at the seams  
You tell me what it means you tell me what it means  
  
Theres a home place under fire tonight in a heartland  
And bankers are taking the homes and the land away  
Theres a young boy closin his eyes tonight in a heartland  
Who will wake up a man with some land and a loan he cant pay  
His American dream fell apart at the seams  
You tell me what it means you tell me what it means  
My American dream  
Theres a home place under fire tonight in the heartland  
Theres a home place under fire tonight in the heartland  
Theres a home place under fire tonight in the heartland  
Theres a home place under fire tonight in the heartland
