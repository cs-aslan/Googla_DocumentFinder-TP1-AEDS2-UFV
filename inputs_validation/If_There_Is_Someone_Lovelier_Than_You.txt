If there is someone lovelier than you  
Then I am blind a man without a mind  
If there is someone lovelier than you  
  
But no Im not blind my eyes have traveled everywhere  
In hopes that I might find a creature half so fair  
If there is someone lovelier than you  
By all thats beautiful such beauty cant be true  
  
If there is someone lovelier than you  
By all thats beautiful such beauty cant be true
