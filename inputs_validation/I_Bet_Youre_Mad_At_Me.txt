Dont justify  
For what you are  
And where youve been  
For who you are tonight  
So lonesome tonight  
  
Make believe  
Just hanging on  
Youre crazy  
Thats who are you tonight  
All over tonight  
  
Tell the world  
Youre still afraid  
Been on this road too long  
  
Falling soft  
But raining hard  
So wrap up well  
Its freezing cold tonight  
So cold tonight  
  
Tell me all  
I need to know  
Ill spare your fears  
So sad to see tonight  
The tears you cry tonight  
  
I stayed away  
A long time now  
But Ill be home tonight  
  
I bet youre mad at me  
Cant you read my lips  
I see your eyes of blue  
What you want from me  
Its not the way it should be  
Youve got the world to give  
I gave you all my love  
But youre mad at me  
  
Tonight  
All over tonight  
  
Tell the world  
Youre still afraid  
Been on this road too long  
  
I bet youre mad at me  
Cant you read my lips  
I see your eyes of blue  
What you want from me  
Its not the way it should be  
Youve got the world to give  
I gave you all my love  
But youre mad at me  
  
I bet youre mad at me  
Cant you read my lips  
I see your eyes of blue  
What you want from me  
Its not the way it should be  
Youve got the world to give  
I gave you all my love  
But youre mad at me  
  
I bet youre mad at me  
Cant you read my lips  
I see your eyes of blue  
What you want from me  
Its not the way it should be  
Youve got the world to give  
I gave you all my love  
But youre mad at me  
  
I bet youre mad at me  
Cant you read my lips  
I see your eyes of blue  
What you want from me  
Its not the way it should be  
Youve got the world to give  
I gave you all my love  
But youre mad at me
