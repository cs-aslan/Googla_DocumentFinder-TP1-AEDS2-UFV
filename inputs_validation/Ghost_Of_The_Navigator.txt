I have sailed to many lands now I make my final journey  
On the bow I stand west is where I go  
Through the night I plough still my heart calculate and pray  
As the compass swings my will is strong I will not be led astray  
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun  
But I know but I know but I know  
  
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost  
As they sail into the sunset theyll count the cost  
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea  
The sirens of the rocks they beckon me  
  
Take my heart and set it free carried forward by the waves  
Nowhere left to run navigators son  
Chasing rainbows all my days  
  
Where I go I do not know I only know the place Ive been  
Dreams they come and go ever shall be so  
Nothings real until you feel  
  
I steer between the crashing rocks the sirens call my name  
Lash my hands onto the helm blood surging with the strain  
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind  
For eternity I follow on there is no other way  
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun  
But I know I know  
  
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost  
As they sail into the sunset theyll count the cost  
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea  
The sirens of the rocks they beckon me  
  
Take my heart and set it free carried forward by the waves  
Nowhere left to run Navigators son  
Chasing rainbows all my days  
  
Where I go I do not know I only know the place Ive been  
Dreams they come and go ever shall be so  
Nothings real until you feel  
  
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost  
As they sail into the sunset theyll count the cost  
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea  
The sirens of the rocks they beckon me  
  
Take my heart and set it free carried forward by the waves  
Nowhere left to run Navigators son  
Chasing rainbows all my days  
  
Where I go I do not know I only know the place Ive been  
Dreams they come and go ever shall be so  
Nothings real until you feel
