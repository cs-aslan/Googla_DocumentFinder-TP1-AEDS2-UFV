Oh deep in the night I am waiting sent from above power of love in my hand  
And I know what you want I know what you need and I know what you feel  
Lose all your fears and live out your dreams

Passion and fire lust and desire exciter  
Pleasure and pain this is my name exciter  
  
Oh heaven is yours for the taking power of love sent from above in your
hand  
And Ill give you more than ever before so take all you need  
When you open your arms open your eyes Im the one whos gonna make you see  
  
Chorus  
Passion and fire lust and desire exciter  
Pleasure and pain whisper my name exciter  
Surrender to me and Ill guarantee youll pray that the night never ends  
Come play the game this is my name exciter  
  
And Ill show you a world where youve never been its time that you knew  
Theres no time for waiting its time to begin Im the ones gonna take you
