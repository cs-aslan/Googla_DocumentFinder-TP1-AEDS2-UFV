Yo I aint seeing you in a minute but I got something to tell ya listen  
  
See the thing about you that caught my eye  
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind  
Kinda hard to explain but girl Ill try  
You need to sit down this may take a while  
You see she sorta looks just like you  
She even smiles just the way you do  
So innocent she seemed but I was schooled  
Im reminded when I look at you but  
  
You remind of a girl that I once knew  
See her face whenever I I look at you  
You wont believe all of the things that she put me through  
This is why I just cant get with you  
  
Thought that she was the one for me  
Til I found out she was on her dream  
Oh she was sexing everyone but me  
This is why we could never be  
  
You remind of a girl that I once knew  
See her face whenever I I look at you  
You wont believe all of the things that she put me through  
This is why I just cant get with you  
  
I know its so unfair to you  
But Id be lingering the rest to you  
Wish I knew wish I knew how to separate the two  
You remind me whoa  
  
You remind of a girl that I once knew  
See her face whenever I I look at you  
You wont believe all of the things that she put me through  
This is why I just cant get with you  
  
You remind of a girl that I once knew  
See her face whenever I I look at you  
You wont believe all of the things that she put me through  
This is why I just cant get with you
