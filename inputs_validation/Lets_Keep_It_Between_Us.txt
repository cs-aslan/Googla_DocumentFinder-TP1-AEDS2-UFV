Lets keep it between us  
These people meddling in our affairs  
Theyre not our friends  
Lets keep it between us  
Before the whole door closes  
And it comes to an end  
Theyll tell you one thing me another  
Till we dont know who to trust  
Ohh darlin can we keep it between us  
Lets keep it between us  
Weve been through too much together  
That theyll never share  
Theyve had nothing to say to us before  
Now all of a sudden its as if  
Theyve always cared  
All we need is honesty  
A little humility and trust  
Ohh darlin can we keep it between us  
I know were not perfect then again so what  
That aint no reason to treat you like a snake  
Or to treat me like a slut  
And its makin me so angry  
Could we just lay back for a moment  
Before we wake up and find ourselves  
In a game that we both have lost  
These easy cures and easy handsomes  
Somethin tells me we cant afford the cost  
Cause some things not fit for human ears  
Some things dont need to be discussed  
Ohh darlin can we keep it between us  
Theyll tell you one thing me another  
Till we dont know who to trust  
Ohh darlin lets keep it between us  
Lets keep it between us  
Before the whole thing breaks down  
And goes too far  
If we cant settle our differences by ourselves  
Then we must be worse off  
Than they think we are  
Back seat drivers dont know the feel of the wheel  
But they sure know how to make a fuss  
Ohh darlin can we keep it between us  
Can we keep it between us
