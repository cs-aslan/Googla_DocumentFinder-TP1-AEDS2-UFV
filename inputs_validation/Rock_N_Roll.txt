Let them know that were still rock n roll  
I dont care about my makeup  
I like it better with my jeans all ripped out  
Dont know how to keep my mouth shut  
You say so what  
What  
  
I dont care if Im misfit  
I like it better then the hipster of all shit  
I am the mother fucking princess  
You still love me  
  
Some some how  
Its a little different when  
Im with you  
You know what I really am  
On the phone  
You know how it really goes  
Oh oh oh oh yeh  
  
Some some way  
Well be getting out of this  
Time one day  
Youre the only one that I  
Want with me  
You know how the story goes  
Oh oh oh  
  
When its you and me  
We dont need no one to tell us who to be  
Well keep turning up the radio  
Well its you and I  
Just put up  
A middle finger to the sky  
That them know that were still rock n roll  
  
Rock n roll  
Hey hey hey  
Rock n roll  
Hey hey hey
