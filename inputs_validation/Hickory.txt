Someday baby well leave this town  
For a little house and counrty scene  
But right now my love  
Its gonna take some time  
Saving our nickels  
Counting all our dimes  
Then hickory glows cause hickory knows  
With each song she sings him  
A new day she brings him  
He says hickory when your singing the blues  
This downtown guy feels like uptown new  
Something in your voice sounded soothing and clear  
Like magic this old ghetto seems to disappear  
There across town in a brown stone cellar  
Theres a bit of heaven singin  
Every night a song keeps bringin  
Crowds of people by the score  
Hickorys heart must be made of sunshine  
Singing songs of sweet salvation  
Brings back inspiration  
Keeps them coming back for more  
They sing hickory when your singing the blues  
This downtown street feels like uptown new  
Something in your voice sounded soothing and clear  
Like magic this old ghetto seems to disappear  
Hickory got a guy she lives for  
He drives taxi downtown city  
That job of his is dirt and gritty  
Nough to make a big man cry  
Countin his coin till makes a dollar  
To pay the rent for where theyre sleepin  
Shes always at the door to greet him  
Sayin theyll make it by and by  
Hickory when your singin the blues  
This downtown guy feels like uptown new  
Something in your voice sounded soothing and clear  
Like magic this old ghetto seems to disappear  
Hickory hickory hickorrryyyyy  
Hickory hickory
