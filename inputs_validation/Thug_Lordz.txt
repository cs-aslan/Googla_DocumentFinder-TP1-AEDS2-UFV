Check my uzi weigh a ton I hits em up an I run

Cause Im a nut an keep a SmifNWesson pressed in pause  
All these faggot ass rappers keep yappin they jaws  
Yeah they the shit cause when they see me they just crap in they drawers  
Yeah that nigga 50 he hot but I heard hes a snitch  
And he ran up under that white boy I heard hes a bitch  
An I aint seen him in the hood no where in the Valley  
No House of Blues or Peanuts he scared of them alleys  
Heard he copped his rims and Big O tires in the hood  
Surrounded by police wearin wires in the hood  
Heard they ran him outta New York and hes comin to Cali  
No glocks and cigs just lots of pigs  
Eh nig your rap career will not outlast Pac and Bigs
