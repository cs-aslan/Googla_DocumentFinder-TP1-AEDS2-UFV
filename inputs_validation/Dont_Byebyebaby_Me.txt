Well honeyhoney please dont go  
Dont you know I love you so  
How can our love grow  
If you byebyebaby me  
Well honeyhoney say youll stay  
Please dont ever go away  
Each night I drag the day  
That you byebyebaby me  
  
I gotta rattle my bones  
Cause Im a rollin stone  
Im always movin around  
As the weeks go by I feel like I  
Oughta get out of this town  
Well my baby packs my suitcase  
And comes down to the train  
With a tear in her eye she breathes a sigh  
And I can hear my baby say  
Well she says honeyhoney please dont go  
  
Sittin on that choochoo train  
Sing a little rockin rhyme  
I visualize my baby  
I can almost hear her cry  
I try hard not to listen turn my head away  
But each chugchug of the choochoo train  
I can hear my baby say  
Well she said ahoneyhoney please dont go  
Honey I love you so  
How can our love grow  
If you byebyebaby me
