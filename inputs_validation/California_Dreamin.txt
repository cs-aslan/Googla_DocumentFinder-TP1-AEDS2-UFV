All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray  
Away for a walk on a winters day  
Id be so safe and warm if I was in LA  
California dreamin on such a winters day  
I stopped into a church yes I did that I passed along the way  
And I got down on my knees down on my knees  
And I pretended to pray you know the preacher he likes it cold  
Coz he knows Im gonna stay as he knows Im gonna stay  
California dreamin on such a winters day oh yeah  
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray  
Ive been for a walk on a cold winters day yeah  
Id be so safe and warm if I was in LA  
California dreamin on such a winters day  
On such a winters day on such a winters day  
California California dreamin California dreamin  
Play that for me  
I know its just a dream dream of California dreamin
