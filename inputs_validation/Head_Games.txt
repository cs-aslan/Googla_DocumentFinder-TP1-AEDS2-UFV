Day light alright I dont know I dont know if its real  
Been a long night and something aint right  
You wont show you wont show how you feel  
No time ever seems right to talk about the reasons why you and I fight  
Its high time to draw the line put an end to this game before its too late  
Head games its you and me baby  
Head games and I cant take it anymore  
Head games I dont want to play the head games  
A daydream for hours it seems I keep thinking of you yeah thinking of you  
These daydreams what do they mean They keep haunting me are they warning me  
Daylight turns into night  
We try and find the answer but its nowhere in sight  
Its always the same and you know whos to blame  
You know what Im saying still we keep on playing  
Head games thats all I get from you  
Head games and I cant take it anymore  
Head games dont want to play the head games  
  
So near yet so far away we pass each other by cause we dont know what to
say  
Its so clear Im sorry to say  
But if you want to win you gotta learn how to play  
Head games always you and me baby  
Head games till I cant take it anymore  
Head games instead of making love  
Head games oh  
Head games always you and me baby  
Head games till I cant take it anymore no more  
Head games instead of making love we play  
Head games  
Head games in the first degree  
Head games yeah always you and me  
Head games why do you do it baby  
Head games
