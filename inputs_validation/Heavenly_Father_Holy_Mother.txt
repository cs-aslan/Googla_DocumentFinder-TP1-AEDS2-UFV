If grandpa was alive right now there aint no tellin what hed have to say  
Why he had fifteen wives a living with him all when he finally passed away  
And though Ive just got two now mama thats enough to keep me satisfied  
I havent had a son yet but the good Lord knows the three of us have tried  
Cause the Pennsylvania Dutch that we once spoke has been forgotten  
And the Mormon way of life is almost gone  
But now and then we gather down in Salt Lake City to raise our voices in a
joyful song  
And we sing Heavenly Father Holy Mother keeper of our children tiller of the
land  
Take us to the river in a horse and buggy  
Give us our salvation help us make our stand  
  
No maam I did not go to see the Reverend Brigham Young while I was there  
But Im sure glad to know you wanted him to mention my name in a prayer  
I hope he did not preach about the young folks that refused to make the change  
Cause if he did Im sure I got a little more than my share of the blame  
Cause the Pennsylvania Dutch  
Heavenly Father Holy Mother  
Heavenly Father Holy Mother  
Heavenly Father Holy Mother  
Heavenly Father Holy Mother
