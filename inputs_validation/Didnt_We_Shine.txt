Hello its good to see you  
Just how long has it been  
Ive often wondered what Id say  
If we ever met again  
If Id try just being clever  
Or pretend not to remember  
But its funny how youve lingered  
On my mind  
  
Chorus  
Didnt we shine  
Didnt we shine  
Didnt we share and care  
And lay our hearts on the line  
Maybe it wasnt meant to last  
Till the end of time  
Oh but while it did  
Didnt we shine  
  
I still have some blue days  
That I could do without  
And when I have my blue days  
Youre all I think about  
But Ive long ago forgiven you  
For what you did or didnt do  
Now all I can recall  
Are the happy times  
  
Chorus  
  
Was it my imagination  
Or didnt we shine
