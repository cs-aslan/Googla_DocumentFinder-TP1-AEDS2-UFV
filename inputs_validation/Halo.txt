Lets just cut it down the middle  
Let it bleed and bleed out  
Ill clean up the mess baby  
You stand there and shout cry cry  
Baby I cant hold us together  
  
Paint me in a corner  
Cover me with rage  
Ill take it like a circus lion  
Silent in my cage cry cry  
Baby I cant change the weather  
  
Baby Ill let go when you say so  
Try to let your heart fly free  
Ill crawl out of my cradle  
Down in to my black hole  
And you just lay low  
Under your halo  
  
Ill slip into the back room  
Fall onto your cast  
Almost out of focus  
Like a faded photograph cry cry  
Baby Im all out of answers  
  
Baby Ill let go when you say so  
Try to let your heart fly free  
Ill crawl out of my cradle  
Down in to my black hole  
And you just lay low  
Under your halo  
  
Baby Ill let go when you say so  
Try to let your heart fly free  
Ill crawl out of my cradle  
Down in to my black hole  
And you just lay low  
Under your halo  
  
Bab you just lay low  
Under your halo
