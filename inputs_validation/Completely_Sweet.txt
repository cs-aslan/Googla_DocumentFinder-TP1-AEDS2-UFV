Well completely sweet thats my baby  
Completely sweet I dont mean maybe  
Well completely sweet thats my baby  
Completely sweet I dont mean maybe  
And I love her more n more each day  
Shes so completely sweet  
  
Well ajust like ahoney that the bees bring in  
Mmm ajust like a honey that the bees bring in  
Mmm I get my sugar when I kiss her on the chin  
  
Well the sugar in my coffee well the sugar in my tea  
Well the sugar in my coffee mmm the sugar in my tea  
Mmm they both taste better with a sugar on my knee
