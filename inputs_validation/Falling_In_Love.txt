Falling keep on falling  
Keep on falling love  
  
Now I dont mind  
All this running around  
Seems Ive been doing it  
Most of my life  
My musics been kind  
But some days I find  
It brings me two kinds of trouble  
And three kinds of strife  
  
So dont try to compare it  
cause I just want to  
Share it with some people  
I like to call friends  
There aint nothing bad and  
No need to feel sad  
And theres certainly no need  
To make amends  
  
It wont do you no harm and  
Theres no cause for alarm  
I wont be praying for  
Help from above  
If the only thing  
Wrong with rock and roll  
Is that I keep on falling in love  
  
If the only thing  
Wrong with rock and roll  
Is that I keep on falling  
Keep on falling  
Keep on falling in love
