Sing me to sleep  
Sing me to sleep  
Im tired and I  
I want to go to bed  
  
Sing me to sleep  
Sing me to sleep  
And then leave me alone  
Dont try to wake me in the morning  
Cause I will be gone  
Dont feel bad for me  
I want you to know  
Deep in the cell of my heart  
I will feel so glad to go  
  
Sing me to sleep  
Sing me to sleep  
I dont want to wake up  
On my own anymore  
  
Sing to me  
Sing to me  
I dont want to wake up  
On my own anymore  
  
Dont feel bad for me  
I want you to know  
Deep in the cell of my heart  
I really want to go  
  
There is another world  
There is a better world  
Well there must be  
Well there must be  
Well there must be  
Well there must be  
Well  
  
Bye bye  
Bye bye  
Bye
