Im at a payphone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone baby its all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two  
  
Yeah I I know its hard to remember  
The people we used to be  
Its even harder to picture  
That youre not here next to me  
  
You say its too late to make it  
But is it too late to try  
And in our time that you wasted  
All of our bridges burned down  
  
Ive wasted my nights  
You turned out the lights  
Now Im paralyzed  
Still stuck in that time  
When we called it love  
But even the sun sets in paradise  
  
Im at a payphone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone baby its all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two  
  
If Happy Ever Afters did exist  
I would still be holding you like this  
All those fairy tales are full of shit  
One more fucking love song  Ill be sick  
  
Oh you turned your back on tomorrow  
Cause you forgot yesterday  
I gave you my love to borrow  
But you just gave it away  
  
You cant expect me to be fine  
I dont expect you to care  
I know Ive said it before  
But all of our bridges burned down  
  
Ive wasted my nights  
You turned out the lights  
Now Im paralyzed  
Still stuck in that time  
When we called it love  
But even the sun sets in paradise  
  
Im at a payphone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone baby its all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two  
  
If Happy Ever Afters did exist  
I would still be holding you like this  
All those fairy tales are full of shit  
One more fucking love song Ill be sick  
Now Im at a payphone  
  
Man fuck that shit  
Ill be out spending all this money  
While youre sitting round wondering  
Why it wasnt you who came up from nothing  
Made it from the bottom  
Now when you see me Im stunting  
And all of my cars start with a push of a button  
  
Telling me the chances I blew up  
Or whatever you call it  
Switch the number to my phone  
So you never could call it  
Dont need my name on my show  
You can tell it Im ballin  
  
Swish what a shame could have got picked  
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot  
So you talk about who you see at the top  
Or what you could have saw but sad to say its over for  
Phantom pulled up valet open doors  
Wiz like go away got what you was looking for  
Now its me who they want so you can go and take  
that little piece of shit with you  
  
Im at a payphone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone baby its all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two  
  
If Happy Ever Afters did exist  
I would still be holding you like this  
All those fairy tales are full of shit  
One more fucking love song Ill be sick  
Now Im at a payphone
