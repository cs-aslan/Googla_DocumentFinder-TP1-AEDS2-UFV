Hey this bottles empty you got 2 bucks  
Cmon well buy a bottle  
Alright Im headin to the store and Im gonna buy smokes  
Hot damn  
  
Every night I go out and get in my car oh yeah  
I push on the peddle but you know I go too far  
Therere parties everywhere that I can see  
Usin myself will be the death of me  
Ya see every night I get a call on the telephone  
My sweet little baby beggin me just to come home  
But I know that everyday I gotta have me some fun  
With Suzy to the left and Sally to my right  
I know that I need just more than one  
  
Chorus  
  
Said its too much too fast  
I dont care if I wont last  
Said its too much too soon  
I dont care get outta my room  
Said its too much too fast  
I dont care if I wont last  
Said its too much too soon  
I dont care get outta my room  
  
Lets go  
  
When the night goes on and I seem to see some friends  
Now a buck for the car for the gas goes so fast  
With friends like that tell me whos gonna last  
Well the citys hot but tonight Im not  
I want everything that everybodys got  
Not a badge in the pan or a legend hand  
Just give me one more one last dance  
  
Said its too much too fast  
I dont care if I wont last  
Said its too much too soon  
I dont care get outta my room  
Said its too much too fast  
I dont care if I wont last  
Said its too much too soon  
I dont care get outta my room  
  
Lets go  
  
Take the car take the keys  
Said my money dont grow on trees  
You make me stumble and fall  
Till Im bloody at my knees  
I climbed back up to find that all my moneys gone  
Too much too soon not know since its been so long  
You can drive me to the edge but I really dont mind  
Ya see when Im in my car I leave you behind  
Theres another girl thats waitin down the road  
When Im out the door you know thats just where Ill go  
  
Said its too much too fast  
I dont care if I wont last  
Said its too much too soon  
I dont care get outta my room  
Said its too much too fast  
I dont care if I wont last  
Said its too much too soon  
I dont care get outta my room  
  
Said its too much too fast  
I dont care if I wont last  
Said its too much too soon  
I dont care get outta my room  
Said its too much too fast  
I dont care if I wont last  
Said its too much too soon  
I dont care get outta my room  
  
Said its too much too fast  
I dont care if I wont last  
Said its too much too soon  
I dont care get outta my room  
Said its too much too fast  
I dont care if I wont last  
Said its too much too soon  
I dont care get outta my room  
  
Said its too much too fast  
I dont care if I wont last  
Said its too much too soon  
I dont care get outta my room  
Said its too much too fast  
I dont care if I wont last  
Said its too much too soon  
I dont care get outta my room
