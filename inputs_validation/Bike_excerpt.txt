Ive got a bike you can ride if you like  
Its got a basket a bell that rings  
And things to make it look good  
Id give it to you if I could  
But I borrowed it  
Youre the kind of girl  
That fits in with my world  
Ill give you anything everything  
If you want a thing  
Ive got a cloak its a bit of a joke  
Theres a tear up the front its red and black  
Ive had it for months  
If you think it could look good  
Then I guess it should  
I know a mouse and he hasnt got a house  
I dont know why I call him Gerald  
Hes getting rather old but hes a good mouse  
Ive got a clan of gingerbread men  
Here a man there a man lots of gingerbread men  
Take a couple if you wish theyre on the dish  
I know a room of musical tunes  
Some wine some gin most of them are clock work  
Lets go into the other room and make them work
