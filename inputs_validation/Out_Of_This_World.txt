Take stock of your life  
Whats wrong and whats right  
Empty pockets got no green  
Dont you know sunshine is free  
What breaks have you had  
Some good and some bad  
Want to go but got no car  
Dreaming dreams can take you far  
  
Chorus  
You will find that lifes worth living  
In this world its out of this world  
With a little love and a little giving  
In this world its out of this world  
  
Look to the future  
Whos in the picture  
Say your love lifes just a dream  
Still youve got a friend in me  
  
Today tomorrow  
Laughter and sorrow  
Gonna be some lows and highs  
Might as well enjoy the ride  
  
Chorus
