Early in the morning before the daylight  
I hear the sound of thunder comin through in the night  
I lie awake and I wonder  where my life is goin  
Am I on a road leadin nowhere theres no way of knowin  
Cause Ive seen the lightning  
And Im ready for the rain to fall  
  
Now Im standin on a mountain lookin into the sky  
I see the clouds come rollin in water fills my eyes  
I dont know whats in the future no one can say  
Dont want to think about the past Ive gotta live for today  
Cause Ive seen the lightnin now  
I need to find my own way while Ive still got time  
  
And Im ready for the rain to fall  
Cause Ive heard the thunder  
And Im ready for the rain to fall  
Im ready ready for the rain  
Ive got to rise above it all  
And get ready for the rain to fall  
  
Did you ever know someone who had lost their way  
Built their own little kingdom and just blew it all away  
Im not ashamed to admit it that someone was me  
Im gonna look to the future now cause Ive set myself free  
And Ive seen the lightnin  
Im gonna set myself free while Ive still got time  
  
Get ready for the rain to fall  
Cause Ive heard the thunder  
And Im ready for the rain to fall  
Im ready ready for the rain  
Ive got to rise above it all  
And get ready for the rain to fall while Ive still got time  
Repeat chorus
