Sittin in a Hong Kong bar  
Sweet dreams of you darling  
Ah when we were sweet sixteen  
Mama makin love in the belly of an old freight train  
Life was so simple and easy  
Oh the sun went down  
You took care of the children darlin  
Then you felt like movin away  
Lord now you didnt stand and stare  
You felt like movin and leavin darlin  
Didnt I treat you fair  
Its all right now darlin  
Its alright now darlin
