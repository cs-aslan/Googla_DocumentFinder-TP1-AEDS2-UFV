Lady picture show she hides behind the bedroom door  
Lady picture show she hides behind the bedroom wall  
She hides because she dont know nothin dont know nothin anymore  
She keeps a funny face its locked and bagged its just outside the door  
  
She doesnt know her name  
She doesnt know her face

She doesnt know her face

She doesnt know her face

She doesnt know her name  
She doesnt know her face
