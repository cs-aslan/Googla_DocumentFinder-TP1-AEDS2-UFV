Momma I just killed a man  
My body still trembling can you feel my hand  
Dont shed no tears it wont be long before they find out it was me momma  
This may be the last time you see me free ma  
Dont spend it cryin  
You did your best me I was blessed know you were stressed tryin  
To keep me out the streets me ducking police  
Tryin not to make a peek to wake you up out your sleep  
A drunk and high fool  
Skip a class fluncking high school  
I know you taught me better somehow I never learned  
Said I was playing with fire somehoe I never burned  
You tried to set me straight somehow I never permed  
You tried to show me right but somehow I never turned  
Lost in a cloud of marijuana are you sane dummy  
Dry your face mommy your not to blame for me  
See Im a man I gotta take whatever came for me  
At times I wonder bout my father  
Would it change for me if he was around  
Would I still be running round with the lowlifes  
Bum ass nggas no jobs no life  
Seen them nggas killed for no price  
I watched his life flash before his eyes like a strobe light  
I pulled the trigger momma  
Tryna be hard I aint mean to kill the ngga momma  
But whats done is done  
Im on the run I live my life like a movie now its way too realer  
Who woulda thought your baby boy woulda grew up to be a killer  
  
Yeh now Im a killer  
Guess Im a killer  
They got me in here with the killers  
Yeah I mean the killers  
  
I wonder whats in store for me  
Lately been stressing pray for blessings hope that theres more for me  
Than just a simple life  
Nggas that I used to hoop with is doing triple life  
Gave up the jump shot  
Work on the john shot  
Who woulda thought I used to block this nggas lay ups  
Now hes in a cell layed up  
I wish you well stay up  
Like insomniacs  
This life can make a ngga fold like a laundry mat  
I sip this cognac though to ease my brain from all this pain  
And so that I react slow in this fast world  
Slow nggas fast girls  
Hoes give up ass while these ho nggas hold triggers  
Blast on em  
Hold up that old checker flag for em  
Chalk lines by the do not park sign  
Its deep all these cold hearted nggas holding heat  
Id rather blast before they steal a ngga  
Tell em now boy dont make me turn into a killer  
  
Yeah into a killer  
Dont make me turn into a killer  
Yeah to a killer yeh yeh  
  
To those who had love for me in the past  
Who woulda thought time would fly by so fast  
I remember back in class we used to make believe  
Like it was draft day  
Swore that we would make the league be rich  
Saturday morning had to rake the leaves awww shit  
Watch how they pile up  
Seem like a mile up  
I was the blisters on my hand than I dial up my best friend  
Skating ring is where we headed tonight  
And if a ngga disrespect yes we ready to fight  
In retrospect that shit seemed petty  
At the time the shit was heavy  
Cause life was all about your name  
You had to scrap with any ngga that would call you lame  
Ashamed no doubt so many nggas go they brains blown out  
Snatched a ngga chain and he got his name rolled out in obituaries  
Another body in a cemetary  
Another young ngga in the penetentiary  
And he dont give a fck no missionary  
Rap visionary paint a picture ngga pictionary  
Tell you what it is Im a dictionary  
I knew a ngga that threw his dck in every chick in every city that he went
to  
Went hard like the rent do  
Till he met the wrong bitch man just came home exconvict  
And he stay on with that thriller  
Shit fcking around with them killers  
  
Yeah with them killers  
Fcking around with them killers  
Say Im a killer
