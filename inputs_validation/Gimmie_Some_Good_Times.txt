Hey if that aint the rocknroll animal himself what you doing bro  
Standing on the corner  
Well I can see that what you got in your hand  
Suitcase in my hand  
No shit whats this  
Jack is in his corset Jane is in her vest  
Fucking faggot Johnson  
Jack sweet Jane Im in a rocknroll band  
Well I can see that  
  
Some people say that you cant  no no no  
No matter how good you are  
And some people say they cant move  no no no  
No matter where they are  
  
Gimmie gimmie gimmie some good times  
Gimmie gimmie gimmie some pain  
No matter how ugly you are  
You know to me it all looks the same  
  
Rain from the morning in the blue clouds  
Now just shining up with dew  
Riding through the city in their big cars  
And me I aint got nothing to do  
  
Gimmie gimmie gimmie some good times  
Gimmie gimmie gimmie some pain  
Dont you know things always look ugly  
To me they always look the same  
  
Oh gimmie gimmie gimmie some good times  
Oh Gimmie gimmie gimmie some pain  
Dont you know that most things look ugly  
To me they always look the same  
  
Oh dont you know hey dont you know  
To me they always look the same  
Oh dont you know hey dont you know  
To me they always look the same  
Oh dont you know hey dont you know  
To me they always look the same  
Oh dont you know hey dont you know  
To me they always look the same
