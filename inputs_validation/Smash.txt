Head over heals Ive fit in before  
Now I dont want to do it no more  
Ive held it all in with blood on my face  
Built it up man so bad you can taste  
  
I dont slag no one  
I dont even judge  
Dont give a shit cause Im not gonna budge  
I just want to be who I want to be  
  
Guess thats hard for others to see  
Im not a trendy asshole  
I do what I want  
I do what I feel like  
  
Im not a trendy asshole  
I dont fuck if its good enough for you  
Cause Im alive  
Smash is the way you feel all alone  
  
Like an outcast youre out on your own  
Smash is the way you deal with your life  
Like an outcast youre smashing your strife  
Head over heals Ive fit in before  
  
Now I dont want to do it no more  
I just want to be who I want to be  
Guess thats hard for others to see
