You should have been there when I came through  
Church was on fire and the Holy Ghost too  
From the top of my head to the sole of my feet  
I felt the Spirit moving all over me  
  
Ive got the River Of Living Water  
Ive got the River Of Living Water  
Ive got the River Of Living Water  
Ive got the River Of Living Water  
  
If you dont believe Ive been redeemed  
Follow me down to the Jordan stream  
I stepped in the water the water was cold  
It chilled my body but not my soul  
  
Ive got the River Of Living Water  
Ive got the River Of Living Water  
Ive got the River Of Living Water  
Ive got the River Of Living Water
