Chorus  
Summertime and the livins easy  
Bradleys on the microphone with Ras MG  
All the people in the dance will agree  
That were well qualified to represent the LBC  
Me and me and Louie run to the party  
Dance to the rhythm it gets harder  
  
Me and my girl got this relationship  
I love her so bad but she treats me like shit  
On lock down like a penitentiary  
She spreads her loving all over and when she comes home  
Theres none left for me  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh take this veil from off my eyes  
A burning sun will someday rise  
What am I gonna be doing for a wife  
Said Im gonna play with myself  
Show them how we come off the shelf  
  
Chorus  
  
Evil  
Ive come to tell you that shes evil  
Most definitely  
Evil  
Ornery scandalous and evil  
Most definitely  
  
The tension is getting hotter  
Id like to hold her head underwater  
  
Me and my girl  
Got a relationship  
  
Me and my girl  
Weve got a relationship  
  
My girl got a relationship  
Oh and my girl  
  
Take a tip take a tip take a ttttttiiup  
  
Chorus
