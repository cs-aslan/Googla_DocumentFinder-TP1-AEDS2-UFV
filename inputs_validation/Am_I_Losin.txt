I recall when I used to come home never had a dime  
But Lord I always had a good time  
And I recall drinkin wine with one of my friends  
Lord I cant go back again  
  
Chorus  
Am I losin my own way back home  
Am I losin a good friend that Ive known  
Am I losin wont you tell me how Ive sinned  
Why am I losin one of my bets friends  
  
And I recall this friend of mine I knew so well  
It goes to show Lord you just cant tell  
Now my friend wont talk to me Let me tell you why  
He thinks I ve changed because of a dollar sign  
  
Chorus  
  
And its so strange when you get just a little money  
Your so called friends want to act just a little funny  
Theyll blame you  
  
But Im not the one thats here to blame  
Its you my friend thats really changed  
Its a shame such a shame  
Am I losin once again  
  
Why these things happen Lord I dont understand  
But Lord it can sure hurt a man  
Why my friend wont take me as I am  
Cause your friend Lord is the most important thing  
  
Chorus
