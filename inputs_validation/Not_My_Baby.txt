There are guys who will lie  
Then theyll hang you out to dry  
But not my baby  
Promise you everything  
Then they never buy the ring  
But not my baby  
Say theyre out with their pals  
When theyre seein other gals  
But not my baby  
  
And they think its a crime  
When they have to spend a dime  
But not my baby  
Bring you gifts now and then  
Always from the five and ten  
But not my baby  
And Ive heard stories of  
Guys afraid to fall in love  
But not my baby  
  
I dont have to dream  
My dream baby  
Hes the sweetest dream  
Thats already come true  
And every time we touch just touch  
I can feel how very much  
How much he loves me  
Not my baby  
No not my baby  
  
There are guys that Ive seen  
Who are wrong or being mean  
But not my baby  
Getting mad getting cross  
If you dont let them be boss  
But not my baby  
  
Yes Ive sure got a lot  
And the best thing that Ive got  
Ive got my baby  
And I know he will stay  
He will never go away  
No not my baby  
No not my baby  
No not my baby  
No not my baby
