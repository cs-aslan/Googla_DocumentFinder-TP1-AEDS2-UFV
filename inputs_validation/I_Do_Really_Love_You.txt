Its you Im in love with  
Its not what you are  
Its not how you treat me  
Or your fancy car  
But theres something about you  
I keep yearning for  
I I do really love you  
Just thinking about you  
Gives me such a thrill  
Let alone to be with you or know that I will  
And know that Ill tremble  
When I should be still  
Um um I I do really love you  
Give me what I live for  
Your sweet lips pressed to me  
And transform this yearning into ecstasy  
And send me oh send me  most humbly  
Um um I I do really love you
