Dont you want to be there dont you want to go  
Where the light is breaking and the cold clear winds blow  
Dont you want to be there in the golden glow  
  
Dont you want to be there dont you want to fly  
With your arms out let a shout take you across the sky  
Dont you want to be there when the times gone by  
  
Times there was love all around you  
Times you were strong and alone  
Times you believed love had found you  
And you fell through time like a stone  
  
And those you have wronged you know  
You need to let them know some way  
And those who have wronged you know  
Youll have to let them go someday  
  
Dont you want to be there  
Dont you want to cry when you see how far  
Youve got to go to be where forgiveness rules  
Instead of where you are  
  
Dont you want to be there dont you want to know  
Where the grace and simple truth of childhood go  
Dont you want to be there when the trumpets blow  
  
Blow for those born into hunger  
Blow for those lost neath the train  
Blow for those choking in anger  
Blow for those driven insane  
  
And those you have wronged you know  
You need to let them know some way  
And those who have wronged you know  
Youll have to let them go someday  
  
Dont you want to be there  
Dont you want to see where the angels appear  
Dont you want to be where theres strength and love  
In the place of fear
