and everything I was laughing a lot while I was learning it  
Howard Yeah Frank uh it was a little hard to get into it first but uh
once we got the drift   
Jeff Thats a real great part you got in there for the chorus when they go
rantantoon rantatan while I steal the room and everything I dont mind
hes ripping it off so long I get paid   
Mark Me too I wont even care bout the part where it goes what can I say
about this elixir so long as me and Howard and Jeff get credit for special
material theres some bad ground acid  Aynsley you can take it with a
grain of salt ha ha ha   
Aynsley I dont mean to upset you lads  I dont mean to upset you lads
but the reason my retorts were so snappy is because hes making me do this I
should imagine hes making you do yours too isnt he  
Howard Get out of here you creep you used to live in his house
