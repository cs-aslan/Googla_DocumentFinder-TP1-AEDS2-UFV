I like you soft ways I know shes gone  
But here I am and Im prepared to stay  
You dont have to hide inside your mind  
Put up a fight Ill love you make it right  
Cause if your heart needs some attention I think you know I can be found  
And I can ease the tension whenever Im around  
Come on be soft with me tonight  
I know you need a love thats true  
And I can supply it  
Come on be soft with me dont fight  
You know how much I need you too  
And I wont deny it oh no  
  
You wanna a girl thats strong  
That isnt wrong I understand  
Im here to help your plan  
I just wanna please but you unease  
Wont let you down  
Your dreams wont touch the ground  
So dont pretend she didnt matter  
I know your heart feels insecure  
Ill help you to forget her  
My love will be the cure  
Come on be soft with me tonight  
Let it be me youre thinking off  
Ooh baby baby cmon be soft with me tonight Dont fight  
You know how much I need you love  
Oh be soft with me tonight  
Let it be me youre picking out  
Oh come on be soft with me dont fight  
You know how much I need your love  
Oh now be soft Be soft with me tonight  
Come on come on be soft be soft  
And dont fight
