If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye  
Its no secret you feel better if you cry  
When waking from a bad dream dont you sometimes think its real  
But its only false emotions that you feel  
If your heartaches seem to hang around too long  
And your blues keep gettin bluer with each song  
Remember sunshine can be found behind the cloudy sky  
So let your head down and go on and cry  
If your heartaches
