The days seem so familiar  
Theres something about the evenings  
Even though they change every now and then  
Kenny Chesney  
Well I can be myself here  
I can free myself here  
I cant believe its last night again  
I see things go down  
I hear the talk of the town  
Like an echo in my ear  
If you should look for me  
Ill be right here  
I can leave myself here  
Or I could use some help here  
I cant believe its last night again  
KC  
Its a lonesome sound when this bar shuts down  
So I guess Ill have one more  
Nothin out there I aint seen before  
I can leave myself here  
I could use some help here  
I cant believe its last night again  
I cant believe its last night again  
I cant believe its last night again
