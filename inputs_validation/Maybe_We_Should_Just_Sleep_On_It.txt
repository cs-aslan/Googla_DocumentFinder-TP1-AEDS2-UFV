I got an empty feelin when that moving van pulled up  
It got a little emptier as I walked them fill that truck  
And when they carried out your clothes  
It took my breath away  
Now theyre headed for that bed  
The thought keeps running though my head  
  
Baby maybe we should just sleep on it tonight  
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds  
I could be wrong but goodbye just dont feel right  
So baby maybe we should just sleep on it tonight  
  
Ill pay them boys to stop right now  
And leave that truck out by the curb  
The TV and the phones packed up so we wont be disturbed  
Theres not a light left in this room just a shadow of a doubt  
So lets make sure we dont give up  
Before weve thought this through enough  
  
Baby maybe we should just sleep on it tonight  
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds  
I could be wrong but goodbye just dont feel right  
So baby maybe we should just sleep on it tonight
