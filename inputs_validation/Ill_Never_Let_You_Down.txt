Me Im just a simple guy  
And no matter how hard I try  
I may never show you how I feel  
  
You may be the woman I love  
I sometimes think that youve been sent from above  
I am trying to be a man  
Heaven knows I do the best that I can  
  
Ill never let you down  
Ill be there whenever you need me  
Ill never let you down  
Come what my way  
  
Me Ill be a shoulder to cry on  
Ill be someone you can rely on  
And maybe you may see just how I feel  
  
We may be so far apart  
But you still know Ive got a hungry heart  
We must be patient it wont last forever  
It wont be long until were together  
  
Ill never let you down  
Ill be there whenever you need me  
Ill never let you down  
Ill be strong Ill show you how love can be  
Ill never let you down  
Come what my way  
  
We must be patient it wont last forever  
It wont be long until were together  
  
Ill never let you down  
Ill be there whenever you need me  
Ill never let you down  
Ill be strong Ill show you how love can be
