Im calling cause I need you  
You know I need you so desperately  
You know how bad I can get  
And you know how good I can be  
  
Im calling just to tell you  
Get here and Ill make it worth your while  
I can make you some food  
Boy and then I can make you smile  
  
Cause Ive got nothing on but the radio  
And Ive got nothing on for tonight  
Nothing Nothing on but the radio  
And Im tuned into your station tonight  
With me tonight  
  
You better get here soon  
Or you know what I will do  
Got too much time on my hands  
Wait til I get my hands on you  
  
Cause Ive got nothing on but the radio  
And Ive got nothing on for tonight  
Nothing Nothing on but the radio  
And Im tuned into your station tonight  
With me tonight  
  
When you get here boy we can dance  
Our hands on the headboard its our defense  
Ive turned the lights down low  
And Ive got nothing on but the radio  
  
Got too much time on my hands  
Wait til I get my hands on you  
  
Cause Ive got nothing on but the radio  
And Ive got nothing on for tonight  
Nothing Nothing on but the radio  
And Im tuned into your station tonight  
With me tonight  
  
OhOhOh  
Ive got nothing on but the radio  
And Ive got nothing on for tonight  
Nothing Nothing on but the radio  
And Im tuned into your station tonight  
With me tonight
