Driving quick past  pass is 1000 feet high  
All in sky  
Pulling the clock down in the back of some pretty girls ride  
You get high  
  
PreChorus  
Avenues into this bowl for tips  
Foreign ships as long as girls ride on their   
  
Chorus  
Were always summer breaking when we ride in the streets after dark  
Were always summer breaking hanging out near the boys in the park  
Summer is gone summer breaking fall  
  
Verse 2  
Give em new hell got a new record to chill in your car  
Sing along  
It feels so good doesnt know youre too bright and too calm  
Like a diamond  
  
PreChorus  
Play your  playing away you forget   
Baby girl you can   
  
Chorus  
Were always summer breaking when we ride in the streets after dark  
Were always summer breaking hanging out near the boys in the park  
  
Summer is gone summer breaking fall
