There is a house in New Orleans  
They call the risin sun  
Its been the ruin of many a poor boy  
And God I know Im one  
  
I cried to my daddy on the telephone  
How long now  
Until the clouds unroll and you come down  
The line went  
But the shadows still remain since your descent your descent  
  
I cried to my daddy on the telephone  
How long now  
Until the clouds unroll and you come home  
The line went  
But the shadows still remain since your descent your descent

The saints are coming  
The saints are coming  
I say no matter how I try  
I realize theres no reply  
The saints are coming  
The saints are coming  
I say no matter how I try  
I realize theres no reply  
  
A drowning sorrow floods the deepest grief  
How long now  
Until the weather change condemns belief  
How long now  
When the night watchman lets in the thief  
Whats wrong now  
  
Boom Cha Hey  
  
The saints are coming  
The saints are coming  
I say no matter how I try  
I realize theres no reply  
The saints are coming  
The saints are coming  
I say no matter how I try  
I realize theres no reply  
I say no matter how I try  
I realize theres no reply  
I say no matter how I try  
I realize theres no reply
