Struck by the moon  
Risin too soon  
I feel a pain deep inside me  
Cold northern winds  
Fist in my chin  
Makin me wild for you baby  
  
What can I do  
To get back to you  
Im feeling desperate and lonely  
The citys a river  
Of cold misery  
Makin me wild for you baby  
  
Im down on my knees  
Hear me cry for you baby  
Cold misery  
I would die for you baby  
I pray you will see  
These tears I cry  
  
Nites I cant sleep  
My tears are cheap  
Im losin hold of my senses  
I cant contain  
All of this pain  
And its makin me wild for you baby  
  
Im down on my knees  
Hear me cry for you baby  
Cold misery  
I would die for you baby  
I pray you will see  
These tears I cry
