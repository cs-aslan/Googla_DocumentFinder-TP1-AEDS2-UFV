Ride the blue wind high and free  
Shell lead you down through misery  
Leave you low come time to go  
Alone and low as low can be  
  
If I had a nickel Id find a game  
If I won a dollar Id make it rain  
If it rained an ocean Id drink it dry  
And lay me down dissatisfied  
  
Legs to walk and thoughts to fly  
Eyes to laugh and lips to cry  
A restless tongue to classify  
All born to grow and grown to die  
  
So tell my baby I said so long  
Tell my mother I did no wrong  
Tell my brother to watch his own  
And tell my friends to mourn me none  
  
Im chained upon the face of time  
Feelin full of foolish rhyme  
There aint no dark till something shines  
Im bound to leave this dark behind  
  
Ride the blue wind high and free  
Shell lead you down through misery  
Leave you low come time to go  
Alone and low as low can be
