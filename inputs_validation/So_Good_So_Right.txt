You never know I was that type of man  
So good so right so good so so good so  
Right so good so

Chorus  
Feel so good about something so right  
Could it last another night  
Feel so good about something so right  
Could it last another night  
Feel so good about something so right  
Could it last another night  
Feel so good about something so right  
Could it last another night  
  
But you keep on watching the time  
Wondering whats on my mind  
So you say you cant stay too long cause  
You know what Im all about  
What Im all about what Im all about  
I dont have to sing and shout what Im  
All about  
You know what Im all about  
  
Chorus  
  
Yes its the truth its the fact Im coming  
To you straight from  
The back in a mastering room style  
Dont be shy dont you lie look into my  
Eye  
Ill tell you why Ill teach you about  
Feeling high  
  
Chorus  
  
Never before have you seen this so I say  
This feeling sink within my head oh yea  
Oh yea  
Never before have you believe it so I mean  
What I say

Could it last another night  
Yea feel so good about something so  
Right could it last another night  
A feel so good about something so right  
A feel so good about something so right  
Could it last another night  
So good so right so good so so good so

Whats in my brain  
If you believe what I say baby baby  
A check in check in check check check in

Check in check into my hotel
