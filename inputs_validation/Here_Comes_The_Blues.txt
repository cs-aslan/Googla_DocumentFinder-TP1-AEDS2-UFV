Monday is shining you know em Tuesdays rain  
Well the days go by me like a southbound train  
Yes its funny thinking you will never call my name  
Here comes long lonely here come the blues  
Well the worlds the same old comedy you know my time is cold  
Nothing new blue lady I wont get old  
Cause the deal is gone now Id just better hold  
Here comes long lonely here come the blues  
Well sun has run down she has gone out to hide  
Yes and now Im out walking where the midnight ride  
Just me and the good time Charlies and the suicide  
Here comes long lonely here come the blues  
Well Mondays dry yes and Tuesdays just the same  
Maybe come down blue Wednesday Im gonna grab the brakes again  
Cause no bottle of pills could ever kill this pain  
Here comes long lonely here come the blues  
Here comes long lonely here come the blues
