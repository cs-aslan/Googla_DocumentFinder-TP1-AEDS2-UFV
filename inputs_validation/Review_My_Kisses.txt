Im only happy when Im with you  
I only feel good when Im talking to you  
And Im a mess when you dont call me  
Call me at night  
Where did you go  
Where did you go  
And did you think of me  
  
Its hard to breathe  
And my hearts sinking  
Im slipping fast  
As I am reaching for you  
Its gonna hurt cause  
I have been there before  
Cant take much more  
Cant take another night  
Without you here beside me  
  
Chorus  
I want to review my kisses  
On every inch of your body  
I want to reveal my secrets  
That only you should know  
I feel all this pain inside me  
That only your lips can make better  
I want to review my kisses  
So you wont forget that you are mine  
  
Dont want to care  
More than you do  
Dont want to be the one  
Whos out in the rain  
Dont want to get that  
Call where you sound so cold  
So far away so far away  
Like the distant roll of thunder  
  
Chorus  
  
Its a cave in the darkness  
And Im lost inside you  
Dont go  
  
I want to review my kisses  
On every inch of your body  
I want to reveal my secrets  
That only you should know  
I feel like a childless mother  
Longing to hold her baby  
If I could review my kisses  
Then you wont forget that you are mine
