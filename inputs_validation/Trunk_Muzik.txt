Trunk Muzik trunk Muzik  
  
Straight from the back of the game I rock it  
Yelawolfs got that crack boy  
In the woods with the SK Im cockin  
You dont want to play with that toy  
Droppin this heat like an asteroid  
Good in the south like Pastor Troy  
Pull up aside of a 1977  
Sittin back and sippin my Crown and seven  
Pimpin Im about to get down  
Look at me changin lanes  
Twin pipes lookin like dragons breath  
Rooo Chevrolets blowin flames  
Yes I know its strange  
Hit you in the left eye  
Hold the change  
Bitch you too heavy to carry  
You dont wanna bury yourself  
Underneath that eight O eight Im droppin in your face like  
  
To the DJs  
Out cruisin  
I got that Trunk Muzik  
Everybody hop in the Cadillac  
And outta back Ima throttle the Chevrolets  
With the bottom wont you roll the window down  
If ya cruisin  
I got that Trunk Muzik  
Alabamas unanimous animal Yelawolf  
On the eight O eight come and fade away  
Aint no better way to get down  
  
I told you I was coming  
Said Id be here in five  
And even though I brought you glasses  
You still cant believe your eyes  
But if you dont believe it by now  
Fuck it just lean to the side  
Hold up wait a minute I dont really  
Wanna leave without a single solitary soul  
need em for what Ill bring it to em  
If your sailin catch my drift  
Lead me to the door check my list  
Meet me at the floor catch this fist  
Or meet me at the store catch this lick  
Build this house flip this brick  
Real skate borders feel this grip  
Moving through the alleyway  
Look at the people tripping  
Cause Im on a chopper like  
  
To the DJs  
Out cruisin  
I got that Trunk Muzik  
Everybody hop in the Cadillac  
And outta back Ima throttle the Chevrolets  
With the bottom wont you roll the window down  
If ya cruisin  
I got that Trunk Muzik  
Alabamas unanimous animal Yelawolf  
On the eight O eight come and fade away  
Aint no better way to get down  
  
I have to be the hardest I got diamond nuts  
I piss excellence Ricky Bobby lines em up  
Catfish Billy half pints em up  
Yelawolf country fries em up  
Pull um in duffle bag then I roll em in a river then I hold up  
Watch what the fuck you hold up  
Dynamite sticks will blow up  
GhetOVision got this sewed up  
Roll up smoke up everybody wishin they choose us  
But we dont give a fuck you know what  
I know you didnt see me coming but Im coming anyway  
Bitch Yelawolf is stylin on em  
  
To the DJs  
Out cruisin  
I got that Trunk Muzik  
Everybody hop in the Cadillac  
And outta back Ima throttle the Chevrolets  
With the bottom wont you roll the window down  
If ya cruisin  
I got that Trunk Muzik  
Alabamas unanimous animal Yelawolf  
On the eight O eight come and fade away  
Aint no better way to get down
