How Deep Is The Ocean  How Deep Is Your Love  
I Have A Love In My Eyes  
And How Do I Feel When You Cant Get Enough  
HalfWay To Your Paradise  
Oh My Love  Is Your Love  
Forever And A Day  
  
You Are Not Alone  Ill Be There For You  
You Are Not Alone  Anything Ill Do  
You Are Not Alone  Youre The One For Me  
You Are Not Alone  Thats No Tragedy  
You Are Not Alone  Youre The One For Me  
You Are Not Alone  Nothing Comes For Free  
  
Youre Breaking The Silence  Youre Breaking My Heart  
Youre Like A Rose In The Snow  
I Talk In My Sleep  I Dont Tear Apart  
Baby Ill Never Will Go Oh My Love  Is Your Love  
Forever And A Day
