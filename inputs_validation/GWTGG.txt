Thats right come on  
  
Long tall Sallys looking good to me  
Shaking that thing for everybody to see  
Oh everyones thinking just like me  
Wonder who the lucky fools going to be  
  
Chorus  
Get it while the gettins good baby  
Take it cause the others would  
Aint no hesitating they just might be waiting  
Get it while the gettins good  
  
Look at that dude in the parking lot  
Taken it for granted everything hes got  
So if he hands you a dollar  
Say Thank you sir cause Ive been up and down  
And I know what its worth  
  
Chorus  
  
You know I gotta have it aint no doubt about it  
Get it while the gettins good  
  
You can say you dont want it  
But deep inside you know you really do  
You know what Im talking about  
Well everybodys thinking just like me  
Wonder who the lucky fools going to be  
  
Chorus x2  
  
You gotta get it while the gettins good  
You gotta get it while the gettins good baby  
You gotta get it while the gettins good  
Oh you better get it while the gettins good baby
