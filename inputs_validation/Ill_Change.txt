Looking out across suburban yards to the construct of our  
Days through the thinning of the trees Whay can I only  
Build a house of cards Than gets blown to ieces with the  
Falls first fickel breeze When I feel that stirring the  
Illicit kiss Thans just the cool tongue of the devil with  
A suckerin his midst  
One day Ill cange youll be the fist one that I call I  
Owe you an apology too many thanks and thats not all Ive  
Been running long before I learned to crawl  
My calender lies crumpled laid to waste Its been  
Scrawled on thumbed through and changed Will this be  
The measure of my days Dinners and appointments and  
Deadlines I cant make And when I start to see it making  
Sense for me Thats just hope springing eternally  
One day Ill cange youll be the fist one that I call I  
Owe you an apology too many thanks and thats not all Ive  
Been running long before I learned to crawl  
Outside the summers gone for good Dying impatiens  
Stacked up wood My friends will get together to cook To  
Talk about what happened to take a second look The master  
Loves the servant who blind heeds him The husband the  
Obedient wife The snake will always bite the hand that deeds him  
Even if you love him even if you save his life  
One day Ill cange youll be the fist one that I call I  
Owe you an apology too many thanks and thats not all Ive  
Been running long before I learned to crawl
