Every man should marry every girl should wed  
You will find no truer words ever have been said  
Every man is sentimental hes just a dreamer at heart  
He needs someone soft and gentle to give his dream a start  
I dont know how to tell you dont know what to say  
Something has come over me since you came my way  
  
Yes Im plain oldfashioned oldfashioned as can be  
Every man should marry wont you marry me  
Dont know how to tell you I dont know what to say  
Something has come over me since you came my way  
Guess Im plain oldfashioned oldfashioned as can be  
Every man should marry wont you marry me
