Moanin low my sweet man I love him so  
Though hes mean as can be  
Hes the kind of man needs the kind  
Of a woman like me  
  
Gonna die if my sweet man should pass me by  
If I die wherell he be  
Hes the kind of a man needs the kind  
Of a woman like me  
  
Dont know any reason why  
He treats me so poorly  
What have I gone and done  
Makes me troubles double with his worries  
When surely I aint deserving of none  
  
Moanin low  
My sweet man is gonna go  
When he goes oh Lordy  
Hes the kind of a man needs the kind  
Of a woman like me  
Moanin low my sweet man I love him so  
Though hes mean as can be  
Hes the kind of man needs the kind  
Of a woman like me  
  
Gonna die if my sweet man should pass me by  
If I die wherell he be  
Hes the kind of a man needs the kind  
Of a woman like me

What have I gone and done  
Makes me troubles double with his worries

Moanin low  
My sweet man is gonna go  
When he goes oh Lordy  
Hes the kind of a man needs the kind  
Of a woman like me
