When Im lost in the rain  
In your eyes I know Ill find the light to light my way  
And when Im scared  
And losing ground  
  
When my world is going crazy  
You can turn it all around  
And when Im down youre there  pushing me to the top  
Youre always there giving me all youve got  
  
For a shield from the storm  
For a friend for a love to keep me safe and warm  
I turn to you  
For the strength to be strong  
  
For the will to carry on  
For everything you do for everything thats true  
I turn to you  
When I lose the will to win  
  
I just reach for you and I can reach the sky again  
I can do anything cause your love is so amazing  
Cause your love inspires me  
And when I need a friend  
  
Youre always on my side giving me faith taking me through the night  
For a shield from the storm  
For a friend for a love to keep me safe and warm  
I turn to you  
  
For the strength to be strong  
For the will to carry on  
For everything you do for everything thats true  
I turn to you  
  
For the arms to be my shelter through all the rain  
For truth that will never change  
For someone to lean on  
For a heart I can rely on through anything  
  
For that one who I can run to  
For a shield from the storm  
For a friend for a love to keep me safe and warm  
I turn to you  
  
For the strength to be strong  
For the will to carry on  
For everything you do for everything thats true  
I turn to you  
  
For a shield from the storm  
For a friend for a love to keep me safe and warm  
I turn to you  
For the strength to be strong  
  
For the will to carry on  
For everything you do for everything thats true  
I turn to you  
I turn to you
