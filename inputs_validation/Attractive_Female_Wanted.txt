Im tired of buying Penthouse and Oui and Hustler  
Its Friday night Im all alone still a bachelor  
She said shed call me when shed finished work  
Havent heard a word all day

Attractive female wanted  
I aint asking a great deal just a female to move in with me  
Attractive female wanted  
  
Ill share all my records toothbrush and car  
And color TV honestly  
A single girl for my single bed is my remedy  
Attractive female wanted  
  
She doesnt have to be a movie star  
Cover of a magazine  
She can work in a garage all day  
In the evening some canteen  
  
Im tired of blind dates making silly mistakes  
Its embarrassing  
Attractive female wanted

Attractive female wanted  
  
Wont someone please answer my prayers  
Before Im old and grey  
Attractive female wanted  
Ive been lonely too long

She doesnt have to be a movie star  
Cover of magazine  
She can work in a garage all day  
In the evening some canteen  
  
Attractive female wanted  
Active female wanted

But shell look after me  
Attractive female wanted  
  
Put me to bed ease my aching head  
And made fuss of me  
You know what I gonna do  
Think Ill write a letter  
To Mr Hugh Heffner confidentially  
  
Dear Sir  
A single girl for my single bed is my remedy
