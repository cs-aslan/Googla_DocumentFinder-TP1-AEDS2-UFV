Ive been out here in this wasteland  
Throwing horseshoes at the stars  
Nickel Silver and pearl inlay  
On an old guitar for my new life  
For the playwright and the printer  
Theme cafes and tourist bars  
Theyre on a permanent vacation  
Like butterflies in killing jars  
How the hell did it get this far  
Lets go now  
Maybe well walk  
Maybe well fly  
Seemon now  
Lets get outta here  
While were still young  
Take our dreams and run  
Seemon now  
Lets get outta here  
All the songs I sing were for you  
Though its something Ive denied  
Time is short so lets start running  
To hell with pride  
Cause time moves fast  
Seemon baby make it last  
Lets go now  
Maybe well walk  
Maybe well fly  
Seemon now  
Lets get outta here  
While were still young  
Take out dreams and run  
Seemon now  
Lets get outta here  
Theres a big sky  
Theres a big sky there for you and me  
Got no horizon  
Who needs a compass  
Ive got you and you got me  
Seemon baby  
It feels so good to be free  
Maybe well walk  
Maybe well fly  
Seemon now  
Lets get outta here  
Youve got the keys  
Baby I can drive  
Seemon now lets get outta here  
Maybe well walk  
Maybe well fly  
Seemon now lets get outta here  
Youve got that look  
You make it clear  
Seemon now lets get outta here  
Yeah yeah  
Get a piece of big sky  
Its yours and mine  
Yeah yeah  
Big sky  
Big sky
