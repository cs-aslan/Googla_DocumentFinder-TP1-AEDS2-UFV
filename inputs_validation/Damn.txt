In the club you gone feel it when it drop this summer  
Like rain we gone pour and hit you hard like thunder

Chorus  
  
Sean Paul  
Out of town hard heads get swiss cheesed up  
And you gon need more than stitches to patch that leak up  
Chump like me up my mouth TBd up  
With the plush leather guts steady grippin the butt  
Oh you fo sho with it then pull yo pistol  
Show a nigga you aint hoe with it  
And I aint selfish I will let you and your folk feel it  
Talkin big boy shit

JBo

We started off with Shake Em Off so look up now oh guess who  
Its them boys from the bottom who took you down 85  
And hit you with that youWay so dont be surprised  
We buckin blowin chillin and sippin on something good  
Im peepin out the scenery and wishin a nigga would  
In case it just might pop Im bout ready to lock and load  
To take you through the South to show you how we throw dem bows  
  
Chorus
