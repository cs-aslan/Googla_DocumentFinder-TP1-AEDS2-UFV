If I should die before I wake  
Lord pleasemy soul to take  
Man I aint even ask for this shit  
theres no way I can hide it  
You see the pain in my eyes  
I aint thinkin bout college  
Too busy tryin to stay alive  
They done cut the water off  
And I aint trying to the lights go  
Even little shit like 5 dollars Ima fight for  
My sisters only 12 and shes pregnant wit a baby  
My brothers goin ta jail and my mommas going crazy  
Im all by myself muthafuck my ol lady  
Cause soon tha money left she was fucking niggas daily  
We already in hell Lord please will you save me  
Im riding with a 12 gauge I know these niggas hate me  
I got a few birds and a few words for you niggas on the streets  
Im swirving in excursions I know you heard of me  
I got em mad at me I hit the block top drop that nigga bad aint he  
We sell rocks plus glocks and keep our rags hanging  
Thug niggas shooting at cops  
Look we aint playing anywhere setting up shop  
I wonder if I died and came back  
Would god still make a nigga sit here and slang crack  
Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat  
Theres gotta be somebody that who can come and explain that  
I know  
You got the ak bitches in the hood  
These snitches in the hood  
My suggestion to you nigga start getting it while its good  
If you crawl for your ball learn the game know the things that will get you
knocked off  
Cause niggas out here aint playin  
Being real done popped off  
Two pills in this home got me way in new york  
Bout to run up in your home and Im way up your floor  
My money and Im gone if he paid me on time then we wouldnt have to shoot
em  
But they got a place for him like they got a place for me  
Maybe well meet again well just have to wait and see  
Thug niggas I love killin so cock it back and bust  
Remember me I used to smoke weed on the school bus  
Nigga wha nigga who nigga wotcha won do  
Im young buck now move and let me come through  
Is it true before you die do you really see it coming Do the hardest nigga
crying start running  
I wonder if I died and came back  
Would god still make a nigga sit here and slang crack  
Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat  
Theres gotta be somebody who can come and explain that  
I know  
Politicians is bullshitting  
And really bill clinton is the closest we gettin to ever havin a black
president  
Still I feel heaven sent and try to walk with my head up  
Cause now we got this anthrax shit to be scared of  
Nobody prepared us for this  
All they said was make sure you watch the news at six  
And we feeding all these other countries  
What about that old man eating out of the fuckin dumpster  
Oh you dont know him but everything that goes up must come down  
One look and all the projects that they got go down  
Im rydin with god  
Me and my squad nigga you get beat  
Now we ballin but remember how it used to be  
So regardless dont let nothing come between our family our money our dreams  
And even when it seems like its all over from Tennessee to the Magnolia  
We gonna ball till we faulter  
I wonder if I died and came back  
Would god still let a nigga sit here and slang crack  
Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat  
Theres gotta be somebody that can come and explain that  
I know
