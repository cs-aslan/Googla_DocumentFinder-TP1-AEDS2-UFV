Words by Marilyn and Alan Bergman Music by Michel Legrand  
From the 1971 film Summer Of 42 starring Jennifer ONeill  
Legrand won an Oscar for his score  
  
The summer smiles the summer knows  
And unashamed she sheds her clothes  
The summer smoothes the restless sky  
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie  
The summer knows the summers wise  
She sees the doubts within your eyes  
And so she takes her summer time  
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger  
Twists the world round her summer finger  
Lets you see the wonder of her arms  
And if youve learned your lessons well  
Theres little more for her to tell  
One last caress its time to dress for fall  
  
And if youve learned your lesson well  
Theres little more for her to tell  
One last caress its time to dress for fall
