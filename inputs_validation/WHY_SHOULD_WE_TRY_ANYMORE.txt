Whats the use to deny weve been livin a lie  
That we should have admitted before  
We were just victims of a half hearted love  
So why should we try anymore  
  
The vows that we make are only to break  
We drift like a wave from the shore  
The kisses we steal we know are not real  
So why should we try anymore  
  
The dreams that we knew can never come true  
Theyre gone to return no more  
False love like ours fades with the flowers  
So why should we try anymore  
  
Our storys so old again has been told  
On the past lets close the door  
And smile dont regret but live and forget  
Theres no use to try anymore
