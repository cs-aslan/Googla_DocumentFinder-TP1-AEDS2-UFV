You say you dont want it  
Just watch and youll flaunt it  
You stare at the ceiling  
And ignore what Im feeling  
  
Well thats fine hey I dont mind  
I can find nothing wrong with it  
And you say in your polite way  
Oh by the way can you get on with it  
  
Now that Ive seen  
Not really diggin this  
  
Did I ask for your input  
Hows the taste of your own foot  
To speak and not be right  
Youd like to just rewrite  
My life and take what you like  
And decide with all of it  
And to know that if it goes right  
Youll never find out if I wanted it  
  
Now that Ive seen  
Not really diggin this  
Now that I know  
Not really diggin this  
  
Called him twice today  
They said he went away  
I never wondered why  
They tried to hold him  
Aint never comin back  
Pull out the welcome mat  
I never wondered why  
They tried to hold him  
  
The way that its goin  
To laugh without knowin  
The way that Im feelin  
Inside is unappealin  
  
Well thats fine hey I dont mind  
I can find nothing wrong with it  
And you say in your polite way  
Oh by the way can you get on with it  
  
Now that Ive seen  
Not really diggin this  
Now that I know  
Not really diggin this  
Not really diggin this
