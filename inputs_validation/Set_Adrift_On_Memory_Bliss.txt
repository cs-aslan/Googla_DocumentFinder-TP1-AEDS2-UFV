On memorys bliss of you  
  
The candle plays the hourglass  
The days go and all I do is  
Think of you and wonder where you are at night  
Oh I remember everything  
Every smile and even all  
The reasons why you say  
I pushed you out of my life  
  
Chorus  
Baby you set me  
Baby you set me  
Set adrift on memorys bliss of you  
Baby you set me  
Set adrift on memorys bliss of you  
  
Destiny is everything  
Realitys replaced you with  
The biggest empty void Ive ever had in life ever had in life ohh  
Bet you say that I dont care  
I bet you say that I dont even think of you  
But God knows how wrong you are  
  
Baby will you be there when the morning comes  
Baby will you be there  
Just give me time just give me time  
To fix my life to fix my life baby  
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes  
After all the time Ive spent wishing you  
  
Chorus  
  
Sadness that overwhelmed me  
My mind flies and carelessly  
Imagines that youre happy with your life right now oh  
I guess thats just the was it goes  
Forevers gone so now I must  
Place you with all the things that I can never have  
  
Chorus  
  
So come on now  
I know this much is true  
I know this much is true
