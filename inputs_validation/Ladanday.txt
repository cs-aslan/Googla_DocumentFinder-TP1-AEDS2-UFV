Now Peter sat on the mountaintop  
Northern wind blowin through his hair  
Now Peter never took the time to stop  
He just stood out there and stared  
I said but Peter didnt care bout the air down there  
He was lookin right at the sun  
The sun said son dont ya come around here  
And Peter then began to run  
Hey  
Now Peter he never cried too much  
He just looked out toward the west  
He was dreamin of a land that was way over there  
And dreamin of what comes next  
But Peter didnt care bout the air down there  
He was lookin right out at the sun  
And the sun said son come around here  
So Peter started to run  
He said ladandandandandandandanday 2x  
Now Peter started walkin down the mountain  
Just runnin out toward the West  
It was slippery like the water from a fountain  
And Peter though that was best  
Cause he slid down there to the town over there  
And people just started to cry  
But Peter didnt care about the air  
And Peter was never shy  
Ladanday 4x  
BRIDGE  
Now he sang out loud to a unified crowd  
Singing something bout he thought he was  
But the crowd didnt care bout the air up there  
And Peter wasnt nothin but nothin  
But Peter didnt care he just looked over there  
And the crowd was smilin back  
He was singin to his heart and praying to his soul  
That they would ask hime back  
Ladandandandandandandanday 2x  
Now Peter  
Was lookin round to the back  
Mountainside slipped from under his feet  
He didnt really care bout the air down there  
He just looked out at the sun  
The sun said son dont ya come around here  
So Peter then began to run  
He said ladandandandandanday 4x
