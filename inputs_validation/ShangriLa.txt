Sitting here waiting for  
Someone calling at my door  
Too bad  
Im getting out of love  
  
Whats the use of changing things  
Wonder what tomorrow brings  
Who knows  
Im getting out of love  
  
CHORUS  
My Shangrila has gone away  
Faded like the Beatles on Hey Jude  
She seemed to drift out on the rain  
That came in somewhere softly from the blue  
  
Clouds roll by and hide the sun  
Raindrops fall on everyone  
So sad  
Im getting out of love  
  
CHORUS  repeat x2
