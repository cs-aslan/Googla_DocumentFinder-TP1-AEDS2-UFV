Id rather leave while Im in love  
While I still believe the meaning of the word  
Ill keep my dreams and just pretend  
That you and I were never meant to end  
  
Too many times Ive seen the rose die on the vine  
Somebodys heart gets broken  
And usually its mine  
I dont wanna take the chance of being hurt again  
And you and I cant say goodbye  
  
So if you wake and find me gone  
Oh babe just carry on  
You see I need my fantasy  
I still believe its best to leave while Im in love ooh  
  
Too many times Ive seen the rose die on the vine  
Somebodys heart gets broken yeah  
And usually its mine  
I dont wanna take the chance of being hurt again  
And you and i we cant say goodbye  
  
So if you wake and find me gone  
Hey babe just carry on  
You see I need my fantasy  
I still believe its best to leave while Im in love oh oh  
Id rather leave while Im in love
