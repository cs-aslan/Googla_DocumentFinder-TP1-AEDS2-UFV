Im looking through a hole in the sky  
Im seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie  
Im getting closer to the end of the line  
Im living easy where the sun doesnt shine  
  
Im living in a room without any view  
Im living free because the rents never due  
The synonyms of all the things that Ive said  
Are just the riddles that are built in my head  
  
Hole in the sky take me to heaven  
Window in time through it I fly  
  
Ive seen the stars disappear in the sun  
The shootings easy if youve got the right gun  
And even though Im sitting waiting for Mars  
I dont believe theres any future in cause  
  
Hole in the sky take me to heaven  
Window in time through it I fly  
Yeah  
  
Ive watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast  
Ive seen the western world go down in the east  
The food of love became the greed of our time  
But now Im living on the profits of pride
