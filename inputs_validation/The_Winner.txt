Long awaited hated  
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated  
Its about time that you made it  
I was bumpin yo songs when nobody else played it  
When I was up in in atlanta steady givin daps  
Fetchin niggas drinks but I never got to rap  
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped  
But I cant sign nothin til my lawyer get the fax and  
No one decides who the definition of talent is  
And mrs look at what my talent did  
And what yo business is  
Its been a couple years  
Guess its not about who you know its just how you balance it  
Its always awkward to a nigga artist  
And get on someone song when you know you comin the hardest  
Its how you start actin when nobody can reach ya  
My plan just hatched happy easter
