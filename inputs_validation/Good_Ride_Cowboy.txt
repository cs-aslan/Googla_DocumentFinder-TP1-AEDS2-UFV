From the hills of Kaycee Wyoming  
Where lifes wooly and wild  
Came a Navy brat In a cowboy hat  
And that Copenhagen smile  
  
And from buckin broncs to honky tonks  
He always sang a cowboy song  
We were much to young Having too much fun  
As we all sang along  
  
And we sang Lifes a Highway  
Theres only one way youre gonna get through it  
When she starts to twist be more like Chris  
Pull your hat down tight and just LeDoux it  
When that whistle blows and the crowd explodes  
And them pickupmen are at your side  
They tell you Good ride cowboy good ride  
  
Take a ride  
  
Well gold buckles to gold records  
Once again he was spinnin round  
Took the whole world on And he turned us on  
To that Western underground  
  
And from bareback jack to this cowboys hat  
The songs were stronger than his pain  
He would not slow down From town to town  
Like children running through the rain  
  
And he sang Lifes a Highway  
Theres only one way youre gonna get through it  
When she starts to twist be more like Chris  
Pull your hat down tight and just LeDoux it  
When that whistle blows and that crowd explodes  
And them pickupmen are at your side  
They tell you Good ride cowboy good ride  
  
We sang Lifes a Highway  
Theres only one way youre gonna get through it yeah  
When she starts to twist be more like Chris  
Pull your hat down tight let me have it and just LeDoux it  
When that whistle blows and that crowd explodes  
And them pickupmen are at your side  
They tell you Good ride cowboy good ride  
  
Then he crossed that River Jordan  
With St Peter on the other side  
Singin Good ride cowboy good ride  
Say Good ride cowboy good ride
