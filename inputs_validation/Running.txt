Ready at the line looking out  
Looking out to all thats ahead  
When every heart  
Confesses Your Name  
Were pressing on towards that Day  
Were never gonna stop  
Were never gonna stop  
  
Letting go of every mistake  
Throwing off the chains of restraint  
All that will remain  
A passion for Your Name  
Burning as we run this race  
Were never gonna stop  
Were never gonna stop  
Were never gonna stop  
Were never gonna stop  
  
We are running  
Chasing after all that You are  
We are running  
Cause all that You are  
Is all that we want now  
  
Every stride is taken in faith  
Every step compelled by Your grace  
Were taking up our cross  
No matter what the cost  
We give it all to go Your way  
Were never gonna stop  
Were never gonna stop  
  
Onwards we draw towards Your light  
Desperate we seek to know You more and more  
Further we look beyond ourselves  
To Your love  
To your love
