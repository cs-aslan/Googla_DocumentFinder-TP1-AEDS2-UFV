Hey you gender nectar sifting  
Through the grain of gold tripping at  
Your door is that you alpha in her blood  
And when the woman lies you dont  
Believe her  
  
Rolling and unrolling  
Coiling emerging  
Running free  
Running through the underworld  
Into your room  
  
Is he real or a ghostlie  
She feels she isnt heard  
And the veil tears and rages  
Till her voices are remembered  
And his secrets can be told  
Hey you gender nectar  
Crystalline from the vine  
You know youll drink her  
  
Rolling and unrolling  
Coiling emerging running free  
Running through the afterworld  
Into your room so she prays  
For a prankster and lust  
In the marriage bed  
And he waits till she can give  
And he waits and he  
Waits
