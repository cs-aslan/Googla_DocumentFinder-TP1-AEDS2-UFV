Please dont think of me  
If you do gotta block it  
I got chills tonight  
And you cant be here to stop it  
Im not a parasite  
Its just a lonely night  
Tonight  
  
I walked from the bar  
Cause they were only laughing  
I wished our our star  
But they covered it in satin  
Im not a gigalo  
Thats what I want you to know  
Tonight  
  
Ooh Ooh  
Im hurt you I can see  
Ooh Ooh  
Do you think its not hurting me  
  
Ooh Ooh  
The grass aint always green  
And its hurting you  
You know that its hurting me  
You know that its hurting me  
  
Youll meet other men  
Who will break your heart  
If I see you with them  
Its gonna tear me apart  
  
Maybe in another life  
We wouldnt be alone  
Tonight  
  
Ooh Ooh  
Ive hurt you I can see  
Ooh Ooh  
Do you think its not hurting me  
  
Ooh Ooh  
The grass aint always green  
And if its hurting you  
You know that its hurting me  
You know that its hurting me  
You know that its hurting me  
You know that its hurting me
