On the talk back show  
On the radio  
At the local bar  
In the hot traffic by the red tail lights  
  
Chorus  
Everybodys down on their knees  
Listen like thieves  
But who needs that  
When its all in your hands  
  
And we take it down  
To the end of town  
Where they have control  
But theyre losing touch when the lights go out  
  
Chorus  
  
Everybodys down on their knees  
Listen like thieves for the end signs  
But who needs that when youve got it all in your hands  
Its all in your hands  
Its all in your hands  
  
You are all you need  
You are all you need  
And that is everything  
So dont hesitate  
Theres no time to waste  
You just do it for yourself  
  
Chorus  
  
You got it all  
You got it all  
Its all in your hands  
You got it all  
Got it all
