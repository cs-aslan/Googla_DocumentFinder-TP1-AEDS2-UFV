Here I go again my hearts on the line  
Im willing to pretend one more time  
I got some life to spend on even rhymes  
But when I reach the end will you will you will you be mine  
  
Chorus  
This time I know youre not the answer to my prayer  
And I have grown with each disappointment through the years  
And as bad as I am and as bad as I am  
Im still here  
  
On the road again  
Ive paid a fine  
Where now is the friend  
I leave I leave I leave behind  
  
Im goin round the bend  
One more climb  
But when I reach the end  
Will you will you will you be mine  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Im still here  
Im still here  
Im still here  
Im still
