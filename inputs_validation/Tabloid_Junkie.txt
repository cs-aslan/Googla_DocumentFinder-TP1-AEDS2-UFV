Speculate to break the one you hate  
Circulate the lie you confiscate  
Assassinate and mutilate  
The hounding media in hysteria  
Whos the next for you to resurrect  
JFK exposed the CIA  
Truth be told the grassy knoll  
The blackmail story in all your glory  
  
Its Slander  
You say its not a sword  
But with your pen you torture men  
Youd crucify the Lord  
And you dont have to read it  
And you dont have to eat it  
To buy it is to feed it  
So why do we keep foolin ourselves  
  
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Dont make it factual  
Though everybody wants to read all about it  
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Dont make it factual actual  
They say hes homosexual  
  
In the hood  
Frame him if you could  
Shoot to kill  
To blame him if you will  
If he dies sympathize  
Such false witnesses  
Damn self righteousness  
In the black  
Stab me in the back  
In the face  
To lie and shame the race  
Heroine and Marilyn  
The headline stories of  
All your glory  
  
Its slander  
With the words you use  
Youre a parasite in black and white  
Do anything for news  
If you dont go and buy it  
Then they wont glorify it  
To read it sanctifies it  
Then why do we keep foolin ourselves  
  
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Dont make it factual  
Everybody wants to read all about it  
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Dont make it factual  
See but everybody wants to believe all about it  
  
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Dont make it factual  
See but everybody wants to believe all about it  
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Dont make it factual actual  
Shes blonde and shes bisexual  
  
Scandal  
With the words you use  
Youre a parasite in black and white  
Do anything for news  
And you dont go and buy it  
Then they wont glorify it  
To read it sanctifies it  
Why do we keep foolin ourselves  
Slander  
You say its not a sin  
But with your pen you torture men  
Then why do we keep foolin ourselves  
  
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Dont make it factual  
Though everybody wants to read all about it  
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Dont make it factual  
See but everybody wants to believe all about it  
  
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Dont make it factual  
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Dont make it factual  
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Dont make it factual actual  
  
Youre so damn disrespectable
