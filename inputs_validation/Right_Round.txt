Chorus  
You spin my head right round right round  
When you go down when you go down down  
You spin my head right round right round  
When you go down when you go down down  
  
Hey  
Hopped out of that house with my swagger  
Hop in that with dough I got places to go  
People to see time is precious  
Look at my crowd and they out of control  
Just like my mind where Im going  
No women no shorties no nothing but clothes  
No stopping now my parolees on role  
I like my jewelry thats always on gold  
I know the storm is coming  
My pockets keep telling me its gonna shower  
Call up my homies thats home  
Then pop in the night cause its meant to be ours  
We keep a fade away shot cause we balling  
Its platinum patron that be ours  
Lil mama I owe you just like the flowers  
Girl you the drink with all that goodie powder  
  
Chorus  
  
From the top of the pole I watch her go down  
She got me throwing my money around  
Aint nothing more beautiful to be found  
Its going down down  
From the top of the pole I watch her go down  
She got me throwing my money around  
Aint nothing more beautiful to be found  
Its going down down  
  
Hey  
Shawty must know Im the man  
My money love her like a number one fan  
Dont look at my mouth let her talk to my fans  
My Benjamin Franklins  
A couple of grands I got rubber bands  
My paper planes making a dance  
Get dirty all night thats part of my thing  
Rebuilding castles thats made out of sand  
Shes amazing the fire blazing  
Hotter than Cajun  
Girl wont you move a lil closer  
Time to get paid its maximum wage  
That body belong on a poster  
Im in a daze that bottom is wavin at me  
Like damn it I know you  
You wanna show like a gun out of holster  
Tell me whatever and Ill be your gopher  
  
Chorus  
  
From the top of the pole I watch her go down  
She got me throwing my money around  
Aint nothing more beautiful to be found  
Its going down down  
From the top of the pole I watch her go down  
She got me throwing my money around  
Aint nothing more beautiful to be found  
Its going down down  
  
Im spending my money  
Im out of control  
Somebody help me  
Shes taking my bank roll  
But Im king of the club  
And Im wearing the crown  
Popping these bottles  
Touching these models  
Watching they asses go down down

When you go down when you go down down
