I spent the morning at an old friends grave  
Flowers and Amazing Grace he was a good man  
He spent his whole life spinnin his wheels  
Never knowin how the real thing feels  
He never took a chance or took the time to dance  
And I stood there thinking as I said goodbye  
Today is the first day of the rest of my life  
  
Im gonna stop lookin back and start movin on  
And learn how to face my fears  
Love with all of my heart make my mark  
I want to leave something here  
  
Chorus  
Go out on a ledge with out any net  
Thats what Im gonna be about  
Yeah I want to be runnin  
When the sand runs out  
  
Cause people do it everyday  
Promise themselves theyre gonna change  
Ive been there but Im changin from the inside out  
  
That was then and this is now  
Im a new man yeah Im a brand new man  
And when they carve my stone theyll write these words  
Here lies a man who lived life for all that its worth  
  
Im gonna stop lookin back and start movin on  
Learn how to face my fears  
Love with all of my heart make my mark  
I want to leave something here  
  
Go out on a ledge with out any net  
Thats what Im gonna be about  
Yeah I want to be runnin  
When the sand runs out  
  
And as the cold wind blows  
Across the graveyard  
I think I hear the voice  
Of my old friend  
Whisper in my ear  
  
Chorus  
  
I want to be runnin when  
The sand runs out  
Ooo yes I do
