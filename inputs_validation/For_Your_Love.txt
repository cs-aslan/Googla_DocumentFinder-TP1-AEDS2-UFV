All the gold in all the world  
Is nothing to possess  
If all the things that it can bring  
Cant add up to one ounce of your happiness  
  
And for your love  
I would do anything  
Just to see the smile upon your face  
For your love  
I would go anywhere  
Just you tell me and Ill be right there  
  
A diamond that shines  
Like a star in the sky  
Is nothing to behold  
For minuscule is any light  
If it cant like you brighten up my soul  
  
And for your love  
I would do anything  
Just to see the smile upon your face  
For your love  
I would go anywhere  
Just you tell me and Ill be right there  
  
I could have never fathomed this  
Such joy love and tenderness  
That you give to me  
For the love I feel inside  
Its so wonderful I cant hide  
And I glow I glow  
With just the thought of you  
I do I do I do I do I do I do  
  
And for your love  
I would do anything  
Just to see the smile upon your face  
For your love  
I would go anywhere  
Just you tell me and Ill be right there
