Good to see you again Rosie  
I know Ive changed a lot since then  
Youre lookin fine babe  
Three years that aint long Rosie  
I still remember our song  
When you were mine babe  
Times change times change I know  
But it sure moves slow  
Down river when youre locked away  
Hey why didnt you write Rosie  
I stayed awake most every night  
Countin my time babe  
Oh no I aint mad Rosie  
I know you had to mind your dad  
But just a line babe  
Oh sure I remember then  
We went off to school  
Aint that right  
Well he aint no fool  
Hes a good man Rosie  
Hold him tight as you can  
Dont ask me why babe  
Yeah nice seein you again Rosie  
Me I got things to do  
Well goodbye babe  
chorus  
chorus  
Rosie down river  
Down river when youre locked away  
Rosie Im losing  
Down river
