Yeahehheah  
You are my fire  
The one desire  
Believe when I say  
I want it that way  
  
But we are two worlds apart  
Cant reach to your heart  
When you say  
That I want it that way  
  
Chorus  
Tell me why  
Aint nothin but a heartache  
Tell me why  
Aint nothin but a mistake  
Tell me why  
I never want to hear you say  
I want it that way  
  
Am I your fire  
Your one desire  
Yes I know its too late  
But I want it that way  
  
Chorus  
  
Now I can see that weve fallen apart  
From the way that it used to be Yeah  
No matter the distance  
I want you to know  
That deep down inside of me  
  
You are my fire  
The one desire  
You are You are you are you are  
  
Dont want to hear you say  
Aint nothin but a heartache  
Aint nothin but a mistake  
Dont want to hear you say  
I never want to hear you say  
I want it that way  
  
Chorus  
  
Tell me why  
Aint nothin but a heartache  
Aint nothin but a mistake  
Tell me why  
I never want to hear you say  
Never want to hear you say it  
I want it that way  
  
Cause I want it that way
