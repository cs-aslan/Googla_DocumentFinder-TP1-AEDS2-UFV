Mister Gator hes aglidin down the bayou  
Mister Buzzard hes aslidin through the air  
Mister Turtle be ahittin the highway  
I aint goin nowhere  
  
I aint leavin you love babe  
I aint leavin you love babe  
Not for heaven above babe  
I aint leavin you love babe  
  
The poor man got him an airplane  
Tryin to cruise across the traffic jam  
The rich man got him a Chevrolet  
Im stayin right where I am  
  
Now Hannibal he climbed the mountains  
Cleopatra danced down the Nile  
Lucky Lindy made it all the way to gay Paris  
Im stayin right here awhile
