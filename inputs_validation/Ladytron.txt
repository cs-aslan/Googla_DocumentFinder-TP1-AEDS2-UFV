Youve got me girl on the run around run around  
Youve got me all around town  
Youve got me girl on the run around  
And its getting me down getting me down  
Lady if you want to find a lover  
Then you look no further  
For Im gonna be your only  
Searching at the start of the season  
And my only reason  
Is that Ill get to you  
Ill find some way of connection  
Hiding my intention  
Then Ill move up close to you  
Ill use you and Ill confuse you  
And the Ill lose you  
Still you wont suspect me
