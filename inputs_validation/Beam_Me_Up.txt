Theres a whole nother conversation going on  
In a parralell universe  
Where nothig breaks and nothing hurts  
Theres a waltz playing frozen in time  
Blades of grass on tiny bare feet  
I look at you and youre looking at me  
  
Could you beam me up  
Give me a minute I dont know what Id say in it  
Probably just stare happy just to be there holding your face  
Beam me up  
Let me be lighter tired of being a fighter  
I think a minutes enough  
Just beam me up  
  
Some black birds soaring in the sky  
Barely a breath like our one last say  
Tell me that was you saying goodbye  
There are times I feel the shiver and cold  
It only happens when Im on my own  
I tell ya tell me Im not alone  
  
Could you beam me up  
Give me a minute I dont know what Id say in it  
Id Probably just stare happy just to be there holding your face  
Beam me up  
Let me be lighter tired of being a fighter  
I think a minutes enough  
Just beam me up  
  
In my head I see your baby blues  
I hear your voice and I I break in two and now theres  
One of me with you  
  
So when I need you can I send you a sign  
Ill burn a candle and turn off the lights  
Ill pick a star and watch you shine  
  
Just beam me up  
Give me a minute I dont know what Id say in it  
Probably just stare happy just to be there holding your face  
Beam me up  
Let me be lighter tired of being a fighter  
I think a minutes enough  
Beam me up  
Beam me up  
Beam me up  
Could you beam me up
