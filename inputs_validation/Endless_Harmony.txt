Ocean lovers who like to harmonize  
Theyre all cousins friends and brothers  
And they make their Mamas cry  
Theyre recordmaking heartbreaking  
Just West Coast boys  
What I know its a beginning of an endless harmony  
  
Striped shirt freedom  
Brave new worlds  
Go out on the road  
Where theres midsixties screaming  
And that nighttime holiday scheming  
While a lifestyle turns to gold  
Musics growing  
And vibrations showing  
Whats it all mean  
I know it means theres an endless harmony  
  
And we sang God bless America  
Its a land where we tour  
She takes great care of us  
And people love for where we sing  
We sing
