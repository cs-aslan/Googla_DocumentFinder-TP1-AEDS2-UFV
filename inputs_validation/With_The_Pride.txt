Just leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now theyve taken the reason away  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
Build on rock or build on sand  
Theyre never gonna lend a hand  
So nothing grows or nothing stands  
I cant take anymore I cant take anymore  
Cause theres not a lot of space for me  
But Ive still got my dignity  
Ive got my price dont say Im free  
I cant take anymore I cant take anymore  
But Im hungry I could eat anything  
But Im hungry ooh lets dance ooh lets swing  
And all that I hear are the words that she sings  
Now theyve taken it all now theyve taken it all  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now theyve taken the reason away  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now theyve taken the reason away  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
Id rather take this cure for life  
Than make myself a sacrifice  
When living is to pay the price  
I cant take anymore I cant take anymore  
It takes a while to understand  
When your eyes are full of sand  
When only time is in your hands  
I cant take anymore I cant take anymore  
But Im hungry I could eat anything  
But Im hungry ooh lets dance ooh lets swing  
And all that I hear are the words that she sings  
Now theyve taken it all now theyve taken it all  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now theyve taken the reason away  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now theyve taken the reason away  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
Oh but Im hungry I could eat anything  
And Im hungry ooh lets dance ooh lets swing  
And all that I hear are the words that she sings  
Now theyve taken it all now theyve taken it all  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now theyve taken the reason away  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
Leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now theyve taken the reason away  
Leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
Leave me with the pride  
With the pride that I worked for today  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now theyve taken the reason away  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
Leave me with the pride  
Leave me with the pride
