Age 39 looking over from my hotel window  
Blue dots and red dots skating away in the park  
I used to be there twenty years ago  
Huffing over a mug hot chocolate drink  
  
Age 39 looking over from my hotel wind  
Wondering if one should jump off or go to sleep  
People tell you up is better than down  
But they never tell you which is up and which is down  
  
Age 39 looking over from my hotel wind  
95 pound bundle but its trouble when theres nowhere to leave  
People say stardust and golddust are it  
But they never tell you it chokes you just as sawdust do  
  
Age 39 feeling pretty suicidal  
The weight gets heavier when youve bled thirty years  
Show me your blood john and Ill show you mine  
They say its running even when youre asleep  
  
No trace of resentment no trace of regrets  
One bloods thinner but both look red and fresh  
If I ever die please go to my daughter  
And tell her that she used to haunt me in my dreams  
Thats saying a lot for a neurotic like me  
  
Age 39 looking over from my hotel window  
Trying to tackle away with heart of clay  
The weight gets lighter when theres nowhere to turn  
Gods little dandruff floating in the air  
  
Age 39 looking over the world  
Age 39 floating over the world  
Age 39 Mmmm Floating along
