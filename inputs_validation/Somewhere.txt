Lost in the darkness hoping for a sign  
Instead there is only silence  
Cant you hear my screams  
Never stop hoping  
Need to know where you are  
But one thing is for sure  
Youre always in my heart  
  
Ill find you somewhere  
Ill keep on trying until my dying day  
I just need to know whatever has happened  
The truth will free my soul  
  
Lost in the darkness try to find your way home  
I want to embrace you and never let you go  
Almost hope youre in heaven  
so no one can hurt your soul  
Living in agony cause I just do not know  
Where you are  
  
Ill find you somewhere  
Ill keep on trying until my dying day  
I just need to know whatever has happened  
The truth will free my soul  
  
Wherever you are I wont stop searching  
Whatever it takes I need to know  
  
Ill find you somewhere  
Ill keep on trying until my dying day  
I just need to know whatever has happened  
The truth will free my soul
