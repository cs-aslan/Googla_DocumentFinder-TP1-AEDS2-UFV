Play house put my favorite record on  
Get down get your crystal method on  
You were like dark tan driving round the city  
Flirting with the girls like youre so pretty  
Springsteen is the king dont you think  
I was like hell yeah that guy can sing  
  
Like ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh whoa  
  
You make me crazy you make me wild  
Just like a baby spin me round like a child  
Your skin so golden brown  
Be young be dope be proud  
Like an American  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh like an American  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Drive fast I can almost taste it now  
LA I dont even have to fake it now  
Youre like so sick everybody said it  
Youre way ahead of the trend geget it  
Elvis is the best hell yes  
Honey put on that party dress  
  
Like ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh whoa  
  
You make me crazy you make me wild  
Just like a baby spin me round like a child  
Your skin so golden brown  
Be young be dope be proud  
Like an American  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh like an American  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Everybody wants to go fast but they cant compare  
I dont really want the rest only you can take me there  
I dont eve know what Im saying but Im praying for you  
  
You make me crazy you make me wild  
Just like a baby spin me round like a child  
Your skin so golden brown  
Be young be dope be proud  
Like an American  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh like an American  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh like an American  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh like an American  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh like an American  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh like an American
