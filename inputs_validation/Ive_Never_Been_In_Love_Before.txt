Ive never been in love before  
Now all at once its you  
Its you forevermore  
Ive never been in love before  
I thought my heart was safe  
I thought I knew the score  
But this is wine  
Thats all too strange and strong  
Im full of foolish song  
And out my song must pour  
So please forgive this helpless haze Im in  
Ive really never been in love before  
But this is wine  
Thats all too strange and strong  
Im full of foolish song  
And out my song must pour  
So please forgive this helpless haze Im in  
Ive really never been in love before
