As I went out one morning  
To breathe the air around Tom Paines  
I spied the fairest damsel  
That ever did walk in chains  
I offerd her my hand  
She took me by the arm  
I knew that very instant  
She meant to do me harm  
  
Depart from me this moment  
I told her with my voice  
Said she But I dont wish to  
Said I But you have no choice  
I beg you sir she pleaded  
From the corners of her mouth  
I will secretly accept you  
And together well fly south  
  
Just then Tom Paine himself  
Came running from across the field  
Shouting at this lovely girl  
And commanding her to yield  
And as she was letting go her grip  
Up Tom Paine did run  
Im sorry sir he said to me  
Im sorry for what shes done
