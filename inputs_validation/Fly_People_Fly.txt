And I see the tears in your eyes  
The rain will fall tonight  
And tonight well go to the sky  
Because and we fly  
  
All together  
Fly to the sky  
Fly to the rainbow  
Fly people fly  
Fly people fly  
  
And I see the smile on your face  
When you look into space  
Hes so bright and he is so great  
Come on or its too late  
  
All together  
Fly to the sky  
Fly to the rainbow  
Fly people fly  
Fly people fly  
  
See the rainbow in the sun  
The man will not go  
And the world they have no fun  
Hurry up people run  
  
All together  
Fly to the sky  
Fly to the rainbow  
Fly people fly  
Fly people fly  
  
All together  
Fly to the sky  
Fly to the rainbow  
Fly people fly  
Fly people fly
