Mother Father Im here in the zoo  
I cant come home cause Ive grown up too soon  
I got my sentence  
I got my command  
They said theyd make me major if I met all their demands  
  
I could be a corpral into corpral punishment  
Or the genral manager of a large establishment  
They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod  
But I never thought theyd put me in the  
  
Goon squad  
Theyve come to look you over and theyre giving you the eye  
Goon squad  
They want you to come out to play  
Youd better say goodbye  
  
Some grow just like their dads  
And some grow up too tall  
Some go drinking with the lads  
Some are no fun at all  
  
And you must find the proper place  
For everything you see  
But youll never get to make a lampshade out of me  
  
I could join a chain of males or be the missing link  
Looking for a lucky girl to put me in the pink  
They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod  
But I never thought theyd put me in the  
  
Good squad  
  
Mother Father Im doing so well  
Im making such progress now that you can hardly tell  
I fit in a little dedication  
With one eye on the clock  
They caught you under medication  
You could be in for a shock  
  
Thinking up the alibis that evryones forgotten  
Just another mummys boy gone to rotten  
They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod  
But I never thought theyd put me in the  
  
Goon squad
