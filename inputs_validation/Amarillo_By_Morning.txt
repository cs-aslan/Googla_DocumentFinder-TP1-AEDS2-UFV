Amarillo by mornin  
Up from San Antone  
Everything that I got  
Is just what Ive got on  
  
When that sun is high in that Texas sky  
Ill be buckin at the county fair  
Amarillo by mornin  
Amarillo Ill be there  
  
They took my saddle in Houston  
Broke my leg in Santa Fe  
I lost my wife and a girlfriend  
Somewhere along the way  
  
But Ill be lookin for 8 when they pull that gate  
And I hope that judge aint blind  
Amarillo by mornin  
Amarillos on my mind  
  
Amarillo by mornin  
Up from San Antone  
Everything that I got  
Is just what Ive got on  
  
I aint got a dime but what I got is mine  
I aint rich but Lord Im free  
Amarillo by mornin  
Amarillos where Ill be  
  
Amarillo by mornin  
Amarillos where Ill be
