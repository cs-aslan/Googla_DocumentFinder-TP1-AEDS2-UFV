Well I dont know but Ive been told and  
Seen what youve left behind  
And I dont know if I like what I see  
When its knocking at my door  
  
Chorus  
And you dont know if youre laughing or crying  
And I dont know if I care  
Cause I know right here  
Ive got me something that you never had  
You might laugh but what are you looking at  
Sending your own valentines to the one you never had  
  
Well I dont know but Ive been told and  
Seen what youve left behind  
And all those ladies you left standing on the corner  
Theyre laughing at you now  
  
You never had you never had  
So you drink all night and you sleep all day  
Cause you see what youve left behind  
And standing on the corner  hey lady got a quarter  
Shes passing you by  
  
Chorus
