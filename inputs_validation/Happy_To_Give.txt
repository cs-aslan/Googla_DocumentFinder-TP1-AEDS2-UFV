I was born a believer played the fool  
Lonely dreamer left to choose  
I dont know where the love is theres a promise undone  
Someones cryin in a room all alone  
Shadows fall after the hurt is gone  
Through it all we love and we lose  
  
Where is the one someone whos happy happy to give  
Happy to be with you its here you belong with someone  
Whos happy happy to give happy to give you love  
  
A song for the singer one book of dreams  
Take this heartache away from me  
A page in a story romance untold  
Sharing secrets we call our own  
Shadows fall after the hurt is gone  
Through it all we love and we lose  
  
Where is the one someone whos happy happy to give  
Happy to be with you its where you belong with someone  
Whos happy happy to give happy to give you love  
  
Happy happy oh happy  
Happy to give ooo happy to give  
Oh somebodys happy to give you love  
Your love your love oh yeah
