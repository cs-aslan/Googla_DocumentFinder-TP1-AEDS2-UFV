Working on the road across this great big world  
Ive been rolling like a stone I never get back home  
Yes Ive been longgone  
And boy Ive got the Birmingham Blues  
  
Been across the ocean to the south sea isles  
Yeah I travelled to the east and west for mile and miles and miles  
And Ive been longgone  
And boy Ive got the Birmingham Blues  
  
Across the world Ive seen  
People and places  
Could be the same  
But with a different name  
  
I wouldnt change the things I do for anything  
But Id just like to hear the message of the streets again  
Give me a ticket  
Cos boy Ive got the Birmingham Blues  
  
It may be kind of homely but it sure is sweet  
Industrial Revolution put it on its feet  
But its a long long way  
Boy Ive got the Birmingham Blues  
  
Across the world Ive seen  
People and places  
Could be the same  
But with a different name  
  
Ill go and stay awhile and all the folks I meet  
Theyll say You wont stay long you got them travelling feet  
Youll soon be longgone  
Cos boy you got the rest of the world blues  
  
Across the world Ive seen  
People and places  
Could be the same  
But with a different name  
  
Across the world Ive seen  
People and places  
Could be the same  
But with a different name
