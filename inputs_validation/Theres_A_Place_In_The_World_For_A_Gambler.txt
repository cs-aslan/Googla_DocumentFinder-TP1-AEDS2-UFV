Theres a place in the world  
For a gambler  
Theres a burden that only  
He can bear  
Theres a place in the world  
For a gambler  
And he sees  
Oh yes he sees  
And he sees  
Oh yes he sees  
  
Theres a song in the heart  
Of a woman  
That only the truest of loves  
Can release  
Theres a song in the heart  
Of a woman  
Set it free  
Oh set it free  
Set it free  
Oh set it free  
Set it free  
Oh set it free  
  
Theres a light in the depths  
Of your darkness  
Theres a calm at the eye  
Of every storm  
Theres a light in the depths  
Of your darkness  
  
Let is shine  
Oh let it shine  
Let is shine  
Oh let it shine  
Let is shine  
Oh let it shine  
Let it Shine
