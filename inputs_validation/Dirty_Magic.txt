In my own simple way  
I think she wants me only  
She said Come over right away  
But shes just not that way  
Her little soul is stolen  
See her put on her brand new face  
  
Chorus  
Go on and pull the shades  
Razor blades  
Youre so tragic  
Go on I hate you so  
But love you more  
Im so elastic  
Of all the things you say  
The games you play  
Dirty magic stuff  
  
I should know better than to think Id reach inside her  
Its all a cloudy kind of daze  
Shes not so sweet today  
She mocks me Im no fighter  
It all just seems like such a waste  
  
Chorus  
  
Its oversimplified  
Its oversimplified  
Its oversimplified  
  
Chorus
