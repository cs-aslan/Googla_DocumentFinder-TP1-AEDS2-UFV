Caramelcoated pseudo happy  
Call her sticky wicked  
Will she answer agin today or pray that lovell kick it  
Kick it love see her little baby  
Hey girl she dont remember your name  
Kick it love mama gettin busy  
Got no time 4 games  
Sticky wicked  
She just got a pair of tickets to the opera in her mind  
No applause no encore if she dies  
CHORUS  
Kick it love visions of her childhood  
When her heart was gold  
Sticky wicked  
Tell me people what reasons good enough 2  
Die before youre old Kick it love covenants of promise lay before your eyes  
Stick wicked will trick you lick you then it kicks you aside  
CHORUS  
People crashing in the middle of the day  
When you wake up sticky wicked dont go away  
Sticky wicked  
Pretty stick wicked  
Scenario of a mother who cant remember her daughters name  
Hey little baby whats your name
