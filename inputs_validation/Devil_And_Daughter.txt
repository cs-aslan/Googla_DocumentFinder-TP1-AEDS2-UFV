Silence is mocking the dawn of a new day  
Devil and Daughter are both on their way  
The Evil of her nature collects in her eyes  
With him theres no fear of the dawn bringing light  
  
Baptised with fire to wild to be tamed  
Shes hot evil and ready to take any man  
Let no one put asunder the power or the pain  
He is the master of hell riding again  
  
Devil and Daughter  pleasure and pain  
Devil and Daughter  is this the end  
  
A thousand times over youll hear on the wind  
In the name of hell these sinners never sinned  
But Satan never listens to the words that they send  
Drenching the soil with blood when will it end  
  
Devil and Daughter  
Hes got the power shes got the pain  
Devil and Daughter  
Shell break any woman and take any man  
Devil and Daughter  
Hand in hand with the reper
