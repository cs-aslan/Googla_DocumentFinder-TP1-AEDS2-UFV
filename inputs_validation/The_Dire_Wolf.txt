In that September off Isle Aux Morts  
The desultory sea grew more so through the night  
And made one think of tawny ports  
And aspen tremblin in tomorrows thorough light  
And of Tallulah Bankhead and Canada Lee  
Somewhere faroff peaceful sleeping and done with acting  
Past the Dire Wolfs lair on a Newfoundlands paws  
Close to nowhere halfway across  
Never more here expanse getting broader  
Though bigger boats been done by this water  
Though better boats been done by this water  
Though better boats been done by less water  
In that September off Isle Aux Morts  
Colourable seas grew more so through the night  
And made one think of yawnin shores  
Gambier bleached in tomorrows thorough light  
And the Tallulah Bankhead and Canada Lee  
Somewhere faroff peaceful sleeping they learned to love sleep  
At the Dire Wolfs crest the Newfoundland paused  
Desolates best was gotten across  
We were never more here expanse getting broader  
When better boats been done by this water  
At the Dire Wolfs best the Newfoundland paused  
So desperate as to be a lost cause  
You were never more here expanse getting broader  
When better boats been done by this water  
When bigger boats been done by less water  
And better boats been done by this water  
When bigger boats been done by less water  
And better boats been done by this water
