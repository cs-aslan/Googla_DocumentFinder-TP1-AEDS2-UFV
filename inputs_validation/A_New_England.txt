I was twenty one years when I wrote this song  
Im twenty two now but I wont be for long  
People ask when will you grow up to understand  
Why all the girls I knew at school  
Are already pushing prams  
  
I loved you then as I love you still  
Tho I put you on a pedestal  
You put me on the pill  
I dont feel bad about letting you go  
I just feel sad about letting you know  
  
I dont want to change the world  
Im not looking for a new England  
Are you looking for another girl  
I dont want to change the world  
Im not looking for a new England  
Are you looking for another girl  
  
I loved the words you wrote to me  
But that was bloody yesterday  
I cant survive on what you send  
Every time you need a friend  
  
I saw two shooting stars last night  
I wished on them but they were only satellites  
Is it wrong to wish on space hardware  
I wish I wish I wish youd care  
  
I dont want to change the world  
Im not looking for a new England  
Are you looking for another girl
