My tea turned seven shades darker  
As I sit n write these words  
And londons gettin paler  
In my theatre of the absurd  
You figured for an evening  
And you made it all worthwile  
Its seldom people have a job  
And even rarer that I smile  
  
Play me some play me some  
Play me brixton power  
Teach your children to be them  
And never ever ours  
Play me some play me some  
Play me brixton power  
Someone took the park away  
But they left a lonely flower  
  
And if your songs be classics  
Throw them to the hurd  
Truth is where they came from  
And not this theatre of the absurd  
Some say you wanted to play for me  
But its only what youve heard  
That made you want to capture me  
In your theatre of the absurd  
It was not me I said myself  
And you must do so too  
I hope you have the strength to stay  
When Ill be watchin you  
  
So baby  
Play me some play me some  
Play me brixton power  
Teach your children to be them  
And never ever ours  
Play me some play me some  
Play me brixton power  
Someone took the park away  
But they left a lonely flower  
  
Oh when I got here back home tonight  
Something within me stirred  
Oh it must have been a different kind of play  
That touched my theatre of the absurd  
Now Ill be on my way alone  
But an interesting thing occurred  
See nobody ever shared too much  
In my theatre of the absurd  
And there I was back in london  
Thought about history  
It was just like being in school again  
But I felt something movin in me  
Hearin just a bit of the future  
Oh its comin and its still blurred  
And thats the only thing worth living for  
In my theatre of the absurd  
  
Come on  
Play me some play me some  
Play me brixton power  
Teach your children to be them  
And never ever ours  
Oh play me some play me some  
Play me brixton power  
Someone took the park away  
But they left a lonely flower  
  
beautiful  
Play me some play me some  
Play me brixton power  
Play me some play me some  
Play me brixton power  
john come on  
Play me some play me some  
Play me brixton power  
Oh play me some come on eric play me some  
Play me brixton power  
Oh play me some play me some  
Play me brixton power
