between the icecaps of the North Pole  
and the space of America  
theres a country in the middle  
known as Canada  
where the natives all are happy  
and the lakes are fresh and clean  
there is no unemployment  
and no one is mean  
in the summer theres no mosquitoes  
and the winters are never cold  
there is no clear cut logging  
and no ozone hole  
oh Canada your leaders are so swell  
in Canada no one ever goes to hell  
  
no criminals or taxes  
and Visa never phones  
Elvis is alive in Moose Jaw  
but we leave him alone  
cuz were in Canada  
whose army is so strong  
in Canada  
no one has to mow their lawn  
no waiting for the buses  
no standing in a line  
the banks are all nonprofit  
and the dollar flew that 999  
thats American you know  
so shout Canada  
the ports are always fair  
shout Canada  
where mechanics never never swear  
talking  
  
the rednecks and the hippies live in perfect harmony  
growing wheat and marrow together hydroponically  
nobody has binfulls and the sky is so clear  
and when Jesus Christ comes back to earth  
I know hell be born here  
the phone lines are never busy  
and youre never put on hold  
Canadas the country garbed entirely from gold  
oh in Canada  
everyone says please  
in Canada  
no one ever cuts the cheese  
oh Canada  
oh Canada  
the country of love is the country for me  
Canada  
starts with a C
