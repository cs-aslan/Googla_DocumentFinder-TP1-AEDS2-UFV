All is dark  
The moat is dry  
Shadows fall  
The roof lets in the sky  
All these memories  
Go round in my head  
Of the life I have led  
  
Minstrels play  
Familiar melodies  
And once more  
The past comes back to me  
All these memories  
Go round in my head  
Of the life I have led  
  
The grass has grown much taller now  
Over running everything  
Oh oh since Ive been gone  
  
The grass has grown much taller now  
Over running everything  
Oh oh what have I done  
  
The grass has grown much taller now  
Over running everything  
Oh oh since Ive been gone  
  
The grass has grown much taller now  
Over running everything  
Oh oh since Ive been gone  
  
All is dark  
The moat is dry  
Shadows fall  
The roof lets in the sky  
All these memories  
Go round in my head  
Of the life I have led
