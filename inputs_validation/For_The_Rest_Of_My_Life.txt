Look around Do you see  
Everything is fading  
Everything just fades away  
Look around Do you see  
Everyone looks lonely  
But theres only you and me  
  
Do you wonder how we came to be here  
Do you wonder if we could find us from here  
Look inside Do you feel anything but bitter  
Anything but sad and lost  
Look inside Do you dream of a time thats better  
Do you ever dream of me  
And my heart breaks when you cry in your sleep  
So I cant wait here hoping Im something youll keep  
  
I will love you Miss you All of my life  
I will need you Want you All of my life  
But Ive lost you Lost you For the rest of my life
