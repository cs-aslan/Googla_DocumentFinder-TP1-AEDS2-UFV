Ten years ago on a cold dark night  
Someone was killed neath the town hall light  
There were few at the scene but they all agreed  
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me  
  
The judge said son what is your alibi  
If you were somewhere else then you wont have to die  
I spoke not a word thou it meant my life  
For Id been in the arms of my best friends wife  
  
She walks these hills in a long black veil  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail  
Nobody knows nobody sees  
Nobody knows but me  
  
Oh the scaffold is high and eternitys near  
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear  
But late at night when the north wind blows  
In a long black veil she cries ovre my bones
