Everyday I hear a different story  
People saying that youre no good for me  
Saw your lover with another and shes making a fool of you  
  
If you loved me baby youd deny it  
But you laugh and tell me I should try it  
Tell me Im a baby and I dont understand  
  
But you know that Ill forgive you  
Just this once twice forever  
Cause baby you could drag me to hell and back  
Just as long as were together  
And you do  
  
Chorus  
I dont want your freedom  
I dont want to play around  
I dont want nobody baby  
Part time love just brings me down  
I dont want your freedom  
Girl all I want right now is you  
  
Like a prisoner who has his own key  
But I cant escape until you love me  
I just go from day to day knowing all about the other boys  
You take my hand and tell me Im a fool to give you all that I do  
I bet you someday baby someone says the same to you  
But you know that Ill forgive you  
Just this once twice forever  
cause baby you could drag me to hell and back  
Just as long as were together  
And you do  
  
Chorus
