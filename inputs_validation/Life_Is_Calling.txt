I can see it in your eyes  
You dont know what lifes about  
So listen well  
For I will tell  
  
Life is calling out  
So whats it gonna be  
Hes calling out  
So wake up get up  
Life is calling out  
Dont waste it on your fears  
Hes calling out  
Cant you hear Him calling  
  
Hes the way the truth and life  
And He came down to gave His life  
So you might live  
Yeah you might live  
  
Im not here to judge your life  
I just want you to realize  
That Hes the way the truth and life  
His sacrifice is the ultimate price  
So wont you listen and listen well  
Jesus Christ is the one and only life  
  
Open up your heart and let Him in  
Cant you hear Him calling out your name
