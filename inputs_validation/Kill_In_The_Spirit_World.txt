Theres something wrong theres a chill in the air  
And the blood in my veins running colder  
The Eastern sky is beginning to silver  
And the words that you speak start to falter  
The seal is broken the oath has been crossed  
In the house of the dead theres a taker  
Some say that this is the ultimate sin  
When the spirit world turns to the alter  
  
Theres been a kill in the spirit world  
Theres been a kill in the spirit world  
  
Behold the dead clutching at fading hands out of reach forever  
In glory die calls the voice from the void  
You assasin has cursed every spectre  
The seal is broken the oath has been crossed  
And the house of the dead seeks the master  
Stretching every muscle I wait for the end  
And the kiss on the wind whispers murder murder  
  
Theres been a kill in the spirit world  
Theres been a kill in the spirit world  
Theres been a kill in the spirit world  
  
When heaven is closer its pleasure and pain  
Blood kill in the spirit world ah  
  
Did ya see another in black  
Is the blood in your veins running colder  
If ya did then theres no turing back  
As the spirit world turns to the alter  
The seal is broken the oath has been crossed  
And the house of the dead seeks the master  
Stretching every muscle I wait for the end  
And a kiss on the wind whispers murder  
  
Theres been a kill in the spirit world  
Theres been a kill in the spirit world  
  
Oh here it comes no no nooh oh  
Your seal is broken the Eastern sky is beginning to silver oh oh oh  
Theres something wrong theres a chill in the air ah  
You feel the evil I feel the evil  
Oh somebody whispers murder  
  
A kiss on the wind whispers murder
