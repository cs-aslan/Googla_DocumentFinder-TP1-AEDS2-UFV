Oh where are you now  
Pussy willow that smiled on my sleeve  
When I was alone you promised a stone from your heart  
My head kissed the ground  
I was half the way down treading the sand  
Pleaseplease lift a hand Im only a person  
Whose armbands beat on his hands hang tall  
Wont you miss me Why dont you miss me at all  
My head touched the ground I was half the way down  
Strumming the sand  
Please lift a hand Im only a person  
With Eskimo chain you tattered my brain all the way  
Wont you miss me Why dont you miss me at all
