I think Ive got a crush on Celine Dion  
The way she beats her chest when she sings a love song  
Theres something about her makes me want to feed her  
And Id love to be Mister Celine Dion  
Shell sing a song in English and shell sing en francais  
Both the songs will suck but I love her anyway  
Shes full of emotion Im full of devotion  
For Celine and Ill be hers someday  
Oh Celine Dion you softrock my world  
Wont you please be mine Celine  
I would do anything if youd be my girl  
Oh be my girl Celine  
I sent you cards and letters but you dont respond  
You play hard to get but my heart goes on and on and on and on etc  
I just wanna say je aimerez  
And I can see your house from my van  
Oh Celine Dion you softrock my world  
Wont you please be mine Celine  
I would do anything if youd be my girl  
Oh be my girl Celine  
Celine Celine  
Her skins so soft and clean  
Just like porcelain  
I wish shed slather me  
With a tub of Vaseline  
That was a little creepy Im sorry Celine  
Celine Celine  
Celine Dion
