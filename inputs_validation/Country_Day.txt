Country day  
A day in the unknown  
A gentle breeze gently blown  
Country day  
  
Country day  
Another day in the unknown  
I can feel it in my bones  
Country day  
  
Where mister misses smoke  
And things are finally clicking  
Still having trouble with the things that are meaningful  
But yeah really clicking  
  
Our dreams are where were at  
Where we can see and touch  
With work we understand  
But we dont want for much  
  
Country day  
A day in the unknown  
A gentle breeze gently blown  
Country day  
  
Country day  
Another day in the unknown  
I can feel it in my bones  
Country day  
  
You infiltrate my life  
You resonate with meaning  
I wrote I Love You on a rock one night  
Threw it never dreaming  
  
Now our dreams are where were at  
What we can feel and touch  
Its work we understand  
 The Tragically Hip Lyrics are found on wwwsonglyricscom   
But we dont want for much  
  
Country day  
A day in the unknown  
A gentle breeze gently blows  
Country day  
  
Country day  
Another day in the unknown  
I can feel it deep in my bones  
Country day  
  
And that rock it missed your head  
Though it didnt miss by much  
I remember what you said  
No I mean it I am touched  
And somehow it is enough  
  
So God keep our land  
Cause we certainly cant  
Until the darkness ends  
Until the sun dries again  
  
Our dreams are where were at  
What we can smell and touch  
Work we understand  
We dont want too much  
  
Country day  
A day in the unknown  
Where theyd been where were going  
Country day  
  
Country day  
Another day in the unknown  
Gently drawn to a close  
Country day
