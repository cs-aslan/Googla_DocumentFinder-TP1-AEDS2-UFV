Pork roll egg and cheese on a kaiser bun  
  
I met her at the Living Earth Show  
She crossed the room the lights sank low  
Were together she really digs me she fucks me  
Who would think I could be so happy  
When Im cold I know shes keepin me warm  
Were together she really digs me she fucks me  
  
Shes in my arms shes in my heart yeah  
Pins and needles up and down my spine  
Were together she really digs me now  
She fucks me she fucks me
