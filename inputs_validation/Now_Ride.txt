Yeah yeah haha haha  
Yeah uh uhhuhuh  
Uh uhhuhuh  
Uh uhhuhuh uh  
  
Niggaz aint gon be happy till I click on a rage  
Pick up a gauge and its my face that they stick on front page  
Gotta be careful I could pull a thick of the age  
Chick on the stage and winde up sick in a cage  
  
When I come through its usually in Dickies thats beige  
Pushing a Eleanor like Im Nicholas Cage  
And its funny how a few bucks can  
Get you put under a white sheet like you in the Ku Klux Klan  
  
Its Street Fam for life we ride to the death  
We play hard dog dont cry to the rest  
I dont know you please move to the left  
Or stay here and get introduced to the tefs  
  
Im riding till the wheels come off it yeah  
Grindin till a mil come off it yeah  
This is my plate I eat every meal from off it  
Why whyall try and steal crumbs off it jump  
  
Chorus  
Now ride Top down chrome rims spinnin and  
Now ride Gun cock hollows in the clip now  
Now ride Chop rocks put it on a strip now  
Now ride whyall know Street Family gon ride  
Now ride Top down chrome rims spinnin and  
Now ride Gun cock hollows in the clip now  
Now ride Chop rocks put it on a strip now  
Now ride whyall know Street Family gon ride  
  
Now when I spray wit the sauer I gotta spend a day wit the lawyer  
Worryin bout who say that saw ya  
Keep yay wit the oyers two kids on the block  
Like when Mourning and Mutumbo used to play wit the Hoyas  
  
Ima boss that you can never upstand  
Or get a red dot on you like a 7Up can  
Some of whyall caught feelings from way back  
Others waited till I came through short willing the Maybach  
  
But Im still bucking like five duce four trey  
Still tucking and letting the fo spray  
Still ducking where ever the pos lay  
And still fucking and making them hoes say WHOA  
  
And I know Feds seen  
The old school Chevy with the dope head lean  
whyall love the way I areIDE  
Call my DE and put you on a RIPT ghetto  
  
Chorus
