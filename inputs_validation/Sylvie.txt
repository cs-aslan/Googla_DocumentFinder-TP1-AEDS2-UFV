Sylvie  
Im so hotn dry  
Sylvie  
Sylvie  
Cant you hear  
Cant you hear me crying  
Bring me little water Sylvie  
Bring me little water out  
Bring me little water Sylvie  
Every little once in a while  
Sylvie says she loves me  
But I believe she lies  
She hasnt been to see me  
Since the last day in july  
Sylvie  
Sylvie  
Im so hotn dry  
Sylvie  
Sylvie  
Cant you hear  
Cant you hear me crying  
Bring me little water Sylvie  
Bring me little water out  
Bring me little water Sylvie  
Every little once in a while  
She brought me a little coffee  
She brought me a little tea  
Well she brought me nearly every damned thing  
But she didnt bring the jailhouse key  
Sylvie  
Sylvie  
Im so hotn dry

Sylvie  
Little drink of water  
Wouldnt statisfy me  
Bring me little water Sylvie  
Bring me little water out  
Bring me little water Sylvie  
Every little once in a while  
Took a look ayonder  
What is that I see  
Well I thought it was little Sylvie  
Hopprunning there for me

Im so hot and dry

Bring me little water Sylvie  
Bring me little water out  
Bring me little water Sylvie  
Every little once in a while  
Every little once in a while  
Every  
Little once  
In a while
