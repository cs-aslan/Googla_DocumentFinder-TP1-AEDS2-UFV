If it takes forever I will wait for you  
For a thousand summers I will wait for you  
Till youre back beside me till Im holding you  
Till I hear you sigh here in my arms  
  
Anywhere you wander anywhere you go  
Every day remember how I love you so  
In your heart believe what in my heart I know  
That forevermore I will wait for you  
  
The clock will tick away the hours one by one  
Then the time will come when all the waitings done  
The time when you return and find me here and run  
Straight to my waiting arms  
  
If it takes forever I will wait for you  
For a thousand summers I will wait for you  
Till youre here beside me till Im touching you  
And forevermore sharing your love
