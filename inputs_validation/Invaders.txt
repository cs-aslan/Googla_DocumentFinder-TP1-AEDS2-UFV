Longboats have been sighted the evidence of war has begun  
Many Nordic fighting men their swords and shields all gleam in the sun  
Call to arms defend yourselves get ready to stand and fight for your lives  
Judgment day has come around so be prepared dont run stand your ground  
  
Theyre coming in from the sea  
Theyve come the enemy  
Beneath the blazing sun  
The battle has to be won  
Invaders pillaging  
Invaders looting  
  
Set ablaze the campfires alert the other men from inland  
Warning must be given theres not enough men here for a stand  
The Vikings are too many much too powerful to take on our own  
We must have reinforcements we cannot fight this battle alone  
  
Theyre coming over the hill  
Theyve come to attack  
Theyre coming in for the kill  
Theres no turning back  
Invaders  
Fighting  
Invaders  
Marauding  
  
Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground  
Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around  
The smell of death and burning flesh the battle weary fight to the end  
The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen  
  
Youd better scatter and run  
The battles lost and not won  
Youd better get away to fight another day  
Invaders  
Raping  
Invaders  
Plundering
