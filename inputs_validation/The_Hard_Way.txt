Mannnnn  
Theres a whale outta water  
Whoaaaa  
Theres a bone on a string  
Doing everything the hard way x2  
Stilllll  
Theres  for the wicked  
 weakkneed and   
Go to pale the hard way x2  
Sort it out in the animal sea  
The factor of the human pride  
The place where I was born  
The place where my father died  
Past the police theres an army  
Marching like stone guards from Hell  
Into the wishing well the hard way  
Wishing well the hard way  
Doing everything the hard way x7  
Were doing everything the hard way
