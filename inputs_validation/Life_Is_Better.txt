Life is filled with gray  
But now he comes to me  
Please fall away  
Hip hop is playing again  
And its bangin too  
Gonna bang for you  
Dont stop this feeling I feel  
I just wanna run out all day for you  
And breathe for you at least  
Im so into your rich history  
Tell me a story and take me away  
Cmon and take me ooh  
Cmon and take me with you  
  
Life is better  
Now that now that Ive found you
