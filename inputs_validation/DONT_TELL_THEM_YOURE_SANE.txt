A boy I know is sick in his head  
At least thats what the doctors say he is  
Shut in his room for hours on end  
Looks like hes forgotten but is he  
His mind it ticks more than you know  
One day something in his head will click  
Warders fill him full of lies he fights he knows  
Theyll never convince him that hes mad  
At breakfast he is strapped in a chair wont go far  
Just a word out of place hes sent to his room  
Dont tell them youre sane  
Theyll laugh and put you to sleep  
Dont tell them youre sane but you are  
Tell me what you did today was it good  
What was it like and who was it with  
Dont think Im prying Id just like to know  
Why it is you do things so slow  
Take him to the doctor see what he says  
I dont know why he bothers hes in for good
