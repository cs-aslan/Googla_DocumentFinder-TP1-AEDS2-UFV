We got licked just a bit right outside the show  
The T stripped then your manners flew right out the door  
Its like this who you keep texting on the phone  
Its like that Im not the only one with whoops to owe  
Its automatic dont you point your finger at me  
Its so tragic you should be a Kennedy  
Its automatic pulling me like gravity  
Youre putting me down pulling me down six feet  
Hate me hate me  
Tell me what thought would make you break me break me  
Go on and shatter me cause lately you run me into the ground  
And you can hate me hate me  
Call it a victory but youll see lately not going easily  
Cause Im not falling down and you wont get the best of me now  
A fat lip finger flip and an insult to go  
The record skips you got issues like a girl in porn  
Its like this you act crazy from tour to four  
Its like that I cant take all of the blame no more  
Its automatic dont you point your finger at me  
Its so tragic you should be a Kennedy  
Its automatic pulling me like gravity  
Youre putting me down pulling me down six feet  
Hate me hate me  
Tell me what thought would make you break me break me  
Go on and shatter me cause lately you run me into the ground  
And you can hate me hate me  
Call it a victory but youll see lately not going easily  
Cause Im not falling down and you wont get the best of me now  
I didnt wanna get into another battle hey hey  
I didnt wanna make the claws and bones rattle hey hey  
I didnt wanna get into another battle hey hey  
Its automatic how you throw it all away  
So hate me now  
You cant break me down  
So just hate me now  
You cant break me down  
And you can hate me hate me  
Tell me what thought would make you break me break me  
Go on and shatter me cause lately you run me into the ground  
And you can hate me hate me  
Call it a victory but youll see lately not going easily  
Cause Im not falling down and you wont get the best of me now  
Its automatic hey hey  
Its so tragic hey hey  
Its automatic
