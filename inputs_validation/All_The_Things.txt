International sensation you know  
And Mister Worldwide dale  
  
Im like a quarterback I got options  
But I played the point in school  
Broke ankles more than a few  
Broke hearts yeah that too  
20 Years later same movie same script  
Same player more chips more women more haters  
Different toilet same shh  
Why get caught up in the motions  
Why go through the same emotions  
In a sick way she love to see me mad  
It gets her wetter than the ocean  
Shes a good girl gone bad  
But bad girls dont like good guys  
Now tell me if you think Im a good guy  
Thats what I thought huh lets ride  
  
All the things you do all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me said  
Now Im lonely in my bed  
  
All the things you do all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me said  
Now Im lonely in my bed  
  
Woo  
  
They act hard but they got soft hearts  
And I know theyre soft spots  
I meet them I greet them I train them  
And show them all about hard knocks  
Listen next thing you know next thing you know  
They holding the fort down like Fort Knox Fort Knox  
Then they fall in love and make everything seem what is not  
Damn these are called rules of engagement  
Welcome to the world of entertainment  
They dont want a man like Reeman  
They want a man thats stuck in the remains  
I know its ironic but the good girls like bad guys  
Now tell me do you think Im a good guy  
Thats what I thought now lets ride  
  
Woo  
  
All the things you do all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me said  
Now Im lonely in my bed  
  
All the things you do all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me said  
Now Im lonely in my bed  
  
Woo  
  
All the things you do all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me said  
Now Im lonely in my bed
