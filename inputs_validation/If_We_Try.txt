When I see you on the street I lose my concentration  
Just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation  
  
Wont you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you ought
to know  
Well Ive been thinkin about you day and night  
And I dont know if itll work out right  
But somehow I think that it just might if we try  
  
Faces come and faces go in circular rotation  
But something yearns within to grow beyond infatuation  
  
Wont you look my way once before you go  
And my eyes will say what you ought to know  
Well youve got me standin deaf and blind  
Cause I see love as just a state of mind  
And who knows what it is that we might find if we try  
  
Youre walking a different direction from most people Ive met  
Youre givin me signs of affection I dont usually get  
I dont want you to pledge your future the futures not yours to give  
Just stand there a little longer and let me watch while you live  
  
Cause when I see you on the street I lose my concentration  
And just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation  
  
Wont you look my way once before you go  
And my eyes will say what you ought to know  
Well Ive been thinking about you day and night  
And I dont know if it will work out right  
But somehow I think that it just might if we try  
Somehow I think that it just might if we try  
Yes somehow I think that it just might if we try
