Dead man lying on the bottom of the grave  
Wondering when savior comes is he gonna be saved  
Maybe youre a sinner into your alternate life  
Maybe youre a joker  
Maybe you deserve to die  
  
They were crying when their sons left  
God is wearing black  
Hes gone so far to find no hope hes never coming back  
They were crying when their sons left  
All young men must go  
Hes come so far to find the truth hes never going home  
  
Young men standing on the top of their own graves  
Wondering when Jesus comes are they gonna be saved  
Cruelty to the winner bishop tells the king his lies  
Maybe youre a mourner  
Maybe you deserve to die  
  
They were crying when their sons left  
God is wearing black  
Hes gone so far to find no hope hes never coming back  
They were crying when their sons left  
All young men must go  
Hes come so far to find the truth hes never going home  
  
Welcome to the soldier side  
Where theres no one here but me  
People all grow up to die  
There is no one here but me  
Welcome to the soldier side  
Where theres no one here but me  
People on the soldier side  
There is no one here but me
