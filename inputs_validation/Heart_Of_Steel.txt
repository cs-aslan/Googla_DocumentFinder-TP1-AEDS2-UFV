Build a fire a thousand miles away  
To light my long way home  
I ride a comet  
My trail is long to stay  
Silence is a heavy stone  
I fight the world and take all they can give  
There are times my heart hangs low  
Born to walk against the wind  
Born to hear my name  
No matter where I stand Im alone  
  
Stand and fight  
Live by your heart  
Always one more try  
Im not afraid to die  
Stand and fight  
Say what you feel  
Born with a heart of steel  
  
Burn the bridge behind you  
Leave no retreat  
Theres only one way home  
Those who laugh and crowd the path  
And cut each others throats  
Will fall like melting snow  
Theyll watch us rise with fire in our eyes  
Theyll bow their heads  
Their hearts will hang low  
Then well laugh and they will kneel  
And know this heart of steel was  
Too hard to break  
Too hard to hold  
  
Stand and fight  
Live by your heart  
Always one more try  
Im not afraid to die  
Stand and fight  
Say what you feel  
Born with a heart of steel
