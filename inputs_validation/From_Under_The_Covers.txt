Its 600am and even Big Ben  
Is trying to get his head down for a kip  
But no sooner is it down  
And then its on with dressing gown  
For this city very rarely loses grip  
  
But I have a friend whos never up by 1000  
Hes fast asleep with mouth open wide  
Hes lost a lot of jobs but hes won a lot of friends  
And he says to me he cannot tell the time  
  
Its 700am and were coughing up the phlegm  
Spitting out the taste of night before  
And well vomit and well choke  
Just to climb their tatty rope  
Well this city has its charm and its claw  
  
And hell blame his clock  
Or hell say hes lost his socks  
And theyll tell you that hes been bitten by a snake  
His excuses are an art  
From the bottom of his heart  
And he thinks of them whenever he awakes  
  
Its 800am were on the road again  
Racing for a placing at the top  
And it says green for go  
For the people in the know  
But for the others all it says is red for stop  
  
Its cold and its damp  
And theyve dug him a grave  
And the 1015 merchants still in bed  
And scrawled upon the headboard  
For the whole wide world to see  
Died In The Arms Of Big Ted
