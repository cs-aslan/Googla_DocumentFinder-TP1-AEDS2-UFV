Oooohooh  
  
I feel like Im a million miles away from myself  
More and more these days  
Ive been down so many open roads  
But they never lead me home  
And now I just dont know  
  
Who I really am  
How its gonna be  
Is there something that I cant see  
I wanna understand  
  
Chorus  
Maybe I will never be  
Who I was before  
Maybe I dont even know her anymore  
Maybe who I am today  
Aint so far from yesterday  
Can I find a way to be  
Every part of me  
  
So Ill try try to sort things down  
And find myself get my feet back on the ground  
Itll take time but I know Ill be alright  
Cause nothing much has changed  
On the inside  
  
Its hard to figure out  
How its gonna be  
Cause I dont really know  
I wanna understand  
  
Chorus  
Maybe I will never be who I was before  
Maybe I dont even know her anymore  
Maybe who I am today  
Aint so far from yesterday  
Can I find a wa to be  
Every part of me yeah  
  
Bridge  
I dont wanna wait too long  
To find out where Im meant to belong  
Ive always wanted to be where I am today  
But I never thought Id feel this way  
  
Chorus  
Maybe I will never be who I was before  
Maybe I dont even know her anymore  
Maybe who I am today  
Aint so far from yesterday  
Can I find a way to be  
Every part of me  
  
Every part of me
