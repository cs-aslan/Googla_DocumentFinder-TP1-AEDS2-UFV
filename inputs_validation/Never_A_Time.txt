There is never a time to say  
Cause it seems to me weve lost our way  
So we carry on down the road  
And we live our lives haunted by  
All the things we say and do  
Keep on missing when Im alone with you  
  
No theres never a time to change  
You dont get a chance to rearrange  
Its a long long way to go  
Just to find out something we both know  
Cant you see whats going on  
Its so sad that a love so strong has gone  
  
All I know is what is true  
All I ask is for you to  
Just look around and see  
  
You live your life locked in a dream  
  
Where nothing is real and not what it seems  
We cant go on another day  
Just being afraid to say  
  
Its a long long way to fall  
When we both thought we had it all  
Well you know its the time to say  
Cause were all played out weve lost our way  
Oh Id hoped that you would  
Be oh so understanding  
And by now youd see but oh no  
So sad so sad thats the way that it goes  
I know Im gonna tell you right now
