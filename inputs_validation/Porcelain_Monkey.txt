He was an accident waiting to happen  
Most accidents happen at home  
Maybe he should have gone out more often  
Maybe he should have answered the phone  
  
Hipshakin shoutin in gold lame  
Thats how he earned his regal sobriquet  
Then he threw it all away  
For a porcelain monkey  
  
He threw it away for a porcelain monkey  
Gave it all up for a figureine  
He traded it in for a night in Las Vegas  
And his face of velveteen  
  
From a shotgun shack singing Pentacostal hymns  
Through the wrought iron gate to the TV room  
He had a little world it was smaller than your hand  
Its a rockabilly ride from the glitter to the gloom  
  
Left behind by the latest trends  
Eatin friend chicking with his regicidal friends  
Thats how the story ends  
With a porcelain monkey  
  
He threw it away for a porcelain monkey  
Gave it all up for a figureine  
He traded it in for a night in Las Vegas  
And his face of velveteen  
  
Hipshakin shoutin in gold lame  
Thats how he earned his regal sobriquet  
Then he threw it all away  
For a porcelain monkey  
  
He threw it away for a porcelain monkey  
Gave it all up for a figureine  
He traded it in for a night in Las Vegas  
And his face of velveteen
