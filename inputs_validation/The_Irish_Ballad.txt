Now Id like to turn to the folk song which has become in recent years the
particularly fashionable form of idiocy among the selfstyled intellectual we
find that people who deplore the level  
Rrent popular songs  although I admit they do seem to be recording almost
anything these days have you heard sesue hayakawas record of remember pearl
harbor these same people who deplore th  
El of current popular songs and yet will sit around enthralled singing jimmy
crack corn and I dont care or green grow the rushes oh  whatever that
means at any rate for this elite I have  
An ancient irish ballad which was written a few years ago and which is
replete with all the accoutrements of this art form in particular it has a
sort of idiotic refrain in this case ricket  
Ketytin youll notice cropping up from time to time running through I might
add interminable verses the large number of verses being a feature expressly
designed to please the true devotees  
He folk song who seem to find  
Singing fifty verses of on top of old smokey is twice as enjoyable as singing
twentyfive  
  
This type of song also has what is known technically in music as a modal tune
which means  for the benefit of any layman who may have wandered in this
evening  that I play a wrong note ever  
And then  
piano  
This song though does differ strikingly from the genuine folk ballad in that
in this song the words which are supposed to rhyme  actually do  
piano  
I ah I really should say that  I do not direct these remarks against the
vast army of folk song lovers but merely against that peculiar hard core who
seem to equate authenticity with artisti  
It and illiteracy with charm  
piano  
Oh one more thing one of the more important aspects of public folk singing
is audience participation and this happens to be a good song for group
singing so if any of you feel like joining I  
H me on this song Id appreciate it if you would leave  right now  
  
About a maid Ill sing a song  
Sing ricketyticketytin  
About a maid Ill sing a song  
Who didnt have her family long  
Not only did she do them wrong  
She did evryone of them in them in  
She did evryone of them in  
  
One morning in a fit of pique  
Sing ricketyticketytin  
One morning in a fit of pique  
She drowned her father in the creek  
The water tasted bad for a week  
And we had to make do with gin with gin  
We had to make do with gin  
  
Her mother she could never stand  
Sing ricketyticketytin  
Her mother she cold never stand  
And so a cyanide soup she planned  
The mother died with a spoon in her hand  
And her face in a hideous grin a grin  
Her face in a hideous grin  
  
She set her sisters hair on fire  
Sing ricketyticketytin  
She set her sisters hair on fire  
And as the smoke and flame rose highare  
Danced around the funeral pyre  
Playin a violin olin  
Playin a violin  
  
She weighted her brother down with stones  
Ricketyticketytin  
She weighted her brother down with stones  
And sent him off to davy jones  
All they ever found were some bones  
And occasional pieces of skin of skin  
Occasional pieces of skin  
  
One day when she had nothing to do  
Sing ricketyticketytin  
One day when she had nothing to do  
She cut her baby brother in two  
And served him up as an irish stew  
And invited the neighbors in bors in  
Invited the neighbors in  
  
And when at last the police came by  
Sing ricketyticketytin  
And when at last the police came by  
Her little pranks she did not deny  
To do so she would have had to lie  
And lying she knew was a sin a sin  
Lying she knew was a sin  
  
My tragic tale I wont prolong  
Ricketyticketytin  
My tragic tale I wont prolong  
And if you do not enjoy the song  
Youve yourselves to blame if its too long  
You should never have let me begin begin  
You should never have let me begin
