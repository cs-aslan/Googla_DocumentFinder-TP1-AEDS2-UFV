Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm  
Or led a lion through a busy street bazaar  
There are many things Id love to turn you on to  
But somehow I feel theyre safer where they are  
  
Well some people in bound infatuation  
While some others spell depression as the law  
Someones mother getting no imagination  
So beware then baby sin is at everyones door  
  
Dont be the man I know with no expressions lord  
Aint got none at all  
Pity the man I know with no expressions lord  
Aint got none at all  
  
But youll never no youll never see this man laughing  
Come to think of it Ive never seen this man cry  
But you might by sitting quietly hear him singing  
By and by hell stop and sigh  
His voice will even start to speak and he will say goodbye  
  
Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm

There are many things Id love to turn you on to
