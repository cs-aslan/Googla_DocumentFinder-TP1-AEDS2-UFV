Hey Robbie are you ready for

You know that

I was born long ago  
I am the chosen Im the one  
I have come to save the day  
And I wont leave until Im done  
So thats why youve got to try  
You got to breath and have some fun  
Though Im not paid I play this game  
And I wont stop until Im done  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way  
And I got to got to know  
  
I don t know why we always cry  
This we must leave and get undone  
We havent changed and rearranged  
And turn this planet back to one  
So tell me why we got to die  
And kill each other one by one  
weve got to love and rubadub  
Weve got to dance and fall in love  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way  
And I got to got to know  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way  
And I got to got to know got to know
