When we die is it just like sleeping  
Does the light mean that its light like in air  
Will I dream Will I get to meet Jesus  
Or like the lover will I come right back  
  
Years go fast live each day like its the last  
Need not waste time asking why did my life  
No holding back  
  
Like a wind weve been solved  
We sing to the memories of long days  
Gone so do I sing along Ill remember you  
  
Years go fast Im already looking back  
Me I know I wont last cause when I cry I dont just cry  
I fold in half  
  
You are loved you are loved  
You are loved you are loved  
You are loved you are loved  
  
Theres a fear about leaving here  
That the devil you will find but if love  
If love is all there ever was  
Therell be peace on the other side  
  
Years go fast live each day like its the last  
Me Ill go out dancing cause when I die  
I know Im gonna fly into an angels hands  
  
You are loved you are loved  
You are loved you are loved  
You are loved you are loved  
You are loved
