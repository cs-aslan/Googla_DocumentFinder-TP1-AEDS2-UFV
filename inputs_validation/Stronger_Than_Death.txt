Hunt me down seek me out bring your best  
Thats how I want it to be  
Full of doubt full of fear alls unclear  
Its over cause now I can see  
Like a tank seething strength crushing all  
Pulling you under my treads  
Lost some years lost some days thats okay  
I piss on whats in my way  
Your twofaced abusin  
Mindless confusion resolution  
I feel Im breathing my first breath  
Manipulation dyin salvation  
Youll never rest  
You cant kill whats stronger than death  
Your twofaced abusin  
Mindless confusion resolution  
I feel Im breathing my first breath  
Manipulation dyin salvation  
Youll never rest  
You cant kill whats stronger than death  
Looked inside found myself it was me  
Waitin there at the well  
If youre green you aint seen lifes a game  
Sometimes its just hard to tell  
Gouging eyes breakin bones eatin flesh  
Puts a smile on my face  
Crawlin through glass eatin nails losin blood  
Its all part of findin your place  
Your twofaced abusin  
Mindless confusion resolution  
I feel Im breathing my first breath  
Manipulation dyin salvation  
Youll never rest  
You cant kill whats stronger than death
