O I never asked to be your mountain  
I never asked to fly  
Remember when you came to me  
And told me of his lies  
You didnt understand my love  
You dont know why I try  
And the rain was falling on that day  
And damn the reason why  
  
The Flying Pisces sails for time  
And tells me of my child  
Wrapped in bitter tales and heartache  
He begs for just a smile  
O he never asked to be her mountain  
He never asked to fly  
And through his eye he comes his love  
And tells her not to cry  
  
She says Your scoundrel father flies  
With a dancer called a queen  
And with her stolen cards he plays  
And laughs but never wins  
O the child dreams to be his hands  
In the counting of the rain  
But only barren breasts he feels  
For her milk will never drain  
  
As I die I cant remember  
Where I saw the rain  
Could it be that her laughter  
Drove me down again  
Charming dancer will you stop  
Stop and talk to me  
Is there someone else you feel  
In your dreams you will you see  
In midnight gazes  
Ive found you far from me  
If you lead me on  
Please leave me down  
  
O Flying Flying Fish  
Please flutter by my door  
Yes you can drink my lies  
If first you read my eyes  
Each one is titled  
Im drowning back to you  
I cant swim your waters  
And you cant walk my lands  
Im sailing all my sins  
And Im climbing all my fears  
And soon now Ill fly  
  
O I never asked to be your mountain  
I never asked to fly  
Remember when you came to me  
And told me of his lies  
You didnt understand my love  
You dont know why I try  
And the rain was falling on that day  
And thats the reason why  
  
Sweet lover will you come back  
And love me for a while  
Please take my hand  
Leave all your fears behind  
  
Ive been gone too long  
Now Im home to stay  
Please dont leave me  
Again this way  
  
Please come home
