Those lives were mine to love and cherish  
To guard and guide along lifes way  
Oh God forbid that one should perish  
That one alas should go astray  
Back in the years with all together  
Around the place wed romp and play  
So lonely now I oft times wonder  
Oh will they come back home some day  
  
Im lonesome for my precious children  
They live so far away  
Oh may they hear my calling calling  
and come back home some day  
  
I gave my all for my dear children  
Their problems still with love I share  
Id brave lifes storm defy the tempest  
To bring them home from anywhere  
I lived my life my love I gave them  
to guide them through this world of strife  
I hope and pray well live together  
In that great glad here after life  
  
Im lonesome for my precious children  
They live so far away  
Oh may they hear my calling calling  
and come back home some day
