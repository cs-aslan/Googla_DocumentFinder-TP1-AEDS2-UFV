You can move along  
I believe that we are done  
Whatever we was trying to do  
Cause you up and did me wrong  
Cupid got a big gun but a blindfold  
She gave another brother access to her little black dress  
You know the one short silky and backless  
You need an Oscar as she was an actress  
I called and met someone into the mattress  
Now shes lying to my face  
Eyes burning up like her words was mace  
I dont even hear what she was trying say  
Song playing in my head irreplaceable  
To the lies Im deaf  
All I can here is to the left to the left  
So I say get out and dont touch that jacket  
Your stuff I already packed it  
Im being polite  
I dont wanna be rude I dont mean to be mean but I dont gotta deal with
this mess  
Telling me I need you when you know you need me  
But if thats how you feel you can just  
Move along move along move along move along  
No argument no fight  
Move along move along move along move along  
Im just trying to be polite  
And if I seem a bit chill  
Its because I dont sweat the small  
Find another girl please believe I will  
I aint tripping off you at all  
A boss from the beginning  
Been there for a minute  
So me losing you was me still me winning  
Found out about you sinning  
So you wonder what the hell Im dreaming  
Now youre lying to my face  
Eyes burning up like her words was mace  
I dont even hear what youre was trying say  
Song playing in my head irreplaceable  
To the lies Im deaf  
All I can here is to the left to the left  
So I say get out and dont touch that jacket  
Your stuff I already packed it  
Im being polite  
I dont wanna be rude I dont mean to be mean but I dont gotta deal with
this mess  
Telling me I need you when you know you need me  
But if thats how you feel you can just  
Move along move along move along move along  
No argument no fight  
Move along move along move along move along  
Im just trying to be polite  
Please dont get me wrong  
Baby understand Im trying to say get gone the nicest way I can  
Cause Im not what you want  
See I tried to make this work but our loves in the dirt so lets see who calls
who first  
Im moving along  
I dont wanna be rude I dont mean to be mean  
Telling me I need you when you know you need me  
Move along move along move along move along  
No argument no fight  
Move along move along move along move along  
Im just trying to be polite  
I dont wanna be rude I dont mean to be mean but I dont gotta deal with
this mess  
Telling me I need you when you know you need me  
But if thats how you feel you can just  
Move along move along move along move along  
No argument no fight  
Move along move along move along move along  
Im just trying to be polite
