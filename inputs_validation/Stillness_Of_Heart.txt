Im out here on the street  
Theres no one left to meet  
The things that were so sweet  
No longer move my feet  
But I keep trying  
I keep on trying  
  
All that I want is  
Stillness of heart  
So I can start  
To find my way  
Out of the dark  
And into your heart  
  
I got more than I can eat  
A life that cant be beat  
Yet still I feel this heat  
Im feeling incomplete  
What am I buying  
My soul is crying  
  
All that I want is  
Stillness of heart  
So I can start  
To find my way  
Out of the dark  
And into your heart  
  
Wheres the love  
What is this world we live in  
Wheres the love   
Weve got to keep on giving  
Wheres the love   
What happened to forgiving   
Anyone   
  
All that I want is  
Stillness of heart  
So I can start  
To find my way  
Out of the dark  
And into your heart
