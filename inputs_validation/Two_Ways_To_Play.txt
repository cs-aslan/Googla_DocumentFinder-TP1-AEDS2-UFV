Something crossed my mind again and you were in my eyes  
It was somewhere Ive already been  
Tellin all those lies  
But Ive been there and youve been there and there aint no mistake  
We could take it anyway  
But there one thing you can say  
Theres just two ways to play  
Just two ways to play  
I dont want to stay  
Theres just two ways to play and I want to play it right this time  
  
Theres always the easy numbers theres those hard ways too  
theres those cheaters numbers  
Its either one of two  
But fortune tellins mesmerizin and the game of chance  
Rollin dice aint sympathizin when you play romance  
Theres just two ways to play  
Just two ways to play  
I dont want to stay  
Theres just two ways to play  
  
I cant control the numbers cant control your sexy ways  
I cant control my inner thunder it makes me wander round for days  
  
Two ways to play  
Theres just two ways to play  
Theres just two ways to play  
Theres just two ways to play Im gonna play it right this time  
Theres two ways to play  
Theres just two ways to play  
Two ways to play  
Theres just two ways to play  
  
And I dont want to stay  
Theres just two ways to play
