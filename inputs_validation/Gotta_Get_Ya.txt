Verse 2Oh Oh Canada Oh Canada  
I notice my cookies dont crumble  
Whats up its got me on from Toronto  
My favourite bond on the stereo  
You know it is fallin  
Pop broad our first day in New York  
Pardon Gees how we shoulda may cause  
Sad look like shoulda play sports  
Deserve double lubba tons I bought  
I prayed ever meet again to the lord  
But then I ran out just wanna respect  
Not a hand down not one for the jealousy  
Im a man now eleven seven seven six thats what Im talkin bout  
So random hit the athem  
Dont let it be as spread like cancer  
Reminiscing red carpet for the cameras  
So famous
