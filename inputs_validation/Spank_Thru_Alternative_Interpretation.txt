As soft as a mouth or when the sorrows loud  
Itll soon have the cheese  
All flowers are there my love  
All the girls I have bleed  
Were together once again my love  
Will you be back oh baby baby  
  
I cant splange us sad we lost it from the start  
Living without you girl you only bring my heart now  
  
I can feel it I can howl  
I can pet it shave it mould it  
I can cut it I can paste it spank it  
Beautify you weigh it  
  
Ive been looking for day glow  
Always hearin the same ol  
Say you want to be faithful  
I can make it do things you wouldnt think it ever could  
  
I can feel it I can hold it  
Pet it shave it mould it  
He can cut it he can paste it Spank it  
Beautify you weigh it  
  
Ive been looking for day glow  
Always hearin the same ol  
Say you want to be faithful  
I can make it do things you wouldnt think it ever could  
  
Bridge  
  
Ive been looking for day glow  
Always hearin the same ol  
Say you want to be faithful  
I can make it do things you wouldnt think it ever you wouldnt think it ever
could
