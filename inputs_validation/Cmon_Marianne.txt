Whoa ho ho here I am on my knees again  
Ill do anything just to make it right  
Say youll understand oh I know you can  
Cmon Marianne  
  
No matter what people say it didnt happen that way  
She was a passing fling and not a permanent thing  
Say youll understand oh I know you can

From the bitterness of my cheatin years  
So I hang my head wish that I was dead
