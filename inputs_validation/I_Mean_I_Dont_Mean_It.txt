Yeah like I was saying  
I aint ya know what  
Im not tryin to say things to hurt you  
You know what Im saying  
I dont wanna hurt you baby  
Just sometimes you do things  
That push me to say things I dont wanna say  
You know what Im saying  
You know I love you  
You know I care about you  
This time you just brought it on yourself  
Yo check it out  
  
Now I shoulda been more man  
About the way things went down  
Especially since we been dealin  
For like seven years now  
Ive been slowly slowly bringing you down  
No conversation no good sex in a while  
But still you search and find a way  
To love me somehow  
Even though I ride you still trust me somehow  
Got my faces some ice and a tie  
Slowly slowly slowly slowly goin down  
  
I dont mean it When I hollar at you  
I dont mean it When I say that were through  
I dont mean it What Im takin you through  
I dont mean it Baby  
I dont mean it Said Im sorry  
I dont mean it Can you find a way to forgive me  
I dont mean it Said I went to church this morning  
I dont mean it I dont mean it  
  
Running around here talking about  
How Im a big player now  
Hidden in corners blinging out our share  
Kelly makin hits now  
Thinking about this industry  
And how I put it out  
You were there for me  
When I used dish rags for ties  
Theres times that I didnt hear you  
I was talkin too loud  
When I didnt come home  
I was hanging with the crowd  
Whenever we fight I try to win every round  
Can you find a way to forgive me now  
  
I dont mean it Cuz I dont mean it  
I dont mean it When I hollar at you  
I dont mean it Whenever I say were through  
I dont mean it Whoa  
I dont mean it Can you find a way to forgive  
I dont mean it Ooh baby I  
I dont mean it I went to church this mornin  
I dont mean it Ooh I dont mean it  
  
R Father can you help me  
PriestWhat do you need from me  
R I broke up with my girl and Im feelin kinda lonely  
PriestI been watching you from Heaven Kelly  
You been so demanding  
You need to read my word son  
And get some understanding  
R But I been busy with my music  
PriestStop making excuses  
Recognize the love she gives  
And try not to abuse it  
R Is it too late to get her back  
PriestNot as long as Im a fact  
R Well father show me a sign  
That will make her mine  
  
I dont mean it I dont mean it  
I dont mean it Whenever I say were through  
I dont mean it Or whenever I hollar at you  
I dont mean it Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
I dont mean it Ooh baby ooh baby  
I dont mean it See what was straight is now stone  
I dont mean it Because I took you for granted oh  
I dont mean it Whoa  
I dont mean it Whoa you should know I dont mean it  
I dont mean it I put it on my life  
I dont mean it Believe me I pay the price  
I dont mean it When I was down and out  
I dont mean it You reached out your hand  
I dont mean it Ive learned it takes a good woman  
I dont mean it To raise a man  
I dont mean it Oh I love you baby  
I dont mean it Oh oh oh I love you baby
