Im honored Im flattered  
This greeting really mattered  
This welcome is grand but Im really concerned  
I like your attention  
But this I have to mention  
Youre playing with fire and youre apt to get burned  
  
Theres a girl in Tennessee  
Whos sorry she met up with me  
Cant go back to Tennessee  
Im a bad bad man  
  
Theres a girl in Omaha  
But I ran faster than her pa  
Cant go back to Omaha  
Im a bad bad man  
  
Theres a girl in Wyoming  
And theyre combing Wyoming  
To find the man in white  
Who was out with her that night  
  
Theres a girl in Arkansas  
The sheriff is her brotherinlaw  
Cant go back to Arkansas  
Im a bad bad man  
  
Youre making too much fuss  
For we dont give a tinkers cuss  
Weve been out yes each of us  
With a bad bad man  
  
Weve been chasing up and down  
That other show has just left town  
And the one who played the clown  
Was a bad bad man  
  
You may love us and leave us  
But the parting wont grieve us  
Well turn the other cheek  
When the minstrels come next week  
  
When the show folks come to call  
A girl may slip but she wont fall  
Well give some but wont give all  
To a bad bad man  
  
For years I have yearned to  
Play towns I could return to  
And this may be it from the way that you speak  
Im glad youre not frightened  
The atmosphere has brightened  
And now lets make plans for a wonderful week  
  
Monday when my show is done  
Ill teach you how to shoot a gun  
You may find it lots of fun  
With a bad bad man  
  
Tuesday theres no matinee  
But Ill be in my tent all day  
You can come around and play  
With a bad bad man  
  
Send your mothers on Wednesday  
Because Wednesdays old hens day  
But Thursday is sublime  
Ill have lots of open time  
  
Friday night will be the test  
If Saturday youre still my guest  
Sunday you can come and rest  
With a bad bad man  
  
Im enlightened but frightened  
Tho my interest youve heightened  
It might turn out to be  
That youre much too much for me  
  
So Ill go back to my tent  
And someday when youre old and bent  
Think of hours you might have spent  
With a bad bad man
