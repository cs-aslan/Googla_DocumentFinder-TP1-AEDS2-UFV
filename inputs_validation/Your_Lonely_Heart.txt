Here you are right by my side  
Words cannot express how I feel  
Being this close to you  
Heaven seems much nearer in your eyes  
I wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
I can see your face and I start to trembling all inside  
Dont know why but its true  
Were so close and yet so far away  
Wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
Open up and let my light inside  
I just want to be your friend  
Lets forget about the tears weve cried  
Darling I just want to love you  
Wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
Open up and let my light inside  
I just want to be your friend  
Lets forget about our foolish pride  
Darling I just want to love you  
Wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo  
Here we are together now  
Wanting you but dont know how  
Knowing I care for you  
Even if we have to start all over again  
Wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
Open up and let my light inside  
I just want to be your friend  
Lets forget about the tears weve cried  
Darling I just want to love you  
Wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
Open up and let my light inside  
I just want to be your friend  
Lets forget about our foolish pride  
Darling I just want to love you  
Wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
Open up and let my light inside
