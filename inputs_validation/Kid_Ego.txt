Come down  
  
Hey kid Im talkin to you  
What am I supposed to do  
You know that youre something special  
Thats something you already knew  
Hey kid got something to say  
But you wont listen anyway  
I am only tryin to help you  
But you get further every day  
  
We think your head is getting  
Bigger and bigger and bigger  
  
Hey kid some good advice  
To bring your britches down to size  
Some modesty would suit you better  
So why dont you give it a try  
  
Hey kid ego  
With your head above the clouds  
Hey kid ego  
Come down  
  
Hey kid youre Mr IT  
Inch by inch a little bit  
Stepping on the little people  
Like you dont even give a shit  
Hey kid you have it all  
Standing proud on top of the world  
Dont you know the bigger they come  
The harder they must all fall  
  
We think your head is getting  
Bigger and bigger and bigger  
We think you should be taught  
Some manners manners manners  
  
Hey kid some good advice  
To bring your britches down to size  
Some modesty would suit you better  
So why dont you give it a try
