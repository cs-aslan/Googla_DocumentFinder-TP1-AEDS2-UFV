Animal grace in form and power  
Dignity a conscious thought  
The judgement hour  
  
To live in honor  
Quoting freedoms name  
A noble stance  
Bearing a proudful mane  
Noble savage  
  
Hope is born a changeling dawn  
Bringing strange power  
Transform change form  
Blend mind and matter  
  
A voice of reason crying in the dark  
A raging fire from a spark  
Breathe through me  
  
Im a savage Im a king  
I fought deceivers  
I conquered evil  
  
Animal grace in form and power  
Dignitya conscious thought  
The judgement hour  
  
A voice of reason crying in the dark  
A divine vision from the heart  
Breathe through me  
  
Im a savage Im a king  
I fought deceivers  
I conquered evil  
  
Innocent eyes shine down on me  
Dont dont dont blind your eyes to me  
Im here with you  
Always again today  
Can you feel me  
Im with you  
Never never surrender  
Oh the power the glory is yours  
My kingdom on high again  
Can you see  
Im with you now
