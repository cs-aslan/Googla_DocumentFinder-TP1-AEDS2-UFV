Were the children of the King  
Were gonna say so  
Were the children of the King  
Were gonna say so say so  
Were not ashamed to see  
Were gonna say so say so  
Jesus Christ is our Lord Hes the one we adore  
Were gonna say so dont say no but say so  
In this world full of compromise and sin  
We must stand for Him  
Even when it tries to pull us in  
We must fight to win  
We gotta fix our eyes on our goal  
To love our God with all our soul  
This message of hope it must be told  
Were the children of the King  
Were gonna say so say so  
Were not ashamed to see  
Were gonna say so say so  
Jesus Christ is our Lord Hes the one we adore  
Were gonna say so dont say no but say so  
The world is searching for something that will last  
Weve gotta help them fast  
We must be so faithful to the task  
For the time has passed  
On our knees weve gotta run the race  
Following Jesus at His pace at His pace  
Share the story of His grace  
Were the children of the King  
Were gonna say so say so  
Were not ashamed to see  
Were gonna say so say so  
Jesus Christ is our Lord Hes the one we adore  
Were gonna say so dont say no but say so  
Jesus Christ is our Lord Hes the one we adore  
Were gonna say so dont say no but say so  
Say so dont say no but say so
