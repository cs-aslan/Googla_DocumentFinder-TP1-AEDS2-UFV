You pull me in with your smile  
You make me melt with your voice  
Now Ive been gone now for awhile  
Just to find that Im your seventh choice  
And I dont wanna pay the cost  
But it be best if you get lost  
Cause you know youll never change  
  
Chorus  
Dont say that you need me  
And dont play these games in my mind  
You better get out of my head cause your wasting your time  
And dont say its forever  
And dont play cause you had your shot  
You better stop messing around cause you gonna get caught  
  
You promise me all of your time  
I guess Im not they only one  
The thing its my heart on the line this time  
Im your number one or Im gone  
  
Chorus  
  
No dont try to get me back  
I wont forget about our past  
I never had the guts to leave  
Now your making it  
Now your making it much easier for me to see  
  
And dont say that you sorry  
Your breaking every inch of my heart  
I shouldve known from the start now its time to get lost  
And dont say that you need me  
And dont play these games in my mind  
You better get out of my head cause your wasting your time  
And dont say its forever  
And dont play cause you had you shot  
You better stop messing around cause you gonna get caught  
You better stop messing around cause you gonna get caught
