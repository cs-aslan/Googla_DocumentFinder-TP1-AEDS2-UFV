Would you like to dance  
Not very good Ill admit it  
I just need a minute or two  
Close your eyes cos  
  
I cant believe your eyes  
Wild and blue warm and willing  
I cant believe your eyes  
Is it true what theyre saying  
  
Women come and go  
So many occasions I have to look twice  
To catch your second show  
One look at you thats all I needed tonight cos  
  
I cant believe your   
  
Dont stop the music playing  
Dont wanna lose it tonight  
Now that we got that feeling  
So good so right  
  
I cant believe your
