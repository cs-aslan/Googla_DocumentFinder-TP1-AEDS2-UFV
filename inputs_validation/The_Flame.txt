Give me a ticket on a jet airplane  
Im agonna take it  
I live my life in the fast lane the only way to make it  
And I keep on going all night long  
Cause thats the way I like it  
And with what you got in the heat of the night  
I know we got to try it  
  
Until the flame burns out  
Until the flame burns out  
  
So turn it up your radio  
Everybody shake it  
Im a hundred degrees with wild fantasies  
And I need someone to make it  
Show me a place where love is sweet  
I aint gonna fake it  
And hey little girl if you want my love  
Then nows the time to take it  
  
Before the flame burns out Repeat x4  
  
Turn up the flame your hips are fire  
Youre so hot I got to try ya  
Show me the spot and Ill hit the mark  
Baby I got the gasoline and you got the sparks  
  
Before the flame burns out  
Before the flame burns out  
Until the flame burns out  
Until the flame burns out
