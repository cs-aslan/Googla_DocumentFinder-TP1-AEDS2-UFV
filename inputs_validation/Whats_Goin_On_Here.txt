Roll me over slowly Ive been drinkin all night  
Help me make a move I cant stand the light  
Wake me shake me dont slam the door  
I aint been so bad I just cant recall  
Spent the night chasin up a listed old flame  
Lyin on the floor I cant remember her name  
I cant stay here theres something wrong here  
Whats goin onhere  
  
Went downtown had a long way to go  
How I got there well I dont know  
Found myself sittin in a west side bar  
Tried to leave but I could not go far  
High class woman tryn to give me a line  
Should have left early when I felt so fine  
I cant stay here theres something wrong here  
Whats goin on here  
  
When they closed up the bar you know they left me for dead  
I cant remember a thing I said  
Must have called the police to take me away  
They said Forty days now Ive got to pay  
Spent the night chasin up a listed old flame  
Lyin on the floor I cant remember my name  
I cant get together while theyre messin with me  
Keep on lookin round tell me where can I be  
I cant stay here theres something wrong here  
Whats goin on here
