When I come home baby  
And Ive been working all night long  
I put my daughter on my knee and she says  
Daddy whats wrong  
I put my head on her shoulder  
She whispers in my ear so sweet  
You know what she says  
Daddy youre a fool to cry  
Youre a fool to cry  
And it makes me wonder why  
  
You know I got a woman  
And she lives in the poor part of town  
And I go see her sometimes  
And we make love so fine  
I put my head on her shoulder  
She says Tell me all your troubles  
You know what she says  
She says Daddy youre a fool to cry  
Youre a fool to cry  
And it makes me wonder why  
  
Daddy youre a fool to cry  
Oh I love you so much baby  
Daddy youre a fool to cry  
Daddy youre a fool to cry yeah  
She says Daddy youre a fool to cry  
Youre a fool to cry  
And it makes me wonder why  
  
She says Daddy youre a fool to cry  
Daddy youre a fool to cry  
Daddy youre a fool to cry  
Daddy youre a fool to cry  
  
Even my friends say to me sometimes  
And make out like I dont understand them  
You know what they say  
They say Daddy youre a fool to cry  
Youre a fool to cry  
Youre a fool to cry  
And it makes me wonder why
