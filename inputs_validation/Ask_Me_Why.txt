I love you cause you tell me things I want to know  
And its true that it really only goes to show  
That I know  
That I I I I should never never never be blue  
  
Now youre mine my happiness still makes me cry  
And in time youll understand the reason why  
If I cry  
Its not because Im sad but youre the only love that Ive ever had  
  
I cant believe its happened to me  
I cant conceive of any more misery  
  
Ask me why Ill say I love you  
And Im always thinking of you  
  
I love you cause you tell me things I want to know  
And its true that it really only goes to show  
That I know  
  
That I I I I should never never never be blue  
  
Ask me why Ill say I love you  
And Im always thinking of you  
  
I cant believe its happened to me  
I cant conceive of any more misery  
  
Ask me why Ill say I love you  
And Im always thinking of you
