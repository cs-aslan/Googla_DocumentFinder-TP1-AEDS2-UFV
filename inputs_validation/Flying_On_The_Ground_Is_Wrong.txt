Is my world not falling down  
Im in pieces on the ground  
And my eyes arent open  
And Im standing on my knees  
But if crying and holding on  
And flying on the ground is wrong  
Then Im sorry to let you down  
But youre from my side of town  
And I miss you  
Turn me up or turn me down  
Turn me off or turn me round  
I wish I could have met you in a place  
Where we both belong  
But if crying and holding on  
And flying on the ground is wrong  
Then Im sorry to let you down  
But youre from my side of town  
And I miss you  
Sometimes I feel like Im just a helpless child  
Sometimes I feel like a kid  
But baby since I have changed  
I cant take nothing home  
City lights at a country fair  
Never shine but always glare  
If Im bright enough to see you  
Youre just too dark to care  
But if crying and holding on  
And flying on the ground is wrong  
Then Im sorry to let you down  
But youre from my side of town  
And I miss you
