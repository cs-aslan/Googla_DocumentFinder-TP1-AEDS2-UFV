This was big for us  
Forever changing you and me  
Allow me to be ambiguous  
Though I cant stand ambiguity  
  
Ill beat around this burning bush  
Trying to put the fire out  
When all the shoving came to push  
The words just stayed stuck in my mouth  
  
Cause its okay to believe in something  
Its alright to live your live for someone  
Ba da da dum  
  
Its okay to believe in something  
Its alright to live your live for someone yeah  
Ba da da dum  
  
So we might lose  
But Im glad I didnt leave  
I wear my soul on my shoes  
If not my heart upon my sleeve  
  
If Im not allowed to speak aloud  
Of what you really mean to me  
Then ll type it bold when I spell it out  
ITS LOVE  
  
Cause its okay to believe in something  
Its alright to live your live for someone yeah  
Ba da da dum  
  
Oh Oh Oh  
  
Its okay to believe in something  
Its alright to live your life for someone yeah  
Ba da da dum  
Oh  
  
So why do I hesitate for my cocoon to break  
Second guess every move that I make  
Second guess every move that you make  
  
This was big for us  
Changing you and me  
  
Cause its okay to believe in something  
Its alright to live your live for someone yeah  
Oh Oh Yeah  
  
Oh its okay to believe in something  
Its alright to live your live for someone yeah
