For I have got another girl another girl  
Youre making me say that Ive got nobody but you  
But as from today well Ive got somebody thats new  
I aint no fool and I dont take what I dont want  
  
For I have got another girl another girl  
Shes sweeter than all the girls and Ive met quite a few  
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do  
And so Im telling you this time youd better stop  
  
For I have got another girl  
Another girl who will love me till the end  
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend  
  
I dont want to say that Ive been unhappy with you  
But as from today well Ive seen somebody thats new  
I aint no fool and I dont take what I dont want  
  
For I have got another girl  
Another girl who will love me till the end  
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend  
  
For I have got another girl  
Another girl who will love me till the end  
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend  
For I have got another girl
