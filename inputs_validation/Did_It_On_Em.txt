Chorus  
Shitted on em  
Man I just shitted on em  
Shitted on em  
Put yo number twos in the air if you did it on em  
Shitted on em  
Man I just shitted on em  
Shitted on em  
Put your number twos in the air if you did it on em  
  
All these bitches is my sons  
And Ima go and get some bibs for em  
A couple formulas little pretty lids on em  
If I had a dick I would pull it out and piss on em  
Let me shake it off  
I just signed a couple deals I might break you off  
And we aint making up I dont need a mediator  
Just let them bums blow steam radiator  
  
Chorus  
  
This stone is flawless F1  
I keep shooters up top in the F1  
A lot of bad bitches beggin me to eff one  
But Im a eat them rap bitches when the chef come  
Those some fresh ones  
More talent in my mother fuckin left thumb  
She aint a Nicki fan then the bitch deaf dumb  
You aint my son you my mother fuckin stepson  
  
Chorus  
  
All these bitches is my sons  
And I aint talking bout Phoenix  
Bitch I get money so I dos what I pleases  
I live with the mother fuckin pools and the trees is  
Broke bitches so crusty disgust me  
Gave the bitch a ride got the Continental dusty  
Trust me I keep a couple hundred in the duff b  
Couple wet wipes in case a bum try to touch me  
Im the terminator bitch talk slick I am have to terminate her  
These little nappy headed hoes need a perminator  
You my seed I spray you with the germinator  
Move back bugs matter fact you know the queen could use a back rub  
If you could turn back time Cher  
You used the be here but now you gone Nair  
  
Chorus
