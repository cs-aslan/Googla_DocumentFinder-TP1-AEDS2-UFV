Always safe to know what is good for taking  
Blood stains from your clothes  
Besides fire  
Like I said before  
When I bite your tongue out of your mouth youll know  
Youll know  
  
Just what am I supposed to say  
And tell you why I turned out this way  
Dont make me dont make me  
  
If you love it then let it go  
And how I thought youll never know  
Just dont blame me dont blame me  
  
Youll never make it alone  
Its easier to know  
Youve always been on your own  
Its easier to know  
  
Nothing safe feels real  
Waiting here to dodge so open I reveal  
Theres something  
  
Picking up my Brains  
You can tell your mom that men are all the same  
The same  
Just what am I supposed to say  
And tell you why I turned out this way  
Dont make me dont make me  
  
If you love it then let it go  
And how I thought youll never know  
Just dont blame me dont blame me  
  
Youll never make it alone  
Its easier to know  
Youve always been on your own  
Its easier to know  
Youll have to pay to watch me jump  
That I love you more  
Youll never make it alone  
Its easier to go  
Its easier to go  
  
Nowhere to go Im not leaving  
Not going Im not kissing you goodbye on my own  
Im nothing just bleeding  
Im not kissing you goodbye  
  
Youll never make it alone  
Let it go Im not leaving  
Youve always been on your own  
Not going Im not kissing you goodbye  
Youll never make it alone  
On my own Im nothing just bleeding  
Youve always been on your own  
Im not kissing you goodbye  
  
Youll never make it alone  
Let it go Im not leaving  
Youve always been on your own  
Not going Im not kissing you goodbye  
Youll never make it alone  
On my own Im nothing just bleeding  
Youve always been on your own  
Im not kissing you goodbye
