Dark clouds are comin like an army  
Soon the sky will open up and disarm me  
You will go just like youve gone before  
One sad soldier off to war enemies that only you can see  
  
Dishes stacked the table cleared  
Its always like the scene of the last supper here  
You speak so cryptically thats not news to me  
The flood is here it will carry you  
And Ive got work to do  
  
Come on home the team youre hitched to has a mind of its own  
But its just the forces of your past youve fought before  
Come back here and shut the door  
Im stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles  
  
There is fire there is lust  
Some will trade it all for someone they could trust  
Theres a bag of silver for a box of nails  
Its so simple the betrayal  
Though its known to change the world and whats to come  
  
Just come on home the team youre hitched to has a mind of its own  
But its just the forces of your past youve fought before  
Dont you recognize them anymore  
Im stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles  
  
Theres the given and the expected  
I count my blessings while I eye what Ive neglected  
Is this for better is this for worse  
Youre all jammed up and the dams about to burst  
  
I hear the owl in the night  
I realize that some things never are made right  
By some will we string together here  
Days to months and months to years  
What if everything we have adds up to nothing  
  
Come on home the team youre hitched to has a mind of its own  
But its just the forces of your past youve fought before  
Come back here and shut the door  
Im stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles
