Well if I live to be a hundred I wont forget the day  
I broke the heart you gave me and let you walk away  
Thats when they hung my name in the fools hall of fame  
Ah baby since weve been apart I cant console my heart  
It cries and cries all night long  
Cant I ever make you see this change youve made in me  
Just give me a chance to tell you I was wrong  
Yes they say that youll forgive me and end this misery  
You know Ill keep on a beggin till you come back to me  
Dont leave me here in chains in the fools hall of fame
