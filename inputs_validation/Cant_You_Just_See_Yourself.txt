Cant you just see yourself in a gingham gown  
Little pink ribbons tied in your hair  
Sitting there by my side when we ride through town  
Folksll turn around oh how theyll tell  
  
Cant you just see yourself on a porch with me  
Watching a show that stars give for free  
One little word can do it so say the word  
And well have dozens of chicks a house in the sticks  
Where people are glad to be known as hicks  
Cant you just see yourself in love with me  
  
Cant you just see yourself on a porch with me  
Watching a show that stars give for free  
One little word can do it so say the word  
And well have dozens of chicks a house in the sticks  
Where people are glad to be known as hicks  
Cant you just see yourself in love with me
