Theres a girl down a lonely street  
Breaking hearts seven days a week  
She got an look in her eye  
For a redblooded guy like me  
Im breaking out in a cold cold sweat  
And Im in a kind of rush to get to  
  
Little Mistreater  
You know it when you meet her  
Little Mistreater  
Yeah thats her name  
  
Treating love like a game  
Im so scared when she calls my name  
This kind of girl drives a man insane  
You give her all that you can  
She raps on your door again  
I need some time just to catch my breath  
Tell me honey do I past your test  
The Little Mistreater  
You know it when you meet her  
Little Mistreater  
Yeah thats her name  
  
Shes an old flame  
  
Tell me now Somebody tell me  
Somebody What to do when your  
Love wont leave heart wont leave  
I can almost hear the sad goodbyes  
When I see her walking down the street  
  
There she goes  
  
The Little Mistreater  
You know it when you meet her  
Little Mistreater  
You know it when you meet her  
Yeah thats her name  
  
Playing the game

Every day shes got guys on a string  
Little Mistreater  
Shes a girl dont have to do anything
