When the sun rose this morning  
I didnt have my baby by my side  
When the sun rose this morning  
I didnt have my baby by my side  
I dont know where she was  
I know shes out with some another guy  
Dont the sun look lonesome  
Shadin down behind the trees  
Dont the sun look lonesome  
Shadin down behind the trees  
But dont your house look lonesome  
When your babys packed to leave  
Blow wind blow wind  
Blow my baby back to me  
Blow wind blow wind  
Blow my baby back to me  
Well you know if I dont soon find her I will be in misery  
Goodbye baby that is all I have left to say  
Ohh goodbye baby that is all I have left to say  
But you have lost your good thing  
Go ahead and have your own way
