Just groovy  
Beatle  
What is it what is it  
Nohey faster  
Its Paul Paul is the   
  
Who  
Paul  
  
I should have known better with a girl like you  
That I would love everything that you do  
And I do hey hey hey and I do  
  
Faster  
Woahoh I should have realized what a kiss could be  
That this could only happen to me  
Cant you see cant you see  
  
That when I tell you that I love you oh  
Youre gonna say you love me too oo oo oo oo  
Bow bow bow  
And when I ask you to be miiiine  
Youre gonna say you love me too  
You love me too  
Harmonics  
You love me too  
You love me too  
  
Great Now Tell Me Why How does that go Thats my favorite Beatles
song  
One more time Tell me why

Hey I got some  
Over here I want some ice cubes
