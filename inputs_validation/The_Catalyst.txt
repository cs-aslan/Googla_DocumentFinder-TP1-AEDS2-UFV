God bless us everyone  
Were a broken people living under loaded gun  
And it cant be outfought  
It cant be outdone  
It cant outmatched  
It cant be outrun  
No  
  
God bless us everyone  
Were a broken people living under loaded gun  
And it cant be outfought  
It cant be outdone  
It cant out matched  
It cant be outrun  
No  
  
And when I close my eyes tonight  
To symphonies of blinding light  
God bless us everyone  
Were a broken people living under loaded gun oh  
Like memories in cold decay  
Transmissions echoing away  
Far from the world of you and I  
Where oceans bleed into the sky  
  
God save us everyone  
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns  
For the sins of our hand  
The sins of our tongue  
The sins of our father  
The sins of our young  
No  
  
God save us everyone  
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns  
For the sins of our hand  
The sins of our tongue  
The sins of our father  
The sins of our young  
No  
  
And when I close my eyes tonight  
To symphonies of blinding light  
God save us everyone  
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns oh  
Like memories in cold decay  
Transmissions echoing away  
Far from the world of you and I  
Where oceans bleed into the sky  
  
Like memories in cold decay  
Transmissions echoing away  
Far from the world of you and I  
Where oceans bleed into the sky

God bless us everyone  
Were a broken people living under loaded gun  
And it cant be outfought  
It cant be outdone  
It cant out matched  
It cant be outrun
