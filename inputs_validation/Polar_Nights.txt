Down down  
Thats bringing me down  
The stars in the sky  
Seem to fall to the ground  
Time time  
  
Im chasing the time  
The stars in the sky  
Seem to be turning round  
  
Is that the wind in your eyes  
That is soothing my mind  
Is that the night of your eyes  
That is soothing my mind  
  
Round round  
My minds whirling round  
The moons in the sky  
Seem to burn on the ground  
Gone gone  
  
My nightmares are gone  
The moons in the sky  
Seemed to eat up the sun  
  
Is that the wind in your eyes  
That is soothing my mind  
Is that the night in your eyes  
That is soothing my mind  
Back from polar nights  
  
I was down  
I was out  
The nights at the poleve been  
So cold without you  
I was down  
I was out  
The polestar was bringing me  
Back home to you  
  
Is that the wind in your eyes  
That is soothing my mind  
Is that the night in your eyes  
That is soothing my mind
