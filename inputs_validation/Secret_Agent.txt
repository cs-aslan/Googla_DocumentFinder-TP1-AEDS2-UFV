Well Ive got friends in the states  
And Ive got friends out in space  
When informations your game  
The whole world knows your name  
And so they gave me a code  
To work this treacherous road  
For all the agents I know  
Must work incognito  
  
chorus  
I love my trade  
Ive got my future made  
I put my life on the line  
To save this country of mine  
And they reward me with love  
And see I have a good time  
So all my moves must be fast  
cause every day is my last  
A secret agent thats slow  
Almost certain to go  
  
chorus  
Ive got friends in the states  
Ive got friends out in space  
When informations your game  
The whole world knows your name  
And so they gave me a code  
To work this treacherous road  
For all the agents I know  
Must work incognito  
  
chorus
