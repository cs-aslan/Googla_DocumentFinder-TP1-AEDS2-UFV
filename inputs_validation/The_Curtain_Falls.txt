I ask at miss  
I ask never strong to fly ball  
Ill never so little fork if  
Are the love listen  
  
Or what you need us  
Or what you need us  
See me late us all with me  
Oh what you need us all of the skies as you need for life  
Oh I feel alright  
Feel me late us all  
  
Oh what you need us  
Save the curtain falls  
Feel me late us all  
Sve the curtain falls  
  
I ask at miss  
I ask never strong to fly ball  
Ill never so little fork if  
Are the love listen  
  
Oh what you need us  
Save the curtain falls  
If the fail all the sail

Or what you need us  
Save the curtain falls  
Feel me late us all
