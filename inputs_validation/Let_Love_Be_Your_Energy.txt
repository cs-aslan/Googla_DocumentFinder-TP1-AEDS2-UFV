Out of a million seeds  
Only the strongest one breathes  
You made a miracle mother  
Ill make a man out of me  
  
Daddy wheres the sun gone from the sky  
What did we do wrong why did it die  
And all the grown ups say sorry kids we got no reply  
  
If youre willing to change the world  
Let love be your energy  
Ive got more than I need  
When your love shines down on me  
  
Every tear that you cry  
Will be replaced when you die  
Why dont you love your brother  
Are you out of your mind  
  
Daddy wheres the sun gone from the sky  
What did we do wrong why did it die  
And if youve got no love for me then Ill say goodbye  
  
If youre willing to change the world  
Let love be your energy  
Ive got more than I need  
When your love shines down on me  
  
If youre willing to change the world  
Let love be your energy  
I cant contain how I feel  
When your love shines down on me  
Well if you want to come and make a stance  
So when its in your hands  
People will show me love  
  
Well if you want to come and make a stance

If youre willing to change the world

I cant contain how I feel  
When your love shines down on me
