I dont gamble I dont fight  
I dont be hangin in the bars at night  
Yeah I used to be a fighter but  
Now I am a wiser man  
  
I dont drink much I dont smoke  
I dont be hardly mess around with no dope  
Yeah I used to be a problem but  
Now I am a careful man  
  
Chorus  
But if you used to want to see a commotion  
You shoulda seen the man that I used to be  
I was trouble in perpetual motion  
Trouble with a capital T  
Stayin out late havin fun  
And shot off every single shot in my gun  
Yeah I used to be a lover but  
Now Im an older man  
  
Chorus  
  
But if you used to want to see a commotion  
You shoulda seen the man that I used to be  
I was trouble in perpetual motion  
Trouble with a capital T  
Stayin out late havin fun  
And shot off every single shot in my gun  
Yeah I used to be a terror but  
Now I am a tired man  
Yeah I used to be a terror but  
Now I am a tired man
