He is God He is God He is God He is God  
He is with us He is God He is with us He is God  
In His purpose I will stand  
Ive been renewed by the Maker  
In His purpose I will stand  
Ive been renewed by Him alone  
Been made by the Maker  
Been bought by the Buyer  
Broken by the Breaker  
Im His Im His  
In His purpose I will stand  
Ive been renewed by Him alone  
made by the Maker  
bought by the Buyer  
Broken by the Breaker  
Im His Im His  
In refuge and strength  
ever present help in trouble  
without fear  
As the nations uproar and the kingdoms fall  
He lifts His voicemelting  
He is with us He is God  
He is with us He is God  
He is with us He is God  
He is with us He is God  
Been made by the Maker  
Been bought by the Buyer  
Broken by the Breaker  
Im His Im His
