Its lonely in the field  
that we send our fighters to wander  
They leave with minds of steel  
Its their training solution  
Weve programmed the way  
It leads us to order  
Theres no turning back  
  
A Surgical Strike  
Weve taught them not to feel  
performance is their task  
A Surgical Strike  
Its time is arriving now for you  
  
The plan for the day  
will be swift as the lightning they harness  
The atom display is not mindless illusion  
At master control assessment will not  
Be by humansTheres no turning back  
  
A Surgical Strike  
Weve taught them not to feel  
performance is their task  
A Surgical Strike  
Its time is arriving now for you
