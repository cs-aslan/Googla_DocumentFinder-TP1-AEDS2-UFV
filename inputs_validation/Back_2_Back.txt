All Night Long  
I Find Myself Tryna Get Away  
And That Aint Right nooo  
Lookin Through My Phone  
Tryna Remember Her Name  
That Would Only Make It Worse  
We Try To Talk Through Our Problems  
But It Takes More Than Words  
Said It Dont Even Bother Me  
But I Swear It Hurts  
When I Said I Didnt Wanna Go Through The Same Ish  
This Is What I Meant ohhh  
  
When You Turned Away From Me  
Makes Me Think That I Should Jus Leave  
Go Back To Bein The Same Ol G

Oh I  
Dont Want You Mad At Me  
Snatchin The Covers  
Actin Like Youre Asleep  
When You Know Youre Up nooo
