Im looking to beat hell looks like Ive got to run to be the leader  
As my forces yell you can hear em cant you hear them  
All the way well go the distance now  
All the way stand behind me now  
All the way no turning back  
All the way cause we are together  
  
Im standin proud were screaming loud Ill lead the crowd  
Running wild in the streets  
  
A heavy dose of mean yeah Im a lethal combination  
Hear my forces scream you can see them cant yo see them  
All the way well go the distance now  
All the way stand behind me now  
All the way no turning back  
All the way we are together  
  
Im standin proud were screaming loud Ill lead the crowd  
Running wild in the streets
