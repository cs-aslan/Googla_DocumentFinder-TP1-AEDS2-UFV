Rollin rollin on down the line  
The sweetest little gal that I ever did know  
I had to leave her behind  
But she said daddy dont leave me here to whine  
Youre breakin my heart right half in two  
By rollin on down the line  
But I kept on rollin rollin on down the line  
The sweetest little gal that I ever did know  
I had to leave her behind  
Now she said baby wont you please change your mind  
Theres nothin you could say or do  
That would ever make me change my mind  
And I kept on rollin rollin on down the line  
The sweetest little gal that I ever did know  
I had to leave her behind  
  
And she said honey dont leave me here alone  
Cause if you do and you get back you wont find me at home  
And I kept on rollin rollin on down the line  
The worst mistake that I ever made  
Was leavin that gal behind  
And I kept on rollin And I kept on rollin
