Peron  
Dice are rolling the knives are out  
Wouldbe presidents are all around  
I dont say they mean harm  
But theyd each give an arm  
To see us six feet underground  
  
Eva  
It doesnt matter what those morons say  
Our nations leaders are a feeble crew  
Theres only twenty of them anyway  
What is twenty next to millions who  
Are looking to you  
  
All you have to do is sit and wait  
Keeping out of everybodys way  
Wellyoull be handed power on a plate  
When the ones who matter have their say  
And with chaos installed  
You can reluctantly agree to be called  
  
Peron  
There again we could be foolish not to quit while were ahead  
For distance lends enchantment and that is why  
All exiles are distinguished more important theyre not dead  
I could find job satisfaction in Paraguay  
  
Eva  
This is crazy defeatist talk  
Why commit political suicide theres no risk  
Theres no call for any action at all  
When you have unions on your side  
  
Workers  
A new Argentina the chains of the masses untied  
A new Argentina the voice of the people  
Cannot be denied  
  
Eva  
There is only one man who can lead any workers regime  
He lives for your problems he shares your ideals and your dream  
He supports you for he loves you  
Understands you is one of you  
If not how could he love me  
  
Workers  
A new Argentina the workers battle song  
A new Argentina the voice of the people  
Rings out loud and long  
  
Eva  
Now I am a worker Ive suffered the way that you do  
Ive been unemployed and Ive starved and Ive hated it too  
But I found my salvation in Peron may the nation  
Let him save them as he saved me  
  
All  
A new Argentina a new age about to begin  
A new Argentina we face the world together  
And no dissent within  
  
Peron  
There again we could be foolish not to quit while were ahead  
I can see us many miles away inactive  
Sipping cocktails on a terrace taking breakfast in bed  
Sleeping easy doing nothing its attractive  
  
Eva  
Dont think I dont think like you  
I often get those nightmares too  
They always take some swallowing  
Sometimes its very difficult to keep momentum  
If its you that you are following  
Dont close doors keep an escape clause  
Because we might lose the Big Apple  
  
But would I have done what I did  
If I hadnt thought if I hadnt known  
We would take the country  
  
Eva  
Peron has resigned from the army and this we avow  
The descamisados are those he is marching with now  
He supports you for he loves you  
Understands you is one of you  
If not how could he love me  
  
All  
A new Argentina the chains of the masses untied  
A new Argentina the voice of the people  
Cannot be and must not be denied  
  
Che  
How annoying that they have to fight elections for their cause  
The inconvenience having to get a majority  
If normal methods of persuasion fail to win them applause  
There are other ways of establishing authority  
  
All  
A new Argentina the chains of the masses untied  
A new Argentina the voice of the people  
Cannot be and will not be and must not be denied
