What you gonna do  
What you gonna do  
What you gonna do on your vacation  
What you gonna do  
  
What you gonna do  
What you gonna do for relaxation  
Change you name  
Cut your hair  
  
You can go anywhere  
You deserve some fun and rest  
You deserve the very best

Or another proclamation to some male friends in attendance
