There comes a time  
When we Need a certain call  
  
When the world must come together as one  
There are people dying  
And its time to lend a hand To life   
The greatest gift of all  
We cant go on pretending day by day  
That someone somewhere will soon make a change  
We are all a part of Gods great big family  
  
And the truth  
You know  
  
Love is all we need  
  
We are the world  
We are the children  
  
We are the ones  
Who make a brighter day  
  
So lets start giving  
Theres a choice were making  
  
Were saving our own lives Its true  
  
We make a better days  
  
Just you and me  
  
Send them your heart  
  
So they know that someone cares  
  
And their lives will be stronger and free  
As God has shown us  
By turning stone to bread  
  
So we all must lend a helping hand  
  
We are the world  
  
When youre down and out  
There seems no hope at all  
But if you just believe  
Theres no way we can fall  
Let us realize that a  
Change will only come  
When we stand together as one  
  
We are the world
