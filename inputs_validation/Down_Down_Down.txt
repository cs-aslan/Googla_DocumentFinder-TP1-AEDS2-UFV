Come to see her in the river  
Shell be there to wave to you  
In the hope that youll forgive her  
She will join you there  
  
Find out that now was  
the answer to answers  
that you gave later  
She did the things that  
we both did before now  
but who forgave her  
  
Now you see how down youve fallen  
Now you hear your conscious call  
Thank yourself alone for stallin  
Im not there to call  
  
Call me a fool cause  
I need her and see her  
but now youre down  
Something inside you  
will tell you Im wise to  
what youre spreadin round  
  
If I could stand to see her cryin  
I would tell her not to care  
When she learns of all your lyin  
Would she join you there  
  
Find out that now was  
the answer to answers  
that you gave later
