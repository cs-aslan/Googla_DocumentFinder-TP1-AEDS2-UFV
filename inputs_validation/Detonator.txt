Chorus  
Lettin loose its the detonator setting off a time bomb ring the alarm  
Im coming through with the wickedness  
Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this  
Lettin loose its the detonator setting off a time bomb ring the alarm  
Im coming through with the wickedness  
Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this  
I got a nation of millions to capture  
Lyrical disaster pass the ganja  
Choppin shit like a bladerunner  
Huntin down my opponents like the predator  
Ready to start my search like the hunt for red October 31st  
Day of my birth had much pain as an adolescent  
Natural stigmata much drama when Moms was stressin  
Theyre on my trail like the bone collector  
Select the sense from my sixth  
Inject the fluid of the wickedness  
Fuck the world is my motto  
I just cant understand why they point the finger  
When they see me doing my thing  
Bitches swing when they see me pass by  
In the GS4 with the Cane plates bought from my last tour  
Its amityville horror on haters block  
For those that copycat my tactics trying to make it to the top  
Like in the shining when Jack Nicholson got possessed with the wickedness  
Im true to kicking this  
Chorus  
Lettin loose its the detonator setting off a time bomb ring the alarm  
Im coming through with the wickedness  
Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this  
Lettin loose its the detonator setting off a time bomb ring the alarm  
Im coming through with the wickedness  
Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this  
Like Manson dismantling MCs who oppose a threat  
You really dont want to get into some shit that youll regret  
Cause like Samuel I hold the whole place for negotiation  
Incarcerating anyone with the temptation trying to test my faith  
is it safe to come out and play now is he gone  
Man I dont understand what kind of high this dude is trippin on  
Pure ICE with a twist of vanilla thriller  
Captivating souls like the body snatchers  
Its return of the living Caucasians  
Of psychopathic mind grabbing Asiatic demonic fanatics  
Causing havoc bringing the pain  
Flaming up like in Backdraft  
Feel the wrath of the lyrical combustion  
Many arent true to what theyre busting  
from the depths  
Im coming through like the Hell Raiser  
Its the end of days theres no escape from the detonator  
Chorus  
Lettin loose its the detonator setting off a time bomb ring the alarm  
Im coming through with the wickedness  
Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this  
Lettin loose its the detonator setting off a time bomb ring the alarm  
Im coming through with the wickedness  
Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this
