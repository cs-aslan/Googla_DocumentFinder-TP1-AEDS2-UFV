She was a really good friend  
A really good friend to me yeah  
She was a really good friend  
A really good friend to me yeah  
  
But they took her away  
Tossed her in the bin  
Now shes hanging out  
In East Berlin owooo  
  
She had a very bad affair  
With some cat from Hiroshima  
She turned into a head of lettuce  
She eats Thorazine in her farina  
But they took her away  
Tossed her in the bin  
Now shes hanging out  
In East Berlin owooo  
  
And everytime I eat vegetables  
It makes me think of you  
And everytime I eat vegetables  
I dont know what to do to do owooo
