I cant bite the hand  
Thats gonna feed me  
You like to see me slide  
This life of shadow mine  
  
You and I you and I  
  
Your side of things  
You wanna show me  
Your fingers scratch my eyes  
This time Im going blind  
  
You and I you and I  
  
You want it you need it  
You love it you hate it  
Soul creation  
  
You seen it you feel it  
You touch it believe it  
  
Right right right right  
  
You want it you need it  
You love it you hate it  
Soul creation  
  
You seen it you feel it  
You touch it believe it  
Your salvation  
  
Right right right right  
  
I cant taste the poison  
That Im drinking  
Your death is in disguise  
I chose to say goodbye  
  
You and I you and I  
  
You want it you need it  
You love it you hate it  
Soul creation  
  
You seen it you feel it  
You touch it believe it

You seen it you feel it  
You touch it believe it  
Your salvation
