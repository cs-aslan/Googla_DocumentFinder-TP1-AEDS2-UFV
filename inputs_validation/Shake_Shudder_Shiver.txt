I shake and I shudder and I shiver  
In my bath while its cold and my windows are broken  
As my poor dog lays achokin on the floor  
  
I cried to my father and my mother  
Theres no justice divine  
I wonder when I get mine  
Cause Im so sick and tired of waitin for the Lord  
  
I find just what it is Im looking for  
Theres a man wants to show me the river  
Hoofing at five Ill be more dead than alive  
I find a reason to survive when Im too old  
  
Should I walk in the lightning and the thunder  
On a hilltop so high and show my face to the sky   
Will I find just what it is Im looking for
