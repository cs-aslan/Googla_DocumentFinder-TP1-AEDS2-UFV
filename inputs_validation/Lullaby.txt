Lets go out tonight  
Put on your shoes  
Get away from here  
Far from the local blues  
Lets go out tonight  
Lets make our escape  
From the city lights  
And all the familiar shapes  
We can drive all night  
We can stop in a field  
Hear the starlight  
Traveling for millions of years  
Sing a lullaby to the night repeat  
We can rock and roll  
We can dance all night long  
To the stars above  
And we wont be strong  
We can walk away  
To the rising dawn  
As people go to work  
Wondering why our clothes are torn  
Sing a lullaby to the night repeat  
Well be driving through the mountains  
In the cool and clearing air  
With the sunlight on the ocean  
And the diamonds in your hair  
And as youre falling asleep  
I will sing you a lullaby  
Sing your lullaby repeat  
We can find a place  
For the sun and the rain  
We can live a life  
Like a hurricane  
On a mountain top  
Or right by the sea  
As long as were together  
It dont matter to me  
Lets go out tonight  
Lets escape  
Sing your lullaby repeat  
As the perfumes of the evening  
Mingle sweetly with the night  
Well lay ourselves down  
In the light of the moon  
And well hold each other tight  
And as youre falling asleep  
I will sing you a lullaby
