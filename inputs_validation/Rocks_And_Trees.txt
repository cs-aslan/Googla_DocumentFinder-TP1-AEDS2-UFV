My countrys bigger than most  
And if asked I boast  
Cause Im really proud  
So I shout it loud  
Though our numbers are few  
We will welcome you  
  
Although we dont have history  
Gold medal winning teams  
Heroes or prisoners  
World famous volcanoes  
Still what weve gots glorious  
  
Cause weve got  
Rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And water  
  
All right everyone  
  
Weve got  
Rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And water
