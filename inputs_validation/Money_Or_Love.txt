Money or love which one are you doing it for  
Everybody has to make that choice sometime you know  
Something is wrong I can tell the feeling is gone  
Do you still remember when we started long ago  
Wasnt it love that kept us all driving in a rented car  
Who couldve known that endless road would ever have come this far  
  
Money or love its your decision where to draw the line  
Everybody has a soul they can control or compromise  
When did you to start putting a price upon the pain in your heart  
When did I become the reason for the sadness in your eyes  
You couldve asked me anytime I wouldve told you why  
Maybe I might I would change your mind but now its too late to try  
  
Goodbye  
  
Every night I ask myself could I have been closer to you when you needed
someone else  
Could a friend who really knew you try Help you decide  
  
Money or love tell me what ya gonna do with your life  
Everybody needs a passion or they cash in while they can  
Make up your mind before you realize youve run out of time  
You need to reason why youve got to touch the fire to make your stand  
You couldve asked me anytime I wouldve told you why  
Maybe I might have changed your mind but now its too late to try  
  
Goodbye  
  
Money or love  
  
Wasnt is love that kept us all driving in a rented car  
Who couldve known that endless road  
Would ever have come this far  
  
Was it money or love  
  
Money or love  
  
Was it money or love Money or love  
Money or love Money or love Money or love  
Was it money or love Was it money or love Was it love
