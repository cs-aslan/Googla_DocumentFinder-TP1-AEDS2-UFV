Do believe Im gonna clap my hands  
Think I might tap my feet  
Put together a oneman band  
Take a walk on down the street  
Have a oneman parade nobody needs to know  
Cause Im right good of holding on to secrets  
And dont believe they show  
  
All I want is a little dog  
To be walking at my right hand  
Taking a breeze just as free as you please  
Maybe checking out occasional garbage cans  
Talking bout a one dog yall  
Nobodys friend but mine  
Hey now you can say hes looking kind of funky But I do believe he suits me
just fine  
  
We were on the road again  
I was wondering what to do  
But Honalei it was pouring down rain  
Baby she had the low down blues  
  
Hey now I was looking for my walking cane  
Trying on my highway shoes  
Thinking bout a one man parade yall  
Nobody nobody nobody nobody hey  
Im right good at holding on  
Holding on holding on  
  
Honalei its raining  
Honalei sure nough its raining listen here  
Honalei its raining  
Honalei its raining muddy waters  
  
Thinking bout a one man parade yall  
Nobody nobody nobody nobody hey  
Im right good at holding on  
Holding on holding on  
La la la la la
