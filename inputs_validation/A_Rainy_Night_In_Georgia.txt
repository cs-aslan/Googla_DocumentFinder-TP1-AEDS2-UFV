Hoverin by my suitcase  
Tryin to find a warm place to spend the night  
A heavy rain a fallin seems  
I hear your voice a callin its all right  
On this rainy night in Georgia  
A rainy night in Georgia  
  
I believe its rainin all over the world  
Neon signs a flashin taxicabs and buses  
Passin through the night  
The distant moanin of a train  
Seems to play a sad refrain onto the night  
On this rainy night in Georgia  
Such a rainy night in Georgia  
  
I think its rainin all over the world  
How many times I have wondered  
But it always comes out the same  
No matter how I look at itll think about it  
Its just like some of its pleasures  
Some of its pain  
  
I find me a place in a boxcar  
So I take out my guitar to pass some time  
Late at night when its hard to rest  
I hold your picture to my chest  
And then Im all right  
But its still a rainy night in Georgia  
Its a rainy night in Georgia  
  
I believe it must be rainin all over this world  
All over the world rainy night in Georgia
