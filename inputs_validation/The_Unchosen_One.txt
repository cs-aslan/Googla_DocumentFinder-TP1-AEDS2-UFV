God why you want to play with me  
Cant you see Im tumbling down  
And like your favorite toy  
Boy Im tired of being thrown around  
  
You lead me through this life of complication and delusion  
So you drop it in my lap and slap me back towards confusion  
When its so hard to decide whether to live or to die in this destiny  
Tell me what would you say if at the end of the day it was just you and me  
  
Smile away the fears that only seem to run me around  
So you open up the door then the floor came crumbling down  
Ive only one or two dreams there worth losing  
But theyre unraveling traveling down the road to ruin  
  
And the harder I try the more I slip and I slide through this fantasy  
All by myself I need your help to persevere  
But the same conclusions always greet me at my door  
Wouldnt it be nice to fade away  
And maybe one day you will show me what went wrong  
How did I become the unchosen one  
  
So when the rain is just around my corner  
Throw some sunshine down my way  
And Ill hit you with a smile all the while my worries melt away  
  
So wont you show me a sign as I continue to climb up this reality  
All by myself I need your help to persevere  
And the same conclusions always greet me at my door  
Wouldnt it be nice to fade away  
And maybe one day you will show me what went wrong  
So how did I become the unchosen one
