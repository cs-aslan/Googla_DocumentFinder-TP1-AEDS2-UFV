Oh Im your new best mate  
Help me selfmedicate  
Things can all look great  
Stopped in this town to quench my thirst  
The bad man got here first  
Then the bubble burst  
Whos telling stories  
I cant handle shit  
And its beginning to bore me  
Just get on with it  
Kill me or cure me  
My love lifes gone stiff  
Dont know who Ive been with  
And Im gonna take it cause they want to give  
Can you blame me  
Dont need to spend my bread  
People do that for me instead  
Must be thinking that Ill wake up dead  
In the morning  
I cant handle shit  
And its beginning to bore me  
Just get on with it  
Kill me or cure me  
Youve got a powerful lawyer  
Well Ive got money for ya  
I know I appall ya  
But I fucked your daughter  
I got friends stay up till the end  
Try to screw me or my girlfriend  
Until Im not the latest trend  
Fetch me butler  
I cant handle shit  
And its beginning to bore me  
Just get on with it  
Kill me or cure me  
I cant handle shit  
Kill me or cure me  
I cant handle shit  
Kill me or cure me
