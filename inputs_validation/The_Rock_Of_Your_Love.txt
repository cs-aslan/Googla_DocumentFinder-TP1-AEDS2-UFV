I lose myself in this place  
Strangest smile on my face  
The hand of blessing or beginners luck  
Here I stand on the rock of your love  
  
Somethin steady sure feels good  
I always knew somehow it would  
Ive traded chains for the wings of a dove  
Standin on the rock of your love  
  
Let the storm clouds roll  
Let the rain flood my soul  
Ill still be here when the troubles done  
Standin on the rock of your love  
  
If this ol world should fade away  
If Ive got you I aint afraid  
I will face whatever comes  
Standin on the rock of your love  
  
Let the storm clouds roll  
Let the rain flood my soul  
Ill still be here when the troubles done  
Standin on the rock of your love  
Ill still be here when the troubles done  
Standin on the rock of your love
