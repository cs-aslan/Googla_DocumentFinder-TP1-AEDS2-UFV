I told you  
Youd have to leave  
And you listened with a cryin stare  
Now youve got the nerve  
To tell me baby  
Yeah yeah a no no  
You dont care  
You just dont care baby  
Sun  
Turns back at the sight of you  
And your evil only clouds the air  
  
You you just laugh at what you do  
Hey hey hey hum  
Now you dont care  
Hey  
You dont care for me  
  
Your feelings smashed  
Now youre leaving to find  
Someone wholl dare  
To change all the wrong  
Like you done to me  
Hey hey hey no no  
You dont care  
Hey hey hey you dont care
