Games Without Frontiers  
Hans plays with Lotte Lotte plays with Jane  
Jane plays with Willi Willi is happy again  
Suki plays with Leo Sacha plays with Britt  
Adolf builts a bonfire Enrico plays with it  
Whistling tunes we hide in the dunes by the seaside  
Whistling tunes were kissing baboons in the jungle  
Its a knockout  
If looks could kill they probably will  
In games without frontierswar without tears  
Games without frontierswar without tears

Andre has a red flag Chiang Chings is blue  
They all have hills to fly them on except for Lin Tai Yu  
Dressing up in costumes playing silly games  
Hiding out in treetops shouting out rude names  
Whistling tunes we hide in the dunes by the seaside  
Whistling tunes we piss on the goons in the jungle  
Its a knockout  
If looks could kill they probably will  
In games without frontierswars without tears  
If looks could kill they probably will  
In games without frontierswar without tears
