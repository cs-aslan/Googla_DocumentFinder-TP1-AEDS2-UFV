Mary had a little lamb  
His bleeks was white as snow  
everywhere that Mary went  
The lamb was sure to go  
  
He followed her to school one day  
And that was against the rules  
He made the children laugh and play  
Youve seen that lamb  
Oh that lamb in school  
  
Oh Mary  
Listen let me tell you something  
  
Ever since I was four years old  
I hated a silly rule  
Ever since they ran Marys lamb  
Oh all the way home from school  
  
You should have seen Mary cry  
When she waved to her lamb goodbye  
The teacher said Mary come inside  
Come on and dry oh dry your eyes  
  
Oh oh oh Mary  
Wait a minute  
  
Mary dont you be so blue  
And bring that lamb back to school  
And Mary dont you be no fool  
You see the lamb daily through  
  
When you go oh home today  
You and your lamb can play  
You can even do the twist  
And then it goes  
Something like this  
  
oh oh oh Mary  
oh oh oh Mary  
Come on Mary  
Dont you be such a moaner  
Dont moan no more  
Hey hey hey Mary hey hey  
Come on Mary oh  
Come on Mary
