Chorus  
Count the days till were together  
Onetwothree  
Though it feels like forever  
We will be  
Holding on to each other  
You and me  
You will be my only lover  
Eternally  
  
You made my day  
When a dozen red roses came my way  
Warmed up my heart  
Cause I know youre thinking of me from afar  
  
Press a petal to my lips  
Feels like your kiss  
Dont you know thats what I miss  
To smell the sweet perfume  
Reminds me so much of you  
Theres nothing else that I can do  
  
Chorus  
  
Its been so long  
I know our two hearts are strong  
Theres not a moment  
That my spirit isnt in it dont you know it  
  
Try to occupy my time  
Remember youre mine  
Talking to you on the line  
Try to get used to this  
But long distance loving is  
Leaving me to dream of your kiss  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X  
  
When Im feeling scared and lonely  
Wonder if Im still your only  
Tell me now  
Soft and slowly  
Its gonna be alright  
Youll be by me side  
  
Press a petal to my lips  
Feels like your kiss  
Dont you know thats what I miss  
To smell the sweet perfume  
Reminds me so much of you  
Theres nothing else that I can do  
  
Chorus
