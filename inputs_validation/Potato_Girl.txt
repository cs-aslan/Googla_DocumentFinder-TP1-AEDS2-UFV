We live we die  
I dont know the reasons we ask why  
We hate we push  
Recent tests show we are all misunderstood  
  
Somethings seizing  
You know you lost your mind  
You know we all need saving  
She found you late last night  
You feel the madness gaining  
You know you just cant win  
You know this  
But Im just so tired of waking up on the ground  
I never knew the girl  
And I never knew the world hurt  
  
We beg we pray  
But everything still happens anyway  
Somethings teasing  
Your conscience cant decide  
She stopped your will from caving  
But left you paranoid  
  
You feel the constant straining  
She reappears divine  
You noticed  
But Im just so tired of waking up all alone
