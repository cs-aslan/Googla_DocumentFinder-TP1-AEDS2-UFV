Verse 1  
Climb on board  
Well go slow and high tempo  
Light and dark  
Hold me hard and mellow  
  
PreChorus  
Im seeing the pain seeing the pleasure  
Nobody but you body but me body but us  
Bodies together  
Id love to hold you close tonight and always  
Id love to wake up next to you  
Id love to hold you close tonight and always  
Id love to wake up next to you  
  
Chorus  
So well piss off the neighbours  
In the place that feels the tears  
The place to lose your fears  
Yeah reckless behavior  
A place that is so pure so dirty and raw  
Be in the bed all day bed all day bed all day  
Fucking you and fighting on  
Its our paradise and its our war zone  
Its our paradise and its our war zone  
  
Verse 2  
Pillow talk  
My enemy my ally  
Prisoners  
Then were free its a thriller  
  
PreChorus  
Im seeing the pain seeing the pleasure  
Nobody but you body but me body but us  
Bodies together  
Id love to hold you close tonight and always  
Id love to wake up next to you  
Id love to hold you close tonight and always  
Id love to wake up next to you  
  
Chorus  
So well piss off the neighbours  
In the place that feels the tears  
The place to lose your fears

A place that is so pure so dirty and raw  
Be in the bed all day bed all day bed all day  
Fucking you and fighting on
