With progress comes problems  
With wisdom comes age  
With lessons come learning  
And pleasure comes with pain  
  
You can only have the sunshine after the rain  
  
I took a walk  
It got me thinking  
Left foot right foot  
Smiling blinking  
Breathe out breathe in  
Somehow linking  
  
My soul to my mind and my heart to my mouth  
Lost and the found and the north to the south  
And the corners to the circle in my mind  
  
We may find that the gate has been locked  
When we come back down to what we really are  
Retrace the footprints off the path that is lost  
Its like trying to find a needle in the dark  
  
My hands they are empty  
But they are clean  
Im poor but Im healthy  
Im halfway between  
The gutter and the skyline  
  
So I took a walk to the lands end  
Thinking about an exgirlfriend that I had  
And the pages that Ive turned  
And it seems to me  
That we all love the chase  
But once were caught we feel encased  
Behind bars of love and trust  
Uprooted by drunken lust  
By people people just like us  
People people just like us  
  
You may find that the gate has been locked  
When we come back down to what we really are  
Retrace the footprints off the path thats been lost  
Its like trying to find a needle in the dark  
  
So I took a walk to the station  
Lost in my imagination  
Having private conversations with myself  
And Im just stumbling around  
And I wait for the sound  
Of this crumbling town to come tumbling down  
People say Im just bummin around  
But Ive had both my ears to the ground
