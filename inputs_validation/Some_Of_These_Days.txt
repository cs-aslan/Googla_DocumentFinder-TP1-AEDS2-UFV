Some of these days  
Youre gonna miss your Donna  
Some of these days  
Youre gonna feel so lonely  
Youll miss my huggin  
Youll miss my kissin  
Youll miss me honey  
When youre far away  
  
Youre gonna be so lonely  
For me only  
Cause you know daddy  
You had you way  
And if I leave you  
You know its gonna grieve you  
Youre gonna miss your sweet lovin Donna  
Some of these days  
  
And if I leave you  
You know its gonna grieve you  
Youre gonna miss your sweet little Donna  
Some of these days  
  
Hey honey call me when you got time  
Know what I mean
