Ive been standing in the dark  
Staring out the window at the moon  
With a heartache like Ive never known before  
And I cant eat and I cant sleep  
This pain inside its like its killing me  
Its over he said  
You dont love me anymore  
  
So this is lonely  
Now I know how it feels to lose  
This is lonely  
Its nothing anyone on earth can do  
Only time can heal  
This hurt I feel  
Cause he aint coming back  
Thats what he told me  
Now Im lonely  
  
He did everything I wanted  
Still I took his love for granted too long it seems  
There aint nothing I can do to right this wrong  
And its too late to turn back time  
And all my tears aint gonna change his mind  
Its over he said  
You dont love me anymore  
  
So this is lonely  
Now I know how it feels to lose  
This is lonely  
Its nothing anyone on earth can do  
Only time can heal  
This hurt I feel  
Cause he aint coming back  
Thats what he told me  
Now Im lonely  
  
This is lonely  
So this is lonely  
Its over he said  
You dont love me anymore
