I can hear somebody knockin  
On my bedroom door  
I find it rather shockin  
Its my best friends girl  
Oo Imagine my surprise  
Theres a hungry look in her eyes  
See how the love goes  
Anybody here know how the love goes  
She said Im feelin kinda lonely  
And only you will do  
Would you like to get to know me  
Like I wanna know you  
Oo No tellin what a man will do  
Face to face with a woman like you  
See how the love goes  
Anybody here know how the love goes  
Oh yea see how the love goes  
I can hear her calling calling  
But no one understands her no one understands  
Beggin me to let her in  
And shes waiting for my answer  
Should I open up the door  
And let trouble walk in  
Should I resist her even more  
Or tell her come on in  
Oo No tellin what a man will do  
Face to face with a woman like you  
See how the love goes  
Anybody here know how the love goes  
Oh yea see how the love goes  
Anybody here know how the love goes  
Oh yea see how the love goes  
Anybody here know how the love goes
