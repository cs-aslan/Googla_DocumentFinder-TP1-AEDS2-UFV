I look into the mirror  
See myself Im over me  
I need space for my desires  
Have to dive into my fantasies  
I know as soon as Ill arrive  
Everything is possible  
Cause no one has to hide  
Beyond the invisible  
  
Close your eyes  
Just feel and realize  
It is real and not a dream  
Im in you and youre in me  
It is time  
To break the chains of life  
If you follow you will see  
Whats beyond reality
