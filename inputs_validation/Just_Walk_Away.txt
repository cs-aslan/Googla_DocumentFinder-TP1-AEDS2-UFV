I know I never loved this way before  
And no one else has loved me more  
With you Ive laughed and cried  
I have lived and died  
What I wouldnt do just to be with you  
  
I know I must forget you to go on  
I cant hold back my tears too long  
Though life wont be the same  
Ive got to take away  
And find the strength I need to let you go  
  
Just walk away  
Just say goodbye  
Dont turn around now you may see me cry  
I mustnt fall apart  
Or show my broken heart  
Or the love I feel for you  
  
So walk away  
And close the door  
And let my life be as it was before  
And Ill never never know  
Just how I let you go  
But theres nothing left to say  
Just walk away  
  
Therell never be a moment Ill regret  
Ive loved you since the day we met  
For all the love you gave  
And all the love we made  
I know Ive got to find the strength to say  
  
Just walk away  
Just say goodbye  
Dont turn around now you may see me cry  
I mustnt fall apart  
Or show my broken heart  
Or the love I feel for you  
  
So walk away  
And close the door  
And let my life be as it was before  
And Ill never never know  
Just how I let you go  
But theres nothing left to say  
Just walk away
