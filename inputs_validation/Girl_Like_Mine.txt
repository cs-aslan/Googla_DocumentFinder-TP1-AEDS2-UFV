Theres a girl in my life  
The best little girl that I could ever find  
Her lips are warm when the nights are cold  
In the summertime she can make it snow  
Shes alright shes alright  
If you want to get a girl thats really fine  
You gotta get a girl a girl like mine  
Shes alright shes alright  
  
You take your girl to a show  
You got to stand in line but she says no  
You finally get your ticket and you walk in  
There shes standing with a silly grin  
But not mine shell stand in line  
If you want to get a girl thats truly fine  
You gotta get a girl a girl like mine  
Cause shes alright shes alright  
  
You buy your girl a fancy dress  
Thats the only way shell look her best  
I give my girl bellbottom slacks  
A big wide belt and shes a gas  
Shes alright shes alright  
If you want to get a girl thats really fine  
You gotta get a girl a girl like mine  
Cause shes alright shes alright
