Where the road is dark and the seed is sowed  
Where the gun is cocked and the bullets cold  
Where the miles are marked in the blood and gold  
Ill meet you further on up the road  
  
Got on my dead mans suit and my smilin skull ring  
My lucky graveyard boots and song to sing  
I got a song to sing keep me out of the cold  
And Ill meet you further on up the road  
  
Further on up the road  
Further on up the road  
Where the way dark and the night is cold  
One sunny mornin well rise I know  
And Ill meet you further on up the road  
  
Now I been out in the desert just doin my time  
Searchin through the dust lookin for a sign  
If theres a light up ahead well brother I dont know  
But I got this fever burnin in my soul  
So lets take the good times as they go  
And Ill meet you further on up the road  
  
Further on up the road Repeat x4  
  
One sunny mornin well rise I know  
And Ill meet you further on up the road  
One sunny mornin well rise I know  
And Ill meet you further on up the road
