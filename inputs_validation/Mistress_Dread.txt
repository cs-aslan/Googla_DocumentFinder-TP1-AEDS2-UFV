Im built like you are  
I have a dress and a train  
Your snake cold lips  
Make a harsh straight line  
That echoes through my brain  
  
Youre perfect  
Let me lift a glass high  
Let me follow in your footsteps  
Let me follow in your sigh  
Let me follow in your sigh  
  
Im a woman who likes men  
But this is something else  
Ive never felt such stirrings  
I feel like I  
Was someone else  
  
I wish youd tie me up and beat me  
Crush me like a kick  
A bleeding strap across my back  
Some blood that you could kiss  
  
Oh kiss away oh kiss away  
I wish there was a strap of blood  
That you could kiss away  
I wish there was a strap of blood  
That you could kiss away  
  
Tie me with a scarf and jewels  
Put a bloody gag to my teeth  
I beg you to degrade me  
Is there waste that I could eat  
  
I am a secret lover  
I am your little girl  
Please spit into my mouth  
Im forever in your swirl  
  
Youre heartless and I love that  
You have no use of me  
  
But I open the sticks sticky legs I bear  
And then insert a fist an arm  
Some lost appendage  
Please open me I beg  
  
You are my Goliath  
You are my Goliath  
And I am mistress dread  
  
Oh I am mistress dread  
Oh I am mistress dread  
Open and release me  
I love you in my head  
  
Oh kiss away kiss away  
Kiss away kiss away  
  
All I ask my baby  
Kiss away  
All I ask my baby  
Kiss away
