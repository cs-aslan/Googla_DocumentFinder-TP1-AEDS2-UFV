My father had dementia  
He lied in bed for months  
Once in a while hed call me  
And ask me to fly down  
I told him that Id love to  
But I had things to do  
And so he died without his son  
I heard about it drunk after a show  
  
My mother battled cancer  
For over seven years  
I nursed her and I held her  
When time was running out  
The night before she left me  
I drank scotch all night  
And thanked her for everything shed done  
Raising me alone wasnt much fun  
  
Dad I can forgive you  
But Ill never forget  
Months I wouldnt see you and when I did  
Youd be out with your friends all night  
Alone and only nine  
I watched the outer limits  
And scared out of my mind  
I wonder if you felt the same  
The days before you died  
I wonder if you even knew  
Why I wouldnt come around  
I bet if you had been there  
There wouldnt be this song  
  
2006 goodbye parents  
For once I am sincere  
2006 my orphan year
