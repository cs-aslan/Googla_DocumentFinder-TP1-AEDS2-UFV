You better change your attitude  
Cause you know you want it to  
You bring me all your pride  
But I know you hold it too  
I can feed your bounty yeah  
If you feed my head as well  
And I wont give you empty promises yeah  
When the quarters in the wishing well  
  
But this aint no sentimental movie  
Where dreams collect like dust  
You talk to me with innocence in your eyes  
So now who can you trust  
  
You think you look so cool  
Yes you do  
You take me for your fool yeah  
Itching for your Of the hug  
Baby I want a new start but dont you be true yeah  
I can see through your door  
You put my head into these walls  
You take my heart to the dockside yeah  
You put me in the car  
And take me for another ride  
  
But this aint no sentimental movie  
Where dreams collect like dust  
You talk to me with innocence in your eyes  
So now who can you trust  
Trust  
Trust  
  
Put a path on to your veins  
And antique and old whores our new pain yeah  
The tears you cried  
All the tears you cried tonight  
Yeah  
You put me down  
But you cant get out of sight  
  
And this aint no sentimental movie  
You push it on  
You grab it on  
But I dont see the tv  
This aint no sentimental movie  
Yeah see the screen  
Youre startin to scream  
Abusin confusin  
Your programs over  
  
This aint no sentimental movie  
Yeah you look so cool  
Dont take me for another one of your scenes  
This aint no sentimental movie  
This aint no sentimental movie  
The tears you cried  
All the tears you cried tonight  
Yeah  
This aint no sentimental movie  
This aint no sentimental movie  
This aint no sentimental movie
