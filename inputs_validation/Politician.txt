Chorus  
Mr politician please dont deceive us  
Mr politician youre there to relieve us  
Just how can we tell mister  
When to believe in you  
  
Oh wont you tell me oh who were lookin out for  
Mr politician could be perfect but people its doubtful  
We want a leader wholl fight for the people  
We want somebody to take us to the steeple  
  
Wed like to point him out to you people  
But dont look now  
  
Chorus  
  
We want a leader of the people  
We want him honest not deceitful  
We want an angel in the public eye  
And we wont give it up lord until we die  
  
Chorus
