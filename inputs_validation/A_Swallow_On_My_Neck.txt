Oh  
I have been smashed again  
With the men from the  
Old Valhalla Road Crematorium  
Boring men with the same old patter  
  
I am a simple man  
Not much to gain or lose  
And I dont know why I held out  
So long for me and you  
  
Until he drew  
A swallow on my neck  
And more I will not say  
He drew  
A swallow deep and blue  
And soon everyone knew  
  
Then I was wrecked again  
With the men full of bluff and ardor  
From a wellknown funeral parlor  
  
I am a simple man  
Not much to gain or lose  
Older and wiser  
Never applies to me  
  
And so he drew  
A swallow on my neck  
And more I will not say  
He drew  
A swallow deep and blue  
And soon everyone knew  
  
Aah  
Oh  
  
You have been telling me  
That I have been  
Acting childish  
Foolish ghoulish and childish  
Oh I know I know I know   
I know I know I know  
But I dont mind  
I dont mind  
I dont mind  
  
Ah  
I dont mind  
Ah
