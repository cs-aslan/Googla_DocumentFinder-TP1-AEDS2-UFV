Im in such a mood  
Turned on by the thought of you  
Youre not around  
So I just sit here and brood  
Amongst a lethal combination  
Kind of midnight mood sedation  
I miss you  
But thats another kind of silence  
Sittin by the fire  
Stare into the flames  
Without you Im as lonely as the night train  
  
Chorus  
And Miles is blowin cool through the room  
I wish that I could be there with you  
Was it the strike of two  
Or the sound of his blues  
Youre going to my head  
And Miles is blowin through the room  
  
Gypsy music for lonely hearts  
Takes care of me while were apart  
If you were here  
Id be dancing with you  
How long must you keep me waiting  
Cant you see the toll its taking  
I need you  
But thats another kind of maddness  
Now Im almost through  
A solo bottle of champagne  
And Im half way through  
Sketches of Spain  
  
Chorus  
And Miles is blowin cool through the room  
I wish that I could be there with you  
Was it the strike of two  
Or the sound of his blues  
Youre going to my head  
And Miles is blowin through the room
