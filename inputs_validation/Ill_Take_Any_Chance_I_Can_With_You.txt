We know better it was bitter baby  
Watching love become a lie  
Now were coming to that point of no returning  
Do you really want to try   
Are the reasons or the chances any better than before   
Are we into something more than we imagined  
That we really cant afford   
Does it matter anymore   
Youre the biggest gamble that Ive ever tried to win  
Maybe more than I can stand to lose  
But girl I never thought Id ever feel this good again  
More than I could dream of coming true  
Ill take any chance I can with you
