I say Ill move the mountains  
And Ill move the mountains  
If he wants them out of the way  
Crazy he calls me  
Sure Im crazy  
Crazy in love Id say  
I say Ill go through fire  
And Ill go through fire  
As he wants it so it shall be  
Crazy he calls me  
Sure Im crazy  
Crazy in love you see  
Like the wind that shakes the bough  
He moves me with a smile  
The difficult Ill do right now  
The impossible will take a little while  
I say Ill care forever  
And I mean forever  
If I have to hold up the sky  
Crazy he calls me  
Sure Im crazy  
Crazy in love am I  
Like the wind that shakes the bough  
He moves me with a smile  
The difficult Ill do right now  
The impossible will take a little while  
I say Ill care forever  
And I mean forever  
If I have to hold up the sky  
Crazy he calls me  
Sure Im crazy  
Crazy in love am I
