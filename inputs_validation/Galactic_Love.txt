Take away your daughters dont stand in front of me  
Take away your young boys I know where Im supposed to be  
Dont ask me to tell you about galactic love  
Im only your cosmic father banished from above  
I was having pipe dreams about congregation scenes  
When Im asked the minister beamed in on me  
Dont ask me to tell you about galactic love  
Im only your cosmic father banished from above  
Take away your daughters dont stand in front of me  
Take away your young boys I dont know how Im supposed to be  
Dont ask me to tell you about galactic love  
Im only a cosmic father banished from above
