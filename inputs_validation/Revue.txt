You makebelieve celebrities  
Taking bows in front of me  
In your dickeybow ties  
In your dickeybow ties  
  
Pick your nose beside the stage  
Jesus Christ has come of age  
So youve had a good cry  
So youve had a good cry  
  
Reach out theres people in the stalls  
A Blackpool season isnt very small  
Reading commercials on TV  
Is just as good as a bad Page 3 review  
  
We all know its so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know its so hard for you  
  
In the dressing room you find  
Telegrams with good luck lines  
So nice to be known  
So nice to be known  
  
The curtain falls so thats the end  
You hit the bottle once again  
So youve had a good crowd  
So youre one of the crowd  
  
Reach out theres people in the stalls  
A Blackpool season isnt very small  
Reading commercials on TV  
Is just as good as a bad Page 3 review  
  
We all know its so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know its so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know its so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know its so hard for you
