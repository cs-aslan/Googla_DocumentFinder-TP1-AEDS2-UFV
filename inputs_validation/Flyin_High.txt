Im flyin high  
And I know the reason why  
Cause the wind of change  
Has blown my way  
And you love me  
As much today as I love you  
Honey as I love you  
  
I used to think  
That love was all so strange  
There was something  
That I used to ease the pain  
Though at times  
It seems it hurts to touch  
Its never gonna hurt  
As much as no love at all  
Honey as no love at all  
  
Flyin high its a crazy feeling  
Flyin high cause  
Ive learnt the meaning of love  
Flyin high its a crazy feeling  
Flyin high cause I believe in love  
  
Im flyin high  
And I guess I know the reason why  
Cause the wind of change  
Has blown my way  
And you love me  
As much today as I love you  
Honey as I love you  
  
Im flyin high  
Im flyin flyin flyin  
Im flyin high  
And I know the reason
