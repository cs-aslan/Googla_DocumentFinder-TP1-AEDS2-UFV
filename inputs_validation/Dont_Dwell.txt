Dont dwell on the past  
Love that was lost and didnt last  
That summer bloom is fading fast  
But Im falling for you  
  
Dont dwell on the pain  
Tears youve cried  
And autumn rain  
That fair weathers here and gone again  
But Im waiting for you  
  
Dont dwell on the loss  
The fool that would steal break and toss  
That winters heart will spurn and doublecross  
But Im yearning for you  
  
Dont dwell on the time  
The seasons change  
And so does the clime  
That old flame has cooled  
But Im burning for you
