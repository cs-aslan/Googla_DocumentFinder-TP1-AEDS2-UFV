Theres not much going on today  
Im really bored its getting late  
What happened to my Saturday Saturday  
Mondays coming the day I hate hate  
  
Sit on the bed alone Bed alone  
Staring at the phone  
  
He wasnt what I wanted what I thought no  
He wouldnt even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
He isnt really what Im looking for  
  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
  
This is when I start to bite my nails  
And clean my room when all else fails  
I think its time for me to bail Time to bail  
This point of view is getting staleale  
  
Sit on the bed alone Bed alone  
Staring at the phone At the phone  
  
He wasnt what I wanted what I thought no  
He wouldnt even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
He isnt really what Im looking for

Na na na na weve all got voices  
Na na na na na stand up make some noise  
Na na na na stand up make some noise  
  
Sit on the bed alone  
Staring at the phone  
  
He wasnt what I wanted what I thought no  
He wouldnt even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
He isnt really what Im looking for  
  
He wasnt what I wanted what I thought no  
He wouldnt even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
Like I was special cause I was special
