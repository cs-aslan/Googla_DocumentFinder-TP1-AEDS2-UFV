Ah ah ah ah ah ah ahhhh ah ah ah ah ah

All you used to do was put me down  
But I found a way to pick myself up off the ground  
And all you used to do was criticize me  
But now I found the good and I emphasise ya see  
  
You would always get so sensitive  
And try to turn your transgressions into my guiltiness  
But now Im certain of the way I live  
And what Im responsible for in this twisted game  
  
And its such a shame  
That you try to make pain  
Another word for my name  
Whether giving or receiving  
Its one the same  
Just one more link  
In your longass chain  
But its time to break  
This frame and my strengthful will  
Time to jump off this negative cycle weve built  
Gave my heart  
But my selfrespection you wont steal  
Now its time to let ya know if you can hear me feel me  
  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ahhhh ah ah ah ah ah  
ah ah ah ah ah ah ahhhh ah ah ah ah ah  
  
So I asked my mama for her two cents  
And then I asked my little sister and I asked my friend  
Then I asked my papa once and I asked him again  
Came two little consensus from all them opinions  
That life is too short to be unhappy  
And since I know what Im worth therell be no settling for dirt  
Knowing what I deserve is gold  
If I want diamonds then I cant settle for coal  
  
Maybe I was just too strong to let go  
Maybe I was just too weak to let it show  
Maybe I was just too stubborn to say No  
But whatever the case I cant take it no more  
  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ahhhh ah ah ah ah ah  
ah ah ah ah ah ah ahhhh ah ah ah ah ah  
  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ahhhh ah ah ah ah ah  
ah ah ah ah ah ah ahhhh ah ah ah ah ah  
  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ahhhh ah ah ah ah ah  
ah ah ah ah ah ah ahhhh ah ah ah ah ah  
  
Sometimes I think maybe well patch it all up  
Like a favourite pair of jeans that you wont give up on  
Or maybe one of these arguments will make up  
And start again like when we started this up  
Back when everything was fresh  
And every moment a blessing  
Id laugh at all of your jokes  
Youd listen to my suggestions  
One mind one soul  
With common decimation  
Now we cant help but fight over the direction
