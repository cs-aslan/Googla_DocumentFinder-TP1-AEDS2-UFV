Look into water see the barracuda  
Patient as the devil  
Hanging still  
Like a shadow in the water  
Pretty barracuda  
Dagger of the devil  
Waiting to kill  
  
Chorus  
Little girl beware of killer barracuda  
He rules these waters like a king  
Hell cut your heart out slicker than a dagger  
Not cause hes hungry cause hes mean  
  
You can see the shark now  
Glidin through the water  
Ugly as death  
Eats anything  
But the pretty barracuda dont touch no leavins  
Takin what he wants to  
Cause hes king  
And you cant scare him or entice him  
He wont move for the devil till his own time  
Then quicker than heartbeat  
Hell turn you away girl just to  
See you fall and leave you dyin  
  
Chorus
