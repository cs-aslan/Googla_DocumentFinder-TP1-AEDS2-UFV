Suburbia where the suburbs met Utopia  
Where the suburbs met Utopia  
  
Lost in the high street where the dogs run  
Roaming suburban boys  
Mothers got a hairdo to be done  
She says theyre too old for toys  
Stood by the bus stop with a felt pen  
In this suburban hell  
And in the distance a police car  
To break the suburban spell  
  
Lets take a ride and run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
You cant hide run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
  
Break a window by the town hall  
Listen the siren screams  
There in the distance like a roll call  
Of all the suburban dreams  
  
Lets take a ride and run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
You cant hide run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
  
I only wanted something else to do but hang around  
I only wanted something else to do but hang around  
Hang around hang around  
  
Its on the front page of the papers  
This is their hour of need  
Wheres a policeman when you need one  
To blame the colour TV  
  
Lets take a ride and run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
You cant hide run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
In Suburbia  
In Suburbia  
  
Run with the dogs tonight  
You cant hide  
Run with the dogs tonight  
You cant hide  
You cant hide you cant hide  
In Suburbia  
  
Suburbia where the suburbs met Utopia  
What kind of dream was this so easy to destroy  
A world together the cities of the past  
Mews slums of the future  
Suburbia where the suburbs met Utopia  
Suburbia where the suburbs met Utopia  
Where the suburbs met Utopia
