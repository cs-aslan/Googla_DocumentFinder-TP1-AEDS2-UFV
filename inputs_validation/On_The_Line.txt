I was drivin along at the end of the day  
I was weary and so all alone  
Looking ahead by the side of the road  
What I saw was the sign Telephone  
  
Chorus  
Talking to you is something I need  
More than I needed before  
If I ever get through wont you give me the time  
Wont you answer my call wont you stay on the line  
  
Its a moment of truth then a shadow of doubt  
Now I need you to stay on the line  
Its never as bad when were talkin it out  
Now I need you to stay on the line  
  
Chorus  
  
Answer my call wont you stay on the line  
  
I believe I have a right to say  
What I want to say  
And I believe it but Im keeping it to myself  
I believe I have a right to do  
What I want to do  
  
All of my life all of my life  
All of my life all of my life  
  
I believe I have a right to be  
Where I want to be  
I believe it and I want to be there with you  
I believe I have a right to see  
Who I want to see  
  
Repeat x2  
All of my life all of my life  
All of my life all of my life
