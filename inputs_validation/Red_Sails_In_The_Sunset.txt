Red sails in the sunset way out on the sea  
Oh carry my loved one home safely to me  
She sailed at the dawning all day Ive been blue  
Red sails in the sunset Im trusting in you  
  
Swift wings you must borrow  
Make straight for the shore  
We marry tomorrow  
And she goes sailing no more  
  
Red sails in the sunset way out on the sea  
Oh carry my loved one home safely to me  
  
Swift wings you must borrow  
Make straight for the shore  
We marry tomorrow  
And she goes sailing no more  
  
Red sails in the sunset  
Way out on the sea oohweeooh weeooh  
Oh carry my loved one  
Home safely to me
