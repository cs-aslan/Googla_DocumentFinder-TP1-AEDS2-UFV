Welcome to the land of fire  
I hope you brought the right attire  
The crippled man is waiting at the door  
  
He said your eyes are much too bright  
The things you say are never right  
The sins of all the world lie on your head  
  
So when you see me look the other way  
Cause ohoh lately all I do is play  
All the glasses in the world say come with me  
  
I need a minute to get my head straight  
Just to hit it before its too late  
In a sin considering my middle name is shake my body  
Take a seat its glittering I shake you in I shake my body  
  
Welcome to the land of fail  
I hope you brought your soul for sale  
The greeters still at home I think he died  
  
The land of smash and fairy tale  
The truth of life is close to hell  
The best youll be is nearly dead or failed  
  
So when you see me look the other way  
Cause lately all I do is say  
These the plans I make believe all come with me  
  
Oh perhaps its all a dream and make believe  
Oh the last of all my dreams but still leave me
