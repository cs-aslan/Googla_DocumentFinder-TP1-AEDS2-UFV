River splashes against the rocks  
And I scale the slope  
I hope the tracks wont  
Lead me down to dark black pits  
Or places where we fall to bits  
If she were there Id hold her down  
Id push her under while she drowns  
And couldnt breathe and claw for air  
She doesnt care for my despair  
  
Or is it me  
The one thats wrong  
You see it in the sea  
River cools where I belong  
In my Mersey paradise  
  
As I stare an oil wheel comes sailing by  
And I feel like  
Growing fins and falling in  
With the bricks the bikes the rusty tin  
I swim around without a care  
Im eating sand when I need air  
You can bet your life  
Ill meet a pike wholl wolf me down for tea tonight  
  
I want to be I want to be  
Where the drownings are  
drownings are  
You see it in the sea  
River cools where I belong  
In my Mersey paradise  
  
I want to be I want to be  
Where the drownings are  
drownings are  
You see it in the sea  
River cools where I belong  
Oh yeah  
I want to be I want to be  
Where the drownings are  
drownings are  
You see it in the sea  
River cools where I belong  
In my Mersey paradise
