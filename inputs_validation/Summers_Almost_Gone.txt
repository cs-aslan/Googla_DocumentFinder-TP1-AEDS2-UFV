Summers almost gone  
Summers almost gone  
Almost gone  
Yeah its almost gone  
Where will we be  
When the summers gone  
Morning found us calmly unaware  
Noon burn gold into our hair  
At night we swim the laughin sea  
When summers gone  
Where will we be  
Where will we be  
Where will we be  
Morning found us calmly unaware  
Noon burn gold into our hair  
At night we swim the laughin sea  
When summers gone  
Where will we be  
Summers almost gone  
Summers almost gone  
We had some good times  
But theyre gone  
The winters comin on  
Summers almost gone
