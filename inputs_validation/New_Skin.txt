Now Im sheddin my skin  
Ya gotta listen to me  
Ill tell ya what I see never belive what you read  
This shit is spreadin like a disease  
Never feel withdrawn time to move on get your groove on  
Say goodbye everything must die solidify  
And fly to a new level  
A place where love is unconditional physical  
And nondenomanitional  
  
Like a snake shed my skin leave my past where Ive been  
Can you feel what I feel  
To hold on must be killed dont cry over whats been spilled  
Yeah yeah  
Can you feel what I feel  
  
See the kid rock pumpin up a down your block with no cares  
Long hair swingin middle fingers in the air  
People stare and point I hit the joint and laugh  
Kiss my ass  
The past is more than 10 years Ive grown from a complete unknown  
Into the high zone million dollar home and a diamond ring  
Never thought Id a mount to a damn thing  
Im the man singin like curtis may  
Mack on homies like ruby day  
Its been a long time comin but you know whats happened  
Straight pimpin and sittin five times platinum
