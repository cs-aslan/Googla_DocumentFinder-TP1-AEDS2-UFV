Go and tell Lord Grenville that the tide is on the turn  
Its time to haul the anchor up and leave the land astern  
Well be gone before the dawn returns  
Like voices onthe wind  
  
Go and tell Lord Grenville that our dreams have run aground  
Theres nothing here to keep us in this shanty town  
None of us are caring where were bound  
Like voices on the wind  
  
And come the day youll hear them saying  
Theyre throwing it all away  
Nothing more to say  
Just throwing it all away  
  
Go and fetch the captains log and tear the pages out  
Were on our way to nowhere now cant bring the helm about  
None of us are left in any doubt  
We wont be back again  
  
Send a message to the fleet theyll search for us in vain  
We wont be there among the reaches of the Spanish Main  
Tell the ones we left home not to wait  
We wont be back again  
  
And come the day youll hear them saying  
Theyre throwing it all away  
Nothing more to say  
Just throwing it all away  
  
Our time is just a point along a line  
That runs forever with no end  
I never thought that we would come to find  
Ourselves upon these rocks again  
  
Go and tell Lord Grenville that the tide is on the turn
