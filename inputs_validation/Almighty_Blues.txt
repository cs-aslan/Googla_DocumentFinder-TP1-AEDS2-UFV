Dont tell me baby  
Cause I already know  
Things could be better  
Not like this Broadway Show  
  
Always a reason  
Theres no time to talk  
I dont want you leaving  
And I surely dont want you to walk  
  
Chorus  
Cause I never felt this way I feel before  
Is this the blues Almighty blues  
Ive never felt so lonely since I lost my one and only  
  
I cant go the distance  
I cant close the door  
Feel alone in a crowd  
I cant take no more  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont need a reason  
To be in your game  
With a losers luck  
Its nothin but a cryin shame  
  
Chorus
