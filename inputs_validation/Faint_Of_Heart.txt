Love aint for the faint of heart  
Timid and the weak  
Pour me one more on the rocks  
And baby well just see  
  
Well start a fire you pour the wine  
Slip on in to these arms of mine  
  
Love aint for the faint of heart  
Loves for you and me  
  
Ooh what a rush when you kiss me that way  
Ooh your touch is gonna drive me crazy  
Ooh what a night this has been  
Baby lets do it again  
  
Love aint for the faint of heart  
Loves for you and me  
  
Ooh what a rush when you kiss me that way  
Ooh your touch is gonna drive me crazy  
Ooh what a night this has been  
Baby lets do it again  
  
Love aint for the faint of heart  
Loves for you and me  
  
Love aint for the faint of heart  
Loves for you and me
