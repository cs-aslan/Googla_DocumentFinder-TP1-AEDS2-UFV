Days turning to night  
Pray for the light  
Let me come through  
Let me take you away over the line  
  
Everyone falling  
Everyone falling  
Dreamers come crawling  
Neighbors jump walling  
Let me come through  
Let me take you away over the line  
  
And were away to be where theres life  
Shake the will to comply  
Fears dont try me  
Tears dont cry me  
  
And were away to be where theres life  
When we come call out  
Everythings sold out  
TV just closed down  
Theres nothing on the news now  
  
Fears dont try me  
Tears dont cry me  
Were away to be where theres life  
Be where theres life  
Be where theres life  
  
Dig out your soul cos here we go  
We gotta move its what we do  
Let me come through  
Let me take you  
Away to be where theres life  
To be where theres life  
To be where theres life  
  
Take you over the light  
Under the signs  
In through locked doors  
To secret floors  
Where weve lost em before
