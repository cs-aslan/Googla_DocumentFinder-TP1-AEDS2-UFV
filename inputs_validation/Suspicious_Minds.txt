Were caught in a trap  
I cant walk out  
Because I love you too much baby  
  
Why cant you see  
What youre doing to me  
When you dont believe a word I say  
  
We cant go on together  
With suspicious minds suspicious minds  
And we cant build our dreams  
On suspicious minds  
  
So if an old friend I know  
Drops by to say hello  
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes  
  
Here we go again  
Asking where Ive been  
You cant see the tears are real  
Im crying yes Im crying  
  
We cant go on together  
With suspicious minds suspicious minds  
And we cant build our dreams  
On suspicious minds  
  
Slane Thats true that Ive been in all the castles  
But for now on youre the only castle in my life  
Im yours for life baybe Here we go  
  
Were caught in a trap  
I cant walk out  
Because I love you too much baby  
  
Why cant you see  
What youre doing to me  
When you dont believe a word I say  
  
Were caught in a trap  
I cant walk out x6
