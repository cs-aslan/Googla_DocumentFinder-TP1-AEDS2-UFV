Its finally come  
Is that sorry on your breath  
Where were you when  
I was sitting back here  
Missing you to death  
It dont matter now  
How I want to know  
Can you tell me plain and true  
How high will you fly  
Without me there to be your sky  
Well it dont matter now  
  
Dont mean to leave you  
Standing on your own  
I think back on days and nights  
We had long ago  
Maybe love  
Is just a game you play  
This much I do know  
It dont matter now  
  
Its finally come  
Is that sorry on your breath  
Where were you when  
I was sitting back here  
Missing you to death  
It dont matter now  
Now I dont tell stories  
And I dont pretend  
I wont be around  
To say I told you then  
Cause it seems like somethings  
Finally broken  
Thatll take a lot of mend  
But it dont matter now  
  
Is that sorry on your breath  
Where were you when I  
Was sitting back here  
Missing you to death  
It dont matter now  
It dont matter now  
It dont matter now
