Turn me up dont turn me down  
Cut me up dont let me down  
  
Chorus  
Find find a way  
Find a way to get out wit out hit out  
You dig in dig out you get out  
Ghetto musick ghetto musick  
Find a way to get in to fit in the ghetto  
You get out wit out a dime  
Ghetto musick ghetto musick  
  
Climbing out this hole climbin out this hole  
With a frown on my face  
In the place to be in the place to be and not to be at the same time  
GhettomusIck stay down  
Outkast oh yeah just know that we wont play round  
If feet dont stank like they stank then they cant swallow that down  
Your battleship is sunk I wish grandma could see us  
  
Chorus  
  
I just want you to know how I feel  
Feeling good feeling great  
Feeling great feeling good how are you  
I just want you to know how I feel  
Feeling good feeling great  
Feeling great feeling good how are you  
  
Hot tub Back to the bony im tony  
Ask my grandmama Edna Mae Kearse she show me  
How to be the smooth operator dominator in the state of Georgia  
Hip hops there to destroy ya  
Leave a mother fucker open like a foyer  
He from the dirt now here come the paranoia  
A lawyer couldnt object or disrespect  
The technique Sweat me wipe off the sweat  
Fight off the shit and flush the waste down  
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground  
Find my purpose on the surface of this earth this  
Planets standards to me they have no purpose  
Campaign in vein for the same lame fame people obtain you ought to be
detained  
By the hip hop sheriff locked up  
No possibility of getting out cause the shit you make is killing me and my
ears and my peers  
I hear the end is near no fear  
We disappear then reappear again in a fresh new light  
I hope its peaceful and cloudy cause if its not we gotta fight like fight
like  
  
GhettomusIck stay down  
Outkast just know that we wont play round  
If feet dont stank like they stank then they cant swallow that down  
Your battleship is sunk I wish grandma could see us  
  
Chorus  
  
I just want you to know how I feel  
Feeling good feeling great  
Feeling great feeling good how are you  
I just want you to know how I feel  
Feeling good feeling great  
Feeling great feeling good how are you
