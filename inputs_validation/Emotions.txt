Youve got me feeling emotions  
Deeper than Ive ever dreamed of  
Woh ohYouve got me feeling emotions  
higher than the heavens above  
I feel good I feel nice  
Ive never felt so satisfied  
Im in love Im alive  
Intoxicated flying high  
It feels like a dream  
When you touch me tenderly  
I dont know if its real  
But I like the way I feel inside  
Youve got me feeling emotions deeper than Ive ever dreamed of  
Woh ohYouve got me feeling emotions  
Higher than the heavens above  
In the morning when I rise  
You are the first thing on my mind  
And in the middle of the night  
I feel your heartbeat next to mine  
It feels like a dream  
When you love me tenderly  
I dont know if youre for real  
But I like the way I feel inside  
Youve got me feeling emotions  
Deeper than Ive ever dreamed of  
Woh ohYouve got me feeling emotions  
Higher than the heavens above  
Youve got me feeling emotions  
Deeper than Ive ever dreamed of  
Woh ohYouve got me feeling emotions  
Higher than the heavens above  
You know the way to make me lose control  
When youre looking into my eyesyou make me feel so high  
Youve got me feeling emotions  
Deeper than Ive ever dreamed of  
Woh ohYouve got me feeling emotions  
Higher than the heavens above  
Youve got me feeling emotions  
Deeper than Ive ever dreamed of  
Woh ohYouve got me feeling emotions  
Higher than the heavens above  
Youve got me feeling higher
