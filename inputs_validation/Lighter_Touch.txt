Look at me the answer is so clear  
Lying close by the fire place  
I wish that you could see yourself this way  
My love with the firelight upon your face  
  
Aint it strange how love put things together  
One like you someone like me  
But no one ever moved me like the way you do  
And held against you love I am weak oh yeah  
  
Before us now the dream of love is playin  
A butterfly risin from the flame  
You and me dont need no chain  
Since this feeling came to us  
A touch of love a lighter touch  
  
This touch of love this lighter touch  
Than hands of love through time  
Reaching up to have and to hold you  
But you know Ill always stay If I  
Am free to go You know Ill take  
Your love into my soul Be lighter  
Touch of love this lighter lighter  
Lighter touch
