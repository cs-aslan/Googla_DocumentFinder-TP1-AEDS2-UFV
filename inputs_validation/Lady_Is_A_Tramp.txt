She gets too hungry for dinner at eight  
She loves the theater but doesnt come late  
Shed never bother with people shed hate  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
  
Doesnt like crap games with barons and earls  
Wont go to Harlem in ermine and pearls  
Wont dish the dirt with the rest of those girls  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
  
She loves the free fresh wind in her hair  
Life without care  
Shes broke but its ok  
She hates California its cold and its damp  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
  
Doesnt like dice games with sharpies and frauds  
Wont go to Harlem in Lincolns or Fords  
Wont dish the dirt with the rest of those broads  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
  
Ive wined and dined on mulligan stew  
And never wished for turkey  
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too  
From Maine to Albuquerque  
Alas I missed the BeauxArts Ball and what is twice as sad  
I was never at a party where they honored Noel Caad  
But social circles spin too fast for me  
My Hobohemia is the place to be  
  
I get too hungry for dinner at eight  
I like the theatre but never come late  
I never bother with people I hate  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
  
I dont like crap games with Barons and Earls  
Wont go to Harlem in ermine and pearls  
Wont dish the dirt with the rest of the girls  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
  
I like the free fresh wind in my hair life without care  
Im broke its okey  
Hate California its cold and its damp  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
  
I go to Coney  the beach is divine  
I go to ball games  the bleachers are fine  
I follow Winchell and read every line  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
  
I like a prize fight that isnt a fake  
I love the rowing on Central park lake  
I go to opera and stay wide awake  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
  
I like the green grass under my shoes what can I lose  
Im flat Thats that  
Im all alone when I lower my lamp  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
  
Dont know the reason for cocktails at five  
I dont like flying  Im glad Im alive  
I crave affection but not when I drive  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
  
Folks went to London and left me behind  
I missed the crowning  Queen Mary didnt mind  
Wont play Scarlett in Gone With the Wind  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
  
I like to hang my hat where I please sail with the breeze  
No dough  Heigh  Ho I still like Roosevelt  
And think hes a champ  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
  
Girls get massages they cry and they moan  
Tell Lizzie Arden to leave me alone  
Im not so hot but my shape is my own  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
  
The food at Rectors is perfect no doubt  
I wouldnt know what the Ritz is about  
I drop a nickel and coffee comes out  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
  
I like the sweet fresh rain in my face  
Diamonds and lace  no got so what  
For Robert Taylor I whistle and stamp  
Thats why the lady is a tramp
