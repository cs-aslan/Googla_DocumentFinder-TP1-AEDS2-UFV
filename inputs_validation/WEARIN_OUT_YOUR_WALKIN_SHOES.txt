Well you cant live with em you cant live without em  
Yet theres something mighty necessary bout em  
A woman will give you the blues  
Shell have you pullin out your hair  
And wearin out your walkin shoes  
Well they just keep naggin until your head is saggin  
There aint a wink asleepin when they startin weepin  
Cause a woman will give you the blues  
Shell have you bitin off your nails  
And wearin out your walkin shoes  
Its a losin gamble when you start to ramble  
Oh lordy how you miss em and you long to kiss em  
Cause a woman will give you the blues  
Shell have you tossin in your sleep  
And wearin out your walkin shoes  
Well you cant live with em you cant live without em  
Its better to talk with em than to talk about em  
Cause a woman will give you the blues  
Shell have you talkin to yourself  
And wearin out your walkin shoes
