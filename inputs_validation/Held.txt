Two months is too little  
They let him go  
They had no sudden healing  
To think that providence would  
Take a child from his mother while she prays  
Is appalling  
  
Who told us wed be rescued  
What has changed and why should we be saved from nightmares  
Were asking why this happens  
To us who have died to live  
Its unfair  
  
Chorus  
This is what it means to be held  
How it feels when the sacred is torn from your life  
And you survive  
This is what it is to be loved  
And to know that the promise was  
When everything fell wed be held  
  
This hand is bitterness  
We want to taste it let the hatred numb our sorrow  
The wise hands opens slowly to lilies of the valley and tomorrow  
  
Chorus  
  
If hope is born of suffering  
If this is only the beginning  
Can we not wait for one hour watching for our Savior  
  
Chorus
