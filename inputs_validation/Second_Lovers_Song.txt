Youre wakin next to me  
Tears splash across the sun  
You whisper soft to me  
That I aint the only one  
To breathe your yellow hair  
Caress your bosom fair  
Do you think I really care  
Do you think it matters  
  
What do your feelins mean  
Do you think Id love more  
If you stood pure and clean  
Of those youd known before  
Would your words be sweeter then  
Upon Novembers wind  
If you began again  
Could your smile be softer  
Would your eyes more brightly shine  
Would your laughter be so tender  
If youd been only mine  
For as long as you remember  
  
I dont want tears from you  
Dont build your love on shame  
All what weve done is through  
And all we can do remains  
My lady cant you see  
I love not jealously  
But for all you are to me  
And all youll be tomorrow
