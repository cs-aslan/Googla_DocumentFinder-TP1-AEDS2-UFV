You know I wanna  
Get a little somethin  
You didnt know  
Little  
It aint what you got baby  
Its what you do with it  
And you doin it  
You doin it  
  
And my guilty pleasure is inspiring my desire  
Caught in a love affair with feminine narcotic style  
So fine you got good taste  
But I hate to see your pretty body go to waste  
Before I see you in the bare necessities  
Like Coco de Mer or La  babe  
Get me aroused in that intimate attire  
Erotic fantasies you know just what I like  
Think you got a secret everybody knows  
Lady in the street in bed hos and me  
Wearin Cosabella with nothin but a trench coat  
Nothins better  
  
Girl youre sexy  
When you slip it on  
Love to see you in it  
If you add a little splash  
You can have a lot of fun  
You know what Im talkin about  
  
Chorus  
Cause Im a freak for sexy lingerie  
Wearing a teddy and a thong with the highstrung lace  
Sew on that garter if you wanna make me go harder  
Do G strings and pumps  
A sheer baby doll put it on  
Is it up to her  
  
Girl youre a goddess  
So when you sip that  on  
Stop your sexy silhouette  
On the wall turns me on oh  
Good god your bod and my bod  
Keep deep dont mope when I say  
Nice but nasty I wanna tell your man  
I do what I say  
  
Girl youre sexy  
When you put it on  
Love to see you in it  
Cause when you add a little splash  
You can have a lot of fun  
You know what youre doin  
  
Chorus x2  
  
What you gonna do  
You gonna put it on  
Girl you so sexy  
Aint gotta take it off  
I want you to feed my fetish  
Slide them thigh highs down  
Looking at you got me up  
Throw them heels back on cmon  
  
Oh  
  
Put it on  
Girl you know you turn me on  
On hey oh  
  
Chorus x3
