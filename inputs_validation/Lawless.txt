In the dead of night  
I become someone else  
Cut all my ties  
Blow my mind off the shelf  
  
Were the lawless brigade  
Up all night up all night  
Were the lawless brigade  
Up all night and no strain  
  
Let it rise  
Way out of control  
You cant disguise  
Whats inevitable  
  
Were the lawless brigade  
Up all night and up all night  
Were the lawless brigade  
Up all night no strain  
  
Oooaaoh  
Oooaaoh  
Oooaaoh  
  
Cause your time is getting more than ever  
  
In the dead of night  
I become someone else  
Cut all my ties  
Blow my mind off the shelf  
  
Were the lawless brigade  
Up all night and up all night  
Were the lawless brigade  
Up all night no strain  
  
Were the lawless brigade  
Up all night and up all night  
Were the lawless brigade  
Up all night no strain
