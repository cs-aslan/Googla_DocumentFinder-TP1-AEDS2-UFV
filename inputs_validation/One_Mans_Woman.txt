Shes got dinner on the table at seven  
The kids are tucked in bed by ninefifteen  
And shes headed for a hotel at eleven  
To meet a man her familys never seen  
As the elevator takes her to her lover  
She thinks about his wife at home asleep  
And she knows it must be painful to discover  
That the man you loves not always yours to keep  
Well shes one mans bride  
And shes one mans on the side  
She wonders why it takes two men  
To keep her satisfied  
Shes a hard workin housewife  
Right now shes occupied  
Shes one mans woman  
And one mans on the side  
Yes shes one mans woman  
And one mans on the side  
She thinks about her husband when its over  
But she justifies her love affair somehow  
She knows it cant go on like this forever  
But she takes it all from day to day for now
