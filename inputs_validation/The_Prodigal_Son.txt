g a prodigal son once c strayed from his g father  
To travel a land of a hunger and d pain  
And g now I can see the c end of my g journey  
Im going to d heaven ag gain  
I leave you the day to help all your neighbors  
I leave you the night to solemnly pray  
So try to repent and ask for forgiveness  
Well meet up in heaven someday  
Goodbye to this world with all its sorrows  
Goodbye to the fields that I used to roam  
Im going away where life is eternal  
My shepherd is callin me home  
From out of the sky hes coming to meet me  
To wash all my sins and call me his own  
His servants will bring a ring for my finger  
And never no more will I roam
