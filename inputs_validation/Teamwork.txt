When two guys pull together its teamwork  
In foul or sunny weather its teamwork  
What does it take to make any business climb  
Youll find it takes teamwork every time  
  
Incidentally your jokes will kill the yokels its teamwork  
I love your hokey vocals its teamwork  
Like Fred Astaire and Ginger yet twice as chic  
Well give them that teamwork cheek to cheek  
  
Here we are just like in Zanzibar  
Still nothing still a star  
Thats quite a stab from old flab  
They always pay us plenty for teamwork  
We split it 8020 thats teamwork  
Yours is tax free  
When others start to part and go off the beam  
Like Siamese brothers well be on each others team  
  
No fuss about the billing its teamwork  
The smallest type is thrilling its teamwork  
Although we hold each other in low esteem  
Were loaded with teamwork  
Hey now  
Whats life without teamwork  
Go boy  
Unless you got teamwork theres no team
