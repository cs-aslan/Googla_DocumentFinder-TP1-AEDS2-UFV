Everyday and night I pray  
Love will swing you back this way  
Life without you here with me  
Aint the same without you g  
  
Baby hear me I never meant to hurt you  
Baby come and talk to me  
Let me know whats on your mind  
Every time I see you  
Youre running from me all the time  
  
Baby hear me I never meant to hurt you  
I only wanted you to be happy  
You to have the best of things  
To be down with me baby  
cause your lovin its so good  
  
Youre giving me the runaround  
Thought our love was going down  
Baby dont you know  
That Im down until the day I die  
Baby hear me never meant to hurt you  
Now you know ill never do anything to hurt you  
cause baby I love you  
  
Every night and day I pray  
Your love returns  
Oh Id give my life  
If it would only make you happy  
  
Rap notorious B I G  
Sittin reminiscin on when you started dissin  
Spittin in faces in public places  
Rolexes with faces had you chipper for months  
Made some dough did some shows now youre starting to front  
Smokin blunts on the veranda with amanda  
Shes fillin your head with he said she said  
Poppa doin this poppa doin that  
But dont tell him I said it cause my jeep might get wetted  
Forget it go on take her word like the koran  
Yall stay friends ill stay and smoke phil benzs  
Honeysuckle sets biggie secret pyjama sets  
You were the reebok vandal now you were chanel sandals  
I made you  why would I play you  
Think about it while the streets you roam  
Its all peas and crispies in the fridge when you get home  
  
Chorus  
You to be be happy  
You to have the best of things  
Baby everything you want it for baby  
You to be down with me  
So give me that ass back baby  
cause your lovin is so good so damn good babe  
  
Everyday and night I pray love will swing you back this way  
Life without you here with me aint the same without you g  
  
Chorus
