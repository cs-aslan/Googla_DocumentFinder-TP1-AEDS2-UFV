Here we are in the west  
And our cars are glistenin  
The bear he roars in the east  
But we aint listenin  
We wont play games in his backyard  
But we let him build his wall  
We say our god is on our side  
Hope hes listenin to us all  
  
While we talk  
  
Hes gettin dressed hes lookin for his thrills  
Hes gettin dressed to kill  
  
We got eyes in the stars  
But we dont care what they see  
We put a man on the moon  
We all see it on tv  
We all protest about his bombs  
He hopes we keep it going  
And while we rest hes marchin on  
His fuse has started glowin  
  
While we talk  
  
Hes gettin dressed hes lookin for his thrills  
Hes gettin dressed to kill  
  
What have you got to hide at home  
His arms are stained but never empty  
The things that you think you own  
Are only for the few  
Dont you think its time dont you think its time  
We got ready we got ready  
  
We got right on our side  
So our leaders say today  
Count the size of the threat  
We can slide a different way  
Our planes are flyin in your sky  
We know just what theyre sayin  
You see the writing on the wall  
Your nerves are tearinfrayin  
  
While we talk  
  
Hes gettin dressed  
Hes lookin for his thrills  
Hes gettin dressed to kill  
  
Hes gettin dressed  
Hes lookin for his thrills  
Hes gettin dressed to kill
