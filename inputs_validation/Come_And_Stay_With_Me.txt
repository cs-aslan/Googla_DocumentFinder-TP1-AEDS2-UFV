Ill send away all my false pride  
And Ill forsake all of my life  
Yes Ill be as true as true can be  
If youll come and stay with me  
  
All lovers of the past Ill leave behind  
Theyll never be another on my mind  
Ill do all I can so youll feel free  
If youll come and stay with me  
  
The promise I made most faithfully  
Ill keep still if you decide to leave  
Ill try and see that you have all you need  
If youll come and stay with me  
  
Yes Ill be as true as true can be  
If youll come and stay with me  
  
Live a life no others have ever known  
But I know you think that Im hardly grown  
Oh thank God at last and finally  
I can see youre gonna stay with me  
I can see youre gonna stay with me
