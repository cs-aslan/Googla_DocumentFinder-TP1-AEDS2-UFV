There is too much hatred there is too much starvation too much inhumanity  
  
Some people get the kicks out of throwing bricks at me  
No real reason just jealousy  
Angry words and bad attitudes is gonna get you nowhere  
  
Watching you watching me its alright cause I will make it right  
  
Chorus  
Love has the power its strong as a tower you can lean on  
Love is a fire a burning desire its so warm oh  
  
Some believe in the almighty dollar some dont believe in nothing at all  
Theres a power thats within you it will never never ever let you down  
  
Im the way Im the key to liberty and unity are you listening  
  
Chorus  
  
One hundred million voices singing can you hear the voices singing  
No weak no strong no right no wrong  imagine you gotta keep imagining  
Impossible the sceptics saywait and see theres gonna come a day  
  
Chorus  
  
Love has the power its strong as a tower you can lean on  
Love has the power its strong as a tower you can lean on  
  
Theres no difference between black or white the light of life  
I can hear the children laughing  
Men at war stop your worries give peace a chance theres a new day dawning  
Come together come together come together  
Wisdom is the mouth of peace of innocence
