The judge found me guilty of wrong doing  
And sentaced me to hang in midJuly  
He said to me Your lifes a ruin  
If I was you Id breake right down a cry  
Well Nobody seems to care I aint guilty  
I never did the things they said Ive done  
But I guess they have to hang somebody  
And Its looking like Im gonna be the one  
So send my body home on a freight trian  
Dont worry none if I dont go 1st class  
Send my body home of a fright train  
So everyone can see me when I pass  
Dont worry none about no fancy funeral  
Cause it dont matter how they lay me down  
Just see they bury me out by Mamas Apple Tree  
And send my body back to my home town  
My Mama was a damm ahrd working woman  
And she tried to raise he kids without a fault  
The last thing sh said she was on her dying bed was Son ont get in trouble
with the law  
When the time comes to meet my maker  
Im gonna try my very best  
To take it like a man  
When they ask if I have one request  
Ill just say send my body home on a freight trian  
Dont worry none if I dont go 1st class  
Send my body home of a fright train  
So everyone can see me when I pass  
Dont worry none about no fancy funeral  
Cause it dont matter how they lay me down  
Just see they bury me out by Mamas Apple Tree  
And send my body back to my home town
