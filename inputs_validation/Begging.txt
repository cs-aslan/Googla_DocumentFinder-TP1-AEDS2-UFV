Put your loving hand out baby  
Im begging  
  
Begging begging  
Put your loving hand out baby  
Begging begging you  
Put your loving hand out baby  
  
Riding high when I was king  
Played it hard and fast  
Cause I had everything  
You walked away won me then  
But easy come and easy go  
And it would end  
  
Begging Im begging you  
Wont you give your hand out baby  
Begging begging  
Put your loving hand out baby  
  
I need you to understand  
That I tried so hard  
To be your man  
The kind of man you want in the end  
Only then can I begin to live again  
  
An empty shell  
Used to be  
Shadow of my life  
Is hanging over me  
  
Broken man without a throne  
Wont even stand the devils dance  
To win my soul  
  
Begging begging you  
  
Wont you give your hand out baby  
Begging begging you  
Put your loving hand out baby  
  
Im fighting hard  
To hold my own  
No I just cant make it  
All alone  
  
Im holdin on  
I cant fall back  
Now that big brass ring  
Is a shade of black  
  
Begging Im begging you  
Wont you give your hand out baby  
Begging begging  
Put your loving hand out baby  
  
Begging begging you
