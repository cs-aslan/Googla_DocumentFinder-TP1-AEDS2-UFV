Ive been trying to run my life  
Using every trick I knew  
I say anything anytime to anybody  
I do what I always wanted to  
But thats no way to keep me happy  
Its an old disguise  
  
I may be wealthy but I can still be wise  
Drop my old disguise  
I cant seem to end my day  
Until I feel somethings said and done  
A flashy guitar or a hot new car  
Or at least a little fun  
But thats no way to keep me healthy  
Its an old disguise  
I may be wealthy but I can still be wise  
Drop my old disguise  
  
Drop it drop it its an old disguise  
Drop it drop it open up your eyes  
Drop it drop it you aint got nine lives  
Drop it drop it
