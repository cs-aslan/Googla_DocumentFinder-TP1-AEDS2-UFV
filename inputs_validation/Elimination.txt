Terminal what disease  
Told me too late  
Whats this cough and wheeze  
Fatal youre shittin me  
A second opinion  
Is what I need  
Laughin in a windstorm  
Blowin all the cornstalks down  
Cryin in a funeral home  
Forward my mail six feet underground  
  
Elimination  
  
Contagious say why not  
Not just me  
Waitin to rot  
Painful yeah I know  
When I had to go  
Im yankin on my plug  
And I cant seem to get it loose  
Pullin all the stops  
Your ideals change when you got  
Nothing to loose  
  
Elimination  
Eliminate the right  
Eliminate the wrong  
Eliminate the weak  
Eliminate the strong  
Eliminate your feelings  
Eliminate too late  
Eliminate the hope  
Eliminate eliminate  
  
If I had just one more day  
Id turn it all around  
Id make a play of good clean livin  
And dig me out of the ground  
And if I had just one more day  
Id say it to your face  
Pull the plug on everyone  
Eliminate this race  
We want to cure  
And we want it now  
Reissue hope  
We dont eare how  
Youre makin a mess  
Diseasin a nation  
Runaway train to elimination  
  
Hopeless theres no doubt  
Set on a slow burn  
From the inside out  
Carefully say what for  
Last one out  
Closes the coffin door  
Spendin all you saved  
And wishin for a little more  
If Im lookin at the ceilin  
Then I must be layin on the floor  
  
Terminal what disease  
Told me too late  
Whats this cough and wheeze  
Fatal youre shittin me  
A second opinion  
Theres gotta be  
Laughin at the epidemic  
Something is going around  
Crying at the epidemic  
Pullin on nails six feet underground
