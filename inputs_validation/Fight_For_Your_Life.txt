Get a grip on the action  
Im moving heaven and earth  
Dont let go of the action  
Push for all that youre worth  
  
No denying  
It goes against the grain  
So Defying  
Youre screaming again  
  
Fight for your life  
Fight for your money  
Fight for your life  
Fight for your money  
  
Time for steel stop at nothing  
Looking fate in the face  
We dont take no for an answer  
  
Grab the lead in the race  
Rock hard with a purpose  
Got a mind that wont bend  
A hard resolution  
That is true to the end
