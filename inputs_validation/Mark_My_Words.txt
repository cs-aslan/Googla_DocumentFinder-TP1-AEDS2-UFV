Chorus  
Mark my words thats all that I have  
Mark my words give you all I got  
In every way I will  
Youre the only reason why  
Oh I dont wanna live a lie  
Mark my words  
Mark my words  
  
Verse  
So you heard it all before  
Falling in and out of trust  
Trying to rekindle us  
Only to lose yourself  
But I wont let me lose you  
And I wont let us just fade away  
After all that weve been through  
Ima show you more than I ever could say  
  
Chorus  
Mark my words thats all that I have  
Mark my words give you all I got  
In every way I will  
Youre the only reason why  
Oh I dont wanna live a lie  
Mark my words  
Mark my words
