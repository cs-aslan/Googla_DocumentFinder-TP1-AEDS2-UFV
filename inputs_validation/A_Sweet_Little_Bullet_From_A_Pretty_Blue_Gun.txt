Well its raining its pouring  
You didnt bring a sweater  
Nebraskall never let you come back home  
  
Now on Hollywood and Vine  
By the Thrifty Mart sign  
Any night Ill be willin to bet  
  
Theres a young girl  
With sweet little dreams and pretty blue wishes  
Standin there just gettin all wet  
  
Now theres a place off the drag  
Called the Gilbert Hotel  
And theres a couple letters  
Burned out in the sign  
  
And its better than a bus stop  
They do good business every time it rains  
For little girls with nothing in their jeans  
But pretty blue wishes and sweet little jeans  
  
And its raining its pouring  
The old man is snoring  
Now I lay me down to sleep  
I hear the sirens in the street  
All my dreams are made of chrome  
I have no way to get back home  
Id rather die before I wake  
Like Marilyn Monroe  
And you could throw my dreams out in the street  
And let the rain make em grow  
  
Now the night clerk he got a club foot  
Hes heard every hard luck story  
At least a hundred times or more  
  
He says check out time is 10 am  
And thats just what it means  
Go on up the stairs  
With sweet little wishes and pretty blue dreams  
  
And its raining its pouring  
And Hollywoods just fine  
Swindle a little girl out of her dreams  
Another letter in the sign  
  
Now never trust a scarecrow wearin shades after dark  
Be careful of that old bow tie he wears  
It takes a sweet little bullet from a pretty blue gun  
To put those scarlet ribbons in your hair  
  
No that aint no cherry bomb  
Fourth of Julys all done  
Just some fool playin that second line  
From the barrel of a pretty blue gun  
  
No that aint no cherry bomb  
Fourth of Julys all done  
Just some fool playin that second line  
From the barrel of a pretty blue gun
