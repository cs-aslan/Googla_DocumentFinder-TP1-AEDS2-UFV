Youve got the loving touch that I need so much  
Youve got the loving touch that I need so much  
No matter how I try your love I couldnt buy  
Cause I need so much of your love  
  
Ive got the world at my fingers and it stands at my feet  
I can fly to the moon or I can sleep in the street  
Theres nothing in this world I couldnt do  
I get all that I want just by the wave of a hand  
Theres nothing on earth that wont obey my command  
And now I find that all I need is you  
  
I could give the world for you to hold and you know I could  
Everything Id touch would turn to gold and you know it would  
But I need something else thats only yours for the giving  
I need something else to make my life worth living
