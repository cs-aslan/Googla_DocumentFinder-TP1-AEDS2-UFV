Still these allergies remain  
My hand cant touch a guitar string  
My fingers just burn and ache  
My had intercedes with my bodily needs  
And my body wont give it a break  
My heart can stand a disaster  
My heart can take a disgrace  
But my heart is allergic  
To the women I love  
And its changing the shape of my face  
  
Allergies  
Allergies  
Somethings living on my skin  
Doctor please  
Doctor please  
Open up its me again  
  
I go to a famous physician  
I sleep in the local hotel  
From what I can see of the people like me  
We get better  
But we never get well  
So I ask myself this question  
Its a question I often repeat  
Where do allergies go  
When its after a show  
And they want to get something to eat

Open up its me again
