Really you kiddin bitch Im the prodigal son  
And Im stuntin like my daddy ddrddrinkin like my mama

Right Yeah ho But I just hit the surface  
And Im bout to walk into a bank with a shank and a black can of paint to

And I hit the syrup and Im feeling like I might just hit the curb

Hello toots you look so eloquent thats what I tell a cunt

They say I act like an asshole when I pull up at the White Castle  
And I ask for an application throw it back in her face an

In the head with a Whopper that I bought from BK
