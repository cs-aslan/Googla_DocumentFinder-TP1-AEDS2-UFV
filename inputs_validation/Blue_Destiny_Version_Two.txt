Once you were mine  
And you wanted the whole world know  
Now evry time Im around  
Youve got somewhere to go  
I ask my heart evry day  
Can there be some other way  
Tell me what can I do  
To change my blue destiny  
  
First you decide  
That our love will always be true  
Next thing I know  
Youre running with somebody new  
Once you were mine alone  
Now youre just someone Ive known  
Tell me what can I do  
To change my blue destiny  
  
And there were times  
When love was new  
And both our hearts were gay  
But now the signs says were through  
And bound for separate ways  
  
And how can you love  
When your love doesnt want you at all  
Girl when you turn me away  
Got my back to the wall  
  
Still Id forgive all your lies  
Cause darlin I realize that its you  
Only you can change my blue destiny  
Baby you only you  
Can change my blue destiny
