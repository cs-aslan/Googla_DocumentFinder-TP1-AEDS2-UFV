Bam boom what you gone do cous  
Guess Im rolling in with them baby blue chucks  
And I still got my khakis creased  
Im still rocking on these beats and got a bad rep on the streets  
Its the SNdoubleOP and biggest dogg of em all  
And yous a flea and  
And since I got time to drop it for you I guess I must  
And give it to you mother fuckers like bustabust  
I keep the heat on deck but in God we trust  
And cant none of yall fuck wit us  
But you can run up on the G but thats not thinking wisely  
These pullas are contagious just like Ron Isley  
What the hell is going on Someones sleeping in my home  
Snoop to the DODouble G  
Get in where you fit in follow me  
  
Chorus  
Whos the man with that dance Snoop dogg Snoop Dogg  
Who kick the khakis from his pants Snoop dogg Snoop Dogg  
Get the dro low anything will stand Snoop dogg Snoop Dogg  
Still rock the gin n juice in hand Snoop dogg Snoop Dogg  
  
I do it for the Gs and I do it for the hustlaz  
Here to annihilate you markass busters  
Fuck the police cause all they wanna do is cuff us  
The one nigga is chilly as if his name was Usher  
But Im still riding in macks making em G stacks  
And got them corn rows to the back  
I aint really trying to be picky  
But if you give me somethin its got to be the sticky  
Doing by the ounces Lo los bouncing  
Ninety doing faking with kissing on the couching  
Boo to the ouchin more a fountain  
But thats how we get another doggy dogg housing  
This year we aint fuck with thousands  
We clean with millions and we fly as a falcon  
Pull up to the Doggy Dogg Pound with a car fulla bitches  
Fuckin grits like Alice  
  
Chorus  
  
Three 14 inch rims is running on the side They riding on the side

Take two and pass it it will not burn you  
From the Long Beach chronicles to the Wall Street Journal  
They all know the G with the cut in his coupe  
Ask Bill Gates yeah I know the homie Snoop  
Yeah Im still loaded hanging with my folk and  
Follow Rakim cause I Aint No Joke  
Cause I done seen so much enough to have your felons touched  
When the gunshots ratta all ya boys scatta  
Check up on ya homies but they gave ya bad data  
Nigga fucking stop breathing

What I say cause what I say is so real  
Homie you don wanna see da steel  
You dont wanna catch a body You cant hear the party  
Now thats what you should do now wheres my babyboo  
  
Chorus
