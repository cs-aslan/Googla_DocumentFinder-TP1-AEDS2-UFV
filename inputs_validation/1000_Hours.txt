Starlit night  
The moon is shining bright  
You are the one I need  
Up at your window  
I see a shadow  
Silhouette of your grace  
Heres this flower  
I picked for all the hours  
That youve spent with me  
The one I love  
That Ive been dreaming of  
Sailing across the sea  
  
Chorus  
Let my hands flow through  
Your hair moving closer  
A kiss well share  
Passionate love to be all night long  
Well never break as one too strong  
  
Nothings more  
Than what our love is for  
As I kiss your cheek  
Oh so softly  
Hands flowing down my back  
One thousand hours Ill never leave  
Our romance  
Is a love trance  
And now well never part  
One thousand hours  
Of such a love shower  
Well never stop once we start  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Strong
