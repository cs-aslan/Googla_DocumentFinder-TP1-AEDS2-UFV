Lot of havoc in the sea  
People rushing endlessly  
Sometimes I think its just their way  
Of capturing a better day  
You keep rushing home baby  
For your dose of reality  
Ill hold out my hands to you  
You do what you need to  
  
Ohh whoa  
I will comfort you I will comfort you  
Ohh whoa  
I will comfort you I will comfort you  
  
An ocean of humanity  
Some wash up along the street  
Its hard to keep in stepping round  
Its hard to keep that frame of mind  
Trying to move with the sun  
Gives the illusion that were one  
Ill be running next to you  
We do what we need to  
  
Ohh whoa  
I will comfort you I will comfort you  
Ohh whoa  
I will comfort you I will comfort you  
  
But when the moonlight washes over our bed  
And the road slows  
A lonely siren screeching round the bend  
The cool air blows  
Raising the hair on my skin  
We come face to face  
Try to let each other in  
  
Ohh whoa  
I will comfort you I will comfort you  
Ohh whoa  
I will comfort you I will comfort you  
  
I will I will I will I will  
I will I will I will I will  
I will comfort you
