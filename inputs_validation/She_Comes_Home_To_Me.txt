Though I have been a fool for love  
I have finally made my score  
I got a girl and I dont mean to boast  
But she loves me the most  
  
Even though shes a highly paid whore  
Shell give head to a sheep  
She can stuff three cocks in her cheek  
But she comes home to me  
  
Shell do the groom and the best man  
Shell slap your ass in the back of a van  
But she comes home to me  
She could fuck nine guys in a row  
  
But still have a tenth for me  
And Im the only one who gets to kiss them lips  
Unless you pay an extra fifty  
So mister dont you fall in love  
  
Cause Im the only cat who doesnt wear a glove  
Since her heart belongs to me  
She has a throat that just wont quit  
She can take all of it  
  
And still have room for your balls  
But she shops in the malls for me  
Shell say twelve then call back and say one  
But I dont care I know its just work not fun  
  
When she blows you Jack  
Dont you think shes not thinking of me  
Shell go down on a yack lick a horses nutsack  
But strictly for the cash  
  
And its only me who doesnt pay a fee  
to watch her put a water bottle in her gash  
Put a water bottle in her gash  
Shell let you suck her nips till theyre leakin  
  
But dont you dare try to go antiqueing  
Cause she does that with me  
Her pussys sweet as honey  
But when she moans its just for the money  
  
Unless shes sittin on me  
Shell cram your asshole with a mouse  
But she wont do it in our house  
Tough luck Jack  
  
She knows that dont fly with me  
She might eat your wifes box  
But she wont tell ya where you left your socks  
She rolled up and down your fat prick  
  
But it was me who took her to the Meg Ryan flick  
Shes got a face full of nuts  
And a mouth full of cocks  
Shes done Seal Larry King four New Kids on the Block  
  
She blew the Winnepeg Jets right after a game  
But they never got to know her actual name  
On your face she will piss  
On your chest she might poop  
  
But she wont prepare her famous vegetable soup  
Thats simply reserved  
Oh shell bite ya shell spank ya  
But shell never thank you for free  
  
Cause baby comes home to me  
Comin home
