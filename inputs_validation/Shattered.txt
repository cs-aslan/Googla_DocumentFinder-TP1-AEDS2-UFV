So empty cant feel no more  
As Im left with my tears on the floor  
I wait for my heart to mend  
But you keep tearing a hole  
  
Inside Im so lost  
In the middle of my heart  
Its a battlefield of love  
Ive been fighting for too long  
  
And now Im shattered  
From the chip in my heart kept taking it till it broke  
Oh how it hurts  
But it slipped from your hand hit the ground and now its shattered  
Im so shattered  
Cant believe it was me Im so shattered  
So shattered  
Cant believe you and me ahh  
So shattered  
Cant believe you left me shattered  
Im shattered cut from withinside oh  
  
What am I still here for  
Could it be that Im just waiting  
Hoping youd rescue me  
And put the pieces together again  
  
Inside Im so lost  
In the middle of my heart  
Its a battlefield of love  
Ive been fighting for too long  
  
And now Im shattered  
From the chip in my heart kept taking it till it broke  
Oh how it hurts  
But it slipped from you hand hit the ground and now its shattered  
Im so shattered  
Cant believe it was me Im so shattered  
So shattered  
Cant believe you and me ahh  
So shattered  
Cant believe you left me shattered  
Im shattered cut from withinside oh  
  
Tell me what youre really here for  
If you never really loved me  
I gave my all but it still wasnt enough  
  
Cause all you had to say was that you aint  
Looking for commitment  
Instead of telling me what I wanted to hear hey  
  
You took my emotions  
And scattered them on the ground  
So hard to just pick up  
And move on with life again  
  
And now Im shattered  
From the chip in my heart kept taking it till it broke  
Oh how it hurts  
But it slipped from your hand hit the ground and now its shattered  
Im so shattered  
Cant believe it was me Im so shattered  
So shattered  
Cant believe you and me ahh  
So shattered  
Cant believe you left me shattered  
Im shattered cut from withinside oh  
  
Cant believe you and me ahh
