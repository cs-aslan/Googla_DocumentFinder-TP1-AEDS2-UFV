But now after loving you what else is there to do  
For honey all the rest is just gonna have to be second best  
I know Ill go through life comparing her to you  
Thats cause Im no good Im no good to anyone after loving you  
  
Your precious love cannot be erased by just another woman with a pretty face  
And your memory you know it will remain for it cannot be erased  
Other loves may come along they cant live up to you  
Thats cause Im no good Im no good to anyone after loving you
