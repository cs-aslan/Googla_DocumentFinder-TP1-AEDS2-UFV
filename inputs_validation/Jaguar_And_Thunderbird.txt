Chorus Slow down little Jaguar  
Keep cool little Thunderbird Ford  
Ten miles stretch on an Indiana road  
Twas a sky blue Jaguar and a Thunderbird Ford  
Jaguar setting on ninety nine  
Tryin to beat the Bird to the county line  
Just a halfamile from Newtonville  
There had a speed sign sitting at the top of the hill  
It said  35 miles and stay in line  
But the Jaguar and Thunderbird never read the sign  
Chorus  
Ludenville was a real small town  
Had a hundred and two  
And nine acres of ground  
Some stool pigeon put the sheriff wise  
Told him Park down in Newtonville  
And catch em guys  
Sheriff laid down half hid in the weeds  
Parked for eight days didnt nobody speed  
All of a sudden dust rose on the road  
Said Here come the Jaguar and Thunderbird Ford  
Chorus  
Sheriff doubled clutched second put it in third  
Took right after the Jaguar and Thunderbird  
He knew hed get a bonus and a big fat fine  
If he caught em fore they crossed that county line  
Sheriff never drove his car a hundred and flat  
But if he aimed to get em  
Hed have to do more than that  
Crest of the hill hes about a mile behind  
There wasnt but two mor miles to the county line  
Chorus  
Old Sheiff was countin on the downward grade  
With the tall wind pushin he had it made  
Thunderbird saw the Jaguar gainin speed  
And waved Goodbye Jaguar and pulled in the lead  
Jaguar said You aint won the race yet  
And pulled back around the Bird like a sabre jet  
Sheriffs front bumper was a yard behind  
When the TBird Jaguar crossed the line  
Slow down little Jaguar  
Keep cool little Thunderbird Ford  
repeat and fade
