Each year on mothers day  
The rose I wore was red  
But today Im saying my first prayer  
Mamas lying on her dying bed  
  
Ive just told mama good bye  
Mothers day has turned to night  
Like the flowers in may she withered away  
And my red rose is turning white  
  
This is the dreaded hour  
We all must face someday  
Yet theres consolation in my heart  
She will bloom in the masters bouquet  
  
Her time has come to go  
And theres nothing I can do  
Only hold her hand and say goodbye  
Mamas day with her children is through  
  
Ive just told mama goodbye  
And knelt beside her bed  
I heard her say Ill meet you someday  
Where the white roses turn to red
