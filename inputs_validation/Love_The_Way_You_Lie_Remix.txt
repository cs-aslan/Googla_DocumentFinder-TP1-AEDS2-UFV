Feat Badboyz  
  
Chorus  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you Lie  
  
Boy  
  
Im going crazy just another lie baby  
I dont know what to do with this hate and  
Every time I look in your eyes theyre telling me lies and I dont know what
to do  
Only want the truth but I  
Know that I will never get the love that I had if knew what you were doing
wrong  
Cause this love never felt so strong but at the same time it feels so weak oh  
  
You know that youre hurting me baby cant you see  
That your love is all I need that your love is all I feel  
But I wonder is it still that real  
And every time that I put a smile on my face  
Its because I dont wanna loose you  
Its because I know it will kill you  
I look into the mirror and say  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you Lie  
  
JMe  
  
So I open up my eyes open up this healing that Ive been feeling  
Dont know where its taking me dont know if its you or me oho  
So I just cried a river of emotions deeper then the ocean  
Baby cause I know that I never wanna go  
Never wanna leave your side  
  
I love the way you lie when you do it  
Makes me wanna puke and get sick of the things that youre making up  
And Im so caught up in this love song  
Do you really know what I long for  
Im addicted to you yes it is true  
Baby cause I want you to stay  
I hurt myself every day  
I look into the mirror and say  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you Lie
