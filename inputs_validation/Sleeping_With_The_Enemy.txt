I dont think you know that I hear you  
That youve been talking in your sleep  
Youve been saying crazy things yeah  
As it all unfolds I get a clear view  
Of what youve been doing to me  
Youve been lying through youre teeth  
And it makes me want to scream  
  
Its like I dont know who you are  
Feels like a dagger in my heart  
Suddenly now it seems  
Im sleeping with the enemy  
Cant stop replaying the words you said  
Youre like a stranger in my bed  
Suddenly now it seems  
Im sleeping with the enemy  
  
What is it she does that I dont do  
Is she far more beautiful  
Does she make you feel at home  
Was it not enough that I love you  
But youve been giving her your kiss  
And it almost makes me sick  
That I have to hear like this  
  
Its like I dont know who you are  
Feels like a dagger in my heart  
Suddenly now it seems  
Im sleeping with the enemy  
Cant stop replaying the words you said  
Youre like a stranger in my bed  
Suddenly now it seems  
Im sleeping with the enemy
