On the day that you left me  
You said you had no regrets  
Theres a bond between us  
That hasnt been broken yet  
And the feelings between us  
Will never disappear  
How can you be far away  
When your spirits here  
  
Chorus  
Youre still my man  
Nothing can change it  
We still belong together  
Youre still my man  
Nothing can change it  
Our love will last forever  
  
And the seasons of our love  
Will always change I know  
Maybe thats the reason  
You felt we had to go  
But soon youll be missing me  
Darling I know you well  
Theres a magic we share together  
And no one can break that spell  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill wait for you  
The thought that keeps me going each day  
Is I believe you still love me  
I love you more than words can say  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre still my man  
Nothings gonna change it  
Dont you know you oughta know we belong together  
Youre still my man  
And nothing can change it  
Oh baby oh darling youre in my heart forever  
cause youre my man  
Without you  
Darling our love at all  
  
Youre still my man  
Nothing can change it  
Dont you know you oughta know we belong together  
Oh Youre still my man  
Nothing can change it  
Oh baby oh darling youre in my heart forever  
Youre still my man  
Nothing can change it  
Im yours you know youre mine  
Youre in my heart forever  
  
Youre still my man  
Nothing can change it  
Dont you know you ought to know we belong together  
Youre still my man
