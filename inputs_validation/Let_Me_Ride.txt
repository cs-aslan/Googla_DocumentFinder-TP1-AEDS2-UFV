Ive been on the road now for a day and a night  
Ive been lonesome and hungry for miles  
Ive seen how you people been lookin your lies  
Im gonna kill yall with your own smiles  
But I wish that yall could get a look at the news  
And see what the mans puttin down  
Well I gotta hold a one yesterday night  
And they threw me outta this town oh yeah  
Well its gonna be awhile before I get home  
But when I do thats the end of my roamin  
Cause Ive been gone a lifetime and I cant believe  
That the people I trust still can deceive  
  
By the time I get back here things have to change  
Cause if they dont theres gonna be a lot of strange  
Lookin people marchin round clappin their hands  
And they wont stop till everyone understands  
  
Oh yeah  
Let me ride let me ride  
Let me ride now let me ride now yeah  
  
Livins just like sleepin  
Why is life not like a dream  
Now the dawn is weepin  
Another sunlight sees  
Oh Ive been here too long now  
I got to go outside  
Ya people gotta let me ride  
  
Let me ride ride ride  
I got to feel free inside  
I got to feel free inside  
I got to feel free inside  
I got to feel free inside  
  
Ya people gotta let me ride  
Let me ride ride ride  
I gotta feel free inside  
I got to feel free inside  
I got to feel free inside  
I got to feel free inside
