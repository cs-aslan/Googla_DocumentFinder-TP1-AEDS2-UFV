Hey oh hey hey hey  
See I was born in Newark sure was  
  
We were always hand in hand  
He wore high top shoes and shirt tales  
Nip wore her pigtails  
I knew I loved him even then  
You know some disapproved it  
They even boohooed it  
But I told them time and time and time again  
  
You know I was made to love him  
Build my world around him and  
Hey hey hey  
Hes been my inspiration  
Sho nuff appreciation  
For the love I gave him through the years  
  
Like a sweet magnolia tree  
My love blossomed tenderly  
My love grew sweeter through the years  
  
I know my baby loves me  
My baby needs me  
Thats why we made it through the years  
  
I was made to love him  
Worship and adore him yes say  
Hey hey hey  
Hey oh Lord  
  
All through thick and thin  
Our love just wont end  
But I love my baby love my baby oh  
  
My baby loves me  
My baby needs me  
I know I aint going nowhere  
I was just a little thing  
The love bug hit me  
I had the fever with each passing year  
  
If all should tumble  
And the whole world crumble  
By his side Ill still be standing yeah  
  
Cause I was made to love him  
Made meant for him say  
Hey hey hey  
I was made to love him  
Build my world all around him say  
Hey hey hey  
  
I love my baby  
Nip aint going nowhere  
Say hey hey hey
