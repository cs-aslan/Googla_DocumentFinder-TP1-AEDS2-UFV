I can see clearly now as the crazy  
Haste of night turns to morning  
I lie in a dreamlike state and wonder  
If the fear will go away  
I know that youre here  
In the space that surrounds me  
And you make me feel like a kid  
In a movie I know that you love me  
Like the sound of the sea rush in to shore  
The air that I breathe fills me with your love  
Ive wasted a thousand nights  
For comfort in the arms of a stranger  
I thought it would lead me  
On to bigger brighter things  
But you know that Im wrong  
It doesnt exist and you make  
Me feel like a kid in a movie  
I know that you love me  
Like the sound of the sea rush in to shore  
The air that I breathe fills me with your love  
Like the clouds in the sky the rain falling down  
Washes my feet pulls me to the ground  
Im begging you please never to leave me  
I know you believe you know what Ive said and done  
Like the sound of the sea rushes to shore  
The air that I breathe fills me with your love  
Like the clouds in the sky the rain falling down  
Washes my feet pulls me to the ground  
Im begging you please never to leave me  
I know you believe you know what Ive said and done
