Im scared to sleep Im scared to dream  
Im scared to wake up in case I scream  
Im scared to whisper one word  
Thats all it needs  
  
I hear it breathe I hear it sigh  
I hear it laughing when something dies  
I hear it calling  
But Im too scared to move  
  
Im so scared  
I cant breathe  
Im so scared  
I cant breath  
Im so scared  
I just cant breathe  
  
Im scared to look Im scared to see  
Im scared of mirrors in case its me  
Im scared of memories  
But now thats all I have  
  
So I cant leave and nothing comes  
So noone noticed that Ive come undone  
Id hide in shadows  
But the shadows talk to me  
  
Im so scared  
I cant breathe  
Im so scared  
I cant breath  
Im so scared  
I just cant breathe
