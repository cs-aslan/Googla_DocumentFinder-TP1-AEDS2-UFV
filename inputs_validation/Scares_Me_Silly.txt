Here in the studio  
As theyre turning down the lights  
I lick my lips to start the first line   
How can this girl be me  
Oh little thing are you looking lost  
The vertigo the need to lose   
Ooh ooh  
They try to put me on the tapes begin to spin  
I feel a little sick and hope my notes are in  
I try to put it all in do it for you  
Dont even know you but I need you to love me too  
They try to put me on the tape begin to spin  
I feel a little sick and hope my notes are in  
I try to put it all in do it for you  
Dont even know you but I need you to love me too  
Scares me silly but it gets me going  
Like a Romeo  
Scares me silly but it gets me going  
Like a Romeo  
Scares me silly but it gets me going  
Swimming amid the cans  
I wonder can I goad myself into another take  
And keep the mood  
Its like a film  such balance  
I close my eyes to the cello solo and ache  
The music will never let me blow away youoo  
You know the feeling when youre on the right track  
You fall in love and youre never gonna turn it back  
Its a part of you theyre so sensitive  
Oozing without me filling over with secrets  
You know the feeling when youre on the right track  
You fall in love and youre never gonna turn it back  
Its a part of you theyre so sensitive  
Oozing without me filling over with secrets  
Scares me silly but it gets me going  
Like a Romeo  
Scares me silly but it gets me going  
Like a Romeo  
Scares me silly but it gets me going
