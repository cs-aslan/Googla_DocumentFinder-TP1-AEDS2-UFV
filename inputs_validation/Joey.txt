Joey will come to see your flowers  
Joey will come to while away your hours  
She will tell you youre not so good for her  
She wouldnt be there if it could be that you were  
Joey has loved never shown her tears  
So she may laugh in the autumn of your years  
When youre with her youll wonder if its true  
All that they said of a world without you  
Where she may come from where she may go  
Who she may run from no one will know  
Why she was late may trouble you some  
Still you wait for Joey to come  
Joey will come when once more it looks like snow  
Joey will come when its really time to go  
And you may smile when you find that youve been wrong  
You thought you found her but she knew you all along  
But Joey will come to say hello Joey
