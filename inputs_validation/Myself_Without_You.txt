When you walked out that door  
I was so sure my world had ended  
So sure Id never get over you  
  
On that first night alone  
I cried so many tears it scared me  
So many dreams that I had to let go  
But now I know  
  
That the world still turns and the sun still burns  
And thats what Ive learned without you  
And the days roll on and my heart gets stronger too  
Dont think I didnt love you  
Just because I made it through  
But I learned to love myself  
Without you  
  
I take myself to dinner  
And I go to the movies solo  
Thats something I never did before  
  
You may not understand this  
But I dont wait on invitations  
Im not afraid of the great unknown  
Of being alone cause the  
  
The world still turns and the sun still burns  
And thats what Ive learned without you  
And the days roll on and my heart gets stronger too  
Dont think I didnt love you  
Just because I made it through  
But I learned to love myself  
Without you  
  
I can even see myself  
Falling in love with somebody else  
Ready to take that chance again  
Cause I know now  
What I didnt know then  
  
That the world still turns and the sun still burns  
And thats what Ive learned without you  
And the days roll on and my heart gets stronger too  
Dont think I didnt love you  
Just because I made it through  
But I learned to love myself  
Without you
