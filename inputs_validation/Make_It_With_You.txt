Ah ha have you ever tried  
Really reaching out for the other side  
I may be climbing up rainbows  
But baby here goes  
Oh dreams theyre for those who sleep  
Life is for us to keep  
And if youre wonderin what this all is leadin to  
I want to make it with you  
I really think that we could make it ooh  
  
No you dont know me well  
And every little thing only time will tell  
But you believe the things that I do  
And well see it through  
Oh life can be short or long  
Love can be right or wrong  
And if I choose the one Id like to help me through  
Id like to make it with you  
I really think that we could make it yeah yeah ooh  
  
Ah ha and if I choose the one Id like to help me through  
Oh hoo Id like to make it with you ah ha  
Oh baby ah I want to make it with you  
Oh lets make it I want to make it with you  
Oh baby yeah I want to make it with you  
Oh hoo lets make it I want to make it with you  
Ah make it lets make it  
I want to make it with you
