Pretty women wonder  
Where my secret lies  
Im not cute or built to suit  
A fashion models size  
But when I start to tell them  
They think Im telling lies  
  
I say  
Its in the reach of my arms  
The span of my hips  
The stride of my steps  
The curl of my lips  
  
Im a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
Yes indeed  
Cause Im a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
Baby thats me  
  
I walk into a room  
Just as cool as you please  
And to a man  
The fellows stand or  
Fall down on their knees  
Then they swarm around me  
Like a hive of honey bees  
  
I say  
Its the fire in my eyes  
And the flash of my teeth  
The swing of my waist  
The joy in my feet  
  
Im a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
Yes indeed  
Cause Im a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
Baby thats me  
  
Its in the arch of my back  
The sun of my smile  
The ride of my breasts  
The grace of my style  
  
Now you understand  
Just why my heads not bowed  
I dont shout  
Or jump about  
Or have to talk real loud  
When you see me passing  
It ought to make you proud  
  
I say  
Its in the click of my heels  
The bend of my hair  
The palm of my hand  
The need for my care  
  
Im a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
Yes indeed  
Cause Im a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
Baby thats me  
Baby thats me yeah
