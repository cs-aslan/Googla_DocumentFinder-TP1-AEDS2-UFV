I gotta get myself far far away  
I gotta tell myself that anyway  
I cant forget the way that we used to be  
And all in all it seems so different to me  
  
I said whoa oh Rosalie I said whoa my Rosalie  
Oh every time I see her I have to stop  
And everybody says you are the cream of the crop  
But if youre looking angry in any way  
I dont believe Id stand in your way  
I want a lonely carriage with roses on  
A funny love affair a funny way to go home  
I wont change for you you havent changed for me  
I dont suppose youd have an answer for me  
  
Ive been around this place for quite a time  
Ive been around just feeling really fine  
I cant believe I feel like nothing today  
And I dont feel too much anyway
