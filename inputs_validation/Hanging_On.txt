You know we can get away  
Because Im calling your name  
Every day I feel this pain  
But you just turn and walk away  
  
I just cant keep hanging on  
to you and me  
I just dont know what is wrong  
with you and me  
  
Touch me and then turn away  
And put your hands into the flame  
Tell me if you feel this pain  
Cause I dont want to be a ball and chain no  
  
I just cant keep hanging on to you and me  
I just dont know what is wrong  
  
Give me the respect forgive me and forget  
Weve got to get a grip living on the edge  
I barely even know this fucking woman in my bed  
And if thats too much on my plate then I aint finishing my bad  
And if anybody said the grass is greener on the other side  
Well it aint swear on my mothers life  
You got me wrapped up in your shit  
Im feeling mamba fight  
Ive only ever had this fucking feeling in my stomach twice  
You gave me what I needed and I gave her everything she wanted  
Miss something bout your cleavage  
Now why cant put my fingers on it  
Youre taking me the deepest  
I thought that she was coming for me  
If four women from Venus then I guess I really got a rocket  
Youve got a nose around my neck but Im still hanging on  
Weve nearly reached the finish line I bet were having fun  
I spit a buzz she sang a song  
She broke my heart I took some garbage scan  
  
I just cant keep hanging on with you with me  
With you with
