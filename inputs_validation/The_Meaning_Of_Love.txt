Ive read more than a hundred books  
Seeing love mentioned many thousand times  
But despite all the places Ive looked  
Its still no clearer  
Im still no nearer  
The meaning of love  
  
Noted down all my observations  
Spent an evening watching television  
Still I couldnt say with precision  
Know its a feeling and it comes from above  
But whats the meaning  
The meaning of love  
tell me  
  
From the notes that Ive made so far  
Love seems something like wanting a scar  
Well I could be wrong  
Im just not sure you see  
Ive never been in love before  
  
Next I asked several friends of mine  
If they could spare a few minutes of their time  
Their looks suggested that Ive lost my mind  
Tell me the answer  
My Lord high above  
Tell me the meaning  
The meaning of love  
  
From the notes that Ive made so far  
Love seems something like wanting a scar  
Well I could be wrong  
Im just not sure you see  
Ive never been in love before  
  
The meaning of love  
tell me  
Tell me the meaning of love  
tell me
