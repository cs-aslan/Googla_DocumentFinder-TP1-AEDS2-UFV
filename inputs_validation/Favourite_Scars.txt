Best jump why do we feel were going nowhere less were falling  
Were not ready to give up until were crawling  
Dont make it easy on ourselves  
Climbing risk it all if you aint living youre surviving  
Tell me why you dip youre toes when you could dive in  
Dont be scared to hurt yourself  
Take your heart back off the shelf  
  
Love covers you up in a landslide  
Love pulls you under like a riptide  
Loves when you crash trying to handglide  
Loves when youre running and theres no light  
Love is a song when youve got no defense  
Love is a rock we throw ourselves against  
Love is the healing of a broken heart  
The story behind all of my favorite scars  
All of my favorite scars  
I love my favorite scars  
  
High wire dont look down because below you is a raging fire  
But love is waiting for you on the other side  
Were not easy on ourselves  
So take your heart back off the shelf  
  
Love covers you up in a landslide  
Love pulls you under like a riptide  
Loves when you crash trying to handglide  
Loves when youre running and theres no light  
Love is a song when youve got no defense  
Love is a rock we throw ourselves against  
Love is the healing of a broken heart  
The story behind all of my favorite scars  
All of my favorite scars  
I love my favorite scars
