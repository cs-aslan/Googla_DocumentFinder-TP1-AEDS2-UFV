Christmas morning so much fun  
Down the stairs the children run  
Someone has eaten the cookies  
And look whats left under the tree  
Theres presents for you and for me  
As far as the eye can see  
Whats on the rooftop  
I wonder what there was  
Theres reindeer flyin around the world  
Because Santas comin  
I think we all should pause  
To say that were grateful  
For everything he does  
Thank you Santa Claus  
Thank you Santa Claus  
Woah  
So for all the things you do  
Santa Claus were thanking you  
So for all the things you do  
Santa Claus were thanking you  
Thank you Santa Claus  
All over the world
