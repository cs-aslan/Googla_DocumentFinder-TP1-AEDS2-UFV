Your face so pale  
Hasnt see the light for days  
But on the hill  
You had no place to say The skies are all mine  
And Im proud to be here  
But when my lover cries I feel his tears  
I was gonna drive you home  
I was going to tell you who I wanted  
We came back to the same place  
We didnt speak just danced in our minds  
  
Oh lover I know this aint what it should be  
But let me take you home  
Ill show you what you should see  
I was gonna drive you home  
I was gonna tell you who I wanted  
I was gonna drive you home  
  
Ill never change for anyone  
I know its there but I just cant see it  
I know its there but I cant see it  
A little light with you and me in it  
I know its there but I cant see it  
  
I was thinking about the times I could have had  
And whether they turn out good if they turn out bad  
I was going to take you home  
Show you things your lover wouldnt know  
  
My angel my lover my angel  
My mind lover my mind lover  
Shes my mind lover
