What time is it baby Is it that time again  
When snow will be falling friends will be calling  
You know its time when therell be carolers singing Silent Night  
I love when they sing the feeling it brings  
Its warm as a fire is bright  
  
Soon therell be toys for the good girls and boys  
And reindeer are heading our way  
Yes and Santa will come down the chimney above  
Theres one thing I wanted to say  
  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas  
And if I could have one wish come true  
I wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas I do  
  
I saw a child sit with old Mr Claus  
Looked him in the eye and he asked old Santa what peace on earth was  
Now the old man grew cautious on how he would say  
That is the greatest gift one you can give everyday  
  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas  
And if I could have one wish come true  
I wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas I do  
  
Now the mistletoe and the house aglow  
All the world seems at ease tonight  
And all that I ask when these precious moments pass  
Is why cant every day be so bright  
  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas  
And if I could have one wish come true  
I wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas I do  
Honest I do yes I do now  
Very merry Christmas
