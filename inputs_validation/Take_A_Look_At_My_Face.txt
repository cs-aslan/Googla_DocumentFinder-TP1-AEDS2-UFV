I said a lot of things  
A lot of things I didnt mean to say  
Never meant to hurt you  
I was wrong to fight with you that way  
But Im only human  
I let my pride deceive me  
Youre the lover I need in my life  
If you still dont believe me  
  
Baby take a look at my face  
Tell me you dont see what you started  
No ones gonna take your place  
Right here by my side  
Baby take a look at my face  
Youre never gonna be brokenhearted  
If you still dont know what you mean to me  
Take a look at my face  
  
From the day I found you  
You brought light into my heart  
So dont keep your love away from me  
Dont leave me in the dark  
Though I never tell you  
What my hearts concealing  
Youre the lover I need in my life  
Cant you feel what Im feeling  
  
Baby take a look at my face  
Tell me you dont see what you started  
No ones gonna take your place  
  
Baby take a look at my face  
Youre never gonna be brokenhearted  
If you still dont know what you mean to me  
Take a look at my face  
  
You could think it over  
You could make it easy  
Im the lover you need in your life  
If you still dont believe me  
  
Baby take a look at my face  
Tell me you dont see what you started  
No ones gonna take your place  
Right here by my side  
Baby take a look at my face  
Youre never gonna be brokenhearted  
If you still dont know what you mean to me  
Take a look at my face
