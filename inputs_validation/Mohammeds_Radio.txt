Everybodys restless and theyve got no place to go  
Someones always trying to tell them  
Something they already know  
So their anger and resentment flow  
But dont it make you want to rock and roll  
All night long  
Mohammeds Radio  
I heard somebody singing sweet and soulful  
On the radio Mohammeds Radio  
You know the Sheriffs got his problems too  
He will surely take them out on you  
In walked the village idiot and his face was all aglow  
Hes been up all night listening to Mohammeds Radio  
Dont it make you want to rock and roll  
All night long  
Mohammeds Radio  
I heard somebody singing sweet and soulful  
On the radio Mohammeds Radio  
Everybodys desperate trying to make ends meet  
Work all day still cant pay the price of gasoline and meat  
Alas their lives are incomplete  
Dont it make you want to rock and roll  
All night long Mohammeds Radio  
I heard somebody singing sweet and soulful  
On the radio Mohammeds Radio  
Youve been up all night listening for his drum  
Hoping that the righteous might just might just might just come  
I heard the General whisper to his aidedecamp  
Be watchful for Mohammeds lamp  
Dont it make you want to rock and roll  
All night long Mohammeds Radio
