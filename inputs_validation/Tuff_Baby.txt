Psst psst hey girl  
Just come here come on come here  
  
I love your hair  
Your pearly smile  
Your icing scan  
Societys vile  
Insect cars  
Horny men from Mars  
I love you tuff baby  
I love you tuff baby  
  
Youve know the score  
For a while now  
Your dad dont care  
Your moms aware  
Your hands are new  
I wonder what theyll do  
I love you tuff baby  
I love you tuff baby  
  
Theres chaos in the old suburbs  
And downtown too they got the blues  
But youll survive  
With a hard glint in your eyes  
I love you tuff baby  
I love you tuff baby  
I love you  
I love you tuff baby Repeat x3
