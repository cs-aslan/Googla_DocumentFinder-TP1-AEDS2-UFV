One more song about movin along the highway  
Feel the fantasy in the air  
  
Ah    
  
Filled the room with flowers from Norway  
Sensed her majesty in the air  
Made a sign bove your doorway to show I care  
  
Ive been waiting every morning  
Just to help you find your way  
Ive been standing on your corner  
Dont go away Dont go away  
  
One more song about movin along the highway  
Feel the fantasy in the air  
  
Ive been waiting every morning  
Just to help you find your way  
Ive been waiting every morning  
Help me make it through the day  
  
Ive been waiting every morning  
Just to help you find your way  
Ive been waiting every morning  
Help me make it through the day  
  
Ive been waiting every morning
