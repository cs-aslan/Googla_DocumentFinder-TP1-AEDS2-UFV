She said  
I wanna be the rain I am a red balloon I got a book of dates  
Shes gonna go away and leave me here tonight  
Some worlds last longer then others  
Shes got a red balloon shes gonna be the sky  
Im gonna paint my face tonight  
Hey 99 days out of San Francisco  
Headed for Berlin  
Hey 99 days left of California  
Headed with the wind  
If I sail across the water Ill be floating blind here beside the wild  
Monkey came alive shes leaving me behind  
Its so hard to find  
She said  
I wanna be a plane I am a red balloon Ill never be the same  
And Im gone gone gone on the wind  
She said  
Youll never get away you need a red balloon you need a better day  
This time your headed home this time  
Some trips last longer then others she just said Goodbye  
She just float away Im gonna die right here this time  
Some girls last longer then others  
Too few red balloons too little time tonight  
Hey 99 days out San Francisco  
Headed for Berlin  
Hey 99 days left of California  
Setting with the wind home
