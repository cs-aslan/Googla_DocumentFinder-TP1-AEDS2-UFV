I know youve been hurt before  
I can see it in your eyes  
And if you just shut the door  
I would not be surprised  
Even though I know youve heard it  
These words Im tryin to say  
I think the others only flirted  
With the true meaning of always  
Well you can say what you wanna  
But I aint gonna stop  
This journey 2 the center of your heart  
I see the candle through your window  
It burns there every night  
The shadow leaves an innuendo  
Of no one holdin you right  
Many nights Ive dreamt you near me  
But awakened to you gone  
I know one day youll hear me  
I dont care how long  
Well you can say what you wanna  
But I aint gonna stop  
This journey 2 the center of your heart  
Ive waited a lifetime baby  
Just to know your name  
Weve done everything in our minds  
Lets stop the game lets stop it  
Even though I know  
Youve heard these words Im tryin to say  
Somehow I think these others  
They only flirted with the true meaning of always
