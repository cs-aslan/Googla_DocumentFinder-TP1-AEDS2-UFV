I saw your face in a criminal sketch  
Dont be alarmed cause you dont know me yet  
Im on the prowl now sniffing around this town for you  
  
Calling all cars theres an officer down  
Shot to the heart on a night on the town  
And the evidence of your fingerprints was found and now  
  
You got the right to remain right here with me  
Im on your tail in a hot pursuit  
Love is a highspeed chase racing down the street  
  
Woo woo woo  
Im coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
Im coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
Im coming after you  
  
Oh no here we go once again  
We both know youll never turn yourself in  
So Im drivin til its light out  
Searchin for your hideout  
drivin til its light out  
Searchin for your hideout  
  
Pick up the pace as I chase you around  
One of these days Ill end up trackin you down  
But yeah I got the feeling Ill be letting you loose when I do  
Because you  
You got the right to remain right here with me  
Im on your tail in a hot pursuit  
Love is a highspeed chase racing down the street  
Woo woo woo  
Im coming after you  
  
You got the right to remain right here with me  
Im on your tail in a hot pursuit  
Love is a high speed chase racing down the street

Woo woo woo

Love is a high speed chase racing down the street  
  
You got the right to remain right here with me  
Im on your tail in a hot pursuit  
Love is a highspeed chase racing down the street
