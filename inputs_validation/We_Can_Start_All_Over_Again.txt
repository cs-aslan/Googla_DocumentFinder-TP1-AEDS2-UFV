Now you say its the end  
Oh but I think we can start over again  
Just to think of the time  
We were mellowed by spices of love  
Lets not pretend  
This can be the end of this love affair  
We have all of the time in the world to live it again  
Baby we can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again and again  
As our hearts join one more time  
Misunderstanding we could live behind  
Dont you think it aint true  
Im gonna keep on loving you  
Lets not pretend  
This can be the end of this love affair  
We have all of the time in the world to live it again  
Baby we can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again and again  
Baby we can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again and again  
With you out of my life I cant sleep at night  
I climb the highest mountains swim the deepest sea  
To get to that love that belongS to me  
As our hearts join one more time  
Misunderstanding we could live behind  
Dont you think it aint true  
Im gonna keep on loving you  
Baby we can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again and again and again and again baby  
Now you say its the end  
Oh but I think we can start over again  
Just to think of the time  
We were mellowed by spices of love  
Lets not pretend  
This can be the end of this love affair  
We have all the time in the world to live it again  
Baby we can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again and again
