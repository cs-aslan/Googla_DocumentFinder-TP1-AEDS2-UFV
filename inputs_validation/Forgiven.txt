Couldnt save you from the start  
Love you so it hurts my soul  
Can you forgive me for trying again  
Your silence makes me hold my breath  
Time has passed you by  
  
Oh for so long Ive tried to shield you from the world  
Oh you couldnt face the freedom on your own  
Here I am left in silence  
  
You gave up the fight  
You left me behind  
All thats dones forgiven  
Youll always be mine  
I know deep inside  
All thats dones forgiven  
  
I watched the clouds drifting away  
Still the sun cant warm my face  
I know it was destined to go wrong  
You were looking for the great escape  
To chase your demons away  
  
Oh for so long Ive tried to shield you from the world  
Oh you couldnt face the freedom on your own  
And here I am left in silence  
  
You gave up the fight  
You left me behind  
All thats dones forgiven  
Youll always be mine  
I know deep inside  
All thats dones forgiven  
  
Ive been so lost since youve gone  
Why not me before you  
Why did fate deceive me  
Everything turned out so wrong  
Why did you leave me in silence  
  
You gave up the fight  
You left me behind  
All thats dones forgiven  
Youll always be mine  
I know deep inside  
All thats dones forgiven
