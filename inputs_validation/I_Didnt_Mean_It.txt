When you say those words those three little words  
Youre in at the deep end  
Give up the night times give up the high times  
Give up the weekend  
Give up the chance to be your own man  
Let the feeling take over  
The only way out is to lie if you can  
But you dont have the knack  
And youll go crawling back saying  
I didnt mean it I didnt mean it  
I didnt mean to say what I said when I said I didnt mean it  
I didnt mean it I didnt mean it  
I didnt mean to say what I said it was only a game  
I didnt mean it I didnt mean it  
I didnt mean to tell you in so many words I didnt mean it  
I felt tied down my pride down  
That I put that lie down  
The prize now for you is me  
Well I was like you and all I could do was  
Give up and surrender  
The people can trace what they did in my face  
But theyre just pretenders  
They told me mercenary action today  
Is a line as simple and pure  
But what if you found you made a mistake  
The medicines worse than the cure  
And youll be back for sure saying  
I didnt mean it I didnt mean it  
I didnt mean to say what I said when I said I didnt mean it  
I didnt mean it I didnt mean it  
I didnt mean to say what I said it was only a game  
I didnt mean it I didnt mean it  
I didnt mean to tell you in so many words I didnt mean it  
I felt tied down my pride down  
That I put that lie down  
The prize now for you is me  
Give up the chance to be your own man  
Let the feeling take over  
The only way out is to lie if you can  
But you dont have the knack  
And youll go crawling back saying  
I didnt mean it I didnt mean it  
I didnt mean to say what I said when I said I didnt mean it  
I didnt mean it I didnt mean it  
I didnt mean to say what I said it was only a game  
I didnt mean it I didnt mean it  
I didnt mean to tell you in so many words I didnt mean it  
I felt tied down my pride down  
That I put that lie down  
The prize now for you is me
