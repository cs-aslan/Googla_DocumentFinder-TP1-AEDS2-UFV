Sometimes I feel like this world  
Is just one big gigantic merrygoround  
You gotta hold on tight or you get hurled through the air  
Yeah life is a threering circus  
With clowns and freaks and camels and such  
And you never know when you might be attacked by the bears  
  
Chorus  
Give me love give me love love me good  
Sometimes I feel like  
Im afraid of my own shadow and then  
Sometimes I can feel as bold as Genghis Khan  
But I could never live in a yurt  
On a diet of Mongolian barbecue  
I conquer the world for a moment then the moment is gone  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
  
Let us take a moment now to bow our heads and pray  
If only to give thanks for making it through another day  
  
Sometimes I wish I was in a movie  
Or some 70s TV thing  
Where everything gets neatly wrapped by the end of the show  
Yeah but this aint Hollywood  
And this sure aint the Brady Bunch  
And how this plots gonna all pan out I dont really know  
  
Chorus
