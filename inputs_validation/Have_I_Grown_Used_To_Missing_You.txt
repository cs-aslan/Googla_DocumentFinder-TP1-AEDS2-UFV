I havent cried a tear all day and the hurtins gone away  
Have I finally grown used to mssing you  
In the lonely hours tonight will I long to hold you tight  
For have I finally grown used to missing you  
  
For I must not let go of the greatest love Ill know  
Is there still a change that youll come back to me  
It would be more than I could take and I know my heart would break  
If Ive really grown used to missing you  
  
Oh I must not let go  
Have I finally grown used to missing you
