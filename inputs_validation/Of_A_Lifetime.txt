The mist is slowly lifting  
The sound of life misplaced your mind  
Youre sitting spellbound through out time  
I hope that you remember what you find  
Singin more of a lifetime  
  
You put it downall that Im thinking  
but take a long and distant search when all is right  
you take for granted  
You cant look down but youre no worse  
Singin more of a lifetime  
  
The countless visions that are drifting  
The silver dreams you hate to lose  
Theres no harm Weve all been waiting  
well keep your faith Do what you choose  
Singin more of a lifetime
