Leaving is the longest word I ever learned  
In the time it takes to say it the whole world has turned  
If a heartbeat lasts a lifetime then Ive lived before  
cause I remember standing at this open door  
  
Chorus  
This path is not the one Id choose to travel  
Even as we watch what tied us unravel  
And the tears fall like rain  
Deeper than crying the loving still remains  
  
Neither wants to be the one to say goodbye  
And neither wants to be the one whos left to cry  
But in our secret heart of hearts we both know  
That the time for patching up has passed and its time to go  
  
Chorus  
  
So Ill be the one to pull our tangled lives apart  
I wont dodge the angry words that hide a broken heart  
And my calm faretheewells cannot obscure  
That deep inside my heart is also hurtin so  
  
Chorus
