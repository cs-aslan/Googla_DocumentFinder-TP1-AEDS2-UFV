It was me and my monkey  
Him with his dungarees and roller blades  
Smoking filter tips reclining in the passenger seat of my supercharged jet
black Chevrolet  
He had the soft top down  
He liked the wind in his face  
He said Son you ever been to Vegas  
I said No he said Thats where were gonna go you need a change of place  
And when we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and the neon signs he
said  
I left my wallet in El Segundo and proceeded to take two grand of mine  
We made tracks to the Mandalay Bay hotel  
Asked the bell boy if hed take me and my monkey as well  
He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a smile he said  
If your monkeys got that kind of money sir and weve got a monkey bed  
  
Me and monkey  
With a dream and a gun  
Hoping my monkey  
Dont point that gun at anyone  
Me and monkey  
Like Butch and the Sundance Kid  
Trying to understand  
Why he did what he did  
Why he did what he did  
  
And at the elevator I hit the 33rd floor  
He had a room up top with a panoramic view its like nothing youve ever seen
before  
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke  
He ran his little monkey fingers through the yellow pages  
Called up escort services and ordered some oki doke  
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door  
In walked this big badass baboon into my bedroom with 3 monkey whores  
Hi my name is Sunshine  
These are my girls  
Lace my palm with silver baby oh yeah and theyll rock your world  
So I watched pay per view and polished my shoes and my gun  
Was sticking on Kurt Cobain sing about lithium  
There came and knocked at the door and in walked Sunshine  
Whats up  
You better get your ass in here boy your monkey is having too much of a good
time  
  
Me and my monkey  
Drove in search of the sun  
Me and my monkey  
Dont point that gun at anyone  
Me and my monkey  
Like Billy the Kid  
Trying to understand  
Why he did what he did  
Why he did what he did  
  
Got tickets to see Sheena Easton  
The monkey was high  
Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died  
We left before encores  
He couldnt sit still  
Sheena was a blast baby  
But my monkey was ill  
When I played black jack  
Kept hittin 23  
Couldnt help but notice this Mexican just staring at me  
Or was it my monkey  
I couldnt be sure  
Its not like youve never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before  
Now dont test my patience cause were not about to run  
Thats a badass monkey boy and hes packing a gun  
My name is Rodriguez he says with death in his eye  
Ive been chasing you for a long time amigos  
And now your monkey is gonna die  
  
Me and my monkey  
Drove in search of the sun  
Me and my monkey  
We dont want to kill no Mexican  
But we got ten itchy fingers  
One thing to declare  
When the monkey is high  
You do not stare  
You do not stare  
You do not stare  
  
Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican stand off here boy  
And I aint about to run  
Put your gun down boy  
How did I get mixed up with this fucking monkey anyhow
