Im so downhearted cause what had started  
Out to be love has now dearly departed  
Theres no reason for you to be leaving  
I wish you would stay but youre a  
  
Busy body  
Giving all your lovin to just anybody  
A Busy body  
Holding kissing loving hugging anybody  
  
If it would have lasted it would have been fantastic  
But when the morning came you were gone  
All your one night standin must take a lot of plannin  
But I dont think youll last for very long  
Cause youve got a  
  
All I ever  
Wanted to do was love you baby  
Gotta believe me  
Im hopelessly into you  
  
I can hear love calling  
And I cant believe Im falling  
For somebody  
Wholl never be all mine  
Ive got to stop the fire  
I cant let it get no higher  
But Im so afraid Im running out of time  
Cause youve got a  
  
Busy body  
Giving all your lovin to just anybody  
A Busy body  
Holding kissing loving hugging anybody
