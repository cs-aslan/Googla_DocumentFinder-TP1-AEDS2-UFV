We could watch you from afar  
And forever be amazed  
At how glorious you are  
Yet youve drawn us close to you  
Where the wonders greater still  
And you overwhelm us God  
And we rejoice with trembling in our hearts  
Bring you a song of reverence and love  
Jesus how good how great you are  
And we rejoice with trembling  
Before your throne  
Who could fully voice the praise  
Of the God of endless days  
Tell a fraction of your worth  
For we only sing in part  
Of the grace of who you are  
Just an echo just a glimpse  
And we rejoice with trembling in our hearts  
Bring you a song of reverence and love  
Jesus how good how great you are  
And we rejoice with trembling  
Before your throne
