Whenever Im with him  
Something inside starts to burning  
And Im filled with desire  
  
Could it be the devil in me  
Or is this the way loves supposed to be  
  
Its like a heat wave  
Burning in my heart  
Cant keep from crying  
Its tearing me apart  
  
Whenever he calls my name  
Soft low sweet and plain I feel yeah yeah  
Well I feel that burning flame  
  
Has high blood pressure got a hold on me  
Or is this the way loves supposed to be  
  
Its like a heat wave  
Burning in my heart  
Cant keep from crying  
Its tearing me apart  
  
Sometimes I stare into space  
Tears all over my face  
I cant explain it dont understand it  
I hadnt ever felt like this before  
  
Now that funny feeling has me amazed  
I dont know what to do my heads in a haze  
  
Its like a heat wave  
Burning in my heart  
Cant keep from crying  
Its tearing me apart  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah oh oh  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah oh  
  
Dont pass up this chance  
This time its true romance  
  
Heat wave  
Heat wave  
Heat wave  
Ooh heat wave
