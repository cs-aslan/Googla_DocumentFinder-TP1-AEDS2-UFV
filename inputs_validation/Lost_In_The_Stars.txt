Before Lord God made the sea and the land  
He held all the stars in the palm of His hand  
And they ran through His fingers like grains of sand  
And one little star fell alone  
  
Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air  
For the little dark star on the wind down there  
And He stated and promised Hed take special care  
So it wouldnt get lost again  
  
Now a man dont mind if the stars grow dim  
And the clouds blow over and darken him  
So long as the Lord Gods watching over them  
Keeping track how it all goes on  
  
But Ive been walking through the night and the day  
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray  
And sometimes it seems maybe Gods gone away  
Forgetting the promise that we heard Him say  
  
And were lost out here in the stars  
Little stars big stars blowing through the night  
And were lost out here in the stars  
Little stars big stars blowing through the night  
  
And were lost out here in the stars
