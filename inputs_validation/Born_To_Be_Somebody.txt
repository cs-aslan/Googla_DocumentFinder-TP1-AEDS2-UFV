Theres a dream in my soul  
A fire thats deep inside me  
Theres a me no one knows  
Waiting to be set free  
I gonna see that day  
I can feel it  
I can taste it  
Change is coming my way  
  
I was born to be somebody  
Aint nothing thats ever gonna stop me  
I light up the sky like lighting  
I gonna rise above  
Show em what Im made of  
I was born to be somebody  
I was born to be  
And this world will belong to me  
  
This life can kick you around whoa  
This world can make you feel small whoa  
They will not keep me down whoa  
I was born to stand tall  
I can feel it  
I believe it  
Im here  
Im here to stay  
  
I was born to be somebody  
Aint nothin thats ever gonna stop me  
I light up the sky like lightening  
I gonna rise above  
Show em what Im made of  
I was born to be somebody  
I was born to be  
And this world will belong to me  
  
Feel it  
Believe it  
Dream it  
Be it  
I was born to be somebody  
Aint nothing thats ever gonna stop me  
Ill light up the sky like lighting  
Im gonna rise above  
Show em what Im made of  
I was born to be somebody  
I was born to be  
And this world will belong to me  
Whoa oh

And this world will belong to me  
Yeah yeah
