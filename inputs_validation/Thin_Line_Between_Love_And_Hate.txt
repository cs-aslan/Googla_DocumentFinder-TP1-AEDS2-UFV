Its a thin line between love and hate  
Its a thin line between love and hate  
  
Its five oclock in the morning  
And youre just getting in  
You knock on the front door  
And a voice sweet and low says  
who is it  
She opens up the door and lets you in  
Never once asks where have you been  
She says are you hungry  
Did you eat yet  
Let me hang up your coat  
Pass me your hat  
All the time shes smiling  
Never once raises her voice  
Its five oclock in the morning  
You dont give it a second thought  
  
Its a thin line between love and hate  
repeat  
  
The sweetest woman in the world  
Could be the meanest woman in the world  
If you make her that way  
You keep hurting her  
Shell keep being quiet  
She might be holding something inside  
Thatll really really hurt you one day  
  
I see youre in the hospital  
Bandaged from foot to head  
In a state of shock  
Just that much from being dead  
You couldnt believe the girl  
Would do something like this ha  
You didnt think the girl had the nerve  
But here you are  
I guess action speaks louder than words  
  
Its a thin line between love and hate  
repeat
