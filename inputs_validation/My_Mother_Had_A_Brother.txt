My mother had a brother  
They say that I was born on the day that he died  
Someone to cling to she said  
When all the noises and the shame came calling  
  
My mother had a brother  
I thought I knew them all I thought I knew  
But she lied  
I said Show me his face again tell me again why he died  
  
She said he couldnt wait for the things that Ive seen  
She said he wasnt strong enough he never dared to dream a life like mine  
  
My mother had a brother  
Oversensitive and kind  
Seems it all became too much for him  
It seems he took his own life  
Mum I cant imagine the joy and pain in equal measure  
Tears in the dirt and all over your newborn treasure  
  
I guess he had to wait until my momma had me  
I guess he couldnt wait another moment to be free  
In endless sky  
  
But mama will you tell him from your boy  
The times they changed  
I guess the world was getting warmer  
And we got stronger  
Mother will you tell him about my joy  
I live each day for him  
The sun came out yeah and Im just breathing it in  
  
My mother had a brother  
Same desire different time  
Seems the empty spaces tortured him  
Until he took his own life  
  
I dont know why I waited so long for love  
I just dont know what I was thinking of  
All that wasted time  
  
But mama will you tell him from your boy  
The times they changed  
I guess the world was getting warmer  
While we got stronger  
Mother will you tell him about my joy  
I live each day with him  
Your son came out yeah  
And Im still breathing it in  
  
And I swear now that freedom is here  
Im gonna taste it all for you boy  
Im bad to the bone Im just a little torn  
Im making so much love  
  
So those of us who have nothing to fear  
Weve got to make damn sure that it was worth it  
Im bad to the bone Im just a little stoned  
Im making so much love  
  
I was a prisoner but he saved me  
Broke into my dreams and said Who cares  
I was a prisoner so disgrace me  
Im glad to be home  
And I dont believe they care
