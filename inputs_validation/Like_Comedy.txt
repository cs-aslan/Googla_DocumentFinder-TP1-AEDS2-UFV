You were built to last a lifetime  
Just not the life that you live  
You dont have to make it worse  
Cause the world isnt perfect  
And you dont need to give a toss  
But youd make it better if you did  
You did you did you did  
  
You were made to be loving  
Not a source of bitterness and hate  
And when you turn them on yourself  
You make one more useless martyr  
Make the best of here and now  
Heaven or hell can wait  
Theyll wait theyll wait let them wait  
  
When you lose your appetite for selfdestruction  
You can stop viewing life as tragedy  
Give it a few more years and look from this angle  
Where it looks more and more and more like comedy  
Where it looks more and more and more like comedy  
  
Oh you were made to be happy  
Not mired in sorrow and regret  
Misery comes around enough  
You dont need to invite him  
And when he leaves you should grab  
All the joy you can get  
You can get you can get you can get  
  
When you lose your appetite for selfdestruction  
You can stop viewing life as tragedy  
Give it a few more years and look from this angle  
Where it looks more and more and more like comedy  
Where it looks more and more and more like comedy  
Like comedy  
Like comedy  
Like comedy
