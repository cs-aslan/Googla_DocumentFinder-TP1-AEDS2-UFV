Whens the day you start again  
And when the hell does youll get over it begin  
Im looking hard in the mirror  
But I dont fit my skin  
Its too much to take  
Its too hard to break me  
From the cell Im in  
  
Oh from this moment on  
Im changing the way I feel yeah  
From this moment on  
Its time to get real  
  
Cause I still dont know how to act  
Dont know what to say  
Still wear the scars like it was yesterday  
But youre long gone and moved on  
Cause youre long gone  
But I still dont know where to start still finding my way  
Still talk about you like it was yesterday  
But youre long gone and moved on  
But youre long gone you moved on  
  
So howd you pick the pieces up yeah  
Im barely used to saying me instead of us  
The elephant in the room keeps scaring off the guests  
It gets under my skin to see you with him  
And its not me that youre with  
  
Oh from this moment on  
Im changing the way I feel yeah  
From this moment on  
Its time to get real  
  
Cause I still dont know how to act  
Dont know what to say  
Still wear the scars like it was yesterday  
But youre long gone and moved on  
Cause youre long gone  
But I still dont know where to start still finding my way  
Still talk about you like it was yesterday  
But youre long gone and moved on  
But youre long gone you moved on  
  
No I cant keep thinking that youre coming back  
No  
Cause I got no business knowing where youre at  
No  
And its gonna be hard yeah  
Cause I have to wanna heal yeah  
And its gonna be hard yeah  
The way I feel that I have to get real  
  
I still dont know how to act  
Dont know what to say  
Still wear the scars like it was yesterday  
But youre long gone and moved on  
But youre long gone  
But I still dont know where to start still finding my way  
Still talk about you like it was yesterday  
But youre long gone and moved on  
But youre long gone you moved on  
  
But youre long gone you moved on  
But youre long gone you moved on
