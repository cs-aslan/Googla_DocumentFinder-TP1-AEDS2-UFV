They say people out in Hollywood  
Live their life out in black and white  
Theyre livin out a Technicolor dream  
Next day theyre a star overnight  
  
Not like in New York  
Man its tougher  
Not like in London town  
Boy you suffer  
  
Nobody give a break  
When youre down on your luck  
Everybodys on the take  
When youre down on your luck  
You cant make a mistake  
When youre down on your luck  
  
People out in Hollywood  
They got a lot of class  
You see the boys struttin down the boulevard  
Tryin to make a pass  
  
Not like in New York  
Its high rise its concrete and complex  
Not like in ol London town  
It reigns down on its subjects  
  
Nobody give a damn  
When youre down on your luck  
Nobody understands  
When youre down on your luck  
Lady Chance she wont dance  
When youre down on your luck  
  
People out in Hollywood  
They can make it to the stars  
They can reach the screen  
Drive around in big expensive convertible cars  
  
Not like in New York  
All youve got is Broadway  
Not like in the West end of London  
You cant make it no way  
  
Nobody give a damn  
When youre down on your luck  
Nobody understands  
When youre down on your luck  
Lady Chance she wont dance  
When youre down on your luck  
  
Youve got to strut your stuff  
When youre down on your luck  
You cant take it easy it aint good enough  
When youre down on your luck  
Everybodys on the make  
When youre down on your luck  
  
Nobody give a fair deal  
When youre down on your luck  
Nobody understands my Uncle Sam  
When youre down on your luck  
Im ready for the dance  
When youre down on your luck  
  
I gotta make a dollar holler  
When youre down on your luck  
When youre down on your luck
