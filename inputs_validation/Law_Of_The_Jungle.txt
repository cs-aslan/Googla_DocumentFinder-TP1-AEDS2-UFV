Law of the jungle only the fit survive  
Better make your life your own do the survival jive  
There are no answers words are Culdesac  
And the pity with actions Difficult turning back  
  
Dont give a thought about those lucky dice  
Paranoid thoughts of worldly vice  
The big thumb it never rests on you  
Anything you want lies here for you  
Takes a bit of time means a bit of work  
Heart will give the sign itll make me look  
  
Aint got a clue why Im here at all  
So while Im here Im gonna have it all  
Science men wont explain a thing  
In this prison my soul must sing  
  
Dont give a thought about those lucky dice  
Paranoid thoughts of worldly vice  
The big thumb it never rests on you  
Anything you want lies here for you  
Takes a bit of time means a bit of work  
Heart will give the sign itll make me look
