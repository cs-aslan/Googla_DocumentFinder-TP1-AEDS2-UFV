I was caught between the years  
Cost me nearly all my tears  
With my back turned looking down the path  
  
Hit me like a ton of bricks  
Had to have my outlook fixed  
With my back turned looking down the path  
  
People always ask me why  
Whats the matter with me  
Nothing matters when Im with my baaby  
With my back turned looking down the path  
  
Well go walkin hand in hand  
Laughin fit to beat the band  
With our backs turned looking down the path  
  
People always ask me why  
Whats the matter with me  
Nothing matters when Im with my baaby  
With my back turned looking down the path  
  
Some may have and some may not  
God Im thankful for what I got  
With my back turned looking down the path  
With my back turned looking down the path  
With my back turned looking down the path
