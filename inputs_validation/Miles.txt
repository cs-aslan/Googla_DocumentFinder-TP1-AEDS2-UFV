Im scared today  
More than I told you I was yesterday  
Give me a moment to catch my breath  
And hold me every second left  
  
Proud of me  
Thats the only way I want you to be  
Look at me and love  
What you see  
  
I wont make it alone  
I need something to hold  
  
Kiss me on my shoulder  
Tell me its not over  
I promised to always come home to you  
Remind me that Im older  
To be brave smart sweet and bolder  
And dont give up on what were trying to do  
  
Dont count the miles  
Count the I love yous  
  
We made it out  
And all the other people are asking how  
This doesnt even sound like truth  
To grow from a bruise  
  
But one day we will realize  
How hard it was how hard we tried  
And how our hearts made it out alive  
  
Kiss me on my shoulder  
Tell me its not over  
I promised to always come home to you  
Remind me that Im older  
To be brave smart sweet and bolder  
And dont give up on what were trying to do  
  
Dont count the miles  
Count the I love yous  
  
And these are words  
I wish you said  
But thats not how it went  
Cause you gave up on us in the end  
  
And I wont make it alone  
I need something to hold  
  
Kiss me on my shoulder  
Tell me its not over  
I promised to always come home to you  
Remind me that Im older  
To be brave smart sweet and bolder  
And dont give up on what were trying to do  
  
Kiss me on my shoulder  
Tell me its not over  
I promised Id come home to you  
Remind me that Im older  
To be brave smart sweet and bolder  
And dont give up on what were trying to do  
  
Dont count the miles  
Count the I love yous
