If I could be there Id be there tonight comforting you  
This road Im on is so far away  
Too far away  
  
If God would grant me wings to fly  
Id be in your arms by and by  
If I could be there Id be there tonight comforting you  
  
If I could be there Id look in your eyes and say I love you  
These hills and highways between us now keep us apart  
  
If God would grant me wings to fly  
Id be in your arms by and by  
If I could be there Id look in your eyes and say I love you  
  
If I could be there I wouldnt have this pain in my heart  
Tomorrow Ill wake up with joy for the day  
Joy for the day  
  
If God would grant me wings to fly  
Id be in your arms by and by  
If I could be there I wouldnt have this pain in my heart  
  
If I could be there
