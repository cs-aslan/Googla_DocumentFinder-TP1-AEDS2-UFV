I dont want your lovin baby I wont give you mine  
I need more than ifs and maybes to help me pass the time  
Give me private lessons teach me all you can  
Play me silent movies but remember babe oh remember babe  
We dont got no contract  
I wont buy your lyin baby you wont buy my love  
Dont you think no cryin baby I wont take no bluff  
Give me private lessons teach me all you can  
Play me silent movies but remember babe oh remember babe  
We dont got no contract oh no  
Give me private lessons teach me all you can  
Play me silent movies but remember babe oh remember babe  
We dont got no contract oh no
