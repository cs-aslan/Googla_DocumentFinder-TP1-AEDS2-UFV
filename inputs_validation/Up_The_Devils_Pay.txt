Im gonna tend a bad fire until you come around  
Id sing you real live love songs  
If I could get the feeling down  
  
I want to make you happy but the devils out my way  
So Ill just pack up everything  
Roll it out and up the devils pay  
  
I want to cause a bad scene  
But I gotta change my ways  
I want to hear your sound again  
I want to see you round someday  
  
I want to make you happy  
But the devils out my way  
So Ill just pack up everything  
Roll it out and up the devils pay  
  
and it seems no one can comfort me  
To take me from this station where Im at  
Cause the things I love are leaving me  
And its taken every single piece  
Its a gradeA mess and its cutting teeth  
Its a big black wind thats blowing back of me  
  
Im gonna roll up everything into a big red sun  
Boil til the rooms insane  
Wave my rattles on and on  
  
I want to make you happy but the devils out my way  
So Ill just pack up everything  
Roll it out and up the devils pay
