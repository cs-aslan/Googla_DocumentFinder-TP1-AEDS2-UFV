By the light of the moon  
I sing to you  
By the light of the moon  
I raise my voice  
I raise my voice  
By the light of the stars  
In a big black void  
And straight into your heart  
  
By the light of the moon  
I sing to you  
By the light of the moon  
I raise my voice  
I raise my voice  
By the light of the stars  
In a big black void  
And straight into your heart  
  
I dont have too many words  
I am not sophisticated  
Listen to the crying birds  
They call you in my name  
Let me be your desert wind  
Rattle you when youre sedated  
For a soul so far elated  
Cannot experience shame  
  
By the light of the moon  
I sing to you  
By the light of the moon  
I raise my voice  
I raise my voice  
By the light of the stars  
In a big black void  
And straight into your heart  
  
I dont have too many words  
I am not sophisticated  
Listen to the crying birds  
They call you in my name  
Let me be your desert wind  
Rattle you when youre sedated  
For a soul so far elated  
Cannot experience shame  
  
By the light of the sun  
Im happy and gay  
All pristine and squeakyclean  
The good and proper way  
  
By the light of the sun  
Im an innocent lamb  
But the light of the moon  
Reveals the wild horse that I am  
Reveals the wild horse that I am  
  
I dont have too many words  
I am not sophisticated  
Listen to the crying birds  
They call you in my name  
Let me be your desert wind  
Rattle you when youre sedated  
For a soul so far elated  
Cannot experience shame  
Its all annihilated by her flame  
Its all annihilated by her flame  
Its all annihilated by her flame  
  
By the light of the moon  
I sing to you  
By the light of the moon  
I raise my voice  
I raise my voice  
By the light of the stars  
In a big black void  
And its going straight into you heart  
  
By the light of the moon  
I sing to you  
By the light of the stars  
Straight into you heart
