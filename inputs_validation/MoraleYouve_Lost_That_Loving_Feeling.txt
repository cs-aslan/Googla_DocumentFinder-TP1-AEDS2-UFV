Dont talk  
Close the door  
Youve been here before  
  
Your shape dim  
Im an old man now  
The airs thin  
The walls very damp now  
And if I dont go  
Ill always be stuck here in this poor little room  
With a view of the corner  
  
I dont forget  
The light growing weak now  
Experience is useless  
Unless you can learn  
And Ive never met anyone  
Who used their knowledge  
To avoid those mistakes made again and again  
  
And if I dont go  
Ill always be stuck here in this poor little room  
With a view of the corner  
  
You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips  
And theres no tenderness like before in your fingertips  
Youre trying hard not to show it baby  
But baby baby I know it  
  
Youve lost that loving feeling  
Woah that loving feeling  
Youve lost that loving feeling  
Now its gone gone gone  
Woahwoah  
  
Now theres no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you  
And girl youre starting to criticize little things I do  
It makes me just feel like crying baby  
Cause baby something beautifuls dying  
  
Youve lost that loving feeling  
Woah that loving feeling  
Youve lost that loving feeling  
Now its gone gone gone  
Woahwoah  
  
Baby baby Id get down on my knees for you  
If you would only love me like you used to do yeah  
We had a love a love a love you dont find every day  
So dont dont dont dont let it slip away  
  
Bring back that loving feeling  
Woah that loving feeling  
Bring back that loving feeling  
Now its gone gone gone  
And I cant go on  
  
Baby baby baby baby  
I want you please woooo  
Please woooo  
I need your love I need your love  
I need your love I need your love  
Now it bring it on back bring it on back  
Bring it on back now bring it on back now  
Now bring it on back
