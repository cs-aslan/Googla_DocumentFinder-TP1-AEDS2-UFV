Youre not easy to love  
Youre not easy to love no  
Youre not easy to love  
Youre not easy to love no  
  
Why is everything with you so complicated  
Why do you make it hard to love you  
Oh I hate it  
Cause if you really wanna be alone  
I will throw my hands up cause baby I tried  
Everything with you is so complicated  
Oh why  
  
Sometimes I get you  
Sometimes I dont understand  
Sometimes I love you  
Sometimes its you I cant stand  
Sometimes I wanna hug you  
Sometimes I wanna push you away  
Most times I wanna kiss you  
Other times punch you in the face  
  
Cause every minute you start switching up  
And you say things like you dont give a fuck  
Then I say Im through with you  
Take my heart from you  
And you come running after me and baby Im back with you  
  
Oh youre not easy to love  
Youre not easy to love no  
Youre not easy to love  
Youre not easy to love no  
  
Why is everything with you so complicated  
Why do you make it hard to love you  
Oh I hate it  
Cause if you really wanna be alone I  
Will throw my hands up cause baby I tried  
Everything with you is so complicated  
Oh why  
  
Sometimes I catch you  
Sometimes you get away  
Sometimes I read you  
Other times Im like where are you on the page  
Sometimes I feel like we will be together forever  
But youre so complicated  
My heart knows better  
  
Why is everything with you so complicated  
Why do you make it hard to love you  
Oh I hate it  
Cause if you really wanna be alone I  
Will throw my hands up cause baby I tried  
Everything with you is so complicated  
Oh why  
  
Ima stick around just a little while longer  
Just to make sure that youre really sure  
You like sleeping alone  
Ima stick around just a little while longer  
Just to make sure that youre really sure  
You like sleeping alone  
  
Why is everything with you so complicated  
Why do you make it hard to love you  
Oh I hate it  
Cause if you really wanna be alone I  
Will throw my hands up cause baby I tried  
Everything with you is so complicated  
Oh why  
  
Youre not easy to love  
Youre not easy to love no  
Youre not easy to love  
Youre not easy to love no
