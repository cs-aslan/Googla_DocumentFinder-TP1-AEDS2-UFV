I see you down in the front line  
Such a sight for sore eyes youre a suicide makeover  
Plastic eyes lookin through a numb skull  
Selfeffaced whats his face  
You erased yourself so shut up  
You dont let up  
  
You have a growth that must be treated  
Like a severed severe pain in the neck  
You can smell it but you cant see it  
No explanation identified cause you dont know  
You dont say  
  
And you got no reply  
Hey you where did you come from  
Got a head full of lead youre a inbred bastard son  
All dressed up red blooded  
A mannequin Do or die no reply dont deny that youre synthetic  
Youre pathetic
