Im just as proud as I can be  
And everytime youre out with me  
Im hopin everyone will see  
Cause Im so proud of you  
When we go walkin down the street  
I show you off to all we meet  
You roll your eyes and look so sweet  
Im just so proud of you  
When we go home together after school each night  
I dont want no other youre a doll all right  
Im just so proud when Im with you  
The way you wear that cute hairdo  
And when you blush I love that too  
Im just so proud of you
