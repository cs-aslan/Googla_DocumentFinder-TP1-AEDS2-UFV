Feeling restless  
Crave for company  
never gave me  
Any room to breathe  
  
Intuition  
Soon made me wise  
As you ran out of  
Alibis  
Took time to draw the line  
That I cant deny  
Nothing is plain or black and white  
You fight like a tired soldier  
Shielded by wounded pride  
Always pretending to be strong  
Desperately waiting for  
  
Another time another place  
I dont care no more  
I am the one you cant replace  
A fact you cant ignore  
  
Can you face it  
Im forever gone  
Dug your own grave  
Shot with your own gun
