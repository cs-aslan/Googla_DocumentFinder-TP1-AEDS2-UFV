I would walk on all my friends to get to you  
If I lose them all for your love Ill do that too  
Guess they mean well when they tell me what to do  
But they dont know how far Ill go to get to you  
  
Burning bridges behind me to get to you  
Breaking all ties that bind me to get to you  
I hold your love far above what Id go through  
Id give all I own for a stepping stone to get to you  
  
If its the last I do Ill get to you  
Because I know how much you want me to  
Youre the only thing that can me my world in view  
Every breath I take every move I make is to get to you  
  
Burning bridges behind me to get to you  
Breaking all ties that bind me to get to you  
I hold your love far above what Id go through  
Id give all I own for a stepping stone to get to you
