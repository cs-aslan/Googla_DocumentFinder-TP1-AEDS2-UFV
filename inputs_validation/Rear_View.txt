Verse 1  
Can your heart be mine in search  
Cause I have no time to help you find all the words  
Melodies and memories stories that sound absurd  
I will tell no lies  
  
PreChorus  
As long as you look me in the eyes  
Ill go wherever you are Ill follow behind  
  
Chorus  
Heard about all the things youve done  
And all the wars that youve been in  
Heard about all the love you lost  
It was over before it began  
Heard about all the miles youve gone  
Just to start again  
Heard about all that youve been through  
And it sounds like you need a friend a friend  
  
Verse 2  
Please dont wait Im not coming home tonight  
I wanna love you but I cant  
  
PreChorus  
As long as you look me in the eyes  
Ill go wherever you are Ill follow behind  
  
Chorus  
Heard about all the things youve done  
And all the wars that youve been in  
Heard about all the love you lost  
It was over before it began  
Heard about all the miles youve gone  
Just to start again  
Heard about all that youve been through  
And it sounds like you need a friend a friend  
  
Bridge  
I never doubted myself  
But I doubted you  
Im tired of looking at myself  
In my rear view  
  
Chorus  
Heard about all the things youve done  
And all the wars that youve been in  
Heard about all the love you lost  
It was over before it began  
Heard about all the miles youve gone  
Just to start again  
Heard about all the that youve been through  
And it sounds like you need a friend a friend
