I Can Fly  
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer  
You saw me waiting I was crazy on fire waiting to fly  
I Can Fly  
  
I had bright wishes in the summer I was bathing in sunlight  
I was painting in the garden like a ghost in MidJuly  
Running fast from something with my eyes wide like  
Saucers spinning in the sun  
  
I had a dream that I was fine  
I wasnt crazy I was divine  
  
  
I Can Fly  
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer  
You saw me waiting I was crazy on fire waiting to fly  
I Can Fly  
  
Your lies were hard kisses in the summer  
I was dreaming of a lake  
Dreaming of the water where Id rise like a Phoenix  
Or that  from the fire  
Ive got things to tell you like I know that youre a liar  
  
I had a dream that I was fine  
I wasnt crazy I was divine  
  
I Can Fly  
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer  
You saw me waiting I was crazy on fire waiting to fly  
I Can Fly  
  
Your words cut like a knife and butter  
I was fighting for my art  
Fighting with my lover you had me so tied up  
Thinking theres no other  
Yeah right  
Yeah right  
  
I Can Fly  
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer  
You saw me waiting I was crazy on fire waiting to fly  
I Can Fly
