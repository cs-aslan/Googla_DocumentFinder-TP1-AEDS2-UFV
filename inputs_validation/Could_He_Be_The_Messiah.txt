Been here for days Im amazed at this teacher carpenter preacher  
Lost in the crowd I hear him now Hes praying and Hes saying God feed
them all  
Fivethousand men all of His friends are worried find bread and hurry  
Five loaves and fish what can He wish Hes praying still Hes saying God
feed them all  
  
Chorus  
Could He be the Messiah  
Miracle man part of the plan  
Could He be the Messiah  
Life in His hand  
I understand He could be  
  
Meet for our needs fully He feeds our hunger older and younger  
Twelve baskets more can we ignore He shows us that He knows us is He the
Christ  
God in His eyes I realize His power need of the hour  
Jesus is His name they say He came to feed us and to receive us is He the
Christ  
  
Chorus  
  
It is He the Messiah  
Miracle man part of the plan  
It is He the Messiah  
Life in His hand  
I understand it is He  
  
Chorus
