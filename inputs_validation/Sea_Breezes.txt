Ive been thinking now for a long time  
How to go my own separate way  
Its a shame to think about yesterday  
Its a shame  
Now that we are lonely  
Life seems to get hard  
Alone what a word  lonely  
Alone it makes me cry  
Thoughttrain set in motion  
Wheels in and around  
Express our emotion  
Tracks up then it cracks down  
Weve been running round in our present state  
Hoping help would come from above  
But even angels there make the same mistakes  
In love
