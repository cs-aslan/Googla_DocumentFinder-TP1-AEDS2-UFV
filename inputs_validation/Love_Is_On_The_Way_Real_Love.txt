I could write a book on love  
The way you make me feel  
I never knew someone  
Could have a love so real  
  
Call it a special heart  
Call it a love so true  
But in a little while Im getting close to you  
  
See Im about to lose my mind  
Love is on the way  
Im so excited its a crime  
Love is on the way  
Its gonna be real love  
Real love oh love  
  
Calling up all my friends  
To tell them how right theyve been  
They said you would take me back into your arms again  
Gonna do right this time I like the way it feels  
I dont wanna ask too much  
Just wanna feel you touch  
  
See Im about to lose my mind  
Love is on the way  
Im so excited its a crime  
Love is on the way  
Its gonna be real love  
Real love oh love  
  
Im all excited  
Love is on the way  
Im so delighted  
Love is on the way  
Cause love is comin  
Love is on the way  
And Ive been waiting for the day for love to come  
Love is on the way  
My heart is flyin  
Love is on the way  
Theres no denynig  
Love is coming  
Oh love  
  
See Im about to lose my mind  
Love is on the way  
Im so excited its a crime  
Love is on the way  
Its gonna be real love  
Real love oh love  
  
I get a second chance today  
Love is on the way  
Its really true love and I can say  
Love is on the way  
Its gonna be real love real love  
  
Well Im about to lose control  
Love is on the way  
Cause love is coming dont you know
