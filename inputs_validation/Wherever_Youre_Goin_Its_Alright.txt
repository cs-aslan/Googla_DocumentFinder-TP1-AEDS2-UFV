Say goodbye look to the sky  
Set your course on into the night  
Say goodbye hold your head high  
Wherever youre goin its alright  
Things must change  
You know they always do get rearranged  
No reflection on you  
Just face the danger and follow it through  
And the change is gonna be for the best  
Well I know how crazy it feels when you go  
Go out shufflin your heels  
So take it slow and make only good deals  
Youre a young man and its time to go west ooh yes  
You say goodbye you look to the sky  
Set your course on into the night  
You say goodbye you hold your head high  
Wherever youre goin its alright  
Take a chance go on make your move  
Nothin fancy you got nothin to prove  
Just make a stance you know were countin on you  
You are the one with the vision  
So move out move ahead of the fear  
Have no doubt in your mind  
Theres a very clear out and someone must steer  
It is you who must make the decision ooh yeah  
Say goodbye look to the sky  
Set your course on into the night  
Say goodbye hold your head high  
Wherever youre goin its alright  
Say goodbye look to the sky  
Set your course on into the night  
Say goodbye hold your head high  
Wherever youre goin its alright  
Say goodbye look to the sky  
Set your course on into the night  
Say goodbye hold your head high  
Wherever youre goin its alright  
Say goodbye look to the sky  
Set your course on into the night  
Say goodbye hold your head high  
Wherever youre goin its alright
