In my dream I saw you touch my heart  
All at once I was still  
A peace within me that could not compare to  
All Id known and all Id seen  
Your touch gave me life  
And now I sing  
  
Glory to God forever  
Ill praise you now and ever  
Your love floods my thirsty soul  
All majesty and power  
Are yours Almighty Father  
Great is your Holy name  
  
Ive been thinking of you  
In my thoughts I heard you call my name  
I felt a stirring within  
A new beginning and a new found passion  
It made me call out your name  
With a desire to see all men saved  
  
Holy  
Holy  
Holy  
Is the Lord God Almighty  
  
You reign  
You reign over the earth
