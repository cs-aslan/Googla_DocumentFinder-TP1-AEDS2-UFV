Nice car whered ya get your ride  
A trophy badge of honor over compensation  
Price tags advertise yer pride  
Since when did what we paid for colored cloth  
Gage our gravity  
  
You should be careful what you wish for  
Cause everyone of us has the devil inside  
You should be careful what you wish for  
Cause all of what amounts becomes you  
  
Nice watch man dya got the time  
Theres never enough and it always goes too slow  
  
You should be careful what you wish for  
Cause everyone of us has the devil inside  
You should be careful what you wish for  
Cause all of what amounts becomes you  
  
Yeah you gotcha little world  
Picture perfect its a pearl  
Now go and try to sleep  
In the bed you made
