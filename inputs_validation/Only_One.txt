Intro  
As I lay me down to sleep  
I hear her speak to me  
  
Verse 1  
Hello Mari how ya doin  
I think the storm ran out of rain the clouds are moving  
I know youre happy cause I can see it  
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it  
I talked to God about you he said he sent you an angel  
And look at all that he gave you  
You asked for one and you got two  
You know I never left you  
Cause every road that leads to heavens right inside you  
So I can say

Youll keep on rising till the sky knows your name

Verse 2  
Hey hey hey hey  
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day

And if you knew how proud I was  
Youd never shed a tear have a fear no you wouldnt do that  
And though I didnt pick the day to turn the page  
I know its not the end every time I see her face and I hear you say

Well have wings and well fly
