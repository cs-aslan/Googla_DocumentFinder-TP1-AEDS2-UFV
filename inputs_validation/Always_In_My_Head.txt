I think of you  
I havent slept  
I think I do  
But I dont forget  
My body moves  
Goes where I will  
But though I try my heart stays still  
It never moves  
Just wont be left  
So my mouth waters to be a fate  
And youre always in my head  
Youre always in my head  
Youre always in my head  
Youre always in my head  
  
Youre always in my head  
Youre always in my head  
Always in my  
Youre always in my  
  
This I guess is to tell you youre choosing out of the rest
