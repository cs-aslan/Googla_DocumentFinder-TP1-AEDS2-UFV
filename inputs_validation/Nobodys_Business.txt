I went out in the darkness  
Just searching for someplace to be  
Wasnt looking for trouble  
I guess it was looking for me  
And I knew I was wasting my time  
But it was nobodys business  
Nobodys business but mine  
I was taking some comfort  
I needed a break from the rain  
I guess I was mistaken  
And someone remembered my name  
But I knew I was doin just fine  
And it was nobodys business  
Nobodys business but mine  
Well I guess for some  
Revenge is sweet  
Though it be once removed  
I hope you feel better  
I dont know what you proved  
Well yonder comes the Emperor boys  
He sure looks fine in blue  
I hope you feel better babe  
I know youre scared too  
Well it sure makes you wonder  
The things that some people will say  
They can see black and white but they  
Dont seem to notice the gray  
What a price for a victimless crime  
When it was nobodys business  
Nobodys business but mine  
Yeah it was nobodys business  
Nobodys business but mine
