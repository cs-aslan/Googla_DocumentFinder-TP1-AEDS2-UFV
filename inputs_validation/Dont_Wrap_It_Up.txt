Ill take some of this Ill have some of that  
And several more of these  
Now that I see it I know what I like  
So Ill like it if you please  
I aint nobodys princess stuck in Sunday School  
So Ill help myself to love  
And have the whole career  
Dont wrap it up Ill eat it here  
  
Just look at you now the ultimate guy  
Class and wit and style  
Once I might have pretended to be someone else  
Attracting you with guile  
But now Im not about to dress up in some other womans shoes  
Ive got nothing to lose  
So Ill help myself to love  
Gather round and cheer  
Dont wrap it up Ill eat it here  
  
Ive stood there patiently waiting in line  
A takeout mans an OK plan  
If youve got lots of time  
Especially if hes biodegradable  
  
I aint nobodys princess  
I aint nobodys fool  
So Ill help myself to love  
Theres nothing more to fear  
Dont wrap it up Ill eat it here
