Three birds for a show nigga gon book it

Big dollars in my pocket got me sittin crooked  
  
A hundred racks in my pocket I cant even walk  
Fifty hitters with me nigga I set it off  
Poppin bottles blowing money Im just having fun  
Me and my niggas fresh to death upper echelon  
I got buckles on my shoes and they gold bitch  
Open my doors in reverse this that Rolls bitch

All I rock is white them on my old shit  
All my niggas solid all my hoes thick

Smelling like a bag Im looking like a brick  
  
Big wheels on my Phantom got it sittin crooked  
Three birds for a show nigga gon book it

Big dollars in my pocket got me sittin crooked

So when you see that Phantom dog dont follow that  
Ridin in a rental gettin that pack off  
Fish scale yay I call it bath salts  
Trap doing good I cant complain

Then went and bought that new Jeep that SRT  
Yo ho suck dick on sight ASAP  
Just got a yellow AP and that bitch nasty  
When I popped out my second week I coulda bought a Aston  
  
Big wheels on my Phantom got it sittin crooked  
Three birds for a show nigga gon book it  
Im LeBron James you a fuckin rookie  
Your broad want a ticket Imma go and book it  
Book it book it  
Book it book it

Big dollars in my pocket got me sittin crooked
