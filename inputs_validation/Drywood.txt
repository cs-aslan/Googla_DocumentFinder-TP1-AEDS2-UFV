Youve got to learn to brighten up your ways  
Kick out your dull padded life  
Theres much to know and no doors in space  
They were only mirrors you imagined in your mind  
Now that youve got no place to go  
And you stand alone  
Know that theres just one place to be  
And its in your soul oh  
Like drywood takes to fire the truth will come to you  
Like streams that seek the ocean they will find ways through  
Like morning meets the moon my love will guide the way  
Its time to wipe your eyes not and awake  
Ive come to take you over theres much for you to do  
Ive come to take you over then its up to you  
  
Be like the light in the shadows  
Throw down your mask and be real  
Dont wish to win and dont mind to lose  
That was just a cycle like a squirrel in a wheel  
Now that youve got no place to look  
And you stand alone  
Know thats theres just one place to be  
And it is your home oh  
Like fish that seek the water the truth will come to you  
Like leaves upon the soil they will find ways through  
Like flowers seek the sun my love will guide the way  
Its time to wipe your eyes now and awake  
  
You say youre really with me but you only follow me around  
How much you love me yes  
But I dont want the kind of love  
I have to sit down and count  
  
You think youre free and lucky but youre stuck behind a prison wall  
How well you know yourself  
But I see something else within you  
That you dont see at all  
You may give up your number disowning all your wealth  
You may sell all the pieces but youll  
Never never never give up  
Yourself oh no no no  
  
Like drywood takes to fire the truth will come to you  
Like streams that seek the ocean they will find ways through  
Like morning meets the nights stars my love will guide the way  
Its time to wipe your eyes not and awake  
Ive come to take you over theres much for you to do  
Ive come to take you over then its up to you
