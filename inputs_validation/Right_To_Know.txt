On a cool dark night someones coming down the street  
With a smoking gun and a smile on his face  
For all to see the rest is history  
But no one knows whats on his mind  
Except him and his monkey come on  
  
When the big man fell with a secret on his lips  
So close so close  
Til the bullet gave his kiss  
The world cried out loud the rest is history  
And no one knows whats on his mind  
Except him and his monkey come on  
  
Youve got a right to know  
Youve got a right to know  
Youve got a right to know  
Youve got a right to believe that theres something more to see  
  
Theres a man at the desk who is talking real soft  
To a half dozen guys but not a word is lost  
The men depart they all know what to do  
With a rifle aiming through a clearing in a bush  
So close so close but no one thinks to look  
  
Youve got a right to know  
Youve got a right to know  
Youve got a right to know  
Youve got a right to believe that theres something more to see  
Than a big bunch of flowers in a cemetery  
So why hold out come on and give your testimony  
  
On a phone connection on the other side of town  
Sits a man with a pencil who doesnt make a sound  
He nods his head the rest is history  
But no one knows whats on his mind  
Except him and his monkey come on come on  
  
When the big man fell with a secret on his lips  
So close so close  
Til the bullet gave his kiss  
  
Youve got a right to know  
Youve got a right to know  
Youve got a right to know  
Youve got a right to believe that theres something more to see  
Than a big bunch of flowers in a cemetery  
So why hold out come on and give your testimony  
  
On a cool dark night someones coming down the street
