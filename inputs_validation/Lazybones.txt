Lazybones sleepin in the sunhow you spect to get your days work done  
You cant get your days work donesleepin in the noon day sun  
Lazybones layin in the shadehow you gonna get your cornmeal made  
  
You cant get no cornmeal madesleepin in that evening shade  
When taters need sprayin I bet you keep prayin  
The bugsll fall off of the vine  
  
And when you go fishin I bet you keep wishin  
Them fish dont grab your line  
Lazybones loafin all the dayhow you spect to make a dime that way  
You wont make no dime that wayloafin in the shade all day
