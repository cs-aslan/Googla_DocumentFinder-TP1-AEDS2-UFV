There aint no use in me trying to tell you how I feel  
cause what I feel aint what youre feeling  
I dont know what we did wrong  
I just know if you come home  
I aint gonna let you break my heart again  
  
There aint no use in me trying to find out where youve been  
Where youve been aint where Im going  
cause if I ask you where youve been  
The hurting starts and it dont end  
So I aint gonna let you break my heart again no  
I aint gonna let you break my heart again no no  
  
Tears dont become me  
Pain aint my friend  
It seems like you enjoy my crying baby  
You always said that I was strong  
But I believe that you were wrong  
Lately God knows I have been trying  
  
There aint no use in you trying to kiss away the hurt baby  
cause it hurts where its deep down inside of me and its hiding  
If you decide youre coming home  
You walk in it wont be like before  
cause I aint gonna let you break my heart again no  
Aint gonna let you break my heart again no no
