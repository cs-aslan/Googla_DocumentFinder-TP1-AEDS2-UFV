Ive been looking in the mirror for so long  
That Ive come to believe my souls on the other side  
All the little pieces falling shatter  
Shards of me  
Too sharp to put back together  
Too small to matter  
But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces  
If I try to touch her  
And I bleed  
I bleed  
And I breathe  
I breathe no more  
  
Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirits well  
Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child  
Lie to me  
Convince me that Ive been sick forever  
And all of this  
Will make sense when I get better  
but I know the difference  
Between myself and my reflection  
I just cant help but to wonder  
Which of us do you love  
So I bleed  
I bleed  
And I breathe  
I breathe no  
Bleed  
I bleed  
And I breathe  
I breathe  
I breathe  
I breathe no more
