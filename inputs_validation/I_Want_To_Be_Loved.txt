I had a roof overhead  
Had shoes on my feet  
Yeah sure I was fed  
But no one was there when I was in need yeah  
  
So who am I now  
Who do you want me to be  
I can forgive you but I wont relive you  
I aint the same scared kid I used to be  
  
Im gonna live  
Im gonna survive  
I dont want the world to pass me by  
Im gonna dream  
I aint gonna die  
Thinking my life was just a lie  
I want to be loved  
I want to be loved  
  
I found a picture  
Our socalled family tree yeah  
I broke all the branches lookin for answers  
Dont you know that aint how its supposed to be  
  
Im gonna live  
Im gonna survive  
I dont want the world to pass me by  
Im gonna dream  
I aint gonna die  
Thinking my life was just a lie  
I want to give  
Im ready to try  
Willing to lay it on the line  
I want to be loved  
I want to be  
  
I aint gonna cry I dont want to scream  
But I got so much left unsaid inside of me  
  
Im gonna live  
Im gonna survive  
Dont want the world to pass me by  
Im gonna dream  
I aint gonna die  
Thinking my life was just a lie  
I want to give  
Im ready to try  
Willing to lay it on the line  
I want to beloved  
I want to be loved  
I just want to be love  
I want to be loved Repeat x3
