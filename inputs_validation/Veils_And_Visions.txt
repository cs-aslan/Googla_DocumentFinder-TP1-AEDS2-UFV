I crash so hard  
Fall so low  
Just when things look right  
Thats when you know that Im alone  
I take the chance  
To lose it all  
Take a look around me  
And youll see where I have stalled  
This is the last time that Im sayin  
And heres the end  
Of the night  
Of the line  
Wont somebody save me  
Heres the time  
Time for more  
Time for everything and anything  
Its alright  
Its alright  
And we go on and on and on and on again  
The rooms on fire  
You lock the door  
Your new way of thinking will not get  
Me off the floor  
Take this time  
To take a fall  
Ive given you my best  
And now you wont see that at all  
This is the last time that Im sayin  
And heres the end  
Of the night  
Of the line  
Wont somebody save me  
Heres the time  
Time for more  
Time for everything and anything  
Its alright  
Its alright  
And we go on and on and on and on again  
Back beat  
Everybody is changing  
Im so stuck and you are amazing  
This is my low  
You are the reason  
Live to be numb  
My fall is the season  
Inhale the bullshit  
Makes my skin itch but it gets me lit  
Dont ya wish that the pieces fit  
Like when we were kids  
You cant bide lost time  
Cant bide lost time  
You cant bide lost time  
Cant bide yours and mine  
You cant bide lost time  
Cant bide lost time  
You cant bide lost time  
Cant bide yours and mine  
Mine  
Heres the end  
Of the night  
Of the line  
Wont somebody save me  
Heres the time  
Time for more  
Time for everything and anything  
Its alright  
Its alright  
And we go on and on and on and on  
On and on and on and on again
