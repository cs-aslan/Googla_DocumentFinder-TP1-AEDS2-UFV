How do you do Lucy  
You sure been hard to find  
I heard you had a daughter six years old  
And I just can keep from crying  
  
Six years and Lucy  
Lord have mercy  
Thats a long time  
Thats a long time  
  
Is she pretty Has she grown  
Does she sleep well in a room of her own  
Can I see her Does she know  
That Im her daddy Im her daddy  
  
Did you give her love love one of my pictures  
Does she carry yeah yeah picture with her  
Does she show it to the baby sitter  
And say see that man thats my daddy  
Thats my daddy yeah

Poor Lucy poor Lucy poor Lucy oh Lucy
