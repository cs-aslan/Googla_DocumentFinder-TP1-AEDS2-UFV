Ooh hoo

When your plane touches down  
Are you sure that I aint talking to myself   
And when the seatbelt sign goes on  
You know youre not alone  
Cause Jodie I still love ya  
All the while  
  
And I wish ya all the best  
With your current success  
Dont let the flash boys turn your head  
And I dont mind you havin friends  
But your love is not to lend  
  
Cause Jodie I still love ya  
Always thinkin of ya  
Jodie I still love ya  
All the while

And I really really really really dont miss ya anyway not anyway  
And you know how I lie

So I wish you all the best  
With your current success  
Dont let the flash boys turn your head  
And I dont mind ya havin friends  
But your love is not to lend remember
