Its a hopeless situation  
And Im starting to believe  
That this hopeless situation  
Is what Im trying to achieve  
But I try to run on  
Its all or none  
All or none  
Heres the selfless confession  
Leading me back to war  
Can we help that our destinations  
Are the ones weve been before  
I still try to run on  
But its all or none  
All or none  
To myself I surrender  
To the one Ill never please  
But I still try to run on  
No I still try to run on  
But its all or none  
All or none
