Ive been wrong before  
And Ill be there again  
I dont have any answers my friend  
Just this pile of old questions  
My memory left me here  
In the field of opportunity  
Its plowin time again  
  
Im going back to my house  
But Im not goin now  
Its too early to be leaving here somehow  
Let me bore you with this story  
How my lover let me down  
While I borrow seeds of sadness  
From the ground  
  
In the field of opportunity  
Its plowin time again  
There aint no way of telling  
Where these seeds will rise or when  
Ill just wait around til springtime  
And then Ill find a friend  
In the field of opportunity  
Its plowin time again  
  
When Im all done cultivatin  
Ill be rockin on the porch  
Tryin to picture you and where you are  
And therell be no hesitatin  
When Cupid lights the torch  
With those headlights comin down the hill  
Between the stars  
  
In the field of opportunity  
Its plowin time again  
There aint no way of telling  
Where these seeds will rise or when  
Ill just wait around til springtime  
And then Ill find a friend  
In the field of opportunity  
Its plowin time again
