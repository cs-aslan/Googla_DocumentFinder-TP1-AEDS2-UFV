Wouldnt it be great  
If no one ever got offended  
Wouldnt it be great  
To say whats really on your mind  
Ive always said  
That all the rules are made for bending  
And if I let my hair down  
Would that be such a crime  
  
Chorus  
I want to be  
Consequence free  
I want to be  
Where nothing needs to matter  
I want to be  
Consequence free  
Just sing  
Nananananananana  
Oh nananananananana  
  
I could really use  
To lose my Catholic conscience  
Cause Im getting sick  
Of feeling guilty all the time  
I wont abuse it  
Yeah Ive got the best intentions  
For a little bit of anarchy  
But not the hurting kind  
  
Chorus  
  
I couldnt sleep at all last night  
Cause I had so much on my mind  
Id like to leave it all behind  
But you know its not that easy  
Oh for just one night  
  
Wouldnt it be great  
If the band just never ended  
We could stay out late  
And we would never hear last call  
We wouldnt need to worry  
About approval or permission  
We could slip off the edge  
And never worry about the fall  
  
Chorus
