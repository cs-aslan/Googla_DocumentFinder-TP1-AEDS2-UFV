I lost my heart a long time ago  
You made me feel like no one had before  
Boy you made me love you  
Then you walked out the door  
See I will not rest until you say Im forever yours  
  
Chorus  
And boy I wont stop at nothing  
I wont give you up  
And youve gotta feel something  
I know I will not love again  
Until you come back  
Come back to my arms  
Till you come back to me baby  
Until you come back  
  
I dont care how long baby  
Its not important to me  
Dont care how far  
Loves never too far for me oh no it aint  
I just might be crazy yes I am  
When it comes to my heart  
But I can not rest until  
The day were no longer apart  
  
Chorus  
  
To me  
Nobody plays with my heart  
You can walk away from it all baby  
You can run but your heart can not hide  
Cause it knows you belong in my arms  
  
Chorus  
  
To me  
Oh yeah  
Till you come back to me baby  
Come on home come home  
To me
