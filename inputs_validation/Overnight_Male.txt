Let me be your maleman  
And Ill always come though  
Theres no denying  
Come rain or shine  
Ill deliver my love to you  
I do things by the letter  
You can put your stamp on me  
Cause there aint nobody better  
For a special delivery  
  
Chorus  
Like the pony express  
And the wild wild West  
Ill ride hard all night long  
And I can saddle up fast  
Get ya there first class  
Long before the dawn  
You know your males gonna get to you  
Come snow rain sleet or hail  
Cause Im a top flight hold ya tight get ya there by daylight  
Do you right overnight male  
  
I know your heart is fragile  
So Ill handle it with care  
There aint no doubt  
I know loves route  
So baby let me take you there  
Ill bring you cards and flowers  
But I know just what you need  
Just give me 24 hours  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
  
Chorus  
  
You know your males gonna get to you  
Come snow rain sleet or hail  
Cause Im a top flight hold ya tight get ya there by daylight  
Do ya right overnight male  
Yeah Im a top flight hold ya tight get ya there by daylight  
Do ya right overnight male
