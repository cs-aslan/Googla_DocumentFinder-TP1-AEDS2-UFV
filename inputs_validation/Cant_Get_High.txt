Ive been working all day  
Ive been shaking it loose  
Its been raining for hours  
Ive been spilling my juice  
Nothing means nothing  
I couldnt care less  
And now that youre gone  
I cant even guess  
Ive got snakes in my cellar  
Ive got blood in my bed  
Bombs in the closet  
Theyre all painted cherry red  
And a feel like a mad scientist  
Ive got loose change in my head  
Nothing but trouble these days  
I eat bullets in my bread  
  
Now that youre gone  
Im sober every night  
I cant get high  no   
I cant get right  
  
Violent romantic  
On a seven day binge  
Losin a gamble  
But I get my revenge  
Start thinking about thunder  
And I get mad again  
Soaking up electricity  
Like bourbon and gin  
  
Now that youre gone  
Im sober every night  
I cant get high  no   
I cant get right  
  
Hallucinated green light  
And I slammed on the gas  
My performance aint perfect  
But its loud and its fast  
Set sail for the new world  
And I burned down the mast  
Well it wasnt the first time  
And I know it wont be the last  
  
Now that youre gone honey  
Im sober every night  
I cant get high  no   
I cant  get  right  
Get right
