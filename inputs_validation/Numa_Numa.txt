Intro  
Numa numa  
Numa numa  
Numa numa  
Numa numa  
  
Verse 1  
You call me up  
Numa numa  
Its like a broken record  
Numa numa  
Saying that your heart hurts  
Numa numa  
That you never get over him getting over you  
Numa numa  
And you end up crying  
Numa numa  
And I end up lying  
Numa numa  
Cos Im just a sucker for anything that you do  
  
PreChorus  
And when the phone call finally ends  
You say thanks for being a friend  
Numa numa  
And were going in circles again and again  
  
Chorus  
I dedicate this song to you  
The one who never sees the truth  
That I can take away your hurt heartbreak girl  
Hold you tight straight through the daylight  
Anyone can  
Im right here when you gonna realize  
That Im your cure heartbreak girl  
  
Verse 2  
I bite my tongue  
Numa numa  
But I want to scream out  
Numa numa  
You could be with me now  
Numa numa  
But I end up telling you what you want to hear  
Numa numa  
But youre not ready  
Numa numa  
And its so frustrating  
Numa numa  
He treats you so bad and Im so good to you its not fair  
  
PreChorus  
And when the phone call finally ends  
You say Ill call you tomorrow at 10  
Numa numa  
And Im stuck in the friendzone again and again  
  
Chorus  
I dedicate this song to you  
The one who never sees the truth  
That I can take away your hurt heartbreak girl  
Hold you tight straight through the daylight  
Anyone can  
Im right here when you gonna realize  
That Im your cure heartbreak girl  
  
Bridge  
I know someday its gonna happen  
And youll finally forget the day you met him  
Sometimes youre so close to your confession  
Ive gotta get it through your head  
That you belong with me instead anyone can  
  
Chorus  
I dedicate this song to you  
The one who never sees the truth  
That I can take away your hurt heartbreak girl  
Hold you tight straight through the daylight  
Anyone can  
Im right here when you gonna realize  
That Im your cure heartbreak girl
