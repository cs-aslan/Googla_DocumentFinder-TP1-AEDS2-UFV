Dark and grey an English film the Wednesday play  
We always watch the Queen on Christmas Day  
Wont you stay  
  
Though your eyes see shipwrecked sailors youre still dry  
The outlooks fine though Wales might have some rain  
Saved again  
  
Lets skip the news boy Ill go and make some tea  
Arabs and Jews boy too much for me  
They get me confused boy puts me off to sleep  
And the thing I hate oh Lord  
Is staying up late to watch some debate on some nations fate  
  
Hypnotized by Batman Tarzan still surprised  
Youve won the West in time to be our guest  
Name your prize  
  
Drop of wine a glass of beer dear whats the time  
The grime on the Tyne is mine all mine all mine  
Five past nine  
  
Blood on the rooftops Venice in the spring  
The Streets of San Francisco a word from Peking  
The trouble was started by a young Errol Flynn  
Better in my day oh Lord  
For when we got bored wed have a world war happy but poor  
So lets skip the news boy Ill go and make some tea  
Blood on the rooftops too much for me  
When old Mother Goose stops and theyre out for twenty three  
Then the rain at Lords stopped play  
Seems Helen of Troy has found a new face again
