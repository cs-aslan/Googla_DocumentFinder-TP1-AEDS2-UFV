Through the burning sun  
And the driving rain  
Over the sea  
Across the plain  
Ill ask you once

Wont you be my love  
Wont you be my friend

The lights are low  
The hour is late  
Dont you want me baby  
Through your garden gate  
Dont you feel it coming  
And it feels so strong  
I will never ever  
Ever do you wrong  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Now the mountain is high  
The river is deep  
We always knew  
We hold the key  
Roses red  
Violets blue  
Love you baby  
Till Im dead  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
