From the corner of my eye I see a tear rolling down  
At the time I couldnt tell whose tear it was  
If it was mine I should be glad  
That I still function in this cage  
But if its yours it only makes me more lost  
To see a tear rolling down  
To see a tear rolling down  
This is the last call for ellis island  
These are the last words Im ever gonna hear you say  
So goodbye babe  
Goodbye babe  
I hear sweethearts whisper their undying love  
Above the noise on the quay their voices rise  
They must have something so strong in the face of such change  
That they can promise and promise all night  
Oh their undying love hear their undying love  
This is the last call for ellis island  
These are the last words Im ever gonna hear you say  
So goodbye babe  
Goodbye babe  
Oh what you wouldnt give to be down on the pier once again  
Far away from the cries of this warweary horde  
Time up there in the clouds must be hard to endure  
When your hearts unsure  
Its like a knife in my gut knowing youre taking leave  
I feel Im sentenced to a death without appeal  
I can pretend its all a dream  
And what Im seeing will disappear  
But the end I can see is all too real  
Knowing youre taking leave  
Knowing youre taking leave  
This is the last call for ellis island  
These are the last words Im ever gonna hear you say  
So goodbye babe  
Goodbye babe
