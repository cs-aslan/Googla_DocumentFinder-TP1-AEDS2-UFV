Theres no stoppin the cretins from hoppin  
You gotta keep it beatin  
For all the hoppin cretins  
  
Cretin Cretin  
Im gonna go for a whirl with my cretin girl  
My feet wont stop  
Doin the Cretin Hop  
Cretin Cretin  
  
Onetwothree  
Cretins want to hop some more  
Fourfivesixseven  
All good cretins go to heaven  
Rockaway Beach  
Chewing out a rhythm on my bubble gum  
The sun is out and I want some  
Its not hard not far to reach  
We can hitch a ride
