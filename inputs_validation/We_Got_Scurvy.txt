Our gums are black our teeth are falling out  
We got spots on our backs so give it up and shout  
We got Scurvy we need some vitamin C  
We got Scurvy we need a lemon tree  
We got Scurvy we just chillin on the sea  
Lets get this Scurvy started  
A pirate aint worthy  
Till he got some Scurvy  
Since youve got Scurvy on your nervy when you sing that song  
Scurvy Scurvy  
We got Scurvy scurvy  
We got Scurvy scurvy  
We got Scurvy scurvy
