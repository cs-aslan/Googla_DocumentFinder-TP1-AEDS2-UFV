Now you know this aint the kind of life for you  
Its not the way you thought that it would be  
If I could change my way to you  
If I could change it wouldnt be me  
And you see  
  
I know I never tried the things I should have done  
Oh and time is always passing by  
I want to do the things I never done before  
So I do try not to tell a lie  
When Im so low when Im so high  
Yet you cry when I say I cant give you more  
  
First you said youd never try to slow me down  
That evrything would work out really fine  
But as those walls closed in on us  
Your words just fell right out of line  
And behind  
  
I know I never tried the things I should have done  
And time is always passing by  
I want to do the things I never done before  
So I do try not to tell a lie  
When Im so low when Im so high  
Yet you cry when I say I cant give you more  
  
Oh oh oh cant give you more  
Cant give any more  
Oh oh oh cant give you more  
Aint got any more  
  
Did you figure ours would be an easy thing  
Like lazy days of lying in the sun  
I told you if you wanted me  
That evry day just wouldnt be fun  
Now its done  
  
I know I never tried the thing I should have done  
And time is always passing by  
I want to do the things I never done before  
So I do try not to tell a lie  
When Im so low when Im so high  
Yet you cry when I say I cant give you more  
  
Oh oh oh cant give you more  
Cant give you more  
Oh oh oh cant give you more  
I aint got any more  
Oh oh oh I aint got any more  
I aint got any more  
Oh oh oh cant give you more  
I aint got any more
