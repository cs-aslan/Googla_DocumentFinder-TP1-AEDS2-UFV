Somewhere a telephone is ringing right now  
Someones old sweetheart is on the line  
Shes calling to patch up an old love affair  
Oh I wish it was mine  
Somebodys writing a letter right now  
And saying Lawd oh I was blind  
Somebodys darling longs to come home  
Oh I wish it was mine  
But you never write me and you never phone  
Theres somebody else on your mind  
And somebodys heart is glad you dont love me  
Oh I wish it was mine  
 guitar   
But you never write me  
Oh I wish it was mine
