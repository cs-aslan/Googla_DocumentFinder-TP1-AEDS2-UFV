What would you think if I sang out of tune  
Would you stand up and walk out on me  
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song  
And Ill try not to sing out of key  
  
Oh Ill get by with a little help from my friends  
Oh Ill get high with a little help from my friends  
Oh Ill get by with a little help from my friends my friends  
  
What do you do when our love is away  
Does it worry you to be alone  
And how does it feel by the end of the day  
Are you sad because youre on your own  
  
Oh Ill get by with a little help from my friends  
Oh Ill get high with a little help from my friends  
Oh Ill get by with a little help from my friends  
Do you need any body  
I need somebody to love  
Could it be anybody  
I need somebody to love to love to love  
  
Would you believe in this love at first sight  
Yes Im certain that it happens al the time  
What do you see when you turn out the light  
I cant tell you but I know that its mine  
  
Oh Ill get by with a little help from my friends  
Oh Ill get high with a little help from my friends  
Oh Ill get by with a little help from my friends  
Do you need any body  
I need somebody to love  
Could it be anybody  
  
I need somebody to love  
Oh Ill get by with a little help from my friends  
Oh Ill get high with a little help from my friends  
Oh Ill get high with a little help from my friends  
Oh Ill get by with a little help from my friends  
With a little help from my friends my friends my friends
