Hey Johnny hey Dee Dee  
Little Tom and Joey  
You know were comin over  
Sweet sweet little Ramona  
Youre getting better and better  
Its getting easier than ever  
Hey you kids in the crowd  
You know you like it  
When the musics loud  
  
Sweet sweet little Ramona  
She always wants to come over  
Sweet sweet little Ramona  
I think Ill try and phone her  
  
I let her in if youre wondering why  
Cause shes a spy for the BBI  
I let her in and I started to cry  
And then I knew I wanted to die  
Oooh little Ramona
