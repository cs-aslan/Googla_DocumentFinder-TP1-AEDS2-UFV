As a child I was known for makebelieving  
All alone I created fantasies  
As I grew people called it selfdeceiving  
But my heart helped me hold the memories  
  
As I walk through the world I find around me  
Something new yet familiars in the air  
I feel it evrywhere  
Like a childs eyes  
On a Christmas night  
Im lookin at you now  
Finding answers to my prayers  
  
1 Its a new day for those good old dreams  
One by one it seems theyre comin true  
Heres the morning that my heart had seen  
Heres the morning that just had to come through  
Same old stage but what a change of scene  
No more dark horizons only blue  
Its a new day for those good old dreams  
All my life I dreamed of lovin you  
  
Youre a spark of a long forgotten fire  
Youre a touch of a slowly growing wind  
Youre a taste of the everchanging seasons  
Telling me there are some things that dont end  
We have left all the darkness far behind us  
All those hopes that we held along the way  
Have made it to this day  
Like an old love song  
Gone for much too long  
You hear it once again  
And it carries you away  
  
Repeat 1  
Its a new day for those good old dreams  
And Its all because of you
