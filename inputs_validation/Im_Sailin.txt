Im sailin sailin  
To a place Ive never seen  
Thats way down south  
Sweet ol New Orleans  
Cause my hometown friend treats me awful mean  
  
If I could holler  
Yeah holler  
If I could scream and cry  
It hurts me so  
When I look up in the sky  
Cause my friends turn their heads  
As they pass me by  
  
Now its rainin  
Its rainin  
The winds blowin cold  
Lord I thought I heard  
My train whistle blow  
Now Im gonna sail so far  
Til I wont be back no more  
  
Pardon me Pardon me  
Its so hard to stand  
I aint got no money  
Uncle Sam has called my name  
Now theres not a soul  
To give me a helpin hand
