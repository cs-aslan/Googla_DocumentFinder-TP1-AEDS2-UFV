Oh Im on my way I know I am  
Somewhere not so far from here  
All I know is all I feel right now  
I feel the power growing in my hair  
  
Sitting on my own not by myself  
Everybodys here with me  
I dont need to touch your face lo know  
And I dont need to use my eyes to see  
  
I keep on wondering if I sleep too long  
Will I always wake up the same or so  
I keep on wondering if I sleep to long  
Will I even wake up the same or something  
  
Oh Im on my way I know I am  
But times there were when thought not  
Bleeding half my soul in bad company  
I thank the moon I had the strength to stop  
  
Im not making love to anyones wishes  
Only for that light I see  
Cause when Im dead and lowered low in my grave  
Thats gonna be the only thing thats left of me  
  
And if I make it to the waterside  
Will I even find me a boat or so  
And I if I make it lo the waterside  
Ill be sure to write you note or something  
  
Oh Im on my way I know I am  
Somewhere not so far from here  
All I know is all I feel right now  
I feel the power growing In my hair  
  
Oh life is like a maze of doors  
And they all open from the side youre on  
Just keep on pushing hard boy try as you may  
Youre going to wind up where you started from  
Youre going to wind up where you started from
