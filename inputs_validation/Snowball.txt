Red lights on the skyscrapers  
Snow white all over  
Smoky pipes spitting out dirty waters  
Daybreak in one hour  
Lost clouds nightmarish shadows  
Coming from the dark like black widows  
Walking backwards and endless fall  
Makes me loose control  
Im a snowball  
Children at school  
Candies in their mouth  
Blue swimming pools  
Facing the south  
Golden countries  
Inhabited by fairies  
Moonlight fading in the rising sun  
No need to fight Im out of the run  
Im loosing control  
Im a snowball  
No use to stay I run away  
Tomorrow will be same as today  
Its high time for me to make it  
But its hard time to face  
No use to stay I run away  
Why should I stay  
What could they say  
Its time for me to break the wall  
Im a snowball  
Dad hits mum  
Mum hates dad  
Familys done  
Growing up sad  
Dad is fool  
Mum is crying  
Deep in my soul  
Somethings breaking  
Dad has stopped  
To hurt mum  
A strange shot  
When dad is gone  
Mummys head  
Leaning over  
Dad is dead  
Game over
