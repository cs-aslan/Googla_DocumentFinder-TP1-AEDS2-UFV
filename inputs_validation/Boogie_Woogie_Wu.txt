Boogie Woogie Wu  
  
The beast lives out of the raging storm in the dead of night  
The ravenous bloodsick creatures searches for its sacrifice  
Through the hideous darkness it lurches driven by death itself  
Only the satisfaction of slaughter will cause it to return to  
The darkness from which it came  
  
Boogie woogie woogie woogie wu2x  
  
Boys and girls its nighty night time  
Happy J the Clown has a nursery rhyme  
Its about The Boogie Woogie Man  
Keep your light on as long as you can  
Cause when it cuts off so does your head  
Boogie Woogie Woogie waits under your bed  
With a shank splah up through the bottom  
Little Jimmy Jimmy uh got em  
  
Its the one and only Boogie Man  
He creeps he hides he sneaks he slides  
If you little feetsies are hanging off the edge of the bed  
Youre running on stumps motherfucker  
  
Well moonlight fills the room that you sleep in  
Things go bump in the night me creeping  
Ouch Fuck I stubbed my toe  
If youd just quit leaving your shit all over the fucking floor  
Fuck it youre dead anyway  
And Im gonna leave your head smack dab in the hallway  
In the morning when your daddy walks out  
AAAAHHH His foots in your mouth thanks to the Boogie Man  
  
Chorus  
Boogie woogie woogie woogie wu here comes the boogie man  
Boogie woogie woogie woogie wu haha haha haha haha  
Boogie woogie woogie woogie wu make way for the boogie man  
Boogie woogie woogie woogie wu mom dad ah no  
  
Does the Boogie Man really exist  
Well is your mother a baldheaded freak bitch yes  
You fall asleep and you wake up dead  
With a broken broom sticking out your forehead  
I sing lullabies till you dose off  
Tie you down and chew your fuckin toes off  
And then spit em out back in your face  
Splat Fuck wash your feet bitch  
  
The worlds famous Boogie Woogie Wu will come to you  
Slumber parties sleepovers intimate nights  
What the occasion for the midnight hour  
He will gladly come and fuck that shit up  
  
I dont beat woman fuck that Im above it no no  
But Ill cut her fucking neck and think nothing of it  
I bet you didnt know the Boogie Man was a clown  
But when you see the juggla your holding your jugular  
With a swing chop stab swing chop  
Youre holding your neck together but your nuts drop  
And the cops do the best they can  
They pull the axe out your face and say  
Was it the Boogie Man  
What was he wearing  
  
Chorus  
  
Please dont let me fall asleep  
Cause the Boogie Man will creep  
Through my window in my room  
Stab me with a broken broom  
Please dont let me fall sleep  
Cause the Boogie Man will creep  
Through my window in my room  
Stahhh Boogie Woogie Woogie  
  
Its the incredible undeadable Boogie Man  
Go ahead pull the covers over your head  
Hide under them he dont give a fuck  
Itll just make it that much more easier  
For him to suffocate your face  
  
Theres three ways to stop me from doing what I do  
What you think Im a tell you  
Mom can you leave the door open a bit  
Thanks an easy way in you fucking idiot  
Now I stretch your neck out and play in like a banjo  
Boomchicka boomchicka like that shit yo  
Then I stretch it out more and fling your head through the wall  
Its the Boogie Man yall  
  
Chorus
