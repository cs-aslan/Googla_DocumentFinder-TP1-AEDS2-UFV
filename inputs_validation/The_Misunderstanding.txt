Well we know where the true one lies  
And you cant say its our imagination  
Just because we cannot find the proof  
Weve shared this thought for some considerable time  
Its increasingly unlike the rest  
For as we get older weve become less aware  
Security lies at the heart of our lives  
Attaching ourselves to ourselves  
Were extinguished but were still alive  
  
Misunderstood but our intention is good  
We were not questioned on our replies  
It does you no good  
Though you think that it should  
And it would given half a chance  
If theres compassion in your hearts  
Now that youve seen enough  
Weve given of our best  
For gods sake you know  
Please please please please please please please please can we go home  
Is this the time or place to say goodbye  
Regardless Ill find my final cue  
Well sneak out the back door and close it
