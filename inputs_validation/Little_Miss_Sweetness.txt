Now Im a guy whos fond of sweet things  
Sweet things I adore  
In coffee most take one or two lumps but I use three or four  
But since I kissed your sweet sweet lips  
Sugar aint sweet no more  
Your kiss was sweeter than any cup of coffee I ever made before  
  
You know youre Little Miss Sweetness  
Ah youre Little Miss Sweetness  
The sweetest girl in the world  
If ever a man had a sweet tooth I have one indeed  
I order cookies and cakes malts and shakes from the menus that I read  
  
But all the cakes and shakes and malts Ive bought put together  
Dont exceed the sweetness in just one of your kisses  
Baby youre the one I need  
  
You know youre Little Miss Sweetness  
Ah youre Little Miss Sweetness  
The sweetest girl in the world  
  
Now listen to me you sweet thing  
Hear what I have to say  
If ever you need somebody send for me without delay  
  
But do one thing for me Dont go out on a rainy day  
Cause if its true that rain melts sugar you will surely melt away  
  
You know youre Little Miss Sweetness  
Ah youre Little Miss Sweetness  
The sweetest girl in the world  
Trying to tell you youre Little Miss Sweetness  
The sweetest girl in the world  
The sweetest girl in the world
