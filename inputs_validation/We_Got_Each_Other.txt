CHORUS  
Walkin hand and hand  
As only lovers can  
You must understand  
Weve got each other  
They can scream and fuss  
It wont bother us  
And that is because  
Weve got each other  
I can recall memories we shared  
Such love none other could compare  
Do you remember when you were loving me  
Holding me How could this love not be  
CHORUS  
Lost in dreams I spend the hours  
Scared in the dark in a room that once was ours  
Do you remember when you were loving me  
Holding me How could this love not be  
BRIDGE  
We are one sharing each others dreams  
With a love that only we could bring  
Ive got you Ive got you  
Weve got each other  
Ive got you Ive got you  
Weve got each other  
Ive got you Ive got you  
Weve got each other  
Ive got you Ive got you too  
Weve got each other  
Ive got you Ive got you  
Weve got each other  
Ive got you Ive got you too  
Weve got each other  
Weve got each other  
Weve got stride for stride  
Movin side by side  
With a strength and pride  
Weve got each other  
They can scream and fuss  
It wont break our trust  
What weve got is us  
Weve got each other  
Weve got each other  
Weve got each other
