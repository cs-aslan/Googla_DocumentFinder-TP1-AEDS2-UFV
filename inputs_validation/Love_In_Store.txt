All I know is the way that I feel  
Whenever youre around  
Youve got a way of lifting me up  
Instead of bringing me down  
Instead of bringing me down  
  
I cant fight it anymore  
Since youve been around  
Weve got love in store  
  
Youre the only one I ever felt  
Could be special to me  
You look at me and I just melt  
Im scared of feeling that way  
  
I cant fight it anymore  
Since youve been around  
Weve got love in store  
  
Never take your love away  
Beggin you baby  
Never take your love away  
Oh darlin  
Never take your love away  
Beggin you baby  
Never take your love away
