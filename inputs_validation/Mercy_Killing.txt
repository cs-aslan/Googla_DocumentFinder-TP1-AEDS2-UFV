Shirley I love you til Im drunk  
And on and on and never to stop  
The way I see it its sad to say it but its true  
Youre gonna be all that I need  
So sad to see her looking so rusted  
There must be more to life than this  
Or wed be mercy killing us  
Yeah killing us baby  
The last trains leaving theres nothing left  
Cept to confess to love and happiness  
The way I see it its sad to say it but its true  
Youre gonna be all that I need  
So sad sad to see her looking so rusted  
There must be more to life than this  
Or wed be mercy killing us  
Oh yeah killing us baby  
Well slip past a graveyard  
Love me do
