Chorus  
Say youll stay until tomorrow  
I cant face tonight alone  
Though I know its over and were through  
Say youll stay until tomorrow  
  
I need you  
The words have all been said  
Your minds made up to go  
Youre standing by the bed  
Like someone I dont know  
  
Your love has died and there is nothing you can do  
Though you try though you try  
Yes you try yes you try  
You cant live you cant live  
With a lie so  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive known for some time now  
That things just aint been right  
Cause when we try to talk  
We both get so uptight  
  
But now youve told the truth  
And I know where I stand  
Though it hurts though it hurts  
Deep inside deep inside  
Give me time give me time  
Ill get by so  
  
Chorus  
  
Though I know its over and were through  
Say youll stay until tomorrow  
I need you
