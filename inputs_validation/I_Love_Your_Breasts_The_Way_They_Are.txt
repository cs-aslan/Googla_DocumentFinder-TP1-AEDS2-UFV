I Love Your Breasts The Way They Are  
I Love You Just The Way You AreBilly Joel  
  
Dont go padding your bra to please me  
You never had much chest before mmmm  
And dont imagine your hoots is Jewedah  
cuz I dont need a whole lot more  
  
Oh Youd probably leave me if they were bigger  
Your bust would keep me from your heart mmmmm  
Id miss the good times I love the flat times  
I love your breasts the way they are  
  
I need to know that you will always wear  
A trainer acup 32  
Oh  
How could you think that theyre not pleasing me  
The way that Ive been squeezing you  
  
Woah I dont want heaving mounds of cleavage  
I never want to work that hard  
Ohhhh  
I just want something that I can fondle  
I love your breasts the way they are  
Ohhhhhhh
