Got out of bed wasnt feeling too good  
With my wallet and my passport a new pair of shoes  
The sun is shining so I head for the park  
With a bottle of Tequila and a new pack of cigarettes  
  
I got a cousin and she got a friend  
Who thought that her aunt knew a man who could help  
At his apartment I knocked on the door  
He wouldnt come out until he got paid  
Now dont tell anybody what I wanna do  
If they find out you know that theyll never let me through  
  
Its no fun being an illegal alien  
Its no fun being an illegal alien  
  
Down at the office had to fill out the forms  
A pink one a red one the colours you choose  
Up to the counter to see what they think  
They said It doesnt count man it aint written in ink  
Dont trust anybody least not around here cause  
  
Its not fun being an illegal alien  
Its not fun being an illegal alien  
Its not fun being an illegal alien  
Its not fun being an illegal alien  
An illegal alien OK  
  
Consideration for your fellow man  
Wouldnt hurt anybody sure fits in with my plan  
Over the border there lies the promised land  
  
So dont tell anybody what I wanna do  
If they find out you know that theyll never let me through  
  
Its no fun being an illegal alien  
Its no fun being an illegal alien  
Its no fun being an illegal alien  
Its no fun being an illegal alien
