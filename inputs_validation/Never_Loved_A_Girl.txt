Youre a no good heartbreaker  
Youre a liar and youre a cheat  
I dont know why I let you do these thing to me  
My friends keep telling me that you aint no good  
They dont know that I would leave you if I could  
I guess Im on tight  
And Im stuck like glue  
Cause I aint never  
I aint never  
I aint never no no  
Loved a girl the way that I  
I love you  
  
Sometimes I know I thought  
You would run out of fools  
But I was so wrong  
You got one that youll never lose  
The way you treat me is shame  
How could you hurt me so bad  
Baby you know that Im the best thing that you ever had  
Kiss me once again  
Dont you never never say that were through  
Cause I aint never  
Never  
Never no no  
Loved a girl the way that I  
I love you  
  
I cant sleep at night I cant eat a bite  
I guess Ill never be free  
Since you got your hooks in me  
  
I aint never loved a girl  
I aint never loved a girl  
Aint never loved a girl that hurt me so bad  
What am I gonna do about it  
I tell you Im gonna hold on to her  
Im gonna hold on to her
