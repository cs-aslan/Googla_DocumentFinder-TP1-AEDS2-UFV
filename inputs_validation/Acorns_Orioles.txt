Over the summer  
Somehow waiting sometimes craving  
And I gave it all away  
Left my mind stripped away  
Kept everyone away  
  
I cant tell you anything you dont already know  
I cant tell you anything you dont already know  
I cant tell you anything  
  
I am the minister and the imposter  
You said Im on my own  
Bu I am not alone  
You are the militant fighting to bring me home  
  
I cant tell you anything you dont already know  
I cant tell you anything you dont already know  
I cant tell you anything  
  
I cant tell you anything you dont already know
