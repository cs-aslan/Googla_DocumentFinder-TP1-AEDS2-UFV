Keep the fire burning in your eyes  
Pay attention to the open sky  
Youll never know what will be coming down  
I dont remember losing track of you  
Youre always dancing in and out of view  
I must have thought you would always be around  
Always keeping things real by playing the clown  
Now youre nowhere to be found  
I dont know what happens when people die  
Cant seem to grasp it as hard as I try  
Its like a song I can hear playing right in my ear  
But I cant sing I cant help listening  
I cant help feeling stupid standing around  
Crying is the easier down  
Cause I know that you would rather wed be dancing  
Dancing our sorrow away  
No matter what fate throws in your way  
Just do the steps that youve been shown  
By everyone youve ever known  
Until the dance becomes your very own  
No matter how close to yours  
Anothers steps have grown  
In the end there is one dance youll do alone  
Keep a fire for the human race  
Let your prayers go drifting into space  
Youll never know what will be coming down  
Perhaps a better world is drawing near  
Just as easy it could all disappear  
Along with whatever meaning you might have found  
Dont let the uncertainty turn you around  
Go on and make a joyful sound  
Into a dancer you have grown  
From a seed somebody else has thrown  
Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own  
And somewhere between the time you arrive  
The time you go may lie a reason you were alive  
But youll never know
