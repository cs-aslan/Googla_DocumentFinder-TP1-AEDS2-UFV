Just when I believed I couldnt ever want for more  
This ever changing world pushes me through another door  
I saw you smile  
And my mind could not erase the beauty of your face  
Just for awhile  
Wont you let me shelter you  
  
Chorus  
Hold on to the nights  
Hold on to the memories  
I wish that I could give you something more  
That I could be yours  
  
How do we explain something that took us by surprise  
Promises in vain love that is real but in disguise  
What happens now  
Do we break another rule  
Let our lovers play the fool  
I dont know how  
To stop feeling this way  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I think that Ive been true to everybody else but me  
And the way I feel about you makes my heart long to be free  
Every time I look into your eyes Im helplessly aware  
That the someone Ive been searching for is right there  
  
Chorus
