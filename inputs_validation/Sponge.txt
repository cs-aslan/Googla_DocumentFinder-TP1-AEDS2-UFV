Pleasure is melting like chocolate  
My blue ribbon gumption is gone  
All my gravy must have soaked into something  
And the world  
The filthy steps the cold concrete  
The phony earth below my feet  
The ancient odor of the streets  
Yes the world it is a sponge  
And when the crisis passes  
When the coast is clear  
Ill be buffed down to a liquid  
And the world it is a sponge  
Throughout this entire ugly outing  
Ive been mumbling the convex of what I should be shouting  
But Ill soon be silent youll soon hear nothing  
cause the world it is a sponge
