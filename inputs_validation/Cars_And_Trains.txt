Pretty girl little girl what were you thinking  
Just 18 at the time  
You were a mother and child at the same time  
You were a mother and child  
So young and fucked up baby  
Always higher than a child should see  
Forgive me  
  
To the top of that building  
Under cars and trains  
Taking the pill that you know will kill you  
Under the wheels wheels wheels  
  
Mama dont you let him stay

Mama dont let him stay please  
Dont let him stay
