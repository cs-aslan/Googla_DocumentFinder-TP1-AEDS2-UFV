Hello me meet the real me  
And my misfits way of life  
A dark black past is my  
Most valued possession  
Hindsight is always 2020  
But looking back its still a bit fuzzy  
Speak of mutually assured destruction  
Nice story tell it to Readers Digest  
  
Feeling paranoid  
True enemy or false friend  
Anxietys attacking me and  
My air is getting thin  
Im in trouble for the things  
I havent got to yet  
Im chomping at the bit and my  
Palms are getting wet sweating bullets  
  
Hello me its me again  
You can subdue but never tame me  
It gives me a migraine headache  
Sinking down to your level  
Yea just keep on thinking its my fault  
And stay an inch or two outta kicking distance  
Mankind has got to know  
His limitations  
  
Feeling claustrophobic  
Like the walls are closing in  
Blood stains on my hands and  
I dont know where Ive been  
Im in trouble for the things  
I havent got to yet  
Im sharpening the axe and my  
Palms are getting wet sweating bullets  
  
Well me its nice talking to myself  
A credit to dementia  
Some day you too will know my pain  
And smile its blacktooth grin  
If the war inside my head  
Wont take a day off Ill be dead  
My icy fingers claw your back  
Here I come again  
  
Feeling paranoid  
True enemy or false friend  
Anxietys attacking me  
And my air is getting thin  
Feeling claustrophobic  
Like the walls are closing in  
Blood stains on my hands  
And I dont know where Ive been  
  
Once you committed me  
Now youve acquitted me  
Claiming validity  
For your stupidity  
Im chomping at the bit  
Im sharpening the axe  
Here I come again whoa  
Sweating bullets
