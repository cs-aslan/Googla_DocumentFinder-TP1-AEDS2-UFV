We hear you crying  
So bitterly  
Trying to get people to help you ye ye  
But nobody will  
Your son was brutalizing people everytime  
But you said nothing  
Now its the time to pay the price  
Its time to pay ye ye ye ye  
  
Chorus  
You gonna reap just what you sow x4  
  
Coming back home  
With stolen things  
Instead of telling him  
How wrong he was  
You told him how clever he was  
People coming out of burning houses  
Its your son Driving stolen cars every time  
Its your son  
But you said nothing  
But now hes turning against you  
  
Chorus  
You gonna reap just what you sow x3  
  
Everybody knows  
No jail can keep him  
Cause you rubbing shoulders with the law  
But now its time to pay the price wo woh  
Chorus till fade
