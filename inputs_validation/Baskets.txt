Shell hang the baskets on the walls  
Dont you know Ive seen it all before  
Shell hang the baskets on the walls  
But Ive seen it all before heard the slamming of the door  
Come summer come fall  
Come winter therell be baskets on the floor  
  
Hell go to buy her Turtle Wax  
But in his mind he wont be coming back  
Shell hang the baskets on the walls  
But Ive seen it all before heard the slamming of the door  
Come summer come fall  
Come winter therell be baskets on the floor  
  
But Ive seen it all before heard the slamming of the door  
Come summer come fall  
Come winter therell be baskets on the floor  
  
Shell hang the baskets on the wall  
Shell hang the baskets on the wall  
Shell hang the baskets on the wall  
Shell hang the baskets on the wall  
Shell hang the baskets on the wall  
Shell hang the baskets on the wall
