Puff done remixed one hell of a track  
Put me on it  
I wanna know  
How many want it  
Damn it feels good to see people love on it  
For those who love slow down  
Member Motown had a brotha happy as shit  
I mean the whole sound  
Bangin and catch sixfour since we was shorties  
Fee owes now rebooked from California  
  
Carry 40s but I member them times in 79  
When I first started to rhyme  
Sometimes I gots to look back at what it was  
The good old days  
The triple oshays when there was love  
  
I want you back  
But I cant grab that far  
Its how it is  
When youre living like a star bad boy  
Come on lets go  
  
Mj  
When I had you to myself  
I didnt want you around  
Those pretty faces  
Always made you  
Stand out in a crowd  
But someone picked you from the bunch  
When love was all it took  
Now its much too late for me  
To take a second look  
  
Oh baby give me one more chance  
To show you that I love you  
Wont you please let me  
Back in your heart  
Oh darlin I was blind to let you go  
Let you go baby  
But now since I see you in his arms  
I want you back  
Oh I do now  
I want you back  
Oh oh baby  
I want you back  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I want you back  
Nah nah nah nah  
  
Trying to live without your love  
Is one long sleepless night  
Let me show you girl  
That I know wrong from right  
Every street you walk on  
I lay tear stains on the ground  
Following the girl  
I didnt even want you around  
  
Let me tell ya now  
Oh baby all I need is one more chance  
To show you that I love you  
Wont you please let me  
Back in your heart  
Oh darlin I was blind to let you go  
Let you go baby  
But now since I see you in his arms  
I want you back  
  
Black Rob

Tito Mike and Marlon  
Only think on my mind now is stardom  
Blowin the Fup
