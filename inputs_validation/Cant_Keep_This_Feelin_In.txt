I just got to tell someone about the way I feel  
Shout it from the rooftop to the street  
And if I spread the word please tell me whos it gonna  
Hurt  
Im in love with you girl  
Let me talk to the world  
I feel like Im up there riding a rocket to the moon  
And Im gonna tell them where Ive been  
  
Cant keep this feelin in  
Not for another minute  
I cant hold it back  
You know Im trying to  
I just gotta count the ways  
You bless my days  
Baby I cant keep this feelin in  
  
Some things should be private just between  
The two of us  
Trust me when I say my lips are sealed  
My god Its no big secret that Im crazy  
For your love  
Want to put up a sign that the lady is mine  
If youre superstitious Im gonna try to  
Hold it down  
But Im going out there on a limb  
Cant keep this feelin in  
Not for another minute  
I cant hold it back  
You know Im trying to  
I just gotta count the ways  
You bless my days  
Baby I cant keep this feelin in  
  
I know its better if we take it slow  
Thats when the hours feel like years  
Ive gotta tell somebody thats all I know  
If Ive gotta whisper whisper in their ears  
  
Repeat chorus out
