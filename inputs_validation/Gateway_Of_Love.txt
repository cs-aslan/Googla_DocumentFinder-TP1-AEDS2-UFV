Try to find  
The perfect time  
To say something to you  
Filled with meaning  
Filled with truth  
  
If I could just live my life  
As easy as a song  
Id wake up someday  
And the pain will all be gone  
Help me now Im sinking fast  
I gotta get along  
To the Gateway of Love  
Gateway Of Love  
  
Background noise  
On a changing sky  
Youll be making love to me  
I still feel you  
In my hearts eye  
  
But Im just a dusty soul  
With nothing much to say  
Down here in the hay  
Bound to stay that way  
Ive got almost everything  
Except that little key  
To the Gateway of Love  
Gateway of Love  
  
Some will say  
Theres a place on high  
Where angels rip their wings  
And babys learn to fly  
Some will say  
Theres a place on high  
  
But Id like to stay down here  
Try to love someone  
Here in this life  
Where we watch the bouncing sun  
Id just like to hold her hair  
And bring her back to me  
At the Gateway of Love  
Gateway of Love  
  
If I could just live my life  
As easy as a song  
Id make up some game  
And the pain would all be gone  
Help me now Im sinking fast  
I gotta get along  
To the gateway of love  
Gateway of Love
