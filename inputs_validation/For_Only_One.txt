A simple gospel message  
In a little church one day  
Touched the heart of one  
Who listened  
As the congregation prayed  
Thered been an invitation  
Inviting all to come but kneeling  
Down to pray was only one  
For only one He would have suffered  
And given up His life for only one  
Hed have borne the shame  
And made the sacrifice  
For God so loved the whole world  
He gave His only Son but I believe  
Hed have done the same  
For only one  
Now some may say why bother  
With only one or two  
But Jesus knows the feeling  
When the only one is you  
So if you hear Him calling  
Dont be ashamed to come  
Even if youre the only one  
For only one He would have suffered  
And given up His life for only one  
Hed have borne the shame  
And made the sacrifice  
For God so loved the whole world  
He gave His only Son but I believe  
Hed have done the same  
For only one  
For only one  
He would have died for only one  
You are the one  
For only one He would have suffered  
And given up His life for only one  
Hed have borne the shame  
And made the sacrifice  
For God so loved the whole world  
He gave His only Son but I believe  
Hed have done the same  
For only one
