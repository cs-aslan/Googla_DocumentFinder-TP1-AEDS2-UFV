Im running out of my time  
Im running out of breath  
And now its getting so  
I cant sleep at night  
In the day feel like death  
  
Im getting in far too deep  
I feel them closing in  
Ive got to say that Im scared  
I know theyll win  
Even so Im prepared  
  
Do you believe what you hear  
Can you believe what you see  
Do you believe what you feel  
Can you believe  
  
What is real  
Futureal  
What is real  
Futureal  
  
Whenever anyone seems  
To treat me like a freak  
It makes me see Im the  
Only one who feels  
That I know what is real  
  
Sometimes it feels like a game  
Of deadly hide and seek  
And when youre reading this  
Then Ill be gone  
Maybe then you will see
