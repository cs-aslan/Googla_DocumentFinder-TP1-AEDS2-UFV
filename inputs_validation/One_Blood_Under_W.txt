Rundin from fires of the city and tee blood  
Blood blood blood blood  
You two ta both from EEheema ah ya both from Jahnker  
You ta both from fire outside  
You both from Toahee  
One blood one blood one blood  
  
I was rollin showin my age unshaven  
Rugged with my Timberland boots that paid  
I walk with a slight lean from the way that my heat  
Givin a green the shine infrared beam  
At the street traffic light recorders  
Takin pictures of our corners  
Cameras on the side of the buildings we destroy em  
The Chameleon throws cream to children out the window  
We movin in unmarked vans disguised as a light tan  
With plastic phasers in rubber hands  
Fuck fame I shoot a hole in a 50 cent piece to test my aim  
How dare you call the Gods in vein  
Not knowin the seriousness of this and why I came  
To Earth feet first  
I dare you lion tame to the beat of the drum  
No questionin to the session I walk with gun  
The magnum of bustes head for many directions unknown  
Another statistic change the ballistics  
On the nozzle make em goggle and swallow  
Scrape the craters of the brain for data  
Old scriptures on withered paper  
Beginnin take shape and form  
When the gods get on it and crash your college dorm  
  
You two ta both from uptown ah your both from downtown  
Your ta both from Anahtown ah yeah both from round town  
One blood one blood one blood  
The pussy nit find it  
Travel won raise your wine  
Thats blood yud blood  
  
Now verse 2 even more deadly than the first unrehearsed raw footage  
Part 2 for you I give this dedication project elimination  
Hes a burnt offering nothing up my sleeve  
Im just vanishing with the vanishing cream  
Heres Jews to live by dentify before you intake cant leave with weed  
Fuck that you waist no time in search of those who cant breathe  
A bum only has one time to explode  
When I break Im takin everything  
Turn the city streets to Dusty Rhodes  
Behold this return of the Invincible Tone  
Rude like Governor Tuse and King Toustume  
Who gave the order to bust em  
Dont ask this is Genuine Draft  
Blueprint ultimate legit sting international stone love classical  
Comin back to attack in black fatigue  
WuTang and Junior Reid  
  
You two ta both from Lebanon ah ya both from Iran  
You da both from China ah ya both from Japan  
One blood one blood one blood  
You two ta both from uptown ah ya both from down sout  
You da both from Anahtown ah ya both from long   
One blood one blood one blood  
The pussy nit find it  
Travel won raise your wine  
Thats blood yuud blood blood  
Mothers fighting daughters every day  
Fathers fighting sons  
Sisters hating sisters  
Rappers getting murdered every day  
You two da both from Eehheema ah ya both a Juhnker  
You da both from fire outside
