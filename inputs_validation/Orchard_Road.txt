To tell the truth its really such a sad affair  
Standing here waiting in the cold night air  
But Ive got to make this call  
Cause my heart is breaking  
  
I hear the bips drop a coin in the slot  
Has it been that long  
I thought youd forgotten me  
Well I know that its getting late  
But I just couldnt wait  
  
Will I have the nerve to say  
I just wanna come back  
You shouldnt just go away  
I just wanna come back  
  
Ive been struck by such a bad luck  
I need a place a little happiness and some love  
I think I can see it now  
Now let me paint the picture  
  
Its twelve oclock and the curtains are drawn  
Theyre counting sheep down in orchard road  
Youre hanging on the telephone line tonight  
And I wish I could be in orchard road  
  
Not much been happening here  
I think Ive got a job  
Theyre gonna call me next week  
And Ill be working out of town  
But it sure beats hanging around  
  
Whats that Tomorrow at two  
Youre kidding me no  
Is it alright with you  
I dont know what to say  
Itll be like a holiday  
  
When you say youre all alone  
Makes me wanna come back  
And this house is not a home  
I just gotta go back  
  
Its twelve ten when I put down the phone  
The moons shining down on orchard road  
And Im feeling like a schoolboy again and tonight  
Ill see you in my dreams of orchard road  
  
Its funny but I thought Id never go back  
I think sometimes I might loose track  
But I remember you and the things we do  
And I want it back  
  
In orchard road youve got my heart  
I left it in your doorway  
In orchard road a welcome back  
Is waiting there just for me  
In orchard road the sun will shine  
Again I know I know  
In orchard road you keep my love  
Just waiting there for me  
  
Its eight oclock and the dawns arrived  
In orchard road its breakfast time  
I climb in my car and I turn the key and Im gone  
I am coming home  
To orchard road  
  
Im coming home
