You didnt mean to do it  
But you did it again  
The night started out  
Fuckin around with your friends  
Somebody screamed and thingd went bad  
Now youre standing accused  
And the prosectuor says you should be dead  
  
And theyre fryinup your hair  
In that little electric chair  
Theyll be fryinup your hair  
In that little electric chair  
Theyll be fryinup your hair  
In that little electric chair  
Fryin up your hair  
In that little electric chair  
  
Electric chair Repeat x3  
  
Easy street is nice in a lawless nation  
The police puts some flyers in circulation  
Stuck one in my door with some scary mugshot  
Theyre looking for some bad boys  
Height weight age race tatoos too  
  
But theyre fryinup that hair  
In that little electric chair  
Theyll be fryinup some hair  
In that little electric chair  
Theyll be fryinup some hair  
In that little electric chair  
Theyll be fryinup that hair  
In that little electric chair  
  
Electric chair Repeat x3  
  
The people are quietly lusting for blood  
They wanna live in peace but they dont wanna budge  
From their lazy ways and lazy notions  
If the other halfs win  
Let em eat pigeons  
And live in prison  
  
And theyre fryinup that hair  
In that little electric chair  
Theyll be fryinup some hair  
In that little electric chair  
Theyll be fryinup that hair  
In that little electric chair  
Theyll be fryinup some hair  
In that little electric chair  
  
Electric chair Repeat x4
