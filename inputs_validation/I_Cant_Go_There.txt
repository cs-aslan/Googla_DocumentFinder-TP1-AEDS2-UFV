Kenny  
You know that restaurant on highway 1  
With the key lime pie that song the sand and the sun  
Where we ran in our barefeet  
Built a castle on the beach  
Just the wind the rocks the waves and you and me  
  
Chorus  
I cant go there  
cause thats just too much us  
I cant go there  
I still feel your touch  
Theres places in my heart and here that feel as empty  
As our bed  
So most nights I dont even walk upstairs  
cause I cant go there  
  
Remember San Francisco on that cable car  
Our reflection in the window of that store  
How we danced the night away  
With the lights out on the bay  
Then wound up in a blanket on the floor  
  
Chorus  
I cant go there  
cause friscos too much us  
I cant go there  
I still feel your touch  
Now theres places in my heart and here that  
Still feel as empty as our bed  
So most nights I dont even walk upstairs  
cause I cant go there  
  
If it was only florida or California  
Maybe I could let myself move on  
But its everywhere weve been  
And everywhere I turn  
I cant love again  
cause Ive learned  
  
That I cant go there  
Its somethin I cant do  
I cant go there  
Ill run into you  
I cant go there  
  
Tim Mcgraw  
When the sun shines when it rains  
Christmas partys football games  
  
Kenny I cant go there  
  
Tim Winter summer fall or spring  
I see you in everything  
  
I cant go there  
Its too much us  
I cant go there
