My girls wear lipstick while theyre making my beats  
They got guitar picks in their purses Louboutins on their feet  
They got no time for waiting in lines  
They got sex and 808s running through their dirty minds  
  
My girls were running the show  
My girls were teasing all the boys on the go  
My girls cause thats the way that we roll  
My girls so ladies step it up and take control  
  
Now shout my girls were stronger than one  
Now shout and sometimes we gotta have fun come on  
  
My girls headed to the city yall  
We got Cosmo on the dash and tickets on the floor  
We got Sia and Rhonna and Peaches too  
We got Johanna and JD and were coming for you  
  
My girls my girls  
  
My girls were running the show  
My girls were teasing all the boys on the go  
My girls cause thats the way that we roll  
My girls so ladies step it up and take control  
  
Now shout my girls were stronger than one  
Now shout and sometimes we gotta have fun come on  
  
My girls are screaming and yelling and getting loud  
My girls are shaking up the party while youre getting down  
My girls are singing and dancing and having fun  
My girls are cooking up a beat and they want you to come  
  
I like my girls hot sweet tough or play me  
Either way trainable primate  
Self reliant giant death defiant  
No Colby Briant  
I take it both for you if you give me a taste  
I wreck a mullet or two yeah below the waist  
Youre my bff youre my 606  
303 am I swingin  
  
My girls stay close when they see trouble around  
They got jewels on their fingers its about to go down  
We got no time for haters you know we just came to party  
Come on now here we go  
  
My girls were running the show  
My girls were teasing all the boys on the go  
My girls cause thats the way that we roll  
My girls so ladies step it up and take control  
  
Now shout my girls were stronger than one  
Now shout and sometimes we gotta have fun  
My girls were stronger than one  
Now shout and sometimes  
Now shout we gotta have fun
