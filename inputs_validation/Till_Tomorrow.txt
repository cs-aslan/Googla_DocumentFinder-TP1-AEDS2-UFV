What can this be  
Can you tell me  
  
Would you like to discover why were not free to be lovers  
Ive been wanting to ask you  
  
Where has all the love gone and what have we become  
Storm clouds full of thunder move silent as they drum  
And when theyre gone well be fine till tomorrow  
Though I hope it wont rain  
  
You will be mine and my sorrow will take wings in the morning  
High above the heavens a rainbow paints the sky  
White doves sing their songs of love  
I watch them as they fly and wonder  
What can this be Can you tell me  
Would you like to discover why were not free to be lovers
