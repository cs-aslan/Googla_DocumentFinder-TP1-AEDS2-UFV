Well shes a tongue twisting storm she will come to the show tonight  
Praying to the light machine  
She wants my honey not my money shes a funkythigh collector  
Layin on lectric dreams  
  
Chorus  
So come on come on weve really got a good thing going  
Well come on well come on if you think were gonna make it  
You better hang on to yourself  
  
We cant dance we dont talk much we just ball and play  
But then we move like tigers on vaseline  
Well the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar  
Youre the blessed were the spiders from Mars  
  
Chorus x 3  
Come on ah come on ah repeat ad inf
