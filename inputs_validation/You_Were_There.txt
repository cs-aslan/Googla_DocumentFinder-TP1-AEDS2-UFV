I guess you heard I guess you know  
In time Id have told you but I guess Im too slow  
And its overly romantic but I know that its real  
I hope you dont you mind if I say what I feel  
Its like Im in somebody elses dream  
This could not be happening to me  
Chorus  
But you were there and you were everything Id never seen  
You woke me up from this long and endless sleep  
I was alone  
I opened my eyes and you were there  
Dont be alarmed no dont be concerned  
I dont want to change things  
leave them just as they were  
I mean nothings really different  
Its me who feel strange  
Im always lost for words when someone mentions your name  
I know Ill get over this for sure  
Im not the type who dreams there could be more  
Chorus  
But you were there and you were everything Id never seen  
You woke me up from this long and endless sleep  
I was alone  
I opened my eyes and you were there  
Can I take your smile home with me  
or the magic in your hair  
The rain has stopped the storm has passed  
Look at all the colors now the suns here at last  
I supposed that youll be leaving but I want you to know  
Part of you stays with me even after you go  
Like an actor playing someone elses scene  
This could not be happening to me  
But you were there and you were everything Id never seen  
You woke me up from this long and empty sleep  
I was alone  
I opened my eyes and no Im not alone Im not alone  
I opened my eyes and you were there
