Nothings last forever  
Of that Im sure  
Now youve made an offer  
Ill take some more  
Young loving may be  
Oh so mean  
  
Will I still survive  
The same old scene  
In our lighter moments  
precious few  
  
Its all that heavy weather  
Were going through  
When I turn the corner  
I cant believe  
  
Its still the same old movie  
Thats haunting me  
Young loving may be  
Oh so mean  
  
Trying to revive  
The same old scene  
Young loving may be  
So extreme  
  
Maybe we should try  
The same old scene Repeats  
Nothings last forever  
Of that Im sure  
Now youve made an offer  
Ill take some more
