Im on a sentimental journey  
Into sight and sound  
Of no return and no looking back or down  
A conscientious objector to the  
War thats in my mind  
Leaving in the lurch and Im  
Taking back whats mine  
  
Im on a mission  
Into destination unknown  
An expedition  
Onto desolation road  
where Im a  
  
Castawaygoing at it alone  
Castawaynow Im on my own  
Castawaygoing at it alone  
Castawaynow Im on my own  
Lost and found trouble bound  
Castaway  
  
Im riding on the night train and  
Driving stolen cars  
Testing my nerves out on the blvd  
Spontaneous combustion in the  
Corners of my mind  
Leaving in the lurch  
And Im taking back whats mine  
  
Im on a mission  
Into destination unknown  
An expedition  
Onto desolation road  
where Im a  
  
Castawaygoing at it alone  
Castawaynow Im on my own  
Castawaygoing at it alone  
Castawaynow Im on my own  
Lost and found trouble bound  
Castaway
