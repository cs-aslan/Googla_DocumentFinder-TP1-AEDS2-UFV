Wake up little Susie wake up  
Wake up little Susie wake up  
Weve both been sound asleep wake up little Susie and weep  
The movies over its four oclock and were in trouble deep  
Wake up little Susie  
Wake up little Susie well  
  
Whatta we gonna tell your mama  
Whatta we gonna tell your pa  
Whatta we gonna tell our friends when they say oohlala  
Wake up little Susie  
Wake up little Susie well  
  
I told your mama that youd be in by ten  
Well Susie baby looks like we goofed again  
Wake up little Susie  
Wake up little Susie we gotta go home  
  
Wake up little Susie wake up  
Wake up little Susie wake up  
The movie wasnt so hot it didnt have much of a plot  
We fell asleep our goose is cooked our reputation is shot  
Wake up little Susie  
Wake up little Susie well  
  
Whatta we gonna tell your mama  
Whatta we gonna tell your pa  
Whatta we gonna tell our friends when they say oohlala  
Wake up little Susie  
Wake up little Susie  
Wake up little Susie
