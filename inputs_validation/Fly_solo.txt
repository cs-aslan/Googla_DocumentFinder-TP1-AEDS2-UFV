Chorus  
I had a dream that the whole world was staring at me  
I woke up and wasnt no one there  
Wasnt no one there yeah eh eh  
Same song to a different beat  
Cause sometimes I feels like Im the only one there  
I guess nobody cares hey  
But everythings good until it goes bad  
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have  
It hurts when it dont last  
No easy way saying bye  
So Im a spread my wings and head for the sky  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I  
  
Im tired of being tired  
And dealing with your BS  
All the while supplying  
The money for your request  
Without me youre a dime  
But with me youre a buck fifty ha ha  
I can get another one quickly  
But Id rather weight it out  
Take the broken pieces try and fix it  
Or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision  
And Ill be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit  
Ha  
  
Chorus  
  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I  
Remember what you said  
But what you say to me aint guaranteed to always be the Gospel  
I was doing good way before I met you  
Now youre off the set  
And Im a let you see the show go on without you  
Take a bow think about it  
And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it  
See you be catching feelings now and I be catching planes  
The story of my life youre just another page  
  
But everythings good til it goes bad  
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have  
It hurts when it dont last  
Easy way saying bye  
So Im a spread my wings and head for the sky  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I  
  
I had a dream that the whole world was staring at me  
I woke up and wasnt no one there  
Wasnt no one there  
Yeah eh eah
