Verse 1  
Reaching higher than towers  
Wasnt anywhere we couldnt went  
We had unbreakable powers  
When our bodies meet its everything  
This is was a beautiful vision  
Even love was not a way you could describe it  
And then there comes a collision  
Nothing ever goes in the night  
  
PreChorus 1  
And theyre not lost forever  
Lost what once was here  
Its now just spots  
Now the fireworks are fading  
Is it over  
Lost you in the summer two years ago  
  
Chorus  
You you you  
Im still thinking bout you you you  
Two years ago  
You you you  
Im still thinking bout you you you  
Two years ago  
  
Verse 2  
If theres no storm whyre we a shipwreck  
Thought our love is insurmountable  
He knows my heart is still aching  
Never thought it would be caused by you  
  
PreChorus 2  
Were not lost forever  
Lost what once was here  
Its now just spots  
Now the fireworks are fading  
Is it over  
Lost you in the summer two years ago  
  
Chorus  
You you you  
Im still thinking bout you you you  
Two years ago  
You you you  
Im still thinking bout you you you  
Two years ago  
  
PostChorus  
Im wide awake and I can feel us moving on  
Two years ago  
Theres a part of me that still believes that we belong  
Two years ago  
Im wide awake and I can feel us moving on  
Moving on moving on moving on  
  
Bridge  
And the reason I cant forget is I think you do too  
I know you think of me too  
Ill use this moment to really forget  
I will soon but for now  
Im still thinking bout you you you  
Im still thinking bout you you you  
Im still thinking bout you you you  
Im still thinking bout you you you  
  
Chorus 2

About you about you  
Im still thinking bout you you you  
Two years ago  
About you about you  
Im still thinking bout you you you  
Two years ago  
  
PostChorus  
Im wide awake and I can feel us moving on  
Two years ago  
Theres a part of me that still believes that we belong  
Two years ago  
Im wide awake and I can feel us moving on  
Moving on moving on moving on  
Two years ago  
  
Outro  
Im wide awake and I can feel us moving on  
Theres a part of me that still believes that we belong  
Im wide awake and I can feel us moving on  
Moving on moving on moving on
