A man stood in the shadows his face was dripping sweat  
He took a break from running but he wasnt done yet  
Looked over his shoulder when he heard the barking hounds  
Dug his feet into the earth and headed out of town  
The town lines far away and  
He wont sleep for days  
Because he just slept with Annie and shes the sheriffs wife  
Now the sheriffs men have got him running for his life  
  
He should have known that girl was trouble but he wasnt thinking clear  
When she put her hand onto his leg and filled his glass with beer  
But a deputy did see them and tracked the sheriff down  
Just had time to grab his clothes and high ball out of town  
  
The town lines far away and  
He wont sleep for days  
And even if he makes it theres nothing he can do  
But hope and pray the sheriff there hasnt heard the news  
  
A man stood in the shadows thinking about the past  
About all the women he had known and living life too fast  
But he heard a noise behind him felt a gun against his head  
Should have known the sheriff wouldnt rest till he was dead  
  
The town lines far away and  
Hes six feet in the grave  
Hes lying there with Annie who was the sheriffs wife  
Till the sheriff and his men robbed them of their lives
