Familiar sounds tell me its morning the night has been so dark and long  
Each night without you just gets longer  
While this torch I still carry just burns stronger  
I know I never will stop loving you my tears just cant put out the flame  
Or drown my hopes of your returning cause baby the fires still burning  
  
Steel  
  
Wherever you are I hope youre happy although your love for me has died  
But if you ever need or want me Ill take you back any time  
I know I never will stop  
Yes baby the fires still burning
