No me puedo controlar aqui con el senor LL Cool J  
Y aqui estoi  
1 2 3 muevete  
  
The club was far from empty  
It was crowded at the entry  
I slide right through like how I do  
This girl began to tempt me  
She said her name Shaiyeeda  
I could tell her mama feed her  
When they tight and when them jeans dont fit  
Im L nice to meet ya  
I could feel my body yearnin  
The room just started turnin  
Didnt wanna go out on the floor  
But this girl was so determined Lets dance  
My brain began to sizzle  
Im sweatin just a little  
On the dance floor in the middle  
She turned around and giggled  
She said  
  
You got you got you got  
What it takes to make me leave my man  
  
Its hard to control myself  
Its hard to control myself  
You got you got you got  
What it takes to make this boy be bad  
Its hard to control myself  
Its hard to control myself  
  
Its hard for me to control myself  
Get to hold myself  
Back from  
Jumpin on ya  
Like I wanna  
Like I wanna wanna  
  
Temptation is a mother  
How we lust for one another  
We barely know eachother  
Yet were whilin like were lovers uh huh  
The air is filled with passion  
The strobe lights are flashin  
The hustlers throw cash n  
The bar tender keeps splashin  
Her moves were so erotic  
Her games were so hypnotic  
I bet this girl could stop it  
But she continued to pop it  
  
You know I know you like it  
Let me hit you on your sidekick  
Cause the after party is at my body  
Meet me youre invited  
  
You got you got you got  
What it takes to make me leave my man  
  
Its hard to control myself  
Its hard to control myself  
You got you got you got  
What it takes to make this boy be bad  
Its hard to control myself  
Its hard to control myself  
  
Its hard for me to control myself  
Get to hold myself  
Back from  
Jumpin on ya  
Like I wanna  
Like I wanna wanna  
  
She licked off  
Her lip gloss  
Her hips toss  
Back and forth  
Side to side and  
Up and down  
She touched the ground  
It turned me out  
Im battlin desire  
Lord help me douse this fire  
This internal inferno  
Hotter than a shot of cuervo  
Her top was short and purple  
Belly dancin in a circle  
When I feel like this I cant resist  
I  dont make me hurt you  
She said  
  
You got you got you got  
What it takes to make me leave my man  
  
Its hard to control myself  
Its hard to control myself  
You got you got you got  
What it takes to make this boy be bad  
Its hard to control myself  
Its hard to control myself  
  
Its hard for me to control myself  
Get to hold myself  
Back from  
Jumpin on ya  
Like I wanna  
Like I wanna wanna
