Dawn is a feeling  
A beautiful ceiling  
The smell of grass  
Just makes you pass  
Into a dream  
Youre here today  
No future fears  
This day will last  
A thousand years  
If you want it to  
You look around you  
Things they astound you  
So breathe in deep  
Youre not asleep  
Open your mind  
Youre here today  
No future fears  
This day will last  
A thousand years  
If you want it to  
Do you understand  
That all over this land  
Theres a feeling  
In minds far and near  
Things are becoming clear  
With a meaning  
Now that youre knowing  
Pleasure starts flowing  
Its true life flies  
Faster than eyes  
Could ever see  
Youre here today  
No future fears  
This day will last  
A thousand years  
If you want it to
