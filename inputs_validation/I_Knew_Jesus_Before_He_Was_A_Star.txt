Well funny it seems as how everyone knows him now  
Suddenly they have found someone whos been around  
Back to the fold they come seeking his wisdom from a far  
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar  
Well you know Im a believer in all that hes ever been  
Stories Ive read of him things that were said of him  
Songs that they glorify I used to play on my guitar yes I did  
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar  
Ive known his goodness and mercy for all my days  
Ive seen his blessings around me in every way  
In times of trouble when I had no hope in view  
Who brought the sunlight the one light that I knew  
Oh yes I knew he was always there answering every prayer  
Fame will not change him much he wont be out of touch  
Great as he is today big people stay the way they are yes they do  
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar  
Ive known his goodness  
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar  
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar
