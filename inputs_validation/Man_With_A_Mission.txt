Im a dog in a manger  
A cat with a mouse  
Im the prodigal stranger  
Ill burn down the house  
Im a selfeducator  
A collector of news  
Im the cool liberator  
Any topic you choose  
  
Im a man with a mission  
Im a shooting star  
Ive got no inhibitions  
I dont care who you are  
  
Got my eye on the future  
And my hand on the pulse  
Theres a whole world of people  
In the back of the bus  
Theres a man on a tightrope  
Whos got nothing to share  
Just a whole lot of secrets  
And a head full of air  
  
Im a man with a mission  
Im a shooting star  
Ive got no inhibitions  
I dont care who you are  
  
Its the Tropic of Cancer  
The meaning of soul  
Theres a change in the weather  
To have and to hold  
The method of access  
A handful of dust  
Its just par for the course boy  
Get back on the bus  
  
Im a man with a mission  
Im a shooting star  
Ive got no inhibitions  
I dont care who you are
