I made a mistake yes I did yes I did  
Made a mistake yes I did yes I did  
Now Im so far from her but it was me and my fate  
Who lost because of my mistake  
  
My trusting her has gone much too late  
Ive sent away the girl I love  
I said Ive sent away the girl I love  
She well gone people crying  
  
Said my bold heart been dying  
Who is it who made that mistake  
Who is it who made that mistake  
Oh what a fool Ive been tonight  
  
The girl I love is out of sight  
Now Im so far from her but it was me and my fate  
Who lost because of my mistake  
My trusting her has gone much too late  
  
Oh what a fool Ive been tonight  
The girl I love is out of sight  
Now Im so far from her but it was me and my fate  
Who lost because of my mistake my my mistake  
Who lost because of my mistake
