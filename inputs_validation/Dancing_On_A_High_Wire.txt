Were living in a different reality were toeing the same line  
We give in we call it neutrality a joke with no punchline  
The silver plated hero meets the golden hearted whore  
The oddsll give you zero shell be leaving in a few days more  
Movin on forever  
Maybe she dont care  
Holding on together  
Maybe it just aint there  
Youre dancing on a high wire  
You need to be so sure  
There used to be a lifeline  
There isnt anymore  
We are the same with no similarity talk at the same time  
We believe in freedom and charity as long as I get mine  
The ivory Madonna is walking through the door  
You watch her from a window it doesnt matter anymore  
Movin on forever  
Maybe she dont care  
Holding on together  
Maybe it just aint there  
Youre dancing on a high wire  
You need to be so sure  
There used to be a lifeline  
There isnt anymore  
Movin on forever  
Maybe she dont care  
Holding on together  
Maybe it just aint there  
Youre dancing on a high wire  
You need to be so sure  
There used to be a lifeline  
There isnt anymore  
Dancing on a high wire  
You need to be so sure  
There used to be a lifeline  
There isnt anymore
