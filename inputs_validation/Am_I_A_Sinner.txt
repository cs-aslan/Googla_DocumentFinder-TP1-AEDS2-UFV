Keep telling myself  
Get out of my mind  
The way it feels  
It feels so right  
  
And every night  
I feel the heat  
Close my eyes  
And it comes to me  
  
I confess if Ive done it wrong  
But in your eyes I see Im guilty  
Im guilty  
  
The stress that keeps me strong  
I feel as though  
My heart is empty  
Cause youre not with me  
  
In my secret place  
Where I drift away  
  
Tell me am I a sinner  
Tell me am I wrong  
Something is wrong with the picture  
This is not my fault  
So am I a sinner  
Am I a sinner  
  
Dont watch the truth unfold  
Please dont try to see right through me  
When you touch me  
  
You will never know  
Imagination starts to haunt me  
It controls me In my secret place  
Where I drift away  
  
Tell me am I a sinner  
Tell me am I wrong  
Something is wrong with the picture  
This is not my fault  
So am I a sinner  
Am I a sinner  
  
Am I a sinner  
Am I a sinner  
Just tell me  
Am I a sinner  
  
Tell me am I a sinner  
Tell me am I wrong  
Something is wrong with the picture  
This is not my fault  
So am I a sinner  
  
Tell me am I a sinner  
Tell me am I wrong  
Something is wrong with the picture  
This is not my fault  
So am I a sinner  
Am I a sinner  
  
Am I a sinner  
Am I a sinner  
Am I a sinner  
Just tell me  
Am I a sinner
