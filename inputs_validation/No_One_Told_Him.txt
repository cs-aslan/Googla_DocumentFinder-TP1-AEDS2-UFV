Hey listen closely  
Listen while I tell you  
Why he loves you  
And what he misses mostly  
  
Its pointless his pretending  
Hes got a broken heart  
A broken heart  
That needs mending  
  
You didnt tell him  
You didnt want to see him again  
  
Hes going crazy  
Hes reckless  
Without you baby  
Hes helpless  
  
Its deadly how you broke him  
Hes a fool  
Without you baby  
Im not joking  
  
You didnt tell him  
You didnt want to see him again  
  
Now when Im down  
My friends they come around  
And when Im upset  
My friends they help me forget  
  
But how can he forget  
He hasnt got a friend  
Cause no one told him  
You didnt want to see him again  
  
Hes all washed up and washed out  
Without you baby  
Every place he goes  
Hes thrown out  
  
Hes turned vicious  
Hes malicious  
Just goes to show how much he misses  
You know what  
  
He wouldnt tell me  
You didnt want to see him again  
  
You didnt tell him  
You didnt want to see him again  
  
I couldnt tell him  
You didnt want to see him again  
  
I didnt tell him  
You didnt want to see him again
