I wanna love I wanna leave  
I want you to love me I want you to leave me  
I want to stand where I can see  
Im watching you love me Im watching you leavin me now  
  
Chorus  
But I wish I could be somebody else  
I wish I could see you in myself  
I wish there was something inside me to keep you beside me  
And say what you really feel  
You know I need something thats real  
I wish there was something inside me to keep you beside me  
  
I wanna know if I could be  
Someone to turn to that could never hurt you  
But I know what you think of me  
Yeah you had a breakthrough and now Im just bad news for you  
  
Chorus  
  
I shouldve told you everything  
I never gave you anything  
I shouldve told you everything  
If I could give you anything  
Then I would tell you everything  
  
I wish I could be somebody else  
I wish I could see you in myself  
I wish there was something inside me to keep you beside me  
And say what you really feel  
You know I need something thats real  
I wish there was something inside me to keep you beside me  
  
I shouldve told you everything  
I shouldve told you everything  
I shouldve told you everything
