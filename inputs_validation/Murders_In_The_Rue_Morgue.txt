I remember it as plain as day  
Although it happened in the dark of the night  
I was strolling through the streets of Paris  
And it was cold it was starting to rain  
And then I heard a piercing scream  
And I rushed to the scene of the crime  
But all I found was the butchered remains  
Of two girls lay side by side  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Run before the killers go free  
  
Theres some people coming down the street  
At last theres someone heard my call  
I cant understand why theyre pointing at me  
I never done nothing at all  
But I must have got some blood on my hands  
Because everyones shouting at me  
I cant speak French so I couldnt explain  
And like a fool I started running away  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Am I ever gonna be free  
  
And now Ive gotta get away from the arms of the law  
All France is looking for me  
Ive gotta find my way across the border for sure  
Down the south to Italy  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Im never going home  
  
Well I made it to the border at last  
But I cant erase the scene from my mind  
Anytime somebody stares at me well  
I just start running blind  
Well Im moving through the shadows at night  
Away from the staring eyes  
Any day theyll be looking for me  
Cause I know I show the signs of  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the arms of the law  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Am I ever gonna be free  
  
It took so long and Im getting so tired  
Im running out of places to hide  
Should I return to the scene of the crime  
Where the two young victims died  
If I could go to somebody for help  
Itd get me out of trouble for sure  
But I know that its on my mind  
That my doctor said Ive done it before  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Theyre never gonna find me  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Im never going home
