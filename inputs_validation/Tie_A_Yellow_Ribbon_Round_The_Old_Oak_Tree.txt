Im comin home I done my time now I got to know what is an isnt mine  
If you received my letter  
Telling you Id soon be free  
Then youll know just what to do  
If you still want me  
If you still want me  
Tie a yellow ribbon  
Round the ole oak tree  
Its been three long years  
Do you still want me  
If I dont see a ribbon  
Round the ole oak tree  
Ill stay on the bus forget about us  
Put the blame on me  
If I dont see a yellow ribbon  
Round the ole oak tree  
Bus driver please look for me  
Cause I couldnt bare to see what I might see  
Im really still in prison  
And my love she holds the key  
A simple yellow ribbons what I need to set me free  
I wrote and told her please  
Tie a yellow ribbon  
Round the ole oak tree  
Its been three long years  
Do you still want me  
If I dont see a ribbon  
Round the ole oak tree  
Ill stay on the bus forget about us  
Put the blame on me  
If I dont see a yellow ribbon  
Round the ole oak tree  
Now the whole damn bus is cheering  
And I cant believe I see  
A hundred yellow ribbons  
Round the ole the old oak tree
