Verse 1  
There are moments that the words dont reach  
There is suffering too terrible to name  
You hold your child as tight as you can  
Then push away the unimaginable  
The moments when youre in so deep  
Feels easier to just swim down  
And so they move uptown  
And learn to live with the unimaginable  
  
I spend hours in the garden  
I walk alone to the store  
And its quiet uptown  
I never liked the quiet before  
I take the children to church on Sunday  
A sign of the cross at the door  
And I pray  
That never used to happen before  
  
Chorus  
If you see him in the street walking by himself  
Talking to himself have pity  
You would like it uptown its quiet uptown  
He is working through the unimaginable  
His hair has gone grey he passes every day  
They say he walks the length of the city  
You knock me out I fall apart  
Can you imagine  
  
Verse 2  
Look at where we are  
Look at where we started  
I know I dont deserve you  
But hear me out that would be enough  
If I could spare his life  
If I could trade his life for mine  
Hed be standing here right now  
And you would smile  
And that would be enough  
I dont pretend to know  
The challenges were facing  
I know theres no replacing what weve lost  
And you need time  
But Im not afraid  
I know who I married  
Just let me stay here by your side  
And that would be enough  
  
Chorus  
If you see him in the street walking by her side  
Talking by her side have pity  
Do you like it uptown Its quiet uptown  
He is trying to do the unimaginable  
If you see him walking in the park long after dark  
Taking in the sights of the city  
Look around look around look around  
They are trying to do the unimaginable  
  
Verse 3  
There are moments that the words dont reach  
Theres a grace too powerful to name  
We push away what we could never understand  
We push away the unimaginable  
They are standing in the garden  
Standing there side by side  
She takes his hand  
Its quiet uptown  
Forgiveness can you imagine  
Forgiveness can you imagine  
  
Chorus  
If you see him in the street walking by her side  
Talking by her side have pity  
Look around look around  
They are going through the unimaginable
