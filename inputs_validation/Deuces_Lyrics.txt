Dj drama  
You know when you drive fast cars  
You feeling easy and throw the peace sign up  
Shawty full of drama like gansta grizziles x3  
  
Gucci  
She on my pimp c Im pouring dueces  
We had a boy b but shawty screwed this  
Dont try to fix this because its usless  
I surely aint broke I need a new bitch  
I got a main chick and a mistress  
They think they fancy very expensive  
Im like some new money told my extra trade me  
Perferably in my A flexing south beach  
Im corriside front row waitin chris bosch  
Bron and gucci mane diamonds match her lip gloss  
I know my ex can see me and she pissed off  
I told her keep the memories bitch get lost  
Bitch kick rocks I got them sick rocks  
Throw them dueces up just to show my show wrist watch  
Bling blowjust to show my wrist watch  
Throw them dueces up just to show my six watch  
  
Chirs brown  
Im on some new shit  
Im chuckin my deuces up to her  
Im moving on to something better better better  
No more tryin to make it work  
You made me wanna say bye bye say bye bye say bye bye to her x2
