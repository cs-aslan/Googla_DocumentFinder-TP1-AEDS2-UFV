Under the arc of the weather stain boards  
Ancient goblins and warlords  
Come out of the ground not making a sound  
The smell of death is all around  
And the nights come and the cold wind blows  
No one cares and nobody knows  
I dont want to be buried in a pet cemetery  
I dont want to live my life again  
Ill follow Victor to a sacred place  
There aint no dream I can escape  
Molars and fangs and clicking of bones  
Spirits moaning among the tombstones  
When the night has come and the moon is bright  
Someone cries and something aint right  
I dont want to be buried in a pet cemetery  
I dont want to live my life again  
Oh no  
The moon is full the air is still  
All of a sudden I feel a chill  
Victor is grinning flesh rotting away  
Skeletons dance I curse this day  
And on the night when the wolves cry out  
Listen close and you can hear me shout  
I dont want to be buried in a pet cemetery  
I dont want to live my life again  
Oh no
