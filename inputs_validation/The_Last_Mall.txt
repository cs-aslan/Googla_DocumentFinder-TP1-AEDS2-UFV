Attention all shoppers  
Its cancellation day  
Yes the big adios  
Is just a few hours away  
  
Its last call  
To do your shopping  
At the last mall  
  
Youll need the tools for survival  
And the medicine for the blues  
Sweet treats and surprises  
For the little buckaroos  
  
Its last call  
To do your shopping  
At the last mall  
  
Weve got a sweetheart sunset special  
On all of the standard stuff  
Cause in the morning that gospel morning  
Youll have to do for yourself when the going gets tough  
  
Roll your cart back up the aisle  
Kiss the checkout girls goodbye  
Ride the ramp to the freeway  
Beneath the blood orange sky  
  
Its last call  
To do your shopping  
At the last mall
