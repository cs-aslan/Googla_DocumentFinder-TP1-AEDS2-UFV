This aint a song for the brokenhearted  
No silent prayer for the faithdeparted  
I aint gonna be just a face in the crowd  
Youre gonna hear my voice  
When I shout it out loud  
  
Its my life  
Its now or never  
I aint gonna live forever  
I just want to live while Im alive  
Its my life  
My heart is like an open highway  
Like Frankie said  
I did it my way  
I just want to live while Im alive  
Its my life  
  
This is for the ones who stood their ground  
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down  
Tomorrows getting harder make no mistake  
Luck aint even lucky  
Got to make your own breaks  
  
Its my life  
And its now or never  
I aint gonna live forever  
I just want to live while Im alive  
Its my life  
My heart is like an open highway  
Like Frankie said  
I did it my way  
I just want to live while Im alive  
Cause its my life  
  
Better stand tall when theyre calling you out  
Dont bend dont break baby dont back down  
  
Its my life  
And its now or never  
Cause I aint gonna live forever  
I just want to live while Im alive  
Its my life  
My heart is like an open highway  
Like Frankie said  
I did it my way  
I just want to live while Im alive  
Its my life  
And its now or never  
Cause I aint gonna live forever  
I just want to live while Im alive  
Its my life  
My heart is like an open highway  
Like Frankie said  
I did it my way  
I just want to live while Im alive  
Cause its my life
