Darling you were looking good  
When you came to me  
And asked for a dance  
And I said we can dance  
  
Felt like a queen  
Swedish summer nights are hot  
And the trees can talk  
We lay on the grass  
  
So easily so blessed  
Whispers in blindness  
And I didnt hold you back  
Im talking about it babe  
  
Cause youve been teasing me  
Im talking about it  
Cause you are bad right through  
Stay with me and I shall want  
  
No other love  
Stay with me another love another lie  
Stay with me and I shall want  
No other love  
  
You were talking so sweet  
But you were touching  
And teasing  
I can hear the soft bells ring  
  
Through a thousand years  
They call out to me  
They say its only once in a life we love  
Now Ive had the honor too  
  
You were holding my hand  
You were kissing my skin  
Stay with me  
Trees are whispering  
Only once my dear
