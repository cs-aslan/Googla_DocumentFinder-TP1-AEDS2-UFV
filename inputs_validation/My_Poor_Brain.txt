Real life is so hard  
We hide in the stars  
Thats where our heads are  
My head and your heart  
  
This is a blackout  
Dont let it go to waste  
This is a blackout  
I want to detonate  
  
When you are so far  
Im falling part  
Lose all my sonar  
You jam my radar  
  
This is a blackout  
Dont let it go to waste  
This is a blackout  
I want to detonate  
  
Sometimes I feel Im getting stuck  
Between the handshake and the fuck  
Youve got me on guard  
Ive got my head start  
My head and your heart  
The same in the stars  
  
This is a blackout  
Dont let it go to waste  
This is a blackout  
I want to detonate  
  
Sometimes I feel Im getting stuck  
Between the handshake and the fuck  
Brain brain brain brain  
Okay
