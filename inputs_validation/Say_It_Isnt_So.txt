Say it isnt so  
Say it isnt so  
Everyone is saying you dont love me  
Say it isnt so  
  
Everywhere I go  
Everyone I know  
Whispers that youre growing tired of me  
Say it isnt so  
  
People say that you  
Found somebody new  
And it wont be long before you leave me  
Say it isnt true  
  
Say that everything is still okay  
Thats all I want to know  
And what theyre saying  
Say it isnt so  
  
People say passing by  
Say hes younger than I  
And it wont be long before you leave me  
Tell me its a lie  
  
Say that everything is still okay  
Thats all I want to know  
And what theyre saying  
Say it isnt so
