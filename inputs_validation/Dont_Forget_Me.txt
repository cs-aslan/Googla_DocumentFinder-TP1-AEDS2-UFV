Im an ocean in your bedroom  
Make you feel warm  
Make you want to reassume  
Now we know it all for sure  
  
Im a dance hall dirty break beat  
Make the snow fall  
Up from underneath your feet  
Not alone Ill be there  
Tell me when you want to go  
  
Im a meth lab first rehab  
Take it all off  
And step inside the running cab  
Theres a love that knows the way  
  
Im the rainbow in your jail cell  
All the memories of  
Everything youve ever smelled  
Not alone Ill be there  
Tell me when you want to go  
  
Sideways falling  
More will be revealed my friend  
Dont forget me  
I cant hide it  
Come again make me excited  
  
Im an inbred and a pothead  
Two legs that you spread  
Inside the tool shed  
Now we know it all for sure  
  
I could show you  
To the free field  
Overcome and more  
Will always be revealed  
Not alone Ill be there  
Tell me when you want to go  
  
Sideways falling  
More will be revealed my friend  
Dont forget me  
I cant hide it  
Come again get me excited  
  
Im the bloodstain  
On your shirt sleeve  
Coming down and more are coming to believe  
Now we know it all for sure  
  
Make the hair stand  
Up on your arm  
Teach you how to dance  
Inside the funny farm  
Not alone Ill be there  
Tell me when you want to go
