Jingle jangle my love wears silvery bangles  
She likes to wander and thats why Im under  
The spell of her jingle jangle  
  
We used to cry on each others shoulder  
Now that Im older she wanders ahead  
Now that shes found love I still hear the sound of  
Silvery bangles remain in my head  
  
Jingle jangle my love wears silvery bangles  
She used to wander and thats why Im under  
The spell of her jingle jangle
