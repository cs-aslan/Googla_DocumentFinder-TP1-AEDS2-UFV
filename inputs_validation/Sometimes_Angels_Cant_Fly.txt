Somewhere tonight theres somebody cryin  
And feelin completely alone  
Somewhere tonight theres somebody tryin  
To find a way back home  
  
Mmmmm I dont know why  
Mmmmm but sometimes angels cant fly  
  
How many times have you judged a stranger  
Shakin your head in shame  
And wondered how could they fall so far  
Well maybe theyre not to blame  
  
Mmmmm I dont know why  
Mmmmm but sometimes angels cant fly  
  
Theyve got their wings and theyve got their will  
Theres blue sky all around  
But sometimes it seems that were destined to be  
Forever on the ground  
  
I dont know why no  
  
Look at us runnin around in circles  
Chasin our peace of mind  
Searchin in vain for our wayward halos  
That some of us never find  
  
Mmmmm I dont know why  
Mmmmm sometimes angels cant fly  
Mmm and I dont know why  
Mmm sometimes angels cant fly  
Mmm
