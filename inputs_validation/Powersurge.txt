Leave dont try  
They die to get inside  
A falling out between you and your pride  
No dont go  
  
Theres something you should know  
This blinding light can tear apart your soul  
Shattered dreams  
Are not all that they seem  
  
The light can change from white to blue to green  
Left to right  
Theres power in the night  
And the power surge  
Driven by the light  
  
Power building up  
Power all around you  
Power you feel it  
Power a power surge  
  
Stay away  
Theres something I must say  
This light reduces all thats in its way  
In the dark  
  
Ignited by a spark  
A fire burns a fire makes its mark  
See the flash  
A mountain turns to ash  
  
Recollection echoes of the past  
Right to left  
Powers what you get  
And the power surge  
Isnt over yet  
  
Power building up  
Power its coming back  
Power feel it  
Power power surge  
  
Coming out of the sun  
There are battles to be won  
Colors change from blue to red  
Forgotten heroes piles of dead  
  
A mass of steel down in flame  
Power surge remains the same  
Commandeer turns to dust  
The mass of steel begins to rust  
  
Power building up  
Power coming back  
Power in the air  
Power a power surge
