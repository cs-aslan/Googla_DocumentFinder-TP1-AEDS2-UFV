I remember the night so well  
The rain was fallin but I just couldnt tell  
If it was you that was callin to my lovesick brain  
But the rain kept fallin on my window pane  
  
Out of the night the thunder rang in my ear  
I cant fight the feelin Lord that brings forth my fears  
I wish it was over Lord please stop the rain  
The rain thats fallin on my window pane  
  
The rain thats fallin on my window pane  
Every night the rains on time I can feel it in this heart of mine  
But I dont know what to do  
Well I guess I could go back home cause you know back home is where I
belong  
But it just aint home without you  
  
And I dont know what to do baby  
Well I guess Im a looser but it just dont seem fair  
I lost all my life so tell me why should I care  
The night that you left me is the night that it came  
And the rains still fallin on my window pane  
  
The rain keeps fallin on my window pane  
The rain keeps fallin on my window pane  
You know the rain  
The rain keeps fallin on my window pane  
I said the rain  
The rain keeps fallin on my window pane  
You know the rain  
The rain keeps fallin on my window pane  
I said the rain  
The rain keeps fallin on my window pane  
You know the rain  
The rain keeps fallin on my window pane  
Keeps right on fallin  
The rain keeps fallin on my window pane  
  
I said the rain keeps fallin
