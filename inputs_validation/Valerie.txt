There comes a time in a mans life  
He must take responsibility  
For the choices he has made  
There are certain things that he must do  
Things that he must say  
  
Like I Love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobodys goin to know if its true  
  
I never thought Id feel this kind of hesitation tonight  
My hand on another girl  
I wish I didnt have to lie  
I wish I could let you know  
  
Cause I love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobodys going to know if its true  
  
Valerie  
I know you can see through me  
Valerie  
You just choose to never know  
Valerie  
Why pretend to trust in me  
I dont know why you try to trust in me baby but I think I might know   
Valerie  
Youd rather this than be alone  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Cause I love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobodys going to know if its true  
  
Cause I love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobodys going to know if its true  
  
And I love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobody gonna know
