Hands off  
I had a dream they took my hands off  
Although you probably think that Im soft boiled  
Im still in love with you  
  
Girlfriend dont sit round waiting for the world to end  
Ill keep my distance but I wont pretend  
Im not in love with you  
  
Chorus  
And its all your fault You spiked my malt  
You slipped a mickey in my heart  
And I cant shake free although Im shaking like a tree  
I shouldve never let it I shouldve never let it start  
  
Deep end I guess Im going off the deep end  
Its only cause youve got a hand to lend  
Im still in love with you  
  
Crap shoot Youve got the snake eyes and lizard boots  
I like you better in your birthday suit yeah  
Im in love with you  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X  
Hands off I shot another leaded star
