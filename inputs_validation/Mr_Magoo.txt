Got a flat in Timbuktu  
Waiting for AAA  
And I saw that single headlight through the rain  
Flagged the geezer in the car down  
He was going the wrong way  
We sped away and left rubber on all four lanes  
He pulled a quick youturn  
And hit a pickup from Montana  
While plowin down a fire hydrant too  
Windshield wipers slappin time  
As he committed several traffic crimes  
This mans like a one man wreckin crew  
Speedins just a little bit of what he put me through  
He went off the road and hit a tree  
Yeah drivin cant be easy when youre 4 foot 2  
Drivins not that difficult to do  
But its difficult to do if youre Mr Magoo  
When we drove right through a coal mine  
And hit a school bus filled with nuns  
We dragged along a string of traffic poles  
Through all kinds of weather  
Through eighteen hit and runs  
I still love that baby  
Kept us on the run  
One day he lost his specs  
Oh lord He let em slip away  
Still lookin for them glasses  
I hope he finds them  
Well Id trade all of my tomorrows for some Dramamine today  
I just hope they know which body bag is mine  
Speedins just a little bit of what he put me through  
His drivin you know it scared the pee right out of me yeah  
He s swervin and hes weaving and he doesnt have a clue  
You know divans not that difficult to do  
But its difficult to do if youre Mr Magoo  
Oh lucky for us I know a little used shortcut  
Oh look out oh look out  
Oh look out oh look out  
Oh look out watch out now  
Mr Magoo
