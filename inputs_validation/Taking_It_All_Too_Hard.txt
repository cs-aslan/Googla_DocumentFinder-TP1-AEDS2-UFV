No not this confused again  
No not the same mistakes again  
Youre taking it all to heart  
Youre taking it all too hard  
  
Why cant you see whats going on  
I know youd never admit  
You would ever be to blame  
Everythings a game to you  
The old days are gone  
And theyre better left alone  
I cannot help you its much too late  
  
No not this confused again  
No not the same mistakes again  
Youre taking it all to heart  
Youre taking it all too hard  
  
Theres always a reason why it happened  
You never never did anything wrong but it  
It just happened to fall apart  
Youre taking it all too hard  
  
Now that its dark all of your fears  
Like shadows creeping around  
Youre much too scared to look down  
And its lonely out on your own  
  
The old days are gone  
And theyre better left alone  
But I still miss you  
I keep it to myself  
  
Oh no not this confused again  
Oh no not the same mistakes again  
Youre taking it all to heart  
Youre taking it all too hard  
  
Oh no not this confused again  
Oh no not the same mistakes again  
Youre taking it all to heart  
Youre taking it all too hard  
Youre taking it all to heart  
Youre taking it all too hard
