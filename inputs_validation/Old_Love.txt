I can feel your body  
When Im lying in bed  
Theres too much confusion  
Going around through my head  
  
And it makes me so angry  
To know that the flame still burns  
Why cant I get over  
When will I ever learn  
  
Chorus  
Old love leave me alone  
Old love go on home  
  
I can see your face  
But I know that its not real  
Its just an illusion  
Caused by how I used to feel  
  
And it makes me so angry  
To know that the flame will always burn  
Ill never get over  
I know now that Ill never learn  
  
Chorus
