You know what I mean  
Its like walking in the heat all day with no water  
Its like waiting for a friend  
Watching everybody else meet theirs on that corner  
Or losing in an argument  
Although youre right cant get your thoughts in order  
  
Still I refrain  
From talking at you talking on  
You know me well  
I dont explain  
  
But why the hell  
Why do you think I come round here on my free will  
Wasting all my precious time  
Oh the truth spills out  
And oooooo oh Ive  
Ive told you now  
  
You know what I mean  
Although I try my best I still let down the team  
Youre everything I want  
Why should I resist when you are there for me  
  
Should I refrain  
From talking at you talking on  
You know me well  
I dont explain  
  
But why the hell  
Why do you think I come round here on my free will  
Wasting all my precious time  
Oh the truth spills out  
And oooooo oh Ive  
Ive told you now  
  
Ive told you now  
And Ive told you now  
And Ive told you now  
  
Still I refrain  
From talking at you talking on  
You know me well  
I dont explain  
  
So why the hell  
Why do you think I come round here on my free will  
Wasting all my precious time  
Why the hell  
Why do you think I come round here on my own will  
Wasting all my precious time  
Oh the truth spills out  
And oooooo oh Ive  
Ive told you now
