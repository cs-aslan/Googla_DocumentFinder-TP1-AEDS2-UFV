Getting a little erratic here  
And I dont know who to trust  
I guess they got a way of reading my mind  
I guess I gotta adjust  
Got my arms they flip flop flip flop flip  
Got my head on a spring  
Well I thought I got you on my side  
I havent got fucking anything  
  
Im just a face in the crowd  
Nothing to worry about  
Not even tryin to stand out  
  
Im getting smaller  
And smaller and smaller  
And I have nothing to say  
Its only taken away  
I just behave and obey  
Im afraid that Im starting to fade away  
  
I cannot see through the cracks  
When Im pressed up on the wall  
Im not looking to stand up real high  
Id be happy to crawl  
I think Im losing my grip  
But I can still make a fist  
You know I still got my one good arm  
That I can beat  
Oh that I can beat myself with up with  
  
Im just a face in the crowd  
Nothing to worry about  
Not even tryin to stand out  
  
Im getting smaller  
And smaller and smaller  
And I have nothing to say  
Its only taken away  
I just behave and obey  
Im afraid I am starting to fade away  
  
And for what it is worth  
I really used to believe  
Maybe theirs some great thing  
That we could achieve  
And now I cant tell the difference  
Dont know what to feel  
Between what Ive been trying to hard to see  
And what appears to be real  
  
Fading away  
Fading away  
Fading away  
Fading away
