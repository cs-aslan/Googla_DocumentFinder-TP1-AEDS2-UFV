You gave me courage to believe  
That all Your Goodness I could see  
Cause if it had not been for You  
Standing on my side  
Where would I be  
  
Chorus  
If not for Your Goodness  
If not for Your Grace  
I dont know where I would be today  
If not for Your Kindness  
I never could say Im still standing  
If not for Your Mercy  
If not for Your Love  
I most likely would have given up  
If not for Your Favor  
I never could say Im still standing  
But by the Grace of God  
  
To You I lift my offering  
And set my heart on higher things  
Cause if it had not been for You  
Standing on my side  
Where would I be  
  
On Christ The Solid Rock Ill Stand  
All other ground is sinking sand  
On Christ The Solid Rock Ill Stand  
But by the Grace of God  
  
Im still standing Im still standing  
Im still standing  
But by the Grace  
But by the Grace of God
