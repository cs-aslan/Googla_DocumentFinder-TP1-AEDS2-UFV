And Im talking bout like Mase come back again

More bigger then Jiggas and even Paris Hiltons

Now Biggie Smalls is not the type to fall in love  
When I just hit em and forget em and go handle my business  
I like the kind who wine and dine who grinding all the time  
Your X girl was a 5 but you not let up on a dime  
What is this with you All you wannah do is lay around  
And stay around and get mad when I play around  
I like to lay never work put your money in my purse  
To the mall Ill go search matching shoes for my skirt  
Tuesday I saw you in a Z but you still wannah get with me  
Wednesday is the Benz day thats what your friends say  
Me and my friends got your Benz  
Attracting mens and spending dividence blowing like the wind  
Damn Ma I love you like a lot

The ultimate rush the drugs baby  
Damn Ma I love you like a lot

So I guess you think Im slipping cause I aint flipping  
Baby Im Big Poppa aint no need to be tripping  
I aint tripping or flipping Im just niggah sipping  
At the bar tipping with your money can you pay the difference  
It seems like its a waste of time thats why I wrote the rhyme  
I hear you jumping in every car except for mine  
Niggah I dont jump in cars Im a superstar  
Face way too flaw You should hang me on your wall  
All I do all day is drink Tanguray  
Thinking of a way to put a smile on your face  
Make me smile see them teeth Milo cut down to them feets  
Chubby waste my physique me dont want a freak a leek  
Should I wine and dine and put rings on your fingers  
While sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers  
Sex will never linger hold up put on your blinkers  
I flow just like sprinklers give your ass the middle finger  
Youd better slow your role baby  
You aint got enough dough to pay me  
You know the pen number just page me  
When youre real baby  
Damn Ma I love you like a lot  
Gonja sensamelia can I feel ya  
All I wannah do is touch ya  
The ultimate rush the drugs baby  
Damn Ma I love you like a lot  
Gonja sensamelia can I feel ya  
All I wannah do is touch ya  
The ultimate rush the drugs baby
