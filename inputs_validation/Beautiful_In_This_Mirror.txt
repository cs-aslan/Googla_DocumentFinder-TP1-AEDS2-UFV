La la la la la  
We are beautiful in this mirror  
We are beautiful in this mirror  
  
The most incredible vision  
The most miraculous sight  
By far prettiest position  
Reflection in my eye  
Wish I could seize this moment  
Then I would post  
Girl I would frame this picture  
And keep it by my side yeah  
  
Cause we look so good  
Were going so hard  
Were not gonna stop not gonna stop  
Just look at you  
This side view  
Do you know what we are  
  
We are beautiful in this mirror  
We are beautiful in this mirror  
  
Youre so beautiful  
  
Its like watching a movie  
Except that its for real so real  
Its only right to call this  
Lovemaking fairytale yeah  
Cause I have never seen  
Or witness quite a show  
Your love so 3D  
Its like Im in the front row  
  
Cause we look so good  
Were going so hard were not gonna stop  
Just look at you  
This side view  
Do you know who we are  
  
We are beautiful in this mirror  
We are beautiful in this mirror  
  
Youre so beautiful  
  
Baby this is good for us  
In this mirror making love  
This aint dirty this aint nuts  
Scene from heaven above us  
 under discover  
Im so glad I discovered  
Sweet lovemaking treasure  
Canvas needs a painter  
  
We are beautiful in this mirror  
We are beautiful in this mirror
