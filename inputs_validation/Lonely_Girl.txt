I can remember the very first time I cried  
How I wiped my eyes and buried the pain inside  
All of my memories  good and bad  thats past  
Didnt even take the time to realize  
  
Starin at the cracks in the walls  
cause Im waiting for it all to come to an end  
Still I curl up right under the bed  
cause its takin over my head all over again  
  
Do you even know who you are  
I guess Im tryin to find  
A borrowed dream or a superstar  
I want to be a star  
Is life good to you or is it bad  
I cant tell anymore  
Do you even know what you have  
  
Lyin awake watchin the sunlight  
How the birds will sing as I count the rings  
Around my eyes  
Constantly pushing the world I know aside  
I dont even feel the pain I dont even want to  
Try  
  
Im lookin for a way to become  
The person that I dreamt of when I was sixteen  
Oh nothin is ever enough  
Ooh baby it aint enough for what it may seem  
  
Do you even know who you are  
Im still tryin to find  
A borrowed dream or a superstar  
Everybody wants to be  
Is life good to you or is it bad  
I cant tell anymore  
Do you even know what you have  
No  
  
Sorry girl tell a tale for me  
cause Im wondering how you really feel  
Im a lonely girl Ill tell a tale for you  
cause Im just tryin to make all my dreams come  
True  
  
Do you even know who you are  
Oh yeah yeah  
A borrowed dream or a superstar  
Oh I wanted to be a star  
Is life good to you or is it bad  
I cant tell I cant tell anymore  
Do you even know what you have  
I guess not oh I guess not  
  
Do you even know who you are  
Oh Im tryin to find  
A rising dream or a superstar  
Oh I have a all these dreams  
Is life good to you or is it bad  
I cant tell anymore  
Do you even know what you have  
No no  
Do you even know what you are  
A rising dream or a fallen star  
Is life good to you or is it bad
