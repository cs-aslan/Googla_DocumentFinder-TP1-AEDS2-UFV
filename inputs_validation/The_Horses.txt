We will fly way on high  
Where the cool winds blow  
Or in the sun laughing having fun  
With all the people we know  
If the situation should keep us separated  
I know the world wont fall apart  
You will free the beautiful bird  
Caught inside your heart  
  
Can you see her oh she flies so proud  
Cast her wild wings over water and cloud  
  
Thats the way its gonna be little darling  
Well go riding on the horses  
Way up in the sky little darling  
If you fall Ill pick you up pick you up  
  
You will grow until you go  
Ill be right there by your side  
Even then a whispering wind  
Will call me to you in the night  
I hear all the people of the world  
In my one birds cry  
I see them trying every way they know  
To make their spirits fly  
  
Can you see her moonlight in her eye  
Coming from under my wing  
You were born to fly  
  
Thats the way its gonna be little darling  
Well go riding on the horses  
Way up in the sky little darling  
If you fall Ill pick you up pick you up
