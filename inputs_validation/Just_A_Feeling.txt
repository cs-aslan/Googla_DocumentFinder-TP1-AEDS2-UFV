I watched you cry  
Bathed in sunlight  
By the bathroom door  
You said you wished you did not love me anymore  
  
You left your flowers in the backseat of my car  
The things we said and did have left permanent scars  
Obsessed depressed at the same time  
I cant even walk in a straight line  
Ive been lying in the dark no sunshine  
No sunshine  
No sunshine  
  
She cries  
This is more than goodbye  
When I look into your eyes  
Youre not even there  
Its just a feeling  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Oh yeah  
  
I cant believe that its over  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Youve hit your low  
Youve lost control and you want me back  
You may not believe me but I gave you all I have  
Oh just confess that youre still mine  
I roll around in a bed full of tears and  
Im still lying in the dark no sunshine  
No sunshine  
No sunshine  
  
She cries this is more than goodbye  
When I look into your eyes youre not even there  
  
Its just a feeling  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
  
No I cant believe that its over now baby  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
So much to say  
Its not the way she does her hair  
Its the way she seems to stare right through my eyes  
And in my darkest day when she refused to run away  
The love she tried so hard to save  
  
Its just a feeling  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
  
Its just a feeling  
Its just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
  
I cant believe that its over  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
I cant believe that its over  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
I cant believe that its over yeah
