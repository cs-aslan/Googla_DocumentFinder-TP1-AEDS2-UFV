Ho ho ho  
  
Shake up the happiness  
Wake up the happiness  
Shake up the happiness  
Its Christmas time  
  
There was a story that I was told  
And I want to tell the world before I get too old  
And dont remember it so lets December it  
And reassemble it oh yeah  
  
Once upon a time in a town like this  
A little girl made a great big wish  
To fill the world full of happiness  
And be on Santas magic list  
  
Shake it up shake up the happiness  
Wake it up wake up the happiness  
Come on all its Christmas time  
Shake it up shake up the happiness  
Wake it up wake up the happiness  
Come on all its Christmas time  
Ho ho ho  
Ho ho ho  
Its Christmas time  
  
At the same town miles away  
A little boy made a wish that day  
That the world would be okay  
And Santa Clause would hear him say  
I got dreams and I got love  
I got my feet on the ground and family above  
Can you send some happiness with my best  
To the rest of the people of east and the west  
  
And maybe every once in a while  
You give my a grandma a reason to smile  
Tis the season to smile  
Its cold but well be freezing in style  
  
And let me meet a girl one day  
That wants to spread some love this way  
We can let our souls run free  
And she can open some happiness with me  
  
Shake it up shake up the happiness  
Wake it up wake up the happiness  
Come on all its Christmas time  
Shake it up shake up the happiness  
Wake it up wake up the happiness  
Come on all its Christmas time  
  
I know youre out there  
I hear your reindeer  
I see the snow wear  
Your boots have been  
  
Im gonna show them  
So they will know then  
Then love will grow in  
They believe again  
  
Shake it up shake it up shake up the happiness  
Wake it up wake up the happiness  
Come on all its Christmas time  
Shake it up shake up the happiness  
Wake it up wake up the happiness  
Come on all its Christmas time  
Ho ho ho  
Ho ho ho  
Its Christmas time  
  
Shake it up shake up the happiness  
Wake it up wake up the happiness  
Come on all its Christmas time  
Shake it up shake up the happiness  
Wake it up wake up the happiness  
Come on all its Christmas time  
  
Ho ho ho  
Ho ho ho  
Ho ho ho
