Well it aint hard to see youve got the blues  
Come hold on to me and Ill comfort you  
A pretty little angel with a heavy heart  
Well tryin to carry on is the hardest part  
  
Love will fool ya itll do you wrong  
Shout hallelujah when the clouds are gone  
Cause you know pretty baby the suns gonna shine on you  
The suns gonna shine on you  
  
I miss that little sparkle on your face  
That pretty little smile that has been replaced  
Have a little faith baby just be still  
Cause things are gonna be just the way they will  
  
Love will fool ya itll do you wrong  
Shout hallelujah when the clouds are gone  
Cause you know pretty baby when you aint lookin  
The suns gonna shine on you  
The suns gonna shine on you  
  
Love will fool ya itll do you wrong  
Shout hallelujah when the clouds are gone  
Cause you know pretty baby when you aint lookin  
And you aint ready the suns gonna shine on you  
The suns gonna shine on you
