Lovers keep on the road youre on  
Runners until the race is run  
Soldiers youve got to soldier on  
Sometimes even right is wrong  
  
They are turning my head out  
To see what Im all about  
Keeping my head down  
To see what it feels like now  
But I have no doubt  
One day we are gonna get out  
  
Tonight maybe were gonna run  
Dreaming of the Osaka sun  
Ohh ohh  
Dreaming of when the morning comes  
  
They are turning my head out  
To see what Im all about  
Keeping my head down  
To see what it feels like now  
But I have no doubt  
One day the sun will come out
