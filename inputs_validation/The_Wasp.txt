I wanna tell you bout texas radio and the big beat  
Comes out of the virginia swamps  
Cool and slow with plenty of precision  
With a back beat narrow and hard to master  
  
Some call it heavenly in its brilliance  
Others mean and ruthful of the western dream  
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft  
We have constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping  
This is the land where the pharaoh died  
  
The negroes in the forest brightly feathered  
They are saying forget the night  
Live with us in forests of azure  
Out here on the perimeter there are no stars  
Out here we is stoned  immaculate   
  
Listen to this and ill tell you bout the heartache  
Ill tell you bout the heartache and the lose of god  
Ill tell you bout the hopeless night  
The meager food for souls forgot  
Ill tell you bout the maiden with raw iron soul  
  
Ill tell you this  
No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn  
  
Ill tell you bout texas radio and the big beat  
Soft drivin slow and mad like some new language  
  
Now listen to this and ill tell you bout the texas  
Ill tell you bout the texas radio  
Ill tell you bout the hopeless night  
Wandering the western dream  
Tell you bout the maiden with raw iron soul
