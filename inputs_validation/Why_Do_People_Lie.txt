Why do people lie  
Lying only breaks their hearts  
And tears their lives apart  
Making them cry  
Tell me why  
  
Even if I try  
Even if I lie to little babe  
I know shell never leave me  
Shell stay by my side  
  
Tell me why do the people say  
She aint loving you anyway  
So while you keep believing it brother  
Shell keep making her time  
Right before your eyes  
Tell me why they gotta lie  
  
Chorus x2  
When I looked I had to look again  
In my eyes a revelation  
In her arms the fascination  
Of a friend  
  
Now I let them know  
When people say I told you so  
I say learning dont come easy baby  
Ive been making like a fool  
  
Tell me why  
Why is it true  
Why  
Tell me why do people lie  
  
Tell me why  
Why do they lie  
Oh why do they lie  
Tell me tell me why  
  
Why do people lie to me  
Somebody here is lying to me  
I just dont know whether to believe them  
Whether to give them an account  
To form a doubt dont want to be counted out  
  
Follow your heart babe  
Follow your heart yeah  
Follow your heart right on  
Follow your heart
