It was one fine March morning I bid New Orleans Adieu  
And I took the road to Jackson Town my fortune to renew  
I cursed all foreign money no credit could I gain  
Which filled my heart with a longing for the Lakes of Ponchartrain  
  
I stepped on board of a railroad car beneath the morning sun  
I rode the rods till evening and I laid me down again  
All strangers there no friends to me til a dark girl towards me came  
And I fell in love with the Creole Girl by the Lakes of Ponchartrain  
  
I said Me pretty Creole Girl me money heres no good  
If it werent for the alligators Id sleep out there in the wood  
Youre welcome here kind stranger Our house is very plain  
But we never turned a stranger out by the Lakes of Ponchartrain  
  
She took me into her mammys house and treated me right well  
The hair upon her shoulders in jet black ringlets fell  
To try and paint here beauty Im sure twould be in vain  
So handsome was my Creole girl by the Lakes of Ponchartrain  
  
I asked her if shed marry me she said that neer could be  
For she had got a lover and he was far at sea  
She said that she would wait for him and true she would remain  
Till hed return to his Creole girl on the Lakes of Ponchartrain  
  
Its fare thee well me Creole girl Ill never see you more  
Ill never forget your kindness in the cottage by the shore  
And at each social gathering a flowing bowl Ill drain  
And Ill drink a health to my Creole girl by the Lakes of Ponchartrain
