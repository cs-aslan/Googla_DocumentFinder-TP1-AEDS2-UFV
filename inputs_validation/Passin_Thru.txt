Its a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is were only passin thru  
  
I have stood up on the mountain  
I have seen the other side  
I have wrestled with the devil  
I have wrestled with my pride  
  
I have been down in the valley  
Stood out in the rain  
I have seen my love forsaken  
Felt the pleasure and the pain  
  
If theres one thing thats for certain  
Yes one chord that rings true  
Its a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is were only passin thru  
  
I have cried in tears of sadness  
Cried in tears of joy  
I have found a life worth livin  
From the peace within the noise  
  
I have turned my back on hatred  
Lyin prejudice and greed  
Found the future in the present  
Found hope within a seed  
  
If theres one thing thats for certain  
Theres one chord that rings true  
Its a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is were only passin thru  
  
Passin thru passin thru  
Its a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is were only passin thru  
  
I have seen my bucket empty  
Seen my well run dry  
But theres water down the road  
And Im only goin by  
  
If Im settin on dead ready  
When my chances come to knock  
Ill make it where Im going  
Standin tall just like a rock  
  
If theres one thing thats for certain  
Theres one chord that rings true  
Its a wicked world we live in  
But the truth is were only passin thru  
  
Passin thru passin thru  
Its a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is were only passin thru  
Yeah its a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is were only passin thru  
  
I have stood up on the mountain  
I have seen the other side  
I have wrestled with the devil  
I have wrestled with my pride  
  
I have been down in the valley  
I have stood out in the rain  
I have seen my love forsaken  
Felt the pleasure and the pain  
  
I have cried in tears of sadness  
I have cried in tears of joy  
I have found a life worth livin  
From the peace within the noise  
  
I have turned my back on hatred  
Lyin prejudice and greed  
Found the future in the present  
Found hope within a seed

Passin thru passin thru  
Its a mighty world we live in
