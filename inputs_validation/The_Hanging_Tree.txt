Passing through the arms of Satan  
Reaching for the hands of God  
Robbing every mind for wisdom  
Running so he wont get caught  
Hes outlawed by majority  
Been branded all his life  
Some say that hes a sinner man  
As he rides from day to night  
  
Hes a bad man so they say  
Living for his love and living free  
Riding swift and secretly  
So hell miss the hanging tree  
Wounded spirit on the wind  
Riding to his dream and destiny  
  
Hes laughing at the wanted posters  
Calling for his friends to see  
Laughing aloud as he rides away  
Kicking up the dust with speed  
Time hands him down a pathway  
And freedom is a horse he rides  
Glory is a dream hes after  
And fortune is his hearts delight  
  
Riding swift and secretly  
So hell miss the hanging tree  
Wounded spirit on the wind  
Riding to his dream and destiny
