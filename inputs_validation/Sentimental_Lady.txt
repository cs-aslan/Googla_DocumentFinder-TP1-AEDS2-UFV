You are here and warm  
But I could look away and youd be gone  
Cause we live in a time  
  
When meaning falls in splinters from our minds  
And thats why Ive traveled far  
Cause I come so together where you are  
  
And all of the things that I said that I wanted  
Come rushing by in my head when Im with you  
Fourteen joys and a will to be married  
All of the things that you say are very  
  
Sentimental gentle wind blowin through my life again  
Sentimental lady gentle one  
Sentimental gentle wind blowin through my life again  
Sentimental lady gentle one  
  
Now you are here today  
But easily you might just slip away  
  
Cause we live in a time  
When paintings have no color words dont rhyme  
And thats why Ive traveled far  
Cause I come so together where you are  
  
And all of the things that I said that I wanted  
Come rushing by in my head when Im with you  
Fourteen joys and a will to be married  
All of the things that you say are very  
  
Sentimental gentle wind blowin through my life again  
Sentimental lady gentle one  
Sentimental gentle wind blowin through my life again  
Sentimental lady gentle one  
  
You are here and warm  
But I could look away and youd be gone  
  
Cause we live in a time  
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives  
And thats why Ive traveled far  
Cause I come so together where you are  
  
Yes and all of the things that I said that I wanted  
Come rushing by in my head when Im with you  
Fourteen joys and a will to be married  
All of the things that you say are very  
  
Sentimental gentle wind blowin through my life again  
Sentimental lady gentle one  
Sentimental gentle wind blowin through my life again  
Sentimental lady gentle one
