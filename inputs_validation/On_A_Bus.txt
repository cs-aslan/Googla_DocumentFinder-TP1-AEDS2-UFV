Liquor market  
Lots of flats  
Another 24hour chemist  
SelfServe gas  
I said all these things  
Serve me well  
I said all these things  
Serve me well yeah  
  
Its hypnotizing  
It sends me to sleep  
No one talks to anyone else  
Its frightening  
Everybodys minds are blank  
Oh  oh hypnotizing  
  
Im always using you  
When Im out of cash  
I stare through this window  
On a bus moving fast  
I said all these things  
Serve me well  
I said all these things  
Serve me well  yeah
