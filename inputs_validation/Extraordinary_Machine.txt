I certainly havent been shopping for any new shoes  
And I certainly havent been spreading myself around  
I still only travel by foot and by foot its a slow climb  
But Im good at being uncomfortable  
So I cant stop changing all the time  
  
I noticed that my opponent is always on the go  
And wont go slow so as not to focus and I notice  
Youre trying with any guy as long as they go fast  
From whence he came  
But hes no good at being uncomfortable  
So he cant staying exactly the same  
  
If there was a better way to go then it would find me  
I cant help it the road just rolls out behind me  
Be kind to me or treat me mean  
Ill make the most of it  
Im an extraordinary machine  
  
I sing to you to seek a new disaster every day  
You deem me duped to clean my view and be at peace and lay  
Im in the loop Im into moving my own way  
And say Ive been getting along for long before you came into the play  
I am the baby of the family it happened so  
Everybody came and wears the sheeps clothes while they chaperone  
Curious youre looking down your nose at me while you appease  
Courteous to try and help but let me set your mind at ease  
  
If there was a better way to go then it would find me  
I cant help it the road just rolls out behind me  
Be kind to me or treat me mean  
Ill make the most of it  
Im an extraordinary machine  
  
Do I so worry you  
No need to hurry to my side  
Thats very kind  
But its to no avail  
I dont want the veil  
Everything will be just fine  
  
If there was a better way to go then it would find me  
I cant help it the road just rolls out behind me  
Be kind to me or treat me mean  
Ill make the most of it  
Im an extraordinary machine  
  
If there was a better way to go then it would find me  
I cant help it the road just rolls out behind me  
Be kind to me or treat me mean  
Ill make the most of it  
Im an extraordinary machine
