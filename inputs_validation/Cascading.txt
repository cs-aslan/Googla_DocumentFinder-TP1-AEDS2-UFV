Cascading  
Tumbling tumbling  
Falling falling down  
Cascading  
Tumbling tumbling  
Falling falling down  
Hair  
On my shoulders bare  
Its there  
To extend the soul  
Its long  
To cage it would be wrong  
Like my Mothers song  
Gently unfolds  
Cascading  
Tumbling tumbling  
Falling falling down  
Cascading  
Tumbling tumbling  
Falling falling down  
Stream  
Careless and serene  
It flows between the boulders  
Its cool  
Angel on a stool  
Drops on her shoulders  
Cascading  
Tumbling tumbling  
Falling falling down  
Cascading cascading  
Tumbling tumbling  
Falling falling down  
Wish I could fall  
Like a babys sleep  
When a baby dreams  
What a baby feels  
Run away from this place  
With its big old words  
And big ideals  
Its big ideals  
Now you  
Look what you have done  
Youve come  
And crossed the border  
Oh no  
What do I do now  
Guess Ill jump  
Into your water  
Cascading  
Tumbling tumbling  
Falling falling down  
Cascading cascading  
Tumbling tumbling  
Falling falling falling down  
Falling down  
Falling down  
Falling down
