The silent fall of evening snow  
Another thing you cant control  
Does it chill or warm you soul tonight  
Youve become a mystery  
Will I earn your honesty  
Ill never know if we agree  
If youre not here  
And we travel separate roads  
And we carry different loads  
And in the end we stay or go  
The long goodbye continues on  
Through fog and rain and far beyond  
You stay awhile and then youre gone again  
I look into your restless eyes  
You turn away its no surprise  
I wonder if its even wise but Im still here
