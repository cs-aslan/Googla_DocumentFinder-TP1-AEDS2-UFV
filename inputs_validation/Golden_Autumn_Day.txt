Well I heard the bells ringing I was thinking about winning  
In this God forsaken place  
When my confidence was well then I tripped and I felt  
Right flat on my face  
Now Im standing erect and I feel like coming back  
And the sun is shining gold  
Put a smile on my face get back in the human race  
And get on with the show  
  
And Im taking in the Indian Summer  
And Im soaking it up in my mind  
And Im pretending that its paradise  
On a golden autumn day on a golden autumn day  
On a golden autumn day an a golden autumn day  
  
In the wee midnight hour I was parking my car  
In this dimly lit town  
I was attacked by two thugs who took me for a mug  
And shoved me down on the ground  
And they pulled out a knife and I fought my way up  
As they scarpered from the scene  
Well this is no New York street and theres no Bobby on the beat  
And things aint just what they seem  
  
And Im taking in the Indian Summer  
And Im soaking it up in my mind  
And Im pretending that its paradise  
On a golden autumn day on a golden autumn day  
On a golden autumn day an a golden autumn day  
  
Who would think this could happen in a city like this  
Among Blakes green and pleasant hills  
And we must remember as we go through September  
Among these dark satanic mills  
If theres such a thing as justice I could take them out and flog them  
In the nearest green field  
And it might be a lesson to the bleeders of the system  
In this whole society  
  
And Im taking in the Indian Summer  
And Im soaking it up in my mind  
And Im pretending like its paradise  
On a golden autumn day on a golden autumn day  
On a golden autumn day on a golden autumn day golden autumn day
