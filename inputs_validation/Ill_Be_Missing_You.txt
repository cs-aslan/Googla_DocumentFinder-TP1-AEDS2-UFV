Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show  
I lace the track you lock the flow  
So far from hanging on the block of dough  
Notorious they got to know that  
Life aint always what it seem to be  
Words cant express what you mean to me  
And though youre gone  
We still a team  
Through your family Ill fulfill your dreams  
In the future cant wait to see  
If youll open up the gates for me  
Reminisce sometime  
The night they took my friend  
Try to black it out but it plays again  
When its weird feelin its really hard to conceal  
Cant imagine all the pain I feel  
Give everything to hear half your breath  
I know you still livin your life after death  
  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every time I pray  
Ill be missing you  
  
Thinking of the day  
When you went away  
What a life to take  
What a bond to break  
Ill be missing you  
  
Its kind of hard wit you not around  
Know you in heaven smilin down  
Watchin us while we pray for you  
Everyday we pray for you  
Till the day we meet again  
In my heart is where Ill keep you friend  
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed  
Strength I need to believe  
My thoughts big I just cant define  
Wish I could turn back the hands of time  
Bust in the 6  
Shop for new clothes and kicks  
You and me taking flicks  
Making hits stages they receive you on  
Still cant believe youre gone  
Give anything to hear half your breath  
I know you still livin your life after death  
  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every time I pray  
Ill be missing you  
  
Thinking of the day  
When you went away  
What a life to take  
What a bond to break  
Ill be missing you  
  
Somebody tell me why  
On that morning  
When this life is over  
I know  
Ill see your face  
  
Every night I pray  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every night I pray  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every time I pray  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every night I pray  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every time I pray  
  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every time I pray  
Ill be missing you  
  
Thinking of the day  
When you went away  
What a life to take  
What a bond to break  
Ill be missing you  
  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every time I pray  
Ill be missing you  
  
Thinking of the day  
When you went away  
What a life to take  
What a bond to break  
Ill be missing you  
  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every time I pray  
Ill be missing you  
  
Thinking of the day  
When you went away
