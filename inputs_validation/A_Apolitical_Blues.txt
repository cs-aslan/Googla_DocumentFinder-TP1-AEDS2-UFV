Well my telephone was ringing and  
They told me it was Chairman Mao  
Well my telephone was ringing and  
They told me it was Chairman Mao  
You got to tell him anything cause  
I just dont want to talk to him now  
I have a apolitical blues and  
Its the meanest blues of all  
I have a apolitical blues and  
Its the meanest blues of all  
I dont care if youre John Wayne  
I just dont want to take no calls  
No calls
