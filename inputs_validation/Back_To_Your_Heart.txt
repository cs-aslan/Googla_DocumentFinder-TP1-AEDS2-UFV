ts not that I cant live without you  
Its just that I dont even want to try  
Every night I dream about you  
Ever since the day we said goodbye  
If I wasnt such a fool  
Right now Id be holding you  
Theres nothin that I wouldnt do  
Baby if I only knew  
  
Chorus  
The words to say  
The road to take  
To find a way back to your heart  
What can I do  
To get to you  
And find a way back to your heart  
  
I dont know how it got so crazy  
But Ill do anything to set things right  
Cause your love is so amazing  
Baby youre the best thing in my life  
Let me prove my love is real  
And made you feel the way I feel  
I promise I would give the world  
If only you would tell me girl  
  
Chorus  
  
Give me one more chance to give my love to you  
Cause no one on this earth loves you like I do  
tell me  
  
Chorus  
  
I turn back time  
To make you mine  
And find a way back to your heart  
I beg and plead  
Fall to my knees  
To find a way back to your heart  
  
Chorus
