And I love this water  
And I love these waves  
And I love to watch the palm trees  
How they dance and sway  
  
The coolers full  
And the sky is clear  
The cool breeze blows  
And all my friends are here  
  
And I dont wanna be in this boat alone  
When the partys over  
And my friends all gotta get home  
I wanna wave goodbye  
Untie and drift back off holdin on  
To somebody hangin on to me  
Oh I dont wanna be in this boat alone  
  
They leave tomorrow  
As soon as they do  
Ill pull up anchor  
And fly back too  
  
Oh but one of these days  
Im gonna hang around  
And find the right someone  
Yeah Im gonna anchor down  
  
But I dont wanna be in this boat alone  
When the partys over  
And my friends all gotta get home  
I wanna wave goodbye  
Untie and drift back off holdin on  
To somebody hangin on to me  
Oh I dont wanna be in this boat alone  
  
I see myself  
In twenty years  
Just lovin life  
Floatin round out here  
  
But I dont wanna be in this boat alone  
When the partys over  
And my friends all gotta get home  
I wanna wave goodbye  
And tie and drift back off holdin on  
To somebody hangin on to me  
Oh I dont wanna be in this boat alone  
  
In this boat alone
