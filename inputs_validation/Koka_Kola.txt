Elevator Going up  
In the gleaming corridors of the 51st floor  
The money can be made if you really want some more  
Executive decisiona clinical precision  
Jumping from the windowsfilled with indecision  
  
I get good advice from the advertising world  
Treat me nice says the party girl  
Koke adds life where there isnt any  
So freeze man freeze  
  
Its the pause that refreshes in the corridors of power  
When top men need a top up long before the happy hour  
Your snakeskin suit and your alligator boot  
You wont need a launderette you can send them to the vet  
  
I get my advice from the advertising world  
Treat me nice says the party girl  
Koke adds life where there isnt any  
So freeze man freeze  
  
Koka Kola advertising and kokaine  
Strolling down the Broadway in the rain  
Neon light sign says it  
I read it in the papertheyre crazy  
Suit your life maybe so  
In the White HouseI know  
All Over Berlin theyve been doing it for years  
And in Manhattan  
  
Coming through the door is a snub nose forty four  
What the barrel cant snort it can spatter on the floor  
Your eyeballs feel like pinballs  
And your tongue feels like a fish  
Youre leaping from the windowssaying dont  
Ayaiiiiirrrghhh  
Dont give me none of this  
  
I get good advice from the advertising world  
Treat me nice says the party girl  
Koke adds life where there isnt any  
So freeze man freeze  
Hit the deck
