Without you I no longer swim upstream  
Where are you when I try to fill the spaces in between  
The red letter days and all the pain  
And while I remain shipwrecked everything has changed  
And I fall apart  
With this threat of indecision hanging in my heart  
This house can get so lonely when the day grows dark  
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart  
Cant you tell the shadows no longer comfort me  
I dont feel the need to cling to anyone I see  
This fools suffered gladly each and every day  
I dont wish to reconsider I wish theyd stay away  
And I fall apart  
With this threat of indecision hanging in my heart  
This house can get so lonely when the day grows dark  
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart  
Ive no care to count the stares that pity me  
Ill wash your hurt away just you wait and see  
For every rose you give her Ill give you three  
But in the meantime Ill just wish that she was me  
Oh I fall apart  
With this threat of indecision hanging in my heart  
This house can get so lonely oh when the day grows dark  
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart  
I fall apart oh I fall apart  
This house can get so lonely oh when the day grows dark  
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart  
Oh I fall apart  
Oh I get so lonely oh when the day grows dark  
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart  
With this threat of indecision hanging in my heart  
This house can get so lonely oh when the day grows dark
