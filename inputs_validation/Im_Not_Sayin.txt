Im not sayin that I love you  
Im not sayin that Ill care if you love me  
Im not sayin that Ill care  
Im not sayin Ill be there when you want me  
  
I cant give my heart to you  
Or tell you that Ill sing your name up to the sky  
I cant lay the promise down  
That Ill always be around when you need me  
  
Now I may not be alone each time you see me  
Along the street or in a small cafe  
But still I wont deny or mistreat you  
Baby if you let me have my way  
  
Im not sayin Ill be sorry  
For all the things that I might say that make you cry  
I cant say Ill always do  
The things you want me to  
Im not sayin Ill be true but Ill try  
  
Now I may not be alone each time you see me  
Or show up when I promised that I would  
But still I wont deny or mistreat you  
Baby if you love me like you should  
  
Im not sayin Ill be sorry  
For all the things that I might say that make you cry  
I cant say Ill always do  
The things you want me to  
Im not sayin Ill be true but Ill try  
I cant say Ill always do  
The things you want me to  
Im not sayin Ill be true but Ill try
