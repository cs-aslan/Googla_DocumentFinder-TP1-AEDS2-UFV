Once upon a time there was a girl  
In her early years she had to learn  
How to grow up living in a war that she called home  
Never know just where to turn for shelter from the storm  
Hurt me to see the pain across my mothers face  
Every time my fathers fist would put her in her place  
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room  
Hoping it would be over soon  
  
Chorus  
Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same  
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid  
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave  
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday  
  
And Im OK  
  
I often wonder why I carry all this guilt  
When its you that helped me put up all these walls Ive built  
Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door  
The echo of a broken child screaming please no more  
Daddy dont you understand the damage you have done  
To you its just a memory but for me it still lives on  
  
Chorus  
  
Its not so easy to forget  
All the marks you left along her neck  
When I was thrown against cold stairs  
And every day Im afraid to come home  
In fear of what I might see there  
  
Chorus  
  
And Im OK  
Im OK
