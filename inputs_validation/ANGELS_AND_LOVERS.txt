Theres a whisper on the wind tonight  
It tells me what the angels and lovers said  
This desire  
Is not ordinary  
Love is screaming at you  
  
If the moon should turn red over your head dont let her go  
Just believe its your time here is the sign what angels and lovers find  
  
You find a love like this once in your life  
A diamond in your hand not a piece of glass  
Picture you  
Looking back on what youve  
Done to lose all this time  
  
If the moon should turn red over your head dont let her go  
If the sea should turn dry dont let him fly dont say goodbye  
If the planets collide dont run and hide change his mind  
Just believe its your time here is the sign what angels and lovers find  
  
This desire  
Is not ordinary  
Love is screaming at you  
  
If the moon should turn red over your head dont let her go  
If the sea should turn dry dont let him fly dont say goodbye  
If the planets collide dont run and hide change his mind  
Just believe its your time here is the sign what angels and lovers find
