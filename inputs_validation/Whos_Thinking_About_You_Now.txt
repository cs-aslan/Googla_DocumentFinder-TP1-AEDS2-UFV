Whos thinking about you now  
If you were building a wall who would tear it all down and pull you through  
Whos thinking about you  
Whod care enough to send you flowers that you could call at all hours  
And give your love to  
Somebody must believe if they could see what I see  
If they havent well they will  
Baby they all will  
  
Just when you suspect that life couldnt get harder something comes  
Along and makes your dark day darker  
The weight of it all falls on you  
Who will be the one to listen when its time to listen  
Who will be the one to miss you when you go missing  
Well I do  
Do I qualify qualify qualify qualify qualify  
I want to be the one to help you ignore Mr Loneliness peeking his head  
Into your door  
Im hoping you can feel me  
Im hoping you can give me a new chance chance yes  
Im hoping that you notice how youre blessed  
  
I feel like starting something  
I feel like calling off the day to be with you  
Yeah I believe we all do something thats familiar like a deja vu  
Familiar like a deja vu  
Yeah I know youre smoking I seen your fire I know in love  
Youve been giving it up  
So do I qualify qualify qualify qualify qualify  
  
I want to be the one to help you move from Mr Loneliness living in the  
Kitchen of your home  
Im hoping you can feel me  
Im hoping that I dont run out of breath breath yeah  
  
When our two hands are linked together with an ampersands  
Its my kind of diagram  
When our sore eyes are lined up side by side  
Well Im a happy man  
Yes Im a happy man  
  
Yes maam yes maam yes maam  
I am thinking about you
