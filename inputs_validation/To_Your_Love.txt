Heres another speech you wish Id swallow  
Another cue for you to fold your ears  
Another train of thought too hard to follow  
Chugging along to the song that belongs to  
  
The shifting of gears  
Please forgive me for my distance  
The pain is evident in my existence  
Please forgive me for my distance  
  
The shame is manifest in my resistance  
To your love to your love to your love  
I wouldve warned you but really whats the point  
Caution could but rarely ever helps  
  
Dont be down when my demeanor tends to disappoint  
Its hard enough even trying to be civil to myself  
Please forgive me for my distance  
The pain is evident in my existence  
  
Please forgive me for my distance  
The shame is manifest in my resistance  
To your love to your love to your love  
My derringdo allows me to dance the rigadoon  
  
Around you  
But by the time Im close to you  I lose  
My desideratum and now you so  
Now you have it so baby tell me whats the word  
  
Am I your gal or should I get out of town  
I just need to be reassured  
Do you just deal it out or can you deal with  
What I lay down
