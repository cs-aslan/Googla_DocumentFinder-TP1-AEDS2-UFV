I hear you breathing though  
Youre so far away  
Can you just go where youre  
Going to  
I couldnt give a damn or two  
About a fool like you  
Thats true  
Are you just too cool no  
Youre just perfectly cold  
And what goes around still  
Comes around  
I think its all summed up and  
Down in a fool like you  
Thats true  
Today is just another day  
You hold your ticket into  
Nowhere  
Its up to you if you will stay  
And turn your day into a  
Nightmare  
  
You think you know it you think  
You know it all  
But you dont even have a clue  
And control is still in view for  
A fool like you  
Thats true  
Is there a reason for the way  
That you are  
Or does it just come naturally  
To have an idiosyncrasy and be  
A fool like you  
Thats true  
  
Youre hearing what you want  
To hear  
Misunderstanding all you see  
An attitude in all of us  
Is it really you and me  
  
Hes hiding residing deep within  
The crowd  
A hand out hell pull you down  
  
Youve been found guilty  
Committed every crime  
But still they say you must go  
Free  
Looks like haunted i will be by a fool like you  
Fool like you  
Thats true  
  
By a fool like you by a fool like  
You  
Looks like haunted i will be by a  
Fool like you  
Thats true  
By a fool like you by a fool like  
You  
Looks like you by a fool like  
You  
Looks like haunted i will be by a  
Fool like you  
Thats true
