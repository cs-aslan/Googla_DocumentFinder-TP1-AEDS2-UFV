Im sitting here  
In my own head thinking  
How you could be staring in  
Got my number too  
And Im writing you  
Contemplating on the paper what I should do  
On the fireplace with the mail man  
Should I tell you or should I hold it in  
If my heart wasnt in it  
Baby you could just forget it  
Id be gone in a New York minute  
  
You never give me attention  
I know you never had bad intentions for us  
So Im writing you but I always fail to mention  
Cause you know I really dont like to fuss  
So Im gonna hold it in  
  
Chorus  
Im writing you a Dear John letter  
I tried to stay but it never got better  
I couldnt tell you face to face but I  
I had to let you know  
Sometimes I want to hit the door  
Im writing you Dear John  
Sometimes I think that Ive had enough  
My hands freeze and I cant write fast enough  
I want to get away but I cant obey when my heart speaks  
You know Im listening  
Some days Im really touchy and  
Some days Im willing to forget and  
Some days Im still in love with you  
Some days Im sad and blue  
  
When I dont check myself  
I get frustrated with you  
And I dont know what Im gonna do  
I know that its not just you  
Its some of my negligence too  
And I cant go through with mailing this to you  
  
Chorus x2  
  
When I dont check myself  
I get frustrated with you  
And I dont know what Im gonna do  
I know that its not just you  
Its some of my negligence too  
And I cant go through with mailing this to you  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Im writing this letter  
Because it makes me feel better
