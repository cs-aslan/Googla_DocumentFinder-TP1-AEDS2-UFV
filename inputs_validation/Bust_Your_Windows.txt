I bust the windows out your car  
And it didnt mend my broken heart  
Ill probably always have these ugly scars  
But right now I dont care about that part  
I bust the windows out your car  
After I saw you looking right at her  
I didnt wanna but I took my turn  
Im glad I did it cause you had to learn  
  
I must admit it helped a little bit  
To think of how youd felt when you saw it  
I didnt know that I had that much strength  
But Im glad you see what happens when  
You see you cant just play with peoples feelings  
Tell them you love them and dont mean it  
Youll probably say that it was juvenile  
But I think that I deserve to smile ha ha ha ha  
  
I bust the windows out ya car  
You know I did it cause I left my mark  
Wrote my initials with the crowbar  
And then I drove off into the dark  
  
I bust the windows out ya car ha  
You should feel lucky that was all I did  
After five whole years of this bullshit  
Gave you all of me and you played with it  
  
I must admit it helped a little bit  
To think of how youd feel when you saw it  
I didnt know that I had that much strength  
But Im glad you see what happens when  
You see you cant just play with peoples feelings  
Tell them you love them but dont mean it  
You probably say that it was juvenile  
But I think that I deserve to smile  
Bust windows out your car  
But it dont come back to my broken heart  
You could neva feel I how I felt that day  
Until it happens baby you dont know pain  
Ooh Yeah I did it yeah I did it  
You should know it you should know it  
I aint sorry I aint sorry  
You deserved it you deserved it  
After what you did to me after what you did  
You deserve it you deserve it  
I aint sorry no no oh I aint sorry  
You broke my heart so I broke you car  
You caused me pain you caused me pain  
So I did the same  
Even though what you did to me was much worse  
I had to do something to make you hurt  
Oh but why am I still crying  
Why am I the one whos still crying  
Oh oh you really hurt me baby  
You really you really hurt me baby  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
Now watch me you  
Now watch me  
Oh I bust the windows out your car
