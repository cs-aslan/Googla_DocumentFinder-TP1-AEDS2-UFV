I see the ravens made  
Her nest in your eyes  
Shes got you thinking that  
Her love is a prize  
And youll go under from  
The weight of her lies  
As the raven flies  
As the raven flies  
  
Shell bring you stories  
That just never sound true  
Shell bring you secrets  
That were never meant for you  
And just as you come round  
Shell send you back through  
Shes in love with you  
Shes in love with you  
  
Darker darker  
Dont let her talk her way  
Into you  
Lonely lonely  
You know shes only  
No good for you  
  
I see the ravens made  
Her nest in your eyes  
Shes got you thinking that  
Her love is a prize  
And youll go under from  
The weight of her lies  
  
As the raven flies  
As the raven flies  
As the raven flies  
As the raven flies
