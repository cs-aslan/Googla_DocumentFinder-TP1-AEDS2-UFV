Oh I know its hard for you to say its over  
Well its twice as hard for me to let you go  
Out there I hope you find a softer shoulder  
But before you leave theres something you should know  
  
Chorus  
I was glad to give my everything to you  
Yeah we almost made our every dream come true  
And though we didnt have the chance to see it through  
I was glad to give my everything to you  
  
Oh you say you need a little room for breathing  
Somehow I guess you know Id understand  
And though youre hurting me  
I still cant help in believing  
Id be glad if I could do it all again  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh I was glad to give my everything to you
