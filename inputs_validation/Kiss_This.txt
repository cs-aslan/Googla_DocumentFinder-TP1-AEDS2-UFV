I saw you on the front page of the letter  
She had to run away but you just wouldnt let her  
So what is she supposed to do  
She cant do anything when shes with you  
Try to find her heart but its so lost  
Now its time to show you whos boss  
  
123 she doesnt wanna be  
Held down so she cant see  
All of the coolest things  
She can be  
Nobody knows but me  
Take a chance a see  
She gonna make wish  
So kiss this  
  
When she finds the one  
Her heart starts to jump  
She thinks hes never gone  
Hes says hell never run  
Away with her heart  
Its no longer lost  
Its time to show you whos boss  
  
123 she doesnt wanna be  
Held down so she cant see  
All of the coolest things  
She can be  
Nobody knows but me  
Take a chance a see  
She gonna make wish  
So kiss this  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhhhh  
Gotta get back to her heart  
Tell her where to go when she starts  
To cry and ask  
The world why  
  
Well baby Here it comes  
  
123 she doesnt wanna be  
Held down so she cant see  
All of the coolest things  
She can be  
Nobody knows but me  
Take a chance a see  
She gonna make wish  
So kiss this  
2x  
  
Cmon cmon and kiss this you cant cmon and kiss this  
  
Ohhh
