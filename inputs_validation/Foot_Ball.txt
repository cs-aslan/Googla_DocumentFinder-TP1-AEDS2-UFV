Im a football baby  
  
Rollin round the field  
Ive been passed and fumbled  
Till I dont know what I feel  
Everybodys the same  
Theyre all footballs too  
Setting up the big play  
  
And trying to score  
  
Im a football baby  
In a football game  
  
Runkick  
Im a football baby  
  
  
Lifes a football game  
As every chump and champ knows  
  
We dont touch we collide  
Till were worn out inside  
Were kicking each other  
Right where it hurts  
Setting up the big play  
And trying to score  
  
Im a football baby  
  
In a football game  
Im a football baby  
Im a football baby  
In a football game  
Im a football baby  
  
Blockpass  
Im a football baby  
  
In a football game  
Im a football baby
