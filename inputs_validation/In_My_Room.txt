Ive got girls theyre in my room  
The only thing is my room is not here  
Its ten till two the clock wont move  
Detention hall is better with beer  
  
Chorus  
I can do it all in my room  
I can be a rockstar with a bad attitude  
I am the king in my room  
I can ground my mom and dad if I choose  
  
Shapow  
How do you like me now  
Shazaam  
I dont think you understand  
Shaquick  
Hey I got a ten inch tv screen  
Only in my room  
  
Ive got green its in my room  
The only thing is my room is not here  
Pitching tents inside my pants  
And theres a pool of drool by my ear  
  
I can take it all in my room  
I can be a quarterback and the coolest guy in school  
I can get on down in my room  
I can go and freak Rebecca Romijn in the nude  
  
Chorus
