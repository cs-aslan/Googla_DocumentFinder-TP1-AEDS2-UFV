And you might think its possible  
For me to think the same way that you do  
Ive figured out theres nothing I can do  
To change my life  
And nothing ever will  
And you might think its reasonable  
For me to just accept the way it is  
  
Ive heard it said  
Theres nothing I can do  
To change this world  
I wish it wasnt true  
There are those who say  
The world is ending every day  
But I want the chance  
Ive been waiting here  
I try to hide this pain and fear  
So give me a chance  
  
And I believe its rational  
To never want to see things  
The way they are  
Ive heard it said  
That we all carry something to believe  
And some can let it
