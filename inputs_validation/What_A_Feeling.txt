Verse 1 Liam  
Through the wire through the wire through the wire  
Im watching her dance dress is catching the light  
In her eyes theres no lies no lies  
Theres no question shes not in a disguise  
  
PreChorus Louis  
With no way out and a long way down  
Everybody needs someone around  
But I cant hold you too close now  
Through the wire through the wire  
  
Chorus All  
What a feeling to be right here beside you now  
Holding you in my arms  
When the air ran out and we both started running wild  
The sky fell down  
But youve got stars theyre in your eyes  
And Ive got something missing tonight  
What a feeling to be a king beside you somehow  
I wish I could be there now  
  
Verse 2 Liam  
Through the wire through the wire through the wire  
Im watching you like this imagining youre mine  
Its too late its too late am I too late  
Tell me now am I running out of time  
  
PreChorus Niall  
With no way out and a long way down  
Everybody needs someone around  
But I cant hold you too close now  
Through the wire through the wire  
  
Chorus All  
What a feeling to be right here beside you now  
Holding you in my arms  
When the air ran out and we both started running wild  
The sky fell down  
But youve got stars theyre in your eyes  
And Ive got something missing tonight  
What a feeling to be a king beside you somehow  
I wish I could be there now  
  
Bridge Harry  
Whatever chains are holding you back  
Holding you back dont let em tie you down  
Whatever chains are holding you back  
Holding you back tell me you believe in that  
  
Chorus All  
What a feeling to be right here beside you now  
Holding you in my arms  
When the air ran out and we both started running wild  
The sky fell down  
But youve got stars theyre in your eyes  
And Ive got something missing tonight  
What a feeling to be a king beside you somehow  
I wish I could be there now I wish I could be there now
