Mirror mirror  
Up on the wall in the back of the room  
As I walk down the hall in the house where I stayed  
Tell me something about what I saw in the face of a man  
Who once felt it all but feels nothing today  
  
Knock knock  
Whos there  
I dont know I cant say  
Ask me tomorrow  
Ill tell you the same  
  
Ooh Im telling you now  
Im telling you now  
Ooh Im telling you now  
Im telling you now  
  
Trouble trouble  
Down in my hood where its well understood  
They love when youre bad  
And they hate when youre good  
Tell me something about who we are at the end of our days  
When our souls become one but our lives separate  
  
Knock knock  
Whos there  
I dont know I cant say  
Ask me tomorrow  
Ill tell you the same  
  
Ooh Im telling you now  
Im telling you now Its bound to make you smile  
Ooh Im telling you now  
Im telling you now Its bound to make you smile  
  
Its bound to make you smile
