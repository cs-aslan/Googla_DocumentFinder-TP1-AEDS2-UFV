Move  move  Ive got the gift of life  
Cant you see it in the twinkle of my eye  
I cant stand up and I cant sit down  
I gotta keep movin  I gotta keep movin  
All the time that gets wasted hating  
Why dont you move together and make your heart feel better  
  
Groove  groove  to the beat of this drum  
Feel it in the wind and the warmth of the sun  
Dont sit down and dont stand up  
Keep on movin  keep on movin  
  
Think of the future and make it grow  
Why dont you move together an make your heart feel better  
  
Take a pinch of white and pinch of black  
Mix it together and make a movin flavour   
  
Take a pinch of white and pinch of black  
Tell you move together an make your heart feel better   
  
Move  move  we got the gift of life  
Go and shout it from your roof mountain top  
Give it to me once and give it to me twice  
We gotta keep movin  we gotta keep movin
