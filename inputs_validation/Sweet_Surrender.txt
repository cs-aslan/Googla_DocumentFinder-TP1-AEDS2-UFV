Hey little fella get your show together  
I was listening in before  
But now I dont care no more  
  
Look around now  
Its always that its gonna get you down  
Its only begun  
  
One look is all it took  
I remember that sweet surrender  
I recall do you  
That sweet surrender  
  
My determination  
Came creeping across the nation  
A sure mistake for anyone  
cause you cant take home everyone  
cause its only just begun  
  
One look is all it took  
I remember that sweet surrender  
I recall do you  
That sweet surrender  
  
I dont know I dont care  
cause Im living without you baby  
Even when I know whats going on  
It only took one look one glance  
To set my heart for romance  
Do you believe my sweet surrender  
  
My sweet surrender  
  
Hey little fella now your shows together  
I never wanted you to listen before  
So why should I walk out that door  
Stick around now  
And so the story goes on through the night  
Its only begun  
  
One look is all it took  
I remember that sweet surrender  
Do you recall cause I do  
That sweet surrender  
  
I dont know I dont care  
cause Im living without you baby  
Even when I know whats going on  
It only takes one look one glance  
To set my heart for romance  
One look is all it took  
My sweet surrender  
  
My sweet surrender  
One look is all it took to remember  
I dont know and I dont care
