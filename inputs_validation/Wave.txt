Hi hi I was running after you for a long time

Actually Ive watched you for a long time  
I like to watch you when youre walking  
Back and forth on the beach  
And the way your the way your cloth looks

Get all wet when youre walking near the water there  
Its real nice to talk to you

And you were standing there waving at everybody  
It was really great because there was about  
A billion people there but when I was waving to you  
Uh the way your face was it was so the way your face was  
It made me feel exactly like were  
Its not that you were just waving to me but  
That we were we were waving to each other
