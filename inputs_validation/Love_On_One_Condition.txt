I might forgive but I wont forget  
Believe me baby  
You swear you changed your ways  
You aint proved it yet  
  
Well my friends try and tell me  
Say that I must be mad  
If Im gonna take you back  
After the pain Ive had  
Well I explain my position  
That I made my decision  
Ill grant you love on one condition  
Love on one condition  
  
Do me right dont do me wrong  
Come home every night no more carryin on  
I explain my position  
Ill grant you love on one condition  
  
Well my friends try and tell me  
Say that I must be mad  
If Im gonna take you back  
After the pain Ive had  
Well I explain my position  
That I made my decision  
Ill grant you love on one condition  
Love on one condition
