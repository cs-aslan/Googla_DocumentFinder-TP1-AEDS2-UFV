Well met well met my own true love  
Well met well met cried she  
Ive just returned from the salt salt sea  
And its all for the love of thee  
  
I could have married a Kings daughter there  
She would have married me  
But I have forsaken my Kings daughter there  
Its all for the love of thee  
  
Well if you could have married a Kings daughter there  
Im sure youre the one to blame  
For I am married to a house carpenter  
And Im sure hes a fine young man  
  
Forsake forsake your house carpenter  
And come away with me  
Ill take you where the green grass grows  
On the shores of sunny Italy  
  
So up she picked her babies three  
And gave them kisses one two three  
Saying take good care of your daddy while Im gone  
And keep him good company  
  
Well they were sailin about two weeks  
Im sure it was not three  
When the younger of the girls she came on deck  
Sayin she wants company  
  
Well are you weepin for your house and home  
Or are you weepin for your babies three  
Well Im not weepin for my house carpenter  
Im weepin for my babies three  
  
Oh what are those hills yonder my love  
They look as white as snow  
Those are the hill of heaven my love  
You and Ill never know  
  
Oh what are those hills yonder my love  
They look as dark as night  
Those are the hills of hellfire my love  
Where you and I will unite  
  
Oh twice around went the gallant ship  
Im sure it was not three  
When the ship all of a sudden it sprung a leak  
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea
