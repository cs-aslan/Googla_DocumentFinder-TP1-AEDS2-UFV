She wants a man with lots of money  
Not a poor boy  
He buys her things she calls him honey  
She calls me poor boy  
What good could it do  
To give a love pure and true  
When any fool could understand  
She thinks that money makes the man  
She wants a man with lots of money  
Not a poor boy  
She wants the things shell buy with money  
Not a poor boy  
A man with money man with money man with money  
Just down the street  
I know a place  
When there asleep  
Ill cover my face  
Ill break the lock open the door  
Ill slip inside Ill rob the store  
Then Ill be a man with lots of money  
Not a poor boy  
Ill buy her things shell call me honey  
Not a poor boy  
A man with money man with money man with money man with money
