No one knows the side of you that I know  
No one gets to see to feel you  
To hear you when they call  
Im the only one you answer  
Because I know what to do  
I know what to do  
  
When I need you  
I just close my eyes and Im with you  
And all that I so want to give you  
Is only a heartbeat away  
When I need love  
I hold out my hand and I touch love  
I never knew there was so much love  
Keeping me warm night and day  
  
Miles and miles of empty space in between us  
A telephone cant take the place of your smile  
But I wont be traveling forever  
Its cold out but hold out  
And do like I do  
  
When I need you  
I just close my eyes and Im with you  
And all that I so want to give you  
Is only a heartbeat away  
  
Its not easy when the road is your driver  
But honey thats the heavy load that we bear  
But I wont be traveling a lifetime  
Its cold out but hold out  
And do like I do  
When I need you  
  
But I wont be traveling a lifetime  
Its cold out oh honey hold out  
And do like I do  
  
When I need you  
I just close my eyes and Im with you baby  
And all that I so want to give you  
Is only a heartbeat away  
  
When I need love  
I hold out my hand and I touch love  
I never knew there was so much love  
Keeping me warm night and day  
Honey when I need you  
  
Im in a cloud and Im holding my hand out to you  
Holding my hand out to you  
Holding my hand out for you
