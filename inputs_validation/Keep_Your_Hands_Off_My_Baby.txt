Weve been friends for oh so long  
I let you share whats mine  
But when it comes to the boy I love  
Its time to draw the line  
  
Keep your hands off my baby  
I aint gonna tell you not one more time  
Keep your hands off my baby  
Will you get it through your head  
That boy is mine  
  
I dont mind lending you my clothes  
My jewelry and such  
But honey lets get something straight  
Theres one thing you dont touch  
  
Keep your hands off my baby  
I aint gonna tell you not one more time  
Keep your hands off my baby  
Will you get it through your head  
That boy is mine  
  
Keep your hands off my baby  
I aint gonna tell you not one more time  
Keep your hands off my baby  
Will you get it through your head  
That boy is mine  
  
Keep your hands off my baby  
That boy is mine
