Shane  
Ive had many times I can tell you  
Times when innocence Id trade for company  
And children saw me crying  
I thought Id had my share of that  
But these miss you nights are the longest  
  
Bryan  
Midnight diamonds stud my heaven  
Southward burning like the jewels that are your face  
And the warm winds that embrace me  
Just as surely kissed your face  
Yet these miss you nights theyre the longest  
  
Mark Shane  
  
Lay down Lay down all thoughts of your surrender  
Its only me whos killing time  
Lay down Lay down all dreams and feelings once remembered  
Its just the same this miss you game  
  
Mark  
Thinking of my going  
How to cut the thread and leave it all behind  
Looking windward for my comfort  
I take each day as it arrives  
But these miss you nights are the longest  
  
Shane  
But these miss you nights are the longest
