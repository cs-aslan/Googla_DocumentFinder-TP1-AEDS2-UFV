Driving back in her car  
Watching the wipers  
Squashing the leaves away  
Suddenly there in the road  
Is your old self  
Trying to get out of the rain  
  
I am my enemy  
Mowing me over  
And towing the light away  
Somehow it just seems to fit  
With that old me  
Trying to get back again  
Imagination sets in  
Then all the voices begin  
  
Telling you things that arent happening  
But they nig and they nag til theyre under your skin  
Youve really got to  
Remember yourself  
Youve got a Full House in your head tonight  
Youve got to youve got to  
Remember yourself  
Stand back and see emotion getting you uptight  
My silly pride  
Digging the knife in  
She loves to come for her ride  
  
Surely by now I should know  
I can control  
My highs and my lows  
By questioning all that I do  
Examining every move  
Trying to get back to the rudiments  
  
If they nig and they nag Ill just put in the boot  
Youve really got to  
Remember yourself  
Youve got a Full House in your head tonight  
Youve got to youve got to  
Remember yourself  
Stand back and see emotion getting you uptight  
Remember yourself  
Youve got a Full House in your head tonight  
Youve got to youve got to  
Remember yourself  
Stand back and see emotion getting you uptight
