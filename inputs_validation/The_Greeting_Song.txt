Drivin around Ive got my baby and my top down  
Marygoround I ride you for my love  
Throwin me down in the backseat underground  
Im on the mound I make it for my love  
  
Who you talking to talk to me you  
Sound of music  
  
Makin my way I brake another LA day  
Time in the town I need it for my love  
My Chevrolet rollin to another play day  
This is the sound I listen for my love  
  
Who you talking to talk to me you  
Sound of music  
  
I love you swim through me  
Good feelings come to me  
  
Sought and I found a life of makin my blood sound  
Do anything for the one I love  
Something profound the face of God is in Sensurround  
Im on the mound I make it for my love  
  
I love you swim through me  
Good feelings come to me
