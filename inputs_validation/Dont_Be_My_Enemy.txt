Dont be my enemy  
Dont be my enemy  
You had your dreams  
You required a scheme of things  
Evolved resolved through the years  
And I had my part  
When you wrote me  
But you broke my heart  
When you wrote me  
You spend your whole time trying  
To burn me to the ground  
Dont be my enemy  
Cant you see what youre doing to me  
Dont be my enemy  
Cant you see what an effect this is having on me  
Dont be my enemy  
Cant you see what youre doing to me  
Dont be my enemy  
Cant you see what an effect this is having on me  
I had a thought  
It was just a simple thought  
Of a friend very close very clear  
But then it stopped looking so straight  
When you wrote me  
You found the hate  
When you wrote me  
You spend your whole time trying to make  
Me look like your main fool  
Dont be my enemy  
Cant you see what youre doing to me  
Dont be my enemy  
Cant you see what an effect this is having on me  
Dont be my enemy  
Cant you see what youre doing to me  
Dont be my enemy  
Cant you see what an effect this is having on me
