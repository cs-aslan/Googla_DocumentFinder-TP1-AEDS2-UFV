Ive laid around and played around this old town too long  
summers almost gone yes winters coming on  
Ive laid around and played around this old town too long  
And I feel like Ive gotta travel on  
  
Poppa writes to Johnny but Johnny cant come home  
Johnny cant come home no Johnny cant come home  
Poppa writes to Johnny but Johnny cant come home  
Cause hes been on the chain gang too long  
  
Ive laid around and played around this old town too long  
summers almost gone yes winters coming on  
Ive laid around and played around this old town too long  
And I feel like Ive gotta travel on
