I fell in love with a windup souvenir  
I bought it downtown as I was on my way to meet you  
She sounds the like the songs you used to sing to put me to sleep  
Now that youre gone shes all that Ive left to hold  
  
And I feel so all alone  
No ones gonna fix me when Im broke  
How do you cry with inanimate eyes  
Youre never gonna smile with the way that youre wired  
  
And I feel so all alone  
  
I gave it to youI dont need a toy  
I thought you might appreciate it I dont like the way that it moves  
The way that she dances  
The painted look upon her face Someone mustve thrown this away  
She must have come from the sun Ive got too much stuff  
I want to take her through the park  
Where shed tell me Im all speaking of which  
That she wants  
If she could even talk I think we Need to talk  
  
I feel so all alone  
No ones gonna fix me when Im broke  
How do you cry with inanimate eyes  
Youre never gonna smile with the way that you are  
  
And I feel so all alone  
I feel so all alone  
  
And she sits on my shelf  
It makes me think of you  
The way she carries the things that remind me of who  
We used to be before we became antiques  
Shes a lot like you  
But when I hold her too tight I know shell break  
She just takes some glue to stay  
  
And oI feel so all alone  
No ones gonna fix me when Im broke  
How do you cry with inanimate eyes  
Youre never gonna smile with the way that you are  
  
And I feel so all alone  
I feel so all alone  
I feel so all alone
