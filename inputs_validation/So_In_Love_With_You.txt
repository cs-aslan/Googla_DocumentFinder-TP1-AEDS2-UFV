God Ive found in You  
Everything I was searching for  
And Youve given me  
What I needed and so much more  
  
So Im giving every part of me to You  
Wont You take my life Im living it for You  
  
Jesus Ill live for You  
In everything I do  
And when You call my name  
I just cant help but sing Your praises  
  
Ill give You all my praise  
Ill serve You all my days  
Gonna let the whole world know  
Jesus I am so in love with You  
  
Every day its You I live for  
Gonna serve You all my days  
Every step I take Youre with mejesus Youre the only way
