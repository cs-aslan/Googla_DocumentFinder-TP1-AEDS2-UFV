Some day when Im awfully low  
When the world is cold  
I will feel a glow just thinking of you  
And the way you look tonight  
Oh but youre lovely with your smile so warm  
And your cheek so soft  
There is nothing for me but to love you  
And the way you look tonight  
With each word your tenderness grows  
Tearing my fear apart  
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose  
Touches my foolish heart  
Lovely  Never ever change  
Keep that breathless charm  
Wont you please arrange it  
Cause I love you  
Just the way you look tonight
