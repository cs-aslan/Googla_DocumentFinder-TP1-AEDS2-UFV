She bought a ticket to nowhere  
And she told me that shes sick of this life  
She said dont worry its alright  
Cos she doesnt want to see me cry  
  
Oh I wish that she could see  
How beautiful she is to me  
  
Baby baby hold on  
Oh please dont let go  
Baby baby be strong  
So much you dont know  
Life is crazy sometimes  
I know its not easy  
But baby baby hold on  
  
I wiped the tears from her face  
Shes forgotten how her smile used to feel  
She holds my hand and she whispers  
Tell me why you love a loser like me  
  
Oh I wish that she could see  
How beautiful she is to me  
  
Baby baby hold on  
Oh please dont let go  
Baby baby be strong  
So much you dont know  
Life is crazy sometimes  
I know its not easy  
But baby baby hold on  
  
Baby baby hold on  
Oh baby hold on  
Oh baby baby hold on  
  
I wish that you could see  
Oh how beautiful you are to me  
  
Oh baby baby hold on  
Oh please dont let go  
Baby baby be strong  
So much you dont know  
Life is crazy sometimes  
I know its not easy  
I know its not easy  
But baby baby hold on  
  
Baby baby hold on  
Baby baby hold on
