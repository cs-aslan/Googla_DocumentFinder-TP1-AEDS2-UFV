Verse 1  
Please dont come around talking bout that you love me  
Cause that love shit just aint for me

And I know that all youre doing is running your mind games  
Dont you know that game repeats game  
So your best bet is to be straight with me

So you say you wanna talk lets talk  
If you wont talk Ill walk

There you go looking pitiful  
Just because I let you go  
There you go talking about you want me back

There you go cause your lies got old  
Now look at you there you go
