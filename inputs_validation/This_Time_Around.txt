Its getting colder in this ditch where I lie  
Im feeling older and Im wondering why  
I heard they told her it was tell and live or die  
I didnt know her but I know why she lied  
I didnt know her but I know why she died  
  
Chorus  
You cant say I didnt give it  
I wont wait another minute  
Were on our way this time around  
You cant say I didnt give it  
I wont wait another minute  
Were on our way this time around  
  
And we wont go down  
  
I heard them say that dreams should stay in your head  
Well I feel ashamed of the things that Ive said  
Put on these chains and you can live a free life  
Well Id rather bleed just to know why I die  
  
Chorus  
You cant say I didnt give it  
I wont wait another minute  
Were on our way this time around  
You cant say I didnt give it  
I wont wait another minute  
Were on our way this time around  
  
And we wont go down  
And we wont go down  
And we wont go down  
And we wont go down  
All I know is that fear has got to go  
This time around  
  
Ive started feeling like I dont want to fight  
Give in to the given and put out the light  
Cannons ablazin shower these moonlit skies  
Then I remember and I know why he died  
Do you know why I die  
  
Chorus x2  
You cant say I didnt give it  
I wont wait another minute  
Were on our way this time around  
You cant say I didnt give it  
I wont wait another minute  
Were on our way this time around  
  
And we wont go down  
And we wont go down  
And we wont go down
