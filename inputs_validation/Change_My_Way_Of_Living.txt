Ive got to change my way of living  
Cause troubles all that I can see  
I gotta change my way of living  
Lord troubles all that I can see  
My life is in such a mess  
There aint no one to blame but me  
My good girl tried to tell me  
Wouldnt hear a thing she said  
Lord my good girl tried to tell me  
Wouldnt hear a lonesome thing she said  
Now shes taken her things and left me  
No place for me to lay my head  
Blue Lord Im blue  
Raining down on me  
I gotta change my way of living  
Cause the blues is all I see  
Blue Lord Im blue  
Raining down on me  
I gotta change my way of living  
Change my way  
The blues is all I see  
Now when your luck runs out  
Thats when your friends will run out too  
Lord when your luck runs out  
Your fair weather friends will run out too  
Youre a very lucky man Lord  
If there is just one wholl stand by you  
Blue Lord Im blue  
The blues raining down on me  
I gotta change my way of living  
Cause the blues is all I see
