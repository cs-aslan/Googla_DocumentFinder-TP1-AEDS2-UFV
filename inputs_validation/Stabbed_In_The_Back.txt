We were brother you and me  
Loyal to our hardcore scene  
Our thought our aims  
Our goals were true  
Then someting happened to you  
You changed  
I remember all the things you said  
Shit you said   
I guess it was a just a buch of fucking lies  
Fucking lies  
Stabbed us all in the back  
Right in the back   
Dont you dare look me in the eyes   
All we stood for all our dreams  
Youve forgotten what they mean  
I tell you this  
My thoughts are real  
And Ill never change  
The way I feel
