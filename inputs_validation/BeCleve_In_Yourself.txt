I know what its like to feel down little girl  
I hope someone lifts you up like the big guy who lifted me up  
No Im talkin about the big guy right here Cleveland Brown  
Not long ago I was lower than Lohan  
No plan a lost man raisin my little girl in a Cadillac Brougham  
My quest success but my life was a mess  
Poor Kenny West no zest antidepressed  
Not dressed to impress  
Matter fact more stressed  
Than John Mayer waiting on his aids test  
Then I met a man who taught me how to live large  
Took me out of my car  
Now Im in his garage  
Turns out all I needed was some inspiration  
Like Mr Miagi but a lot less Asian  
My game was timid now my flow much bolder  
Got a chubby brown angel sittin on my shoulder sayin  
Girl singing  
You know it dont matter what you do  
Cuz Ill always be there for you  
BeCleve in yourself  
Cleveland Grow a mustache  
BeCleve in yourself  
Cleveland Slap your wifes ass  
BeCleve in yourself  
Cleveland Never smoke grass  
BeCleve in yourself  
Cleveland Really pass gas  
BeCleve in yourself Goodnight
