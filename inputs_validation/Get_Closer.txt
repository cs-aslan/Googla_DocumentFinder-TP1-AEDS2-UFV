Want love Get closer  
You want love Get closer  
Hold her hand be forward  
Come on be a man get closer  
Instead of worrying about those things you said  
Follow your heart and forget your head  
Maybe some things will jump out your mouth  
Make her notice that youre crazy about her  
You want love Get closer  
You want love Get closer  
You make a fuss when her eyes aint on you  
Well give her something to look forward to  
Remember all those other girls who ran  
Away from something they didnt understand  
You want love Get closer  
You want love Get closer  
Why you worrying about those things you said  
Follow your heart and forget your head  
Oh slide over on the seat  
Shell give you something thats oh so sweet
