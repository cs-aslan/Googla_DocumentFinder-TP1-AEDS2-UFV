Somewhere a redeyes waitress glances at another movie magazine  
Down on the corner theres a grocery boy stuffin boxes fulla hungry dreams  
Someones cleanin up the offices one window burnin in the dark  
Somebodys cryin is there any way in hell  
To light a comet from a single spark  
Workin so hard I cant remember much about the freedom I been workin for  
Felt like a prisoner til I looked in your eyes  
And saw a million wide open doors  
Ya tell me put a little money away well every dog will have his day in time  
Well I been slavin like a dog and I got nothin to show ya  
But a collar and a fist fulla nickels and dimes  
Chorus  
I want a piece a piece of the action give me a shot at the real thing  
I want a piece of the action a piece of the action  
Gonna turn on the master gonna cut these strings  
Gonna turn on the master gonna cut these strings  
Been livin just like my old man did and neither once of us could get it right  
Punchin in when the day begins and punchin out the local boys at night  
Theres someone leanin on a peelin porch  
And someone leavin on a silver plane  
And I finally know the man Id rather be  
Girl I wont be back to getcha til they know my name  
Chorus  
They hand you a paycheck every week and steal a piece of your soul every day  
An I dont need no gold watch in fifty years baby lets be golden today  
chorus repeats 2x  
Solo  
Chorus  
Somewhere a redeyes waitress glances at another movie magazine  
Down on the corner theres a grocery boy stuffin boxes fulla hungry dreams
