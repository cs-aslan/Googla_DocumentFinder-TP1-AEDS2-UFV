I looked in my rear view mirror and  
It seemed to make a lot more sense  
Than what I see ahead of us  
Ahead of us yeah  
Uh Im ready to make that turn  
Before we both crash and burn  
Cause that could be the death of us  
The death of us  
  
Baby you know how to drive in rain  
And You decided not to make a change  
Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper  
Traffic Im under pressure cause I cant have you  
The way that I want  
Lets just go back to the way it was
