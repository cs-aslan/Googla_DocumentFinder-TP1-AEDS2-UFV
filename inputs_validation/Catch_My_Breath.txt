We were still in high school  
When I first met you  
Even then you were the prettiest girl  
That I ever knew  
And we carved our name on  
Everything that we could find  
The way that all kids do  
And although time has passed  
I still get surprised  
At the pulling in my chest  
When I know youre coming by  
If this feelings proving anything  
Its not everything  
Is gonna change with time  
Youre still mine  
  
Chorus  
Did you know when youre around  
My heart wont it cant slow down  
It beats so hard it makes it hard  
To catch my breath to catch my breath  
  
Dont ever ask me if Im sorry  
Or that Im here with you  
Baby you can bet  
I dont regret the girls I never knew  
Every days another first  
Another change for me  
To fall in love with you  
And I do  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh When youre with me  
I stop seeing  
Any way to fail how do I explain  
I try to tell you what Im feeling  
But how do I when all words pale  
  
Chorus x2  
  
To catch my breath to catch my breath  
To catch my breath to catch my breath
