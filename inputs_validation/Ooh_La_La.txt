Poor old Granddad I laughed at all his words  
I thought he was a bitter man  
He spoke of womens ways  
Theyll trap you then they use you before you even know  
For love is blind and youre far too kind  
Dont ever let it show  
  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was younger  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was stronger  
  
The cancan such a pretty show  
Will steal your heart away  
But backstage back on earth again  
The dressing rooms are grey  
They come on strong and it aint too long  
For they make you feel a man  
But love is blind and you soon will find  
Youre just a boy again  
  
When you want her lips you get her cheek  
Makes you wonder where you are  
If you want some more then shes fast asleep  
youre just twinkling with the stars  
  
Poor young grandson theres nothing I can say  
Youll have to learn just like me  
And thats the hardest way ooh la la  
Ooh la la la la yeah  
  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was younger  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was stronger
