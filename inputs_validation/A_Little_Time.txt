Higher  
Its what I expect from my life  
Its like a wire  
That holds me back down to the ground  
  
Oh I hear you say  
That is the way of the world  
No hear what I say  
I want to do so much in my way  
  
Higher  
Ive set my limits and bounds  
Theres a fire  
Its burning so hot in my head  
  
Oh I hear you say  
That is the way of the world  
No hear what I say  
I want to do so much in my way  
  
Chorus  
We got  
A little time to build up your lives  
A little time to make up our minds  
A little time to fill up our dreams  
A little time time  
  
Chorus
