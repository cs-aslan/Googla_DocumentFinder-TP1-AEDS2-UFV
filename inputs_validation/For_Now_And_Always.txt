For now and always  
Ill hold you tight day and night  
Keep the love light burnin bright in my heart for you  
  
Pretty little sweetheart  
Ill love you for now and always  
Ill break a date to roller skate  
To sit up late just to wait at the gate for you  
  
Pretty little sweetheart  
Ill love you for now and always  
For your sake time Ill take a pretty bungalow  
Ill even learn to make for you  
  
Pretty little sweetheart  
Ill love you for now and always  
Ill do my work like a Turk  
Ill never shirk Ill be a butcher boy or clerk for you  
  
Love is like a roller coaster  
Running upside down  
Gonna make a great big poster  
Spread the news around  
  
For now and always  
Youll always be the one for me  
Cant you see that Ill always be in love with you  
  
Pretty little sweetheart  
Ill love you for now and always  
Ill do the chores sweep the floors  
From the stores cause Ill always adore you  
  
Not for a day not for a year  
Not for a century but forever dear  
  
For now and always  
I cant deny my heart will fly  
To the sky when I sing a lullaby with you  
  
Pretty little sweetheart  
Ill love you for now and always  
Therell be three you and me  
Someone sweet as she can be who looks just like you  
  
Pretty little sweetheart  
Pretty little sweetheart  
Pretty little sweetheart  
I love you
