If you go theyll say youre following  
If you dont then youre too good for them  
If you smile you must be ignorant  
If you dont whats your problem  
If youre down so ungrateful  
And if youre happy why so selfish  
You cant win no you cant win no  
  
Chorus  
The one who doesnt quite fit in  
Under dressed under your skin  
Oh a walking disaster  
Every time you try to fly you end up fallin  
Out of line  
Oh you cant you cant win no  
  
If youre thin call it a walkin disease  
If youre not theyre all screamin obese  
If youre straight why arent you married yet  
If youre gay why arent you waving a flag  
If its wrong youll never hit  
If its right youll always miss  
You cant win no you cant win no  
  
Chorus  
  
And you try you try so hard  
But I swear it on your heart  
And you play you play the game  
But you pay you pay for it  
You cant win no you cant win no  
  
If you speak youll only piss them off  
If you dont youre another robot  
If you stop theyll just say you quit  
If you dont you might lose your shh  
You cant win no you cant win no  
You cant win no  
  
Chorus  
  
I cant win  
  
Chorus
