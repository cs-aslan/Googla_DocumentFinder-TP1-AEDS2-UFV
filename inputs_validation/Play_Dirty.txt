The boys in the back room  
Billy shooting pool  
Trading dirty glances  
With pretty boys playing cool  
  
Theyre putting down their whiskey  
Getting loaded tonight  
Its gettin kind of risky  
Theyre lookin to fight  
  
If you want action  
If you want a thrill  
Then take it down to Jimmys bar and grill  
  
Chorus  
And play dirty  
And dirty games too  
Play dirty  
Like dirty boys do  
  
Tattoo Willies happenin  
He really makes a scene  
Hes got anything you like  
If you know what I mean  
  
Troubles up when the heat comes down  
Cause down at Jimmys  
They dont mess around  
  
Chorus  
  
Come on man lets take this right outside  
Come on sucker hit it  
  
The place is gettin restless  
Theres trouble in the air  
All hells about to break loose  
The dirty punks just dont care  
  
If you want action if you want a thrill  
Then take it down to Jimmys bar and grill  
  
Chorus
