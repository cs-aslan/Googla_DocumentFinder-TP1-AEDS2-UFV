Well Im a real life cowboy  
Just a quiet humble fella  
Thats what were like  
Apart from Mike  
Yeah Im more of a yeller  
  
Sing songs to pass the evenings  
And because it soothes the herd  
So they wont stampede  
Unless Mike sings lead  
And shouts every single word  
  
Mike  
  
Sorry  
  
Cause were cowboys  
Reallife cowboys  
Not like the ones you see on your tv  
Weve never held up banks at all  
Were poorly paid  
And kinda small  
If you still wanna be a cowboy  
Stick with me  
  
On your horse for eighteen hours  
And that saddle sores a curse  
Then you feed your horse  
And yourself of course  
Though beans just make it worse  
  
Then youre back driving cattle  
Thats what being a cowboy means  
Moving those beasts from west to east  
Sorry its the beans  
  
Cause were cowboys  
Reallife cowboys  
Not like the ones youve seen in the movies  
Were not big hunks like that John Wayne  
Cause our horses would complain  
If you still wanna be a cowboy  
Join us please  
  
You should be aware  
We have some customs that are strange  
Like saying Howdy  not Hello  
When youre out here on the range  
  
Never touch a cowboys hat  
Never ride his horse  
So what would happen if I took your old mare  
Well Id shoot you of course  
  
Fair enough  
  
Cowboys  
Reallife cowboys  
Not like the ones you see on silver screens  
We didnt go out starting fights  
Cause unions fought for our rights  
Now Mike will do a solo thanks to beans  
  
How was that  
  
It stunk  
  
And now my friend I fear  
That the end is drawing near  
Cause we only ruled the range for twenty years
