Tell me anything you think I want to hear  
Just to keep me standin here  
To secure your shaky fears  
  
Tell me you love me but in your heart you know you dont  
So you lie cause you think I want  
To make believe you love when you dont  
  
Lead me on lead me on  
Lead me on lead me on  
Ill play along and along and along  
Baby lead me on  
Lead me on  
  
Pretend its rainin when the tears flow from my eyes  
And youre warm when youre cold as ice  
And everythings gonna be alright  
  
And its a shame little Johnny wears my name  
And you know Im not the one  
Still you say he is my son  
  
Chorus  
  
And when I leave to go work for you  
You cry youre lonely too  
To make me feel your love is true  
  
But in your dreams you slip and tell it all  
I hear you calling out his name  
You say you love him loud and plain  
  
Chorus
