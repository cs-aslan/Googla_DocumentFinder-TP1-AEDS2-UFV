I found a grave  
Brushed off the face  
Felt your light  
I remember why I know this place  
  
I found a bird  
Closing her eyes  
One last time  
And I wonder if she dreamed like me  
  
Well as much as it hurts  
Aint it wonderful to feel  
So go on and bring your wings  
Follow your heart till it bleeds  
As we run towards the end of the dream  
  
Im not afraid  
I push through the pain  
And Im on fire  
I remember how to breathe again  
  
As much as it hurts  
Aint it wonderful to feel  
So go on and bring your wings  
Follow your heart till it bleeds  
As we run towards the end of the dream  
  
Why must we fall apart to understand how to fly  
I will find a way even without wings  
Follow your heart till it bleeds  
As we run towards the end of the dream  
  
Follow your heart  
Till it bleeds  
And weve gone to the end of the dream
