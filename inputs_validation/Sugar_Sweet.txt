Im gonna tell you about my baby  
I speak of her with pride  
She go all the way to make me satisfied  
Oh shes my baby shes my baby dont you see  
I cant call her sugar cause sugar never was so sweet  
She manicure my nails scratch dandruff from my head  
Shes my baby shes my baby dont you see  
I cant call her sugar cause sugar never was so sweet  
When I say what I want thats the way its gonna be  
She fall over backwards to go right on pleasin me  
Oh shes my baby shes my baby cant you see  
I cant call her sugar cause sugar never was so sweet
