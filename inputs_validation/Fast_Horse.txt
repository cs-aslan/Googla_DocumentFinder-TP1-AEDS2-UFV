How can I be drunk  
You strike with dry poison  
I am possessed  
Still engaged in some kind of advanced shackling  
  
Girl you got to find you the man who  
Can smoke this out Bad Medicine  
Girl you got to find you the man who  
Can smoke this out Good Medicine would say  
  
You got you a fast horse darlin  
But all you do is complain it aint a Maserati  
You had a soul that you left back in Memphis  
But your mama aint New York she is pure  
Tennessee  
  
On a desert highway  
I am struck by my own rage  
Timebomb in his palm a fingerapple  
Augments this advanced shackling  
  
Girl you got to find you the man who  
Can smoke this out bad medicine  
Girl you got to find you the man who  
Can smoke this out good medicine would say  
  
You got you a fast horse darlin  
But all you do is complain it aint a Maserati  
You had a soul that you left back in Memphis  
But your mama aint New York she is pure  
Cant you see your mama aint New York  
She is pure Tennessee  
Tennessee
