Theres something in the silence  
I never used to feel  
Theres something about knowing  
That tells you this is real  
When youre close  
All I know I dont want to let you go  
  
Chorus  
Hello happiness  
Tell me where youve been  
I missed the sound of your voice  
Missed the touch of your skin  
Its no secret Im Not who I used to be  
Anyone can see  
Youre the difference in me  
Oh the difference  
  
Im standing at your doorstep  
Let me look into your eyes  
We could strip away the secrets  
Between you and me tonight  
  
Wont you say its OK  
Let the world just fade away  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah the difference in me  
The difference  
When youre close all I know I dont want to let you go  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah the difference in me  
Oh the difference  
Theres something in the silence I never used to feel
