Jesus dont want me for a sunbeam  
Sunbeams are never made like me  
  
Dont expect me to cry  
For all the reasons you had to die  
Dont ever ask your love of me  
  
Dont expect me to cry  
Dont expect me to lie  
Dont expect me to die for me

Dont expect me to lie  
Dont expect me to die for me

Dont expect me to lie  
Dont expect me to die for me
