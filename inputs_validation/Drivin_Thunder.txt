People put me down  
Say that Im a fool  
But I got news for them  
I aint never going back  
To driving school  
  
And I aint too good  
With numbers  
And Ive just run out of fuel  
Here comes  
Another corner baby  
Let me demonstrate  
My slide rule  
  
Drivin thunder  
Rollin down the highway  
Just one way to go  
Just one way to go  
Just one way to go  
Hey hey and thats my way  
  
I stopped into the courthouse  
I had to pay some bills  
Got talking with the judge  
About the finer points  
Of my driving skills  
  
He said Son  
You only drive that way  
Tryin to get your thrills  
But bear in mind  
Your drivers license  
Aint never been no  
License to kill  
  
Drivin thunder  
Rollin down the highway  
Just one way to go  
Just one way to go  
Just one way to go  
Hey hey and thats my way  
  
Driving school  
Slide rule  
Driving skills  
License to kill  
  
Drivin thunder  
Rollin down the highway  
Just one way to go  
Just one way to go  
Just one way to go  
Hey hey and thats my way
