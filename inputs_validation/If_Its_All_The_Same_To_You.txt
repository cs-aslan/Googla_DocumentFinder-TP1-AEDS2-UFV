I listened to a friend whod do the same for me last night  
Cause it takes one to really understand  
And I watched him try to walk the line  
Between whats wrong and right  
And knew that fool was gonna fall again  
  
Chorus  
Ah but the fool Ive been aint nothing like the fool Id be  
To keep believin dreams that dont come true  
Because you know it never was too far from love to make believe  
And Ill be leavin if its all the same to you  
  
Its hard to lead a friend in need of somethin hard to face  
Cause simple truth aint simple when its sad  
And misery loves company but Lord its such a waste  
To go on throwin good love after bad  
  
Chorus  
  
Yes Ill be leavin cause its all the same to you
