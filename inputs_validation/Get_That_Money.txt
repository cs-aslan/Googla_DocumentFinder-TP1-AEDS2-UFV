I know some niggas thatll merk ya for a quarter birdy  
You bitch ass niggas just be lucky that the boy aint hurtin  
I got the money to lag and I got that swagger workin  
Im smokin somethin I cant pronounce behind them Phantom curtains  
What is you hollin bitch Im on some gangsta shit  
She wanna make me dinner I tell her make me rich  
You fuckin wit a winner but I come from the litter  
Hoe but bet I can take that dirt and turn that shit glitter  
I leave the work wit her yeah she my baby sitter  
And if I find out she stealin for realer Im a kill her  
Im just a money man so where the dollars at  
So momma Im a beat that until them flowers black  
She wanna ride on this I make her ride wit that  
Her pistol in the ceilin thats her survival pack  
And do I love her naw man I just love her spirit  
Blind deaf or crazy its money over bitches  
  
Chorus x2  
Now everybody that I know get that money baby  
And we aint worryin bout them hoes get that money baby  
You get that cooked or that blow you done called a baller  
If you aint talkin bout that dough homie whatcha talkin  
  
So getcha game up take a bitch break a bitch  
Strap her down wit work and tell her dont trip take a trip  
Getcha hustle up the moneys what you make of it  
These niggas want it cooked and I done closed down the bakery  
So stop stuntin homie false promotin  
It aint about whatcha makin its all about what ya totin  
Burn him up leave him naked bring him back to his wife  
The bitch aint even cry cause he was livin that life  
These niggas think Im slippin cause Im fallin back  
Bitch I got money in the walls for that  
Youngin get it from the ground homie hold the hood down and  
Dont make a sound if them people swing around this bitch  
Do ya thang whoa hustle try to stay low  
This is for my old school Gs who aint around this bitch  
But shawty they aint fuckin wit pops  
Let them niggas chase that pussy we gon follow that guap yeah  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Fifty stacks in the garden in the backyard  
Money talkin turn a key into a crack charge  
Yall niggas aint eatin how we eatin B  
Fuck how we used to be now we how we need to be  
If they aint wit us they must be against us  
We shoot em in the head cause they act like they senseless  
If you aint gettin bread nigga keep yo distance  
We sharks over here nigga keep on fishin  
  
Money money money is my intuition  
Money over bitches such an easy decision  
Young Money money men monster militia  
Hard body these niggas boxes of tissue  
That nina will kiss ya that chopper will twist ya  
Them three eighty snapshots now smile for the pictures  
Weezy motherfuckin baby pay me  
My nientofive is overrated Im on that grind hoe  
  
Chorus x2
