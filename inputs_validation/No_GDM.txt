Want to be a great dark man  
Being but a lesbian  
You are perfect you are sheer  
If you are a redhaired queer  
  
Thats life one dice  
Cest la vie ma cherie  
But it really doesnt matter  
  
No GDM no great dark man  
No GDM no great dark man  
  
There wont be a great dark man  
If I am a redhaired queer  
You are perfect you are sheer  
If you are a redhaired queer  
  
Cest la vie pale sniff  
Cest la vie ma cherie  
But it really doesnt matter  
  
Yellow teeth between pink lips  
Eyeline shadow with a crazy look  
Jewel behind the lobe of ear  
Rouge on my face hides my beard  
Long violet fingernails  
I adore those magic tails  
  
I dont mind I dont mind  
No GDM no great dark man  
No GDM no great dark man
