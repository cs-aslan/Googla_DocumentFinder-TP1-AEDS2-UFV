Under the endless sky  
Beneath a million stars  
Within the course of a lifetime  
How very young we are  
  
As I stumble on this journey  
Along the road to what is real  
Im not made of steel  
Im not made of steel  
  
With all the lessons of my learning  
And the strength that I possess  
Still there are mountains I wish I was moving  
That take much more than my best  
  
There are plans beyond my power  
There are dreams beyond my reach  
  
Oh these eyes deceive the words I speak  
Dont tell the story inside  
So dont believe the face you see  
Its only the face of my pride  
  
Chorus  
Im not made of steel  
Im not made of stone  
I cant be anything more than Im made of  
Move heaven and earth on my own  
  
Im only a man  
Flesh and blood is all I am  
You think I can carry the world on my shoulders  
That dont mean that I can  
I can bend I can break I can feel  
Im not made of steel  
  
They teach you well to wear your armor  
But what youve learned is just a lie  
And theres a price to be paid for denying  
With every tear you never cry  
Dont ever show dont let them know  
The heart you never reveal  
Dont ask me why dont make me hide  
The pain you dont think I can feel  
  
Chorus  
  
Im only a man  
Flesh and blood is all I am  
You think I can carry the world on my shoulders  
That dont mean that I can  
I can bend I can break I can feel  
Im not made of steel  
  
Oh dont believe the face you see  
Its only the face of my only the face of my pride  
  
Chorus  
  
Im only a man  
Flesh and blood is all I am  
You think I can carry the world on my shoulders  
That dont mean that I can  
Im not made of steel  
Im not made of stone  
Im not made of steel  
Im not made of stone
