I was told cause I didnt witness the whole act  
In and out was the movement of the bozack  
It was hot and sweaty and lots of pushin  
Then the nut came gushin  
And it was hell tryin to bail to the ovary  
With nothin but the Lord lookin over me  
I was white with a tail  
But when I reached the finish line young black male  
One cell made two and two cells made fo  
And so on so now Im a embryo  
Then I got a hunch  
That Ima be on lock down for nine months  
Chillin with my mother to guide me  
And nothin but a stomach to hide me  
From all that worry and bullshit  
Nine months later I elbow pull and kick  
Cause my time is up and I dont care  
With one big push Im outta there  
June 15th its just my luck  
In 1969 a nigga is the product  
  
Ghetto ass nigga you aint shit  
And you aint gon never be shit  
  
I learned how to walk and talk and all that  
They put me in school but it dont matter  
Cause Im sittin in history  
Learnin bout a sucker who didnt give a fuck about me  
They try to shape us  
But I know Uncle Sam is a motherfuckin rapist  
So I stopped payin attention  
Ice Cube headed straight to detention  
Fuck that shit I roam the hallways  
Im sent home and I dont got all As  
A high school dropout  
My father had beef so I tried to knock pops out  
But I got tossed hes the boss  
Im out of there and mad cause I lost  
Now bein on my own is a factor  
So I become the neighborhood jacker  
Gimme your car run your jewels  
Makin a livin robbin fools  
And if I let my nine rang out  
You know itll make your brains hang out  
So whats your fate  
Am I the nigga you love or the one you love to hate  
The wrong answer is said the nigga fled  
I pump lead now hes in a puddle of red  
And if you got a buck youre shit out of luck  
Stuck up by the motherfuckin product  
  
Uhuh motherfucker you gots to get a job  
If you want to stay in my motherfuckin house  
  
Many young men reject the traditional values  
That are important to their parents  
Church school and family  
Have been replaced by street turf and gang  
  
Twentyone now and paid in full  
Feelin bad from all the shit I pulled  
On people back in the day  
Plus I got a little baby on the way  
So Im tryin to go straight  
Im with my babys momma out on a date  
Til the punk ass cops ran my plate  
Now Im on a bus upstate  
  
Oh the young nigga done caught a case  
Sittin in the mess hall sayin my grace  
  
Sent to a concrete hoehouse  
Where all the products go no doubt  
Yo momma I gotta do eleven  
Livin in a five by seven  
Dear baby your mans gettin worn out  
Of seein young boys gettin they assholes torn out  
And then he got shanked with a spoon  
And he was sposed to get out soon  
Is it my fault he was caught in production  
Where a young black life means nothin  
Just because I didnt want to learn your grammar  
You say Im better off in the slammer  
And its drivin me batty  
Cause my little boy is missin daddy  
Im ashamed but the fact is  
I wish pops let me off on the mattress  
Or should I just hang from the top bunk  
But thats goin out like a punk  
My life is fucked  
But it aint my fault cause Im the motherfuckin product  
  
He aint shit
