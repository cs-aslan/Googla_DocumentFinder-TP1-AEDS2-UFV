And so we say  
We aint got life  
Dont want a cardboard cutout  
Dont want a plastic knife  
  
Now I know time can march  
With its chargin feet  
Now I know words are only cheap  
Its gonna be a burn out  
All around this town  
The South is up  
But the North is down  
  
Theres gonna be a killin  
Of a woman and a man  
Trying to feed that child  
Without a coin in their hand  
  
And so we say  
Have you no use  
For eight million hands  
And the power of youth  
  
Now I know time can march  
With its chargin feet  
Now I know words are only cheap  
Its gonna be a burn out  
All around this town  
The South is up  
But the North is down  
  
Theres gonna be a killin  
Of a woman and a man  
Trying to feed that child  
Without a coin in their hand  
  
Its gonna be a burn out  
  
And so we say  
We aint diggin no graves  
Were diggin a foundation  
For a future to be made  
  
Now I know time can march  
With its chargin feet  
Now I know words are only cheap  
Its gonna be a burn out  
All around this town  
The South is up  
But the North is down  
  
Theres gonna be a killin  
Of a woman and a man  
Trying to feed that child  
Without a coin in their hand  
  
Its gonna be a burn out
