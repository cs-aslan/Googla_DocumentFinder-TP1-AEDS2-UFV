Dont go nowhere  
Oh cant you see  
That I still care  
And my love it is strong  
  
With all of my heart I do  
With all of my breath I say  
Wanting to see you  
Each and everyday  
  
Some good things are gone  
Some are on their way  
And Im telling you  
Im begging you  
Please stay  
  
Dont go nowhere  
Oh cant you see  
That I still care  
My love yes it strong  
  
Speak no word  
Utter no sound  
I wanna tell you  
I got to tell you  
How Im feeling right now  
  
My love is all  
My heart is still fond  
I mean my hopes and my dreams  
Can come true wsith only one  
DOnt go nowhere  
  
Oh cant you see  
That I still care  
My love yes I strong  
All emotions you will feel  
  
I will fill your empty needs  
Im not promising you heaven  
But as close as we could be  
  
Youre more than a blessing  
Youre a miracle to me  
And I cant do without you  
No way  
You see youre my everything  
So Im giving in  
Dont go nowhere  
  
Oh cant you see  
That I still care  
My love it is strong  
Dont go nowhere  
  
I need you  
Dont go nowhere  
I love you  
Dont go nowhere  
My heart yearns  
Dont go nowhere  
Can you understand me baby  
My love is all  
Dont go nowhere  
My heart is still fond  
Dont go nowhere  
Dont go nowhere  
Youre my only one
