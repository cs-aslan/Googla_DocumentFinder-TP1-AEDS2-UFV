Coming soon  
Something good  
Something we can share  
Understood  
Could be better news  
We can share  
Somethings coming soon  
I hear it everywhere  
  
live it its the story of our lives  
come give it its the way weve always been  
come give it though the mountains may divide  
come give it we can reach the sea  
  
I believe we can change  
We can make it more than a dream  
And I believe we can change  
Its not as strange as it might seem  
  
In the air I can feel  
Something magical becoming real  
From the other side looking in  
Come on throw the dice  
And tonight well win  
  
live it its the story of our lives  
come give it its the way weve always been  
come give it though the mountains may divide  
come give it we can reach the sea  
  
Repeat x2  
I believe we can change  
We can make it more than a dream  
And I believe we can change  
Its not as strange as it might seem  
  
Driving through the night  
Just you and me  
Faster than any light  
Somethings calling calling calling  
Calling us away  
Do you believe  
Heaven isnt that obvious  
Well be there in a heartbeat  
  
I believe we can change  
We can make it more than a dream  
And I believe we can change  
Its not as strange as it might seem  
  
Its not as strange as it might seem  
  
Repeat x3  
I believe we can change  
We can make it more than a dream  
And I believe we can change  
Its not as strange as it might seem
