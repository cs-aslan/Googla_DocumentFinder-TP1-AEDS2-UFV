Chorus x4  
You gotta go inward  
To experience the outer space  
That was built for you  
You gotta go inward  
  
Bridge  
Just picture the love  
Its pickin you up  
Your temple should buzz  
From the vibration of love  
  
Verse  
You see Id rather be a freq than not bein me  
Individuality makes life better  
See Id rather be a freq than not bein me  
The individuality makes life better  
  
Chorus x4  
You gotta go inward  
To experience the outer space  
That was built for you  
You gotta go inward  
  
Bridge  
Just picture the love  
Its pickin you up  
Your temple should buzz  
From the vibration of love
