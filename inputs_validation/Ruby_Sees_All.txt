Do you think shes swimming in your lies  
Do you think its all just murky green  
Dont you think that she would realize  
Yeah do you think she has never seen  
Cause when the seaweed sinks and the sun gets low  
When the waves retire to the darkness below  
I know I know Ruby sees all  
I know I know Ruby sees  
I can feel the pressure building high  
You should see youre headed for a storm  
Dont you see it building in the sky  
Dont you think its time to swim to shore  
Cause when the seaweed sinks and the sun gets low  
When the waves retire to the darkness below  
I know I know Ruby sees all  
I know I know Ruby sees all  
I know I know Ruby sees
