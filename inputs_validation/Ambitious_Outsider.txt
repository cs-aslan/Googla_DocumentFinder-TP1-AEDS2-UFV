Boltlock your doors  
Alarm your cars  
And still we move in closer  
Every day  
Top of the list  
Is your smiling kids  
But well be smiling too  
So thats ok  
Oh and by the way  
Thank you because youre  
Giving giving giving  
And were receiving   
No no were taking  
Keeping the population down  
Your taxes paid but  
Police waylaid  
And we knows  
When the school bus  
Comes and goes  
Were on your street but  
You dont see us  
Or if you do  
You smile and say Hello  
But dont underestimate us  
When you are  
Giving giving giving  
And were receiving   
No no were taking  
Were just keeping  
The population down  
Giving giving giving  
Well its your own fault  
For reproducing  
Were just keeping  
The population down
