Meth on deck man on deck  
For erything routine right here  
Routine Gambino thats that shit  
Yall thought it was over  
  
Yeah yo  
Im in the weed spot pounds of purp bowl of cereal  
Cartoons is on my favorite shit is The Smurfs  
Now I dont slip when Im down in the dirt  
cause by this time I done seen life  
and figured the amount that its worth  
Its the first cops is slippin for work  
Got my niggas all cuffed up sweatin like a hooker in church  
This old woman on her way to the church  
she said the neighborhoods fucked up  
and we the ones thats makin it worse  
Now thats fucked up  
I hit the block hard Timberlands is scuffed up  
No justice in the system look around its just us  
They tell me only God can judge us  
But they aint ever met Judge Kufner  
Im looking at this cracker on the bench  
Dont understand I only sold crack to pay the rent  
But thats possession with intent  
Player I aint stressin Im a pimp  
My bitches love the cocktail dressin with the shrimp  
  
Chorus  
Killa Hill Cause we do it like how we do it  
This is big truck style shit diesel fluid  
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang  
Stapletown Park Hill we just doing our thang  
  
Cmon yeah You fools dont have a clue do you  
Moving them kis crucial troopin like Isuzu  
Nigga your weed doo doo we burn that Cali kush  
My flow be on steroids that shit that Barry took  
Hurtin the game like the corns thats on your daddys foot  
My niggas carry big guns yall niggas carry books  
You shook niggas get stripped beated and wiped out  
Con Ed status like Fab nigga its Lights Out  
What your life bout Nigga my life plush  
I lost both of my parents my nigga life sucks  
Us Billy Boys hold toys cause they dont like us  
Raw like the nose on a fiend sniffin that white stuff  
Moving with the semi eggplant pennies  
Hoppin out the Bentley lookin like I just won an Emmy  
Never been a sloucher dog cause Im an alpha  
Male got that product on sale redeem your voucher  
Leader of the gang Im Spanky you Alfalfa  
Little Rascals with no hassle I will out ya  
Sincerely doubt ya and I will house ya  
Posted out in front of your crib just like a scalper  
  
Chorus  
  
Every time pick up the mic I put work down  
Cops dont like me cause I live in the murder town  
My high school homies sold crack through songs  
You cant get right through the team like two wrongs  
Mad criminal minded cream motherfuckers  
Type of subliminal rhymes scheme mothafuckers  
Cant shake the monkey life is a bitch  
Jake tried to jump me wifey a snitch  
Killa Bees wild like C74  
New York bitch adolescents at war  
Fuck the government yo they made us this way  
You a fagot listenin to what that chick say  
Escape route gotta be free like furlough  
Fuck hoes nigga I dont care if the world know  
Hardcore move with or without Clan  
Diss me in the cab and they murked your man  
Im a general don with the crazy hype game  
You dont like me wanna feel my knife game  
Killa Hill son they dont like where I live at  
Came from Hollywood so I fight to give back  
Real talk hard jeans and hard dick  
Move in and out of state like drugs and garbage  
Nigga feel me or nigga feel that blast  
ATF bitch just guns and cash  
  
Chorus  
  
Killa Hill Cause we do it like how we do it  
Trife Meth and Cap yo nothin to it  
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang  
Stapletown Park Hill we just doing our thang  
  
Straight up WuTang killa bees
