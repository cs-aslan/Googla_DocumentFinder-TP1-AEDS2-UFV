Winds gonna blow so Im gonna go  
Down on the road again  
Starting where the mountains left me  
Im up where I began  
Where I will go the wind only knows  
Good times around the bend  
Get in my car goin too far  
Never comin back again  
Tired and worn I woke up this mornin  
Found that I was confused  
Spun right around and found I had lost  
The things that I couldnt lose  
The beaches they sell to build their hotels  
My fathers and I once knew  
Birds all along sunlight at dawn  
Singing Waimanalo blues  
Down on the road with mountains so old  
Far on the country side  
Birds on the wing forget in a while  
So Im headed for the windward side  
All of your dreams sometimes it just seems  
That Im just along for the ride  
Some they will cry because they have pride  
For someone whos loved here died  
The beaches they sell to build their hotels  
My fathers and I once knew  
Birds all along sunlight at dawn  
Singing Waimanalo blues
