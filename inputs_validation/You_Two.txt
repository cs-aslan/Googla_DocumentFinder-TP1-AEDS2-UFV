Lets throw a twilight cookout  
We two you two no more  
Way out somewhere in the country  
Where weve never been before  
  
Lets throw it on a weekend  
We two you two no more  
And lounge away a holiday  
Like weve never done before  
  
Well bring the rounds and some jazzy sound  
To play by a cozy fire  
You two roast wieners and well toast the buns  
And well chow till the night grows nighter  
  
Well call for you on the weekend  
We two you two no more  
And ride out somewhere in the country air  
Just a cozy clan of four
