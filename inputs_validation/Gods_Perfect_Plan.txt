Theres plenty of food  
On the table  
Lots of love in the house  
The children all do what  
Theyre able to do  
We got so much to be happy about  
  
I got a woman standing beside me  
She really knows  
How to stand by her man  
Shes strong and shes soft  
And shes honest to me  
She really helps me  
To be a good man  
  
But nothing is perfect  
In Gods perfect plan  
Look in the shadow to see  
He only gave us the good things  
So wed understand  
What life without them would be  
  
Theres plenty of wheat  
On the prairies  
Lots of coal in the mines  
We got soldiers so strong  
They can bury their dead  
And still not go back  
Shooting blind  
  
Theres women and men  
On the workforce  
Doing forty hours  
Plus overtime  
So the hostages  
Held at the airport  
Can come home  
To something worthwhile  
  
But nothing is perfect  
In Gods perfect plan  
Look in the shadow to see  
He only gave us the good things  
So wed understand  
What life without them would be  
  
And theres plenty of food  
On the table  
Lots of love in the house  
The children all do  
What theyre able to do  
We got so much to be happy about  
  
I got a woman standing beside me  
She really knows  
How to stand by her man  
Shes strong and shes soft  
And shes honest to me  
It really helps me  
To be a good man  
  
But nothing is perfect  
In Gods perfect plan  
He only gave us the good things  
So wed understand  
No nothing is perfect  
In Gods perfect plan
