Pariah dogs and wandering madmen  
Barking at strangers and speaking in tongues  
The ebb and flow of tidal fortune  
Electrical changes are charging up the young  
  
Bridge  
Its a far cry from the world we thought wed inherit  
Its a far cry from the way we thought wed share it  
You can almost feel the current flowing  
You can almost see the circuits blowing  
  
Chorus  
One day I feel Im on top of the world  
And the next its falling in on me  
I can get back on  
I can get back on  
One day I feel Im ahead of the wheel  
And the next its rolling over me  
I can get back on  
I can get back on  
  
Whirlwind life of faith and betrayal  
Rise in anger fall back and repeat  
Slow degrees on the dark horizon  
Full moon rising lays silver at your feet  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
Its a far cry from the world we thought wed inherit  
You can almost see the circle growing  
You can almost feel the planets glowing  
  
Chorus  
  
One day I fly through a crack in the sky  
And the next its falling in on me  
I can get back on  
I can get back on  
  
Oh oh oh  
I can get back on  
I can get back on
