The sun comes up on another morning  
My mind never wakes up without you on it  
And its crazy to me I even see you in my dreams  
Is this meant to be Could be happening to me  
  
We were best of friends since we were this high  
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by  
We would be on the phone all day  
Now I cant find the words to say to you  
Now what Im supposed to do  
  
Could there be a possibility  
Im trying to say whats up  
Cause Im made for you and you for me  
Baby now is time for us  
Shall I give it all together  
But enough is enough  
They say were too young for love  
But Im catching feelings catching feelings  
  
In my head were already together  
Im cool alone but with you Im better  
I just wanna see you smile  
You say the word and Ill be right there  
I aint never going nowhere  
  
Im just trying to see where this can take us  
Cause everything about you girl is so contagious  
I think I finally got it done  
Now its left to do now lets get out the mirror  
And say it to her her yeah  
  
Could there be a possibility  
Im trying to say whats up  
Cause Im made for you and you for me  
Baby now is time for us  
Shall I give it all together  
But enough is enough  
They say were too young for love  
But Im catching feelings catching feelings  
  
Should I tell her how I really feel how I really feel  
Or should I moving closer just be still  
How would I know  
Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand  
Will everything change  
How do I know if she feels the same  
  
Could there be a possibility  
Im trying to say whats up  
Cause Im made for you and you for me  
Baby now is time for us  
Shall I give it all together  
But enough is enough  
They say were too young for love  
But Im catching feelings catching feelings  
  
Catching feelings catching feelings
