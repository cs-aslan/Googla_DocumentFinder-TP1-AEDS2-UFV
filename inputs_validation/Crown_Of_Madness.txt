My suit is mad Of human hair  
My shoes are made of skin  
My shirt is made of vaseline  
From my knees up to my chin  
My jewellery is obscene  
But most of all its fake  
My hat is made of solid gold  
Its the role I rightfully take  
Im wearing my crown of madness  
Yeah a new creation  
Im wearing my crown of madness  
Dont ask me to be faithful  
Dont ask me to be good  
Dont ask me to be generous  
I wouldnt if I could  
Dont ask me to be impolite  
You know I always will  
Dont ask me if Im well  
When you know Im always ill  
Im wearing my crown of madness  
Yeah a new creation  
Im wearing my crown of madness  
Dont ask me to be serious  
Its serious enough  
Dont try to make me understand  
Reality and stuff  
Dont push me to the limit  
Dont stretch your luck too far  
I know who I am  
Do you know who you are  
Mad mad mad oooh  
Im wearing my crown of madness  
Yeah a new creation  
Im wearing my crown of madness  
Mad mad mad mad
