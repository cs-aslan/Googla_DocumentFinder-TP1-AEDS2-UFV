Remember the first dance we shared  
Recall the night you melted my ugliness away  
The night you left with a kiss so kind  
Only a scent of beauty left behind  
  
Ah dear friend I remember the night  
The moon and the dreams we shared  
Your trembling paw in my hand  
Dreaming of that northern land  
Touching me with a kiss of a beast  
  
I know my dreams are made of you  
Of you and only for you  
Your ocean pulls me under  
Your voice tears me asunder  
Love me before the last petal falls  
  
As a world without a glance  
Of the oceans fair expanse  
Such the world would be  
If no love did flow in thee  
But as my heart is occupied  
Your love for me now has to die  
Forgive me I need more than you can offer me  
  
Didnt you read the tale  
Where happily ever after was to kiss a frog  
Dont you know this tale  
In which all I ever wanted  
Ill never have  
For who could ever learn to love a beast  
  
However cold the wind and rain  
Ill be there to ease your pain  
However cruel the mirrors of sin  
Remember beauty is found within  
  
Forever shall the wolf in me  
Desire the sheep in you
