My song is love  
Love to the lovers shone  
And it goes up  
You dont have to be alone  
  
Your heavy heart  
Is made of stone  
And its so hard to see you  
Clearly you dont have to be on your own  
You dont have to be on your own  
  
And Im not gonna take it back  
And Im not gonna say I dont mean that  
Youre the target that Im aiming at  
And Ill get that message home  
  
My song is love  
My song is love I know  
Im on fire for you  
Clearly you dont have to be alone  
You dont have to be on your own  
  
And Im not gonna take it back  
And Im not gonna say I dont mean that  
Youre the target that Im aiming at  
But Im nothing on my own  
Got to get that message home  
  
And Im not gonna stand and wait  
Not gonna leave it until its much too late  
On a platform Im gonna stand and say  
That Im nothing on my own  
And I love you please come home  
  
My song is love is love I know  
And Ive got to get that message home
