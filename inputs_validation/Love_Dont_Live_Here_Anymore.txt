Hold me darling you know that I really really love you  
  
Oh lady oh lady my heart is crying  
Cant holding back keep on trying  
You went out off that door  
Love dont live here anymore  
  
Oh let me oh let me explain  
Love dont live here anymore  
Oh let me oh let me explain  
Love dont live here anymore  
  
Troubles stole my paradise  
Was our love just blind   
Look what you have done to me my love  
You can still win back my heart  
Love can find a way  
Got my love lying in your hands  
Oh still I cant explain  
Why you went away  
So I ask again have you gonna stay  
I feel just the same  
Love might come again  
Emotion emotion  
  
Oh lady oh lady my one and only  
Youve been gone  
Im feeling so lonely  
You went out off that door  
Love dont live here anymore  
Oh let me oh let me explain  
Love dont live here anymore  
  
Hold me darling you know that I really really love you  
  
Could I ever love you more babe  
Than I did before  
See you through the eyes of love my love  
I gave everything how could you  
Were to blind to see  
But my love is still for you babe  
Still I cant explain  
Why you ran away  
So I ask again  
Have you gonna stay  
I feel just the same  
Love might come again  
Emotion emotion
