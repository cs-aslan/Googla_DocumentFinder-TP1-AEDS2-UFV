I am the crazy man  
Who lives inside your head  
But I think Im breaking through the wall  
  
You are the innocent  
Convicted of the crime  
No one was ever there  
To catch you when you fall  
  
I see the diamonds  
But you only see the rock  
I need to run  
But you only crawl  
  
Its time to open up  
All the doors that you keep locked  
Nobody gives without a take  
Lets take it all  
  
Youve been twisted into pieces  
By the hands of your emotions  
How much longer are you gonna pay  
For yesterday  
Sins of the father  
  
One more crucifixion  
One more cross to bear  
Youre a hole in a photograph  
  
Go on lose it in the city  
The city can feel no shame  
See the world with electric eye  
  
They call it mystery  
But any fool could see  
You thought he walked on the water  
  
And if the pain was gone  
And you were free to run away  
And get out  
  
Would you get out of there  
Or do you really care  
Its not safe or easy  
And maybe when youre gone  
You just wont belong at all  
  
Youre the only witness  
To the murder of an angel  
How much longer are you gonna pay  
For yesterday  
Sins of the father  
  
Its just another crucifixion  
One more cross to bear  
Go on lose it in the city  
Take a look at the world  
Youve got electric eyes
