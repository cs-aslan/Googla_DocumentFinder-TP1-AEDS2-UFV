Where I am what I am  
Youre the only reason  
Held me up filled my cup  
Had the faith in me and love  
  
Owe it all to you knowin were in love  
Theres nothing I cant do  
And Im not afraid to lose my way  
Cause if I walk a crooked street  
Youre there to lead me home  
  
Ive been through bad times  
And some times worse  
And till I met you happy was just a word  
But that all changed the day you came  
Now if I walk a crooked street  
Youre there to lead me home  
  
Guitar instrumental  
  
And Im not afraid to lose my way  
Cause if I walk a crooked street  
Youre there to lead me home  
If I walk a crooked street  
Youre there to lead me home
