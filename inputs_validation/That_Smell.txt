Whiskey bottles and brand new cars  
Oak tree youre in my way  
Theres too much coke and too much smoke  
Look whats going on inside you  
Ooooh that smell  
Cant you smell that smell  
Ooooh that smell  
The smell of death surrounds you  
  
Angel of darkness is upon you  
Stuck a needle in your arm  
So take another toke have a blow for your nose  
One more drink fool will drown you  
Ooooh that smell  
Cant you smell that smell  
Ooooh that smell  
The smell of death surrounds you  
  
Now they call you Prince Charming  
Cant speak a word when youre full of ludes  
Say youll be all right come tomorrow  
But tomorrow might not be here for you  
Ooooh that smell  
Cant you smell that smell  
Ooooh that smell  
The smell of death surrounds you  
  
Hey youre a fool you  
Stick them needles in your arm  
I know I been there before  
  
One little problem that confronts you  
Got a monkey on your back  
Just one more fix Lord might do the trick  
One hell of a price for you to get your kicks  
Ooooh that smell  
Cant you smell that smell  
Ooooh that smell  
The smell of death surrounds you  
Ooooh that smell  
Cant you smell that smell  
Ooooh that smell  
The smell of death surrounds you
