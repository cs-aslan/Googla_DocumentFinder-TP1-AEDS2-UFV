Well youve always been too slow  
And youve always been too late  
You should have known oh so long ago  
That your life is at stake  
  
Cause you never could keep up  
And you never read the signs  
Now you are turning dust to dust  
You are running out of time  
  
Cracking the whip  
Its a new kind of pain  
Cracking the whip  
Dont try in vain  
  
You were always in despair  
Seems like you were born to lose  
Now youre dying no one cares  
Cannon on the loose  
  
Looks like you missed the boat  
And you didnt catch that train  
Now youre crying and trying in vain  
Cant take the pain  
  
Cracking the whip  
Its a new kind of pain  
Cracking the whip  
Dont try in vain  
  
Cracking the whip  
Its a new kind of pain  
Cracking the whip  
Dont try in vain  
  
Cracking the whip  
Cracking the whip  
Cracking the whip  
Its a new kind of pain  
Cracking the whip  
Dont try in vain
