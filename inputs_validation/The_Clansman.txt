Wake alone in the hills  
With the wind in your face  
It feels good to be proud  
And be free and a race  
That is part of a clan  
And to live on highlands  
And the air that you breathe  
So pure and so clean  
  
When alone on the hills  
With the wind in your hair  
With a longing to feel  
Just to be free  
  
Is it right to believe  
In the need to be free  
Its a time when you die  
And without asking why  
Cant you see what they do  
They are grinding us down  
They are taking our land  
That belongs to the clans  
  
Not alone with a dream  
Just want to be free  
With a need to belong  
I am a clansman  
Freedom  
  
Its a time wrought with fear  
Its a land wrought with change  
  
Ancestors could hear  
What is happening now  
They would turn in their graves  
They would all be ashamed  
That the land of the free  
Has been written in chains  
And I know what I want  
  
When the timing is right  
Then Ill take what is mine  
I am the clansman  
  
And I swear to defend  
And well fight to the end  
And I swear that Ill never  
Be taken alive  
And I know that well stand  
And well fight for our land  
And I swear that my bairns Will be born free  
  
And I know what I want  
When the timing is right  
Then Ill take what I want  
I am the clansman  
Freedom  
  
And I know what I want When the timing is right  
Then Ill take what is mine I am the clansman  
  
No no we cant let them take anymore  
No we cant let them take anymore  
Weve the land of the free  
Freedom  
  
Is it right to believe  
In the need to be free  
Its a time when you die  
And without asking why  
Cant you see what they do  
They are grinding us down  
They are taking our land  
That belongs to the clans  
  
Not alone with a dream  
Just want to be free  
With a need to belong  
I am a clansman  
  
And I know what I want  
When the timing is right  
Then Ill take what is mine  
I am the clansman  
Freedom
