Do you remember the first time and all of your sweet sweet talk  
Aint heard it a lot since then love  
Now look at that guy hes making me cry  
He leaves everybody and he only says goodbye  
But if I would have to choose I wouldnt let you go  
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
Darling I know  
  
We gotta have patience  
Love isnt just a sensation  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isnt easy but it sure is hard enough  
sweet sweet our love is bittersweet  
Giving love is a reason for living  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isnt easy but it sure is hard enough  
sweet sweet our love is bittersweet  
  
From the first moment I saw you Ive treated you like a queen  
Ive given you lots of presents  
Now listen to that just look at that cat  
Youd think he was an angel but hes talking through his hat  
But if I would have to choose I wouldnt let you go  
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
Darling I know  
  
We gotta have patience  
Love isnt just a sensation  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isnt easy but it sure is hard enough
