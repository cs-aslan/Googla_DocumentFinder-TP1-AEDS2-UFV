Chastity Sun you are the one  
That can make me smile  
When Im feeling sad  
You come close to me  
And my heart goes running free  
You are the proof God lives  
You are his gift to me  
  
Sweet baby girl  
You make my world  
Bright and shinning new  
When I look at you  
In your eyes I see  
The world that God meant to be  
Theres no hate or angry  
Just love for humanity  
  
Well have children of the kingdom  
They wont be torn by war torn by hate  
Nor will they hesitate to love  
  
Chastity Sun we are as one  
You have come from me  
Youre the fruit Im the tree  
I am trying so  
But Ive got so far to go  
Ive got so much to teach you  
And so much myself to know  
  
Sweet baby one  
You bring the sun in a simple way  
With the things you say  
In my smile or tears  
Such innocents in your heart  
You make up Gods great circle  
Cause I am the end and youre the start  
  
Well have children of the kingdom  
They wont be torn by war  
Nor will they kill or hate  
Or hesitate to love
