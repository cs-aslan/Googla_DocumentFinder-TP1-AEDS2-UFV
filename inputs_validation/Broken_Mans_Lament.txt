I was once a broken man  
I was once a broken fool  
Lost my wife and children  
To one basic broken rule  
Now I live my life in silence  
Tho Im not quite in a shell  
Drink and listen to that song  
A whiter shade of pale  
A whiter shade of pale  
  
I was good shad tree mechanic  
So I send myself to school  
They smoothed off my rough edges  
In my hands they put new tools  
The instructor once he told me  
I could work on any line  
I could tend and make any diesel sing  
Just like Patsy Cline  
Just like Patsy Cline  
  
Well I met my wife to be  
Through my mothers best friends son  
She had been a bar room singer  
She was as good as anyone  
But I ask her to stop singing  
And the girl she did not flinch  
Next day she went and bought that man  
A brand new crescent wrench ohh  
A brand new crescent wrench  
  
We had three fine children  
As eight years went on by  
And earned a silver visor  
The knuckles stayed bone dry  
But after supper I kept hearin her  
By the kitchen radio  
Singing sweet but desperate harmony  
A little bit to low ohhh  
A little bit to low  
  
She left three months later  
Id just come home for lunch  
Note said easy come hard go  
I still love you so much  
She said I dont know if Ill be there  
Or if youll want me when I come  
But if and when that Abbott steer  
You better  
Let my sweet dream run ohhh  
Let my sweet dream run  
  
Ohhhhohhhohhhohhh

But now the diesels arent the only thing that sing  
Just like Patsy Cline
