Spark and Cindy live by their own means  
They wouldnt have if I only  
Knowd where theyd been  
And I want to make things a part of my life  
And I want to see that  
Things are going to be right  
But if you cant even  
Stand on your feet  
And if you dont own the  
Air that you breathe  
Then its not for me to say  
  
But I wouldnt live that way  
And I wouldnt stand apart  
And I wouldnt find the real  
And I wouldnt play a part  
And I wouldnt find in love  
So misguided by some fool  
And just what Im trying t say  
Makes my head spin round the room  
  
Repeats from 3rd line onwards
