Seen you before I know your sort  
You think the world awaits your every breath  
Youll be my friend or so you say  
Youll help me out when the time comes  
  
And all the time were getting rich  
You hang around to help me out  
  
But when were skint oh God forbid  
You drop us like hot bricks  
  
Artistic freedom Do what you want  
But just make sure that the money aint gone  
  
Ill tell you what I got you sussed  
Youll waste my time when my time comes
