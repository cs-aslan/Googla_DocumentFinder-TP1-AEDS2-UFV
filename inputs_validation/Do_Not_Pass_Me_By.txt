Pass me not oh gentle Savior  
Hear my humble cry  
While the others Thou are calling  
Do not pass me by  
Ive got the feelin and the feelins not the same  
I did the hip hop a little Hammer and the James  
But a touch a touch from up above  
And I get the feelin the feelin of Your love  
Reachin out callin for Your people  
Reachin out  
To keep us all safe from a world thats full of evil  
Tryin cryin Lord sometimes Im cryin  
When I think of His gifts and the world just keeps denying  
When I think of His goodness  
And what Hes done for me  
My soul cries Hallelujah  
Thanks for savin me sing  
Savior Savior why dont You  
Hear my humble cry  
While the others Thou are calling  
Do not pass me by  
Dance break  
I dont want the Lord to pass me by  
I dont want the Lord to pass me by  
I dont want the Lord to pass me by  
I dont want the Lord to pass me by  
I dont want the Lord to pass me by  
I dont want the Lord to pass me by  
I dont want the Lord to pass me by  
I I need Him at home  
At work at school  
Do you need Him  
I know you need Him  
While the others Thou are calling  
Do not pass me by  
Do not pass me by
