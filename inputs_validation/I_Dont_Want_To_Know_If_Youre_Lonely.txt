Verse  
Im curious to know exactly how you are  
I keep my distance but that distance is too far  
It reassures me just to know that youre okay  
But I dont want you to go on needing me this way  
Chorus  
And I  
Dont wanna know if you are lonely  
Dont wanna know if you are less than lonely  
Dont wanna know if you are lonely  
Dont wanna know dont want to know  
Verse 2  
The day you left me left me feeling oh so bad  
Still Im not sure about all the doubts we had  
From the beginning we both knew it wouldnt last  
Decisions have been made the die has been cast  
Chorus  
Bridge  
Verse 3  
The phone is ringing and the clock says 4 am  
If its your friends well I dont wanna hear from them  
So leave your number and a message at the tone  
Or you can just go on and leave me here alone  
Chorus
