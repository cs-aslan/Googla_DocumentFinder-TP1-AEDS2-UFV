Stand in the window  
Close to the edge  
As the neon signs surrender to the light of day  
I sip a bitter cup of coffee  
And I fade away oh I fade away  
Theres a cross above my pillow  
Curse words on the wall  
What Id give to write the pages of my life again  
No I cant believe this is the way  
The story ends oh is this the end is this the end  
I wanna run to the highest mountain  
I wanna stand in the light of the sun  
I wanna ask all this world to forgive the man that Ive become  
And now I call on the angels above  
Wont somebody hear wont somebody hear  
My cry of love  
Got a shoe box full of letters  
Got a ring that I should pawn  
Theres a picture on the table of the way we were  
I wish to God I could forget  
But I still think of her I think of her  
Oh I think of her  
I wanna run to the highest mountain  
I wanna stand in the light of the sun  
I wanna ask all this world to forgive the man that Ive become  
And now I call on the angels above  
Wont somebody hear wont somebody hear  
My cry of love  
Wont anybody listen to me  
Can anybody hear my prayer  
Wont anybody listen to my cry of love  
Wont anybody listen to my cry of love  
Wont anybody listen to my cry of love  
I wanna ask all this world to forgive  
The man that Ive become  
And so I call on the angels above  
Wont somebody hear wont somebody hear  
My cry of love  
Wont anybody listen to me  
Can anybody hear my prayer  
Wont anybody listen to me  
Does anybody really care  
My cry of love
