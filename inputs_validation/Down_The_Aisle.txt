Yeah uhhuh  
I cant believe it  
  
Chorus  
Finally Im walking down that aisle  
No need for the coping now  
I found the perfect partner waiting for me at the altar  
Made a vow before God to love me  
And finally Im walking down that aisle  
I will never second guess us how  
When were laughing together and were crying together  
Having kids together my life begins right now  
  
Finally the day has arrived  
Im standing at the altar youre walking down the aisle  
My heart skips a beat emotions run wild  
Half of me is crying the other half smiles  
I can feel my stomach turnin and tossin and goin through it  
I just cant believe it Im really bout to do it  
Take the vow to be together forever  
Plus promise Ima be there whenever wherever  
Through the ups and downs through the darkest clouds  
Side by side in the rain til the sun comes out  
I was blind to love God showed me you  
Now Im standin here shakin bout to say I do  
And I do  
  
Chorus  
  
Butterflies my palms are sweaty  
Its a lifetime commitment I pray that Im ready  
But your eyes tell me not to worry youre sincere  
Cant turn back now destinys why Im here  
Our friends laugh as I take you by the hand  
But they single and this a feeling that they dont understand  
Youre my partner for life Ima treat you right  
Our honeymoons forever not just tonight  
Knew the time was right to be husband and wife  
Us both dressed alike in the purest white  
Such a beautiful gown friends and family around  
Ignore the cold feet now time to take these vows  
  
Chorus  
  
Its a beautiful and heavenly day  
As the pastor asks Who gives this woman away  
Your father says I do and gives me a hand  
Plus the tough guy and I completely understand  
He losin a diamond and now youre mine and  
He dont have to worry Im a keep you shinin  
Im a build us a future Im a keep on climbin  
With our family on my back cause thats my assignment  
Im a work overtime make sure yall live  
But still find time for you and homework with the kids  
Took a long time to learn I was so hardheaded  
But you stuck with me and you wont regret it I do  
  
Chorus  
  
And I do I do  
Baby I do I do  
Baby I do  
We made a vow baby  
I do I do  
Baby I do I do  
Baby I do  
Find that perfect partner yeah yeah I do  
Waiting for me at the altar  
And I make a vow before God to love you  
Finally Im walking down that aisle  
Ill never second guess you
