Walking down the sidewalk one purple afternoon  
I was accosted by a barker  
Playing a simple tune upon his flute  
Toot toot toot toot  
Silver rain was falling down  
Upon the dirty ground of London town  
  
People pass me by on my imaginary street  
Ordinary people its impossible to meet  
Holding conversations that are always incomplete  
Well I dont know  
  
Oh where are there places to go  
Someone somewhere has to know  
Idont know  
  
Out of work again the actor entertains his wife  
With the same old stories of his ordinary life  
Maybe he exaggerates the trouble and the strife  
Well I dont know  
  
Oh where are there places to go  
Someone somewhere has to know  
  
Crawling down the pavement on a Sunday afternoon  
I was arrested by a rozzer  
Wearing a pink balloon about his foot  
Toot toot toot toot  
Silver rain was falling down  
Upon the dirty ground of London town  
  
Someone somewhere has to know  
Silver rain was falling down  
Upon the dirty ground of London town
