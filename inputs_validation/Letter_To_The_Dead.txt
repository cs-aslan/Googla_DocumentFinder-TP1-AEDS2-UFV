Every photograph is peeling  
The colors turn to gray this day  
There is always memories for days these days  
An undertow of futures laid to waste embraced  
By the loss of one he could not replace  
And theres no reason that shed pass  
And there is no god with the plan its sad  
And his holiness is proof its said  
He could only know how you have sinned  
The world swings through a passing fable  
A fate we made a way we say  
Holding on live within our own ways  
He lit a match he laid in bed  
Hoping their dreams will bring her back its sad  
And his holiness is proof they said  
He could only love you its said  
Oh in his last breath believing  
Hell make his way  
If shes not forgotten  
Hes haunted  
Hes searching for escape  
If just one wish could bring her back its sent  
And his holiness is proof its said  
He will always love you he said
