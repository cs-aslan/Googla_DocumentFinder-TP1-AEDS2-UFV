If I had my druthers Id go fishing  
Find myself a lake and a lazy day  
If I had my druthers Id quit wishing  
Get off the old caboose get on my way  
  
Give me whole lots of laughter  
Great big barrels of fun  
Nighttime full of romance  
Daytime full of fun  
  
If I had my druthers Id go flying  
Looking for the things Id like to see  
If I had my druthers Id be trying trying  
The only way to be what I cant be  
  
Give me somebody to love me  
Make me feel like the only one  
Something thats worth doing more  
I feel good when its worked  
  
If I had my druthers Id go sailing  yes I would  
Catch me camping out on the open sea  
If I had my druthers Id be singing  
Just how good this good life feels to me  feels so good  
  
It just needs someone to talk to  
Something you cant share  
You dont need no reason for living long  
Its already there  yes it is  ooh ooh  
  
It makes me giggle  
I cant sit down
