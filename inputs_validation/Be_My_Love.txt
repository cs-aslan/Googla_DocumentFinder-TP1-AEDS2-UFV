Be my love for no one else can end this yearning  
This need that you and you alone create  
Just fill my arms the way youve filled my dreams  
The dreams that you inspire with evry sweet desire  
Be my love and with your kisses set me burning  
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate  
And hand in hand well find loves promised land  
Therell be no one but you for me eternally  
If you will be my love  
  
Be my love for no one else can end this yearning  
This need that you and you alone create  
Just fill my arms the way youve filled my dreams  
The dreams that you inspire with evry sweet desire  
Be my love and with your kisses set me burning  
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate  
And hand in hand well find loves promised land  
Therell be no one but you for me eternally
