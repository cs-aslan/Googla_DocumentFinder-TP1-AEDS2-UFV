Watch him ride into the sunset  
Hed have the little fat guy  
Right along his side  
Echoing off the canyon Hey Cisco  
From Pancho n pretty soon  
The black sombrero would reply  
Hey Pancho whats happening mi amigo  
Its getting somewhere near the end  
This winding trail  
When weve raced around the corner  
For the final dusty time  
Mr Renaldo n Carillos  
Going to jail  
  
Cant open no more supermarkets  
Duncans sombreros hanging  
Up there with his guns  
Some cigarro sucking slag  
Under a cheap Hollywood chandelier  
Says Cisco Kid you know  
Your day is done  
Let me know how you are doin  
Mr Renaldo  
If you need me I could be  
A friend for life  
There dont seem any point  
We should throw way  
All these years  
Why dont we saddle up  
And ride out one more time  
  
What they doing to my friend  
What they doing to my man  
Dont matter when  
Ill stay to the end  
Hey Cisco  
Lets go out in style  
Were going down together
