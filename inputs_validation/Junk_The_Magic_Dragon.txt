Junk the Magic Dragon  
  
Mellow yellow acid kiss  
Warhol painted calliotrips  
Spining spining spin again  
Coke tar crystal methane thrill  
Cash in dime for a ride  
My brain like eggs is cracked and fried  
Cash in dime for a ride  
My brain like eggs is cracked and fried  
  
Junk the magic dragon  
Lives in my pain  
Junk the magic dragon yeah  
Love will always end it ends in pain  
  
Love is pain  
Pain is love  
My souls got a love for dragons blood  
  
Bones are pulled so tight on skin  
Like canvas tent poles or something  
I need a smile on my lips  
Oh but it gives incentives  
  
Cash in dime for a ride  
My brain like eggs is cracked and fried  
Cash in dime for a ride  
My stone black jeans look just real fine  
  
Junk the magic dragon  
Lives in my pain  
Junk the magic dragon yeah  
Love will always end it ends in pain  
  
  
Love is pain  
Pain is love  
My souls got a love for dragons blood
