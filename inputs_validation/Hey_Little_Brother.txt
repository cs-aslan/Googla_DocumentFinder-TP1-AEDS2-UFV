Hey Little Brother  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
Chorus  
Hey little brother welcome back home  
Its good to see you again  
Hey little brother welcome back home  
To your family and your friends  
Chorus  
Now you do not know  
What your Fathers been through  
At night He would call out your name  
Then for hours untold  
He would stare down the road  
Praying youd come home again  
Chorus  
I must confess I was quite envious  
When I heard what Father planned to do  
But after I talked to Him  
I realized I had been  
Almost as far from home as you  
I was almost as far from home as you so  
  
Chorus  
Oh dear brother run into my arms  
And tell me you are home to stay  
For there is no other Father like ours  
And were so glad youre here today  
Yes were so glad youre here today  
Chorus repeat
