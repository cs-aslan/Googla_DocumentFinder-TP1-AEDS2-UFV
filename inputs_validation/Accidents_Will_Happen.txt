The likes of you may never be attracted to the likes of me  
But accidents will happen and Ill be around  
And maybe therell be no one else but me around  
Forevermore may never start you may ignore my hopeful heart  
And chances are not the one to make you fall  
But accidents will happen after all  
A smile may show it your eyes may glow  
Before you know it Im sure Ill know  
So if you fall in just that way oh wouldnt I be thrilled to hear you say  
I had a lovely accident today  
Your eyes may glow Im sure Ill know
