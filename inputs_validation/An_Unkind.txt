We see the vipers of distance  
Crawl into our lives everyday  
Breeding our Edens of hatred  
Pathetically stupid and unkind  
We couldnt look a saint in the eye  
  
On the storm  
Its time to go  
On the storm  
Its time to go  
  
Marching in lines of contradiction  
Forgetting the history we make  
Loving our hangmen as the penultimate joke  
We lack the Moses to look  
A saint in the eye
