Well the very first time  
I saw you darling  
Not one single word  
Would come to my lips  
  
Yes the very first time  
I saw you darling  
Not one single word  
Would come to my lips  
  
You see I was so afraid  
You wouldnt love me  
I want to tell you right now  
I was frightened right down  
To my fingertips  
  
So baby when you went away  
That unlucky day last September  
I was like a little lost boy  
In the wilderness  
Baby baby baby  
When you went away  
I was like a little lost boy  
In the wilderness  
  
And Ive just been sitting here  
Thinking of everybody  
Ive ever known  
Well you know  
I still love you the best  
Yeah the best
