Rolls and flows of angel hair  
Ice cream castles in the air  
Feather canyons everywhere  
Ive looked at clouds that way  
But now they only block the sun  
They rain they snow on everyone  
So many things I wouldve done  
But clouds got in my way  
  
Ive looked at clouds from both sides now  
From up and down and still somehow  
Its clouds illusions I recall  
I really dont know clouds at all  
  
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels  
The dizzy dancing way you feel  
As every fairy tale comes real  
Ive looked at love that way  
But now its just another show  
Leave em laughin when you go  
But if you care dont let em know  
Dont give yourself away  
  
Ive looked at love from both sides now  
From give and take and still somehow  
Its loves illusions I recall  
I really dont know love at all  
  
Tears and fears and feeling proud  
Say I love you right out loud  
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds  
Ive looked at life that way  
But now old friends are acting strange  
They shake their heads and say Ive changed  
But somethings lost when somethings gained  
Living everyday  
  
Ive looked at life from both sides now  
From win and lose and still somehow  
Its lifes illusions I recall  
I really dont know life at all
