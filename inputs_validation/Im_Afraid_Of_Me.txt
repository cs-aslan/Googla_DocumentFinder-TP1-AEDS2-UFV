Some days in more ways  
I need the distractions  
Fire desire love and reaction  
He must be someone  
Yes even me  
Something for nothing  
Some wish to see  
Life beyond reason  
  
Who will I be who will I be  
Im afraid of me  
Im afraid of me  
  
Always survive days  
Cut and discretion  
Touched in a sane way  
Leave no impression  
  
He must be someone  
Yes even you  
Fool my direction  
Some wish to see  
Love without treason  
Who will love me who will love me  
  
Chorus  
Im afraid of me  
Im afraid of me  
Afraid to love you  
Im afraid of me  
Im afraid of me  
  
Some days in more ways  
I need the distractions  
Fire desire love and reaction  
He must be someone  
Yes even me  
Something for nothing  
Some wish to see  
Life beyond reason  
  
Who will I be who will I be  
Always survive days  
Cut and discretion  
Touched in a sane way  
Leave no impression  
He must be someone  
  
Yes even you  
Fool my direction  
Some wish to see  
Love without treason  
Who will love me who will love me  
  
Chorus
