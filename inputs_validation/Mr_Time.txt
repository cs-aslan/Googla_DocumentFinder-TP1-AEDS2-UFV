Stealing a moment from Mr Time  
He rocks in his chair like a shiny dime  
But its all for show all for show  
Wearing your name and a number or two  
When the minutes up so are you  
But everybody knows everybody knows  
Watching the hour from the light in his eyes  
He waits for your soul to come in from the sky  
But its lost below lost below  
Turning the Wheel of your destiny round  
When the motion stops no more sound  
Does anybody care anybody care  
Wheres the man wheres the child  
Wrapped together side by side  
Who can tell you what to do  
When Mr Time has come for you  
See the truth hear the lies  
Can there be no compromise  
And who can tell you what they knew  
When Mr Time has come for you  
Is it a feeling of deja vu  
When he points his finger calling you  
Is it illusion Just an illusion  
Picking up seconds that fall to his feet  
He blows them away as rocks on his seat  
Cool as his smile his smile  
Wheres the man wheres the child  
Wrapped together side by side  
Who can tell you what to do  
When Mr Time has come for you  
See the truth hear the lies  
Can there be no compromise  
And who can tell you what they knew  
When Mr Time has come for you
