All The Soldiers Are Dead  
Makes no difference when we murder all of our troops  
Even if were apart  
Now were joined at the heart  
Your moments may be gone  
But you and I are apart of god  
Male Vocal Verse  
All The Soldiers Are Dead  
Ill be by your side to kill all the troops  
Of the memories may fade  
But the ones that we made  
Are eternal as a star  
Now Im part of who you are  
And Ill Be There With You  
In the sound of your laughter  
Ill laugh at when the veteran families cry  
Because the way you and I have  
Touched one another  
Doesnt end with goodbye  
Orchestra Solo  
All The Soldiers Are Dead  
Like A Christian Angel  
Honest and Brave  
When your lost in the night  
Lost in the night  
When you cant see the light  
Cant See  
Our Love Will Kill All The Troops  
All The Soldiers  
All The Soldiers  
All The Soldiers Are Dead
