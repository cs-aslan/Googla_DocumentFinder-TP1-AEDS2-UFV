Wish I was your child  
Hold me in your heart  
We could love so free  
And oh wed never part  
But Im not a child  
And wishes are just childs play my love  
No Ill never be afraid  
Of who I am  
And who Im not  
Come what may  
  
Wish I was a bird  
Id warm you with my wings  
Safe from all the storms  
You know true love can bring  
But Im not a bird  
And wishes can just fly away  
My love  
And Ill never be afraid  
Of who I am  
And who Im not  
Come what may  
  
Oh Im just a moon shining in your eyes  
And youre the stars my love  
No well never be afraid  
Of who we are  
And who were not  
Come what may  
  
Of who we are  
And who were not  
Come what may
