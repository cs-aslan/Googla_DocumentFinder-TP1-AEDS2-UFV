Ive got strange ways  
But it wont take long my friend  
Im telling you someday baby  
Ill be gone  
  
Ive got strange ways but  
It wont take long my friend  
Im telling you someday baby  
Ill be back  
  
Again Ive got no one  
But it wont take long my friend  
Im telling you someday baby  
Ill be gone Im telling you someday Ill be gone  
  
God bless you for being  
By my side when I fell through  
You could hear me youve got  
Internet gateways through my world  
God bless you Im feeling all the  
  
Force youre closing in  
Take it easy  
You dock at my side when  
Im on fire  
Ive got strange ways  
  
Sometimes I lose it I lose  
Dont know where Im going dont know  
But I do hope you follow  
All the way  
  
God bless you for being  
By my side when I fell through  
You could hear me  
Youve got Internet gateways  
Through my world  
You dont know it  
Youre turning all this stone into a heart  
I can see you  
As youre fighting the fire  
When I burn  
Ive got Im telling you someday baby  
Ill be gone back
