Youve chosen me oh no  
When it happens  
Ive chosen you I dont know  
When it happens  
  
Changes my life to a love song  
This love is so strong  
Youve chosen me  
And now that I Ive  
  
Ive chosen you  
Oh oh my love  
Let it happen  
Changing my life to a love song  
  
Changing my life to a love song  
This road is so long  
Im a runaway train going off the rails  
My love is so strong  
  
I dont know why if you  
Youve chosen me  
Oh pass my way  
If it happens
