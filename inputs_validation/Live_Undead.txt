Cascaded darkness  
Walls close in on me  
Nailed shut but my eyes still see  
Severe anguish as my body evolves  
The pain of life after death it resolves  
  
Emptiness in twilights rebirth  
The faint sounds of shoveled earth  
Madness growing as your mind dissolves  
Merely secret in my dreams  
  
Night grows cold twilights near  
On the edge of madness the wounds are sheared  
Forms of hanging flesh shredded carcass  
No spared breath  
  
Imprisoned in a shell ready to explode  
Dead soul  
Stone cold  
Out into the night  
  
Voices inside my head  
Hold me under  
Voices oppress  
Like roaring thunder  
  
An echo bouncing inside my brain  
How much can I take of the pain  
The pain  
  
A war raging deep inside my head  
A split decision that will end with me dead  
  
You see the agony in my eyes  
Protruding aimless  
I think its time to die  
  
A cannibals desire feeds the fire  
That burns in your head  
  
Intense pain eats away at your brain  
Thorazine pumping through your veins  
  
Death walks inside you  
Smell death around you  
Hells evil spell takes a soul  
Hear the sound of the bell  
Counting off death tolls  
  
Laughing as you eternally rot  
Searching for human flesh  
And lifes blood  
  
Live Undead
