How can I tell you  
That I love you  
I love you  
But I cant think of right words to say  
  
I long to tell you  
That Im always thinking of you  
Im always thinking of you  
But my words just blow away  
Just blow away  
  
It always ends up to one thing honey  
And I cant think of right words to say  
  
Wherever I am girl  
Im always walking with you  
Im always walking with you  
But I look and youre not there  
  
Whoever Im with  
Im always always talking to you  
Im always talking to you  
And Im sad that you cant hear  
Sad that you cant hear  
  
It always ends up to one thing honey  
When I look and youre not there  
  
I need to know you  
Need to feel my arms around you  
Feel my arms around you  
Like a sea around a shore  
  
Each night and day I pray  
In hope that I might find you  
In hope that I might find you  
Because hearts can do no more  
Can do no more  
  
It always ends up to one thing honey  
Still I kneel upon the floor  
  
How can I tell you  
That I love you  
I love you  
But I cant think of right words to say  
  
I long to tell you  
That Im always thinking of you  
Im always thinking of you  
  
It always ends up to one thing honey  
And I cant think of right words to say
