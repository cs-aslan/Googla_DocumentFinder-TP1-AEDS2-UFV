Well here you come again  
Claiming to be my long lost friend  
I can tell youre wearing thin  
Youre trying to play those same old evil tricks again  
  
No no nobody  
Not even you babe  
No no nobody  
Is gonna do the things you used to do  
  
A wise man tried to warn me  
But I would not hear a word  
Just cant say that I feel badly  
About all the bridges I have burned  
  
No no nobody  
Not even you babe  
No no nobody  
Is gonna do the things you used to do  
  
If you knew someone like I know you  
You can hear their footsteps  
And know exactly who they are  
You aint worthy my time or money  
Much less my heart  
Yet here you are again  
Who the hell do you think you are  
  
Youve got a million dollar smile  
And a halfadollar soul  
Youre a living lesson baby  
And your storys getting old  
  
No no nobody  
Not even you babe  
No no nobody  
Is gonna do the things you used to do
