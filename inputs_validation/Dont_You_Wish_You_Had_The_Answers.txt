Look out your window see the earth  
Where did it come from who gave it birth  
Where did it come from where will it go where will it go  
Dont you wish you had the answers well I know  
See how the rain falls who made the sky  
Its never ending and you wonder why  
Where did it come from where will it go where will it go  
Dont you wish you had the answers well I know  
Just look out past the stars look to the one who put them there  
He he made them all and he gave them to us to share  
Yes he made them all and hes gonna take them all back someday  
Dont you just wonder what lies ahead  
Theres peace in knowing what jesus said  
Where did you come from where will you go where will you go  
Dont you wish you had the answers  
Dont you wish you had the answers  
Dont you wish you had the answers  
Well I know
