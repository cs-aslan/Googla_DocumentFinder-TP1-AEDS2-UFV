Who can I count on  
If I cant count on you  
I never counted on you  
Makin me blue  
They say your a runnin round  
With somebody new  
Who can I count on  
If I cant count on you  
  
I thought I held a precious key to heaven  
Your love was sweet and gentle at the start  
But now I feel that I cant go on livin  
If livin means that we must live apart  
  
Who can I count on  
If I cant count on you  
There goes my happiness  
And here comes the blues  
I cant convince myself that  
Were really through  
Who can I count on  
If I cant count on you  
  
The door to happiness was almost open  
Just one more step or two and Id be in  
Then all at once the vows you made were broken  
The door to happiness was closed again  
  
Who can I count on  
If I cant count on you  
There goes my happiness  
And here comes the blues  
I cant convince myself  
That were really through  
Who can I count on  
If I cant count on you  
Who can I count on  
Who can I count on  
Who can I count on  
If I cant count on you
