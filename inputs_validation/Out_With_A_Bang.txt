Little bits and pieces falling through the corners  
Box of broken lices lined up in an order  
Ill do what you tell me we can have it your way  
Ill tell you your future you tell me your story  
Im going out with a bang  
Im going out with a bang  
Im going out with a bang  
  
Smiles from the stranger seem to change the day when  
You were just about to go ant throw your towel in  
Lately Ive been thinking bout making changes  
Its been on my mind for some time and Im anxious  
Im going out with a bang  
Im going out with a bang  
Im going out with a bang  
  
 like the sunshine set on  
Happy like a twister over akaluma  
Clear as penny mason lying in a coma  
This is our feeling all my hurt is over  
Im going out with a bang  
Im going out with a bang  
Im going out with a bang  
  
Meet me in the morning wrap your arms around me  
Tell me that its over now that you have found me  
Walk me to the river see the willow  
Carry me into the water now were drowning  
Were going out with a bang  
Were going out with a bang  
Were going out with a bang  
Were gonna go home again  
Ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta  
Ta ta ta ta da da ra ra
