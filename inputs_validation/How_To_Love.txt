Turn the music up  
A lil louder yeah  
  
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart  
Never really had luck couldnt never figure out  
How to love how to love  
How to love how to love  
Mm you had a lot of moments that didnt last forever  
Now you in the corner tryna put it together  
How to love how to love  
How to love how to love  
  
Mm for a second you were here now you over there  
Its hard not to stare the way you moving your body  
Like you never had a love had a love  
Never had love had a love  
  
When you was just a youngin your looks were so precious  
But now your grown up so fly its like a blessing  
But you cant have a man look at you for five seconds  
Without you being insecure  
You never credit yourself so when you got older  
Its seems like you came back ten times over  
Now youre sitting here in this damn corner  
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder  
  
See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart  
Never really had luck couldnt never figure out  
How to love how to love how to love  
How to love how to love how to love  
Mm see you had a lot of moments that didnt last forever  
Now you in this corner tryna put it together  
How to love how to love  
How to love how to love  
  
Mm for a second you were here now you over there  
Its hard not to stare the way you moving your body  
Like you never had a love had a love  
How to love how to love  
  
Ooh you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions  
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions  
But it wasnt your fault wasnt in your intentions  
To be the one here talking to me be the one listening  
  
But I admire your poppin bottles and dippin  
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin  
Baby so dont be mad nobody else trippin  
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook  
  
You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart  
Never really had luck couldnt never figure out  
How to love how to love  
How to love how to love  
Mm see you had a lot of moments that didnt last forever  
Now you in this corner tryna put it together  
How to love how to love  
How to love how to love  
  
Ooh see I just want you to know You to know  
That you deserve the best  
Youre beautiful youre beautiful  
Yeah and I want you to know  
Youre far from the usual far from the usual  
  
You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart  
Never really had luck couldnt never figure out  
How to love how to love  
How to love how to love  
Mm see you had a lot of moments that didnt last forever  
Now you in this corner tryna put it together  
How to love how to love

Now you in this corner tryna put it together  
How to love how to love
