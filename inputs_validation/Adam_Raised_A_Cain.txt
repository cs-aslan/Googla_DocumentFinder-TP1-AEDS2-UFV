In the summer that I was baptized my father held me to his side  
As they put me to the water he said how on that day I cried  
We were prisoners of love a love in chains  
He was standin in the door I was standin in the rain  
With the same hot blood burning in our veins  
Adam raised a Cain  
All of the old faces ask you why youre back  
They fit you with position and the keys to your daddys Cadillac  
In the darkness of your room your mother calls you by your true name  
You remember the faces the places the names  
You know its never over its relentless as the rain  
Adam raised a Cain  
  
In the Bible Cain slew Abel and East of Eden he was cast  
Youre born into this life paying for the sins of somebody elses past  
  
Daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain  
Now he walks these empty rooms looking for something to blame  
You inherit the sins you inherit the flames  
Adam raised a Cain  
Lost but not forgotten from the dark heart of a dream  
Adam raised a Cain
