I sit in my living room thinking of you  
And the feelings I fear are coming true  
And everything about you is wrong I know it  
But I still taste you on my tongue  
And I still breath you in my lungs  
And I wish I could stop breaking down  
  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could love you out loud  
But Ill just keep it to myself  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
To be with you and no one else  
  
Dont make a sound  
Dont tell a soul  
  
Its 700am and I just want to call you  
And tell you Im falling in love  
But theres somebody else inside these four walls  
If she smells you on my skin  
I cant let her know where Ive been  
I wish I could be with you now  
  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could love you out loud  
But Ill just keep it to myself  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
To be with you and no one else  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Because Im under your spell  
Wish I could tell the whole world  
But Ill just keep it to myself  
  
Dont make a sound  
Dont tell a soul  
Dont tell them anything  
And I wont let you go  
  
Dont say a word  
Dont tell a soul  
And I shiver at the thought of you  
I cant believe that you love me too  
And we quiver when we touch  
I cant believe I love you so much  
And I hate it when you walk away  
I know we cant go on this way  
But theres magic when we touch  
I cant believe I love you so much  
  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
Wish I could love you out loud  
But Ill just keep it to myself  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
To be with you and no one else  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Because Im under your spell  
Wish I could tell the whole world  
But Ill just keep it to myself  
  
Dont make a sound  
Dont tell a soul  
Dont tell them anything  
And I wont let you go  
  
Wish I could love you out loud  
But Ill just keep it to myself  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
To be with you and no one else  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Because Im under your spell  
Wish I could tell the whole world  
But Ill just keep it to myself  
  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
Wish I could love you out loud
