You ask me where to begin  
Am I so lost in my sin  
You ask me where did I fall  
Ill say I cant tell you when  
But if my spirit is lost  
How will I find what is near  
Dont question Im not alone  
Somehow Ill find my way home  
  
My sun shall rise in the east  
So shall my heart be at peace  
And if youre asking me when  
Ill say it starts at the end  
You know your will to be free  
Is matched with love secretly  
And talk will alter your prayer  
Somehow youll find you are there  
  
Your friend is close by your side  
And speaks in far ancient tongue  
A seasons wish will come true  
All seasons begin with you  
One world we all come from  
One world we melt into one  
  
Just hold my hand and were there  
Somehow were going somewhere  
Somehow were going somewhere  
  
You ask me where to begin  
Am I so lost in my sin  
You ask me where did I fall  
Ill say I cant tell you when  
But if my spirit is strong  
I know it cant be long  
No questions Im not alone  
Somehow Ill find my way home  
Somehow Ill find my way home  
Somehow Ill find my way home  
Somehow Ill find my way home
