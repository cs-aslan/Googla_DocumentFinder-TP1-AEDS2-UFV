Verse 1 Jade  
We keep behind closed doors  
Every time I see you I die a little more  
Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls  
Itll never be enough  
  
Jesy As you drive me to my house  
I cant stop these silent tears from rolling down  
You and I both have to hide on the outside  
Where I cant be yours and you cant be mine  
  
PreChorus Jade  
But I know this we got a love that is homeless  
  
Chorus Perrie  
Why cant I hold you in the street  
Why cant I kiss you on the dance floor  
I wish that it could be like that  
Why cant it be like that Cause Im yours  
Why cant I say that Im in love  
I wanna shout it from the rooftops  
I wish that it could be like that  
Why cant it be like that Cause Im yours  
  
Verse 2 Jesy  
Its obvious youre meant for me  
Every piece of you it just fits perfectly  
Every second every thought Im in so deep  
But Ill never show it on my face  
  
PreChorus Jesy  
But we know this we got a love that is homeless

I dont wanna hide us away  
I wonder if it ever will change
