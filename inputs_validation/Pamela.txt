Side by side Ill be yours forever  
Rain or shine any kind of weather  
There isnt anything I wouldnt do for you  
Lets take whats getting old and make it new  
  
Oh eye to eye its a blinding confrontation  
You and I were a deadly combination  
So dont start mixing truth with jealousy  
The road were on is clear as far as I can see  
  
Pamela dont break this heart of mine  
Just remember it may not heal this time  
Pamela there is no second chance for the one who leaves it all behind  
  
Black and white always go together  
Day and night youre the precious jewel I treasure  
Wanting every part of you is not a crime  
Or could it be that youre the one whos wrong this time  
  
Pamela dont break this heart of mine  
Just remember it may not heal this time  
Pamela there is no second chance for the one who leaves it all behind  
  
All that I love all that I love  
Thousands of miles away but always in my heart  
  
Pamela dont break this heart of mine  
Just remember it may not heal this time  
Pamela there is no second chance for the one who leaves it all behind
