Somewhere down the road youre gonna find a place  
It seems so far but it never is  
You wont need to stay but you might lose your strength  
On the way  
  
Sometimes you may feel youre the only one  
Cause all the things you thought were safe now theyre gone  
But you wont be alone Ill be here to carry you along  
Watching you til all your work is done  
  
When you find your heart youd better run with it  
Cause when she comes along she could be breaking it  
No theres nothing wrong youre learning to be strong  
Dont look back  
She may soon be gone no dont look back  
Shes not the only one remember that  
  
If your heart is beating fast then you know shes right  
If you dont know what to say well thats all right  
You dont know what to do  
Remember she is just as scared as you  
  
Dont be shy even when it hurts to say  
Remember youre gonna get hurt someday anyway  
Then you must lift your head keep it there  
Remember what I said  
Ill always be with you dont forget  
Just look over your shoulder Ill be there  
  
If you look behind you I will be there
