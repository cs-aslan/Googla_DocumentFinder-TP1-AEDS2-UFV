I know youre out there having a good time  
Spaced out chicks love potions and good wine  
Dont make me laugh youre not in there alone  
Theres other peoples voices in the room  
  
Dont hang up I didnt mean it that way  
No eye communication always happens this way  
How can I say what I mean mean what I say  
No eye communication always happens that way  
  
I know I shouldnt let it happen  
Theres no excuse I felt so alone  
You know how it is our lure was meant to trap them  
And then they find some poison of their own  
  
Dont hang up I didnt mean it that way  
No eye communication always happens this way  
How can I say what I mean mean what I say  
No eye communication always happens
