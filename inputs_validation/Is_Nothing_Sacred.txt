If a love as strong as ours couldnt make it all the way  
Can anything make sense at all  
If a love so deep and true couldnt stand the test of  
time  
Then Mount Everest could slide and Jerusalem could fall  
Is nothing sacred anymore Is forever just another word  
Is a promise something people use to keep when love was  
worth fighting for  
If we can say goodbye if we can say goodbye  
Is nothing sacred anymore  
If we can say goodbye  
Is nothing sacred anymore  
  
I can hear the final words every sentence that was said  
Dont know what turned our lives around  
It doesnt matter who was right  
Theres no justice in a dream  
Never thought a heart could break without making any sound  
Is nothing sacred anymore Is forever just another word  
Is a promise something people use to keep when love was  
worth fighting for  
If we can say goodbye if we can say goodbye  
Is nothing sacred anymore  
If we can say goodbye  
Is nothing sacred anymore  
  
Our love was as certain as the dawn  
As solid and safe as any love could be  
Our love was a star to wish upon  
And you thought that Id saved you  
Couldve sworn that you saved me  
Is nothing sacred anymore Is forever just another word  
Is a promise something people use to keep when love was  
worth fighting for  
If we can say goodbye if we can say goodbye  
Is nothing sacred anymore  
If we can say goodbye  
Is nothing sacred anymore  
  
Is nothing sacred anymore Is forever just another word  
Is a promise something people use to keep when love was  
worth fighting for  
If we can say goodbye if we can say goodbye  
Is nothing sacred anymore  
If we can say goodbye  
Is nothing sacred anymore
