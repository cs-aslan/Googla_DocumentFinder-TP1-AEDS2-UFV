Verse 1  
I sleep with the door open if you want to come in while Im sleeping  
Im always sleeping naked in case you wake up and youre creeping  
Want to lick it so much that its almost like I taste it on the tip of my
tongue  
I want to touch it so bad that its almost like I can feel it on my fingertips  
I want yours inside of me but dont forget where I like licking baby  
I want to make your fantasies reality I want to be yours baby  
  
Hook  
I want you to bang my box  
I want you to bang my box  
  
Verse 2  
There aint nothing that Im scared to try  
I can be on top or if you like it Ill just lie here  
Take my picture position my body  
Wherever you like just know that I like it naughty  
Teach me a lesson pretend we never met  
But we cant keep just kissing cause youre getting me so wet  
The only downside to this morning is you getting up and you leaving  
When Im dreaming and youre in em I wake myself up cause Im screaming  
What are you doing to me  
Its like youre a zookeeper setting animals free  
You release me like a tiger thats been locked in a cage  
Here I am here you are  
I want it so hard  
You finger my heart  
And I know just what I need what I came here to do  
Ive been thinking baby been mostly about you  
  
Hook  
I want you to bang my box  
I want you to bang my box  
  
Outro  
You say it tastes like cake with my lips against your face I want you to eat
it baby
