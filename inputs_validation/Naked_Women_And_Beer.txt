Well you head on out in the jungle  
Lookin for the girls to tumble  
Up and down and all around the stage  
But when the women start takin their clothes off  
  
Now we have got some strange laws  
The most hypocritical thing around these days  
Cause where I live in Tennessee  
Why an auto parts calender hey thats pornography  
But go right down the road read what the sign says  
  
Naked women and beer we got it all in here  
For your eyes and your ears  
They show it all in the clear  
Way up north and down south  
Whoo somebody shut my mouth  
  
Now I aint sayin its right  
But I aint sayin its wrong  
But myself I enjoy the site  
Of pretty girls dancin to their songs  
  
And its been like that since way back when  
From little Egypt to the Vegas strip  
And when the music starts groovin  
And the girls start movin  
Aint nothing gonna make em quit  
  
Naked women and beer we got it all in here  
For your eyes and your ears  
They show it all in the clear  
Way up north and down south  
Whoo somebody shut my mouth  
  
Naknaknaknaknaknaked women  
Naknaknaknaked women  
Ice cold beer its all together in here  
Naked women and beer  
  
Cmon in out of the rain  
We got the girls that will make you  
Spend all your change  
Naked women and beer
