Finders keepers losers weepers  
Ring around the rosy  
And Ill catch you if I can  
And if you dont say may I  
Then youll have to start again  
But first you must indulge me  
And count from one to ten  
Let the game begin  
  
I adore you when you touch me  
Pin the tail upon the donkey  
You will surely win  
And if you dont say may I  
Then Ill pass the cake around  
And I wont give you any  
But you wont make a sound  
You dont eat soap anyhow  
  
Red light green light  
Blue light yellow light  
You can take three giant steps  
Or a baby step will do  
But if you dont say may I  
Then Ill march you out the door  
Where youll be contemplating  
The numbers one to four  
I hope youre keeping score  
  
Cause if you dont say may I  
Then Ill get you with the hose  
And spoil your Sunday clothes  
Will it please you if I tease you  
While youre at the spindry  
Ill pass the pie around  
But you wont make a sound  
You dont eat blackbird anyhow  
  
Theres four and twenty reasons  
Why it cant be wrong  
How long have you been gone  
Finders keepers losers weepers  
Peter Peter pumpkin eater  
Wear your sneakers around sound sleepers
