Another day and another full seizure  
Another pill you spiral down deeper  
Another cut by a surgical butcher  
Its just a way of prolonging the torture  
  
I wont say I dont know what Im doing  
I wont say that Im sorry  
  
I cant bring you back but I cant leave you helpless  
Ill make the pain rest in peace  
  
Ill turn off the light and  
Swallow your last breath  
So close your eyes fall asleep  
Ill never hurt you  
Ill never hurt you  
  
The sun shines on this deadly new morning  
The church bells ring an early warning  
Your eyes shine as I turn on the motor  
The tears fall as the mercy gets closer  
  
I wont say I dont know what Im doing  
I wont say that Im sorry  
  
I cant bring you back but I cant leave you helpless  
Ill make the pain rest in peace  
Ill turn off the light and  
Swallow your last breath  
So close your eyes fall asleep  
Ill never hurt you  
  
I cant bring you back but I cant leave you helpless  
Ill make the pain rest in peace  
Ill turn off the light and  
Swallow your last breath  
So close your eyes fall asleep  
Ill never hurt you
