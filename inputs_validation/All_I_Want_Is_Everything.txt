Before my eyes the world is falling  
But through all lies  
I feel my calling  
They always said that I cant do it  
But even so I walked right through it  
Why cant you see  
The way that it must be  
You think youre so strong  
You know that you are wrong  
Come on woman  
Just gimme a touch  
You gotta know Im not asking too much  
Once a king always a king  
All I want is everything  
You always thought that you were so cool  
You used to say that I was a fool  
And all this time you were just a tool  
You couldnt see that I made the rules  
I have to feel  
I know this is for real  
I gotta live  
I want all you can give  
Come on woman  
Just gimme a touch  
You gotta know Im not asking too much  
Once a king always a king  
All I want is everything
