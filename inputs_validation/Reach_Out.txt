Its over your head  
And you dont seem to understand  
One word I say  
And you cant live your life  
Trying to run away  
  
Youre fighting your friends  
Youre wearing everybody out  
But it never ends  
Youre wearing me out  
  
Chorus  
Come on  
Reach out  
And let somebody in your life  
  
Dont get me wrong  
You always apologize  
Its just your way  
Of making a scene  
You need to be loved  
Its not such a crime  
  
Chorus  
  
Over your head  
You just dont seem to understand  
One word I say  
And you cant live your life  
You got so much love  
Its burning inside  
  
Chorus
