I need someone to say I do  
No one to cry to now no one to say goodnight  
No one to tell my troubles to  
  
Ive got no one to sigh to no one to hold me  
Tight  
No one to cheer me when Im blue  
  
When I go home to my lonely room  
And find theres no one there  
And each night I think of you so please answer this  
One prayer  
  
And youll need someone I said to cry to  
Someone to say I do  
Someone to whisper I love you  
  
When I go home to my lonely room  
And find theres no one there  
And each night I think of you so please answer this  
One prayer  
  
And youll need someone I said to cry to  
Someone to say I do  
Someone to whisper I love you
