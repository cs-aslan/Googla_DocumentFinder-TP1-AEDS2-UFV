Any day youll be gone oh yeah  
Any day youll be gone  
  
Any day now  
I will hear you say goodbye my love  
Then youll be on your way  
Then my wild beautiful bird you will have flown  
Any day now Ill be all alone  
I know that hey I know that  
  
Any day now  
When the clock strikes go youll call it off  
And then my tears will flow  
Then the blue shadows will fall all over town  
Any day now love will let me down  
Cause you wont be around  
No baby now yeah  
  
I know I shouldnt want to keep you  
If you dont want to stay  
Until youre gone forever  
Ill be holding on for dear life  
Holding you this way  
And Im begging you to stay  
  
Any day now  
When your restless eyes meet someone new  
And to my sad surprise  
Then the blue shadows will fall all over town  
Any day now I wont last for long  
Cause any day youll be gone  
Then any day youll be gone  
I know I know that  
  
Youll be gone youll be gone youll be gone  
Yeah mercy any day now  
Any day youll be gone  
Mercy yeah  
Any day youll be gone
