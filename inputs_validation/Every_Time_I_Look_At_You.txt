Tryin to say Im sorry didnt mean to break your heart  
And find you waitin up by the light of day  
Theres a lot I want to tell you but I dont know where to start  
And I dont know what Id do if you walked away  
Ooh baby I tried to make it I just got lost along the way  
But every time I look at you  
No matter what Im goin through its easy to see  
And every time I hold you the things I never told you  
Seem to come easily  
Cause youre everything to me  
I never really wanted to let you get inside my heart  
I wanted to believe this would soon be ending  
I thought it wouldnt matter if it all just came apart  
But now I realize I was just pretending  
Ooh baby I know I hurt you but you can still believe in me  
But every time I look at you no matter what Im goin through  
Its easy to see  
And every time I hold you the things I never told you  
Seem to come easily  
Cause youre everything to me  
Its gonna take a little time to show you  
Just what you mean to me oh yeah  
It seems the more I get to know you the more I need to make you see  
Youre everything I need yeah  
Oho I need ya I need ya I need ya  
Ooh baby baby baby I know I hurt you  
But you can still believe in me  
But every time I look at you no matter what Im goin through  
Its easy to see  
And every time I hold you the things I never told you  
Seem to come easily  
Cause youre everything to me  
Youre everything to me youre everything to me
