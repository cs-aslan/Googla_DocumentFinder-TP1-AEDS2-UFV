Hey baby  
This is not a challenge just means that I love you as much as I always said I
did  
I was wrong  
I have been laughable wrong  
Sandpaper papermache chalk hung out wet  
  
Oh the city We all scan now na na na na na na  
Well I didnt have to be afraid I didnt have to be so stupid  
I can see myself  
I can feel  
  
With just the slightest bit of finesse  
I might have made a little less mess  
But it was what it was  
Lets all get on with it  
Now

Laughing  
Discoverer  
  
From the cross Houston where I am  
I see the city rise up tall  
The opportunities  
The possibilities  
I have never felt so called  
  
Remember the vodkaespresso night of discovery  
Remember that  
Laughing  
Discovery  
Oh how I look back and reflect  
How I felt it  
I was sick  
I dont have to feel so wrong  
Now I wake up dreaming saffron turmeric and brass  
  
With just the slightest bit of finesse  
I might have made a little less mess  
But it was what it was  
Lets all get on with it  
Now  
  
With just the slightest bit of finesse  
I might have made a little less mess  
But it was what it was  
Lets all get on with it  
Now
