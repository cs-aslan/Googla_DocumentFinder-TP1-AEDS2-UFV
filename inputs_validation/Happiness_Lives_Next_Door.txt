Im sorry but you come to the wrong house  
But I know who those flowers are for  
The flowers that you have are for  
Someone whos happy  
And happiness lives next door  
Someone sends her flowers each evening  
And her young heart is flooded with joy  
So dont keep her waiting  
Deliver her flowers to happiness  
Who lives next door  
The only one who would send flowers to you  
Is gone to return no more  
But theres some consolation to know  
Someone is happy  
And happiness lives next door  
The only one who would send flowers to you  
Is gone to return no more
