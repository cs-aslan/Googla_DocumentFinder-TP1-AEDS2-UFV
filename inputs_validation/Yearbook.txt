Dear Amy see you in September  
Hope that you remember me next year  
Hey Jamie youve been a great friend to me  
I hope that Ill still see you around here  
  
Cause Im looking through the yearbook  
Then I find that empty space  
Theres a name without a picture  
But I cant forget his face  
  
Chorus  
Tell me where did he go  
I want to know  
Where did Johnny go  
It says picture unavailable right here  
More than sad  
It makes me mad to know somebody knows  
Theres a lying in your silence  
Tell me where did Johnny go  
  
Poor Katie she wont even speak his name  
None of us will ever be the same  
Its quiet in the halls  
But I hear echoing off the walls  
The rumors of Johnnys mystery  
Cause Im looking through the yearbook  
Then I find that empty space  
No he never wrote me nothing  
But I cant forget his face  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh theres a lying in your silence  
Tell me where did Johnny go  
Oh theres a lying in your silence  
Tell me where did Johnny go  
  
Sometimes I think I hear him calling out my name  
Sometimes I wonder if maybe were to blame  
Its been a year now and a lot of things have changed  
But I keep thinking about Johnny  
I keep turning to that page  
  
Where did he go  
I want to know  
Where did he go  
I want to know  
  
Oh theres a lying in your silence  
Tell me where did Johnny go  
Oh theres a lying in your silence  
Tell me where did Johnny go
