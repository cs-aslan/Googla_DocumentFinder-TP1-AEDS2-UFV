If this life is driving you to drink  
Sitting round whats the use what to think  
Well Ive got some consolation  
Give it to you if I might  
You know I dont worry about a thing because  
Nothings gonna turn out right  
  
Well this worlds just one big troubled spot  
Some have plenty some have not  
Ive used to be troubled but  
I finally saw the light  
Now I dont worry about a thing because I know  
Nothings gonna be alright  
  
You spend your time trying to be the big winner  
The minute youll get fat somebody else will get thinner  
Theres always somebody messing with dynamite  
You know I dont worry about a thing because I know  
Nothings gonna turn out right
