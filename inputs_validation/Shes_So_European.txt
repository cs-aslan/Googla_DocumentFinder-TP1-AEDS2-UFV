She walked in like a lady with a glass of pink champagne  
I wouldnt look if you paid me cause to me shes still the same  
Well you oughtta see her wearin her heart on her sleeves  
Youd never believe her shes got a wellplanned look in her eyes  
  
Shes so European shes one of a kind one of a kind  
Shes so European shes one of a kind all in her mind  
And shes so European I found out today  
  
She still speaks with an accent from a week in San Tropez  
She makes love on her brass bed cause her parents are still away  
Well you oughta see her countin the stars in her eyes  
Youd never believe her shes got a wellplanned coverless smile  
  
Shes so European shes one of a kind all in her mind  
Shes so European shes one of a kind all in her mind  
And shes so European she told me today  
  
I wanna hold her tight all through the night I must be dreamin  
I wanna take my time shes so refined is that her screamin  
  
Ive seen the looks in your eyes youve seen through her disguise yeah  
  
Shes so European shes so European one of a kind all in her mind
