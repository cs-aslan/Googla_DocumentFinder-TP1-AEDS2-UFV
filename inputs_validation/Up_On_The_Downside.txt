This England made me  
Between the war and a rockets flying  
You found the crib that saves me  
And teach me wrong and right  
  
Then the world was talking  
It never got its chance to say  
When theres too much talking  
Nobody hears the words you say  
  
Chorus  
You wont see  
Baby now I want you  
These blind communications  
Only last throughout the year  
And half of what were saying  
Is halfway in a truth  
And blind communications  
For a million hearts and fools  
  
I am a witness  
To a land of a million fools  
All placing bets on life  
Then hate the ones you lose  
And all the lonely  
Never get the chance to say  
That their one and only  
Would be the chance to even play  
  
Chorus  
  
Hello Monday  
The week is just a blur  
Ive been burning bridges  
And now Im begging at your door  
So I keep on working  
cause its a chance for me to pay  
But too much talking  
When you believe the words I say  
  
Chorus
