Me Ive just died  
But some machine keeps on humming  
Im just an extra piece of dead meat to keep running  
Why wont you let me die in peace  
Why wont you let me die with some kind of honor  
Why wont you let me die at all  
I know  
Youve got your principles  
  
My body lies immobile  
I left it days ago  
And me I watch from somewhere as the loved ones come and go  
I see them glancing at the switch  
I hear them whispering maybe its better that way  
I see the love turn into feelings  
I know  
Arent quite the same  
  
I see the men of learning  
Pacing to and fro  
But how can I expect the sane to ever know  
Id rather die than have no mind  
I know my brain is gone damaged beyond repair  
I see an empty shell below me  
I know  
Ive had my time
