Well hes truckin on down from Memphis  
Cruisin down to New Orleans  
Tonight he sleeps alone with a cajun queen  
Well theres smoke from the stacks ablowin  
And he dont care where hes goin  
The only time he feels right is when hes rollin  
Hes got road maps in his hand  
Lord drivin just as hard as he can  
Trying to dodge them scales and the man  
Well Im talkin about  
Truck drivin man  
Yea hell always give ya the best that he can  
  
White cups and coffee lord yea  
Its all that he needs  
And hes all right by me  
Truck drivin man  
Truck on  
Truck driver  
Shift your gears  
  
Hes got ladies up in North Dakota  
From the keys man to Minnesota  
And he loves each and every one least thats what hes told em  
Lord flannel shirts and blue jeans  
Truck stops are routine  
Tonight he sleeps alone with a cajun queen  
Well Im talkin about  
Truck drivin man  
Yea hell always give ya the best that he can  
  
White cups and coffee lord yea  
Its all that he needs  
And hes all right by me  
Truck drivin man
