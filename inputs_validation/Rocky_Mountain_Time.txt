Station was empty  
Trains were all gone  
I reached in my pocket  
Waited for dawn  
The clock played drums  
And I hummed the sax  
And the wind whistled down  
The railroad tracks  
Hey three for a quarter  
One for a dime  
Ill bet its tomorrow  
By Rocky Mountain Time  
I walked in the restaurant  
For something to do  
The waitress yelled at me  
So did the food  
And the water taste funny  
When youre far from your home  
But its only the thirsty  
That hunger to roam  
And the clock played drums  
And I hummed the sax  
And the wind whistled down  
The railroad tracks  
Hey three for a quarter  
One for a dime  
Ill bet its tomorrow  
By Rocky Mountain Time  
Well build us a castle on Main Street  
And pretend that were down on the farm  
Hell well hold out as long as we have to  
Then well twist off each others arm  
Christ Im so mixed up and lonely  
I cant even make friends with my brain  
Yeah Im too young to be where Im goin  
But Im too old to go back again  
Station was empty  
Trains were all gone  
I reached in my pocket  
Waited for dawn  
The clock played drums  
And I hummed the sax  
And the wind whistled down  
The railroad tracks  
Hey three for a quarter  
One for a dime  
Ill bet its tomorrow  
By Rocky Mountain Time  
By Rocky Mountain Time  
By Rocky Mountain Time  
By Rocky Mountain Time
