Yeah I want to travel south this year  
Aaah Woah Woah  
Wont prevent safe passage here  
  
Why you act crazy  
Not an act maybe  
So close a lady  
Shifty eyes shady  
  
Yeah hey yeah tears that soak  
A callous heart  
  
Why you act frightened  
I am enlightened  
Your weakness builds me  
So someday youll see  
  
I stay away  
  
Why you act crazy  
Not an act maybe  
So close a lady  
Shifty eyes shady  
  
I stay away 4x
