Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river  
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea  
You lay your bets and then you pay the price  
The things we do for love the things we do for love  
  
Communication is the problem to the answer  
Youve got her number and your hand is on the phone  
The weathers turned and all the lines are down  
The things we do for love the things we do for love  
  
Like walking in the rain and the snow  
When theres nowhere to go  
And youre feelin like a part of you is dying  
And youre looking for the answer in his eyes  
You think youre gonna break up  
Then he says he wants to make up  
  
Ooh you made me love you  
Ooh youve got a way  
Ooh you had me crawling on the floor  
  
Like walking in the rain and the snow  
When theres nowhere to go  
And youre feelin like a part of you is dying  
And youre looking for the answer in his eyes  
You think youre gonna break up  
Then he says he wants to make up  
  
Ooh you made me love you  
Ooh youve got a way  
Ooh you had me crawling on the floor  
  
A compromise would surely help the situation  
Agree to disagree but disagree the part  
When after all its just a compromise of  
The things we do for love the things we do for love
