I am the voice  
I am the radio  
You hear me loud and clear  
Across the open sky  
  
Into the night  
You hear me loud and clear  
I was thinking youre a part of my mind  
Breathing sleeping talking two of a kind  
  
Im the voice in your head  
do you read me  
The word you just said  
do you hear me  
  
Aah  the world goes spinning around  
Aah  and you all join in with the sound  
Aah  we sing with one voice  
Like a world radio  
Aah  we sing with one voice  
Like a world radio  
  
I feel the pain  
I feel the joy and love  
You hear it loud and clear  
But should the music stop  
  
Ill feel so low  
Ill fade and disappear  
Im just thinking that were two of a kind  
Think I know whats going on in your mind  
  
When the red light goes on  
can you tell me  
Is your green light still on  
do your hear me  
  
Aah  the world goes spinning around  
Aah  and you all join in with the sound  
Aah  we sing with one voice  
Were a world radio  
Aah  we sing with one voice  
Were a world radio  
The world goes spinning around  
Aah  we all join in with the sound  
Aah  we sing with one voice  
Like a world radio  
  
We join in with the sound  
The world goes spinning spinning around  
Aah  we sing with one voice  
Were a world radio  
  
Aah  we sing with one voice  
Were a world radio  
Radio  
Is the green light on  
can you tell me  
Dont put your red light on  
do you read me  
I know the green lights on  
Dont put dont put your red light on  
Is the green light on
