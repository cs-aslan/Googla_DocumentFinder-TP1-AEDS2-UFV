Ive been set free and Ive been bound  
To the memories of yesterdays clouds  
Ive been set free and Ive been bound  
  
And now Im set free  
Im set free  
Im set free to find a new illusion  
  
Ive been blinded but  
You I can see  
What in the world has happened to me  
The prince of stories who walk right by me  
  
And now Im set free  
Im set free  
Im set free to find a new illusion  
  
Ive been set free and Ive been bound  
Let me tell you people  
What I found  
I saw my head laughing  
Rolling on the ground  
  
And now Im set free  
Im set free  
Im set free to find a new illusion
