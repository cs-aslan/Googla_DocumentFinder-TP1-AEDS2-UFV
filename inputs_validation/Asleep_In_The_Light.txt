Do you see  
Do you see  
All the people sinking down  
Dont you care  
Dont you care  
Are you gonna let them drown  
  
How can you be so numb  
Not to care if they come  
You close your eyes  
And pretend the job is done  
  
oh bless me lord  
Bless me lord  
You know its all I ever hear  
No one aches  
No one hurts  
No one even sheds one tear  
But he cries  
He weeps  
He bleeds  
And he cares for your needs  
And you just lay back  
And keep soaking it in  
  
Oh cant you see such sin  
cause he brings people to your door  
And you turn them away  
As you smile and say  
god bless you  
Be at peace  
And all heaven just weep  
cause Jesus came to your door  
You left him out on the streets  
  
Open up open up  
And give yourself away  
You see the need  
You hear the cries  
So how can you delay  
God is calling  
And you are the one  
But like Jonah you run  
He told you to speak  
But you keep holding it in  
  
Oh cant you see such sin  
The world is sleeping in the dark  
That the church just cant fight  
cause its asleep in the light  
How can you be so dead  
When youve been so well fed  
Jesus rose from the grave  
And you  
You cant even get out of bed  
Oh Jesus rose from the dead  
Come on get out of your bed  
  
How can you be so numb  
Not to care if they come  
You close your eyes  
And pretend the job is done  
You close your eyes  
And pretend the job is done  
Dont close your eyes  
Dont pretend the job is done  
  
Come away come away  
Come away with me my love  
Come away from this mess  
Come away with me my love  
Come away from this mess  
Come away with me my love  
Come away  
Come away with me my love
