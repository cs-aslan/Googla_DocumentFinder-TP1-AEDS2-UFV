You know  
That I love you  
In every way  
You bring  
So many magical wonders  
To my day  
  
How could I ever leave  
One reason why  
Cause darlin without you  
I cannot breathe  
Youre the best thing  
In all my life  
The only one  
Who helps me through  
So much pain and strife  
  
Baby you know  
Chorus  
Youll always be in my heart  
Well never have reaons  
To ever part  
When I look into yor eyes  
All I see is you and I  
Together forever in your heart  
  
Darlin yes  
I love you more than words can say  
  
Youll always be mine  
No matter where you are  
Youre always at the front  
Of my mind  
Only for eternity  
Youve touched my heart  
With undying hope  
With your love  
My problems can cope  
No one will ever take your place  
When I close my eyes  
I see me  
Kissing your sweet face  
  
Youre much more beautiful  
Than Heavens glowing embrace  
Chorus  
  
Youll alwyas be  
Forever with me  
Baby just wait and see  
Youre my dream come true  
And all I can say  
Is that I love you  
  
All I can say  
Is I love you  
Every night and day  
My dreams come true  
Only when Im with you  
Holding you near  
  
Ill always be  
With you youll see  
Forever Forever in your heart  
Only always  
Forever in your heart
