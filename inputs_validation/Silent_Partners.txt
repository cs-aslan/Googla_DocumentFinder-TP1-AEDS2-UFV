We have to take our chances we have to keep it down  
We have to steal our kisses when nobodys around  
We have to hide the tenderness inside  
To make love on the sly you say its for the better  
  
We have to speak in riddles to cloak the things we say  
We have to watch our whispers not to give ourselves away  
We have to run in shadows in the dark  
We have to stand apart when they see us together  
  
So were livin like silent partners sneakin like thieves in the night  
Cant let it show gotta keep it low so no one knows  
Were silent partners never come to the light  
Itll never be right whatever we do  
You need me too much and Im just not givin up on you  
  
We have to keep the secret burnin on our lips  
Wed both be hurting someone if they caught us here like this  
We have to bear this burden that we share  
Knowin our affair just cant go on forever  
  
And were livin like silent partners sneakin like thieves in the night  
Cant let it show gotta keep it low so no one knows  
Were silent partners never come to the light  
Itll never be right whatever we do  
You need me too much and Im just not givin up on you  
  
Silent partners  
I cant let it show we gotta keep it low so no one knows  
Were silent partners are we ever gonna come to the light  
Itll never be right whatever we do  
You need me too much and Im just not givin up  
  
Silent partners sneakin like thieves in the night  
Cant let it show gotta keep it low so no one knows  
Were silent partners are we ever gonna come to the light  
Cant let it show gotta keep it low so no one knows  
Were silent partners sneakin like thieves in the night  
Cant let  fade out
