There are phantoms here on earth who take away our lives  
They kill your kids and they rape your wives  
They rip your flesh tear your heart take you down to hell  
They dont give a damn on any kind of life  
  
Phantoms bring evil destruction and death  
Night after night the same old game  
They all look so harmless but deep in their hearts  
Satan is lurking and he will break out  
  
Always someone at your back only waiting to attack  
  
Chorus  
Phantoms of death phantoms of death  
  
The empire of deceivers is built upon your fear  
Youll have to lose it cause the end is near  
Warheads armies stand to strike I know it isnt right  
I want to get out of here I dont want to die  
  
Infernal destruction of fire youll burn  
Then youll be helpless but its not too late  
Stand up right now and youll be the winner  
Or Satan will get you take you forever  
  
Genocide everywhere wheres the Savior of this world  
  
Chorus  
Phantoms of death phantoms of death  
  
Where is he the promised savior the one wholl save the earth  
Perhaps hell come to bury us but then itll be too late  
Who are they who are the phantoms who will end our lives  
Its you and me you and me open up your eyes  
  
Phantoms bring evil destruction and death  
Night after night the same old game  
They all look so harmless but deep in their hearts  
Satan is lurking and he will break out  
  
We are all parasites of this world we shall die  
  
Chorus  
Phantoms of death phantoms of death
