New York to that tall skyline I come flyin in from London to your door  
New York lookin down on Central Park  
Where they say you should not wander after dark  
  
New York like a scene from all those movies  
But youre real enough to me but theres a heart  
A heart that lives in New York  
  
A heart in New York a rose on the street  
I write my song to that city heartbeat  
A heart in New York love in her eye an open door and a friend for the night  
  
New York you got money on your mind  
And my words wont make a dimes worth a difference so heres to you New York
