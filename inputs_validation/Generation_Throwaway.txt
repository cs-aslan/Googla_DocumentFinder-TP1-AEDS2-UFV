Whoa  
Generation throwaway  
Whoa  
Generation throwaway  
  
Get caught as we dig in the dirt  
While the pretty ones climb the trees with the keys to the gate  
Get caught as were making it worse  
As we break our backs we barely notice the pain  
  
Yeah were taking it back  
  
Were only moments away  
Brave enough to break these barricades  
It starts today  
Were not generation throwaway  
Everything is fine  
Were not not afraid of glory  
Moments away  
Were not generation throwaway  
  
Throw back what were trying to change  
While the pretty ones climb the trees were not willing to beg  
Play dead as were digging a hole  
Then theyre never gonna realize until the day weve escaped  
  
Yeah were taking it back  
  
Were only moments away  
Brave enough to break these barricades  
It starts today  
Were not generation throwaway  
Everything is fine  
Were not not afraid of glory  
Moments away  
Were not generation throwaway  
  
Whoa  
Whoa  
  
You can tell that were taking it back  
You can tell that were taking it back  
You can tell that were taking it back  
That were taking it back taking it back  
  
You can tell that were taking it back  
You can tell that were taking it back  
You can tell that were taking it back  
That were taking it back taking it back  
  
Were only moments away  
Brave enough to break these barricades  
It starts today  
Were not generation throwaway  
Everything is fine  
Were not not afraid of glory  
Moments away  
Were not generation throwaway  
  
Whoa  
Generation throwaway  
Whoa  
Generation throwaway
