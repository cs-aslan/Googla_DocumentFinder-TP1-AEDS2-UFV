If its gonna rain I hope it pours  
Thunder and lightning  
Like never before  
Cause thats how I feel  
Here in my heart  
If its gonna rain  
Let the storm start  
  
If youre gonna leave go on and go  
Dont even look back  
When you hit the road  
If thats how you feel  
About you and me  
Nows a good time  
So go on and leave  
  
Ive never been one for doing  
Something half the way  
Ive loved you with all my heart  
But its all been in vain  
  
Its gonna hurt  
Cut to the bone  
Break my heart in two  
When you move on  
Im gonna cry a river of tears  
Its gonna rain and rain and rain  
Round here for years  
  
Im gonna cry a river of tears  
Its gonna rain  
Let the storm start  
If its gonna rain I hope it pours
