Well I thought you knew thinkin that you were true  
Guess I I couldnt trust called your bluff time is up  
Cause Ive had enough  
You were there by my side always down for the ride  
But your joy ride just came down in flames cause your creed sold me out in
shame  
  
After all of the stealing and the cheating youd probably think that  
I hold resentment for you  
But uh uh youre wrong  
Cause if it wasnt for all that you tried to do I woulnt know  
Just how capable I am yo pull through  
So I wanna say thank you  
Cause it  
  
Chorus  
Makes me that much stronger  
Makes me work a little bit harder  
It makes me that much wiser  
So thanks for makin me a fighter  
Made me learn a little bit faster  
Made my skin a little bit thicker  
Makes me that much smarter  
So thanks for makin me a fighter  
  
Never saw it coming all of your backstabbing  
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before Id realize your game  
I heard youre goin round playin the victim now  
But dont even begin feelin Im the one to blame  
Cause you dug your own grave  
After all of the fights and the lies cause youre wanting to haunt me  
But that wont work anymore no more  
Its over  
Cause if it wasnt for all of your torture  
I wouldnt know how to be this way now and never back down  
Cause it  
  
Chorus  
  
How could this man I thought I knew  
Turn out to be unjust so cruel  
Could only see the good in you  
Pretended not to know the truth  
You tried to hide your lies disguise yourself  
Through libing in denial  
But in the end youll see  
YouWontStopMe  
  
I am a fighter and I  
I aint goin stop  
There is no turning back  
Ive had enough  
  
Chorus x2
