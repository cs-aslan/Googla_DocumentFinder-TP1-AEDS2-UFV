If I had been You I would have left  
Said theres nothing else that I can do  
But You saw somethig deep inside of me  
I had no idea but I was crying for you  
Didnt have to make the sacrifice  
Didnt have to come and save my life  
Didnt have to pay the price for me  
Sincerely Im not worthy  
Didnt have to give all that You gave  
No way I could ever walk away  
Heres the only thing that I can say  
Yours truly thou art worthy  
I cant believe Youve chosen to reveal  
Never ending mercy towards a heart thats been so faithless  
The fact that You want to show Yourself to me  
My knees grow weak can hardly speak  
For your love has been relentless  
Didnt have to make the sacrifice  
Didnt have to come and save my life  
Didnt have to pay the price for me  
Sincerely Im not worthy  
Didnt have to give all that You gave  
No way I could ever walk away  
Heres the only thing that I can say  
Yours truly thou art worthy  
How can I repay You for the things that Youve done for me  
Dear God  
I call to You  
Make me more like You  
My way to say thank You  
Is do all that you say  
Didnt have to make the sacrifice  
Didnt have to come and save my life  
Didnt have to pay the price for me  
Sincerely Im not worthy  
Didnt have to give all that You gave  
No wayi could everwalk away  
Heres the only thing that I can say  
Yours truly thou art worthy
