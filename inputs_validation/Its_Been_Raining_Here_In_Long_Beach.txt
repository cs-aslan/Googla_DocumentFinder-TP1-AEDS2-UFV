Its been raining here in long beach  
The dampness in the air  
Tends to straighten out my hair  
Against my wishes  
But the traces of a song reach  
My tattered ear once more  
Lend me courage to ignore  
The smell of fishes  
  
I was a drunken lout I ran about  
With ladies that I knew  
I did em wrong all night long  
Singing 23 skidoo  
  
Huzahhhuzahh  
Once upon a time I was a kid  
Well I dont know what happened then  
But Im warning all you younger men  
On your way to long beach think again  
You cant afford to settle down in long beach  
  
I had a rack and coat a paddle boat  
I played the ukelele  
Beneath the moon in june Id croon  
Wont you come on home little baby  
  
Huzahhhuzahh  
Once upon a time I was a kid  
But now my hair is turning gray  
Im getting fatter every day  
If you got any sense youll stay away  
And never give another thought to long beach  
And never give a moments thought to long beach
