Well its a fragile tension  
Thats keeping us going  
It may not last forever  
But oh when its flowing  
  
Theres something magical in the air  
Some things so tragic we have to care  
  
Its a strange obsession  
Thatss drawing us nearer  
We dont understand it  
It never gets clearer  
  
Theres something mystical in our genes  
So simplistic it kicks and screams  
  
Oh when were teetering  
On the edge of the collapse  
Nothing can keep us down  
  
Its a dizzying feeling  
Thats keeping us flying  
Some glittering galas  
Without even trying  
  
Theres something radical in our hands  
Nothing logical to our plans
