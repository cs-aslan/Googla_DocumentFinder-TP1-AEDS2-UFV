Aint no sunshine when shes gone  
Only darkness every day  
Aint no sunshine when shes gone  
And this house just aint no home  
Any time she goes away  
  
I wonder this time where shes gone Ooh ooh  
Is she really goin to stay Oh yeh yeh yeh yeh  
Aint no sunshine when shes gone  
Shes always gone too long  
Any time she goes away Oh yeh yeh  
  
I know I know I know I know I know I know  
I know I know I know I know I know I know  
I know I know I know I know I know I know  
That I cant leave no thing alone  
Aint no sunshine when shes gone wooooh  
  
Aint no sunshine when shes gone  
Is she really goin to stay  
Aint no sunshine when shes gone  
And shes always gone too long  
Anytime she goes away anytime she goes away  
Anytime she goes away anytime she goes away  
Aint no sunshine when shes gone
