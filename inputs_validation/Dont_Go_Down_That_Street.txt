Dont go down that street  
In those shoes that squeak  
cause I get afraid that you might not come home  
Careful how you speak  
When youre on the street  
cause theyve broken down all the telephones  
  
Dont go down that street no no no  
Dont go down that street no no no  
Dont go down that street  
  
Dont go down that street  
Where the brave boys meet  
cause Im chicken feed when theyre on their own  
Dont get in that car  
Things might go too far  
line in japanese  
  
Dont go down that street no no no  
Dont go down that street no no no  
Dont go down that street  
  
japanese talkover by miko  
  
ooh ooh aaah aah
