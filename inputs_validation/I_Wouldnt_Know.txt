Everyone I see these days still asks me about you  
I guess they got so used to us together they assume  
That everythings ok and then I have to say  
  
I wouldnt know I havent seen him  
I couldnt say its been awhile  
I havent thought about him lately  
So I wouldnt know  
Im getting tired of people askin  
Why cant they just leave me alone  
Cause I couldnt care I couldnt say I wouldnt know  
  
I dont get out anymore to our old stompin grounds  
Cause some old friend is bound to ask me why youre not around  
Well I just stay away so I dont have to say  
  
I wouldnt know I havent seen him  
I couldnt say its been awhile  
I havent thought about him lately  
So I wouldnt know  
Im getting tired of people askin  
Why cant they just leave me alone  
Cause I couldnt care I couldnt say I wouldnt know
