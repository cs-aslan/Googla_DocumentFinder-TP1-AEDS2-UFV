If I had my way  
Fly into the air  
You know I would  
And if I had my way  
Fly without a care  
You know I would  
And if I had your love  
If I only had your love  
Thered be no if I hads at all  
  
If there was a road  
Travel down that road  
To get to you  
If there was a mountain  
You know Id climb that mountain too  
Cause if I had your love  
If I only had your love  
Theres be no if I hads at all  
  
If I had your love  
If I only had your love  
Thered be no if I hads at all  
Thered be no if I hads at all  
If I had your love  
If I only had your love  
If I had your love  
If I only had your love
