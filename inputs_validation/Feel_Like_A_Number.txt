I take my card and I stand in line  
To make a buck I work overtime  
Dear Sir letters keep coming in the mail  
I work my back till its racked with pain  
The boss cant even recall my name  
I show up late and Im docked  
It never fails  
I feel like just another  
Spoke in a great big wheel  
Like a tiny blade of grass  
In a great big field  
To workers Im just another drone  
To Ma Bell Im just another phone  
Im just another statistic on a sheet  
To teachers Im just another child  
To irs Im just another file  
Im just another consensus on the street  
Gonna cruise out of this city  
Head down to the sea  
Gonna shout out at the ocean  
Hey its me  
And I feel like a number  
Feel like a number  
Feel like a stranger  
A stranger in this land  
I feel like a number  
Im not a number  
Im not a number  
Dammit Im a man  
I said Im a man
