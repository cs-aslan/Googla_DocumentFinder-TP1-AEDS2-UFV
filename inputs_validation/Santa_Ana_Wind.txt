I feel safe inside the violence  
Like I feel safe inside a roller coaster car  
I feel safe in the hills  
Up above it all sometimes  
In the middle of the night I can almost see the stars  
  
Living in LA makes me think of you  
I think about the good times doing all the bad things we used to do  
Walked the streets and I could remember why I feel so bad  
Walked the streets at night it helps sometimes to remember why  
  
Living in LA feels like home in a brand new way  
I am like everyone I meet  
I have ghosts in my mind they will never go away  
I walked the streets at night to understand why I feel so bad  
I walked the streets at night questioning why I am the way I am  
  
We come from the somewhere lost time out in the cold  
We run for the light its the only way we know  
Wanna find a better sun I wanna find a better world  
Wanna find a better heart so I can find me a better girl  
Wanna find a place living inside of the violence and the rage  
Of the Santa Ana wind on sunny day  
  
Living in LA its the west coast where I have my head in the sand  
Cant explain this place if youre not from here you will never understand  
I walk the streets at night  
I think about all the lies that Ive had  
I walk the streets at night  
I think about why I want the love that I cant have  
  
We come from the somewhere lost out in the cold  
We fight for the light its the only way we know  
Wanna find a better sun I wanna find a better life  
I wanna find a better world I wanna find a better life  
Wanna find a place living inside of the violence and the rage  
Of the Santa Ana wind on a beautiful day  
  
Yeah it is the simple things that I love about this place  
Sunshine and Mexican booze on Christmas day  
Oh the noise from the city is the only way I can fall asleep  
I think I needed leave to realize that this is all  
This is where Im supposed to be  
Oh oh ooh  
  
We come from the south were lost out in the cold  
We fight for the light its the only way we know  
Wanna find a better sun I wanna find a better shine  
Wanna find a better world wanna find me a better life  
I wanna find a place to hide inside the violence and the rage  
Of the Santa Ana wind on a winters day  
  
I can almost see the future  
I can almost see the blue sky in the middle of the day  
Even though our hell is coming down around me now  
My Santa Ana wind made the clouds all blow away
