Life can take your dreams and turn them upside down  
Friends will talk about you when youre not around  
Reality can really cut you down to size  
But dont ever lose that light in your eyes  
Dont ever lose that light in your eyes  
  
People make you promises theyll never keep  
Soon youll know why people say talk is cheap  
And life resembles one big compromise  
But dont ever lose that light in your eyes  
  
Keep on shining  
Keep on smiling  
Dont lose faith and dont lose heart  
When youre crying  
Just keep trying to remind yourself  
youre a shining star  
Yes you are  
  
Somewhere down the line youll face the judgment day  
When the angels look at you what will they say  
Theyve got a way of knowing who qualifies  
Just let em see that light in your eyes  
  
Dont ever lose that light in your eyes  
Keep on shining  
Keep on smiling  
Dont lose faith and dont lose heart  
When youre crying  
Just keep trying to remind yourself youre a shining star  
Yes you are  
  
Dont ever lose that light in your eyes  
Dont ever lose that light in your eyes  
Dont ever lose  
Dont ever lose
