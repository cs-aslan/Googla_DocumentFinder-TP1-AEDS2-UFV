They wouldnt let him play the Opry  
With whiskey on his breath  
And it didnt take em long  
To figure out what they missed  
He went down that lost highway  
Underneath the purple sky  
A legend disappeared before his time  
Things change  
  
They said he was the devil  
Dressed in gold lame  
The way he shook his hips  
Out there on that stage  
But before that faithful day  
He left Tennessee  
All of them were calling him the king  
Things change  
  
Well they like to call them hippies  
Outlaws with guitars  
But they brought a little poetry  
To the honky tonks and bars  
They mightve got a little crazy  
They might have flew a little too high  
Somewhere somebodys playing their song tonight  
Things change  
Dont you know things change  
  
Now some say its too country  
Some say its a little rock n roll  
But its just good music  
If you can feel it in your soul  
It doesnt really matter  
Its always been the same  
Life goes on  
Things change  
  
Dont you know they change  
Oh things change  
As long as this world is turning  
Things are gonna change  
Gonna keep on changing  
Gonna change
