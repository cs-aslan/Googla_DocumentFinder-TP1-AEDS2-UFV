Paperclips melody  
Hold together all these memories  
Memories  
Memories  
I dont want to think at all  
  
I dont want to be like you anymore  
I dont want to see your face at my door  
And Ill never leave like you thats for sure  
I dont want to be like you anymore anymore anymore  
  
Take a trip down memory lane  
You will never want to go again  
Take your leave  
Take your leave  
I dont want to sing at all  
  
I dont want to be like you anymore  
I dont want to see your face at my door  
And Ill never leave like you thats for sure  
I dont want to live like you anymore anymore anymore  
  
Ever talk decide out  
We get by well get by  
And I wont take this  
No more sadness no no  
  
Paperclips memories  
Hold together all these melodies  
Melodies  
Melodies  
I dont want to sing at all  
  
I dont want to be like you anymore  
I dont want to see your face at my door  
And Ill never leave like you thats for sure  
I dont want to live like you anymore anymore anymore
