Oh the periphery  
They throw good parties there  
Those peripheral idiots  
Always have a bite to bear  
Bear it if you can  
If you really want to  
  
Go to the periphery  
Have them celebrate your name  
Have them forge you a pedigree and then youll be  
Left to run the races lame  
Run if you want  
If you think its worth it  
But not with me  
  
Cause I dont appreciate  
People who  
Dont appreciate  
All that loving mustve been lacking something  
If I got bored trying to figure you out  
You let me down  
I dont even like you anymore at all  
  
Oh the periphery  
I lost another one there  
He found a prettier girl than me  
With a more eventempered air  
And if he wants her he should get her  
Cause I think he thinks shes worth it  
And maybe theyll move from the periphery  
By themselves or on a plot of land  
And Ill care in a different capacity Ill just be  
Hoping he makes a good family man  
And if he finds himself yearning  
For his throne on the silly side  
Nothing wrong as long as hes learning  
Besides you can take it up with his brethren  
Or with his bride just not with me  
  
Cause I dont appreciate  
People who  
Dont appreciate  
All that loving mustve been lacking something  
If I got bored trying to figure you out  
You let me down  
I dont even like you anymore at all  
  
All that loving mustve been lacking something  
If I got bored trying to figure you out  
You let me down  
I dont even like you anymore at all  
  
Oh the periphery  
Oh the periphery  
Oh the periphery  
Oh the periphery  
Stay away  
Stay away  
Away away  
Stay away away
