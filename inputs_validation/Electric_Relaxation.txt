Consequence  
Homie check it out I got her mesmerized  
So wont you hook a chew scorns she tellin you buy  
Street poetry is how ya boy get paid  
And I wear no Escalade metallic black or beige  
Yo when I walk up in the club you know I do not pay  
Aiiyo my man Kanyeezy he got something to say  
  
Kanye West  
Aiiyo my name is Kanyeezy from the RocA fam  
And where the glocks dont jam so where we pop them scrams  
See I showed you on the champions how we get down  
So dont twist ya lips Im like Bobby Brown  
You got B2k on all your bedroom wall  
But if you be with Kan gonna work ya walls  
Straight from the South side of dem Chitown streets  
The top three in the game with these here beats  
  
Consequence  
And if you talk about him aiiyo I take you out  
Either with the nine or the techs in his mouth  
And let that dime gettin friendly than the orgies at eight  
But yall niggaz dont shine so you couldnt relate  
  
Chorus  
Relax yourself or well whack ya down You couldnt relate  
Relax yourself or well whack ya down Yo Quence you couldnt relate  
Relax yourself or well whack ya down  
Relax yourself or well whack ya down  
Relax yourself or well whack ya down  
Relax yourself or well whack ya down  
  
Consequence  
Quence without the game now hes back to ball  
Drive you insane drop a tat at the mall  
You starin at my Rolls cold way to long  
But I aint scared of robbers why I wear tephlon  
I took her on the ave and she expect me to trip  
But I made up with no style while I bought me some kicks  
So if you want the drama holler at ya boy  
  
Kanye West  
Original rude boy like Pastor Troy  
The G500 is my favorite toy  
Cause it dont look like a thug or a hood  
But he keep dem gorillas so we still be good  
By the way my name is K dont forget the A  
And the NYE out N Y C  
Ima still rep the gold no matter where I go  
Everybody say Im hot Im sayin Im cold  
Hate when niggaz leave the city and switch up they reps  
On the real homie I dont get down like that  
Ima milk the game til we all can eat  
  
Consequence  
Now the Chocolate Factory is what I bump in my jeep  
So roll me up a L but dont lace it with leak  
Cause that shitll have me zonin for a couple of weeks  
  
Kanye West  
Now your momma told you let the cleavage show  
Cause thats the best way to get a nigga with dough  
Then fake a pregnancy then call the attorneya  
But she aint know Im cheaper than ikea furniture  
  
Consequence  
Kanye White Malik Little and D  
Menace Skates to Lou and em Puffs from L B  
They know the Consequence be wearin gold and ice  
Cause I got out the projects where its flooded with mice  
Ey shorty let me tell you bout the rules of my Nikes  
It seems they always keep on movin I dont hear nuthin twice
