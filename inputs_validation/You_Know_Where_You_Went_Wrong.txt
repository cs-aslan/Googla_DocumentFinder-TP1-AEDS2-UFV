Two men on the street  
Drinking something cheap  
No home no family  
Its cold nowhere to sleep  
Passersby never catch their eye  
Anywhere one man drinks the other swears  
  
Chorus  
You know where you went wrong  
You know where you went wrong  
You know  
You know where you went wrong  
You know where you went wrong  
You know  
  
The old man cant understand  
No one will shake his hand  
I gave security bombs and colour TV  
It cost a few lives  
Someones son always dies  
No one shakes his hand  
He dont understand  
  
Chorus  
  
This is the history of the world  
Of every boy and every girl  
Who dont understand whats going on anymore  
The history of the world  
Of every boy and every girl  
Who dont understand whats going on anymore  
  
Two girls have a photograph  
One looks the other laughs  
He could have been mine  
Why did I change my mind  
Then hands on hips  
The other girl says Admit Admit  
  
Chorus  
  
This is the history of the world of the world  
Of every boy and every girl  
Who dont who dont understand understand  
Whats going on anymore whats going on  
The history of the world oh  
Of every boy and every girl Every boy and girl  
Who dont who dont understand understand  
Whats going on anymore whats going on  
  
Chorus x5
