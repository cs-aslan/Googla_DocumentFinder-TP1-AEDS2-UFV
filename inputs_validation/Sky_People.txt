I stopped flying a long time ago  
Thinking thats just for the birds and bees  
But when I look up I look up  
And see the sky see the sky  
I like the blue and I know why  
  
You came from Zeus we come from Uranus  
Hoping to meet soul to soul  
We see you clearly clearly  
With our third eye with our third eye  
Theres no more fear and I know why  
  
Sky people thats what we are  
Sky people thats what we are  
One day well fly and leap through the sky  
To look for a good land hand in hand  
  
Sky people thats what we are  
Sky people thats what we are  
Sky people thats what we are  
Sky people thats what we are
