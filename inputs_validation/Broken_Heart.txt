I heard that shes back in town  
Heard shes been seen around  
I hear she gets  
What she wants everytime  
  
I know what she put you through  
I know what youd like to do  
Cause I lost my heart  
To her sometime ago  
  
So come on  
Wipe your tears away  
Its all that you can do  
A broken heart never mends  
  
Crying tears til the very end  
At home on the boulevard  
Cheap whiskey and tarot cards  
Man shes outrageous  
  
She wants the best in life  
Sugar daddies with agin wives  
Shes expensive everything she does  
So come on  
  
Wipe your tears away  
Its all that you can do  
A broken heart never mends  
Crying tears til the very end  
  
She knows what it must be like  
Living in paradise  
If you aint got money she dont want to know  
I know what she put you through  
  
I know what youd like to do  
I lost my heart to her sometime ago  
So come on  
Wipe your tears away  
  
Its all that you can do  
When youve got a broken heart  
Come on  
Wipe your tears away  
  
Its all that you can do  
Oh yeah
