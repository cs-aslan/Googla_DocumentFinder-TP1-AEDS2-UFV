City of love City of love City of love  
  
Once bitten twice shy  
No  
No regrets at all  
Justice  
Body smooth take over  
Good girls they work the city  
Good guys they spike you hard  
How they jive ad jingle  
When youre in their backyard  
  
Street corner wonder lust  
Beckoning the good guy  
Take this get that  
Have a good time  
  
He young and tactile  
He ready for anything that is  
How they jive and jingle  
Theyve read the book that gives  
  
Well be waiting for the night  
Well be waiting for the night to come  
  
Well be waiting for the night  
Well be waiting for the night to come  
  
Supervise this good treatment  
Alternative line by line  
So the street guys so observant  
Take him for a ride  
Have a good time  
Like a legend the man he sharp  
His woman gladly watching  
As he strides out of the dark  
Better be quick get away  
  
Well be waiting for the night  
Well be waiting for the night to come  
  
Well be waiting for the night  
Well be waiting for the night to come  
  
Solo  
  
Good timing has its good price  
One trick and youre stuck with the dice  
How they jive and jingle  
When youre their sacrifice  
  
Fast as lightning  
Go  
Go get high  
Hes looking good  
Once bitten twice shy  
No woman no cry  
No woman dont cry  
  
Well be waiting for the night  
Well be waiting for the night to come  
  
Well be waiting for the night  
Well be waiting for the night to come  
  
Well be waiting for the night  
Well be waiting for the night to come
