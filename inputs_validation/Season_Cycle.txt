Season cycle moving round and round  
Pushing life up from a cold dead ground  
Its growing green  
Its growing green well  
Darling dont you ever stop to wonder  
About the clouds about the hail and thunder  
Bout the baby and its umbilical  
Whos pushing the pedals on the season cycle  
  
Summer chased by Autumn  
Autumn chased by Winter  
Season cycle go from death to life  
Winter chased by Springtime  
Bring a harvest or a man his wife  
Springtimes turning  
Its growing green  
Its growing green well  
Darling dont you ever sit and ponder  
Darling did you ever think  
About the building of the hills a yonder  
All this life stuffs closely linked  
Where were going in this verdant spiral  
Whos pushing the pedals on the season cycle  
Round and round and round and round  
  
I really get confused on who would make all this  
Is there a God in Heaven  
Everybody says join our religion get to Heaven  
I say no thanks why bless my soul  
Im already there  
  
Autumn is royal  
As Spring is clown  
But to repaint Summer  
Theyre closing Winter down  
  
Darling dont you ever stop to wonder  
Darling did you ever think  
About the clouds about the hail and thunder  
All this life stuffs closely linked  
About the baby and its umbilical  
Whos pushing the pedals on the season cycle  
Season cycle  
Darling dont you ever sit and ponder  
Darling did you ever think  
About the building of the hills a yonder  
All this life stuffs closely linked  
Where were going in the verdant spiral  
Whos pushing the pedals on the season cycle
