I got a baby thats oh so pretty  
I found her out here in this knock dead city  
Somebody kissing my baby last night  
My baby said  Junior thats all right  
Diddley diddley diddley diddley daddy  
Diddley diddley diddley diddley daddy  
Diddley diddley diddley diddley daddy  
  
Baby now baby understand  
Jimmy looks good but hes a half a man  
Roy looks cool but hes oh so cold  
And then a big old junker gonna wreck your soul  
Diddley diddley diddley diddley daddy  
Diddley diddley diddley diddley daddy  
Diddley diddley diddley diddley daddy  
Two orphan babies were lying in the bed  
The bigger one talked to Jimmy and said  
Love you Jimmy with all of my heart  
Jimmy woke up and tore the place apart  
Diddley diddley diddley diddley daddy  
Diddley diddley diddley diddley daddy  
Diddley diddley diddley diddley daddy  
  
Baby now baby hear my scene  
I want to know if you do love me  
I love you baby with all my heart  
Oh please dont ever say we will part
