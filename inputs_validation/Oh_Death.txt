  
A long time ago Lazarus died  
All hope seemed gone as his sisters cried  
Jesus walked to where he laid  
He called his name and he came out of the grave  
  
Oh death where is thy sting Oh grave where is thy victory  
you thought you had a hold on me but you were wrong Ive been set free  
  
Oh jesus hung on a rugged cross he gave His life for a world once lost  
He lay three days in a borrowed grave but when He came out I could hear Him
say  
  
Oh death where thy sting Oh grave where is thy victory  
You thought you had a hold on me but you were wrong Ive been set free  
  
One day Ill lay this body down theyll dress me up and put me in the ground  
But when Jesus comes in the sky just listen close and youll hear me cry  
  
Oh death where is thy sting Oh grave where is thy victory  
You thought you had a hold on me but you were wrong Ive been set free  
  
Oh death where is thy sting Oh grave where is thy victory  
You thought you had a hold on me but you were wrong Ive been set free
