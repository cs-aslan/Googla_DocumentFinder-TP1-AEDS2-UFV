Start with the sun  
And move on out  
The futures in the skies above  
The heavens unfold  
And a new star is born  
Space and time makin love  
  
Chorus  
Oh what a time we had  
Living on the ground  
Ive moved to station No 5  
See you next time around  
Next time around  
  
As far you want as close as you need  
Its all in the mind you know  
This old world hasnt really seen its day  
Its here time to go  
  
Chorus  
  
Remember when it was so clear  
We were young but the memory still remains  
To pick fruit from a tree  
Fish from the seas  
Now nothings left here but the stains  
Well I cant cry no more  
Can only be glad  
Theres other places we can be  
If the time suits you right  
Im leaving tonight  
Come fly away with me  
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Start with the sun  
And move on out  
The futures in the skies above  
The heavens unfold  
A new star is born  
Space and time makin love  
  
Chorus
