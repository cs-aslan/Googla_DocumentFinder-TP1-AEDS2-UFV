Carry me up them stairs  
Put my white socks on  
And my pretty song you like  
My blue nail polish  
What is all this you said  
The mess upstairs  
Dont be scared  
  
Daddy dearest you know  
How I like to take trips  
Pops first stop at the KMart  
Buy me my peach lipgloss  
Cigarettes and lolipops  
Mad magazines and white socks  
All in your car for  
Our trip across the usa  
  
We gonna party  
Like its 1949  
We in the Pontiac  
From July to July  
  
Its a flower motel nation  
Day and night on our last vacation  
We gonna see it all  
Before we say goodbye  
  
Daddy likes Blackpool  
Pleasure beach and roadstops  
Baby likes some Swiss Apps  
Souvenir giftshops  
  
Late night midnight  
Radio show talks  
Daddy baby  
Big jail break  
  
Ponytail and lolipops  
Dinerettes and sodapops  
New blue bathing suite  
Ruched tops and cadillacs  
  
Blue lake car to dunks  
Hop skotch shit talk  
Alabama hard knocks  
Motel dresslocks  
  
We gonna party  
Like its 1949  
We in the Pontiac  
From July to July  
  
Its a motel flower nation  
Day and night on our last vacation  
We gonna see it all  
Before he says goodbye
