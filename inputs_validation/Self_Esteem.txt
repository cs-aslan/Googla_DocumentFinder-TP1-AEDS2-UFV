I wrote her off for the tenth time today  
And practiced all the things I would say  
But she came over  
I lost my nerve  
I took her back and made her dessert  
  
Now I know Im being used  
Thats okay because I like the abuse  
I know shes playing with me  
Thats okay cause Ive got no selfesteem  
  
We make plans to go out at night  
I wait till 2 then I turn out the light  
All this rejections got me so low  
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so  
  
When shes saying that she wants only me  
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends  
When shes saying that Im like a disease  
Then I wonder how much more I can spend  
Well I guess I should stick up for myself  
But I really think its better this way  
The more you suffer  
The more it shows you really care Right  
  
Now Ill relate this a little bit  
That happens more than Id like to admit  
Late at night she knocks on my door  
Drunk again and looking to score  
Now I know I should say no  
But thats kind of hard when shes ready to go  
I may be dumb  
But Im not a dweeb  
Im just a sucker with no selfesteem
