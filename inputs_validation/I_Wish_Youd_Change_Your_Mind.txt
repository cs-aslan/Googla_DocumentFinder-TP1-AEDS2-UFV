I wish youd change your mind and stay  
Its really much too late to play games  
All I want is just to talk with you  
Ill even sing it if you want me to  
  
You know my motives are sincere  
And the loves the reason that were here  
Seeing you just makes me want to say  
Wont you change your mind for me and stay  
  
I just want to feel your arms about me  
Is that too much to ask or do  
You think that Id be asking too much  
I wish youd change your mind and stay  
  
Its really much too late to play games  
All I want is just to talk with you  
Ill even sing it if you want me to
