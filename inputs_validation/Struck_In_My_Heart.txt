C21 lyrics  
  
Stuck In My Heart  
  
Cant you tell  
Youve been all over me like a spell  I know  
I never wanna let you go  
  
Cant you see  
Youve been changing the world around me  I know  
I never wanna let you go  
  
If you hold me close enough  
I can whisper you the words  
If the distance is to far  
I cant do nothing cuz  
  
You are stuck in my heart  
And we can go anywhere  
Whatever the reason you are  
So stuck in my heart  
Like counting a million stars  
For that many reasons you are  
  
Cant deny  
Since I met you that day Ive been blind  to see  
Now I wanna know for real  
  
Inside me  
Im afraid to wake up from a dream  and see  
It never really happent to me  
  
If you hold me close enough  
I can whisper you the words  
If the distance is to far  
I cant do nothing cuz  
  
You are stuck in my heart  
And we can go anywhere  
Whatever the reason you are  
So stuck in my heart  
Like counting a million stars  
For that many reasons you are  
  
You are Like a dream so deep inside of me  
  
You are The reason that I never sleep  
  
You are Stuck in my heart  
  
You are  
  
Cant you tell  
Youve been all over me like a spell  
I will never let you go I will never let you go no no  
  
Cant you see  
Youve been changing the world around me  
I dont wanna let you go no Ill never let you go no no  
  
You are stuck in my heart  
And we can go anywhere  
Whatever the reason you are  
So stuck in my heart  
Like counting a million stars  
For that many reasons you are
