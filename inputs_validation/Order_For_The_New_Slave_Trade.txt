After clearing his throat  
The speaker read from the manuscript  
Only fortypercent of all participants have remained alcoholic  
And we began to discuss amongst ourselves  
The possibility for a dreamfilled holiday  
Order for the new slave trade  
New flag blowing  
Weve used up our minds  
We had no way of knowing  
Old flag burning  
Weve lost our souls  
Therell be no returning  
Weve diverted back  
To the stretch rack  
Only this time  
We wont snap back  
While crossing the parking lot  
A stranger approached me  
Handed me a gun  
He said meet me in the ashes  
Of the old city  
And were bound  
To have  
Some fun
