Theres a black hill  
We had a climb  
Everything I need but nothings mine  
Satans world Ive had a kill  
Why didnt Rosemary ever take the pill  
Lying there waiting waiting for the kill  
Oh man wont do it but the devil will  
  
Im losing time and my mind  
Why cant I ever have whats naturally mine  
I got life and the things that go with it  
If theres something else where can i get it  
Lying there waiting waiting for the kill  
Oh man wont do it but the devil will  
  
Well heres my views I always lose  
Things I want to do are yesterdays news  
Say lifes a ball Ive had it all  
Out there in another dance hall  
Lying there waiting waiting for the kill  
Oh man wont do it but the devil will  
  
Take me as I am an excuse for a man  
Wherever I push someone stops my hand  
As a matter of interest tell me if you will  
Why didnt Rosemary ever take the pill  
Lying there waiting waiting for the kill  
Oh man wont do it but the devil will  
  
Oh why wont Rosemary ever take the pill
