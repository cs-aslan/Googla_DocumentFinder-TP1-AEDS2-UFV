Was a fast tough woman loved to play the clown  
You wont do nothin about it  
Break a good boys resistance down  
Know shes got a pistol  
Laid it down on me  
She said shoot shoot shoot it boy  
You gotta shoot it for me  
Convinced me that she was worth it  
Never knew I was her kill  
And two 45s would do the trick and pay the bills  
  
know shes got a pistol  
Laid it down on me  
And she said shoot shoot shoot it boy  
You gotta shoot it for me  
  
Ive really got to get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here now  
  
Holding out in my hotel room police they finally come  
Had her as the prosecution and my prints upon the gun  
  
know shes got a pistol  
Laid it down on me  
And she said shoot shoot shoot it boy  
You gotta shoot it for me  
  
Ive really got to get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here now
