Goin down to Georges where you just have been  
To see if youve been boogieing ah you know what I mean  
My left legs dragging my right legs limp  
My heads so wavy and I cant feel it  
I gotta see you baby youll be alright  
I want to boogie baby boogie tonight  
  
Well old George is boogieing hes been a boogieing with you  
Ah I want to boogie with you baby  
I want to boogie all night long  
I want to move with you I want to move  
I want to shake want to boogie too  
I want to boogieboogie
