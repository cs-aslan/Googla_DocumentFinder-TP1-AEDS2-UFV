Well you covered your tracks  
And now I cant see you  
You had your ashes scattered at sea  
Theres no grave to visit no tombstone to look at  
You were in the New York Times obituary  
Theres no record no tape no book no movie  
Some photographs and some memories  
Sometimes I dial your phone number by mistake  
And this is what I hear  
This is no longer a working number baby  
Please redial your call  
This is no longer a working number  
Your party doesnt live here anymore  
This is no longer a working number  
If you still require help  
Stay on the line and an operator  
Will try to bail you out  
I knew I should have seen you that Thursday  
I knew I shouldnt have left  
But you sounded so good your spirits so up  
I thought Id see you next week  
I say over and over if I had half a brain  
If I had half a brain in my head  
I wouldnt sit here dialing a wrong number  
And listening to what some recording said  
I knew I should have written written things down  
I always say Ill never forget  
Who can forget a oneeyed pilot  
Whos a concert pianist  
A painter a poet songwriter supreme  
My friends are blending in my head  
Theyre melting into one great spirit  
And that spirit isnt dead  
Now I may not remember everything that you said  
But I remember all the sings youve done  
And not a day goes by not an hour  
When I dont try to be like you  
You were gassed stoked and rarin to go  
And you were that way all the time  
So I guess you know why Im laughing at myselves  
Every time I dial the wrong line  
This is no longer a working number baby
