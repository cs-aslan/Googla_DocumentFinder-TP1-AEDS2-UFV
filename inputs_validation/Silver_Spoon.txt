I aint lookin like nobodys fool save it for somebody else  
And I aint makin any desperate move till Im satisfied myself  
I aint waitin for no invitation I just want to walk on through  
I never needed anybody and like my daddy said  
  
I wasnt born with a silver spoon nowhere to hide in a crowded room  
I see the attitude thats in your eyes I got no reason to apologize  
Cause whats so special bout a girl like you with a silver spoon  
  
In a city where the buildings rise I was just another face  
But mama told me when somebody dies no one else can take your place  
I never needed anybody and like my daddy said  
  
I wasnt born with a silver spoon nowhere to hide in a crowded room  
I see the attitude thats in your eyes I got no reason to apologize  
Cause Ive got something for a girl like you with a silver spoon  
  
I always knew Id be somebody I kept it in my head  
I never needed anybody and like my daddy said  
  
I wasnt born with a silver spoon nowhere to hide in a crowded room  
I see the attitude thats in your eyes I got no reason to apologize  
Cause whats so special bout a girl like you with a silver spoon
