Cant I  
Will I ever love you again  
Tell me why then cant I  
Maybe others  
Want you just like I do  
Tell me why then cant I  
You might have known others  
  
So have I  
Who would hurt you  
And dessert you  
Thats why I oonly want to  
  
Hold you always  
Never to let you go  
Tell me why then cant I  
You might have known others  
  
So have I  
Who would hurt you  
And dessert you  
Thats why I oonly want to  
  
Hold you always  
Never to let you go  
Tell me why then cant I  
Tell me why then cant I
