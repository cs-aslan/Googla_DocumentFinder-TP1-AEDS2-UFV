He was black and handsome  
And mighty mighty brave  
Comin from the backwoods  
The grandson of a slave  
He was caught for something  
They knew hed never done  
And he was diggin ditches  
Out in the burnin sun  
  
Chorus  
Working on the chain gangNo More  
Working on the chain gangNo More  
Working on the chain gangNo More  
Working on the chain gangNo More  
No more no more no more  
  
Man he was a giant  
And iron he could bend  
And he swore hed fight them  
Down to the bitter end  
Though he was no talker  
His burnin eyes would say  
You may keep on tryin  
Cant hold me no way  
  
Chorus  
  
And one night he lay in waiting  
Hit the guard and took the key  
And before the others caught him  
He jumped out and he was free  
He jumped out and he was free  
  
He made for the swamp lands  
It seemed a hopeless duel  
They had dogs and shotguns  
And they were mighty cruel  
But they couldnt find him  
He was too smart and strong  
Hiding in the daytime  
Wandering all night long
