Fallen brother hes a fallen husband  
Hes about to be woken in his hospital bed  
He doesnt want to rest  
He just wants to run  
And hes tired of being told that hes the lucky one  
  
Caped crusader shes a newborn leader  
But you should see her when her daughters on the phone  
And she wipes the tears away  
And she laces up because theres still hell to pay  
And it sure feels like hell today today  
  
And she says  
You see these hands theyre bruised and brown  
Theyre yours alone  
Hold on love were still going down  
Hold on love were still fighting at home  
The war at home  
  
Innocence behind his broken expression  
Hes a child of mercy hes our unlearned lesson  
And hes trying to wake up  
From this wilderness his world has now become  
Hes reaching out to those hes running from  
  
And he says  
You see these hands theyre bruised and brown  
Theyre yours alone  
Hold on now were still going down  
Hold on now were still fighting  
  
And its one step forward and two steps back  
This is all who are marching  
One step forward two steps back  
This is young and old  
One step forward two steps back  
Through the void of silence  
You are not alone  
  
You see these hands theyre a million strong  
They are yours now  
Hold on now were all going down  
Hold on now were all fighting at home  
The war at home
