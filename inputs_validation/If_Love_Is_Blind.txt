People say that youre no good for me  
People say it constantly  
I hear it said so much I repeat it in my sleep  
  
Maybe I am just a fool for you  
Maybe youre no angel too  
But all that talk is cheap  
When Im alone with you  
  
If love is blind  
Ill find my way with you  
Cause I cant see myself  
Not in love with you  
If love is blind  
Ill find my way with you  
  
All the world is crazy anyway  
Whats it matter what they say  
If Im the one thats wrong  
Then let in be my mistake  
  
If love is blind  
Ill find my way with you  
Cause I cant see myself  
Im not in love with you  
If love is blind  
Ill find my way with you  
  
You wouldnt be with me tonight if I didnt feel I was right  
What will it matter anyhow a hundred years from now  
  
If love is blind  
Ill find my way with you  
Cause I cant see myself  
Im not in love with you  
If love is blind  
Ill find my way with you
