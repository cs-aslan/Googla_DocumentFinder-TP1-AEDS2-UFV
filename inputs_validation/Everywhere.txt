Turn it inside out so I can see  
The part of you thats driftin over me  
Cause when I look youre never there  
But when I sleep youre everywhere  
Youre everywhere  
  
Tell me how I got this far  
Tell me why youre here and who you are  
Cause everytime I look  
Youre never there  
And everytime I sleep  
Youre always there  
  
Cause youre everywhere to me  
And when I close my eyes  
Its you I see  
Youre everything I know  
That makes me believe  
Im not alone  
  
I recognized the way you make me feel  
Its hard to think that you might not be real  
I sense it now the waters getting deep  
I try to wash the pain away from me  
Away from me  
  
Cause youre everywhere to me  
And when I close my eyes  
Its you I see  
Youre everything I know  
That makes me believe  
Im not alone  
Im not alone  
  
When I touch your hand  
Its then I understand  
The beauty lies within  
Its now that we begin  
You always light my way  
Whenever comes a day  
No matter where I go  
I always feel you so  
  
Cause youre everywhere to me  
And when I close my eyes  
Its you I see  
Youre everything I know  
That makes me believe  
Im not alone  
  
Youre everywhere to me  
And when I catch my breath  
Its you I breathe  
Youre everything I know  
That makes me believe  
Im not alone  
  
And youre everyone I see  
So tell me do you see me
