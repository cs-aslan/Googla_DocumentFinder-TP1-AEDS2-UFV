I had the craziest dream last night yes I did  
I never dreamed it could be  
Yet there you were in love with me  
  
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you  
And you didnt mind it at all  
When Im awake such a break never happens  
How long can a guy go on dreamin  
  
If theres a chance that you care then please  
Say you do Baby  
Say it and make my craziest dream come true
