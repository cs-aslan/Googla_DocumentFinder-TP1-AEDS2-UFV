Am I in or am I out  
Dont pretend that you dont know what Im talking about  
In your eyes I can see a reflection of someone its clearly not me and you  
Keep walking like youve got somewhere else to go  
Keep talking like you dont care for me no more  
Make a wish now baby and Ill try to make it come true  
But I feel this time Ill be losing you  
Butterfly Im gonna letcha go  
I know Ive done the same thing ten times before and you  
Keep walking like youve got somewhere else to go  
Keep talking like you dont care for me  
Keep walking like youve got somewhere else to go  
Keep talking like you dont care for me no more  
And you   
Keep walking like youve got somewhere else to go  
Keep talking like you dont care for me  
Keep walking like youve got somewhere else to go  
Keep talking like you dont care for me no more  
Butterfly Im gonna letcha go  
I know Ive done the same thing ten times before and you
