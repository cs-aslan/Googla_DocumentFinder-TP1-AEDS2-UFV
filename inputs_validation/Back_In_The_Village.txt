Turn the spotlights on the people  
Switch the dial and eat the worm  
Take your chances kill the engine  
Drop your bombs and let it burn  
  
White flags shot to ribbons  
The truce is black and burned  
Shellshock in the kitchen  
Tables overturned  
  
Chorus  
Back in the village again  
In the village  
Im back in the village again  
  
Throwing dice now rolling loaded  
I see sixes all the way  
In a black hole and Im spinning  
As my wings get shot away  
  
No breaks on the inside  
Paper cats and burning barns  
Theres a fox among the chickens  
And a killer in the hounds  
  
Questions are a burden  
And answers are a prison for oneself  
Shellshock in the kitchen  
Tables start to burn  
  
Chorus  
  
But still we walk into the valley  
And others try to kill the inner flame  
Were burning brighter than before  
I dont have a number IM A NAME  
  
Chorus
