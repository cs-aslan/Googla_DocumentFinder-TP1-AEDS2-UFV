The current is strong from what Ive heard  
Ill whisk you down the stream  
But I never seem to have the time  
So my toes just touch the water  
So my toes just touch the water  
  
Daydreamed on the bank again  
I was swimming with the fish  
And I thought this time that it may be true  
But my toes just touched the water Repeat x3  
  
Walked a mile just to find the edge  
Some place low enough  
to step right in  
Now Im here and I cant begin  
to move  
  
Walked a mile just to find the edge  
Some place low enough  
to step right in  
Now Im here and I cant begin  
to move  
  
That spoiled sun up over there  
Always has to have its way  
And I know that the rivers there to shelter me  
But my toes just touched the water Repeat x3
