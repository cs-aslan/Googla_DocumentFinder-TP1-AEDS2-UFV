Tell you a little story and it wont take long  
Bout a lazy farmer who wouldnt hoe his corn  
The reason why I never could tell  
For that young man was always well  
He planted his corn in the month of June  
And by July it was up to his eyes  
Come September came a big frost  
And all the young mans corn was lost  
His story kith had just begun  
Said Young man have you hoed some corn  
Well I tried and I tried and I tried in vain  
But I dont believe I raised no grain  
He went down town to his neighbors door  
Where he had often been before  
Sayin Pretty little miss will you marry me  
Little miss what do you say  
Why do you come for me to wed  
You cant even make your own corn grain  
Single I am and will remain  
A lazy man I wont maintain  
He turned his back and walked away  
Sayin Little miss youll rue the day  
Youll rue the day that you were born  
For givin me the devil cause I wouldnt hoe corn
