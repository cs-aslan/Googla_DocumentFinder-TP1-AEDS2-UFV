You better get ready for the war  
  
Its so frustratin so many hatin  
Somebody gon make me break the law  
But I aint waitin theres no escapin  
You better get ready for the war  
  
A shotgun fanatic who right back at it  
You get mopped and dropped like a filthy habit  
X snatch and grab it got you hopin I fail  
Cause if I fail youd be happy like a faggot in jail  
Im full retail guaranteed to sell  
In my jet black McClaren with my mademoiselle  
Im strongarm steady you fragile and frail  
You think you ready for them steady niggaz I cant tell  
Sex sells so fuck you all we came to bubble and ball  
You getting shutd own soon as I touch down  
Bust rounds enemies slayed and cut down  
Fully automatic spittin rounds with no sound  
Break down your whole regime like an M16  
Make sure the chamber in the barrel is clean  
And the spring thats connected to the firin pin  
Thats connected to the trigger when I squeeze it again begin  
  
Look ma top of the world the best of the best  
King California LAX  
Out the hood in the penthouse from the projects  
One man one gun how the West was won  sing  
  
Its so frustratin so many hatin  
Somebody gon make me break the law  
But I aint waitin theres no escapin  
You better get ready for the war  
  
Its so frustratin so many hatin  
Somebody gon make me break the law  
But I aint waitin theres no escapin  
You better get ready for the war  
  
Hit like a heavyweight breathe deep meditate  
Make the whole crowd get loud make em levitate  
I ride through my city like a presidential candidate  
LAX Phantom doubleare and accelerate  
Stack build elevate crash through the prison gate  
Generation hate appetite to eliminate  
XMan dont spit rhymes I ventilate  
Traffic contraband yeah banned through the interstate  
Got a sick flow  didnt know Let me demonstrate  
Renovate the game new nigga that you love to hate  
The left hand lands and the right hand devastates  
Half part of your face replaced with a metal plate  
Irate get snatched to a better place  
Let the detached decorate with the yellow tape  
Detonate drop bombs make the earth shake  
In Brazil with a half mill in the briefcase  
  
Look ma top of the world the best of the best  
King California LAX  
Out the hood in the penthouse from the projects  
One man one gun how the West was won  sing  
  
Its so frustratin so many hatin  
Somebody gon make me break the law  
But I aint waitin theres no escapin  
You better get ready for the war  
  
Its so frustratin so many hatin  
Somebody gon make me break the law  
But I aint waitin theres no escapin  
You better get ready for the war  
  
You better get ready for the war
