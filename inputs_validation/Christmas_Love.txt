Baby I will not pout  
Baby I will not cry  
Cause I got your love this Christmas time  
When the snows on the ground  
And its freezing outside  
I got your love this Christmas  
  
On every list Ive ever sent  
Youre the gift Id love the best  
So deck the halls and all the rest  
Warm me up  
With your Christmas love  
  
Hey angel in the snow  
Im under the mistletoe  
You are the one  
Youre my very own Christmas love  
Tell Santa Im cool this year  
My present is standing right here  
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love yeah  
  
Like a beautiful tree you can light up the room  
Your kinda star cant be removed  
Like a beautiful carol I get lost in your song  
And I will forever sing along  
  
On every list Ive ever sent  
Youre the gift Id love the best  
So deck the halls and all the rest  
You warm me up  
With your Christmas love  
  
Hey angel in the snow  
Im under the mistletoe  
You are the one  
Youre my very own Christmas love  
Tell Santa Im cool this year  
My present is standing right here  
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love  
  
All the lovers around the world all the lovers  
Let me sing you Merry Merry Christmas  
Merry Merry Christmas and happy holidays  
And every boy and every girl  
Stay close to the ones you love and thank God above  
That you got someone this year  
That can fill your heart with cheer  
  
Hey angel in the snow  
Im under the mistletoe  
You are the one  
Youre my very own Christmas love  
Tell Santa Im cool this year  
My present is standing right here  
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love
