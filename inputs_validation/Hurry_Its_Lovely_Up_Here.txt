Hey buds below Up is where to grow  
Up with which below cant compare with  
Hurry  its lovely up here  
Life down a hole takes an awful toll  
What with not a soul there to share with  
Hurry  its lovely up here  
Wake up bestir yourself its time that you disinter yourself  
Youve got a spot to fill  a pot to fill  
And what a gift package of showers sun and love  
Youll be met above everywhere with  
Fondled and sniffed by millions who drift by  
Life here is rosy  if youre a posy  
Hurry its lovely here  
Climb up geranium it cant be fun subterranium  
On the exterior its cheerier  
Rsvp peonies pollinate the breeze  
Make the queen of bees hot as brandy  
Come give at least a preview of Easter  
Come up and see the good were giving  
Come up and see the grounds for living  
Come poke your head out  
Open up and spread out  
Hurry its lovely here
