Born into a neighborhood that aint exactly rich  
Never knew his father and his mother was a bitch  
Oh no  
Didnt have a place to go  
  
Grown up in the streets  
He learned to take just what he needs  
Violence and crime the only answer he believes  
Oh no  
Your emotions you dont show  
  
How can you ever give up  
When you never were scared  
How can you ever forgive  
Without learning to blame  
  
See the night  
Thats where youre living  
Feel the dark  
That seems to follow you  
See the stars  
I see you crying  
See the stars  
You wished that one of them just shines for you  
After youre gone  
  
Unemployed and full of hate  
Youre dealing with cocaine  
One day you will end up with a needle in your brain  
Oh no  
As you slowly go insane  
  
How can you ever be good  
When you dont see a reason  
How can you trust an old friend  
When you dont even care for one  
  
See the night  
Thats where youre living  
Feel the dark  
That seems to follow you  
See the stars  
I see you crying  
See the stars  
You wished that one of them just shines for you  
After youre gone  
  
All you know is what you see  
You see society is treating you bad  
No more visions no more hope  
Your future is a cold cold cell  
I send you to hell  
  
Falling so deep into darkness  
Crawling so deep in the dark  
Give me a chance to regret what Ive done  
Only if I can explain  
  
See the night  
Thats where youre living  
Feel the dark  
That seems to follow you  
See the stars  
I see you crying  
See the stars  
You wished that one of them just shines for you  
After youre gone
