One two three four  
  
When I walk  
Down the street  
I been trippin on my feet  
  
And my clothes  
They dont match  
And my blue jeans need a patch  
  
Its cold outside  
Is there someone there tonight  
Its cold outside  
Wont you let me come inside and make it right  
  
Here its clear that Im not getting better  
When I fall down you put me back together  
  
What I do isnt cool  
And my lips are lined with drool  
Im a mess since you left  
You can use this fool Im gonna use this too  
  
Its cold outside  
Is there someone there tonight  
Its cold outside  
Would you let me come inside and make it right  
  
Here its clear that Im not getting better  
When I fall down you put me back together  
Im alone in my room I dont know what to do  
When I fall down you put me back together  
You put me back together  
  
And when I day dream  
When eating ice cream  
Its such a nice scene  
  
But then I wake up crying  
I know I just been lying  
  
Here its clear that Im not getting better that Im not getting better  
When I fall down you put me back together put me back together  
Right its clear that Im not getting better that Im not getting better  
When I fall down you put me back together  
  
Im alone in my room I dont know what to do  
When I fall down you put me back together
