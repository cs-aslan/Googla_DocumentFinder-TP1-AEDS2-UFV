Well its been a long day but i dont like to moan  
Its the middle of summer and im chilled to the bone  
Theres holes in my shoes where the rain comes in  
Im sitting on top of the world  
  
Walking in the shadows of empty office blocks  
I was talking to a stranger and hes on the rocks  
Down on the pavement living in a box  
Im sitting on top of the world  
  
Oh no cant anybody see  
Its been a bad day and i want a little peace  
  
Oh no wont you please help me  
I want to lie down but theres no beds free  
  
Down on the corner theres starry eyed preachers  
Rattling cans and pimping jesus  
Theres madmen on boxes makig speeches  
Im sitting on top of the world  
  
You cant sit in the sunshine or go out after dark  
Theres dogs on the loose acting like sharks  
Theres psychos on the streets burning winos in the park  
Im sitting on top of the world  
  
Oh no i wish i was gone  
I want to get going before too long  
  
Oh no i want to leave town  
But i cant drive my car cause they put it in the pound  
  
The masters of industry are killing for oil  
Theres poison in the air the water and the soil  
Were all turning mutant theyre counting up their spoils  
Im sitting on top of the world  
  
I turn on the tv and it makes me want to cry  
Theres killing and theres torture theres destruction and theres lies  
And our leaders talk rubbish and more people die  
Im sitting on top of the world  
  
Oh no i cant take anymore  
Im shaking all over and my nerves are all raw  
  
Oh no my heads a little sore  
I want to get out but i cant find the door
