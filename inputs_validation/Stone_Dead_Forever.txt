And didnt you see me in the glass  
And didnt you hear me you never listen past  
And didnt I see you gone to seed  
And the only reason is that youre too young greed  
  
Youre out there on your own  
Your face turned to stone  
Whatever happened to your life  
Stone dead forever  
  
Youre in perhaps youll listen a judge like you  
In your sweet life innocence thats nobodys fault  
Youve never had it quite so good  
Because you didnt know that you even could  
  
At times its been too old  
Your judge turned to gold  
Whatever happened to your life  
Stone dead forever  
  
And its been a long long time been a long long wait  
And then you thought youd beat us at the pearly gates  
You better leave your number oh and well call you  
You must admit your problem and its heckling you  
  
The time has come to pay  
Turns out youve been the prey  
Whatever happened to your life  
Stone dead forever
