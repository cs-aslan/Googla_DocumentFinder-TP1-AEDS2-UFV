Tried to make it little by little  
Tried to make it bit by bit on my own  
Quit the job the grey believers  
Another town where I get close to the bone  
  
Whatcha gonna tell your brother  
Oh oh oh  
Whatcha gonna tell your father  
I dont know  
Whatcha gonna tell your mother  
Let me go  
  
Im gonna get dressed for success  
Shaping me up for the big time baby  
Get dressed for success  
Shaping it up for your love yea yea yea  
  
Im not afraid  
A trembling flower  
Ill feed your heart  
And blow the dust from your eyes and  
In the dark things happen faster  
I love the way you sway your hips next to mine  
  
Im gonna get dressed for success  
Hitting a spot for the big time baby  
Get dressed for success  
Shaping it up for your love Look sharp
