Everybody says youre no good for me  
Nothin but trouble is what you bring  
Everybody thinks youre out to get me  
Helpless little fool they must think I am  
  
Everybody thinks that were both crazy  
Well its just my luck  
  
Chorus  
Is anybody out there  
Im standing here all alone  
And I I just dont know  
Is anybody this weird  
Will someone ever get my twisted thoughts  
My ways  
I guess not today  
  
Everybody says Im no good for you  
Nothin but trouble is what I bring  
Everybody thinks Im out to get you  
Well its just my luck  
  
Chorus  
Is anybody out there  
Im standing here all alone  
And I I just dont know  
Is anybody this weird  
Will someone ever get my twisted heart  
My ways  
I guess not today  
  
You look like a mess  
Id like to know  
How bout movin just a little closer  
I think maybe one day I  
I could love you  
  
Chorus  
Is anybody out there  
Im standing here all alone  
And I I just dont know  
Is anybody this weird  
Will someone ever get my twisted thoughts  
My ways  
I guess not today  
  
Not today  
I guess not Today  
Not today  
Not today
