Feeling myself all of the time  
All of the time feeling alright  
Taking a while raising a smile makes it all worth while  
  
But if you wanted to find peace of mind  
Then you could find it any time you liked  
You are the afterglow  
  
Feeling my way all of the time  
All of the time doing just fine  
Taking a page out of my life  
Out of my life wouldnt it be nice  
  
But if you wanted to find peace of mind  
Then you couldnt find it any time you liked  
You are the afterglow  
  
You are the midnight show  
The only one I know  
You come and then you go  
And when you finally leave  
You leave nothing for me
