Someone tell me why  
I do the things that I dont want to do  
When youre around me Im somebody else  
Someone tell me why I act like a fool  
When things dont go my way  
When youre around me Im somebody else  
  
There is good reason I guess  
Having once gone too far  
When you clean out the hive  
Does it make you want to cry  
Are you still being followed by the teenage FBI  
  
Someone tell me why x2
