You always were a dreamer with your eyes on the horizon  
Wondering what laid beyond as far as you could see  
You left to find a castle a knight in shining armor  
Or maybe just to spread your wings and feel that you are free  
  
Runaway girl theres someone here who loves you  
And understands you youre not alone  
Runaway girl I wont stop until I found you  
And put my arms around you and take you home  
  
You longed to fame and fortune you were looking for a rainbow  
Knowing someone down the line has found your heart of gold  
Castles sometimes crumble and too often dreams were shattered  
Then youll be left with nothing but a tortured mind and soul  
  
Runaway girl
