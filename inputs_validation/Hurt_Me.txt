Just when I thought Id found someone to trust  
You took away your love and  
Hurt me  
I still cant believe you hurt me  
Just when I thought it was safe to come in  
You let me want you and need you an then  
You left me like a child in the rain  
Now Im mending myself of the pain  
Oh you hurt me  
  
Yes you left me  
Like a child in the rain  
Now Im lost in an ocean of pain  
Oh you hurt me  
Cant you imagine how Im feeling now  
Oh will you ever know how  
You hurt me
