Oh yeah  
They say in this world  
Love cant last forever  
But I dont believe thats true  
Cos the way that I feel when were together  
I know thats the way  
Ill always feel for you

And promise you now until forever  
Ill never stop loving you  
  
Therell come a day when the world stops turning  
And stars will fall from the sky  
But this feeling will last when the sun stops burning  
All I wanna do is love you until the end of time  
  
From now until forever  
Thats how long Ill be true  
Ill make you this vow  
And promise you now until forever  
Ill never stop never stop  
Ill never stop loving you  
  
Its gonna take more than a lifetime  
To give you all the love I feel for you tonight  
  
From now until forever  
Thats how long Ill be true

And promise you now until forever
