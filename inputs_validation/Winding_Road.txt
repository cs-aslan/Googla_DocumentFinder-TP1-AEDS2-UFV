Written by tiffany and nancy bryan  
Ive been down many roads  
Sometimes life can be unkind  
I didnt wonder where Id go  
Didnt know what I might find  
What you got was not expected  
And when you feel that time is running out on you  
Chorus  
The winding road that takes me home  
Im going there someday I know  
The winding road that takes me home to you  
Is there beneath the shadows  
The winding road  
Memories of the love we had  
Never fade away  
Tears of joy for the promises  
That will come again someday  
When you walked out it was unexpected  
Im trying to find my way back to you  
Chorus  
The winding road  
The truth can leave you breathless  
And the truth can set you free  
Ive got all these questions  
Living inside of me inside of me  
Chorusx2  
The winding road  
The winding road  
The winding road
