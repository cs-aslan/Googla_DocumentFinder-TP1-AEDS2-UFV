Youre my Sun my Moon my guiding star  
My kind of wonderful thats what you are  
  
Chorus  
I know theres only only one like you  
Theres no way they could have made two  
Youre all Im living for  
Your love Ill keep for evermore  
Youre the first my last my everything  
  
In you Ive found so many things  
A love so new only you could bring  
Cant you see if you  
Youll make me feel this way  
Youre like a first morning dew on a brand new day  
  
I see so many ways that I can love you  
Till the day I die  
  
Youre my reality yet im lost in a dream  
Youre the first my last my everything  
  
Chorus
