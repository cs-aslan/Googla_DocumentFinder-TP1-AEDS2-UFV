I hold my breath as this life starts to take its toll  
I hide behind a smile as this perfect plan unfolds  
But oh God I feel Ive been lied to  
Lost all faith in the things I have achieved  
And I  
  
Ive woken now to find myself  
In the shadows of all I have created  
Im longing to be lost in you  
away from this place I have made  
Wont you take me away from me  
  
Crawling through this world as disease flows through my veins  
I look into myself but my own heart has been changed  
I cant go on like this  
I loathe all Ive become  
  
Ive woken now to find myself  
In the shadows of all I have created  
Im longing to be lost in you  
away from this place I have made  
Wont you take me away from me  
  
Lost in a dying world I reach for something more  
I have grown so weary of this lie I live  
  
Ive woken now to find myself  
In the shadows of all I have created  
Im longing to be lost in you  
away from this place I have made  
Wont you take me away from me
