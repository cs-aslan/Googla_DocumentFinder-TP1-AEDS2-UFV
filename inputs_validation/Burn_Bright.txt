Lately I dont recognize you  
The fire in your eyes is fading into embers  
So while youre out there in the darkness  
Im praying youll remember  
  
You were made to shine  
You were made for life  
Even if youve lost your way  
Turn and you will hear love say  
You were made for more  
So much more  
Child of everlasting light  
Made to blaze away the night  
So baby burn bright  
Burn bright  
  
You can rise up from the ashes  
Make something beautiful  
Of all the broken pieces  
And Im believing youll come running  
Into the arms of Jesus  
  
You were made to shine  
You were made for life  
Even if youve lost your way  
Turn and you will hear love say  
You were made for more  
So much more  
Child of everlasting light  
Made to blaze away the night  
So baby burn bright  
Burn bright  
  
There will always be somebody in the dark  
Ready to rain down on your last spark  
Trying to blow out your flame again  
They will do it if you let them  
Oh so dont you let them  
  
You were made to shine  
You were made for life  
Even if youve lost your way  
Turn and you will hear love say  
You were made for more  
So much more  
Child of everlasting light  
Made to blaze away the night  
So baby burn bright  
Burn bright  
  
Yeah  
Burn bright  
Yeah  
Burn bright  
  
Im believing youll come running  
Into the arms of Jesus
