Make love not war What the hell are we living for  
Lets kiss not fight Try to do whats right tonight

Verse  
tonight well make the prettiest sound that know one will  
ever hear know one will ever hear know one will ever  
  
These aint the times to be alone cliche the end is near  
cliche the end is near cliche the end is quickly  
Approaching why dont we carry on No one is  
Promised another day Why cant the story end like fairy  
tales often do Before I let you leave I got to say  
  
Chorus  
lets kiss not fight Try to do whats right tonight  
Make love not war What the hell are we living for  
Lets kiss not fight Try to do whats right tonight  
Make love not war What the hell are we living for  
  
Musical interlude  
  
Chorus  
lets kiss not fight Try to do whats right tonight  
Make love not war What the hell are we living for  
Lets kiss not fight Try to do whats right tonight  
Make love not war What the hell are we living for
