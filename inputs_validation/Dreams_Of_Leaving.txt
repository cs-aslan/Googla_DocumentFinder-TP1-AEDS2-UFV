Someone stopped the clock when we should have started early  
If we miss the morning meeting our lives will be in danger  
Someones trying to stop us there is someone in our party  
It is someone with a grudge and they wont let us reach the border  
  
Our lives are in his hands we pay with Krugerrands  
The currency of pain to help us leaving  
While back in our homeland the ones who make a stand  
Are taken from their homes and no one hears of them again  
  
I felt I had to come here I thought things would be better  
The situations changed but I find Im still resented  
Someone wants my job it is someone in this building  
Someones spreading rumors and I dont feel I can stay here  
  
I think Im going north and nows the time to leave  
The people there they say are good to strangers  
And if I do my best and try to settle in  
Im sure I can be just like someones neighbor  
  
Im sure I can be just like someones neighbor
