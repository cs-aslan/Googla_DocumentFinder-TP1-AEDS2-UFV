Alone upon the sidewalks of despair twas there she wandered with her
suitcase in her hand  
Her fate she pondered only a gogo girl in love with someone who didnt care  
She met him on a night so rare when her friends were there and the band was
grooving  
When he gave a glance that said how much he would like to meet her  
How was she to know at the time he would mistreat her  
  
In her case she danced for him although a hundred eyes were turned her way  
And before the set was through he knew she would be his loved one  
Only a gogo girl in love with someone who didnt care  
Only twentyone she was a young girl just in from somewhere  
  
Hes playing up in Michigan with a group they call The Intended  
With a kiss and a promise he was gone the song was ended  
But as she walks she waits for him the pavement is a shoulder for her tears  
But in her heart she knows there is no way she can hope to change him  
  
Only a gogo girl in love with someone who didnt care  
Only twentyone she was a young girl just in from somewhere  
Only a gogo girl in love with someone who didnt care a gogo girl in love
