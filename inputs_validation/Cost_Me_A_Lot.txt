J Cole  Verse 1  
Just one of them days  
A ngga feel like flossin  
A Stone Cold Stunna victim Steve Austin  
Cool as Drew Breeze Im blowing a few Gs  
Just to hear them hoes say hes awesome  
Hes awful yeah remember when ya fronted on me  
Pulled up beisde me in that big body and stunted on me  
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only  
Then he kicked me out the line yeah he punted on me  
Well look Im back btch back with an attitude  
Buying out the bar cause I feel like this the sht I gotta prove  
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved  
Now Im tipping the server a hundred to show my gratitude  
Easy told you Id be back baby I guess you aint believe me  
Now Im living just like the nggas you see on tv  
Vip feeling like this club oughta thank me  
I hit the bar just so yall can see Im ballin hd  
  
Chorus  
Its cost me a lot  
Big chains big whips with wood grain  
Its cost me a lot  
My God my watch make momma think someone might rob  
Its cost me a lot  
Fast life and till the gas light  
Copped the type of sht you couldnt get at half price  
Its cost me a lot  
Look but dont touch muthafcker think twice  
Its cost me a lot  
  
Now I dont love no material things  
But Im in love with the feelings they bring  
I got em like damn how how how he do that  
Damn how how how how he do that  
Now I dont love no material things  
But Im in love with the feelings they bring  
I got em like damn how how how he do that  
Damn how how how how he do that  
  
J Cole  Verse 2  
Uh knee deep in the game my chain heavy  
Somebody get the pilot and ask is the plane ready  
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we taking off  
Dont wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I cant take it off  
Cause how Im supposed to shine without the proper bling  
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame  
Felt naked cause the boy rocked bout a dozen chains  
Guess we rock a lot of ice cause we got a lot of pain  
Thats 5 hundred years of selling Im tryna tell em  
Jacob the Jeweller is cooler now he a felon  
Jay put a stamp on the ngga but wouldnt nail him  
If he couldnt sell him so what that tell him huh  
  
My chain heavy and my btches look very thorough  
Must be the money like dealing with the Jerry curl  
White Range call that Muthafcker Larry Bird  
I got em hanging on every word  
  
Chorus
