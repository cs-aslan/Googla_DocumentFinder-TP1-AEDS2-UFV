Aint no place you can hide that I cant find you  
Aint no place you can go where I wont be  
Lest you forget my dear let me remind you girl  
You may as well resign yourself to me  
  
Aint no door you can lock that I cant get through  
Aint no place you can undress where I cant see  
If youre marooned in space Ill come and get you girl  
You may as well resign yourself to me  
  
Dont think you fool me with that trench coat and them shades  
Im gonna wrap my arms around you like two gooey old band aides  
  
Aint no path you can take that I cant follow  
Im gonna buzz around your head just like a bee  
You may elude me tonight but come tomorrow girl  
You may as well resign yourself to me girl  
You may as well resign yourself to me
