Hey girl dont come to me and ask me for a helpin hand  
Cause by the way things seem to be I would never ever understand  
When he comes to you you always take him back  
Hey girl just wait and see youre bound to have a heartattack  
Cause whenever you meet  
It always turns out the same  
Youre treated bad again  
Treated bad again  
Hey girl why cant you learn that changes can be made  
Cause when he comes to you you got to turn and walk the other way  
Go out hit the town try to look for something new  
Go out mess around understand what you are going through  
Cause whenever you meet  
It always turns out the same  
Youre treated bad again  
Treated bad again  
So many nights  
My thoughts bring me to you  
Ive seen him come and go  
And so many years  
You dont know Ive been watching you  
But baby baby  
Would something change if you knew
