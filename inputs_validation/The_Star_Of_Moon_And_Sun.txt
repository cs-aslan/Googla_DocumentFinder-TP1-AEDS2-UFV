We fell in love on a hot summer night  
I looked at her she at me  
Love at first sight  
I made a lovers vow  
Shed be mine  
I said Id love her till the end of time  
And when she said  
Does it feel good  
Does it feel fine  
I said yeah yeah yeah  
  
Do bist der star unserer tage  
Do und ich no way back keine frage  
Youre the lucky one  
The star of moon and sun  
  
Love is a strange phenomenon  
It makes you happy sad its never fun  
Boy meets girl heart meets heart  
Like tigers they tear each other apart  
But when you say does it feel good  
Does it feel fine  
I say yeah yeah yeah  
  
Do bist der star unserer tage  
Do und ich no way back keine frage  
Youre the lucky one  
The star of moon and sun
