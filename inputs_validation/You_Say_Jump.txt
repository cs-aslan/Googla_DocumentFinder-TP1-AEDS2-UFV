You say jump I said how high  
You say no I dont ask why  
You treat me like a fool like you do  
Kick me when Im down and out  
Out with you I wish I was  
Instead Im sittin all alone tonight well  
  
Youve got a one track mind  
Wish you could just read mine  
I hope you will in time  
  
You say jump I said how high  
Love you but I dont know why  
Dont say no not tonight  
You call me or Ill call you  
Just as long as we get through  
Ill do anything for you tonight  
  
Second verse  
All dressed up no place to go  
I say yes and you say no  
Whats goin on  
I really want to know  
Youve got a one track mind  
Wish you could just read mine  
I hope you will in time  
  
You say jump I said how high  
Love you but I dont know why  
Dont say no not tonight  
You call me or Ill call you  
Just as long as we get through  
Ill do anything for you tonight  
  
Ive loved you from the start  
You only broke my heart  
I think Im losing my mind  
Ive felt this way for years  
Im the one who really cares  
Dont leave me here on my own  
You say jump I said how high  
Love you but I dont know why  
Dont say no not tonight  
  
Ive loved you from the start  
You only broke my heart  
Im sittin all alone tonight  
  
Kick me when Im down and out  
Out with you I wish I was  
Instead Im sittin here on my own  
Youve got a one track mind  
Wish you could just read mine  
I hope you will in time  
  
You say jump I said how high  
Love you but I dont know why  
Dont say no not tonight
