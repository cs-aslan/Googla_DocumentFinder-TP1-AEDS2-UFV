By design by neglect for a fact or just for effect  
When they met where they connect at the confluence of travel and sex  
More a trip than a quest plunged into the deeply freckled breast  
Where to now If I had to guess I am afraid to say Antarcticas next  
Or Chagrin Falls Ohio where the unknown wont even go  
To Chagrin Falls Ohio where the unknown wont even go  
Homes solitude with options artificial chaos isnt one of em  
Return there crestfallen Chagrin fell out of her apron  
No profound sound no special effects  
The continent tipped and she just quietly left  
Chagrin Falls on our heads not in a gush but in maddening droplets  
Chagrin Falls Chagrin Falls Chagrin Falls so falls Chagrin Falls  
So falls Chagrin Falls so falls Chagrin Falls
