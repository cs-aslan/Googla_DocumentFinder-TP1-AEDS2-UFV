Today I took a walk in the clouds  
Today I took a walk in the clouds  
Used to keep my eyes wide shut but now Im staring down  
  
Today I felt a switch in my vein  
Today I felt a switch in my vein  
Used to be a shadow now  
A shadow scream my name  
And in the daylight I could swear  
Were the same  
  
But Im just an ordinary human Ordinary ways  
Im just an ordinary human  
But I dont feel so ordinary today  
Im just a picture perfect nothing  
Sometimes I medicate  
Ill be a picture perfect human  
Before the sun goes down today  
  
Today I felt a switch in my vein  
Today I made them all afraid  
Used to be a shadow now  
A shadow scream my name  
And in the daylight I could swear  
Were the same  
But Im just an ordinary human Ordinary ways  
  
Im just an ordinary human  
But I dont feel so ordinary today  
Im just a picture perfect nothing  
Sometimes I medicate  
Ill be a picture perfect human  
Before the sun goes down today  
  
Just an ordinary human  
But I dont feel so typical today  
  
Therell be peace in the city tonight  
Peace in the city tonight  
But when Im gone  
I hope they get it right  
Therell be peace in the city tonight  
Peace in the city tonight  
For when Im gone  
I hope they get it right  
  
Just an ordinary human  
Ordinary ways  
Im ordinary human  
I dont feel so ordinary today  
  
But when Im gone  
I hope they get it right
