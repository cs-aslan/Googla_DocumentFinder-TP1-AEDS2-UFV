Darkness falls  
I thought I heard you call  
Or was it just a dream  
Im a little scared knowing youre out there  
So far away from me  
  
Its been so long  
Since youve been gone  
Every day I miss you more  
Now I wanna know  
Why did you have to go  
What were you looking for  
  
And I hope you find your way  
But I cant wait to say  
  
Youre home now not alone now  
These arms are here to hold you  
Dont need to be afraid  
So come in cause Ive been waiting for the moment  
To open up this door and I know that its not much  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
  
So you lost your way but thats yesterday  
And I dont care where youve been  
Cause every step youve taking since you left  
Has brought you back again  
And I hope you see it clear  
My love has always been right here  
  
Youre home now not alone now  
These arms are here to hold you  
Dont need to be afraid  
So come in cause Ive been waiting for the moment  
To open up this door and I know that its not much  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
  
Im glad you found your way  
And I hope you are here to stay  
Oooooooh  
  
Youre home now not alone now  
These arms are here to hold you  
Dont need to be afraid  
So come in cause Ive been waiting for the moment  
To open up this door and I know that its not much  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart
