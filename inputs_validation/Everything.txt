Youre a falling star Youre the get away car  
Youre the line in the sand when I go too far  
Youre the swimming pool on an August day  
And youre the perfect thing to say  
  
And you play it coy But its kinda cute  
Ah When you smile at me you know exactly what you do  
Baby dont pretend that you dont know its true  
Cause you can see it when I look at you  
  
Chorus  
And in this crazy life and through these crazy times  
Its you its you You make me sing  
Youre every line youre every word youre everything  
  
Youre a carousel youre a wishing well  
And you light me up when you ring my bell  
Youre a mystery youre from outer space  
Youre every minute of my everyday  
  
And I cant believe uh that Im your man  
And I get to kiss you baby just because I can  
Whatever comes our way ah well see it through  
And you know thats what our love can do  
  
Chorus  
And in this crazy life and through these crazy times  
Its you its you you make me sing  
Youre every line youre every word youre everything  
  
So La La La La La La La  
So La La La La La La La  
  
Chorus  
And in this crazy life and through these crazy times  
Its you its you you make me sing  
Youre every line youre every word youre everything  
Youre every song and I sing along  
Cause youre my everything  
Yeah yeah  
  
So La La La La La La La  
So La La La La La La La La La La La
