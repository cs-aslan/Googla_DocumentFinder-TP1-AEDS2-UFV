Theres a crack up in the ceiling  
And the kitchen sink is leaking  
Out of work and got no money  
A Sunday joint of bread and honey  
  
What are we living for  
Tworoomed apartment on the second floor  
No money coming in  
The rent collectors knocking trying to get in  
  
We are strictly second class  
We dont understand  
Dead end  
Why we should be on dead end street  
Dead end  
People are living on dead end street  
Dead end  
Gonna die on dead end street  
  
Dead end street yeah  
Dead end street yeah  
  
On a cold and frosty morning  
Wipe my eyes and stop me yawning  
And my feet are nearly frozen  
Boil the tea and put some toast on  
  
What are we living for  
Tworoomed apartment on the second floor  
No chance to emigrate  
Im deep in debt and now its much too late  
  
We both want to work so hard  
We cant get the chance  
Dead end  
People live on dead end street  
Dead end  
People are dying on dead end street  
Dead end  
Gonna die on dead end street
