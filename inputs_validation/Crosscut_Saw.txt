Im a crosscut saw  
Baby drag me across your log  
Im a crosscut saw  
Baby drag me across your log  
I cut your wood so easy for you  
You cant help but say Hot Dog  
  
Some call me Woodcutting Sam  
Some call me Woodcutting Jim  
The last girl I cut wood for  
She wants me back again  
  
Chorus  
Im a crosscut saw  
Baby drag me across your log  
I cut your wood so easy for you  
You cant help but say Hot Dog  
  
I got a doublebladed axe  
That really cuts good  
Well Im a crosscut saw  
Gonna bury me in your wood  
  
Chorus
