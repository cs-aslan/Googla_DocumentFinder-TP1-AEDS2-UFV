When I was a younger man  
When I was a silly boy  
I didnt need a thing I  
Was strong as anything I  
Viewed solitude as a joy  
  
But since I met you Im distraught  
You wandered in and now Im caught  
I never thought I would see  
Someone so truly good  
Some one whos so everything Im not  
  
I want to spend my life with you  
Dont want to live all alone  
I cant conceive of the years left in me  
Without you in our home  
  
But what if what if what if what  
If its not perfect then its not  
But every care Ill take  
Nothing I wont forsake  
To dwell beside what youve got  
  
Every time I think about you  
I think I cant live with you  
Ill tell you something  
I am nothing without you  
  
I want to spend my life with you  
Dont want to live all alone  
I cant conceive of the years left in me  
Without you in our home  
  
Hey  
  
I want to spend my life with you  
Dont want to live all alone  
I cant conceive of the years left in me  
Without you in our home  
  
Without you in our home
