Lately my son Ive been confused  
Dont know what to tell you  
Cause its all such bad news  
Lately my son Ive been discouraged  
I look around and it fills me with worry  
What kind of world can I offer to you  
Will it all lead  
Do we have the sense to make it through  
Ive tried to figure it out  
To have an answer I can tell to you  
But all I can see all I can see  
I am here for you you are here for me  
Its an on goin process  
I will take care of you you will take care of me  
If were gonna make some progress  
Lately my son I feel ashamed  
For many things that have happened  
And are happenin again  
Really my son I thought wed learned  
From what I see around me its still a very tough world  
But all I can hope is that you take it as a challenge  
To create something new that will take you far  
I know that you can manage  
To scatter some hope  
Cause its not too late to repair the damage  
The way it should be so easy to see  
That I am here for you and you are here for me  
Its an on goin process  
I will take care of you you will take care of me  
If were gonna make some progress  
Ohh  
You gotta believe never be afraid to dream  
But follow it through  
Cause it wont get done unless it comes from you  
You gotta make it all work  
For the ones that are comin after you  
Though hard it may seem you gotta believe  
I am here for you and you are here for me  
Its an on goin process  
I will take care of you you will take care of me  
If were gonna make some progress  
I am here for you  
Its an on goin process  
I will take care of you  
If were gonna make some progress  
I am here for you and you are here for me  
On goin process  
I will take care of you you will take care of me  
If were gonna make some progress
