He was always there each time I needed you  
Holding on to me like I held on to you  
We still dont have what you and I once had  
No Its Not Love But its not bad  
  
No Its Not Love not like our love Its Not Love  
But it keeps love from driving me mad  
And I dont have to wonder who hes had  
No Its Not Love But its not bad  
  
I turn to him when you leave me alone  
Sometimes even when youre here youre still gone  
Hee slowly changing what you leave so sad  
No Its Not Love But its not bad  
  
No Its Not Love not like our love Its Not Love  
But it keeps love from driving me mad  
And I dont have to wonder who hes had  
  
No Its Not Love But its not bad  
No Its Not Love But its not bad
