Chorus With a BANG Say goodbye to everythang  
Your complete anihilation is the reason he came  
And a POW Hes whipin everything out turn your whole fuckin world into a
mushroom cloud  
And a BOOM Its your inevitible doom nobody escapes and everybodys consumed  
  
Welcome to the Dark Carnival super show youre our specialy invited guests
and Ill tell you what fo  
Cause youre the evilest pedophiles rapists and abusers  
All together weve got  
Fiftythousand of you losers  
Youre all about to witness an incredible sight  
Nobodys ever lived to tell about it  
And dont think you might  
Its about to rain flames  
Frames and brains  
To be blown into peices is the reason you came  
Racist bigots wife beaters judges and cowards  
All crowded together expecting a show and some dollars  
But instead the shit youre gunna see  
Youll fear it in Hell  
It a constant explosion see and feel it you shall  
  
Chorus x1  
  
In the deserts of Nevada  
Where nothin else matta  
Its the perfect place for you and your intestines to splatta  
And while Bang Pow Boom steady stomps you all out  
Youre in the hole for the nuclear fall out  
With the snakes and fakes creapy sneaks  
Hooks and crooks and horney freaks  
Shaddy ladies evil ernies richy richs and charlie cheaps  
Bang Pow Boom they say the show is the bomb  
I heard its strait up explosive some even call it napalm  
Nobody battles back this aint no kinda war  
Its a one way execution blow you strait to hell through the floor  
What the fuck you think you here for sound the alarm  
Ladies and gentleman eat shit and die lets bring Im out  
  
Chorus x1  
  
The air is thick with sick demented brains and thoughts  
But here they are all together every one of them caught  
This is a celibration in fact the carnivals cheering  
Its not too often Bang Pow Boom makes an aperence  
And the winds in the sky will carry away all the ash  
But for now let us enjoy the big bang blast  
  
Chorus repeat until all fiftythousand can be fit into one ashtray
