They call it stormy Monday but Tuesdays just as bad  
They call it stormy Monday but Tuesdays just as bad  
Wednesdays worse and Thursdays also sad  
Yes the eagle flies on Friday and Saturday I go out to play  
Eagle flies on Friday and Saturday I go out to play  
Sunday I go to church then I kneel down and pray  
Lord have mercy Lord have mercy on me  
Lord have mercy my hearts in misery  
Crazy bout my baby yes send her back to me
