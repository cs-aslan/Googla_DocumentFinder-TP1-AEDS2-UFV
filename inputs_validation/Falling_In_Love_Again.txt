Falling in love again I never wanted to  
What am I to do I cant help it  
Love has always been my game play it how I may  
I was made that way I cant help it  
  
Men cluster to me like moths around a flame  
And if their wings burn I know Im not to blame  
Falling in love again I never wanted to  
What am I to do I cant help it  
  
Men cluster to me like moths around a flame  
And if their wings burn I know Im not to blame  
Falling in love again I never wanted to  
What am I to do I cant help it
