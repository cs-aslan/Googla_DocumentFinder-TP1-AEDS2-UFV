New sound all around  
You can hear it too  
Getting hot never stop  
Just for me and you  
Playing on my radio and saying that you had to go  
  
New day turn away  
Wipe away the tear  
New night feel right  
Knowing that youre here  
Dancing with you all the time and dont you think that its a crime  
  
Back street never meet  
Never say goodbye  
I know where you go  
But I dont know why  
You say that its from above and I say this is modern love
