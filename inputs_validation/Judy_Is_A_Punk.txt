Jackie is a punk  
Judy is a runt  
They both went down to Berlin joined the Ice Capades  
And oh I dont know why  
Oh I dont know why  
Perhaps theyll die oh yeah  
Perhaps theyll die oh yeah  
Perhaps theyll die oh yeah  
Perhaps theyll die oh yeah  
Second verse same as the first  
Jackie is a punk  
Judy is a runt  
They both went down to Berlin joined the Ice Capades  
And oh I dont know why  
Oh I dont know why  
Perhaps theyll die oh yeah  
Perhaps theyll die oh yeah  
Perhaps theyll die oh yeah  
Perhaps theyll die oh yeah  
Third verse different from the first  
Jackie is a punk  
Judy is a runt  
They both went down to Frisco joined the SLA  
And oh I dont know why  
Oh I dont know why  
Perhaps theyll die oh yeah  
Perhaps theyll die oh yeah  
Perhaps theyll die oh yeah  
Perhaps theyll die oh yeah
