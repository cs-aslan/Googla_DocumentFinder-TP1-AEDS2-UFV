In the beginning  
The nights were long  
Under the moonlight  
I could do no wrong  
You told me  
I was everything you wanted me to be  
  
Then summer was over  
And the nights grew cold  
You got restless  
And hard to hold  
I tried to be  
Everything you wanted me to be  
  
Now you keep staring  
At that open door  
You got what you wanted  
And you still want more  
Well look at me  
Im everything you wanted me to be  
  
Chorus  
Well if I dont keep you satisfied  
You cant say that I havent tried  
And if Im not what you want by now  
For the life of me I cant see how  
Ill ever be  
Everything that you want me to be  
  
In the beginning  
The nights were long  
Under the moonlight  
I could do no wrong  
Remember me  
I was everything you wanted me to be
