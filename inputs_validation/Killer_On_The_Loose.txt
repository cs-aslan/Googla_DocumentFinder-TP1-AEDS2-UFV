And I dont even know her name  
I might be looking for you  
Wherever you may be  
For there is something Ive got to do to you honey  
And its between you and me  
Now you might think its fun  
Or maybe its a joke  
But youve got plenty of reason to worry honey  
Cause you wouldnt stand a hope

Or Im not trying to make you scared  
But theres a killer on the loose
