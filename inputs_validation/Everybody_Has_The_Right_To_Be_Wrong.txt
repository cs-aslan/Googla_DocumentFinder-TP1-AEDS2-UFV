Everybody has the right to be wrong at least once  
Everybody has the right to be duncelike oncelike  
Not being too smart is is no disgrace  
What sets you apart is smilin with egg on your face  
  
Its naive to make believe that youre right its not bright  
Only fools go walking on thin ice twice  
  
You and life can skip the strife and youll both get along  
All it takes is simply saying youre wrong when youre wrong  
And everybody has the right to be wrong  
  
You and life can skip the strife and youll both get along  
All it takes is simply sayin youre wrong when youre wrong  
And everybody has the right to be  
  
It can be a real delight to be  
And Id fight fight for the right to be wrong at least once
