Doesnt Seem That Long Ago  
  
Three Of Us Walkin Down That Road  
  
Grey 55 Chevy Parked In The Front Yard  
  
Little Melody Tagged Along  
  
Those Were the Best Days Now Theyre Gone  
  
Oh Its Been Twelve Years Since It Went Down  
  
Lord Lost My Best Friend Now  
  
I Can See Him Fishin On That Old Dock  
  
I Know I Cant Bring Back Yesterday  
  
But Oh Lord Can You Help Me Find My Way  
  
Down To Brickyard RoadOh Walk On Down  
  
Down To Brickyard RoadHes With Me Now  
  
Swore I Say A Free Bird Fly  
  
Ridin The Winds Of The Southern Sky  
  
When I Hear That Whistle Blow  
  
It Carries Me Back  
  
To Brickyard Road  
  
Brother Do You Realize What Youve Done  
  
Touched The Hearts Of Everyone  
  
You Mightve Died Too Young  
  
But Your Songs Live On  
  
I Know I cant Bring Back Yesterday  
  
But Well Be All Together Again Some Day  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Repeat Chorus 2nd Time  
  
I Can See Him Standin On The Dock  
  
His Old Chevy Out In The Front Yard
