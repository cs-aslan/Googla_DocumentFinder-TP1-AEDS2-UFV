Yes a New Orleans woman  
Shes alright with me  
I said New Orleans woman  
Shes alright with me  
Thats my hometown Im talking about  
Cause when she cooks  
That good old Gumbo fillet  
Im happy as can be  
I love my baby  
Im gonna tell you the reason why  
Let you know the secret out  
Yes I love my baby  
Well Im gonna tell you the reason why  
Never told you this before  
Cause there aint a chance for a cutout  
Youve got to stay with me till the day I die
