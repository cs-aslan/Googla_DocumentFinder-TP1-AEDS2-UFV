I dont share  
Im not that type  
Your list and you  
Can walk on by  
One of many  
Not worth my while  
My one and only  
Now thats my style  
  
Chorus  
Yeahhh  
If you feel how I feel  
Then sing Yeahhh  
Look him in the eye and tell him  
I come first wont come second  
I come first wont come second  
I come first wont come second  
I come first or I dont come at all  
  
Im a priceless find  
Im supposed to be on a pedestal  
Not standing in line  
Oh no no no  
So make a choice  
Must decide  
Its them tonight  
Or me for life  
  
Chorus  
Yeahhh  
If you feel how I feel  
Then sing Yeahhh  
Look him in the eye and tell him  
I come first wont come second  
I come first wont come second  
I come first wont come second  
I come first or I dont come at all

Chorus  
Yeahhh  
If you feel how I feel  
Then sing Yeahhh  
Look him in the eye and tell him  
I come first wont come second  
I come first wont come second  
I come first wont come second  
I come first or I dont come at all  
  
I come first wont come second  
I come first wont come second  
I come first wont come second  
I come first or I dont come at all  
  
La La La La La La La La woahh  
La La La La La La La La ohh  
La La La La La La La La woahh  
La La La La La La La La ohh  
  
Or I dont come at all
