Ive been away from you a long time  
I never thought Id miss you so  
Somehow I feel your love is real  
Near you I long to be  
  
The birds are singing it is song time  
The banjos strummin soft and low  
I know that you  
Yearn for me too  
Swanee youre calling me  
  
Swanee  
How I love you how I love you  
My dear old Swanee  
Id give the world to be  
Among the folks in  
DIXIE ven now my Mammys waiting for me  
Praying for me  
Down by the Swanee  
  
The folks up north will see me no more  
When I go to the Swanee Shore  
  
Swanee  
How I love you how I love you  
My dear old Swanee  
Id give the world to be  
Among the folks in  
DIXIE ven now my Mammys waiting for me  
Praying for me  
Down by the Swanee  
  
The folks up north will see me no more  
When I go to the Swanee Shore  
Swanee Swanee Im coming back to Swanee  
Mammy Mammy I love the old folks at home  
  
Swanee Swanee I am coming back to Swanee  
Mammy Mammy I love the old folks at home
