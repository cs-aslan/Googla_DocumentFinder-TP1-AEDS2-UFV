Sitting on my back door wondering which way to go  
The suns shining on my back and it hurts child  
The FM station plays another bad 45  
And its been so long since I had a good time  
Its been so long since I had a good time  
  
Never wrecked my head on a bandstand  
in the trombone or clarinet line  
When I come in heat on Bourbon Street for Mardi Gras  
When those for a cryin just stay behind in the bar  
Cause its been so long since I had a good time  
Yeah its been so long since I had a good time  
  
Im gonna lose control of my powers  
I might even lose my trousers  
Smash some glass act like trash if I want  
Wear a skirt be a flirt if I want  
Cause its been so long since I had a good time  
This prodigal man from Dixieland needs a good time  
right now show me a good time right now  
  
You better take it while you can  
You gotta get it while you can  
  
And when the Man Upstairs he calls me  
Hell say Its your turn son to come  
Dont play the blues down in old Toulouse for me  
Let sleighbells ring and children sing in the street  
And tell all of my friends that I had a good time  
Open up the sky wont you ride me high  
Lets have a good time  
And if Im late at heavens gate blame a good time  
And when the angels sing I will join in  
Lets have a good time really  
  
I took my luck I didnt give a fuck I had a good time  
Tell all my friends only all my best to have a good time  
Goodbye
