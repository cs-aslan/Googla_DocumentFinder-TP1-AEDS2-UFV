An inspirational tirade against me How to explain my life  
Boys to the left of me girls to the right of me neither husband nor wife  
Though the days are filled with pain there is no one wholl explain why  
Im coming under friendly fire  
Shot in the fatal cause of rockandroll but theres nothing really nothing
to say  
  
Why I endure under force majeure slander without shame or tact  
I who studied makeup mime and Buddha who taught two generations to react  
About me the critics lied I ignored them and survived  
In spite of coming under friendly fire shot in the fatal  
Cause of rockandroll I have nothing really nothing to deny  
When I look back my eyes are filled with tears  
Danger to mascara applause to my peers  
When fame sustained me and arenas acclaimed me  
I floated through life in a cloud of love and insanity and pagan profanity  
Before a worshiping crowd Now my status is illdefined  
  
As an icon Im inclined to be coming under friendly fire  
Shot in the fatal cause of rockandroll  
But whatever dull or clever points theyve scored  
I have never oh no never been ignored
