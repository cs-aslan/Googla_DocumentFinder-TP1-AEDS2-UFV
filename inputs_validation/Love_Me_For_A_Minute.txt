Some girls are so fine sister sister  
Dont wanna change your mind but  
Some girls run home so optimistic  
About the love in their lives  
  
See the girls on parade  
In highfashion magazines  
And like some xrated movie  
Oh that fashion on the screen  
Enough for everyone to see  
I know that shes not ever going back again  
  
Well some girls you meet and  
Then you kissed her and she taste so sweet  
This girl you find out looks like her sister  
Yeah shes been coming around  
I see her backfields in motion  
She puts me under her spell  
Shes got some weird magic potion  
Some concrete cloud over you  
And I know its burnin hell  
I know that shes not ever going back again  
You see one shes coming with her newfound friend  
  
Oh love me for a minute stay with me tonight  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
Ill show you what its like on the other side of love  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
And shes not ever going back again  
You see one shes coming with her newfound friend  
  
Oh love me for a minute stay with me tonight  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
Ill show you what its like on the other side of love  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
Oh love me for a minute stay with me tonight  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
Ill show you what its like on the other side of love  
Take me in your arms and hold me
