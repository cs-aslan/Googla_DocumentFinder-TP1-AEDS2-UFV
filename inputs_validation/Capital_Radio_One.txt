Yes its time for the Dr Goebbels show  
Theres a tower in the heart of London  
With a radio station right at the top  
They dont make the city beat  
Theyre making all the action stop  
A long time ago there were pirates  
Beaming waves from the sea  
But now all the stations are silenced  
Cause they aint got a government license  
Want to tell your problems  
Phone in from your bedsit room  
Having trouble with your partner  
Let us all in on the news  
If you want to hear a record  
Get the word from Aiden Day  
He picks all the hits to play  
To keep you in your place all day  
Capital Radio  
In tune with nothing  
Dont touch that dial  
Dont touch that dial  
Dont touch that dial
