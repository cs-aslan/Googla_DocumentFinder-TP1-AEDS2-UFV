I never shall forget the day  
I heard my dear old mother say  
Im leaving now the old home dear  
remember Jack your mothers prayer  
She left me as the golden sun  
behind the hill top it did hide  
And when I found that she had gone  
I laid my guitar down and cried  
  
CHORUS  
And now shes gone this world is drear  
I long to have dear mother here  
Shes gone to join the angels there  
Ill not forget my mothers prayer  
  
The birds were still no sound was made  
The organ sad but sweetly played  
As by her side we gathered there  
Our heads bowed down in silent prayer  
We laid here where the fragrant rose  
was blooming oer her lonely grave  
And now in answer to her prayer  
Ill meet dear mother some sweet day  
  
CHORUS  
And now shes gone this world is drear  
I long to have dear mother here  
Shes gone to join the angels there  
Ill not forget my mothers prayer
