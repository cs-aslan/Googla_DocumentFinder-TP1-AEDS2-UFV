Bobby wants a 10speed an English racer  
Jenny wants that fuzzy teddybear  
Now your asking me  
What Id like from Santa for Christmas this year  
Theres a lot of things girl you could buy for me  
But they wouldnt mean as much as you standing by that tree  
  
Just put a ribbon in your hair darlin  
Youll be the best gift anywhere  
Christmas Mornin  
Theres no worldly treasure  
Id like any better than you standin there  
Just put a ribbon in your hair  
  
Mmmm  
  
Colored boxes filled with fancy presents  
They were mighty pretty sites its true  
But all those pretty things  
They just cant compare  
To the beauty in you  
Girl on christmas day  
The greatest gift I know  
Will be having you to hold  
Underneath the mistle toe  
  
Just put a ribbon in your hair darlin  
Youll be the best gift anywhere  
Christmas Mornin  
Theres no worldly treasure  
Id like any better than you standin there  
Just put a ribbon in your hair  
Just put a ribbon in your hair  
  
Oohhh baby
