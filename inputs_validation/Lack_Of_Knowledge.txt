Im not doing something Im supposed to do  
Im doing something Im not supposed to  
I dont know about that  
I dont know about that  
  
I dont know nothing bout nothing like that  
Destroyed my people are  
Destroyed my people are  
Destroyed for lack of knowledge  
  
I wonder if Im happy  
Wonder if Im mad  
I wonder why the whole wide world is so wonderfully sad  
I dont know bout that but I can tell you this  
  
That when I drink a lot of beer whyknow I gotta piss off  
People should be pissed off  
People should be pissed off  
For lack of knowledge  
  
Read read read read read read read everything you can read and  
Learn learn learn learn learn learn learn everything you can learn  
Cause there is no tomorrow like today  
And there is no today like tomorrow  
  
And they will stick you and they will stick you in the end
