Leisure  
  
They taught me how to work  
But they cant teach me how to shirk correctly  
  
As you see  
Science once again robs us of our jobs  
Theyve put a microchip in my place  
I hide behind screen of aggression nowadays  
Its just a way of saving some face  
So now Im permanently drunk  
Like the rest of the race with  
Leisure  
  
If you think Im clowning  
I assure you that Im drowning here in  
Leisure  
  
They taught me how to work  
But they cant teach me how to shirk correctly  
  
I spend all day  
And all my allowance on TV games  
Amusement heaven at the flick of a switch  
Instead of a lathe I busy my fingers nowadays  
By scoring goals with the gentlest twitch  
Ive forgotten how to use my legs to invade the pitch  
Leisure  
  
If you think Im clowning  
I assure you that Im drowning here in  
Leisure  
  
They taught me how to work  
But they cant teach me how to shirk correctly  
  
They had retired me fore I left school  
just saw no point in the standing in line  
So I spend lots of time lounging at home  
why not come in cause the carpet is fine  
What a waste of breath it is  
Searching for the jobs that dont exist  
So now Im permanently drunk  
Like the rest of the race with  
Leisure  
  
If you think Im clowning  
I assure you that Im drowning here in  
Leisure  
  
They taught me how to work  
But they cant teach me how to shirk correctly  
  
Lazybones looking through The Sun  
Howd you ever expect to find your days work
