My good gal left and I cant stand this pain  
When she walked out my teardrops fell like rain  
So set em up Joe and give me some dimes  
Ive got an appointment with a friend of mine  
Im gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long  
  
Cause the wedding bells will never ring for me  
And that whippoorwill aint got no sympathy  
Im broken down and torn apart  
The moanin blues and your cheatin heart  
Im gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long  
  
But lovesick blues sure aint no state of mind  
Mixed with broken heart and Juke joint wine  
But I aint leavin done turned in my keys  
The bartender told me stay as long as you please  
Im gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long  
  
Ah cause those wedding bells will never ring for me  
And that whippoorwill aint got no sympathy  
Im broken down and torn apart  
Whiskey bent and your cheatin heart  
Im gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long  
  
Cause the wedding bells will never ring for me  
Long gone lonesome blues sure fits me to a tee  
Im broken down and torn apart  
Whiskey bent and your cheatin heart  
Im gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long  
  
Why dont you love me like you used to do  
Yeah all night long
