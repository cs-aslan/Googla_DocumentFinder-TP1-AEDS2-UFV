When the music fades  
All is stripped away  
And I simply come  
Longing just to bring  
Something thats of worth  
That will bless Your heart  
  
Ill bring You more than a song for a song in itself  
Is not what You have required  
You search much deeper within through the way things appear  
Youre looking into my heart  
  
Chorus  
Im coming back to the heart of worship  
And its all about You all about You Jesus  
Im sorry Lord for the thing Ive made it  
When its all about You all about You Jesus  
  
King of endless worth  
No one could express how much You deserve  
Though Im weak and poor  
All I have is Yours evry single breath  
  
Ill bring You more than a song for a song in itself  
Is not what You have required  
You search much deeper within through the way things appear  
Youre looking into my heart  
  
Chorus
