And when the sunshine showed  
Her face I felt like I was ready to die  
Went lookin for a place to hide  
A hole I could crawl inside  
  
Long lines  
Whiskey bottles  
And the same old song  
I smell death in the air  
And I know it wont be long  
  
And I could say Im trying to change  
But thats just another lie  
Its been a day and a half  
And Im still high  
  
And I feel like Jackson Mississippi  
A river runnin  
Like Jackson Mississippi  
A river runnin  
Like Jackson Mississippi  
A river runnin through my viens  
  
And when the daylight disappeared  
I took a good look inside  
Behind my pride  
I sat down and cried  
  
I know Im not a fool  
But I dont know whats wrong  
Maybe its time to pack  
And just move on  
  
And I could say Im trying to change  
But that would just be a lie  
Im lookin for some one to tell me why
