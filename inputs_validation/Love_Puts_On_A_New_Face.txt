He said You think youre a lady  
But I know youre a woman  
We are as young as the night  
I said No telephones ringing  
No company coming  
Just the lap of the lake and the firelight  
And the lonely loon and the crescent moon  
What a pocket of heavenly grace  
But in France they say  
Everyday  
Love puts on a new face  
Love has many faces  
  
About a month or so later he said  
Why cant you be happy  
You make me feel helpless when you get this way  
I said Im up to my neck in alligators  
Jaws gnashing at me  
Each one trying to pull a piece away  
Darling you cant slay these beasts of prey  
Some bad dreams even love cant erase  
But in France they say  
Everyday  
Love puts on a new face  
Love has many faces  
  
He said I wish you were with me here  
The leaves are electric  
They burn on the river bank  
Countless heatless flames  
I said Send me some pictures then  
And Ill paint pyrotechnic  
Explosions of your autumn till we meet again  
I miss your touch and your lips so much  
I long for our next embrace  
But in France they say  
Everyday  
Love puts on a new face  
Love puts on a new face  
Love has many faces  
Many many faces
