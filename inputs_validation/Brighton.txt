Walking alone along the board walking Brighton  
The sun is high and so am I I feel enlightened  
Mother natures taking care of me  
Rocks me gently naturally  
Seems like the sea was put there  
Just for me  
  
Running upon the beaches of my childhood  
I should have stayed forever if only I could  
Coney Island on a Sunday night  
Rollercoaster rides neon lights  
  
Me and my Brighton baby used to do alright  
  
Lalala lalala lalala lalarandaada  
  
Lalala lalala lalala lalarandaada  
  
Comes a time when eventually  
Ill have to leave here permanently  
Now that old Brighton has become  
A part of me  
  
Lalala lalala lalala lalarandaada  
  
Lalala lalala lalala lalarandaada  
  
Comes a time when eventually  
Ill have to leave here permanently  
  
Now that old Brighton has become a part of me  
Now that old Brighton has become a part of me
