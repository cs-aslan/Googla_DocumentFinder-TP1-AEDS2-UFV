Ill go back to Manhattan  
As if nothing ever happened  
When I cross that bridge  
Itll be as if this dont exist  
Have a prince who is waiting  
And a kingdom downtown  
Ill go back to Manhattan  
As if nothing ever happened  
  
Dont have to speak at all  
One look in your eyes  
And I wont have to fall  
Dont have to speak at all  
  
Brooklyn holds you  
And holds my heart too  
What a fool I was to think  
I could live in both worlds  
  
Dont have to speak at all  
One look in your eyes  
And I wont have to fall  
Dont have to speak at all  
  
I should go back to Manhattan  
Its just a train ride away  
I know nothing about leaving  
But I know I should do it today
