I aint gonna sing no lonesome tune  
Ah babe Im acommin soon  
I cannot believe I stayed so long away  
But a man must look around  
And youre the sweetest thing Ive found  
Your lost high rollers rollin home today  
  
My daddy said to me  
Son its hard as you will see  
To find someone upon whom to rely  
In the kitchen mama sneezed  
And he grinned big as you please  
Said bless you and a tear come to his eye  
  
I did decide that very day  
That I would like to live that way  
And now I know I just been wastin time  
Its with you that I should be  
If you feel the same bout me  
Im headed home along the straightest line
