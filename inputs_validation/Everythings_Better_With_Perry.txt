Verse 1  
We consider every day a plus  
To spend it with a platypus  
Were always so ecstatic  
Cause hes semi aquatic  
Our Ornithorhynchus anatinus  
Brings smiles to the both of us  
Lifes never fuddie duddy  
With our webfooted buddy  
When were brushing our teeth Its better  
Tying our shoes Its better  
Combing our hair Its better  
Like were a cheese sandwich and hes the cheddar  
Blinking our eyes Its better  
Breathing in and out Its better  
Sitting in a chair Its better  
And taking a bath is just a little bit wetter  
  
PreChorus  
Every day is such a dream  
When you start it with a monotreme  
Hes duckbilled and hes beaver tailed and hairy  
  
Chorus  
Everythings better with Perry  
Everythings better with Perry  
Everythings better with Perry  
Everythings better with Perry  
Everythings better with Perry  
Everythings better with Perry  
Everythings better and we  
Just want to tell you Perry  
Everythings better with you
