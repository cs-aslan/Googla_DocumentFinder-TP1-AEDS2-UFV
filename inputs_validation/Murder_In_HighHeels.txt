Hey with a sleight of hand and then a word of mouth  
Shes a cat been caged too long and now shes breakin out  
Well get it straight you better cross your heart  
Cause sparks are gonna fly let me tell you what its all about  
Better run for cover babe shes gonna make her move  
You know she could shes a get rich bitch  
You better get her while the gettins good  
  
Shes a vision in leather like salt on a wound  
Just a turn of a knob and shes real fine tuned  
  
But shes murder in highheels  
  
She aint the girl next door worth waitin for  
Well youre playin with the fire a pool of sweats lyin on the floor  
Shell bring you to your knees and when youre laid to rest  
Shes gonna give you something shes gonna get it off her chest  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Shes a vision in leather like salt on a wound  
Just a turn of a knob and shes real fine tuned  here she comes  
  
Hes a vision in leather like salt on a wound  
Just a turn of a knob and shes real fine tuned  
  
But shes murder in high heels
