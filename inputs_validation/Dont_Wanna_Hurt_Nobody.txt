You already know who it is nigga King of Da Ghetto

But motherfuckers keep fuckin with me doe mayne  
  
In case you dont know my name Im bout to tell you my name  
ZRo the crooked King of Da Ghetto all about my change  
I remember when Joseph wasnt able to have thangs  
Now Im able to flip a 300M and grab grain  
Theres some niggaz mad at me cause I got cash mayne

Remember flippin with a brick in the dash mayne  
Now every time I roll up bitch give me bombass brain  
  
Probably be somebody baby momma I aint ask mayne  
Baby daddy got a problem we can hit the grass mayne  
An asshole by nature livin in the fast lane  
Stay rilla fo reala fuck with me and thats yo ass mayne  
Honor roll student but I dropped out of class mayne  
Aint got a diploma but got knots of cash mayne

Dont wanna hurt nobody just leave me the fuck alone  
Dont wanna hurt nobody just get me through my day  
Dont wanna hurt nobody just leave me the fuck alone  
Dont wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around  
And bust your brain

And thats the result of everywhere you go niggaz hate ya  
And I aint trippin Ima catch one of them marks on the back street  
With the black heat slugs run up like a track meet  
  
Im an anybody killa but everybody can get it  
Servin suckers in neighborhoods got it crackin like a stick  
I didnt come to hurt nobody but you bumped into mine  
But we gangsters I pull a fo and told you po out that wine  
If I wanted flex I coulda got a strap at that moment

Dont wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around  
And bust your brain  
  
Now I dont wanna hurt nobody but thats a lie  
Cause its a delight for me to bust a lip or black an eye  
Or smoke a nigga like a syrup covered black n mild  
So dont fuck with me when Im tryin to make money stackin piles  
Some niggaz trie to rob me before try to jack me now  
Fuck Danny Glover Im the lethal weapon with maxi nine  
Cant a nigga lavish any mo  
Without a gang of niggaz and they kickin in his do  
  
And nine times out of ten itll be one of my friends  
Thatll lead me to my grave murder me to get my ends  
Do the crime and make a cape escape from my residence  
But still show up at my funeral services n shit  
I aint fin to let it happen to me you gon respect me  
Aint gon be no bad actin with me homie  
And to you haters Im a waiter waitin to serve somebody  
I kill all you motherfuckers but I  
  
Dont wanna hurt nobody just leave me the fuck alone  
Dont wanna hurt nobody just get me through my day  
Dont wanna hurt nobody just leave me the fuck alone  
Dont wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around  
And bust your brain
