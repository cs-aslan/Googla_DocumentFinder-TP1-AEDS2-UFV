Here I am fallin again in places that Ive already been  
I sure didnt plan it and I dont understand it but here I am fallin again  
Here I am lyin again making up places that Ive never been  
I thought I was through with these heart breaking blues but here I am lyin
again  
Why dont a man ever take time to think what is at stake  
Is it the danger or the pleasurable stranger but those are the chances well
take  
Id hate to come face to face with her and her at the same place  
Cause it will be hell If I had to tell her someone has taken her place  
  
I had a beautiful wifeshe found it all out one night  
And the pleasurable stranger lord I didnt change her and I lost it all this
time  
So here I am cryin again and callin symphothy from my ole friends  
He once loved her and she once him and here I am cryin again
