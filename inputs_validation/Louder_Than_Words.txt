I can hear your thoughts  
Like footsteps in the dark  
The pain stirs in your voice  
Cuts like daggers to my heart  
  
Dont you be afraid  
Baby Im here  
Stop running from love  
Baby dont you fear  
  
Cause its louder  
So much louder than words  
Baby its louder  
So much louder than words  
  
Cause its louder  
So much louder than words  
Baby its louder  
So much louder than words  
  
Play the simple game  
With all your broken rules  
Im calling out your name  
But my heart just still refuses  
  
Dont you be afraid  
Baby Im here  
Stop running from love  
Baby dont you fear  
  
Cause its louder  
So much louder than words  
Baby its louder  
So much louder than words  
  
Cause its louder  
So much louder than words  
Baby its louder  
So much louder than words
