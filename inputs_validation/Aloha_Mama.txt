Aloha mama dont go away  
Aloha mama I want you to stay  
  
Aloha mama wont you treat me right  
I need you tender woman wont you hold me tight  
Surf ridin sister I want to taste your love  
Les make it in the garden beneath the stars above  
  
Aloha mama dont go away  
Aloha mama I want you to stay  
  
Aloha mama have you got the cure  
My hearts all broken and I feel unsure  
Surf ridin sister I got to fly away  
Ill be back in September thats the price I pay  
  
Aloha mama dont go away  
Aloha mama I want you to stay  
  
Cant you feel the trade winds blowin  
Theres a look in your eyes youre goin  
Dont leave me now Im a hurtin  
If youd look in my eyes youd see hunger arise  
Cant you feel all these years Ive been cryin these years  
  
Aloha mama dont go away  
Aloha mama I want you to stay  
  
Aloha mama dont make me cry  
Aloha mama you know Ill die  
  
Aloha mama dont go away  
Aloha mama I want you to stay
