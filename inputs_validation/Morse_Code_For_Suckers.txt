I heard opposites attract so youre stuck with me  
Im like Jack Kerouac on the road for weeks  
But when I come home youll be there for me right  
Without you Ill never make it  
  
I got a sick sense I got a reason to worry  
And sometimes Im dense but these thoughts come in a flurry  
You say theyre nonsense but I dreamt you left in a hurry  
I dont think Ill ever make it alone  
  
Annihilate Im wide awake  
Dont walk away Im suffocating  
  
Dont change your mind cause youll be killing me  
Hitting another all time low and theres no where left to go  
Make up your mind dont be the death of me  
If you want me here I am counting down to zero  
  
I got a panic attack like you wouldnt believe  
And my breathings out of whack like a drum machine  
I know if I pass out youd resuscitate me right  
Without you Ill never make it  
  
Is it okay now or did you meet someone better  
Without a Mohawk with a real job and a sweater  
Leaving me shell shocked steady getting ready for a header  
I dont think Ill ever make it alone  
  
Annihilate Im wide awake  
Dont walk away Im suffocating  
  
Dont change your mind cause youll be killing me  
Hitting another all time low and theres no where left to go  
Make up your mind dont be the death of me  
If you want me here I am counting down to zero  
  
Standing on the edge of the great divide  
Youre pushing all the right buttons to make worlds collide  
Would you stab me in the back like a homicide  
Or leave me buried in your bullshit like a landslide  
  
Are you biding your time with me  
Waiting for someone better to come along  
As I sit and I scream this song  
  
Are you biding your time with me  
Waiting for someone better to come along  
If you are I proved you wrong  
  
Both ends burn Ill be waiting for you  
I wont turn Ill be waiting for you  
Both ends burn Ill be waiting for you  
  
Dont change your mind cause youll be killing me  
Hitting at an all time low and theres no where left to go  
  
Dont change your mind cause youll be killing me  
Striking at an all time low and theres no where left to go  
Make up your mind dont be the death of me  
If you want me here I am counting down to zero
