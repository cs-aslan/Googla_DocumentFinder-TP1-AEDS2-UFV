You cant be still  
Youre such a nervous fellow  
Like a yoyo  
Up and down  
  
Take this little pill  
And life will be so mellow  
Youll feel the world  
Start slowing down around  
  
Whos that rushing out the door  
Whos not taking any more  
Whos been down this road before  
Without you  
  
You tell me whos number one  
Whos not here  
Whos having fun  
Whos the one who cares this much  
About you  
  
You wont feel the pain  
You wont mind the rain  
You can be happy all the time  
All the time  
One dose twice a day  
The world will go away  
Youll be smiling through  
The worst of times  
Whos that rushing out the door  
Whos not taking any more  
Whos been down this road before  
Without you  
  
You tell me whos number one  
Whos not here  
Whos having fun  
Whos the one  
Who knows so much about you  
  
I believe I belive  
Theres something more  
I believe its just beyond the door  
I believe theres something more  
I believe its just  
Beyond the door  
I believe theres something  
Better out there  
  
Want to leave this world  
So far behind  
I can see your face there  
In my mind  
I believe theres something  
Better our there  
  
Whos that rushing  
Whos not taking  
Whos been down this  
You tell me whos  
Whos not here whos  
Whos the one who  
  
Something better  
Something better  
Something better  
Something better  
Something better
