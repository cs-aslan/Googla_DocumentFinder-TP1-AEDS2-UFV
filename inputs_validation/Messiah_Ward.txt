I hope youre sitting comfortably  
I saved you the best seat in the house  
Right up in the front row  
The stars have been torn down  
The moon is locked away  
And the land is banked in frozen snow  
  
You are a forte of nature dear  
Your breath curls from your lips  
As the trees bend down their branches  
And touch you with their fingertips  
Theyre bringing out the dead now  
Its easy just to look away  
They are bringing out the dead now  
Its been a strange strange day  
  
We could navigate out position by the stars  
But theyve taken out the stars  
The stars have all gone  
Im glad youve come along  
We could comprehend our  
Condition by the moon  
But theyve ordered the the moon not to shine  
Still I m glad youve come along  
I was worried out of my mind  
Cause they keep bringing out the dead  
Its easy just to look away  
Theyre bringing out the dead now  
And its been a long strange day  
  
You can move up a little closer  
I will throw a blanket over  
We can weigh all the tears in one hand  
Against the laughter in the other  
We could be hanging around here for centuries  
Trying to make sense of this my dear  
While the planets try to get organised  
Way above the stratosphere  
But they keep bringing out the dead now  
Its easy if we just walk away  
They keep bringing out the dead now  
Its been a long long day  
  
Look away  
Look away
