You talked me into the game of chance  
It was 39 before the music started  
When you walked up to me and you said  
Hey heads we dance  
Well I didnt know who were  
Until I saw the morning paper  
  
There was a picture of you  
A picture of you cross the front page  
It looked just like you just like you in every way  
But it couldnt be true  
It couldnt be true  
You stepped out of a stranger  
  
They say that the Devil is a charming man  
And just like you I bet he can dance  
And he is coming up behind in his long  
Tailed black coat dance  
All tails in the air  
But the penny landed with its head dancing  
  
A picture of you a picture of you in uniform  
Standing with your head held high  
Hot down to the floor  
But it couldnt be you  
It couldnt be you  
Its a picture of Hitler  
  
He go dododododo  
He go dododododo  
He go dododododo  
Do you want to dance  
Well I couldnt see what was to be  
So I just stood there laughing  
  
A picture of you a picture of you in uniform  
Standing with your head held high  
Hot down to the floor  
But it couldnt be you  
It couldnt be you  
Its a picture of Hitler  
  
He go  
He go  
He go  
Heads were dancing
