Not a day goes by  
Not a single day  
But youre somewhere a part of my life  
And it looks like youll stay  
As the days go by  
I keep thinking when does it end  
Wheres the day Ill have started forgetting  
But I just go on thinking and sweating  
  
And cursing and crying  
And turning and reaching  
And waking and dying  
And no not a day goes by  
Not a blessed day  
But youre still somehow part of my life  
And you wont go away  
So theres hell to pay  
And until I die  
Ill die day after day after day  
After day  
After day after day after day  
Til the days go by  
Til the days go by  
Til the days go by
