Weaving a web around my heart  
Slowly taking my world apart  
I cant begin to think of anything else  
Left my reason way up on a shelf  
Stealing away without a sound  
My feet dont hardly touch the ground  
I look at the clock the hands of fate  
The train Im riding cant be late  
Riding on that dream train   
One look in your eyes and I follow through  
Riding on that dream train   
Been a rider since I met you  
The brush of her skirt the look in her eye  
No use denying the curve of her thigh  
I got a feeling Im out on limb  
Past committing original sin  
Cold steel on a railroad track  
Hard heart I aint coming back  
Put the border on red alert  
Heed the warning youre gonna get hurt
