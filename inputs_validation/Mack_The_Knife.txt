See the shark with teeth like razors  
And he wears them in his face  
And Macheath has got a knife  
But not in such an obvious place  
  
Now see the shark how red his fins are  
As he slashes at his prey  
Mack the Knife wears fancy gloves  
Which gives a minimum away  
  
By the Thames turbid waters  
Men abruptly tumble down  
Well is it plague or is it cholera  
Or because Mackys in town  
  
And the child bride in her nighty  
Whose assailants still at large  
Violated in her slumbers  
Macky how much did you charge  
  
In the ghastly fire in Soho  
Seven children had a go  
In the crowd stands Mack the Knife  
But he isnt asked and he dont know  
  
In the crowd stands Mack The Knife  
But he aint asked and he dont know
