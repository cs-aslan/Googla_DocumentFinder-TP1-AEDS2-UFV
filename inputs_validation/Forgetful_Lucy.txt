Lawookeelow is the place  
Where I first saw your face  
We liked each other right away  
But you didnt remember me the very next day  
  
Forgetful Lucy  
Has got a nice cabooseie  
  
I used to trick you into pulling your car over so we could chat  
But my favorite time was when you beat the shit out of Ula with a bat  
Then we drove up to see Dr Keets  
And find out why Doug always has to change his sheets  
  
Forgetful Lucy  
Cracked her head like Gary Busey  
  
But I still love her so  
And Ill never let her go  
Even if while Im singing this song  
Shes wishing I had Jocko the Walrus shlong  
  
Forgetful Lucy  
Her lips are so damn juicy  
How about another first kiss
