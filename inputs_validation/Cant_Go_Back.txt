Standin in the shadows  
The man I used to be  
I wanna go back  
cant go back cant go back  
Melodies awaken  
Sorrows from their sleep  
I wanna go back  
cant go back cant go back  
She was just a dream maker  
Dreamer of sighs  
Shadow on the one who used to cry  
A face as soft as a tear in a clowns eye  
I wanna go back  
cant go back cant go back  
She was just a dream maker  
Dreamer of sighs  
Shadow on the one who used to cry  
A face as soft as a tear in a clowns eye  
I wanna go back  
cant go back cant go back
