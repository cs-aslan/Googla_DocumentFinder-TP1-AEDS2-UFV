Is it day is it night am I losin my sight is it over or were really through  
I cant see you in my arms anymore and I cant see me without you  
I cant see me without you to lean on and I cant see you leavin or gone  
I could never see anything you wanted me to and I cant see me without you  
  
I see the house you once called your own and I see the door you walked through  
I see the road youre leavin me on and I cant see me without you  
I cant see me
