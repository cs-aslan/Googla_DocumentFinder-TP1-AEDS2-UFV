You dont have to cry yourself to sleep at night with wet pillows  
Girl I know youre hurt  
Did you know that you can dry your pillows with your dreams and smile  
It really works  
Lay your head back in my arms oh I know your worth  
So just reach inside your heart and pack your bags  
And lets leave this earth  
  
Lets aim high oh girl  
All you gotta do is close your eyes and  and visualize  
Lets aim high  
  
You work so hard for your boss to him its just work  
Never considers your dreams selfish and mean  
Damn thats gotta hurt  
  
Just lay your head back in my arms girl  
I know youre worth  
So allow me indulge your mind with these words  
Open your eyes youre now a bird  
  
Lets aim high girl  
All you gotta do is close your eyes and  and visualize  
  
You possess the power to do  
If you concentrate mountains will move  
If you just believe that its true  
Please make no mistake Ill be there too  
  
You possess the power to do  
If you concentrate mountains will move  
If you just believe that its true  
Make no mistake Ill be there too  
Lets aim high
