Dolly  
Spoken  
Well Horace it looks as if theres nothing more for me to say but  
Sung  
Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye  
Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye  
Dont try to stop me Horace please  
Wave your little hand and whisper  
So long dearie  
You aint gonna see me anymore  
But when you discover that your life is dreary  
Dont you come a knockin at my door  
For Ill be all dolled up  
And singin that song  
That says you dog I told you so  
So wave your little hand and whisper  
So long dearie  
Dearie should have said so long  
So long ago  
  
Because youve treated me so rotten and rough  
Ive had enough of feelin low  
So wave your little hand and whisper  
So long dearie  
Dearie would have said so long  
So long ago  
  
For I can hear that choo choo callin me on  
To a fancy new address  
Yes I can hear that choo choo callin me on  
On board that happiness express  
Im gonna learn to dance and drink and smoke a cigarette  
Im gon as far away from Yonkers as a girl can get  
  
Spoken  
And on those cold winter nights Horace  
You can snuggle up to your cash register  
Its a bit lumpy but it rings  
  
Sung  
Dont come a knockin  
Ill be all dolled up  
And singin that song  
That says you dog I told you so  
So Horace you will find your life a sad old story  
When you see your Dolly shuffle off to glory  
Oh I should have said so long  
So Long ago
