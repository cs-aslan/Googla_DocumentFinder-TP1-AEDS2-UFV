Girl as you walk by  
I breathe a sigh  
And deep inside I knew it had to be  
This little girl is mine  
And for a little while I heard a strange rhapsody  
Hm  
  
So lovely and so fair Fair  
I knew right then and there There  
That you were made for me  
And it wasnt hard to see  
I guess I was born to love you Born to love you  
Born to love you Born to love you  
Hm Born to love you  
  
Honey I I was born to love you  
Give my love to no one but you  
  
Here stands a man with his future in your hands  
Dont let go Dont let go  
Dont let go Dont let go  
Baby dont let her go Dont let go  
Please Dont let go  
  
You better come on and take my hand  
Cause I dont understand this crazy feeling in my soul  
But I know that I would rather die then let this feeling go  
  
Now girl cant you see See  
That this was meant to be Be  
Its funny but its true  
I guess I was just born to love you Born to love you  
  
Darling Born to love you  
Darling I Born to love you  
I was born Born to love you  
Born to love only you Born to love you  
  
Why dont you believe Born to love you  
Believe what I tell you baby Born to love you  
I was born to love only you Born to love you  
Born to love you  
  
Darling Born to love you  
I Born to love you  
Oh our love is true  
Born to love you
