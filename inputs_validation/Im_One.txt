Every year is the same  
And I feel it again  
Im a loser no chance to win  
Leaves start fallin  
Come down is callin  
Loneliness starts sinking in  
  
But Im one  
I am one  
And I can see  
That this is me  
And I will be  
Youll all see  
Im the one  
  
Where do you get  
Those blue blue jeans  
Faded patched secret so tight  
Where do you get  
That walk oh so lean  
Your shoes and your shirt all just right  
  
Im one  
I am one  
And I can see  
That this is me  
And I will be  
Youll all see  
Im the one  
  
I got a Gibson  
Without a case  
But I cant get that even tanned look on my face  
Ill fitting clothes  
And I blend in the crowd  
Fingers too clumsy  
Voice too loud  
  
But Im one  
I am one  
And I can see  
That this is me  
And I will be  
Youll all see  
Im the one  
  
Im the one  
  
Im the one
