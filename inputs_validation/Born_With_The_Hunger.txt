Hear the coyote howl  
Hes found his prey at last  
In one moment of weakness  
The chase is over so fast  
He celebrates his kill  
No mercy in his eyes  
When youre born with the hunger  
The hunger never dies  
Midnight is on the prowl  
And I hear it call my name  
Danger lurks in the shadows  
But its all part of a game  
Until I quench this thirst  
I will not close these eyes  
When youre born with the hunger  
The hunger never dies  
You and I were the same  
We both carry this flame  
To depths of our souls  
Once this fever awakes  
We can never escape  
Its beyond our control  
Were all born with the hunger  
Were all born with the hunger  
Temptation bites your lip  
One kiss ignites the fire  
So begins the seduction  
As we succumb to desire  
Your body aches for more  
Why are you so surprised  
When youre born with the hunger  
The hunger never dies  
When youre born with the hunger  
The hunger  it never dies
