I dont do the things that you do  
And I dont go the places that you go  
And I dont say the bad things that you say  
  
But I love you any ole way darling  
I love you any ole way now  
I love you any ole way  
But I want you to say that its true  
  
Wherever you go darling I will go  
When you get there honey I will be there  
Just to hear the sweet words that you say  
Its I love you every way now  
I love you any ole way now now  
I love you every way  
And I want you to say that its true  
  
Sitting on my hutch  
Waiting for her to come  
So I can hold her  
Here in my arms  
Watching my watch  
As the time pass  
Wandering how long my love is going to last now  
  
Baby one more time  
Youre making me feel all right oh oh now  
  
Wherever you go darling I will go  
Whenever you get there I bet I will be there  
Just to hear the sweet words that youll say  
  
Is I love you every way now now  
I love you any ole way now  
I love you every way now now  
And I love you any ole way now  
And I love you any ole way now  
  
Im just wanting you just more every day now  
Im just wanting you more and more every day  
And Im just needing you and needing and needing you ooh  
And Im just wanting and wanting and wanting you more
