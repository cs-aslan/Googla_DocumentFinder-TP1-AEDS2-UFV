You got a fast car  
I want a ticket to anywhere  
Maybe we make a deal  
Maybe together we can get somewhere  
Anyplace is better  
Starting from zero got nothing to lose  
Maybe well make something  
Me myself I got nothing to prove  
  
You got a fast car  
I got a plan to get us out of here  
I been working at the convenience store  
Managed to save just a little bit of money  
Wont have to drive too far  
Just cross the border and into the city  
You and I can both get jobs  
And finally see what it means to be living  
  
You see my old mans got a problem  
He live with the bottle thats the way it is  
He says his bodys too old for working  
His bodys too young to look like his  
My mama went off and left him  
She wanted more from life than he could give  
I said somebodys got to take care of him  
So I quit school and thats what I did  
  
You got a fast car  
Is it fast enough so we can fly away  
We gotta make a decision  
Leave tonight or live and die this way  
  
So remember we were driving driving in your car  
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder  
I had a feeling that I belonged  
I had a feeling I could be someone be someone be someone  
  
You got a fast car  
We go cruising to entertain ourselves  
You still aint got a job  
I work in a market as a checkout girl  
I know things will get better  
Youll find work and Ill get promoted  
Well move out of the shelter  
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs  
  
I remember we were driving driving in your car  
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder  
I had a feeling that I belonged  
I had a feeling I could be someone be someone be someone  
  
You got a fast car  
I got a job that pays all our bills  
You stay out drinking late at the bar  
See more of your friends than you do of your kids  
Id always hoped for better  
Thought maybe together you and me would find it  
I got no plans I aint going nowhere  
So take your fast car and keep on driving  
  
I remember we were driving driving in your car  
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder  
I had a feeling that I belonged  
I had a feeling I could be someone be someone be someone  
  
You got a fast car  
But is it fast enough so you can fly away  
You gotta make a decision  
Leave tonight or live and die this way
