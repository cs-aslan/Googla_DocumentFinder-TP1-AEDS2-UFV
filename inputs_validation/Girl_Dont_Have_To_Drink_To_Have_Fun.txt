I know what youre doing and Ill save you the trouble  
I saw you wink for the waiter to slip me a double  
If you want some barroom swinger Im not the one  
Cause I dont think a girls gotta drink to have fun  
Mama said when I went out in the world drinking aint the thing for a sweet
young girl  
I didnt listen then but now Im here to shout  
That my dear old mama knew what she was talkin about  
So if you want another round just order one  
Cause I dont think a girls gotta drink to have fun  
  
Dont bother bringing a bottle when you call  
Cause I like my kisses straight or not at all  
I want to be sure I remember everyone  
And I dont think a girls gotta drink to have fun  
Mama said when I went out  
No I dont think a girls gotta drink to have fun
