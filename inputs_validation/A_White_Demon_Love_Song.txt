White demon love song down the hall  
White demon shadow on the road  
Back up your mind there is a call  
He isnt coming after all  
Love this time  
She likes the way he sings  
White demon love songs in her dreams  
  
White demon wheres your selfish kiss  
White demon sorrow will arrange  
Lets not forget about the fear  
Black invitation to this place that cannot change  
While strangely holy come for a rain  
  
Darling  
  
White demon widen your hearts scope  
White demon who let your friends go  
White demon widen your hearts scope  
White demon who let your friends go  
  
Let us be in love  
Let us be in love  
Lets do old and grey  
Lets do old and grey  
I wont make you cry  
I wont make you cry  
I will never stray  
I will never stray  
I will do my part  
I will do my part  
Let us be in love tonight  
  
White demon widen your hearts scope  
White demon who let your friends go  
White demon widen your hearts scope  
White demon who let your friends go  
  
Stand it anymore darling  
Stand it  
  
I cant stand it anymore darling  
Stand it
