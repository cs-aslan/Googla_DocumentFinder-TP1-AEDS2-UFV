True love is gone Is been played for a fool  
True love is gone Is been played for a fool  
Im turnin the tables on you  
Youve been playin dirty pool  
  
You said youd call the shots darlin  
All your friends thought that was cool so cool baby  
You said youd call the shots darlin  
All your friends thought that was so cool  
  
Yeah when you shot at the eightball baby  
I knew you were playin dirty pool  
  
They say that life life is a game of give and take  
They say that life life is a game of give and take  
Im tellin you one thing right now little baby  
I wont be the one to pay for your mistake
