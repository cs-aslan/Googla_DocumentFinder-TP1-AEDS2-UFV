Ooh ah ooh  
The emale left so clearly upon a computer screen  
Read like a threat that crept into her like a sex machine  
Wanted Any woman whos first name begins with a Z  
From the sound of the keys a pawn makes a move  
Her reply brings on the groove  
  
Wwwemalecom  
The king takes the pawn  
Wwwemalecom  
Its on its on its on  
  
He couldnt wait 2 tell her till after he got the nella  
Her love would only even the score  
It seemed her darling fella  
He stole a hell of a lot of bucks from the corner store  
The declaration of war that followed  
She never believed oh  
  
In the darkest corners where widows mourn  
Thats where he whispered her name  
He said We can do it here my dear  
But I fear your tears will fall like rain  
They fall like  
  
Because I must tell you Tell U  
While Im deep in your smell  
You got the man I want to inflict with pain  
Im running a game with my paper  
Im turning the boy to vapor  
Now I want to do the same to you  
If you dont tattoo my name upon your train  
  
Wwwemalecom Oh the king takes the pawn  
The king takes the pawn Oh
