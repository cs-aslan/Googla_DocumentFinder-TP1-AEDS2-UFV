California dancin in the ocean  
How I love you  
Better wear some lotion  
Sun is always shinin  
No one compares to you  
  
Sittin here baby  
Young and like a flower  
How I want you  
Gimme just an hour  
You seem like an angel  
No one compares to you  
  
Youre the best book I ever read  
Youre the smartest thing I ever said  
Youre breakfast in bed  
  
When in no way  
You can do me more ways  
Than any other  
You treat me like you love me  
Like a mother loves her baby  
Baby do I do it for you  
Oh cause all I ever wanted baby  
Baby was to do it for you  
  
Youre the best dream in my head  
Youre my calm thought when I see red  
Youre better than punk rock red  
Youre breakfast in bed  
Youre breakfast in bed  
Youre breakfast in bed  
  
Wanna please you  
Wanna Japanese you  
How I need you  
Dress you up and feed you  
Love you like a daddy loves his baby  
Baby do it for me  
  
Youre the fastest race I ever led  
Youre the finest bride Ill ever wed  
Youre the skin I never wanna shed  
Youre breakfast in bed  
Youre breakfast in bed  
Youre breakfast in bed
