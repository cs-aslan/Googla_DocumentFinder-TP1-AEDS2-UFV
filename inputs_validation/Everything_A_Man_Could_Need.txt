Looking back on the days  
When I was scuffling for a buck  
Not overly concerned with life and love  
I was always feeling sorry  
For myself and my bad luck  
I never stopped to think what lifes made of  
  
With my nose to the grindstone  
And my collar to the wheel  
I fought for my daily dollar like a man  
Then you came into my life  
And nothing else seemed real  
I found the answer right here in my hands  
  
Now Ive got everything a man could ever need  
Ive got dreams to dream and songs to sing  
In the morning  
Ive got hands to hold my babychild  
And eyes to watch my woman smile  
Ive got everything a man could ever need  
  
Now my working days seem shorter  
Than they ever did before  
And the evening breeze gets cooler day by day  
And the morning sun is always shining  
Down on my backdoor  
And your laughter washes all my tears away  
  
And theres not a day goes by  
When I dont look up to the sky  
And humbly thank the good Lord up above  
For bringing you to me in time  
To make me realize  
That all a poor man really needs is love  
  
Now Ive got everything a man could ever need  
Ive got dreams to dream and songs to sing  
In the morning  
Ive got hands to hold my babychild  
And eyes to watch my woman smile  
Ive got everything a man could ever need  
Ive got everything a man could ever need
