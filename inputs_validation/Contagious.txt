I wanna tell you what its about  
And Im all right now all right now  
Cause its You Ive found  
Yeah Your loves contagious and Ive caught it  
Cant wipe this smile off my face its something I cant explain  
Yeah Your joys outrageous and I got it  
Im leaving worries behind its something I cant describe  
Singin na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na  
Singin na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na  
I got a new motivation  
I never knew how good it could be  
Its better than a standing ovation  
And nothings gonna take it from me  
And Ill be fine Ill be fine  
Cause Youre by my side  
Yeah Your loves contagious and Ive caught it  
Cant wipe this smile off my face its something I cant explain

You can put it in your pocket for another day  
You can hide it in a box or keep it locked away  
But when its in your heart youll find  
You dont have to wonder why  
You wont need a vision  
You wont need a sign  
Its something I cant define
