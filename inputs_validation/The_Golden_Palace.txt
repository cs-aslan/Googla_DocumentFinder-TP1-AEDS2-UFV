Locked behind the door  
Taken by force  
But Im not guilty of the crime  
How can this be real  
What is aganst the law  
To say whats on your mind  
Then I see your face  
So warm as it comforts me  
And tells me I am not alone  
Pray for me tonight  
Give me the strength of love  
To help me cross the virgin snow  
I will run till daybreak  
My tears will fade away  
Theyll never take me again  
No Im never going back  
cause when I get to the golden palace  
Everything will surely be so clear  
Can we give ourselves  
Like a mother to her child  
They took a part of me  
Whenever I think of it  
I shiver to the bone  
The scar is on my heart  
When will the crimes of  
Inhumanity be known  
I am only one voice  
I will not fade away  
So many are silent  
But I will never look back  
cause when I get to the golden palace  
Everything will surely disappear  
The snow has gone at last  
Im out of the shadows and into the sun  
And then I see you smile  
Angel of mercy  
The fight has jus begun  
I can hear them calling  
Across the frozen land  
The world will hear us  
You know its never too late  
cause when we get  
To the golden palace  
The memory will surely be so clear
