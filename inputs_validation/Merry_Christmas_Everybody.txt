Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall  
Its the time that every Santa has a ball  
Does he ride a rednosed reindeer  
Does a tonup on his sleigh  
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day  
  
So here it is Merry Christmas  
Everybodys having fun  
Look to the future now  
Its only just begun  
  
Are you waiting for the family to arrive  
Are you sure youve got the room to spare inside  
Does your granny always tell ya  
That the old songs are the best  
Then shes up and rock n rolling with the rest  
  
So here it is Merry Christmas  
Everybodys having fun  
Look to the future now  
Its only just begun  
  
What will your daddy do  
When he sees your mommy  
Kissing Santa Claus  
Aaah ah aaah aahh  
  
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall  
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall  
Do you ride around the hillside  
In a buggy you have made  
When you land upon your head  
And youve been sleighed  
  
So here it is Merry Christmas  
Everybodys having fun  
Look to the future now  
Its only just begun  
So here it is Merry Christmas  
Everybodys having fun  
Look to the future now  
Its only just begun  
  
So here it is Merry Christmas  
Everybodys having fun  
Look to the future now  
Its only just begun  
So here it is Merry Christmas  
Everybodys having fun  
Its Christmas  
Look to the future now  
Its only just begun
