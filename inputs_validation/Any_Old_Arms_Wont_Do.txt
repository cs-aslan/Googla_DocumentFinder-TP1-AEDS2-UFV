Id like to rush into somebodys arms  
And lose myself inside  
But just any arms wont do  
They must belong to you  
Id like to know the soothing comfort  
Of a love that never dies  
But just any old love wont do  
That love must come from you  
Ive tried so hard to find someone to love  
Since I lost you  
But they only make me realize  
How much that I need you  
Id like to know when I grow older  
Someones heart will still be true  
But just any old heart wont do  
It must belong to you
