Days can be sunny with never a sigh  
Dont need what money can buy  
Birds in the trees sing their dayful of songs  
Why shouldnt we sing along  
Im chipper all the day  
Happy with my life  
How do I get that way  
Look at what Ive got  
  
I got rhythm I got music I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more  
Ive got daisies in green pastures  
Ive got my man  
Who could ask for anything more  
  
Old man trouble I dont mind him  
You wont find him round my door  
Ive got starlight  
Ive got sweet dreams  
Ive got my man  
Who could ask for anything more  
  
Old man trouble I dont mind him  
You wont find him round my door  
Ive got starlight  
Ive got sweet dreams  
Ive got my man  
Who could ask for anything more  
  
Oh Ive got rhythm  
Ive got music  
Ive got daisies in green pastures  
Ive got starlight  
Ive got sweet dreams  
Ive got my man  
Who could ask for anything more  
  
Ive got rhythm Ive got rhythm
