Youre with me  
Till the bitter end  
What we had transcends  
This experience  
Too painful to  
Talk about  
So Ill hold it in  
Til my heart can mend  
And be brave  
Enough to love again  
A place in time  
Still belongs to us  
Stays preserved  
In my mind  
In the memories  
There is solace  
  
Never too far away  
I wont let time erase  
One bit of yesterday  
Cause I have learned that  
Nobody can take your place  
Though we can never be  
Ill keep you close to me  
When I remember  
  
Glittering lights  
Incandescent eyes  
Still preserved  
In my mind  
In the memories  
Ill find solace  
  
Never too far away  
I wont let time erase  
One bit of yesterday  
And I have learned that  
Nobody can take your place  
Though we can never be  
Ill keep you close to me  
And Ill remember  
  
A place in time  
Still belongs to us  
Stays preserved  
In my mind  
In the memories  
There is solace  
  
Never too far away  
I wont let time erase  
One bit of yesterday  
Cause I have learned that  
Nobody can take your place  
And though we can never be  
Ill always think of  
You and me  
Always remember  
  
Love  
  
Youre never too far
