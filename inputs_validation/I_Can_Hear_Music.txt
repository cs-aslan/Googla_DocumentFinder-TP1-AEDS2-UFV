This is the way I always dreamed it would be  
The way that it is oohwhen you are holding me  
I never had a love of my own  
Maybe thats why when were all alone  
I can hear music  
I can hear music  
  
Sounds of the city baby seem to disappear  
Oh well I can hear music  
Sweet sweet music  
Whenever you touch me baby  
Whenever youre near  
  
Loving you it keeps me satisfied  
And I cant explainoh nothe way Im feeling inside  
You look at me we kiss and then  
I close my eyes and here it comes again  
I can hear music  
I can hear music  
  
Sounds of the city baby seem to disappear  
Oh well I can hear music  
Sweet sweet music  
Whenever you touch me baby  
Whenever youre near  
I can hear music  
Sweet sweet music  
  
Whenever you touch me baby  
Whenever youre near  
I can hear music  
Sweet sweet music  
Whenever you touch me baby  
Whenever youre near
