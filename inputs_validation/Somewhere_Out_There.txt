Somewhere out there  
Beneath the pale moon night  
Someones thinking of me  
And loving me tonight  
Somewhere out there  
Someones saying a prayer  
That well find one another  
In that big somewhere out there  
And even though I know how very far apart we are  
It helps to think we might be wishing  
On the same bright star  
And when the night wind starts to sing  
A lonesome lullaby  
It helps to think were sleeping underneath the  
Same big sky  
Somewhere out there  
If love can see us through  
Then well be together  
Somewhere out there out where dreams come true  
And even though I know how very far apart we are  
It helps to think we might be wishing  
On the same bright star  
And when the night wind starts to sing  
A lonesome lullaby  
It helps to think were sleeping underneath the  
Same big sky  
Somewhere out there  
If love can see us through can see us through  
Then well be together  
Somewhere out there out where dreams come true
