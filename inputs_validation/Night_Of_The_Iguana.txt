The tour bus came yesterday  
The drivers a mess today  
Its a dump of a destiny  
But its got a view  
Now the kid in the seethrough blouse  
Is moving in hard on his holy vows  
Since the preachers not dead  
Dead drunk will have to do  
  
Night of the iguana  
The jasmine is so mercilessly sweet  
Night of the iguana  
Can you hear the castanets  
The widow is dancing  
Down on the beach  
  
The starlight is steaming  
Hed like to be dreaming  
His senses are screaming  
Not to be denied  
But if the spell of the night should win  
He could lose his bus  
For the same sweet sin  
That took his church from him  
Then how will he survive  
  
Night of the iguana  
The jasmine is so mercilessly sweet  
Night of the iguana  
Can you hear the castanets  
Its the widow and her loverboys  
Down on the beach  
  
The night is so fragrant  
These women so flagrant  
They could make him a vagrant  
With the flick of a shawl  
The devils in sweet sixteen  
The widows good looking but she gets mean  
Hes burning like Augustine  
With no help from God at all
