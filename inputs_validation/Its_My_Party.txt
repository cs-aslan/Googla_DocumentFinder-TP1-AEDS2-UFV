Its my party and Ill cry if I want to  
Cry if I want to  
Cry if I want to  
You would cry too if its happened to you  
Nobody knows where my johnny has gone  
But Judy left the same time  
Why was he holding her hand  
When hes supposed to be mine  
  
Play all my records keep dancing all night  
But leave me alone for a while  
Till johnnys dancing with me  
Ive got no reason to smile  
  
Judy and johnny just walked through that door  
Like a queen with her king  
Oh what a birthday surprise  
Judys wearing his ring
