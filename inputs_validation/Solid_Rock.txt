Well take a look at that  
I made a castle in the sand  
Saying this is where its at you know  
Couldnt understand now  
If I realised that the chances were slim  
How come Im so surprised when the tide rolled in  
  
I want to live on solid rock  
Im gonna live on solid rock  
I want to give I dont want to be blocked  
Im gonna live on solid rock  
Well Im sick of potential  
  
Im sick of vanity now  
Im sticking to essential reality now  
I dont know whats worse  
Try to make a silk purse  
Living an illusion living in confusion  
Well a house of cards  
Was never built for shock  
  
You could blow it down in any kind of weather  
Now two solid rocks two solid blocks  
You know theyre gonna stick  
Yeah theyre gonna stick together  
Because the heart that you break  
Thats the one that you rely on  
The bed that you make  
Thats the one you gotta lie on  
  
When you point your finger cause your plan fell through  
You got three more fingers pointing back at you  
I want to live on solid rock  
Im gonna live on solid rock  
I want to give I dont want to be blocked  
Im gonna live on solid rock
