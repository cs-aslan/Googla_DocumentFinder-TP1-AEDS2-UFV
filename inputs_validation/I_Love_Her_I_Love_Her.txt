I love her I love her  
I love her Im in love with her  
Theres no other problem  
As big as the one living without her  
Ah Mama well make it  
With her I can take it I love her  
  
Im so happy when Im about her  
And so lonely without her  
I love her I love her  
I love her oh I love her  
  
His mother tried to tell him  
That kinda wedlock could bring strife  
So many are against it  
I offer you peace and joy and life  
Why risk all the problems  
That may come with her being your wife  
Ah He looked up with tears in his eyes  
Saying Mother dont you realize  
I love her I love her  
I love her I love her I love her  
  
Father advised her  
That so many wouldnt understand  
Theyd more or less resent you  
If they even saw you holding his hand  
Why choose the problems that may face you now  
In this man  
  
She looked up with tears in her eyes  
Said Father do you realize  
That I love him I love him  
I love him I love him I love him  
Thats why I love her  
I love her I love her I love her  
  
Theres no other problem  
As big as the one living without her  
Mama well make it  
With her I can take it I love her  
Im so happy when Im about her  
I love her I love her  
I love her I love her I love her
