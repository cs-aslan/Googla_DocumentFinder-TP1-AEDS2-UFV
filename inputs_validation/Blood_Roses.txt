Blood roses  
Blood roses  
Back on the street now  
Cant forget the things you never said  
On days like these gets me thinking  
When chickens get a taste of your meat  
Chickens get a taste of your meat  
  
You gave him your blood  
And your warm little diamond  
He likes killing you after your dead  
You think Im a queer  
I think youre a queer  
I think youre a queer  
Said I think youre a queer  
And I shaved every place where you been  
I shaved every place where you been  
  
God knows Ive thrown away those graces  
  
The belle of new orleans tried to show me  
Once how to tango  
Wrapped around your feet wrapped around like good little roses  
  
Blood roses  
Blood roses  
Back on the street now  
Now youve cut out the flute  
From the throat of the loon  
At least when you cry now  
He cant even hear you  
When chickens get a taste of your meat  
When he sucks you deep  
Sometimes youre nothing but meat
