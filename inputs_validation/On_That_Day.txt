Some people say  
Its what we deserve  
For sins against gd  
For crimes in the world  
I wouldnt know  
Im just holding the fort  
Since that day  
They wounded New York  
Some people say  
They hate us of old  
Our women unveiled  
Our slaves and our gold  
I wouldnt know  
Im just holding the fort  
But answer me this  
I wont take you to court  
Did you go crazy  
Or did you report  
On that day  
On that day  
They wounded New York
