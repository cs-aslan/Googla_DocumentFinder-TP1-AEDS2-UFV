Youre standin there a sayin Im no good  
And Im so ashamed Id die if I could  
But youre no better than I am or have you given this one thought  
The only thing thats different I got caught  
All the nights you left me all alone  
And the only arms close to me was my own  
And now youre blame on me but its not all my fault  
The only thing thats different I got caught  
Yeah I got caught but honey youre a pro  
Theres not a thing about cheatin you dont know  
That same old line you sell is the same old line I bought  
The thing youve got away with I got caught  
 guitar  steel   
Yeah I got caught but honey youre a pro  
Yeah the thing youve got away with I got caught
