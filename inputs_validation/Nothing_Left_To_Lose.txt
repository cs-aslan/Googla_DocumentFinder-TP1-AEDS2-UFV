Nothings good the news is bad  
The heat goes on and it drives you mad  
Scornful thoughts that fly your way  
  
You should turn away cause theres nothing more to say  
You gave the best you had to give  
You only had one life to live  
You fought so hard you were a slave  
  
After all you gave there was nothing left to save  
Youve got nothing left to lose youve got nothing left to lose  
No youve got nothing left to lose whod want to be standing in your shoes  
Nothing ventured nothing gained  
  
No more lingering doubt remained  
Nothing sacred or profane  
Everything to gain  
Cause youve nothing left
