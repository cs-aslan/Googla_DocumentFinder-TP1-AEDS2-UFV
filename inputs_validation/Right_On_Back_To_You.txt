The rains coming down hard tonight  
Pull the car over  
Now Im sittin alone on the roadside  
I tilt the mirror down and say to me  
Why you always think the answers gotta be  
To just leave  
Im making the same mistake  
Im hoping its not too late  
Because I  
  
Chorus  
I dont know where Id be without you now  
I guess I get scared  
And thats why I act like such a fool  
Cause youre the one thing I cant lose  
I feel the tears coming  
And I wanna cry  
I think of us baby  
And all the love inside comes shining through  
And it always leads me right on back to you  
  
I never felt it  
I never knew  
Someone who could get inside my soul the way you do  
Yes you do  
  
Yeah you got me in the palm of your hand  
Its beautiful and terrifying  
Cant you see  
For someone like me  
But instead of running in  
I know  
Its when I should hold you closer  
Because I  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont know where Id be without you now  
  
I guess I get scared and thats why I lie  
Such a fool  
Cause youre the one thing I cant lose  
I feel the tears coming  
And I wanna cry  
I think of us baby  
And all the love inside comes shining through  
And it always leads me right on back to you  
  
Cause nobodys ever loved me  
Like you  
And I was born to be your man forever  
  
Forever baby  
Yeah  
I feel the tears coming  
And I wanna cry  
I turn the car around  
And put it in drive  
And I know what to do  
Gonna come on back  
Come on back to you  
Yeah  
  
Oh oh baby  
Gonna come on back  
Come on back to you  
Oh oh baby  
Gonna come on back  
Come on back to you  
Cause I cant live without you  
I cant breathe without you  
Yeah  
And Im nothin Im nothin  
Without you  
Yeah  
I was a fool I was a fool baby
