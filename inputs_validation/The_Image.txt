Hope you dont believe a word  
Of all the things I know youve heard about me  
Really just a pack of lies  
You see the truth before your eyes around me  
Hard to keep it straight  
The real from the ruse  
Probably way too late  
What can I do but its  
  
Chorus  
Not what you think  
Not what you hear  
Not what you see  
Its just the image  
Its all on a string  
All fantasy  
Not really me  
Its just the image  
  
Would it be too much to ask  
That you could just give me the chance to prove it  
Or would it only be a waste of time  
To try to make you change your mind and use it  
What Ive been looking for  
Isnt what I thought  
Not behind the golden door  
Youre all Ive got and its  
  
Chorus  
  
Would it be too much to ask  
That you could just give me the chance to prove it  
Or would it only be a waste of time  
To try to make you change your mind and use it  
What Ive been looking for  
Isnt what I thought  
Not behind the golden door  
Youre all Ive got and its  
  
Chorus
