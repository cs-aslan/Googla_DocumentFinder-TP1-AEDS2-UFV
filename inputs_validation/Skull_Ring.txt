Skull rings  
Fast cars

Fancy things  
  
The touch of a hand in the wasteland  
Youre walking asleep and dreaming cheap  
A birds wing dont beat for free  
Youre freezing cold and your family

Fingers on fire to do whats bad  
Ring on the finger is a skull man  
Strong as a bar of steel  
Weakness is that you cant feel
