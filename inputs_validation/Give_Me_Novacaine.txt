Take away the sensation inside  
Bitter sweet migraine in my head  
Its like a throbbing tooth ache of the mind  
I cant take this feeling anymore  
  
Drain the pressure from the swelling  
The sensations overwhelming  
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright  
Tell me that I wont feel a thing  
So give me Novacaine  
  
Out of body and out of mind  
Kiss the demons out of my dreams  
I get the funny feeling thats alright  
Jimmy says its better than here  
Ill tell you why  
  
Drain the pressure from the swelling  
The sensations overwhelming  
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright  
Tell me that I wont feel a thing  
So give me Novacaine  
  
Oh Novacaine  
  
Drain the pressure from the swelling  
The sensations overwhelming  
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright  
Tell me Jimmy I wont feel a thing  
So give me Novacaine
