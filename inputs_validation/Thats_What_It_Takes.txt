And now it begins to shine  
And you found the eyes to see  
Each little drop at dawn of every day  
  
Your smile it comes back to me  
And whatever you may say  
Dont let it stop never fade away  
  
As we got to get out in this world together oh  
Doesnt really matter if we start to make some changes oh  
  
If thats what it takes thats what it takes  
Then Ive got to be strong thats what it takes  
Dont want to be wrong  
If thats what it takes  
  
The closer I get thats what it takes  
Into that open door what it takes  
Ive got to be sure  
If thats what it takes  
  
And now that its shining through  
And you can see all this world  
Dont let it stop never fade away  
  
If we got to be in this life forever ohoh  
Then wed better be taking all the chances oh oh  
  
If thats what it takes thats what it takes  
Then Ive got to be strong thats what it takes  
Dont want to be wrong  
If thats what it takes  
  
The closer I get thats what it takes  
Into that open doorwhat it takes  
Ive got to be sure  
If thats what it takes  
  
Thats what it takes thats what it takes  
Thats what it takes thats what it takes  
Thats what it takes thats what it takes  
Thats what it takes thats what it takes  
Thats what it takes oh thats what it takes  
  
Oh thats what it takes
