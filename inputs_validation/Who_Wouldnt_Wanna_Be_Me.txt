I got no money in my pockets  
I got a hole in my jeans  
I had a job and I lost it  
But it wont get to me  
  
Cause Im ridin with my baby  
And its a brand new day  
Were on the wheels of an angel  
Flyin away  
  
Chorus  
And the sun is shinin  
This road keeps windin  
Through the prettiest country  
From Georgia to Tennessee  
And I got the one I love beside me  
My troubles behind me  
Im alive and Im free  
Who wouldnt want to be me  
  
Now shes strummin on my sixstring  
Across her pretty knees  
Shes stompin out a rhythm  
And singin to me the sweetest song  
  
The sun is shinin  
This road keeps windin  
Through the prettiest country  
From Georgia to Tennessee  
And I got the one I love beside me  
My troubles behind me  
Im alive and Im free  
Who wouldnt want to be me  
  
Oh the sun is shinin  
And this road keeps windin  
Through the prettiest country  
From Georgia to Tennessee  
I got the one I love beside me  
My troubles behind me  
Im alive and Im free  
Who wouldnt want to be me  
  
I got no money in my pockets  
I got a hole in my jeans  
Were on the wheels of an angel  
And Im free  
Shes strummin on my sixstring  
Its across her pretty knees  
Shes stompin out a rhythm  
And singin to me
