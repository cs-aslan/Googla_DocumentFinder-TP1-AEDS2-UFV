Your smiling cannot fool me no more  
Your sweet talking cannot fool me no more  
Cause I know about your cheating  
Cause I know about you back biting  
And I dont know what you know  
And I have never been where youve been  
And I certainly dont believe in what you believe in  
And I dont do what you do  
Im a living witness now I know that  
Not every black man is my brother  
Not every white man is my enemy  
Ive got no place in your world  
And Ive never been where youve been  
And I dont know what you know  
And I have never been where youve been  
And I certainly dont believe in what you believe in  
And I dont do what you do  
Im a living witness now I know that  
Not every black man is my brother  
Not every white man is my enemy  
Ive got no place in your world  
And Ive never been where youve been  
Not every black man is my brother  
Not every white man is my enemy  
Ive got no place in your world  
And Ive never been where youve been  
Not every black man is my brother  
Not every white man is my enemy  
Ive got no place in your world  
And Ive never been where youve been
