Youre always pretending to be  
Someone who prefers to be free  
You think you can fool me with your lyin eyes  
But what is this game that you play  
When all that your trying to say  
Is that your lonely in need of a friend  
  
Oh yeah sorrow woman I just cant seem to get to you  
Oh yeah sorrow woman if only you could see you as I do  
  
And cant you see that its true  
Theres someone as lonely as you  
Trying so hard so hard to get through  
And why cant everyone see the way that it really should be  
Why hide your feelings and suffer the pain  
  
Oh yeah sorrow woman I just cant seem to get to you  
Oh yeah sorrow woman if only you could see you as I do  
  
You know that sorrow is a woman  
You know shell make you feel sad  
You know that sorrow is a woman  
  
Oh yeah sorrow woman I just cant seem to get to you  
Oh yeah sorrow woman if only you could see you as I do
