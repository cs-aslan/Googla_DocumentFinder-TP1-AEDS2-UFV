You say you stand by your man  
Tell me something I dont understand  
You said you loved me and thats a fact  
But then you left me said you felt trapped  
Well some things you cant explain away  
But the heartaches in me till this day  
You didnt stand by me  
No not at all  
You didnt stand by me  
No way  
  
All the times when we were close  
I remember these things the most  
I see all my dreams come tumbling down  
I cant be happy without you around  
So alone I keep the wolves at bay  
And theres only one thing I can say  
You didnt stand by me  
No not at all  
You didnt stand by me  
No way  
  
You must explain why this must be  
Did you lie when you spoke to me  
You didnt stand by me  
No not at all  
  
Now I got a job and it dont pay  
I need new clothes I need somewhere to stay  
But without all of these things I can do  
But without your love I wont make it through  
But you dont understand my point of view  
I suppose theres nothing I can do  
You didnt stand by me  
No not at all  
You didnt stand by me  
No way  
You didnt stand by me  
No not at all  
You didnt stand by me  
No way  
  
You must explain why this must be  
Did you lie when you spoke to me  
You didnt stand by me  
No not at all  
  
You didnt stand by me  
No not at all  
You didnt stand by me  
No way
