Fun is in its no sin its that time again  
To shed your load hit the road on the run again  
Summer skies in our eyes and a warmer sun  
Its one for all all for one all for all out fun  
  
Gotta go to it  
Gonna go through it  
Gotta get with it  
  
Lookin good  
Down the hood Of a funky ride  
On the way  
To the tide  
Just to tan your hide  
In the shade  
Lemonade  
In the sun ocean spray  
To get your face  
In the race  
Or lay backs no disgrace  
  
Gotta go to it  
Gonna go through it  
Gotta get with it  
  
Its OK to get out there and  
Have some fun  
By yourself maybe  
Or else with a special one  
Good or bad  
Glad or sad  
Its all gonna pass  
So its OK  
Lets all play  
And enjoy it while it lasts  
  
Gotta go to it  
Gonna go through it  
Gotta get with it
