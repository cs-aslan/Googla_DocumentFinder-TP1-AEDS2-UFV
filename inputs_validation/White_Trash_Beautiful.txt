White trash beautiful trailer park queen  
She slings hash at the diner from eleven to five  
She married a boy from school thought he was oh so cool  
But all he can do for money is drive  
Out late hauling freight on interstate five  
Prayin hell see home before his baby arrive  
  
White trash beautiful theres something you should know  
My heart belongs to you  
And you could have found a better guy  
Ill love you till the day I die I swear to God its true  
Im coming home to you  
Im coming home to you girl  
  
He lights a cigarette his eyes half open  
He wont be home tonight but she keeps hopin  
Drinkin himself to sleep is his only way of copin  
She waits for him every night she leaves the front door open  
Its four am and doin 95  
Tryin to stay awake and make it home alive  
  
White trash beautiful theres something you should know  
My heart belongs to you  
I know you could have found a better guy  
Ill love you till the day I die I swear to God its true  
Im coming home to you  
Im coming home to you girl  
  
Her lips stay painted red her name tags crooked  
Her hearts been gone a while with the truck driving man that took it  
He keeps her photograph on his rearview mirror  
She prays for him every night she hopes that he can hear her  
  
White trash beautiful theres something you should know  
My heart belongs to you  
I know you could have found a better guy  
Ill love you till the day I die I swear to God its true  
Im coming home to you  
Im coming home to you girl  
Im coming home to you  
Im coming home to you girl  
Im coming home to you
