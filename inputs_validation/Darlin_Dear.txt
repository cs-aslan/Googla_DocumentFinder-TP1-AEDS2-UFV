Since we talked  
Half the night  
Feelin good  
Feelin right  
  
Words were spoke  
Brought us close  
When we touched it was overdose  
On the road  
  
Youre back there  
Youre my friend Darlin Dear  
Open up  
Let me in  
  
Im your paladin  
When your smile  
Shines on me  
I am the seducee  
  
We will fly everywhere  
Youre my friend Darlin Dear  
Party plans  
Get the phone  
  
Did you read Rolling Stone  
Knowing you knocks me out  
I am your roustabout  
Pretty good atmosphere  
  
Youre my friend Darlin Dear  
Oh baby  
Oh baby
