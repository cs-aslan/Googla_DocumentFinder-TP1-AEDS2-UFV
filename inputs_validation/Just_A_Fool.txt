Another shot of whiskey please bartender  
Keep it coming til I dont remember at all  
How bad it hurts when youre gone na na na  
  
Turn the music up a little bit louder  
Just gotta get past the midnight hour  
Maybe tomorrow it wont  
Be this hard

I had my heart set on you  
But nothing else hurts like you do  
Who knew that love was so cruel

And I  
Waited and waited so long  
For someone whod never come home  
Its my fault to think youll be true yeah yeah
