I know way too many people here right now  
That I didnt know last year who the fuck are yall  
I swear it feels like the last few nights  
We been everywhere and back  
But I just cant remember it all

Oh yeah thats right Im doin me

And this what Im a do til its over  
Til its over  
But its far from over  
  
Bottles on me long as someone drink it  
Never drop the ball fuck are yall thinkin  
Makin sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin  
Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett  
I shouldntve drove tell me how Im gettin home  
You too fine to be layin down in bed alone  
I could teach you how to speak my language Rosetta Stone  
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing Ive ever known  
Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas  
All I needs a fucking red jacket with some zippers  
Super good smiddoke a package of the swishers  
I did it overnight it couldnt happen any quicker  
Yall know them Well fuck it me either  
But point the biggest skeptic out Ill make him a believer  
It wouldnt be the first time I done it throwin hundreds  
When I should be throwin ones bitch I run it Ah

And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane  
So they tell me that they love me I know better than that its just game  
Its just what comes with the fame and Im ready for that Im just sayin  
But I really cant complain everything is kosher  
Two thumbs up Ebert and Roeper  
I really cant see the end getting any closer  
But I probly still be the man when everything is over  
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on  
Can you see me Can you see me Get your Visine on  
Yall just do not fit the picture turn your widescreen on  
If you thinkin Im a quit before I die dream on  
Man they treat me like a legend am I really this cold  
Im really too young to be feelin this old  
Its about time you admit it who you kiddin man  
Man nobodys never done it like I did it Ugh
