Easy time wont keep you waitin any longer  
Than you waited in the past  
Cool and breezy winds are blowin sweetly  
On the edges of the garden at last  
  
Tell me what you want and ill give you what you need  
Tell me what you want and ill give you what you need  
Tell me what you want and ill give you what you need  
Look into my eyes and youll see me standin there  
  
Feelin happiness inside you now  
You always knew it was a state of mind  
Youre just reelin takin in the thoughts around you  
Every ones got secrets you must find  
  
Tell me what you want and ill give you what you need  
Tell me what you want and ill give you what you need  
Tell me what you want and ill give you what you need  
Look into my eyes and youll see me standin there  
  
Oo its so easy  
Cool and breezy  
What a feelin  
Its got me reelin  
  
Tell me what you want and ill give you what you need  
Tell me what you want and ill give you what you need  
Tell me what you want and ill give you what you need  
Look into my eyes and youll see me standin there
