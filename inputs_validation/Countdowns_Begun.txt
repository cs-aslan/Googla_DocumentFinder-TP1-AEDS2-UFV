Watching blood stain windows  
He must just love the blame  
See the children crying  
His mothers died again  
  
Dig her grave much deeper  
The fatal price you pay  
I hope Im there to hold her  
When she comes back again  
I see the death and the disaster  
There is no happy ever after  
The time has come  
Countdowns begun  
Countdowns begun  
  
Is the Armageddon  
Finally here at last  
You may see the mushroom  
But you wont hear the blast  
Dont need a self made prophet  
Dont need a holy war  
Dont need another Dday  
To even up the score  
  
Im cursed with living on a goldmine  
The doomsday clock was built by mankind  
No place to run  
Countdowns begun  
Countdowns begun  
Countdowns begun  
  
I see the death and the disaster  
There is no happy ever after  
The time has come  
Countdowns begun  
Countdowns begun  
Countdowns begun  
Countdowns begun  
Countdowns begun  
Countdowns begun
