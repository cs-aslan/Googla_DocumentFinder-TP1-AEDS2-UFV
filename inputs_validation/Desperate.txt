Send me away  
Im here on my own  
Hammer stutter now  
Lets rock lets roll now  
  
She says Im obsessed  
I say Im in love  
Oh Me  
Youve done it now  
Now send me a way out  
I feel insecure  
And Desperate  
But not right now  
I feel it now  
And you dont see  
The way I see  
Ive got it now  
Im desperate  
  
Desperate  
Desperate  
  
Im better off like this  
Im better off  
Im better off like this  
  
Dont you know I care  
No no  
  
Desperate  
Desperate  
Desperate  
Desperate  
  
Im better off like this  
Im better off  
Im better off like this  
Dont you know I care  
No no  
  
I wish I was myself  
Again  
I wish I was myself  
Again
