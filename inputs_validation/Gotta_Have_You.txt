Never been too much for watching  
Cause theres too many things to view  
And when eyes begin to wander  
They more than likely never get through  
But beyond my own temptation  
Im enticed by what I see  
And I wont feel satisfaction  
Until shes where I want her to be  
  
I gotta have you I gotta have you  
I gotta have you for me  
You are a sight for sore eyes to see  
I gotta make you my reality  
I gotta have you I gotta have you  
I gotta have you for me  
You are a sight for sore eyes to see  
Come on girl make you my reality  
  
Never been too much for talking  
Cause theres too many things to say  
And by the time that I start speaking  
The right moment has slipped away  
But I must break this old tradition  
And try to muster up the words  
And though someone else may have said them  
Ill say them in way youve never heard  
  
I gotta have you I gotta have you  
I gotta have you for me  
You are a sight for sore eyes to see  
Ive gotta make you my reality  
I gotta have you I gotta have you  
I gotta have you for me  
You are a sight for sore eyes to see  
Come on girl make you my reality  
Gotta be gotta be gotta be reality baby  
Gotta be gotta be gotta be reality baby  
Repeat  
  
Never been too much for touching  
Cause theres too many things to feel  
Plus theres too much disappointment  
When you find out those feelings aint real  
But heres a time when inner senses  
Are gonna have to shine the light  
Cause I have overly committed  
Myself in thinking that youre alright  
  
I gotta have you I gotta have you  
I gotta have you for me  
You are a sight for sore eyes to see  
I gotta make you my reality  
I gotta have you I gotta have you  
I gotta have you for me  
You are a sight for sore eyes to see  
Come on girl make you my reality  
Gotta be gotta be gotta be reality baby  
Gotta be gotta be gotta be reality baby  
Repeat
