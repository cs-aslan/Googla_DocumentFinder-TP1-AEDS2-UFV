Called you yesterday  
You didnt answer your phone  
The main drag is knowing that  
You probably werent alone  
  
So here I sit in my lonely room  
Lookin for my sunshine  
But all Ive got is two cigarettes  
And this broken heart of mine  
  
So let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down down  
  
Youve been gone seventeen days  
Seventeen long nights  
The main drag is knowing that  
Youre holding someone else tight  
  
I want to to call you everyday  
And beg you to be near me  
But I know your head is underwater  
I doubt that you could hear me  
  
So let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down down  
  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  
Seventeen days  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  
Seventeen days  
  
Called you yesterday  
You didnt answer your phone  
If youre the one whos always lonely  
Then Im the one whos always alone  
  
So here I sit in my lonely room  
Lookin for my sunshine  
All Ive got is two cigarettes  
And this broken heart of mine  
  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down down  
  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down down  
  
Why dont you answer your phone  
  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down down  
Seventeen days  
  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down down  
Seventeen days
