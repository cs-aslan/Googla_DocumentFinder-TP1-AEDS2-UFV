Shes taken my time  
Convinced me shes fine  
But when she leaves Im not so sure  
Its always the same  
Shes playing her game  
And when she goes I feel to blame  
Why wont she say she needs me  
I know shes not as strong as she seems  
  
Why dont I see her cry for help  
Why dont I feel her cry for help  
Why dont I hear her cry for help  
  
I wandered around  
The streets of this town  
Trying to find sense of it all  
The rain on my face  
It covers the trace  
All of the tears Id had to waste  
Why must we hide emotions  
Why must we never break down and cry  
  
All that I need is to cry for help  
Somebody please hear me cry for help  
All I can do is cry for help  
  
No need to feel ashamed  
Release the pain  
Cry for help  
  
Cry for help is all I need  
All I need is a cry for help  
Cry for help is all I need  
All I need is a cry for help  
  
Why must we hide emotions  
Why cant we ever break down and cry  
All that I need is to cry for help  
I will be there when you cry for help  
Why dont I hear her cry for help  
  
All that I need is to cry for help  
Somebody please hear me cry for help  
All I can do is cry for help  
  
All that I need is to cry for help  
I will be there when you cry for help  
Is it so hard to cry for help  
  
Cry for help is all I need  
No need to feel ashamed  
All I need is a cry for help  
Come on and release the pain  
Cry for help is all I need  
Put your trust in me  
All I need is a cry for help  
My love is gonna set you free  
  
Woooooooooooooo
