Alberts always sincere hes a sensitive type  
His intentions are clear he wanna be wellliked  
If everything is nothing then are we anything  
Is it better to be better than to be anything  
And Alberts vision is blooming uncontrolled  
All his wings are slowly sinking  
The world begins to disappear  
The worst things come from inside here  
All the kings men reappear  
For an eggman on and off the wall  
Wholl never be together again  
Einsteins down on the beach staring into the sand  
Cause everything he believes in is shattered  
What you fear in the night in the day comes to call anywayay  
We all get burned as  
One more sun comes sliding down the sky  
One more shadow leans against the wall  
The world begins to disappear  
The worst things come from inside here  
And all the kings men reappear  
For an eggman on and off the wall  
Wholl never be together again  
Alberts waiting in the sun  
On a field American  
For the cause of some inflated form of hit and run  
One more sun comes sliding down the sky  
One more shadow leans against the wall  
The world begins to disappear  
The worst things come from inside here  
And all the kings men reappear  
For an eggman fallin off the wall  
Will never be together again  
Alberts fallen on the sun  
Cracked his head wide open  
The world begins to disappear  
The worst things come from inside here  
And all the kings men reappear  
For an eggman falling falling  
The world begins to disappear  
The worst things come from inside here  
And all the kings men reappear  
For an eggman fallin off the wall  
Will never be together again  
No never be together again  
No no never never never again uh huh  
What you fear in the night in the day comes to call anyway
