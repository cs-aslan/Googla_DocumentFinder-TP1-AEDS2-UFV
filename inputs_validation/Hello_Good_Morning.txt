Rick RossHello Good morning tell me what the lip read  
Pretty face thin waist with the sick weave  
First time fish tailing in the 6 speed  
Real bad boy tell em come and get me  
Im at the fight been kinda like Bellmen  
Only took the trip to the truck twice  
Unpacked the Mac 11 and air maxs  
Stuff six figures in my damn air mattress  
Uh Im in love with large bills  
A dime with a fat ass thin waist and tall heels  
Yeah its the teflon Don  
Hundred carrots in the charm tryna give it back to Sean

Wait wait hold on maybe they didnt get that here  
Like 11 hundred horses when I switch that gear  
Swerve on them sorta like I missed that dear  
Press that little button on the sit back chair  
Btch I do it cause I get it

If you got a million dollars you could put it up in debit  
I just be like hello hello but I never could salute them  
Young money I do it for the yout dem
