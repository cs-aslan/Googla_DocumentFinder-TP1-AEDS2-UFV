Childhood part of my life it wasnt very pretty  
You see I was born and raised in the slums of the city  
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me  
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep  
It was hard times  
Needed something to ease my troubled mind  
Listen my father didnt know the meaning of work  
He disrespected mama and treated us like dirt  
I left home seekin a job that I never did find  
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine  
Im doin fine up here on cloud nine  
Listen one more time Im doin fine up here on cloud nine  
Folks down there tell me  
They say give yourself a chance son dont let life pass you by  
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive  
Its a dog eat dog world and that aint no lie  
Listen it aint even safe no more to walk the streets at night  
Im doin fine on cloud nine  
Let me tell you about cloud nine  
  
Cloud nine you can be what you wanna be  
cloud nine you aint got no responsibility  
And evry man evry man is free  
cloud nine and youre a million miles from reality  
I wanna say I love the life I live  
And Im gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine  
Im riding high  
On cloud nine youre as free as a bird in flight  
cloud nine theres no diffrence between day and night  
cloud nine its a world of love and harmony  
cloud nine youre a million miles from reality  
  
Cloud nine you can be what you wanna be  
Cloud nine you aint got no responsibility  
And evry man evry man is free  
cloud nine and youre a million miles from reality  
cloud nine cloud nine cloud nine
