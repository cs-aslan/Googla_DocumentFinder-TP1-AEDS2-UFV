Dont make me over  
Now that I cant  
Make it without you  
Dont make me over  
I wouldnt change  
One thing about you  
  
Dont pick on the things  
I say  
The things I do  
Just love me with all my faults  
The way that I love you  
Im begging you  
  
Dont make me over  
Now that Id do anything for you  
Dont make me over  
Now that you know how I adore you  
  
Just take me inside your arms  
And hold me tight  
And always be by my side  
If I am wrong or right  
Im begging you  
  
Dont make me over  
Dont make me over  
Now that youve got me  
At your command  
  
Accept me for what I am  
Accept me for the things I do  
Accept me for what I am  
Accept me for the things I do  
  
Just take me inside your arms  
And hold me tight  
And always be by my side  
Even if I am wrong or right  
Im begging you  
  
Dont make me over  
No dont make me over  
Now that  
Youve got me at your command  
  
Accept me for what I am  
Accept me for the things I do  
Accept me for what I am babe  
Accept me for the things I do  
  
Dont make me over  
Dont make me over  
Accept me for what I am  
Accept me for the things I do
