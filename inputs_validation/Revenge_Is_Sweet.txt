Revenge is sweet and I cant wait  
Walk down the street girl dont be late  
  
Now I dont want your sympathy  
So dont go sheddin no tears  
For evry wrong that you did to me  
Ill give you back in fear  
  
Now its too late for apologies  
Youve been through this trick before  
A million lies that you laid on me  
You knocked me down on the floor  
  
Im gonna get you back  
Its just a matter of time  
Its a grudge Ill nurse  
Ill pay you back in kind youll find  
  
You had the chance to put things right  
But you preferred to be cruel  
Im sick of pleadin on my knees  
Im tired of watchin you drool  
  
Im gonna get you back  
Its just a matter of time  
This is one grudge Ill nurse  
Ill pay you back in kind youll find  
  
Revenge is sweet and I cant wait

Revenge is sweet revenge is sweet
