I hope you hang yourself with your stupid scarf  
While jacking off listening to Mozart  
You mean and moan about L A  
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway  
You dont eat meat and drive electrical cars  
Youre so indie rock its almost an art  
You need money  
Just to stay alive  
  
Youre so stupid and you dont even like boys  
No you dont even like no you dont even like no you dont even like boys  
Youre so stupid and you dont even like boys  
No you dont even like no you dont even like no you dont even like boys  
  
Youre so mad maybe you should buy a big mac  
Youre so skinny you should really super size the deal  
Secretly you youre so amused  
And nobody understands you  
Im so mean cuz cannot get you out of your head  
Im so angry cuz youd rather my space instead  
I cant believe I fell in love  
With someone that wears more make up and  
  
Youre so stupid and you dont even like boys  
No you dont even like no you dont even like no you dont even like boys  
Youre so stupid and you dont even like boys  
No you dont even like no you dont even like no you dont even like  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
La la la  
La la la  
Oh oh oh  
Do do do do bop bop bow  
Do do do bop bop Day  
Youre so stupid youre so stupid  
  
You walking around like youre oh so debonair  
You pull them down and theres really nothing there  
I wish you would just be real with me  
  
Youre so stupid and you dont even like boys  
No you dont even like no you dont even like no you dont even like boys  
Youre so stupid and you dont even like boys  
No you dont even like no you dont even like no you dont even like  
Youre so stupid and you dont even like boys  
No you dont even like no you dont even like no you dont even like  
Boys  
No you dont even like no you dont even like no no no no no no
