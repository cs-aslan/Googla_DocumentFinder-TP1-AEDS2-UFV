Its 211 and Im stressing  
Watching TV in my hotel suite  
I check my service every second  
At 210 you still hadnt called me  
  
So Im gonna leave my cell phone  
Turned on in my purse by the bed  
And before I fall asleep  
I guess Ill just check my machine  
  
Again and again because Im  
Obsessing on you  
  
Chorus  
I want to be your babydoll  
Wrap me up nice and tight  
Love me through the night  
Come lay me down  
Enfold me in your arms  
Cover me with velvet kisses  
Rock me on and on  
And whisper softly to me  
You want to be my babydoll  
  
Zoning out thinking about  
You and me between the sheets  
I want to get intimate  
But youre not within my reach  
  
So Ill have a little more wine  
And Ill try to drink you  
Out of my head  
And Ill lay awake awhile  
  
Til Im high enough I can  
Forget about you until  
I wake up again  
  
I want to be your babydoll  
Wrap me up nice and tight  
Love me through the night  
ome lay me down  
  
Enfold me in your arms  
Cover me with velvet kisses  
Rock me on and on  
And whisper softly to me  
You want to be my babydoll  
  
Slipping into dreams  
I feel my love surround you  
Ny subconscious seems  
To weave itself around you  
  
Do you care for me  
Beyond idolization  
Tell me how you feel  
But dont keep me at bay  
  
Cause I wont be waiting long  
  
I want to be your babydoll  
Wrap me up nice and tight  
Love me through the night  
Come lay me down  
  
Enfold me in your arms  
Cover me with velvet kisses  
Rock me on and on  
And whisper softly to me  
  
You want to be my babydoll  
  
I want to be your babydoll  
Wrap me up nice and tight  
Love me through the night  
Come lay me down  
  
Enfold me in your arms  
Cover me with velvet kisses  
Rock me on and on  
And whisper softly to me  
You want to be my babydoll
