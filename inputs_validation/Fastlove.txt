Gotta get up get down  
Ooh ooh baby baby  
  
Looking for some education  
Made my way into the night  
All that bullshit conversation  
Baby cant you read the signs  
  
I wont bore you with the details baby  
I dont even wannna waste your time  
Lets just say that maybe  
You could help to ease my mind  
Baby I aint Mr Right  
  
But if youre looking for fast love  
If thats love in your eyes its more than enough  
Had some bad love  
Some fast love is all that Ive got on my mind  
  
ooh ooh baby baby  
Ooh yeah yeah ooh ooh baby baby  
Whats there to think about baby  
ooh ooh baby baby  
Hey baby oh yeah ooh ooh baby baby  
  
Looking for some affirmation made my way into the sun  
My friends got their ladies theyre all having babies  
But I just want to have some fun  
  
I wont bore you with the detail baby  
You gotta get there in your own sweet time  
Lets just say that maybe you could help  
To ease my mind baby I aint Mr Right  
  
But if youre looking for fast love  
If thats love in your eyes its more than enough  
Had some bad love  
Some fast love is all that Ive got on my mind  
  
So close I can taste it now baby so close  
  
In the absence of security I made my way into the night  
Stupid Cupid keeps on calling me  
And I see lovin in his eyes  
I miss my baby oh yeah I miss my baby tonight  
So why dont we make a little room  
In my BMW babe searchin for some peace of mind  
Hey Ill help you find it  
I do believe that we are practicing the same religion  
  
Oh you really oughta get up now thats right  
Oh you really oughta get up
