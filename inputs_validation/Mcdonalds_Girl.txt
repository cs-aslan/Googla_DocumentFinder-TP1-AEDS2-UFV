I am in love with a McDonalds girl  
She has a smile of innocence  
So tender and warm  
I am in love with a McDonalds girl  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform  
I leave from softball practice every night  
Its getting dark but the golden arches light up the way  
I turn the corner at the traffic light  
I count my money and I rehearse what Im gonna say  
Id like an order of fries  
And QuarterPounder with Cheese  
I love the light in your eyes  
Will you go out with me please  
I am in love with a McDonalds girl  
She has a smile of innocence  
So tender and warm  
I am in love with a McDonalds girl  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform  
She doesnt try to impress anyone  
She doesnt try to be tough  
Like all the girls that I know  
She doesnt treat me like a simpleton  
I wanna say how I feel  
If I could just let go  
And when my hamburgers cold  
I get up ready to go  
Shes only 16 years old  
And Im in love with her so  
I am in love with a McDonalds girl  
She has a smile of innocence  
So tender and warm  
I am in love with a McDonalds girl  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform  
There she stands behind the register  
Taking orders from the  
Provo City Little League  
If they knew how much I wanted her  
Their home room teacher would have  
To send them home for a week  
And when I head for the door the  
Moonlight catches her eyes  
My heart begins to soar she smiles  
And waves goodbye Goodbye  
I am in love with a McDonalds girl  
She has a smile of innocence  
So tender and warm  
I am in love with a McDonalds girl  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform What a babe  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform  
I am in love with a McDonalds Girl
