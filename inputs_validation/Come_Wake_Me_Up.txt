I can usually drink you right off of my mind  
But I miss you tonight  
I can normally push you right out of my heart  
But Im too tired to fight  
  
Yeah the whole thing begins  
And I let you sink into my veins  
And I feel the pain like its new  
Everything that we were  
Everything that you said  
Everything that I did and that I couldnt do  
Plays through tonight  
  
Tonight your memory burns like a fire  
With every word it grows higher and higher  
I cant get over it I just cant put out this love  
I just sit in these flames and pray that youll come back  
Close my eyes tightly hold on and hope that Im dreaming  
Come wake me up  
  
Turn the TV up loud just to drown out your voice  
But I cant forget  
Now Im all out of ideas  
And baby Im down to my last cigarette  
  
Yeah youre probably asleep deep inside of your dreams  
While Im sitting here crying and trying to sleep  
Yeah wherever you are baby now I am sure youve moved on  
And arent thinking twice about me and you tonight  
  
Tonight your memory burns like a fire  
With everyone it grows higher and higher  
I cant get over it I just cant put out this love  
I just sit in these flames and pray that youll come back  
Close my eyes tightly hold on and hope that Im dreaming  
  
I know that youre movin on  
I know I should give you up  
But I keep hopin that youll trip and fall back in love  
  
Times not healin anything  
Baby this pain is worse than it ever was  
I know that you cant hear me but baby I need you to save me tonight  
  
Tonight your memory burns like a fire  
With everyone it grows higher and higher  
I cant get over it I just cant put out this love  
I just sit in these flames and pray that youll come back  
Close my eyes tightly hold on and hope that Im dreaming  
Come wake me up  
Oh Im dreaming  
Come wake me up  
Oh Im dreaming
