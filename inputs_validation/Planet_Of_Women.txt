What can I do Im a nervous wreck  
Theres girls everywhere I better go and check CHECK IT OUT  
I cant tell a diamond from a hole in the ground  
They all got my head spinning round and round  
Planet of women oh yeah  
The planet of women oh yeah  
Its driving me insane  
  
They start by acting just a little discreet  
Then theyre in the skies and theyre in the streets  
You can find them in cars or a hotel lobby  
theyre easy to find just look for a body  
Planet of women oh yeah  
Just a planet of women oh yeah  
Its driving me insane  
  
If you have the answer drop me a line today  
or send a straight jacket something in a shade of gray  
I think Ive sprained my brain cause it wont unwind  
Every day its man against man on the  
planet of women oh yeah  
Just a planet of women oh yeah  
Its driving me insane  
its driving me insane
