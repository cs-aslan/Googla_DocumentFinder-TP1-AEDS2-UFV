You know why  
They called and just let it ring  
No reply  
The door is open I swear  
Aint no use in pickin up  
You know why  
  
Chorus  
Its all my head I know  
So they tell me so  
Until my head explodes  
Into my head it goes  
  
Tastes so good  
Oh but I knew it would  
Tastes so good  
Burn like a match house  
Medicate just to make you soft  
Love is blind  
  
Catchin the rest me  
What the hell were they thinking of  
You know why  
  
Chorus
