Queuing with the old folk  
Theres and old man with a wicked smile  
Not through smug politeness  
Hes doing it in style  
  
No savings book or flannel slacks  
No Pardon when I heard them ask  
Just a vodaphone and a filofax  
  
When Im 64  
Ill dream on  
  
They all bore the milkman  
Stop him for hours at their front gate  
He just sits and thinks  
Ill make the bastard wait  
  
No dribbling or incontinence  
No longing for the old sixpence  
Just smoking weed till age makes sense  
  
When Im 74  
Ill dream on  
  
They all save for Blackpool  
Just for the cheap companionship  
Meanwhile he counts pennies  
For a different trip  
  
No smoking pipes and drinking bitter  
No eyeing up the baby sitter  
Ill trip up kids and Ill drop my litter  
  
When Im 84  
Ill dream on  
When Im 84  
Ill dream on late  
Ill dream on  
And Ill whisper late  
  
Youre in your nineties Arthur  
Be careful with your back  
Exercise your muscles  
Id rather Jack  
Id rather Jack
