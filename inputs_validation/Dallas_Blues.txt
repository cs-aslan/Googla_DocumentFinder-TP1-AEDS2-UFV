When your moneys gone  
Friends have turned you down  
And you wander round  
Just like a hound  
A lonesome houn  
Then you stop to say  
Let me go away from this old town  
This awful town  
Theres a place I know  
Folks wont pass me by  
Dallas Texas thats the town  
I cry  
Oh hear me cry  
And Im going back  
Going back to stay there til I die  
Until I die  
Ive got the Dallas blues  
And the Main Street heart disease  
Its buzzin round  
Ive got the Dallas blues  
And the Main Street heart disease  
Its buzzin round  
Buzzin round my head  
Like a swarm of little honey bees  
Of honey bees  
When I got up north  
Clothes I had to spare  
Sold em all to pay my railroad fare  
My railroad fare  
Just to come back there  
Ridin in a Pullman parlor chair  
A parlor chair  
Sent a telegram this is what I said  
Baby bring a cold towel for my head  
My achin head  
Got the Dallas blues  
And your lovin man is almost dead  
Is almost dead  
Im goin put myself on a Santa Fe and go  
Im goin to go  
Im goin to put myself on a Santa Fe and go  
Im goin to go  
To that Texas town  
Where you never see the ice and snow  
The ice and the snow
