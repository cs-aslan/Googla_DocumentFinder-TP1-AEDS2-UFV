Dog night Im so alone  
A million miles out on my own  
No one to talk no one to care  
Searching for someone they could be anywhere  
Magic and madness its so very strange  
Soemtimes I think its all prearranged  
That same old feeling hits me again  
Just the beginning but its feels like the end  
Oh feel like Im stranded out here  
Oh I think I might disappear  
No dont leave me stranded out here  
Oh its just the loneliness I fear  
  
Lonely window fading star  
You never felt so near yet so far  
Tried to forget you the best that I could  
Dont try to find me it wont do any good  
Im caught in a dream so hard to locate  
Im just a captive of my own fate  
No turning back no not tonight  
Youre moving on way out of sight  
Oh feel like Im stranded out here  
Oh I think I might disappear  
No dont leave me stranded out here  
Oh its just the loneliness I fear  
Stranded 8 times  
Oh I feel like Im stranded out here  
Same as before  
Stranded
