102071 the day I come out  
Two days later Im running my mouth  
Moms put a bottle to my grill  
I look her in the face and I say chill  
So she puts her back up on a pillow uh huh  
Two minutes later Im bailin out the hospital  
On my way to the liquor store  
First thing I grab is some skins and a 40  
Dropped the OE cause its just too cold  
Get myself some gin instead and then I stroll  
But before I get out the door  
The man behind the counter says hey yo yo  
He picks me up and sit me on the seat  
And then he get the phone and get to dialin the police  
Im on the run but I cant walk yet  
Cant grapple nothin said cause I cant talk yet  
First trip in the police car  
Cameras all around me as if I was a star  
Moms grabbed me hugged me and kissed me  
This fool tried to twist me moms say she missed me I missed you  
Regroup it swoopin in the coupe and  
Thats what Ima name you cause boy you be snoopin  
Soon to be hoopin hoes I be scoopin  
First piece of ass before I got my first whoopin
