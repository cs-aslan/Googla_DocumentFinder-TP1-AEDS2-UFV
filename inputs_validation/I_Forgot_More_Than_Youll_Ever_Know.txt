I forgot more than youll ever know about her  
You think you know the smile on her lips  
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips  
But I forgot more than youll ever know about her  
You think youll find heaven of bliss  
In each caress in each tender kiss  
But I forgot more than youll ever know about her  
You stole her love from me one day  
You didnt care oh it hurt me  
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be  
You think shes yours to have and to hold  
Someday youll learn when her love grows cold  
But I forgot more than youll ever know about her
