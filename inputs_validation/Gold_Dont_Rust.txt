I know you worry everytime I go away  
You wonder will these sweet sweet feelings shine or fade  
But thats a question you dont have to ask  
What heaven makes it always makes to last  
  
Gold dont rust Love dont lie  
Ill be true till the day that I die  
Trust in me you will find  
Baby youre the gold in this heart of mine  
And that gold will shine for a long long time  
  
I wish that I could give you what you need from me  
But what good is a promise or a guarantee  
Love is still a simple act of faith  
And a faithful is heart is always worth the weight  
  
Gold dont rust Love dont lie  
Ill be true till the day that I die  
Trust in me you will find  
Baby youre the gold in this heart of mine  
And that gold will shine for a long long time  
  
Love is still a simple act of faith  
And a faithful is heart is always worth the weight  
  
Gold dont rust Love dont lie  
Ill be true till the day that I die  
Trust in me you will find  
Baby youre the gold in this heart of mine  
And that gold will shine for a long long time  
  
Baby youre the gold in this heart of mine  
And that gold will shine for a long long long time
