Peters on the loose  
Id like to see him again  
I remember when  
We made love  
On the jetty in the rain  
When the fishing boats would  
Come back in  
At the end of the day  
Hed run up the hill to my cabin  
With a swordfish and hed say  
Girl I want you all over again  
All over again  
  
Chorus  
In Menemsha Menemsha  
Menemsha Menemsha  
  
The sunset on the sound  
Were almost too much to take  
We would dance on the hill  
With our friends  
Til the morning would break  
Everybody drank too much beer  
In those days  
Thank God it wasnt whisky  
Or wed all be dead  
And Peter and me wed pull the shades  
Everyone was interested  
In Peter and me  
  
Chorus
