One of these Nights Ill shake you  
I will take you from my veins  
Im gettin tired of waiting  
Its time to empty me  
  
Chorus  
We can rip apart this bleeding heart dont you wanna watch me spill  
Bleed you out again  
  
Feeling me reach inside you  
And I feel you run through me  
Funny how you remind me  
I got memories to drain  
  
Chorus X2  
  
Bleed me slowly until every vein is empty just like you  
Bleed me slowly until every vein is empty just like you  
Please oh please oh youre draining me  
Ive got to bleed myself of you  
Please oh please oh youre draining me  
Ive got to bleed Ive got to bleed for you  
  
Chorus X2
