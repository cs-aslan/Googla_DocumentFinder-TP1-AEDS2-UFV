People are sayin  
That boy is gonna hurt you  
His kind of love is not for real  
Hes only playin  
Foolin with your heart girl  
But I know how he makes me feel  
And I dont need any other proof  
They just dont understand  
They dont know the truth  
Momma says hes bad for me  
Poppa says Ill be sorry  
Everybodys talkin my baby down  
And all my friends doubt him  
Tell me I should live without him  
Everybodys talkin my baby down  
  
Hes not like the others  
Nobody wants to see it  
They dont even want to try  
  
Judge a book by its cover  
And youll never know the story  
Theres so much more than meets the eye  
Oh and I know his heart is true  
I dont need anyone  
To tell me what to do  
  
chorus  
My sisters and my brothers  
Tell me I should find another  
Everybodys talkin my baby down  
  
Oh but they cant feel his touch  
They cant feel his kiss  
They dont know what its like to be  
Loved like this  
I dont care about their point of view  
Cause its understood  
When the love is good  
Nothin else is gonna do  
  
chorus  
No they dont know what hes all about  
Everybody just want to talk my baby down  
No they cant see that his heart is gold  
Everybody want to treat my baby so cold  
So cold  
  
chorus
