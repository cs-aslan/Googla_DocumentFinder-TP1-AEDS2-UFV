My name is Norman Lou Norman  
Ive been in this business for fifteen years  
If people have a problem and dont want talk to the police they want talk to
me  
So this Friday afternoon I got a phone call  
Young lady asked me to go downtown  
  
What the hell is a girl like Mandy Cooper doing at the lower Manhattan Ocean
Club  
Looking like a taxi Texan model  
And with a voice like Mahalia Jackson  
She dont need to work in slots like this  
She got the pair of blue eyes that look green to me  
And then she approached me  
Oh boy  
  
Miss Cooper I suppose  
Lets stop playing games  
Im on the job here lets come to terms  
She tried to wind me up with some nonsense about an exboyfriend who was
giving her a hard time  
I said listen honey we all know you can help yourself  
If you want me to work on your case lets get things straight and now  
Oh boy  
  
Nobody is ever gonna damage your career  
With a voice like this and a pair of eyes youre gonna be huge in any
business  
You still dont smoke  
I need a drink  
And maybe youll join me  
Looks better for the chappy over there  
Looks like old friends  
Meeting after a hard nights work  
  
I walked to the corner slowly  
Wanted to ask Mr Big here for a light  
He turned around  
  
I put a quarter into the jukebox and played a beautiful Ave Maria  
When I turned around Miss Cooper had gone
