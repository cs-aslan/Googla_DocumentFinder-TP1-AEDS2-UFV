I said hello Dolly  
Well hello Dolly  
Its so nice to have you back where you belong  
Youre lookin swell Dolly  
I can tell Dolly  
Youre still glowin  
Youre still crowin  
Youre still goin strong  
I feel that room swayin  
While the bands playin  
One of your old favourite songs from way back when  
So take her wrap fellas  
Find her an empty lap fellas  
Dollyll never go away again
