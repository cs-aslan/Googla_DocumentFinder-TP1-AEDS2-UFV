Rikky Rockn Roller now that youre the headline  
Rikky Rockn Roller dont it make you feel fine  
Is it true to hear the fans scream  
To stand in the lights is just like a dream  
What a dream  
To be what you are a rock and roll star  
To make such a lot of money  
Would be funny  
Oh I wish I could be like you Rikky Rockn Roller  
  
Today a new jet plane  
Tonight its a new hotel  
You live in your own world  
Youre under a magic spell

To hear the fans scream  
To stand in the lights is just like a dream Rikky Rockn Roller
