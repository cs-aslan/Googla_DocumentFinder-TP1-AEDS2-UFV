And all throughout I gaze and glimpse you  
Loving never did convince you  
I see you when youre all alone  
Its like a person Ive not known  
  
The moment ends though I feel winds  
Blowing differently than ever before  
And theyre pushing me further from shore  
  
A frothy cap the steady slap  
Of lines against the rail  
A biting rain take in the main  
  
Up the rigging take in sail mind the skipper well not fail  
Hell bring out wine all will be fine just hear the order watch the sail  
The moment ends
