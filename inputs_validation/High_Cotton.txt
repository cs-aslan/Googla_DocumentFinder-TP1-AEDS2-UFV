We didnt know the times were lean  
Round our house the grass was green  
It didnt seem like things were all that bad  
  
I bet we walked a thousand miles  
Choppin cotton and pusing plows  
And learnin how to give it all we had  
  
As Life went on and years went by  
I saw the light in daddys eye  
And felt the love in mammas hands  
They kept us warm and kept us fed  
Taught us how to look ahead  
Now lookin back I understand  
  
We were walkin in high cotton  
Old times there are not forgotten  
Those fertile fields are never far away  
We were walkin in high cotton  
Old time there are not forgotten  
Leavin home was the hardest thing we ever faced  
  
When Sunday mornings rolled around  
We dressed up handmedowns  
Just in time to gather with the church  
Some times I think how long Its been  
And how it impressed me then  
It was the only day my daddy wouldnt work  
  
We were walkin in high cotton  
Old times there are not forgotten  
Those fertile fields are never far away  
We were walkin in high cotton  
Old time there are not forgotten  
Leavin home was the hardest thing we ever faced  
  
We were walkin in high cotton  
Old times there are not forgotten  
Those fertile fields are never far away  
We were walkin in high cotton  
Old time there are not forgotten  
Leavin home was the hardest thing we ever faced  
  
We were walkin in high cotton  
Old times there are not forgotten  
Those fertile fields are never far away  
We were walkin in high cotton  
Old time there are not forgotten  
Leavin home was the hardest thing we ever faced  
  
Walkin in High Cotton
