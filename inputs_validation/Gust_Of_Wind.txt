My heart is filled with love and care  
Not an ounce of gas I would get up there  
The answers simple  
You lift me up  
The view up here I see all the stars  
There go Venus and there go Mars  
Somethin you been through  
Youre from above  
  
Hey when I first saw you I got excited  
Tried to keep my composure tryna hide it  
But I didnt know  
I didnt let go  
Then it occurred to me while tryna fight it  
Just like a kite you learn to ride it  
But I didnt know  
Youre sposed to let it go  
  
Like a gust of wind  
You hit me off sometimes  
Like a gust of wind  
You push me back every once in a while  
Like a gust of wind  
You remind me theres someone up there  
Who whooshes in  
The air I need to power myself  
  
When I open the window  
I wanna hug you  
Cause you remind me of the air  
I said yeah  
Cause when Im feelin real low  
I remember I love you  
I put my hands in the air  
And you were there  
  
With your love I can board the skies  
Finding a way that electrifies mothers your other  
Cannot stow away  
Telephone winds of the northern sky  
Is the closest thing and here is why  
Cause were color  
You blow me away  
  
I need you like Im breathing  
Music umbrellas can make one cover  
Who cares if they dont see you  
Dont you know that theyre the same  
I need it like Im breathing  
If you never discover forever youll suffer  
Who cares if they dont see you  
You got until then to learn the way  
  
Like a gust of wind  
You hit me off sometimes  
Like a gust of wind  
You push me back every once in a while  
Like a gust of wind  
You remind me theres someone up there  
Who whooshes in  
The air I need to power myself  
  
When I open the window  
I wanna hug you  
Cause you remind me of the air  
I said yeah  
Cause when Im feelin real low  
I remember I love you  
I put my hands in the air  
And you were there  
  
When I first saw you I got excited  
Tried to keep my composure tryna hide it  
But I didnt know  
I didnt let go  
Then I realized Im tryna fight it  
Just so they can learn to ride it  
But I didnt know  
I had to let it go
