Oh yeah  
Hey yo man  
Aint nothin like a nice bowl of cornflakes in the morning  
To smooth you out  
  
Milky cereal  
Baby  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
  
Mirror mirror on the wall  
Whos the baddest female of them all  
It was Frosted Flake she loved to bowl  
And although her skin was white she had a lot of soul  
Rich female very debonair  
Drivin a Rolls with rollers in her hair  
We was hangin out pumpin the stereo  
She took me to a club I think the name was Cheerios  
She walked like she was jumpin a hurdle  
I was happy as a kid that just saw Mutant Ninja Turtles  
A guy walked over said Your earrings cute  
I said Im wearin a earring but it aint no Fruit Loop  
Me and Frosted went to get a drink  
But she ordered somethin bugged and I aint know what to think  
She ordered potassium calcium  
Carbohydrate scotch with sodium  
She took me to her crib threw me on the couch  
I woke up the next morning with a spoon in my mouth  
Shes  
  
Chorus  
Milky cereal  
Baby  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
  
I went to Vegas didnt think itd do any harm  
I walked into this girl named Lucky Charm  
For some reason we walked in the rain  
She had a fourleaf clover with a big gold chain  
She had a salary that was full of calories for real  
And I was in the mood for a home cooked meal  
So we went to be alone  
But we had to be quiet cause her corn pops was home  
Kissed her neck kissed her back kissed her arms  
I said Forget it let me see your lucky charms  
When we began her hairstyle was neat  
But when I left the next morning it looked like shredded wheat  
Talked about marriage I said Thats risky  
Besides its such a waste of Rice Crispies  
She had a robe with the velour material  
Her pops woke up I said Hello Mr Cereal  
I came this morning to deliver the paper  
He said Stop frontin I know you caught the vapors  
Thats my daughter so save your croonin  
You better find another bowl of cereal to stick your spoon in  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah check this out here  
  
Then there was Pebbles times was rough  
She was turnin tricks to get her coocoo puff  
Her mind was gone but she turned me on in fact  
She was wearin an Apple Jack hat  
With a fulllink fox and some pink bobbysocks  
Her father had a greedy disease fried chicken pocks  
We called him Hungry Jack  
He talked like pops and then he dressed like The Mack  
He invited me out to lunch  
With a old army buddy of his Captain Crunch  
The waiter said Jack what would you like today  
He said I dont know just make it Special K  
He said Cool came back with the order  
Thats when I said Hey yo Jack I like your daughter  
He said Pebbles Boy are your crazy  
I said Nah I want to ride in a Mercedes  
She could sing while Im swingin my thing  
Cause her burgers taste better than Burger King  
He said Go party do some minglin  
You and my daughter your brain must be jinglin  
I said Its smooth no disrespect  
Shell sign a prenup so she dont get half of my week cheque  
Then we walked down the aisle  
Our honeymoon was milky cereal style  
  
You know what Im sayin  
  
Chorus  
  
Milky  
  
Peace
