Mud Slime Slim and the blue horizon  
Oh Mud Slime and depending on you  
I dont know but Ive been told  
Theres a time from time to time  
I cant eat I cant sleep  
But I just like to move my feet  
Cause theres nothing like the sound of sweet soul music  
To change your ladys mind  
And theres nothing like a walk on down by the bayou  
To leave the world behind  
Mud Slime Im depending on you  
Mr Mud Slime Slim on the blue horizon  
Ive been letting the time go by letting the time go by  
Yes Im letting the time go by letting the time go by  
I wanted cash in my hand  
Pick upon a piece of land  
Build myself a cabin back in the woods  
Lord its there Im gonna stay  
Until there comes a day  
When this old world starts changing for the good  
Now the reason Im smiling  
Is over on an island  
On a hillside in the woods where I belong  
I wanna thank Jimmy Jimmy John and Mick and Robbie  
Of Nojets Construction to send me down homestead on a farm  
Oh Mud Slime Im depending on you  
Mr Mud Slim on the blue horizon  
Ive been letting the time go by letting the time go by  
Yes Im letting the time go by letting the time go by
