Im Gonna Get You  
Im Gonna  
Buy You A Little Horse  
You Can Ride  
You Can Play All Day  
My Little Child  
Were Gonna Go  
Out The Fields Tonight  
Youll Be Brave  
Youll Be Strong One Day  
  
Chorus  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Try To See Things My Way  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Cant You See It In My Face  
  
And Now I See Im Not  
The Girl I Used To Be  
Times Have Changed  
Wheres The Mercy  
And Grace  
More And More Theres No  
Light Inside Of Me  
All The Pain All The Strain  
Is Killing Me  
  
Chorus  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Try To See Things My Way  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Dontt Walk Away  
From My Face  
  
Another Storm  
My Shoes Are Worn  
Its All Too Much  
Its All Too Long  
I Close My Eyes  
Until The Morn  
And Hope It All  
Just Goes Away  
  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Try To See Things My Way  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Dontt Walk  
Away From My Face  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Try To See Things My Way  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Wheres The Mercy  
And Grace
