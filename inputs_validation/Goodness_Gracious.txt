I lost the signal and put you away  
Swore upon the sun Id save you for a rainy day  
Loosen the noose and let go of the rope  
I know if its never coming back it has to go  
  
I keep callin your name keep callin your name  
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed  
So I keep callin at night keep callin at night  
I wanna hold you close I just never I wanna hold you tight  
  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin me out callin me out just to keep crawlin into your arms  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin me out callin me out just to keep crawlin into your arms  
  
I found the weakness and put it to play  
Swore upon the stars Id keep you til the night was day  
Shake my head dizzy so Ill never know  
You said if youre never comin back you have to go  
  
I keep callin your name keep callin your name  
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed  
So I keep callin at night keep callin at night  
I wanna hold you close I just never wanna hold you tight  
  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin me out callin me out just to keep crawlin into your arms  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin me out callin me out just to keep crawlin into your arms  
  
Ah callin me out just to keep crawlin into your arms  
Callin me out just to keep crawlin into your arms  
  
Oh my goodness here I go again  
Pullin you back to me pullin you back into my arms so selfishly  
I dont think I understand cause I dont really know myself  
I keep callin you callin you out  
Callin you out callin you out callin you out  
  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin me out callin me out just to keep crawlin into your arms  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin me out callin me out just to keep crawlin into your arms  
  
Ah ah callin me out just to keep crawlin into your arms  
Ah ah callin me out just to keep crawlin into your arms
