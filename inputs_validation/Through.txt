Is that enough  
I think its over  
See everything has changed  
And all this hatred may just make me strong enough  
To walk away  
  
They may chase me to the ends of the earth  
But Ive got you babe  
And they may strip me of the things that Ive worked for  
But Ive had my say  
  
So hear me now  
Ive enough of these chains  
I know theyre of my making  
No one else to blame for where I stand today  
Ive no memory of truth  
But suddenly the audience is so cruel  
So God hey God you know why Im through  
  
Through  
  
I guess its tough I guess Im older  
And everything must change  
But all this cruelty and money instead of love  
People have we no shame  
  
They may chase me to the ends of the earth  
But Ive got you babe  
And they may take away the things that Ive worked for  
But youll pull me through  
  
Its so clear to me now  
Ive enough of these chains  
Life is there for the taking  
What kind of fool would remain in this cheap gilded cage  
Ive no memory of truth  
But suddenly the audience is so cruel  
Oh God Im sorry  
  
I think Im through  
I think Im through  
I think Im I know Im
