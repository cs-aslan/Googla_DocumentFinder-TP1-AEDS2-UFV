Tough of the track  
With the wind  
And the rain thats beating down on your back  
Your hearts beating loud  
And goes on getting louder  
And goes on even more till the sound  
Is ringing in your head  
With every step you tread  
And every breath you take  
Determination makes  
  
You run  
Never stop  
Gotta win gotta run till you drop  
Keep the pace  
Hold the race  
Your mind is getting clearer  
Youre over halfway there but the miles  
Just never seem to end  
As if youre in a dream  
Not getting anywhere  
It seems so futile  
  
Run on and on  
Run on and on  
The loneliness of the long distance runner  
  
Ive got to keep running the course  
Ive got to keep running and win at all costs  
Ive got to keep going be strong  
Must be so determined and push myself on  
  
Run over stiles across fields  
Turn to look at whos on your heels  
Way ahead of the field  
The line is getting nearer but do  
You want the glory that goes  
You reach the final stretch  
Ideals are just a trace  
You feel like throwing the race  
Its all so futile  
  
Run on and on  
Run on and on  
The loneliness of the long distance runner
