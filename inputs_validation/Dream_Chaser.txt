Im gonna pack my bags and drive all night  
Ill be in the mountains by morning light  
Drive the road I traveled years ago  
As a young girl leaving home  
  
With dreams as big as the trees were tall  
I knew Id have nothing or Id have it all  
And you all know what happens when the bright lights call  
Youre either gonna make or youre gonna fall  
Make it or youre gonna fall  
  
Chorus  
Im a dream chaser a star gazer thats what I am  
But Ive always known Id come back home when I found my rainbows end  
Rainmakers and heart breakers could never change my plans  
Dream chaser thats what I am  
  
Im goin home where the stars shine bright in a mountain sky  
That path above Ive followed all of my life  
Its guiding me back to where my dreams began  
Then Ill be gone again  
Ill be gone again  
  
Chorus  
  
Dream chaser thats what I am
