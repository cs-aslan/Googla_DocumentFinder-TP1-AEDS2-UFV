Two story prisons in a line  
Livin in this town  
Is a whole lot like dying  
I want to see whats still left to see  
  
And you really oughta run with me  
Baby I knew right from the start  
Youre just a discontented romantic at heart  
And youre tired of all that you see  
And you really oughta run with me  
  
Come on run with me  
This ol town is no good place to be  
Wasted days just come and go  
While everything we know  
Slowly dies before our eyes  
  
Ill fulfill your every desire  
Well run around together  
And set this world on fire  
Baby baby were free  
And you really oughta run with me  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Whoa Ill fulfill your every desire  
Well run around together  
And set this world on fire  
Baby baby were free  
And you really oughta run with me  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Yeah you really oughta run with me  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Oh you really oughta run with me  
Come on Baby ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Oh you really oughta run with me
