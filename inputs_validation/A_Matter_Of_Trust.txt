Some love is just a lie of the heart  
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start  
And they may not want it to end  
But it will its just a question of when  
Ive lived long enough to have learned  
The closer you get to the fire the more you get burned  
But that wont happen to us  
Because its always been a matter of trust  
  
I know youre an emotional girl  
It took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world  
I cant offer you proof  
But youre going to face a moment of truth  
Its hard when youre always afraid  
You just recover when another belief is betrayed  
So break my heart of you must  
Its a matter of trust  
  
You cant go the distance  
With too much resistance  
I know you have doubts  
But for Gods sake dont shut me out  
  
This time youve got nothing to lose  
You can take it you can leave it  
Whatever you choose  
I wont hold back anything  
And Ill walk away a fool or a king  
Some love is just a lie of the mind  
Its make believe until its only a matter of time  
And some might have learned to adjust  
But then it never was a matter of trust  
  
Im sure youre aware love  
Weve both had our share of  
Believing too long  
When the whole situation was wrong  
  
Some love is just a lie of the soul  
A constant battle for the ultimate state of control  
After youve heard lie upon lie  
There can hardly be a question of why  
Some love is just a lie of the heart  
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start  
But that cant happen to us  
Because its always been a matter of trust
