Little sleepy boy  
Do you know what time it is  
Well the hour of your bedtimes  
Long been past  
And though I know youre fighting it  
I can tell when you rub your eyes  
Youre fading fast  
Fading fast  
  
Wont you run come see St Judys Comet  
Roll across the skies  
And leave a spray of diamonds  
In its wake  
I long to see St Judys Comet  
Sparkle in your eyes  
When you awake  
  
Little boy  
Wont you lay your body down  
Little boy  
Wont you close your weary eyes  
Aint nothing flashing but the fireflies  
  
Well I sang it once  
And I sang it twice  
Im going to sing it three times more  
Going to stay til your resistance  
Is overcome  
Cause if I cant sing my boy to sleep  
Well it makes your famous daddy  
Look so dumb  
  
Wont you run come see St Judys Comet  
Roll across the skies  
And leave a spray of diamonds  
In its wake  
I long to see St Judys Comet  
Sparkle in your eyes  
When you awake  
  
Little boy little boy  
Wont you lay your body down  
Little boy little boy  
Wont you close your weary eyes  
Aint nothing flashing but the fireflies  
  
Oo Little sleepy boy  
Do you know what time it is  
Well the hour of your bedtimes  
Long been past  
Though I know youre fighting it  
I can tell when you rub your eyes  
That youre fading fast
