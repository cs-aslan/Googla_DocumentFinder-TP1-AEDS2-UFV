How can I make it through the day  
Without you  
You have been so much a part of me and if youll go  
Ill never know what to do  
  
How can I carry on my way  
The memories  
When all that is left is the pain in my history  
Why should I live my life today  
  
Refrain  
I cant live out on my own I cant do anything at all  
And just forget the love youve always shown  
And accept the fate of my condition  
Please dont ever go  
For I cannot live my life alone  
  
Chorus  
Say youll never go  
Say youll never go out my way  
Say youll never go  
For we can still go on  
And make it through  
Just say youll never go  
Say youll never go away  
  
How can I make my dreams come true  
Without you  
You were the one who gave love to me and dont you know  
Your are my fantasy  
  
Repeat Refrain  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Repeat Chorus
