Whats troubling Gus You sound demented  
Is it because someone talked and she told me  
He no longer thinks anything that moves  
And everything he sees is something to kill and eat  
whats troubling Gus Is it nothing goes quiet  
The whippoorwill at dusk  
whats troubling Gus Overhearing conversations  
But its because youre too either them or me  
Well its either them or its us anything that moves  
And everything you see is something to kill and eat  
whats troubling Gus Is it nothing goes quiet  
Is that whats troubling ya Gus The mere mention of the name  
Used to be enough to make every bird stop singing  
Is that whats troubling ya Gus No one is afraid enough  
whats troubling Gus Is it nothing goes quiet  
Is that whats troubling ya Gus The mere mention of the name  
Used to be enough to make every bird stop singing  
The whippoorwill at dusk tells you no one is afraid  
No one is afraid enough  
Is it afraid Or is it afraid enough  
Troubling Gus
