Sitting on a corner watching half the world go by  
Thinking something long the lines of whiskey and rye  
Rolling to the left rolling to my right  
Well anybody out there wanna help me  
Looking at a picture of the trouble and strife  
Even got a picture of the Queen  
Getting back to thinking bout the secrets of life  
Will I ever find another No its just a dream  
Walking round in circles oh I must have walked a mile  
Trying to imagine I was putting on my style  
Rolling to the left rolling to my right  
Cant you see Im going along the wrong lines  
Searching for the person with a shoulder to cry on  
Calling out to almost anyone  
Have you got a secondary bed I could lie on  
Youd better watch your step or youll be first in line  
Baby baby baby  
What the hell on earth is wrong with you  
Baby baby baby  
What the hell am I supposed to do  
Baby baby baby  
What the hell on earth is wrong with you  
Baby baby baby  
What the hell am I supposed to do  
Cutting back to visions taken from the silver screen  
Believing I was someone I had never been  
Rolling to my left rolling to my right  
Surprised the motion picture is in black and white  
Sitting here alone is how its gonna be  
Will my lucky star ever shine on me  
I guess its not a problem  
Thats the way its meant to be  
Oh its never been a problem  
Its never been a problem to me  
Baby baby baby  
What the hell on earth is wrong with you  
Baby baby baby  
What the hell am I supposed to do  
Baby baby baby  
What the hell on earth is wrong with you  
Baby baby baby  
What the hell am I supposed to do  
Woh oh oh baby baby baby  
What the hell on earth is wrong with you  
Baby baby baby  
What the hell am I supposed to do  
Woh oh oh baby baby baby
