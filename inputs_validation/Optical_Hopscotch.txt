Meet me at the market  
Where you bought me out  
Closely examine  
The contact point of the  
Opposing rams  
  
Now we are playing optical hopscotch  
  
Now we are over here  
Sketching the field of the spies  
  
Front me a coroners allotment  
Ill not fail to return  
An exact earth pinprick  
  
Now we are engaged in optical hopscotch  
  
Whats left of our vision  
Our swimming vision  
Of what division  
  
Look
