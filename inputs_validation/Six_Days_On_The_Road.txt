Six Days on the Road and Im gonna make it home tonight  
Well I pulled out of Pittsburgh headed down the eastern seaboard  
I got my deisel wound up and shes runnin like never before  
My hometowns commin in sight if you think Im happy your right  
Six Days on the Road and Im gonna make it home tonight  
Well it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye  
I could have a lot of women but Im not like some other guys  
I could have one to hold me tight  
But I could never make believe its alright  
Six Days on the Road and Im gonna make it home tonight  
Well the ICC is a checkin on down the line  
Im a little overweight and my log books way behind  
Nothin bothers me tonight I can dodge all the scales alright  
Six Days on the Road and Im gonna make it home tonight  
Got a ten forward gears and a Georgia overdrive  
Im takin little white pills and my eyes are open wide  
I just passed a Jimmy and White Ive been passin everything in sight  
Six Days on the Road and Im gonna make it home tonight  
Six Days on the Road and Im gonna make it home tonight
