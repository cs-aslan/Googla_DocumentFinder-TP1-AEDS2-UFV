Ive tried everything  
To get you off my mind  
Ive been running round  
Breaking things getting into fights  
  
Ooh ooh ooh Id try anything to get you off my mind  
  
We used to climb Primrose Hill  
When it was just the two of us  
We used to run up the stairs  
On the doubledecker bus  
And oh I cant do that anymore  
No it just reminds me of before  
  
Ive tried everything  
To get you off my mind  
Ive been running round  
Breaking things getting into fights  
I dont know what it takes  
Ooh I wish I didnt have to think of us  
Ive tried everything  
And everything is not enough  
  
I see a girl across the street  
On a sunny afternoon  
And if I look through halfclosed eyes  
She looks a bit like you  
Oh it just reminds me of before  
No I cant do that anymore  
  
Ive tried everything  
To get you off my mind  
Ive been running round  
Breaking things getting into fights  
I dont know what it takes  
Ooh I wish I didnt have to think of us  
Ive tried everything  
And everything is not enough  
  
All my days are messed up  
Cant break down cant break up  
Sleepless nights that never end  
I wish I could pretend  
Oh I cant do this anymore  
  
Ive tried everything  
To get you off my mind  
Ive been running round  
Breaking things getting into fights  
I dont know what it takes  
Ooh I wish I didnt have to think of us  
Ive tried everything  
And everything is not enough  
  
Ooh ooh ooh Anything anything baby to get you off my mind  
Ive tried everything  
And everything is not enough
