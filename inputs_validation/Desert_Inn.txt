I never meet her in the city  
But believe me she is pretty  
Sixhundredfifty miles away  
I meet my angel in the desert  
In the desert I can meet her  
Oh in the desert heat she makes me play  
  
Im not trying to be clever  
Im not getting there forever  
Only flying with the wind and thee  
Im not trying to be late  
Just becoming a slave  
Come on angel play the game  
  
Im not trying to be clever  
Im not getting there forever  
Wont fight with the window on me  
Im not trying to be late  
Just becoming a slave  
Come on angel play the game  
  
Shes never in the city  
But the woman shes pretty  
Sixhundredfifty miles away  
I meet my angel in the desert  
In the desert I can meet her  
In the desert heat she makes me pray  
  
There is a race in your face
