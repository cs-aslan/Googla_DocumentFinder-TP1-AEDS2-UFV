Is this a dream  
If it is  
Please dont wake me from this high  
Ive become comfortably numb  
Until you opened up my eyes  
To what its like  
When everythings right  
I cant believe  
  
You found me  
When no one else was lookin  
How did you know just where I would be  
Yeah you broke through  
All of my confusion  
The ups and the downs  
And you still didnt leave  
I guess that you saw what nobody could see  
You found me  
You found me  
  
So here we are  
Thats pretty far  
When you think of where weve been  
No going back  
Im fading out  
All that has faded me within  
Youre by my side  
Now everythings fine  
I cant believe  
  
You found me  
When no one else was lookin  
How did you know just where I would be  
Yeah you broke through  
All of my confusion  
The ups and the downs  
And you still didnt leave  
I guess that you saw what nobody could see  
You found me  
You found me  
  
And I was hiding  
Til you came along  
And showed me where I belong  
You found me  
You found me  
When no one else was lookin  
How did you know  
How did you know  
  
You found me  
When no one else was lookin  
How did you know just where I would be  
Yeah you broke through  
All of my confusion  
The ups and the downs  
And you still didnt leave  
I guess that you saw what nobody could see  
You found me  
  
You found me  
When no one else was lookin  
You found me  
How did you know just where I would be  
You broke through  
All of my confusion  
The ups and the downs  
And you still didnt leave  
I guess that you saw what nobody could see  
The good and the bad  
And the things in between  
You found me  
You found me
