If you could only see me  
And know exactly were I am  
You wouldnt want to be me  
Oh I can assure you of that  
  
Im not the guy to run with  
Cause Ill pull you off the line  
Ill break you and destroy you  
Give time  
  
Hes King Midas with a curse  
Hes king Midas in Reverse  
Hes King Midas with a curse  
Hes King Midas in Reverse  
  
Its plain to see its hopeless  
Goin on the way we are  
So even though I loose you  
Youll be better off by far  
  
Hes not the man to hold your trust  
Everything he touches turns to dust in his hands  
Nothing he can do is right hed even like to sleep at night but he cant  
  
All he touches turns to dust  
All he touches turns to dust  
All he touches turns to dust  
All he touches turns to dust  
  
I wish someone would find me  
And help me gain control  
Before I loose my reason  
And my soul  
  
Hes King Midas with a curse  
Hes King Midas in reverse  
Hes King Midas with a curse  
Hes king Midas in Reverse  
  
Hes King Midas with a curse  
all he touches turns to dust  
Hes Kind Midas in Reverse  
all he touches turns to dust  
Hes King Midas with a curse  
all he touches turns to dust  
Hes King Midas in Reverse
