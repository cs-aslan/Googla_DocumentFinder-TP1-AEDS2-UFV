Wanna grind on me  
Haters plotting so I keep my nine on me  
You cant stop em when them shells is popping  
Look good to the public eye your streets is watching  
At all times put it all on the line  
Without a care dreams of cream turn to nightmares

Your games amaze but a lot of ways many choices  
Cant sleep when I do I hear voices  
Speakin loud and clear wait till you come out this year  
So I listen back cause the street is missing that  
What a world we live in  
So cold Im shivering slipping  
Gotta work with what Im given shit  
Bitches is trifling hands out grabbin  
Niggas hating scheming and back stabbin  
Thats why they hang around you just to be seen  
Type to leave a gun fight wit a full magazine  
No blood not hit chamber aint warm  
What part of the game is this And whos side you on  
Cant be out for wealth and out for self wont work  
Find yourself tucked and surrounded by dirt  
In a verse I show the whole earth my work  
It got to get better because it cant get no worse  
  
Repeat 1  
Repeat 1
