I aint got nothin to hide  
My mind is an endless wire  
I got both feet on the ground  
I aint got no one for hire  
I aint got a thing to show  
My lines have all expired  
So dont go foolin around  
And set my wheels afire  
Down in the dark of a burnt out soul  
Theres a few good second hand dreams  
Deep in the dark of a heavenly night with you  
Down in the black of a bottomless hole  
Theres a few good second hand scenes  
Deep in the dark of the heavenly blue  
Where the sea runs green  
I aint got nothin to give  
My life is an endless climb  
My loves a paperback dream  
I dont have nothin but time  
I aint got a thing to show  
I dont know my own name  
So dont go foolin around  
And set my wheels afire  
Down in the dark of a burnt out soul  
Theres a few good second hand dreams  
Deep in the dark of a heavenly night with you  
Down in the black of a bottomless hole  
Theres a few good second hand scenes  
Deep in the dark of the heavenly blue  
Where the sea runs green  
I aint got nothin to hide  
My mind is an endless wire  
I got both feet on the ground  
I dont have no one for hire  
I aint got a thing to show  
My life is an endless dream  
My loves a paperback dream  
I aint got nothin but time
