You know  
Ive had a lot of things happen to me in my life  
And yet  
  
I dont spend much of my time  
Feelin sad  
I dont let anything turn my sunshine to rain  
I never have  
  
Well people have told me Im not worth the time of day  
Said I was over the hill  
And its been said that I always get in the way  
But nothin seemed to hurt me till
