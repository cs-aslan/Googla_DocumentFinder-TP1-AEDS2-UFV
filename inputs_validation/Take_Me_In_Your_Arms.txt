I know youre leavin me behind  
Im seein you darlin for the very last time  
Show a little tenderness before you go  
Please let me feel your embrace once more  
  
Take me in your arms and rock me rock me a little while  
We all must feel heartache sometimes  
Right now right now im feelin mine  
Ive tried my best to be strong but im not able  
Im like a helpless child left in a cradle  
Before you leave me behind let me feel happy one more time  
  
Take me in your arms and rock me rock me a little while  
Im losin you and my happiness  
My life is so dark i must confess  
Ill never never see your smiling face no more  
Ill never never hear your knock upon my door  
Before you leave me leave me behind  
Let me feel happy one more time  
  
Take me in your arms and rock me rock me a little while
