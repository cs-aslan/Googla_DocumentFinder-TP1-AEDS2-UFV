Tightslacked clad girls on the graveyard shift  
Neath the cement stroll  
Catch the midnight drift  
Cigar chewing Charlie  
In the newspaperness  
Grifting hothorse tips  
On whos running the best  
  
Chorus  
And Im blinded by the neon  
Dont try and change my tune  
Cause I thought I heard a saxophone  
Im drunk on the moon  
  
And the moons a silver slipper  
Its pouring champagne stars  
Broadways like a serpent  
Pulling shiny topdown cars  
Laramer is teeming  
With that undulating beat  
And some Bonneville is screaming  
Its way wilder down the street  
  
Chorus  
  
Hearts flutter and race  
The moons on the wane  
Tarts mutter their dream hopes  
The night will ordain  
Come schemers and dancers  
Cherry delight  
As a Clevelandbound Greyhound  
And it cuts through the night  
  
And Ive hawked all my yesterdays  
Dont try and change my tune  
Cause I thought I heard a saxophone  
Im drunk on the moon
