I love the story in your love song  
Building them castles in your mind  
Come down here looking for a feeling  
Someday I know youre gonna find  
  
I wanna lay down there beside you  
But first we ought to take some time  
Before I make love to your body  
I wanna make love to your mind  
  
I wanna feel good just like you do  
Feel good I havent  
Loved in quite some time  
Feel good I had some  
Phases that I been through  
Where Ive just loved and left behind  
  
Im just too tired of feeling guilty  
I dont wanna be unkind  
But before I make love to your body  
I wanna make love to your mind  
  
I wanna make love to your mind  
I wanna make love to your mind  
Before I make love to your body  
I wanna make love to your mind  
  
I wanna feel good just like you do  
I havent loved in quite some time  
Lord I had some funny phases  
That I been through no no  
Where Ive just loved and left behind  
  
Im just too tired of feeling guilty  
I dont really wanna be unkind  
But before I make love to your body  
I wanna make love to your mind  
  
To your mind to your mind  
To your mind to your mind  
To your mind  
  
I love the story in your love song  
Building them castles in your mind  
Come down here from somewhere  
Looking for a feeling  
Someday I know youre gonna find  
  
See I wanna lay down there beside you  
But first we ought to take some time time  
Before I make love to your body  
I wanna make love to your mind  
  
To your mind  
I wanna make love to your mind  
To your mind  
I wanna make love to your mind  
I wanna make love to your mind
