Way back when we started  
There was a part of me that knew  
One did every heartache and I would lose myself to you  
  
And I walked all night  
Watching the sun and city lights  
Thinking of you  
Wondering where I lose my mind  
  
After all Im excited that youre in my life again  
After all Im delighted  
To be back when we begin  
I believe that you can fall in love with me again  
And well both be standin tall after all  
  
Way back when we started  
There was a part of you that knew  
I was all that you wanted  
But only shadows fill the room  
I was lost all right  
Lost in the sleepless empty nights  
Dreamin of you  
And in those dreams you were mine  
  
After all reunited  
Yeah youre in my arms again  
After all Im delighted  
Cause our were lovers and were friends  
I believe that I can  
Fall in love with you again  
And Ill catch you when you fall  
After all  
  
I was lost alright  
Lost in the sleepless empty nights  
Dreamin of you  
And in those dreams you still mine  
  
After all Im excited that youre in my life again  
After all Im delighted  
To be back when we begin  
I believe that you can fall in love with me again  
Cuz I love you Ill catch you when you fall  
Oh were united and weve made it after all  
And well both be standing tall  
After all  
After all babe  
Oh after all  
After all  
After all
