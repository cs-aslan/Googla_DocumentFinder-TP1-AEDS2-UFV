La la la la  
Youre not only cuddly toy that was ever enjoyed by any boy  
Youre not the only choochoo train that was left out in the rain  
The day after Santa came  
Youre not the only cherry delight that was left out in the night  
And gave up without a fight  
Youre not the only cuddly toy that was ever enjoyed by any boy  
  
Youre not the kind of girl to tell your mother  
The kind of company you keep  
I never told you not to love no other  
You must of dreamed it in your sleep  
  
Youre not only cuddly toy that was ever enjoyed by any boy  
Youre not the only choochoo train that was left out in the rain  
The day after Santa came  
Youre not the only cherry delight that was left out in the night  
And gave up without a fight  
Youre not the only cuddly toy that was ever enjoyed by any boy
