They may say that were the best thing that could be  
They say it to you and they say it to me  
But to each other theyre insistin  
Something must be missin  
Things cant really be the way they seem to be  
  
They dont know love the way we do  
Theyve never loved someone like you  
  
Lady lady I never let them talk about you  
Lady lady cause youre mine  
Lady lady I jump up when they talk about you  
But so what Im gonna be your guy  
  
You can never win  
Once that stuff begins  
Cause when it starts it just never ends  
People start rumors about you  
But I wont ever doubt you  
Youre my best friend  
  
Let them be how they wanna be  
They cant stop you from loving me  
  
So you see I dont care what they say  
I dont care what they do  
Im the one who loves you  
Im the one you need Im the one  
  
A symphony plays when you are near  
And I love the music that I hear
