Your will not mine  
Your will not mine  
  
Be It done be it done in your time  
  
I tiptoe around your unlikely reasons  
I wish for something more  
Was I right in needing  
  
Say the time and place I will do it  
In the maze of your heart Ill be there  
  
Your will not mine  
Your will not mine  
  
Be It done be it done in your time  
  
Im chasing an empty argument  
You know Im spent  
I feel your love and it burns what I dont need  
  
Your will not mine  
Your will not mine  
  
Be It done be it done in your time  
  
Everthing that you do  
Youre the thought that just keeps me coming  
Back to you  
  
Everytime that I fall the love  
Is all that will keep me calm
