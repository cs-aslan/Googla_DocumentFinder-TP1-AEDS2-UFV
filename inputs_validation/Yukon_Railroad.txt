Here we go sailin low  
Bet your mom and pop baby will never know  
Were steppin by the river  
Where the woodchucks go  
Down by the Yukon Railroad  
  
When the sun come up we go down  
You can have your partner  
And youre foolin around  
Spendin my time on the open ground  
Down by the Yukon Railroad  
  
You can bring a bottle  
And well drink it on the track  
Baby never comin back  
Well I can just imagine  
About a hundred years ago  
Old Number 7  
Just a steamin on to heaven  
With its twenty cars a rockin in tow  
Bringin on the payroll  
  
Here comes the sun now were havin fun  
You and me together baby are number one  
I can feel another days just begun  
Thanks to the Yukon Railroad
