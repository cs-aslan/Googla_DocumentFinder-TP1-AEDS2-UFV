Please forget the words that I just blurted out  
It wasnt me it was a strange and creeping doubt  
It keeps rattling my cage  
Theres nothing in this world will keep it down  
  
Even though I might  
Even though I try  
I cant  
  
So many things that keep keep me underground  
So many words that I that I can never find  
  
If you give up on me now  
Ill be gutted like Ive never been before  
  
Even though I might  
Even though I try  
I cant
