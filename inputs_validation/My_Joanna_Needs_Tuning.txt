I was waiting for somebody  
This afternoon  
Hope that she remembered  
Our rendezvouz  
And when she didnt show  
Just like yesterday  
I do the last Ill find another way  
One night I saw the stranger  
Across the hall  
I knew he was the reason  
Why she didnt call  
I wish I had imagined  
Or dreamt the lot  
But the heart didnt choose  
The pain Ive got  
Now she turning me inside out  
Upside down  
And me heart is all a roundabout  
Spinnin round  
Shes turnin me inside out  
Inside out  
Shes turnin me inside out  
Inside out  
Now hes got all so melt  
With a diamond ring  
And she was thinking through  
Almost anything  
Shes like a shadow going up  
Seventh avenue  
But so what shes only going  
Where shes didnt to  
I just got one thing to say  
Just before I go  
Since he was the offender  
I want her to know  
Now my mind has got me the day  
Im watching to  
Ill never raise a thought  
Of what shed done
