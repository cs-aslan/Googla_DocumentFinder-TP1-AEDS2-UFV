If you were a bluebird youd be a sad one  
Id give you a true word  
But youve already had one  
If you were a bluebird  
  
Youd be crying  
Youd be flying home  
If you were a raindrop  
Youd shine like a rainbow  
  
And if you were a train stop  
The conductor would sing low  
If you were a raindrop  
Youd be falling  
Youd be calling home  
  
If you were a hotel  
Honey youd be a grand one  
But if you hit a slow spell  
Do you think you could stand one  
  
If you were a hotel  
Well Id lean on your doorbell  
Id call you my home  
If I was a highway  
  
Id stretch alongside you  
Id help you pass by ways  
That had dissatisfied you  
If I was a highway  
  
Well Id be stretchin  
Id be fetchin you home
