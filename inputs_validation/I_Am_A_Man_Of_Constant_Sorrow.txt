I am a man of constant sorrow  
Ive seen trouble all my day  
I bid farewell to old Kentucky  
The place where I was born and raised  
The place where he was born and raised   
  
For six long years Ive been in trouble  
No pleasures here on earth I found  
For in this world Im bound to ramble  
I have no friends to help me now  
He has no friends to help him now  
  
Its fare thee well my old lover  
I never expect to see you again  
For Im bound to ride that northern railroad  
Perhaps Ill die upon this train  
Perhaps hell die upon this train  
  
You can bury me in some deep valley  
For many years where I may lay  
Then you may learn to love another  
While I am sleeping in my grave  
While he is sleeping in his grave  
  
Maybe your friends think Im just a stranger  
My face youll never see no more  
But there is one promise that is given  
Ill meet you on Gods golden shore  
Hell meet you on Gods golden shore
