All the way home from Baltimore  
We couldnt find a seat  
Conductor says hes sorry for  
The blisters on our feet  
  
Comes ariding in a bus  
The high and the low  
Mommy daddy you and I  
Going on a trip  
  
And were not going home  
Mommy daddy you and I  
Driving keep driving  
Driving driving all night  
  
Sleeping on my daddys shoulder  
Drinking from a paper cup  
And Im wearing my grandfathers clothes  
And they say that up North it gets cold  
  
Crawling out of bed one night  
Walking in my sleep  
Were not the only family  
To take this little trip  
  
Driving all the way up  
Its thirty below  
Mommy daddy you and I  
Even little kids  
  
Getting ready to go  
Mommy daddyyou and I  
Chilly chillywilly  
Its colder the further we go  
  
Some are born to take advantage  
But saying it dont make it so  
So hold me and dont let me go  
Cause the sidewalks are covered with snow  
  
Hes speaking English now  
And hes smoothing out his clothes  
Hes Mr Button Down  
Hes leaving home  
  
Making changes day by day  
And we still aint got no plan  
How we gonna make our way  
In this foreign land  
  
Well well keep driving keep driving  
Driving with all of our might  
Changing still changing  
Changing the water of life  
  
Keep that little man a shining  
See how the tail can wag the dog  
And were all riding in this old bus  
And the driver is singing to us  
  
And were wearing out grandfathers clothes  
Cause we heard that up North it gets cold
