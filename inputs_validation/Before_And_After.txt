Love wont see my coming  
On a Sunday noon today  
Still dont believe were fading  
But now the world should wait  
  
And now youre finally listening  
To what I have to say  
Well the time is right  
And it is today  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Maybe we could talk about it  
And try to get it straight  
After all these years baby  
Maybe its too late  
  
But I really need to  
Have you by my side  
And thats the only feeling  
Baby I cant hide  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Well you arent listening  
I aint talking  
We aint getting nowhere  
  
I keep trying to get  
Through to you baby  
All you do is stare  
  
I dont want to see that  
I need you by my side  
Well I dont want to be your lover  
Babe I want to be your man  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Well now my storys over baby  
And I aint gonna tell it twice  
Well you better start listening  
Or get out of my life  
  
Or youre gonna be left out

Yeah before you get my loving babe  
Youll be too old
