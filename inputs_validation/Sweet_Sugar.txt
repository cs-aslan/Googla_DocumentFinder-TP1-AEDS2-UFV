over importance of money  
Ive no time for boring things  
Theres no religion  
That can make my heart sing no  
They call me up  
Say hey come on down  
Weve got credit salvation  
All over town  
And I can see it everywhere I go  
I can hear it on my radio  
They keep telling me its alright  
But theres one thing  
I dont need tonight  
Is their sweet sugar poison wine  
I dont need these things  
To make me feel fine  
Sweet sugar poison wine  
Just need your love girl every time  
We dont need these  
Pointless things  
We just need to mend  
Our broken wings  
Take a look a look  
Whats going down  
Weve gotta stop  
Before we hit the ground  
Yeah we can have it  
Dont you know  
Take part in their tv show  
Theyll keep telling us its alright  
But theres one thing  
I dont need tonight  
You cant fool me  
Its a waste of time  
Youre selling tears  
Down the credit card line yeah  
But giving up is not  
Their frame of mind  
Theyll find a way  
To break us in time  
Yeah I can meet you  
Everywhere I go  
And I can hear you on my radio  
You keep telling me its alright  
But theres one thing  
I dont need tonight  
Is your sweet sugar poison wine  
I dont need these things  
To make me feel fine  
Sweet sugar poison wine  
I just need your love girl every time  
Sweet sugar poison wine  
I dont need these things  
To make me feel fine  
Sweet sugar poison wine
