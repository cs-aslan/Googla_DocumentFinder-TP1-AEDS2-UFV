Uptown  
Its murder out in the street  
Uptown  
Its murder out in the street  
Thats where I found my mandarin plum  
Thats where youd be if you found one  
Where the nights are bright  
And joy is complete  
Keep my squeeze on green flower street  
Since may  
Theres trouble most every night  
Where once we danced our sweet routine  
It reeks of wine and kerosene  
Where the nights are bright  
And joy is complete  
Keep my squeeze on green flower street  
Theres a special place for lovers  
One we understand  
There where neon bends in daylight sky  
In that sunny room she soothes me  
Cools me with her fan  
Were drifting  
A thousand years roll by  
Lou chang  
Her brother hes burning with rage  
Lou chang  
Her brother hes burning with rage  
Id like to know whats on his mind  
He says hey buddy youre not my kind  
Where the nights are bright  
And joy is complete  
Keep my squeeze on green flower street
