A groan of tedium escapes me  
Startling the fearful  
Is this a test It has to be  
Otherwise I cant go on  
Draining patience drain vitality  
This paranoid paralyzed vampire acts a little old  
  
But Im still right here  
Giving blood keeping faith  
And Im still right here  
  
Wait it out  
Gonna wait it out  
Be patient wait it out  
  
If there were no rewards to reap  
No loving embrace to see me through  
This tedious path Ive chosen here  
I certainly wouldve walked away by now  
Gonna wait it out  
  
If there were no desire to heal  
The damaged and broken met along  
This tedious path Ive chosen here  
I certainly wouldve walked away by now  
  
And I still may sigh I still may  
  
Be patient  
I must keep reminding myself of this  
  
And if there were no rewards to reap  
No loving embrace to see me through  
This tedious path Ive chosen here  
I certainly wouldve walked away by now  
And I still may  
  
Gonna wait it out
