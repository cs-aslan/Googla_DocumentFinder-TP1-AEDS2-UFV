When people say youre not my kind  
And that your clothes are out of line  
And that your hair isnt combed all the time  
Youre not real pretty but youre mine  
  
We have a great big old society  
That wont make room for folks  
Like you and me  
But I got some real sad news  
For them my friend  
Theyre on the outside looking in  
  
Weve got a great thing going  
And its gonna keep right on growing  
And I hope that soon theyll see the light  
But until that time  
Theyll have to blow their mind  
Cause it aint us thats gonna lose this fight  
So when were walking I dont care  
When all those people stop and stare  
If theyd look in your eyes theyd see  
Youre not real pretty but you belong to me  
  
Hey hey hey now  
Hey hey hey now  
When youre lovin me baby  
And when I hold you baby  
When you kiss you  
I know you love me baby  
When I hold you  
You know Ill never leave you  
When I touch you  
I know Ill always love you  
Every day now  
You know I love you baby  
You know I love you baby
