The toy shop door is locked up tight  
And everything is quiet for the night  
When suddenly  
The clock strikes twelve  
The funs begun  
  
The dolls are in their best arrayed  
Theres going to be a wonderful parade  
Hark to the drum  
Oh here they come  
Cries everyone  
  
Hear them all cheering  
Now they are nearing  
Theres the captain stiff as starch  
Bayonets flashing  
Music is crashing  
As the wooden soldiers march  
Sabers aclinking  
Soldiers awinking  
At each little pretty maid  
  
Here they come here they come  
Here they come here they come  
Wooden soldiers on parade
