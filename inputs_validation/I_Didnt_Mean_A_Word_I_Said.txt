I didnt mean a word I said  
And if I hurt you Im sorry  
I didnt mean to lose my head  
And if made you cry Im sorry  
It was just another foolish quarrel  
Wont you end it with a kiss and  
Just remember this  
Except the time I said I love you  
I didnt mean a word I said  
I didnt mean a word I said  
  
I didnt mean a word I said  
And if I hurt you Im so so sorry so so so sorry  
I didnt mean to lose my head  
And if made you cry Im sorry  
It was just another foolish quarrel  
Wont you end it with a kiss and  
Just remember this  
Except the time I said I love you  
I didnt mean a word I said  
I didnt mean a word I said
