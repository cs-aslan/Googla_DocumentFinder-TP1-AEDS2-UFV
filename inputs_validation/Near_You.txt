Theres just one place for me near you  
Its like heaven to be near you  
Times when were apart  
I cant face my heart  
Say youll never stray  
More than just two lips away  
  
If my hours could be spent near you  
Id be more than content near you  
Make my life worthwhile  
By telling me that Ill  
Spend the rest of my days near you  
  
There is just one place for me Im happy when Im near you  
Its wonderful as heaven a special kind of heaven but only when Im near you  
Times when were apart I wonder how I can face my heart  
Say youll never stray  
More than just two lips away  
  
If my waking hours could be spent while near you  
I would be content wonderfully content just to be near you  
Make my life worthwhile  
By telling me that Ill  
Spend the rest of my days  
All of those happy happy days  
So near you
