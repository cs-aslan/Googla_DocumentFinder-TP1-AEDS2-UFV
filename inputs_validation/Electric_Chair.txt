I saw your friend 1st  
Thats who I danced with  
All the time I was watchin you  
  
The music rocked us  
Our eyes lockedthus  
Makin us see a trippy picture shoo  
  
If a man is considered guilty  
For what goes on in his mind  
Then give me the electric chair  
For all my future crimesoh  
  
You whispered something  
It took my mind out like a  
G flat major with an E in the bass  
Your face looked so good  
I wanted to touch your mouth  
My brain is jackin all over the place  
  
If a man is considered guilty  
For what goes on in his mind  
Then give me the electric chair  
For all my future crimesoh  
  
Lets take a drive love  
So we can make up our minds love  
To commit the crimes of passion  
That sets us free  
Me lovin you you lovin me me lovin you you lovin me  
  
The electric chair  
  
I saw your friend 1st  
Thats who I danced with  
All the time I was watchin you I was watchin you  
The music rocked us  
Our lives shocked us  
Makin us see a trippy picture shoo  
Ive got to have it

For what goes on in his mind  
Then give me the electric chair  
For all my future crimesoh

Guilty for all my future crimes  
And if ya dont really love me
