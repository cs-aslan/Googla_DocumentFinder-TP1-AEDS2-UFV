Shes my inspiration lady  
Inspiration everywhere  
Shes my inspiration lady  
She lights candles in the air  
In the warmth of a morning sun  
And at night when the day is done  
Shes my inspiration lady  
My anticipation lady  
Shes my situation every day  
  
Seems like every time I see her  
Shes got something on her mind  
When she tells the age old story  
Of a life she left behind  
In the warmth of the morning light  
She will turn and hold me tight  
Shes my inspiration lady  
Soft sad situation lady  
Shes my situation every day  
  
Seems like I will always love her  
Inspiration every day  
And I like to think hey maybe  
I can drive her blues away  
In the warmth of the morning sun  
And at night when the day is done  
Shes my inspiration lady  
Shes my kind reaction lady  
Shes my situation every day  
Shes my inspiration lady  
My anticipation lady  
Shes my inspiration all the way
