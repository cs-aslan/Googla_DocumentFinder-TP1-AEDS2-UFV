Baby lets make a date for a night on the town  
How does the turn of the century sound  
I guarantee that well have a good time  
New Years Eve 1999  
  
Now I know it sounds a bit premature  
But Im askin you now cause I want to be sure  
Do you have anything else in mind  
New Years Eve 1999  
  
Well drink pink champagne from a plastic cup  
Dance all night til the sun comes up  
Well say its been a pretty good century  
Except for that weekend in 93  
  
Then well go home to our warn winter bed  
And tuck in the kids with a kiss on the head  
And sing one more chorus of Auld Lang Syne  
New Years Eve 1999  
  
Ill be your sweetheart if youll be mine  
New Years Eve 1999 New Years Eve 1999
