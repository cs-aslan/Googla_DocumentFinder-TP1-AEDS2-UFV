Can you keep a secret  
Come on ohhhh  
These walls keep a secret  
That only we know  
But how long can they keep it  
Cause were two lovers who lose control  
Were two shadows chasing rainbows  
Behind closed windows  
Behind closed doors  
  
If walls could talkoh  
They would say I want you more  
They would say Hey never felt like  
This before  
And that you would always be the one for me  
Just two people making memories  
Too good to tell  
And these arms are never empty  
When were lying where we fall  
Were painting pictures making magic  
Taking chances  
Making love  
  
If walls could talkoh  
They would say I want you more  
They would say Hey never felt like  
This before  
And that you would always be the one for me  
  
If walls had eyes my  
They would see the love inside  
They would see me  
In your arms in ecstasy  
And with every move theyd know  
I love you so  
  
When Im feeling weak  
YOu give me wings  
When the fire has no heat  
You light it up again  
When I hear no violins  
You play my every string  
  
So stop the press  
Hold the news  
The secrets safe between me and you  
Walls can you keep a secret  
  
If calls could talk oh  
They would say I want you more  
They would say Hey never felt like  
This before  
And that you would always be  
The one for me  
  
If walls had eyes my  
They would see the love inside  
They would see me  
In your arms in ecstasy  
And with every move theyd know  
I love you so
