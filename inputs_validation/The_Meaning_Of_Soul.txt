I gotta show you bout the meaning of soul Im taking a love tonight  
Get outta my way I did what you say but that aint enough alright  
Im different bleach and an Armarni elite Im ten outta ten all night  
Get outta my way I did what you say but that aint enough alright  
  
All rise I see the love in your eyes  
If its all right then Ill be your light
