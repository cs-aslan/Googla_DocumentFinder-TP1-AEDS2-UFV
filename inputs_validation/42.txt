Those who are dead are not dead  
Theyre just living in my head  
And since I fell for that spell  
I am living there as well  
Oh  
  
Time is so short and Im sure  
There must be something more  
  
Those who are dead are not dead  
Theyre just living in my head oh  
And since I fell for that spell  
I am living there as well oh  
  
Time is so short and Im sure  
There must be something more  
  
You thought you might be a ghost  
You thought you might be a ghost  
You didnt get to heaven but you made it close  
You didnt get to heaven but you made it close  
  
You thought you might be a ghost  
You thought you might be a ghost  
You didnt get to heaven but you made it close  
You didnt get to heaven but you oh oh  
  
Oh oh  
  
Those who are dead are not dead  
Theyre just living in my head  
Oh
