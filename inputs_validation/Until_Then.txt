I I long for the moment  
When I see you again  
I long to touch and stroke your hair again  
Though my heart goes on beating not knowing when  
  
I I wait for the time  
I feel your hair once more through these hands of mine  
My heart will sing you know I will soar  
Just like before just like before  
  
Chorus  
Until then  
All Ill have is just a memory of you  
That I could hold on to  
Until then  
All Ill have is just this space and time  
To wait and think of you  
Coz youll be on my mind  
Until then until then  
  
I I wait for the time  
I feel your hair once more through these hands of mine  
I know that someday youll come back and stay  
  
Well be together once more  
Just like before  
  
Until then  
All Ill have is just a memory of you  
That I could hold on to  
Until then  
All Ill have is just this space and time  
To wait and think of you  
Coz youll be on my mind  
Until then  
  
Bridge  
I long for the moment  
I long for the time  
Ill take all my chances  
Until you are mine  
  
All Ill have is just a memory  
That I could hold on to  
Until then  
All Ill have is just this space and time  
To wait and think of you  
Coz youll be on my mind  
Until then  
Until then
