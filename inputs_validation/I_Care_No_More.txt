My love has gone my pride has gone I care no more  
My heart is tired from loving you I care no more  
I dont regret the day we met when love was there  
Now love has gone life lingers on I just dont care  
Love is a thing that is crazy for all no matter who  
I had my love but I lost it all when I lost you  
  
It never should have happened and it wont no more  
Love is a thing that is crazy for all no matter who  
I had my love but I lost it all when I lost you  
It never should have happened and it wont no more  
My love has gone my pride has gone I care no more care no more
