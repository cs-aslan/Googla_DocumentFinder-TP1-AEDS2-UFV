Dont run and hide from the people  
Dont run and hide them all  
Dont run and hide now cause youre only hurting yourself  
Ask me why and Ill tell you things that you never heard now  
Bout yourself what theyre saying I know that it will hurt you  
Please fight back its important how you accept their lies now  
If you run you condemn yourself and theyll realize now  
Then youll be hurtin me  
Cause Im left on my own and Ive got them to face  
Dont run and hide from the people  
Dont run and hide them all  
Dont run and hide now cause youre only hurting yourself

Be with me and well prove just how strong our love can be now  
Please fight back its important how you accept their lies now  
If you run you condemn yourself and theyll realize now  
Then youll be hurtin me  
Cause Im left on my own and Ive got them to face  
Dont run and hide from the people  
Dont run and hide them all  
Dont run and hide now cause youre only hurting yourself  
Dont run and hide from the people  
Dont run and hide from the people
