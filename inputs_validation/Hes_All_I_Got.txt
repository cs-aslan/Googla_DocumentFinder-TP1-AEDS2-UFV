Youre a girl that hates to see others happy  
Unless youre happy too  
So youve told the boy I love  
A lot of things that aint true  
  
And its wringing my heart  
Cause its making us drift apart  
So humbly I ask of you  
To undo the wrong that youve done  
  
Please go to him tell him  
Before he finds someone new  
Cause if I ever lose him  
I dont know what Ill do  
  
Cause hes all I got  
Built my world around him  
Since the day I found him  
  
Girl your selfishness causes unhappiness  
But why make it hard for me  
Since you been unhappy in love  
I guess misery loves company  
  
For once in your life  
Consider anothers feelings  
Confess the truth  
That youve been concealing  
  
Please go to him tell him  
Before he finds someone new  
Cause if I ever lose him  
I dont know what Ill do  
  
Cause hes all I got  
Built my world around him  
Since the day found him  
  
I would gladly go to him  
Instead of asking you  
But there might be a shadow of a doubt  
Your gossip might have been true  
  
So tearfully I ask of you  
Please undo the wrong that youve done  
Cause without his love  
I know I know I cant go on  
  
Please go to him tell him  
Before he finds someone new  
Cause if I ever lose him  
I dont know what Ill do  
  
Cause hes all I got  
Built my world around him  
Since the day found him  
Cant bear to lose him
