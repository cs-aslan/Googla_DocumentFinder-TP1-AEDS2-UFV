Hey you cuckoo  
See youre in the paper late today accused of something  
And your lips are closed to all of those who know shes missing  
Talk abounds she wont be found alive and thats a pity  
  
I read about all of these crimes When will it end  
Carry me through tomorrow guide me along the way  
Im tired of the insane running things  
And I wont stop tryin for change  
  
Seems the towns ablaze and TVs live to show its burning  
All the while the smiling juvenile is seeking mercy  
  
I see these crimes all of the time When will it end  
Carry me through tomorrow guide me along the way  
Im tired of the insane running things  
And I wont stop tryin for change  
  
We legislate and educate trying to find  
A way to fix the broken dream  
  
Carry me through tomorrow guide me along the way  
If this is the youth of tomorrow  
Im running the other way  
Carry me through tomorrow guide me along the way  
Im tired of the insane running things  
And I wont stop tryin for change
