Ill be lovin you long time  
Ill be lovin  
Ill be lovin  
Ill be lovin  
Ill be lovin  
Ill be lovin  
Ill be lovin  
Ill be lovin you  
Ill be lovin you  
  
You aint even gotta worry  
About a thing I gotcha babe  
And aint nobody takin me away  
Its not a game Im here to stay  
Our love is stronger than any drug  
Addictive just cant get enough  
And everytime Im with you  
I want some more  
Just close the door  
And lets explore each other  
  
Chorus  
Long as I know you got me  
Ill be loving you long time  
As I can be  
Ill be loving you long time  
Eternally  
Theres no stopping you and me  
Ill be loving you long time  
As I can breathe  
Ill be loving you long time  
Eternally  
  
Dont care what no one has to say  
They dont understand us like we do  
I need you near me night and day  
Together there aint nothin we cant do  
Scoop me up and we can go  
To that little spot where no one knows  
Spend a little time just us alone  
You can caress my body and never let go  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont want another  
Aint gon never be another  
Cant nobody do what you do to me  
Dont want another  
Aint gon never be another  
Cant nobody do what you do to me  
Dont want another  
Aint gon never be another  
Cant nobody do what you do to me  
  
Ill be loving you long time  
As I can be  
Ill be loving you long time  
Eternally  
Long as I know you got me  
Ill be loving you long time  
As I can be  
Ill be loving you long time  
Eternally  
Theres no stopping you and me  
Ill be loving you long time  
As I can be  
Ill be loving you long time  
  
Ill be lovin  
Ill be lovin  
Ill be lovin  
Ill be lovin  
Ill be lovin  
Ill be lovin you
