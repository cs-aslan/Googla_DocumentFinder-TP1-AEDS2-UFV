Love me love me say you love me  
Just for fun  
Softly sigh it try it try it  
Just for fun  
If youre close to me maybe youll agree  
Here at hand that magic land were seeking constantly  
Tingle tingle when we mingle  
Just for fun  
Lets pretend well never end  
What weve begun  
For if we play at love we may stay in love  
Then youll be glad you tried it just for fun  
Tingle tingle when we mingle  
Just for fun  
Lets pretend well never end  
What weve begun  
For if we play at love we may stay in love  
Then youll be glad you tried it just for fun
