Any fool must surely know  
You plant a seed and it will grow  
But only if you tend it well  
Its as the wise men so do tell  
The end will justify the means  
And all the riches of your dreams  
But dont be tempted on the way  
Its as the wise men so do say  
Like trees children change  
As they twist and turn  
You suffer alone for the peace that you yearn  
You can weep and moan feel the need to run  
But youre leaving behind a loaded gun
