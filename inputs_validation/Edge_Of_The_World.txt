Can I swallow the soil  
Make it all beautiful  
Can I carry it carry it carry it now  
  
The truth cant bare the sunlight  
Youre afraid for the day it does  
Hell when I told you so  
I got burn burn burned again  
  
Heaven forbid that my heart is forsaken  
Hope in the end truth prevails  
  
Im gonna run to the edge of the world run to the edge of the world  
Feel that Im gonna get home if I try  
Im gonna run to the edge of the world run to the edge of the world  
Need to find my way home home  
  
He earns fire as a god  
But I believed in your heart  
And Im leaving you leaving you leaving you now  
  
The truth cant bare the sunlight  
And dont pretend to be my guide  
Heard you said youd change it over  
But I got burn burn burned instead  
  
Heaven can wait cause my soul is forsaken  
Hope in the end truth prevails  
  
Im gonna run to the edge of the world run to the edge of the world  
Feel that Im gonna get home if I try  
Im gonna run to the edge of the world run to the edge of the world  
Need to find my way home home  
  
Just to fall out no more rain  
Once upon a time
