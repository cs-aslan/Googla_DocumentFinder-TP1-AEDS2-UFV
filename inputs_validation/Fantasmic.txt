Wish upon a star  
Take a step enter the land  
Walk through the air  
Take my hand  
Wishmasters will  
Join him the quest for dream  
A makebelieve  
Is all we ever need  
Wish upon a star  
No matter who you are  
The second star to the right  
Harbingers gate  
Beyond the boundaries  
Blossom ballet  
In the great wide somewhere  
Wish upon a star  
Believe in will  
The realm of the king of fantasy  
The master of the talelike lore  
The way to kingdom I adore  
Where the warriors heart is pure  
Where the stories will come true  
  
A cub of the king betrayed by usurper  
A girl in the rain swearing to her fathers name  
Belle the last sight for the dying gruesome  
The beauties sleeping awaiting  
Deep in a dream  
For true loves first kiss  
  
Bald Mountain Night  
Devilheart endures but light  
A mad aerial dance  
Chernabogs succubi  
Black Cauldron born  
Gurgis heart forlorn  
Pigkeeper or hero  
On a quest of augury  
Maleficents fury  
The spindle so luring  
Dragon fight dying night  
Dooming might  
Apprentice of Yen Sid  
Conducting the galaxy  
Dreamer on mountaintop  
Spellbound masquerade  
The Sailor an idol for the sixyearold in me  
The Phoenix of White Agony Creek  
Enchantress A mermaid in a tale as old as time  
A Dragonslayer The Awakener  
Wish upon a star
