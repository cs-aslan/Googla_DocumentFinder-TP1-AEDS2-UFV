Questioningly  
Her eyes looked at me  
And then she spoke  
Arent you some one I used to know  
And werent we lovers a long time ago  
Looked at her close  
Forced her into view  
Yes I said youre a girl  
That I once may have knew  
But I dont love you anymore  
What do you want to talk to me for  
You should have just let me walk by  
Memories make us cry  
  
In the morning Im at work on time  
My boss he tells me  
That Im doing fine  
When Im going home  
Whiskey bottle  
Movie on TV  
Memories make me cry  
And Im alone  
Just me  
Just me  
Questioningly  
  
But I dont love you anymore  
Why do you want to talk to me for  
You should have just let me walk by  
Memories make us cry  
  
Looked at her close  
Forced her into view  
Yes I said  
Youre a girl  
That I once may have knew  
  
Questioningly  
Her eyes looked at me  
And then she spoke  
Arent you someone that I used to know  
And werent we lovers a long time ago
