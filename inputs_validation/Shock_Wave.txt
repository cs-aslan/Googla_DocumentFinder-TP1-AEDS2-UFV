Theres no reason for you to run  
You cant escape the fate of the chosen one  
Black moon rising in a blood red sky  
This time you realise that youre gonna die  
  
Drinking your blood brew is your answer  
Thats what you plan to do  
No dreaming time you cheat this master  
Youre on your own going through  
  
Wind of mist has taken over your mind  
And you think youre on your own  
Dont believe you are the only one here  
Look around youre not alone  
  
Feel the forces from another world  
Ghostly shadows fill your mind  
Evil power hanging over you  
As you freeze youre like a child  
Look behind you  
  
Somebodys calling  
Someone is near  
Feel yourself falling  
Falling with fear  
You tell yourself youre dreaming  
You realise youre screaming  
You know that this shouldnt happen to you  
You tell yourself that its scary too  
But there is nothing you can do oh  
  
Ghostly shadows from the other world  
Evil forces in your mind  
Trapped between the worlds of life and death  
Frozen in the realms of time  
Look behind you  
  
You feel yourself falling youre at the end of the line  
Your body is crawling but your senses are blind  
Cold cold feelings are running through your brains  
Ice cold fingers running through your veins
