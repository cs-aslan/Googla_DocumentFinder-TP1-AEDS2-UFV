This is a story bout livin  
A tale of a long hard road  
Aint a whole lot of misgivins  
Of the things that I thought I sowed  
My daddy was a real hard worker  
He said son there will come a day  
Talk aint always cheap  
And heres what daddy had to say  
With these hands Ive made my livin  
With these hands Ive held a child  
With these hands Ive climbed a mountain  
Sometimes we forget  
We aint much different at all  
  
He likes grits you like the apple  
There aint nothin wrong with that  
He says yall you say yous  
It all depends on where youre at  
Well a little bit of music is a whole lot of fun  
And its always good for the soul  
From New York City out to California  
You know its only rock and roll  
  
With these hands we come together  
With these hands we can change the world  
With these hands I play my music  
Sometimes we forget  
We aint much different at all  
  
Oh not at all  
So what Im trying to tell you  
Is that Im only one son of the south  
Its gonna take more than you me and you  
To work this whole thing out  
  
With these hands Ive made my livin  
With these hands Ive held a child  
With these hands Ive climbed a mountain  
Sometimes we forget  
  
With these hands we come together  
With these hands we can change the world  
With these hands I play my music  
Sometimes we forget  
We aint much different  
We aint much different  
Aint much different  
At all
