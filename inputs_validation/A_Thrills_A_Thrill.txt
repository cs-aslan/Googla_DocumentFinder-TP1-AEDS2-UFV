Take a hard look around you babe  
There aint nobody got it made  
So you can live in your head  
Or you can live in your heart  
But if you dont live at all  
Then why the hell did you start   
Thrills a thrill  
I said a thrills a thrill  
Even in paradise  
A thrills a thrill  
Now the young boys are all hanging out in the bars  
Old men they dont have to cruise all night in cars  
And those young girls love the smell of flowers  
Old women love to play with them for hours  
Gays are straight   
And straights are weird  
The bis just call  
Everybody dear  
You know a thrills a thrill  
I said a thrills a thrill  
Even in paradise  
I said a thrills a thrill  
Down to get up   
Yeah up to get down  
Oh I will try anything  
If it makes my head go round  
Leather whips  
And fingertips  
I know a boy who is growing growing  
A thrills a thrill  
A thrills a thrill  
Even in paradise  
I said a thrills a thrill  
Take a hard look around you baby  
Aint nobody got it made  
You can live in your head  
You can live in your heart  
And if you dont live at all  
Then why the hell did you start   
A thrills a thrill  
A thrills a thrill  
Even in paradise  
I said a thrills a thrill  
I said a thrills a thrill  
I said a thrills a thrill  
A thrills
