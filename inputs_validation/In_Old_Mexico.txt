Now Im sure youre all aware that this week is national gallbladder week
so as sort of an educational feature at this point I thought I would acquaint
you with some of the results of my rece  
Searches into the career of the late doctor samuel gall inventor of the gall
bladder which certainly ranks as one of the more important technological
advances since the invention of the joybu  
And the dribbleglass doctor galls faith in his invention was so
dramatically vindicated last year as you no doubt recall when for the first
time in history in a nationwide poll the gall  
Er was voted among the top ten organs his educational career began
interestingly enough in agricultural school where he majored in animal
husbandry until they caught him at it one day  
Whereupon he switched to the field of medicine in which field he also won
renown as the inventor of gargling which prior to that time had been
practiced only furtively by a remote tribe in the  
Who passed the secret down from father to son as part of their oral tradition
he soon became a specialist specializing in diseases of the rich he was
therefore able to retire at an early age  
The land we all dream about sunny mexico of course the last part of which is
completely irrelevant as with the whole thing I guess except its a rather
sneaky way of getting into this next  
Of popular song which is one of those things about that magic and romantic
land south of the border  
When its fiesta time in guadalajara  
Then I long to be back once again  
In old mexico  
Where we lived for today  
Never giving a thought to tomara  
To the strumming of guitars  
In a hundred grubby bars  
I would whisper te amo  
The mariachis would serenade  
And they would not shut up till they were paid  
We ate we drank and we were merry  
And we got typhoid and dysentery  
But best of all we went to the plaza de toros  
Now whenever I start feeling morose  
I revive by recalling that scene  
And names like belmonte dominguin and manolete  
If I live to a hundred and eighty  
I shall never forget what they mean  
for there is surely nothing more beautiful in this  
World than the sight of a lone man facing singlehandedly  
A half a ton of angry pot roast  
Out came the matador  
Who must have been potted or  
Slightly insane but who looked rather bored  
Then the picadors of course  
Each one on his horse  
I shouted ole evry time one was gored  
I cheered at the bandilleros display  
As they stuck the bull in their own clever way  
For I hadnt had so much fun since the day  
My brothers dog rover  
Got run over  
rover was killed by a pontiac and it was done with  
Such grace and artistry that the witnesses awarded the  
Driver both ears and the tail  but I digress  
The moment had come  
I swallowed my gum  
We knew thered be blood on the sand pretty soon  
The crowd held its breath  
Hoping that death  
Would brighten an otherwise dull afternoon  
At last the matador did what we wanted him to  
He raised his sword and his aim was true  
In that moment of truth I suddenly knew  
That someone had stolen my wallet  
Now its fiesta time in akron ohio  
But its back to old guadalajara Im longing to go  
Far away from the strikes of the af of l and cio  
How I wish I could get back  
To the land of the wetback  
And forget the alamo  
In old mexico ole
