Legs up to her shoulders  
All the way back down  
Shes not playin she knows what shes doin  
And the words out on the town  
She want to be a cheerleader  
A cheerleader  
She got the moves  
  
She got the grooves  
All the boys need her  
  
Oh oh thats the way she wants to be  
Cruisin the touch line at a quarter to three  
See her  she want to be a cheerleader  
  
Now shes gettin bolder  
Now she gets around  
Shes not takin no for an answer  
Shes not getting down  
  
Shes a no teaser  
A no pleaser  
She got the drive  
She got the jive  
Shes a big squeezer  
  
Oh oh thats all she wants to be  
Shake a little tush for the boys to see  
Want to be her  a cheerleader  
But what she wants the most  
To be the perfect host  
She wants to play the field all over  
  
She needs it most of all  
When its too close to call  
She wants to rock and roll all over  
Yes all over  
  
Legs up to her shoulders  
All the way back down  
Shes not playin she knows what shes doin  
The words out on the town  
  
She want to be a cheerleader  
A cheerleader  
She got the moves  
She got the grooves  
All the boys need her  
  
Oh oh thats all she wants to be  
Shake a little tush for the boys to see  
Want to be her  a cheerleader  
  
Oh oh thats all she wants to be  
Cruisin the touch line at a quarter to three  
See her  she want to be a cheerleader  
  
See her want to be a cheerleader
