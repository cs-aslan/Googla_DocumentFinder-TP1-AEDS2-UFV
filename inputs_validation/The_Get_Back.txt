Intro  
Who wanna bet us that they cant fuck wit us  
Stack cheddar forever live treacherous solely etceteras  
Til the death of us me and my confidents  
We shine we make the ambiance you niggas just rhyme  
  
You lil niggas need guidance you barkin up the wrong trees  
Pissin on the wrong hydrants Im a high fence  
I grew up round violence you grew up playin violins  
In yo hood silence where Im from silence  
  
Verse  
They just killed this vibe they just killed this vibe  
Theres something bout killing shit that makes us feel alive  
We feed off yo energy we see you on that Kenny G  
Just do in yo own harm do yo thing my nig  
Whenever you will not keep to that mighty nyc  
We gon check that name you claim  
Bring yo job and id  
We take it the wrong way all gold everything  
One gold watch two gold chains give me all those everything  
Yall dont wanna pump heads ocho Evelyn  
Them boys will leave you butt naked  
And the mall closed and everything  
The streets is watchin aksin if you gon reply to them  
Seem like yall woke up sleeping giants Eli and Em  
  
Hook  
A major comeback but from a minor setback  
But still they know we livin was thinkin bout to get back  
The get back the get back the get back the get back  
The get back the get back the get back the get back  
I crack a smile knowing God has a day for me  
Until that day comes I slay these niggas faithfully  
The get back the get back the get back the get back  
The get back the get back the get back the get back  
  
Verse  
Im like Nino with the uzzi back of the motorcycle head  
Until youre back at them Italians who killed Keisha at the wedding  
Im like dope boy lookin for Rickys killer  
One last soldier niggas who turn they backs on me  
Turn yo punk ass over  
Yall smoke my smoked my cousin Harold  
Now Im in a Camaro  
Love and happiness playing me and my dog with a double barrel  
38 40 belows live or die motherfucker  
Im Pac ride or miss riverside motherfucker  
Get back everybody better get back  
To my niggas in the jet black  
For the seats let back on yo jet back  
If youre a gambling man you could bet that  
Its a sure thing not just a New York thing  
A rich or a poor thing  
Its a lace yo boots pull yo draw string who wanna go to war thing  
Its a who gon protect your thing  
Who really wanted morphine  
Put legends in coffins  
Its a bullet holes in the door thing  
Its a nobody sure things  
Street cold not a Lord thing  
Its kids that wasnt taught things old ladies like poor thing  
Poor thing to get back is important  
Poor thing for the dead homies we pour pain  
Like what you sayin while its cocked back to em  
Guess what goes around comes around got back to em  
  
Hook  
A major comeback but from a minor setback  
But still they know we livin was thinkin bout to get back  
The get back the get back the get back the get back  
The get back the get back the get back the get back  
I crack a smile knowing God has a day for me  
Until that day comes I slay these niggas faithfully  
The get back the get back the get back the get back  
The get back the get back the get back the get back
