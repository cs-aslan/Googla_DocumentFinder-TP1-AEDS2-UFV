Youve been coming  
Youve made it easy  
Youve said just the thing  
  
Now I cant hold on  
To these words  
Dont mean that much to me  
Feel out in the cold  
No one to turn to  
  
Its my sunset  
My suns set  
  
Never thought its come to this  
Now it seems the only way to do it right  
Never thought itd come to this  
Just cant hold on oh no  
  
Feel out in the cold  
No one to turn to  
Theres no way out  
Just cant hold on  
  
Its my sunset  
My sun will set  
  
Ive been gone gone gone  
Cant hold on
