I dont care who you are baby  
Dont care about all the friends that you know  
And why you chose me  
Lord sweet mama dont want to know  
Cant tie me down baby  
Dont bring me down  
Chains cant hold me I gotta go  
  
I dont want your money baby  
Dont care for your fancy clothes  
And how you people live together  
I say lord in heaven only knows  
  
Cant tie me down people  
Dont bring me down  
Oh the man cant stop me I gotta go  
Gonna hit that road  
Buy me some coke  
  
You can take all your charm baby  
Yea sweet daddy knows where it goes  
Yes it does  
You can tell your big sister thanks a lot for the hole  
  
Cant tie me down baby  
Dont bring me down  
Chains cant hold me I gotta go  
Gonna hit that road  
I gotta go dont hold me baby
