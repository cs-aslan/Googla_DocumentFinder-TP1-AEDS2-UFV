I have dreams for you and me  
And wishes that will last  
And live beyond eternity  
  
Summers gone winters on  
Can we weather everything  
Our eyes have yet to see  
  
As the years go by  
I promise you that I  
  
I will be the one to run to  
When the nights are long  
Ill be there when winds begin to blow  
Even when it seems that everything is going wrong  
  
This I swear  
I swear  
I wont be the one to let go  
  
Life gets tough  
Ooh  
Roads get rough  
Ooh  
  
Who knows what awaits us round the bend  
Count on me faithfully  
Though everything we have could never end  
It could never end  
  
And through rain or shine  
And every cloudy sky  
  
I will be the one to run to  
When the nights are long  
Ill be there when winds begin to blow  
Even when it seems that everything is going wrong  
  
This I swear  
This I swear  
I wont be the one to let go  
Ill be there  
Ill be there  
Anytime you need me youll know where I am  
  
youll know just where I am and everywhere  
Everywhere  
Anytime youre lost just turn around  
Just turn around  
  
And take my hand and  
I will be your light in the night  
And I promise that even when it seems  
That everything is going wrong  
  
This I swear  
This I swear  
I wont be the one  
To let go  
To let go  
  
This I swear  
I swear  
I wont be the one to let go  
To let  
Go
