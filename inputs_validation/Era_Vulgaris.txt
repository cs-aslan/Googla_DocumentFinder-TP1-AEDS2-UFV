I play a game til Im dead  
Or on a magazine  
I wanna look like Im dead  
Dancing on a string  
I eat the food when its there  
Make a mess of things  
Get that look everywhere  
But keep that look off my face  
  
Everybody else wanna fall in love  
Theres no room for love in a modern sky  
Living in the era vulgaris  
Just drool in the dark  
As you stare at the lights  
  
From a crumbling tower I see everything  
London Tokyo New York City  
Theres no love any place  
  
Everybody else wanna fall in love  
Theres no room for love in a modern sky  
Living in the era vulgaris  
Just drool in the dark  
As you stare at the lights  
  
All we creatures helplessly attacking repetition  
Over over left with who we are  
Did you tell anyone  
Did you tell any place  
  
Everybody else wanna fall in love  
Theres no room for love in a modern sky  
Living in the era vulgaris  
Just drool in the dark  
As you stare at the lights  
  
Living in the era vulgaris  
Just drool in the dark  
As you stare at the lights  
  
Just stare at the lights
