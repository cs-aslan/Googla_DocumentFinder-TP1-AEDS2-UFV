The book of love is long and boring  
No one can lift the damn thing  
Its full of charts and facts and figures  
And instructions for dancing  
  
But I  
I love it when you read to me  
And you  
You can read me anything  
The book of love has music in it  
In fact thats where music comes from  
Some of it is just transcendental  
Some of it is just really dumb  
  
But I  
I love it when you sing to me  
And you  
You can sing me anything  
The book of love is long and boring  
And written very long ago  
Its full of flowers and heartshaped boxes  
And things were all too young to know  
  
But I  
I love it when you give me things  
And you  
You ought to give me wedding rings  
And I  
I love it when you give me things  
And you  
You ought to give me wedding rings  
And I  
I love it when you give me things  
And you  
You ought to give me wedding rings  
You ought to give me wedding rings
