Oh let me go let me go let me go lover  
Let me be set me free from your spell  
You made me weak cut me deep I cant sleep lover  
I was cursed from the first day I fell  
Oh you dont want me but you want me to go on wanting you  
How I pray that you will say that were through  
Oh turn me loose whats the use  
Let me go lover let me go let me go let me go  
  
Oh you dont want me but you want me to go on wanting you  
How I pray that you will say that were through  
Oh turn me loose whats the use  
Let me go lover let me go let me go let me go  
  
Oh let me go let me go let me go lover  
Let me be set me free from your spell  
You made me weak cut me deep I cant sleep lover  
I was cursed from the first day I fell  
Oh you dont want me but you want me to go on wanting you  
How I pray that you will say that were through  
Oh turn me loose whats the use  
Let me go lover let me go let me go let me go
