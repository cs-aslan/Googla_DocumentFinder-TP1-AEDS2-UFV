At this time of night when the crowds have passed  
Were the last to leave we need some company  
No need to look so shy dont even wonder why  
You know the reason that we need this company  
Ive been sitting here looking out for you  
Someone just like me whos maybe had a drink or two  
  
Chorus  
I dont want another drink or fight  
I want a lover  
I dont care whether its wrong or right  
I want a lover tonight  
Tonight  
  
Outside the dawn is breaking looks like its started raining  
Well catch a cab and soon be driving home  
No need to look so shy dont even wonder why  
Youll know the reason just as soon as we get home  
Youve been sitting there wondering what to do  
Ive been standing here waiting to make the first move  
  
Chorus x2  
  
This anticipation is a stimulation  
No need for conversation as were driving home  
Put your arms around me it doesnt mean you love me  
Just that you want me and you need my company  
Driving through the night its so exciting  
Turning off the light without another thought tonight  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I want you I want your love I want a lover  
I want you I want your love I want a lover  
I want you I want your love I want a lover I want your love tonight  
Oh
