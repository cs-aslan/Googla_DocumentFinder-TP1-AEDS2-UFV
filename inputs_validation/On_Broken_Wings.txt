Little Jeanie cried she believed in all his lies  
So much for being good oh  
Johnny did not rest he did what he thought was best  
He did the best he could  
Dont try to see the world in different ways  
Those moments and all those days  
Dont let them faint away  
  
On Broken Wings  
I guess thats how youll have to fly  
Two broken hearts  
Across the sky  
  
Now hes feeling bad  
His heart is cold its oh so sad  
Somehow he did her wrong yeaheah  
Little Jeanies heart  
Is melting fast oh so fast  
Now she feels so strong  
Dont try to see the world in different ways  
Those moments and all those days  
Dont let them faint away  
  
On Broken Wings  
I guess thats how youll have to fly  
Two broken hearts  
Across the sky  
  
Dont try to see the world in different ways  
Those moments and all those days  
Dont let them faint away  
  
On Broken Wings  
I guess thats how you have to fly  
Two broken hearts  
Across the sky  
  
On Broken Wings  
I guess thats how youll have to fly  
Two broken hearts  
Across the sky  
  
On Broken Wings  
I guess thats how how you have to fly  
Two broken hearts  
Across the sky
