Two pieces of drama the hammers bout to fall  
Two pieces of drama theres gunplay in the hall  
Make peace with your momma the consequence is dire  
Two pieces of drama boy you know not to play with fire  
He rocks a big blue  cable a ping pong table for a ring  
Hes mentally unstable to him murder it aint no thing  
Hell do you dirty style hes holding dirty vile  
Hes out pumping on the corner trying to stay warm and keep it cool like
Miles  
He keeps it fundamental  
Hes got the jeans and the bubblegoose on  
Theres murder on his mental  
Hes got the deuce deuce in his palm  
And yall know the fable how Cain did Abel  
Ever since the beginning the world keeps spinning just like a turntable  
Two pieces of drama the hammers bout to fall  
Two pieces of drama theres gunplay in the hall  
Make peace with your momma the consequence is dire  
Two pieces of drama boy you know not to play with fire  
La la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la la la la  
When its selling out back likes to pump crack  
To the fiends that be getting high  
He keeps a hand on the pump hes ready to dump  
On any chump that would even try  
He got a finger on the trigger he aint scared to pull it  
Head full of liquor boy you might catch a bullet  
The hoes in the stable and drugs on the table  
Everybodys sittin round watchin cops on the cable  
Dressed like a slob keeps his hair braided  
Hes never been robbed hes only been raided  
Hes never known joy the boy is so jaded  
Hes never been loved hes only been hated  
His souls on ice his heart is stone  
Just another dead king rotting on his throne  
With a pain that would cut you down to the bone  
Youre born alone boy you die alone  
Two pieces of drama the hammers bout to fall  
Two pieces of drama theres gunplay in the hall  
Make peace with your momma the consequence is dire  
Two pieces of drama boy you know not to play with fire  
Two pieces of drama the hammers bout to fall  
Two pieces of drama theres gunplay in the hall  
Make peace with your momma the consequence is dire  
Two pieces of drama boy you know not to play with fire
