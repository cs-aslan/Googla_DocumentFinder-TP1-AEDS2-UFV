Intro Gucci Mane  
I wanna thank God  
For opportunity success  
Wealth and health  
  
Verse 1 Gucci Mane  
My daddy name Gucci he the Gucci Mane  
Honestly he turned me on to the ice game  
He fed the fam with 3 tops thats the current game  
Well fuck you who are you  
You aint God mane  
I fell out with my right hand man he tried to top on me  
I guess its clear we aint homies like I think we homies  
Im at the top and I swear to God its really lonely  
But Im not coming down no stoopin down I keep it movin  
These young niggas got no respect who make music  
Broke ass nigga never can get used to it  
And the bottom of some valley dont do it like the top do it  
Roll the crisp we hear aks more than church music  
  
Hook  
I hit this car horse on the car with the top off it  
Topless broads drivin Gucci chargin with no problem  
Hit shot dead in the bushes with his head off  
Head cut off those slick blood knocked off

Mob ties put a head in your bed horse head  
You touch Guwop and they goin mine and wrap yo head  
I got so much overhead I gave him diamond bricks instead  
And I chumm without a charm diamond chain and watch instead  
Team some team

Cooking dope instead of eggs  
Hundred pts in my fridge
