My name is Donald White you see  
I stand before you all  
I was judged by you a murderer  
And the hangmans knot must fall  
I will die upon the gallows pole  
When the moon is shining clear  
And these are my final words  
That you will ever hear  
  
I left my home in Kansas  
When I was very young  
I landed in the old Northwest  
Seattle Washington  
Although Id atraveled many miles  
I never made a friend  
For I could never get along in life  
With people that I met  
  
If I had some education  
To give me a decent start  
I might have been a doctor or  
A master in the arts  
But I used my hands for stealing  
When I was very young  
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells  
Thats how my life begun  
  
Oh the inmates and the prisoners  
I found they were my kind  
And it was there inside the bars  
I found my peace of mind  
But the jails they were too crowded  
Institutions overflowed  
So they turned me loose to walk upon  
Lifes hurried tangled road  
  
And theres danger on the ocean  
Where the salt sea waves split high  
And theres danger on the battlefield  
Where the shells of bullets fly  
And theres danger in this open world  
Where men strive to be free  
And for me the greatest danger  
Was in society  
  
So I asked them to send me back  
To the institution home  
But they said they were too crowded  
For me they had no room  
I got down on my knees and begged  
Oh please put me away  
But they would not listen to my plea  
Or nothing I would say  
  
And so it was on Christmas eve  
In the year of 59  
It was on that night I killed a man  
I did not try to hide  
The jury found me guilty  
And I wont disagree  
For I knew that it would happen  
If I wasnt put away  
  
And Im glad Ive had no parents  
To care for me or cry  
For now they will never know  
The horrible death I die  
And Im also glad Ive had no friends  
To see me in disgrace  
For theyll never see that hangmans hood  
Wrap around my face  
  
Farewell unto the old north woods  
Of which I used to roam  
Farewell unto the crowded bars  
Of whichve been my home  
Farewell to all you people  
Who think the worst of me  
I guess youll feel much better when  
Im on that hanging tree  
  
But theres just one question  
Before they kill me dead  
Im wondering just how much  
To you I really said  
Concerning all the boys that come  
Down a road like me  
Are they enemies or victims  
Of your society
