By frank zappa as performed by nazareth  
Said dont it ever get lonesome  
Dont it ever get sad when you go out on the road  
No dont it ever get lonesome  
Dont it ever get sad when you come here to seattle  
On a four day show of the tour  
And you got nothing but groupies and promotors to love you  
And a pile of laundry by the hotel door  
Dont it ever get lonesome  
Dont it ever make a young man blue  
Dont it ever get lonesome  
Dont it ever make a young man where hell just wanna go back home  
When the pa system eats it  
And the band plays some of the most terriblest shit youve ever known  
Dont you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there  
Dont you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there  
Dont you better get a shot when you find out what the  
Road ladies do to you  
I swear someday I aint never  
Im never gonna go out on the road again  
I swear someday I aint never never never never  
Never never never never never never  
Gonna roam the country side  
No more  
Im gonna hang up them ol holiday inns dude  
And watchin someone do it on the floor  
Dont you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there  
Dont you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there  
Dont you better get a shot when you find out what the  
Road ladies do to you  
What the road ladies do to you
