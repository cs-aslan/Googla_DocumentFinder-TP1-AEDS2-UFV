Well I never got my license to live  
They wont give it up  
So I stand at the worlds edge  
  
Im trying to break in  
Oh I know its not for me  
And the sight of it all  
Makes me sad and ill  
Thats when I want Some Weird Sin  
  
Things get too straight  
I cant bear it  
I feel stuck stuck on a pin  
  
Im trying to break in  
Oh I know its not for me  
But the sight of it all  
Makes me sad and ill  
Thats when I want  
Some Weird Sin  
Thats when I want  
Some Weird Sin  
Just to relax with  
  
Yeah some dumb weird sin  
For a while anyway  
With my head on the ledge  
Thats what you get out on the edge  
Some Weird Sin  
  
Things get too straight  
I cant bear it  
I feel stuck stuck on a pin  
  
Im trying to break in  
Oh I know its not for me  
When the sight of it all  
Makes me sad and ill  
Thats when I want  
Some Weird Sin  
Thats when I want  
Some Weird Sin  
Just to relax with  
  
Thats some dumb weird sin  
For a while anyway  
With my head out on the ledge  
Thats what you get out on the edge  
Some Weird sin  
  
Some weird sin Some weird sin
