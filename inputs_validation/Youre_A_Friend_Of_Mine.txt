Striking out  
Well count me in  
Im gonna stand right by your side through thick or thin  
Aint no doubt  
Gonna win  
A walk through hell aint bad compared to where weve been  
  
Oh you can depend on me  
Over and overover and over  
Know that I intend to be  
The one who who always makes you laugh until you cry  
And you can call on me until the day you die  
  
Years may come and go  
Heres one thing I know  
All my life  
Youre a friend of mine  
  
That argument  
I cant forget  
We fought so hard I dont think Ive recovered yet  
The girls we knew  
Who thought you were cool  
I never introduced my favorite ones to you  
  
Oh you can depend on me  
Over and overover and over  
Know that I intend to be  
The one who who always makes you laugh until you cry  
And you can call on me until the day you die  
  
Years may come and go  
Heres one thing I know  
All my life  
Youre a friend of mine  
  
Oh you can depend on me  
Over and overover and over  
Know that I intend to be  
The one who who always makes you laugh until you cry  
And you can call on me until the day you die  
  
Years may come and go  
Heres one thing I know  
All my life  
Youre a friend of mine  
  
Oh you can depend on me  
Ill be fine  
Cause youre a friend of mine  
Yeeaah  
Ill be fine  
Cause youre a friend of mine
