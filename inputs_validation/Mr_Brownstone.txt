I get up around seven  
Get outta bed around nine  
And I dont worry about nothin no  
Cause worryins a waste of my time  
  
The show usually starts around seven  
We go on stage at nine  
Get on the bus at eleven  
Sippin a drink and feelin fine  
  
We been dancin with  
Mr Brownstone  
Hes been knockin  
He wont leave me alone  
  
I used ta do a little but a little wouldnt do  
So the little got more and more  
I just keep tryin ta get a little better  
Said a little better than before  
I used ta do a little but a little wouldnt do  
So the little got more and more  
I just keep tryin ta get a little better  
Said a little better than before  
  
We been dancin with  
Mr Brownstone  
Hes been knockin  
He wont leave me alone  
  
Now I get up around whenever  
I used ta get up on time  
But that old man hes a real muthafucker  
Gonna kick him on down the line
