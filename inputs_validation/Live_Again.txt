Intro DRoc  
I know what you go through  
From me to you I love you  
  
Verse 1 DRoc  
From the nigga to the baller never satisfied  
So the money got you doing shit thatll fuck up your pride  
You aint a hoe you just really trying to get by  
Every day looking up at the sky  
Sometimes shit get so hard  
It really have you bothered  
First you sigh then you cry  
Up a whole puddle of water  
Seem like this shit wont ever end  
Merry go rounds to the whirlwinds  
Waves turn to a hurricane  
If you see joy you got to see pain  
Shit in the world aint gonna ever change  
Even when you die itll be the same  
Now you due to them circumstances  
Jars arent counted so your forced to dance  
Hoping and praying for a second chance  
Just wanna put back on your pants  
Walk out the club and throw up your hands  
Tired of being disrespected by her man  
Think this shit aint right for you  
Niggaz been yellin all night for you  
Got in your mind whats best for you  
Walk up to the club to tell them your through  
  
Chorus Adam Levine  
Shes stuck off in this little room  
With nothing left to hold onto  
Her life is in a little box  
Shes wondering will it ever stop  
The life of a stripper  
  
Hook Girl  
Im so sick and Im so tired  
Of these clubs I keep crying  
Every night I wipe my eyes  
Cause these years pass me by  
I give up Im all in  
My whole life is full of sin  
This road is a dead end  
I wanna live again  
  
DRoc  
From the part where a child is torn from a mothers umbilical cord  
No one really enforces that lifes gonna be hard  
Which is kinda left up to the teachers  
And the teachers leave it up to the preachers  
the preachers aint fillin up the bleachers  
Its the rappers  
Sad aint it  
  
Verse 2 Kane  
It was this girl named Star pretty fine little woman  
Going to college taking off her clothes for money  
She gotta pay the rent she got a little girl  
Her baby daddy aint shit See what she dealin with  
But she gotta hold on hold on  
Wanna leave the club alone you dead wrong  
She gotta pay the bills but in the meantime  
She like fuck how she feel living is real  
So she back in the club again  
Taking off her clothes again  
Going to school going to work getting tiring  
Lack of sleep but baby gotta eat  
and these shoes on her feet  
She got a test next week so she stressed  
Ask god to give her a blessing send her in the right direction  
Her parents died when she was eight years old  
And after that she felt like she was all alone  
But she got her grandparents and they raised her well  
Keep going to school take care of yourself  
Getting hard going to school and work in the club  
And at the same time looking for love  
She cant keep skipping for an occupation  
In a minute shell be graduating  
Make her wanna throw up her hands  
Now she only wanna live again
