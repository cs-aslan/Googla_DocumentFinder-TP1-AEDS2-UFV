Dont know quite what to say havent seen you in seven ages  
Can you tell that its me or is my picture on torn out pages  
  
Chorus  
  
And you think its real but its just another future deal  
And you know youre right cause youve waited for it all night  
Then you find yourself sitting on a little shelf  
  
Dont know quite what to do Ive been acting my life in phases  
Is it really true that theyre keeping us locked in cages  
  
Rock maker
