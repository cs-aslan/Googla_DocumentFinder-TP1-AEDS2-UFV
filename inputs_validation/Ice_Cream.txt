Hey mom can I have some money

Watch these rap niggaz get all up in your guts  
Frenchvanilla butterpecan chocolatedeluxe  
Even caramel sundaes is gettin touched  
And scooped in my ice cream truck Wu tears it up  
The ice cream man is coming  
  
Yo honeydips summertime fine Jheri drippin  
See you on Pickens with a bunch of chickens how youre clickin

She rocked rope honey throat smellin like Impulse  
Your whole shell babys wicked like Nimrod  
Caught me like a freshwater scrod or may I not be God  
Attitude is very rude Boo crabby like seafood  
It turns me on like Vassey and Lahrule  
They call me Starky Lovehun check the strategy  
By any means Shirley Temple cross was done by Billie Jeans  
Black Misses America your name is Erica right true  
Lazy eyeball small piece six shoe  
Caramel complexion breath smellin like cinnamon  
Excuse me hon the Don mean no harm turn around again
