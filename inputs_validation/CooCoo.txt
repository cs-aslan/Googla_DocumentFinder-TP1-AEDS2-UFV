Oh the cuckoo shes a pretty bird and she warbles when she flies  
But she never hollers cuckoo till the fourth day of July  
  
Said Jack oDiamonds well Jack oDiamonds well I know you of old  
Honey you robbed me of my silver and out of all my gold  
All of my gold all of my gold  
  
Well Jack oDiamonds oh Jack oDiamonds oh I know you of old  
Honey you robbed me of my silver and out of all my gold  
  
Said the cuckoo shes a cruel bird and she warbles when she flies  
And every time that she passes my true love says goodbye  
Well says goodbye well says goodbye  
Ooh ooh ooh whoo ooh
