I got a brain in left hand drive  
I dont asleep other side  
I ride a bullet like Im Steve McQueen  
Each town I intervene  
A gram of keef and the barn is jumping  
Its alright we got time  
Got a radio hit in mind  
Cant see am I blind  
  
Every night and day  
In the USAI DELETE MYSELF  
  
Got to know you gene by gene  
Youre my jellybean  
Get out the shower  
And Im force 15  
Im dead Im clean  
Fatboy and the barn is jumping  
Its alright its just tight  
  
GOT to GET into A better Business  
DEEP down Happiness
