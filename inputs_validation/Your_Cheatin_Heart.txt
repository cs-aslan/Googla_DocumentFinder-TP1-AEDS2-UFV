Your cheatin heart will make you weep  
Youll cry and cry and try to sleep  
But sleep wont come the whole night through  
Your cheatin heart will tell on you  
  
When tears come down like falling rain  
Youll toss around and call my name  
Youll walk the floor the way I do  
Your cheatin heart will tell on you  
  
When tears come down like falling rain  
Youll toss around and call my name  
Youll walk the floor the way I do  
Your cheatin heart will tell on you
