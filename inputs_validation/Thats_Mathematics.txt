Counting sheep  
When youre trying to sleep  
Being fair  
When theres something to share  
Being neat  
When youre folding a sheet  
Thats mathematics  
  
When a ball  
Bounces off of a wall  
When you cook  
From a recipe book  
When you know  
How much money you owe  
Thats mathematics  
  
How much gold can you hold in an elephants ear  
When its noon on the moon then what time is it here  
If you could count for a year would you get to infinity  
Or somewhere in that vicinity  
  
When you choose  
How much postage to use  
When you know  
Whats the chance it will snow  
When you bet  
And you end up in debt  
Oh try as you may  
You just cant get away  
From mathematics  
  
Andrew Wiles gently smiles  
Does his thing and voila  
QED we agree  
And we all shout hurrah  
As he confirms what Fermat  
Jotted down in that margin  
Which couldve used some enlargin  
  
Tap your feet  
Keepin time to a beat  
Of a song  
While youre singing along  
Harmonize  
With the rest of the guys  
Yes try as you may  
You just cant get away  
From mathematics
