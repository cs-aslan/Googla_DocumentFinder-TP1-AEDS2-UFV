Sorrows child sits by the river  
Sorrows child hears not the water  
Sorrows child sits by the river  
Sorrows child hears not the water  
And just when it seems as though  
Youve got strength enough to stand  
Sorrows child all weak and strange  
Stands waiting at your hand  
  
Sorrows child steps in the water  
Sorrows child you follow after  
Sorrows child wades in deeper  
Sorrows child invites you under  
And just when you thought as though  
All your tears were wept and done  
Sorrows child grieves not what has passed  
But all the past still yet to come  
Sorrows child sits by the water  
Sorrows child your arms enfold her  
Sorrows child youre loathe to befriend her  
Sorrows child but in sorrow surrender  
And just when is seems as though  
All your tears were at an end  
Sorrows child lifts up her hand  
And she brings it down again
