What a friend we have in time  
Gives us children makes us wine  
Tells us what to take or leave behind  
  
And the gifts of growing old  
Are the stories to be told  
Of the feelings more precious than gold  
  
Friends I will remember you think of you  
Pray for you  
And when another day is through  
Ill still be friends with you  
  
Babies days are never long  
Mothers laugh is babys song  
Gives us all the hope to carry on  
Friends I will remember you think of you  
Pray for you  
And when another day is through  
Ill still be friends with you  
  
Friends I will remember you  
Think of you pray for you  
And when another day is through  
Ill still be Friends with You  
  
Friends I will remember you  
Think of you pray for you  
And when another day is through  
Ill still be Friends with You
