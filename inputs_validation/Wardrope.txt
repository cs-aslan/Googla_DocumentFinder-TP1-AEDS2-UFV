Tell me baby  
where did you sleep last night  
  
I heard noises in the cupboard were you trying to hide  
Because you should know  
How much I hate this  
If you were Ill hit your hiding place  
Until sunrise  
And Im falling in love  
And Im falling in love  
Cause I need your loving  
Everyday and every night  
And Im falling in love  
Tell me baby where did you sleep last night  
I heard noises in the cupboard were you trying to hide  
Because you should know  
How much I hate this  
If you were Ill hit your hiding place  
Until sunrise  
And Im falling in love  
And Im falling in love  
Cause I need your loving  
Everyday and every night  
And Im falling in love
