At the Bama Breeze  
You can shoot some pool down there  
You can act a fool down there  
You can play it cool down there  
  
At the Bama Breeze  
You can drink some beer down there  
Argue laugh and cheer down there  
Pass another year down there  
  
Jimmy got caught smokin a joint  
Out behind the bar sittin in his car  
And they took him to jail  
The tip jar paid his bail  
  
In 1984 Mick Jagger passed through town  
Bought the house a round  
Signed his name on the wall  
In the Ladies bathroom stall yeah  
  
At the Bama Breeze  
I turned 21 down there  
Had too much fun down there  
Stumbled out with the sun down there  
  
Saturday night the Bouncer Grady  
Lets the ladies in free with the fake ID  
And the short enough skirt  
Yeah figures what the hell could it hurt  
  
Second set the owner Lulu gets up with the band  
A beer in her hand and sings Freebird slow  
Then she raises a toast heres to Ronnie and the boys  
Now everybody make some noise  
  
At the Bama Breeze  
Youre one of our own down there  
You never drink alone down there  
Good God I feel at home down there  
  
At the Bama Breeze  
Youre one of our own down there  
You never drink alone down there  
Good God I feel at home down there
