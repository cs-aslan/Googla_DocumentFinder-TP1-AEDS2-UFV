The disciples were assembled  
In the upper room  
They didnt know that Jesus  
Would be leaving very soon  
They talked about His kingdom  
As they readied for the feast  
Who would be the greatest  
And who would be the least  
One said if theres a greatest  
I hope Im the one  
Others talked of miracles  
They had seen and done  
No one noticed Jesus  
As He rose up from His seat  
Till knelt before them  
And began to wash there feet  
Chorus  
Ive come to serve you  
Ive come to serve you  
And if you know my Fathers love  
The way you say you do  
Then you will serve each other too  
I wish I could have been there  
To see the look each mans face  
A single act of service  
Puts us all back in our place  
But though were called to minister  
And do miracles in His name  
Remember when youre sent by Him  
The reason that He came  
Chorus  
Chorus  
Yes you should serve each other too
