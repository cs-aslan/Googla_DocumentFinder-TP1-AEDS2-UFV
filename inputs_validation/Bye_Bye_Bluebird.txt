Bye bye bluebird bye bye bluebird  
You were lots of fun to know  
But I have to let you go  
Bye bye bluebird bye bye bluebird  
Youre the flyin saucer kind  
In and out and hard to find  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird

When you came I flipped my lid  
I never thought Id lose you kid  
Bye bye bluebird

Though we were a perfect pair  
It was a flightbynight affair  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Oh I should have clipped your wings  
Im not gonna do these things  
Bye bye bluebird

If you ever should be near

Bye bye bluebird

Call me when youre short of dough  
Or maybe just to say hello  
Bye bye bluebird

Its nice to know we had our way  
Bye bye bluebird
