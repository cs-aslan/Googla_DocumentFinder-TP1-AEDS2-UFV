Why must I be the thief  
Why must I be the thief  
Oh Lord please wont you tell me  
Why must I be the thief  
  
Why must I be the thief  
He said to the hanging man  
And how come youre the only one  
Thats black around that always stares  
  
Why must I be the thief  
He asked of the hanging man  
And how come youre the only one  
Who lived with an open hand  
Now why must I be the thief  
Youve cursed with many clouds  
And the hanging man without his hand  
Looked beyond his heart  
  
The thief was drawn to the cross  
To share that others fate  
But the Jesus man said Not now  
My brother not now its far too late  
far too late 7x  
  
Do what you must  
Take what you can  
Steal the pride from every heart  
Every angered man 3x  
I am the thief  
I am the thief  
And you will run  
Yes and you will hide  
But Ill get you then  
Yes I will  
Because of you because its justified  
I will get you yet  
Cause its justified  
I will get you yet  
Its justified  
I will get you yet  
Its justified
