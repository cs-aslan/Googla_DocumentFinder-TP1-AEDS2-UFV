Chorus  
Im blowin good yeah I smoke it by the song  
And when them niggas call I dont pick up my phone  
Niggas acting like broads make me pick up my tone  
I had a lil time so I wrote a lil song  
Yeah this ones for you fuck niggas fuck niggas  
Yeah Im talkin bout them fuck niggas fuck niggas  
Yeah this ones for you fuck niggas fuck niggas  
Yeah Im talkin bout them fuck niggas them fuck niggas  
Yeah this ones for you  
  
Im high as Southwest Jizzle when your flight land  
I dont know bitch I might fly to england  
Hit the highway with the change yeah the change man  
I dun it my way with them thangs changed the game plan  
Had these niggas tellin lies they just sound true  
Nigga if you had it like that I wouldve found you  
Im tryna cash out a hundred let me get a buck  
Bitch theyll be just like you nigga fake as fuck  
Get em home and they probably all sheet rock  
They sellin bullshit fuckin up the street stock  
You living mine and yours thats a double dip  
That synthetic ass shit we call it double whip  
And nigga nothing beat the cross but the double cross  
I ran the streets and rap bitch Imma double boss  
Them niggas cashed out one I sent a double off  
They knocked him off halfway I took a double loss  
  
Chorus  
  
Lets put these niggas on the stand now stand up and be a man  
Raise your hand and swear you werent my number one fan  
And Im still that same nigga you still that same nigga  
But at the same time Im starting to get bad vibes  
What I owe you sumthin nigga thats what you act like  
I aint like them other niggas boy you betta act right  
The first few years of your deal ride your training wheels  
And then you graduate and live how real niggas live  
And I aint dissin naw I aint dissin  
But when you sit back and listen this what the rap games is missin  
Im used to thug niggas its too many young niggas with  
Too much of liquor too many drugs in em too many clicks too much swag

Too many niggas wearing tight shirts and skinnies walking round with they ass

Yall betta cash out gon put your cash up  
Because Im all in and if I dont win nigga Imma mask up  
  
Chorus  
  
Hardest part of life niggas cant play they role  
Everybody wanna ride the train dont wanna pay the toll  
Keep it going young boy you on a role  
Hoe nigga magazine you the centerfold  
You can check the resume nigga Im good as gold  
Lawn chair ass niggas all they do is fold  
Nigga you talkin with emotions you emotional  
You might can get a lil light feelin promotional  
Tell me what cha see when you lookin in the mirror  
Look as this hoe as nigga I couldnt said it clearer  
And you the same nigga that started up this jewelry game  
And when you see him nowadays the nigga jewelry lame  
Aint got it by now nigga you aint got it  
And why you talkin like that cause bitch you aint bout it  
And nigga how ya doin now worst then before  
And bitch we winning over here Ive been keeping score
