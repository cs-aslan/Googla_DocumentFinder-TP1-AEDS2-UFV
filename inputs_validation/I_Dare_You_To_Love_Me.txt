Youve been on my mind  
I grow fonder every day  
Lose myself in time  
Just thinking of your face  
But God only knows  
Why its taken me so long to let my doubts go  
Youre the only one that I want  
  
I dont know why Im scared  
Ive been here before  
Every feeling  
Every word  
Ive imagined it all  
You never know if you never try  
To forgive your past  
And simply be mine  
  
I dare you to let me be oh  
Your one and only  
I promise Im worthy  
To hold in your arms  
So come on and give me a chance  
To prove I am the one who can  
Walk that mile  
Until the end starts  
  
If Ive been on your mind  
You hang on every word I say  
Lose yourself in time  
At the mention of my name  
Will I ever know  
How it feels to hold you close  
And have you tell me  
Which ever road I choose you go  
  
I dont know why Im scared  
Ive been here before  
Every feeling  
Every word  
Ive imagined it all  
You never know if you never try  
To forgive your past  
And simply be mine  
  
I dare you to let me be your  
Your one and only  
I promise Im worthy  
To hold in your arms  
So come on and give me a chance  
To prove I am the one who can  
Walk that mile  
Until the end starts  
  
I know it aint easy  
Giving up your heart  
I know it aint easy  
Giving up your heart  
Nobodys perfect  
Just because trust me Ive earned it  
  
I dare you to let me be oh  
Your one and only  
I promise Im worthy  
To hold in your arms  
So come on and give me a chance  
To prove I am the one who has  
Walked that mile  
Until the end starts  
  
Come on and give me the chance  
To prove I am the one who can  
Walk that mile  
Until the end starts
