There once was a time when I was dead inside  
I cussed the Lord for the day I was born  
And prayed to the Devil to die  
Just when I thought the Devil had won  
Someone opened up the door  
The King of kings  
Lord of lords  
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor  
  
Chorus  
Now he broke the chains that bound me and now Im free  
Today Im right where Mama  
Prayed Id be  
Im down on my knees  
Now I believe  
What Mama knew for sure  
Hes King of kings  
Lord of lords  
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor  
  
Now if youre in trouble friend let me tell you what to do  
Ill tell you what hes done for me  
And I know what hell do for you  
It makes no difference what youve done  
Youve a friend in the One that I adore  
The King of kings  
Lord of lords  
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor  
  
Chorus  
  
Hes King of kings  
Lord of lords  
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor
