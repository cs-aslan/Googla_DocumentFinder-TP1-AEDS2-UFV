She got fingernails like knives  
She got twentyfour karat eyes  
She wants everything she sees  
Shell drop you to your knees  
She aint gonna change her wicked ways  
Ill love her till my dying day  
She got poison heart  
Painted smile  
She always has a girlfriend  
  
She knows the devil  
She knows the devil  
She knows the devil  
And the devil knows me  
She knows the devil  
She knows the devil  
She knows the devil  
And the devil knows me  
Whoa whoa whoa  
  
Bad little girl with a vermin tongue  
Ooh she loves to have her fun  
The daughter of Mephistopheles  
She loves to aim and she aims to please  
Shell take any young god and burn him down  
Hell see whos the queen and whos the clown  
She got lips that bleed  
Shes what I need  
I want her for my girlfriend  
  
She knows the devil  
She knows the devil  
She knows the devil  
And the devil knows me  
She knows the devil  
She knows the devil  
She knows the devil  
And the devil knows me  
Whoa whoa whoa  
  
She wants everything she sees  
Shell drop you to your knees  
She aint gonna change her wicked ways  
Ill love her till my dying day  
She got poison heart  
Painted smile  
She always brings a girlfriend  
  
She knows the devil  
She knows the devil  
She knows the devil  
And the devil knows me  
She knows the devil  
She knows the devil  
She knows the devil  
And the devil knows me  
Whoa whoa whoa  
  
Whoa whoa whoa  
She knows the devil  
Whoa whoa whoa  
She knows the devil
