Ah Its just another wasted mornin  
While Im holdin up the wall  
Too much tequila makes me wonder  
Why Im headin home at all  
Get that honky tonk feelin  
  
Every time your arms grow cold  
I suppose thats the reason  
I need a home away from home  
So Ill say one more time  
And I hope youll understand  
If I cant find it in your arms babe  
  
Im gonna find it where I can  
I cant refuse them lonely women  
Lord I know just how they feel  
I suppose thats the reason  
What you been givin me makes me feel  
Honey Im gettin that honky tonk feelin  
  
Every time your arms grow cold  
And I suppose thats the reason  
I need a home away from home  
So Ill say it one more time one more time  
And I hope youll understand  
If I cant find it in your arms babe  
  
Im gonna find it where I can  
If I cant find it in your arms babe  
Im gonna find it where I can
