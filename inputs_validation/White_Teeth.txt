White teeth white teeth  
  
Talent is rugged determination  
Skill is a little more dull  
Genius buggers straight conversation  
Makes sure that its ass is full  
  
So good looking people dont write no poetry  
Theyre too busy holding their hands  
You dont go to beach for depth of thought  
If your brains leaking grains of sand  
  
Cos white teeth are uglier than yellow teeth  
False gums never make plans  
Little stones hold big stories underneath  
But the big stones go to the dance  
The big stones go to the dance  
  
When model puts pen to paper  
Paper tends to turn to stone  
Cause original thoughts so hard to squeeze  
From a face so easy to clone  
  
So good looking people dont write no poetry  
Theyre too busy holding their hands  
You dont go to beach for depth of thought  
If your brains leaking grains of sand  
  
Cos white teeth are uglier than yellow teeth  
False gums never make plans  
Little stones hold big stories underneath  
But the big stones go to the dance  
The big stones go to the dance  
  
Whilst the dedicated cancelled the dates on their latest tour  
Cause genius had played that route ten times before  
Hardwork made the excuse of being too hardcore  
Yes dont fire shots from double barrel if you know youre single bore  
  
Cos white teeth are uglier than yellow teeth  
False gums never make plans  
Little stones hold big stories underneath  
But the big stones go to the dance  
The big stones go to the dance  
The big stones go to the dance  
The big stones go to the dance
