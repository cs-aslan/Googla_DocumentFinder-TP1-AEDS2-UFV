Some say its wrong some say its right  
Some say its politicians playing both sides  
Some say its greed some say its change  
Some say its all just the price well have to pay  
  
And I feel a storm coming in  
And I see the earth bending in the wind  
  
Its gonna rain yeah  
Wash it all away yeah  
And it aint gonna stop  
No it aint gonna stop  
For forty days  
  
Some say its fate some say its chance  
Some say its the blood of our fathers on our hands  
Some say its a lie some say its the truth  
Some say its all coming down on me and you  
  
And I see a fire in the sky  
And I hear the thunder out on the edge of night  
  
Its gonna rain yeah  
Wash it all away yeah  
And it aint gonna stop  
No it aint gonna stop  
For forty days  
  
Some say the stars will fall down from heaven  
Some say the angels will cry and ask us why  
  
Its gonna rain yeah  
Its gonna rain  
Oh its gonna rain  
Its gonna rain rain rain yeah  
Wash it all away  
Its gonna rain for forty days  
Its gonna rain for forty days  
Its gonna rain for forty days  
Its gonna rain for forty days  
Its gonna rain  
Its gonna rain  
Its gonna rain  
Its gonna rain
