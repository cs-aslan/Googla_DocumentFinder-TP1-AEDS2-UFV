Time to burn it all away time to think of what to say  
Time to go right back to yesterday  
Time for movements in the past time for something that wont last  
Not just fire quick and die off fast  
Things are never what they seem  
Im stuck inside of someone elses dream  
Problems never go away  
Im sick of being caught in yesterday  
Every day its still the same different faces different names  
But still stuck here playing these stupid games  
Maybe soon Ill figure out what giving up is all about  
My heart is filled so full of doubt  
Dont turn around dont look ahead  
I wont listen to all the lies Im fed  
Dont have to listen to you  
So dont you fucking tell me what to do
