Come with me and lets go for a ride  
Follow me to the other side  
As I sit around and watch you pout  
  
Cause I know that youre the  
Best thing in town  Best thing around  
Best thing in town  Best thing around  
  
Running wild and always running free  
Doing things that I have never seen  
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds  
  
Now I know that youre the  
Best thing in town  Best thing around  
Best thing in town  Best thing around  
  
Im seeing faces  
Of mysterys of the earth  
I am not one   
To the aspersions of my birth  
Or go to stance  
Of hallucinations I cant find  
A missing piece  
Of a thought thats in my mind  
  
Come with me and lets go for a ride  
Follow me to the other side  
As I sit around and watch you pout  
  
Cause I know that youre the  
Best thing in town  Best thing around  
Best thing in town  Best thing around  
  
Running wild and always running free  
Doing things that I have never seen  
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds  
  
Now I know that youre the  
Best thing in town  Best thing around  
Best thing in town  Best thing around  
  
Billie mumbling  
Sick and tired of all this wild SHIT
