Shadows run in the heat of the desert  
Hands beat at the door  
Someone stands and calls  
For the name of Salome  
  
As the veils were pushed away  
He gazed upon a face  
Hed never seen  
Was she a dream   
  
He heard the sound from a distance voice  
Youd better watch out  
Youd better watch out  
He heard the sound from a thousand years  
Calling out  
Calling out  
  
In the house of Salome  
You have to surrender  
  
Run with her said the young handmaiden  
She will be your queen  
All your life youll live  
In the dream of Salome  
  
Take her mouth and with your hands  
Just kiss her painted lips  
Dont you make a move  
till Salome calls you  
  
As the music danced around the desert night  
He smelt her perfumed skin  
As they made love  
  
He heard the sound of a distant voice  
Youd better watch out  
Youd better watch out  
He heard the sound of a thousand years  
Calling out  
Calling out  
  
In the house of Salome  
You have to surrender
