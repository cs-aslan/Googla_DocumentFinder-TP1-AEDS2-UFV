Should Auld acquaintance be forgot  
And never brought to mind  
Should Auld acquaintance be forgot  
And days o auld lang syne  
  
For Auld Lang Syne my dear  
For Auld Lang Syne  
Well tak a cup o kindness yet  
For days of Auld Lang Syne  
  
And heres a hand my trusty friend  
And gied a hand o thine  
And well tak a cup o kindness yet  
For Auld Lang Syne  
  
For Auld Lang Syne my dear  
For Auld Lang Syne  
Well take a cup o kindness yet  
For days of Auld Lang Syne
