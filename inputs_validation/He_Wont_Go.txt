Some say Ill be better without you  
They dont know you like I do  
Or at least as far as I thought I knew  
I cant bear this time  
It drags as I lose my mind  
Reminded by things I find  
I know some clothes you left behind  
Wake me up wake me up when all is done  
I wont rise until this battles won  
My dignity is become undone  
  
But I wont go  
I cant do it on my own  
If this aint love then what is  
Im willing to take the risk  
I wont go I cant do it on my own  
If this is aint love then what is  
Im willing to take the risk  
  
So petrified Im so scared to step into this right  
What if I lose my heart and fail declined  
I wont forgive me if I gave up trying  
I heard his voice today  
I didnt know a single word he said  
Not one resemblance to the man I met  
Just a vacant broken boy instead  
  
But I wont go I cant do it on my own  
If this aint love then what is  
Im willing to take the risk  
I wont go I cant do it on my own  
If this aint love then what is  
Im willing to take the risk  
  
There will be times well try and give it up  
Bursting at the seams no doubt  
We almost fall apart and burn to pieces  
So watch them turn to dust  
But nothing will never taint us  
  
I wont go I cant do it on my own  
If this aint love then what is  
Im willing to take the risk  
I wont go I cant do it on my own  
If this aint love then what is  
Im willing to take the risk  
  
Will he will he still remember me  
Will he still love me even when hes free  
Or will he go back to the place where  
He will choose the poison over me  
When we spoke yesterday  
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait  
Ill be home soon I wont be late  
  
He wont go  
He cant do it on his own  
If this aint love then what is  
Hes willing to take the risk  
So I wont go He cant do it on his own  
If this aint love then what is  
Im willing to take the risk  
  
Cause he wont go  
He cant do it on his own  
If this aint love then what is  
Were willing to take the risk  
I wont go I cant do it on my own  
If this aint love then what is  
Im willing to take the risk
