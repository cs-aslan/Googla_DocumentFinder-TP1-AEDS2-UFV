Ohwhoaohohoh  
Ohwhoaohohoh  
Ohwhoaohohoh  
Ohwhoaohohoh  
Ohwhoaohohoh  
Ohwhoaohohoh  
  
JESY  
I feel the rain on my skin  
Wash away all the pain I was in  
I see the sun in the sky  
No longer know how it feels to cry  
  
JADE  
And it really doesnt matter so what so what  
That Ive been hesitating so long so long  
Somebody turn up the lights  
Cause right now must be my time to shine  
  
ALL  
They said I couldnt they told me that I wouldnt  
But if they could see me now  
Theyd see Im something that Im not scared of nothing  
And the world will hear me shout  
We say ohoh ohoh ohoh oh ohoh ohoh ohoh oh  
Might call me crazy but Ive been thinking maybe  
You would change your mind if you could see me now  
  
Ohwhoaohohoh  
Ohwhoaohohoh  
Ohwhoaohohoh  
  
LEIGHANNE  
Drop me in the ocean Ill swim  
Throw me in with the lions Ill roar  
Theres a survivor within  
So much stronger than I was before  
  
PERRIE  
They never saw me coming so what so what  
Cause theyve been sleeping on me so long so long  
I gotta leave that behind  
Cause right now must be my time to shine  
  
ALL  
They said I couldnt they told me that I wouldnt  
But if they could see me now  
Theyd see Im something that Im not scared of nothing  
And the world will hear me shout  
We say ohoh ohoh ohoh oh ohoh ohoh ohoh oh  
Might call me crazy but Ive been thinking maybe  
You would change your mind if you could see me now  
  
Now  
  
They said I couldnt they told me that I wouldnt  
But if they could see me now  
Theyd see Im something that Im not scared of nothing  
And the world will hear me shout  
  
They said I couldnt they told me that I wouldnt  
But if they could see me now  
Theyd see Im something that Im not scared of nothing  
And the world will hear me shout  
We say ohoh ohoh ohoh oh ohoh ohoh ohoh oh  
Might call me crazy but Ive been thinking maybe  
You would change your mind if you could see me now
