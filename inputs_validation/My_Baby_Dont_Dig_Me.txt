Sometimes I stop and wonder  
How can this thing go on  
For when Im with my baby  
She always make me feel alone  
  
No my woman dont dig me no no  
Boys I know Im gonna  
Know the reason why  
  
No no my baby dont dig me  
No no she just dont dig me  
  
Well were as far from each other  
As the Earth is from the sky  
  
No no my baby dont dig me  
No no she just dont dig me  
  
Well I put my arms around her  
Shell flinch and move away  
And thats not just one time  
You know thats each and every day  
  
I tell you my woman  
She dont dig me now  
No no no no now now  
Boys I know the reason why  
  
No no my baby dont dig me  
No no she just dont dig me  
  
Well were far from each other  
Hey yeah as the Earth  
Is from the sky  
  
No no my baby dont dig me  
No no she just dont dig me  
  
We dont have enough in common  
To act like lovers should  
I think thats the reason  
Our love affairs no good  
  
You know my woman dont dig me  
No no no no  
Now people I tell you  
I know the reason why  
  
No no my baby dont dig me  
No no she just dont dig me  
  
Well were far from each other  
Hey hey hey yeah  
As the Earth is from the sky  
  
No no my baby dont dig me  
No no she just dont dig me
