Five AM in the mornin whiskey still runnin through my head  
I could get out of bed and maybe Ill just have another cigarette  
As long as I can remember seems all Ive ever done is work  
The boss is a jerk and I aint payin the rent  
Spent my whole life shovelin dirt  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Cant take this anymore  
Gonna go downtown pick up my girl  
There aint nothin worth waitin for  
Take the road less traveled  
Spend my life behind the wheel  
Gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Freedom made out of steel  
  
Theres a knock on the door from the sheriff  
Askin me where I was last night  
Seems somebody lookin a lot like me  
Had takin up with his wife  
He said son if I ever catch him  
Theres gonna be some hell to pay  
Hell be gone for good if I see him again  
cause I just might blow him away  
  
Chorus  
  
Whats a poor man supposed to do  
Stuck in the middle and trapped by the blues  
Baby Im sick of these blues  
  
Im gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Cant take this anymore  
Gonna go downtown pick up my girl  
There aint nothin worth waitin for  
Well I dont care if Im wrong or right  
Gotta split this town tonight  
Gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Live my life behind the wheel  
Im gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
My freedom made out of steel
