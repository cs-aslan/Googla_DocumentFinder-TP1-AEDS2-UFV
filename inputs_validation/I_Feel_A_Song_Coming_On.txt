I feel a song comin on  
And Im warning ya  
Its a victorious  
Happy and glorious new strain  
I feel a song comin on  
Its a melody  
Full of the laughter  
Of children out after the rain  
Youll hear a tuneful story  
Ringin thru ya  
Love and glory  
Hallelujah  
And now that my troubles are gone  
Let those heavenly drums go on drummin  
Cause I feel a song comin on  
  
I feel a song comin on  
And Im warning ya  
Its a victorious  
Happy and glorious new strain  
I feel a song comin on  
Its a melody  
Full of the laughter  
Of children out after the rain  
Youll hear a tuneful story  
Ringin thru ya  
Love and glory  
Hallelujah  
And now that my troubles are gone  
Let those heavenly drums go on drummin
