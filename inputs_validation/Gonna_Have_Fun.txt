This is gonna be fun  
This is gonna be real  
This is gonna be fun  
This is gonna be real  
This is gonna be  
See you later  
Tomorrows calling  
Ive gotta run  
Its so exciting  
A little scary  
I wish you could come  
I wish you could  
Maybe you could come  
Chorus  
This is gonna be fun  
This is gonna be real  
From my feet to my fingers  
Im gonna feel  
Im gonna feel  
This is gonna be realfun  
The clock is tickin  
Telephone ringin  
How time does fly  
Dont look so sad  
Dont look so lonely  
Oh this aint goodbye  
I wish you could  
Maybe you could come  
Chorus  
Ive got a full tank of gasoline  
I think its enough to follow the dream  
Follow the dream  
Follow the dream  
Follow the dream  
This is gonna be fun  
This is gonna be real  
From my feet to my fingers  
Im gonna feel  
Im gonna feel  
This is gonna be fun  
This is gonna be real  
From my feet to my fingers  
Im gonna feel  
Im gonna feel  
This is gonna be realfun  
This is gonna be realfun  
This is gonna be real
