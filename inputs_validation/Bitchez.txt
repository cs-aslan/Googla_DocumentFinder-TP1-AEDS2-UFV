Verse 1 Bas  
Damn you niggas so bitchless  
Swear its a mystery to yall how to get to the drawers  
Like Bas why you gotta say bitch when you swear  
Bitch I dont care  
Damn you niggas so bitchless  
Swear its a mystery to yall how to get to the drawers  
Got a bitch like a diamond  
Bitch got her flaws  
See the switch when she walk  
Give the bitch an applause  
My bitch call her my bitch if I want  
Fly to another continent if I want  
Ride through the projects if I want  
Type of chick keep me home but I wont  
Gotta roam out of town paying dues getting high  
Til I put a fiend flag on the moon cutie pie  
Say she want a shirt and a hat too thats cool  
She be waking up in boats monsoon thats true nigga

Gone off the Henny Im beyond faded  
Damn yall lookin so dehydrated

Yall so thirsty and Im her favorite  
I dont talk much but I say a lot  
Then when I stroll to the back red cup game come and take a shot  
When we sweating in the dark dont run  
Throw it back like youre inside the park home run

Verse 3 J Cole  
They say grief is the price of love fuck love  
Im out in DC whats the price of love Im tryna  
Get into something like a virus  
Get lucky like Im Irish  
Born broke Imma die rich  
Steve Jobs of the projects  
Pete Rock with a South twist  
When the beat drop nigga drop heat  
Like a teapot  
Nigga eavesdrop on the knowledge  
Once again its on  
A nigga cash never been this long  
A nigga passion aint been this strong  
Im in the zone  
Known to slang dick like its ten inch long  
Open wide get my bidness on  
Young Dennis get my menace on  
No ODog more like more Caine  
Get dough fuck hoes thats a full life thing  
06 I was po like rain  
Flow sick and I dont like lames  
Stop playing bitch
