Hello angel  do you know me Im you man  
Would that be hard for you to try and understand  
Ive been waiting for this day for so so long  
Could lovin you be so so wrong  
  
It doesnt matter much to me  
Baby  I been hurt before  
Dont you ask me why Im here  
Back and knockin at your door  
  
Do you remember  
Do you remember all the nights  
And all the love we went through  
Well you know maybe I thought you had some left over  
Could I mean that much to you  
  
It doesnt matter much to me  
Baby I been hurt before  
Dont you ask me why Im here  
Back and knockin at your door  
  
Now open up your arms and take me  
Make me love you till I die  
You wouldnt have me when I was a young man  
But tonight Im gonna try  
  
It doesnt matter much to me  
Baby  I been hurt before  
Dont you ask me why Im here  
Back and knockin at your door
