Come in and see the newest things  
Feel what just money can bring  
Dont you know thats the load of today  
  
You have a problem I can help  
Buy it and be yourself  
Cause you know thats the look of today  
  
So many trends just fade away  
Before you can wear it its a pass a blade  
But you know thats the look of today  
  
You are so stylish you are so vain  
Sometimes I think you have no brain  
But you know thats the look of today
