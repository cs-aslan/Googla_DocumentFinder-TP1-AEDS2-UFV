Sharon  
Ill be yours in springtime when the flowers are in bloom  
Well wander through the meadows in all their sweet perfume  
And every night Ill hold you tight beneath that April moon  
  
Chorus  
Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh  
Ill be your girl for all seasons all the year through  
Your girl for all seasons  
Cause I love yes I love to be everything to you just you  
  
Paulette  
Ill be yours in summer when were playin in the sand  
Well spend the day together makin love and gettin tanned  
And on the beach at sunset when were walking hand in hand  
  
Chorus  
  
Rhonda  
If you fall in the fall youll see September can be heavenly  
If you fall say youll fall for me  
When autumn leaves are fallin from the trees  
  
Stephanie  
Ill be yours in winter when the snow is on the ground  
Ill warm you through December and Ill always be around  
Well kiss below the mistletoe when Santa comes to town  
  
Chorus  
  
Girl for all seasons Ill be your girl for all seasons  
Summer in sunshine winter in snowflakes  
Springtime in showers falling in love  
Summer winter spring and fall  
Yes Ill be everything to you
