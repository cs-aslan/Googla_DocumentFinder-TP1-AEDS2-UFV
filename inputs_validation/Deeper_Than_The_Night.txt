I cant imagine why you say the things you do  
Maybe in time Ill understand  
What is the reason for the emptiness you feel  
When Im trying everything I can  
  
My love is running deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
Its a fire burning bright  
And its always been this way  
  
Can you hear me  
Am I really coming through  
Why do your eyes seem to dance away  
I know whats right for you havent I always  
I need you more than I can say  
  
My love is running deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
Its a fire burning bright  
And its always been this way  
  
My love is running deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
Its a fire burning bright  
And its always been this way  
  
And Ill never ever change  
In my life time Ill stay the same  
Yes Ill never Ill never change  
Ill love you Ill stay the same  
  
My love is running  
Deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
Fire burning bright  
And it keeps on growing  
Keeps on growing
