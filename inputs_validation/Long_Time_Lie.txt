Its been a while since you did something  
Not so long since you complained  
Can sit around here doing nothing everyday  
Youre the coward who points the finger  
I understand that Im helping you  
You have delusions and some spacedout fantasies  
Thats what you do  
  
He loves to wallow in the glory  
Loves to cut you down to size  
Try to make you believe in all of his lies  
Its been a long long long long long long time  
Its been a long long long long long long time  
Long time lie  
  
Dont you ever look in the mirror  
Dont you know theres so much more  
Locked up inside that box behind your door  
All your twisted conversations  
When youre sitting all alone  
Just remember we know your secret while you moan  
  
He loves to wallow in the glory  
Loves to cut you down to size  
Try to make you believe in all of his lies  
Its been a long long long long long long time  
Its been a long long long long long long time  
Long time lie
