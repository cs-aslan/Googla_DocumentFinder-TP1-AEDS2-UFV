CHORUS  
Pay no attention to Alice shes drunk all the timehooked on that wine  
Bunches of it  
And it ruined her mind  
Pay no attention to Alice they say shes a sot sane she is not but she
loves  
It  
And its all shes got  
She made that apple pie from a memory  
Made them biscuits from a recollection that she had  
She cooked that chicken too long but she dont know that  
Oh what the hell it aint too bad  
CHORUS  
Dont talk about the war I was a coward  
Talk about fishing and all the good times raisin hell  
Empty that one down well get another one  
Its getting late you might as well  
Though we ram your car into a ditch man dont sweat it  
I know Ben down at the shell station and hell get it out  
Alice put your ashes in that ashtray I swear woman  
Youre gonna burn down the house  
Pay no attention to Alice shes drunk all the time
