Were no strangers to love  
You know the rules and so do I  
A full commitments what Im thinking of  
You wouldnt get this from any other guy  
  
I just want to tell you how Im feeling  
Gotta make you understand  
  
Chorus  
Never gonna give you up never gonna let you down  
Never gonna run around and desert you  
Never gonna make you cry never gonna say goodbye  
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  
  
Weve known each other for so long  
Your hearts been aching but youre too shy to say it  
Inside we both know whats been going on  
We know the game and were gonna play it  
  
And if you ask me how Im feeling  
Dont tell me youre too blind to see  
  
Chorus x2  
Never gonna give you up never gonna let you down  
Never gonna run around and desert you  
Never gonna make you cry never gonna say goodbye  
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  
  
Ooh give you up  
Ooh give you up  
Ooh Never gonna give never gonna give give you up  
Ooh Never gonna give never gonna give give you up  
  
Weve known each other for so long  
Your hearts been aching but youre too shy to say it  
Inside we both know whats been going on  
We know the game and were gonna play it  
  
I just want to tell you how Im feeling  
Gotta make you understand  
  
Chorus x3  
Never gonna give you up never gonna let you down  
Never gonna run around and desert you  
Never gonna make you cry never gonna say goodbye  
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
