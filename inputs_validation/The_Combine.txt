And life is very difficult when youre in the crowd  
When youre in the crowd you see things as they really are  
You can smell the fear and hate generated by all around   
I want to breakaway but the ties are too strong  
want to go on holiday but the crowd says I cant  
See life is very different when youre in the crowd  
Oh sometimes in the night I wish I was faraway  
But then I realize even escape will be in vain  
I want to close my eyes and be like the rest  
I mean nobody wants to die although the crowd say they do  
Look life is very intricate when youre in the crowd  
Life becomes the movies  
And everyone has a role  
Its easy being the actor  
When the combines the only star   
Sunday papers  
And the dailies

Far away  
In a distant land  
But were alright  
Were nice and warm here  
No one to hurt us  
Except ourselves
