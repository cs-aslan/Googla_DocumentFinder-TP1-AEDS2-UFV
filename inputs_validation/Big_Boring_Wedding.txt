I have entered a shiny new realm  
A very different and very spoiled world  
Its with great pleasure I introduce myself  
To call and thank you for such delicious pie  
  
The irony is sweet  the bird is paralyzed  
With one good finger you try me on for size  
Its hard to imagine that you just wanna leave  
With yellow photos  pocketsize  
  
Revealing mobility your psychedelic eye  
Spontaneous and violent but private to the mind  
With nowhere left to go  
  
Pass the word the chicks are back  
The chicks are back yeah  
The chicks are back  
Pass the word the chicks are back  
The chicks are back yeah  
The chicks are back  
  
The chandelier is spinning and shaking  
The fireball is already waking  
  
Revealing mobility your psychedelic eye  
Spontaneous and violent but private to the mind  
With nowhere left to go  
  
Pass the word the chicks are back  
The chicks are back yeah  
The chicks are back  
Pass the word the chicks are back  
The chicks are back yeah  
The chicks are back
