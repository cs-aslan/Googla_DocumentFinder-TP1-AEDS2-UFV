Mirrored in your face  
Is a look that says it all  
  
Boy Im slow  
Ive been uncertain  
Just couldnt be sure  
Now I know  
  
You say its over  
But just how long have you known  
You better go now  
But as you leave me  
  
Shoot to disable  
Shoot to disable  
  
Maybe I got careless  
Maybe its true I ran too fast  
But on recollection it didnt do much  
So I pass  
  
Youre such a hard man  
Why cant you take steady aim  
Just get it over with  
Dont fool around now  
  
Shoot to disable  
Shoot to disable  
  
Oh what a fool I was to love
