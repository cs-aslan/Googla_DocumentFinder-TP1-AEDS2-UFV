I love you so much  
But I hate what youve done  
I know from here things will never be the same  
And things will probably never change  
I know what we want  
Isnt exactly what god had planned  
Hey its all I can do is  
Hope you can see the difference  
And prey for the best  
Please dont forget me  
  
I wont soothe your pain  
I wont ease your strength  
  
Drake  
I should let you fall in love with  
Someone else girl  
I live in L A  
You in Chicago  
Youre not patient  
Im not patient  
We shouldnt be together  
I think we shouldnt be together  
No more no no more no  
Just think Im where it all beginning  
Youre the envy of your prince  
Plus you know youre not yourself any more  
The miracle of change  
But if we got together it will never be the same like before girl  
And Im sorry  
I said Im sorry girl  
Yeah  
She said look me in my fucking eyes and say it  
But tell me am I wrong for what Im saying  
  
Is it wrong for me to tell these women what they wanna hear  
Try to control us  
You wanna hold us down  
Yeah you really wanna hold us down  
Yeah you really wanna hold us  
  
All I asked is for a chance to prove that money cant really make me happy  
Crazy how I blew myself from fucked up predicaments  
I mean women inspire me to great things  
Drake  
I need to grow some fucking confidence  
And why you gotta say the last words  
And if I tell you how I really felt  
There probably end up being another argument candy girl  
You know everything you thought of me came from yourself  
Yeah  
And that shit starts to get old  
And I dont mean to say the most  
But you know how they say you are who you hang with  
So it bothers me when you hang with hoes  
  
Drake  
Is it wrong for me to tell these women what they wanna hear  
  
You know how they say  
If you love somebody  
That dont love you back  
Love them anyway
