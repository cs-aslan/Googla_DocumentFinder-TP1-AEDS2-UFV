Im your  
Back door Santa  
I make my run  
At the break of day  
They call me  
Back door Santa  
I make my run  
At the break of day  
I keep  
The little girls happy  
While the boys  
Are out to play  
  
Well  
I aint like  
Old Saint Nick  
He dont come  
But once a year  
Once a year  
Well  
I aint like  
Old Saint Nick  
He dont come  
But once a year  
  
I come runnin  
With my presents  
Every time  
You call me dear  
  
I kept some change  
In my pocket  
When the jumpins  
Goin on  
I gave a few pennies  
So we could be alone  
I kept that door open  
In case anyone  
Smelled a mouse  
Cause Santas  
In some trouble  
There aint no chimney  
In the house  
  
They call me  
Back door Santa  
I make my run  
At the break of day  
They call me  
Back door Santa  
I make my run  
At the break of day  
I keep  
The little girls happy  
While the boys  
Are out to play
