There are people who have let the problems of today  
Lead them to conclude that for them life is not the way  
But every problem has an answer and if yours you cannot find  
You should talk it over to Him  
Hell give you peace of mind  
When you feel your lifes too hard  
Just go have a talk with God  
  
Many of us feel we walk alone without a friend  
Never communicating with the One who lives within  
Forgetting all about the One who never ever lets you down  
And you can talk to him anytime Hes always around  
When you feel your lifes too hard  
Just go have a talk with God  
  
Well Hes the only free psychiatrist thats known throughout the world  
For solving the problems of all men women little boys and girls  
When you feel your lifes too hard  
Just go have a talk with God  
  
When you feel your lifes too hard  
Just go have a talk with God  
When your loads too much to bear  
Just go talk to God He cares  
I know he does  
  
When you feel your lifes too hard  
Just go have a talk with God  
Thankyou  
Thankyou very much
