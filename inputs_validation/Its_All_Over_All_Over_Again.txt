I know you know Im sorry  
And you know that I feel the same  
Weve grown too lonesome together Oh yes we have  
And all that we share is the blame  
  
Lets take a chance while theres something to say  
Oh darling dont throw it away  
We know that weve both got so much to lose  
And the rest of our lifetime to pay  
  
We could be good to each other Yes we could  
Better than weve ever been  
Oh darlin were starting all over  
Its all over all over again  
  
I know we could be good to each other Yes we could  
Better than weve ever been  
Oh darlin were starting all over  
Its all over all over again  
Its all over all over again
