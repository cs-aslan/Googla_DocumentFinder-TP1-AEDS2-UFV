Its the most frightening thing in the world  
Its the scariest sight Ive ever seen  
The most chilling visual  
The most terrifying scene  
Its awful its crappy its monstrous its bad  
Its really really huge  
Its a fat man in a Speedo  
Im walking on a beach in a tropical isle  
Hoping to enjoy the sand and surf  
When I see a mound of babyoiled flesh  
Rolling and a broiling in the foam  
The only thing thats holding this  
Explosion of Caucasian is  
A tiny red synthetic coloured thread  
I try to sink it in the sand  
And entomb it in a castle but  
It always manages to break free  
The fat man in a Speedo  
Im having nightmares  
Im scared to open my eyes  
I try to free myself  
By going to the buffet  
But there he is  
He even eats in his Speedo  
I take up a collection at the bar the next day  
And everybody gives to the cause  
To rent a helicopter that will take this whale  
To Cuba and free the horizon from his bulk  
We have a celebration  
In one of his indentations  
And throw a bowl of jello in the air  
We think weve escaped and our scenery is clear  
But in comes a plane from Germany  
Thirty fat German men wearing Speedos
