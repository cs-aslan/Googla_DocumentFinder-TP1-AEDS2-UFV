Theres truth in your eyes let me hear it from your lips  
Your tears say you cry let your words be the whip baby  
  
Theres no reason anymore to live with all the pain  
Take this key unlock the door before it makes us both insane  
  
Spill your heart out to me darlin girl I really need to know  
  
Chorus  
Screams and whispers dont be afraid  
Lets be more than lovers tonight  
Screams and whispers let go of the pain  
Whatever we uncover we can make it make it alright  
  
Alright  
  
I know youve been alone takin care of yourself  
Girl dont you think its time to trust somebody else  
  
Try just once to let your guard down youve got nothin there to hide  
  
Chorus  
  
Spill your heart out to me darlin girl I really need to know  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Whatever we uncover therell be screams and whispers tonight  
  
Alright
