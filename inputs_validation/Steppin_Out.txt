You go where you want  
You do what you please  
Never let on that even once  
That youve ever been lonely  
Its nice to see you alone  
Are you lookin for somethin  
Maybe you aint gettin at home  
  
Your hair is in place  
Youre dressin to kill  
Your old man has promised  
When he died he would leave you his money  
And the pool where you swim  
Are you lookin for somethin  
Maybe you aint gettin from him  
  
Steppin out steppin out  
To get a little action on the side  
Steppin out steppin out  
The day time queen takes a midnight ride  
  
And its plain as plain can be  
Youre a woman who wants to get free  
If youre steppin out tonight honey  
Come on and step out with me  
  
The partys a bore  
Its bound to get worse  
Lets sneak out somewhere  
And engage in our own celebration  
Will you pour me some wine  
Are you thinkin baby maybe  
Your needs are the same as mine  
  
Wanna go for a walk  
Go for a ride  
Maybe just stand here and think  
What we can do to each other  
No we dont have to dance  
If youre thinkin of steppin out  
Baby this is your chance  
  
Steppin out steppin out  
To get a little action on the side  
Steppin out steppin out  
The day time queen takes a midnight ride  
  
And its plain as plain can be  
Youre a woman who wants to get free  
If youre steppin out tonight honey  
Come on and step out with me
