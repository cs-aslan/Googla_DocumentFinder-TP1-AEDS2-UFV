Now Id hear a lot of tall stories since my business is writin songs  
And every now and then if you listen real close a good true one comes along  
And this is the story of old Bill Crump from the North Carolina Hills  
Nat Winston of Nashville knew this man real well  
He built the church and he built the pews  
He built the cradles and the furniture for the schools  
Folks in Avery County say that he was better than good  
Probably one of the reasons the Lord made wood  
Now men have faults and Bills fault was he loved to sip that corn  
He lived ninety some years that way dont guess it was hurtin him none  
You could take him a picture from a catalog he could build anything hed see  
He could make anything that you could make out of the tree  
One day Bill said Mama Im gettin old I want you to measure me good  
Im goin out to that wood pile and get myself some wood  
And Im gonna make me a coffin I want it to fit me fine  
The way I figure it Ive got about enough time  
He built the church and he built the pews  
Now Bill worked on that coffin like he was gonna be there awhile  
Hed show the folks and rub that wood and then stand back and smile  
He used that body for ninety some years figured it had treated him good  
And when he left it he put it away in some real fine wood  
Oh right now old Bills sleepin in the hills of North Caroline  
In his homemade coffin hand rubbed walnut velvet lined  
Now most folks use their heads and hands and just think of themselves  
His bodys there but his spirits someplace else  
Cause he built the church and he built the pews
