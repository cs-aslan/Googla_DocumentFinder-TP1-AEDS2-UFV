God please push me in the right direction  
God Im hoping that youll understand  
God Im trying to make amends now  
God Im asking for your guiding hand  
  
Everybodys got the wrong opinion  
Everybody says whats on their mind  
Everybodys got the wrong tradition  
Everybody pray to the man  
  
God Im reading in your holy books now  
God Im singing and Im not afraid  
God Im looking for the only way out now  
God Im hoping that I can be saved  
  
Everybodys got the wrong religion  
You wont say whats on your mind  
Some wont hear why others listen  
Everybody pray to the man  
  
Why dont you ever answer questions  
Now my faith is slipping away  
Im looking in a different direction  
Believing is the only way  
  
Everybodys got their own tradition  
Everybodys got the wrong religion  
Everybodys got their own salvation  
Everybodys got the wrong submission  
  
Everybodys got their own religion  
Everybodys got the wrong tradition  
Everybody pray to the man
