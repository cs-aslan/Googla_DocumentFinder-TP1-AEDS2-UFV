Loving you was just a storybook of fair Ive decided there aint no real life
anywhere  
Soon Ill be a painted picture in the book of your mind  
Another town is somewhere down the line  
Another town another grocery store another town another set of swinging doors  
And somehow Im a little bit suspicious in my mind  
Its another town that dont need my kind  
Tell your mama she was sure a dandy cook tell your papa that I understood his
looks  
If I put it all together youre a piece that wouldnt fit  
Theres another town a comin up I guess  
Another town another grocery store  
As I leave you let me leave you with this thought  
Time is candy and we ate all that we bought  
And teardrops theyre just wrappers on the ground  
That a new wind blows into another town  
Another town another grocery store  
Another town another grocery store
