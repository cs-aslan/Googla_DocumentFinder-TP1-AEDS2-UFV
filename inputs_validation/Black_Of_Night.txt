I need light I need light to find my way around this house  
Im turning on the chandelier  
Nice bright light for me to see  
Little footsteps coming from the hallway  
Oh No The lights are flickering  
Oh No The lights are out  
In the black of night oh its so hard to see  
In the Black of night I see the moon  
In the black of night oh the moon is full  
Ha ha In the black of night oh its so hard to see  
In the Black of night I see the moon  
In the black of night oh the moon is full  
My black cat Magic  
Mesmerized by something in the hallway  
Whos to say whats living in the Darkness  
Who is to say if a black cat can sense it  
I need light I need light to find my way around this house  
Oh Theres a candle  
Just a little light So I can see again  
Little footsteps coming from the hallway  
Auu Auu Something hit me on the head  
Auu Auu There it is again  
In the black of night oh its so hard to see  
In the Black of night I see the moon  
In the black of night oh the moon is full  
In the black of night oh its so hard to see
