Theres something crawling up my wrist  
I think its dying  
Bless the Lord  
I cant think straight anymore  
  
You wont see me crying  
Therell be tears before bedtime for sure  
  
Singing  
I wont go to war  
Lay down your guns  
What are we fighting for  
  
I wanna swim in the ocean  
I wanna play in the sea  
I wanna love my brother  
Love my brother loving me me  
  
Im gonna buy a farm  
Write a song  
It wont change the earth  
Just the people on it  
  
I was born with  
A silver shovel in my mouth  
Golden balls and a platinum smile  
  
You wont hear the last of  
The good the bad or the brassed off for sure  
  
Singing  
I wont go to war  
Lay down your guns  
What are we fighting for  
  
I wanna swim with the dolphins  
I wanna play in the sea  
Im gonna love my brother  
Love my brother loving me  
  
Then buy a farm  
Write a song  
It wont change the earth  
Just the people on it  
  
Hear the sound of a million people sitting down  
Hip to hip  
Lip to lip  
Free your love  
Free love  
Free love  
  
Singing I wont go to war  
Lay down your guns  
What are we fighting for  
  
I wanna swim with the dolphins  
Im gonna play in the sea  
Im gonna love my brother  
Love my brother loving me me  
  
Singing I wont go to war  
Lay down my guns  
What are we fighting for  
  
I wanna play with the dolphins  
I want to play in the sea  
Im gonna love my brother  
Love my brother loving me me  
  
Hear the sound of a million people sitting down  
Hip to hip  
Lip to lip  
Free your love  
Free love  
Free love
