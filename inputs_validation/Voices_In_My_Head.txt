All alone in my room  
Waiting for for this phone to ring  
Shell come home someday soon  
I just know or am I imagining things  
The voices in my head keep saying  
The voices in my head  
Shes coming back to you  
  
Is it strange that I talk to myself oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Is it weird when I hear someone else oh oh oh oh oh oh  
What do I do what do I do  
Theres no more you theres no more you  
And I tell me youll be coming home coming home  
Is it strange I believe them again oh oh oh  
Voices in my head  
The voices the voices the voices  
Voices in my head  
The voices oh the voices the voices  
  
Someones there at the door  
This is her I just know I just know  
I put on a smile  
Oh but I its just the mail again the mail again  
The playing in my mind the playing in my mind  
Saying shell come back this time  
  
Is it strange that I talk to myself oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Is it weird when I hear someone else oh oh oh oh oh oh  
What do I do what do I do  
Theres no more you theres no more you  
And I tell me youll be coming home coming home  
Is it strange I believe them again oh oh oh  
Voices in my head  
Its gonna be ok its gonna be ok its gonna be ok  
Oh just gotta get through the day  
Its gonna be ok its gonna be ok its gonna be ok  
Oh I just gotta get through  
The voices in my head the voices in my head  
Keep saying shes coming back to you  
  
Is it strange that I talk to myself oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Is it weird when I hear someone else oh oh oh oh oh oh  
What do I do what do I do  
Theres no more you theres no more you  
And I tell me youll be coming home coming home  
Is it strange I believe them again oh oh oh  
Voices in my head  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
