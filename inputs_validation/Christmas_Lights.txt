Christmas night another fight  
Tears we cried a flood  
Got all kinds of poison in  
Poison in my blood  
  
I took my feet  
To Oxford Street  
Trying to right a wrong  
Just walk away  
Those windows say  
But I cant believe shes gone  
  
When youre still waiting for the snow to fall  
Doesnt really feel like Christmas at all  
  
Up above candles on air flicker  
Oh they flicker and they float  
But Im up here holding on  
To all those chandeliers of hope  
  
Like some drunken Elvis singing  
I go singing out of tune  
Saying how I always loved you darling  
And I always will  
  
Oh when youre still waiting for the snow to fall  
Doesnt really feel like Christmas at all  
  
Still waiting for the snow to fall  
It doesnt really feel like Christmas at all  
  
Those Christmas lights  
Light up the street  
Down where the sea and city meet  
May all your troubles soon be gone  
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on  
  
Those Christmas lights  
Light up the street  
Maybe theyll bring her back to me  
Then all my troubles will be gone  
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on  
  
Oh Christmas lights  
Light up the street  
Light up the fireworks in me  
May all your troubles soon be gone  
Those Christmas lights keep shining on
