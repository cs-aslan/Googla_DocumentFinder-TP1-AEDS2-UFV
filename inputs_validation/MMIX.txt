Somewhere up above the stars  
The wreckage of a universe floats past  
Somewhere up above my heart  
A tiny little seed is sown  
A government is overthrown  
Who knows when well be coming home at last  
And I heard it on the radio  
That one day well be living in the stars  
And I heard it on a tv show  
That somewhere up above  
And in my heart  
Theyll be tearing us apart  
Maybe moving us to mars  
Past the satellites and stars  
Maybe moving us to mars  
We wont see the earth again  
In these seconds just remain unchanged  
8 to 9 9 to 10  
We are meeting for the first time  
We might never meet again you and me  
We are meeting for the first time  
Cant you see  
76543  
We are meeting for the first time  
Singing this space symphony  
Theyll be tearing us apart moving us to mars  
Past the satellites and stars  
Theyre moving us to mars
