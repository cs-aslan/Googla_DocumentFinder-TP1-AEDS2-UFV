Well I could search from now to the end of the time  
Never find another you  
Im so glad because I know youre mine  
  
Someone to give my love to  
Well I believe my love that youre one of the kind  
For theres no one else like you  
Youre the light of my life so let it shine  
  
Someone to give my love to  
Well I find happiness is lovin you  
And Ill do my best to make your dreams come true  
Now I will follow you to the end of the earth  
For my place will be with you  
Well I have taken you for better or worse  
  
Someone to give my love to  
Well I find happiness is lovin you  
And Ill do my best to make your dreams come true  
Days of manandwifetime are precious few  
I will spend them all with you  
Then beyond forever Ill wait for you

Shine on me my whole life through  
Well youre the light of my life so let it shine
