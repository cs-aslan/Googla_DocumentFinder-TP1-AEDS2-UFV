Some might say Im guilty of love in the first degree  
If the jury wants to lock me up and throw away the key  
Theres no greater punishment than what I face inside

Unless you felt it too

Swear tell the truth just let me plead my case  
The thief who stole my heart from me I couldnt let escape  
Hes my only alibi but I wont drop a dime  
So how can I give up to you my partner in crime  
  
He lives inside my heart  
Im in the middle too  
You never had a clue  
Unless you felt it too  
  
If love is a crime baby  
Id do my time  
Whether its wrong or right

Cause my heart will set me free
