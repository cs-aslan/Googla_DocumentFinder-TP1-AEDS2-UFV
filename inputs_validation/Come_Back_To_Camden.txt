There is something I wanted to tell you  
Its so funny youll kill yourself laughing  
But then I I look around  
And I remember that I am alone  
Alone  
For evermore  
  
The tile yard all along the railings  
Up a discolored dark brown staircase  
Here youll find despair and I  
Calling to you with whats left of my heart  
My heart  
For evermore  
  
Drinking tea with the taste of the Thames  
Sullenly on a chair on the pavement  
Here youll find my thoughts and I  
And here is the very last plea from my heart  
My heart For evermore  
Where taxi drivers never stop talking  
Under slate grey Victorian sky  
Here you will find despair and I  
And here I am every last inch of me is yours  
Yours  
For evermore  
  
Your leg came to rest against mine  
Then you lounged with knees up and apart  
And me and my heart we knew  
We just knew  
For evermore  
  
Where taxi drivers never stop talking  
Under slate grey Victorian sky  
Here youll find my heart and I  
And still we say come back  
Come back to Camden  
And Ill be good Ill be good  
Ill be good Ill be good
