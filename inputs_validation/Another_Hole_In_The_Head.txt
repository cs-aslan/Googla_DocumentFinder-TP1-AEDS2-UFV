Im through thinking of things to say to you  
Its true Ive said enough and so have you  
Just drive you slam the door and so do I  
Tongue tied from all the little things  
And theyre the reason that I scream  
  
I needed you  
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head  
Cause I needed you  
Car keys in your hand I believe that you would leave me for dead  
  
Your turn youd rather leave than live and learn  
Thats why you want an end and so do I  
This time I believe Ill leave it all behind  
Tongue tied from all the little things  
And theyre the reason that I scream  
  
I needed you  
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head  
Cause I needed you  
Car keys in your hand I believe that you would leave me for dead  
Cause I needed you  
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head  
Cause I needed you  
Car keys in your hand I believe that you would leave me for dead  
  
I believe that you would leave me for  
I believe you would leave  
Me for dead me for dead  
I believe you would leave  
Me for dead me for dead
