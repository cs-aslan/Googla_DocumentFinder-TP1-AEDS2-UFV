Im without her somewhere far away  
I keep thinking about her but I know I cant stay  
She haunts me like a nightmare her image is everywhere  
She doesnt leave me alone  
I cant escape her or erase her  
When I know shes not coming home  
  
I cant understand where I went wrong  
I cant understand where her love has gone  
I dont know where I belong  
My world is over  
When life goes on her world goes on and on and on  
Her world goes on  
When life goes on her world goes on and on and on  
My world is gone  
  
Am I crazy or just human  
Is this what heartbreak is  
What should I be doing  
It feels like I got seconds to live  
She haunts me like a nightmare her image is everywhere  
She doesnt leave me alone  
I cant escape her or erase her  
When I know shes not coming home  
  
I cant understand where I went wrong  
I cant understand where her love has gone  
I dont know where I belong  
My world is over  
When life goes on her world goes on and on and on  
Her world goes on  
When life goes on her world goes on and on and on  
My world is gone  
  
My world is over while her world goes on  
 I dont know where I belong  
My world is over  
When life goes on her world goes on and on and on  
Her world goes on  
When life goes on her world goes on and on and on  
My world is gone
