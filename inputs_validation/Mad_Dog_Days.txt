You sit in your room pretending to cry  
Oh you seem so unwilling to try  
Say what youre selling is just a lie  
And know that your price is far too high  
  
Every night and every day  
I show you my picture you just throw the frame away  
With all that you think youve got little to say  
I cant look at your face any more  
  
Oh the mad dog days  
I say oh theyre just mad dog days  
In them mad dog days  
I dont care if its true  
Between me and you  
Cant see it through  
Please let me say goodbye  
  
I never get used to you  
Oh no never could never get used to you  
I never get used to you  
I never get used to you  
  
You dont see my dream I dont see your romance  
You make me feel like a dancer but you dont care to  
dance  
You see me hit the bottle you hit the sack  
I go ratbag racing on the flat of my back  
  
In these mad dog days  
I call them mad dog days  
I know them mad dog days  
I dont care if its true  
Between me and you  
Cant see it through  
Oh please let me say goodbye  
  
I never get used to you  
Oh I never get used to you  
Ooh I never get used to you  
I never never never never get used to you  
  
Cos you you keep sitting in your lonely little room  
You never never never come out at all  
You you keep sitting in your little darkened room  
Youre unwilling to try  
Pretending to cry  
Youre telling a lie  
Oh please just say goodbye  
  
I never get used to you  
I dont want to get used to you  
I never get used to you  
I never never no could never get used to you  
  
Ah lord I never get used to you  
With your crying  
I never get used to you  
Stop crying and lying  
Oh I never get used to you  
You know could never get used to you
