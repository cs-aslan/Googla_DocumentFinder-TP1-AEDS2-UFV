If youve been thinking youre all that youve got  
Then dont feel alone anymore  
When were together then youve got a lot  
Cause I am the river and you are the shore  
And it goes on and on oh watching the river run  
Further and further from things that weve done  
Leaving them one by one  
And we have just begun watching the river run  
Listening learning and yearning to  
Run river run  
Winding and swirling and dancing along  
We pass by the old willow tree  
Where lovers caress as we sing of our song  
Twisting together when we greet the sea  
And it goes on and on watching the river run  
Further and further from things that weve done  
Leaving them one by one  
And we have just begun watching the river run  
Listening learning and yearning to  
Run river run  
And it goes on and on watching the river run  
Further and further from things that weve done  
Leaving them one by one  
And we have just begun watching the river run  
Listening learning and yearning to  
Run river run
