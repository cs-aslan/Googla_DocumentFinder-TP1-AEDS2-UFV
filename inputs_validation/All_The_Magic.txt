colonna sonora del film delle winx  
  
Promises have meaning once again  
And broken dreams are drifting to an end  
Im feel it like my life has just begun  
  
Im waking for the first time waking for the first time  
Waking for the very first time to the sun  
  
Im getting a feeling that I want to explore  
My heart to the ceiling and my feet off the floor  
You let in all the magic  
  
Oh its even better than before  
You open your heart and then you open the door  
Im getting all the magic  
  
Desert land is drinking from the sky  
Ever since I heard the words that made me cry  
Theres love in shadows waiting to be seen  
  
Im waking for the first time waking for the first time  
Waking for the very first time to a dream  
  
Im getting a feeling that I want to explore  
My heart to the ceiling and my feet off the floor  
You let in all the magic  
  
Oh Its even better than before  
You open your heart and then you oprn the door  
Im getting all the magic  
  
Im getting a feeling that I want to explore  
My heart to the ceiling and my feet off the floor  
You let in all the magic  
  
Im getting all the magic  
Im getting all the magic  
  
Could you imagine all the magic  
Im getting all the magic
