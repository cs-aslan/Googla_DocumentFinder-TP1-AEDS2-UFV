Theres a man who sees all there is to see  
What the future holds for all  
As the days grow dark with the grim and final warning  
Beware of the ones with invisible friends  
They will steal into your mind  
And all too soon the signs begin to show  
  
Rise up to the shining  
Live long live now  
Rise up to the shining  
Dont be blind by fools again  
Fools again  
  
As the pages turn and the storys told  
From the visions hes seen  
The house on the hill  
With the haunted eyes that call  
no one laughed as madness came out  
To play its game  
If you stay too long youll finally go insane  
  
Rise up to the shining  
Live long live now  
Rise up to the shining  
Dont be blind by fools again  
Fools again  
  
Bells will take their toll  
On your way  
Theres no way were born to shine  
Before our time all your life  
Youre on your own  
Lonely road  
Lost in a time  
Let the light lead your way  
To the golden throne  
Its the only way  
  
Rise up to the shining  
Live long live now  
Rise up to the shining  
Dont be blind by fools again  
Rise up to the shining  
Live long live now  
Rise up the shining  
Dont be blind by fools again  
  
Oh rise up to the shining  
Wise up theyre gonna steal your mind  
Rise up the house is gonna haunt you  
No one laughed no one cried  
You stayed too long  
Youre finally gonna stay
