Im missing you  
Girl even though youre right here by my side  
Cause lately it seems  
The distance between us is growing too wide  
  
Im so afraid that youre saying its over  
The last thing that I wanna hear  
  
But if your hearts not in it for real  
Please dont try to fake what you dont feel  
If loves already gone  
Its not fair to lead me on  
Cause I would give the whole world for you  
Anything you ask of me Id do  
But I wont ask you to stay  
Id rather walk away  
If your hearts not in it  
  
You say that you love me  
But baby sometimes  
Youre just saying the words  
If youve got somethin to tell me  
Dont keep it inside  
Let it be heard  
  
Im so afraid that youre saying its over  
Girl Ill make it easy for you  
  
But if your hearts not in it for real  
Please dont try to fake what you dont feel  
If loves already gone  
Its not fair to lead me on  
Cause I would give the whole world for you  
Anything you ask of me Id do  
But I wont ask you to stay  
Id rather walk away  
If your hearts not in it  
  
How I wish I could take us back in time  
But its gone too far now we cant rewind And theres nothing that I can do  
To stop me losin you  
I cant make you change your mind If your hearts not in it  
  
But if your hearts not in it for real  
Please dont try to fake what you dont feel  
If loves already gone  
Its not fair to lead me on  
Cause I would give the whole world for you  
Anything you ask of me Id do  
But I wont ask you to stay  
Id rather walk away  
If your hearts not in it
