They told me what youd do  
If I ever stayed with you  
They told me that youd laugh  
While I cried  
  
They told me what youd say  
That youd turn and walk away  
And find another place to play  
While I cried  
  
Now I think back on those times  
I didnt read between the lines  
How all the things that you said  
Never seemed to match the things you did  
  
Thoughts keep turning round in my mind  
Now I see reason and rhyme  
Time spent with you has brought me something  
And Ive lost nothing If you are that kind  
  
They told me what youd do  
If I ever stayed with you  
And sure enough  
It all came true
