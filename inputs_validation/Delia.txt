Delia was a gambling girl gambled all around  
Delia was a gambling girl she laid her money down  
All the friends I ever had are gone  
  
Delias dear ol mother took a trip out West  
When she returned little Delia gone to rest  
All the friends I ever had are gone  
  
Delias daddy weeped Delias momma moaned  
Wouldnt have been so bad if the poor girl died at home  
All the friends I ever had are gone  
  
Curtis looking high Curtis looking low  
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel fortyfour  
All the friends I ever had are gone  
  
High up on the housetops high as I can see  
Looking for them rounders looking out for me  
All the friends I ever had are gone  
  
Men in Atlanta tryin to pass for white  
Delias in the graveyard boys six feet out of sight  
All the friends I ever had are gone  
  
Judge says to Curtis Whats this noise about  
All about them rounders Judge tryin to cut me out  
All the friends I ever had are gone  
  
Curtis said to the judge What might be my fine  
Judge says Poor boy you got ninetynine  
All the friends I ever had are gone  
  
Curtis in the jail house drinking from an old tin cup  
Delias in the graveyard she aint gettin up  
All the friends I ever had are gone  
  
Delia oh Delia how can it be  
You loved all them rounders never did love me  
All the friends I ever had are gone  
  
Delia oh Delia how can it be  
You wanted all them rounders never had time for me  
All the friends I ever had are gone
