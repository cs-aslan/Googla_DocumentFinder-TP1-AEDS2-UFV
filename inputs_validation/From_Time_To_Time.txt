From time to time I have regrets  
For all the things I didnt say  
That were on my list  
From time to time my memory slips  
But youre the one thing in my life  
I wont forget  
  
Therell never be minute of the day  
I wont think of you  
My feelings are so strong in me  
I feel it through and through  
Therell never be a night thats so dark that we wont shine  
Or a dream that weve lost that we cant find  
Youll always be oh the one for me  
I think of you from time to time  
And in between  
  
Therell never be minute of the day  
I wont think of you  
My feelings are so strong in me  
I feel it through and through  
Therell never be a night thats so dark that we wont shine  
Or a dream that weve lost that we cant find  
Youll always be oh the one for me  
I think of you from time to time  
And in between  
  
Youll always be oh the one for me  
I think of you from time to time  
And in between  
Oooo yeah  
  
Youll always be Oooo the one for me  
From time to time  
And in between yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah I do  
I think of you from time to time  
And in between yeah
