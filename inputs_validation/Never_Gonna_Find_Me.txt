On a mission started by my own admission  
I will leave you all behind  
By direction Ill create my own protection  
The real me youll never find  
  
Aspirations turn to fear and desperation  
Nothings ever good enough for you  
Burn in sorrow cause I see theres no tomorrow  
Youll only see what I want you to  
  
Never gonna find me  
Never gonna find me  
Way down deep inside there is a real me  
Im always gonna hide and this is who youll see  
Never gonna find me  
Never gonna find me  
Way down deep inside they havent found me yet  
Im always gonna hide and this is who youll get  
  
On a mission to establish my attrition  
You may think that you have won  
Your rejection has brought on my introspection  
Ill escape Ill only run  
  
Accusations may destroy my motivation  
I can feel it when youre pushing me  
Burn in sorrow cause I see theres no tomorrow  
Only I know which me youll see  
  
Break away  
Run  
Down inside  
Ive got to  
Push it way  
Down  
I did not choose this  
  
I dont really know  
What I want to say  
I cant afford the throw  
Cant make it go away  
Try to make it through  
Fuck your decision  
I cant feel myself  
But Im burning up now  
  
Never gonna find me
