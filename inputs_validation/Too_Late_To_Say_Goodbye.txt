What I had to flaunt  
Has come back to haunt  
Like a restless wind  
And the best of times  
That were left behind  
They come blowing in  
  
No ones pushing me through that door  
But it might as well be a fortyfour in the night  
  
Its too late to say goodbye  
Im all out of lies  
Its too late to say goodbye  
  
How can I resist  
One more strangers kiss  
Should the thrill be gone  
And if I must refrain  
Will I wind up the same  
As the jealous dogs  
  
From this day forward could be too long  
But crossing that border would be so wrong and youre right  
  
Its too late to say goodbye  
Ive run out of lies  
Its too late to say goodbye  
  
I know that youre right  
Its too late to say goodbye  
Im all out of lies  
Its too late to say goodbye  
This feeling wont die  
Its too late to say goodbye  
I cant watch you cry  
Its too late to say goodbye
