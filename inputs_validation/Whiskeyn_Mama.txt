Im so tired you on my head  
Whiskeyn mama you shouldnt have said  
You wanted me to be your lover true  
Then turn around and treats me just likes you do  
I should have known better than to fool with a whiskeyn mama  
  
Now I could be right and could be wrong  
You been layin out all night long  
You telephoned this mornin said youd be home soon  
The doorman said he seen you at the Club Blue Lagoon  
I should have known better than to fool with a whiskeyn mama  
  
Whiskeyn mama you standin there  
With your curly hair  
Just to have you do me good  
I know you could if you only would  
  
Whiskeyn mama you standin there  
With your curly hair  
Just to have you do me good  
I know you could if you only would  
  
Well the sun come shinin on the rain soaked street  
Whiskeyn mama where can she be  
I guess Ill have to put you down on my list  
I didnt want to do it but you insist  
I should have known better than to fool with a whiskeyn mama
