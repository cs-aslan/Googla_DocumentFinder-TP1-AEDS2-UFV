I do not trust so I cannot love  
cant no man be trusted  
Oh no no no  
And I would not dare to open up  
this life of yours is dusted Pink  
Well my rents past due and now my car wont start I hate the bus  
well arent you glad you have somebody to talk to  
Tell me what do they see when they look at me  
Do they see my many personalities  
  
Chorus  
Can you help me  
Does anybody hear me  
Can they even see me  
This is my reality oh oh  
  
can it be my turn now is it my turn Pink  
Said Ill say it again youre my only friend  
I protect you from the world I basically protect you from yourself  
Though I cant go on Im not satisfied with this being the end  
this is just the beginning  
Tell me why cant I just reach up and simply touch the sky  
Tell me why cant I spread my arms and fly and fly and fly  
Tell me why cant I say this why cant I do that  
Tell me what do they want from me tell me how to act  
  
Repeat Chorus 2x  
  
So Im putting it all on the table  
tell em Pink  
You dont know me well enough to label me sick or even disturbed  
When you break it down Im just two girls  
Trying to blend trying to vibe  
trying  
Trying to live just one life  
so hard  
Everybodys got insanitiesI got a split personality  
Tell me why cant I just reach up and simply touch the sky  
why cant you  
Tell me why cant I spread my arms and fly and fly and fly  
you can  
Tell me why cant I say this why cant I do that  
just do it  
Tell me what do they want from me tell me how to act  
I cant I cant  
  
Repeat Chorus 3x  
  
Can you help me  
talk to me talk to me dont ignore me I cant take it  
Do you hear me  
Do you see me everytime  
oh calm down its not that serious well be just fine without them  
Its all mineits my realityits just too much for me  
youre my friend youre my friendPinkPink
