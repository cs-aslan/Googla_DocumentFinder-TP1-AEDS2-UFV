Everybody said so man you could see it on TV  
They stood there ashamed with nowhere to go  
Nobody wants them now the kids are alright  
Every day is a holiday and pushin people around  
  
Im making monsters for my friends  
Im making monsters for my friends  
  
Someone caught one I could see so myself  
I had to call 254 so they wouldnt blame me  
We wanted to know how much trouble there was  
When we asked our daddy he said its just because  
  
Im making monsters for my friends  
Im making monsters for my friends  
  
I dont want to open a can of worms and  
I dont want any SpagettiOs  
And I could always tell when  
Someone is holding a grudge  
  
Im making monsters for my friends  
Im making monsters for my friends  
Im making monsters for my friends  
Im making monsters for my friends
