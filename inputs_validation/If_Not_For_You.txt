If not for you babe I couldnt even find the door  
I couldnt even see the floor  
Id be sad and blue if not for you  
  
If not for you babe the night would see me wide awake  
The day would surely have to break  
It would not be new if not for you  
  
Chorus  
If not for you my sky would fall rain would gather too  
Without your love Id be nowhere at all Id be lost if not for you  
  
If not for you the Winter would hold no Spring  
Couldnt hear a Robin sing  
I just wouldnt have a clue if not for you  
  
Chorus  
  
If not for you the Winter would hold no Spring  
You couldnt hear a robin sing  
I just wouldnt have a clue if not for you  
If not for you
