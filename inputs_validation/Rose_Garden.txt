I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden  
Along with the sunshine theres gotta be a little rain sometimes  
When you take you gotta give so live and let live or let go  
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden  
I could promise you things like big diamond rings  
But you dont find roses growing on stalks of clover so youd better think it
over  
When its sweet talking you could make it come true  
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter but what would it
matter  
So smile for a while and lets be jolly love shouldnt be so melancholy  
Come along and share the good times while we can  
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden  
  
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon  
But if thats what it takes to hold you Id just as soon let you go  
But theres one thing I want you to know  
You better look before you leap still water runs deep  
And there wont always be someone there to pull you out  
And you know what Im talking about  
So smile for a while and lets be jolly  
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden
