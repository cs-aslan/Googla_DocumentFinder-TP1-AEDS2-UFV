Boys watch from windows tonight  
Im not surpriesed to see you waiting here  
You keep them in business just supplying you  
Get in the car Ive something to say  
  
Stay in bed why waste my time  
Open your eyes but only if you can  
Office in a sidestreet is no place for you  
Night talk and romance like beat the clock  
  
Boys like me arent supposed to cry  
But its so easy to do  
Boys like me arent supposed to cry  
But just look at you  
Night talk  
  
Take things slow you can crack  
Like your face I dont understand  
How you smile and pretend its fun  
Do you laugh when the rats come round to play  
  
Boys like me arent supposed to cry  
But its so easy to do  
Boys like me arent supposed to cry  
But just look at you  
Night talk
