When you start to take a look within  
Do you feel at ease with what you see  
Do you think you can have peace of mind  
And have selfbelief or be satisfied  
  
Do you think you even like yourself  
Or really think you could be someone else  
Is there something that youd rather be  
Never thought youd be had the chance to see  
  
All my life Ive run away  
All my life Ive tried to hide away  
  
Fell the paranoia creeping in  
Like a cancer eating at the skin  
Do you feel youve lost your self esteem  
And your self respect what can you expect  
  
All my life Ive run astray  
Let my faith slip away  
All my life Ive run astray  
Allowed my faith to drift away  
  
Are you scared to look inside your mind  
Are you worried just at what youll find  
Do you really want to face the truth  
Does it matter now what have you got to loose  
  
Try to release the anger from within  
Forgive yourself a few immortal sins  
Do you really care what people think  
Are you strong enough to release the guilt
