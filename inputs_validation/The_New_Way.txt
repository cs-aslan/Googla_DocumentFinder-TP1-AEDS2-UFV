Youre alright youre alive youre the number one  
They said that youre not ashamed of what youve done  
Everyone makes mistakes  
Make it up youll be OK  
Thats what they tell you  
You wont get the special treatment  
I dont care what you do or say  
Dont let them tell you what youre already thinking  
Its a no win situation  
  
Well enough of the old way  
Its not working and the rules have already changed  
What we need is a new way  
Theres something else just a little bit better  
Its on the way  
  
Youre a drag youre a bore youre a rainy day  
You take offense to almost everything they do or say  
Everyone makes mistakes  
Make it up youll be OK  
I tried to tell you
