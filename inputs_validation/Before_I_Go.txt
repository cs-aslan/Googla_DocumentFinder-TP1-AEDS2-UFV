Life hurts so bad  
Dont want you sad  
Just look back to  
Good times we had  
Id give my soul for you I know  
Want to hold you before I go  
Before I go  
  
I need you to know  
Im still alive in you  
Its my time to go  
Dont stay up late  
Im not afraid  
  
And I dont want your heart to break  
I know Ive seen whats been unseen  
Live fast die young  
Its part of me  
Its my time now  
Before I go  
  
Its my time now  
My soul is on its way  
Its my time now  
I need you to know  
Before I go
