You hide your eyes  
But the ugly truth  
Just loves to give it away  
You gave yourself  
  
If you were mine to give  
I might throw it away  
You share but money cant give  
What the truth takes away  
Throw it away  
  
I painted my eyes  
Ugly isnt what I want to see  
I painted my mind  
Ugly isnt what I want to be  
  
I dont mind but the truth  
Dont look that good on me  
Throw it away  
  
I dont think I really  
Understand you  
And I cant see why  
Id ever want to  
  
And even if it isnt mine to say  
Ill say it anyway  
Its ugly  
  
If you were mine to give  
I might throw it away  
But money cant give  
What the truth takes away  
Throw it away
