I meant to call her name  
I meant to take her hand  
I meant to be the same and understand  
Just what was happening in the evening  
Between the princess and the prince  
  
I cant be bothered now  
And I cant eat or drink  
I cant remember how I used to think  
What was the song she sang before the morning rang  
Bringing the princess to the prince  
  
Its a crystal ringing way  
She has about her in the day  
But shes a laughing dappled shadow  
Shes a laughing dappled shadow in my night  
  
If I could hear her voice  
If I could see her face  
If I could have my choice Id be in the place  
Where I saw her last on the evening past  
Of the princess and the prince  
  
Its a crystal ringing way  
She has about her in the day  
But shes a laughing dappled shadow  
Shes a laughing dappled shadow in my night
