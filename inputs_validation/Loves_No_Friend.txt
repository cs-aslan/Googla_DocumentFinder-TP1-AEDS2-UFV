Well I dont need much  
But I need a friend  
Or did you got time for me  
Aint no trouble with youre always down  
To find a friend in misery  
But thats allright  
Thats allright  
Aint gonna fall for the line  
Thats allright  
Thats allright  
Dont need no sun to shine  
When loves no friend of mine  
Ive been so down Ive been on my knees  
Just dont seem to feel no pain  
Natural loser Ive been on the run  
Got no shelter from the rain  
Thats allright  
Thats allright  
Aint gonna fall for the line  
Thats allright  
Thats allright  
Dont need no sun to shine  
No cause loves no friend of mine  
Learn to live wether climb above my head  
Got no shame got no pride  
If you need affection  
Dont knock on my door  
Got no feelings left inside  
But thats allright  
Yes Thats allright  
Aint gonna fall for the line  
Thats allright  
Thats allright  
Dont need no sun to shine  
Cause loves no friend  
Cause loves no friend  
Ah no friend of mine  
Loves no friend of mine
