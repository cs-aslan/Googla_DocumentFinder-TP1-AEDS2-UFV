All over town theyre talking about me  
The whole world knows youre happy without me  
Youve broken my heart So what do I care  
Im thru with love no more will I need it  
The word itself Ill never repeat it  
A sign on my back I will wear This is my last love affair  
  
I gave my heart to you the one that I trusted  
You brought it back to me all broken and busted  
So I sold my heart to the junkman  
And Ill never fall in love again  
You took my heart because you thought you could use it  
Just like a little toy you battered and bruised it  
So I sold my heart to the junkman  
And Ill never fall in love again  
Like a melodrama in a simple manner  
Love played the leading part  
We had planned a happy ending  
But Im left with a broken heart  
Ill throw away my pride and say well be friends dear  
Tear drops I cannot hide for this is the end dear  
Ive sold my heart to the junkman  
And Ill never fall in love again
