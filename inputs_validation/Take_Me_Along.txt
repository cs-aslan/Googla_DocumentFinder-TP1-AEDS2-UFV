The city of angels is lonely tonight  
Keep myself alight by candlelight  
So she can love you like I do  
Look me in the eyes and say its true  
I ask myself is this love at all  
When I need you most you let me fall  
Im always here at the side of your stage  
Let you live your life  
Pretend Im okay dont you know  
Ill be okay  
Ill hold you close well stay forever  
  
I I dont understand why youre leaving me  
I I dont understand how without you I can breathe  
Please dont dont leave me here  
Take my hand and breathe in deep  
I dont understand why you cant take me with you  
  
You can pretend I dont exist  
But you will see my face every time you kiss  
I hope you heard any walls fall down  
When you hear the sound that Im okay dont you know  
Ill be okay  
You cant hold me down I will stay forever  
  
I I dont understand why youre leaving me  
I I dont understand how without you I can breathe  
Please dont dont leave me here  
Take my hand and breathe in deep  
I dont understand why you cant take me with you  
  
I watched you leave  
Im awake tonight  
And Im letting go for the last time  
And through the tears I say goodbye  
So breathe in breathe in breathe in breathe out  
  
I I dont understand why youre leaving me  
I I dont understand how without you I cant breathe  
Please dont dont leave me here  
Take my hand and breathe in deep  
I dont understand why you cant take me with you  
Dont leave me here  
Please dont leave me here  
I I dont understand  
How without you I can breathe  
Please dont dont leave me here  
Take my hand and breathe in deep  
I dont understand why how cant take me with you
