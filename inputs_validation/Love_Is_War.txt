Im a man  
Trying to understand  
The reason Im lost in this world  
Tonight  
I was blind  
I just couldnt see the signs  
Caught in your web of lies  
  
Its too dark to sleep  
Too late to pray  
Too hard to reach  
Too much to save  
  
You were once a friend to me  
Now you are my enemy  
Passion turns to hate and you make  
Hate worth fighting for  
I will rewrite history  
And you will not exist to me  
On the day you crossed the line  
I found out love is war  
  
Life goes by  
Faster than lightning strikes  
Crashes before you can say  
Goodbye  
  
Too scared to run  
Too proud to hide  
Too far to fall  
Too high to climb  
  
You were once a friend to me  
Now you are my enemy  
Passion turns to hate and you make  
Hate worth fighting for  
I will rewrite history  
And you will not exist to me  
On the day you crossed the line  
I found out love is war  
  
I laid down my defenses  
I opened up the door  
I gave you what you wanted  
I couldnt give you more  
And I gave you everything  
You said its all or nothing  
To you its just a game  
A game youre never losing  
  
You were once a friend to me  
Now you are my enemy  
Passion turns to hate and you make  
Hate worth fighting for  
I will rewrite history  
And you will not exist to me  
On the day you crossed the line  
I found out love is war  
You were once a friend to me  
Now you are my enemy  
Passion turns to hate and you make  
Hate worth fighting for  
I will rewrite history  
And you will not exist to me  
On the day you crossed the line  
I found out love is war  
Found out love is war
