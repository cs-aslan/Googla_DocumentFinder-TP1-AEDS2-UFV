Lucy jumped from the thirty ninth floor  
Said she just couldnt face another poor man  
Every juke box stuck on Whos next  
They almost got me when Jimmy said  
  
Lets get lost  
But were gonna fall  
A change of weather couldnt do you no harm  
Lets get lost  
Pick up your feet  
Dont tempt late boy get a pair of cheap skates  
  
Penny walked in with that love in vain look  
Said Every last man should be hangin from a meat hook  
She looked in my eye singin Marry me Bill  
I loosened my tie just as Jimmy said  
  
Lets get lost  
Go work on a farm  
A change of weather couldnt do you no harm  
Lets get lost  
Pick up your feet  
Dont tempt late boy get a pair of cheap skates  
  
And I was so depressed today  
Yeah I was so depressed today  
  
Bobby said Were goin to get rich quick  
You buy a brand new car you get automatic cash back  
Pick up a parkin lot no money down  
He was countin the cost just as Jimmy said  
  
Lets get lost  
Go work on a farm  
A change of weather couldnt do you no harm  
Lets get lost  
Pick up your feet  
Dont tempt late boy get a pair of cheap skates  
  
Get lost lets get lost  
Come on lets get lost  
Lets get lost  
Go buy a pair of cheap skates
