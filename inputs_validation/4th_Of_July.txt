Shes waitin for me  
When I get home from work  
Oh but things aint just the same  
She turns out the light  
And cries in the dark  
Wont answer when I call her name  
  
On the stairs I smoke a  
Cigarette alone  
Mexican kids are shootin  
Fireworks below  
Hey baby its the Fourth of July  
Hey baby its the Fourth of July  
  
She gives me her cheek  
When I want her lips  
But I dont have the strength to go  
On the lost side of town  
In a dark apartment  
We gave up trying so long ago  
  
On the stairs I smoke a  
Cigarette alone  
Mexican kids are shootin  
Fireworks below  
Hey baby its the Fourth of July  
Hey baby its the Fourth of July  
  
What ever happened I  
Apologize  
So dry your tears and baby  
Walk outside its the Fourth of July  
  
On the stairs I smoke a  
Cigarette alone  
Mexican kids are shootin  
Fireworks below  
Hey baby its the Fourth of July  
Hey baby Baby take a walk outside
