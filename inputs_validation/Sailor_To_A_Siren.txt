Long distance callin in the middle of a rainy night  
So much static hardly knew your voice  
An youve been cryin want me to love you like I did before  
Girl when it comes to you you know Ive got no choice  
  
You put a storm inside me I want to head for a safer harbor  
They all tell me I should give you up but no man coulda tried any harder  
Feels like an odyssey thats never gonna reach an end  
Every time I hear you callin me just want to feel you in my arms again  
  
Chorus  
Like a sailor to a siren like a moth to a flame  
I know your love might be the death for me but I run to you just the same  
Like a sailor to a siren nothings gonna keep us apart  
Crashin over the wreckage of all the sailors broken hearts  
  
Musta met you when we were livin in another time  
Had nothin but the jealous gods to point our way  
When men were sailors and a woman was a rocky shore  
Wailin like a siren leadin him astray  
  
I got another woman and I know you got another man  
They all tell me I should give you up but I dont think that any mortal can  
Feels like an odyssey thats never gonna reach an end  
Every time I hear you callin to me just want to feel you in my arms again  
  
Chorus  
  
Gonna abandon ship steal you from the cliff  
Take you to a place where the gods cant find us no more  
Let the sailors listen to the sirens if they dare  
Gonna be dancin on the water drownin in your yellow hair  
  
Chorus x2
