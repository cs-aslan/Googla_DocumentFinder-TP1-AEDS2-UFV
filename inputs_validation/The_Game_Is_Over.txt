The game is over  
Ah yeah  
Ah yeah  
  
Invincible  
Is what you think you are  
But youre just so typical  
Though you think that youre a star  
You act like  
Everyone revolves around you  
Baby you dropped the ball  
And now the game is through  
  
Cause you tried to play both sides  
You got caught up in your lies  
And now youre running  
Youre running out of time  
  
Chorus  
You played yourself Game over game  
But did you did you think  
That you could really find love from someone else  
Youre making moves  
Youre gonna lose you know  
You played yourself Game over game  
And now youre thinkin thinkin you can get one by me  
But youll never win but youll never win  
Try again  
cause the game is over  
  
Take it personal  
Cause I did  
When you cheated on me  
You may be beautiful  
But theres more  
That the eye can see  
Youre so predictable  
The way you calculate each move  
Heads I win  
Tails you lose  
Because you dont have  
The right to choose  
  
Cause you tried to play both sides  
You got caught up in your lies  
And now youre running  
Youre running out of time  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah  
Woo  
  
How could you think that  
You could do me like that  
Running behind my back  
How could you do me like that  
Now the game is over  
How could you think that you could do me like that  
And now you want me back  
How could you do me like that  
Now the game is over  
How could you think that you could do me like that  
Do me like that do me like that  
  
Chorus x2
