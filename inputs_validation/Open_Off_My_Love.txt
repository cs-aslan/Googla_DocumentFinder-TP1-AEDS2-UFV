Chorus  
Baby come with me  
I know I can set you free  
If you take this trip with me  
Youll be open off my love  
If only for one night  
  
I know I can make you mine  
Touch you in that place you like  
Youll be open off my love  
Take a moment to stop and think about  
The last time you felt like this  
Come on baby nobodys gonna see  
Cause I know youre feeling me  
I can see it in your eyes  
Aint no use in tryin to hide  
When I touch you get hot  
Then I got you where I want you  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont waste another moment  
Dont hold back  
Im gonna give you what you need  
Im gonna take you where you want to go  
On a trip to ecstasy  
I can see it in your eyes  
Aint no use in tryin to hide  
When I touch you get hot  
Then I got you where I want you  
  
Chorus  
  
I wanna be where he wants me to be  
When he wants me to be  
When he wants me  
Im gonna keep him feelin me  
Im gonna keep him wanting me  
I wanna be where he wants me to be  
When he wants me to be  
When he wants me  
Im gonna keep him up all night  
Im gonna keep it on his mind  
  
Chorus
