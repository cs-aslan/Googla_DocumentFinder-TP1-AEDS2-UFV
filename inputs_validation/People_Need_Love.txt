People need hope people need lovin  
People need trust from a fellow man  
People nee love to make a good livin  
People need faith in a helping hand  
  
Man has alway wanted a woman by his side  
To keep him company  
Women always knew that it takes a man to get  
Matrimony and harmony  
Everybody knows that a man whos feeling down  
Wants some female company  
Gotta have love to carry on living  
Gotta have love til eternity  
  
People need hope people need lovin  
People need trust from a fellow man

People need faith in a helping hand

Flowers in a desert need a drop of rain  
Like a woman needs a man  
If a mans in love and his woman wants the moon  
Then hell take it down if he can  
Somebody who loves you and somebody who cares  
Isnt that what you call a friend  
Gotta have love to carry on living  
Isnt it easy to understand
