I have so many talents  
Im afraid to show them  
People may not like them  
  
So theyre hidden  
Hidden within  
Where no one can hate them  
Or appreciate them  
  
I have so many dreams  
Im afraid to reveal them  
People may not accept them  
  
So theyre hidden  
Hidden within  
Where no one can kill them  
Or fulfill them  
  
I have so many beautiful thoughts  
Im afraid to share them  
People may ignore them  
  
So theyre hidden  
Hidden within  
Where no one can ignore them  
Or enjoy them  
  
I hate to hid  
I hide cause Im lonely  
I need someone who will expose me  
  
Is it you
