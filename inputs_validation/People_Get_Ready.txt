People get ready  
Theres a train a comin  
You dont need no baggage you just get on board  
All you need is faith  
To hear the diesel comin  
Dont need no ticket you just thank the Lord  
People get ready  
Train to Jordan  
Picking up passengers from coast to coast  
Faith is key  
Open the doors and board them  
  
Theres hope for all among the love the most  
There aint no room for the hopeless sinner  
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own soul  
Have pity on those whose choices grow thinner  
There aint no hiding place from the Kingdoms throne
