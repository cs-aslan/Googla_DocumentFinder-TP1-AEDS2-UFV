Theres trouble on the subway theres something on the track  
Theres a dead end waiting and we cant go back  
So take it to the highway head back and open wide  
Step right up and take a nowhere ride  
  
Its a nowhere road  
Its a nowhere road  
No matter where it goes  
Its a nowhere road  
Its a nowhere road and Im tired  
Its a nowhere job and Im fired  
It dont matter what they say  
You cant get there going this way  
From LA to Miami and all points in between  
Look outside you get the same old scene  
You take it to the highway  
You travel far and wide  
Caterpillars carving up the country side  
  
Its a nowhere road  
Its a nowhere road  
No matter where it goes  
Its a nowhere road  
Its a nowhere road and Im tired  
Its a nowhere job and Im fired  
It dont matter what they say  
You cant get there going this way  
  
Its a nowhere road and Im tired  
Its a nowhere road and Im tired  
Its a nowhere road and Im tired
