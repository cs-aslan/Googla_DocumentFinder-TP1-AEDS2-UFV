The first time I died  
Was in the arms of good friends of mine  
They kiss me with tears  
They hadnt been near me for years  
Say why do it now  
When I wont be around Im going out  
  
We needed you  
To love us too  
We wait for your move  
  
Only tragedy allows the release  
Of love and grief never normally seen  
I didnt want to let them see me weep  
I didnt want to let them see me weak  
But I know I have shown  
That I stand at the gates alone  
  
I needed you  
To love me too  
I wait for your move  
  
All the love all the love  
All the love we should have given  
All the love all the love  
All the love you could have given  
All the love all the love  
All the love  
Run for the hills  
  
The next time I dedicate  
My lifes work to the friends I make  
I give them what they want to hear  
They think Im up to something weird  
And up rears the head of fear in me  
So now when they ring  
I get my machine to let them in  
  
I needed you  
To love me too  
I wait for your move  
  
All the love all the love  
All the love you should have given  
All the love all the love  
All the love we could have given  
All the love all the love  
All the love
