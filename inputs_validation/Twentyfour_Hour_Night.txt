The day outside is warm the sun is shinin bright  
But since youre gone the time is wrong  
Its a twentyfour hour night  
My heart is filled with bloom my soul has lost its light  
I sit here in my lonely room its a twentyfour hour night  
My life is an endless torture cold and bare and black  
You know how much I want you  
Please please please come back  
Come back and take my heart come make this darkness bright  
Come back again and please please end  
These twentyfour hour nights twentyfour hour nights
