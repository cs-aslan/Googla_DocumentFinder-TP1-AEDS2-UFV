He was born in International Falls a long long time ago  
Moved to Tucumcan when the ironwork got show  
He was cornbread and hard scrabble and scratching for every dime  
Till he threw it in and he kilt the road to walk that endless line  
  
Now hes The Last Hobo  
Riding the last boxcar  
On the last freight train  
Leaving here  
  
Now hes The Last Hobo  
Riding the last boxcar  
On the last freight train  
Away from here  
  
He tried his hand at lots of jobs  
And he did em all with pride  
From shoeing mules to driving trucks  
He mastered what he tried  
It must have been Ramona  
She was all he cared about  
When she ran away and left him  
You could see the fire go out  
  
Now hes The Last Hobo  
Riding the last boxcar  
On the last freight train  
Away from here  
  
We hardly ever see him  
Once or twice and he would stay a day or two  
Hed ask about Ramona  
Then hed say that he was only passing through  
Now he knows every railroad bull along the right of way  
And every hobo jungle from New York to Santa Fe  
Hes looked for his Ramona on the far side of the hill  
Now his sun is sinking lower and hes looking for her still  
  
Now hes The Last Hobo  
Riding the last boxcar  
On the last freight train  
Leaving from here  
  
Now hes The Last Hobo  
Riding the last boxcar  
On the last freight train  
Away from here
