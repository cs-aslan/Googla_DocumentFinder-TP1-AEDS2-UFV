When youre fed up and lonely  
And nothing else seems to matter really  
  
Ill be here waiting for the  
Black cloud to leave you  
Ill be here to hold your hand  
When youre tired and lonely  
  
Chorus x2  
She cant eat  
She cant sleep  
Shes not well shes lonely again  
She cant breathe  
Shes in bed  
Shes in hell  
  
But shell never really be alone  
As long as Im beside her  
  
Hold your breath underwater  
And know youll rise to the surface slowly  
  
Think of me as a ship that might hold you  
Carry you to the shore  
When youre tired and lonely  
  
Chorus  
  
But shell never really be alone  
As long as Im beside her  
  
Chorus  
  
But shell never really be alone  
As long as Im beside her
