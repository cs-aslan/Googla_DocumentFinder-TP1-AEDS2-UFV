I saw them all around today  
They dont stop they wont go away  
They love the darkness in my eyes  
Help me find a way out when Im lost within myself  
  
They show me everything I need  
Theres nothing wrong with a little greed  
Never enough to satisfy  
Such a driving desire that burns inside  
  
My life came with its own scars  
I dont need you to tell me about your sorrow  
I cant say Ive seen it all  
But I live for the things that keep me hollow  
  
Everyday I look into the mirror  
Staring back I look less familiar  
Ive seen all seven faces  
Each one looks a lot like me  
  
They all look like me  
I never see them coming  
But they show me more of myself  
Drawn into the depths  
I never knew existed  
Launching me face first  
Into the pleasures of pure lust and greed  
I am becoming all things envied I am the excess  
I want it all more pain more sex more lies more of  
Everything
