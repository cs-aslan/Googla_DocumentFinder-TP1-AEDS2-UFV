You may be sweet and nice  
That wont keep you warm at night  
Cause Im the one who taught you how  
To do the things youre doing now  
He may feel all your charms  
He may hold you in his arms  
But Im the one who let you in  
I was right beside you then  
  
Once upon a time  
You let me feel you deep inside  
And nobody knew nobody saw  
Do you remember the way you cried  
  
Im your toy Im your old boy  
But I dont want no one but you to love me  
Oh I wouldnt lie  
You know Im not that kind of guy

Oh I wouldnt lie  
You know Im not that kind of guy
