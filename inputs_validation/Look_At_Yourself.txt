I see you running  
Dont know what  
Youre running from  
Nobodys coming  
Whatd you do that was so wrong  
  
Look back and turn back  
Look at yourself  
Dont be afraid just  
Look at yourself  
  
If you need assistance  
Or if all you need is love  
Theres no point in hiding  
Tell me what youre frightened of  
  
Youve got a friend just  
Look at yourself  
Dont be afraid just  
Look at yourself
