What did I do to deserve this  
Tell me the truth and dont lie  
Youre pretty good at that but no not this time  
You walk around like you run the world  
Running your mouth and talking about me now  
They think that youre the perfect girl  
Theyre gonna see everything so get back  
Its gonna come back around  
You know that this town is just too small and Im too strong to take this
again  
Your dressed to impress but I have got news  
You know youre just gonna lose  
Everything and everyone that means so much to you  
Im feeling bad for  
You are alone and nobody cares that you are  
One look into your eyes  
Easy to see what you could be but youre not  
I say its time that you give in  
Since it was real you cannot fulfill youre over  
You feel your heart beat deep down  
Ignoring the shame of causing this pain  
Just get out  
Its gonna come back around  
You know that this town is just too small and Im too strong to take this
again  
You dress to impress but I got news  
You know youre just gonna lose  
Everything and everyone that means so much to you  
Someway  
You keep hearing everything that people say  
And you cant take the pain another day  
Its coming back around  
I told you this town was just small  
You dress to impress but you can stop now  
Cuz its gonna come back around  
And around and around and around and around  
Yeah yeah  
Its gonna come back around  
You know that this town is just too small and Im too strong Too strong  
To take this take this again Whoa  
You dress to impress but Ive got news  
You know youre just gonna lose  
Everything and everyone that means so much to you
