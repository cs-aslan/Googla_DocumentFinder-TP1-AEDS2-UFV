Merely by chance  
Very unsuspecting  
You caught my heart  
Unprotecting me  
Now Ive fallen in love with you  
  
Just when I thought  
Life was free and easy  
You came along to me  
Soft and breezy  
Now Ive fallen in love with you  
  
Chorus  
And for the first time in my life  
I know what its like to be a happy man  
Happy man  
And for the first time in my life  
Youve given me something I cant understand  
Now that Im a happy man  
  
Be with me now  
Love me forever  
Leaving you lady  
Is something that Id never do  
Ive fallen in love with you  
  
All of my life it seems I have waited  
Now I can say all these words I have stated are true  
Ive fallen in love with you  
Ive fallen in love with you  
  
Chorus
