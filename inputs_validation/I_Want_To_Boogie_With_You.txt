Hey pretty baby  
Dont you think you might give me a chance  
Get it on with me  
Go downtown for some loving romance  
And I know I aint nothing  
I aint worth but a thin dime  
But if you put your heart in my hands  
Im sure that I could change your mind  
  
I want to boogie with you  
Yeah I want to boogie with you  
  
Theres something baby on which your parents  
Both agree  
And that is that they both have a  
Deep distrust for me  
And your best friend Frankie  
Well I know your best friend Frankie he wants to see me sink  
And I dont much blame him for that  
He gets so useless after so few drinks you know baby  
  
I want to boogie with you  
I want to boogie with you  
  
Well I know your little baby sister  
She thinks that Im a flop  
Well I guess that you know that its true  
I spent more time at the bottom than the top  
Tell your little sister  
I know she wants to give me a whirl  
But I dont have the time baby  
To wait till shes grown up and shes a woman not a girl  
  
Dont you know I want to boogie with you  
Hey I want to boogie with you  
I want to boogie with you  
I want to boogie with you yeah  
  
Boogie with you  
Down by the corner  
Well be able to yeah
