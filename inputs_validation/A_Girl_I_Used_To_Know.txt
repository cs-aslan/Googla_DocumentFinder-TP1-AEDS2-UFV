Theres a picture that I carry  
One we made some time ago  
If they ask whos in the picture with me  
I say just a girl I used to know  
  
Just a girl I used to go around with  
Just a friend from long ago  
I dont tell them how lost I am without her  
I say shes just a girl I used to know  
  
I say shes just another girl now  
Just a flame thats lost its glow  
And I say her name has slipped my mind now  
And shes just a girl I used to know  
  
Just a girl I used to spend some time with  
Just a friend from long ago  
I dont talk about the nights I cry without her  
I say shes just a girl I used to know  
  
Just a girl I used to know
