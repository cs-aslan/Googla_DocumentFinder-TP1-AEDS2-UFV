Youre so extreme youre super heavy  
Youre one step over the line  
Not what you seem dont try and tell me  
I know whats really on your mind  
  
Once you get started youre out of control  
Dont play that sweet and innocent with me girl  
I know you know you want to rock and roll  
But I got just what you need  
  
I I want to feel your love  
Too much is not enough  
I I want to feel your touch  
Too much is not enough  
  
Youve got it bad youre hopelessly addicted  
Youre always searching for the cure  
Love is the crime you stand convicted  
You keep on coming back for more  
  
Come on admit it youre over the top  
That song and dance wont work with me girl  
You just cant quit it dont know when to stop  
But I got the remedy  
  
I I want to feel your love  
Too much is not enough  
I I want to feel your touch  
Too much is not enough  
  
Baby stop wasting time  
And let me know that youre mine  
I need to feel your embrace  
How much can I take
