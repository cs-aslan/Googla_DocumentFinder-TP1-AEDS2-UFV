Hell is only half full  
Room for you and me  
Looking for a new fool  
Whos it gonna be  
Its the Dance of Shiva  
Its the Debutantes ball  
And everyone will be there  
Whos anyone at all  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Going to a party in the center of the earth  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Honey dont you want to go  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Going to a party in the center of the earth  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Honey dont you want to go  
Left eye right eye  
Take a look around  
Everybodys heading  
For a hole in the ground  
And its the Dance of Shiva  
Its the Twilight of the Gods  
Thunder and lightning  
Til the break of dawn  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Going to a party in the center of the earth  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Honey dont you want to go  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Going to a party in the center of the earth  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Honey dont you want to go  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Going to a party in the center of the earth  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Honey dont you want to go
