Grow up children dont you suffer  
At the hands of one another  
If you like a sleeping demon  
Listen can you hear him weeping  
Tears of joy and tears of sorrow  
He buys love to sell tomorrow  
  
My life aint no holiday  
Ive been through the point of no return  
Ive seen what a man can do  
Ive seen all the hate of a woman too  
  
Feel your heartbeat lose the rhythm  
He cant touch the world we live in  
Life is short but love is strong  
There lies a hope that I have found  
And if you try youll find it too  
Remember why Im telling you  
  
My life aint no holiday  
Ive been through the point of no return  
Ive seen what a man can do  
Ive seen all the hate of a woman too  
  
And they gave him away  
Like in Whistle Down The Wind  
By the look on his face  
He never gave in
