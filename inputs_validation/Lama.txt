Hes so compassionate  
Hes oh so kind  
All in peace he says  
All in time  
  
Hes wrapped in wisdom  
And wisdom he speaks  
So compassionate that I could freak  
  
Time is running out on him  
God is out to lunch  
Time is running out on his decision  
Every day that passes  
Proves that God has lost his glasses  
Or could it be that tears  
Have blurred his vision  
  
Hes so compassionate  
Hes oh so kind  
All in peace he says  
All in time  
  
Hes wrapped in wisdom  
From his head down to his feet  
So compassionate but oh so weak  
  
Time is running out on him  
God is out to lunch  
Time is running out on his decision  
Every day that passes  
Proves that God has lost his glasses  
Or could it be that tears  
Have blurred his vision  
  
Hes so compassionate  
Its all for their sake  
Well I dont know philosophy  
But I do know ache  
  
This ache is bigger  
Than words on TV  
So compassionate  
How can he be  
  
Now that time is running out on him  
God is out to lunch  
Time is running out on his decision  
Every day that passes  
Proves that God has lost his glasses  
Or could it be that tears  
Have blurred his vision
