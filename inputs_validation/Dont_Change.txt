Im standing here on the ground  
The sky above wont fall down  
See no evil in all direction  
Resolution of happiness  
Things have been dark  
For too long  
  
Dont change for you  
Dont change a thing for me  
  
I found a love I had lost  
It was gone for too long  
Hear no evil in all directions  
Execution of bitterness  
Message received loud and clear  
  
Dont change for you  
Dont change a thing for me  
  
Im standing here on the ground  
The sky above wont fall down  
See no evil in all directions  
Resolution of happiness  
Things have been dark for too long  
  
Dont change for you  
Dont change a thing for me
