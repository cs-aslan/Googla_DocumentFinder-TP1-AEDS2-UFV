You mercy taught us how to dance  
To celebrate with all we have  
And well dance to thank You for mercy  
Your glory taught us how to shout  
To lift Your name in all the earth  
And well shout to the praise of Your glory  
Its the overflow of a forgiven soul  
And now weve seen You God  
Our hearts cannot stay silent  
And well be a dancing generation  
Dancing because of Your great mercy Lord  
Your great mercy Lord  
And well be a shouting generation  
Shouting because of Your great glory Lord  
Your great glory Lord
