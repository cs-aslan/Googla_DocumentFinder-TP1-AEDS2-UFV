Lazy day Sunday afternoon  
Like to get your feet up watch TV  
Sunday roast is something good to eat  
Must be beef today cause lamb was last week  
  
So full up bursting at the seams  
Soon youll start to nod off happy dreams  
Wake up for tea and buttered scones  
Such a lot of work for you Sunday Moms  
  
Its such a crying shame  
Week after week the same  
  
Todays heavensent and youre feeling content  
You worked all week long  
Still its quite sad tomorrows so bad  
And I dont feel so strong  
  
Lazy day Sunday afternoon  
Like to get your feet up watch TV  
Sunday roast is something good to eat  
Now its almost over till week  
  
Thats how your life goes by  
Until the day you die
