There was a young girl  
Ridin on the wind  
She had all of the answers  
Didnt need to pretend  
I remember she was the only friend I ever needed  
  
Now I wonder  
How to work it all out  
My hands are tremblin  
Ive got this feelin now  
  
Theres a bit of thunder  
Pounding in my heart  
A little uncertainty  
Thats been there from the start  
Dont tell me all the look you gave  
Were the ones that I misread  
Cause all I hear now  
Is a voice inside my head  
  
Chorus  
Could this be love  
That I hear calling  
Could this be love  
That I hear calling  
  
Got a fast education  
Holding you in tears  
Someone finally hurt you  
After all these years  
Got to get my message to you somehow  
  
Now youre lookin in my eyes for courage  
Too late to think this through  
Baby  
There must be somethinbg we can do  
  
Theres a bit of thunder  
Pounding in my heart  
A little uncertainty  
Thats been there from the start  
Dont tell me all the look you gave  
Were the ones that I misread  
Cause all I hear now  
Is a voice inside my head  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a bit of thunder  
Pounding in my heart  
A little uncertainty  
Thats been there from the start  
Dont tell me all the look you gave  
Were the ones that I misread  
Cause all I hear now  
Is a voice inside my head  
  
Chorus
