Frida Now theres a shadow falling over our faces  
Doubt forever in our hearts  
And in a while well start to pick up the traces  
We wont find the missing parts  
  
Buy me a ticket Ill go to the Bahamas  
I need a rest from our petty little dramas  
Yes I really do  
Agnetha Frida Aha mm  
  
Now look what youve done  
Im missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha mm  
  
Its my turn to run  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Frida I wasnt ready for this kind of intrusion  
  
I was taken by surprise  
Now both of us are in a state of confusion  
Hesitation in our eyes  
Something unwanted has entered our existence  
  
I think its better to view it from a distance  
Yes I really do  
Agnetha Frida Aha mm  
Now look what youve done  
  
Im missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha mm  
Its my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha mm  
Now look what youve done  
  
Im missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha mm  
Its my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha mm  
Now look what youve done  
  
Im missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha mm  
Its my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha mm  
Now look what youve done  
  
Im missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha mm  
Its my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha mm  
Now look what youve done  
  
Im missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha
