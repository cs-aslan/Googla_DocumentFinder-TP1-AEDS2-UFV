Dolly Parton  
Hes a go getter go getter  
When his wife gets off from work hell go get her  
Now Ive got a neighbor that lives down the road a ways  
His wife holds down a steady job he dont turn his hand all day  
I know that most of you will know the kind Im talkin about  
The kind that rather than have to work hed rather do without  
But hes a go getter a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work hell go get her  
Theres a group of men in the court house yard any time that you go by  
Playin checkers and tradin odds and makin jokes about their wives  
They wait all week for pay day and they hold the moneys plenty  
And the wife thats worked those long hard hours never gets a penny  
But hes a go getter a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work hell go get her  
Yes hes a go getter a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work hell go get her  
Hes a go getter a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work hell go get her
