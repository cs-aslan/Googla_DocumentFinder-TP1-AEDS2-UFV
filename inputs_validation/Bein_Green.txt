Its not easy bein green  
Having to spend each day the color of the leaves  
When I think it could be nicer bein red or yellow or gold  
Or something much more colorful like that  
  
Its not easy bein green  
It seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things  
And people tend to pass you over  
Cause youre not standing out like flashy sparkles  
On the water or stars in the sky  
  
But green is the color of spring  
And green can be cool and friendly like  
And green can be big like an ocean  
Or important like a mountain or tall like a tree  
  
When green is all there is to be  
It could make you wonder why  
But why wonder why wonder  
I am green and itll do fine its beautiful  
And I think its what I want to be
