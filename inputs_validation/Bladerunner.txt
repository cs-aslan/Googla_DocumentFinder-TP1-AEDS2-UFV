Mother  
Mother  
Well as the city nights grow cold  
The lights jump through the shutters  
  
And a thousand echos fill the streets  
And bounce along the dirty gutters  
Out there  
I know that hes waiting for me  
  
Somewhere  
I know that hes waiting there for me  
I watched her falling to the ground  
And saw the glass go flying  
  
And inside her mind the fuse blew out  
But deep inside a voice was crying  
Out there  
I know that hes waiting for me  
  
Somewhere  
I know that hes waiting there  
Look out for the Bladerunner  
I thought I heard him calling you  
  
And now a silence fills the room  
I feel my heart start beating  
Cause inside the shadows there he stands  
Hes waiting on our final meeting  
  
Out there  
I know that hed waited for me  
Somewhere  
I know that hed waited there for me
