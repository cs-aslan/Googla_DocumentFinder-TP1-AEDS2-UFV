Hey wait a minute something just aint right hey wait a minute  
Somethings just not fair  
I was supposed to win the lottery  
Im supposed to be a millionaire  
Im supposed to be a worldwide tourist  
With lots of equity and life insurance  
Yes Im supposed to be a gold card member  
Rubbin elbows with the big time spenders  
Im supposed to be a wealthy man  
But all Ive got are blistered hands  
Hey wait a minute  
  
Hey wait a minute  
Theres got to be a better way  
Im workin twice as hard but gettin no richer  
Than I was yesterday  
Im supposed to drive a big mercedes  
Live in a mansion full of naked ladies  
Im supposed to own my own casino  
Be a superstar like sammy frank and dino  
Some day Im gonna be a big success  
And tell my boss to kiss my ass  
  
Hey wait a minute  
Something must be wrong  
Im supposed to be dining on caviar  
And drinking dom perignon  
Yes Im supposed to have open invitations  
To classy country clubs all across the nation  
Yes Im supposed to have jewelry and diamonds  
And a fifty foot yacht I can sail around the islands  
Im supposed to be so carefree  
But all Ive got is misery  
Hey wait a minute  
Somethings just not right
