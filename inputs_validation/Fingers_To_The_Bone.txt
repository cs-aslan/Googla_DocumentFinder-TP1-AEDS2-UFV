Everything went wrong  
Im sorry boys Ive got to  
Let you go  
Weve had some hard times and  
The long rain it didnt show  
Hired hands Ive seen them  
Come and go  
But you dont come much better  
Todays blue Monday I just got  
A bad news letter  
  
This day has come  
The darkest cloud on our horizon  
My hands are tied down to that  
Promise note I signed upon  
Always been this way  
Its the poor man who gets hurt  
All you ever work for is to leave  
Your footprints in the dirt  
  
You work your fingers  
To the bone  
  
The deed is done  
The fruit will fall  
To someone elses hand  
Thats how the land lies  
Now we all know where  
We stand  
Youll have to walk away  
Dont let them see you running  
Todays Blue Monday I should  
Have seen it coming  
  
You work your fingers  
To the bone  
  
If sweat and tears were  
All it took  
To make this valley green  
Wed be alright but now its  
Gone theyve taken everything  
They say its just an act of God  
And thats the way  
Ill wind blows  
Youve got thirty days  
To pack your bags  
Say goodbye hit the road  
  
You work your fingers to the bone
