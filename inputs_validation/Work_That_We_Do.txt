Well we realized so long long ago and I bet you  
That weve seen it all the lies wont get you  
Ive got fourteen miles to go  
Ive got rhythm comin sense Ive got the sto  
But I wont wanna come around our love So why  
If you are rich Im gonna hang you on the wall  
  
Ima find you  
And when I find you Im gonna get your lovin arms today  
So we fight to get we fight to get our weary arms to bed  
Real loves something that I still hope people make there own places to go  
And now in 94 were gonna lie some more  
In 1994 were going to die some more  
It it ever going to be the last show  
Its going to be the last drive  
Boss to proud to make the cars that we drive  
The women dont mind Ive got ample time  
They dont wonder why that they do  
  
Thats work that we do a work that we do is work that we do
