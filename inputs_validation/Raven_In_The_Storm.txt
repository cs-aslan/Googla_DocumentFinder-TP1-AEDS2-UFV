Im the latest apparition  
Cutting slices in the night  
I come through without permission  
Moving in and out of human sight  
Im the tapping on your shoulder  
I am the raving in the storm  
Ill take shelter in you rafters  
Im the shiver when youre warm  
Im the gold in california  
I am the well in mexico  
Like the vultures in the valley  
I will wait for you to go  
Im the gypsy in you pocket  
I am the horseman in your dreams  
Im the reason dogs are barking  
I am the hand that stops the scream  
I am the babys cry that isnt  
I am the distant relative  
Im the scratching in the ceiling  
I am advice you shouldnt give  
Im the ghost of a travelling salesman  
My foot will be there in your door  
Though I can walk through walls and windows  
I will knock just like before  
I am the darkness in your daughter  
I am the spot beneath the skin  
I am the scarlet on the pavement  
I am the broken heart within  
I wont take a train to nowhere  
I will not touch just anyone  
Ask a stranger why Im waiting  
In the chamber of a gun
