Im through the place where I dont know my name  
Its a world for the lonely go insane  
Ive brought along the little pieces of me he left behind  
Got no place to go but crazy out of my mind  
Ive got no place to go but crazy out of my mind over baby  
Hes the last thing I remember that I wont forget in time  
Got no place to go but crazy out of my mind  
  
Ive watched him leave with hurt clear out of sight  
And from that day on my mind just dont work right  
What a little sence left in me Ill leave here in this wine  
Got no place to go but crazy out of my mind  
Ive got no place to go
