I brush my teeth and look in the mirror  
And laugh out loud  
As Im beaming from ear to ear  
Id rather pick flowers instead of fights  
And rather than flaunt my style Id flash you a smile  
Of clean pearly whites  
  
Ive been to the dentist a thousand times so I know the drill  
I smooth my hair  
Sit back in the chair  
But somehow I still get the chills  
  
Have a seat he says pleasantly  
As he shakes my hand and practically laughs at me  
Open up nice and wide he says peering in  
And with a smirk he says dont have a fit  
This will just pinch a bit  
As he tries not to grin  
  
When hygienists  
Leave on long vacations  
Thats when dentists scream and  
Lose their patience  
  
Talking only brings the toothaches on because  
I say the stupidest things  
So if my results go south I swallow my pride with an aspirin and shut my
mouth  
  
Golf and alcohol dont mix  
And thats why I dont drink and drive  
Because good grief  
Id knock out my teeth  
And have to kiss my smile goodbye  
  
Ive been to the dentist a thousand times  
So I know the drill  
I smooth my hair  
Sit back in the chair  
But some how I still get the chills
