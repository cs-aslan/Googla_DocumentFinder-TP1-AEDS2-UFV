Pardon me you left your tears on the jukebox  
And Im afraid they got mixed up with mine  
I dont mean to pry its just that I  
Noticed you goin out of your mind  
It looks like were two of a kind  
  
Chorus  
Lets fall to pieces together  
Why should we both fall apart  
Lets fall to pieces together  
Right here in each others arms  
  
Alone is much better together  
When the worst is still yet to come  
So lets share the rest of the tears that are left  
From two hearts that just came undone  
Why should we go crazy alone
