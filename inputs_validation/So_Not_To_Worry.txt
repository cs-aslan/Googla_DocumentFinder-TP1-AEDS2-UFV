You think shes really waiting  
I heard a different tune  
Youll let her think he wants her  
And I think she wants him too  
What she dont know wont hurt her  
Shes got her secrets too  
She doesnt know about me  
The feelings up to you up to you  
So not to worry  
Dont be afraid not tonight  
Its all the same love  
Im in no hurry and  
If we make love its alright  
Alright tonight  
Alright tonight  
Bring back the day I met you  
We knew it then my love  
You smiled goodbye then told me  
That your time was not your own  
I see you five years later  
Two thousand miles away  
You left her for a mission  
And I left him for the same  
For the same  
So not to worry  
Dont be afraid not tonight  
Its all the same love  
Im in no hurry and  
If we make love its alright  
Well well well well

So much for being faithful  
Weve let them down again  
I wasnt very helpful  
And you didnt stop my hand  
Stop my hand oh  
So not to worry  
When we made love it felt right  
Its all the same love all the same oh
