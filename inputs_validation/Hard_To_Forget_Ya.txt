Verse 1  
All my life they told me bout a creature so hypnotic  
But I guess I never thought it was true Yeah  
And now that Ive seen you Ive turned into a believer  
Baby so much for what I thought Id do Yeah  
  
PreChorus  
Since I tasted you I got a craving  
Shaking in the heat of the night  
Oh yeah baby you got me misbehaving  
And I dont even know what is right  
Chorus  
Its just so hard to forget ya  
Its just so hard to forget ya  
Its just so hard to forget ya  
Its just so hard to forget ya  
Its just so hard to forget ya  
Its just so hard to forget ya  
Theres just something about ya  
Something about ya  
Its hard to forget ya  
Were stuck here forever  
Something about ya bout ya  
Something about ya  
Its hard to forget ya  
Were stuck here forever  
Something about ya

Eyes locked on your body sexy features so iconic  
And I just cant keep my fingers away no  
Your love got me faded  
Keep it going lets get wasted  
Baby so much for my poker face oh

Shaking in the heat of the night  
Oh yeah baby you got me misbehaving  
And I dont even know what is right

Ah theres something bout you

When I think about it  
Nobody can do it as good
