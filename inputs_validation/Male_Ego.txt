Male ego walking down the street  
Sees something looking hot and sweet  
Hey baby would you like to meet me tonight  
Male ego is a worldwide game  
We love the ladies more than wealth and fame  
Lots of girls running through my brain tonight  
Male ego is played by all  
Chasing ladies and having a ball  
Hey girl Im gonna give you a call tonight  
Dont know why we love to chase those tasty ladies  
Betcha boys well be doing it in our eighties  
Male egos like a game of chance  
The gamble starts with just a glance  
Youre off and running with a new romance tonight  
Male ego wont ever quit  
It seems to me from where I sit  
We oughta do our bit to capture it tonight
