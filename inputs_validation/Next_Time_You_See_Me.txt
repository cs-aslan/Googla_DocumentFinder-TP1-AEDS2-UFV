Next time you see me things wont be the same  
Next time you see me things wont be the same  
If it hurts you my darling you only got yourself to blame  
  
Well its true true saying all that shines is not gold  
Well its true true saying all that shines is not gold  
Like the good book says you gotta reap what you sow  
  
Well you lied cheated whoa for so long  
Well you lied cheated whoa for so long  
You were wrong to do it woman and another queen is on your throne  
  
Next time you see me things wont be the same  
Next time you see me things wont be the same  
If it hurts you my darling you only got yourself to blame  
  
Well its true true saying all that shines is not gold  
Well its true true saying all that shines is not gold  
Like the good book says you gotta reap what you sow
