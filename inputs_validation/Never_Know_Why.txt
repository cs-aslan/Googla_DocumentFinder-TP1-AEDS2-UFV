If were offensive and pose a  
Threat  
You fear what we represent is  
A mess  
Youve missed the message  
That says it all  
And youll never know hy  
Oh no youll never know why

Its just a feeling how we  
Excite  
You cannot rule everybody in  
Sight  
But you condemn dont  
Understand  
And youll never know why  
Oh no youll never know hwy  
  
We rock rock rock  
We rock rock rock  
We rock rock rock  
Youll never know why  
We rock  
  
I leave you cold and in disgust  
Dont try to tame me youll eat  
My dust  
I know that you know not what  
You do  
Thats why youll never know  
Why  
Oh no youll never know why  
We rock rock rock

We rock rock rock  
Youll never know why  
We rock rock rock

Youll never know why
