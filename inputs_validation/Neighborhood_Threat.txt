Down where your paint is cracking  
Look down your backstairs buddy  
Somebodies living there and  
He dont really feel the weather  
And he dont share your pleasures  
No he dont share your pleasures  
Did you see his eyes  
Did you see his crazy eyes  
And youre so surprised he doesnt run to catch your ash  
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash  
And you cant help him no one can  
And now that he knows  
Theres nothing to get  
Will you still place your bet  
Against the neighborhood threat  
  
Somewhere a babys feeding  
Somewhere a mothers needing  
Outside her boy is trying  
But mostly he is crying  
Did you see his eyes  
Did you see his crazy eyes  
And youre so surprised he doesnt run to catch your ash  
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash  
But you cant help him no one can  
And now that he knows  
Theres nothing to get  
Not in this place  
Not in your face  
Will you still place your bet  
Against the neighborhood threat Repeat x2
