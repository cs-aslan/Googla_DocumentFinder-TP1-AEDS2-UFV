If you are tryin to screw me baby  
Take my advice  
Opportunity baby never knocks twice  
If you are tryin to fool me baby  
Dont play around  
cause when I get to you baby  
I wont make no sound

Ill be creepin baby  
  
Ill hold you in my arms  
Like nobody else  
And when I know were apart  
I wont take no less  
  
Take all you things and move far away  
Take all your furs and rings baby  
But dont you sing hurray  
You can change your address  
But you wont get far  
Dont make no difference wherever you are

And Ill be creeping round your door  
  
Ill hold you in my arms like nobody else  
And when I know we are apart I wont take no less  
  
Ill hold you in my arms like nobody else

Take all your diamond rings now baby  
But dont you sing hurray  
You can change your address  
But you wont get far  
Dont make no difference baby wherever you are  
Yeah cause Ill be creepin round your door
