Cut me down the middle  
Fucked me up a little  
You said I was your queen  
I tried to give you everything  
And now you want your freedom  
  
You got just what you came for  
A bit of fame and fortune  
And Im no longer needed  
  
You said it was over wanted it to end  
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends  
  
You had a few secrets  
I was never told  
Now everyones talking  
And Im the last to know  
  
Chorus  
Now Im in the middle of heartbreak city  
Cause Im in the middle of a world not pretty  
Your clever game got the best of me  
But you aint gonna get the rest of me  
Cause Im in heartbreak city  
  
Tore me into pieces  
Didnt have no damn reason  
I let you in my house  
You helped yourself to everything  
And left me with your mess  
  
I curse the day we met  
The memory is haunting me  
I wish I could forget  
  
You said it was over wanted it to end  
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends  
  
You had a few secrets  
I was never told  
Now everyones talking and Im the last to know  
  
Chorus  
Im in the middle of hearbreak city  
Now Im in the middle of a world not pretty  
Im in the middle of hearbreak city  
Cause Im in the middle of a world not pretty  
Your clever game the best of me  
But you aint gonna get the rest of me  
Cause Im in heartbreak city  
  
Outro  
And its not that pretty  
And I still feel shitty
