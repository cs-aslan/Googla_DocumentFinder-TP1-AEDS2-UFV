I would really like to know you better  
But sometimes Im afraid that its not meant to be  
I would like to believe in something higher  
But I cant get a grip on all the little things  
  
When the night comes I cannot sit still you see  
And the years they have not been so kind to me  
Got a gallery of figures standing all in a row  
And every single figure has a soul of its own  
But I never look back  
Never look back  
Dont turn your back on me  
  
Chorus  
Hey yeah My life has come unraveled again  
Like so many threads  
Hey yeah my life has begun unfolding  
In so many pieces  
Hey yeah my life has come unraveled again like  
So many threads in the wind  drift away  drift away  
  
Theres a time and a place  
For understanding  
And a time when action speaks louder than words  
And I dont seem to get no indications  
And I dont know how to get through to you  
And when time like the pyramids  
Has worn away  
All the mountains and the valleys  
Of the words that we say  
  
We have got to make sure that something remains  
If we lose each other weve got no one to blame  
So never look back  
Never look back  
Dont turn your back on me  
  
Chorus
