If I had to lose a mile  
If I had to touch feelings  
I would lose my soul  
The way I do  
  
I dont have to think  
I only have to do it  
The results are always perfect  
And thats old news  
  
Would you like to hear my voice  
Sprinkled with emotion  
Invented at your birth  
  
I cant see the end of me  
My whole expanse I cannot see  
I formulate infinity  
Stored deep inside me  
  
If I had to lose a mile  
If I had to touch feelings  
I would lose my soul  
The way I do  
  
I dont have to think  
I only have to do it  
The results are always perfect  
And thats old news  
  
Would you like to hear my voice  
Sprinkled with emotion  
Invented at your birth  
  
I cant see the end of me  
My whole expanse I cannot see  
  
x2  
I formulate infinity  
Stored deep inside me
