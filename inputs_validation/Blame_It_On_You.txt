Shes got pizazz  
Like a razzmatazz  
Id like to slide it in  
But where do I begin  
  
Wastes all my money  
Spends all my time  
I aint got no luck  
Cant change her mind  
  
Blame it on you  
I cant stand up  
Blame it on you  
Im keepin my mouth shut  
Blame it on you  
I cant see straight  
Blame it on you  
Uhoh too late  
  
I want a little reaction  
How bout a kiss or two  
She said Jump back honey  
I said no can do  
  
Why do you always make a fool out of me  
I cant get no nookie  
Just plain to see  
  
Wastes all my money  
Spends all my time  
I aint got no luck  
Cant change her mind  
  
Blame it on you  
I cant get no sleep  
Blame it on you  
Im in six feet deep  
Blame it on you  
Well I guess its true  
Blame it on you  
Yes I do  
  
I blame this whole damn mess honey  
Right on you  
  
Now listen little girl let me explain  
Why you got me in such a terrible way  
Shes got pizazz  
Like a razzmatazz  
Id like to slide it in  
But where do I begin  
  
Blame it on you  
I cant get no sleep  
Blame it on you  
Im in six feet deep  
Blame it on you  
Well I guess its true  
Blame it on you  
Yes I do
