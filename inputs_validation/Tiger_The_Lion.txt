This is Tiger the Lion  
Gimme the Knuckles of Frisco  
If theres danger in the language  
Gentlemen  
I suggest no further use of  
The twoway radio  
John Cage had come to feel  
That art in our time  
Was far less important  
Than our daily lives  
To which so manyd become  
More or less inclined  
The purpose of its not unique  
Not to build masterpieces  
For a delectative elite  
But simply to wake to your life  
  
Youll be serving the song  
When you find out you wont change  
Serving the song  
Walking the range  
  
John Cage had come to feel  
Art in our time  
Was much less important  
Than our daily life  
If theres a perpetual plan  
For discovery days  
Where everyone can take part  
In what he called  
Purposeless play  
And theres a sign of life in this play  
Not to get order from chaos  
Tell you how to create  
But simply to wake to your life  
  
Youll be serving the song  
When we find out you wont change  
Serving the song  
Bombing the range  
  
This is Tiger the Lion  
Get me Into the Pillows  
If youre painted by radar gentlemen  
Therell be no further use of  
The twoway radio
