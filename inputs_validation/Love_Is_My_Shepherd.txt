When love is my shepherd  
And he leads me down  
To where troubled water  
Sprung up from the ground  
  
I found the answer  
Now it seems so clear  
When I see your face  
I cant help but trace  
That love is my shepherd  
When you are here  
When you are here  
  
Ive lived with the darkness  
Ive been through the mill  
I craved the attention  
Then choked on the thrill  
  
I found the answer  
I saw it in your eyes  
So sweet the surprise  
Now I can see  
That love is my shepherd  
Now youre here with me  
Now youre here with me  
  
Today new horizons  
Are filled with a joy  
Towards them I travel  
With hope to employ  
And Ive been seduced  
  
By failure and pride  
Love is the answer inside  
  
My future looks faithful  
My prayers have been heard  
And love is the reason  
I carry the word  
  
The word is excitement  
This feeling is great  
Ill carry that weight  
Now Im set free  
And Love is my shepherd  
Now youre here with me  
Now youre here with me  
And Love is my shepherd  
Now youre here with me
