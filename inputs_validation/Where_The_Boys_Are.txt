Where the boys are someone waits for me  
A smilin face a warm embrace  
Two arms to hold me tenderly  
Where the boys are my true love will be  
Hes walkin down some street in town  
And I know hes lookin there for me  
  
In the crowd of a million people  
Ill find my valentine  
And then Ill climb to the highest steeple  
And tell the world hes mine  
  
Till he holds me I wait impatiently  
Where the boys are where the boys are  
Where the boys are someone waits for me  
  
Till he holds me I wait impatiently  
Where the boys are where the boys are  
Where the boys are someone waits for me
