Alright  
I know your wheels are turning got your fire burning  
I know your hearts as cold as stone  
Youre covered in abuses dripping with excuses  
I know you got a lover at home  
  
But youll come here to me time after time  
Youll go down on your knees  
Yeah girl I can read your mind  
Because were partners in crime partners in crime  
  
Your going empty handed smiling like a bandit  
Knocking on my window each night  
Youre sweeter than a beauty queen darker than a limousine  
Need me cause I feel right  
  
Yeah when its sink or its swim and the temperature flies  
You get your body so close and lay it all on the line  
Because were partners in crime partners in crime  
Because were partners in crime ooh yeah  
  
When its sink or swim and the tales thats youre blind  
You get your body so close and lay it all on the line  
Because were partners in crime partners in crime  
Ooh yeah because were partners in crime  
Because were partners in crime  
Partners in crime partners in crime  
Lets go ha
