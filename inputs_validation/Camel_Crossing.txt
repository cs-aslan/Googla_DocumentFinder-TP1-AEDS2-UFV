In a dream of a desolate land  
Finding my feet on the wide white sand alone now  
Shot down in apathy during the war  
Never been north of the wise old Thames before  
  
Muslims and Christians lions and tigers  
Bombers and fighters  
Harder than theyve seen before  
  
Any god that weve needed in time  
Stormed out the door and he slammed it shut behind  
  
When I leave is not important  
And when I die Ill die alone  
And when I see my camel crossing  
Ill know Ive found myself back home  
  
My Legionnaire of today took all the food and he ran away just laughing  
Its never too late he said  
Out of his head as he walked towards the sun  
  
Round him   
Slumped into the ground a cross upon his back  
Then we decided heavens a stranger away in a manger  
Never too big for the sack  
  
When I leave is not important  
And when I die Ill die alone  
And when I see my camel crossing  
Ill know Ive found myself back home  
  
Cultured by con men  
Fathered by fools  
Commerce is good business these days  
Compulsory waste in our schools  
  
He died to convince us all  
Nothing could make us fall but thats not true  
So I know myself I know myself  
Its now or never  
  
When I leave is not important  
And when I die Ill die alone  
And when I see my camel crossing  
Ill know Ive found myself back home
