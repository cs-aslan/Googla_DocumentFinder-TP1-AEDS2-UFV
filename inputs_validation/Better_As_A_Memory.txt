I move on like a sinners prayer  
Letting go like a levee breaks  
Walk away as if I dont care  
Learn to shoulder my mistakes  
Im built to fade like your favorite song  
I get reckless when theres no need  
Laugh as your stories ramble on  
Break my heart but it wont bleed  
My only friends are pirates its just who I am  
Im better as a memory than as your man  
  
Im never sure when the truth wont do  
Im pretty good on a lonely night  
I move on the way a storm blows through  
I never stay but then again I might  
I struggle sometimes to find the words  
Always sure until I doubt  
Walk a line until it blurs  
Build the walls too high to climb out  
Im honest to a fault its just who I am  
Im better as a memory than as your man  
  
I see you lean in youre bound to fall  
I dont wanna be that mistake  
Im just a dreamer nothing more  
You should know it before it gets too late  
  
Cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel  
You never know where theyre gonna land  
First youre spinning then youre standing still  
Left holding a losing hand  
One day youre gonna find someone  
Right away youll know its true  
That all of your seekings done  
Was just a part of the passing through  
Right there in that moment  
Youll finally understand  
That I was better as a memory than as your man  
Better as a memory than as your man
