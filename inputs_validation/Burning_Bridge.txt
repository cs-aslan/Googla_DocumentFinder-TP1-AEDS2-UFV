Come close to me  
Come cross the bridge  
I need to know what you have to say to me  
Weve been waiting all night long  
What have you got to say to me  
Weve been waiting all night long  
Tell me all about it  
Weve been waiting  
Tell me please  
Weve been waiting  
Oh I know  
  
I know it works for me  
As we cross the bridge  the burning bridge  
With flames behind us  
We front the line  
Its you and me baby against the world  
  
Weve been waiting  
Ive got to know what you have to say  
Weve been waiting  
What have you got to say  
Weve been waiting  
Oohohoh  
Weve been waiting  
Tell me all about it  
Weve been  
All night long  
Weve been  
All night long  
Weve been  
  
It works for me  
Its you and me babe against the world  
All night long  
It works for me  
Lets cross the bridge  
Oh I know  
Weve been waiting  
I know I know  
Weve been  
Its you and me babe  
When you stand next to me babe its all right  
Its you and me babe against the world
