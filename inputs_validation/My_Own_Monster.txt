I turn my head  
Theres nothing there  
All I own is my thoughts  
For my fears  
I close the door  
To keep out the bad  
I plug my ears  
To keep out these fears  
  
And I cry  
  
So hold me close  
For Im so tired  
Of holding myself  
So very tired  
And tired  
Tired and tired  
Just hold me  
Repeat  
  
I listen to these voices  
Or is it this house  
Thats giving me chills  
As I lie upon  
This little girls bed  
Whos at the door  
Whos walking near  
Or has  
My imagination spilled  
This little girl  
All grown up still fears  
  
Oh and I cry  
  
Chorus2x  
  
Where can I go  
Where can I hide  
From these evil sufferings  
Oh these images  
Painted on my walls  
They say theres a place  
That I can hide  
In the shadow of your wings  
Oh Lord bring me  
To this place of refuge  
  
No more tears  
  
Chorus4x
