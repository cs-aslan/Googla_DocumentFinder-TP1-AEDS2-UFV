Theres some kinda love  
And theres some kinda hate  
The maggots in the eye of love  
Wont copulate  
  
And its a whoah oh oh oh oh  
And its a whoah oh oh oh oh  
And its a whoah oh oh oh oh  
I said whoah whaoh oh oh oh oh  
  
Hear the cats cry  
Liitle tortured babies in pain  
Cracked necks by sttled limbs  
They dont hesitate  
  
And its a whoah oh oh oh oh  
Baby whoah oh oh oh oh  
And its a whoah oh oh oh oh  
I said whoah whoah oh  
  
Theres some kinda love  
And there is some kinda hate  
Im gonna tell you all about it now  
The maggots in the eye of love wont copulate  
  
And its a whoah oh oh oh oh  
Baby whoah oh oh oh oh  
Baby whoah oh oh oh oh  
I said whoah whoah oh whoah oh
