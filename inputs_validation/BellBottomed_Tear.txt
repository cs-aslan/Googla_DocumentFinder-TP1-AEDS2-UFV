This is the dinner prepared  
This is the dress that I made  
This is the child I brought up  
And this is the woman you laid  
This is the woman you laid  
This is the perfume I wore  
This is the hotel we stayed  
This is the way that I lay  
And this is the woman you laid  
This is the woman you laid  
We promise ourselves this is no onenight stand  
Let us draw all the curtains and strike up the band  
And Im thrilled by gentlest touch of your hand we pretend  
Theres a tear theres a tear  
Not through confusion through fear through fear  
This is the smile that I wore  
This is the song that we played  
This is the way that I lay  
And this is the woman you laid this is the woman you laid  
Next morning our eyes filled with sleepy regret  
A kiss and goodbye and a long cigarette  
But the pillow I lay on is cold and its wet  
Cant pretend  
Its a tear its a tear  
Not through confusion through fear through fear  
And knowing at least that love came so near  
Just adds to the weight of this bell bottomed tear  
Roll out the red carpets and unplug the phone  
Root out the photos youve already shown  
cause this is one night you wont sleep alone  
Just one night  
Theres a tear theres a tear  
Not through confusion through fear through fear  
And knowing at least that love came so near  
Just adds to the weight of this bell bottomed tear  
Theres a tear theres a tear  
Not through confusion through fear  
Not through confusion through fear
