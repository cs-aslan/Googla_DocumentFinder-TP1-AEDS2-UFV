  
Blink and you miss a beat  
  
Keep one of your eyes open at all times  
Think that youre on the brink  
The shit hasnt even begun to hit the fan  
Consequence youll see will be stranger than a gang of drunken mimes  
Situation has a stink  
Better clear the air before your son becomes a man  
  
Blink  
  
Everythings been augmented  
Youve been left so far behind  
Think for sure next time you should wear a pair of eyes in the back of your  
head  
Consequence youve seen has been stranger than scifi of any kind  
Situation baffles me  
I guess its true you are too one of the walking dead  
  
You better think fast  
Cause you never know whats comin around the bend  
You better not blink  
For consequence is a bigger word than you think  
Its bigger than you and me
