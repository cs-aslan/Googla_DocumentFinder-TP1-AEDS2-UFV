Im hanging around that same old scene  
My girlfriend Betsy shes just fourteen  
Theres nothing better for me to do  
Im living on dog food  
  
Dog food is so good for you  
It makes you strong and clever too  
Dog food is a current craze  
Eat some every day  
  
I chew up my Sunday Mirror  
I read about the rich I fear  
Dog food is my whole life  
Dog food composes my wife  
  
Yum yum yum  Woof woof woof  Arf arf
