Chorus  
Im callin  
Out to  
All my  
Yall my ladies and I cant  
Let you  
Be with no one but me baby  
  
Gotta admit to this little addiction  
To the ladies and they just cant fix him  
Conversation and the drinks start mixin  
And Im a champ like the Detroit Pistons  
  
I tried to contain myself  
But I cant restrain myself  
I can only blame myself  
Maybe I need to get some help  
  
So what can I do  
Its so hard to chew  
This ones for you  
Yeah all of you  
  
Chorus  
Im callin  
Out to  
All my  
Yall my ladies and I cant  
Let you  
Be with no one but me baby  
  
The startin five how do I pick them  
I came up with this rating system  
I think about how it feels when I kiss them  
And when Im gone do I truly miss them  
Well baby you made the team  
Now go cook my favorite things  
Some greens and some chicken wings  
Tastes so good that you make me wanna sing  
  
So what can I do  
Its so hard to chew  
This ones for you  
Yeah all of you  
  
Chorus x2  
Im callin  
Out to  
All my  
Yall my ladies and I cant  
Let you  
Be with no one but me baby  
  
Im callin  
Out to  
All my  
Yall my ladies and I cant  
Let you  
Be with no one but me baby
