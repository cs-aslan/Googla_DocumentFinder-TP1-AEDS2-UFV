Out last night in my Sunday stripes  
You didnt want to know me  
At the Tuesday hop if I wear drainpipes  
You say youre gonna throw me  
The way you treat mes frightening  
Strike me down like lightning  
You know its a shame  
You didnt want to know  
Its a game  
You say youre gonna throw me  
Out of town theres a story round  
Youre staying with another  
At the picture show so the rumor goes  
Youve been playing with my brother  
I dont know where Im standing  
You give me such a bumpy landing  
Its a shame  
Youre staying with another  
Its a game  
Youve been playing with my brother  
Getting a bad reaction  
Chasin my girls best friend  
Wonder should I walk on home  
Plan a breakup or shake hands and make up again  
Its a shame  
Its a game  
Its a a shame its a game  
Its a shame its a game
