Well take a taxi to the show  
We could report by phone  
We could remind ourselves that  
We must laugh  
  
Reconsider fame  
I need new reasons  
This is detention its not fun at all  
  
Chorus  
Remind me to smile  
You know the old friends line  
It gets so I feel like  
Im in this cold glass cage  
  
Ive got the horrors  
Check over my shoulder  
I punch the air and fight but  
Noones there  
  
You you oh no  
Old scars dont show  
We fall you see  
Crawl crawl in love  
I dive so clean  
Young things dont scream  
Toys toys so far  
Boys boys you are  
  
Chorus  
  
Get off the car  
Get off the phone  
Move from my window leave me alone  
  
Keep your revivals  
Keep your conventions  
Keep all your fantasies thats all we are
