I confess Im messed up  
Dropping Im sorrys like youre still around  
And I know you dressed up  
Said hey kid youll never live this down  
  
And youre just the girl all the boys want to dance with  
And Im just the boy whos had too many chances  
  
Im sleeping on your folks porch again dreaming  
She said she said she said Why dont you just drop dead  
  
I dont blame you for being you  
But you cant blame me for hating it  
So say what are you waiting for  
Kiss her kiss her  
I set my clocks early cause I know Im always late  
  
Write me off give up on me  
Cause darling what did you expect  
Im just off a lost cause  
A long shot dont even take this bet  
  
You can make all the moves you can aim all the spotlights  
Get all the sighs and the moans just right  
  
Im just always on  
You said youd keep me honest  
youre always on  
But I wont call you on it
