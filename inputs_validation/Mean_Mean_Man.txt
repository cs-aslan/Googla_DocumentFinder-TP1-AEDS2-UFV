i love a mean mean man  
he lives uptown  
when i want him hes never around  
hes a mean mean man  
hes a mean mean man  
hes a mean mean man but i love him all i can  
now he calls up and wants a date at 8  
hes never on time hes always late  
hes a mean mean man  
hes a mean mean man  
hes a mean mean man but i love him all i can  
now we go to a dance he holds me tight  
but he dont even kiss me goodnight  
hes a mean mean man  
hes a mean mean man  
hes a mean mean man but i love him all i can  
i know im a fool to love that man  
but im gonna love him as long as i can  
hes a mean mean man  
hes a mean mean man  
hes a mean mean man but i love him all i can
