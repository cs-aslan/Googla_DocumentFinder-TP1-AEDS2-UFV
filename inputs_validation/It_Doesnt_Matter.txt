I am happy  
That I have you  
Even though youre not here now  
I know somewhere  
You are dreaming  
Though its definitely not of me  
  
It doesnt matter  
If this all shatters  
Nothing lasts forever  
But Im praying  
That were staying  
Together  
  
I am warmed by  
Your friendship  
Even when youre far away  
And Im happy  
In the knowledge  
We may never see the day  
  
When I kiss you  
And you kiss me  
Dont pretend you miss me  
The worst kind  
Of diseased mind  
Is one filled with jealousy  
  
If we should meet again  
Dont try to solve the puzzle  
Just lay down next to me  
And please dont move a muscle  
  
I will thank you  
Most of all for  
The respect you have for me  
Im embarrassed  
It overwhelms me  
Because I dont deserve any  
  
It doesnt matter  
If this all shatters  
Nothing lasts forever  
But Im praying  
That were staying  
Together
