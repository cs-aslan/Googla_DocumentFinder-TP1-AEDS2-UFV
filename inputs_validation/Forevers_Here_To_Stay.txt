She stepped out of the Taxi with a suitcase in her hand  
And a hand bag too full for her to hold  
I felt her body tremble as I took her in my arms  
And she whispered dont ever let me go  
  
Chorus  
The I watched her hang her dresses up and close the closet door  
And I watched her put her satin things away  
Somehow now I know she wont be leaving anymore  
I do believe forevers here to stay  
  
Its good to hear her foot steps just walking down the hall  
Lord I wondered would I hear those sounds again  
Were picking up the pieces and putting away the past  
Weve got a lot of broken dreams to mend  
  
Chorus  
  
I do believe forevers here to stay
