Suckin my dick and on my mother fucking balls G

Blood bath went I let the fuckin rap hit em

Taken out over a dirty look

Youre only taken a piss from me with hot led  
You know my style faggot cause Im always schemin  
In jail niggas holdin a sink screamin

Surroned by the colors I see crimson black and blue come on  
Locking open doors again Im still afraid of you

Light to dark then light again I always thought I knew come on  
Young to old and young again whats left for me to do straight up  
Center of the universe collecting me in time come on  
Im falling down upon the earth and singing truth in rhyme come on  
If I was a rolling stone Id roll until Im through come on  
And if I was a garden I would bloom in black for you  
Dirt Dog in effect  
  
Aint nowhere to run cause I be runnin this  
Aint nowhere to hide come on
