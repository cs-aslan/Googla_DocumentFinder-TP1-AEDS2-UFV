Big and Im bad  
And I want you to know  
I hand around  
Where the grass is greener  
Totally naked baby  
Totally nude  
Cause if I want to  
Whos gonna stop me  
Im absolutely free  
Living in the trees  
The birdies and the bees  
Cause Im a nature boy  
  
Locked up inside  
You cant tell me where its at  
Open up open up open the door  
Rocks and trees and physical culture  
Some days you hide  
I guess you wonder where you are  
Nature boy nature man take me along  
We got a life thats undiscovered  
  
We threw it all away  
Throw it all away  
Rolling every way  
Its irresponsible  
So civilized  
I guess you wonder where you are  
Nature boy nature man take me along  
Deep in the woods were undiscovered  
  
Im a little fish and youre the river  
Living in a boat thats underwater  
We can tip tip tip it over  
You can push push make it better now  
Wake your daddy up  
Its a quarter to five  
Our little boat  
Has lost its rudder  
Dive to the bottom  
And we never come up  
  
A polka party  
For Bob and Martha  
Im absolutely free  
Living in the trees  
The birdies and the bees  
Cause Im a nature boy  
Think what you like  
This is really where its at  
Open up open up open the door  
We dont need clothes and we dont need money  
So civilized  
I guess you wonder where you are  
Nature boy nature man take me along  
Deep in the woods were undiscovered
