Right from early days from the moment I was born  
I would take my guitar in the early early mornin  
And go down to the fields and playayay  
Sittin down there in the long grass strummin  
I could see the people from miles around comin  
To hear me sing my music and playayay  
Well thats been my kinda life my kinda life  
Yes and I like it  
Well thats been my kinda life my kinda life  
Yes and I like it  
Well thats been my kinda life yeah and I wouldnt spend it anywhere  
Other than sittin down somewhere playin away my days  
Well we made it to the city just me and my guitar  
That was where I found a freaky little bar  
I sat there on the stage and playayayed  
Well up came a guy who said it wasnt plastic  
He wanted me to sing away my life or something drastic  
But all I want to do is playayay  
Well thats been my kinda life my kinda life  
Yes and I like it  
Well thats been my kinda life my kinda life  
Yes and I like it  
Well thats been my kinda life yeah and I wouldnt spend it anywhere  
Other than sittin down somewhere playin away my days  
Well fame and fortune Ive let them pass me by  
No one in the country could say I didnt try  
To turn the people and to playayay  
You can keep all the money and the places that go with it  
Cause all I want is freedom and no cash could ever get it  
All I want to do is playayay  
Well thats been my kinda life my kinda life  
Yes and I like it  
Well thats been my kinda life my kinda life  
Yes and I like it  
Well thats been my kinda life yeah and I wouldnt spend it anywhere  
Other than sittin down somewhere playin away my days
