Nooo I dont want her  
So Ill forget her  
Forget the love she gave me  
Somehow  
Ive learned my lesson  
Dont have to tell me  
Cause Im gonna start forgettin  
Yes Im gonna start forgettin  
Right now  
Go on take my share  
Cause I dont want her  
And now shes gone good riddance goodbye  
But what my friends dont know  
Is that I love her so  
And in my lonely room all day  
I cry  
Goo on and take her  
Cause I dont want her  
I know Ill find another  
Find another  
Somewhere  
No I dont want her  
Shes not my kind now  
And if shes got somebody else  
Oh really got somebody else  
I dont care  
To think that my love  
Could say Goodbye love  
And leave me here as low as the ground  
But no one knows but me  
What she means to me  
And when Im by myself  
All day I sigh  
Cause without her  
I could lay me down  
And die
