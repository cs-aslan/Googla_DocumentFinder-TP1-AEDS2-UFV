Oh theres one thing baby  
I just dont understand  
Two old women fighting for  
Another man  
You know its just too much  
Ooohhh you know its just too much  
Oh its too much baby  
And I just dont understand  
Oh here comes mary  
Coming over the hill  
They say she wont  
But her sister will  
You know its just too much  
Ooohhh you know its just too much  
You know its too much baby  
And I just dont understand  
Oh rock on  
Oh here comes my na na na  
With a buckle of gold  
Everybody says hey  
Rock your soul  
You know its just too much  
Ooohhh just too much  
You know its too much baby  
And I just dont understand  
Hey take me back now  
Baby where I belong  
Everything you know  
Im doing wrong  
You know its just too much  
Ooohhh just too much  
Oh you know its too much baby  
And I just dont understand  
Oh just  
Everytime Im going out  
For my thrill  
Here comes mary  
And I get no fill  
You know its just too much  
Oh know its know its just too much  
Oh you know its too much baby  
And I just dont understand  
You know its too too too much  
You know its too too too much  
You know its too too too much  
You know its too too too much  
You know its too much baby  
And I just dont understand
