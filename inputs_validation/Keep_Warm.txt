Eyes on the prize and I cant capsize this time  
Cause theres somebody else in my boat  
Used to live alone in a tomb I made my own  
But now Ive gone and given up my coat  
  
And its cold outside but Im just fine  
You are mine to keep warm  
  
Down down down I go  
On a road that I dont know  
And I aint got a thing in my bag  
Some things you can not plan  
Like your hand in mine  
Just put your hand in mine  
  
And its cold outside but Im just fine  
You are mine to keep warm  
Yeah its cold outside but Im just fine  
You are mine to keep warm  
  
Sables and wine till the end of time you give me much more than that  
Diamond rings and beautiful things  
Oh you give me much more than that  
When you smile  
  
You are mine to keep warm  
And its cold outside but Im just fine  
You are mine to keep warm
