I was crazy when I said I didnt love you  
From the first time that I ever saw you  
The emotions running deep underneath my skin  
Sign anywhere for your love where do we begin  
  
So lay me down  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Take me down  
Theres nobody else Id rather be with  
  
I wanna wake up in your arms  
I wanna wake up in your arms  
I wanna wake up in your arms  
I wanna wake up in your arms  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
  
If my heart is outta place move over  
I coulda told you how it hurts coulda told ya  
And now I want you I can feel it in my heartbeat  
Its like a race like Im running in a track meet  
  
So lay me down  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Take me down  
Theres nobody else Id rather be with  
  
I wanna wake up in your arms  
I wanna wake up in your arms  
I wanna wake up in your arms  
I wanna wake up in your arms  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh
