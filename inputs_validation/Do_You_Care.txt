do you want to make a difference  
do you wonder what would happen if you dont  
do you need just a little push  
do you try to change  
  
do you THINK about the other guy  
do you want just one good reason why you should  
do you only think about yourself  
do you want to be left alone  
  
youre running out of time  
and I dont see a change in you  
and I dont think youre gonna make it  
  
do you understand the way it works  
do you want to take as much as you can get  
do you need a little push  
do you try to change  
  
youre running out of time  
and I dont see a change in you  
and I dont think youre gonna make it  
  
were running out of time and there arent many changes made  
and I dont think were going to make it  
were running out of time and there arent many changes made  
and I dont think were going to make it
