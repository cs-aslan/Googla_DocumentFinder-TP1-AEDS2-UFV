I look up and the camera eye is  
Searching my room  
The tv screen is calling me  
But for what or whom  
Please mister do be careful  
Im so fragile  
Maybe theyll let me down  
To speedys place for a while  
  
Oh well thats too bad  
Oh well thats too bad  
  
I talk a lot a sign of fear  
I thought you should know  
I can see pictures of me well  
Theyre soso  
Ill come on to the leader  
Like Im some hero  
Hell laugh and raise his dying eyes  
And just tell me to go  
  
1920 flashbacks for an hour or more  
Of crazy actors hiding  
In the doorways top floor  
Machines scream in anger  
From a thousand dead ends  
I turn my face I crawl away  
I look for a friend
