Dont make me come to Vegas  
Dont make me pull you out of his bed  
I am vigilant that it will not be  
You on the menu hes serving up for his friends  
Dont make me come to Vegas  
Dont make me pull him out of your head  
Athena will attest  
That it could be done  
And it has been done  
And I think that I am up to it  
And the jacaranda tree  
Is telling me of the trouble youre in  
Just by the way  
She bends remember dancing and wondering  
As you were swaying  
What kind of woman youd be  
What will be will be over my dead body  
Slip through your hand again and again  
Slip through your hand again and again  
My old flame was a jester and a joker  
And as healer of men they called him the prince  
Prince of black jacks and of women  
And of anything thats slipped into his hands  
And the ranches and the mustangs  
And the way you said you can have all this except for me  
You see lady luck is my mistress  
And youll have to play second to her wish  
And the jacaranda tree  
Is telling me its not over yet  
Just by the way  
She bends if you come breezin through  
You said Ill know that its you by the taste on my lips  
Bet on the deserts kiss  
I could slip through your net  
Over my dead body slip through your hand  
Dont make me come to vegas  
Hmmm
