Oh yeah  
Our love is like a holiday  
I know that I let you down in the past  
Cause Ive got so many places to go  
Girl I promise Ill be around give me a chance  
Cause Im singing for you wherever it show  
How can I  
How can it be  
How can I  
Ive been so deep  
How can I  
Its hard to believe  
This world brought you to me  
Brought you to me  
Ive been to Paris London LA  
I feel the tropical sun in my face  
This Christmas we dont need to get away  
Cause our love is like a holiday  
Im always calling from a different hotel room  
And your voice makes me feel like home  
Backstreet Im waiting just thinking of you of you  
Just lying there sleeping alone  
How can I  
How can it be  
How can I  
I feel you creep into my every dream  
Im coming back on Christmas Eve  
On Christmas Eve  
Girl I know youve been waiting for me for much too long  
I thank you girl for holding on  
Believe me when I tell you theres just one place I know I belong  
Girl thats why I loved you to soul
