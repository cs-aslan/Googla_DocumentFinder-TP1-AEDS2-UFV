Oh say can you see by the dawns early light  
  
What so proudly we hailed at the twilights last gleaming  
  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight  
  
Over the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming  
  
And the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air  
  
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there  
  
Oh say does that starspangled banner yet wave  
  
Over the land of the free and the home of the brave
