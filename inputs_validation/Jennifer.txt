Jennifer  
She drinks her sherry wine  
She keeps her ladys love for me all the time  
Shes seventeen barely old enough to cry  
A child in her fathers eyes  
A woman every night  
  
Her love  
Gives me the power  
Her dreams carry me on  
Jennifer so inviting  
That I sing  
  
Jennifer  
She took me by surprise  
She told me that shes much too young to keep me satisfied  
Jennifer ah so delicate and shy  
A child in her mothers eyes but  
A woman every night  
  
Her love  
Gives me the power  
Her dreams carry me on  
Jennifer so inviting  
That I sing
