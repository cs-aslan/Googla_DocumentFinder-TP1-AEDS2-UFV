Love You Inside Out  
  
Baby I cant figure it out  
Your kisses taste like honey  
Sweet lies dont gimme no rise  
Oh oh what youre trying to do  
  
Livin on your cheatin  
And the pain grows inside me  
Its enough to leave me crying in the rain  
Love you forever but youre  
Driving me insane  
And Im hanging on  
Oh oh Ill win Ill never give in  
  
Our love has got the power  
Too many lovers in one lifetime  
Aint good for you  
You treat me like a vision in the night  
Someone there to stand behind you  
When your world aint working right  
  
I aint no vision I am the man  
Who loves you inside out  
Backwards and forwards with  
My heart hanging out  
I love no other way  
  
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire  
Wrap myself up and take me home again  
Too many heartaches in one  
Lifetime aint good for me  
I figure its the love that keeps you warm  
  
Let this moment be forever  
We wont ever feel the storm  
I aint no vision I am the man  
Who loves you inside out  
Backwards and forwards with  
My heart hanging out  
  
I love no other way  
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire  
Dont try to tell me its all over  
I cant hear a word I cant hear a line  
No man could love you more  
And thats what Im cryin for  
You cant change the way I feel inside  
  
Youre the reason for my laughter and my sorrow  
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow  
No man on earth can stand  
Between my love and I  
And no matter how you hurt me  
I will love you till I die  
  
I aint no vision I am the man  
Who loves you inside out  
Backwards and forwards with  
My heart hanging out  
I love no other way  
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire  
  
Repeat to fade
