She has the innocence and vision of a child  
How can I ever really know her  
Were riding on a carousel  
Thats running wild  
Around in circles til its over  
  
And every time we reach the end  
We go around again cause  
  
Chorus  
She cant let go  
And I dont want to tell her no  
She cant let go  
And I dont want to tell her no  
  
I see her starin out the window at the rain  
But she will never leave the fire  
Sometimes it burns all night and covers up the pain  
Sometimes it only leaves us tired  
  
And every time we reach the end  
We go around again cause  
  
Chorus
