You lost faith in the human spirit  
You walk around like a ghost  
Your starspangled heart  
Took a train for the coast  
  
When you shine youre a hilltop mansion  
So howd you lose the light  
Was it blown by the wind  
In the still of the night  
  
Were up against the wall  
  
Up against the wall  
Theres something dying on the street  
When they knock you down  
Youre gonna get back on your feet  
No you cant stop now  
  
I always saw you as a kind of keeper  
A mother to a child  
But your boys have grown soft  
And your girls have gone wild  
  
From the blue ranch to the black hills  
To the redwood sky  
The season may pass  
But the dream doesnt die  
  
Why did you drop the ball  
  
Up against the wall  
Theres something dying on the street  
When they knock you down  
Youre gonna get back on your feet  
No you cant stop now  
  
When they break your heart  
When they cause your soul to mourn  
Remember what I said  
Boy you was battle born  
  
No you cant stop now  
You was battle born  
  
When the night falls on the land  
Are you haunted by the sound  
Its gonna take more than a hand  
To turn this thing around  
  
Wont you lean it on me  
Rescue set me free  
  
Up against the wall Up against the wall  
Theres something dying on the street  
When they knock you down Up against the wall  
Youre gonna get back on your feet  
Cause you cant stop now Cause you cant stop now  
  
Did they break your heart Did they break your heart  
And did they cause your soul to mourn  
Remember what I said  
Boy you was battle born  
Cause you cant stop now Cause you cant stop now  
  
Come on show your face  
Come on give us one more spark  
So well start a fire  
Unless we fall into the dark  
And you cant stop now No you cant stop now  
  
You never know  
If you never learn  
You never shine  
If you never burn  
The rising tide  
The undertow  
The venom and  
The overflow  
You turn away  
Welcome home
