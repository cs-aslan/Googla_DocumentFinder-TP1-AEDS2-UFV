Watched from a distance its beautiful  
Somebodys caught in the undertow  
Have you ever felt desperation  
The saltwaters filling your lungs  
We will regret it when we sleep  
Promises never meant to keep  
When all of the shadows need  
Is a good man to hide in the dream  
Do they know that the worlds on fire  
  
Time is a price we cant afford  
An empty glass and an open door  
You get what you paid for in sweat  
And a voice that says please dont forget  
  
Do they know that the worlds on fire  
Do they know that the time is now  
Do they know that you gotta stand up stand up  
Let your voice speak out  
Do they know that its time  
  
Caught in a maze you cant escape  
The flickering lights and the colored lens  
The walls that we build just close in  
Until we decide to begin  
Are we distracted by the sun  
The glittering jewels and the beating drums  
Is it going the distance we fear  
Have you heard that were already here  
  
Do they know that the worlds on fire  
Do they know that the time is now  
Do they know that you gotta stand up stand up  
Let your voice speak out  
Do they know that the worlds on fire  
Do they know that the time is here  
Do they know that you gotta stand up stand up  
Let your voice be clear  
Do they know that its time  
  
Some will say weve gone too far  
Were on the edge and in too deep  
Some will say were too far gone  
You cant erase the tragedy
