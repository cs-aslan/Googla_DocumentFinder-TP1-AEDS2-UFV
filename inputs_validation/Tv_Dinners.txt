TV dinners theres nothin else to eat  
TV dinners they really cant be beat  
I like em frozen but you understand  
I throw em in and wave em and Im a brand new man oh yeah  
  
TV dinners theyre goin to my head  
TV dinners my skin is turnin red  
Twenty year old turkey in a thirty year old tin  
I cant wait until tomorrow and thaw one out again oh yeah  
  
TV dinners Im feelin kinda rough  
TV dinners this ones kinda tough  
I like the enchiladas and the teriaki too  
I even like the chicken if the sauce is not too blue  
  
And theyre mine all mine oh yeah  
And they sure are fine  
Gotta have em  
Gimme somethin now
