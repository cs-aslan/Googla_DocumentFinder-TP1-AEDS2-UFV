I dont really want to be the one  
To tell you time is running out  
Because its obvious  
Just a move with the right intention  
Is all that it takes  
  
I dont really need to be the one  
To tell you things are going wrong  
Because its obvious  
But a step in the right direction  
Is all that you need  
  
Chorus  
You dont have to move heaven and earth  
You dont have to change overnight  
Theres never been a better time  
To make up your mind  
And put this thing right  
  
I dont mean to say that we were wrong  
But we know we need some new attention  
But just look with a new dimension  
Is all that it takes  
  
Chorus  
  
Everybody knows where they can make  
A change or two  
To help the situation  
Just a step with a good intention  
Is all that it takes  
  
Chorus x2
