Youre there to pick me up  
Whenever I fall down  
And I cant say enough  
Bout the things youve done for me  
Without you in my life  
I dont know where Id be  
Release my heart felt praise  
Gonna lift my voice and sing  
  
Chorus  
Gonna raise my hands up to the sky  
Use every breath to glorify  
Your name your work your way  
Cause Im so thankful  
For life for health for strength to live  
For sharing love and fellowship  
For every blessing that you give  
Im thankful  
  
Youre the brightest star  
The universe has seen  
And Im so privileged  
That you shine your light on me  
So powerful so great  
The ultimate creator  
You gave the gift that we know as eternal life  
  
Chorus  
  
Whats happenin around me  
Aint gonna change what I believe  
I believe you sent the Holy Spirit to guide me  
With knowledge and wisdom for all situations  
Cause it aint always aint good for ya no no

For life for health for strength to live  
For sharing love and fellowship  
For every blessing that you give
