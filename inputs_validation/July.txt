Its warm outside  
But I can hear the snow  
Falling on my window  
I had to go away  
To somewhere deeper down  
I know its my mistake  
To take off out of this town  
And June becomes July  
  
This roads on fire  
And my trains running slow  
It rains against my window  
I had to get away  
To somewhere noone knows  
I know its my mistake  
To take off now in this way  
And June becomes July  
  
The air is thin  
When youre above the clouds  
I see them from my window  
Its strange to get away now  
To somewhere noone goes  
I know its my mistake  
But I dont even know now  
And June becomes July  
And June becomes July
