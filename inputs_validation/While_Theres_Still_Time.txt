How can I sleep tonight  
When I know that tomorrow Ill be miles away  
And how can I leave if I know when I kiss you goodbye  
Baby youll cry  
  
Where do I find the words  
To convince you that theres a secret part of me  
That dies every time I must pack up and walk out the door  
When Im wanting you more  
  
So while theres still time  
Know that I love you  
Baby please hold me tight  
Girl while theres still time  
  
If I could stop the dawn  
Make the moon and the stars shine on forever more  
And never again have to say how much Im missing you  
But what can I do  
  
So while theres still time  
Say that you love me  
Baby please hold me tight  
Girl while theres still time  
  
If I should go if I should go  
Theres a chance I could lose  
The love of my life the love of my life  
Baby please dont make me choose  
  
Believe me  
Trust me  
Let me inside  
  
And while theres still time  
Forget about tomorrow  
Baby please lets not fight  
Not while theres still time  
While theres still time  
While theres still time  
While theres still time  
Oohoohoohoohoohooh
