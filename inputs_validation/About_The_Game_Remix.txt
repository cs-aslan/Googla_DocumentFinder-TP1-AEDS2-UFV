Drake  
Its Southern Smoke Boy  
Ho Yeah Uh huh

Ahahaha the boy of summer are here man  
Ayo Track I got something mean for this one boy  
  
Verse 1 drake  
Chances Are Most of the day you was lying around  
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down  
By nineteen I might seem desitend for millions  
Promoters on my ass so Im guessing they filled  
In I take qs from my big boy popz  
Im the only young dude that the big boys watch  
They getting foul on the star  
But its all eyes on me like Im coppin some vows for the bar  
Get it guess not picture me not strive  
To land in the top ten slip in the top five  
Same thing in the top four trust Im hot boy  
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me  
Now a day I peep they intrests  
Specialy when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed  
Money making brothers should take notes  
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat  
Some body get the waiter they need a second plate a  
This knowledge if you aint got it you could catch it later  
My money then lovers seperate for I commit the date up  
I put a split in the middle then I seperater  
  
Chorus trey songz  
It aint about the rims on my truck  
Aint about the ice on my watch  
Aint about teh coop of my truck  
Baby its about the Game  
  
Verse 2  
Ridin low  
Layed back in the seat when I creep  
Thats just how I roll  
With some fresh nice ones on my feet  
Thats it goes  
And Im tryin to find a chick I can meet who aint about the dough  
Cause it aint all about that no more  
  
Chorus trey songz  
It aint about the rims on my truck  
Aint about the ice on my watch

Aint about my dough or my rocks  
Aint the life I live it dont stop  
Baby its about the game  
  
Verse 3 trey songz  
When you ask why Im hustlin in the streets thats just who I be  
Yo I live for the dough for the flow for feelin free  
Aint too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury  
But without it all Im still about the game  
  
Bridge  
The haters wanna hate but it aint nothing  
Because the ladies choose to love me they love me for what I do
