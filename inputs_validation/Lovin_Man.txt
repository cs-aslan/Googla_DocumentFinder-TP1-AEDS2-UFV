I dont mind the cold and rain where Im waiting  
Im holding on to your memry as tight as I can  
And silver wings are bringing you back so I can hold you  
And let me know that Im still your lovin man  
  
You carry my dreams through the darkness while Im sleeping  
The part of love that I need to fit my plan  
And I dont need nobody else to ease my feelings  
As long as I can be your lovin man  
  
I been waiting here for days to see that big steel bird arrive  
And just the thought of lovin you is whats kept this man alive  
  
Share with me all the joy life can bring us  
Though my kingdows may be castles made of sand  
Darlin please spend your sunshine days beside me  
And let me always be your lovin man  
  
Your lovin man lovin man  
And let me be your lovin man  
Your lovin man lovin man  
And let me be your lovin man  
Your lovin man lovin man
