Theres a voice on the phone  
Who just called in to say  
Mr Jones isnt home  
Hell be gone for the day  
  
So he pulls down the blind  
To adjust his disguise  
But its all in his mind  
Which he proudly denies  
  
I turn the boat back from the weir  
Where to go from here  
I cant hide from each face I see  
Looking out from behind them is me  
  
Im attempting to guess  
What they meant when they said  
Mr Jones and his guest  
Wont be using the bed  
  
So if I take the rap  
While they stay out of sight  
I can spring from the trap  
When the timing is right  
  
One minute I think I know what I mean  
The next I hear voices inside disagree  
Why are they laughing at me  
So I pick up the phone  
  
Someones asking of me  
Is the real Mister Jones  
Mister One Two or Three  
So I say that theyre not  
  
But its not as I say  
Cause theyre all that Ive got  
And I cant get away  
As Alice waves us through the glass  
  
Are we home at last  
For tomorrow theyll be here you see  
Locked away safe inside there with me  
Cause tomorrow theyll be here youll see  
  
Locked away safe inside theyre with me  
One minute I think I know what I mean  
The next I hear voices inside disagree  
Why are they laughing at me
