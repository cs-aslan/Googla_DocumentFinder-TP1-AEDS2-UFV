Its love Im after  
North South East and West  
I have gone in my quest  
Far wide  
  
High and low  
This one thing I know  
Its love Im after  
I dont want to be a millionaire  
The only thing on earth  
For which I care is love  
  
Ba da da da da do  
For love and laughter  
For love and laughter  
I give all that I posses  
Dont you know the only  
  
Name for happiness  
Is love love love  
Rich man poor man  
Beggar man thief  
Feel the way I do  
Because each one of them believes  
Hell find somebody like you  
  
Its love Im after  
Love Im after  
Love its love Im after  
It may make me rise or make me fall  
But its love Im after  
After all
