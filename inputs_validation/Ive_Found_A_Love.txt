Baby Ive never had a single thing in my life I could call my own  
There you were holding a love so true  
Now Ive got a home now Ive got a home  
  
I found a love hidden in a backstreet  
I found a love baby  
I found a love hidden in a backstreet  
Hidden away from the world baby  
  
Baby you really make me feel like a king a king without a crown  
But darlin Promise me one little thing That you wont let me down  
  
I found a love hidden in a backstreet  
I found a love baby  
I found a love hidden in a backstreet  
Hidden away from the world baby  
  
Dont ever tell me lies baby  
Dont take me for a ride baby  
Just stay here by my side baby  
We wont ever stop  
  
I found a love hidden in a backstreet  
I found a love baby  
I found a love hidden in a backstreet  
Hidden away from the world baby
