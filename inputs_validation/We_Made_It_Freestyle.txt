Bitches cant front on the kid anymore man they know what my name is  
And if by chance she dont know who I am she just know that Im famous  
Imma just hand her a business card and say Nigga we made it  
And she gotta come to the hotel and pop it off for me  
Then she gon text her best friend like Girl he got some good dick and money  
Her friend hit her back like I know that already that niggas amazin  
Then I send a message to both of they asses like Nigga we made it
