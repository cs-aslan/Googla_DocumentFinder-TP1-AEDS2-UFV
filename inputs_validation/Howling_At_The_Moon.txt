Shalalala shalalalalala shalalalalala  
  
Ships are docking planes are landing  
A never ending supply  
  
No more narco no more gangster  
Conservatives can cry  
  
I took the law and threw it away  
cause theres nothing wrong its just for play  
Theres no law no law any more  
I want to steal from the rich and give to the poor  
  
Shalalala shalalalalala  
Shalalala shalalalalala  
  
It was glowing glowing glowing glowing in the dark  
It was sparkling sparkling sparkling sparkling in the dark  
I took the law and threw it away  
cause theres nothing wrong its just for play  
  
Theres no law no law any more  
I want to steal from the rich and give to the poor  
  
Winter turns to summer sadness turns to fun  
Keep the faith baby you broke the rules and won  
  
Shalalala shalalalalala  
Shalalala shalalalalala  
  
Keep it glowing glowing glowing  
Im not hurting any one keep it glowing smoking glowing  
Im howling at the moon  
I took the law and threw it away  
cause theres nothing wrong its just for play  
Theres no law no law any more  
I want to steal from the rich and give to the poor  
  
Oh baby oh baby oh baby oh baby  
  
I took the law and threw it away  
cause theres nothing wrong its just for play  
  
Im smoking baby  
Im smoking oh baby  
  
Theres no law no law any more  
I want to steal from the rich and give to the poor  
  
Shalalala shalalalalala
