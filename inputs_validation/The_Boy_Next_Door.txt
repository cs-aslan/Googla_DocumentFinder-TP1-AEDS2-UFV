The moment I saw him smile  
I knew he was just my style  
My only regret is weve never met  
Though I dream of him all the while  
  
But he doesnt know I exist  
No matter how I may persist  
So its clear to see theres no hope for me  
Though I live at fiftyonethirtyfive Kensington Avenue  
And he lives at fiftyonethirtythree  
  
How can I ignore the boy next door  
I love him more than I can say  
Doesnt try to please me  
Doesnt even tease me  
And he never sees me glance his way  
  
And though Im heartsore the boy next door  
Affection for me wont display  
I just adore him  
So I cant ignore him  
The boy next door  
  
I just adore him  
So I cant ignore him  
The boy next door
