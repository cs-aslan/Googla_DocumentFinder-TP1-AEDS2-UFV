Who can I turn to when nobody needs me  
My heart wants to know and so I must go where destiny  
Leads me  
With no star to guide me and no one beside me  
Ill go on my way and after the day the darkness will  
Hide me  
  
And maybe tomorrow Ill find what Im after  
  
Ill throw off my sorrow beg steal or borrow my share  
Of laughter  
With you I could learn to with you what a new day  
But who can I turn to if you turn away  
  
With you I could learn to with you what a new day  
But who can I turn to if you turn away
