Pack up your troubles in your old gym bag  
You gotta dance to the tune of Bolivian Ragamuffin  
Ill take short breaks love her to the outbreaks  
  
Standing on the seashore lookin at the city  
See the street light dog bite go lady on the TD8  
The wax museum and nobody gets to see themselves  
Theres others care to see what nobody wants to be a baby  
  
Cant break cabbage head  
Try and get a salad made  
Hold my pickle hold the lettuce  
Session waters dont upset us  
  
Kick stand face look so evil like Knieval  
Never make third base like a toilet bowl cleaner  
Like a squawk eight fool in I dont know orogotus  
If I have to do rock a roller up a jello  
  
Facial connish lie  
Smoke a bowl of feeling fine  
Burn and people try to let us  
Session waters wont upset us  
  
Hee lee cans Kick in the pants  
Water fall got on a dance  
Blame it all Say gotta eve us a trance  
Aint gonna do it  
Aint gonna do it  
Aint gonna do it  
Aint gonna do it  
Aint gonna do it
