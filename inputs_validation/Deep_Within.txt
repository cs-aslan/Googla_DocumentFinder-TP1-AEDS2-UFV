Is there a place deep within  
A place where you hide your darkest sins  
Theres a strange kind of ambiance  
Its surrounding you  
As a songstress you lure me  
Towards the truth  
  
Candles die down as you leave the room  
In my heart you leave no gloom  
As you lure me I know the truth  
Youre a leprechaun I see you through  
  
Is there a place deep within  
A place where you hide your darkest sins  
Theres a strange kind of ambiance  
Its surrounding you  
As a songstress you lure me  
Towards the truth
