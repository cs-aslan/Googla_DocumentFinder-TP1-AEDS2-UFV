Im sleeping my way out of this one  
With anyone who will lie down  
Ill be stuck fixated on one star  
When the world is crashing down  
  
I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
Im not the desperate type  
But youve got me looking in through blinds  
I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
Im not the desperate type  
  
Sitting out dances on the wall  
Trying to forget everything that isnt you  
Im not going home alone  
Cause I dont do too well  
Sitting out dances on the wall  
Trying to forget everything that isnt you  
Im not going home alone  
Cause I dont do too well on my own  
  
The only thing worse that not knowing  
Is you think that I dont know  
Im having another episode  
I just need a stronger dose  
  
I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
Im not the desperate type  
But youve got me looking in through blinds  
I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
Im not the desperate type  
  
Sitting out dances on the wall  
Trying to forget everything that isnt you  
Im not going home alone  
Cause I dont do too well  
Sitting out dances on the wall  
Trying to forget everything that isnt you  
Im not going home alone  
Cause I dont do too well on my own

I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
Im not the desperate type  
But you got me looking in through blinds  
  
I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
Im not the desperate type  
  
Sitting out dances on the wall  
Im trying to forget everything that isnt you  
Im not going home alone  
Cause I dont do to well on my own
