I found myself with noone I could turn to  
The situation went from bad to worse  
While I was out there taking care of business  
Oh I was moving forward in reverse  
  
I started out with every good intention  
I wanted just to get back on my feet  
The enemy will soon be gunning  
It wont be long before Im running  
And Ill be calling for the fleet  
  
Im gonna move to the light  
Gonna stand up and fight  
Im gonna show I was wrong  
Im gonna win back the right  
  
Oh it wasnt for the wont of trying that I turned to the other side  
One for the money  
I never made enough for what I needed  
I thought that I could find an easy way  
But I was wrong and now Im running  
It wont be long and theyll be gunning for me  
  
And everybodys closing in on me  
Im gonna move to the light  
Gonna stand up and fight  
Im gonna show I was wrong  
Gonna win back the right  
Oh it wasnt for the wont of trying that I turned to the other side  
  
One for the money  
Im gonna move to the light  
Gonna stand up and fight  
Im gonna show I was wrong  
Gonna win back the right  
Oh it wasnt for the wont of trying that I turned to the other side  
One for the money  
One for the money one for the money
