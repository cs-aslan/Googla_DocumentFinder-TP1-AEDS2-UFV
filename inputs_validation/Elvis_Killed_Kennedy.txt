Confrontation town front  
I cant front No I cant believe this funk  
Got a blacklash as long as some happy ass  
Clown frown Uh I get down  
In the trenches underneath the underground  
Under a blanket of hell you never heard rejected the sound  
Wrap your troubles in dreams baby in search of a theme  
I cant believe Im triple teamed  
I voted Hope my ass wasnt railroaded  
Ran for the border to avoid the slaughter  
Shit I blamed that tape recorder cause you mad outta order  
Beyond categories another East side story Uh  
Thats three thousand miles ago  
Cause cats are shook by past crooks  
Doin street hooks too many freestyles yo be off the books  
Be the judge make sure that needle dont budge dont prejudge  
Your frustration anger at the association  
What difference it makin got the whole world  
Hatin art of war vocals influence the locals  
Its a mad mad world weve been living everyday  
What you gone to say all man say Im a fuck up  
Living dont throw it away  
Its a mad mad world weve been living everyday  
What you gone to say all man say Im a fuck up  
Living dont throw it away  
Claving est operes a mixer  
Le New Jacks sont dans  
Les MCs sont pres auteur en toute Liberte  
Its a mad mad world weve been living everyday  
Transalation We are ready to get in the mix  
The new generation are in the place to be  
MCs are ready to express themselves freely  
Now I feel trapped in this everyday form of life  
Whos wrong or right who knows I still fight  
To survive life from the land of confusion  
Mans abusing which religion are you choosing  
Substance abusing losing touch with reality  
Have you forgot about your family values  
Cant you understand the plan  
World destruction push the button end of discussion  
Boom  
Whatcha gonna do now  
Its like the sound of a Mosberg pump goin Boo Yow  
What a mad world  
We got cops on the take  
Females being raped  
Bodies floatin in the lake  
Why Over hate  
Better check your faith cause itll be gone before you wake
