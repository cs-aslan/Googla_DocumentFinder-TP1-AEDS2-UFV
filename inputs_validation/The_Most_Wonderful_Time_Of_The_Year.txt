Its the most wonderful time of the year  
With the kids jingle belling  
And everyone telling you Be of good cheer  
Its the most wonderful time of the year  
Its the haphappiest season of all  
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings  
When friends come to call  
Its the hap happiest season of all  
  
Therell be parties for hosting  
Marshmallows for toasting  
And caroling out in the snow  
Therell be scary ghost stories  
And tales of the glories of  
Christmases long long ago  
  
Its the most wonderful time of the year  
Therell be much mistltoeing  
And hearts will be glowing  
When love ones are near  
Its the most wonderful time of the year  
  
Therell be parties for hosting  
Marshmallows for toasting  
And caroling out in the snow  
Therell be scary ghost stories  
And tales of the glories of  
Christmases long long ago  
  
Its the most wonderful time of the year  
Therell be much mistltoeing  
And hearts will be glowing  
When love ones are near  
Its the most wonderful time  
Its the most wonderful time  
Its the most wonderful time  
Its the most wonderful time of the year
