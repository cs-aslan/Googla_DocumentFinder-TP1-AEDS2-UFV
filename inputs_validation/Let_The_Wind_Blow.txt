Theres a storm on the horizon  
Oh let the wind blow  
There is thunder in the heavens  
Oh let the wind blow  
Let the rain fall down from the sky above  
Let the tempest roar til its had enough  
Im trusting in the Lord of love  
Let the wind blow  
  
There is lightning in the distance  
Oh let the wind blow  
There is darkness all around me  
Oh let the wind blow  
Let the world give all the hurt it can  
Let the evil one devise his plans  
Im trusting in the great I am  
Let the wind blow  
  
Let the wind blow Blow as hard as it can  
Let the wind blow  
Upon the solid rock of God I stand  
Oh let the wind blow  
  
Theres a storm on the horizon  
Oh let the wind blow  
There is thunder in the heavens  
Oh let the wind blow  
Let its mighty fury be unleashed  
Let the doubters fall upon their knees  
Im trusting in the prince of peace  
Let the wind blow  
  
Let the wind blow Blow as hard as it can  
Let the wind blow  
Upon the solid rock of God I stand  
Oh let the wind blow  
  
Let its mighty fury be unleashed  
Let the doubters fall upon their knees  
Im trusting in the prince of peace  
Let the wind blow  
  
Let the wind blow Blow as hard as it can  
Let the wind blow  
Upon the solid rock of God I stand  
Let the wind blow the wind blow  
  
Let the rain fall down from the sky above  
Let the tempest roar til its had enough let the wind blow  
Let the world give all the hurt it can  
Let the evil one devise his plans let the wind blow  
Let the rain fall down from the sky above  
Let the tempest roar til its had enough  
Im trusting in the Lord of love  
Let the wind blow
