Here we are  
Riding high  
Weve some so far  
We can touch the sky  
  
So why cant we live together  
Cant we be friends  
Why must we fight our brothers  
Til the bitter end  
  
Chorus  
We really got a problem  
We dont know how to fix yeah  
There aint no reason for staying  
We just cant do it  
  
Talk to me  
Scream and shout  
Trust in me  
We can work it out  
  
We all know the world keeps turning  
One day at a time  
Easier lessons for leaving  
We just couldnt find  
  
Chorus  
  
So why cant we live together  
Cant we be friends  
Why must we fight our brothers  
Til the bitter end  
  
Oh yeah  
Wont you trust in me  
I know we can make it yeah  
  
I close my eyes and look inside  
For a picture of how it should be  
And I wonder if you could see what I see  
  
Would you ever choose to live the way you do  
We really got a problem  
We dont know how to fix bdum yeah  
There aint no reason for staying  
We just cant do it  
  
We really got a problem  
We dont know how to fix bdum yeah  
I know we got the pieces  
But they just dont fit  
  
We really got a problem  
We dont know how to fix  
I know we got the pieces  
We just cant do it
