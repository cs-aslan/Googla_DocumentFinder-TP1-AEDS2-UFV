You want to race  
If you insist  
At that price  
I cant resist  
Thats right  
Thats right  
Thats right  
Tonight it aint right  
I got to have me a week  
But Ill be back for you Jack  
And Ill let the machine speak  
Thats right  
Thats right  
Thats right  
Showdown you bet  
And I havent even saddled my pony yet  
Have mercy Miss Percy  
I done put the coon tune on this bet  
Thats right  
Thats right  
Thats right
