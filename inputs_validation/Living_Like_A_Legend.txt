Coming down the highway running like a wind  
Gonna beat the sunset to the coast and back again  
Moving through the shadows almost going blind  
Living like a legend before my time  
If the road dont kill me baby Ill see you in the spring  
Making up for lost time between us seems like everything  
If I can make it home alright you know Ill treat you fine  
Living like a legend before my time  
I know it wasnt easy for you baby  
With your man out on the road  
So Ill be coming home tomorrow  
To try to help you carry the load  
Im running out of highways and bridges to burn  
This kind of living is taking its toll on what Ive learned  
You know it aint easy leaving you behind  
Living like a legend before my time  
But someday baby Ill be coming home to stay  
Wrapped up in your warm love every night and every day  
Ooh Im going out of my mind  
Living like a legend before my time  
I know it wasnt easy for you baby  
With your man out on the road  
So Ill be coming home tomorrow  
To try to help you carry the load  
Ill be getting up early cause I know Im coming home  
Im so tired of living this legend life alone  
Kick off your shoes babe well drink a little wine  
Forget about living like a legend before my time  
Forget about living like a legend  
Just forget about the road  
So look out for me darling  
On account of your man is coming home
