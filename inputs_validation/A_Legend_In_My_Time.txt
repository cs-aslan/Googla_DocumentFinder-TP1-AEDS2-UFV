If heartaches brought fame  
In loves crazy game  
Id be a legend in my time  
  
If they gave gold statuettes  
For tears and regrets  
Id be a legend in my time  
  
But they dont give awards  
And theres no praise or fame  
For a heart thats been broken  
Over love thats in vain  
  
If loneliness meant world acclaim  
Everyone would know my name  
Id be a legend in my time  
  
But they dont give awards  
And theres no praise or fame  
For a heart thats been broken  
Over love thats in vain  
  
If loneliness meant world acclaim  
Then everyone would know my name  
Id be a legend in my time  
Id be a legend in my time
