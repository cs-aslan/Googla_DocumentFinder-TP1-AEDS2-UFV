Life is much mo precious  
Than youll think  
Like a gamell make yo chips sink  
Its so hard  
Hard to trust a smile and face  
When niggas got intentions already taking yo place  
Keep my head up and stand tall  
If I stumble then Ill fall  
Will you pick me up at all  
Will you pick me up at all  
Im a keep it gangsta till my end  
Cause some people do pretend  
And aint too many of us that we can call friends  
That we can call friends  
Ohhhhhhh  
  
Now all I gotta do is keep my head up  
And walk a straight line when fake friends wont mind  
But Im kindhearted  
And dont like being stepped on  
If I wasnt real I wouldnt be in this position  
Like that dogg I got a whole lot to say  
Im by myself with my rhymes when we kick it all day  
Lil Jay used to say Id never be nobody  
But you know what I never do  
Smoke it off like Gotti  
Five million dollar hits puttin in saxophones  
Tray Deee and Snoop we sound good on this microphone  
I never threaten nobody to make it happen  
Let me show you how we eat a full meal off this rappin  
But if I had a chance to give it back  
Id give it to the ones who helped me do that  
Do that straight from the heart  
Eastside till I die  
We aint no contract friends we doggs for life  
  
Its a trip how we Crip  
Suppose the enemies still  
With both sides ride causing plenty of tears  
Insanes and twenties both from the same city  
A bunch of down niggas and it aint that many  
Me see and the G can think back to the start  
Homies chillin getting high shooting craps in the park  
And having a heart  
To get em up if it was beef  
Head up like Gs take it out in the street  
Hold ya own was the code that I growed to view  
So I fucked with and stuck with a chosen few  
But Snoop Dogg you can call me whatever the case  
And homie that aint nothing that the set could erase  
You put me with the homie Goldie though we never had spoke  
A Insane with a twenty now we hell of a close  
And whyall kids my kids so we family now  
Cause I could never see you doing bad without  
And thats real  
  
Life is much mo precious  
Than youll think  
Like a gamell make yo chips sink  
Its so hard  
Hard to trust a smile and face  
When niggas got intentions already taking yo place  
Keep my head up and stand tall  
If I stumble then Ill fall  
Will you pick me up at all  
Will you pick me up at all  
Im a keep it gangsta till my end  
Cause some people do pretend  
And aint too many of us that we can call friends  
That we can call friends
