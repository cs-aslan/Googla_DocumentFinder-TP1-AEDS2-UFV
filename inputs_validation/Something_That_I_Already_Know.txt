Here we are seven days  
And seven nights of empty tries  
Its ritual habitual  
But its never gonna work this time  
  
Were to the point of no return  
And along the way the only thing weve learned  
Is how to hurt each other  
  
Im looking back and wondering why  
It took so long to realize  
That nothings changed it never will  
All these years of standing still  
And still we stay in all this pain  
And nothings gonna make it go away  
  
I dont wanna wait another minute  
Put me out of my misery  
I can read your mind baby youre not in it  
And were not what we used to be  
No you wouldnt have to lie to me  
If you would only let me go  
And I dont wanna wait another minute to hear  
Something that I already know  
I know I know I know  
Something that I already know  
I know I know I know  
  
So save your voice  
Dont waste your breath  
Cant you see were at the end  
And this goodbye is permanent  
So wish me well and try to forget  
  
And all the fights  
And all the ways  
We almost made it  
But we never did  
And its finally come to this  
  
I dont wanna wait another minute  
Put me out of my misery  
I can read your mind baby youre not in it  
And were not what we used to be  
No you wouldnt have to lie to me  
If you would only let me go  
And I dont wanna wait another minute to hear  
Something that I already know  
  
We can not hide what weve become  
So sick and tired of being numb  
Its done its done  
Its done  
  
I dont wanna wait another minute  
Put me out of my misery  
I can read your mind baby youre not in it  
And were not what we used to be  
No you wouldnt have to lie to me  
If you would only let me go  
And I dont wanna wait another minute to hear  
Something that I already know  
I know I know I know  
Something that I already know  
I know I know I know  
Something that I already know  
Cause I know I know I know  
Cause I know cause I know
