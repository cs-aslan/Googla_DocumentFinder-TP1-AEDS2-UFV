Tell me his name  
I want to know  
The way he looks  
And where you go  
I need to see his face  
I need to understand  
Why you and I came to an end  
  
Tell me again  
I want to hear  
Who broke my faith in all these years  
Who lays with you at night  
When Im here all alone  
Remembering when I was your own  
  
Chorus  
Ill let you go  
Ill let you fly  
Why do I keep on asking why  
Ill let you go  
Now that I found  
A way to keep somehow  
More than a broken vow  
  
Tell me the words I never said  
Show me the tears you never shed  
Give me the touch  
That one you promised to be mine  
Or has it vanished for all time  
  
Chorus  
  
I close my eyes  
And dream of you and I  
And then I realize  
Theres more to life than only bitterness and lies  
I close my eyes  
  
Id give away my soul  
To hold you once again  
And never let this promise end  
  
Chorus
