We got over two million motherfuckers locked up  
Let me out this motherfucker Stop snitchin  
  
Now how many MCs must get booed  
Before somebody say dont fuck with Cube you know  
Ill strip you nude buttass in your living room  
Face down paralyzed from the waist down  
Im a buckin clown but dont fuck around  
Doin movies now but Ill lay you down  
South Central style pull them thangs out  
Dont make a millionaire have to send you there  
You know the story of the tortoise nigga and the hare  
Nigga run nigga run never get there  
Ima walk fuck a bitch when I get there  
Nigga this a marathon ask Farrakhan  
Fuck the cemetery that Im buried on fuck em  
The blood of Ice Cube got to carry on forever

Chorus  
You can have whatever you want  
In the hood its dos and donts  
So when it get hot in this kitchen  
Stop snitchin nigga stop snitchin  
  
Ice Cube  
Microphone master super rhyme maker  
Gun blaster whos the life taker who  
Who the fuck is a lifetime Laker  
I slap the Maybeline off Tammy Faye Baker  
Who the fuck got more than an acre  
In Los Angeles I got to have paper  
Im a nigga dont talk to my neighbors  
Straight asshole always up in Vegas yay yay  
Lay it out for these niggas to follow  
Get the point but these points is hollow  
Now this here is hard to swallow  
But if you do its like hittin the lotto  
Little nigga with big bravado  
Hit the throttle niggas hit the bottle  
Can give a fuck if they life is hollow  
Where the fuck was you when I rocked the Apollo bitch  
  
Ay who put this thing together Me thats who  
Who I trust Who I trust me thats who  
  
Nigga nigga nigga cant you see  
Somehow your words incarcerate me  
Float like a butterfly sting like a bee  
Lock me up in my prime Muhammad Ali  
Get out whoop yo ass like Muhammad Ali  
Rumble in the Jungle nigga dont play Dumbo  
In the hood nigga known as Columbo  
Get the people on the phone tell the jumble  
Spit fluid and swear he didnt do it  
Got my bottom bitch locked up with Martha Stewart  
She say she had the hoe cookin deep dish  
She say Martha fuckin cook fish and eat fish  
Westside yall niggas got to peep this  
Thats your weakness cant keep a secret  
Dont say shit boy thats basic  
They want to send a nigga back to the slave ship  
Stop snitchin  
  
Chorus  
  
You can have whatever you choose  
But out here its donts and dos  
So after we finish this mission  
Stop snitchin nigga stop snitchin
