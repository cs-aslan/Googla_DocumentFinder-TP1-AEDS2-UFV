She said that shed take it off  
Right here  
Take it off  
Right now  
Give him back his ring and stay with me  
She must think thats what I want to hear  
  
Good as it may sound  
I kno myself and that cant be  
And I didnt feel bad about it  
Had to remind her taht we were just pretend  
  
I said baby I want you  
But he needs you  
Stay with the real thing  
I never loved you like him  
See I only want you  
But baby he needs you  
Stay with the real thing  
Stay with the real thing  
Stay witchya man  
  
Here comes a tear  
Here comes a tear  
Baby please dont cry  
Dont cry  
I thought you knew what this was  
Baby neva coulda take the place  
Of ur husband  
But well always be friends  
Baby we shouldnt have become lovers  
  
And I didnt feel bad about it  
Had to remind her that we were just pretend  
I said baby I want you  
But he needs you  
Stay with the real thing  
Ill never love you like he does  
See I only want you  
Baby he needs you  
Stay with the real thing  
Stay with the real thing  
Stay witchya man

Oh cus I only want you  
But he needs you  
  
Stay with the real thing

Stay with the real thing
