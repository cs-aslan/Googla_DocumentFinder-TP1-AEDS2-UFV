For those who seek the face of God  
For those who call the name of Christ  
The road upon this earthly sod  
Will one day lead to Paradise  
We embrace the cross of Calvary  
Pressing toward the prize we will receive  
chorus  
Were waiting on new wings  
Searching an old sky  
Waiting for the day we see Heaven coming down  
Theres a Promiseland awaiting  
But theres mercy in the meantime  
While were walking on this ground  
Between crosses and crowns  
We stumble and we lose our way  
We question what were doing here  
Yet all the time we watch and pray  
Were wondering if the end is near  
So He left us His amazing grace  
Until we see Him face to face  
chorus  
Were pilgrims on a mission field  
Where the heart gets changed  
And the soul gets healed  
Theres a purpose in these shadowlands  
Between the crowns of gold  
And the nailscarred hands  
chorus
