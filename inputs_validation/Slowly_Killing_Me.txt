Oh I cant live without you and Im barely living with you  
I cant get her off your mind and I cant set you free  
When you look at one another your look tells me you love her  
And thats the part that slowly killing me  
Oh whats this other woman done to you  
She cant ever love you like I do  
Cry tears enough to drown me heartaches closing in around me  
And thats the part that slowly killing me  
 steel   
Oh whats this other woman done to you  
Why she cant ever love you like I do  
Id die the night you leave me I cry but you dont see me  
And thats the part that slowly killing me  
Yes thats the part that slowly killing me
