I have loved you only in my mind  
But I know that there will come a time  
Youll feel this feeling I have inside  
  
Youre a hopeless romantic is what they say  
Falling in and out of love just like a play  
Memorizing each line I still dont know what to say  
What to say  
  
Chorus  
Dont know what to do whenever you are near  
Dont know what to say my heart is floating in tears  
When you pass by I could fly  
Every minute every second of the day  
I dream of you in the most special way  
Youre beside me all the time  
  
I have loved you and Ill always will  
Call it crazy but I know someday youll feel  
This feeling I have for you inside  
  
Im a hopeless romantic I know I am  
Memorized all the lines but here I am  
Struggling for words I still dont know what to say  
  
Chorus  
  
Every minute every second of the day  
I dream of you in the most special way  
Youre beside me all the time  
  
All the time Repeat x 3
