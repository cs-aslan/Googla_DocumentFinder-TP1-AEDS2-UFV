Dear Mother said a poor blind boy  
That little bird sings very long  
And do you see him in his joy  
And is he pretty as his song  
  
The mother looked and replied  
I see that bird on yonder tree  
The poor boy smiled and softly said  
Mother I wish that I could see  
  
Yet I the fragrant flowers can smell  
And I can feel the green leaves shade  
And I can hear the notes that swell  
From those dear birds that God has made  
  
So mother God to me is kind  
Though sightless he has not given  
But tell me is there any blind  
Among the children up in heaven  
  
Blind oh no my friend I am not blind  
My eyes may be closed but I dont mind  
For I see things far beyond your sight  
Cause God gave me a sense to guide me alright  
  
You dont understand  
How happy I can be  
Friend lifes not made up alone  
Of what our eyes can see  
  
Why you can see mountains  
And rivers and trees  
And you can find beauty in the flowers  
And the birds and the bees  
  
Why I find a beauty  
That youll never know  
The kind that comes from way inside  
The kind that comforts so  
  
Ive learned to think of everything  
As beautiful and bright  
Cause God gave me that inner sense  
To take the place of light  
  
Oh nom my darlin they all see  
But why ask me but why ask me you think so odd  
Why mother Gods so good to me  
I thought Id like to look at God  
  
Will be so nice when I can see  
But mother when you get up there  
Please tell me mother that its you  
Because Ive never saw you here  
  
He said no more but fondly smiled  
Until the finale blow was given  
And God took up that poor blind boy  
And opened first his eyes in heaven
