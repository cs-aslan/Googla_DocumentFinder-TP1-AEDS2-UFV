Jonathan call again  
Take me to Coney Island  
Take me on the train  
Kiss me while I calculate  
And calibrate and heavens sakes  
Dont make me explain  
  
Just tolerate my little fist  
Tugging on your forest chest  
I dont wanna talk about  
I dont wanna talk about anything  
I dont wanna talk about  
I dont wanna talk about anything  
  
Jonathan anything  
And anyone that you have done  
Has gotta be alright with me  
If shes part of  
The reason you are how you are  
Shes alright with me  
  
Just tolerate my little fist  
Tugging on your forest chest  
I dont wanna talk about  
I dont wanna talk about anything  
I dont wanna talk about  
I dont wanna talk about anything  
  
You like to captain  
A capsized ship  
But I like watching you live
