Now I dont mind if you find that Im a shoulder to cry on rely on  
But the burden is just too much Im losing touch with myself and my health  
  
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me  
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me  
  
Now I dont keep you from your sleep I need some ease Im tired of trying to
please  
And it seems that my dreams are coming farther and fewer in between  
  
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me  
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me
