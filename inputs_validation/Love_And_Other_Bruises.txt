As the time slips through your fingers  
Till its almost time to go  
And the morning breaks between us  
And the ice melts into snow  
Im alright loving you  
Im alright loving you  
  
Love and other bruises didnt have to choose us  
But it did and Im alive and Im trying to survive  
Love and other bruises makes us all good losers  
I cant help it talking loud its because Im on a cloud  
Wont you please take me home  
Wont you please please take me home  
Im so mixed up over you  
I dont want to be alone  
Im alright loving you  
Im alright loving you
