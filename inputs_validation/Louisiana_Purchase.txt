Louisiana purchase Ill tell you what it means  
It means Id like to sell you New Orleans  
Come on come on  
And you all can go to town way down in New Orleans  
Louisiana salesman with nothing in his jeans  
Thats why Id like to sell you New Orleans  
Come on come on  
And do all the things there are to do in New Orleans  
Where does that heat come from  
That rhythmic beat come from  
And that red meat come from  
New Orleans  
Louisiana purchase I told you what it means  
So wont you let me sell you New Orleans  
Come on come on  
And you all can go to town way down in New Orleans
