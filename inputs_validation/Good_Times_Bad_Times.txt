Thereve been good times  
Thereve been bad times  
I have my share of hard times too  
But I lost my faith in the world  
Honey when I lost you  
  
Remember the good times weve had together  
Dont you want them back again  
Though these hard times are bugging me now  
Honey now its a sin  
  
Theres gotta be trust in this world  
Or it wont get very far  
Well trust in someone  
Or theres gonna be war
