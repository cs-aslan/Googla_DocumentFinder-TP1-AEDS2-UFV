Were in the building where they make us grow  
And Im frightened by the liquid engineers  
Like you  
  
My Mallory heart is sure to fail  
I could crawl around the floor just like Im real  
Like you  
  
The sound of metal I want to be you  
I should learn to be a man  
Like you  
  
Plug me in and turn me on  
Oh everything is moving  
  
I need my treatment its tomorrow they send me  
Singing I am an American  
Do you  
  
Picture this if I should make the change  
Id like to pull the wires from the wall  
Did you  
  
And who are you and how can I try  
Here inside I like the metal  
Dont you  
  
All I know is no one dies  
Im still confusing love with need
