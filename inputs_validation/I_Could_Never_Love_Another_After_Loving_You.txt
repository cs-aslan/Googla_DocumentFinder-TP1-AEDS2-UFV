Girl I cant believe my ears  
Are you really telling my goodbye  
See youve taken away my reason for livin  
And you wont even tell me why  
Before you walk out the door  
Theres something I want you to know  
  
That I could never ever love another after loving you  
Oh ho  
No other love will I share cause none could compare  
After loving you  
  
It was only yesterday  
Your words are still fresh in my mind  
Baby you said  
Long as rivers flow  
Each day youd love me more  
Now you want to leave me behind  
Listen baby I dont know what its gonna take to make you stay  
I just know Ive got to find a way  
  
Cause I could never never never ever love another after loving you  
Oh ho  
No other love will I share cause none none could compare  
After loving you  
  
So baby please stay beside me  
I need your sweet love to guide me  
Oh baby baby baby baby baby baby  
Oh after loving you  
  
I could never love another after loving you  
  
Baby baby baby

Long as rivers flow  
Each day youd love me more
