Well Here I come  
Stand up and plant your feet  
Listen Im letting off steam  
Now throw your hands in the air  
Let loose I dont fuckin care  
  
Rattle Head  
A dose of metal you need  
To bang your head til you bleed  
Its time for snapping some neck  
Slashing thrashing to Megadeth  
  
Rattle Head  
You Your head is pounding with pain  
Winning sinning beginning  
Feeding the needing for bleeding  
Bashing smashing crashing  
Fraying annhilating you  
  
Theres someone back in the shadows  
You feel though you cant see his eyes  
Hell bash your head if you cross him  
Aint quite your average guy  
Dont wear no leather to fittin  
Dont wear no spike to be cool  
Dont want no woman beside him  
Just make it fast Loud and Rude  
Rattle Head  
  
Im a Rattle Head  
Rattle your Goddamn Head
