I love the winter weather  
So the two of us can get together  
Theres nothing sweeter finer  
When its nice and cold I can hold my baby closer to me  
And collect the kisses that are due me  
I love the winter weather  
Because Ive got my love to keep me warm  
I love the winter weather  
Cause thats when you and I can get together  
  
Theres nothing sweeter finer  
When theres ice and snow  
Dont you know Ill hold you tightly to me  
And I will get that love that is due me  
I love the winter weather  
Because Ive got my love to keep me warm  
Take the summer you can have a ball  
Take the springtime or even the fall  
But I guess I like the winter most of all

Oh I love winter
