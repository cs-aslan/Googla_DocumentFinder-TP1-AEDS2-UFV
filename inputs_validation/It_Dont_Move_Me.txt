The kids are hungry  
And they line up and down the street  
Just to catch a glimpse  
Of the miracle of the week  
But I knew there was something wrong  
When the king had nothing on  
  
You say that it feels right  
You say that it fits tight  
You say that it moves light  
But it dont move me  
You say that its in time  
You say that it feels fine  
You say that it moves  
But it dont move me  
  
Excuse me baby  
But I just cant catch the thrill  
Of watching some joker  
On the big screen make the kill  
Im sorry if it breaks your heart  
But it dont tear me apart  
  
You say that it feels right  
You say that it fits tight  
You say that it moves light  
But it dont move me  
You say that its in time  
You say that it feels fine  
You say that it moves  
But it dont move me  
  
Everybody needs a new thrill a day  
And you know somebodys gonna sell it  
But when the screams die down  
And the dreams leave town  
Youre alone youre all alone
