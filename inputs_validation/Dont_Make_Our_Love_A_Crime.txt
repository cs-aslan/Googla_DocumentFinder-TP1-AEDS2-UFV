Give me passion Ill make it good  
Im not crazy just misunderstood  
And I want to be caught with you  
Oh yeah  
Ive been framed all my life  
Didnt do it Im no enemy  
Now I want to be blamed with you  
Oh no  
  
Dont you make our love a crime  
Please dont make our love a crime  
If you do well all regret it in time  
So dont you make our love a crime  
  
You murdered just a part of me  
Im still alive and breathin free  
I want to be punished with you  
I know what youre goin through  
You gave me a fatal bite  
I want to spend my time with you you you  
  
Dont you make our love a crime  
Please dont make our love a crime  
If you do well all regret it in time  
So dont you make our love a crime  
  
I know what youre goin through  
Its happened to me once before  
And I know what youre gonna do  
I want to spend some time with you  
Its stronger than it was before  
And Ive saved it up for you you you  
  
Dont you make our love a crime  
So please dont make our love a crime  
If you do well all regret it in time  
So dont you make our love a crime  
A crime no
