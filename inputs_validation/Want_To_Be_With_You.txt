When I think of all the things that weve been through  
And all the things weve yet to do  
I I start to realize  
The world is such a lonely place  
Want to be with you  
I remember all the heartaches we have known  
The angry nights when we were lonely  
The jealousy and pain  
Can we remain the same  
The world will have to hold its breath  
Want to be with you  
  
I dont need a reason  
I dont need to understand  
I just want to be  
Want to be with you  
  
Only want your love  
Only want you by my side  
Only want to be  
Want to be with you  
  
And when I look back down that road  
I see the turnings that we both made  
The choice we had to make  
The promises we break  
Are nothing more than memories  
Want to be with you  
  
The jealousy and pain  
Can we remain the same  
The world will have to hold its breath  
Want to be with you  
  
I dont need a reason  
I dont need to understand  
I just want to be  
Want to be with you  
  
Only want your love  
Only want you by my side  
Only want to be  
Want to be with you
