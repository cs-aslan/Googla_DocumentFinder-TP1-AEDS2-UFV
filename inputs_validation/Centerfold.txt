can you turn it up please just a tiny bit thatd be awesome  
  
Im on the rebound  
I get it where I want to  
Im on the way down  
Im getting fixed without you  
You gave me a bandaid  
I put it on my heartbreak  
And all you got is pictures in your hand  
  
Dont you wish you could hold  
The angel in the centerfold  
The fantasy you couldnt control  
That walked away from you  
Dont you wish that you could hold  
The pretty little paper doll  
The one you couldnt quite control  
Who walked away from you  
  
Flip to me Im the centerfold  
Im gonna charm you  
All night  
Stick to me Im the centerfold  
Were gonna go oh  
Hold tight  
  
Im gonna hate you  
til I forget you  
So heres a keepsake  
I left it in the bathroom  
Just a little something  
Something to remind you  
Im sure youll never get this close again  
  
Dont you wish you could hold  
The angel in the centerfold  
The fantasy you couldnt control  
Who walked away from you  
Dont you wish that you could hold  
The pretty little paper doll  
The one you couldnt quite control  
Who walked away from you  
  
Flip to me Im the centerfold  
Im gonna charm you  
All night  
Stick to me Im the centerfold  
Were gonna go oh  
Hold tight  
  
Flip to me Im the centerfold  
Im gonna charm you  
All night  
Stick to me Im the centerfold  
Were gonna go oh  
Hold tight  
  
Now its him but it couldve been you  
Tell me why its him when it shouldve been you  
Its crazy how this makes you wanna change  
Heres an image you wont forget  
All your life Ill tease Ill torment  
Ill be gone as soon as you turn the page  
  
Dont you wish you could hold  
The angel in the centerfold  
The fantasy you couldnt control  
Who walked away from you  
Dont you wish that you could hold  
The pretty little paper doll  
The one you couldnt quite control  
Who walked away from you  
  
Flip to me Im the centerfold  
Im gonna charm you  
All night  
Stick to me Im the centerfold  
Were gonna go oh hold tight
