I had a little girl now  
We crossed the state line  
It was more than just an overdraft  
We were looking at time  
If I do say so I cant let go  
And I dont take no for an answer  
If I do say so I cant let go  
And I dont take no for an answer  
We had to leave in a hurry now  
No time to hesitate  
It was worse than misunderstanding  
I had to ask her not to call it fate  
If I do say so I cant let go  
And I dont take no for an answer  
If I do say so I cant let go  
And I dont take no for an answer  
No one sleeps on the yellow line  
No ones that alone  
Someones in the window  
So dont try to use the phone  
Were just up against it  
We turned up in the zone  
If you ever get an overdraft  
Youll never make it home  
If I do say so I cant let go  
And I dont take no for an answer  
If I do say so I cant let go  
And I dont take no for an answer  
If I do say so I cant let go  
And I dont take no for an answer  
If I do say so I cant let go  
And I dont take no for an answer
