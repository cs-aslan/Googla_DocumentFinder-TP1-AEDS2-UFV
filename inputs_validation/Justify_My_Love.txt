I wanna kiss you in Paris  
I wanna hold your hand in Rome  
I wanna run naked in a rainstorm  
Make love in a train crosscountry  
You put this in me  
So now what so now what  
  
Wanting needing waiting  
For you to justify my love  
  
Hoping praying  
For you to justify my love  
  
I want to know you  
Not like that  
I dont wanna be your mother  
I dont wanna be your sister either  
I just wanna be your lover  
I wanna be your baby  
Kiss me thats right kiss me  
  
Yearning burning  
For you to justify my love  
  
What are you gonna do  
What are you gonna do  
Talk to me  tell me your dreams  
Am I in them  
Tell me your fears  
Are you scared  
Tell me your stories  
Im not afraid of who you are  
We can fly  
  
Poor is the man  
Whose pleasures depend  
On the permission of another  
Love me thats right love me  
I wanna be your baby  
  
Im open and ready  
For you to justify my love  
To justify my love  
Wanting to justify  
Waiting to justify my love  
Praying to justify  
To justify my love  
Im open to justify my love
