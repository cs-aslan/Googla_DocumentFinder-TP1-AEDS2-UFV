On the back cover of this album is a personal treasure  
This is my first and only selfportrait  
I drew it when I was three and a half and entitled it Me I am Mariah  
Please dont judge me for such a simplistic title  
Come on I was only three and a half  
  
It was a creative visualisation of how I saw myself  
With the purity of a childs heart before it was ever broken  
Ive kept this drawing private for so long  
But because this album is a reflection of some of the peaks and valleys that
have made me who I am today  
Ive decided to share it with those of you who actually care  
And have been here for me through it all  
Ive been through a lot but Ive always known me  
I am Mariah  
  
Along the way there have been a couple of nicknames  
And Ive inadvertently embodied many personas  
Lately theyve been calling me The Elusive Chanteuse
