Wanna tell you a story  
Bout a woman I know  
When it comes to lovin  
Oh she steals the show  
Aint exactly pretty  
Bitch aint exaclty small  
143956  
You can say shes got it all  
Never met a woman  
Never met a woman like you  
Doin all the things  
Doin all the things you do  
Aint no fairy story  
Aint no skin and bone  
But you give it all you got  
Weighin in at nineteen stone  
Youre a whole lot of woman  
A whole lot of woman  
Whole lotta Rosie  
Youre a whole lotta woman  
Oh honey you can do it  
Do it to me all night long  
Only one that turns  
Only one that turns me on  
All through the nighttime  
All around the clock  
Too much advising  
Dontcha never stop  
Shes a whole lot of woman  
A whole lot of woman  
Whole lotta Rosie  
Youre a whole lotta woman
