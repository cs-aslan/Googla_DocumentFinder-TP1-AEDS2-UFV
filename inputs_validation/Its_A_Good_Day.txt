Yes its a good day for singin a song  
And its a good day for movin along  
Yes its a good day how could anything go wrong  
A good day from mornin till night  
  
Yes its a good day for shinin your shoes  
And its a good day for losin the blues  
Evrything to gain and nothin to lose  
Cause its a good day from mornin till night  
  
I said to the sun good mornin sun  
Rise and shine today  
You know youve gotta get goin  
If youre gonna make a showin  
And you know youve got the right of way  
  
Cause its a good day for payin your bills  
And its a good day for curin your ills  
So take a deep breath and throw away your pills  
Cause its a good day from mornin till night
