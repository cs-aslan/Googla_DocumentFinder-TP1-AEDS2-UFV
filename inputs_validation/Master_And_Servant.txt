Theres a new game  
We like to play you see  
A game with added reality  
You treat me like a dog  
Get me down on my knees  
We call it master and servant  
We call it master and servant  
Its a lot like life  
This play between the sheets  
With you on top and me underneath  
Forget all about equality  
Lets play master and servant  
Lets play master and servant  
Its a lot like life  
And thats whats appealing  
If you despise that throwaway feeling  
From disposable fun  
Then this is the one  
Dominations the name of the game  
In bed or in life  
Theyre both just the same  
Except in one youre fulfilled  
At the end of the day  
Lets play master and servant  
Lets play master and servant  
Lets play master and servant  
Come on master and servant
