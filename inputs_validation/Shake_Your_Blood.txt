Looking for relief in your miserable life  
You need some rock and roll  
And you better get it right  
Got to roll them bones  
Do everything they say  
If youre cool youre the fool  
Make it work everyday  
  
Rock out do you quick  
My my my let it rip  
Rock out feeling good  
Break your heart Shake your blood  
  
Out upon the stage crowd is going wild  
Love to see them women babe  
I aint in denial  
Make you crazy too  
Make you show it out  
Feeling good get some wood  
You should You knew you could  
  
Rock out do it now  
My my my show me how  
Rock out make it good  
Break your heart Shake your blood  
  
Want to be a winner want to be the man  
Want to make yourself insane join up with the band  
Want to fall in love want to make your mark  
Want to get out in the storm want to break a thousand hearts  
  
Rock out strike it rich  
My my my its a bitch  
Rock out I knew you could  
Break your heart Shake your blood  
  
Rock out dont you stop  
My my my ride the rock  
Rock out aint so good  
Break your heart Shake your blood
