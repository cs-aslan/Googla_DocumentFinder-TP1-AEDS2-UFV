Be wise be smart behave my heart  
Dont upset your cart when shes so close  
Be soft be sweet but be discreet  
Dont go off your beat  
  
Shes too close for comfort  
Too close too close for comfort  
Please not again  
Too close too close  
To know just when to say when  
  
Be firm be fair be sure beware  
On your guard take care  
While theres such temptation  
  
One thing leads to another  
Too late to run for cover  
Shes much too close for comfort now  
  
Too close too close for comfort  
Please not again  
Too close too close  
To know just when to say when  
  
Be firm be fair be sure beware  
On your guard take care  
When theres such temptation  
  
One thing leads to another  
Too late to run for cover  
Shes much too close for comfort now  
  
One thing leads to another  
Too late to run for cover  
Shes much too close for comfort now  
Shes too close way too close  
Shes too close for comfort now
