Im sitting by the window of your 32nd floor apartment  
Waiting for your phone calls all to end  
Im sitting watching wind blow watching time go watching cars go by  
Im waiting for these memories to begin  
  
If I threw my guitar  
Out the window so far down  
Would I start to regret it  
Or would I smile and watch it slowly fall fall fall  
  
Garbage trucks and taxi cabs dont seem like they can reach me here  
The clamor of jackhammers seems so faint  
Well the way you treat me like the only slightly brings me down a lot  
I dont think that Ill ever be the same  
  
If I threw my guitar  
Out the window so far down  
Would I start to regret it  
Or would I smile and watch it slowly fall fall fall  
  
If I threw my guitar  
Out the window so far down
