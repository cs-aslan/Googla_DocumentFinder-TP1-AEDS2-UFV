14 hours to go  
And the waitings almost done  
When I get back home  
Youre going to be the only one  
  
Staring at the lights or staring at the sun  
Everyday another fight or ill to overcome  
Another day another place  
Forgot the name but not the face  
Ive been away for too long to remember  
  
14 hours to go  
And the waitings almost done  
When I get back home  
Youre going to be the only one  
  
Suspended animation countdown has begun  
Hurry up and wait for all of the things that must be done  
It doesnt matter what state Im in  
Theyve all been waiting so lets begin  
I know that when Im back Im going to miss it  
  
I hate it when someone complains about their life  
So I hope you know exactly what Im saying  
You wont get what you want without a sacrifice  
Just be careful what you wish for you might get it
