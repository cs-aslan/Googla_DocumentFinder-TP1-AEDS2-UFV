When you smilin when you smilin  
The whole world smiles with you  
Yes when you laughin oh when you laughin  
The sun comes shinin through  
  
But when you cryin you bring on the rain  
So stop your sighin baby and be happy again  
Keep on smilin keep on smilin baby  
And the whole world smiles with you  
  
Oh when youre smilin keep on smilin  
The whole world smiles with you  
Ah when youre laughin keep on laughin  
The sun comes shinin through  
  
Now when youre cryin you bring on the rain  
So stop that sighin be happy again  
Keep on smilin Cause when youre smilin  
And the whole world smiles with you  
  
The great big world will smile with  
  
The whole wide world will smile with you
