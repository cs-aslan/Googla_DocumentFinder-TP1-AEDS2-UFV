You walked in  
Caught my attention  
Ive never seen  
A man with so much dimension  
  
Its the way you walk  
The way you talk  
The way you make me feel inside  
Its in your smile  
Its in your eyes  
I dont wanna wait for tonight  
  
So Im daydreamin  
With my chin in the palm of my hands  
About you  
You  
And only you  
Got me  
Daydreaming with my chin in the palm of my hands  
About you  
You  
And only you  
  
For you oh oh oh  
For you oh oh oh  
For you oh oh oh  
For you oh oh  
  
Now I cant wait  
To hold you in my arms  
I know I was made for you  
Im in love with all your charm  
  
Its the way you walk  
The way you talk  
The way you make me feel inside  
Its in your smile  
Its in your eyes  
I dont wanna wait for tonight  
  
So Im daydreamin  
With my chin in the palm of my hands  
About you  
You  
And only you  
Got me  
Daydreaming with my chin in the palm of my hands  
About you  
You  
And only you  
  
But I want you  
Got to have you  
And I need you  
Like I never have loved you before  
  
Oh I want you  
Ooh I need you  
Got to have you  
Like I never have loved you before  
  
So Im daydreamin  
With my chin in the palm of my hands  
About you  
You  
And only you  
Got me  
Daydreaming with my chin in the palm of my hands  
About you  
You  
And only you  
  
For you oh oh oh  
For you oh oh oh  
For you oh oh oh  
For you oh oh
