So long Ive been looking too hard Ive been waiting too long  
Sometimes I dont know what I will find I only know its a matter of time  
  
When you love someone when you love someone  
It feels so right so warm and true I need to know if you feel it too  
Maybe Im wrong wont you tell me if Im coming on too strong  
This heart of mine has been hurt before this time I want to be sure  
  
Ive been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life  
Ive been waiting for a girl like you your loving will survive  
Ive been waiting for someone new to make me feel alive  
Yeah waiting for a girl like you to come into my life  
  
Youre so good when we make love its understood  
Its more than a touch or a word can say  
Only in dreams could it be this way  
  
When you love someone yeah really love someone  
Now I know its right from the moment I wake up till deep in the night  
Theres nowhere on earth that Id rather be than holding you tenderly  
  
Ive been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life  
Ive been waiting for a girl like you your loving will survive  
Ive been waiting for someone new to make me feel alive  
Yeah waiting for a girl like you to come into my life  
  
Ive been waiting waiting for you ooh Ive been waiting  
Ive been waiting  
Ive been waiting for a girl like you Ive been waiting  
Wont you come into my life
