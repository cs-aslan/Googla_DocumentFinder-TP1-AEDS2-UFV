My mama n papa told me son that youre just a fool  
When I told em I was leaving home I was leaving school  
So then in a couple of hours I found myself  
Heading down that southbound road  
With everything I owned on my back  
I carried such a heavy load  
  
And its a hard hard road that I travel  
Its a hard hard road that I travel  
Its a hard hard road that I travel down the line  
And its a hard hard road down the line  
  
Well I want to tell ya friends  
That its good to be a traveling man  
Cause Im doing what I want to  
Living just the best that I can  
Nobody putting rings around my neck  
To put me in a pigeon hole  
Ive got my dog and my radio  
To listen to some rock n roll  
  
And its a hard hard road that I travel  
Its a hard hard road that I travel  
Its a hard hard road that I travel down the line  
And its a hard hard road down the line
