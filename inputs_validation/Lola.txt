I met her in a club down in old Soho  
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca cola  
COLA cola  
  
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance  
I asked her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola  
LOLA Lola lo lo lo lo Lola  
  
Well Im not the worlds most physical guy  
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine  
Oh my Lola lo lo lo lo Lola  
  
Well Im not dumb but I cant understand  
Why she walk like a woman and talk like a man  
Oh my Lola lo lo lo lo Lola lo lo lo lo Lola  
  
Well we drank champagne and danced all night  
Under electric candlelight  
She picked me up and sat me on her knee  
And said Little boy wont you come home with me  
  
Well Im not the worlds most passionate guy  
But when I looked in her eyes  
Well I almost fell for my Lola  
Lo lo lo lo Lola lo lo lo lo Lola  
  
Lola lo lo lo lo Lola lo lo lo lo Lola  
  
I pushed her away I walked to the door  
I fell to the floor I got down on my knees  
I looked at her and she at me  
  
Well thats the way that I want it to stay  
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola  
Lo lo lo lo Lola  
  
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls  
Its a mixed up muddled up shook up world  
Except for Lola Lo lo lo lo Lola  
  
Well I left home just a week before  
And Ive never ever kissed a woman before  
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand  
And said Little boy gonna make you a man  
  
Well Im not the worlds most masculine man  
But I know what I am and Im glad Im a man  
And so is Lola  
Lo lo lo lo Lola Lo lo lo lo Lola  
  
Lola lo lo lo lo Lola Lola lo lo lo lo Lola  
  
Repeat and fade
