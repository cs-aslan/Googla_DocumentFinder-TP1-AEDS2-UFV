Where are the dreams that we once had  
This is the time to bring them back  
What were the promises  
Caught on the tips of our tongues  
  
Do we forget or forgive  
Theres a whole other life waiting to live when  
One day were brave enough  
To talk with conviction of the heart  
  
And down your streets Ive walked alone  
As if my feet were not my own  
Such is the path I chose  
Doors I have opened and closed  
  
Im tired of living this lie  
Fooling myself believing were right when  
Ive never given love  
With any conviction of the heart  
  
One with the Earth with the sky one with everything in life  
I believe well survive if we only try  
  
How long must we all wait to change  
This world bound in chains that we live in  
To know what it is to forgive  
And be forgiven  
  
Its been too many years of talking now  
Isnt it time to stop somehow  
Air thats too angry to breathe water our children cant drink  
Youve heard it hundreds of times  
  
You say youre aware  
Believe and you care  
But do you care enough  
Wheres your conviction of the heart
