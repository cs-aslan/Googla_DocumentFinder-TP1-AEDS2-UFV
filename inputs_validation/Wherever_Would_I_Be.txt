When my world is turning  
When its turning upside down  
When all I see is rain  
When I think the night wont end  
I just think of you  
And I can see the sun again  
Wherever would I be without you tell me  
If I didnt have you  
Whatever would I do now baby  
Whatever would I be without you  
Id be nowhere Id be nowhere  
When the dreams I dream  
All seem a million miles away  
When Im sure Ill never win  
When its looking like  
Ive left my faith  
I just look at you baby  
And I got reason to believe again  
Wherever would I be without you tell me  
If I didnt have you  
Whatever would I do now baby  
Whatever would I be without you  
Without you to love me  
Id just be wasting time  
And goin out of my mind  
Wherever would I be without you tell me  
If I didnt have you  
Whatever would I do now baby  
Whatever would I be without you  
Wherever would I be without you tell me  
If I didnt have you  
Whatever would I do now baby  
Whatever would I be without you  
Wherever would I be without you tell me  
If I didnt have you  
Whatever would I do now baby  
Whatever would I be without you
