Across the border they turn water into wine  
Some say its the devils blood  
Theyre squeezing from the vine  
Some say its a savior  
In these hard and desperate times  
You see it helps me to forget that were just born  
To die  
  
I came here like so many did to find a better life  
To find my piece of easy street  
To finally be alive  
And I know nothing good comes easy  
All good things take some time  
I made my bed Ill lie in it  
To die in its the crime  
  
You cant help but prosper  
Where the streets are paved with gold  
They say the oil wells ran deeper here than anybodys known  
Now I packed up on my wife and kid  
And left them both back at home  
See theres nothing in this pay dirt  
The ghosts are all I know  
  
Now the oils gone  
And the moneys gone  
All the jobs are gone  
Still were hangin on  
  
Down in dry county  
Theyre swimming in the sand  
Praying for some holy water  
To wash the sins from off our hands  
Here in dry county  
The promise has run dry  
Where nobody cries  
And no ones getting out of here alive Not this time  
  
In the blessed name of Jesus I heard a preacher say  
That we are all Gods children  
And Hed be back back someday  
I hoped that he knew something as he drank that cup of wine  
I didnt have too good a feeling as I head out to the night  
  
I cursed the sky to open  
I begged the clouds for rain  
I prayed all night for water  
For this burning in my veins  
It was like my souls on fire  
And I had to watch the flames  
All my dreams went up in ashes  
And my future blew away  
  
Now the oils gone  
And the moneys gone  
All the jobs are gone  
Still were hangin on  
  
Down in dry county  
Theyre swimming in the sand  
Praying for some holy water  
To wash these sins from off our hands  
Here in dry county  
The promise has run dry  
Where nobody cries  
And no ones getting out of here alive  
  
Men spend their whole lives waiting  
Prayin for some big reward  
But it seems sometimes the payoff  
Leaves you feeling like a dirty whore  
If I could choose the way Id die  
Make it by the gun or knife  
Cause the other way theres too much pain  
Night after night after night after night  
  
Down in dry county  
Where theyre swimming in the sand  
Praying for some holy water  
To wash the sins from off our hands  
In dry county  
The promise has run dry  
Where nobody cries  
No ones getting out of here  
Dry county  
And no ones getting out of here  
Dry county
