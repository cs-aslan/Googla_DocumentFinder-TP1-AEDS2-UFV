Some day Im going to grow up  
And be every mans dream  
Some day Im going to grow up  
And forget this sad little me  
Im going to shine in the spotlight  
Wear sexy clothes  
Be somebody everybody wants to meet  
And no one ever really knows  
No one will ever know me  
  
Im an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
Im an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
  
Critics will adore me  
At least they will at first  
But you see I already know this  
So it cant never really hurt  
And if it does Im an actress  
Ill play it nonchalant  
In the total scheme of things its insignificant  
Sure I can take the knocks  
  
Cause Im an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
Im an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
  
I may not be that pretty now  
But whos the referee  
Standards of beauty  
Will be redefined because of me  
  
And then theyll be the scandals  
Everywhere my name  
Men will jump from balconies  
And Ill just shrug and take the blame  
Yeah theyll say I died for love  
  
Cause Im an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
Well Im an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
  
My acceptance speech will be a milestone  
Never will such a star  
Have ever graced the microphone  
And of course Ill thank my agent  
The way they always do  
Though I could have done it without him  
And that goes for the Academy too  
And the makeup people and the lighting designers and everybody else  
  
Cause Im an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
Im an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
Im an actress yeah yeah yeah  
  
Ill be gracious to the lesser stars  
And generous to the unknowns  
And if another actress threatens  
My position on the throne  
  
Well I dont know exactly what Ill do  
I dont exactly know  
But I know that it could turn into  
One of my most poignant roles  
Everyone will have their handkerchiefs out  
And theyll have to leave the theater early  
And then theyll go home  
And whatll they do  
Theyll have a big glass of alcohol  
  
Cause Im an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
And if I make it to the top I wont be overthrown  
Im an actress ah yeah yeah
