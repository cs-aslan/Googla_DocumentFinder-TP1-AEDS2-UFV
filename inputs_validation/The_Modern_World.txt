This is a modern world this is the modern world  
What kind of a fool do you think I am  
You think I know nothing of the modern world  
All my life has been the same  
Ive learned to live by hate and pain  
Its my inspiration drive  
Ive learned more than youll ever know  
Even at school I felt quite sure  
That one day I would be on top  
And Id look down upon the map  
  
The teachers who said Id be nothing  
This is the modern world that Ive learnt about  
This is the modern world we dont need no one  
To tell us whats right or wrong  
Say what you like cause I dont care  
I know where I am and going too  
Its somewhere I wont preview  
Dont have to explain myself to you  
I dont give two fucks about your review
