I used to be a little bit shy  
I kept my deepest feelings inside  
Speaking up to you about my emotions has always been hard  
But this just cant wait  
Tonight I feel a little bit brave  
So I wont let one more day pass without you explaining what we are  
  
This is gonna sound kind of silly  
But I couldnt help but notice  
The last time you kissed me  
You kept both eyes open  
Baby can you tell me what does that mean  
If youre looking all over your shoulder  
Then you dont need to be with me  
And I dont need to hold on  
  
Chorus  
Dont let me let me stop you  
From doing what you wanna do  
You dont wanna stick just me its cool  
Take no chance getting over you  
No no dont let me let me stop you  
If you wanna leave baby you can leave  
Just dont pretend that youre into me  
If it aint true no dont let me stop you  
  
A lot of things I can take  
Got a high threshold for pain  
But lets get one thing straight Im not down to share you with anyone  
If thats not what youre looking for  
Nice knowing you but theres the door  
Cause I know that I can find someone wholl give me what I want  
  
This is gonna sound kind of silly  
If youre looking over your shoulder  
Then you dont need to be with me  
And I dont need to hold on  
  
Chorus  
  
Even if Im in the brokenhearted  
I wont lie  
I dont wanna hear goodbye  
But either way Ill be alright  
  
Chorus x2
