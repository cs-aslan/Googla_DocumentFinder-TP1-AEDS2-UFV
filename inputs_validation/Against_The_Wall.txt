Saw your light on  
From the second story  
So I waited  
Theres was nothing for me  
Shouldnt really be hard now  
Been a long time  
But I had it coming  
Hesitatiion is leaving me with nothing  
Ive been wanting to tell you  
For so long  
So long  
  
Didnt mean to fall  
Its got me up against the wall  
Ive wanted you all along  
But you couldnt hear me call  
Got me backed up  
In this corner  
And now Im gone  
You got me up against the wall  
  
Heard a siren  
Screaming out a warning  
In the silence of the early morning  
And Im thinking about you  
I know now  
This is how it should be  
All the best things  
That ever happened to me  
Never happened without you  
For so long  
So long  
  
Didnt mean to fall  
Its got me up against the wall  
Ive wanted you all along  
And you couldnt hear me call  
Keep me backed up  
In this corner  
And now Im gone  
You got me up against the wall  
  
Every time I turn around  
I can feel it getting through  
It turns me upside down  
And all I see is you  
  
Didnt mean to fall  
Its got me up against the wall  
Ive wanted you all along  
But you couldnt hear me call  
Got me backed up  
In this corner  
And now Im gone  
You got me up against the wall x2
