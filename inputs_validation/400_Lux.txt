Were never done with killing time  
Can I kill it with you  
Til the veins run red and blue  
We come around here all the time  
Got a lot to not do let me kill it with you  
  
You pick me up and take me home again  
Head out the window again  
Were hollow like the bottles that we drain  
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel  
Pulses can drive from here  
We might be hollow but were brave  
  
And I like you  
I love these roads where the houses dont change and I like you  
Where we can talk like theres something to say and I like you  
Im glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway and I like you  
We move in the tree streets  
Id like it if you stayed  
  
Now were wearing long sleeves  
And the heating comes on  
You buy me orange juice  
Were getting good at this  
Dreams of clean teeth  
I can tell that youre tired  
But you keep the car on  
While youre waiting out front  
  
You pick me up and take me home again  
Head out the window again  
Were hollow like the bottles that we drain  
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel  
Pulses can drive from here  
We might be hollow but were brave  
  
And I like you  
I love these roads where the houses dont change and I like you  
Where we can talk like theres something to say and I like you  
Im glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway and I like you  
We move in the tree streets  
Id like it if you stayed  
  
Were never done with killing time  
Can I kill it with you  
Til the veins run red and blue  
We come around here all the time  
Got a lot to not do let me kill it with you  
  
And I like you  
I love these roads where the houses dont change and I like you  
Where we can talk like theres something to say and I like you  
Im glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway and I like you  
We move in the tree streets  
Id like it if you stayed  
  
And I like you  
And I like you  
And I like you
