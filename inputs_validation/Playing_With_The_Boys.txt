Id say it was the right time  
To walk away  
When dreaming takes you nowhere  
Its time to play  
Bodies working overtime  
Your money dont matter  
The clock keeps ticking  
When someones on your mind  
  
Im moving in slow motion  
Feels so good  
Its a strange anticipation  
Knock knock knocking on wood  
Bodies working overtime  
Man against man  
And all that ever matters  
Is baby whos ahead in the game  
Funny but its always the same  
  
Playing playing with the boys  
Playing playing with the boys  
After chasing sunsets  
One of lifes simple joys  
Is playing with the boys  
  
Said it was the wrong thing  
For me to do  
I said its just a boys game  
Girls play too  
  
My heart is working overtime  
In this kind of game  
People get hurt  
Im afraid that someone is me  
If you want to find me Ill be  
  
Playing playing with the boys  
Staying playing with the boys  
After chasing sunsets  
One of lifes simple joys  
  
I dont want to be the moth around your fire  
I dont want to be obsessed by my desire  
Im ready Im leaving  
Ive seen enough  
with the boys  
Ive seen enough  
You play too rough  
  
Playing playing with the boys  
Ill be staying playing with the boys  
After chasing sunsets  
One of lifes simple joys  
Is playing with the boys  
Playing with the boys  
Playing  
Playing  
Playing  
Playing
