Could you be loved and be loved could you be loved and be loved  
Dont let them fool you or even try to school you oh no  
Weve got a mind of our own so go to hell if what youre thinking is not
right  
Love would never leave us alone  
I say the darkness there must come out to light  
  
Could you be loved and be loved could you be loved and be loved  
  
Could you be could you be could you be loved  
Could you be could you be loved  
  
Dont let them change you or even rearrange you oh no  
Weve got a life to live they say only only  
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive  
Stay alive  
  
Could you be loved and be loved could you be loved and be loved  
  
You aint gonna miss your water until your well runs dry  
No matter how you treat him the man will never be satisfied  
  
Could you be could you be could you be loved  
Could you be could you be loved  
  
Say something say something say something  
Say something say something say something  
  
Could you be could you be could you be loved  
Could you be could you be loved
