He just cant wait to graduate  
Hes marking time and counting days  
Hell toss that cap and watch that tassel fly  
So he can start living  
Yeah finally start living  
Cause hes got big plans  
And hell have time on his hands  
To start living  
  
Before he knows ten years are gone  
A deadend job a mortgage loan  
He wonders where the chances passed him by  
To really start living  
Yeah he wants to start living  
And soon hes sure  
He can finally afford  
To start living  
  
Hell read more books  
Hell make more love  
Hell talk more to the man above  
Hell watch the sunset in the west  
And visit Mexico  
Hell learn to cook hell play some ball  
Hell write that book hell make that call  
Hell take the time  
Some other time  
Someday hell do it all  
  
Well sittin in the barber chair  
He sees the silver in his hair  
Those golden years are comin right behind  
And then hell start living  
Hell really start living  
Yeah he feels tired  
Ah but soon hell retire  
And start living  
  
Hell read more books  
Hell make more love  
Hell talk more to the man above  
Hell watch the sunset in the west  
And visit Mexico  
Hell learn to cook hell play some ball  
Hell write that book hell make that call  
Hell take the time  
Some other time  
Someday hell do it all  
  
Well the doctor says Ive got bad news  
Afraid theres nothing we can do  
And all at once the tears are in his eys  
Hell never start living  
Never really start living  
Yeah he had big plans  
But theres no time on his hands  
To start living  
  
When he sees the pearly gates  
Hell really start living
