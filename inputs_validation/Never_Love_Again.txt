Dear Lord above  
I swear that I  
I will never love again  
Unless Im lovin him  
Oh no oh oh oh  
He came to me  
With a twinkle in his eye  
And I fell for him  
Yes I fell for him  
Took me by surprise  
Unaware was I  
Well I fell for him  
Oh I fell for him  
If I ever needed help I need it now  
Aint none of my socalled friends  
Got the power to make my tears go way  
So on my knees I pray  
That you bring his love my way  
Dear Lord above  
I swear that Ill  
Never never love again  
Oh no ho  
I stare down at the eyes  
And wipe the tears I cried  
When I fell for him  
Yes I fell him  
Gettin next to me  
Was all he wanted to see  
Well goodygood for him  
Goodygood for him  
When my hearts in trouble  
And my minds in doubt  
Youre the only one who could ever work it out  
And bring the sun back in my day  
So on my knees I pray  
That you send his love my way  
Dear Lord above  
I swear that Ill  
I will never love again  
Unless Im loving him  
No Ill never never never never  
Never never never gonna love again  
Oh yes Im never never never  
Never never never never gonna love again  
Dear Lord above  
I swear that Ill  
Never never never never love again  
Unless Im lovin him  
Said Im never never never never
