I am bottled fizzy water  
And you were shaking me up  
You are a fingernail running  
Down the chalkboard I thought I left in third grade  
Now my only consolation  
Is that this could not last forever  
Even though youre singing and thinking how well youve got it made  
  
Who are you  
And will you be through  
Yeah its just a phase  
It will be over soon  
Yeah its just a phase  
Yeah its just aphase  
  
Call it womens intuition  
But I think Im on to something here  
Temporaryism has been the black plague  
And the Jesus of our age  
I know that I sound opinionated  
Maybe biased and quite possibly jaded  
But sooner than later theyll be throwing quarters at you on the stage  
  
Who are you  
And will you be through  
Yeah its just a phase  
It will be over soon  
Yeah its just a phase  
Yeah its just a phase  
  
And I am waiting for it to be over too
