I had a dog he was a mix  
He loved me like a God  
But I was just a kid  
The kind mother likes  
Now Im big like the sky  
And Im down sized inside  
Ill put this all to rest  
Im just a baby who looks like a boy  
Im getting all depressed  
Im just a baby who looks like a boy  
  
I got my fathers sense  
And my big brothers pants  
And I look like a man  
And I feel like an ant  
Just a speck on the ground  
Growing like a weed  
A fleck of a seed  
  
Ill put my hand in flames  
Im just a baby who looks like a boy  
Feels like Im born again  
Im just a baby who looks like a boy  
Im just a baby who looks like a boy  
  
And Ill keep hanging from your hair  
And Ill keep playing in the sand  
Just as long as I can
