You have my heart  
And well never be worlds apart  
May be in magazines  
But youll still be my star  
Baby cause in the dark  
You cant see shiny cars  
And thats when you need me there  
With you Ill always share  
Because  
  
When the sun shines well shine together  
Told you Ill be here forever  
Said Ill always be a friend  
Took an oath Ima stick it out till the end  
Now that its raining more than ever  
Know that well still have each other  
You can stand under my umbrella  
You can stand under my umbrella  
Ella ella eh eh eh  
Under my umbrella  
Ella ella eh eh eh  
Under my umbrella  
Ella ella eh eh eh  
Under my umbrella  
Ella ella eh eh eh  
Under my umbrella  
Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh  
  
These fancy things will never come in between  
Youre part of my entity here for Infinity  
When the war has took its part  
When the world has dealt its cards  
If the hand is hard together well mend your heart  
Because  
  
When the sun shines well shine together  
Told you Ill be here forever  
Said Ill always be a friend  
Took an oath Ima stick it out till the end  
Now that its raining more than ever  
Know that well still have each other  
  
You can stand under my umbrella  
You can stand under my umbrella  
Ella ella eh eh eh

Its OK dont be alarmed  
Come here to me  
Theres no distance in between our love  
So go on and let the rain pour  
Ill be all you need and more  
Because  
  
When the sun shines well shine together  
Told you Ill be here forever  
Said Ill always be a friend  
Took an oath Ima stick it out till the end  
Now that its raining more than ever  
Know that well still have each other
