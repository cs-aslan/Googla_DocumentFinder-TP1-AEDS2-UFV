Its crazy  
I cant believe that you  
Would be the one to do  
Do me like you do  
Get back here baby  
  
Girl you let me  
Have my way and I was thinking I could get it again  
Baby we could be friends if you onlyssh  
And you show me  
Just how quick your tires could spin  
You were off in the wind  
Tell me were did you go  
  
When you left oh  
Im thinking which way did she go  
I should have known that you would lead me on girl  
Im in the wind on cruise control  
I gotta be dreaming cause I never felt like this before  
  
Chorus x2  
It was supposed to be  
Just a one night  
In and out and Im out the door  
But shes got me sitting here  
At the red light  
Driving round looking out for her  
  
Now its raining  
And Im looking over at the passenger side  
Thinking back in my mind how you set me off  
She was stopping and dropping me  
Switching from fast to slow  
But that aint have nothing on how you got  
When I got you home  
  
When you left oh  
Im thinking which way did she go  
The way you touched yourself had me up the wall  
Im in the wind on cruise control  
Im searching for you cause I cant seem to let you go  
  
Chorus x2  
  
You know  
I really only thought  
That this would be a one night stand  
What you doing to me  
Come on  
What you doing to me  
  
Maybemaybe  
Shes running home to someone elsesomeone else  
Or maybeor maybe  
She lost my number in her cell  
oh babe  
what you doing to me  
Or maybeor maybe  
Shes never done like this before  
Cause I cant see cant see  
Her not coming back for more  
More  
  
Chorus x4
