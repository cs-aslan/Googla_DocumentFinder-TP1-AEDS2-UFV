A third floor walkup  
One block east of Chinatown  
She walked by my window  
While the rain is pouring down  
Looking in she sees the easy money life everywhere  
And its clear she dont approve  
And its clear she dont approve  
Through a cloud of smoke I shoot a little smile over there  
And I wonder what shes thinking  
  
Chorus  
She dont Mah Jong Mah Jong she dont play  
She dont Mah Jong Wait she dont let me wait  
She dont Mah Jong Mah Jong she dont play  
  
But she loves to play  
  
With the dark eyes burning  
I am opening the wall  
Can there be no other chance  
I feel my fortunes turning  
And I wish for nothing else at all  
Looking up I see her signal with her fingers through her hair  
Telling me the hands are clean  
On the  
I turn a dragon tail into a pair  
And the game is over  
  
Chorus  
  
Though I dont obey her  
Still she loves to play her  
  
Chorus  
  
Though I dont obey her  
Still she loves to play her  
  
A tree blows up  
From where the lanterns light the parlors on the street  
Better not wage another her  
And though there are not many things a pawn would  
Ill beat  
We enjoyed the difference  
  
Chorus Repeats till fade
