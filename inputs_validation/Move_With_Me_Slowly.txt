Im lost in imagination  
Still contemplate animation  
I just groove on your breathing  
I do it all for you  
  
Youve got a problem witcha boyfriend  
He dont squeeze you right  
He got you facedown and waiting baby  
Keep you waiting all night  
So do me a favour  
  
Wont you  
Move with me slowly  
Get too close to me  
Move with me slowly  
Just like were meant to be  
Just like were meant to be  
  
Hey say sister  
Youre dreaming  
You got stars in your eyes  
A little conscious behavior  
Is gonna cut  
You down to size  
  
You hear me knocking  
So let me in  
When your blood runs cold  
And your love wears thin  
Its over passion  
Its under the skin  
If love aint a miracle  
It sure aint a sin  
So let me in  
  
Take me to the city  
Take me on my knees  
Take me anyway  
You find me baby  
Ive got this love disease  
And there aint nothin  
I can do
