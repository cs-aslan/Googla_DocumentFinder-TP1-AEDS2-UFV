Put aside the everyday world and come with us  
Into the realm of imagination  
The middle ground between light and shadow  
UNKLE

But could include among other notable figures   
DJ Shadow and James Lavelle

We had access to too many uh too much money  
Too much equipment and little by little we went insane  
Fiery the angels fell burning in the fires of Orc

A ticket to nothingness
