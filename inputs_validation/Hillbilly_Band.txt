There was an Ill wind blowing  
Through my hair last night  
That froze me in my blue jeans  
I couldnt find a light  
I know that somethings coming  
I can feel it in my bones  
Thank God  
For those old country boys  
I aint out here alone  
  
My friends all tell me  
I got daggers in my eyes  
Theres an anger in my heart  
That they dont realize  
Im mad as hell at something  
That I dont understand  
Thank God  
Im on the road tonight  
With this old hillbilly band  
  
Thank God  
Im on the road tonight  
With this old hillbilly band  
We may not be good looking  
But we sure get outta hand  
Was that The Devils stagecoach  
Flying over the Rio Grande  
Thank God  
Im on the road tonight  
With this old hillbilly band  
  
I swear that The Devil  
Came visiting me last night  
Surrounded my old stagecoach  
With his eerie light  
He was pounding on my windows  
Rattling my wheels  
I may not be The Devil  
But I know just how he feels  
  
Thank God  
Im on the road tonight  
With this old hillbilly band  
We may not be good looking  
But we sure get outta hand  
Was that The Devils stagecoach  
Flying over the Rio Grande  
Thank God  
Im on the road tonight  
With this old hillbilly band
