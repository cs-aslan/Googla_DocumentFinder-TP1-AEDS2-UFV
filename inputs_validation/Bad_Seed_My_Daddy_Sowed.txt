I was found in Wilson County just a mile outside of town  
On the doorsteps of two people who brought me up to where I am  
I was born to be a loser and my name nobody knows  
And as far as they concern Im just a bad seed daddy sowed  
They brough me up to the age of ten before they let me know  
And since that day it seemed that life lost its magic glow  
But they raised me right and every night in prayer we bowed our heads  
And they asked the Lord to light my path and guide each step I made  
But the path youre walking on becomes a mighty rocky road  
When you know that all youll ever be is a bad seed daddy sowed  
At thirty one my heart was won by a girl half my age  
And with love so strong I could see no wrong in decision that I made  
And you know I learned that there was truth in all I always been told  
Because you cant judge a book by its cover  
And everything thats shinin sure isnt gold  
Yes I guess Im guilty of dreaming an impossible dream  
Because the way the things turned out sure isnt way it seemed  
And so tonight Im leavin behind the only thing I ever had to call my own  
And I know as long as you live youre always be a reminder of all my wrongs  
But I hope that hell forgive me when hes old enough to know  
That just like me hell always be the bad seed his daddy sowed
