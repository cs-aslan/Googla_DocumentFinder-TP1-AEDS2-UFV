Our loves the moon  
Our loves the kingdom come  
Our loves a flame  
Our loves His will be done  
  
Our loves a jewel  
A diamond in the rough  
But you dont want it  
You dont want to take  
  
Chorus  
If this is the end  
I dont want to know  
This time  
If this is the end  
I dont want to go  
This time  
If this is the end  
  
Our loves true  
Our loves the rising sun  
Our loves in bloom  
Our love has just begun  
Our love is proof  
Of what was yet to come  
But you dont want it  
You dont want to take  
  
Chorus  
  
It was so easy  
We were so young  
Its only natural to come undone  
At the end of this evening  
Before the rise of the sun  
Youre coming with me  
Youre coming with me yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont want to know  
I just want to bide my time  
If this is the end  
I dont want to go  
I just want you by my side  
If this is the end
