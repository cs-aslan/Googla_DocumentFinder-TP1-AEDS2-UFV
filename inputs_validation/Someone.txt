So this is my apology  
For saying all those shitty things  
I wish I didnt really mean  
Im sorry Im not sorry  
You had your red flags up and raised  
More traffic than east LA  
But I drove in anyway  
My common sense on holiday  
  
People fall out of phase  
We were a crashed cause  
We were just be a place stuck on your passport  
You travel to some time  
But I hope youll find  
  
Someone to cry for  
Someone to try for  
Someone to turn your crooked roads into her streets  
Someone to fight for  
Someone to die for  
Someone whose arms will hold you tight enough to be  
The reason you breathe  
  
Be the reason you breathe  
  
You stay in love like vacation homes  
You like summer on the sunny coast  
But when the cold need a winter coat  
You say you will until you dont  
You wore a comb fist around your neck  
A different north in the ever end  
What did you get where you going yet  
Were sure the worst were sure the best  
  
I dont know how I fell into your rear view  
Paralyzed alibi I couldnt hear you  
So I hope you were right  
And I see you tonight  
With  
  
Someone to cry for  
Someone to try for  
Someone to turn your crooked roads into her streets  
Someone to fight for  
Someone to die for  
Someone whose arms will hold you tight enough to be  
The reason you breathe  
  
Be the reason you breathe  
  
So this is my apology  
For saying all those shitty things  
I wish I didnt really mean  
Im sorry Im not sorry
