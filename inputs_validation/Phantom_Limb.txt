No hope of rescue  
Im trapped here alone  
If I dont dig my own way out Ill die here  
  
Gave my loyalty too soon  
Now the forkedtongue pipers bill is due  
  
Weather is shifting  
So cold going numb  
Through a pinhole of light I see vultures circling  
  
Bottom feeders pick my skin  
Weathered brain a parasite within  
  
Ego pulverized  
No better medicine  
Angels have been advised  
Dont want no requiem  
  
Ill just haunt you like a phantom limb  
Ill just haunt you like a phantom limb  
Gonna wear you like a second skin  
Ill haunt you like a phantom limb  
  
Every new second  
Getting harder to breathe  
No matter which side I end up on this aint over  
  
My regrets are many true  
Still so much worse lies ahead for you  
  
Ego pulverized  
No better medicine  
Angels have been advised  
Dont want no requiem  
  
Ill just haunt you like a phantom limb  
Ill just haunt you like a phantom limb  
Gonna wear you like a second skin  
Ill haunt you like a phantom limb
