Stranger than the sunrise  
Darker than the night  
Fiercer than a rainstorm  
This is mans delight  
This is mans delight  
  
Weaker than a moment  
And hot as any fire  
Blinder than the blind eye  
This is mans desire  
This is mans desire  
  
I ran to a place in the open sea  
Where I pledged  
My life to the sun  
It was good for a while  
I could laugh I could smile  
But when I woke up one day  
The sun had gone  
  
So what of my meaning  
What am I trying to say  
What of my caution  
Im a man anyway  
Im a man anyway
