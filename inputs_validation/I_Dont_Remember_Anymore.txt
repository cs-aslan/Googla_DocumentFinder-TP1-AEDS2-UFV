I dont remember anymore  
I woke up freezin on the floor  
My head was buzzin like a saw  
I dont remember anymore  
  
She stole the bottle then she said  
Your eyes were blue and now theyre red  
I think Ill carry you to bed  
I dont remember anymore  
  
I want to rock and roll want to sell my soul  
Sail the tv round the swimming pool  
I want my name in lights a la johnny b goode  
Be an all night loon like a ronnie wood  
  
Dont read the writing on the wall  
cause if Im having me a ball  
I stand around till I fall  
And dont remember anymore  
  
I want to rock and roll want to sell my soul  
Sail the tv round the swimming pool  
I want my name in lights a la johnny b goode  
Be an all night loon like a ronnie wood  
  
She stole the bottle then she said  
Your eyes were blue and now theyre red  
I think Ill carry you to bed  
I dont remember anymore  
  
I want to rock and roll want to sell my soul  
Sail the tv round the swimming pool  
I want my name in lights a la johnny b goode  
Be an all night loon like a ronnie wood  
  
Dont read the writing on the wall  
cause if Im having me a ball  
I stand around till I fall  
And dont remember anymore  
  
I dont remember anymore  
I dont remember anymore  
I dont remember anymore  
I dont remember anymore
