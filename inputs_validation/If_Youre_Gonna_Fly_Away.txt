If youre gonna fly away  
dont fly without me  
dont go no where  
I need you babe  
  
Has the sun gone down on you  
Have you given up on truth  
I wish I could say all the right things  
To make your pain go away  
  
I wish you knew  
How beautiful you are in every way  
When the world is falling down  
Just kneel with me and pray  
  
Chorus  
If your gonna fly away  
Dont fly without me  
Dont go nowhere  
I need you Babe  
If you gonna leave this place  
Take me with you  
I could never live without you  
  
So youll take a thousand pills  
Hoping to be numb  
Lie awake in bed  
Counting all thats wrong  
  
No one understands  
No one ever will  
Trust me when I tell you  
I know just how you feel  
  
You had all these dreams  
But youre in a small town  
Oh they kill them for you  
You had nothing else to do  
But use and use and use and use  
  
Chorus  
  
Just sing a song for me baby  
Its not as bad as it seems no no no  
What matters today  
Wont matter tomorrow  
Count all your blessing  
Settle all your sorrow  
  
Chorus  
  
If you gonna leave this place  
Take me with you  
I could never live without you  
Oooo I need ya
