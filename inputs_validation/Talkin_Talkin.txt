Talking talking  
It doesnt really matter  
If you know my name  
It doesnt really matter  
If you see things the same  
As I do  
It doesnt even matter  
If Im tired and tense  
It doesnt even matter  
If Im still making sense  
Over you  
Im just talking talking  
Talking talking  
cause Im only talking talking  
Talking talking  
It doesnt matter  
What the people  
All around you say  
Be careful how  
You listen  
They dont know you  
The way that I do  
And if you want to  
Talk about it baby  
Thats alright  
Its better if I say it  
Than to sit down  
And write it to you  
Im just talking talking  
Talking talking  
cause Im only talking talking  
  
It can be that  
Youre here with me  
When Im standing out  
On my own  
The words of love  
That you gave  
When we were alone  
It doesnt matter  
If you want to  
Rock and roll all night  
I know youre gonna  
Be there when the  
Feeling is right  
The feeling is right  
The feeling is right  
Im just talking talking  
Talking talking  
Im just talking talking  
Talking talking  
You know Im just  
Talking talking  
Talking talking
