By Bob Dylan  
  
Yes the gal I got  
I swear shes the screaming end  
She wants me to be a hero  
So she can tell all her friends  
  
Well she begged she cried  
She pleaded with me all last night  
Well she begged she cried  
She pleaded with me all last night  
She wants me to go out  
And find somebody to fight  
  
She reads too many books  
She got new movies inside her head  
She reads too many books  
She got movies inside her head  
She wants me to walk out running  
She wants me to crawl back dead  
  
You need a different kinda man babe  
One that can grab and hold your heart  
Need a different kind of man babe  
One that can hold and grab your heart  
You need a different kind of man babe  
You need Napoleon Boneeparte  
  
Well when Im dead  
No more good times will I crave  
When Im dead  
No more good times will I crave  
You can stand and shout hero  
All over my lonesome grave
