I grew up in a typical way  
So I keep trying to unwind  
Cause Im agitated  
  
In this place so full of hate  
I keep trying to unwind  
You might think its pretty obvious  
So tell me what I say hey  
I way born in a typical way  
So I keep trying to go back  
And Im agitated  
  
In this world so full of pain  
I keep trying to go back  
You might think its pretty infantile  
So tell me what I know hey  
Day and night forever trading places  
Good and evil sleeping side by side  
In this world full of plenty of stuff  
Youd think thered be enough love to go around hey  
I was picked in a random way  
To be a singing dancing fool  
And Im agitated  
  
In this place going less than great  
I just a singing dancing fool  
If you dont like what I keep talking about  
Then tell me what I say hey  
Im agitated  
  
If you think you got it all worked out  
Then tell me what to know ho  
Im agitated  
  
Tell me what I say  
Do the mashed potatoes  
Tell me what I say  
Im feeling amputated  
Educated  
Im agitated
