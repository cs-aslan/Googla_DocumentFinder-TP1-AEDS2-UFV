Christmas times acoming  
Christmas times acoming  
Christmas times acoming  
And I know Im goin home  
Snowflakes a fallin  
My old homes a callin  
Tall pines a hummin  
Christmas times acoming  
Cant you hear them bells ringin  
Bringin joy to all hear them singin  
When its snowin Ill be goin  
Back to my country home  
Christmas times acoming  
Christmas times acoming  
Christmas times acoming  
And I know Im goin home  
Hollys in the window  
Homes where the wind blows  
Cant walk for runnin  
Christmas times acoming  
Cant you hear them bells ringin  
Bringin joy to all hear them singin  
When its snowin Ill be goin  
Back to my country home  
Christmas times acoming  
Christmas times acoming  
Christmas times acoming  
And I know Im goin home  
White candles burnin  
My old hearts ayearnin  
For the folks at home when  
Christmas times acoming  
Cant you hear them bells ringin  
Bringin joy to all hear them singin  
When its snowin Ill be goin  
Back to my country home  
Christmas times acoming  
Christmas times acoming  
Christmas times acoming  
And I know Im goin home
