Gone and got the blues in Paris  
Paris blues called AzureTe  
How can I be blue in Paris  
Easy cause youre far away  
Cant lose these blues this AzureTe  
Sidewalk tables filled with people  
Always happy always gay  
Still Im all alone in Paris  
Praying youll return someday  
Cant lose this blues this AzureTe  
  
Montmarte springtime Eiffel Tower  
Funny taxis the kids at play  
Paris without you is lonesome  
Yearning more and more each day  
Cant lose these blues this AzureTe  
If you knew how much I need you  
Youd come back to me to stay  
Having you with me in Paris  
Really is the only way  
Youd lose these blues this AzureTe  
These Paris blues this AzureTe
