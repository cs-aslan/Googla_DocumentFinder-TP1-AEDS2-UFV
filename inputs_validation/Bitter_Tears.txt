In the mist  
Of my endless search  
The best in life  
Becomes clear  
  
The rest just begins  
To fade by itself  
Thats a trick I learned  
Though it took so long  
  
Bitter tears taste so sweet  
Im seeing my way  
For the first time in years  
When the love around  
Begins to suffer  
And you cant find love  
In one  
In one another  
Push away those bitter tears  
Bitter tears  
  
And I thought I was doing no wrong  
And I thought I was doing no wrong  
  
In the hour  
Of your needs  
Lips are trembling  
Cause your gonna be free  
Realize what were doing here  
The time is right to kill your fears  
  
Bitter tears taste so sweet  
Im seeing my way  
For the first time in years  
When the love around  
Begins to suffer  
And you cant find love  
In one  
In one another  
Push away those bitter tears  
Bitter tears  
  
An I though I was doing no wrong  
Push away those bitter tears  
Thats what they call doing no wrong  
Thats what they call doing no wrong  
  
Push away those bitter tears Repeat x3  
  
Thats what they call doing no wrong
