They were sitting  
They were talking in the strawberry swing  
Every moment was so precious  
  
They were sitting  
They were talking in the strawberry swing  
Everybody was for fighting  
Wouldnt wanna waste a thing  
  
Cold cold water  
Bring me round  
Now my feet wont touch the ground  
Cold cold water  
What ya say  
Its such  
Its such a perfect day  
Its such a perfect day  
  
I remember  
We were walking up to strawberry swing  
I cant wait til the morning  
Wouldnt wanna change a thing  
  
People moving all the time  
Inside a perfectly straight line  
Dont you wanna curve away  
Its such  
Its such a perfect day  
Its such a perfect day  
  
Now the sky could be blue  
I dont mind  
Without you its a waste of time  
Could be blue  
  
I dont mind  
Without you its a waste of time  
Could be blue  
Could be grey  
Without you Im just miles away  
  
Could be blue  
I dont mind  
Without you its a waste of time
