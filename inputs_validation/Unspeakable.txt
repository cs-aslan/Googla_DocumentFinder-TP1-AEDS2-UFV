All I want to say to you  
Oh yeah  
  
I was unfeeling  
When you discovered me  
Give me a reason  
To not deny my needs  
I was unwilling  
To give my love away  
But you decided  
To give yours anyway  
  
Oh I cant express  
The feeling I posses for you baby  
  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable  
All I want to say to you  
Words cant describe it  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable  
All I want to say to you  
Words cant define  
Unspeakable  
  
Mm oh yeah  
  
Never thought I needed  
Someone to call my own  
But now that youve got me  
Dont ever let me go  
You leave me unwanting  
Your silence every need  
Nothing is missing  
No love is so complete  
  
Oh I cant express  
The feeling I posses for you baby  
  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable  
All I want to say to you  
Words cant describe it  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable  
All I want to say to you  
Words cant define  
Unspeakable  
  
Never had this feeling  
That brings me to my knees  
You helped me to recover  
Whats been eluding me  
Youre a sensation  
That makes my love run free  
And now Im speechless  
Its all so clear to me  
  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable  
All I want to say to you  
Words cant describe it  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable
