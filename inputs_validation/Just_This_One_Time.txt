JUST THIS ONE TIME  
WRITER JIMMY WEBB  
  
Ive got to try just one more time  
To help you believe in me  
Oh look into my eyes check my face  
For lies and you might see  
My lifes never been everything  
I want it to be but with you  
I could change this bad luck  
With you I could hold my head up  
And loving you  
  
Just this one time  
I need someone to believe in me  
Breathe it with me  
Get beneath it with me now  
Sweet darlin just this one time  
  
Ive got to say the perfect thing  
Oh I cant make mistakes now  
Oh Ive got to read your signs  
Ive gotta sing those magic lines  
Youve got to hear  
  
I know Ive given you every reason  
In this whole round world to fear me now  
But my loves a raging river  
And youve wrapped it in your hand  
Oh darlin  
  
Just this one time I need someone  
To believe in me believe in me  
Just this one time I need someone  
To leave it with me breathe it with me  
Get beneath it with me now sweet daddy  
Just this one time  
  
Just this one time  
I really need somebody  
repeat
