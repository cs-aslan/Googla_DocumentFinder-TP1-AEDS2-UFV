Share my life  
Take me for what I am  
Cause Ill never change  
All my colors for you  
  
Take my love  
Ill never ask for too much  
Just all that you are  
And everything that you do  
  
I dont really need to look  
Very much further  
I dont want to have to go  
Where you dont follow  
I will hold it back again  
This passion inside  
Cant run from myself  
Theres nowhere to hide  
  
Chorus  
Dont make me close one more door  
I dont want to hurt anymore  
Stay in my arms if you dare  
Or must I imagine you there  
Dont walk away from me  
I have nothing nothing nothing  
If I dont have you you you you you  
  
You see through  
Right to the heart of me  
You break down my walls  
With the strength of your love  
  
I never knew  
Love like Ive known it with you  
Will a memory survive  
One I can hold on to  
  
I dont really need to look  
Very much further  
I dont want to have to go  
Where you dont follow  
I will hold it back again  
This passion inside  
I cant run from myself  
Theres nowhere to hide  
Your love Ill remember forever  
  
Dont make me close one more door  
I dont want to hurt anymore  
Stay in my arms if you dare  
Or must I imagine you there  
Dont walk away from me  
I have nothing nothing nothing  
  
Dont make me close one more door  
I dont want to hurt anymore  
Stay in my arms if you dare  
Or must I imagine you there  
Dont walk away from me  
No dont walk away from me  
Dont you dare walk away from me  
I have nothing nothing nothing  
If I dont have you you  
If I dont have you oh ooo
