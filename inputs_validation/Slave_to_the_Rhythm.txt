She dances in these sheets at night  
She dances to his needs  
She dances til he feels just right  
Until he falls asleep  
She dances at the crack of dawn  
And quickly cooks his food  
She cant be late cant take too long  
The kids must get to school  
  
Chorus  
Shes a slave to the rhythm  
Shes a slave to the rhythm of  
Shes a slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love the rhythm of love  
  
Chorus  
Shes a slave to the rhythm  
Shes a slave to the rhythm of  
Shes a slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love the rhythm of love  
  
She dances for the man at work  
Who works her overtime  
She cant be rude as she says  
I must be home tonight  
She dances to the kitchen stove  
Dinner is served by nine  
He says his foods an hour late  
She must be outta her mind  
  
Chorus  
Shes a slave to the rhythm  
Shes a slave to the rhythm of  
Shes a slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love the rhythm of love  
  
She works so hard just to make her way  
For a man who just dont appreciate  
And though he takes her love in vain  
Still she could not stop couldnt break his chains  
She danced the night that they fell out  
She swore shed dance no more  
But then she did he did not quit as she ran out the door  
  
She danced through the night in fear of her life  
She danced to a beat of her own  
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride  
She knew she was needed back home home
