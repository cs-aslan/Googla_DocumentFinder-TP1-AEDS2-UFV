Turn on the radio take a listen  
What youre missing  
Personally Im sick of the ass kissing  
What Im kicking to you wont get rotation  
Nowhere in the nation  
Program directors and DJs ignored me  
Cause I simply said fuck Top Forty  
And top thirty top twenty and top ten  
Until you put more hip hop in  
Then I might grin but dont pretend that youre down with the see  
And go and dis me in a magazine  
How could you figure the brother could dig ya  
DJ face down in the river  
No its not a threat but a promise  
Im as  
Crazy as they come see  
Mama didnt love me  
All I got is my nine  
And to calm the savage beast heres the Alpine  
  
Turn off that bullshit  
Turn off that motherfucking radio  
Turn off that bullshit  
Turn off that motherfucking radio  
Turn off that bullshit  
Play the music motherfucker put the music on  
Damn  
  
Tune in to the radio listen for a minute  
Yo G stick a fucking tape in it  
Cause all the radio do is gangle  
That R and B love triangle  
If youre out there kicking it with the brothers  
You dont care about lovers  
You want to hear a young nigga on the mic  
Going buck wild  
Throwing and flowing and showing new styles  
Thats where Im coming from  
Reality thats what theyre running from  
So if youre down with Ice Cube let me know that you know  
Yo turn off the radio  
  
You know what You know what  
Basically those black guys and those rap guys  
They dont know what the fuck theyre doing  
I hate those fuckers  
I hate em  
Especially that one guy  
The AmeriKKKas most wanted  
Ice Cube I hate that fucker  
Get him off the air get him off get him off  
Get that rap shit out of here  
Just get me a gat so I can smoke this motherfucker
