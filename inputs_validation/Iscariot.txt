Until now I knew this of myself  
That if you had thrown yourself down  
Into the lions den  
My brother Id follow you in  
Perhaps I lack some foresight should have known  
Brother you were so right  
Sure as the setting sun  
Cant trust just anyone  
  
Thats what you want but its not what youre asking for  
I said thats what youre asking but youre gonna get more than you bargained
for  
I said thats what you had but you dont have it any more  
You had it coming  
  
I never imagined you dead I never  
But tell me are you even aware  
That all that we did you undo  
Iscariot you fool  
  
Thats what you want but its not what youre asking for  
I said thats what youre asking but youre gonna get more than you bargained
for  
I said thats what you had but you dont have it any more  
You had it coming  
  
Oh you know you had it coming my friend my friend  
You know you had it coming my brother oh my brother  
Had it coming my friend my friend  
You know you had it coming my brother oh my brother  
Had it coming my friend my friend  
You know you had it coming my brother oh my brother  
Had it coming my friend my friend  
You had it coming
