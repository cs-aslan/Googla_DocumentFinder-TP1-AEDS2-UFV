Ill take care of you  
Times are hard and rents are high  
What can the working girl do  
But struggle through another day  
Then Ill take care of you  
Nights are long and dreams are cold  
If theyre all you wake up to  
But sure you rise with crying eyes  
Ill take care of you  
So let em talk about us  
Let em call us funny things  
People sometimes do  
I dont care as long  
As you know I love you  
You know I do  
Ill be there but you might not see me  
Its not easy to get through  
But when the laughter dies Ill wake  
Ill take care of you  
Darling Ill take care of you
