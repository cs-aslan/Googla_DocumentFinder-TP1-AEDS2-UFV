I would die or kill  
Battle beg and steal  
Baby just to feel your eyes on me  
  
Give my secrets up  
Be slave to just your love  
One more moment of your eyes on me  
  
I dont know why I dont know how  
But youre burning me from the inside out  
And now I live  
Oh I live to hear you say  
Its you who lives to take my breath away  
  
The thing I wouldnt do for one more taste of you  
Im addicted to your eyes on me  
  
I dont know why I dont know how  
But youre burning me from the inside out  
And I only live  
Oh I live to hear you say  
Its you who lives to take my breath away  
  
The thing I wouldnt do for one more taste of you  
Im addicted to your eyes on me
