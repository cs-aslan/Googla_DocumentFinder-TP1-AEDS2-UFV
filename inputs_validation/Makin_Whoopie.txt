Another bride another June  
Another sunny honeymoon  
Another season another reason  
For makin whoopie  
  
A lot of shoes lot of rice  
The groom is nervous he answers twice  
Its really killin that hes so willin  
To makin whoopie  
  
Now picture a little love nest  
Down where the roses cling  
Picture the same sweet love nest  
Think what a year can bring  
  
Yes hes washing dishes and baby clothes  
Hes so ambitious he even sews  
But dont forget folks thats what you get folks  
For makin whoopie  
  
Another year maybe less  
Whats this I hear well can you guess  
She feels neglected and hes suspected  
Of makin whoopie  
  
Yes she sits alone most every night  
He doesnt phone he doesnt write  
He says hes busy but she says Is he  
Hes makin whoopie  
  
Now he doesnt make much money  
Only five thousand per  
Some judge who thinks hes funny  
Says youll pay six to her  
  
He says Now judge suppose I fail  
The judge says Budge right into jail  
Youd better keep her I think its cheaper  
Than makin whoopie  
  
Yes yeah youd better keep her I think its cheaper  
Than makin whoopie
