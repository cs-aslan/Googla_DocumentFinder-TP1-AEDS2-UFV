Really brings me down I dont know how  
That you can say youre not my kind  
Couldnt find a cloud for miles around  
Why do you change your story line  
It all goes gray again sometimes I dont know when  
To come out of the storm  
It feels like forty days and forty nights Ive been  
Beating on your door  
  
Im falling like rain  
Oh I I love ya love ya love ya  
Falling like rain  
Oh I Im coming down around ya  
I will always think about you  
  
My sentimental ways dont seem to phase you  
I dont ever want to force your hand  
If you met me one time just half the way  
I could meet you where you are  
Just meet me where I am  
Cause every now and then youve gotta drive right in  
Deeper than deep  
You take a chance and then you give the wheel a spin  
Anyone can see  
  
Im falling like rain  
Oh I I love ya love ya love ya  
Falling like rain  
Oh I Im coming down around ya  
I will always think about you
