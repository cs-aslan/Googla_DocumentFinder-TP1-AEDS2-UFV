Shes sweet and tender but I remember  
The girl I once knew made me feel so blue  
She loves me madly I treat her badly  
Cause girl it should be you it should be you  
It should be you it should be you  
I went all wrong when you were gone  
It seems ashame but Im to blame  
She loves me madly I treat her badly  
Cause girl it should be you it should be you  
It should be you it should be you  
What can I do to win her back  
She kisses me but its not the same  
Im broken hearted since we parted  
I wanna pick up from where we started  
She loves me madly I treat her badly  
Cause girl it should be you it should be you  
It should be you it should be you
