In the warm room  
Her perfume reaches you  
Eventually youll fall for her  
Down youll go  
To where the mellow wallows  
  
In the warm room  
Shell touch you with your Mammas hand  
Youll long to kiss those red lips  
But when you do  
Itll feel like kicking a habit  
  
Chorus  
Shell tell you that shell stay  
So youd better barricade the way out  
Shell tell you shes true  
Shell tell you she loves you  
Shes waiting in that warm room  
  
In the warm room  
She prepares to go to bed  
Shell let you watch her undress  
Go places where  
Your fingers long to linger  
  
In the warm room  
Youll fall into her like a pillow  
Her thighs are soft as marshmallows  
Say hello  
To the soft musk of her hollows  
  
Chorus  
  
In the warm room  
  
Shes waiting in that warm room
