Dont let your love go astray  
Save it for me  
Dont give your sweet kiss away  
Save it for me  
I know youre feeling blue  
Cause I feel blue like you  
Ill be strong as you  
Are and wait just as long as you  
Dont waste that look I adore  
Save it for me  
Just wait a little bit more  
Save it for me  
I know that you must cry  
Cry baby so do I  
Just sit tight  
And leave on your light  
Cause Im coming home to your arms  
Oh baby  
Im coming home to your arms  
Save it for me  
Save it for me  
I know that you must cry  
Cry baby so do I  
Ill be strong as you  
Are and wait just as long as you  
Save it for me  
Save it for me  
Save it for me
