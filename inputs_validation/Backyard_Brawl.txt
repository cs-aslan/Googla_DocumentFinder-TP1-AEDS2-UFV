Got a cut on my thigh got a nail in my eye  
And Im bleedin all over the wall  
Got a barbed wire bat and a dude on the mat  
Aint getting up soon at all  
  
Got a head full of rage and a belly full of hate  
Im the neighbourhood legend that just cant wait  
  
For the backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
  
Dont matter who you are dont matter what colour  
Brown or whitell do  
But if youre yellow youll be covered in red  
A whole lotta black and blue  
  
Jump off the trailer in a pile full o guys  
Scratching and kicking and pulverised  
  
For the backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
  
Only got six teeth but three of those  
Are sharp enough to bite off your nose  
  
At the backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard Brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard Brawl
