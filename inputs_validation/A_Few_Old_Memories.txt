Just a few old memories  
Slipped in through my door  
Though I thought I had closed it  
So tightly before  
I cant understand it  
Why it should bother my mind  
For it all belongs to another place and time  
  
Just a few old keepsakes  
Way back on the shelf  
No they dont mean nothin  
Well Im surprised theyre still left  
Just a few old love letters  
With the edges all brown  
And an old faded picture  
I keep turned upsidedown  
  
Just a few old memories  
Going way back in time  
Well I can hardly remember  
I dont know why Im cryin  
I cant understand it  
Well Im surprised myself  
First thing tomorrow morning  
Ill clean off that shelf  
  
Just a few old keepsakes  
Way back on the shelf  
No they dont mean nothin  
Well Im surprised that theyre left  
Just a few old love letters  
With their edges all brown  
And an old faded picture  
I keep turned upsidedown
