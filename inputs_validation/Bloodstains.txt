They can make things worse for me  
Sometimes Id rather die  
They can tell me tons of things  
But I cant see eye to eye  
Well I know they know the way I think  
I know they always will  
Someday Im gonna change my mind  
Sometimes Id rather kill  
  
Bloodstains speed kills  
Fast cars cheap thrills  
Rich girls fine wine  
Ive lost my sense  
Ive lost control  
Ive lost my mind  
  
All things seem so much different now  
The scene hasnt died away  
I havent got a steady job  
And Ive got no place to stay  
Well its a futuristic modern world  
But things arent what they seem  
Someday you better wake up  
From this fucked up fantasy  
  
Bloodstains speed kills  
Fast cars cheap thrills  
Rich girls fine wine  
Ive lost my sense  
Ive lost control  
Ive lost my mind  
  
Bloodstains speed kills  
Fast cars cheap thrills  
Rich girls fine wine  
Ive lost my sense  
Ive lost control  
Ive lost my mind
