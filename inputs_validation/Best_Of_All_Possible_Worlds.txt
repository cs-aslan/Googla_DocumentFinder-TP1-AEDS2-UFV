I was runnin through the summer rain tryn to catch that evenin train  
And kill the old familiar pain weavin through my tangled brain  
When I tipped my bottle back and smacked into a cop I didnt see  
That police man said Mister Cool if you aint drunk then youre a  
fool  
I said If thats against the law then tell me why I never saw  
A man locked in that jail of yours who wasnt neither black or poor as  
me  
Well that was when someone turned out the lights  
And I wound up in jail to spend the night  
And dream of all the wine and lonely girls  
In this best of all possible worlds  
Well I woke up next mornin feelin like my head was gone  
And like my thick old tongue was lickin something sick and wrong  
And I told that man Id sell my soul for something wet and cold as that  
old cell  
That kindly jailer grinned at me all eaten up with sympathy  
Then poured himself another beer and came and whispered in my ear  
If booze was just a dime a bottle boy you couldnt even buy the smell  
I said I knew there was something I liked about this town  
But it takes more than that to bring me down down down  
Cause theres still a lot of wine and lonely girls  
In this best of all possible worlds  
Well they finally came and told me they was a gonna set me free  
And Id be leavin town if I knew what was good for me  
I said Its nice to learn that evrybodys so concerned about my  
health  
They were obsessed with it  
I said I wont be leavin no more quicker than I can  
Cause Ive enjoyed about as much of this as I can stand  
And I dont need this town of yours more than I never needed nothin  
else  
Cause theres still a lot of drinks that I aint drunk  
And lots of pretty thoughts that I aint thunk  
And lord theres still so many lonely girls  
In this best of all possible worlds
