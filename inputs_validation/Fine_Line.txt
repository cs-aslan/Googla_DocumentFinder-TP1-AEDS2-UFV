A one two  
  
There is a fine line  
Between recklessness and courage  
Its about time  
You understood which road to take  
Its a fine line  
When your decision makes a difference  
Get it wrong youll be making a big mistake  
  
Chorus  
Come on brother  
All is forgiven  
We all cried when you were driven away  
Come on brother  
Everything is better  
Everything is better  
When you come home and stay  
  
Whatevers more important to you  
Youve got to choose what you want to do  
Whatevers more important to be  
Thats the view that youve got to see  
  
There is a long way  
Between chaos and creation  
If you dont say  
Which one of these youre gonna choose  
Its a long way  
And in every contradiction  
Seems to say  
Its a game you are bound to lose  
  
Chorus  
  
Come on back come on back  
Come on back to me  
  
Its a fine line  
Its a fine line  
Whatevers more important to you  
Its a fine line  
Youve got to choose what you want to do  
Its a fine line  
Whatevers more important to be  
Its a fine line  
Well thats the view that youve got to see  
  
Its a fine line  
Its a fine line  
Its a fine line  
Its a fine line  
Its a fine line  
Its a fine line
