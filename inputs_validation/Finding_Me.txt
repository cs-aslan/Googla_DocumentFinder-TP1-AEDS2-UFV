I dont think you notice  
When you see my face  
I guess youre waiting  
To spin me around again  
  
Wheels I guess are turning  
Somewhere inside my head  
I know that this is  
Deeper than you get  
  
But youre coming back again  
You dont mean to waste my time  
But youre coming back so  
  
Chorus  
Dont tell me  
How to be  
Cause I like some suffering  
Dont ask me  
What I need  
Im just fine  
Here finding me  
Me  
  
Ive already given  
Up on getting through  
I never question  
Who Im talking to  
  
Oh so much for nothing  
But nothing means so much  
I know its touching  
But Ive been out of touch  
  
And its all that I can do  
Im a sight for my sore eyes  
But its all I am so  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont think you notice  
When I cant reach out  
I guess youre waiting  
On somebody else again  
  
Oh so much for talking  
Its all been said before  
Im hearing something  
But I wish youd just say more  
  
But youre going off again  
When I try to just hold on  
But youre going off so  
  
Chorus
