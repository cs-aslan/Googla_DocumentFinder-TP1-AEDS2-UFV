I watch how the  
Moon sits in the sky in the dark night  
Shining with the light from the sun  
And the sun doesnt give light to the moon assuming  
The moons going to owe it one  
It makes me think of how you act to me  
You do  
Favors and then rapidly  
You just  
Turn around and start asking me about  
Things you want back from me  
Im sick of the tension sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest  
I want to be in another place  
I hate when you say you dont understand  
Youll see its not meant to be  
I want to be in the energy not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
Maybe someday Ill be just like you and  
Step on people like you do and  
Run away the people I thought I knew  
I remember back then who you were  
You used to be calm used to be strong  
Used to be generous but you shouldve known  
That youd  
Wear out your welcome now you see  
How quiet it is all alone  
Im so  
Sick of the tension sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest  
Im so  
Sick of the tension sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest  
  
I want to be in another place  
I hate when you say you dont understand  
Youll see its not meant to be  
I want to be in the energy not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
  
I want to be in another place  
I hate when you say you dont understand  
Youll see its not meant to be  
I want to be in the energy not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
  
Shut up  
  
Im so sick of the tension sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest  
  
Im so sick of the tension sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest
