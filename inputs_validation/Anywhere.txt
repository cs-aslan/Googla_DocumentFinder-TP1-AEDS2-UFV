Dear my love havent you wanted to be with me  
And dear my love havent you longed to be free  
I cant keep pretending that I dont even know you  
And at sweet night you are my own  
Take my hand  
  
Were leaving here tonight  
Theres no need to tell anyone  
Theyd only hold us down  
So by the morning light  
Well be half way to anywhere  
Where love is more than just your name  
  
I have dreamt of a place for you and I  
No one knows who we are there  
All I want is to give my life only to you  
Ive dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore  
Lets run away Ill take you there  
  
Were leaving here tonight  
Theres no need to tell anyone  
Theyd only hold us down  
So by the morning light  
Well be half way to anywhere  
Where no one needs a reason  
  
Forget this life  
Come with me  
Dont look back youre safe now  
Unlock your heart  
Drop your guard  
No ones left to stop you  
  
Forget this life  
Come with me  
Dont look back youre safe now  
Unlock your heart  
Drop your guard  
No ones left to stop you now  
  
Were leaving here tonight  
Theres no need to tell anyone  
Theyd only hold us down  
So by the morning light  
Well be half way to anywhere  
Where love is more than just your name
