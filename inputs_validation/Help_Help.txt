Tell me what I want to hear  
This shits too good to be true my dear  
Tell me lies tell me lies tell me  
Tell me lies tell me  
Help me help me help me  
Help me help me help me  
Storybook keeps from hurting me you see  
Shell of the man from the sea  
Tell me lies tell me lies tell me  
Tell me lies tell me  
Tell me why tell me why tell me  
Tell me why tell me  
Tell me lies tell me lies tell me  
Tell me lies tell me  
Help me help me help me  
Help me help me help me  
Reservoir of hate and fear  
Invisible in repair  
A hundred thieves cast a spell  
This is hell  
Help me help me help me  
Help me help me help me  
The man they call my enemy Ive seen his eyes  
He looks just like me a mirror  
The more you read weve been deceived  
Everyday it becomes clearer  
Clearer clearer clearer clearer  
Not my enemy  
No not my enemy  
Dont speak for me  
No not my enemy
