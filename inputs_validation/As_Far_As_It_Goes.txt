Lately Ive found myself fallin  
Deeper in love with you  
Im not the kind of guy  
Who gets swept away  
So heres what Im gonna do  
Im gonna give you this heart of mine  
But thats where I draw the line  
  
Chorus  
Im only gonna give you everything  
Take it a mile beyond the end of the road  
Im gonna love you one day past forever  
But thats as far as it goes  
  
I know it may not sound like much  
But baby make no mistake  
Im gonna treat you with more tenderness  
Than any one woman can take  
Im gonna make all your dreams come true  
But after that baby Im through  
  
Chorus  
  
Youve got your limits Ive got mine  
Im only gonna go the distance  
Time after time  
  
Chorus  
  
But thats as far as it goes
