Standing in the half light wondering if you can  
There stands the priest of sinners consolation in his hands  
Though he prays he wont need it he keeps it by his side  
Waiting for the face up and the answer in her eyes  
All while the musics playing a backdrop serenade  
Theres only one point of view  
To be doing the things things that lovers should do  
  
Discoqueens in dancestep moving face to face  
All tangled up in neon dont think its some disgrace  
The blue western denim the east coats razor edge  
The European fashion the leathers and rethreads  
All while the musics playing a backdrop serenade  
Theres only one point of view  
To be doing the things things that lovers should do
