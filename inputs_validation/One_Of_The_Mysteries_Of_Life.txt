If I were you I wouldnt waste my time  
You cant answer all the questions in your mind  
Love is love and you cant make it right  
Its one of the mysteries of life  
  
Chorus  
How can you know love when no one ever knew  
Its the mother of all happiness and father of the blues  
Love puts sunshine in your days then steals your sleep at night  
Its one of the mysteries of life  
  
Maybe you should take it day by day  
If you hold love too loosely it will fly away  
If you hold love too tightly it will die  
Its one of the mysteries of life  
  
Chorus
