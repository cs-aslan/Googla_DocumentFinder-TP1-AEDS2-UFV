So Im not good enough  
To hang with your friends  
You say its a bluff but  
Its no lie  
You want to be cool  
And hang with both side  
But what would they say  
Im the fool  
  
Its a superficial society  
And its a bunch of bullshit cant you see  
Why wont you wake up to reality  
I guess backstabbing aint the way of life for me  
  
Open your mind and close your eyes  
To the things that really persist  
Its not your hair or the things you wear that  
Make someone socially exist  
Its hard to find yourself sometimes  
Around people with a cool policy  
Why dont you let yourself unwind and  
Leave that lame society  
  
Superficial society  
Superficial society  
Superficial society  
Well its all superficial to me  
Superficial society  
Superficial society
