Take me to the place where the white boys dance  
Take me to the place where they run and play  
My baby is gone you might have a chance  
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance  
  
They hug in silence  
As the sun sets  
On their empty street  
Their suspicions where they rise and hide  
And then who sweeps them off she doesnt leave  
She walks inside and  
Pours a strong one  
Put her mind at ease  
Its the calm before another storm  
And the friendships from the whiskey to the keys  
  
Take me to the place where the white boys dance  
Take me to the place where they run and play  
My baby is gone you might have a chance  
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance  
  
Her heart is racing  
She phones a friend to say  
  
Im in an awful place  
That fools been messin around on me  
Ive seen it in his eyes and on his face  
Hold on a minute  
Youre talking crazy  
Dont be that jealous girl  
Just tell him you need an hour or two  
Cause were going go and change somebodies world  
  
Take me to the place where the white boys dance  
Take me to the place where they run and play  
My baby is gone you might have a chance  
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance  
  
Its the calm before another storm  
Its the calm before another storm  
And the friendships from the whiskey to the keys  
  
Take me to the place where the white boys dance  
Take me to the place where they run and play  
My baby is gone you might have a chance  
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance
