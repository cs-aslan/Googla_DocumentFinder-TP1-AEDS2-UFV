Flesh wound flesh wound  
With medication it will fade  
Should I assume that someone hears me when I pray  
Full of hate  
Dont you love how I pray  
  
Chorus  
Dont let them throw me away  
Ah  
Keep me and Ill be okay  
Ah  
  
Ah  
Dont let them throw me away  
Ah  
Dont let them throw me away  
  
Screwed up used up  
Crumble lying on the floor  
Fucked up shut up  
All you did back then was thought  
Im really weak  
Missing parts  
Incomplete  
  
Chorus  
  
Hold me up into the light  
Fix the cracks and fix them right  
Keep the pieces in the drawer  
Keep them there for ever more  
Wake a million thoughts someday  
Recycle this shit in someway  
And all that I have to say  
Dont let them throw me away  
  
Chorus
