Been so long since I left you  
Do all the things you used to do  
In all this time I cant forget you  
Everywhere I turn I think of you  
And I I want to trust you baby  
You youre all I need  
Soul to soul Fire to fire  
Nothing like this mans desire  
Love is a beautiful thing  
One and one you and me  
Baby its our destiny  
Love is a beautiful thing  
Love is such a sweet emotion  
I want to share it all with you  
With your trust and endless devotion  
There aint nothing in this world we cant do  
Tonight I want to thank you baby  
You you make my life complete  
Soul to soul fire to fire  
Nothing like this mans desire  
Love is a beautiful thing  
One and one you and me  
Maybe its our destiny  
Love is a beautiful thing  
Tonight I want to thank you baby  
You you make my soul complete  
Soul to soul fire to fire  
Nothing like this mans desire  
Love is a beautiful thing  
One and one you and me  
Maybe its our destiny  
Love is a beautiful thing
