I never said I was more than I am  
Do what I want and I dont give a damn  
Youre all so weak you know it makes me ill  
Dont like you now and probably never will  
You cheat and lie and wonder why  
You cant sleep at night  
  
Youre not well Mr Blackwell  
And we can tell  
Youre not well Mr Blackwell  
Why dont you go to hell  
  
I am a sinner who just loves to sin  
I am a fighter who just loves to win  
I am the truth about this crummy hole  
Theres nothing here that cant be bought or sold  
Youre cold and mean and in between  
Youre rotten to the core  
  
Youre not well Mr Blackwell  
And we can tell  
Youre not well Mr Blackwell  
Why dont you go to hell  
  
Youre a victim a real disgrace  
You should be banished from the human race  
  
Well drink to sorrow then well drink to waste  
Well drink a toast to the inhuman race  
Heres to the world and the times were in  
Heres to the kid a real man among men  
Youre cold and mean and in between  
Youre rotten to the core  
  
Youre not well Mr Blackwell  
And we can tell  
Youre not well Mr Blackwell  
Why dont you go to hell
