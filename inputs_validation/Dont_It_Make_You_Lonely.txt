Couples walking in the park  
Seeing them just breaks my heart in two right in two  
Wonder how you spend your time  
Do you know that Im still missing you missing you  
Am I the only one who cant stand a midnight train  
Or do you hear that whistle moan and want my love again  
Ah dont it make you lonely  
Dont it make you wanna cry out loud  
Dont it make you want me  
Dont it make you wanna work it out  
Dont it make your heart ache  
Even though youre finally free  
Dont it make you lonely lonely like me  
When you hear a sad song play  
Does a teardrop lay there in your eye do you cry  
When youre alone and the day is done  
Dont you wish wed give it one more try  
Ah just one more try  
And do you reach out in the middle of the night to find me gone  
Cause if you feel the way I do then baby why dont you come home  
Ah dont it make you lonely  
Dont it make you wanna cry out loud  
Dont it make you want me  
Dont it make you wanna work it out  
Dont it make your heart ache  
Even though youre finally free  
Dont it make you lonely lonely like me  
Ah dont it make you lonely lonely like me
