By Tom Paxton  
Oh the price of gold is rising out of sight  
And the dollar is in sorry shape tonight  
What the dollar used to get us now wont buy a head of lettuce  
No the economic forecast isnt right  
But amidst the clouds I spot a shining ray  
I can even glimpse a new and better way  
And Ive devised a plan of action worked it down to the last fraction  
And Im going into action here today  
CHORUS  
I am changing my name to Chrysler  
I am going down to Washington DC  
I will tell some power broker  
What they did for Iacocca  
Will be perfectly acceptable to me  
I am changing my name to Chrysler  
I am headed for that great receiving line  
So when they hand a million grand out  
Ill be standing with my hand out  
Yes sire Ill get mine  
When my creditors are screaming for their dough  
Ill be proud to tell them all where they can all go  
They wont have to scream and holler  
Theyll be paid to the last dollar  
Where the endless streams of money seem to flow  
Ill be glad to tell them what they can do  
Its a matter of a simple form or two  
Its not just renumeration its a liberal education  
Aint you kind of glad that Im in debt to you  
CHORUS  
Since the first amphibians crawled out of the slime  
Weve been struggling in an unrelenting climb  
We were hardly up and walking before money started talking  
And its sad that failure is an awful crime  
Well its been that way for a millennium or two  
But now it seems that theres a different point of view  
If youre a corporate titanic and your failure is gigantic  
Down to congress theres a safety net for you  
CHORUS
