No place to hide  
And no where to run  
Nothing you can do because a change must come  
You cant stop it  
You got your tail in the air  
Your head in the ground  
Money money money makes your world go round  
You see  
You cant stop you cant stop you cant stop you cant stop  
You cant stop love in action  
You just joined the clan  
Your heads full of sand  
You need a bunch of friends to make you feel like a man  
But you cant stop it  
Yeah you could be the last trace of the master race  
The Nazis really send you to another place  
Still you cant stop it  
You cant stop love in action
