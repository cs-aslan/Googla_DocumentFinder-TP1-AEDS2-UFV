Stop and listen I hear my baby call my name  
Stop and listen I hear my baby call my name  
She dont call too loud but she calls ooh nice and plain  
  
Stop and listen before you make a start  
Stop and listen before you make a start  
Because if you fall in love it may break your heart  
  
I love my baby Ill tell the world I do  
I love you baby Ill tell the world I do  
And theyll just have to stop and listen to everything for you
