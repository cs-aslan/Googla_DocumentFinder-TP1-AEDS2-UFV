Ive taken time  
To think about the words Ive said and what they mean  
And Ive realized that having you is just like having everything  
  
But when I see you dancing there  
I get up and throw my hands in the air  
When Ive nowhere else to roam  
I slowly start to think about coming home  
  
Its been so long  
It seems the only things I know are far from home  
Where did I go  
It seems sometimes Im only good at being gone  
  
But when I see you dancing there  
I get up and throw my hands in the air  
When Ive nowhere else to roam  
I slowly start to think about coming home  
  
But when I see you standing there  
I get up and throw my hands in the air  
When Ive nowhere else to roam  
I slowly start to think about coming home  
  
When Ive nowhere else to roam  
I slowly start to think about coming home  
Home home  
When Ive nowhere else to roam  
I slowly start to think about coming home
