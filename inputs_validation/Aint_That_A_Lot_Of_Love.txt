I know the desert cant hold all the love  
that I feel in my heart for you  
If I could spread it out across the sea  
I know my love would cork it up  
Aint that a lot of love for one heart to hold  
  
If the bees only knew how sweet you are baby  
They would seal up their honeycomb  
If the birds could hear how sweet your voice is  
They would tighten up the song  
Aint that a lot of love for one heart to hold  
Your lips are so sweet honey youre my every need  
You got a smile so rare  
A love like yours I just cant compare  
Aint that a lot of love for one heart to hold  
Aint that a lot of love for one heart to hold  
  
If the cook in the kitchen had a touch as hot as yours  
They wouldnt need a fire  
I cant think of a word that describes you better  
Than the sight of her
