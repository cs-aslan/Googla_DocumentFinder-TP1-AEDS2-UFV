Im so angry  
Im so angry  
Something that you said burnin in my head  
Im so angry  
Im so angry  
Everything you do makes me furious with you  
  
Its like a poison to me  
Its like you put me in shock  
You stick a needle in me  
Every time that you talk  
  
Im so angry  
Im so stupid  
Everything you say I believe it anyway  
Im so stupid  
Im so angry  
Running after you thats what I gotta do  
  
Its like a poison to me  
Its like you put me in shock  
You stick a needle in me  
Every time that you talk  
  
Is there any one at all  
Any one you didnt call  
Is there any one you didnt deny  
Is there any one you missed  
Any one you didnt kiss  
Is there any law you didnt defy  
  
Im so crazy  
Im so crazy  
I used to be so cool now Im just your little fool  
Im so crazy  
Im so crazy  
Talking in my sleep like a scary little creep  
  
Its like a poison to me  
Its like you put me in shock  
You stick a needle in me  
Every time that you talk  
  
Is there any one at all  
Anyone you didnt call  
Is there any one you didnt deny  
Is there any one you missed  
Anyone you didnt kiss  
Is there any law you didnt defy  
  
Im so angry  
Im so angry  
Always chewing nails it never ever fails  
Im so angry  
Im so angry  
Better hide my knife better run for your life
