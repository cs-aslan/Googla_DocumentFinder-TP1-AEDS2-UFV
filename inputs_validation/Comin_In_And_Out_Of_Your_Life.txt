I still can remember  
The last time I cried  
I was holding you and loving you  
Knowing it would end  
  
I never felt so good  
Yet felt so bad  
Youre the one I love  
And what makes it sad  
Is you dont belong to me  
  
And I can remember  
The last time I lied  
I was holding you and telling you  
We could still be friends  
  
Tried to let you go  
But I cant you know  
And even though Im not with you  
I need you so  
But you dont belong to me  
  
Chorus  
Comin in and out of your life  
Isnt easy  
When there are so many nights  
I cant hold you and Ive told you  
These feelings are so hard to find  
Comin in and out of your life  
Will never free me  
cause I dont need to touch you  
To feel you its so real with you  
  
I just cant get you out of my mind  
But I can remember the last time we tried  
Each needing more than we could give  
And knowing all the time  
A stronger love  
Just cant be found  
Even though at times this crazy world  
Is turning upsidedown  
Youll always belong to me  
  
Chorus
