When you say goodbye I really want to know  
Everything you do and everyplace you go  
And did you take a regular supply  
Of those crazy little tampax with you  
It hurts me deep inside it hurts me outside too  
I feel a little pardon and I feel a little used  
If you ever needed someone to polish up your shoes  
Ill be waiting with my brush  
  
Id move to Italy with you if I had the money  
But til then Ill sit at home and read maps and go to pub  
Where the weather isnt sunny and the weather isnt bad  
Where the bellies look so happy but the faces look so sad  
But it doesnt really matter whats outside  
Cause Im in here and hes in here  
And shes in here and theyre in here  
Were all in here were all so glad  
  
And in our own funny way were all in Italy anyway  
Eating fancy pasta climbing mountain ranges  
Drinking icecold lagers living in Spanish castles  
Were all with you in our thoughts  
In white ankle socks and pink Bermuda shorts  
Ill be with you with you one day well all be with you with you one day  
One sunny beach one sunny life were all glad for you  
But til then were all glad for you Im so glad  
  
I am a man and I have a tent I have a ball and a bat  
I have a lilo I have a bucket  
I have a good good good pair of trunks  
Ive got a good good pair of trunks  
  
Well here I am at the airport with my passport  
I have a brain but only just and were all glad  
Were all so glad Im so glad shes so glad hes so glad  
You know how glad I am
