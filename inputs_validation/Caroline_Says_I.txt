Caroline says that Im just a toy  
She wants a man not just a boy  
Oh Caroline says ooh Caroline says  
  
Caroline says she cant help but be mean  
Or cruel or oh so it seems  
Oh Caroline says Caroline says  
  
She say she doesnt want a man who leans  
Still she is my Germanic Queen  
Yeah shes my Queen  
  
The things she does the things she says  
People shouldnt treat others that way  
But at first I thought I could take it all  
  
Just like poison in a vial hey she was often very vile  
But of course I thought I could take it all  
  
Caroline says that Im not a man  
So shell go get it catch as catch can  
Oh Caroline says yeah Caroline says  
  
Caroline says moments in time  
Cant continue to be only mine  
Oh Caroline says yeah Caroline says  
  
She treats me like I am a fool  
But to me shes still a German Queen  
Ooh shes my Queen  
Queen
