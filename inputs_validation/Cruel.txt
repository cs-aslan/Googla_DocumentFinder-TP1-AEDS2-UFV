So dont give me respect  
Dont give me a piece of your preciousness  
Flaunt all shes got in our old neighbourhood  
Im sure shell make a few friends  
Even the rain bows down  
Let us pray as you cock cock cock your mane  
No cigarettes only peeled Havanas for you  
I can be cruel  
I dont know why  
Why cant my balloon stay up  
In a perfectly windy sky  
I can be cruel I dont know why  
  
Dance with the Sufis  
Celebrate your top ten in the charts of pain  
Lover brother bogenvilla my vine twists around your need  
Even the rain is sharp  
Like today as you shshshock me sane  
No cigarettes only peeled Havanas for you
