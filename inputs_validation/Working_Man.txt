I get up at seven yeah  
And I go to work at nine  
I got no time for livin  
Yes Im workin all the time  
  
It seems to me  
I could live my life  
A lot better than I think I am  
I guess thats why they call me  
They call me the workin man  
  
They call me the workin man  
I guess thats what I am  
  
I get home at five oclock  
And I take myself out a nice cold beer  
Always seem to be wondrin  
Why theres nothin goin down here  
  
It seems to me  
I could live my life  
A lot better than I think I am  
I guess thats why they call me  
They call me the workin man  
  
They call me the workin man  
I guess thats what I am  
  
Well they call me the workin man  
I guess thats what I am
