Your life is aimless and insane theres something wrong inside your brain  
And day by day its still the same there aint no drug to kill your pain  
Every hour you sink more in the mire you deplore  
Theres no excuse to justify the wasting pain that blinds you eyes  
  
Youre the sick among the pure and youre looking for the cure  
Youre too stupid to realize your life is just a compromise  
Youre so filled with the disease and youre bowed on your knees  
No one care of what you say thats the price you gotta pay  
  
So find a way out Tell me a lie  
Do anything that could loosen your strain  
Another chance Another drug Another pill to relieve this damn pain  
  
Your pain  
No one will assuage your pain  
And all your efforts are vain  
  
An endless day of lite routine tied to the wheel of its machine  
With a barcode on your skin you cant forget all that youve been  
Selfdeception is your dope cause you know there is no hope  
Fight against conformity lose your own identity  
  
You go back to the cage draw a new line  
Live your mistakes over and over again  
Anothe chance Anoter drug Another pill to relieve this damn pain  
  
Your pain  
No one will assuage your pain  
And all your efforts are vain  
  
How deep is your sorrow How deep is your pain  
  
Your pain  
No one will assuage your pain  
And all your efforts are vain
