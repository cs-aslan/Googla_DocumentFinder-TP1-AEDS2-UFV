Just a smile and the rain is gone  
Can hardly believe it yeah  
Theres an angel standing next to me  
Reaching for my heart  
  
Just a smile and theres no way back  
Can hardly believe it yeah  
But theres an angel and shes calling me  
Reaching for my heart  
  
I know that Ill be ok now  
This time its real  
  
I lay my love on you  
Its all I want to do  
Every time I breathe I feel brand new  
You open up my heart  
Show me all your love and walk right through  
As I lay my love on you  
  
I was lost in a lonely place  
Could hardly believe it yeah  
Holding on to yesterdays  
Far far too long  
  
Now I believe its okay cause  
This time its real  
  
I lay my love on you  
Its all I want to do  
Every time I breathe I feel brand new  
You open up my heart  
Show me all your love and walk right through  
As I lay my love on you  
  
I never knew that love could feel so good  
  
Like a once in a lifetime  
You change my world  
  
I lay my love on you
