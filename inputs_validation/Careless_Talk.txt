Careless talk  
Thats what you heard about me  
Jealous talk  
Thats what I heard about you  
Everybodys telling lies  
I dont even know why  
Why cant people  
Find something better to do  
Careless talk  
I dont believe what they say  
I heard them talk  
They say youve been putting me down  
In the shadows on the phone  
They wont leave us alone  
Theyve been talking  
Ever since you came around  
Careless talk  
Telling you Im doing wrong  
Jealous talk  
Follows wherever you go  
Im aware of what you heard  
Every terrible word  
Everybodys making believe that they know  
All of the intimate things  
That we ever might have said  
In the heat of a passionate moment  
In a conversation shared  
For the ears of nobody else  
There are some things they will never hear  
There are secrets Ill never tell  
Careless talk  
Going around on the streets  
Jealous talk  
I know how bad it can be  
Let them stand where they fall  
They dont know us at all  
All that talking wont make a difference to me
