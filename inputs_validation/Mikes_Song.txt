Trapped in time and I dont know what to do  
These friends of mine I can see right through  
You dont gotta tell me I dont gotta move  
Cause Im sittin back here sharin in the groove  
  
No Im no nice guy Me no are no nice guy  
No Im no nice guy Me no are no nice guy  
No Im no nice guy Me no are no nice guy  
  
I walk through the hallways inside my mind  
I chase the backbeat from behind  
Big dude in the doorway was blockin my way  
He reached to grab me and this is what he said  
  
No Im no nice guy Me no are no nice guy  
No Im no nice guy Me no are no nice guy  
No Im no nice guy Me no are no nice guy  
  
This is the end  
My only friend the end  
Indians lying on dawns highway bleeding  
Ghosts in the young childs fragile  mind  
Ah  
Careful with that axe Eugene  
Mother  
Careful with that axe Eugene  
Ah
