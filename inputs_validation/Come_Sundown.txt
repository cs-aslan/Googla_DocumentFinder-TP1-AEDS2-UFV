I heard the front door closin softly  
As I waken from my sleep  
With the last touch of her lips Lord  
Like a whisper on my cheek  
  
And I curse the sun for risin  
For the worse Lord is yet to come  
Cause this mornin shes just leavin  
But come sundown shell be gone  
  
See the lipstick on the pillow  
That I placed beneath her head  
And the soft sheets still feel warm Lord  
Where she lay upon my bed  
  
And it hurt to know its over  
For the hurt Lord has just begun  
Cause this mornin shes just leavin  
But come sundown shell be gone
