Sometimes I cant put up with bein so put down  
And all my faith can manage is the shadow of a frown  
My souls about to break theres only one escape  
  
I look at you when the world is full of lies  
I look at you and the truth is in your eyes  
I look at you when I lay me down at night  
And I want to see a dream come true  
I look at you and I know Ive got it all  
You touch my hand and the burdens start to fall  
You ease my troubled mind I love you more each time I look at you  
  
You know somedays Im tempted to run away and hide  
Cause I cant miss the bad luck thats fallen from the sky  
Im under some dark cloud and theres only one way out  
  
I look at you when the world is full of lies  
I look at you and the truth is in your eyes  
I look at you when I lay me down at night  
And I want to see a dream come true  
I look at you and I know Ive got it all  
You touch my hand and the burdens start to fall  
You ease my troubled mind I love you more each time I look at you  
  
I look at you and I know Ive got it all  
You touch my hand and the burdens start to fall  
You ease my troubled mind I love you more each time I look at you
