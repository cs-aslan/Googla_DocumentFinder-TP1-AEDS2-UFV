I know a man whose plow handle hand is quicker than a light  
Wes Hardin is his name they say he travels in the night  
For he might have to kill or walk around a fight  
  
And if you ever saw Wes Hardin draw you know he can skin his gun  
He wont say how many tried and died  
Up against the top hand up against the wrong man cause Hardin wouldnt run  
  
He rode in like a Texas wind took the eastbound train  
Goin goin with Jane Bowen till the law men caught up  
So long Janie chin up Ill be back again  
  
Off he went to Huntsville Prison so long Janie he cried  
Fifteen years she waited till her heart broke and she died  
And she left that bad land to wait up in the sky  
  
Free at last the payin past for all the wrong he did  
First free air they let him breathe since he was a kid  
So let him come and let him go and let him deal and bid  
  
Near the border in El Paso Lawyer reads the sign  
You wont find him there for business every day at nine  
For business is real bad one clients all hes had in quite a long long time  
  
Then sheriff Selmans boy broke in to Wess womans place  
Up she jumped and pistol whipped him kicked him in the face  
And John Selman demands revenge for this disgrace  
  
You could see every night by candlelight in Hardins favorite bar  
Shed be hanging on his arm and very late theyd leave there  
Headed for the Goose Hair glad it wasnt far  
  
Right through the swinging doors John Selman came with a blazin gun  
Wes Hardin chugaluggin red eye got him in the back of the head  
John Wesley Hardin fell dead cos Hardin wouldnt run
