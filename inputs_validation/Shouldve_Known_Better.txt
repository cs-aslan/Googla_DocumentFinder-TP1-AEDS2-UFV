Another sleepless night I cant explain  
Somebody said they heard me call your name  
The radio wont let you leave my mind  
I know its over but I dont know why  
  
Chorus  
Shouldve known better  
Than to fall in love with you  
Now love is just a faded memory  
Shouldve known better  
Now Im a prisoner to this pain  
And my heart still aches for you  
  
There was no risk that I wouldnt take  
And not a promise that I didnt make  
All I asked was that you just hold on  
And now Im wondering what I did wrong  
  
Chorus  
  
I gave you all of my body and soul  
Never believing we might lose control  
I took my hands off the wheel  
  
I cant remember if the lies were true  
Its been a million years since I touched you  
I thought time might help me win this game  
But being away from you is slowly driving me insane  
  
Chorus
