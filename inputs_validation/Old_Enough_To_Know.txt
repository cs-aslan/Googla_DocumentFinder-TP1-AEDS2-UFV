In the passion your heart is abused  
He is pushing you you have to choose  
Oh Rebecca love is never  
Easy anymore  
Oh Rebecca so afraid of  
Losing what is yours  
Chorus  
Are you giving in to the pressure  
Holding you again now he tells you  
What it takes to be in love  
He believes youre old enough  
But how you gonna feel tomorrow  
When the day reveals  
What you believed was for the sake of love  
Dont you think youre old enough to know  
  
Youre a breed of few and far between  
Holding on to your romantic dream  
Oh Rebecca love is patient  
Love would understand  
Oh Rebecca your decision  
Is your only chance  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
  
Oh Rebecca dont confuse what love is  
With what some say love should be  
Should be  
  
Chorus
