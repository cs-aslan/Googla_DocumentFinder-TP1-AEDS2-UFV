Julie catch a rabbit by his hair  
Come back steppin like to walk on air  
Get back home where you belong  
And dont you run off no more  
  
Dont hang your head let the two time roll  
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor  
Ask the time baby I dont know  
Come back later gonna let it show  
  
I say row Jimmy row gonna get there I dont know  
Seems a common way to go get out and row row row row row  
Heres a half dollar if you dare  
Double twist when you hit the air  
Look at Julie down below  
The levee doin the dopaso  
  
I say row Jimmy row gonna get there I dont know  
Seems a common way to go get out and row row row row row  
Broken heart dont feel so bad  
You aint got half of what you thought you had  
Rock you baby to and fro  
Not too fast and not too slow  
  
I say row Jimmy row gonna get there I dont know  
Seems a common way to go get out and row row row row row  
Thats the way its been in town  
Ever since they tore the jukebox down  
Two bit piece dont buy no more  
Not so much as it done before  
I say row Jimmy row gonna get there I dont know  
Seems a common way to go get out and row row row row row
