I have a love and its all that I have  
Right or wrong what else can I do   
I love him Im his  
And every thing he is  
I am too  
  
I have a love and hes all that I need  
Right or wrong and he needs me too  
I love him were one  
Theres nothing to be done  
Not a thing I can do  
  
But hold him  
Hold him forever  
Be with him now  
Tomorrow and all of my life  
  
When love comes so strong  
There is no right or wrong  
Your love is your own
