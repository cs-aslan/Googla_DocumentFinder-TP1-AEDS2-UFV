I see you walk with him  
I see you talk to him  
It tears me up oh it tears me up  
And I cant stop crying  
Oh baby I cant stop crying  
  
I see you kiss his lips  
And squeeze his fingertips  
It tears me up oh baby it tears me up  
And theres nothing I can do about it  
  
Oh baby baby cant you see Im still in love with you  
Its a faithless world were livin in  
When I turn around and there you are with my best friend  
Sometimes when you pass me on the street  
  
You look at me as if to say Im sorry my sweet  
And being sorry might be enough  
Then you look back at him and unverified a smile  
And that makes me feel kinda rough  
  
Oh darlin it tears me up  
I see you smile at him  
You never tire of him  
It tears me up  
  
Oh baby it tears me up  
Theres nothing I can do about it  
Baby cant you see Im still in love with you  
Still hungry for something I cant have  
  
Oh it tears me up so bad  
Still hungry for something I cant have  
Tears me up so bad  
Cant you see Im still in love with you  
Still hungry for something I cant have  
  
Baby please please please  
Im still hungry for something I cant have  
It tears me up so bad  
Oh oh it tears me up so bad  
Tears me up so bad
