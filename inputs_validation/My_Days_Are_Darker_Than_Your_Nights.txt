You never knew how much I loved you I tried but you just couldnt see the
light  
Youre out there somewhere with her now I guess its best for you  
But my days are darker than your nights  
My days are darker than your nights I wait for mornings that never arise  
Theres just no end as long as Im alive my days are darker than your nights  
  
Youll never know just what Im going through  
I hope youll never need someone like I need you  
Youre happy now youve got just what you want  
But dont think that Ill forget you cause I wont  
My days are darker than your nights
