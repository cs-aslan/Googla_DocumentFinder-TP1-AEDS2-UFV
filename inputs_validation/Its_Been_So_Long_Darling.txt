Its been so long darlin  
Since I had to go away  
Its been so long darlin  
And Ill neer forget that day  
  
Although you never mentioned it  
You cried that whole day long  
Its been so long darlin  
But now Im comin home  
  
Chorus  
Its been so long darlin  
Since I gazed into your eyes  
Its been so long darlin  
Do you really realize  
That the thought of seein you  
It scares me through and through  
Its been so long darlin  
Since I had a kiss from you  
  
Its been so long darlin  
But it wont be long now  
Its been so long darlin  
But Ive kept evry vow  
  
I pray that youll be waiting  
As you did in days gone by  
Its been so long darlin  
Please dont blame me if I cry  
  
Chorus
