And her eyes are like skies about to rain  
But theres work to be done and she does not complain  
Her children are so far away  
I heard you crying I heard you praying  
Now you must go and its so hard to say  
  
Goodbye Carmen  
Thank you for staying with us for a while With your pretty smile  
And someday youll get home again  
Goodbye Carmen  
Hasta manana or who knows when It all depends  
Goodbye  
  
Were convinced our intentions are good  
But we live in this world often misunderstood  
Can you feel it Uhhuh  
I can feel it  
And no one seems to care much and its so hard to say  
  
Goodbye Carmen  
Thank you for staying with us for a while With your pretty smile  
And someday youll get home again  
Goodbye Carmen  
Hasta manana or who knows when It all depends  
Goodbye  
  
Carmen careful what you do be careful what you see Carmen  
We will always be with you  
  
Turn around but shes lost in the sun  
There was so much to say but shes already gone so  
Thank you Carmen dont be afraid this is not the end  
So rest your head I hope someday we will meet again  
Goodbye Carmen  
Hasta manana or never again  
But youre my friend Carmen  
Goodbye
