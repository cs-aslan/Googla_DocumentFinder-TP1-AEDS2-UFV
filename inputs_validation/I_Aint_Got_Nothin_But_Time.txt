Little girl if youre feeling low  
And you got no place to go  
Just give me a ring some joy I will bring  
Cause I aint got nothin but time  
Well I aint got nothin but time  
So baby if you wanna shine  
If you take time to look my numbers in the book  
And you can call me any time  
Im footloose and Im fancy free  
So baby just come along with me  
Grab your dancin shoes well go and lose them blues  
Cause I aint got nothin but time  
If you say so babe well stay all night  
Dont worry cause I aint got no wife  
Any time you wanna go good gal just let me know  
Cause I aint got nothin but time  
No use to sit at home and fine  
And let someone trouble your mind  
Just come along with me theres more fish in the sea  
And I aint got nothin but time  
Now baby just come on and smile  
Youll find that life is still worth while  
If you just look around and watch the fellars in this town  
That for you aint got nothin but time  
Lord I aint got nothin but time  
So baby if you wants to shine  
If you take time to look my numbers in the book  
And you can call me any time
