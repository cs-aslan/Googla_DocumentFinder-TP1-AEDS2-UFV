It all went wrong when I grew jealous  
I didnt realize my strength  
Could take the life of one so precious  
Together we were known as good friends  
  
Did you ever read the words  
That said love would end I read them tonight  
Mistakes I cant defend  
I didnt stop to think  
And I upset her  
I said good night tonight the last time forever  
I think of her tonight  
She keeps me from my sleep but what can I do  
With all of these memories  
I used to be so shy  
And hide my temper  
Ive said good night tonight the last time forever  
  
It all went wrong when I grew jealous  
I didnt realize my strength  
Could take the life of one so precious  
Together we were known as good friends  
  
Did you ever read the words  
That say I love you I read them tonight  
But what good can they do  
I regret what I have done  
It wasnt clever  
Ive said good night tonight the last time forever  
Ive said good night tonight the last time forever  
Ive said good night tonight the last time forever
