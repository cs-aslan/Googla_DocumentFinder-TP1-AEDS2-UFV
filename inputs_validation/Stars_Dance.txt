Wake up to your dreams  
And watch them come true  
Ill make you whisper my name Ill never leave the room  
Night and day Ill be your muse  
No other girl can make you feel the way I do  
  
I can make the stars dance  
Light up the moon I can make the stars dance  
If you want me to  
The sky is everywhere so meet me under there  
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you  
  
Dont be afraid close your eyes  
Let me take you to places youve never been tonight  
I thought by know youd realize I can do anything I put my mind to  
  
I can make the stars dance  
Light up the moon I can make the stars dance  
If you want me to  
The sky is everywhere so meet me under there  
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you  
  
Everything I touch turns to love  
Everything I do will open up heaven  
Its dead steady theres falling and flying in love  
Nothings forever because we are just stars dance  
  
I can make the stars dance  
Light up the moon I can make the stars dance  
If you want me to  
The sky is everywhere so meet me under there  
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you  
  
I can make the stars dance  
I can make the stars dance  
I can make I can make I can make the stars dance  
  
The sky is everywhere so meet me under there  
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you
