Do you think you have to act  
Like youre someone else with me  
Like a cover girl  
Or a barbie doll  
  
Or a beauty queen  
Youll be gone when I wake up  
To the Rolling Stones  
And the jukes and earls  
  
But I aint looking for  
An imaginary girl  
Who are you really  
Come on tell me  
  
Deep behind blue eyes  
And whats on todays agenda  
In your enterprise  
Do you weigh the odds before you speak  
  
Straighten out your curls  
But Im not taken in  
By an imaginary girl  
Yeah  
  
Who are you trying to be  
Why are you so counterfeit  
Whats your problem  
Who do you want to be anyway  
  
Cause I need reality  
Thats right  
Come on be straight with me  
Youre like a damaged nerve  
  
Youre like a dirt road curve  
Do you think you have to act  
Like your someone else with me  
Cause I dont believe you  
  
Youre an imaginary girl  
Dont believe you babe  
Thought I saw you once  
When you just let go  
  
And took your heart down off the shelf  
When you turned around and looked at me baby  
You were nobody else  
Thats what Im looking for deep inside of you  
  
That hidden precious pearl  
Not the act of love  
From an imaginary girl  
I cant buy into your imaginary world  
  
Yeah  
Wont be taken in  
By an imaginary girl  
So who are you saving it for  
  
In your imaginary world  
Yeah  
I guess Im resigned to an imaginary girl  
Im in love with an imaginary girl
