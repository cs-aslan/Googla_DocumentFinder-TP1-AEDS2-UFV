I tell you what  
  
They dont mess with me Im a wild man son  
I got me my very own anti tank gun  
I got a jack rabbit with it guess he was a mean one  
Yeah Ive always been a sportsman  
  
Now there wasnt much left when I got to him  
Them big old shells didnt just go through him  
Just lumps of fur and that was it  
Guess you could say he sure took a hit alright  
  
Yeah you want to see my fire power see my collection  
Cause thats my thing man perfection  
Now Im talking power in the barrel of a gun  
Ill blow anything I want to kingdom come  
  
Ba ba boom  
Ba ba ba ba bomb  
And Ill blow anything I want  
To kingdom come  
  
Yeah all you got to do is squeeze on the trigger  
And a little bitty human get a whole lot bigger  
Cause theres a time for talking and a time to shoot them down  
  
And this mamajama dont pussy foot around alright  
  
Yeah let them laugh let them say were strange  
Me and my buddies on the rifle range  
But you wont be laughing when it hits the fan  
Youre going to want to be a survivor man  
  
Yeah you got to see my fire power see my collection  
Cause thats my thing man perfection  
Now Im talking power in the barrel of a gun  
Ill blow anything I want to kingdom come  
  
Ba ba boom  
Ba ba ba ba bomb  
And Ill blow anything I want  
To kingdom come  
  
Ba ba ba ba boom

Yes and Ill blow anything I want  
To kingdom come
