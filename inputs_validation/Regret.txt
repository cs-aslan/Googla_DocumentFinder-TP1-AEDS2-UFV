Maybe Ive forgotten  
The name and the address  
Of everyone Ive ever known  
Its nothing I regret  
Save it for another day  
Its the school exam  
The kids have run away  
  
I would like a place I can call my own  
Have a conversation on the telephone  
Wake up everyday that would be a start  
I would not complain bout my wounded heart  
  
I was upset you see  
Almost all the time  
You used to be a stranger  
Now you are mine  
  
I wouldnt even trust you  
Ive not that much to give  
Were dealing in the limits and  
We dont know who with  
You may think that Im out of hand  
That Im naive Ill understand  
On this occasion its not true  
Look at me Im not you  
  
I would like a place I can call my own  
Have a conversation on the telephone  
Wake up everyday that would be a start  
I would not complain bout my wounded heart  
  
I was a short fuse  
Burning all the time  
You were a complete stranger  
Now you are mine  
  
I would like a place I can call my own  
Have a conversation on the telephone  
Wake up everyday that would be a start  
I would not complain bout my wounded heart  
  
Just wait till tomorrow  
I guess thats what they all say  
Just before they fall apart
