If you want to go out  
Youve got to take her out cocaine  
And if you want to get down  
Down on the ground cocaine  
She dont lie  
She dont lie  
She dont lie cocaine  
  
Well if youve had bad news  
You want to kick your blues cocaine  
And if your day is done  
But you just got to run on cocaine  
She dont lie  
She dont lie  
She dont lie cocaine  
  
Feeling is gone but you just  
Got to ride on cocaine  
But dont forget this fact  
You just cant get it back cocaine  
  
She dont lie  
She dont lie  
She dont lie cocaine  
  
She dont lie  
She dont lie  
She dont lie cocaine
