If you see her say hello she might be in Tangier  
She left here last early spring is livin there I hear  
Say for me that Im all right though things get kind of slow  
She might think that Ive forgotten her dont tell her it isnt so  
  
We had a fallingout like lovers often will  
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill  
And though our separation it pierced me to the heart  
She still lives inside of me weve never been apart  
  
If you get close to her kiss her once for me  
I always have respected her for busting out and gettin free  
Oh whatever makes her happy I wont stand in the way  
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her
stay  
  
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds  
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town  
And Ive never gotten used to it Ive just learned to turn it off  
Either Im too sensitive or else Im gettin soft  
  
Sundown yellow moon I replay the past  
I know every scene by heart they all went by so fast  
If shes passin back this way Im not that hard to find  
Tell her she can look me up if shes got the time
