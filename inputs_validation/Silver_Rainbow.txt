Rivers flow uphill  
Blue turns into grey  
Winter follows springtime  
Morning ends the day  
Beyond the silver rainbow  
  
If youre walking home beside her  
And you know what time it is  
And if you avoid the puddles in your way  
You havent been there either  
To the land that lies  
Beyond the silver rainbow  
  
But if youre walking home beside her  
And the sun should turn to blue  
And you keep on going cause youre unaware  
Then you know that you are there  
  
Beyond the silver rainbow  
You wont know if youre coming or going  
  
If youre sitting there beside her  
With your arms you hold her close  
And youre wondering just how far shell let you go  
You havent been there either  
To the land that lies  
Beyond the silver rainbow  
  
But if youre sitting there beside her  
And a bear comes in the room  
And you keep on going cause youre unaware  
Then you know that you are there  
  
Beyond the silver rainbow  
You wont know if youre coming or going
