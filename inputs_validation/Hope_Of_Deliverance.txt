I Will Always Be Hoping Hoping  
You Will Always Be Holding Holding  
My Heart In Your Hand I Will Understand  
  
I Will Understand Someday One Day  
You Will Understand Always  
Always From Now Until Then  
  
When It Will Be Right I Dont Know  
What It Will Be Like I Dont Know  
We Live In Hope Of Deliverance From The Darkness That Surrounds Us  
  
Hope Of Deliverance Hope Of Deliverance  
Hope Of Deliverance From The Darkness That Surrounds Us  
  
And I Wouldnt Mind Knowing Knowing  
That You Wouldnt Mind Going Going Along With My Plan  
  
When It Will Be Right I Dont Know  
What It Will Be Like I Dont Know  
We Live In Hope Of Deliverance From The Darkness That Surrounds Us  
  
Hope Of Deliverance Hope Of Deliverance  
Hope Of Deliverance From The Darkness That Surrounds Us
