For your epitaph niggas laugh chicks steady gas your ass  
Siphoning out your cash seein the door the flash  
While I stay enclosed walkin out in my clothes  
She said I wouldnt trade it for nothing  
  
You motherfuckin right wantin this shit every night  
Finish up I hold her tight wearin feelings on my sleeve  
Even when I had to leave cooler than the evening breeze  
Do you believe  
I wouldnt trade it for nothing  
  
The Division One leader in the rebound with numerous shorties off the post  
Goin coast to coast she on the hardwood sub Im out the game  
She sayin Nah he good I mean  
I wouldnt trade it for nothing  
  
For no amount of dough franchise this man  
Give him all the things you can  
Think longterm plans he be bringin in the fans  
Frontpage magazine listen to this lady scream  
I wouldnt trade it for nothing  
  
Cause she know whats better for her  
Toppin in the peckin order  
Fluid like the runnin water nicest nigga Kinda sorta  
When he screamin just the slaughter no matter the quarter  
I get it  
I wouldnt trade it for nothing  
  
The clubhouse king battin practice slug and swing  
Game times anything when Im in youre bout a minute  
Holdin the bat its good as fact  
Shes out the park and comin back  
She sayin  
I wouldnt trade it for nothing  
  
Everywhere you sit you get a good view of the ballplayer and all  
And the famous hall inevitably will make a call  
Hangin memorabilia from your walls  
This is why you cant trade me  
I wouldnt trade it for nothing  
  
You can put your money on a sure thing  
Certain profits will they bring  
Ceremonies are the ringer in the White House thing  
Clear your mantle the trophies I bring  
Do you wanna trade  
I wouldnt trade it for nothing  
  
Cause in the end as a teammate  
Youre lookin for a back shoot and goto ball  
Leaves it all on the floor always lookin to score  
Peptalks in the lockerroom  
This is why you sing this tune  
I wouldnt trade it for nothing  
  
And injuries cant make me sit I ball till you get out  
Hook off no didoubt and all like get out  
I train for the pressure and come out fresher  
Equipped for the game you know my name  
It makes me better  
A cheer for the whole team lets go for the whole thing  
The ballad that youre holding MVP voting  
And I represent the sentiment youre emoting  
As you say  
I wouldnt trade it for nothing  
  
The physical ability with mental capability  
Legitimately places me inside of your vicinity  
And I aint really seein me vacatin this community  
Im stayin here  
I wouldnt trade it for nothing  
  
Im glad that you feel this way  
Heres where I like to play  
I need to hear it everyday they cheer for me say Ole  
Wait a minute Andele  
I dunno well anyway  
I wouldnt trade it for nothing
