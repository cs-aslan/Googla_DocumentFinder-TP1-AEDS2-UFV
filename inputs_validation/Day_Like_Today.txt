Woke up this morning jumped out of bed  
Hit my head on a lampshade and the clock said  
That Im running late so Im rushing trying to get on my way  
huuuhget to my car and the gauge is on E  
Get gas and I pay a dollar ninetythree  
Got stopped by the cops cause I was speeding  
Eightynine in a fiftyfive Lord why me  
  
On a day like today  
All has gone wrong and my life seems crazy  
Gotta hold on smile on my face  
Cause I know the suns gonna shine my way  
On a day like today  
Look up at the sky and know lifes so amazing  
And I know I will be okay  
Cause I know the suns gonna shine my way  
  
Its days like this theres a lesson learned  
When I get up on the wrong side of the world  
Its easy to dwell on my situation instead of every good thing  
but I know Ive been blessed I gotta say thank you  
and though theres stress Im still grateful  
its just a test hes more than able to see me through on a day  
  
On a day like today  
All has gone wrong and my life seems crazy  
Gotta hold on smile on my face  
Cause I know the suns gonna shine my way  
On a day like today  
Look up at the sky and know lifes so amazing  
And I know I will be okay  
Cause I know the suns gonna shine my way  
  
I know it wouldnt hurt to smile  
Its not as bad as it could be it will work out in a while repeat  
  
On a day like today  
All has gone wrong and my life seems crazy  
Gotta hold on smile on my face  
Cause I know the suns gonna shine my way  
On a day like today  
Look up at the sky and know lifes so amazing  
And I know I will be okay  
Cause I know the suns gonna shine my way  
  
So I just h
