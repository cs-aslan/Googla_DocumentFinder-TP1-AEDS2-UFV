Hey you got yourself a pretty little blouse  
I think I wanna rub it the wrong way  
Do you wanna spin a bottle play a game of chicken  
Well its a tongue twister till your lips are bleeding  
  
Oh anyhow anywhere  
Kiss me there oh kiss me there  
Oh scream and shout truth or dare  
Kiss me there oh kiss me there  
  
Oh youre so precious youre a fucking delinquent  
Well I got myself jonesin and I need some fixin  
Its a makeout party on another dimension  
And its gonna get crowded with some bad intensions  
  
Oh anyhow anywhere  
Kiss me there oh kiss me there  
Oh scream and shout truth or dare  
Kiss me there oh kiss me there  
  
Oh youre so precious youre a fucking delinquent  
Well I got myself jonesin and I need some fixin

Oh anyhow anywhere  
Kiss me there oh kiss me there  
Oh scream and shout truth or dare  
Kiss me there oh kiss me there  
  
Oh kiss me there  
Kiss me there
