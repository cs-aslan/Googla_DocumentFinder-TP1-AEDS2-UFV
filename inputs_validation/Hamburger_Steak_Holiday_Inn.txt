Hamburger Steak Holiday Inn thats the kinda world that I live in  
  
Play a different town most every night  
  
Lovin your woman write a new song thats my life  
  
Thats my life and I love it thats my life  
  
There aint nothin else in the world above it  
  
I see people all alone pickin their guitars and singin their songs  
  
But I tell em forget it cause you cant fake it  
  
If youre gonna make it youve gotta live it  
  
I got a big bus with a tv and a bar  
  
And a little room in the back for me and my ole guitar  
  
Gotta stop and fuel up every five hundred miles  
  
Give a picture to the waitress eat a little breakfast country style  
  
Thats my life and I love it  
  
We get home to Nashville on a Monday night  
  
Record songs on Tuesday and on Wednesday take out the wife  
  
But then on Thursday night its back on the road  
  
I dont care if its Montana or down in Louisiana just as long as I go  
  
Thats my life and I love it
