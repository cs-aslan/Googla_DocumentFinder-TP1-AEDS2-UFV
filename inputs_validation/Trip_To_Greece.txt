Theres nothing good on the T V On his trip to Greece  
And theres no toga partiesOn his trip to Greece  
So I see the ruins thereOn his trip to Greece  
They could sure use some repairOn his trip to Greece  
The first day all I eat is lots and lots of souvlaki  
For its the only word that I can speak  
But it goes right through me which is bad because Greek  
Plumbing peaked in 400 B C  
Get souvenirs for my MaOn his trip to Greece  
That were made in ChinaOn his trip to Greece  
Then down to the beach I goOn his trip to Greece  
To see something culturalOn his trip to Greece  
For I had heard the girls sunbathe in the European way  
A bigger fan of that youll never find  
When I see that its true I take off my top too  
My pasty body making them all blind  
I get water in my earOn his trip to Greece  
Which makes it kind of hard to hearOn his trip to Greece  
It isnt bad cause alreadyOn his trip to Greece  
All they say is Greek to me  
He thinks this joke is so funny  
That he says repeatedlyOn his trip to Greece  
I thought I drank a bottle full of water but it was ouzo  
Now Im going to pass out in the sand  
Oh if once again the mood hits me to go to some foreign country  
I am going to go to Disneyland
