I want you to want me  
Im goin crazy knowin he will be your lover tonight  
And when he come Ill let you go  
Ill just pretend that you walked out the door  
  
Oh no   
I cant sleep  
Oh no   
Im goin crazy with love over you  
  
I need you to need me  
I want to hold ya but youre holdin someone else in  
Your arms  
When I close my eyes I see your face  
Im just not sure how much my heart can break  
  
Oh no   
I cant think  
Oh no   
Im goin crazy with love over you  
  
Oh honey   
Oh sugar   
  
Oh no  I cant sleep anymore baby  
Oh no  I cant think anymore baby  
Oh no  Im goin crazy with love over you
