Many times I tried to tell you  
Many times I cried alone  
Always Im surprised how well you cut my feelings to the bone  
Dont want to leave you really  
Ive invested too much time to give you up that easy  
To the doubts that complicate your mind  
  
We belong to the light we belong to the thunder  
We belong to the sound of the words weve both fallen under  
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better  
We belong we belong we belong together  
  
Maybe its a sign of weakness when I dont know what to say  
Maybe I just wouldnt know what to do with my strength anyway  
Have we become a habit Do we distort the facts  
Now theres no looking forward  
Now theres no turning back  
When you say  
  
We belong to the light we belong to the thunder  
We belong to the sound of the words weve both fallen under  
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better  
We belong we belong we belong together  
  
Close your eyes and try to sleep now  
Close your eyes and try to dream  
Clear your mind and do your best to try and wash the palette clean  
We cant begin to know it how much we really care  
I hear your voice inside me I see your face everywhere  
Still you say  
  
We belong to the light we belong to the thunder  
We belong to the sound of the words weve both fallen under  
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better  
We belong we belong we belong together  
  
We belong to the light we belong to the thunder  
We belong to the sound of the words weve both fallen under  
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better  
We belong we belong we belong together  
We belong to the light we belong to the thunder
