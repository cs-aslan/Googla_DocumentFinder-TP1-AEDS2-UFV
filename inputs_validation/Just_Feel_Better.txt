She said i feel stranded  
And i cant tell anymore  
If im coming or im going  
Its not how i planned it  
I got a key to the door  
But it just wont open  
  
I know i know i know  
Part of me says let it go  
That life happens for a reason  
I dont i dont i dont  
Becuase it never worked before  
But this time  
This time  
Im gonna try anything to just feel better  
  
Tell me what to do  
You know i cant see through the haze around me  
And id do anything to just feel better  
I cant find my way  
God i need a change  
And id do anything to just feel better  
Any little thing to just feel better  
  
She said i need you to hold me  
Im a little far from the shore  
And im afraid of sinking  
Youre the only one who knows me  
And who doesnt ignore that my soul i weeping  
  
I know i know i know  
Part of me says let it go  
Everything must have its season  
round and round it goes  
Every days the one before  
But this time  
This time  
Im gonna try anything to just feel better  
  
  
Tell me what to do  
You know i cant see through the haze around me  
And id do anything to just feel better  
I cant find my way  
God i need a change  
And id do anything to just feel better  
Any little thing to just feel better  
  
Im tired of holding on  
To all the things i leave behind  
Its really getting old yea  
I think i need a little help this time  
  
Im gonna try anything to just feel better  
  
Tell me what to do  
You know i cant see through the haze around me  
And id do anything to just feel better  
I cant find my way  
God i need a change  
And id do anything to just feel better  
Any little thing to just feel better
