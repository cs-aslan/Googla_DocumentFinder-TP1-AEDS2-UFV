You hold my every moment  
You calm my raging seas  
You walk with me through fire  
And heal all my disease  
  
I trust in You  
I trust in You  
  
I believe Youre my Healer  
I believe You are all I need  
I believe Youre my Portion  
I believe Youre more than enough for me  
Jesus Youre all I need  
  
My Healer Youre my Healer  
  
Nothing is impossible for You  
Nothing is impossible for You  
Nothing is impossible for You  
You hold my world in Your hands
