Feat Ladysmith Black Mambazo  
  
I knew a man who lived in fear  
It was huge it was angry  
It was drawing near  
Behind his house a secret place  
Was the shadow of the demon  
He could never face  
  
He built a wall of steel and flame  
And men with guns to keep it tame  
Then standing back he made it plain  
That the nightmare would never ever rise again  
But the fear and the fire and the guns remain  
  
It doesnt matter now its over anyhow  
He tells the world that its sleeping  
But as the night came round I heard  
Its lonely sound  
It wasnt roaring it was weeping  
It wasnt roaring it was weeping  
  
And then one day the neighbors came  
They were curious to know about the smoke and flame  
They stood around outside the wall  
But of course there was nothing to be heard at all  
My friends he said Weve reached our goal  
The threat is under firm control  
As long as peace and order reign  
Ill be damned if I can see a reason to explain  
Why the fear and the fire and the guns remain   
  
It doesnt matter now its over anyhow  
He tells the world that its sleeping  
But as the night came round I heard  
Its lonely sound  
It wasnt roaring it was weeping  
It wasnt roaring it was weeping  
  
Say ah say ah say ah  
Say ah say ah say ah  
  
Ladysmiths solo  
  
It doesnt matter now its over anyhow  
It doesnt matter now its over anyhow  
  
It doesnt matter now its over anyhow  
He tells the world that its sleeping  
But as the night came round I heard  
Its lonely sound  
It wasnt roaring it was weeping  
It wasnt roaring it was weeping  
  
Say ah say ah say ah  
Say ah say ah say ah to end
