Donald Black John Barry  
  
Diamonds are forever  
They are all I need to please me  
They can stimulate and tease me  
They wont leave in the night  
Ive no fear that they might desert me  
  
Diamonds are forever  
Hold one up and then caress it  
Touch it stroke it and undress it  
I can see evry part  
Nothing hides in the heart to hurt me  
I dont need love  
For what good will love do me  
Diamonds never lie to me  
For when loves gone  
Theyll lustre on  
  
Diamonds are forever  
Sparkling round my little finger  
Unlike men the diamonds linger
