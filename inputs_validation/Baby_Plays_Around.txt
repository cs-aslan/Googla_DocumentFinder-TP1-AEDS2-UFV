Its not open to discussion anymore  
Hes out again tonight and Im alone once more  
Hes all I have worth waiting for  
But baby plays around  
And so it seems Ive always been the last to know  
To hold on to that girl I had to let her go  
I wish to God I didnt love her so  
Cos baby plays around  
  
I try to be strong hold on to my pride  
He doesnt even know its wrong how much  
I hurt inside  
And heaven knows Ive tried  
But baby plays around Just a plaything  
Its hard to reconcile the facts Im facing  
  
Its not open to discussion anymore  
She walks those shiny streets  
I walk the worn out floor  
Shes all I have worth living for  
Baby plays baby plays around
