If I could I Id get away  
Far from all this trouble I see everyday  
Nobody wants to show their face  
This life is like a like a masquerade  
I know you love me  
I know you care  
But while Im hurting I just need to know your there  
Watching over me and I feel your telling me  
  
Chorus  
Count it all joy and always remember  
Life will get better its gonna get better  
No matter the weapon it will not prosper  
Things will get better its gonna get better  
  
Persecuted pushed away didnt think Id live to see another day  
Cried some tears and couldnt pray and when Id try at times  
I couldnt find the words to say but now  
Im stronger because of you without you Jesus I never couldve made it
through  
Thank you for watching me loving me and telling me  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Life sometimes may change and nobody wants to feel pain  
But it came to help you grow and theres one thing you need to know  
Gods in love with you and hell never let you go  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Its gonna get better  
Its gonna get better  
Its gonna get better  
Its gonna get better  
Its gonna get better  
Its gonna get better  
Its gonna get better
