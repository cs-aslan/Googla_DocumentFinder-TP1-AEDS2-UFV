Do me wrong do me right  
Tell me lies but hold me tight  
Save your goodbyes for the morning light  
But dont let me be lonely tonight  
Say goodbye woman say hello say hello  
Sure enough good to see you oh but its time to go  
Dont say yes but please dont say no  
I dont want to be lonely tonight  
Go away then damn you  
Go and do as you please go and do as you please girl  
You aint gonna see me getting down on my knees  
Cause Im undecided and your hearts been divided  
Youve been turning my world upside down  
Do me wrong do me right do me right baby  
Go on and tell me lies but hold me tight  
Save your goodbyes for the morning light  
But dont let me be lonely tonight  
Save your goodbyes for the morning light  
But dont let me be lonely tonight  
I dont wont to be lonely tonight no no I dont  
Want to be lonely tonight  
I dont want to be lonely tonight
