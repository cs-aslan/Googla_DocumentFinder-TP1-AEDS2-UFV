Counting every moment  
Biding all my time  
Standing out here on my own  
Searching for that someone  
To heal this heart of mine  
And keep me from being alone  
But when will it be  
And how will I know  
I dont want to wait here forever  
  
Chorus  
Somebody love me  
Come and carry me away  
Somebody need me  
To be the blue in their grey  
Somebody want me  
The way Ive always dreamed it could be  
Wont somebody love me love me  
  
Im waiting for somebody  
To dance across the floor  
Sweeping me off of my feet  
Im looking for the right one  
To open up that door  
And offer me a tender retreat  
Its like wanting to sing  
But needing a song  
When will I hear the music playing  
  
Chorus
