Ive been alone too long  
Sitting by myself  
Im getting to old  
To help myself  
But I wont be hangin round your door  
Begging  
No I wont be hangin round  
To feel the pain  
And if you take my life in hand  
And finally make me understand  
It wont do no good  
Youll just hurt my plan  
And I wont be hangin round your door  
Begging  
No I wont be hangin rond  
To feel the pain  
Sometimes I think I cant go on  
And every day I live  
Well it seems like my lifes unreal  
Sometimes I think I wont live too long  
But I hope Im wrong  
Thats the way I feel  
And I wont be hangin round your door  
Begging  
No I wont be hangin round  
To steal a kiss  
I wont be hanging round your door  
Begging  
No I wont be hangin round  
To feel the pain  
No I wont be hangin round your door  
Begging  
Oh I wont be hangin round  
To feel the pain
