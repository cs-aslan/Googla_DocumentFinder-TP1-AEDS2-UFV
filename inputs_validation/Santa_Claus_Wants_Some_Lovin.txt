Now Mamas in the kitchen cookin  
And her children are fast asleep  
Its time for Santa Claus to make his midnight creep cause  
Santa Claus Wants Some Lovin  
Santa Claus wants some lovin  
I know theres something real pretty  
Underneath that christmas tree  
But I aint had no lovin and its wearin me cause  
Santa Claus wants some lovin  
Santa Claus wants some lovin  
Now I been trying to fix this old bicycle  
Cant seem to find my pliers  
Halfway watchin Mama for that sleep in her eyes cause  
Santa Claus wants some lovin  
  
Santa Claus wants some lovin  
I dont want no turkey  
Dont care about no cake  
I want you to come here Mama fore the children wake cause  
Santa Claus wants some lovin  
Santa Claus wants some lovin  
Now christmas is for the children  
And I want them to be real pleased  
But right now Mama its christmas eve  
Come make your Papa happy please  
Santa Claus wants some lovin  
Santa Claus wants some lovin
