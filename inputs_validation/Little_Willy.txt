North side east side  
Little Willy Willy wears the crown hes the king around town  
Dancing glancing  
Willy drives them silly with his star shoe shimmy shuffle down  
Way past one and feeling alright  
Cause with little Willy round they can last all night  
Hey down stay down stay down down  
Cause  
  
Chorus  
Little Willy Willy wont go home  
But you cant push Willy round  
Willy wont go try tellin everybody but oh no  
Little Willy Willy wont go home  
  
Up town down town  
Little Willy Willy drives them wild with his runaround style  
Inside outside  
Willy sends them silly with his starshine shimmy shuffle smile  
Mama done chase Willy down the hall  
But laugh Willy laugh he dont care at all  
Hey down stay down stay down down  
Cause  
  
Chorus  
  
Little Willy Willy wont  
Willy wont Willy wont  
Little Willy Willy wont  
Willy wont Willy wont  
Little Willy Willy wont  
Willy wont Willy wont  
Little Willy Willy wont  
Willy wont Willy wont
