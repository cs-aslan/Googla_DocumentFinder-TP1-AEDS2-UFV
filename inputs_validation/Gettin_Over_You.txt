Lover lets get it straight  
Somthins passin much too late  
To discover on down the line  
Its fallin apart I just might be gettin   
  
Chorus  
O  over you  
Im gettin o  over you  
  
Oh we really   
Oh we really  oh we really tried  
Oh we really   
Had that look in our eye  
Aint it crazy   
That I let you go  
I dont understand I just dont know gettin   
  
Chorus  
  
You look with the love that surrounds me  
Blue darkest Ive ever seen  
We take the cost of the time going through changes  
Whats the loss gettin over you you  
  
You look with the love that surrounds me  
Blue darkest Ive ever seen  
We take the cost of the time going through changes  
Whats the loss gettin over you  
  
Im gettin over you  
Im gettin over you  
Im gettin over you  
Im gettin over you
