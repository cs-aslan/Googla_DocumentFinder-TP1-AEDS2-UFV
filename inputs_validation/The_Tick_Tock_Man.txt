Look at your face  
Its so fortunately arranged  
Dont look back  
I can assure you that you wont like what you see  
  
You step on my dreams  
I could whisper  
You intrude on me  
I could whisper  
You close in and Im so uneasy  
  
Hotel rooms sweet dreams  
Like slot machines that call it Love love  
A coin in the hole  
You young things never stay young for longe  
  
This edge in my voice  
But theres really nothing much to say  
My conscience mends  
I suppose it all meant something to you  
  
You step on my dreams  
I could whisper  
You intrude on me  
I could whisper  
You close in and Im so uneasy
