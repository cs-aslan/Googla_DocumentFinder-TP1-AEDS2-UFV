Dont do anything I wouldnt do  
Pass me anyway like Im a fool for you  
Passionate anyway  
Walkin out the back door  
Used to be alive until just now  
Its just becoming unreal  
Youre only losing your heart  
Its nothing critical  
You wont believe it till it starts  
Youre only losing your heart  
Its not unusual  
Its only tearing you apart  
Dont do anything I wouldnt do  
Pass me anyway lie like a fool  
Laugh at me anyway  
Walkin out the back door  
Used to be alive until just now  
Its just becoming unreal  
Youre only losing your heart  
Its nothing critical  
You wont believe it till it starts  
Youre only losing your heart  
Its not unusual  
Its only tearing you apart  
Oh how can I be  
So far away  
Without a reason  
Should I know  
How not to lose  
How can I not  
Follow you anywhere  
But Im lost  
Take me away  
Takin all my time make me a choice  
Passionate anyway  
Walkin out the back door  
Used to be alive until just now  
Its just becoming unreal  
Youre only losing your heart  
Its nothing critical  
You wont believe it till it starts  
Youre only losing your heart  
You cant believe it to be  
The thing thats tearing you apart  
Youre only losing your heart  
Its nothing visual  
You wont believe it till it starts  
Youre only losing your heart  
The thing youre dreamin of is  
The thing thats tearing you apart  
Even though Im wasting my time
