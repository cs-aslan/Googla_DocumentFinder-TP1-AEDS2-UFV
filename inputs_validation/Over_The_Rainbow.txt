Somewhere over the rainbow way up high  
Theres a land that Ive heard of once in a lullaby  
Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue  
And the dreams that you dare to dream  
Really do come true  
  
Someday Ill wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops  
High above the chimney tops  
Thats where youll find me  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why then oh why cant I  
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow  
Why oh why cant I  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow way up high

Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue  
And the dreams that you dare to dream

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops  
High above the chimney tops  
Thats where youll find me  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why then oh why cant I  
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow  
Why oh why cant I
