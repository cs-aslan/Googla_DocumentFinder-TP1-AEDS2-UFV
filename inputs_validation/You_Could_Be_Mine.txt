Im a cold heartbreaker  
Fit ta burn and Ill rip your heart in two  
And Ill leave you lyin on the bed  
Ill be out the door before you wake  
Its nuthin new to you  
Cause I think weve seen that movie too  
  
Cause you could be mine  
But youre way out of line  
With your bitch slap rappin  
And your cocaine tongue  
You get nuthin done  
I said you could be mine  
  
Now holidays come and then they go  
Its nothin new today  
Collect another memory  
When I come home late at night  
Dont ask me where Ive been  
Just count your stars Im home again  
  
Cause you could be mine  
But youre way out of line  
With your bitch slap rappin  
And your cocaine tongue  
You get nuthin done  
I said you could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine mine mine mine  
  
Youve gone sketchin too many times  
Why dont you give it a rest  
Why  
Must you find  
Another reason to cry  
  
While youre breakin down my back n  
I been rackin out my brain  
It dont matter how we make it  
Cause it always ends the same  
You can push it for more mileage  
But your flaps are wearin thin  
And I could sleep on it til mornin  
But this nightmare never ends  
Dont forget to call my lawyers  
With ridiculous demands  
An you can take the pity so far  
But its more than I can stand  
Cause this couchtrips gettin older  
Tell me how long has it been  
Cause five years is forever  
And you havent grown up yet  
  
You could be mine  
But youre way out of line  
With your bitch slap rappin  
And your cocaine tongue  
You get nuthin done  
I said you could be  
You should be  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine
