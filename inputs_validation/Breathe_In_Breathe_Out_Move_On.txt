Jimmy Buffett and Matt Betton  
  
I bought a cheap watch from a crazy man  
Floating down canal  
It doesnt use numbers or moving hands  
It always just says now  
Now you may be thinking that I was had  
But this watch is never wrong  
And If I have trouble the warranty said  
Breathe In Breathe Out Move On  
  
And it rained It was nothing really new  
And it blew weve seen all that before  
And it poured the Earth began to strain  
Pontchartrain leaking through the door tides at war  
  
If a hurricane doesnt leave you dead  
It will make you strong  
Dont try to explain it just nod your head  
Breathe In Breathe Out Move On  
  
Guitar Solo  
  
And it rained It was nothing really new  
And it blew seen all that before  
And it poured the Earth began to strain  
Pontchartrain buried the 9th Ward to the 2nd floor  
  
According to my watch the time is now  
Past is dead and gone  
Dont try to shake it just nod your head  
Breathe In Breathe Out Move On  
  
Dont try to shake it just bow your head  
Breathe In Breathe Out Move On
