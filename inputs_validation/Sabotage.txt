You could make my day  
What did I do anyway  
Change your mind and stay  
We can shake the blues away  
  
Girl this aint a game  
That we both should play  
Maybe I was wrong  
Treating you that way  
  
You could make my day  
What did I do anyway  
Change your mind and stay  
We could shake the blues away  
  
Anytime you want me  
If youre feeling down  
Why dont you come with me  
Ill turn you around  
  
I wish I could cross this great divide  
Be with you there on the other side  
Together well scale this mountain high  
We both could run this river dry  
  
Its not that easy you say  
Were different people  
Sometimes you think Im ok  
Sometimes Im evil  
No matter how much you cry  
That dirt will stay in your eye  
Its getting harder to find  
But we dont have a deadline  
  
You put me to the test  
This could be our getaway  
You keep me feeling fresh  
Were driving down that highway  
  
Anytime you want me  
If youre feeling down  
Why dont you come with me  
Ill turn you around  
  
I wish I could cross this great divide  
Be with you there on the other side  
Together well scale this mountain high  
We both could run this river dry  
  
I wish I could cross this great divide  
Be with you there on the other side  
I wish I could cross this great divide  
Be with you there on the other side
