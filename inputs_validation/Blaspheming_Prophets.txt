Modern world men  
Blinded by technology  
Using the Lords words  
For their own material needs  
Stealing the goods  
From the faithful ones  
Evangelists in suits  
Dominating their thoughts  
And souls thrown in blasphemy  
They dont know about the truth  
But they try to convince you  
CHORUS  
I wonder how God can resist  
Using his words like this  
Speaking the holy words  
But in a different way in terror  
They teachem not to be saved  
But leading them to an error leavingem unsafe  
Malignant force are speaking  
Through the false prophets  
They dont know that an evil spirit  
Can take a preachers soul  
LEAD  
LEAD  
A fucking organization determined to rule the world  
Preparing those for their supreme evil one  
Ask for good help now  
Before its too late you all  
After they steal your soul they even take your money away  
Trying to put all other religion down  
Like if them all was in vain  
Satan is draining their souls  
And they cant feel it  
They are all blind now  
cause they left their true religion  
Each day their legion  
Is growing more and stronger  
Pretty soon therell be  
No one left to survive  
Innocent people looking for guidance  
They dont know who theyre messing with  
CHORUS  
I wonder how God can resist  
Using his words like this  
Taking the Bible to make a profit  
They cant escape from the blaspheming prophets  
LEAD
