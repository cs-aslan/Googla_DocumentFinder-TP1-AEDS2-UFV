Go down my road running just as fast as I can  
Nobody knows which is the better way  
But when that man in the sky points his finger at you  
Dont you ever think noones better than you  
  
Gods great banana skin  
Dont you laugh at nobody  
Youll let the bad luck in  
Gods great banana skin  
Its the way that it gets you  
With every day good luck comes in the strangest of ways  
Just keep your head down dont listen what your ego will say  
cause when that man in the sky points his finger at you  
Dont you ever think noones better than you  
  
Gods great banana skin  
Dont you laugh at nobody  
Youll let the bad luck in  
Gods great banana skin  
Its the way that it gets you  
  
Gods great banana skin  
Gods great banana skin  
  
When that man in the sky points his finger at you  
Dont you ever think noones better than you  
Dont you ever think noones better than you  
  
Gods great banana skin  
Gonna get you  
Gods great banana skin
