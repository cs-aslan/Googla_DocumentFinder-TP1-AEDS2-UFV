Nothing changes cause its all the same  
The world you gets the one you give away  
It all just happens again  
Way down the line  
  
There is a chain thats never broken  
You know the story its sad but true  
An angry man gets drunk and beats his kids  
The same old way his drunken father did  
  
What comes around well it goes around  
Nothing changes cause its all the same  
The world you gets the one you give away  
It all just happens again  
Way down the line  
  
At 17 Shannon is pregnant  
As young as her mom when she had her  
Her kid is never gonna have a dad  
The same old way that Shannon never had  
  
What comes around well it goes around  
Nothing changes cause its all the same  
The world you gets the one you give away  
It all just happens again  
  
Way down the line  
And all the things you learn when youre a kid  
Youll fuck up just like your parents did  
It all just happens again  
Way down the line  
  
And welfare moms have kids on welfare  
And fat parents they have fat kids too  
You know its never gonna end  
The same old cycles gonna start again  
What comes around well it goes around
