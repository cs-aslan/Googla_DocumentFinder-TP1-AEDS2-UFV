Let me be your leader  
Let me have control  
The way I see it  
Its got to be right for you  
  
I could be your pilot  
Through the stormy seas  
The way you see it  
Its just a case of trust in me  
  
I could be your hero  
Ill be your piece of mind  
The way that I see it  
Its got to be good for you  
  
I want to be your brother  
If you need a friend  
The way you see it  
Its got to be right by me  
  
Winnerslosers  
Takersusers  
What do you see in your crystal ball for you  
Do you see an old wound fade into the blue  
  
I will be your lifeline  
If your ship goes down  
The way that I see it  
Youve got to have faith in me  
  
I want to be your partner  
Through the darkest nights  
The way you see it  
Its always just you and me  
  
Midnight screamers  
Daytime dreamers  
What do you see in your crystal ball for you  
Do you see an old wound fade into the blue
