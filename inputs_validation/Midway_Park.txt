Ill ride with you tonight  
Ill ride forever  
Theres no way to predict this kind of weather  
Ashes fall to earth  
Words are severed  
Feathers turn to weighted iron pillars  
Midway Park  
Streetlights shine on a road that is dark  
Down on the graves  
Where well lie  
Well lie  
Well lie  
Ill think of you tonight  
Ill think forever  
Theres no way to predict this kind of weather  
Ashes fall to earth  
Words are severed  
Feathers turn to broken beads and pillars  
Midway Park  
Streetlights shine on a road that is dark  
Down on the graves  
Well lie  
Where well lie  
Well lie  
Dont tell the truth  
Well lie  
Just lie
