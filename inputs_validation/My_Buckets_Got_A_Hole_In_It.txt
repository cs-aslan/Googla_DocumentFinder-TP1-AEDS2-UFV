Yeah my buckets got a hole in it  
Yeah my buckets got a hole in it  
Yeah my buckets got a hole in it  
I cant buy no beer  
  
Well Im standin on a corner  
With a bucket in my hand  
Im waitin for a woman  
That aint got no man  
  
Cause my buckets got a hole in it  
Yeah my buckets got a hole in it  
Yeah my buckets got a hole in it  
I cant buy no beer  
  
Well I went upon the mountain  
I looked down in the sea  
I seen the crabs and the fishes  
Doin the bebopbee  
  
Cause my buckets got a hole in it  
Yeah my buckets got a hole in it  
Yeah my buckets got a hole in it  
I cant buy no beer

Of me workin so hard  
When I got a woman  
In the boss mans yard  
  
Cause my buckets got a hole in it  
Yeah my buckets got a hole in it  
Yeah my buckets got a hole in it

Yeah my buckets got a hole in it  
Yeah my buckets got a hole in it
