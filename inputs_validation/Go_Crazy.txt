Guess whos bizzack  
Still smell the blow on my clothes  
Like crispy cream I was cooking them os  
Like horseshoes I was tossin them os  
Time to reup gotta recycle the flow  
Im emotional  
I hug the block  
Im so emotional  
I love my glock  
Cash rules everything around me  
So whats realer  
Bout the scriller so call me a ghost face killa  
Its kinda hard to be drug free  
When georgia power wont give a nigga lights free  
Switched hustles been killin em ever since  
Been paid to tell the truth it only make sense  
  
Chorus  
When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy  
And watch the dope boys go crazy  
I pop my collar then I swing my chain  
If you catch me in the club pimpin doing my thing  
When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy  
And watch the dope boys go crazy  
They pop my collar then they swing they chain  
All the gangstas in the street that be doin they thing  
  
By 18 the hard way  
Now have a humble nigga thinkin bout gun play  
Now who the fuck want to play with guns  
A lotta hoes a lotta blood dog  
That shit aint fun  
So I suggest that you dont play with my chain  
Or Ill send these hollows at you  
Let them play with ya brain  
The streets is watchin  
The name is warm  
The products white  
A star is born  
Pimpin Im so fly  
I take this parachute off  
I might fall and die  
Wrap the work with spandex with the latex  
Then we ship it outta town  
Call it safe sex  
  
Chorus  
  
Uh more than a hustla Im the definition of it  
Master chef lord of the kitchen cupboard  
More than a street legend homey its hova  
More than a relief pitcher Im the closer  
The Mariano of the Marriott ah  
If money talks the whole worlds bout to hear me out  
See Im a hustlers hope Im not his pipe dreams  
So when they speak of success Im what they might mean  
Attract money my worst color is light green  
My favorite hue is JayZ blue  
Dont follow me youngn follow my moves Im not a role model  
A bad influence got the world drinkin gold bottles  
When puff was in that tub spillin mo  
I was at my video cris on the speedboat  
In my lifetime nigga go through your research  
St Thomas my nigga that was me first  
Chrome shoed the gs I came feet first  
In the game like a baby boo on the breach birth  
I got the keys if you need work  
I can kingpin you a line the diamond of time uhh  
My niggaz love it when I talk like this  
My corporate people start buggin cause I talk like this  
The corporate thugs is like Nah hov talk that shit  
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy jayz  
See Ima 80s baby master  
School of hard knocks everyday is college  
You aint did nothin I aint did nigga pay homage  
Or pay the doctor I sprayed lamis  
Still the timell reveal you know Im bein honest  
Ya aint put my coat yet and I keep my shit in coat check  
They say the truth shall come to the light  
So everybody grab your chains cause your boy that bright  
  
Chorus
