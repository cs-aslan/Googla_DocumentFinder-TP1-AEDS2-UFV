Id wait for you  
Id slave for you  
Id be a beggar  
Or a knave for you  
If that isnt love  
It will have to do  
Until the real thing  
Comes along  
  
Id gladly move  
The earth for you  
To prove my love dear  
And its worth for you  
I that isnt love  
It will have to do  
Until the real thing  
Comes along  
  
With all the words  
Dear at my command  
I just cant make  
You understand  
Ill always love you  
Darling  
Come what may  
My heart is yours  
What more can I say  
  
Id lie for you  
Id sigh for you  
Id tear the stars  
Down  
From the sky for you  
If that isnt love  
It will have to do  
Until the real thing  
Comes along  
  
With all the words  
Dear at my command  
I just cant make  
You understand  
Ill always  
Love you baby  
Come what may  
My heart is yours  
What more can I say  
  
Id lie for you  
Id cry for you  
Id lay my body down  
And die tor you  
If that isnt love  
It will have to do  
Until the real thing  
Comes along
