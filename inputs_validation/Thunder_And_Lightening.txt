I never thought Id ever get tired of playing games  
But Ive been holding back for too long  
Now the time has come to get it right  
Nows the time to show them all that theyre wrong  
  
Cos they said thunder and they said lightning  
It would never strike twice  
Oh but if thats true why cant you tell me  
How come this feels so nice Oh it feels alright  
  
Never ever did believe in guiding lights  
Cos what you didnt hold slipped away  
Oh but theres a feeling deep down in my shoe  
Cos things look like theyre going my way  
  
Cos they say thunder and they say lightning  
It would never strike twice  
Oh but if thats true why cant you tell me  
How come this feels so nice Oh it feels alright  
  
I never ever did believe in a second chance  
You get just one crack of the whip thats all  
If you played the game you got treated right  
Oh but Im not playing the game no more  
  
Cos they say thunder and they say lightning  
It would never strike twice  
Oh but if thats true why cant you tell me  
How come this feels so nice Oh it feels alright
