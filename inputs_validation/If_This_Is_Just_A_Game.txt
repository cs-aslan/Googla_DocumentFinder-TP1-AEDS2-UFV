If I give my love to you girl will I get love in return  
Or will I just get a fire for as long as it will burn  
Im not looking for a lover I dont even want a friend  
I want this to last forever and forever never ends  
  
Dont tell me lies or hypnotize me with your eyes  
While saying that you need me  
If this is just a one night stand Id rather turn around and walk away  
Dont hold me in your arms and run your fingers through my hair  
If you dont love me  
If this is just a game well honey I dont think I really care to play  
  
Ive trusted you before babe and you always let me down  
I came back to you believing I was more than just a clown  
You say it will be different this time your love is real  
Honey dont make me believe you if that aint the way you feel  
  
Dont tell me lies or hypnotize me with your eyes  
While saying that you need me  
If this is just a one night stand Id rather turn around and walk away  
Dont hold me in your arms and run your fingers through my hair  
If you dont love me  
If this is just a game well honey I dont think I really care to play  
  
Dont tell me lies or hypnotize me with your eyes  
While saying that you need me  
If this is just a one night stand Id rather turn around and walk away  
Dont hold me in your arms and run your fingers through my hair  
If you dont love me
