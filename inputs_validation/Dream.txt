Theres no problem that I cant solve  
In a test of our love  
If your love was multiple choice  
Youd be all of the above  
Youre the answer to all my questions  
No need to cheat  
Together were the perfect score  
You make me complete  
I never seen a woman  
With so much beauty and class  
My heart was always a failure  
Til you helped me pass  
I wanna give you my all now  
No more excuses  
Cause without you in my life  
My life is so  
Useless  
  
Chorus  
I played every game in the book  
But you changed my perspective  
And for the first time  
Love my only objective  
Moments can be feelings  
Things arent always what they seem  
Baby if Im sleeping  
Please dont wake me from this dream  
Verse 2  
Your heart and I enganged  
In a game of hide and seek  
Since our very first encounter  
I was playing finders keep  
No need to look any further  
Already found my soulmate  
Although it took a little while  
Baby you were the whole way  
Baby cant you understand  
That I wanna put a ring on your hand  
Baby I cant say Im perfect  
We both know Im not  
But I think its about time that we tie the knot  
Cuz Ive played every game  
Chorus  
I played every game in the book  
But you changed my perspective  
And for the first time  
Love my only objective  
Moments can be feelings  
Things arent always what they seem  
Baby if Im sleeping  
Please dont wake me from this dream  
Dont wake me from this dream  
  
Verse 3  
Baby youre the one that makes me whole  
But while youre warming up my soul  
At the same time  
Youre breaking my heart  
I knew we would fall in love from the start  
Chorus  
I played every game in the book  
But you changed my perspective  
And for the first time  
Love my only objective  
Moments can be feelings  
Things arent always what they seem  
Baby if Im sleeping  
Please dont wake me from this dream  
Dont wake me from this dream
