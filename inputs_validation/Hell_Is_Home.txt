Youre looking at me why  
Sort of like a leper vibe  
Okay for your kind  
But its too good for me  
  
And a hey I know Im  
Never gonna qualify  
For all the bullshit  
Of your social degrees  
  
Oh look down your noses at me  
Hating my identity  
Oh but that dont mean a damn thing you see  
Cause down here in Hell everybody loves me  
  
Hey I know Im antisocial  
Cause you act like Im infected  
With some atrocity  
  
And though I know Im  
Every bit the same inside  
My face dont fit  
Its like Ive got some disease  
  
Oh you keep your face turned away  
To strip me of identity  
Oh still got my fortune and fame  
Cause down here in Hell everyone knows my name  
  
Hell is home to me  
Might as well be  
I like it here and nowhere else invited me  
Hell is home to me  
It has to be cause Jesus Christ  
Nobody else invited me  
  
Now I belong  
I found my home  
Cause even though I know things wont  
Get any better they can certainly never get much worse  
  
Hell is home to me  
Might as well be  
I like it here and nowhere else invited me  
Hell is home to me  
It has to be cause Jesus Christ  
Nobody else invited me  
  
Say my whole life Ive always been disliked  
Ignored unless youre spitting insults at me  
And I dont know why you felt so justified  
In all the degradation that you dished on me  
  
Oh Now my status has changed  
And youve got yourself to blame  
Oh Ill grab all the attention I crave  
Now Im running Hell Heaven wont be the same  
  
Hell is home to me  
Might as well be  
I like it here and nowhere else invited me  
Hell is home to me  
It has to be cause Jesus Christ  
Nobody else invited me
