Her heart has had more knocks than a gypsys tambourine  
Yet its worth more gold than any man has ever seen  
And although no one has fallen for her like shes fallen for them  
She says her heart isnt broken its only broken in  
Shes ready for someone to love her  
Someone to hold her tight  
Some to curl up next to when her feet get cold at night  
Shes weathered the whirlwind romance  
Stood through the onenight stands  
Shes ready for someone to love her  
Wholl be the lucky man  
Well she has had her fill of those unfullfilling men  
You know the kind that come calling never to call back again  
Oh shes bound and determined not to be fooled anymore  
And poor thing shell keep that promise  
The same way she kept it before  
Shes ready for someone to love her  
Someone to hold her tight  
Some to curl up next to when her feet get cold at night  
Shes weathered the whirlwind romance  
Stood through the onenight stands  
Shes ready for someone to love her  
Wholl be the lucky man  
Shes ready for someone to love her  
Someone to hold her tight  
Some to curl up next to when her feet get cold at night  
Shes weathered the whirlwind romance  
Stood through the onenight stands  
Shes ready for someone to love her  
Wholl be the lucky man  
You know shes ready for someone to love her
