Mama been workin so hard  
Keep on workin mama but you dont get far  
But baby I know baby youre blind  
And Ill keep arisin mama just to show youre mine  
And I keep workin on you  
Well I been watchin you grow  
And baby you got what it takes to let me know  
Sure as the devil rise in the blind  
Its gonna be nasty and its gonna be mine  
I been workin on you  
Keep on movin pretty baby I feel you in my heart  
Gentle on me movin honey honey but you cant be far but you  
Keep on with me true to form  
I cant ask for more now but your  
Soul star is born
