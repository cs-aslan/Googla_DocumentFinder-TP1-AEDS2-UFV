Gonna rage gonna riot til were passing out  
Have the time of our lives never take it slow

To the young and the reckless come and catch the disease  
Gonna stay up all nightn do whatever we please  
Because you only die once so today we seize  
So dont wait up wait up give it up to me  
  
Dont wait up for us

Break out the hard days nights and escape the dream
