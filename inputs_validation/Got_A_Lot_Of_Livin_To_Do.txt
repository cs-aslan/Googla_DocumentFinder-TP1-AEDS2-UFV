Oh yes Ive got a lot o living to do  
A whole lot o loving to do  
Come on baby to make a party takes two  
Oh yes Ive got a lot o living to do  
  
A whole lot o loving to do  
And theres no one who Id rather do it witha than you  
Theres a moon thats big and bright in the milky way tonight  
But the way you act you never would know its there  
  
So baby times a wasting  
A lot of kisses I aint been tasting  
I dont know about you but Im gonna get my share  
Oh got a lot o living to do  
  
A whole lot o loving to do  
Come on baby to make a party takes two  
Oh yes Ive got a lot o living to do  
A whole lot o loving to do  
  
And theres no one who Id rather do it witha than you  
Theres a balmy little breeze  
Thats whistling through the trees  
And its telling you to pitch a little woo with me  
  
Why dont you take a listen  
Youll never know what youve been missing  
Cuddle up a little closer and be my little honey bee  
Oh got a lot o living to do  
  
A whole lot o loving to do  
Come on baby to make a party takes two  
Oh yes Ive got a lot o living to do  
A whole lot o loving to do  
  
And theres no one who Id rather do it witha than you  
Youre the prettiest thing Ive seen  
But you treat me so doggone mean  
Aint you got no heart Im dying to hold you near  
  
Why do you keep me waiting  
Why dont you start cooperating  
And the things I say are things you want to hear  
Oh got a lot o living to do  
  
A whole lot o loving to do  
Come on baby to make a party takes two  
Oh yes Ive got a lot o living to do  
A whole lot o loving to do  
And theres no one who Id rather do it witha than you
