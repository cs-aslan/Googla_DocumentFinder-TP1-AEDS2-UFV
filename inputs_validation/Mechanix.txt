Imagine you were at my station  
And you brought your motor to me  
Your a burner yeah a real motor car  
Said you wanna get your order filled  
Made me shiver when I put it in  
Pumping just wont do ya know luckily for you  
  
Whoever thought youd be better  
At turning a screw than me  
I do it for my life  
Made my drive shaft crank  
Made my pistons bulge  
Melt my ball bearings from the heat  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
We were shifting hard when we took off  
Put tonight all four on the floor  
When we hit top end you know it feels to slow  
Said you wanna get your order filled  
Made me shiver when I put it in  
Pumping just wont do ya know luckily for you  
  
Whoever thought youd be better  
At turning a screw than me  
I do it for my life  
Made my drive shaft crank  
Made my pistons bulge  
Melt my ball bearings from the heat  
Oh yeah yeah  
Oh  
  
Im giving you my room service  
And ya know its more than enough  
Oh one more time ya know Im in love  
  
Whoever thought youd be better  
At turning a screw than me  
I do it for my life  
Made my drive shaft crank  
Made my pistons bulge  
Melt my ball bearing from the heat  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
Imagine you were at my station  
And you brought your motor to me  
With all four on the floor I feel whats in store  
  
Whoever thought youd be better  
At turning a screw than me  
I do it for my life  
Made my drive shaft crank  
Made my pistons bulge  
Melt my ball bearings from the heat  
Oh yeah yeah
