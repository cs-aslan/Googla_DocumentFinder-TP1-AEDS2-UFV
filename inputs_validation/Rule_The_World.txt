Theres a garden of hope  
In a town called faith  
And the state of Happiness  
Is not far away  
From the country of wants and the sea of needs  
Ill take you there with me  
Someday when I rule the world  
Gonna stand by you  
Love you all I can  
Youre beautiful  
The reason I believe  
Dont give up on me  
Ill make it wonderful  
When I rule the world  
When I look into your eyes  
Oohh it just amazes me  
And the way I feel inside  
When your changing me  
Through the sweat and the tears  
Moving step by step  
Ill do anything for you  
Someday when I  
High High above it all  
In the sky you promised I choose to stand  
Stand by you Ill stand by you  
Someday when I  
the reason I believe  
Oh dont give up on me  
Ill make it wonderful when I rule te World
