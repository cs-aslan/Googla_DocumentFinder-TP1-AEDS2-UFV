As I span the cosmos The cosmos  
Mahogany travel at the speed of sound Sound  
Span the mainstream but still esteemed underground Unh  
My parameters and wrap up contaminants  
Travel twice Earths diameter intimidating amateurs Intimidatingwhat  
At the Apollo I played the shepherd sheep followed Sheep followed  
Chicks try to model after me like Im Tyra Like Im Tyra Pause Banks  
Banks  
want to thank me because my statements are prodigious digious  
Styles so prestigious make a sinner act religious Act religiouus  
Street academics seen a lot of girls mimic Huh  
But when its all over you can tell whos the gimmick You can tell  
L slangbangs Slangbang like a dub plate Bing  
Jericho Sound System mash up your club dates Mash up your  
Sweeter than a cherry on a fruit cocktail  
Whenever Wherever Whatever Whenever Wherever Whatever  Singing  
Like Maxwell Unh  
My pentium makes more chips than Intel Intel  
I didnt mean to turn you on I didnt mean to turn you on  
Like Sherell  Uh Huh  
Kids move they body like theyre tripping off of acid Anthony  
Not even fantasy can surpass it Unh unh  
Once you blast it one starts to feel kinky  
I think thee goes by the name of Young Slinky  
And just when you thought it was safe to relax Safe to relax  
LBoogie spits with perfect syntax  Perfect syntax  
Then DJ Skribble make you dribble on the wax What
