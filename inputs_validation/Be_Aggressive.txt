I started this  
Its all for me  
Whats yours is mine and mine is mine  
Thats plain to see  
So give it up  
Ive got to have  
I swalllow I swalllow I swalllow I swalllow  
Be aggressive  
Bee aggressive  
BeeaggareessIve  
What someone else  
Would leave behind  
And spit it out let go to waste  
I claim as mine  
Youre my flavour of the week  
I swalllow I swalllow I swalllow I swalllow  
Tall and reckless  
Ugly seed  
Reach down my throat  
You filthy bird  
Thats all I need  
The empty pit  
Ive got to feed  
To prove Im fit  
A healthy man  
Ive got to be  
Malnutrition my submission  
Youre the master and I take it on my knees  
Ejaculation  
Tribulation  
I swalllow I swalllow I swalllow I swalllow  
Be aggressive  
Bee aggressive  
BeeaggareessIve  
Go fight go fight go fight go fight win
