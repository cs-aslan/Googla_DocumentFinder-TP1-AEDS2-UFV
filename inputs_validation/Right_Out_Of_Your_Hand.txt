Please forgive me  
If I appear unkind  
But any fool can tell you  
Its all in your mind  
  
Down in the meadow  
The old lion stirs  
Puts his hand cross his mouth  
He has no use for words  
  
Poor little girl  
With your handful of snow  
Poor little girl  
Had no way to know  
  
And youve got me eating  
Youve got me eating  
Youve got me eating  
Right out of your hand  
  
I mean you no harm  
When I tell you youre blind  
Give a sucker an even break  
Hell lose it all every time  
  
The airborne starlings circle  
Over the frozen fields  
The hollyhocks hang harmlessly  
And the old lion yields  
  
And youve got me eating  
Youve got me eating  
Youve got me eating  
Right out of your hand
