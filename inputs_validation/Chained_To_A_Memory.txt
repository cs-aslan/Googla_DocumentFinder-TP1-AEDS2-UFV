Why am I chained to a memory  
Why does the thought of you still torture me  
When will I find someone to set me free  
So I wont be chained to a memory mmm  
  
Why am I chained to the hurt I knew  
Each day the thought of something so cruel to do  
Where in this world will I escape from you  
So I wont be chained to a memory  
  
Your letters threw them on the fire  
Your pictures out the window  
All that I could find that reminded me of you  
I threw them all away  
  
I get up in the morning  
Im pacing the floor  
Like Im expecting you to walk in the door  
I keep forgetting I wont see you anymore  
Guess Im doomed to be chained to a memory  
  
Oh yes I am  
I get up in the morning  
Im pacing the floor  
Like Im expecting you to walk in the door  
I keep forgetting I wont see you anymore  
Guess Im doomed to be chained to a memory  
Yes I am
