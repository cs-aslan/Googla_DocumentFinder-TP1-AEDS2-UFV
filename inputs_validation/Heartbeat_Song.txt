Chorus  
This is my heartbeat song and Im gonna play it  
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
  
Verse 1  
You where the hell did you come from  
Youre a different different kind of fun  
And Im used to feeling numb  
Now I got pins and needles on my tongue  
Anticipating whats to come  
Like a finger on a loaded gun  
  
I can feel it rising  
Temperature inside me  
Havent felt for a long time  
  
Chorus  
This is my heartbeat song and Im gonna play it  
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
This is my heartbeat song and Im gonna play it  
Turn it on  
But I know you can take it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
  
Verse 2  
I I wasnt even gonna go out  
But I never would have had a doubt  
If I dont know where Id be now  
  
Your hands on my hips  
And my kiss on your lips  
And I could do this for a long time  
  
Chorus  
This is my heartbeat song and Im gonna play it  
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
This is my heartbeat song and Im gonna play it  
Turn it on  
But I know you can take it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
  
Bridge  
Until tonight I only dreamed about you  
I cant believe Ill ever breathe without you  
Baby you make me feel alive and brand new  
Bring it one more time one more time  
  
Chorus  
This is my heartbeat song and Im gonna play it  
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
This is my heartbeat song and Im gonna play it  
Turn it on  
But I know you can take it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
  
This is my heartbeat song and Im gonna play it  
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
This is my heartbeat song and Im gonna play it  
Turn it on  
But I know you can take it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long
