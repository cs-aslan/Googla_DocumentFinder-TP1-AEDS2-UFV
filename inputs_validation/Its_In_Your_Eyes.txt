Its in your eyes  
The love you hide away  
You cant disguise  
The things you feel the thing you say  
  
If you just call my name  
Any time at all Ill be there  
  
I dont know why  
The way youre falling away from me  
I cant describe  
Its how it feels its what I see  
  
If you just call my name  
Anytime at all  
Anytime at all  
Anytime at all Ill be there  
  
I look around all I see is you  
But you gotta tell me that you want me too  
Look at me youre all that I need its true  
  
Im here just call my name  
Anytime at all Ill be there  
  
I look around all I see is you  
But you gotta tell me that you want me too  
Look at me youre all that I need its true  
  
I cant disguise  
The love I wait for you to share  
I cant deny  
If you reach out and touch my hand its there  
  
Or just call my name  
Anytime at all  
Anytime at all  
Anytime at all Ill be there
