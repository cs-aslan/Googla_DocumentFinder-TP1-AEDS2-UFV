Go ahead and cry now  
Just give in to the madness  
The only way to feel your joy  
Is to first feel the sadness  
  
Go ahead and sail now  
Just give in to the ocean  
The only way to tame your fear  
Is to feel her rocky motion  
  
Youre a long way from somewhere you call home  
Theres a place in your heart youre not alone  
  
All of the happiness you seek  
All of the joy for which you pray  
Is closer than you think  
Its just 100 tears away  
  
Go ahead and listen  
Just give into the voices  
You think youre backed into a corner  
But youve got so mahy choices  
You cant save all the hungry  
The lonely or the dying  
Sometimes we want to give up  
But fools like us keep trying  
  
Youre a long way from some place you feel safe  
Peace of mine comes from just one place  
  
All of the happiness you seek  
All of the joy for which you pray  
Is closer than you think  
Is just 100 tears away  
  
Whatever it is thatll make you feel good  
You can have if you want if you knew that you could  
You can have it all baby  
  
Youre a long way from somewhere you call home  
Theres a place in your heart youre not alone  
  
All of the happiness you seek  
All of the joy for which you pray  
Is closer than you think  
Its just 100 tears away
