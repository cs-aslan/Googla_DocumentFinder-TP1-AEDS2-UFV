Put up the barriers  
Shut down your senses  
Cover up with all of your pretenses  
See no evil  
Your eyes are blunted  
We are the hunters  
We are the hunted  
  
Place it in your memory  
Leave it in your past  
But dont forget  
  
Taking a tumble  
Im taking a dive  
Sometimes I stumble when my minds made up  
Reaction levels  
Seem strangely muted  
Ordinary acts of fun have been diluted  
  
Place it in your memory  
Leave it in your past  
But dont forget
