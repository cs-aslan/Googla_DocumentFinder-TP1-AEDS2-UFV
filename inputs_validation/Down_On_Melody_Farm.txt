Im tired of the noise and hurlyburly  
That fills the city late and early  
I long to hear the music of the usedtobe  
That mother nature made for me  
I want to wander where the skies are blue  
Where birds are singing all the long day through  
The music that I love to listen to  
Down on melody farm  
The cowbells tinkle in the early morn  
The bees are buzzin round a field of corn  
To tell me that another song is born  
Down on melody farm  
The lazy river is drifting along  
While daffodils dance on a hill  
And while its drifting it composes a song  
To a water lily  
The morning sings the golden melody  
The evening brings the moonlight symphony  
For all the world is wrapped in harmony  
Down on melody farm  
Im gonna pack my bag  
Im gonna clear my brain  
And then Im gonna buy a oneway ticket  
On the fastest choochoo train  
Im gonna try to find  
A little peace of mind  
I wanna leave the sound of rivets  
And the horns of taxis way behind  
I want to run through the fields of the newmown hay  
And at the close of day  
Let me stray  
Where I hear the organ playing  
Just a song at twighlight  
When the lights are low  
I wanna go  
I wanna go  
I wanna be a little country girl in calico  
The morning sings the golden melody  
The evening brings the moonlight symphony  
For all the world is wrapped in harmony  
Down on melody farm
