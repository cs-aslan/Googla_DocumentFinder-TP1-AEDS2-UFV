Pulling myself out of a dead sleep  
With the impression of the dream still fresh in my mind  
Before Im even awake the words the music were complete  
  
I woke up that mornin  
Feelin so rested and new  
My mind was clear of all the problems  
That been hasslin my head  
I couldnt quite understand why  
I felt so fine  
I felt so free  
So beyond it all  
As I turned towards the bed  
I understood as it all came clear  
  
As I turned towards the bed  
I understood as it all came clear  
  
I saw myself lyin there  
Didnt have a care  
Piece of mind was finally mine  
Now free to fly  
Into the blue sky  
Oh great spirit  
Fly away  
Oh great spirit  
Just fly  
Fly  
Oh fly away
