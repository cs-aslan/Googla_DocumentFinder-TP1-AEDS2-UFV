She floats like a swan  
Grace on the water  
Lips like sugar  
Lips like sugar  
  
Just when you think youve caught her  
She glides across the water  
She calls for you tonight  
To share this moonlight  
  
Shell flow down your river  
And ask him and shell give you  
  
Lips like sugar  
Sugar kisses  
Lips like sugar  
Sugar kisses  
  
She knows what she knows  
I know what shes thinking  
Sugar kisses  
Sugar kisses  
  
Just when you think shes yours  
Shes flown to other shores  
To laugh at how you break  
To melt into this lake  
  
Shell flow down your river  
And ask him and shell give you  
  
Lips like sugar  
Sugar kisses  
Lips like sugar  
Sugar kisses  
  
Shell be my mirror  
Reflect what I am  
A loser and a winner  
The King of Siam  
And my Siamese twin  
She knows what Im thinking  
  
  
Shell flow down your river  
And ask him and shell give you  
  
Lips like sugar  
Sugar kisses  
Lips like sugar  
Sugar kisses
