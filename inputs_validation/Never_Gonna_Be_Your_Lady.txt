I tried to say it politely  
I tried to give you a clue  
All your gold dont excite me  
That old trick just wont do  
  
Still you keep spending money  
But theres blood on the pearls  
Dont call me babe dont call me honey  
And think you rule my whole world  
  
Cause Im never gonna be your lady  
Im not the fool you think I am  
Im never gonna be your lady  
And you will never be my man  
Thats right  
  
Well listen  
I bet your wife dont know nothin  
About your sordid affairs  
Youve got greed mixed up with lovin  
And love mixed up with flair  
  
But Im never gonna be your lady  
Im not the fool you think I am  
Im never gonna be your lady  
  
All your funky business  
See you in jail  
You might buy the other but baby Im not for sale  
Im not for salethats right  
  
Cause Im never gonna be your lady  
Im not the fool you think I am  
Yeah Im never gonna be your lady  
And you will never be man  
  
No Im never gonna be your lady  
Im not the fool you think I am  
Oh Im never gonna be your lady  
And you will never be my man  
Never gonna be my man  
  
Now listen to me  
Thats right I told you  
Never gonna be my man  
Let me tell ya somethin boy  
You can keep tryin all you want to try  
But its never gonna work  
You dont have a thing that I need  
And you sure aint got a thing I want  
  
Oh no  
Never be your lady
