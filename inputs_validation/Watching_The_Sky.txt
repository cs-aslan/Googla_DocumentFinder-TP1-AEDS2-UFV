I sit here alone  
I sit here alone  
I look at the walls  
Look at the walls  
Look at the walls  
I look at the walls  
  
You shouldnt be out on your  
Own oh no not with  
A condition like that  
Oh no sir constant care  
A condition like that  
A condition so rare a penny  
For the guy a penny for your  
Thoughts one a penny  
Two a penny penny in  
Your pocket ding dong bell who  
Can tell Wild Man Fisher  
Got nothing on me  
  
I sit by the water  
I sit by the water  
Watch it go by  
Clouds going by  
Im watching the sky  
  
I left my luggage at the station  
Didnt know how to  
Say goodbye  
I walked away from all the fury  
And the madness and the fury  
And the madness and the fury  
And the madness  
  
I smile to myself  
I smile to myself  
  
Youre on the blind side Im on  
The other side now Im on the  
Outside looking for another side  
Upside down side Im still lucid I  
May be crazy but Im not stupid  
Try to get out the parking lots  
Full no matter no matter whats  
A man going to do one two  
Buckle my shoe zip my lip
