Old Red eyes is back  
Red from the night before the night before  
Walked into the wrong bar walked into a door  
  
Old Reds in town  
And sitting late at night he doesnt make a sound  
Just adding to the wrinkles on his deathly frown  
  
Theyre only red from all the tears that I shouldve shed  
Theyre only red from all the women that I couldve wed  
So when you look into these eyes I hope you realize  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
  
Listen up Old Red  
You never listened to a word the doctor said  
He told you if you drank another youd be dead  
  
Old Red Eyes is back  
His shoulders ache all over and his brain is sore  
He pours a drink and listens to his body thaw  
  
Theyre only red from all the thoughts unused inside my head  
Theyre only red from all the things I could have done instead  
So when you look into these eyes I hope you realize  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
  
Blue is a street without an end  
Red is the color of my hell  
Blue is a greeting from a friend  
Red is the color of farewell  
  
Old Red he died  
And every single landlord in the district cried  
An empty bottle of whiskey laying by his side  
A lazy little tear running from each eye  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue
