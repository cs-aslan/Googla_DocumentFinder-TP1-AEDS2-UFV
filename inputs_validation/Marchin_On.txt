For those days we felt like a mistake  
Those times when loves what you hate  
Somehow  
We keep marchin on  
  
For those nights when I couldnt be there  
Ive made it harder to know that you know  
That somehow  
Well keep movin on  
  
Theres so many wars we fought  
Theres so many things were not  
But with what we have  
I promise you that  
Were marchin on  
Were marchin on  
Were marchin on  
  
For all of the plans we made  
There isnt a flag Id wave  
Dont care where weve been  
Id sink us to swim  
Were marchin on  
Were marchin on  
Were marchin on  
  
For those doubts that swirl all around us  
For those lives that tear at the seams  
We know  
Were not what weve seen  
  
Oh  
For this dance we move with each other  
There aint no other step  
Than one foot  
Right in front of the other  
Oh  
  
Theres so many wars we fought  
Theres so many things were not  
But with what we have  
I promise you that  
Were marchin on  
Were marchin on  
Were marchin on  
  
For all of the plans we made  
There isnt a flag Id wave  
Dont care where weve been  
Id sink us to swim  
Were marchin on  
Were marchin on  
Were marchin on  
  
Right right right right left  
Right right right right left  
Right right right marchin on  
  
Well have the days we break  
And well have the scars to prove it  
Well have the bombs that we saved  
But well have the heart  
Not to lose it  
  
For all of the times weve stopped  
For all of the things Im not  
  
Oh  
You put one foot in front of the other  
Weve move like we aint got no other  
We go where we go were marchin on  
Marchin on  
  
Theres so many wars we fought  
Theres so many things were not  
But with what we have  
I promise you that  
Were marchin on  
Were marchin on  
were marchin on  
Right right right right left  
Right right right right left  
Right right right right  
Marchin on  
Marchin on  
Right right right right left  
Right right right right left  
Right right right right  
Marchin on  
Marchin on
