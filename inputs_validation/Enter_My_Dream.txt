Enter my dream baby  
Enter my dream  
  
Jung river wont you stop for me awhile  
Hold me like a sleepy child  
And take me where Im bound to be  
  
Im walking on the wings of makebelieve  
Im living out the fantasy  
That I know well  
Ive been visiting there all my life  
  
Cause you see  
  
Chorus  
Happiness finds me sleeping  
There I know I go beyond reality  
Itll be effortless and easy  
Somebody take me there  
  
Im living in a dream baby  
Living in a dream  
  
Ill play for you  
Youll play a tune for me  
A masterpiece of harmony  
That everybody here can do  
  
A hundred writers pass the words along  
And suddenly weve made a song  
That sounds sweet and clear  
Something every dreamer can hear  
  
And we sing  
  
Chorus  
  
Im livin in a  
  
Enter my dream  
  
Youre waiting for the wind to start to rise  
Well take a look and close your eyes  
Away to a place every dreamer can share  
  
And thats where  
Happiness finds us sleeping  
There I know I go beyond reality  
Itll be effortless and easy  
Somebody take me there  
Somebody take me where  
Well be living in a dream baby  
Enter my dream
