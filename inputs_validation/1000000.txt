Kind of hard  
Hard to see  
When you crawl  
On your hands and your knees  
  
With your face  
In the trough  
Wait your turn  
While they finish you off  
  
Dont know when it started  
Dont know how  
Should have found out  
Should have happened by now  
  
Got these lines  
On my face  
After all this time  
And i still havent found my place  
  
I jump from every rooftop  
So high so far to fall  
I feel a million miles away  
I dont feel any thing at all  
  
I wake up  
On the floor  
Start it up again  
Like it matters anymore  
  
I dont know  
If it does  
Is this really all  
That there ever was  
  
Put the gun  
In my mouth  
Close your eyes  
Blow my fucking brains out  
  
Pretty patterns  
On the floor  
Thats enough for you  
But i still need more  
  
I jump from every rooftop  
So high so far to fall  
I feel a million miles away  
I dont feel any thing at all
