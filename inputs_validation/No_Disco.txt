I saw you in the picture  
I saw you play the part  
This aint no disco  
Theres a thousand watts in you  
You take this too far  
This aint no disco  
  
Sometimes when I wonder if youre taking a chance  
This aint no disco  
And you know how to dance  
  
Move me disco  
Baby dont you let go  
This aint no disco  
  
Part one  
Act one  
Everyone pretend  
This aint no disco  
This is more a story  
And were reaching the end  
This aint no disco  
  
Always makes me happy when youre taking a chance  
This aint no disco  
And you know how to dance  
  
Move me disco  
Baby dont you let go  
This aint no disco
