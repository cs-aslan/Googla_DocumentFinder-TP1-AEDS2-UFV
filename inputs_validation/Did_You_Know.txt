Did you know  
All my reserve was just pretend  
Did you know  
I was only posin as your friend  
Did you know  
Did my eyes play on your face too long  
Did they say how much I needed you  
Did the words I try to say in jest  
Seem to come out soundin much too true  
Did you know  
Could you see through my disguise  
Did you know  
Or does my love come as a surprise  
Did you know  
I cant believe you havent guessed  
They was much too much coincidence  
All those times we met by chance  
All where my unpurpose accidents  
Did you know  
Doesnt matter anyway  
Did you know  
Someone else has said the things  
I want to say  
So Ill go I never should have waited round  
In hopes that you would finally see  
But in case I get a second chance  
Now you know just what you mean to me  
Did you know
