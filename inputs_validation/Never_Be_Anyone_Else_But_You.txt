Therell never be anyone else but you for me  
Never ever be just couldnt be  
Anyone else but you  
  
If I could take my pick of all the girls  
Ive ever known  
Then Id come and pick you out to be my very own  
  
Therell never be anyone else but you for me  
Never ever be just couldnt be  
Anyone else but you  
  
I never will forget the way you kissed me  
And when were not together I wonder if you miss me  
Cause I hope and I pray the day will come  
When you belong to me then I am gonna prove to you  
How true my love can be  
  
I never will forget the way you kissed me  
And when were not together I wonder if you miss me  
cause I hope and I pray the day will come  
When youll belong to me  
Cause then Im gonna prove to you
