Tosspint rises early  
Sprung from a nightmares claw  
Thrice crows the dawn cock  
The mist is on the moor  
Tosspint cries from croaking gills  
Thank God Im not forsaken  
From the hellish depths of sleep  
At last I am awakened  
Tosspint flushed his kidneys  
Rained a golden shower  
Pleased to piss a good pot full  
He shat upon the hour  
Tosspint filled his belly  
With tripe and oxs tongue  
Sucking pig stuffed with figs  
Into his guts he flung  
Full belly and the dance is merry  
Where hunger reigns no strength obtains  
The wheel spins the gurdy hums  
Ring the bells and beat the drum  
Tosspint drinks lustily  
And pees against the sun  
All around the hoary oak  
The laughing maidens run  
Tosspint warms his codpiece  
To the flour adds the yeast  
In the field by Tanners Mill  
He plays to twobacked beast  
Twist the spigot close the hole  
Stoke the fire and blow the coal  
The wheel spins the gurdy hums  
Ring the bells and beat the drum  
Incomprehensible  
Where hunger reigns no strength obtains  
The wheel spins the gurdy hums  
Ring the bells and beat the drum  
Tosspint fell foul of dogma  
And slipped into a schism  
The trial was quick the sky grew dark  
They led him from the prison  
Tied him to a stake of oak  
Lit a fire of wood and coke  
The crowd sang out His bacons smoked  
The bells rang out Tosspints croaked  
Tosspint under flaming sky  
Walks through the fires of Hell  
Where bestial demons threw the damned  
Screaming as they fell  
Into the pits of burning coals  
Tosspint throws up his last bowl  
Mingled with the soup  
His soul  
Tosspint rises early  
Sprung from a nightmares claw  
Thrice crows the dawn cock  
The mist is on the moor  
Twist the spigot close the hole  
Stoke the fire and blow the coal  
The wheel spins the gurdy hums  
Ring the bells and beat the drum
