Baby the love we used to share  
Has faded day by day  
And now you want to leave me  
So youre lookin for away  
And if you see a tear in my eye  
Its not for you I cry  
  
Dont you know I tried to make our love  
Like every love should be  
You say it aint enough  
So youre walking out on me  
But if you cant find just what you want  
Dont you come runnin back to me  
  
Baby I know you think Im at home  
Cryin the blues  
But remember darlin  
Somebody else will want what you couldnt use  
Oh yeah what you couldnt use  
  
Aint no sad song  
Since youve been gone  
Aint no sad song  
Since youve been gone  
You made me so very very happy boy  
But if you dont want to be mine  
  
Hey when will I stop lovin you  
Oh baby I dont know I dont know  
All my friends give me advice  
They say hang on girl  
Ooh but I want him  
Hang on girl  
I dont need him  
  
The clock didnt stop ticking  
Cause you let me be  
Time will let nobody  
Take your love from me  
  
You made me so very very happy boy  
But if you dont want to be mine  
I know you want to be  
With someone for yourself  
But I know you dont want me  
To be with no one else  
  
Aint no sad song  
Since youve been gone  
Aint no sad song  
Since youve been gone  
Aint no sad song  
Since youve been gone
