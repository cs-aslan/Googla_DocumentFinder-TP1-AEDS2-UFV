I only knew you for a while  
I never saw your smile  
Till it was time to go  
Time to go away time to go away  
Sometimes its hard to recognise  
Love comes as a surprise  
And its too late  
Its just too late to stay  
Too late to stay  
  
Chorus  
Well always be together  
However far it seems  
Love never ends  
Well always be together  
Together in electric dreams  
  
Because the friendship that you gave  
Has taught me to be brave  
No matter where I go Ill never find a better prize  
Find a better prize  
Though youre miles and miles away  
I see you every day  
I dont have to try  
I just close my eyes  
I close my eyes  
  
Chorus
