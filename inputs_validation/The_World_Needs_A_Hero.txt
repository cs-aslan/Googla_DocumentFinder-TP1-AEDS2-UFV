An Iron fist quietly sits inside the Velvet Glove  
Take control untouchable just like God above  
I cant escape wrapped in red tape what will become of me  
If I object then I defect my country tis of thee  
  
The White House is calling  
Tell them Ill call them back  
Just tell them anything  
Yeah get them off my back  
  
The world needs a hero  
  
Not that I would ever lie but I have no choice  
Words I say heard today are not mine just my voice  
  
NATO is on line 1  
They want to talk to me  
Tell them that Im not in  
Tell them that Im not free  
  
The world needs a hero  
  
Phantom rule the hidden jewel whos really in control  
On puppet strings a nation swings undermined by moles  
  
The UN is on hold  
Tell them Ill call them back  
Yeah tell them anything  
Just get them off my back  
  
The world needs a hero  
  
Dave the White House is calling  
They want to talk to me  
Tell them that I cant be bought  
Tell them that Im not free  
  
The world needs a hero
