I cant go on this way forever  
Closing my eyes and just imagining  
Im loving you  
When im close to you it feels so right  
Cant sleep at night  
But if i try to stay away cant even  
Make it through the day  
No longer care if it is wrong or right  
I wanna love you baby through the night  
Till the morning light  
Cant stop imagining the tenderness of your caress  
Couldnt stop if i wanted to  
Theres nothing left for me to do  
  
Please love me  
Just look into my eyes  
I know you want me  
Say what you feel inside  
Dont be afraid to try  
Im yours if you say  
Please love me  
If its so hard to say then baby touch me  
I cant take it anymore  
Im dizzy with your love  
Im yours if you say baby stay  
  
You drive me crazy when you look at me  
Im nearly blinded by my fantasy  
Youre making love to me  
If i cant have you  
Dont know what ill do  
Im so in love with you  
Ill play any game you wanna play  
But i just wanna hear you say  
  
Please love me just look into my eyes  
I know you want me  
Say what you feel inside  
Dont be afraid to try  
Im yours if you say  
Please love me if its so hard to say  
Then baby touch me  
I cant take it anymore  
Im dizzy with your love  
Im yours if you say baby stay  
Im yours if you say baby stay
