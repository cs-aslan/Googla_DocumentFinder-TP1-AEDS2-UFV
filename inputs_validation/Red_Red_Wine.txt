Red red wine goes to my head  
Makes me forget that I still need her so  
  
Red red wine its up to you  
All I can do Ive done  
Memories wont go memories wont go  
  
Life is fine every time  
Thoughts of you leave my head  
I was wrong now I find  
Just one thing makes me forget  
  
Red red wine stay close to me  
Dont let me be alone  
Its tearing apart my blue heart  
  
Red red wine you make me feel so fine  
You keep me rockin all of the time  
Red red wine you make me feel so grand  
I feel a million dollar when youre just in my hand  
Red red wine you make me feel so sad  
Any time I see you go it make me feel bad  
Red red wine you make me feel so fine  
Monkey back and ease up on the sweet deadline  
  
Red red wine you give me holy pahzing  
Holy pahzing you make me do my own thing  
Red red wine you give me not awful love  
Your kind of lovin like a blessing from above  
Red red wine I loved you right from the start  
Right from the start and with all of my heart  
Red red wine in an eighties style  
Red red wine in a modern beat style  
Yeah  
  
Give me a little time let me clear out my mind  
Give me a little time let me clear out my mind  
Give me red wine the kind make me feel fine  
You make me feel fine all of the time  
Red red wine you make me feel so fine  
Monkey back and ease up on the sweet deadline  
The line broke the money get choked  
Bunbah ganjapani little rubber boat  
Red red wine Im gonna hold on to you  
Hold on to you cause I know you love truth  
Red red wine Im gonna love you till I die  
Love you till I die and thats no lie  
Red red wine cant get your off my mind  
Wherever you may be Ill surely find  
Ill surely find Make no fuss just leave us
