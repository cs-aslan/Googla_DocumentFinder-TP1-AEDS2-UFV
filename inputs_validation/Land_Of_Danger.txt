Oh baby  this is the land of danger each and every home a battlefield  
Oh baby  this is the throat of a stranger searching for the blood  
Thats now congealed  
Oh baby  this is a thick muddy mystery tearing at the pages of our past  
Oh baby  this is the straight path of history human motion  land and  
Ocean  
Try to run try to hide  
Its been a long long long long long long long time  
Its been a long long long long long time  
Oh baby  this is the fresh flesh of anger calling out for action in the  
Streets  
Oh baby  this is a slow running canker opened up by victories and defeats  
Oh baby  this is the night of the dancer dancing on a time bomb in my
head  
Oh baby  this is the ultimate cancer human notion  fear in motion  
Try to run try to hide  
Its been a long long long long long long long time  
Its been a long long long long long time  
Dont tell me everythings gonna work out anymore  
Dont tell me everythings gonna work out anymore  
Of danger of danger of danger of danger  
Dont tell me everythings gonna work out
