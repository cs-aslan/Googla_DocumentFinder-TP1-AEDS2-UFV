Chorus  
Im the man who murdered love  
Yeah What do you think to that  
Im the man who murdered love  
Yeah What do you think to that  
  
He was begging on his bended knee  
For me to put him from his misery  
He hadnt worked at all this century  
Said I do a job for all humanity  
  
Chorus  
  
I put a bullet in his sugar head  
He thanked me kindly then he lay down dead  
Phony roses blossomed where he bled  
Then all the cheering angels shook my hand and said  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh Its the middle of the song  
  
Oh Yeah Oh Yeah  
Im guilty Im guilty  
Im guilty Yeah  
And then I turned and said  
  
Therell be more pain from broken hearts  
And no more lovers to be torn apart  
Before you throw me in your dungeon dark  
You ougtta film me putting statues up in every park  
  
Chorus  
  
So dear public Im here to confess  
That Im the one who freed us from this mess  
Love wont be calling at your address  
Cause youve never had youll never miss I guess  
  
Chorus  
  
If you never ever use it  
You know youre gonna lose it  
If you never ever kiss it  
Howre you ever gonna miss it  
  
Chorus
