Hey I see you trying to tell them all about me  
Saying that Im just a wannabe well guess what  
I dont need nobody else to help me on my way Im fine  
  
Hey hey I hear youve started rumours bout my family  
Telling everybody that Im in it for the money  
Id give it all away before Id let your words get through alright  
  
Cos somebody out there somebody somewhere loves me for me and nobody else
will  
Stop me from dreaming stop me from believing  
Im on my own tonight  
  
Chorus  
And whatever comes whatever goes  
Whatever happens Ill be fine  
I am strong the world is mine  
And I suppose that if the doors close  
Ill pick up my strength and bash it down and build it up again up again  
  
You I know youre trying to get me angry and mad  
I dont care Im not gonna resort to being nasty  
I dont need nobody else to help me on my way Im fine  
  
You you I betcha any money that youre lonely  
Making me feel worse than yourself yourself yoursefl  
Id give it all away before Id let your words get through alright  
  
Cos somebody out there somebody somewhere loves me for me and nobody else
will  
Stop me from dreaming stop me from believing  
Im on my own tonight  
  
Chorus  
And whatever comes whatever goes  
Whatever happens Ill be fine  
I am strong the world is mine  
And I suppose that if the doors close  
Ill pick up my strength and bash it down and build it up again up again  
  
You can say whatever cos whatever comes Ill beat ya baby  
You can say whatever cos whatever comes Ill shine  
  
Chorus  
And whatever comes whatever goes  
Whatever happens Ill be fine  
I am strong the world is mine  
And I suppose that if the doors close  
Ill pick up my strength and bash it down and build it up again up again
