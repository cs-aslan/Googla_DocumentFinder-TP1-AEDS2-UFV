You dont look at me no more and I dont  
look at you  
Well that all right pretty baby cuz Im just  
looking for something to do  
Youre telling me that you dont feel the  
same  
Well thats all right pretty baby cuz I dont  
mind driving myself insane sometimes  
I dont mind at all and then again  
sometimes baby  
I feel like my whole worlds gonna fall apart  
When you tell me you dont feel the same  
but thats all right pretty baby cuz I dont  
mind being insane  
Sometimes  
You dont talk to me no more and I dont  
talk to you  
Well thats all right pretty baby cuz Im just  
looking for something to prove  
Youre telling me that you dont feel the  
same  
Well thats all right pretty baby cuz I dont  
mind driving myself insane sometimes  
I dont mind at all and then again  
sometimes baby  
I feel like my whole worlds gonna fall apart  
When you tell me that you dont feel the  
same but thats all right pretty baby cuz  
I dont mind being insane  
Sometimes
