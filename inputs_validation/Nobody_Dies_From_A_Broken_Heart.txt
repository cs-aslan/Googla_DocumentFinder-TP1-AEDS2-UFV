Nobody told me  
It could ever hurt so bad  
Im having to learn the hard way  
Now that youre gone  
Its hurting me more  
Than any pain Ive ever had  
And I dont know how I can go on  
  
Chorus  
Nobody dies from a broken heart  
Give it time and your dreams will start again  
I know love can tear you apart  
But nobody dies from a broken heart  
  
Everyone tells me  
Its gonna take a little time  
Before you find your heartaches  
Slipping away  
I know you mean well  
And theyre just trying to ease my mind  
But it doesnt help to hear them say  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres nothing anybodys gonna say  
Thatll talk me out of feeling this way  
Theres nothing anybody else can do  
To take away my love for you  
  
I know they mean well  
And theyre just trying to ease my mind  
It doesnt help them to hear them say  
  
Chorus
