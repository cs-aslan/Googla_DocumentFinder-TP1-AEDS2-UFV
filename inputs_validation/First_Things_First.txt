Last night I had a blind date  
A situation that I usually hate  
I rang the bell she opened the door  
Wearin a smile and not much more  
I said You think you better get dressed for dinner  
She said Im dressed for dessert Honey  
First Things First First Things First  
  
After dinner and the wine is gone  
Its back at her place with the tv on  
I said Its gettin late I should be gettin home  
She said You know I really hate to sleep alone  
Maybe its best that we get some rest   
While she unbuttoned my shirt she said  
First Things First First Things First  
  
All night long I went along with her philosophy  
I must agree she got to me with her priority  
Waking up I never felt to good  
Im seein things I never thought I would  
Last night the lady made a change in me  
And Im seeing things a little differently  
So aint gonna hurry no  
  
Aint gonna worry why they wonder why were late for work  
Well say First Things First  
Oh baby First Things First  
Yeah First Things First  
First Things First
