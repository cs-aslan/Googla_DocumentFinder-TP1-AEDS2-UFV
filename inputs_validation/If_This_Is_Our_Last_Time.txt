Even though the night is early theres a fire that whispers hurry  
Darling please turn off the lights and lock the door  
Come lay down here beside me tell me that Im soft and pretty  
And love me like you never have before  
  
If this is our last time make it last me for a lifetime  
Dont hold back the love you feel inside why should passion be ashamed  
If this is our last time make it last me for a lifetime  
Leave me with enough of sunshine to carry me through the rain  
  
In the morning youll be leaving but tonight therell be no grieving  
Ill have lots of time to cry when youre gone  
Lets not waste one precious moment take all of me Im still your woman  
And love me up until the break of dawn  
  
If this is our last time
