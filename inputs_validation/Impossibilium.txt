I love you even when I dont even know Im doing it  
And dismiss it out of hand cause I dont even know Im doing it but your  
Finger starts to wiggle and landscapes emerge  
Can you spare some change dear weve only got three hundred feet to go  
  
Roses are worth more dried than alive such a thing to say  
O how I adore you when you reinvent a rose cliche can you spare  
Some change dear weve only got three hundred feet to go  
And with impossibilium for a payload we lift the rocket out of the  
Pocket nothing can stop it  
  
Roses are difficult everywhere you must promise me youll stay  
These long stems are freakish if anything but we can cut em  
Down for the vase can you spare some change dear  
Weve only got three hundred feet to go and with impossibilium for a Payload  
We lift the rocket out of the pocket nothing can stop it we can only watch it
