Lets do this for each other  
Lets do this for truth  
I give for you you give for me 2X  
Let me take you somewhere somewhere I cannot explain  
Let me take you I wanna take you somewhere I cannot explain  
Im stumbling right in front of you now  
I wont refrain from guiding you there  
  
Normal is not so  
Normal is not so far  
  
Was it just a dream  
Or something much more  
We are not alone  
Since you agreed to follow  
Its all in my head  
If you want you can look inside  
Theres nothing but red  
And the mess Ive been  
Its all in the way  
I say what I dont mean and mean what I dont  
I need to speak of you and  
What is real what is real 4X  
  
They will never understand  
What eats at our insides  
They will never understand  
What eats at our insides  
  
Its all in my head  
If you want you can look inside  
Theres nothing but red  
And the mess Ive been  
Its all in the way  
I say what I dont mean and mean what I dont  
I need to speak of you
