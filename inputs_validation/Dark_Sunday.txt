Youre like poison  
You smile at me  
Talk of love  
He will forgive me  
If I confess  
Your dark Sunday  
You lied to me  
And so I  
Replaced God  
With a picture of my car  
I dont like this  
I dont like this  
Im on the E kick  
So heavens in my head  
Im in Outland  
Shame on me  
I want pictures  
People come people go  
Dyou think God  
Will forgive me soon  
You wont like this  
You wont like this  
Rip it up  
Rip it into pieces  
Rip it up  
Rip it for good  
Touch me touch me  
He wont like this  
He wont like this  
He wont touch me  
I cant dance and I cant sing  
Im not stone shape  
But time runs out  
I dont like this  
All I see is cold and hard  
All I can do now  
Is break the word  
I dont like this  
I dont like this  
He will love me  
Well thank him  
For nothing  
I need that like  
I need a disease  
So pray for me  
I dont mind  
I dont care  
Ive found love  
Its an American machine  
I dont like this  
I dont like this
