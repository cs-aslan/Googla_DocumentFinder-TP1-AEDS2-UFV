Monday morning  
  
The sun has risen just above the trees  
The birds are singing its just like a dream  
What a perfect morning itcould have been  
Salems in the kitchen and thats sin  
Eggs for three and a little tea  
Mixed with the graveyard dirt from yesterday  
  
Anybody cating Salems A la carte today  
Should be taken ill and waste away  
  
Salem thinking to himself  
You used to be so beautiful but now youre gonna die  
You used to be so beautiful but now youre gonna die  
Die both of you are gonna die  
Die die both of you are gonna die die die  
  
Salems walking up the stairs to the second floor  
Silver tray in handknocking at the door  
  
Salem thinking to himself  
You used to be so beautiful but now youre gonna die  
You used to be so beautiful but now youre gonna die  
Die both of youare gonna die  
Die die both of youare gonna die diedie  
  
In a fever sick as Hell  
Davids got a snake biteand all is well  
Salem thinks to himself  
  
One down two to go Oh Madame hes got the flu  
One down two to go Oh Madame hes got the flu  
  
The problem is that Sarahs morning sick again  
That pregnant woman always something wrong  
  
You used to be so beautiful but now youre gonna die  
You used to be so beautiful but now youre gonna die  
DieSarah die Sarah die  
Die dieSarah die Sarah die
