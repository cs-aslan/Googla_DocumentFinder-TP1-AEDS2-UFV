Dominic Dominic why are you stallin  
Dont you hear love callin to you  
Moo moo move your little foot do  
  
Dominic Dominic pick one of them ticker  
Theres acres and acres to choose  
Oh oh only a fool would refuse  
  
I I if I had your trouble  
Life would be double good sweet  
Thered be no grass growin under my feet  
  
Listen Dominic Dominic when will you hunger  
You aint gettin younger my friend  
Love love love em all right to the end  
  
I I I cant understand you leavin them beauties forlorn  
Its time to take the old bull by the horn  
Come on Dominic Dominic theyre itchin and twitchin  
Better start pickin some woo  
Moo moo move your little foot do
