I left you last night on the left coast  
Im writin you a letter right now  
The things that you do are rendering you  
Something I cant live without  
Maybe maybe Ive got a pulse now  
Maybe my hearts on fire  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
Left you last night on the left side  
The land of the free to be burned  
Well the heat of your touch is makin it such  
That Ive forgotten everything Ive learned  
Maybe maybe Ive got a problem  
Maybe my hearts a liar  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
Yeah a bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
And I may be a bird in a cage  
But it least its your cage  
And I may be a bird in a cage  
But it least its your cage  
Left you last night on the left half  
Of the bed the half that used to be mine  
The way that you sleep is the image Ill keep  
Always on the edge of my mind  
Maybe maybe Ive got a reason  
For livin even though Im so tired  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
Yeah a bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
And I may be a bird in a cage  
But it least its your cage  
And I may be a bird in a cage  
But it least its your cage  
Maybe maybe you are the only  
One my hearts desired  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire
