Im here if you see me  
Shes got a song in her head and shell sing to me  
Shes got a laugh that reminds me of why shes in love with me  
Shed never let show she was lonely in case it had frightened me  
She was carpet and stone independent alone  
But this love always shone around me every time oh  
  
Waltz away dreaming till your day begins again  
Free from the seasons and this state Im in  
And oh I cant hold it all under one love  
It was so long ago when we danced in the streets  
Now you fly like an eagle above while I waltz away anyway  
And Im waltzing my days away  
Searching for this woman I love  
  
Im here if you see me  
She had a history joy and pain and she chose to leave  
She had a thousand and one photographs that you would not believe  
Shell come to you in disguise shes there in you childrens eyes  
Still our mother shes still your wife  
So let her  
  
Waltz away dreaming till your day begins again oh yeah  
Free from the reasons and this state Im in  
And ohtrust me I cant hold it all  
she aint going anywhere under one love  
trust me she told me when youre ready shell be there  
It was so long ago no dont let go of her  
When we kissed in the streets  
Now you fly like an eagle above while I waltz away anyway  
Then Im waltzing my days away  
Searching for this woman I love  
  
and the moment you see me I will live in your life  
we will walk through my garden I will see through you eyes  
Waltzing my days away and the moment  
I was in despair you see me till she found me there I will live  
Every grown man cries in your life with his mothers eyes  
we will walk when youre ready too through my garden  
Shell come back to you I will see through your eyes  
Waltzing my days away and the moment shes waiting  
you see me I will live in your life  
Waltzing my days we will walk shes waiting  
through my garden I will father see through your eyes  
Shes waiting and the moment you see me
