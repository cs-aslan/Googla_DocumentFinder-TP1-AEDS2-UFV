I wanted so badly  
Somebody other than me  
Staring back at me  
But you were gone  
  
I wanted to see you walking backwards  
And get the sensation of you coming home  
I wanted to see you walking away from me  
Without the sensation of you leaving me alone  
  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
I cant please myself  
  
I wanted the ocean to cover over me  
I wanna sink slowly without getting wet  
Maybe someday I wont be so lonely  
And Ill walk on water every chance I get  
  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
I cant please myself  
  
So when are you coming home  
Sweet angel  
You leaving me alone  
All alone  
Well if Im drowning darling youll come down this way on your own  
  
I wish I was traveling on a freeway  
Beneath this graveyard western sky  
Im gonna set fire to this city  
And out into the desert  
were gonna ride  
  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
I cant please myself
