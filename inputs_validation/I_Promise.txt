I wont run away no more I promise  
Even when I get bored I promise  
Even when you lock me out I promise  
I say my prayers every night I promise  
I dont wish that Im strict I promise  
The tantrums and the chilling chats I promise  
Even when the ship is wrecked I promise  
Tie me to the rotten deck I promise  
I wont fool around no more I promise  
Even when I get bored I promise  
Even when you lock me out I promise  
I say my prayers every night I promise  
I wont fool around no more I promise
