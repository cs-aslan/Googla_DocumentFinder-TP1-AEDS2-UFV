I love you like I want you  
And I kiss you like I need you  
Every night  
Ill draw you close to me  
Ill tell you words of comfort  
Its my delight  
Darling Ive grown to love you  
More every day  
And Ive got a song to sing  
Each lonely night oh yeah oh yeah  
Stronger than the north winds  
Higher than the mountains  
Thats my love for you  
And I will never hurt you  
Nor will I forsake you  
Darling be true  
Its only a matter of time oh yeah  
Then all of my dreams will come true  
In every way oh yeah oh yeah  
Stronger than the north winds  
Higher than the mountains  
Thats my love for you  
And I will never hurt you  
Nor will I forsake you  
Darling be true  
Its only a matter of time oh yeah  
Then all of my dreams will come true  
In every way oh yeah oh yeah
