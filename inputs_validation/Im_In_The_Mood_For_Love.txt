Im in the mood for love  
Simply because youre near me  
Funny but when youre near me  
Im in the mood for love  
  
Heaven is in your eyes  
Bright as the stars were under  
Oh is it any wonder  
Im in the mood for love  
  
Why stop to think of whether  
This little dream might fade  
Lets put our hearts together  
Now we are one Im not afraid  
  
If theres a cloud above  
If it should rain well let it  
But for tonight forget it  
Im in the mood for love  
  
Why stop to think of whether  
This little dream might fade  
Lets put our hearts together  
Now we are one Im not afraid  
  
If theres a cloud above  
If it should rain well let it  
But for tonight forget it  
Im in the mood for love
