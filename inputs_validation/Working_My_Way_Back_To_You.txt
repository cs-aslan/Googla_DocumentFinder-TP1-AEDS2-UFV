Working my way back to you babe  
With a burnin love inside  
Yeah Im workin my way back to you babe  
And the happiness that died  
I let it get away  
Been payin every day  
  
When you were so in love with me  
I played around like I was free  
Thought I could have my cake and eat it too  
But how I cried over losin you  
See me cryin now but I aint about to go  
Livin my life without you  
For every day I made you cry  
Im payin girl til the day that I die  
  
I used to love to make you cry  
It made me feel like a man inside  
But if Id been a man in reality  
Youd still be here babe lovin me  
Now the nights are long and lonely  
And I aint through strugglin I just miss you so  
And youre too proud you wont give in  
But when I think about all I can win  
  
Working my way back to you babe  
With a burnin love inside  
Yeah Im workin my way back to you babe  
And the happiness that died oh how I cried
