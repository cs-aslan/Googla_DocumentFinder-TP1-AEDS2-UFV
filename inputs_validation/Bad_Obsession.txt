I cant stop thinkin  
Thinking bout sinkin  
Sinkin down into my bed  
I call my mother  
Shes just a cunt now  
She said Im sick in the head  
She said you aint special  
So who you foolin  
Dont try ta give me a line  
But I cant stop thinkin bout  
Seein ya one more time  
Oh no  
But I already left you  
And youre better off left behind  
  
Its a bad obsession  
Its always messin  
Its always messin my mind  
Its a bad obsession  
Its always messin  
Its always messin my mind  
  
Too bad youre fucked up  
  
I used to be wasted  
Always tried to take it  
Take it down into my vein  
I call the doctor  
Hes just another  
He said Im sick in the brain  
He said you aint special  
So who you foolin  
Dont try ta give me a line  
But I cant stop thinkin bout  
Doin it one more time  
Oh no  
But I already left you  
And youre better off left behind  
Oh yeah
