You got me excited baby  
Ooh ooh  
How come the one  
You got aint never

This crazy good  
But I dont believe you

About all that  
So I keep coming back  
I cant help myself  
  
You make it harder for me  
Dont wanna get up and leave  
When you dont put  
That thing on girl  
You know just what I need  
And I know  
That I should leave her alone  
Im in a fatal attraction  
Fatal attraction

We do it over and over  
Over again

Everything for me  
To leave you alone  
Cause the vision

Wanna make your body  
Be calling me

Like I aint need you before  
But that was before
