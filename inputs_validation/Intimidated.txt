Ooh I see you over there  
Dont be shy  
Come here um  
  
You got that thing that I cant deny  
So move it over here oh yeah  
Youre giving signs that I recognize  
Say what you want oh yeah  
  
Baby theres something about you  
Show me that nothing can hold you down  
Cause I I must confess  
Im feeling you right now  
  
Chorus  
So baby take your chance  
And show your confidence  
Oh baby tell me who you are  
You make my body scream  
You make me believe  
that youre what Im waiting for  
Dont you be intimidated  
  
Just be a man  
Show me where you stand  
Positively oh yeah  
I dont come off shy if you want me back  
And if my EGOs no dont give up to fast  
  
Baby theres something about you  
Show me that nothing can hold you down  
Cause I I must confess  
Im feeling you right now  
  
Chorus  
  
BRITNEY  
BRITNEY  
  
It doesnt matter boo  
As long as youre diggin me  
So much we can be  
Yes its true  
But first you gotta make the move  
For me to see what I want with you  
  
Chorus x2
