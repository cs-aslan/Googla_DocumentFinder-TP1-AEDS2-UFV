Theres a sadness in your singing I have never heard before  
Theres a dying in your living that exists from shore to shore  
Theres a coward in your character that I have never seen  
America what happened to the promise and the dream  
The promise was that men could live and worship as they please  
The dream was for the huddled masses yearning to breathe free  
We closed so many doors and banned the prayers on many scenes  
America what happened to the promise and the dream  
Theres a numbness in your feeling for the disadvantaged poor  
Theres a weakness in your strength because your leaders are unsure  
There are shadows in the light that once was freedoms brightest beam  
America what happened to the promise and the dream  
The promise was that men could live and worship as they please  
The dream was for the huddled masses yearning to breathe free  
You closed so many doors and banned the prayer on many scenes  
America what happened to the promise and the dream  
Theres a hating in your loving for the permanence of vows  
Tomorrow doesnt matter its all for the here and now  
Your most important word called love is now a dirty thing  
America what happened to the promise and the dream  
The promise was that men could live and worship as they please  
The dream was for the huddled masses yearning to breathe free  
We closed so many doors and banned the prayers on many scenes  
America what happened to the promise and the dream
