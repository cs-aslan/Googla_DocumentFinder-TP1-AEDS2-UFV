The little things you say and do  
Make me want to be with you  
Rave on its a crazy feeling and  
I know its got me reeling  
When you say I love you rave on  
The way you dance and hold me tight  
The way you kiss and say goodnight  
Rave on its a crazy feeling and  
I know its got me reeling  
When you say I love you rave on  
Well rave on its a crazy feeling  
And I know its got me reeling  
Im so glad that youre revealing your love for me  
Rave on rave on and tell me  
Tell me not to be lonely  
Tell me you love me only  
Rave on to me
