Theres a little ditty theyre singin in the city  
Especially when theyve been on the gin or the beer  
If youve got the patience your own imaginations will tell you just exactly
what you want to hear  
Oom pah pah oom pah pah thats how it goes  
Oom pah pah oom pah pah everyone knows  
And they all suppose what they want to suppose when they hear oom pah pah  
  
Mr Percy Snodgrass would often have the odd glass  
But never when he thought anybody could see  
Secretly hed buy it and drink it on the quiet  
And dream he was an Earl with a girl on his knee  
Oom pah pah oom pah pah thats how it goes  
Oom pah pah oom pah pah everyone knows  
What is the cause of his red shiny nose  
Could it be oom pah pah  
  
Pretty little Sally goes walking down the alley  
Displays her pretty ankles to all of the men  
They could see her garters but not for free and gratis  
An inch or two and then she knows when to say when  
Oom pah pah oom pah pah thats how it goes  
Oom pah pah oom pah pah everyone knows  
Whether its hidden or whether it shows  
Its the same oom pah pah  
  
She was from the country but now shes up a gumtree  
She let a fellow beat her and lead her along  
Whats the use of cryin she made her bed to lie in  
Shes glad to bring a coin in and join in this song  
Oom pah pah oom pah pah thats how it goes  
Oom pah pah oom pah pah everyone knows  
She is no longer the same blushing rose  
Ever since oom pah pah  
  
Oom pah pah oom pah pah thats how it goes  
Oom pah pah oom pah pah everyone knows  
And they all suppose what they want to suppose  
When they hear oom pah pah
