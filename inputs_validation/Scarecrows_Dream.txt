Seldom seen  
A scarecrows dream  
I hang in the hopes of replacement  
Castles tall  
I built them all  
But I dream that Im trapped in  
The basement  
  
And if you ever hear me calling out  
And if youve been by paupers crowned  
Between the worlds of men and  
Makebelieve  
I can be found  
  
Plans Ive made  
A masquerade  
Fading in fear of the coming day  
Heroes tales  
Like nightingales  
Wrestle the wind as they run away  
  
And if you ever hear them calling out  
And if youve been by paupers crowned  
Between the worlds of men and make  
Believe  
I can be found  
  
Garden gate  
An empty plate  
Waiting for someone to come and fill  
Scarecrows dreams  
Like frozen streams  
Thirst for the fall  
But theyre running still  
  
And if you ever hear me calling out  
And if youve been by paupers crowned  
Between the worlds of men and  
Makebelieve  
I can be found
