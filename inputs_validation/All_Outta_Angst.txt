Im not insane Im not bummed out  
I got no one to blame nothing to change  
I got no evil to fight  
  
One things for sure Im all outta angst  
Society dont bother me  
And theres something wrong with that  
  
So Im off to Pakistan learn the laws of Islam  
Fundamentalism forget that rocknroll  
No cigarette no drink in fact  
Its difficult to think about getting laid  
When you dont even get to see her face  
Im not insane  
  
Im not insane Im not liquored  
I got nothin to do nothin to lose  
I got no place to call home  
One things for sure Im all outta angst  
Society dont bother me theres something wrong with that  
  
Next stop Mongolia  
Dont get to golf or fuck or bowl with ya  
Throw out that handicap  
No stepping out till spring in fact its  
Difficult to sing when its 20 below  
And thats during the day  
Im not insane
