Yeah  
  
Yeah  
Tu ru tu tu tu tu  
Yeah  
Tu ru tu tu tu tu  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Its another world here  
The streets are gleaming  
I was even dreaming  
That theyre paved with gold  
  
Seventeen at half past ten  
All the crowds are surging past  
An electric display  
  
Theres another world here  
Below shop windows  
Upon the pavement  
Where you wave goodbye  
  
Boys and girls  
Come too roost  
From Northern parts  
And Scottish towns  
Will we catch your eye  
  
While you pretend not to notice  
All the years weve been here  
Were the bums you step over  
As you leave the Theatre  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Its another world here  
Somebody is singing Yeah  
I was only wishing  
For a bit of cash  
  
From a patron of the arts  
Or at least the phantom of the opera  
Will I catch your eye  
  
While you pretend not to notice  
Tu ru tu  
All the years weve been here  
Were the bums you step over  
Tu ru tu  
As you leave the Theatre  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
Everybody  
  
Pavarotti in the park  
Then you walked back up the Strand  
Did you catch my eye  
  
And then pretend not to notice  
Tu ru tu  
All the years weve been here  
Were the bums you step over  
Tu ru tu  
As you leave the Theatre  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
In the end you pretend  
Tu ru tu  
Cause its so much easier  
Were the bums you step over  
Tu ru tu  
As you leave the Theatre Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Tu ru tu  
  
Were the bums you step over  
Tu ru tu   
As you leave the Theatre  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Ha ha ha ha
