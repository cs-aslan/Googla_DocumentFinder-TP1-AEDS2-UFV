Witness the downfall of men  
I wanna kill you for your land I dont mean to kill the reactor  
Linking in Japan I am here got the gangsta for all your chain chains  
March to the heart beat of the city  
You only hear the drums when they audace and they see me  
You know what time it is Flavor with a thousand checks  
Its like the ice ring surrounds my neck  
I never worry about the referee the gate keepers keep him locked for me  
Push all to shallow forever  
Always will be underground X to the motherfucker Z  
Fold it all for the money cant team where my gangstars at  
Hit the park build at the car scene blowing red everywhere  
Look how strong we are  
So there will be no war or shots  
Im about to give my city boiling hot and make em pray for real  
And make em say my name lit up more smoke than a power water drill  
Concentration determination  
The very thin line between paradise and incarceration  
  
Chorus  
Gangsters gangsters  
Gangsters stand up and rap what youre claiming  
Police roll around shake us down always playing and I  
Gangsters gangsters  
Streets made me into this man gotta represent who I am  
  
They say right before you day you get the irry feeling of peace  
Then walk into the light  
My soul want me take it without a fight  
She says she wanna spend the whole life  
But she only got me here for one night  
Said its time better get it in Call your best friend  
Im a call you wondertwins  
Stop and go like red light traffic innovation made it another classic  
We made it happen  
And big hip hop want us gut cut  
Niggas dare too much than offense popped up  
Another game fucked up because the lanes clocked up  
But the content sucks  
I wanna fill up some big red trucks tour then through  
The whole world motherfuckers lining up  
Cause these tickets wont move like crap  
Youre tying west coast around my back  
And yall niggas saying fuck it with that  
  
Chorus  
  
Cant even rely on your own eyes everything fake now  
Toast to the bad guys  
That will leave a whole class swimming with the fishes  
Part machine part skill part intuition  
I cooked my first album in my fathers kitchen  
He told me how to make a living twenty grand and half a chicken  
Now Im shitting on myself and still I let him know  
That if he turn me in a turn around it kill us both  
This is a cold world but Im a polar bear  
Destroy the earth like a silver flare best beware of us  
In God we trust but everybody else gotta pay cash up front  
Caught there they try to tear me down  
Im on a level now I speak like I mean it the focus study my literature  
Clean house taking out the trash Im in the fly zone  
Where you past gangsta  
  
Chorus
