It doesnt pay to try  
All the smart boys know why  
It doesnt mean I didnt try  
I just never know why  
  
It isnt cause Im all alone  
Oh baby youre not home  
And when Im home  
Big deal Im still alone  
  
Its so restless I am  
Beat my head against a pole  
Try to knock some sense down side my bones  
And even though it dont show  
Those guys are so old  
  
Chorus  
Cant put your arms around a memory  
Cant put your arms around a memory  
Cant put your arms around a memory  
Dont try  
Dont try  
  
Youre just a basket case  
And you got no name  
Could you live with me  
Go on and say  
And even though it dont show  
Those guys are so old  
Cant put your arms around a memory  
  
Chorus  
  
Johnny youre me  
Yeah youre memory  
I want to put my arms around your memory  
I cant try I cant trydont try
