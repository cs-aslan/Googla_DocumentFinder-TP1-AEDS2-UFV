Sittin around waiting for an airplane  
Dont know how to fly but thats okay  
Got me a pilot shes going my way  
If shes got wings if shes got wings  
  
Sittin around waiting for the mailman  
I dont how he could be so slow  
My good friend said you wrote me a letter  
Must have been a year ago  
  
Well Ive got a feeling  
That I should be leaving on  
  
Sittin around watching the rainfall  
I dont know how it could rain so long  
They say the ocean she is a woman  
Who waits for her man to come home  
  
Well Ive got a feeling  
That I should be leaving on  
  
Well Ive got a feeling  
That I should be leaving on  
Well Ive got a feeling  
That I should be leaving on  
Well Ive got a feeling  
That I should be leaving on  
Well Ive got a feeling  
That I should be leaving  
  
Sittin around waiting for an airplane  
Dont know how to fly but thats okay  
I got me a pilot shes going my way  
If shes got wings if shes got wings  
If shes got wings if shes got wings  
If shes got wings if shes got wings
