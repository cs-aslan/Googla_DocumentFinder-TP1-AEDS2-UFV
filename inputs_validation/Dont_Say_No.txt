When we were only 17  
And thrown into society  
That was the end of you and me  
From what we could have been  
  
And if we didnt keep in touch  
I guess we didnt care that much  
We never understood that stuff  
But now I need you  
  
I never meant to let you down  
But lettin you down was easy  
  
Didnt it break your heart  
Maybe Im just too needy  
Do any of you still need me  
In your lives in your heart  
  
Dont say yes just to please me  
If youre still you and you arent  
But dont say no  
  
We fought together laughed together  
Said things that we hoped were clever  
The thought of missing you forever  
Makes me wanna cry  
  
And now that youve grown up to be  
A sentimental memory  
Are you still you cause Im still me  
At least I hope so  
  
A life beginning somewhere else  
It was our time to die  
  
Didnt it break your heart  
Maybe Im just too needy  
Do any of you still need me  
In your life in your heart  
  
Dont say yes just to please me  
If youre still you and you arent  
Dont say no  
  
So what do you know  
Where do you go has it been fun  
Oh did you survive being buried alive  
Like I did  
  
Didnt it break your heart  
Maybe Im just too needy  
Do any of you still need me  
In your life in your heart  
  
Dont say yes just to please me  
If youre still you and you want  
Dont say no  
  
Didnt it break your heart  
Maybe Im just too needy  
Do any of you still need me  
In your life in your heart  
  
Dont say yes just to please me  
If youre still you and then you arent  
Dont say no
