You got into my life  
I dont know how you found me but you did  
It stopped me heading someplace else  
  
Took me a while to say  
Wish you belong to me  
But now Im saddened like Ive never been  
Regretting that well leave  
  
And for a while you could comfort me  
And hold me for some time  
I need you now to be beside me  
While all my world is so untidy  
  
Loneliness ohooh  
Empty faces ohooh  
Wish I could leave them all ooh  
In someplace else  
  
Someplace else  
  
I hope you wont let go  
Maybe youll let me know  
That youll be saddened like youve never been  
Regretting that well leave  
  
And for a while I could comfort you  
And hold you in my mind  
I need you now to be beside me  
While all my world is sad and crazy  
  
Loneliness ohooh  
Empty faces ohooh  
Wish I could leave them all ooh  
In someplace else  
  
And for a while you could comfort me  
And hold me for some time  
I need you now to be beside me  
While all my world is so untidy  
  
Loneliness ohooh  
Empty faces ohooh  
Wish I could leave them all ooh  
In someplace else  
  
Loneliness ohooh  
Empty faces ohooh  
Wish I could leave them all ooh  
In someplace else  
  
Someplace else  
  
I think Im gonna leave them all  
In someplace else
