Im gonna follow you till I wear you down  
Im gonna follow you cause this heres my town  
You dont know these streets the way that I do i do I do  
You cant turn it on and off the way that I do i do I do  
  
Oh oh  
  
Im gonna follow you till I know your timing  
Youll turn some corner soon and find you cant get by me  
You dont know these streets the way that I do i do I do  
You cant turn it on and off the way that I do i do I do  
  
You see yourself as some kind of lily of the valley  
You come around here in your ballet slippers padding on my alley  
And you know that you cant dance  
Cause you know you never had the chance  
Im gonna dance for you  
  
Oh oh  
  
Im gonna follow you till I wear you down  
Im gonna follow you cause this heres my town  
You dont know these streets the way that I do i do I do  
You cant turn it on and off the way that I do i do I do  
  
You see yourself as some kind of lily of the valley  
You come around here in your ballet slippers padding on my alley  
And you know that you cant dance  
Cause you know you never had the chance  
Im gonna dance for you  
  
Oh oh
