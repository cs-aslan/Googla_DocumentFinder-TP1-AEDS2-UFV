Prince or pauper beggar man or thing  
Play the game with evry flower you bring  
Dandelion dont tell no lies  
Dandelion will make you wise  
Tell me if she laughs or cries  
Blow away dandelion  
  
One oclock two oclock three oclock four oclock chimes  
Dandelions dont care about the time  
Dandelion dont tell no lies  
Dandelion will make you wise  
Tell me if she laughs or cries  
Blow away dandelion blow away dandelion  
  
Tho youre older now its just the same  
You can play this dandelion game  
When youre finished with your childlike prayers  
Well you know you should wear it  
  
Tinker tailor soldier sailors lives  
Rich man poor man beautiful daughters wives  
Dandelion dont tell no lies  
Dandelion will make you wise  
Tell me if she laughs or cries  
Blow away dandelion blow away dandelion  
  
Little girls and boys come out to play  
Bring your dandelions to blow away  
Dandelion dont tell no lies  
Dandelion will make you wise  
Tell me if she laughs or cries  
Blow away dandelion blow away dandelion
