So you love the way he holds you in the night  
And you believe him when he tells you  
Everythings alright  
But I wonder if you know  
The nature of his game  
And all the others hes been lovin just the same  
Yeah  
  
CHORUS  
Sooner or later somebodys gotta let you know  
Sooner or later somebodys gotta let you know  
It might as well be me  
It might as well be me  
Yeah  
  
  
Promises and plans inside your head  
As you sit alone and think of things he said  
But of all the love you tell me  
You know youve been tastin  
Its much more than all your time  
I know youve been wastin babe yeah  
  
  
CHORUS  
  
  
I hate to be the one to bring you down  
But everybodys talking its all over town  
The same old story  
They tell me thats the way it goes  
Im the first to tell you now  
And baby youre the last to know yeah  
  
  
CHORUS  
Sooner or later somebodys gotta let you know  
Sooner or later somebodys gotta let you know
