Chorus  
  
Im in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until lifes no fun  
All I really got to do is live and die  
But Im in a hurry and dont know why  
  
Dont know why  
I have to drive so fast  
My car has nothing to prove  
Its not new but itll do 0 to 60 in 52  
  
Chorus  
  
Cant be late  
That leaves me plenty of time  
Shakin hands with the clock  
I cant stop Im on a roll and ready to rock  
  
Chorus  
  
I hear a voice  
It says Im runnin behind  
I better pick up my pace  
Its a race and there aint no room  
For someone in second place  
  
Break  
  
Chorus
