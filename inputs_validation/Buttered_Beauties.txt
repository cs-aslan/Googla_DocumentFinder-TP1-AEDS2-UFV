The first time I saw you  
I knew there would be no other  
That tingle told me  
We were meant for one another  
Im calling you  
123  
Buttered beauties of the negroid north  
Spread your glossy tallow on me  
Oiled wonder of the midnight forest  
Toss down your web on me  
Shes got me by the tether  
sticking it out  
In simultated leather  
sticking it out  
I think she broke my tether  
Seemon keep on comin on now
