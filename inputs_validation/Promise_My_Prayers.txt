Written by Lowell Alexander Gayla Borders Jeff Borders  
  
Ill cover Ill cover you Ill cover  
  
Hey now you know its true  
After all that weve been through  
You can count on me  
When it comes down to the end  
I will always be your friend  
No matter where you go  
I want you to know now  
  
Chorus  
I promise my prayers  
I promise my heart  
Ill be thinking of you  
Wherever you are  
When the daylight is done  
When the night is so dark  
When I cannot be there  
I promise my prayers  
  
Down each road we take  
Were joined together when we pray  
No matter where life leads  
I will lift you up  
Youll be covered by his love  
The angels will find you  
Im here to remind you now  
  
Chorus  
Ill cover Ill cover you Ill cover  
  
Beyond our understanding  
His hand is moving and we stand amazed  
I pray His love will guide you  
I know Hes there beside you always  
  
Chorus
