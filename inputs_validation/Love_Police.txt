Sometimes I lie awake wondering if Ill make it out of here  
But the wind blows round my heels so I stay  
I remember lying there wishing I could be someone else  
Trying to find somehow to get away  
  
If I asked him nicely dyou think hes show me how to fly  
Cause the dust has weighed my wings down and Im too tired to try  
  
Sometimes I sit here hearing voices in my head  
I try to understand to make some sense  
  
I wonder if I had to would I lie to save myself  
A plea of guilty but self defense  
  
If I asked him nicely dyou think hed show me how  
Im sure hes out there listening but hes too tied up right now to try  
  
Try all of my sins  
Cause I cant stop now  
Just dont leave me behind  
  
Sometimes I lie awake wondering if Ill get out of here  
But the words stick in my throat and I stay  
I remember lying there wishing I could be someone else  
Trying to find somehow to get away  
  
If I asked him nicely dyou think hes show me how to fly  
Cause the dust has weighed my wings down and Im too tired to try
