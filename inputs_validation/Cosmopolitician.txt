I sleep between the gates of night in a no mans land  
Always closer than you think a kind of your best friend  
I have no religion and I have no flag  
I dont care if youre wrong or right  
Lilac skinned or black  
  
Im a cosmopolitician  
Closer than your next of kin  
Angel devil of the night  
And the seed of everything  
  
And if your world has turned to ashes  
I will leave you never  
Even when the suns blown out I will shine forever  
I caress you with my charms  
Im your best friend the dream  
Im the light that guides you through the nights  
And deepest haze  
  
Im a cosmopolitician  
  
You need a friend without a doubt  
I wonder why you came around  
Are you awake or do you dream  
Youre stuck inside a frozen scene  
You try to move but theres no moves  
You try to speak but theres no use  
You try to wake but you cant  
You close your eyes without a chance  
You need a friend without a doubt  
I wonder why you came around
