Go far enough and you will reach  
A place where the sea runs underneath  
And well see our shadow high in the sky  
Drying away in the night  
  
Ive sailed the world for seven years  
And left all I love behind in tears  
Wont you come here wherever you are  
Ive been alone long enough  
  
You you have your own special way  
Of holding my hand keep it way bove the water  
Dont ever let go  
Oh no no no  
  
You you have your own special way  
Of turning the world so its facing  
The way that Im going dont ever  
Dont ever stop  
  
Whose seen the wind not you or I  
But when the ship moves shes passing by  
Between you and me I really dont think  
She knows where shes going at all  
  
You you have your own special way  
Of carrying me twice round the world  
Never closer to home than the day  
The day I started  
  
You you have your own special way  
Hold onto my hand keep it way bove the water  
Dont ever let go  
No no no  
  
What mean the dreams night after night  
The man in the moons a blinding light  
Wont you come out whoever you are  
Youve followed me quiet long enough  
  
You you have your own special way  
Of holding my hand dont ever let go  
You you have your own special way  
Of turning the world so its facing  
The way that Im going dont ever  
Dont ever leave me
