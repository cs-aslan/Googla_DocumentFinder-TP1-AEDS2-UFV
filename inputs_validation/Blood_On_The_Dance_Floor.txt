She got your number  
She know your game  
She put you under  
Its so insane  
  
Since you seduced her  
How does it feel  
To know that woman  
Is out to kill  
  
Every night stance is like takin a chance  
Its not about love and romance  
And now youre gonna get it  
  
Every hot man is out takin a chance  
Its not about love and romance  
And now you do regret it  
  
To escape the world Ive got to enjoy that simple dance  
And it seemed that everything was on my side  
Blood on my side  
  
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance  
And now shes out to get me  
And I just cant take it  
Just cant break it  
  
Susie got your number  
And Susie aint your friend  
Look who took you under  
With seven inches in  
  
Blood is on the dance floor  
Blood is on the knife  
Susies got your number  
And Susie says its right  
  
She got your number  
How does it feel  
To know this stranger  
Is out to kill  
  
She got your baby  
It happened fast  
If you could only  
Erase the past  
  
Every night stance is like takin a chances  
Its not about love and romance  
And now youre gonna get it  
  
Every hot man is out takin a chance  
Its not about love and romance  
And now you do regret it  
  
To escape the world I got to enjoy this simple dance  
And it seemed that everything was on my side  
Blood on my side  
  
It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance  
And now shes out to get me  
And I just cant take it  
Just cant break it  
  
Susie got your number  
And Susie aint your friend  
Look who took you under  
With seven inches in  
  
Blood is on the dance floor  
Blood is on the knife  
Susie got your number
