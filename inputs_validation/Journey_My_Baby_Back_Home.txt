Pale moon start on your journey Im pleading to you  
Somewhere youll find a broken heart yearning too  
  
Bright stars were shining but clouds drifted by  
Just to darken a true love affair  
And I know Im to blame for the showers that fell  
They meant more than my old pal could bear  
I cant see what happened why I went astray  
But I promise Ill never more roam  
  
So pale moon Ive made you promise  
so Journey My Baby Back Home  
  
Pale moon start on your journey Im pleading to you  
Somewhere youll find a broken heart yearning too  
  
They say that a new day is born when the sun  
Climbs the stairs to the heaven so blue  
But to me only one day is born evry year  
Since Ive cheated and been so un true  
Im weary Im heartsick Ive worried Ive cried  
Down your long silver trail starts to roam  
  
So pale moon Ive made you promise  
so Journey My Baby Back Home
