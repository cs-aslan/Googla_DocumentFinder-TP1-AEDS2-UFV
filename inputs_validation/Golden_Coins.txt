Say youre mine then ask me what you will  
All your dreams my darling Ill fulfill  
Golden coins I will bring to you  
Silver trinkets and rubies too  
In return dear Im begging you  
For the pleasures of love  
Ill bring gifts like you never saw  
Priceless garments that youll adore  
Persian rugs to enhance your floor  
For the pleasures of love  
Darling choose anything you please  
Rich brocade or woven tapestries  
In exchange I plead on my knees  
For the pleasure of love  
Golden coins Ill place at your feet  
Precious jewels to make life complete  
All my treasures are yours my sweet  
For the pleasures of love
