What is this all of my darkest fears  
Why have they gathered here  
To watch a fool go down  
Go away Why would you waste your time  
Here where the sun wont shine  
Theres nothing left for you  
  
Chorus  
I cant go on this way  
Knowing you dont want me  
I cant go on this way  
Knowing you dont need me  
I cant go on this way  
When everything I do depends on you  
Depends on you  
  
I had it all One of the sunny boys  
Hear my pride and joy  
You were always there by me  
Funny how fast sunny times go by  
And fall to a darkened sky  
And lot of useless toys  
  
I cant go on this way  
Knowing you dont want me  
I cant go on this way  
Knowing you dont need me  
I can t go on this way  
When every step I take depends on you  
Depends on you  
  
I cant go on this way  
Knowing you dont want me  
I cant go on this way  
Knowing you dont need me  
I cant go on this way  
When everything I do depends on you  
Depends on you
