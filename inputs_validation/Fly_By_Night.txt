Why try I know why  
The feeling inside me says its time I was gone  
Clear head new life ahead  
Its time I was king now  not just one more pawn  
  
Chorus  
Fly by night away from here  
Change my life again  
Fly by night goodbye my dear  
My ship isnt coming and I just cant pretend  
  
Moon rise thoughtful eyes  
Staring back at me from the window beside  
No fright or hindsight  
Leaving behind that empty feeling inside  
  
Chorus  
Fly by night away from here  
Change my life again  
Fly by night goodbye my dear  
My ship isnt coming and I just cant pretend  
  
Start a new chapter  
Find what Im after  
Its changing every day  
The change of a season  
Is enough of a reason  
To want to get away  
Quiet and pensive  
My thoughts apprehensive  
The hours drift away  
Leaving my homeland  
Playing a lone hand  
My life begins today  
  
Chorus  
Fly by night away from here  
Change my life again  
Fly by night goodbye my dear  
My ship isnt coming and I just cant pretend
