I know that youve been foolin around on me right from the start  
So Ill give back your ring and Ill take back my heart  
And when youre tire of foolin around with two or three  
  
Just come on home and fool around with me  
Then come on home and fool around with me  
  
Well I wasnt foolin around the day I said I do  
But many a night I wished that I had been afoolin too  
I know its foolish taking all this misery  
But when its you a fool Ill always be  
  
So honey fool around You know right where Im at  
And dont worry if Im lonesome cause Im used to that  
And when youre tire of foolin around with two or three  
Then come on home and fool around with me  
  
I know that youve been foolin around on me right from the start  
So Ill give back your ring and Ill take back my heart  
And when youre tire of foolin round with two or three  
Just come on home and fool around with me
