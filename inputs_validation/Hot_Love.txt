I never knew someone who made me  
Feel so good before  
But I never gave my heart to anyone  
Who could hurt me more  
And when you promise me that no one else  
Will ever take my place  
I get the feeling youre just leading me on  
And lying right to my face  
  
First you say you want me then you say  
Youre leaving  
Ive gotta know if Im coming or going with you  
When ya say you need me  
Do you really mean it  
Maybe its true I just wish I could believe it  
  
Hot love ya leave me so cold  
But one touch and youve got me  
Where ya want me  
Hot love ya leave me so cold  
I dont know if Im coming or going  
Theres no way of knowing with you  
  
Just when I give it up the game  
Is through and your heart is mine  
I turn around youre up to something new  
Ya do it time after time  
  
Whats it gonna take to break this circle  
Ive gotta know am I coming or going with you  
And when ya hurt me do ya really mean to  
Ya say ya dont I wish I could believe you  
  
Hot love ya leave me so cold  
But one touch and youve got me  
Where ya want me  
Hot love ya leave me so cold  
I dont know if Im coming or going  
Theres no way of knowing with you  
  
You come on like a fire burning  
And Im lost in the flame  
Over and over again  
  
Hot love ya leave me so cold  
But one touch and youve got me  
Where ya want me  
Hot love ya leave me so cold  
I dont know if Im coming or going  
Theres no way of knowing with you
