How can I be sure  
In a world thats constantly changing  
How can I be sure  
Where I stand with you  
  
Whenever i  
Whenever I am away from you  
I wanna die  
cause you know I wanna stay with you  
  
How do I know  
Maybe youre trying to use me  
Flying too high can confuse me  
Touch me but dont take me down  
  
Whenever i  
Whenever I am away from you  
My alibi is telling people  
I dont care for you  
  
Maybe Im just hanging round  
With my head up upside down  
Its a pity for you  
I cant seem to find somebody new thats as  
Wonderful baby as you  
  
How can I be sure  
I really really really wanna know  
Really really wanna know  yeah  
  
Also whether  
Whether or not were together  
Together will seem that much better  
I love you I love you forever  
You know where I can be found  
  
How can I be sure  
In a world thats constantly changing  
How can I be sure  
Ill be sure with you
