You drive the away the best of you  
Its all thats left to say  
You leave me with the rest of you  
Youve made it on your way  
I need a call to save from you  
Just before you go  
The more that Ive been close with you  
The door was always closed  
Chorus  
Drive away theres nothing you should say  
Drive away but drive us anyway  
Get on up and straight you go  
Theres nothing left to say  
And begging nots my place you know  
Youll never hear it anyway  
Theres all the days I let you stay  
I saw it made you blind  
Theres more than I can really say  
Why it is it traps you all inside  
  
Chorus  
You made it all get so uptight  
I made it in the dreams  
You went and robbed an overnight  
And they hid behind your scream  
Theyve hidden where I just dont know  
I think youve gone inside  
I hope the world looks good from there  
But I hope it looks alright  
We never made it all the way  
We never made it all the way  
You take the best of you  
Ill keep the rest of you  
  
Chorus
