I was out on the coastline  
Getting a little shake  
Do it every day  
For mercy sake  
Sometime surfs up  
Sometimes its flat  
Eatin up asphalt  
Prowlin like a tomcat  
Stunned at what I see  
Should I stay or should I leave  
Too much not enough PCH  
Too much not enough PCH  
Feelin kind of free  
By the deep blue sea  
A true blood blue sud  
Hangin on me  
Want to head north  
But I might go south  
Cant make up my mind  
Cause Im thinking like Brian  
Im hangin in and out  
Im pullin up cause its about  
Too much not enough PCH  
Too much not enough PCH
