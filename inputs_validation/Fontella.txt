You see that girlie in the yellow sweater  
Her cheeks are roses and her lips are mellow  
Thats amy girl and her name is Fontella  
Ohoh Fontella is the girl for me  
I says aoh Fontella well Fontella  
I says aoh Fontella you know Fontella  
Fontella is the girl for me  
She loves me more when I hold her tight  
She wants to kiss me with all her might  
Oh Fontella wont you be my wife  
Ohyeah pretty baby Ill treat you right  
I says aoh Fontella well Fontella  
I says aoh Fontella you know Fontella  
Fontella is the girl for me  
Im tellin you gal shes a mighty fine  
I just cant get her off of my mind  
When she goes struttin down the street  
All the little birdies go tweettweettweet
