Straight out of some story  
You walk in in all your glory  
I thought you were perfect for me  
I was out of my mind  
  
Looked like I was winning  
It was the best love Id ever been in  
Just when we were beginning The End you left me behind  
And I was looking forward to a happy ending  
So much for pretending  
  
I should have known better  
Than to think of happyeverafter  
You and me together  
I was out of my league  
  
I kept my heart hidden  
Now Im wishin that I didnt  
Oh who am I kidding  
You werent even intrigued  
And I was looking forward to a happy ending  
So much for pretending  
  
It couldve been beautiful  
If Id only met ya  
If Id only let you know  
What you meant to me  
And if I could I would  
Give you a demonstration  
Of how my imagination  
Thought it ought to be  
So much for pretending  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah  
  
Pretending pretending pretending  
So much for pretending
