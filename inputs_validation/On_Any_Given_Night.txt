Id be foolin myself thinkin Ive got it made  
I just cant assume true love wont fade  
Ill keep on listenin to her say Im glad that I found her  
Keep on showin her how my world turns around her  
Cause  
  
On any given night  
She could walk away  
She wont be mine for the takin  
And thats the price that Id pay  
Cause loves everchangin  
And in the blink of an eye  
Teardrops could fall  
And I could lose it all  
On any given night  
  
Shes the sensitive kind she needs a connection  
And cannot be so blind to lose my direction  
Ill keep on walkin that mile show her how far Ill go  
Keep on letting her hear all she needs to know  
  
On any given night  
She could walk away  
She wont be mine for the takin  
And thats the price that Id pay  
Cause loves everchangin  
And in the blink of an eye  
Teardrops could fall  
And I could lose it all  
On any given night  
  
Teardrops could fall  
And I could lose it all  
On any given night
