My telescope looks out  
Into the stars tonight  
A little speck of light  
Seems twice the size tonight  
The Calculations are so fine  
Can it be growing all the Time  
  
Now I cant believe its true  
And I dont know what to do  
For the hundredth time  
I check the declination  
  
Now the fear starts to grow  
Even my computer shows  
There are no errors in the calculations  
  
Now its happened take no other view  
Collision course you must believe its true  
Now theres nothing left that we can do  
  
When Two Worlds collide  
The anger and the pain  
Of all those who remain  
Two worlds collide  
Who will be left alive  
No place to hide  
  
When Two Worlds Collide  
The anger the pain  
Of those who remain  
When two worlds collide  
When two worlds collide  
So who will survive  
Theres No place to hide  
When Two Worlds collide
