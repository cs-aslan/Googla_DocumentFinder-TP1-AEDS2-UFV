Oh I cant find a way to keep pretending  
Im doin alright on my own  
And I cant find the strength to keep believin  
That youll ever come back home  
But Im tryin to put this behind me  
And Ive been cryin more than you know  
Id be lyin to say this wont kill me  
Oh Im dyin cause I cant let go  
And I cant find a way to keep pretending  
Well Im doin alright on my own  
And I cant find the strength to keep believin  
That youll ever come back home  
Oh your perfume still lingers all around me  
In our bedroom where I loved you so  
Id be lyin to say this wont kill me  
Oh Im dyin cause I cant let go  
Id be lyin to say this wont kill me  
Oh Im dyin cause I cant let go
