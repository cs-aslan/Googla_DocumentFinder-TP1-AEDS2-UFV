Just punched the clock and boy am I ready  
Walkin out the door headin home  
Its time to buckle up again in my rolling hunk of tin  
Its quittin time the evenin race is on  
Its that five oclock 500 and I run it every day  
Pick up trucks cars and buses all in my way  
Weve got Darrel weve got Dale Richard Mark Rusty and Jeff  
Oh the boss just dropped the green were on our way  
Its that five oclock 500 every day  
Oh Bubbas runnin right on my bumper  
Pushin me but theres no where to go  
Lane changin left and right blowin horns and blinkin lights  
Oh the fast lane has never been so slow  
Its that five oclock 500 and I run it every day  
Pick up trucks cars and buses all in my way  
Weve got Darrel weve got Dale Richard Mark Rusty and Jeff  
Oh the boss just dropped the green were on our way  
Its that five oclock 500 every day  
Well the caution is out were at a stand still  
Heard theres construction up ahead  
Wont be long so they say soon well all be on our way  
Some trucker on the CB just said  
Its that five oclock 500 and I run it every day  
Pick up trucks cars and buses all in my way  
Weve got Darrel weve got Dale Richard Mark Rusty and Jeff  
Oh the boss just dropped the green were on our way  
Its that five oclock 500 five oclock 500 five oclock 500 every day  
Every day every day every day  
Five oclock 500
