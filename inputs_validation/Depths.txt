In Your presence I quiet my soul  
And I hear Your voice  
In my spirit I hear the sound  
Of salvations song  
Jesus Jesus  
  
I will wait in Your word oh Lord  
There Your spirit speaks  
Bringing life to the weary soul  
To the depths of me  
Jesus Jesus x2  
  
I love You with all my heart  
I love You with all my soul Lord  
I love You with all my strength  
With all that is within me  
x2  
  
Ill sing cause You saved my soul  
Ill sing of Your love forever  
Ill worship with all my heart  
With all that is within me  
Jesus Jesus x6  
  
I love You with all my heart  
I love You with all my soul Lord  
I love You with all my strength  
With all that is within me  
  
Ill sing cause You saved my soul  
Ill sing of Your love forever  
Ill worship with all my heart  
With all that is within me  
Jesus Jesus x4
