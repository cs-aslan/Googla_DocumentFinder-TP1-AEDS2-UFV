Look at this face I know the years are showing  
Look at this life I still dont know where its going  
  
I dont know much but I know I love you  
That may be all I need to know  
  
Look at these eyes they never seen what matters  
Look at these dreams so beaten and so battered  
  
I dont know much but I know I love you  
That may be all I need to know  
  
So many questions still left unanswered  
So much Ive never broken through  
And when I feel you near mesometimes I see so clearly  
That only truth Ill never know is me and you  
  
Look at this man so blessed with inspiration  
Look at this soul still searching for salvation  
  
I dont know much but I know I love you  
That may be all I need to know  
  
I dont know much but I know I love you  
That may be all I need to know  
  
I dont know much but I know I love you  
That may be all there is to know
