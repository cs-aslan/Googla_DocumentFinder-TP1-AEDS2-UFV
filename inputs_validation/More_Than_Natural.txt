Love Ill help you to see  
The world is ours it used to be  
But now its changed so much  
We have to change it back  
Soon will be a day  
When just a look will be to say  
Lets break away today  
Lets start again Ill tell you where  
Ill tell you when  
You came from out of the air  
And wrapped in fire  
  
Said dont you be scared  
Cant you use your life  
To save so many more  
Cast my pride away  
And had me born again that very day  
And now Im so alive  
Im comin through  
Theyre teaching me to tell it to you  
  
Oh Im more the natural  
Way to be  
Its the natural remedy  
With the natural guarantee  
  
Oh your hearts would say  
My mind is gone  
And ran away  
But whos the loser if you dont know  
What I have  
A job thats hard to beat  
Looking out for holey feet  
Treading softly on the ground  
Making waves but not a sound  
  
Oh Im more the natural  
Way to be  
Its the natural remedy  
With the natural guarantee
