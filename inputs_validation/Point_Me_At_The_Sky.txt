Hey Eugene  
This is Henry McClean  
And Ive finished my beautiful flying machine  
And Im ringing to say  
That Im leaving and maybe  
Youd like to fly with me  
And hide with me baby  
  
Isnt it strange  
How little we change  
Isnt it sad were insane  
Playing the game that we know end in tears  
The games weve been playing for thousands and thousands and thousands and  
  
Jumps into his cosmic flyer  
Pulled his plastic collar higher  
Light the fuse and stand right back  
  
He cried  
This is my last goodbye  
  
Point me at the sky and let it fly  
Point me at the sky and let it fly  
Point me at the sky and let it fly  
  
And if you survive till two thousand and five  
I hope youre exceedingly thin  
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out  
While the people around you breathe in  
  
People pushing on my sides  
Is something that I hate  
And so is sitting down to eat  
With only little capsules on my plate  
  
Point me at the sky and let it fly  
Point me at the sky and let it fly  
Point me at the sky and let it fly  
  
And all weve got to say to you is goodbye  
Its time to go better run and get your bags  
Its goodbye  
Hey jean look at the screen and its goodbye  
 milky way and its goodbye
