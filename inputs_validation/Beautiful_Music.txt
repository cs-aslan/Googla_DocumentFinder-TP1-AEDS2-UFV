Once my life had no direction I was lost as could be  
I was caught in a whirlpool spinning around in misery  
I needed a friend you took me in and you touched my heart  
With your song of love you gave me a brand new start  
Now theres beautiful music flowin on through me just like you said  
Angels singin joy bells ringing inside my head  
Since you came inside me now Im lost inside your love  
You gave me just enough to make me hunger for more of you  
Now Im hooked on your lovin and I dont want to break loose  
With my heart in my hand Im yours to command do what you want me to  
Just never let me go Lord Im so in love with you  
Now theres beautiful music flowin on through me just like you said  
Angels singin joy bells ringin inside my head  
Since you came inside me now Im lost inside your love  
Beautiful music flowin on through me just like you said  
Angels singin joy bells ringin inside my head  
Beautiful music flowin on through me just like you said  
Angels singin joy bells ringin inside my head
