It feels like Im walkin on air  
When we walk down our street  
When the neighbors stop to watch us walk by  
You can hear em talking let them talk  
  
Sometimes I think that youre the only reason  
The sun still shines when it shines  
And when this wicked world starts bringing me down  
I tell myself that Im one lucky guy  
  
Chorus  
I got the girl with all the cards  
I got the girl shes a work of art  
I got the girl whos gonna break my heart  
  
She says that someday shes gonna marry me  
When that day comes that we walk down the aisle  
Shell make me feel like a prince a lord or a king  
She likes to wear her stripe with her plaids  
And she wont brush her hair I swear  
She dont like wearing shoes in December  
But I dont care I dont care  
  
Chorus  
I got the girl with all the cards  
I got the girl shes a work of art  
I got the girl whos gonna break my heart  
  
If I was a holy man Id get down on my knees  
So the angels that watch over her would give a break to me  
Holy Mother of saint bubble gum and sister bandaid knees  
Wont you please pray for the ones like me  
  
But the truth is someday  
Somebody is gonna take her you see  
But the queen of hearts will always be  
A fiveyearold princess to me to me  
  
Chorus  
I got the girl with all the cards  
I got the girl shes a work of art  
I got the girl whos gonna break my heart  
  
I got the girl shes gonna leave her mark  
I got the girl shes a work of art  
I got the girl shes gonna break your heart  
  
I got the girl
