Baby dont you know  
Tonight youll take away my sorrow  
Baby dont you know  
That it will all come back tomorrow  
When we have to part  
Why oh why  
Do I go on loving you  
  
Baby dont you know  
How much I want my arms about you  
Baby dont you know  
This emptiness I feel without you  
Close to my heart  
Close to my heart  
  
Dont ever ever say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
Unless you wanna see wanna see me cry  
  
Baby dont you know  
That we were meant to be together  
Baby dont you know  
The thought of leaving you forever  
Tears me apart  
Tears me apart  
  
Ill never say goodbye to you  
Say goodbye to you  
Unless you really want really want me to  
Baby dont you know  
I wanna spend my life loving you  
  
Close to my heart  
Dont ever ever say goodbye  
Dont say goodbye  
Unless you wanna see wanna see me cry  
  
Baby dont you know  
That we were meant to be together  
Baby dont you know  
The thought of leaving you forever  
Tears me apart  
Tears me apart  
  
Ill never say goodbye to you  
Say goodbye to you  
Unless you really want really want me to  
Baby dont you know  
I wanna spend my life loving you  
  
Baby dont you know  
Wanna spend my life loving you  
Baby dont you know  
Baby dont you know  
I wanna spend my life  
Baby dont you know  
Baby dont you know
