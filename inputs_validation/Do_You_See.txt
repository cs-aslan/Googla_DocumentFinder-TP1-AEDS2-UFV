Hook  
Do you see what I see  
All I do is want to be  
Somebody can you feel what I feel  
I try my best to keep it real  
And pay dues  
ZRo  
Extra extra read all about it Im going crazy  
Ro raging with motherfuckers smoking going eighty  
Miles per hour pass up the city gel on my collar  
Trying to locate and half of it that will give a nigga some power  
Not saying that Im weak bullets gon hang when I speak  
I bust a brain if I reach and get that thang off my seat  
Im in love with selling thats why I aint winning that much  
Gas money looking funny wheels aint spinning that much  
But Ima make it the way of the other cause I cant stop  
People trying to trick me of my mission but I cant drop  
Cause I cant fall run up Ima keep bumping my lead  
Before the game over I know Ima be dumping my lead  
Because Im nervous by nature the slightest move will get you shot  
Ive been known to help niggas make it to they burial plot  
Not my lifestyle I love the way the feddy stack  
Record labels stealing ZRo to CEO gon get it back  
Hook  
ZRo  
Sometimes I feel like doing myself  
Sixty percent of my body is drank I ruin myself  
But Im addicted eyes fucked leaning and look inflicted  
With my facing revelations tripping on what it predicted  
Cause its happening when the trumpet blow  
Aint gon be no mo laughing and its to the left or the right  
I hope I get to go to heaven I hear heaven is tight  
Plus they tell me that hell is hot and they wont give you no ice  
I need a cool wrist most of these bitches be the devil trying to fool me  
Taking my kindness for weakness and trying to use me  
Bitch fuck your hair and your nails you bout to lose me  
I sleep with my uzi cause she aint gon steal from me if I nod off  
The only place I dont let her go is in God house  
Im a gangsta fa sho you better believe me  
I bet Ill be on that doja every time you see me  
Hook  
ZRo  
I done made up my mind  
Hustle all alone Im trying to get up some mo shine  
Every time I turn around someone bringing me down  
Got tired of em pulling on me started slanging them rounds  
And now they thinking Im a crazy  
Scarred and stabbed and shot Im still a baby I want my mama  
Cause Im having bad dreams and I die in em all  
Got me aint friendly when you see me aint no smiling at all  
I live the thug life heartless and hopeless  
Laying low ducking the law with long you lusting and acting douches  
Im connected my best friend use to be I10  
Until my out of town connect put out your chest and took my ends  
Got me throwed off in the mind retaliations what I take  
Fears get blowed off with my nine incarcerations what I face  
Feel me I done lost my mind but its all gravy baby  
I get tipped for knocking bustas off daily
