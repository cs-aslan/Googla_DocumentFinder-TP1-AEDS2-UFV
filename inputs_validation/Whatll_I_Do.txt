Gone is the romance that was so divine  
tis broken and cannot be mended  
You must go your way  
And I must go mine  
But now that our love dreams have ended  
Whatll I do  
When you are far away  
And I am blue  
Whatll I do  
Whatll I do  
When I am wondring who  
Is kissing you  
Whatll I do  
Whatll I do with just a photograph  
To tell my troubles to  
When Im alone  
With only dreams of you  
That wont come true  
Whatll I do  
  
Whatll I do with just a photograph  
To tell my troubles to  
When Im alone  
With only dreams of you  
That wont come true  
Whatll I do
