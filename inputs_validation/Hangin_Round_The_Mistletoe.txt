Snowy days and frosty night everything looks cold and white  
Hangin round the mistletoe hangin round the mistletoe  
  
Christmas day will soon be here and everybodys full of cheer  
Hangin round the mistletoe waitin for you dear  
  
Well Ive waited all year long and nore the year is almost gone  
Hangin round the mistletoe hangin round the mistletoe  
  
But if thats what Ive gotta do just to get a kiss from you  
Hangin round the mistletoe waitin for you dear  
  
Christmas is a special time to give and to receive  
For every little kiss you give me I will give you three  
  
You aint gonna miss one kiss thats one thing youll never miss  
Im hangin round the mistletoe waitin for you dear  
  
Well Ive had my eyes on you for a long long time  
So Im asking Santa please make that pretty girl mine  
  
Waited till Im cold and blue just to get a kiss from you  
Im hangin round the mistletoe waitin for you dear  
  
Hangin round the mistletoe waitin for you dear
