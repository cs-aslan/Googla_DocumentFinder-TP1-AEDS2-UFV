In the beginning  
Out of nowhere  
We had a dream  
And Now Its Helloween  
  
Speed up to a higher limit  
Change gear were losin our spirit  
We wont take your special advice  
We are close to a metal breakdown  
Sirens to warn of our meltdown  
We couldnt see that headline  
  
Now we can see a horizon  
Were gonna be here to stay  
If you cannot see our sign  
You must be blind  
  
Still we go  
Still we go  
Still we go  
On the metal highway  
Still we go  
  
Warn out wont die on our knees  
Shine on proud as we can be  
Time has come to stop pleasing you  
Hey man Lets get it together  
Our strength will last forever  
Push us as far as we can go  
  
Now we can see a horizon  
Were gonna be here to stay  
If you cannot see our sign  
You must be blind  
  
Still we go  
Still we go  
Still we go  
On the metal highway  
Still we go  
  
SOLO  
  
How many times must a man cross the lines  
To find his right way  
  
Still we go  
Still we go  
Still we go  
On the metal highway  
Still we go
