I dont want to be your angel  
I want to be your witch  
I gotta wait til the sun is down  
Im getting ready for another flight  
Only if youre ready  
And youre willing to drown  
You can be mine tonight  
Im never ever gonna live reality  
In the daylight  
Id never survive  
I could never be your angel  
Even if I tried  
  
I dont want to be your angel  
I want to be your witch  
  
I dont want to be your angel  
I want to be your witch  
  
I dont want to be your angel  
I want to be your witch  
I gotta wait til the sun is down  
Im getting ready for another flight  
Only if youre ready  
And youre willing to drown  
You can be mine tonight  
Im never ever gonna live reality  
In the daylight  
Id never survive  
I could never be your angel  
Even if I tried
