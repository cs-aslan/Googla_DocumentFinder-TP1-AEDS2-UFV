Here they come and they fly with the power of the sun  
Here they come and theyre going to touch everyone  
Far far have they come  
  
Here they come and the fire on their wings doesnt burn  
Here they come and they know everything we must learn  
Round round we must turn  
  
Watch out you sinners  
Dont you know that your time has come  
Watch out you winners  
Now its the same for everyone  
  
Here they come and the stars in their eyes seem to glow  
Here they come and the fear in our hearts starts to go  
Now now now we all know
