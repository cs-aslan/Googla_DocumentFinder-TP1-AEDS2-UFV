Verse 1 Pitbull  
They say he dont rap no more  
They say like LeBron he aint got the heat no more  
They say he aint street no more  
But like Jay say How sick am I wish em health for sure  
But Im cool with it act a fool with it  
Went to one of my old neighborhoods and built a school in it  
Its crazy baby the way that the 80s made me  
I thank God every day that music saved me  
I thank my mom for all the vision she gave me  
I thank Miami for the way you raised me
