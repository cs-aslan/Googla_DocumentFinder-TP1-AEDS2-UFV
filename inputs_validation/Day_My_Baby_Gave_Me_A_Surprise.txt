Got a surprise from my honey  
Got a message from my girl  
When she picked up her pen from beside her bed  
And wrote me a scribbled note  
Said shed be comin back to see me  
She would be visiting real soon  
Gonna get up from her lone white bed  
And leave this cold white room  
  
wahooooooooooooooooooh  
wahooooooooooooooooooh  
wahooooooooooooooooh  
  
We would once more live together  
Go out on a lovin spree  
Just like before the accident  
My baby would look at me  
I saw her sweet face tremblin  
As she tried to open her eyes  
I jumped with the joy of a grateful little boy  
The day my baby gave me a surprise  
  
wahooooooooooooooooooh  
wahooooooooooooooooooh  
wahooooooooooooooooh
