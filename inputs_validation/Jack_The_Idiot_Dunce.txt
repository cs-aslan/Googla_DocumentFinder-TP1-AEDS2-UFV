Whos the fool with the crosseyed stare  
The turned up nose and moronic glare  
Whos that simpleton standing over there  
Jack Jack the Idiot Dunce  
  
Whos that dumblooking frecklefaced runt  
Jack Jack the Idiot Dunce  
He walks like his feet are on back to front  
Jack Jack the Idiot Dunce  
  
When he waddles down the street he looks kind of queer  
Jack Jack the Idiot Dunce  
Cos hes got two left feet and taxidoor ears  
Jack Jack the Idiot Dunce  
  
And when we laugh at the clothes he wears  
Jack just smiles cos he dont care  
Hes a fool Hes a ninny  
Hes a twit Hes a chump  
The Idiot Dunce the Idiot Dunce  
  
Who is always the bottom of the class  
Jack Jack the Idiot Dunce  
Whos a fool Whos a boob  
Whos a kook and an ass  
Jack Jack the Idiot Dunce  
  
When we take examinations he never gets a pass  
Jack Jack the Idiot Dunce  
And we all put him down cos he cant think fast  
Jack Jack the Idiot Dunce  
We ridicule him and punch him around  
But Jack just laughs and stands his ground  
The Idiot Dunce the Idiot Dunce  
  
Yeah hes so uncoordinated  
Whoa and so disorientated  
And when we have a High School Hop  
You ought to see that idiot bop  
And his arms and his legs  
Seem to have minds of their own  
And you dont need brains  
To have educated muscles and bones  
  
Yeah you ought to see him dance  
He moves like hes in a trance  
And when we have a High School Hop  
You ought to see that idiot rock  
And hes finally proved  
That you dont need a high IQ  
To make your body move  
Now hes created a dance that everybodys trying to do  
Jack Jack the Idiot Dunce  
  
Do the Idiot Dunce  
All right put your finger on your nose  
Now cross those eyes  
Put your hands on your hips  
Now wriggle your backside  
Yes we got you dancing  
To the Idiot Jack  
From your head to the tips of your toes  
  
Now the whole worlds doing it and everybody knows  
Jack Jack the Idiot Dunce  
Hes a real cool cat and a real gone groove  
Jack Jack the Idiot Dunce  
  
And the girls go crazy when he starts to move  
Jack Jack the Idiot Dunce  
Now Jacks a success hes got nothing to prove  
Jack Jack the Idiot Dunce  
  
Even though Jack is dim  
His mother is so proud of him  
Hey whos that groovy looking dude  
Dancing with all the chicks  
The Idiot Dunce the Idiot Dunce
