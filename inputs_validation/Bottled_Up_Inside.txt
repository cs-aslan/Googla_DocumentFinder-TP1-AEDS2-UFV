It aint fading  
Man I got to let it out  
Am I quitting  
Screaming nothing ever comes out  
I keep feeling lost  
Ill never find my way out  
Im not thanking them  
Unless the truth can pour out  
  
Give me some courage  
Beating me down the  sometime  
Are you laughing at my body  
I hate and slide  
I hate and slide  
  
I take this time  
To let out whats inside  
Cause I will panic  
Sometimes I wish youd die  
Full of sorrow  
You may bestow my pride  
And all this hate is bottled up inside  
  
My heart is breaking  
Man you really ripped it out  
You take pleasure watching as I claw my way out  
  
The hurt rising  
Soon its going to tear my soul out  
Its not kosher feeling like Im on my way out  
  
Give me some courage  
Beating me down the  sometime  
Are you laughing at my body  
I hate and slide  
I hate and slide  
  
Ill take this time  
To let out whats inside  
Cause I will panic  
Sometimes I wish youd die  
Full of sorrow  
You may bestow my pride  
And all this hate is bottled up inside  
  
Feeling the haze as they cut down my spine  
Peeling your flesh like the way youve cut mine  
Do you feel happy you fucked up my mind  
Youre going to pay this time  
  
Ill take this time  
To let out whats inside  
Cause I will panic  
Sometimes I wish youd die  
Full of sorrow  
You may bestow my pride  
And all this hate is bottled up inside  
  
Ill take this time  
To let out whats inside  
Cause I will panic  
Sometimes I wish youd die  
Full of sorrow  
You may bestow my pride  
And all this hate is bottled up inside
