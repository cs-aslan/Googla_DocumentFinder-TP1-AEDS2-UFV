When your baby leaves you all alone  
And nobody call you on the phone  
Doncha feel like crying  
Doncha feel like crying like crying like crying  
Cmon baby cry to me  
  
When youre all alone in your lonely room  
And theres nothing but the smell of her perfume  
Doncha feel like crying  
Doncha feel like crying like crying like crying  
Cmon baby cmon cry to me  
  
Nothing could be sadder than a glass of wine alone  
Loneliness loneliness it just a waste of your time  
But you dont ever you dont ever have to walk alone  
You see so cmon take my hand  
Cmon walk with me  
  
When youre waiting for a voice to come  
In the night there is no one  
Doncha feel like crying  
Doncha feel like crying like crying like crying  
Cmon baby cry to me  
  
Cmon baby thats right cry to me  
Yes I want you to come on baby
