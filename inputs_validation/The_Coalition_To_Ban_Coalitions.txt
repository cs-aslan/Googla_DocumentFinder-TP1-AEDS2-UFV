This is a coalition to ban coalitions I aint a politician but Ive got views  
  
Some folks want to ban cars some want to get rid of Fender guitars  
  
Why dont you do your thing and we do our thing too  
  
Now they want to take my cigarettes and all my good whiskey  
  
And these damn coalitions theyre after you and me  
  
They want to get rid of my forty fours and all the are rated films  
  
If they only knew how much wed all love to get rid of them  
  
And this is a coalition to ban coalitions the views of a musician yeah Ive

Some folks want to ban cars some want to get rid of electricguitars  
  
Why cant everybody else leave everybody else alone  
  
Now the latest thing they want to stomp out is violence on tv  
  
And the worst of all is that Oscar winning rabbit Bugs Bunny  
  
Farewell Foghorn Leghorn so long Yosemite Sam
