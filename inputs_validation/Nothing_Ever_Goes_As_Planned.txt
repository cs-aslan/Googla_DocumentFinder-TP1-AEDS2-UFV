Whatcha going to do when the sun goes down tonight  
Youll hit the same old clubs rap that same old trash  
Thats right  
Youve got them real silk shirts and them baggy pants  
Dago shoes in the colors that match  
But the girls are acting bored  
And youre feeling like youre going to lose  
Youve got the GQ Blues  
  
You get up every morning and you go to work each day  
you go to work you go to work you go to work  
Been doing the same damn job for ten long years this May  
youve got to work youve got to work youve got to work  
Youve been working and saving for your Jamaican dream  
Paradise is waiting across the sea  
But when your plane lands Montego turns to Monsoon  
Youve got the Island Blues  
  
Cause nothing ever goes as planned  
Its a hell of a notion  
Even Pharaohs turn to sand  
Like a drop in the ocean  
Youre so together and you act so civilized  
But every time that things go wrong youre still surprised  
Youve done your duty youve paid a fortune in dues  
Still got those Mother Natures Blues  
  
I strut around the stage like a little king tonight  
Theyll scream for every word and every note thats right  
But when the show is over and Im all alone  
Cant reach my baby on the telephone  
And everywhere I look Mr Loneliness is in the news  
Ive got the Big Star Blues  
  
Boy nothing ever goes as planned  
Its a hell of a notion  
Even Pharaohs turn to sand  
Like a drop in the ocean  
Im so together and I act so civilized  
But every time that things go wrong  
Im still surprised  
Ive done my duty and paid a fortune in dues  
Still got them Mother Natures Blues
