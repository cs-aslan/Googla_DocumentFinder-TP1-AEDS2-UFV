So  the choice I have made  
May seem strange to you  
But who asked you anyway  
Its my life to wreck  
My own way  
  
You see  to someone somewhere oh yeah  
Alma matters  
In mind body and soul  
In part and in whole  
Because to someone somewhere oh yeah  
Alma matters  
In mind body and soul  
In part and in whole  
  
So the life I have made  
May seem wrong to you  
But Ive never been surer  
Its my life to ruin  
My own way  
  
You see  to someone somewhere oh yeah  
Alma matters  
In mind body and soul  
In part and in whole  
Because to someone somewhere oh yeah  
Alma matters  
In mind body and soul  
In part and in whole  
  
To someone somewhere oh yeah  
Alma matters  
In mind body and soul  
Part and in whole  
So to someone somewhere oh yeah   
Alma matters  
In mind body and soul  
Part and in whole  
  
To someone somewhere oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
Oh yeah
