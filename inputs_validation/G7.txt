Seven richest countries in the world  
Them have a little meeting  
Them a plan to keep and oppress the poor  
So them have a little meeting  
But when them think then thing goes another way  
Yes when them think then thing goes another way  
  
Did you hear about these meetings  
No you wont find poor countries there  
Because of capitalist greed  
Revolution seem to be the only way  
It may be an old fashion way of thinking  
But I believe in the people and these aims  
  
Cause when them think then things go the people way  
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh  
When them think then things go the the people way  
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh  
  
These countries want to stay on top  
So theyll find any way  
To them third world people life is but a small price to be paid  
They think theyre great feeling no one can touch them  
Well them have a next thing comin  
  
Cause when them think then things go the people way  
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh  
Oh when them think then thing goes another way  
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh  
  
Seven richest things in the world  
What do they do for the people  
Look at America the socalled best  
How many homeless  
Where the money went  
In the sky on weapons of death  
WHy dont they write the needy some more checks  
  
Cause when them think then thing goes another way  
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh  
When them think then things go the the people way  
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh
