Dolly Parton  
Bobbys arms they are warm when he holds me  
Bobbys arms always comfort and console me  
When Im in his arms held tight  
I know everythings alright  
Just as long as Im inside bobbys arms  
Chorus  
Bobbys arms always welcome me inside  
Bobbys arms always hold me when I cry  
Bobbys arms are my shelter from lifes storms  
And I feel so safe in Bobbys arms  
Bobbys arms they are strong but theyre tender  
Bobbys arms reach for me and I surrender  
When he reaches out for me Im never out of reach  
And I always want to be in Bobbys arms  
Repeat Chorus
