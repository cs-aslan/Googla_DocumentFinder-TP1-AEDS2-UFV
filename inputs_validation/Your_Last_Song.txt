Here I am  
Writing my last song for you  
Hear the words carefully  
And youll see its you  
Im leaving  
Dont want to be the one to tell you  
That I cant stay another day  
  
Ill throw the pages on the floor  
Im starting over like before  
Ill change this stupid ending  
And stay with you forever more  
But when Im lying next to you  
Its hard to bargain with the truth  
Cause when you know the love is gone  
The time has come to write your last song  
  
There you are  
Smiling at me from the next room  
Beautiful as the first day I met you  
And Im so sorry  
I couldnt be the one to love you  
The way that you deserve to be  
  
Ill throw the pages on the floor  
Im starting over like before  
Ill change this stupid ending  
And stay with you forever more  
But when Im lying next to you  
Its hard to bargain with the truth  
Cause when you know the love is gone  
The time has come to write your last song  
  
Its hard to think of you and I  
As total strangers  
Ive lived this last goodbye  
A million times or more in my mind  
My mind my mind  
  
Oh and Im gonna miss you  
But I cant go back  
Even just to kiss you  
Cause I cant exist  
Just living a lie  
Gotta lot of love to give  
You know before I die  
And as I watch you  
Sing along  
Its killing me to know  
That its your last song
