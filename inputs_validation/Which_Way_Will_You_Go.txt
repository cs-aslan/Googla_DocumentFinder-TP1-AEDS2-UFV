Baby you need to put that bottle down  
Put that gun back in the drawer  
I hear your mans been out there runnin round  
Youre hellbent to even up the score  
  
Dont let the devil get you by the throat  
You pull that trigger girl thats all she wrote  
Satans waitin for you down the road  
Oh which way will you go  
  
Your hands are shakin and your knees are weak  
Pistol pointed at the door  
Youre tired of wearin bruises on your cheek  
Bein treated like a whore  
  
Dont let the devil get you by the throat  
You pull that trigger girl thats all she wrote  
Well Satans waitin for you down the road  
Oh which way will you go  
  
And dont let the devil get you by the throat  
You pull that trigger girl thats all she wrote  
Well Satans waitin for you down the road  
Oh which way will you go  
  
Oh Heaven only knows  
  
Baby you need to put that bottle down  
Put that gun back in the drawer
