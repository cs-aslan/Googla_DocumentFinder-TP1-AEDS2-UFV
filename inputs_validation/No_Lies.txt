Oh  I got one thing to tell ya then you make up your mind  
Its what I been tryin to tell ya for a long long time  
We need each other to live in peace and harmony  
Dont need a whole lot to give cause love is for free  
  
I  I got one thing to tell ya  
I  oooo I aint tryin to sell ya  
No lies  
  
Forget all of your troubles for a minute or two  
Just listen to what Im sayin cause Im talkin to you  
We dont need no leader to tell us just whats wrong  
We need love in the country so we can get strong  
  
And I  oh you know I got one thing to tell ya  
I  oooo I aint tryin to sell ya  
No lies  
  
I  I got one thing to tell ya  
I  oooo I aint gonna sell ya  
No lies  
  
I  I got one thing to tell ya  
I  oooo I aint gonna sell ya  
No lies
