A thousand years Ive roamed the plains  
And waved the hand of doom  
Ive seen the tears that fall  
Like rain from the waste and all that ruin  
A shadows cast from me to you  
A time to claim  
All thats mine my wrath is blind  
The balance is where you hang  
  
Im the WidowMaker  
Im the Lord of the Wings  
Im the WidowMaker  
  
The cries of sadness never heard  
Fall deaf upon my ears  
The stench of madness raging wars  
Ive seen a million years  
The smell of sorrow fills the fields  
And lingers in the sky  
The littered ground will swallow down  
The souls that fill my eyes  
  
Im the WidowMaker  
Im the Lord of the Wings  
Im the WidowMaker  
  
Im the WidowMaker  
Im the Lord of the Wings  
Im the WidowMaker  
  
Im the WidowMaker  
Im the Lord of the Wings  
Im the WidowMaker
