And I knew I was close to you  
And I knew  
Catch me flying in the sun  
Catch me drinking of your wine  
  
Im gonna put something in you  
Make the devil feel surprised  
All your sisters wanna fly  
Around my golden sky  
Around my golden sky  
  
Just because you feel hollow insideits real  
Just because you feel hollow insideits real  
  
Im gonna put something in you  
Make the devil feel surprised  
Make the devil feel surprised  
  
And I knew I was close to you  
And I knew  
Catch me flying in the sun  
Catch me drinking of your wine
