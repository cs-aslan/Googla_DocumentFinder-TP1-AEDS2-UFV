Damn here we go again  
Common passed on this beat  
I made it to a jam  
Now everything Im not made me everything I am  
  
Damn here we go again  
People talkin shit but when the shit hit the fan  
Everything Im not made me everything I am  
  
Ill never be pictureperfect Beyonce  
Be light as Albi or black as Chauncey  
Remember him from blackstreet  
He was as black as the street was  
Ill never be as laid back as this beat was  
I never could see why peoplell reach a  
Fakeass versad that they couldnt keep up  
Ya see how I creeped up  
Ya see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah  
I never rock a mink coat in a winter time like Killa Cam  
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like WillIAm  
Let me know if you feel it man  
Cause everything Im not made me everything I am  
  
Damn here we go again  
Everybody sayin whats not for him  
Everything Im not made me everything I am  
  
Damn here we go again  
People talkin shit but when the shit hit the fan  
Everything Im not made me everything I am  
  
And Im back to tear it up  
Haters start your engines  
I hear em gearin up  
People talkin so much shit about me at barbershops  
They forget to get their haircut  
Okay fair enough the streets is flarin up  
Cause they want guntalk or I dont wear enough  
Baggy clothes Reeboks or Adidos  
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows  
So say goodbye to the NdoubleACP award  
Goodbye to the India Arie award  
Theyd rather give me the niggaplease award  
But Ill just take the Igotalot acheese award  
  
Damn here we go again  
Everything Im not made me everything I am  
  
Damn here we go again  
People talkin shit but when the shit hit the fan  
Everything Im not made me everything I am  
  
I know that people wouldnt usually rap this  
But I got the facts to back this  
Just last year Chicago had over six hundred caskets  
Man killins some wack shit  
Oh I forgot cept for when niggas is rappin  
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin  
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashlin  
I need to talk to somebody pastor  
The church want time so I cant afford to pay  
The slip on the door cause I cant afford to stay  
My 15 seconds up but I got more to say  
Thats enough Mr West please no more today  
  
Damn here we go again  
Everybody sayin whats not for him  
Everything Im not made me everything I am  
  
Damn here we go again  
People talkin shit but when the shit hit the fan  
Everything Im not made me everything I am
