You are the Lady in My Life  
  
Im a rich man  
They cut my lights off yesterday  
And I dont have the money to pay  
My baby lights a candlelight anyway  
So were OK  
Im a rich man  
But I dont have a job currently  
And thats just fine with my baby and me  
Cause we find other ways to keep busy  
You know what I mean  
  
Chorus  
Youre my diamond  
Baby I love the way you shine  
Shine baby Shine baby  
Your my diamond girl Im so glad to say youre mine  
  
Im a rich man  
But I dont have a car to drive  
And truthfully I dont even mind  
My baby walks around with me all the time oh yeah  
  
Im a rich man  
Said Im the wealthiest man in the world  
But Ive got no money no goals no string of pearls  
I dont need nothing as long as I got my girl  
Cause shes my world  
  
Repeat chorus
