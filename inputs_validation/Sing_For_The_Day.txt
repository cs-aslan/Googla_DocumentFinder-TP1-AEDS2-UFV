Hannah youre with me in spirit wherever I go  
To the ends of the earth and all points between high and low  
Each night by the stage you appear as you are  
The ever intangible child  
Ageless and timeless as Dorian Grey  
Oh Hannah I know that its you and youre leading me on  
  
Hannah youre my inspiration my fountain of youth  
And as your surrogate leader Im bound in your searach for the truth  
And yes how the truth rushes out  
When its become honestly clear  
I see your anxious and curious eyes  
But Hannah I need you as much as you think you need me  
Come to your window tonight and well fly to your dreams  
And well  
  
Sing for the day sing for the moment  
Sing for the time of your life  
Come for an hour stay for a moment  
Stay for the rest of your life  
  
Hannah dont fail me I need you like never before  
Father times at my back on my heels  
Behind every door and he says  
Son when the youth has but gone from your face  
Will she let you grow older with grace  
Or will she give you up for one younger than you  
Oh Hannah please tell me the things that he says are untrue  
Hannah Im honestly hoping youll always be there  
  
Sing for the day sing for the moment  
Sing for the time of your life  
Come for an hour stay for a moment  
Stay for the rest of your life
