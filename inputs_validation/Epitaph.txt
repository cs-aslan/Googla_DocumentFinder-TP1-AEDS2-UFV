The old mans sitting there his head bowed down  
Every now and then hell take a look around  
And his eyes reflect the memorypain of years gone by  
He cant regain nostalgic dreams hell never see again  
  
With trembling hands he wipes a tear  
Many fall like rain theres one for every year  
And his life laid out so clearly now life thats brought death  
So nearly now life once he clung to dearly now lets go  
  
But spare a thought as you pass him by  
Take a closer look and youll say  
Hes our tomorrow just as much as we are his yesterday  
  
A lonely grave and soon forgot  
Only wind and leaves lament his mournful song  
Yet they shout his epitaph out clear  
For anyone whos passing near  
It names the person lying here as you  
And you and you and you
