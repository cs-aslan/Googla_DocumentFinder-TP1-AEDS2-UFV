Questiontime that says I brought dishonour  
My heads bowed in shame  
It seems that Ive blackened the family name  
Mother says that she cant stand the neighbours talking  
Ive gotta pack my bags leave this home start walking yeah  
Im guilty  
I wish that I was sorry this time  
I wish that I could pay for my crime  
I cant help thinking about me  
I cant help thinking about me  
I cant help thinking about me  
Remember when we used to go to church on sundays  
I lay awake at night terrified of school on mondays  
Oh but its too late now  
I wish I was a child again  
I wish I felt secure again  
I cant help thinking about me  
I cant help thinking about me  
I cant help thinking about me  
As I pass a recreation ground  
I remember my friends always been found and I cant  
I cant help thinking about me  
I cant help thinking about me  
I cant help thinking about me  
Now I leave them all in the never never land  
The station seems so cold the tickets in my hand  
My girl calls my name hi dave  
Drop in see around come back  
If youre this way again  
Oh Im on my own  
Ive got a long way to go  
I hope I make it on my own  
I cant help thinking about me  
I cant help thinking about me  
I cant help thinking about me  
I cant help thinking about me  
I cant help thinking about me
