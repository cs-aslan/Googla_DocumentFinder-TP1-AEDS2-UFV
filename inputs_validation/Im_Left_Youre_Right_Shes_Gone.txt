Well youre right Im left shes gone  
Youre right and Im left all alone  
Well you tried to tell me so  
But how was I to know  
That she was not the one for me  
  
You told me all along  
Youre right our love was so wrong  
But now I changed my mind  
Because she broke the ties that bind  
And I know that she never cared for me  
  
Well I thought I knew just what shed do  
I guess Im not so smart  
Oh you tried to tell me along shed only break my heart  
Im left youre right shes gone  
Youre right and Im left all alone  
  
Well shes gone I know not where  
But now I just dont care  
For now Im falling for you  
  
If youll forgive me now  
Ill make it up somehow  
So happy we will be  
In a home just for three  
And Ill soon forget her  
Now I know  
  
Well I thought I knew just what shed do  
I guess Im not so smart  
You tried to tell me all along  
Shed only break my heart  
  
Well youre right Im left shes gone  
Youre right and Im left all alone  
Well shes gone I know not where  
But now I just dont care  
For now Ive fallen for you
