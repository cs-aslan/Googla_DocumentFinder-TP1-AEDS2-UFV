We were young we were brave we were true we were strong  
Far away the bombs an the buildings explodin  
there was no way out  
It was black it was white we had so much to say  
Right or wrong The truth wont fade away  
  
We had our hopes we had our dreams we were young we were old  
We saw our future selfdestructing there were roles that we played  
Some were good some were bad there was so much to say  
Right or wrong The truth wont fade away
