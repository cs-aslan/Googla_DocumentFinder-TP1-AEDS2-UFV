Janie Janie Janie Janie Jane Jane  
Down in the alley just you and me  
Were going bowlin till half past three  
Just rockin and reelin well get that feelin  
Down in the alley oh baby gee  
  
I wake you now and dig you later  
Cause youre a fine sweet potato  
Well have a ball and that aint all  
Down in the alley just you and me  
  
The clock is striking a mournful sound  
This time of evening my love comes down  
Thats when Im missin your kind of kissin  
Down in the alley thats where Ill be  
  
Down in the alley we sure have fun  
We just get started bout half past one  
So if youre round just come on down  
Down in the alley and you will see
