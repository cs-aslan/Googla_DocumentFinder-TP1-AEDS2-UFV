Crushing cheating changing  
Am I deaf or dead  
Is this constricting construction  
Or just streets with rusty signs  
Of something violent coming  
  
Thisll hurt you worse than me  
Im weak seven days Im weak  
Dont run from me I wont  
Bother counting one two three  
  
I dont know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
I dont know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
  
Show myself how to make a noose  
A guns cliche and a razor too  
Im not a death share vacation vacant station  
Made of scars and filled with my old wounds  
  
Thisll hurt you worse than me  
Im weak seven days Im weak  
Dont run from me I wont  
Bother counting one two three  
  
I dont know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
I dont know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
  
You you dont even want to know what Im gonna do to you  
You dont even want to know what Im gonna do to you  
You dont even want to know what Im gonna do to you  
You dont even want to know what Im gonna do to you  
  
I dont know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
I dont know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
  
No Reflection  
No Reflection  
  
Ive got no reflection
