Aint gonna ride that whisky train  
Aint gonna burn up no more flame  
Throw away my bottle down the drain  
Aint gonna ride that whisky train  
To think that i could be so wrong  
To be so sick and still go on  
The way i drink its been too long  
Dont see much point in carrying on  
Im gonna lose these drinking blues  
  
Im gonna find a girl to make me choose  
Between lovin her and drinking booze  
Im gonna lose these drinking blues  
Aint gonna ride that whisky train  
Im tired of burning in the flame  
Throw away my bottle down the drain  
Aint gonna ride that whisky train
