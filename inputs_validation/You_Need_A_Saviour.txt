Made a friend last night or you thought you did  
Had a drink had a talk took a drive  
Shared the night gave up a part of your soul  
Now shes gone and youre a little less alive  
Shake it off never let your feelings begin  
But your defenses are down and the fear is closing in  
  
Chorus  
Yes you really need a saviour  
Somehow youve known it all along  
Yes you really need a saviour  
You know youve heard it for so long  
Yes You really need a saviour  
Someone to come and lead you on  
You need a saviour  
You need a saviour  
Its time  
  
Told yourself today just for your own sake  
What was lost wouldnt cost anyway  
Lifes a one night stand this time youll win  
The up and down lifelong game that you play  
  
Shake it off never let your feelings begin  
But your defenses are down and the fear is closing in  
  
Chorus
