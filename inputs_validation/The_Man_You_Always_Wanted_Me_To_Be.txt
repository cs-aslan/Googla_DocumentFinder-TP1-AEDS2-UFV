What have I become  
What am I running away from  
I used to see  
Things in a very different way  
  
What am I to do  
I have changed my point of view  
I was lost  
Now Ive found myself in you  
  
From some other part of me  
Ill summon the strength to see me through  
From deep in the heart of me  
To be anything you want me to  
And thats when I start to be  
The man youve always seen in me  
The man you always wanted me to be  
  
What have we become  
What are we running away from  
We need to see  
Life in a very different way  
  
Learning what to do  
After all that weve been through  
No longer lost  
We have found ourselves anew  
  
From some other part of me  
Ill summon the strength to see me through  
From deep in the heart of me  
To be anything you want me to  
And thats when I start to be  
The man youve always seen in me  
The man you always wanted me to be  
  
Eeyeah eeyeah eeyeah eeyeah eeyeah  
  
The man you always wanted me to be  
The man you always wanted me to be  
  
Eeyeah eeyeah eeyeah eeyeah eeyeah
