I can wait to love in heaven  
I can wait for you  
Far away Ill treat you better  
Better than down here  
Cause I done wrong  
And Im a little afraid  
I aint too strong  
And this aint easy to say  
Take this bottle  
Take this bottle  
And just walk awaythe both of you  
And let me feel the painIve done to you  
I can hope well be together  
With a better roof over our heads  
I can hope the stormy weather  
It passes onit passes on  
But Ive hoped too long  
Hoped for me to change  
That hope is gone  
So listen to what I say  
Take this bottle
