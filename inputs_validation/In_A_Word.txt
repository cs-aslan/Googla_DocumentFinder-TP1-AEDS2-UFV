Stop taking for granted  
I am the one whos wrong  
You might be surprised  
Time standin still  seems like we dont belong  
Youll realize  
Start giving to me all you can  
Stop telling me girl just where I stand  
  
Chorus  
Its your turn you should show what you know to me  
One Ive not heard before  
My concern you cant tell what you know to me  
You cant say it all in a word  
  
Life turns around  
Time not to look away  
And face what you see  
Truth shows itself  watch everything you say  
When youre talking to me  
You find yourself just in time  
No dont be afraid of what youll find on the way  
  
Chorus  
Its your turn you should show what you know to me  
One Ive not heard before  
My concern you cant tell what you know to me  
You cant say it all in a word  
  
Its your turn you should show what you know to me  
One Ive not heard before  
My concern you cant tell what you know to me  
You cant say it all in a word  
  
Instrumental break  
  
Chorus  
Its your turn you should show what you know to me  
One Ive not heard before  
My concern you cant tell what you know to me  
You cant say it all in a word  
No you cant say it all in one word
