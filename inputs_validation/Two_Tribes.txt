The air attack warning sounds like  
This is the sound  
When you hear the air attack warning You and your family must take cover  
  
Loves gone oh  
  
When two tribes go to war  
One is all that you can score  
Score no more score no more  
When two tribes go to war  
One is all that you can score  
Workin for the black mask

Comrad number one  
A born again poor mans son  
Poor mans son

Workin for the black mask  
  
Switch up your shield  
Switch up and feel

When two tribes go to war  
One is all that you can score  
When two tribes go to war

Somethin this good died

Horror are the new gods  
  
When two tribes go to war  
One point is all that you can score
