I think I might be a fortune teller  
I read your face just like a letter  
The funny thing about forever  
Is it comes with a side of never never  
  
I cant buy into what youre selling  
And no its not that I dont want it  
Believe me I love to close my eyes enjoy the ride  
But you reek of bad decisions and I  
  
I know I know I know  
I know I know I know  
  
Chorus  
Youre only gonna let me down  
When it counts you countdown  
Youre only gonna turn me out  
As I burn you burn out  
Youre only gonna make me feel so crazy  
But when I think we could be something  
You go and let me down let me down oh  
  
I am too smart to let you in here  
But Im just dumb enough to linger  
I wanna think that youll be different  
Smoking mirrors are so clever clever  
  
I picked him and things went so bad  
Then what you say will actually happen  
Ive been dying to open my eyes  
See you try instead of always leaving me out to dry  
  
I know I know  
  
Chorus  
  
I need you to be there when you say youre gonna be  
I care too much and you care enough to leave  
I want some place to rest my head without worrying  
Its not fair its not fair its not fair its not fair  
Its not fair to me cause I know by now  
  
Chorus x2
