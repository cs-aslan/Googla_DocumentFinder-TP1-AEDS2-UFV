You said wed light the firmament  
You said our love was permanent  
You said wed stick through thick and thin  
Through up and down through lose and win  
But comes the first sign of stormy weather  
Youre packin your bags in the trance  
But you gotta give  
  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
To our romance  
  
you cant pretend its Camelot  
Then start to run when things get hot  
When love explodes theres always heat  
Theres always bitter with the sweet  
Theres always times when your legs feel broken  
But you still dont drop out of the dance  
You gotta give  
  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
To our romance
