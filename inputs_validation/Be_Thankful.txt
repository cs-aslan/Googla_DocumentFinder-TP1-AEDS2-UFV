No food in da fridge but we wuznt alarmed

Just be thankful 4 day 2 day

Frum da maternity ward 2 tha morgue

Its a game I shood but cant afford but i aint stressin  
Im ESin 4 mines its all gunna pay off in da long run  
An no rest on da grind man a nigga just out here on one  
Stayin strong all alone or hangin wit my clique

My motto wuz my ancha an 4 dat I cant thak ya enuff
