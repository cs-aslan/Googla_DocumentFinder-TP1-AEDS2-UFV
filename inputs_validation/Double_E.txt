Back in the country living on the Double E  
In the sunshine of her life  
Theres already a young fellow but Mom and Daddy wont let her leave  
Mom and Poppa wont let her go  
  
But when they go out dancin  
She breaks out on her own  
Shes hot enough to burn the house down  
But Mom and Poppa dont know  
  
When Edith and Earl renamed the Double E  
They nearly made history  
The locals rose up some of them were mad as hell  
Cause it used to be the Double L  
  
Change comes slow in the country  
When youre new theres a lot of distrust  
Years fly by uneventful  
Memories turn to dust  
  
Meanwhile Granny has got her bright colors on  
And the suns shinin in her eyes  
Cruisin by the bars and honkytonks where she met Grandpa  
And caught that young mans eye  
  
Dusty white El Dorado  
Cruisin through the trees  
Slippin through the shadows  
Of what used to be  
  
Back in the days living in the summer of love  
Living in the summer of love  
Grandmas okay not the same since Grandpas gone  
Shes living in the summer of love  
  
Back in the days living in the summer of love  
Living in the summer of love  
Living in the summer of love  
Living in the summer of love  
  
Back in the days living in the summer of love  
Living in the summer of love
