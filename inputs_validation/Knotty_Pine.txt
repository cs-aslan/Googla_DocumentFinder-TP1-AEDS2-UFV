Shes my knotty pine  
She leans with the wind  
She cries turpentine  
Sometimes she nettles me  
But I dont mind  
Only now and then  
When her branches lean beneath the snow  
Shes knotty but nice  
Reaching for the sky  
She dont like snow n ice  
To leave things as they stand  
Is my advice  
Shes been good to me  
So I tend to go there when I can  
Shes my knotty pine  
Such a pretty scene  
She tries to be kind  
She gives birds a home  
And shelters them  
In her coat of green  
Shes as green as evergreen can be  
Shes a real delight  
When little breezes call  
To ruffle up her skin  
All her sap runs free  
And sticks to me  
Hidden deep within  
I will be her slave eternally  
Shes my knotty pine  
She leans with the wind  
She crys turpentine  
Sometimes she nettles me  
But I dont mind  
Only now and then  
When her branches lean beneath the snow
