Theres something wrong with me I dont know  
If its not just inside my head  
It feels like Im walking through a dream  
I still remember what you said  
I know that everything will be alright  
Its going to work out for the best  
I think there must be something better still  
It isnt really so farfetched  
  
You know Ill go running out  
And ruin everything  
You know Ill go running out  
And ruin everything  
  
Its hard to trust in somebody else  
Responsible for your success  
But in the end I know its up to me  
I live my life with no regrets  
So tell me everything I want to hear  
What do you like about me best  
Ive been a king and Ive been a fool  
Im not about to give up yet  
  
You know Ill go running out  
And ruin everything  
You know Ill go running out  
And ruin everything  
  
Ive had enough of the promises  
Ive had enough of empty threats  
Some people wait for opportunity  
Why should I wait I havent yet  
I want to burn down the prejudice  
I want to destroy the evidence  
Is all that really matters what youre worth  
Then what is it worth for your two cents  
  
You know Ill go running out  
And ruin everything  
You know Ill go running out  
And ruin everything
