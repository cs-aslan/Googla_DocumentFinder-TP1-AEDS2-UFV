It cannot be seen  
But theres blood on the green  
Only god knows Im innocent  
Take me take me home  
A dark seed reigns in me  
Like the storm rules over the sea  
I challenge thee do not cross this bridge alone  
  
Dont dare me now  
The threatening shadows will pass by  
Therere getting closer now  
Open your eyes  
Wake up my dear young friend  
And hate shall fade away  
  
I will not move yet  
Ill stand still instead  
  
There on the battlefield he stands  
Down on the battlefield hes lost  
And on the battlefield it ends  
  
War and anger shall reign  
The clash of iron can be heard  
By blindness youre driven insane  
Im lost in anguish and grief  
Sorrow wont wane til you die  
A shattered body deeply hurt  
And darkness will cover the light  
Its gone forevermore  
  
The fields been left in sorrow  
The father and the son  
Theyre gone  
  
The sun shines bright  
And anger rises  
Lorn and lonely  
Torn apart  
Dont you think  
Its time to stop now  
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpents kiss  
  
Lets pray  
That heaven is on our side  
Through violence and horror  
Shall honour arise  
  
So lets pray  
And blessed shall be our leader  
We follow the noble and bright  
  
Dont you hear me crying  
Crying  
Come take me away  
I hallow thy name  
  
There on the battlefield he stands  
Down on the battlefield hes lost  
And on the battlefield it ends  
  
War and anger shall reign  
The clash of iron can be heard  
By blindness youre driven insane  
Im lost in anguish and grief  
Sorrow wont wane til you die  
A shattered body deeply hurt  
And darkness will cover the light  
Its gone forevermore  
  
Thats what minstrel sing  
Join in the horrible screams  
Take part in murderous deeds  
Renowned be the lionhearted  
Join in the minstrelsy  
Wailing in endless grief  
It eagerly longs for more  
Broken bodies lay down on the ground  
  
Blood sheds all over the place  
The green will be stained forever  
And hate reigns all over the field  
They keep struggling on in anger  
  
Fiercely intense  
Outrageous too blind to see  
And in pain they keep on singing  
We claim the land for the highlord  
God bless the land and our highlord  
  
War and anger shall reign  
The clash of iron can be heard  
By blindness youre driven insane  
Im lost in anguish and grief  
Sorrow wont wane til you die  
A shattered body deeply hurt  
And darkness will cover the light  
Its gone forevermore
