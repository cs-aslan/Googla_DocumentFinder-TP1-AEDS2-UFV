Sister Bluebird flying high above  
Shine your wings forward to the sun  
Hide the mystries of life on your way  
Though youve seen them please dont say a word  
What you dont know I have never heard  
  
Starship Trooper go sailing on by  
Catch my soul catch the very night  
Hide the moment from my eager eyes  
Though youve seen them please dont tell a soul  
What you cant see cant be very whole  
  
Speak to me of summer long winters longer than time can remember  
Setting up of other roads travel on in old accustomed ways  
I still remember the talks by the water the proud sons and daughters that  
In the knowledge of the land spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways  
  
Mother life hold firmly on to me  
Catch my knowledge higher than the day  
Lose as much as only you can show  
Though youve seen them please dont say a word  
What I dont know I have never shared  
  
Loneliness is a power that we possess to give or take away forever  
All I know can be shown by your acceptance of the fact there shown before you  
Take what I say in a diffrent way and its easy to see that this is all
confusion  
As I see a new day in me I can also show if you and you may follow  
  
Speak to me of summer long winters longer than time can remember  
Setting up of other roads travel on in old accustomed ways  
I still remember the talks by the water the proud sons and daughters that  
In the knowledge of the land spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways
