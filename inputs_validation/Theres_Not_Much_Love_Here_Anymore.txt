Rain rain come on down  
Youre so welcome at my door  
Come on down and ease the pain  
I never hurt this bad before  
  
Tears keep falling from my eyes  
And all I do is walk the floor  
Its not too hard to realize  
Theres not much love here anymore  
  
Chorus x3  
Rain rain come blowin in  
Come wash these tears away again  
Leavin has cut me to the core  
Theres not much love here anymore
