Sling your hook in with him baby  
Hes a real sharpshooter now  
If hes out there hiding in the tall grass  
Tell him I said he was a coward  
  
This aint any old western honey  
Its the twentieth century now  
But if he thinks hes some kind of tough cowboy  
And hes hurt her then I want to know how  
  
Did he shoot her with his compromise  
Like a heart attack he can paralyze  
Or did he hang her in a noose  
On the telephone line  
  
Did he shoot her with a forty five  
Did he leave his mark right between her eyes  
Oh did he shoot that girl  
That used to be mine  
  
Tell him Im ready any time he chooses  
The payoff for the things for the things hes done  
He aint messing with no twobit bandit  
Armed with a couple of guns  
  
If he wants to see it as a two reel movie  
Hes living in the head of someone else  
But better take him down and dust him honey  
I want to hear the truth for myself  
  
Did he shoot her  
Did he shoot her
