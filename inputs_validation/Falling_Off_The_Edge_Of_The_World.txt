I think about closing the door  
And lately I think of it more  
Im living well out of my time  
I feel like Im losing my mind  
  
I should be at the table round  
A servant of the crown  
The keeper of the sign  
To sparkle and to shine  
  
Never no never again  
Listen to me and believe what I say if you can  
Never this is the end  
You know Ive seen the faces of doom and Im only a man  
Help me tell me Im sane  
I feel a change in the earth in the wind and the rain  
Save me take me away  
You know Ive seen some creatures from hell and Ive heard what they say  
  
Ive got to be strong  
Oh Im falling off the edge of the world  
Think youre safe but youre wrong  
We are falling off the edge of the world  
  
Look out theres danger no where to run  
It seems like desperate measures but sometimes it has to be done  
Over its over at last  
Theres a message inside as we build a new life from the past  
  
Were falling off the edge of the world  
Yes the edge of the world  
Its the end of the world
