You illuminate me  
Youre the color I see  
Youre all the shines above  
Through the dark and mistrust  
  
All the doubt in your eyes  
All the stars in the night  
Is it the distance you need  
Or is it just me  
  
I know youre awake  
Cause you shake when you cry  
As long as I wait  
Ive got nothing but time  
  
Take me in or just take me out  
Put me on if you must or just put me down  
Cause Im done Im all worn out  
Were either alive or a lie  
Im done with the middle ground  
  
Youre the wind at my back  
Youre the courage I lack  
But you live your life like a war  
What are you fighting for  
  
Your touch is the water  
That gives and takes away  
So I wait in the gutter  
For another rainy day  
  
Take me in or just take me out  
Put me on if you must or just put me down  
Cause Im done Im all worn out  
Were either alive or a lie  
Im done with the middle ground  
  
You close your eyes to see the sun  
And all the things youve never done  
They all come out in the dark  
And once again just break your heart  
  
I know youre awake  
Cause you shake when you cry  
Ill hold you Ill hold you  
But youve got to decide  
  
Take me in or just take me out  
Put me on if you must or just put me down  
Cause Im done Im all worn out  
Were either alive or a lie oh  
Were either alive or a lie  
Im done with the middle ground  
  
Im done with the middle ground  
Im done with the middle ground  
Done with the middle ground  
  
Im done with the middle ground  
Im done with the middle ground
