The power of reason the top of the heap  
Were the ones who can kill the things we  
Dont eat  
Sharper than a serpents tongue  
Tighter than a bongo drum  
Quicker than a onenight stand  
Slicker than a mambo band  
And now the day is come  
Soon he will be released  
Glory hallelujah  
Were building the perfect beast  
building building etc  
Its olympus this time olympus or bust  
For we have met the enemy and he is us  
And now the day is come  
Soon he will be released  
Glory hallelujah  
Were building the perfect beast  
building building  
Ever since we crawled out of the ocean  
And stood upright on the land  
There are some things that we just dont  
Understand  
Relieve all pain and suffering  
And lift us out of the dark  
Turn us all into methuselah  
But where are we gonna park  
building building  
The secrets of eternity  
Weve found the lock and turned the key  
Were shakin up those building blocks  
Going deeper into that box pandora  
Wouldnt like it  
And now the day is come  
Soon he will be released  
Glory hallelujah  
Were building the perfect beast  
building building  
All the way to malibu from the land of the  
Talking drum  
Just look how farlook how far weve come
