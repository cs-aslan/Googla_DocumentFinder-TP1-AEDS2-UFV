Give me no restrictions on what I do or say  
Dont speak of tomorrow when its still today  
Leave me to my selfish ways Im well enough alone  
That is what I tell myself as I stumble home  
Derelict across the street in the garbage bin  
Looks like hes found something neat judging by his grin  
Such a long long way to go hope I get there soon  
Wish I could jump a great height and land in my front room  
  
WhoaohohWhoaohoh  
  
Wake up in the morning make sure Im still alive  
Percolate the coffee opens up my eyes  
Hear the cricket calling switch on the TV  
Sit and stare for hours and cheer Dennis Lillee  
  
WhoaohohWhoaohoh  
  
Through the derestriction zone we pass a long wide load  
Laugh at the reflections of cats eyes on the road  
Freeways hypnotize me up up and away  
Hope we make it home tonight  
Be that as it may  
  
WhoaohohWhoaohoh
