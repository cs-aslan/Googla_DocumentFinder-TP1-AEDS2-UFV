I keep getting attacked by  
The girl in the black hat  
The girl in the black hat  
  
I cant find any shade but  
Ill be swayed as long as  
I got a switchblade  
  
I keep getting the eye from  
The girl in the thigh highs  
The girl in the thing highs  
  
With irises of jade are built  
To persuade and theyre  
Swift like a switchblade  
  
Switchblade switchblade  
Theyre swift like a switchblade  
Switchblade  
  
Nobody wears it like you anymore  
Nobody wears it like you anymore  
  
Light like a feather  
Bright like a dying star  
Cut those together  
Girl that is what you are  
Wild eyes forever  
Built to punish and persuade  
I like together  
But all I got was a switchblade  
Switchblade  
  
So just gimme the facts  
Whos the girl in the black hat  
The girl in the black hat  
  
I cant find any shade but  
Ill be swayed as long as  
Ive got a switchblade  
  
I think Im getting a rise  
On all her American thighs  
Her American thighs  
  
She got her black hat  
And irises of jade  
And I got a switchblade  
Switchblade
