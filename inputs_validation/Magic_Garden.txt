There is a garden  
Something like the shadow of a butterfly  
And lies beyond the gates of dark and light  
And darling it belongs to me  
  
And when you go there  
There will be such laughter in the dimpled sky  
The songs you sing  
Will drive away the night  
The magic garden  
Has a way of making you feel free  
  
Its the place Ive made for you  
From matchboxes and cards and dominoes  
And it wont fall down  
And when your dreaming vanishes  
Like snowflakes in the summer sky  
Melts away in darkness  
And you dont know why the magic garden  
Waits without the gates wide open  
And darlin Ill be standin just inside  
  
And when your dreaming vanishes  
Like snowflakes in the summer sky  
Melts away in darkness  
And you dont know why the magic garden  
Waits without the gates wide open  
And darlin Ill be standin just inside  
  
Its so soft and warm  
Behind those hedges  
No hard edges  
No hard edges  
  
There is a garden  
Vanishes like snowflakes in the summer sky  
Melts away in darkness  
And you dont know why the magic garden  
Waits without the gates wide open  
And darlin Ill be standin just inside
