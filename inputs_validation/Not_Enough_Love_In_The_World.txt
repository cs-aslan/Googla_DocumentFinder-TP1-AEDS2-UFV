Sometimes I wonder where it is love goes  
I dont know if even Heaven knows  
But I know you had some dreams that didnt quite come true  
Now Im not the one little girl whos keeping you  
  
I was either standing in your shadow or  
Blocking your light  
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right  
For you girl  
Theres just not enough love in the world  
  
I know people hurt you so bad  
They dont know the damage they can do  
And it makes me so sad  
How we knock each other down just like  
Children on a playground  
Even after that ol sun went down  
  
I was either standing in your shadow or  
Or blocking your light  
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right  
For you girl  
Theres just not enough love in the world  
  
Oh darlin baby this is still a shady little town  
And sometimes its so hard to smile  
For the world for the camera  
And still have something left  
You dont have to prove nothin to nobody  
Just take good care of yourself  
  
Im not easy to live with  
I know that its true  
Youre no picnic either babe  
Thats one of the things I loved about you  
Time will come around when we need to settle down  
Got to get of this merrygoround  
  
I was either standing in your shadow or  
Blocking youre light  
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right  
For you girl  
Theres just not enough love in the world  
For you girl  
Theres just not enough love in the world  
Not enough love in the world  
In the world  
In the world  
In the world
