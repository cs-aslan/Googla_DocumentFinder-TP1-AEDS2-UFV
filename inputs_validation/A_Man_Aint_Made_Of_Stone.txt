I was supposed to be the rock  
That you could stand on  
Stronger than an old oak tree  
But all you ever wanted was the one thing  
That I never let you see   
The tender side of me  
  
I tried to be a mountain  
Solid and strong  
All it took was your leavin  
To know I was wrong  
  
Chorus  
A man aint made of stone  
A man aint made of steel  
The way I feel right now  
I thought Id never feel  
And sometimes all it takes  
Is facing the night alone  
And thats when you know  
A man aint made of stone  
  
In this world of mine there was  
No room for weakness  
I covered every crack in the wall  
But there aint no way that I can  
Keep this secret  
Cause when you go  
Like Cheriko I fall  
  
You thought I wouldnt shatter  
Would I even care  
But theres more to what Im made of  
Than this broken heart can bear  
  
Repeat chorus  
Sometimes all it takes  
Is facing the night alone  
And thats when you know  
A man aint made of stone
