Ive still got a lot to learn  
But at least I know where I can turn  
When Im in my times of need  
Just as long  
As I know all things are possible  
Just as long as I believe  
  
Ive loved a lot hurt a lot  
Been burned a lot in my life and times  
Spent precious years wrapped up in fear  
With no end in sight  
Until my saving grace shined on me  
Until my saving grace set me free  
  
Giving me peace  
Giving me strength when Id  
Almost lost it all  
Catching my every fall  
I still exist because you keep me safe  
I found my saving grace within you  
  
Yes Ive been bruised  
Grew up confused  
Been destitute  
Ive seen life from many sides  
Been stigmatized  
Been black and white  
Felt inferior inside  
Until my saving grace shined on me  
Until my saving grace set me free  
  
Giving me peace  
Giving me strength when Id  
Almost lost it all  
Catching my every fall  
I still exist because you keep me safe  
I found my saving grace within you  
  
And the bountiful things that you do  
Lord thank you  
For delivering me  
  
And giving me peace  
Giving me strength  
Giving me hope when Id  
Almost lost it all  
Catching my every fall  
I still exist because you keep me safe  
Always my saving grace  
Pulls me through  
I found my saving grace within you  
  
Yes you are  youre my every everything  
Within you  
Only only you  
Yes lord  
Only you  
My saving grace lord is  
You
