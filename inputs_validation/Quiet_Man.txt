Strolling down the highway with my shoes in my hand  
I dont talk much Im a quiet man  
Beauty and silence both run deep  
And running like crazy while you are alseep  
  
Chorus  
You got news for meI got nothing for you  
Dont pin your blues on me  
Just go ahead and do whatever you wish to  
Last Monday night I saw a fight  
  
Between Wednesday and Thursday over Saturday night  
Tuesday asked me what was going on I said  
Sundays in the meadow and Fridays in the corn  
  
Chorus  
  
Hocuspocus Maladjusted  
Dont you think my tears get rusted  
Steady losing means you aint using  
What you really think is right  
  
Chorus  
  
Oodles of light what a beautiful sight  
Both of Gods eyes are shining tonight  
Rays and beams of incredible dreams  
And I am a quiet man  
  
Oodles of light what a beautiful sight  
Both of Gods eyes are shining tonight  
Rays and beams of incredible dreams  
And I am a quiet man  
  
Oodles of light what a beautiful sight  
Both of Gods eyes are shining tonight  
Rays and beams of incredible dreams  
And I am a quiet man
