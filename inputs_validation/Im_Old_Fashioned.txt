I am not such a clever one  
About the latest fads  
I admit I was never one  
Adored by local lads  
  
Not that I ever try to be a saint  
Im the type that they classify as quaint  
  
Im old fashioned  
I love the moonlight  
I love the old fashioned things  
  
The sound of rain  
Upon a window pane  
The starry song that April sings  
  
This years fancies  
Are passing fancies  
But sighing sighs holding hands  
These my heart understands  
  
I know Im old fashioned  
But I dont mind it  
Thats how I want to be  
As long as you agree  
To stay old fashioned with me  
  
Im old fashioned  
But I dont mind it  
Thats how I want to be  
As long as you agree  
To stay old fashioned with me  
  
Oh wont you stay old fashioned with me  
Oh please stay old fashioned with me
