Uncle Jeff played the fiddle in his Colorado home  
And I backed him on the banjo so he didnt play alone  
Weve got five generations of a fiddle playin clan  
And its nice to hear a fiddle by a fiddle playin man  
  
Heres another song for Uncle Jeff Guthrie  
Written on the road by the light of the moon  
Thinkin bout fiddlin somewhere up in Michigan  
I hope that I can make it back to Colorado soon  
  
Well my daddy had a fiddle and he laid it on his son  
Sayin Son play the fiddle like your fiddlin folks done  
Well its hard to learn to fiddle  
When youre fiddlin on the run  
But fiddlin is fiddlin and fiddlin is fun
