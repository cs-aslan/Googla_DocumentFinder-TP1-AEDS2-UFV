I know yall listen to my music red eyes  
But what Im a do know is try and describe my life to yall  
  
Sometimes I fell like Im loosing it  
My life is upside down  
A gift and a curse thats my life now  
There is no looking or turning back  
I used to watch coke turn to crack thats what made me turn to rap  
I fell like Keanu Reeves in the movie Devils Advocate  
Confused but blessed with extravagance  
I thank god for all the opportunities  
Given the opportunity dem boys would put two in me bla bla bla  
We live in the land of the free hustlers and thieves  
I made money now I got uncle Sam hustling  
Me for a quarter of what I make  
Hand a quarter sentence to a fake and watch them turn state thats right  
Blood is thicker than water at least they say it is  
Until the feds step in thats just the way it is  
Most of these fools are characters  
Men with no character welcome to America  
Where we fight for freedom  
If aint about oil than we dont need them  
Aint that the truth  
Pitbull Im just tell yall the way I fell  
Thank god that god made me to keep it real  
  
Chorus  
Blood is thicker than water at least they say it is  
Until the feds step in that just the way it is  
Blood is thicker than water at least they say it is  
Till that fame step in thats just the way it is  
Blood is thicker than water at least they say it is  
Till dem bitches step in thats just the way it is  
Blood is thicker than water at least they say it is  
Till that money step in thats just the way it is  
  
Huh hun yo  
After the turf war the smoke clears  
All these years around these busta Im convinced there aint no hope here  
In the past four years of my lifetime  
I witness leaders sacrifice freedom just to get this pipeline  
Guess Im chosen at the right time mama stress  
Facing the table and shes snorting up white line  
Blood is thicker than water  
In a few cases your daughter can have touched for the money that in dem suit
case  
Tighten my shoelaces the fugitive running  
In fear of a criminal past cause dem folks is coming  
Ive been wrongfully judged being from this environment  
The city gangs planning retirement  
Im a a Dade nigga  
Voicing my set cause a spray quick  
Took some of the same steps through little Haiti  
As these main nigga like who hit man big dog and she hound  
Yall predict it back then shit I see it know  
  
Chorus  
  
I escape poverty poverty  
I dont own jewelry motherfucker I own property  
You can send dem tsunamis that hit Indonesia but but but  
Aint no motherfucking thing stopping me  
Like good coke Im a good swimmer  
God knows I done lost but god dam Im a good winner  
It feels great to make something out of nothing  
Yea Im humble but I tell yall to push a chicos buttons  
And watch how them thing get to dumping  
Real estate New York game now you saying something  
I only talk about what I know about  
Illegal turn legal this year thats what Im all about  
Im from the south and I aint gonna lie  
At fist time I preach ye till god struck me with pride  
I was confused now Im like lets ride  
Three o five till I die  
Three o five till I die  
  
Chorus
