Underneath the lantern  
By the barrack gate  
Darling I remember  
The way you used to wait  
Twas there that you whispered tenderly  
That you loved me  
Youd always be  
My Lili of the lamplight  
My own Lili Marlene  
  
Time would come for roll call  
Time for us to part  
Darling Id caress you  
And press you to my heart  
And there neath that far off lantern light  
Id hold you tight  
Wed kiss good night  
My Lili of the lamplight  
My own Lili Marlene  
  
Orders came for sailing  
Somewhere over there  
All confined to barracks  
Twas more than I could bear  
I knew you were waiting in the street  
I heard your feet  
But could not meet  
My Lili of the lamplight  
My own Lili Marlene  
  
Resting in our billet  
Just behind the line  
Even though were parted  
Your lips are close to mine  
You wait where that lantern softly gleamed  
Your sweet face seems  
To haunt my dreams  
My Lili of the lamplight  
My own Lili Marlene  
My Lili of the lamplight  
My own Lili Marlene
