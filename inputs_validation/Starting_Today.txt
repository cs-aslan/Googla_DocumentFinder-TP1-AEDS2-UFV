Starting today  
Im not gonna waste another moment  
Even if I had had the chance before  
I would have blown it  
  
But you took me by surprise  
And you caught me just in time  
  
Everyday  
You give me reason not to walk away  
Ill stop believing that the worlds gone crazy  
And if it is youll save me  
  
Starting Today  
Im not gonna worry about tomorrow  
Ill wash away  
All this fear thats left me feeling hollow  
  
Cause you make me want to try  
And you caught me just in time  
  
Everyday  
You give me reason not to walk away  
Ive stopped believing  
I should run like crazy  
Cause if I did youd chase me anyway  
  
I should of told you so many times  
But I shied away  
Somehow you always seem to  
Be there making it easy  
And you give me reason to stay everyday  
  
Ooh everyday everyday  
Ive stopped believing  
I should run like crazy  
Cause if I did youd chase me anyway  
  
You give me reason not to walk away  
Ive stopped believing  
That the worlds gone crazy  
And if it is youll save me  
  
Starting today  
Im not gonna waste another moment
