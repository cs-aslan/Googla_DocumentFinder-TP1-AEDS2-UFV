Have yourself an Ozzy little Christmas  
Give a bat a bite  
Decorate your devil head with twinkling lights  
Ozzy Christmas Ozzy family Christmas  
Have yourself an Ozzy little Christmas  
Let the F word fly  
From now on those censors will be up all night  
All those bad words motherbleeping bad words  
  
Hes repented his bolder days  
His druggie ways of yore  
Faithful friends who got smashed with him dont bring hash to him no more  
Were pretty sure  
Through the slurs you almost can decipher  
When he speaks aloud  
Hes the hottest star among the headbang crowd  
So have yourself an Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy little Christmas now
