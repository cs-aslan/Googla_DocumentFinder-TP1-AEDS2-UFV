Try not to try  
Try not to care  
Its really easy once you learn  
That no one is listening  
  
Try not to give  
Try not to help  
Youll do much better for yourself  
Because nothing else matters  
  
I know you well by now  
Youre that good person  
  
Dont be afraid  
Dont be naive  
You think youre better than me  
Well youre sadly mistaken  
  
I know you well by now  
Youre that good person  
  
Its all the same inside our minds  
Everything is justified  
What is wrong and what is right  
Everything is justified
