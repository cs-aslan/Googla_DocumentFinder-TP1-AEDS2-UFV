Live from BedfordStuyvesant the livest one  
Representing BK to the fullest  
Gats I pull it bastards ducking when Big be bucking  
Chickenheads be clucking in my bathroom fucking  
It aint nothing they know Big be handling  
With the mac in the Ac door paneling  
Damagin MCs oxygen they cant breathe  
Mad tricks up the sleeve wear boxers so my dick can breathe  
Breeze through in the Q45 by my side lyrical high  
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches  
Get smoked like dutches from the master  
Hate to blast you but I have to you see I smoke a lot  
Your life is played out like Kwame and them fucking polka dots  
Who rock the spot Biggie  
You know how the weed go unbelievable  
  
BIG GIE AKA BIG  
Get it Biggie  
Also known as the bon appetit  
Rappers cant sleep need sleeping Big keep creeping  
Bullets heatseeking casualties need treating  
Dumb rappers need teaching  
Lesson A  dont fuck with BI thats that  
Oh I thought he was wack Oh come come now  
Why yall so dumb now  hunt me or be hunted  
I got three hundred and fiftyseven ways  
To simmer saute Im the winner all day  
Lights get dimmer down Biggies hallway  
My forte causes Caucasians to say  
He sounds demented car weed scented  
If I said it I meant it  
Bite my tongue for noone  
Call me evil or unbelievable  
  
Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus Coupes  
Leave no witnesses what you think this is  
Aint no amateurs here I damage and tear  
MCs fear me they too near not to hear me  
Clearly Im the triple beam dream  
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut  
It seems fucked up the way I touched up the grill  
Trying to play gorilla when you aint no killer  
The gats by your liver your upper lip quiver  
Get ready to die tell God I said hi  
And throw down some ice for the nicest MC  
Niggas know the steelo unbelievable
