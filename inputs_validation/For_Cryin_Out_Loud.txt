There we were in this old moovie  
We were watchin actors playay charades  
We were playin right along as best we could  
But I could see behind your shaade  
The plot was old and so famiiliar  
People sluggin it out foror nickles and dihihihimes  
We had heareard the same old stororry  
So we made up our own liines  
Hey honey lets lose this crazy crowd  
Theres really no safety in nuumbers  
I love your so for cryin out loud  
And Im cryin out loud  
I love you so ohhohhohhoh  
You look really like an aangel  
When you said stop runnin it slows you dowown  
But you were makin coonversaation  
That was makin my heart frowown  
Hey honey lets lose this crazy crowd  
Theres really no safety in nuumbers  
I love you so for cryin out loud  
And Im cryin out loud  
I love you so ohhohhohhoh  
Honey Im acryin out loud I love you so  
Hear me cryin out loud I love you soho  
Ahhhlahhahhwahhwahh
