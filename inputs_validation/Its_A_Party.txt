Verse 1  
Sparklin like a towerin inferno  
You want to learn my songs this aint no journal  
It blemished my rhyme because Im drawin the line  
Dont celebrate too soon cause Im goin for mine  
Just a character in a made up cartoon  
Like witchel and hazel boy youre pushin a broom  
So get a new life or come equipped with the best  
Mark another one for ice let the microphone rest  
Just listen to my groove the beat is strong  
And ill rock it now I need a microphone  
Im in the mood to dance Im in the mood to prance  
You tried me once but now youre takin a chance  
Because I rock with flavor hard as lifesaver  
You asked for dope hathats what I gave ya  
A chance to go but now you move too slow  
My juice is pumped and Im ready to go  
Chorus  
Goits a partycome onlets do thiscome on  
Verse 2  
Real goodinto a new phase jumpin up the airwaves  
And now youre amazed cause its hip hop that you crave  
because Im hyped like an addict theres no drug involved  
The only thing I need is my record revolved  
Def comin strong hard like a matador  
I saw my style my soul up on the dance floor  
I want to see ya shake shake and shiver  
Youre a charity case and ice is the giver  
Im givin you what you want but youre dumb and naive  
You cant cope with the dop ice has concieved  
Which is a dope jam hotter than the third degree  
You tried my style but I burn you see  
Im ice and Im cold Im buildin igloos of gold  
You want to bite my style you gotta have soul  
cause a dope like this is not easy to come by  
You dont buy it on it comes out your hifi  
Chorus  
Its a partycome onlets do this  
Verse 3  
You think its funy to lack but Im a brother to mack  
The 808 kickin base from a dope drum track  
Im the coolest of cool kickin cools silly fools  
You are posses takin a dip and vanillas the pool  
Get ready for my ritual its at its peak  
Silly punks bow down 1st the lyricist speak  
Intruders get slayed my pockets get paid  
The girlie is jockin it and just got laid  
See Im the press you elect keep the record erect  
In effect damn aint that what you expect  
Earthquake is on the funk my homies not a punk  
Take you antique rhymes and self em as junk  
You see we wont come front and sellin drugs and all that shit  
Fake caddies mack daddies aint even legit  
So get a beeper youre a sleeper and you need to wake up  
So make the record transform so carwin vegas  
Chorus  
Its a partycome onlets do this  
Outro  
Do it we dont need no music  
Cause all we want to do is sing and dance and party down

Chorus
