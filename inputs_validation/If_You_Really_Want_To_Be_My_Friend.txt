If you really want to be my friend  
Let me live it up like I used to do  
If you really want to understand me  
Theres some giving up we got to do  
  
I know evrybody wants to be your man  
I dont want to tie you up go ahead youre free  
And I never want to scar you with my brand  
We could live it up just a you and me  
  
If you really want to understand a man  
Let him off the lead sometimes set him free  
If you really really want to be my friend  
Give me the look of love not jealousy  
  
I know you think that life is a thriller  
You play the vamp I play the killer  
Now baby whats the use of fighting  
By the last reel well be cryin cryin cryin  
  
If you really want to be my man  
Get your nails out of my back  
Stop using me  
  
You know I really really want to be your friend  
But just a little faith is all we need  
I dont want no dog eat dog world for you and me  
Get your nails out stop bleeding me  
  
You know people tell me you are a vulture  
Say youre a sore in a cancer culture  
Ay but you got a little charm around you  
Ill be there when they finally hound you  
Hound you hound you  
  
If you really want to be my friend  
And I really want to understand you baby  
If you really want to be my friend  
If you really want to understand me  
I really want to be your man  
I want to try to give you a helping hand  
  
I really want to be your friend  
I want to push you when youre up  
And pull you when youre down  
If you really want you to understand me  
Ill tell you something that love cant thrive on jealousy  
  
I really want to understand you  
I really want to be your man  
Cause understanding is something evrybody needs  
I really want to be your friend  
And I love you love you yes I do
