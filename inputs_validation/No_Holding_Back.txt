A friend of mine called up  
said I finlly had some luck  
Could I have a minute of your time  
I met a girl last night  
try as I might  
I cant get her off of my mind  
She walked in the room and right then I knew  
I finly found somebody for me  
But to tell you the truth  
I dont know what to do  
Should I go ahead or wait and see  
  
I said Give it all you got  
no holding back  
Let a light in your soul  
Aint it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all  
Than to never love at all  
  
Now Im the kind of guy  
whos normally quiet shy  
On romance I dont know a thing  
But when she led me to the floor  
never danced before  
Suddenly my feet had wings  
I know that she wnats me  
I want her too  
but Im so confused  
I cant think straight  
I feel so alive  
but on the other side  
should I go ahead or should I wait  
  
I said Give it all you got  
no holding back  
Let a light in your soul  
Aint it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all  
Aint it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all  
Than to never love at all  
  
So when the music starts  
to flow from your hearts  
like the coming of an early spring  
whe nthe river starts to flow  
between your soul to soul  
may no man ever come between  
Die in her arms if she wants you to  
Be thankful for each passin day  
When your odds collide  
let your spirits fly  
and pray to God its here to stay  
  
And I said Give it all You got  
no holding back  
Let a light in your soul  
Aint it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all  
  
Give it all you got  
no holding back  
Let a light in your soul  
Aint it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all  
than to never love at all  
than to never never love at all  
Aint it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all
