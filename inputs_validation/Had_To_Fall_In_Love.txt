What mattered to me was the right to be free  
Like Ill be someday  
Im waiting for my heart to lead the way  
The places Ive seen and the roads in between  
Make me wonder why  
Im searching for my dreams up in the sky  
I heard the call  
In the mirror I saw the writing on the wall  
And I had to fall in love with you  
The face that Ive known seems so lost and alone  
When youre far away  
Im comin for you baby right away  
The places Ive seen and the roads in between  
Make me wonder why  
Im searching for me dreams up in the sky  
I heard the call  
In the mirror I saw the writing on the wall  
And I had to fall in love with you  
What mattered to me was the right to be free  
Like Ill be someday  
Im waiting for my heart to lead the way
