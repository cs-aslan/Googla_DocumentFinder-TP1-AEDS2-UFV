Red oh red  
The taste of blood  
On lips of wine  
Red so silent  
Wait a minute  
Or just a little while  
What are you looking for  
The taste of red  
The taste of fear  
From your seemingly convincing smile  
Red oh red  
The taste of blood  
On lips of wine  
The time is waiting maybe  
Takes away from your demise  
From your demise  
Say youre slippin  
Maybe so  
Its not easy  
Now you know
