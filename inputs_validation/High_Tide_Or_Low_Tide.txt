In high seas or in low seas  
Im gonna be your friend

In high tide or in low tide

I heard her praying praying praying  
I said I heard my mother  
She was praying in the night praying praying praying  
And the words that she said the words that she said  
  
They stilla linger in my head lingers in my head  
She said a child is born in this world  
He needs protection ooh  
God guide and protect us  
  
When were wrong please correct us  
when were wrong correct us  
And stand by me  
  
In high seas or in low seas  
Im gonna be your friend  
He said Im gonna be your friend  
And baby in high tide or in low tide  
Ill be by your side  
Ill be by your side  
  
I said I heard my mother  
She was crying in the night I heard her crying crying crying  
And the tears that she shed the tears that she shed  
They still lingers in my head lingers in my head  
  
She said a child is born in this world  
He needs protection ooh  
God guide and protect us  
When were wrong when were wrong correct us  
  
And in high seas or in low seas  
Im gonna be your friend  
Im gonna be your friend  
Said high tide or low tide  
Ill be by your side
