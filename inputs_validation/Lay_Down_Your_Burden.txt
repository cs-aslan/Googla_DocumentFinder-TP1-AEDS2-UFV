Its a cold old world that were walking through  
They ought to tell you at the start  
But its warm as toast walking two by two  
Lay down the burden of your heart  
  
Chorus  
Lay down the burden of your heart  
I know youll never miss it  
Just show me angel where it hurts  
And let your mammy kiss it  
  
Its a fine fine line between love and hate  
Its hard to tell the two apart  
But what strength I have I offer you  
Lay down the burden of your heart  
  
Chorus x2
