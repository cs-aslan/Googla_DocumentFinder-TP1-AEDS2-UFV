Well I stand up next to a mountain  
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand  
Well I stand up next to a mountain  
Chop it down with the edge of my hand  
Well I pick up all the pieces and make an island  
Might even raise just a little sand  
Cause Im a voodoo child  
Lord knows Im a voodoo child  
  
I didnt mean to take you up all your sweet time  
Ill give it right back to you one of these days  
I said I didnt mean to take you up all your sweet time  
Ill give it right back to you one of these days  
And if I dont meet you no more in this world  
Then Ill Ill meet you in the next one  
And dont be late dont be late  
Cause Im a voodoo child  
Lord knows Im a voodoo child  
Im a voodoo child
