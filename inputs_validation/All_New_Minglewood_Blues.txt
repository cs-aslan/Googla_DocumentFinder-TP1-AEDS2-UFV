I was born in the desert Raised in a lions den  
Oh my number one occupation is stealing women from their men  
Well Im a wanted man in Texas busted jail and Im gone for good  
Said Im a wanted man in Texas busted jail and Im gone for good  
Well the sheriff couldnt catch me  
But his little girl sure wish she could  
Well now the doctor call me crazy sometimes I am sometimes I aint  
Said now the doctor call me crazy sometimes I am sometimes I aint  
Yes and the preacher man call me sinner  
But his little girl call me saint  
Well a couple shots of whiskey women round here start looking good  
I said a couple shots of whiskey women round here start looking good  
A couple more shots of whiskey Im going down to Minglewood  
Said I was born in the desert Raised in a lions den  
Said I was born in the desert Raised in a lions den  
Yes and my number one occupation is stealing women from their men  
I was born in the desert Raised in a lions den  
Oh my number one occupation is stealing women from their men
