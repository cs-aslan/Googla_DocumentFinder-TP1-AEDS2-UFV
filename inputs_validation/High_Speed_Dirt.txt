Do it if you dare  
Leaping form the sky  
Hurling through the air  
Exhilarating high  
See the earth below  
Soon to make a crater  
Blue sky black death  
Im off to meet my maker  
Energy of the gods adrenaline surge  
Wont stop til I hit the ground Im on my way for sure  
Up here in the air this will never hurt  
Im on my way to impact taste the high speed dirt  
Paralyzed with fear  
Feel velocity gain  
Entering a near  
Catatonic state  
Pressure of the sound  
Roaring through my head  
Crash into the ground  
Damned if Ill be dead  
Jump or die  
Dropping all my weight  
Going down full throttle  
The pale horse awaits  
Like a genie in a bottle  
Fire in my veins  
Faster as I go  
I forgot my name  
Im a dirt torpedo  
High speed dirt
