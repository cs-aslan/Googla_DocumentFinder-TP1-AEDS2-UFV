I coulda swore her hair was made of rayon  
She wore a Milton Bradley Crayon  
But she was something I could lay on  
Cant remember what became of me

She put a Doobie Brothers tape on  
I had a Roger Daitrey cape on  
There was a bed I dumped her shape on  
Cant remember what became of me

Somewhat later on  
I woke up and she was gone  
There was dew out on the lawn  
In the sunrise  
Later she came back  
With a rumpled paper sack  
Which she told me would contain  
A surprise  
  
She stuck her hand right in it to the bottom  
Said she knew Id be surprised she gotem  
Take a Charleston pimp to spot em  
Then she gave a pair of shoes to me   
Plastic leather 14 Triple D  
  
I said I wonder whats the shoes for  
She told me Dont you worry no more  
And got right down there on the tile floor  
Now Darling STOMP ALL OVER ME   
Carolina Hardcore Ecstasy  
  
Is this something new  
Having people stomp on you  
Is it what I need to do  
For your pleasure  
What is this a quiz  
Dont you worry what it is  
It is merely just a moment  
I can treasure  
  
By ten oclock her arms and legs were rendered  
She couldnt talk cause her mouth had been extendered  
Looked to me as though she had been blendered  
But was this abject misery  
No No

It might seem strange to Herb and Dee
