The circus is coming to see you  
The elephant smiles  
Everybody can hear you say thats out of style  
My brother is friendly for reasons if I am the same  
Just for four hundred seasons we all live in rain  
  
So I laugh in your face  
Your only one race  
Yes I laugh in your face and Im right  
You lie just like the rest  
But theres nobody best  
So I laugh in your face and Im right  
  
Ill pull out your plug so your small  
Youll slide down the drain  
On the steps of St Peters you all look the same  
  
So I laugh in your face  
Your only one race  
Yes I laugh in your face and Im right  
You lie just like the rest  
But theres nobody best  
So I laugh in your face and Im right  
  
The circus is coming to see you  
The elephant smiles  
Everybody can hear you say thats out of style  
So I laugh in your face  
Youre only one race  
Yes I laugh in your face and Im right  
You lie just like the rest  
But theres nobody best  
So I laugh in your face and Im right
