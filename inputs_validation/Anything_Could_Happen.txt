Stripped to the waist  
We fall into the river  
Cover your eyes  
So you dont know the secret  
  
Ive been trying to hide  
  
Marley with New Directions Girls  
We held our breath  
To see our names are written  
  
Marley  
On the wreck of 86  
  
Marley with New Directions Girls  
That was the year  
I knew the panic was over  
  
Marley  
Yeah since we found out  
Since we found out  
  
Marley with New Directions Girls

Anything could happen

Artie  
After the war  
We said wed fight together  
I guess we thought  
Thats just what humans do  
Letting darkness grow  
As if we need its palette  
And we need its colour  
  
But now Ive seen it through  
And now I know the truth  
  
Artie with New Directions Girls  
That anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen
