Youll see pretty browns in beautiful gowns  
Youll see tailormades and handmedowns  
Youll meet honest men and pickpockets skilled  
Youll find that business never closes  
Till somebody gets killed  
  
If Beale Street could talk if Beale Street could talk  
Married men would have to take their beds and walk  
Except one or two who never drink booze  
And the blind man on the corner  
Who sings the Beale Street Blues  
  
He said Id rather be there than anyplace I know  
Yes Id rather be here than anyplace I know  
Its gonna take the Sergeant for to make me go  
  
Im goin to the river maybe by and by  
Yes Im goin to the river and theres a reason why  
Because the rivers wet and Beale Streets done gone dry
