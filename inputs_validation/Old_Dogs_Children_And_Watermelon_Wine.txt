How old do you think I am he said I said well I didnt know  
He said I turned sixty five about eleven months ago  
I was sittin in Miami pourin blended whiskey down  
When this old gray black gentleman was cleanin up the lounge  
There wasnt anyone around cept this old man and me  
The guy who ran the bar was watching Iron sides on TV  
Uninvited he sat down and opened up his mind  
On old dogs and children and watermelon wine  
Ever had a drink of watermelon wine he asked  
He told me all about it though I didnt answer back  
Aint but three things in this world thats worth a solitary dime  
But old dogs and children and watermelon wine  
  
He said women think about they selves when menfolk aint around  
And friends are hard to find when they discover that youre down  
He said I tried it all when I was young and in my natural prime  
Now its old dogs and children and watermelon wine  
Old dogs care about you even when you make mistakes  
God bless little children while theyre still too young to hate  
When he moved away I found my pen and copied down that line  
Bout old dogs and children and watermelon wine  
  
I had to catch a plane up to Atlanta that next day  
As I left for my room I saw him pickin up my change  
That night I dreamed in peaceful sleep of shady summertime  
Of old dogs and children and watermelon wine
