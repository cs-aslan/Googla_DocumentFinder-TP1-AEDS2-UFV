Its raining Its raining  
  
There is nothing you can do  
It doesnt only rain on you  
But youre acting all upset like youre the only one who is wet  
  
Its raining Its raining  
  
There is nothing we can do  
Its raining on me too  
You moan and you cry  
But it wont effect the sky  
  
Youre not a saint  
Youre not a savior  
Or a devil  
Its agreed  
Oh lucky you oh lucky me  
We have more of those than we need  
  
And when you give me gifts and money  
Im a swine before the pearl  
It only serves to remind me that we are all alone in this world  
  
Its raining Its raining  
  
And I cant tell you when the storm is gonna end  
So go ahead and cry but that wont keep you dry
