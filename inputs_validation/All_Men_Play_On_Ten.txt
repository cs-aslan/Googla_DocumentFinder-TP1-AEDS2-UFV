I made A rocknroll  
When I tried givin in to make money had to turn down low  
They said why be proud dont play so loud be like us  
And get A sound thats real thin  
Wear A polyester suit act happy look cute get A haircut  
And buy small gear  
Thats when I turned to them and said hold it right there  
Well its more to me than just A job and while Im playin  
You wont get robbed  
Nobody tells A man how to play it just aint that way  
Hey hey hey can you hear me say  
All men play on ten never gonna turn down again  
All men play on ten never gonna turn down again  
Im jet fuel honey plug me into 220 step back and let  
My fingers fly  
While Im burning up my gear theres A fire in your ear  
That wont stop until the day you die  
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar  
Oh its music to my ears when they scream  
Then I run back the power rack and deck all of my gear  
Well its more to me than just A job and while Im playing  
You wont get robbed  
Nobody tells A man how to play it just aint that way  
Hey hey hey can you hear me say  
All men play on ten never gonna turn down again  
All men play on ten never gonna turn down again  
Well its more to me than just A job and while Im playing  
You wont get robbed  
Nobody tells A man how to play it just aint that way  
Hey hey hey can you hear me say  
All men play on ten never gonna turn down again  
All men play on ten never gonna turn down again
