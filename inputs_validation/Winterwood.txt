Noone can take your place with me  
And time has proven that Im right  
Theres no place Id rather be  
Than at your place for the night  
  
No time can pass your sight unseen  
No moment steals away unfound  
Lifetime lived in such a dream  
Floats like a feather to the ground  
  
Chorus  
And for the first time Ive been seeing  
The things Id never notice without you  
And for the first time Im discovering  
The things I use to treasure about you  
  
The birds like leaves on Winterwood  
Sing hopeful songs on dismal days  
Theyve learned to live life as they should  
They are at peace with natures ways  
  
You are as natural as the night  
And all that springs from you is good  
And the children born beneath your light  
Are like the birds on Winterwood  
  
Chorus
