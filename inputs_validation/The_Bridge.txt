I know you well enough to tell youve got your reasons  
Thats not the kind of code youre inclined to break  
Some things unknown are best left alone foreverand if a vow is what it takes  
Havent you paid for your mistakesafter the moment passes  
And the impulse disappearsyou can still hold back  
Because you dont crack very easilyits a timehonored resolution  
Because the danger is always nearits with you now  
But that aint how it was supposed to be  
And its hard to believe after all these years  
It still gives you pain and it still brings tearsand you feel like a fool  
Cause in spite of the rulesyouve got a memorychorus
