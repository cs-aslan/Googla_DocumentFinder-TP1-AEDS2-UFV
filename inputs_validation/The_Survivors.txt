Cross a windy bridge one winter night  
Past Embankment Gardens  
Enter warmth and light  
Face the music its never easy  
Forget the chill  
Face the future its never easy  
Find the will  
If live is worth living  
Its got to be done  
One might be forgiven  
For thinking its a life on the run  
Many roads will cross through many lives  
But somehow you survive  
Look around  
Picture whats in store  
Is this the final edit  
Or is the subject now a bore  
Dont shrug your shoulders its always easy  
You cant ignore  
That life is worth living  
Its still worth a damn  
One might be forgiven for thinking  
Its something of a sham  
Many words may make it sound contrived  
But somehow were alive  
The Survivors  
Our heads bowed  
The Survivors  
At memorials for other faces  
In the crowd  
Teachers and artists its never easy  
And Saturday girls in suits or sequins  
Its never easy  
Or twinsetsandpearls  
If life is worth living  
Its got to be run as a means of giving  
Not as a race to be won  
Many roads will run through many lives  
But somehow well arrive  
Many roads will run through many lives  
But somehow well survive
