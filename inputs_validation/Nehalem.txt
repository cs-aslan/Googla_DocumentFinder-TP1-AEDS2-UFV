There is this rumor about  
They say youre leaving Nehalem  
Ever since our baby died  
  
Youve been seen with another guy  
The whole damn town is talking now  
They say youre leaving Nehalem  
Hey dont you want me to go  
Hey dont you want me  
  
They say youre losing your mind  
They say youre leaving Nehalem  
You know how the bad words get around  
Big noise in a hard small town  
  
Tell me if you want me to go  
Just tell me if you want me  
They say youre leaving Nehalem  
They say youre leaving me  
  
Yeah I know you need to break away  
I dont give a fuck about what those people say  
I hope you find everywhere you go  
All the good things that you need to know  
They say youre losing your mind  
  
They say youre leaving Nehalem  
There is this rumor out  
They say youre leaving Nehalem  
They say youre leaving me
