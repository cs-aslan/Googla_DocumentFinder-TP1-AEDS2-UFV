Im standin with my bowed head down now  
That aint right that aint wrong  
Its just a feelin but I cant shake it  
I keep on tryin but its been so long  
  
If I hurt you I did not mean to  
I beg you pardon I did not want to  
When I leave you dont you think about me  
I wont be back babe Ill be long gone  
  
When the time comes and Im not ready  
Seems its over before Im started  
The time comes and I dont feel it  
I dont know nothin but my own  
  
Kingdoms into the sky go  
And the highway like a river does flow  
And my way sometimes it hurts so  
And your way just dont go home
