It was a matter of fact that when I paid all my tax  
I held my world in the palm of my hand  
And all of my debts were causing me to defect  
To a land of bananas and sand  
So I ran yes I ran yes I ran to a foreign land  
Here I am here I am  
Here I am in a foreign land  
  
Im so glad we made it  
I thought wed never land  
I grabbed all my cash  
And decided to dash far away  
Far away far away to a foreign land  
Here I am here I am here I am in a foreign land  
  
Goodbye to all of the rich mans daughters  
Goodbye to my debts now Im way cross the water  
Far away far away in a foreign land  
Here I am here I am here I am in a foreign land  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
Please tell my mother and all my exlovers  
That Ive finally made the grade  
  
Please tell my debtors and the money collectors  
That all of my bills will be paid some day  
Im away Im away far away in a foreign land  
  
Goodbye champagne and caviar set  
I want to slum and drink all the rum I can get  
Im away Im away in a foreign land  
Here I am here I am here I am in a foreign land  
But Im all out of my jack and I cant go back  
Im away far away far away in a foreign land  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la
