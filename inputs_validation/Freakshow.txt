Ten pm ten to four  
And I came to hit the floor  
Thought you knew b4  
But if you dont then now u know  
Yo tonight Im bout to mash  
Make them other chicks so mad  
Im bout to I shake my ass  
Snatch that boy so fast  
Make dem other bitches mad  
  
Its all about me and you  
Doin how we do  
Tear the floor up up  
Tell em to make room  
If they wanna know  
Tell em mind their own  
But if they wanna look  
We can give em a encore  
  
Chorus  
Make it a  
Freakshow freakshow  
We can give em a  
Peepshow peepshow  
Dont stop it let it flow  
Let your inhibitions go

Dancing table top freaky freaky  
So outside the norm  
On some super star ish  
Pushin hot Bugatti whips  
Rockin new designer fits

Doin how we do  
Tear the floor up up  
Tell em to make room  
If they wanna know  
Tell em mind their own  
But if they wanna look  
We can give em a encore  
  
Chorus  
Make it a  
Freakshow freakshow

Let your inhibitions go
