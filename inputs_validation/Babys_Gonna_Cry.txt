Do you feel sorry lover  
Do you feel blue  
What reason did you have  
To be untrue  
Now you could be so good  
But you have to be so bad  
When you could make me  
Happy lover  
You make me sad  
  
Now theres a cool breeze blowin  
Blowin out the flame  
That used to burn inside me  
At the mention of your name  
Now theres a cool breeze blowin  
Blowin down the track   
Thats where Im goin  
And Im never comin back  
  
My my  babys gonna cry  
My my  babys gonna cry  
My my  babys gonna cry  
Tonight  oh yea  
  
Now theres nothing  
Comes from nothing  
Thats what they always say  
Didnt mama tell ya  
Thats the price you have to pay  
Now you cant have  
Your piece of cake  
And eat the sweet thing too  
But that kind of understanding  
Isnt good enough for you  
My my  babys gonna cry
