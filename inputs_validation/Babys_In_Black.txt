Oh dear what can I do  
Babys in black  
And Im feeling blue  
Tell me oh what can I do  
She thinks of him  
And so she dresses in black  
And though hell never come back  
Shes dressed in black  
  
Oh dear what can I do  
Babys in black  
And Im feeling blue  
Tell me oh what can I do  
I think of her  
But she thinks only of him  
And though its only a whim  
She thinks of him  
  
Oh how long will it take  
Till she sees the mistake  
She has made  
Dear what can I do  
Babys in black  
And Im feeling blue  
Tell me oh what can I do
