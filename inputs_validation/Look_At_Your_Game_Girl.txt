Theres a time for a living  
Time keeps on flying  
Think youre loving baby  
But all your doing is crying  
  
Can you feel  
Are those feelings real  
Look at your game girl  
Look at your game girl  
  
What a mad delusion  
Living in that confusion  
Frustration and doubt  
Can you ever live without the game  
  
The sad sad game  
Mad game  
Just to say loves not enough  
Even it cant be true  
Oh you can tell those lies baby but youre only fooling you  
  
Can you feel  
Are those feelings real  
Look at your game girl  
Go on look at your game girl  
  
And if you cant feel  
And those feelings aint real  
Then you better stop tryin  
Or your gonna play cryin  
Stop tryin  
Or your gonna play cryin  
Stop tryin  
  
Thats the game  
Sad sad game  
Mad game  
Sad game  
  
spoken  
Thanks Charles
