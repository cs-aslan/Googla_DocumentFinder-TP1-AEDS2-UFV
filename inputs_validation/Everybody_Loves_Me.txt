Well hell sees her shadow in my backseat  
And her friends are standing right in front of me  
World wide from the center burning turkey  
Open up said everybody loves me  
  
And you dont have to make a sound  
Cause they got what you need  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
God love all the people that have warned you  
God love all your sentimental virtue  
Eight balls with the takers thatll make you  
Lay calls with the lovers thatll hate you  
  
And you dont have to make a sound  
They got what you need  
What you need  
Make you say  
  
Oh my  
Feels just like I dont try  
Looks so good I might die  
All I know is everybody loves me  
  
Get down  
Swaying to my own sound  
Flashes in my face now  
All I know is everybody loves me  
Everybody loves me  
  
Well I  
Play the music dont stop till I turn gray  
Stars like forever John Sousa never fade  
He had a beautiful child named Desiree  
Hope Im remembered for the things that I never made  
  
Cause you dont have to make a sound  
When they got what you need  
Like you say  
  
Oh my  
Feels just like I dont try  
Looks so good I might die  
All I know is everybody loves me  
  
Get down  
Swaying to my own sound  
Flashes in my face now  
All I know is everybody loves me  
Everybody loves me  
  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Oh  
Everybody  
Everybody  
  
Dont need my health  
Got my name and got my wealth I  
Stare at the sun  
Just for kicks all by myself I  
Lose track of time  
So I might be past my prime  
But  
Im feeling oh so good  
Yeah  
  
Oh my  
Feels just like I dont try  
Looks so good I might die  
All I know is everybody loves me  
  
Get down  
Swaying to my own sound  
Flashes in my face now  
All I know is everybody loves me  
Everybody loves me  
  
Dont you know you wanna  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Whoa Yeah
