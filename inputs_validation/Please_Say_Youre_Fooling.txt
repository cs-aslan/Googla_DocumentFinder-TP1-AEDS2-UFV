You say youre leaving me  
For someone new  
Please say youre teasing me  
Say its not true  
  
Say it come on  
And say youre fooling  
Whoa say its a lie  
Whoa say youre fooling me baby  
Dont say goodbye  
  
Whoa if our romance is really done  
Dont you know my heart  
Will never see the sun  
  
To me youre everything  
That is sweet and divine  
Dont keep me wandering baby  
If youre still me  
  
Say it come on  
And say youre foolong  
Whoa say its a lie  
Whoa say youre fooling me baby  
Whoa dont say goodbye  
Dont say goodbye
