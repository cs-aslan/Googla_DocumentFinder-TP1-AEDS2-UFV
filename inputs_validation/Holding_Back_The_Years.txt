Holding back the years  
Thinking of the fear Ive had so long  
When somebody hears  
Listen to the fear thats gone  
  
Strangled by the wishes of pater  
Hoping for the arm of mater  
Get to me sooner or later  
Nothing ever could yeah  
  
Ill keep holding on  
Ill keep holding on  
Ill keep holding on  
Keep holding on  
Ill keep holding on  
Never let you go away  
Ill keep holding on  
  
Holding back the years  
Chance for me to escape from all I know  
Holding back the tears yeah  
Theres nothing here has grown  
  
Ive wasted all my tears  
Wasted all those years  
Nothing had the chance to be good  
Nothing ever could yeah yeah yeah alright  
  
Ill keep holding on  
Im gon keep holding on  
Ill keep holding on  
Holding and holding and holding  
Ill keep holding on  
Ill keep holding babe  
Ill keep holding on  
So tight  
  
I wasted all my tears  
Wasted all those precious years  
Nothing had the chance to be good  
Nothing ever could yeah yeah and Ill  
  
Ill keep holding on  
Im gonna hold on babe  
Ill keep holding on  
Im gonna hold hold hold hold on  
Ill keep holding on
