I got another phone call a caring friend or two  
They say they have the answers for what Im going through  
But they dont understand that their ways just wont work for me  
Ive got a Lord who knows my heart and meets my every need  
  
Chorus  
Yes Lord Id rather believe in You Yes Lord Id rather believe in You  
Youve always kept your promises Your Love has never failed  
Thats why I know Id rather believe in You  
  
I saw the morning paper Hope is lost at sea  
Fears the motivator but where can the victory be  
Although the signs of troubled times are tempting to receive  
Id rather trust in the Good News that my Jesus said believe  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh dont you know that our crying time is near  
But Jesus is closer And he dries up ever tear  
  
Chorus
