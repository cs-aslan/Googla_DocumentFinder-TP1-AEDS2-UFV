ORPHANS  
Its a hardknock life for us  
Its a hardknock life for us  
  
ANNIE  
Stead of treated  
ORPHANS  
We get tricked  
  
ANNIE  
Stead of kisses  
  
ORPHANS  
We get kicked  
  
ALL  
Its a hardknock life  
Got no folks to speak of so  
Its the hardknock row we hoe  
  
ANNIE  
Cotton blankets 2 beats  
  
ORPHANS  
Stead a wool  
  
ANNIE  
Empty Bellies 2 beats  
  
ORPHANS  
Stead a full  
  
ALL  
Its a hardknock life  
  
ANNIE  
Dont it feel like the wind is always howln  
  
KATE AND TESSIE  
Dont it seem like theres never any light  
  
ANNIE and MOLLY  
Once a day dont you wanna throw the towel in  
  
PEPPER JULY  
Its easier than putting up a fight  
  
ANNIE  
No ones there when your dreams at night are creepy  
No one cares if you grow or if you shrink  
No one dries when your eyes get wet and weepy  
  
ALL  
From the crying you would think this places would sink  
Ohhhh  
Empty belly life  
Rotten smelly life  
Full of sorrow life  
No tomorrow life  
  
MOLLY  
Santa Claus we never see  
  
ANNIE  
Santa Claus whats that  
Whos he  
  
ALL  
No one cares for you a smidge  
When your in an orphanage  
Its the hard knock life  
  
MOLLY  
Making a whistling sound and imitating Miss Hannigan  
Youre gonna scrub this dump till it shines  
Like the top of the Chrysler building  
  
ORPHANS Except Molly  
Yank the whiskers from her face  
Jab her with a safety Pin  
Make her drink a Mickey Finn  
I love you Miss Hannigan  
Molly  
Get to work  
Scrub the floors  
I said get to work  
  
ALL  
Its the hardknock life for her  
  
Its the hardknock life for her  
No one cares for you a smidge  
Molly  
  
When your in an orphanage  
Its a hardknock life  
Its a hardknock life  
Its a hardknock life
