Theyve given me a mission  
I dont really know the game yet  
Im bent on submission  
Religion is to blame  
Im the new messiah  
Death Angel with a gun  
Dangerous in my silence  
Deadly to my cause  
  
Speak to me the pain you feel  
Speak the word  
The word is all of us  
  
Ive given my life to become what I am  
To preach the new beginning  
To make you understand  
To reach some point of order  
Utopia in mind youve got to learn  
To sacrifice to leave whats now behind  
  
Speak to me the pain you feel  
Speak the word  
The word is all of us  
Speak the word  
The word is all of us  
  
Seven years of power  
The corporation claw  
The rich control the government the media the law  
To make some kind of difference  
Then everyone must know  
Eradicate the fascists revolution will grow  
  
The system we learn says were equal under law  
But the streets are reality the weak and poor will fall  
Lets tip the power balance and tear down their crown  
Educate the masses Well burn the White House down  
  
Speak to me the pain you feel  
Speak to me the pain you feel  
Speak the word Revolution  
The word is all of us  
Speak the word Revolution  
The word is all of us  
Speak the word  
The word is all of us  
Speak the Word  
The word is all of us  
  
Speak
