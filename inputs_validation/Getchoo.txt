This is beginning to hurt  
This is beginning to be serious  
It used to be a game  
Now its a cryin shame  
cause you dont want to play around no more  
  
Sometimes I push too hard  
Sometimes you fall and skin your knee  
I never meant to do  
All that Ive done to you  
Please baby say its not too late  
To get you uhhuh  
  
You know this is breakin me up  
You think that Im some kind of freak  
But if youd come back to me  
Then you would surely see  
That Im just foolin around  
  
To get you uhhuh  
  
I cant believe  
What youve done to me  
What I did do them  
Youve done to me
