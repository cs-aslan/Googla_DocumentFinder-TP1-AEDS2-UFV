One thousand umbrellas  
Upturned couldnt catch all the rain  
That drained out of my head  
When you said we were  
Over and over I cried  
Til I floated downstream  
To a town they call  
Misery oh oh misery  
Misery oh oh misery  
  
And one million teacups  
I bet couldnt hold all the wet  
That fell out of my eyes  
When you fell out with me  
Now Im crawling the wallpaper  
Thats looking more like a road map  
To misery oh oh misery  
  
How can you smile and forecast  
Weathers getting better  
And youll soon forget her  
If you let the sunshine come through  
How can you smile and forecast  
Weathers getting better  
If you never let a girl rain all over you  
And just when I thought that my vista was golden in hue  
One thousand umbrellas opened to spoil the view  
  
One billion salt seas  
Recalled from school atlas  
Alas would be filled to the brim  
Sunny Jim couldnt jump it  
How can I be pleased  
When Im handed the keys  
To a town they call Misery  
Oh oh Misery  
  
So with a mop and a bucket  
Ill just say forget her  
And carry on sweeping up  
Where Ive been weeping  
The Jesters will creep in  
To strike down the newly crowned Monarch  
Of Misery oh oh Misery  
  
How can you smile and forecast  
Weathers getting better  
And youll soon forget her  
If you let the sunshine come through  
How can you smile and forecast  
Weathers getting better  
If you never let a girl rain all over you  
Just when I thought that my skies were a June July blue  
One thousand umbrellas opened  
Two thousand umbrellas opened  
Ten thousand umbrellas opened to spoil the view
