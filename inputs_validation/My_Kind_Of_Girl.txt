She walks like an angel walks  
She talks like an angel talks  
And her hair has a kind of curl  
To my mind shes my kind of girl  
  
Shes wise like an angels wise  
With eyes like an angels eyes  
And a smile kind of like a pearl  
To my mind shes my kind of girl  
  
Pretty little face  
That face just knocks me off my feet  
Pretty little feet  
Shes really sweet enough to eat  
  
She looks like an angel looks  
She cooks like an angel cooks  
And my minds in a kind of whirl  
To my mind shes my kind of girl  
  
Pretty little face  
That face just knocks me off of my feet  
Pretty little feet  
Shes really sweet enough to eat  
  
She looks like an angel looks  
She even cooks like an angel cooks  
And my minds in a kind of whirl  
To my mind shes my kind of girl  
  
And my hearts kind of full of joy  
Cause she told me Im her kind of boy
