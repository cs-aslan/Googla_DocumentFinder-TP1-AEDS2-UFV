Dont want to talk about the government  
Dont want to talk about some incident  
Dont want to talk about some peppermint gum  
Dont want to talk about the time to come  
  
Button my lip  
Til Im smart enough  
  
Dont raise your hand  
Cos Im not offering  
It serves you right  
Now you are suffering  
Give me a chance  
To see it though  
It all depends on what you hold is true  
  
Button my lip  
With your kiss  
  
Dont want to hear some little sniveling  
You just dont get what Im delivering  
Maybe you want me  
But you know you cant  
Id say I want you  
But you know I dont  
  
Button my lip  
Til Im old enough  
Til Im smart enough  
Til Im  
Button my lip  
  
Dont want to come at your beckoning  
For any day theyll be a reckoning  
Dont want to hear what is impossible  
Baby youve become invisible  
  
Button my lip  
  
Ive seen those clowns vacant and insolent  
I stand accused but I am innocent  
I am the mighty and magnificent
