Youre pretty as a daisy in an open field  
The way you make me feel from the getgo  
I had to let go of every little thing that Ive ever known  
You shake me up like Coke in a bottle  
Youre a pedal to the floor full throttle  
Aint nothin else on my mind when I see that pretty smile  
Go on  
  
Show me how its done this side of Dixie  
Im a broke down truck baby wont you fix me  
Just keep on dancin til the break of dawn come on come on  
Stars fall down make the world stop kiss me  
Wherever I go I want you with me  
Somethin bout you makes my heart run wild  
Youre loves poster child  
  
Damn girl you make me feel so free  
Like a summer sun shining down on me  
And were flying so high and good Lord we aint even trying  
You got a hold on me now like a southern wind  
Taking me places Ive never been  
And Im lost in your eyes and come on darling do it again  
  
Show me how its done this side of Dixie  
Im a broke down truck baby wont you fix me  
Just keep on dancin til the break of dawn come on come on  
Stars fall down make the world stop kiss me  
Wherever I go I want you with me  
Somethin bout you makes my heart run wild  
Youre loves poster child  
  
Show me how its done this side of Dixie  
Im a broke down truck baby wont you fix me  
Just keep on dancin til the break of dawn come on come on  
Stars fall down make the world stop kiss me  
Wherever I go I want you with me  
Somethin bout you makes my heart run wild  
Youre loves poster child
