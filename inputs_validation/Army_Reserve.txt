How long must she stand  
Before the ground it gives way  
To an endless fall  
She can feel this  
War on her face  
Stars on her pillow  
Shes folding in darkness  
Begging for slumber  
  
Im not blind  
Can see it coming  
Looks like lightning  
In my childs eye  
  
Im not frantic  
I can feel it coming  
Violently shakes  
My body  
  
Her sons slanted  
Always giving her  
The sideways eye  
And empty chair where dad sits  
How loud can silence get  
And mom she reassures  
To contain him  
But its becoming a lie  
  
She tells herself  
And everyone else  
Father is risking  
His life for our freedoms  
  
Im not blind  
I can see it coming  
Looks like lightning  
In my childs eye  
  
Im no frantic  
I can feel it coming  
Darling youll save me  
If you save yourself
