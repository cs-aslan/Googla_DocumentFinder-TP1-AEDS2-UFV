I will pass this way but once if theres any good that I can do  
Let me do it now for Ill never pass this way again  
I will see this day but once if theres any kindness I can show  
Let me show it now for Ill never see this day again  
Tomorrow may be too late my friend to do all the good that you planned  
So reach out to those who need you and lend them a helping hand  
I will know this world but once if theres any love that I can give  
Let me give it now oh Lord please show me how  
For Ill never know this world Ill never see this day  
Ill never pass this way again
