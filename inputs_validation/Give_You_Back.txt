I need to know if you were real  
Cause Ive been known to get it wrong  
When the memory comes  
Ill say Im always in the dark  
You got me now  
  
Chorus  
I want to give you back  
I want to give you back  
Somewhere out of here  
I want to give you  
I want to give you  
I want to give you back  
  
I cant remember how it went  
You looked like everything I wanted  
And as you came along  
Slowly everything began to change  
I got you now  
  
Chorus  
  
Thats enough  
Just talking about it  
I dont mind  
I dont mind no I  
Laugh enough  
Just dreaming about it  
  
I need to know if you were real  
Id hate to think that Id been fooled again  
And as the vision fades  
Ill say I was blinded by your eyes  
I felt them burn  
  
Chorus
