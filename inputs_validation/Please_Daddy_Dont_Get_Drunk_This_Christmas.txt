Please Daddy  
Dont get drunk  
This Christmas  
I dont wanna see  
My Mumma cry  
Please Daddy  
Dont get drunk  
This Christmas  
I dont wanna see  
My Mumma cry  
  
Just last year  
When I was  
Only seven  
And now  
Im almost eight  
As you can see  
You came home  
At a quarter  
Past eleven  
Fell down  
Underneath  
Our Christmas tree  
  
Please Daddy  
Dont get drunk  
This Christmas  
I dont wanna see  
My Mumma cry  
Please Daddy  
Dont get drunk  
This Christmas  
I dont wanna see  
My Mumma cry  
  
Mumma smiled  
And looked outside  
The window  
She told me  
Son  
You better  
Go upstairs  
Then you laughed  
And hollered  
Merry Christmas  
I turned around  
And saw  
My Mummas tears  
  
Please Daddy  
Dont get drunk  
This Christmas  
I dont wanna see  
My Mumma cry  
Please Daddy  
Dont get drunk  
This Christmas  
I dont wanna see  
My Mumma cry  
No  
I dont wanna see  
My Mumma cry
