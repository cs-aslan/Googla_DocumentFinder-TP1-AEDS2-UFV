Watch me closely catch my eye  
If you do I beg you to remind me  
Who is stronger who is weak of those who seek  
And dont know where to find me  
  
Ask me why I dont know  
You ask me why and I say  
Now you see me now you dont  
I thourght by now youd learned  
Youre gonna get your fingers burned  
  
Watch me closely understand  
That what you see is only an illusion  
If Im wrong and you are right  
Then I will light your darkness with confusion  
  
Ask me why I dont know  
You ask me why and I say  
Chances are youre playing with fire  
I thought by now youd learned  
Youre gonna get your fingers burned  
  
Watch me closely be aware  
That all I do is only to suprise you  
Every move is sleight of hand  
And every word is planned to mystify you  
  
You ask me why I dont know  
You ask me why and I say  
Dont get fooled a second time  
I thought by now youd understand  
Youre gonna get your fingers burned
