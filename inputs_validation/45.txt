Bells are chiming for victory  
Theres a page back in history  
Forty five  
They came back to the world that they fought for  
Didnt turn out just like they thought  
Forty five  
  
Here is a song to sing to do the measuring  
What you lose what you gain what you win  
  
Nine years later a child is born  
Theres a record so you put it on  
Forty five  
Nine years more if were lucky now  
Nineyearold puts his money down  
Forty five  
Every scratch every click every heartbeat  
Every breath that I held for you  
Forty five  
Theres a stack of shellac and vinyl  
Which is yours now and which is mine  
Forty five  
  
Here is a song to sing to do the measuring  
What you lose what you gain what you win  
  
Bass and treble heal every hurt  
Theres a rebel in a nylon shirt  
But the words are a mystery Ive heard  
Til you turn it down to thirty three and a third  
Cause it helps with the elocution  
Corporations turn revolutions  
Forty five  
  
So dont you weep and shed  
Just change your name instead  
What you lose when it all goes to your head  
  
I heard something peculiar said  
Perhaps hes got a shot and now hes dead  
Forty five  
  
Bells are chiming and tears are falling  
It creeps up on you without a warning  
Forty five  
Every scratch every click every heartbeat  
Every breath that I bless  
Id be lost I confess  
Forty five
