Done laid around and stayed around  
This old town too long  
Summers almost gone  
Summers almost gone  
  
Done laid around and stayed around  
This old town too long  
And I feel like I want to travel on  
  
Ive waited here for almost a year  
Waitin for the sun to shine  
Waitin for the sun to shine  
Hopin youd change your mind  
  
Waited here for almost a year  
Hoping youd change your mind  
Now I feel like I want to travel on  
  
Well the chili wind will soon begin  
Ill be on my way  
Gone a lonesome day  
Going home to stay  
  
Chili wind will soon begin  
Ill be on my way  
Because I feel like I want to travel on  
  
Done laid around and stayed around  
This old town too long  
Summers almost gone  
Summers almost gone  
  
Done laid around and stayed around  
This old town too long  
And I feel like I want to travel on
