When Doggy Dogg comes  
You better answer Repeat x4  
  
Ahh used to be a hard kid  
Rhyme a rhyme and tap this  
Sippin silver satin while we smoked on the pin head  
A couch was a nigga bed  
  
Mary kept a nigga fed  
Twenty first a nigga yeah thats where a nigga live  
Im on the GA and fucked the DA  
Why Cause the railroad the homie easy  
  
And just cause the didnt know what Whasup  
Im on a motherfuckin mission to come up come up  
  
Chorus  
1 I feel like givin it up  
We all like livin it up Repeat x2  
  
2 When Doggy Dogg comes  
You better answer  
Part 1 overlaps Part 2  
  
We are living in a world  
Where anything can go at anytime  
And if you aint up on the game  
Then I suggest you rearrange  
  
Cause change gone come  
And it aint waitin on no one  
They got me plottin from the bottom  
With the  aint no stopin  
  
And all I want for Christmas is forty city hoppin  
Is the to much to ask fo oh no  
And I heard through the East side you spend to get some dough  
So when you get your funk go take to the store  
  
Take it to daddy rap cause hes a professional  
Guaranteed to get your shit up off the floor  
Beach city rider you know for sure  
You see that what flossin is all about  
  
The tightest rider gone turn it out  
Bouncin swirving and looking cute  
Dogg Pound out the moon Johnny longing for soup  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Everybody in my family is nervous and waitin  
How can I be patience  
Look at what Im facin  
They aint the ones that gonna be riding to the station  
  
So it what it all boils down to just some inspiration  
Interpretation the conversation you had with the judge  
Of all judges budge this  
And put it in perspective all praises due true  
  
We are living in a world  
Where anything can go at anytime  
And if you aint up on the game  
Then I suggest you rearrange  
  
Cause change gone come  
And it aint waitin on no one  
For all the drama I done went through  
To get this to ya  
  
How do I think I was gone do ya  
Have you been mislead since I asked you all to creep with me  
You coulndnt be cause ever since its been DP  
LBBS chronic in my chest  
  
Deathrow doggystyle holding down the west  
With a shot of what gangstas drink  
And a took off for a choke off the most kept my Gs off a toast  
And keep LBC singing yall DP ginging yall  
  
We and yall face it all  
Times living it up  
Snoop Dogg again and you know Im just giving it up  
  
Chorus x2  
  
When Doggy Dogg comes  
You better answer you better answer Repeat x15
