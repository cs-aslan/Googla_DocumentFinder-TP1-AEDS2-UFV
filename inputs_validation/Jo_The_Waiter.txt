Jo the waiter worked for me  
Serving wine in basement bars  
Only mad men ever stay got no time  
If your mindless please take mine  
  
Jo the waiter held me close  
Behind the door marked gentlemen  
Just for now thats all I need  
Wont someone call me friend  
Long gone I recall good times  
I must confess I cried  
  
We burned out and the line went dead  
At six oclock I felt so alone  
I crawled inside where else to go  
Could be dead for all you know  
Everyday I died for you  
Valium boys with painted eyes  
Young man need love special  
I dont think I want it at all  
  
Long gone I recall good times  
I must confess I cried  
Me I retired to a back street flat  
Picture eyes in a cold steel frame  
The freaks arrive  
Broken needles and blood  
What you on man to get those eyes  
  
Its very touching Im so close to me  
False smiles Ive rehearsed for days  
Come inside you wont know Im wrong  
Give me your heart Im so quickly gone
