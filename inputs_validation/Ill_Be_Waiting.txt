Hold me closer one more time  
Say that you love me in your last goodbye  
Please forgive me for my sins  
Yes I swam dirty waters  
But you pushed me in  
Ive seen your face under every sky  
Over every border and on every line  
You know my heart more than I do  
We were the greatest me and you  
  
But we had time against us  
And miles between us  
The heavens cried  
I know I left you speechless  
But now the sky has cleared and its blue  
And I see my future in you  
  
Ill be waiting for you when youre ready to love me again  
Ill put my hands up  
Ill do everything different  
Ill be better to you  
Ill be waiting for you when youre ready to love me again  
Ill put my hands up  
Ill be somebody different  
Ill be better to you  
  
Let me stay here for just one more night  
Build your world around me  
And pull me to the light  
So I can tell you that I was wrong  
I was a child then but now Im willing to learn  
  
But we had time against us  
And miles between us  
The heavens cried  
I know I left you speechless  
But now the sky has cleared and its blue  
And I see my future in you  
  
Ill be waiting for you when youre ready to love me again  
Ill put my hands up  
Ill do everything different  
Ill be better to you  
Ill be waiting for you when youre ready to love me again  
Ill put my hands up  
Ill be somebody different  
Ill be better to you  
  
Time against us  
Miles between us  
Heavens cried  
I know I left you speechless  
Time against us  
Miles between us  
Heavens cried  
I know I left you speechless  
I know I left you speechless  
  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting for you when youre ready to love me again  
Ill put my hands up  
Ill do everything different  
Ill be better to you  
Ill be waiting for you when youre ready to love me again  
Ill put my hands up  
Ill be somebody different  
Ill be better for you
