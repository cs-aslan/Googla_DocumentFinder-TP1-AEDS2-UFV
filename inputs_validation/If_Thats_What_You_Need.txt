Talking makes us human thats what I was told  
So why do I find it so difficult to let my feelings unfold  
Had I the courage to tell you Id promise you this  
  
If thats what you need  
Ill be the river Ill be the mountain always beside you  
If thats what you need  
I will be stronger I will be braver than ever before  
  
When you came along and turned it all around  
I promised myself I wouldnt tell you  
Until we stood on solid ground  
Holding the candle between us Ill tell you this  
  
If thats what you need  
Ill be the river Ill be the mountain always beside you  
If thats what you need  
I will be stronger I will be braver than ever before  
  
And if theres any kind of danger  
I hear you calling out my name  
You can follow in my footsteps  
And I will lead you safely back again  
  
I never understood you however hard I tried  
But it took me a while until I realized  
That all the problems were mine  
Holding you nearer to me to tell you this  
  
If thats what you need  
Ill be the river Ill be the mountain always beside you  
If thats what you need  
I will be stronger I will be braver than ever before  
And when things go wrong  
Ill be your conscience there to remind you all of your life  
When you go wrong  
Ill be the reason youll be protected all of your days
