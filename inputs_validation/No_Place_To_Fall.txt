If I had no place to fall  
And I needed to  
Could I count on you  
To lay me down  
  
Id never tell you no lies  
I dont believe its wise  
You got pretty eyes  
Wont you spin me round  
  
I aint much of a lover its true  
Im here then Im gone  
And Im forever blue  
But Im sure wanting you  
  
Skies full of silver and gold  
Try to hide the sun  
But it cant be done  
Least not for long  
  
And if we help each other grow  
While the light of day  
Smiles down our way  
Then we cant go wrong  
  
Time shes a fast old train  
Shes here then shes gone  
And she wont come again  
Wont you take my hand  
  
If I had no place to fall  
And I needed to  
Could I count on you  
To lay me down
