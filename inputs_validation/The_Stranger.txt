Well we all have a face that we hide away forever  
And we take them out and show ourselves when everyone has gone  
Some are satin some are steel  
Some are silk and some are leather  
Theyre the faces of a stranger  
But wed love to try them on  
  
Well we all fall in love  
But we disregard the danger  
Though we share so many secrets  
There are some we never tell  
Why were you so surprised that you never saw the stranger  
Did you ever let your lover see the stranger in yourself  
  
Dont be afraid to try again  
Everyone goes south every now and then  
Youve done it  
Why cant someone else  
You should know by now  
Youve been there yourself  
  
Once I used to believe I was such a great romancer  
Then I came home to a woman that I could not recognize  
When I pressed her for a reason  
She refused to even answer  
It was then I felt the stranger kick me right between the eyes  
  
Well we all fall in love  
But we disregard the danger  
Though we share so many secrets  
There are some we never tell  
Why were you so surprised that you never saw the stranger  
Did you ever let your lover see the stranger in yourself  
  
Dont be afraid to try again  
Everyone goes south every now and then  
Youve done it  
Why cant someone else  
You should know by now  
Youve been there yourself  
  
You may never understand how the stranger is inspired  
But he isnt always evil and he is not always wrong  
Though you drown in good intensions  
You will never quench the fire  
Youll give in to your desire when the stranger comes along
