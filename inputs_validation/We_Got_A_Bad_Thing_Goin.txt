You got a one horse ranch in Texas you got a mansion in Spain  
You blew in on a Greyhound bus honey you flew in your own plane  
You got drunk on whiskey seen you get tipsy on wine  
We got a bad thing goin its just a bad thing goin  
We got a bad thing goin but dont it feel fine  
You sure are a high class lady you got a blue blood in your veins  
Youre a rose in the bright sunshine Im a cowboy in the rain  
We aint got nothin in common cept for a little time  
We got a bad thing goin  
Youre a rodeo rattler and a midnight gambler you aint never had a job  
And I just found out your daddy owns a bank I was fixin to rob  
 guitar   
You got a one horse ranch in Texas  
Yeah we aint got nothin in common you know that girl you must have missed it  
Be like ridin in them barrel races and like sailin them boats
