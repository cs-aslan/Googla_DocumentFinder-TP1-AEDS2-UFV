Martha say she dont need no stinking man making no decisions for her  
She dont need his money she dont need him between the sheets  
She aint gonna sleep on the edge of the bed for no stinking man  
And thats the way she lives cause I saw her last night  
Pouring water on a drowning man in the moonlight saying  
  
Hidehidehi brother  
Hidehidehey now Martha  
Hidehidehi sister  
Say what hey you look out Martha  
  
Martha say she dont need no revolver to shoot some idiot down  
She can do it with her eyes she can do it with her smile  
She can do it with a conversation just walking down the hall  
Man now aint that the truth cause i saw her take a bite out of  
Some macho dude laying some corn ball line on her last night saying  
  
Hidehidehi brother  
Hidehidehey now Martha  
Hidehidehi sister  
Say what hey you look out Martha  
  
Hidehidehi brother Hidehidehi brother

Martha say say she aint changin no nothin for nobody for no damn good

Well the girl loves playing hardball it leaves me in a no win situation
saying

Hidehidehey now Martha  
Hidehidehi sister  
Say what hey you look out Martha
