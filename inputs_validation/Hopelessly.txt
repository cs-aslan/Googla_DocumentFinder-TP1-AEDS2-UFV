I walk the wire every night  
I cant decide between wrong and right  
Ive lost control over the things I do  
Cause Im hopelessly falling in love with you  
  
Now the one who never took a chance  
Becomes a victim of circumstance  
Ive lost my way now Im so confused  
Cause Im hopelessly falling in love with you  
  
All my dreams are far behind me  
They dont matter any more  
I dont care about the things I could lose  
Cause Im hopelessly falling in love with you  
  
Now the one who always played it safe  
Becomes another whos lost his way  
I cant believe it though I know its true  
Cause Im hopelessly falling in love with you  
  
All my dreams begin to blind me  
And I was so confused  
And I dont care about the things I could lose  
Cause Im hopelessly falling in love with you  
  
Im not gonna fight it Im gonna choose  
To hopelessly fall oh yeah  
You know Ill hopelessly fall in love with you
