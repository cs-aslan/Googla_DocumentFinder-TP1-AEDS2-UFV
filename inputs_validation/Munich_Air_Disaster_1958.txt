We love them  
We mourn for them  
Unlucky boys of red  
  
I wish Id gone down  
Gone down with them  
To where mother nature makes their bed  
  
We miss them  
Every night we kiss them  
Their faces fixed in our heads  
  
I wish Id gone down  
Gone down with them  
To where mother nature makes their bed  
  
They cant hurt you  
Their style will never desert you  
Because theyre all safely dead  
  
I wish Id gone down  
Gone down with them
