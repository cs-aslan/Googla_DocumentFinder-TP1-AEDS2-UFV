God knows how I love you  
Like a user needs a drug  
And Ill never be free of ya  
You are poison in my blood  
I tried to swim that river  
And get to higher ground  
I been three times under  
The next onell see me drown  
  
But I dont want to talk about it now  
I dont want to talk about it now  
I dont want to talk about it now  
I want to go down  
  
God knows why you dont want me  
No one would do the things I do  
But to my grave its gonna haunt me  
How I got down on my knees for you  
You are my obsession  
And the reason that I live  
You alreday got my soul  
Theres nothin left to give  
  
But I dont want to talk about it now  
I dont want to talk about it now  
I dont want to talk about it now  
I want to go down  
  
The devil is deep water baby  
And Im in way over my head  
But Id be drawn and quartered  
If I could keep you in my bed  
I cant break this spell  
I know the trouble that Im in  
But If I got out of the mouth of hell  
Id walk right back again  
  
But I dont want to talk about it now  
I dont want to talk about it now  
I dont want to talk about it now  
I want to go down
