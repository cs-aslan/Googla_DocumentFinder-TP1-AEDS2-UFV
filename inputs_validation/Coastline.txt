I drive to the coastline  
Looking for visual pleasures to catch my eye  
The sun turns around hits me on the shoulder  
I fly away  
Due to the situation this morning  
All in the worlds OK  
I head down Sunset north to Santa Barbara  
We sail away  
I could live in the walls of a prison  
Where the warm summer winds would never blow  
Then again think of what Id be missing as to the other side  
And how some do it Ill never know Ill never know  
I must have spent a lifetime as a sailor  
Sailin the ocean blue  
But every single waterway leads to you  
To you  
I could live in the walls of a prison  
Where the warm summer winds would never blow  
Then again think of what Id be missing as to the other side  
And how some do it Ill never know Ill never know  
Im headin out over an ocean of blue  
The trailin wake far behind  
Wont turn me down  
And it wont turn me around  
I could live in the walls of a prison  
Where the warm summer winds would never blow  
Then again think of what Id be missing as to the other side  
And how some do it Ill never know Ill never know
