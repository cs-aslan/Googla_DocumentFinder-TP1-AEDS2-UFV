I wake up to find you laying awake  
With your hands in your head  
You cannot run cant escape from the things  
That you sayayay  
  
And you can tell anybody  
Anybody who comes  
You can tell anybody  
But the damages done  
The new days begun  
  
One night can change everything in your life  
One night can make everything alright  
One night can turn all your colors to white  
One night  its easier said than done  
  
Turning and turning but never returning  
To what you once had  
Learning to care for the ones you hold dear  
But its too its too bad  
  
One night can change everything in your life  
One night can make everything alright  
One night can turn all your colors to white  
One night  its easier said than done  
  
All that I am  
All that I am  
All that I am  
  
Laying beside you as cold as a statue  
Your hands are still warm  
Trying to wake you as daylight brakes through  
The eye of the storm  
  
So you can tell everybody  
Everybody who comes  
You can tell everybody  
But the damages done  
The new days begun  
  
One night can change everything in your life  
One night can make everything alright  
One night can turn all your colors to white  
One night  its easier said than done  
  
One night one one night one  
One night  its easier said than done
