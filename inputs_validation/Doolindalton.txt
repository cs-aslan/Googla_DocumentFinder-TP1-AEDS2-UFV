They were duelin DoolinDalton  
High or low it was the same  
Easy money an faithless women  
Redeye whiskey for the pain  
  
Go down Bill Dalton it must be Gods will  
Two brothers lyin dead in Coffeyville  
Two voices call to you from were they stood  
Lay down your law books now theyre no damn good  
  
Better keep on movin DoolinDalton  
Til your shadow sets you free  
An if youre fast an if youre lucky  
You will never see that hangin tree  
  
Old towns lay out across the dusty plains  
Like graveyards filled with tomb stones waitin for the names  
And a man could his back or use his brains  
But some just went stir crazy Lord cause nothin ever changed  
  
Til Bill Doolin met Bill Dalton  
He was workin cheap just bidin time  
An then he laughed and said Im going  
And so he left that peaceful life behind
