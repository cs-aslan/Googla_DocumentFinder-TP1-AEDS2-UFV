Love takes the patience of Job  
Thats what my Mama always said  
Faith is the belief in something more than what you know  
Thats what the Good Book says  
You gotta play the cards you got  
Who knows what fate is holding  
At times you gotta go without knowing where youre going  
  
Thats why I keep on lovin you  
I keep on lovin you  
Through the baby dont leave mes  
And never will agains  
And I promise tos  
I keep on lovin you  
  
Lord knows weve had our share of fights  
Our sleepless nights our ups and downs  
Weve had plenty and then some of baby Im gones and turnarounds  
Sometimes I swear it might be easier to throw in the towel  
Someday were gonna look back  
Say look at us now  
  
Thats why I keep on lovin you  
I keep on lovin you  
Through the baby dont leave mes  
And never will agains  
And I promise tos  
I keep on lovin you  
  
Keep on lovin you  
Through the I take it backs  
I didnt mean it like thats  
Id never hurt yous  
Oh I keep on lovin you  
  
I keep on lovin you  
I keep on lovin you  
Through the I take it backs  
I didnt mean it like that  
Id never hurt yous  
Oh I keep on lovin you  
I keep on lovin you  
I keep on lovin you
