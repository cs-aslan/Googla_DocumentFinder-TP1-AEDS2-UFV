Is that the clown service Im callin  
Ive made a fool of myself again  
Theres a hole in my pocket a patch on my pants  
My shoes let in water Im feeling youre here  
Look up the smile service operator  
Ive got some frown lines that need to be read  
I look in the mirror I sigh all the time  
The face that I see I know it aint mine  
Ooh we lady if I had my baby  
I wouldnt be wastin your time  
Ooh we lady if I had my baby  
I wouldnt be blockin blockin your line  
Is that the love service Im callin  
Come on over mend my broken heart  
Was it so silly was Cupid so stupid  
Or maybe it wasnt to be that way at all  
Ooh we lady if I had my baby  
I wouldnt be wastin your time  
Ooh we lady if I had my baby  
I wouldnt be blockin blockin your line
