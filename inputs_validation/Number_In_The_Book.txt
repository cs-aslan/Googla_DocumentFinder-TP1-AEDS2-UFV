No glove no love  
Youve been hearing this so many times  
Dont you think its time  
To be a little more responsible  
Too many people die these days oh  
If you read the papers check out the news  
The numbers are there  
Every number represents a human being  
Who was a father who was a mother  
A son or a daughter of this landoh  
You dont make the commitment but your body does  
Even if youre dead silent  
  
Chorus  
You are here today tomorrow you are gone  
You dont want to be another number in the book x3  
  
In the shadows of the night  
A lady from the street corner talks to a customer  
Money exchanges hands  
Thats the formality and she says  
No glove no love  
You can pay me well but it aint worth my life  
Too many people die these days  
If you read the papers check out the news  
The numbers are there  
Every number represents a human being  
Who was a father who was a mother  
A son or a daughter of this landoh  
It aint worth my lifeoh
