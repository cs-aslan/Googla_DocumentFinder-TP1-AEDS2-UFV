So your plane was late  
You missed that date  
And your horse cant win  
So you drink another bottle of gin  
  
And your shares went down  
They touched the ground  
And your best laid plans  
Have slipped right out of your hands  
  
So you think youre fat  
Well thats a fact  
But your well ran dry  
So you had to walk another mile  
  
Think about them think about them  
Think about those wholl never see another year  
Think about them  
Think about those who never saw  
  
So your car wont start  
Needs a special part  
But you made your choice  
Now youre stuck with all your big boys toys  
  
Now the words around  
Youve gone aground  
And youve lost your wind  
Youll never see your ship come in  
  
Think about them think about them  
Think about those wholl never see another year  
Think about them  
Think about those wholl never see another year  
  
Mothers fathers  
Sisters brothers  
Old man young man  
Whale song all gone  
Where did we go wrong  
  
Think about those wholl never see another  
Those wholl never see another  
Those wholl never see  
Think about them think about them
