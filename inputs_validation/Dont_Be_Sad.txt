Seen a lot of things we didnt want to see  
But Im glad we did  
I know a lot of times we fell out of line  
But we fell back in  
  
I think we lost the keys to the kingdom  
Before wed seen them  
Dont be sad  
Dont be sad  
  
It took a lot time for us to find the words wed mean  
We spent a lot time before our dimes run out nickel please  
I think we lost the keys to the kingdom  
Before wed seen them  
  
Dont be sad  
Dont be sad  
Dont be sad  
Dont be sad  
  
Cause we wont have to live this way forever  
Its hard to compromise the things we have  
Dont be sad  
Dont be sad  
  
Talk to one to have faith  
Money can not erase  
I think we lost the keys to the kingdom  
Before wed seen them  
  
Dont be sad  
Dont be sad  
Dont be sad  
Talk to one to have faith  
Money can not erase
