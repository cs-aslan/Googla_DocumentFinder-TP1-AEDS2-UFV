Theres something different about you  
And as I look in your eyes  
It says true love has finally found you  
And given you back your smile  
Im sorry I couldnt love you  
The way I always meant to  
Now theres someone else to play that part  
  
I hope he comforts the child in your heart  
I hope he understands the woman you are  
And may he never take for granted  
The little things that make love work  
And most of all  
I hope hes all that you deserve  
  
I hear the way you talk about him  
And suddenly its all so clear  
Its time for me to learn to move on  
How deep in my heart youre still there  
But I want to see you happy  
Even if it means that Ill make  
Room for someone else to play that part  
  
I hope he comforts the child in your heart  
I hope he understands the woman you are  
And may he never take for granted  
The little things that make love work  
And most of all  
I hope hes all that you deserve  
  
Now and forever you will always be  
Someone who owns a place inside of me  
The only way I can let you know  
Is by letting go  
Now as I let you go  
  
I hope he comforts the child in your heart  
I hope he understands the woman you are  
May he never take for granted  
The little things that make love work  
But most of all  
I hope hes all that you deserve  
Ooh yeah  
Most of all  
I wish you all that you deserve  
All that you deserve
