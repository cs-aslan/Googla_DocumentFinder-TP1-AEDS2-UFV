Gabe  
Theyve managed to get rid of me  
Returned me to the grave  
Ect electric chair we shock who we cant save  
Theyve cleared you of my memory and many more as well  
You may have wanted some of them but who can ever tell  
Your brainwaves are more regular the chemistry more pure  
The headaches and the nausea will pass and youll endure  
You son is gone forever though of that the doctors sure  
The memories will wane  
The aftershocks remain  
You wonder which is worse the symptom or the cure  
  
Theyve managed to get rid of me Im gone without a trace  
But sear the soul and leave scar no treatment can erase  
Theyve cut away the cancer but forgot to fill the hole  
They removed me from your memory Im still there in your soul  
Your life goes back to normal now or so they all believe  
Your heart is in your chest again not hanging from your sleeve  
Theyve driven out the demons and theyve earned you this reprieve  
The memories are gone  
The aftershocks live on  
But with nothing to remember  
Is there nothing left to grieve  
  
Diana  
With nothing to remember
