On the first page of our story  
The future seemed so bright  
Then this thing turned out so evil  
I dont know why Im still surprised  
Even angels have their wicked schemes  
And you take that to new extremes  
But youll always be my hero  
Even though youve lost your mind  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
Ohhh I love the way you lie  
  
Rihannas Part 2  
Now theres gravel in our voices  
Glass is shattered from the fight  
And this tug of war youll always win  
Even when Im right  
Cause you feed me fables from your head  
With violent words and empty threats  
And its sick that all these battles  
Are what keeps me satisfied  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
Ohhh I love the way you lie  
  
Rihannas Part 3  
So maybe Im a masochist  
I try to run but I dont wanna ever leave  
Til the walls are goin up  
In smoke with all our memories  
  
Eminems Part  
Its morning you wake a sunray hits your face  
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction  
Hush baby speak softly tell me youre awfully sorry  
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night  
So I can push you off me  
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me  
Run out the room and Ill follow you like a lost puppy  
Baby without you Im nothing Im so lost hug me  
Then tell me how ugly I am but that youll always love me  
Then after that shove me in the aftermath of the  
Destructive path that were on two psychopaths but we  
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each others backs  
That well have each others backs cause were that lucky  
Together we move mountains lets not make mountains out of molehills  
You hit me twice yeah but whos countin  
I may have hit you three times Im startin to lose count  
But together well live forever we found the youth fountain  
Our love is crazy were nuts but I refused counsellin  
This house is too huge if you move out Ill burn all two thousand  
Square feet of it to the ground aint shit you can do about it  
With you Im in my fckin mind without you Im out it  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie
