Ah  
  
You know I cant smile without you  
  
I cant smile without you  
  
I cant laugh and I cant sleep  
  
I dont even talk to people I meet  
  
And I feel sad when youre sad  
  
I feel glad when youre glad  
  
And you must know what Im goin thru  
  
I just cant smile without you  
  
  
You came along just like a song  
  
You brightened my day  
  
Whod believe you were part of a dream  
  
That only seemed light years away  
  
  
And you know I cant smile without you  
  
I cant smile without you  
  
And you must know what Im goin thru  
  
I just cant smile without you  
  
  
Some people say the happiness wave  
  
Is somethin thats hard to find  
  
Into the new leavin the old behind me  
  
And I feel sad when youre sad  
  
I feel glad when youre glad  
  
And you must know what Im goin thru  
  
I just cant smile without you  
  
  
Into the new leaving the old behind me  
  
And I feel sad when youre sad  
  
I feel glad when youre glad  
  
And you must know what Im goin thru  
  
I just cant smile without you  
  
  
You must know what Im goin thru  
  
I just cant smile without you
