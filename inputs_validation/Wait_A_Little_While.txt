Heres a sweet September morning theres the sense of Autumn on the rise  
He steps into the wind and sadly sighs  
Why does it always seem to be theres a cold December wind in front of me  
The more he fills his empty evenings  
The less he feels that theres a chance to find  
Something that can bring a peace of mind  
Is there a place where you can go  
A little something you should know to turn the tide to your favor  
  
Chorus  
  
Wait a little while to welcome what youre after  
Give it the time to find its way to you  
And soon as you no longer try youll turn and find it standing by your side  
Come and get it when you let it itll come to you  
  
When I run short on inspiration I best recall what Ive known all along  
N I remember sweet Septembers song there never really has to be  
A cold and bitter wind in front of me anymore  
  
Just forget it and wait a little while while while  
Wait a little while everything will come to you in time  
Wait a little while  everything will come to you in time  
Wait a little while  every little things gonna come to you in time  
Wait a little while  everything will come to you in time  
Wait a little while  everything will come to you in time  
Wait a little while
