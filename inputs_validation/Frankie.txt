Dark weekends in the sun out on Chelsea Road  
Descending the stairs Frankie my one  
Check your makeup in the mirror cmon babe lets go  
Well dance round this dirty town til the night is all done  
Let all the finer things sleep alone tonight  
Let all the minor kings lose their thrones tonight  
Dont worry about us baby well be alright  
  
Well everybodys dying this towns closing down  
Theyre all sittin down at the courthouse waiting for em to take the flag
down  
I see strange flashes in the sky up above  
Gonna spend the night at the drivein with the one that I love  
At dusk the stars all appear on the screen  
Yeah just like they do each night in my dreams  
But tonights no dream Frankie I can feel myself too  
Well now and forever my love is for you  
  
Walk softly tonight little stranger  
Yeah into these shadows were passing through  
Talk softly tonight little angel  
You make all my dream worlds come true  
  
Well lately Ive been standing out in the freezing rain  
Readin them want ads out on Chelsea Road  
Im winging down the street in search of new games  
Hustling through these nightlights diamond glow  
Well Frankie I dont know what Im gonna find  
Maybe nothing at all maybe a world I can call mine  
Shining like these streetlights down here on the strand  
Bright as the rain in the palm of your hand  
  
Walk softly tonight little stranger  
Into the shadows where lovers go  
Talk softly to me little angel  
Whisper your secrets so soft and low
