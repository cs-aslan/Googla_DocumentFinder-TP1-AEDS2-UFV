Eleanors Castle boy what a hassle  
Why did you have to build yorr walls so high  
Id put my arm around you but a moat surrounds you  
The only ways to let your drawbridge down  
  
Nights without number Im without slumber  
Thinking of ways to breach your turrets tall  
Youre an iron lady and someday maybe  
Youll forget to bar the iron door  
  
Man was made to conquer so the story goes  
I wish I knew who said it he could help me cause he knows  
This situations gettin way out of line  
I cant win if you wont let me in  
Aint it a sin its a sin she wont let him in  
  
Break  
  
Shielded from my advances theres very few chances  
Im a one man crusade fightin in vain  
Rack my brains for ideas but it appears  
Compared to you dragons are easily slain
