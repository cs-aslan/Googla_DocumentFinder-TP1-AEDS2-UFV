Wont you think about it  
Do you know that its easier said when its done  
Were all in this together  
Im not asking too much  
Just some time to stay for as long  
As you can  
Its already tomorrow  
  
Looking out for something outside  
Im sure you can give me the answer  
Wont you say youll give me some time  
Thats all I can ask for an answer  
  
Everybodys leavin wont you try  
To let me show you how  
Put some weight on your shoulders  
Everybody knew your eyes were searching  
Around the room  
Till I saw you  
  
Looking out for something outside  
Im sure you can give me the answer  
Wont you say youll give me some time  
Thats all I can ask for an answer  
  
What am I to do  
What am I to do  
When she turns me down  
Just give up on you  
Cant stop all I need to the ground
