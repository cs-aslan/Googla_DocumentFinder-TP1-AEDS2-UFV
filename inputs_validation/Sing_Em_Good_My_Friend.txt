He was selling an old guitar at a bar  
I saw her smiling picture in his wallet  
He said I call her baby but her Christian name is Charlotte  
  
She spends her days downtown hooked up to some machine  
The say time can heal but time cant heal everything  
The Lords gonna take her home real soon flying on angels wings  
  
Im gonna cry right now and thats okay  
Were all gonna die someday  
You wont remember a single word Im trying to say  
  
Its all a grand illusion when you think youre in control  
Shes all I got left of sellin everything I own  
Theres no good in a goodbye its the beginning of the end  
I left some songs in the guitar  
Sing em good my friend  
  
This old guitar and case has been in a million bars  
Been a fools disciple miss dance recitals  
And the birth of every child  
Honestly honesty never goes out of style  
So sing the pain my friend  
  
So the world shes her as just desperate grey and old  
All I see is my true love my heart my life my soul  
At least for one more night I got a beautiful wrinkled hand to hold  
So sing the truth my friend  
  
Im gonna cry right now and thats okay  
Were all gonna die someday  
You wont remember a single word Im tryin to say  
  
Its all a grand illusion when you think youre in control  
Shes all I got left of selling everything I own  
Theres no good in a goodbye its the beginning of the end  
I left some songs in the guitar  
Sing em good my friend  
  
Im gonna sing the pain Im in  
Im gonna sing the truth within  
Im gonna sing them good for my old friend  
  
Well I cried when I got in my truck so I put on my shades  
Looked up at the crimson sky as the sun began to fade  
And for the first time in a long time I swear  
I think I prayed  
  
Im gonna sing the pain Im in  
Im gonna sing the truth within  
Im gonna sing them good for my old friend  
Yeah my old friend
