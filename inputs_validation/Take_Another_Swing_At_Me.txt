I know I sent you packin  
But now I want you back again  
Livin without you aint no livin at all  
  
How I miss your naggin  
And your tongue awaggin  
And the crash of the coffee cup up against the bedroom wall  
  
In the kitchen early in the mornin  
Midnight walkin the floor  
Without your cryin cussin and your moanin  
Home aint home anymore  
  
So come on honey  
Come home and spend my money  
Come back mama and take another swing at me  
  
I told my friends how I sent you runnin  
Cause you didnt do me right  
But if I looked up and saw you comin  
You could do me wrong all night  
  
So come on honey  
Come home and spend my money  
Come back mama and take another swing at me
