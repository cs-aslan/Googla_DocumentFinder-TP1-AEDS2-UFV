Hes got a split finger wrap  
And his ropes pulled way too tight  
Hes got a lunatic smile  
Cause hes really drawn deep tonight  
  
Hes got a fever fever fever fever  
Grab a holda anythin and hold on tight  
It hits you like a venom from a rattlesnake bite  
Were all here cause hes not all there tonight  
  
He takes one last breath  
And time turns inside out  
Then the gate busts open  
To the world he dreams about  
  
Hes got a fever fever fever fever  
Stick a rope on anything cause he dont care  
Hed even take a ride in an electric chair  
Were all here cause hes not all there tonight  
  
He says its really kind of simple  
Keep your mind in the middle  
While your butt spins round and round  
Take heed to Sankeys preachin  
Keep liftin and reachin  
And ridin like there aint no clowns  
  
What he loves might kill him  
But hes got no choice  
Hes a different breed  
With a voice down deep inside  
Thats screamin he was born to ride  
  
Hes got a fever fever fever fever  
Fever makes you crazy cause it makes no sense  
Like runnin from your shadow out of selfdefense  
But he wont run and baby he cant hide  
He thinks the odds are even leavin one hand tied  
He gets so tired of hangin on so tight  
I know you think hes crazy well I think youre right  
Were all here cause hes not all there  
Thats right
