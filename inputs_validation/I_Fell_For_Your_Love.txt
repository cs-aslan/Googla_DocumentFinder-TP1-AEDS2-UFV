Hey baby so now youre goin is your mind relieved  
Did you get what you wanted and have some fun playin make believe  
I have never lost so much pleasure so its hard to be nice  
Hey baby feel my hand aint it cold as ice  
  
Chorus  
cause I fell for your love when I was out of my mind  
I fell for your love and now you tell me its time  
To kiss it away to stand here and say goodbye  
  
Cant you understand the way I live  
Half a love is all that I can give  
Lonely ladies and empty faces for a long long time  
And you might be one baby when we meet again and Ill still try to make you
mine  
  
Chorus  
  
I fell for your love when I was out of my mind  
I fell for your love when love was so hard to find  
I gave you my heart and now you tell me its time  
To give up my love when its so damn hard to find  
  
Love is so hard to find  
Love is so hard to find  
Love is so hard to find  
Im so lonely baby  
Love is so hard to find  
Them empty faces all I wanted was you  
Love is so hard to find  
  
I gave you my heart and now you tell me its time  
Love is so hard to find  
To stand and say goodbye  
Love is so hard to find  
Love is so hard to find  
Love is so hard to find  
When its so damn hard to find  
Love is so hard to find  
I fell for your love when I was out of my mind  
and so on to fade
