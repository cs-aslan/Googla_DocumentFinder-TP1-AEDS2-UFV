Like you said youd never get used to it  
But its lost that old surprise  
Time comes and goes so quiet now  
Leaves emptiness behind our eyes  
Oh darling if I could spare us  
From an hour of the pain  
Like you said youd never get used to it  
But loves worn out again  
Winters here bring the blankets out  
To cover up the cold  
Im dreamin of the good nights sleep  
Like I used to know in days of old  
You told me you felt all alone  
But you did not tell me when  
Like you said youd never get used to it  
But loves worn out again  
Loves worn out again darling  
Its moved around the bend darling  
Theres no telling when  
Well feel it again  
Oh maybe I cant see whats plainly in my view  
Oh I wish I was a better man maybe its just you  
But theres something goin on here  
Like a wound that will not mend  
Like you said youd never get used to it  
But loves worn out again  
Loves worn out again darling  
Its moved around the bend darling  
Theres no telling when  
Well feel it again  
Loves worn out again darling  
Its moved around the bend darling  
Theres no telling when  
Well feel it again  
Loves worn out again darling  
Its moved around the bend darling  
Theres no telling when  
Well feel it again
