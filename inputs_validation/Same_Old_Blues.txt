Morning rain keeps on falling  
Like the tears that fall from my eyes  
As I sit in my room  
Staring out at the gloom  
Thats the rain in the same old blues  
  
I cant help I cant help but thinking  
When the sun used to shine on my back door  
Now the sun is turned to rain  
All my laughter is turned to pain  
Yes its the same the same old blues  
  
Sunshine sunshine is all you see now  
But it all it all looks like clouds by me  
When I sit in my room  
Staring out at the gloom  
Its the rain its the same old blues  
Yeah yes its the rain its the same old blues  
Yeah yes its the rain its the same old blues
