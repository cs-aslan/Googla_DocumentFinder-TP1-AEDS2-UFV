How longs a tear take to dry  
When a woman has no breeze  
How longs a tear take to dry  
When a woman when a womans on her knees  
  
How longs a tear take to dry  
When a woman hasnt sinned  
How longs a tear take to dry  
When the weather when the weather brings no wind  
  
Look Im sorry that I hurt you  
You look a million dollars and a dime  
Times the greatest healer  
But loves the greatest stealer of all time  
  
Im so sorry  
My hearts broken mines the same  
I still love you make it plural  
Youre so sweet  
The flowers smell sweeter the closer you are to the grave  
The flowers smell sweeter the closer you are to the grave  
  
How longs a tear take to dry  
When almighty brings is rain  
How longs a tear take to dry  
And do tears and do tears really stain  
  
This heart was like a tardis  
I went and lost the key in a fight  
Ive never found a locksmith  
Will you be my locksmith tonight  
Will I shite  
  
Im so sorry make it plural  
My hearts broken mines the same  
I still love you make it plural  
Youre so sweet  
The flowers smell sweeter the closer you are to the grave  
The flowers smell sweeter the closer you are to the grave  
  
How long does sorry really last  
Is it tattooed upon your heart  
Or is it hung in a museum  
With your Mona Lisa Mona Lisa exass art  
  
I have no summer Ill buy you summer  
Ill buy July if December makes you cry  
A little or no trace face belies a lie of many days gone by  
A little or no trace face belies a lie of many days gone by
