Its a can of gasoline  
Trapped in a sink  
And I think  
Bad things are happening  
And I just happen to think  
That someones gonna grab it and fling  
It all over the napkins and the flammable rabbit mink  
After they drink  
Its gonna be on of those hazardous things  
Where people just sit back and laugh as its happening  
Im trapped by kin  
And hundreds  
Of bungee jumping  
Bad acting friends  
How can this be happening  
  
Thats just the first verse
