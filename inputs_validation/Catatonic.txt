Fear is just interpretation  
Feeds my motivation  
Our time together is  
A bloodbath of serenity  
Plead no more  
Theres no confusing the finale  
Excitation  
My rancid passion is electrified  
  
Accept this  
My religion of torture  
I cant see any purity  
Just imperfection and obscenity  
My blood soaked hands devise  
Your slow methodic demise  
Asphyxiate the world  
Its blind without me  
  
Catatonic  
Catatonic  
Im numb in priceless solitude  
Exhilarating keeping pieces of you near  
  
Visions of decapitation  
My mental masturbation  
I try to resurrect  
Your consciousness your intellect  
Once so pure  
Your pain excites and it tests me  
Excitation  
The empty stare emitting from your eyes  
  
Embrace it  
My religion of torture  
All I see are the impurities  
The imperfections and obscenities  
  
Accept it  
The religion of torture  
Excitation  
The rancid passion coming from your eyes  
  
My blood soaked hands devise  
Your slow methodic demise  
Asphyxiate the world  
Its blind without me  
  
Catatonic  
Catatonic  
Im numb in priceless solitude  
Exterminating all the voiceless multitudes  
I cant stop because its so hypnotic  
Catatonic
