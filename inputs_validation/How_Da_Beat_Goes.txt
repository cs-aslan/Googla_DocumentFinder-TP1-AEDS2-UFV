Chorus  
Its all night  
And its all right  
Til the sunlight  
This is how the beat goes on  
Big Will

Poppin  
Rockin n  
Stompin  
This is how the beat goes on  
Big Will  
Tra Knox  
So hot  
This is how the beat goes on  
  
Its the bizzi wizza  
Jizzi wizzil

Back again but with a couple of friends  
Thought my reign would end well now Im rubbing it in  
Im back yes yes yallin  
Back again balling  
Out for a couple of years thought I had fallen  
You seen me with Denzel and Russel Crowe  
But yo the movies just a chick on the side Im in love with the flow  
Time off to be an Oscar nominee now  
Back to the MIsee to emcee now  
Rockin the ol heads blazing the youth  
Only rapper had the president raising the roof  
Check the tape checkmate  
Its one mission  
Make your move  
Dont fight submission  
To dawn to dusk  
We on a truss  
Just dont miss the bus  
To jam on with us  
Come on  
  
Chorus  
  
This is  
How the  
Beat goes on and on and on and  
Me and TraKnox keep keeping it on an  
Jokers aint stop until the morning  
  
So  
Every everybody come feel this  
This union this spirit  
Created from the soul oh yeah  
Its big will who else  
And TraKnox keeping it real  
Tearing up the club  
We got what you want  
So you cannot front  
Everybody get on the floor  
  
Yo we aint stopping til the morning  
Me and TraKnox keep keeping it on an keep keep on  
  
Chorus  
  
A hip hop superhero  
A   
Cape or a suit  
Hit the studio  
Every year or so  
And escape with the loot  
On my down time straight to the links  
I could pack a dance floor a movie theatre or truck from   
On Christmas mom and wife douse em with ice  
AOL search will smith thousands of sites  
And at the club hands clapping toes tapping  
Sucker Im the greatest thing ever happen to rapping in Ali voice  
Best shape of my life destined to show ya  
No scrapes or fender benders lead the game total  
Free dont move hip hop mogul  
Philly aint happy I  
I be the guy to go  
The guy to go  
You know the go to go  
The mega man that got the whole crew like  
Damn will done did it again  
He done stepped up to the plate and he done hit it again  
Yo get them hands up  
Throw your hands up  
Wave em like you dont care  
You like the sound  
Then let me hear you say  
  
Chorus
