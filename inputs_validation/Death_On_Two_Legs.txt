Words and music by freddie mercury  
  
You suck my blood like a leech  
You break the law and you preach  
Screw my brain till it hurts  
Youve taken all my money  
And you want more  
Misguided old mule with your pig headed rules  
With your narrow minded cronies  
Who are fools of the first division  
Death on two legs  
Youre tearing me apart  
Death on two legs  
Youve never had a heart of your own  
Kill joy bad guy big talking small fry  
Youre just an old barrow boy  
Have you found a new toy to replace me  
Can you face me  
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye  
Feel good are you satisfied  
Do you feel like suicide  
i think you should  
Is your conscience all right  
Does it plague you at night  
Do you feel good feel good  
  
You talk like a big business tycoon  
Youre just a hot air balloon  
So no one gives you a damn  
Youre just an overgrown schoolboy  
Let me tan your hide  
A dog with disease  
Youre the king of the sleaze  
Put your money where your mouth is  
Mister knowall  
Was the fin on your back  
Part of the deal shark  
Death on two legs  
Youre tearing me apart  
Death on two legs  
Youve never had a heart you never did of your own  
right from the start  
Insane you should be put inside  
Youre a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride  
Should be made unemployed  
Then make yourself null and void  
Make me feel good i feel good
