In the deepest part of me  
Like an unknown memory  
I was never meant to find  
Little seed of purity  
And you dont belong to me  
Still Im blinded by its light  
DONT TRY TO MAKE IT RIGHT  
  
Does anybody know bout love  
Does anybody care bout God  
If youre with me sing sorrow  
  
Penny for your thoughts I fear  
we need a little help round here  
If youre with me sing sorrow  
  
When the stars dont ever heal  
Do you fear youll never feel  
What it is to be at peace  
YOURE CRAVING A RELEASE  
  
Does anybody know bout love  
Does anybody care bout God  
If youre with me sing sorrow  
  
Penny for your thoughts I fear  
we need a little help round here  
If youre with me sing sorrow  
  
I dont understand here  
Why God would do me this way  
I lived a life  
Was always good  
The one thing I need to take away  
  
TO TAKE WAY  
THE ONE THING TAKE AWAY  
THE ONE THING TAKE AWAY  
THE ONE THING TAKE AWAY  
THE ONE THING TAKE AWAY  
just take away  
THE ONE THING TAKE AWAY  
one thing to take away  
THE ONE THING TAKE AWAY  
one thing to take away  
AWAY AWAY  
  
It took away my world  
all it left was pain  
and all this time was for nothing  
  
Does anybody know about love  
Does anybody care about God  
If youre with me sing sorrow  
  
Penny for your thoughts I fear  
we need a little help round here  
If youre with me sing sorrow
