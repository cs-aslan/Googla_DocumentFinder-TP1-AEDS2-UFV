Every time I think of you  
I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue  
Its no problem of mine  
But its a problem I find  
Living a life that I cant leave behind  
But theres no sense in telling me  
The wisdom of the fool wont set you free  
But thats the way that it goes  
And its what nobody knows  
Well every day my confusion grows  
  
Every time I see you falling  
I get down on my knees and pray  
Im waiting for that final moment  
You say the words that I cant say  
  
I feel fine and I feel good  
Im feeling like I never should  
Whenever I get this way  
I just dont know what to say  
Why cant we be ourselves like we were yesterday  
Im not sure what this could mean  
I dont think youre what you seem  
I do admit to myself  
That if I hurt someone else  
Then Ill never see just what were meant to be  
  
Every time I see you falling  
I get down on my knees and pray  
Im waiting for that final moment  
You say the words that I cant say
