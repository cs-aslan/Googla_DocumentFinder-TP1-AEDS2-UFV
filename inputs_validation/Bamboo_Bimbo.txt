Well he caught his first whiff in the jungles  
Ofnam  
That slanteyed catfish tasted better than mom  
Now every single night she drops her big bomb  
Cause hes a bamb00 bimbo  
Those hook marks really show  
Cause hes a bamboo bimb0  
He went for it now everyone knows  
Hes a bamboo bimb0  
He caught his first glance in field and stream  
That salt water taffy was a fishermans  
Wet dream  
Now every single night hes still gettin  
That big ream  
Cause hes a bamboo bimb0  
He fell it and everyone knows  
Hes a bamboo bimbo  
Just a monkey with a ring in his nose  
Hes a bambo0 bimbo  
Cant say i never told ya so  
Hes a bamboo bimb0  
It go on and on and on
