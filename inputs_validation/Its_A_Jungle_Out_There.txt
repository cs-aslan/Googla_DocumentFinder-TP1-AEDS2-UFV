I just gotta get away  
Cant stand it  
Children suffer every day  
  
Tell me baby  
Whats it for  
Fighting daily  
For the turf  
  
Were still killing each other  
In the name of the Lord  
Theres a brand new graffiti  
With blood on the walls  
  
Peace are you that far away  
Now you can feel it  
Other peoples pain  
Love can heal it  
Gentle as the rain  
  
Oh the United Nations drag their feet on the floor  
All they do is spend your money  
They dont tell you what for  
  
Peace what price we have to pay  
Peace theres gotta be a better way  
  
People tell me its useless to look for a way  
I believe that tomorrow starts right here today  
  
Peace are you that far away  
Peace theres gotta be a better way  
  
Peace are you that far away  
Peace theres gotta be a better way  
Peace peace  
Theres gotta be a better way  
Peace peace oh oh oh peace
