You always say you like my style  
You say Im tough and kind of wild  
Am I too much for you to tame  
I swear this time its not a game  
Ive known a lot of girls  
No this I wont deny  
Ill give our love  
Ill give it more than a try  
That was then that was then this is now  
Let me prove my love girl Ill make you proud  
I never made never made this kind of vow  
That was then this is now  
Ive led a thousand lives it seems  
And theres been a lot of broken dreams  
My minds just swept love aside  
But you broke me down and put me wise  
Ive doubted all compassion  
But you showed me the door  
I cant doubt it  
I dont doubt it no more  
That was then that was then this is now  
Let me prove my love girl Ill make you proud  
I never made never made this kind of vow  
That was then this is now  
Ive known a lot of girls  
No this I wont deny  
Ill give our love  
Ill give it more than a try  
That was then that was then this is now  
Let me prove my love girl Ill make you proud  
I never made never made this kind of vow  
That was then this is now  
That was then this is now  
That was then this is now
