Theres nobody here theres nobody near  
I try not to care dead eyes always stare  
Let these matters be dont trust what you see  
Take hold of your time step into the line  
  
Theres innocence torn from its maker  
Stillborn the trust in you  
This failure has made the creator  
So would you tell him what to do Would you  
  
Leave your mark upon the head of someone  
Wholl cry for his state we know its too late  
I turn round to see what was meant to be  
Faint movement release to rid the disease  
  
Theres innocence torn from its maker  
Stillborn the trust in you  
I have lost all trust I had in you  
This failure has made the creator  
So would you tell him what to do  
I have lost all trust I had in you
