When I heard that familiar voice  
My heart stopped dead in its tracks  
Across the room I could see him there  
A ghost from my past  
But hes too caught up to notice me  
She must be his new love  
I never dreamed that it would hurt this much  
Its just  
  
I know how he feels  
How warm his touch is  
Oh how he feels  
How soft his kiss is  
And it cuts right down to the bone  
Cause I let him go  
I know how he cares  
How strong his love can be  
When he believes its real  
Oh Ive been there  
I know how he feels  
  
As long as I kept him out of site  
I kept from going out of my mind  
Tried to believe that leaving him was some how justified  
But tonight theres no denying what a love like his is worth  
He once looked at me the way hes looking at her  
What a lucky girl
