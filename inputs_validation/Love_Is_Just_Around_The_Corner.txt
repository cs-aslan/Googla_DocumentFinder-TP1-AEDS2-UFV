Beautiful miracle pardon my lyrical rhapsody  
Cant you see Oh you have captured me  
Being so glamorous now cant you be amorous just with me  
Make it soon Cop a look at that moon  
  
Love is just around the corner  
Any cozy little corner  
Love is just around the corner  
When Im around you  
  
Im a sentimental mourner  
And I couldnt be forlorner  
When you keep me on that corner  
Just waiting for you  
  
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms  
But strictly between us  
You are cuter than Venus  
And whats more youve got arms  
  
Lets go cuddle in a corner  
Any cozy little corner  
Love is just around the corner  
And Im around you  
  
Love is just around the corner  
Any cozy corner  
Love is just around the corner  
When Im around you  
  
Im ten times as faithful  
As all your other men  
They all are true to no one but you  
But me Im true to ten  
  
Oh lets go cuddle in a cozy corner  
Any cozy little corner  
Love is just around the corner  
And Im around you
