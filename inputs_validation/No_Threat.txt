Got a windowwashers head  
For an unmakeable bed  
For loneliness  
The past is no place to  
Rest your weary arms cept at sevens at yer sides  
Your face a campaign debt reflected sky  
You die to your fans one window at at a time  thats right  
  
Gotta a windowwashers eye  
For an untuckable sky  
For lonely design  
The past is no place to  
Try but Ill get my minds armies moving at fullstride  
Singing in one voice preoccupied  
And with nothing to say Ill sing it bright  thats right  
  
I am here  
Its only me  
I aint freed nobody yet  
Its just me  
Ill just be a sec  
Im a cleaner Im no threat no threat no threat  
Im a reader Im no threat  
  
Who sings lonely  
Everyone sings lonely  
It doesnt sound so bad  
Who is free  
Everybodys freed from the tired of being sad  
So sad  
  
How will I know  
How will I know if Im helping  
Moreso how will she know if Im helping  
If Im not in the saddle Im nothing  thats right  
  
I am here  
Its only me  
I aint freed nobody yet  
Its just me  
Clearing spiderwebs  
Im a listener Im no threat  
I am here  
Failed and failing breath  
Im a listener Im no threat no threat no threat  
Im a watcher  
Im no threat  
No threat  
No threat
