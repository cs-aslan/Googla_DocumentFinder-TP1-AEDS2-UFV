I look at you and all I wanna do its just disappear  
I got a craving for you baby can we get out of here  
Youre a sexy machine youre a Hollywood dream  
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen  
Lets drop out of this crowd somewhere no ones allowed  
I want you  
  
All to myself I want you all to myself  
And nobody else yeah  
You dont need no other lover we can keep it undercover  
Find me in the shadows Im protegee  
Damn until tomorrow  
And make sure that nonobody follows  
You dont need no other lover we can keep it undercover  
  
You dont need no other lover we can keep it undercover  
  
I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark  
And you can navigate me like a map that you know by heart  
Youre a sexy machine youre a Hollywood dream  
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen  
Lets drop out of this crowd somewhere no ones allowed
