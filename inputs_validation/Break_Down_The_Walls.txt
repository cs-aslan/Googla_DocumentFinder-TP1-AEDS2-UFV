I used to think that label were just symbol of pride  
But over time Ive seen they only serve to divide  
Its so easy to judge people by the way they seem to be  
We must overcome this problem to live life peacfully  
Break down the walls  
Yes well break down the walls   
Look beyond the fashion or the crowd that they are in  
Look beyond their riches or the color of their skin  
Look beyond appearance and the truth you will find  
Look for whats inside before you make up your mind  
Break down the walls  
Well break down the walls
