Youve been set up one too many times  
The perfect victim for the perfect crime  
You left yourself wide open to the pain  
So close your eyes now  
Youre out walkin in the rain  
Youve got a burning desire to be The Victim  
Youre bleeding from the soul  
Youre hurting from the heart  
Things you cant be told are gonna tear you apart  
  
Your choice of lovers never very bright  
Your father worried but even he gave up the fight  
You always think their hearts are made of gold  
And youre the savior to coax the warmth out of the cold  
  
Youve got a burning desire to be The Victim  
Youre bleeding from the soul  
Youre hurting from the heart  
Things you cant be told are gonna tear you apart  
Cause youre The Victim  
  
Break the pattern youve gotta break away  
Break the pattern before it gets too late  
  
Youve got a burning desire to be The Victim  
Youre bleeding from the soul  
Youre hurting from the heart  
Things youre never told are gonna tear you apart  
Cause youre The Victim
