Trust is a weird thing  
Make you crazy  
Make you jealous  
Make you wish you hadnt said a thing  
  
And I guess I have been mean  
But Im only second guessing you  
Cause you wont even let me through  
  
And I want to be happy  
And I only want you  
If you think that Im crazy  
Im just crazy bout you  
Crazy bout you  
  
And love is a wonderful thing  
Make you wanna  
Make you need to  
Make you wish you hadnt said a thing  
  
Baby I I have been mean  
But Im only second guessing you  
Cause you wont even let me through  
  
And I want to be happy  
And I only want you  
If you think that Im crazy  
Im just crazy bout you  
Crazy bout you  
  
Baby I want you  
Honey I need you  
I know you want to  
I can feel you  
  
And I want to be happy  
And I only want you  
If you think that Im crazy  
Im just crazy bout you  
Crazy bout you
