Brother it dont matter  
Sister dont worry  
Say what you like  
Ill do what you want me to do  
Youre a vampire  
Im a vampire too  
  
Sun in the kitchen  
Boy youre still sleeping  
When you get hungry  
Ill do what you want me to do  
Youre a vampire  
Im a vampire too  
  
Night in the city  
New Orleans pretty  
Do what you want  
And then can I do it to you  
Youre a vampire  
Im a vampire too  
Youre a vampire  
Im a vampire too  
  
Its a reflex  
Just a reflex  
Like fear or sex  
  
Brother it dont matter  
Sister dont worry  
Say what you like  
Ill do what you want me to do  
Youre a vampire  
Im a vampire too  
Youre a vampire  
Im a vampire too  
  
Brother it dont matter  
Sister dont worry  
Brother it dont matter  
Sister dont worry
