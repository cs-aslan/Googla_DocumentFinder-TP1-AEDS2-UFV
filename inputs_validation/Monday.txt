Rainclouds came and stole my thunder  
Left me barren like a desert  
But a sunshine girl like you  
Its worth going through  
I will never be embarrassed about love again  
Tortured winds that blew me over  
When I start to think that Im something special  
  
They tell me that Im not  
And theyre right and Im glad and Im not  
I will never be embarrassed about that again  
  
Oh baby Im dreaming of monday  
Oh baby will I see you again  
Oh baby Im dreaming of monday
