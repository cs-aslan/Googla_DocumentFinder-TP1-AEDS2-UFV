Shaky Daveys got a twelve gauge in his hand  
Its sawed off to the limit  
Hes got a vague plan  
Theres this liquor store on Madison  
Theres another one down on Washington square  
Hes pretty sure no ones ever seen him  
Down around there  
  
The first ones bird shot the next four are double aught buck  
The last ones a slug just for good luck  
Hes got his works in his pocket  
He wants to score as soon as hes done  
He cant wait to get straight to get long gone  
  
He puts on his long coat scribbles off a short note  
Sits himself down and waits for the sun to go down  
  
Its right around midnight and theres still too damn many people on this
street  
Hes walked all the way from Battery Park hes got sweaty hands and burnin
feet  
Hes desperate for a fix  
His bodys screamin Get me high  
He bursts through the door and lets one fly  
  
Sunrise in the park and Daveys cold as stone  
He got some bad merchandise and he was all alone  
Two more unsolved mysteries a iot of paper pushed around  
Most folks are just wakin up in this great big town
