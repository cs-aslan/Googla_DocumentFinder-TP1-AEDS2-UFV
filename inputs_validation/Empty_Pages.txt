Empty pages before my eyes you not deny or criticize  
Empty bedrooms where I paid my dues  
Watching the ceiling instead of you  
Can you tell me where youre goin cant hold on to hear my song  
Ive got some songs Id love to sing  
Always bring down some other thing  
Where can I go my hands are broken  
It seems like your love is just a token why wont you stay with me  
Up in the morning and out the door  
She wont come in I gotta live alone  
Back in the evening with the darn poor fool out  
I got on mind just this gal just this gal
