This is what its like in the Dream Factory oh  
  
Hollyrock aint all it seems Lordy  
Dont get too serious its just a dream  
Dont forget your friends theyre all youve got Lordy  
Listen to the story of a man I am not  
  
Party all night hangin out  
In the streets more than I be at home  
I take a pill to wipe away my doubts  
But a pill cant cure my bein alone  
Vodka and seven straight to my brain  
Put me under false impressions hide all my pain  
Somebody help me Im losing control  
  
This is what its like in the Dream Factory oh  
  
Everybody got the big dreams Hey Lordy  
But nobody got the bucks  
Love and trust will help you make it in a world Everybody  
Where there aint no love aint no love  
  
Dig  
A man came up to me smile in his eyes  
He told me I was a saint  
So Im quittin my friends much to their surprise  
I cant live up to the picture that they paint  
Ah somebody help me Im losing control Ow  
  
I guess Im just a sucker in the dream factory oh  
  
Lordy  
La la la la la Sucker  
Got to drive  
Repeat 3X  
Its just a dream  
Look out  
  
Do you want to party  
Do want a pill  
How about a false impression  
Thrills spills chills  
  
This is what its like in the Dream Factory oh  
  
Ow Yeah  
Up a little bit  
Dream factory oh  
Party all night hang up on the side I said Uh  
Do you want to party  
I cant make up my mind  
How about a false impression  
I cant seem to live with no pictures Thrills spills chills  
Somebody got to help me Just a sucker  
Im losing control Just a sucker  
I guess Im just a sucker in the dream factory oh  
  
Guess Im just a sucker in the dream factory oh  
Just a sucker motherfucker
