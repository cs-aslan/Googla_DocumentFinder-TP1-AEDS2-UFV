I gave you all I had  
I gave you good and bad  
I gave but you just threw it back  
  
I wont get on my knees  
Dont make me do that please  
Ive been away but now Im back  
  
Dont be too sure of that  
What makes you sure of that  
You went away you cant come back  
  
I walked away from you  
I hurt you through and through  
Aw honey give me one more chance  
  
Aw youre a lucky son  
Lucky son of a gun  
You went away you went away  
You went away but now youre back  
  
I got down on my knees  
And then I begged you please  
I always knew youd take me back
