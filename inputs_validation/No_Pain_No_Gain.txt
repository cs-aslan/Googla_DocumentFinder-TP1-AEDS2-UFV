Face in the gutter eyes on the floor  
Knocked down twice cant take it no more  
You got no vision in your head  
You got no vision better dead  
Get on your feet open the door  
  
Walk on down you know the score  
Its a deadend street back to the wall  
You get it together you can get it all  
  
The weak will fall the strong remain  
  
No pain no gain yeah  
No pain no gain yeah  
  
No time for losers you make the call  
Believe in yourself stand tall  
Another day its in your hand  
You can be the winner in the end  
  
The weak will fall the strong remain  
  
No pain no gain yeah  
No pain no gain  
No pain no gain yeah  
No pain no gain yeah yeah  
  
Keep runnin dont look back  
Keep movin paint it black  
Keep goin dont ever stop  
Theres time to rest the day youll drop  
  
You roll the dice you play the game  
The weak will fall the strong remain  
  
No pain no gain  
No pain no gain
