Im preserving myself with makeup  
Lookin in the mirror  
Im preserving my life I can take it  
Shinin in the spotlight  
  
Preservation lookin in the mirror  
Preservation but they dont know that Im scrapin it all off  
Every night  
  
Im reserving my rights reputation  
Livin in a movie its keepin me lookin right  
When the secret is out to the public  
Seein is believin they still want to be me at night  
When the parts get shorter the parties get harder  
But thats alright  
  
Preservation lookin in the mirror  
Preservation but they dont know that Im scrapin it off  
Every night  
  
Theyre linin up to make their entrance  
When the words out Im in town theyre not nice girls  
But thats alright  
Theyre lookin so much better when the lights go down  
But nice girls is just a frame of mind  
  
Preservation lookin in the mirror  
Preservation but they dont know that Im scrapin it off  
Every night
