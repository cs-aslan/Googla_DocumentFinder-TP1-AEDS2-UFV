Some folks were meant to live in clover  
But they are such a chosen few chosen few  
And clover being green  
Is something Ive never seen  
Cause I was born to be blue  
  
When theres a yellow moon above me  
They say theres moonbeams I should view I should view  
But moonbeams being gold  
Are something I cant behold  
Cause I was born to be blue  
  
When I met you  
The world was bright and sunny  
When you left the curtain fell  
Id like to laugh  
But nothing strikes me funny  
Now my worlds a faded pastel oh well  
  
I guess Im luckier than some folks  
Woo woo woo  
Ive known the thrill of lovin you lovin you  
And that alone is more than I was created for  
Cause I was born to be blue  
  
When I met you  
The world was bright and sunny  
When you left the curtain fell  
Id like to laugh  
But nothing strikes me funny  
Now my worlds a faded pastel oh well  
  
I guess Im luckier than some folks  
Ive known the thrill of lovin you lovin you  
And that alone is more than I was created for  
Cause I was born to be blue  
Woo woo
