Here comes the one that youve been dreaming of  
I am the most exalted potentate of love  
I got a mojo hand that fits like a glove  
Ill be coming round the mountain to get your love  
Im the most exalted potentate of love  
Yes I am  
Yes Im the celebrated hottentot of twat  
Make a hole look out make way for a demon child  
Ill make you hear my turtle dove  
Ride around the range to get your love  
Are we having fun on a fire son of a gun  
Mad you called me mad  
I have the secret to eternal love  
Mad you call me mad  
I am the most exalted potentate of love  
Yes Ill teach you how to read the book of life  
You can just look at the pictures if you like  
Ill make you hear my turtle dove  
Ride around the range to get your love  
Are we having fun on a fire son of a gun  
I am the most exalted potentate of love
