Intro  
Im very excited to be here  
Yet again its an honor to be nominated  
Bla bla bla bla  
  
Well that Brits night was so fucking boring  
Past the days of yes yes Charlene  
Coke in the box til 7 in the morning  
Look the wrong way and we end up brawling  
When I had a bit of beef with you know who  
And I fucked a few female stars or two  
Nearly everything I said Id end getting screwed  
Spitting at the looking rude in the news  
Oh yes youre still rocking with the best  
Second person on my year to have touched a breast  
Im nearly 40 now and Im still impressed  
Heres the midlife crisis I guess  
Oh I recall taking in the wonder of it all  
  
Chorus  
Im still looking for an answer through the looking glass  
Still not concentrating at the back of the class  
No thanks sir this ones for you  
Its like a VD clinic only pricks are in it  
So fucking corporate and professional and timid  
To be frank sir I prefer this showbiz chancer  
I still want to get laid by you right  
  
Now I know Ive got fat but make no mistake  
Every million that I make they bake me a cake  
So Ive got plenty 120  
Wearing rows of tweed like the  
I still want to get you naked  
Ill see you in the summer so glad you could make it  
Ill be that mega white thing fast as lightening  
In shape but twice as frightening  
If they cant be bothered then I promise you this  
If they wont entertain you then Ill do my fucking best  
  
Chorus  
Im still looking for an answer through the looking glass  
Still not concentrating at the back of the class  
No thanks sir this ones for you  
Its like a VD clinic only pricks are in it  
So fucking corporate and professional and timid  
To be frank sir I prefer this showbiz chancer  
I still want to get laid by you  
  
Would you let me lay you down right here  
Would you let me live  
  
Chorus  
Im still looking for an answer through the looking glass  
Still not concentrating at the back of the class  
No thanks sir this ones for you  
Its like a VD clinic only pricks are in it  
So fucking corporate and professional and timid  
To be frank sir I prefer this showbiz chancer  
Im still looking for an answer through the looking glass  
Still not concentrating at the back of the class  
No thanks sir this ones for you  
Its like a VD clinic only pricks are in it  
So fucking corporate and professional and timid  
To be frank sir I prefer this showbiz chancer
