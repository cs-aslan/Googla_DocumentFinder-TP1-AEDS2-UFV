Well little darling she aint mean me no harm  
You know she loved me all night long  
Now shes gone gone  
  
Well little darling in a dress so red  
Now shes gone man  
  
Im stuck in Chicago Illinois  
Let me tell you boys  
Shes gone gone  
  
I do believe she gone a Mobil deal  
I do believe she made a fool of me  
Shes gone now  
  
Little darling wont you stay friend  
I want to do them things again  
Ah gone gone  
  
You know she loved me all night long  
You know she didnt mean me no wrong  
Now shes gone gone
