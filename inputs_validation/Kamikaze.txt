The princess in her flowerbed  
Pulled the jungle underground  
Where cherry bombs stain the blackbirds red  
And explosions never make a sound  
Oh comet come down  
Kamikaze over me  
And come alive  
My midnight melody  
Oh comet come down  
  
My captain on the snowy horse  
Hes coming back to take me home  
Hes coming back to take me home  
Hell find me fighting back the terrible force  
Cause Im not afraid to die alone  
Oh comet come down  
Kamikaze over me  
  
And come alive  
My midnight melody  
Oh comet come down  
Kamikaze over me  
And come alive  
My midnight melody  
Oh comet come down  
Oh comet come down  
  
Break down the open doors  
Maybe Ill write  
And fight back the undertones  
To save my life  
Break in the ember glows  
Maybe Ill fly  
And go where you want to go  
With the eagle eye  
  
Break down the open doors  
Maybe Ill write  
And fight back the undertones  
To save my life  
Break in the ember glows  
Maybe Ill fly  
And go where you want to go  
With the eagle eye  
Eagle eye
