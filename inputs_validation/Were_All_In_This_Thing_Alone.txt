Hey there you know she left me hey there Ive been crying  
In a boat on a plane in a train in a house by the phone  
Hey there were all in this thing alone  
You cant smile for me I cant cry for you we cant be alone together that
makes two  
Like trees that fall in forest no one hears crying done alone dont call for
tears  
Hey there you know she left me  
  
Aint it strange how we think money knows when Friday comes  
Calls dont know bout Sunday and our heartaches twice as done  
It hurts although its killed you thorugh and through  
My eyes all red from tears arent really blue  
Hey there you know she left me
