I took my baby on a Saturday bang  
Boy is that girl with you  
Yes were one and the same  
  
Now I believe in miracles  
And a miracle has happened tonight  
  
But if youre thinkin about my baby  
It dont matter if youre black or white  
  
They print my message in the Saturday Sun  
I had to tell them I aint second to none  
  
And I told about equality and its true  
Either youre wrong or youre right  
  
But if youre thinkin about my baby  
It dont matter if youre black or white  
  
I am tired of this devil  
I am tired of this stuff  
I am tired of this business  
Sew when the going gets rough  
I aint scared of your brother  
I aints scared of no sheets  
I aint scared of nobody  
Girl when the goin gets mean  
  
Protection  
For gangs clubs and nations  
Causing grief in human relations  
Its a turf war on a global scale  
Id rather hear both sides of the tale  
See its not about races  
Just places  
Faces  
Where your blood comes from  
Is were your space is  
Ive seen the bright get duller  
Im not going to spend my life being a color  
  
Dont tell me you agree with me  
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye  
  
But if youre thinkin about my baby  
It dont matter if youre black or white  
  
I said if youre thinkin of being my baby  
It dont matter if youre black or white  
  
I said if youre thinkin of being my brother  
It dont matter if youre black or white  
  
Ooh ooh  
Yea yea yea now  
Ooh ooh  
Yea yea yea now  
  
Its black its white  
Its tough for them to get by  
Its black its white x3 whoo
