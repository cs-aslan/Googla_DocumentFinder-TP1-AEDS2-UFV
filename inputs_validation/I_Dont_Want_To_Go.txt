He dont like no small things  
Even riding around on tall dreams  
I dont wanna go  
Hes a sweet baby but he looks mean  
In his soft leather in his blue jeans  
  
He got away baby he got away oh baby  
He got away with his words  
Theyd be like diamonds and pearls  
Theyd be like diamonds and pearls  
He gives to his little favorite girls  
  
I dont wanna go go home  
I dont wanna go go home  
Baby tonight  
Baby tonight  
  
He dont like no spotlight  
Stands real quiet in the moonlight  
  
He got away oh baby he got away oh baby  
He got away with those words  
Theyd be like diamonds and pearls  
Theyd be like diamonds and pearls  
He gives to his little favorite girl  
  
I dont wanna go go home  
I dont wanna go go home  
Baby tonight  
Baby tonight  
  
Loving you isnt right  
Black leather wont like the giving  
Loving you isnt right  
Its original sin  
  
I dont wanna go go home  
I dont wanna go go home  
Baby tonight  
Baby tonight  
  
I feel like I can do anything  
Like I can do anything  
Like I can do anything that I like  
I feel like I can do anything  
Like I can do anything  
Like I can do anything tonight  
Baby tonight  
Tonight
