Its been so long since you been gone  
And now were here  
The musics on  
Were feeling freaky oh  
I want you in my bedroom  
You want me closer to you  
What are we doing  
Lets get to it  
  
I lay you down  
Take off your clothes  
Then kiss your lips  
It feels so good ooh youre saying more  
I wanna be inside you  
Ooh girl you got that fire  
I cant wait no longer  
I just gotta take control  
  
The lights in the club are turning you on  
Now girl lets pretend we both are alone  
Well finish this up when we get home  
The only thing I need from you girl  
  
Is to press your body  
On my body  
Do it fast do it slow  
You control the tempo  
  
Look over your shoulder  
Bring it back now  
Let me feel your body  
Just press it press it  
  
My favorite place is that space between your legs and your hips  
Ooh got me licking my lips  
Wanna get up on it

Feelin bit bad boy

Come on girl serve me the dish  
  
The lights in the club are turning you on  
Now girl lets pretend we both are alone  
Well finish this up when we get home  
The only thing I need from you girl  
  
Is to press your body  
On my body
