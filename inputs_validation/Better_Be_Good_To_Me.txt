A prisoner of your love  
Entangled in your web  
Hot whispers in the night  
Im captured by your spell  
Oh yes Im touched by this show of emotion  
Should I be fractured by your lack of devotion  
Should I should I  
  
You better be good to me  
Thats how its gotta be now  
Cause I dont have no use  
For what you loosely call the truth  
You better be good to me  
  
I think its also right  
That we dont need to fight  
We stand face to face  
And you present your case  
And I know you keep telling me that you love me  
And I really do want to believe  
But did you think Id just accept you in blind faith  
Oh sure babe anything to please you  
  
You better be good to me  
Thats how its gotta be now  
Cause I dont have the time  
For your over loaded lines  
You better be good to me  
  
And I really dont see why its so hard to be good to me  
And I dont understand whats your plan that you cant be good to me  
What I cant feel I surely cannot see why cant you be good to me  
And if its not real I do not wish to see why cant you be good to me
