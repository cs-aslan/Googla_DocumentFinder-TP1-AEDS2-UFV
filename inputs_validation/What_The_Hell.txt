Oh my room will always have some people  
You see Johnny Carson is a friend of mine  
And my music box will always play me something  
If somethings what I need to ease my mind  
Take what you want  
Ill feel much better  
Dont hang around  
Till I get myself together  
You can leave those pieces right there where they fell  
Someone else will come along and pick em up  
Say what the hell  
  
If I dont see you in the morning  
Guess the sun might come up anyway  
And without you here to love and stand beside me  
Guess I just might make it through the day  
If you should call from time to time  
Dont be surprised  
If the voice that answers aint mine  
Cause you left the pieces right there where they fell  
Someone else just came along and picked em up  
Say what the hell  
  
If you should call from time to time  
Dont be surprised  
If the voice that answers aint mine  
Cause you left those pieces right there where they fell  
Someone else just came along and picked em up  
Say what the hell  
  
If she dont love me come tomorrow  
If you cant get what you want want what you got  
And I wont be drugged with words like joy and sorrow  
I wont feel one way or the other  
Like as not  
Ill soon forget you  
Leave my life  
Guess you thought Id never let you  
Cause you left those pieces right there where they fell  
Someone else just came along and picked em up  
Say what the hell
