Ive been doing a lot of thinking  
About growing older and moving on  
Nobody wants to be told that theyre getting on  
For a long long stay  
But just how long and who knows  
And how and where my spirit will go  
Will it soar like Jazz on a saxophone  
Or evaporate on a breeze  
Wont you tell me please  
That life is eternal  
And love is immortal  
And death is only a horizon  
Life is eternal  
As we move into the light  
And a horizon is nothing  
Save the limit of our sight  
Save the limit of our sight  
  
Here on earth Im a lost soul  
Ever trying to find my way back home  
Maybe thats why each new star is born  
Expanding heavens room  
Eternity in bloom  
And will I see you up in that heaven  
In all its light will I know youre there  
Will we say the things that we never dared  
If wishing makes it so  
Wont you let me know  
That life is eternal  
And love is immortal  
And death is only a horizon  
Life is eternal  
As we move into the light  
And a horizon is nothing  
Save the limit of our sight  
Save the limit of our sight
