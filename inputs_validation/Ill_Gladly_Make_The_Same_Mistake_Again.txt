Therell be lots of tears plus some happy years  
And youll add my heart to your souvenirs  
But loving you was my mistake  
But Ill gladly make the same mistake again  
Ill be on the town acting like a clown  
So they wont suspect that you turned me down  
Loving you was my mistake  
But Ill gladly make the same mistake again  
Ive love for you  
Thats the kind of love that never ever ceases  
Break my heart in two  
Or break it into a million little pieces  
Every piece you find has you on its mind  
If you doubt Im the forgiving kind all you have to say is when  
And Ill gladly make the same mistake again  
Yes Ill gladly make the same mistake again  
Ive love for you  
Thats the kind of love that never ever ceases  
Break my heart right in two  
Or break it into a million little pieces  
Every piece that you find has you on its mind  
If you doubt Im the forgiving kind all you have to say is when  
And Ill gladly make the same mistake again  
Yes yes yes gladly make the same mistake again
