Its hot up in the west end theres panic right downtown  
As the gangs assemble coming up from underground  
Well Jesus I dont know which side I should be on  
Im a class contender if anything goes wrong  
  
When its time to rock  
Were the only ones  
No one takes this block  
Cause were number one  
  
We sneaked through the no go very late last night  
Out up from the back streets cruising for a fight  
  
Well Jackies got his six string he can play behind his back  
Mickeys out from Bellevue hes just makin tracks  
  
When its time to rock  
Were the only ones  
No one takes this block  
Cause were number one  
  
As we rocked through the midnight took em all by storm  
The police boys didnt have a chance didnt even get warm  
Oh daddy why am I sittin here Im not a member of the bar  
Im not the only wild one in a hot wired car  
  
When its time to rock  
Were the only ones  
No one takes this block  
Cause were number one
