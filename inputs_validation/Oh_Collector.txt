Oh collector Im so sorry  
You had the notion I was rolling in the money  
No Im sorry but Ill pay you  
No worries  
lets sing softly  
Lets sing softly  
Oh so softly  
Not so heavy  
Ive been heavy with my fortune  
Like a crystal and a hammer  
Im so sorry oh collector  
Im away now in a hurry  
lets sing softly  
Lets sing softly  
Oh so softly  
Not so heavy  
Get up all you fighters  
Dont you lie here now  
Get up all you fighters  
Dont you lie here now  
Oh collector you had it coming  
It was that funny we were rolling  
Oh collector were so sorry  
And well pay you no worries  
lets sing softly  
Lets sing softly  
Oh so softly  
Not so heavy  
lets sing softly  
Lets sing softly  
Oh so softly  
Not so heavy  
Lets sing softly oh
