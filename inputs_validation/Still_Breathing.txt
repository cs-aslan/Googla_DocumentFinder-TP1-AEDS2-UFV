Verse 1  
Im like a child looking off in the horizon  
Im like an ambulance thats turning on the sirens  
Oh Im still alive  
Im like a soldier coming home for the first time  
I dodged a bullet and I walked across a landmine  
Oh Im still alive  
  
PreChorus  
Am I bleeding Am I bleeding from the storm  
Just shine a light into the wreckage so far away away  
Chorus  
Cause Im still breathing  
Cause Im still breathing on my own  
My heads above the rain and roses  
Making my way my way  
Cause Im still breathing  
Cause Im still breathing on my own  
My heads above the rain and roses  
Making my way my way  
My way to you  
  
Verse 2  
Im like a junkie tying off for the last time  
Im like a loser thats betting on his last dime  
Oh Im still alive  
Im like a son that was raised without a father  
Im like a mother barely keeping it together  
Oh Im still alive  
  
PreChorus  
Am I bleeding Am I bleeding from the storm  
Just shine a line into the wreckage so far away away  
  
Chorus  
Cause Im still breathing  
Cause Im still breathing on my own  
My heads above the rain and roses  
Making my way my way  
Cause Im still breathing  
Cause Im still breathing on my own  
My heads above the rain and roses  
Making my way my way my way  
  
Bridge  
As I walked out on the ledge  
Are you scared to death to live  
I been running all my life  
Just to find a home thats for the restless  
And the truth thats in the message  
Making my way away away  
  
Chorus  
Cause Im still breathing  
Cause Im still breathing on my own  
My heads above the rain and roses  
Making my way my way  
Cause Im still breathing  
Cause Im still breathing on my own  
My heads above the rain and roses  
Making my way my way my way  
Cause Im still breathing  
Cause Im still breathing on my own  
My heads above the rain and roses  
Making my way my way  
My way to you
