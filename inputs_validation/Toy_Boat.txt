Im waiting for a boat to help me out of here  
Waiting for a boat to help me out  
The boat that reached my shore was a toy boat  
Waiting for a boat to help me out  
  
Im dreaming of a lake Ive never seen before  
Dreaming of a lake Ive never seen  
The lake Ive seen last was a picture lake

Im thinking of a castle on atop a hill  
Thinking of a castle on atop a hill  
The castle Ive been to was full of flies
