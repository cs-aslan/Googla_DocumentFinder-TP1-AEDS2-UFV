I missed you so much that I begged here to fly here and see me  
You mustve broke down cause you finally said that you would  
But now that youre here  
I just feel like Im constantly dreaming  
Cause somethings gotta go wrong  
Cause Im feelin way too damn good  
  
For forty eight hours I dont think that we left my hotel room  
Should show you the sites cause Im sure that I said that I would  
We gotta make love just one last time in the shower  
Well somethings gotta go wrong  
Cause Im feelin way too damn good  
  
And its like  
  
Every time I turn around  
I fall in love and find my heart face down  
And where it lands is when it should  
This time its like  
The two of us should probably start to fight  
Cause somethings gotta go wrong  
Cause Im feelin way too damn good  
  
Feelin way too damn good  
  
Sometimes life aint best if left in the memory  
Its better kept inside than left for good  
Lookin back each time they tried to tell me  
Well somethings gotta go wrong  
Cause Im feelin way too damn good  
  
And its like  
  
Every time I turn around  
I fall in love and find my heart face down  
And where it lands is when it should  
This time its like  
The two of us should probably start to fight  
Cause somethings gotta go wrong  
Cause Im feelin way too damn good  
  
Feelin way too damn good
