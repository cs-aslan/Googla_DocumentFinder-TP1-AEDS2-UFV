Its like spending time with you  
Just doing absolutely nothing  
That makes me happy  
When youre at work putting on your  
Tshirt and I love it absolutely love it

Its the smile of a child  
Its your eyes its your hair  
Its the touch of your skin  
Thats what gets me there  
Its also enticing  
Waking up from a nice dream  
To a beautiful morning with you by my side  
Thats nice

If it makes you happy just be happy  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy just be happy
