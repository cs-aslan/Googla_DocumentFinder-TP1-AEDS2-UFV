The stars must be aligned tonight  
I believe this has to happen baby  
Lightening had to strike to tonight  
Cause the two of us are finally meeting  
  
In this place at this time  
I feel sane when I look in your eyes  
Feel like I know you from another life  
It makes me wish I wasnt so pressed for time  
  
Chorus  
I cant catch my breath cause you take it away  
The best writer in town could not find words to stay  
Now theres so many things I want to get to know  
I wish that I could stay but I got to go  
So Im gonna call you tonight  
I will baby just as soon as I get time alone  
Im gonna call you tonight I will baby  
Just as soon as I get home  
  
Thats the way it goes in life  
You get busy when you just dont want to  
Theres never enough time in your life  
You have to make it baby so Im goin  
  
Make a way to connect  
Cause your face is what I cant forget  
I feel like I know you from another life  
And it makes me wish I wasnt so pressed for time  
  
Chorus  
  
Destiny I believe in it  
Meant to be dont you see its possible  
That for this kind of magic you think Im having  
And if you want to know then stay by the phone  
  
You stay by the phone  
  
Chorus
