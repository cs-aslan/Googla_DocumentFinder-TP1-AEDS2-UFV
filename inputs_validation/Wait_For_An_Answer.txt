Someone told me to call  
So I did and no one answered  
And I dont hear a sound  
But I know someones laughing  
Im trying hard to keep my confidence  
You take advantage of my innocence  
Where are you how are you  
I wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
Its been so long Ill hold on  
And wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
No one know you  
What you go though but I do  
The phone keeps ringing  
No one know what youre thinking  
But I do I do I do  
They were laughing at you  
And I held out my hand  
I was trying to get through  
Without losing again  
Where are you how are you  
I wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
Its been so long Ill hold on  
And wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
Whats that you say I cant hear you  
Are those words meant for me  
As they appear to be  
The tension in my voice awakes you  
You know who I am but my name escapes you  
They were looking for you  
And you started to run  
If they asked about you  
I wouldnt tell anyone  
Where are you how are you  
I wait for an answer   
Wait for an answer  
Its been so long Ill hold on  
And wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
The kind of woman I am  
I do things that you cant understand  
But there are times when you should  
Check the line on my face  
Dont look at me now  
Look at me now  
Look at me now  
Where are you how are you  
I wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
Its been so long Ill hold on  
And wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
Ill wait you make me wait  
Someone told me to call
