Verse  
Youve been taking it all this time  
You left my trust on the firing line  
As the promises break the only mistake   
Giving you what was mine  
Your words are clear but their meanings gone  
The notes are right but the tunings wrong  
And when you tell me again that I should give in  
I can only take it so long long long long  
  
Chorus  
What  
Youre terrified terrified  
Youd rather throw it all away all away all away  
Youre terrified terrified  
Youd rather throw it all away  
  
Verse 2  
Fear is dancing inside your lies  
Exposing secrets that youve disguised  
And Im biting my tongue as you become  
Victim of a compromise  
Cause I know who you really are  
Not a scratch where you can take a scar  
And its time that you seek the truth without me  
I can only get you so far far far far  
  
Chorus  
What  
Youre terrified terrified  
Youd rather throw it all away all away all away  
Youre terrified terrified  
Youd rather throw it all away  
  
Throw it all away all away x5  
  
What  
Youre terrified terrified  
Youd rather throw it all away all away all away  
Youre terrified terrified  
Youd rather throw it all away all away  
  
Chorus  
What  
Youre terrified terrified  
Youd rather throw it all away all away all away  
Youre terrified terrified  
Youd rather throw it all away
