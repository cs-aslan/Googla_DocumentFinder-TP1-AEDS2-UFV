Theres a touch upon my lips  
Left by memorys fingertips  
I still hear her voice  
When theres no sound  
  
Theres a touch upon my skin  
Left when she went back to him  
All the rest has gone  
Shes not around  
  
When I saw her first  
It was lust my friend  
Thought it would burn  
Then it would end  
But I lost my old philosophy  
Now I believed in love  
Well the months went by and my love grew strong  
Thought she felt the same but I was wrong  
She held my old philosophy  
Now Im destroyed by love  
  
Theres a touch  
  
Well I still believed that I would win  
cause I was a better man than him  
She held the new philosophy  
Now she believed in love  
But the love she felt was not for me  
Said she would have to set me free  
Now I know theres no philosophy  
That cant be destroyed by love  
  
Theres a touch
