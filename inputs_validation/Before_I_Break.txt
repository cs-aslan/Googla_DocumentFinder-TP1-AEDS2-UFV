On liquor I spend my last dime  
  
Sunday morning 8am  
Cursing myself again  
Drinking like this one might be my last  
  
Memories of making jokes  
Too much beer and talkshow hosts  
One of them thats fading fast  
  
Heres to waking up at night  
Drunk and undressed by the side of the road  
Youre still thinking  
  
That you cant go on like this  
Before I break down  
You keep saying thanks so much I cant live  
Thanks so much Ive had enough  
  
Well itd do me just fine to make it through the night  
On liquor I spend my last dime  
  
A worried man drinks a healthy drink  
But he drinks nine or ten until hes done  
Then hell tell you his life story  
But he wont stop until hes told you and everyone  
  
Heres to waking up at night  
Drunk and undressed by the side of the road  
Youre still thinking  
  
That you cant go on like this  
Before I break down  
You keep saying thanks so much I cant live  
Thanks so much Ive had enough  
  
Well itd do me just fine to make it through the night  
On liquor I spend my last dime  
  
Memories of making jokes  
Too much beer and talkshow hosts  
One of them thats fading fast  
  
Heres to waking up at night  
Drunk and undressed by the side of the road  
Youre still thinking  
  
That you cant go on like this  
Before I break down  
You keep saying thanks so much I cant live
