We dont play any games my girl and I  
We get by on the high of love  
And theres no time to spend on doubt or wondering  
Cause no one else could I ever love  
You see the world outside can be cold and very lonely  
And it gets real bad  
And it makes me sad but  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I and love will be together together  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I will truly survive  
And its all because our love will never die  
Never ever die  
We all live in a crazy world today  
Theres so much beauty and yet theres so much pain  
And wed be wiser to make a change with love we could  
Its our world we should make it good  
And if the world outside gets too cold and feels too lonely  
And it gets real bad  
Itll still make us sad  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I and love will be together together  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I will truly survive  
And its all because our love will never die  
Never ever die  
Our love is out world  
And it keeps us safely from anything outside that could hurt us  
We look out from inside  
And depending on what we see  
We just hold each other tightly hold me tightly  
Cause sometimes its just better to let it be  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I and love will be together together  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I will truly survive  
And its all because our love will never die  
Never ever die
