Come wit it now  
Come wit it now  
  
The microphone explodes shattering the molds  
Either drop tha hits like de la O or get tha fuck off tha commode  
Wit tha sure shot sure ta make tha bodies drop  
Drop an dont copy yo dont call this a coop  
Terror rains drenchin quenchin tha thirst of tha power dons  
That five sided fistagon  
Tha rotten sore on tha face of mother earth gets bigger  
Tha triggers cold empty ya purse  
  
Rally round tha family With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family With a pocket full of shells  
  
Weapons not food not homes not shoes  
Not need just feed the war cannibal animal  
I walk tha corner to tha rubble that used to be a library  
Line up to tha mind cemetery now  
What we dont know keeps tha contracts alive an movin  
They dont gotta burn tha books they just remove em  
While arms warehouses fill as quick as tha cells  
Rally round tha family pockets full of shells  
  
Rally round tha family With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family With a pocket full of shells

Bulls on parade
