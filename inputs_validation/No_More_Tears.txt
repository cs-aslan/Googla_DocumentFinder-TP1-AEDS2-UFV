The light in the window is a crack in the sky  
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye  
A levee of tears to learn shell never be coming back  
The man in the dark will bring another attack  
  
Your momma told you that youre not supposed to talk to strangers  
Look in the mirror tell me do you uthink your lifes in danger here yeah  
  
No more tears  
No more tears  
No more tears  
No more tears  
  
Another day passes as the night closes in  
The red light goes on to say its time to begin  
  
I see the man around the corner waiting does he see me  
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here  
  
No more tears  
No more tears  
No more tears  
No more tears  
  
So now that its over cant we just say goodbye  
Id like to move on and make the most of the night  
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way  
Your lips are so cold I dont know what else to say  
  
I never wanted it to end this way my love my darling  
Believe me when I say to you in love I think Im falling here  
  
No more tears  
No more tears  
No more tears  
No more tears
