Young Cosette is working as a drudge in the Thenardiers inn at Montfermeil  
  
Young Cosette  
There is a castle on a cloud  
I like to go there in my sleep  
Arent any floors for me to sweep  
Not in my castle on a cloud  
There is a room thats full of toys  
There are a hundred boys and girls  
Nobody shouts or talks too loud  
Not in my castle on a cloud  
There is a lady all in white  
Holds me and sings a lullaby  
Shes nice to see and shes soft to touch  
She says Cosette I love you very much  
I know a place where no ones lost  
I know a place where no one cries  
Crying at all is not allowed  
Not in my castle on a cloud  
  
Oh help I think I hear them now  
And Im nowhere near finished sweeping and  
Scrubbing and polishing the floor  
Oh its her Its Madame  
  
Mme Thenardier  
Now look whos here  
The little madam herself  
Pretending once again shes been so awfully good  
Better not let me catch you slacking  
Better not catch my eye  
Ten rotten francs your mother sends me  
What is that going to buy  
Now take that pail  
My little Mademoiselle  
And go and draw some water from the well  
We should never have taken you in in the first place  
How stupid the things that we do  
Like mother like daughter the scum of the street  
Eponine come my dear Eponine let me see you  
You look very well in that new little blue hat  
Theres some little girls who know how to behave  
And they know what to wear  
And Im saying thank heaven for that  
Still there Cosette  
Your tears will do you no good  
I told you fetch some water from the well in the wood  
  
Young Cosette  
Please do not send me out alone  
Not in the darkness on my own  
  
Mme Thenardier  
Enough of that or Ill forget to be nice  
You heard me ask for something  
And I never ask twice  
  
Young Eponine pushes Cosette out Thenardier says good night to his daughter
as the inn fills up for the evening
