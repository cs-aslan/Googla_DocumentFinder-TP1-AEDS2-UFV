I cant believe whats happening  
Where is your self control  
Why cant you just be honest  
The corruption takes its toll  
  
You rape our hope  
Too proud to cope  
You built this house of shame  
You smile you gloat  
This disease you promote  
An infection is what we are now  
  
I cant believe this happened  
The fear starts to grab hold  
Then anger starts to take over  
I will not be controlled  
  
You rape our hope  
Too proud to cope  
You built this house of shame  
You smile you gloat  
This disease you promote  
An infection is what we are now  
  
Theyre taking over now  
Eating up our souls somehow  
Taking over now  
Parasites they run around  
The culprits wont be found  
They lie behind this mask of wealth  
Theyre taking over now  
Illuminati they hide  
  
You rape our hope  
Too proud to cope  
You built this house of shame  
You smile you gloat  
This disease you promote  
An infection is what we are now  
  
You rape our hope  
Too proud to cope  
You built this house of shame  
You smile you gloat  
This disease you promote  
An infection is what we are now
