Yesterday feels like running away  
Feels like givin the child gettin lost losin my mind  
Im feelin low and I got no place to go  
Gettin all tied up feelin all tied up yeah yeah  
Oh yesterday feels like running away  
And I know Im givin up my time to still love  
Still love loves got me blind  
My mind sees the things I dont know and I got no place to go  
Gettin all tied up feelin all tied up  
Things I need to tell you love  
Youll be true I know  
Theres still a chance for a better life  
Yes I know
