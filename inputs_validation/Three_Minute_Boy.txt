Here today  
Gone this afternoon  
Another tune we almost remember  
Whats the story  
Sex and drugs again  
Business as usual  
The clocks already ticking  
La la la la  
  
When he was young  
Staring at the TV  
He watched the fun happenin to other people  
Now they scream  
As they run after him  
Like a dream  
Like Elvis and the Beatles  
  
A three minute song is all he wrote  
He only did it for a joke  
They played him on the radio  
From Tokyo to Timbuktu  
A three minute boy aint that somethin  
They named their children after him  
The good times rolled beneath his feet  
He skipped along the oneway street  
  
Shes a pretty girl  
She dont know how it started  
She made a movie  
He almost remembered  
She measured up  
They moved into a basement  
Were so in love  
They giggled to the nation  
La la la la  
  
Three minute millionaire they said  
The numbers rattled round his head  
They spun him three times round the globe  
She waited patiently at home  
And all the pretty girls wanted him  
In places that hed never been  
Too much love will do you in  
Forgive Forgive Forgive Forgive  
Yeah Yeah Ooo  
  
Three minute kid is here again  
Surrounded by three minute friends  
He found someone to understand  
To shock the world and hold his hand  
No religion no restraint  
No direction no complaints  
No future and no way out  
No time now to think about it  
All the moneys gone  
He dont know what he spent it on  
  
Girlfriends gone off with the Jag  
Gone back to her mum and dad  
Hes curled up on the studio floor  
He just cant do it anymore  
The flashgun went off without warning  
Hell read about it tomorrow morning  
  
Shes goin out with someone new  
In this week at number two  
Three minute boy aint that somethin
