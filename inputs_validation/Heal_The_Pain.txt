Let me tell you a secret  
Put it in your heart and keep it  
Something that I want you to know  
Do something for me  
Listen to my simple story  
And maybe well have something to show  
  
You tell me youre cold on the inside  
How can the outside world  
Be a place that your heart can embrace  
Be good to yourself  
Because nobody else  
Has the power to make you happy  
  
How can I help you  
Please let me try to  
I can heal the pain  
That youre feeling inside  
Whenever you want me  
You know that I will be  
Waiting for the day  
That you say youll be mine  
  
He must have really hurt you  
To make you say the things that you do  
He must have really hurt you  
To make those pretty eyes look so blue  
  
He must have known  
That he could  
That youd never leave him  
Now you cant see my love is good  
And that Im not him  
  
How can I help you  
Please let me try to  
I can heal the pain  
That youre feeling inside  
Whenever you want me  
You know that I will be  
Waiting for the day  
That you say youll be mine  
  
Who needs a lover  
That cant be a friend  
Something tells me Im the one youve been looking for  
If you ever should see him again  
Wont you tell him youve found someone who gives you more  
  
Someone who will protect you  
Love and respect you  
All those things  
That he never could bring to you  
Like I do  
Or rather I would  
Wont you show me your heart  
Like you should  
  
Wont you let me in  
Let this love begin  
Wont you show me your heart now  
Ill be good to you  
I can make this thing true  
And get to your heart somehow
