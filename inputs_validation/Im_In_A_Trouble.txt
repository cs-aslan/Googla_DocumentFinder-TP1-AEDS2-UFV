Ive got something to tell you  
About my heart  
That you hold  
If youre down well theres someone there  
Dont you know  
  
Well you know theres a place  
Way down deep  
Where I hide  
Im in trouble  
  
Its a garden I keep  
You dont know  
You cant find  
Im in trouble  
  
I hold you close  
You turn away  
  
You know what I want to say  
  
After this love  
After the rain  
After our rivers run  
  
Youll fill my eyes  
With silver rays  
And with a golden sun  
  
Im still here  
Unafraid  
If you dont come  
Oh Im in trouble  
  
What do you think about me  
What do you think about me  
  
Well you know part of me is  
Deep in you  
You dont want  
All my trouble  
  
Wont walk out  
I want to stay  
  
Id light up your heart  
If I found the way  
  
After this love  
After the rain  
After our rivers meet  
  
Youll fill my eyes  
With silver curves  
And golden memories  
  
Im still here  
Unafraid  
Wont you please come  
  
After this love  
After this crying  
After the stars all fall  
  
Youll fill my eyes  
With tears of joy  
Well laugh about it all  
  
Im still here  
Unafraid  
If you dont come  
  
Oh no no Im in trouble
