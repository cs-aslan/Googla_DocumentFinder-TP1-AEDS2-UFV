Oh anytime and anywhere  
Ill give you all my heart I swear  
And when your love begins to turn  
I light the fire and it burns  
Oh all I want is everything  
But I cant buy you diamond rings  
But I will make your dreams come true  
But one thing I dont want to do  
  
I dont want to be your part time lover  
I dont want to play no silly games  
Oh dont tell me baby theres no other  
I dont want to die in sweet sweet flames  
I dont want to be your part time lover  
I dont want to play no silly games  
I dont want to be your special brother  
Again again again  
  
Oh lonely days and lonely nights  
Im waiting for your call thats right  
Oh should I stay or should I go  
There is a place oh girl I know  
Dont waiting for a star to fall  
Oh hundred times I tried to call  
Oh baby why you telling lies  
And try to break my paradise
