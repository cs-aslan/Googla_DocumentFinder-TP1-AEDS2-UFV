Waking up alone  
In a room that still reminds me  
My heart has got to learn to forget  
Starting on my own  
With every breath Im getting stronger  
This is not the time for regret  
Cause I dont need to hang on to heartbreak  
When theres so much of life left to live  
  
Love is on the way  
On wings of angels  
I know its true I feel it coming through  
Love is on the way  
Time is turning the pages  
I dont know when  
But love will find me again  
  
I am not afraid  
Of the mystery of tomorrow  
I have found the faith deep within  
Theres a promise I have made  
Theres a dream Im gonna follow  
Theres another chance to begin  
And its coming as sure as the heavens  
I can feel it right here in my heart  
  
Love is on the way  
On wings of angels  
I know its true I feel it coming through  
Love is on the way  
Time is turning the pages  
I dont know when  
But love will find me again  
  
Oh I know I know down deep  
down in my heart I know that  
  
Love is on the way  
On wings of angels  
I know its true I feel it coming through  
Love is on the way  
Time is turning the pages  
I dont know when  
But love will find me again  
  
I dont know when  
But love will find me again
