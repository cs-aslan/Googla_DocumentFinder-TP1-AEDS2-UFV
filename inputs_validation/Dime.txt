In the brown shag carpet of a cheap motel  
In the dark and dusty corner by the TV shelf  
Is a small reminder of a simpler time  
When a crumpled up pair of trousers cost a brand new dime  
Well you ask me how I made it through and how my mint condition could belong
to you  
When Im on the ground I roll through town  
Im a president you dont remember getting kicked around  
Im a dime  
Im fine  
And I shine Im freshly minted  
I am determined not to be dented  
By a car or by a plane or anything not yet invented  
  
Im a dime  
Im fine  
And I shine  
In the hiss and rumble of the freeway sounds  
As the afternoon commuters drive their cars around  
Theres a ringle jingle near the underpass  
Theres a sparkle near the fast food garbage and roadside trash  
Im a dime  
Im fine  
And I shine Im freshly minted  
Im silverplated Im underrated  
You wont even pick me up because Im not enough for a local phone call  
  
Im a dime  
Im fine  
And I shine  
Im a dime  
Im fine  
And I shine  
Im a dime  
Im fine  
And I shine
