When you walk without ease  
On these  
Streets where you were raised  
I had a really bad dream  
It lasted twenty years seven months and twenty seven days  
I never Im alone and I  
Never ever oh had no one ever  
  
Now Im outside your house  
Im alone  
And Im outside your house  
I hate to intrude  
Oh alone Im alone Im alone Im alone  
Im alone  
Im alone  
And I never never oh had no one ever  
I never had no one ever  
I never had no no one ever  
Had no one never  
Never no  
Oh
