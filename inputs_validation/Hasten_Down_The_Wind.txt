She tells him she thinks she needs to be free  
He tells her he doesnt understand  
She takes his hand  
She tells him nothings working out the way they planned  
  
Shes so many women  
He cant find the one who was his friend  
So hes hanging on to half her heart  
He cant have the restless part  
So he tells her to hasten down the wind  
  
Then he agrees he thinks she needs to be free  
Then she says shed rather be with him  
But its just a whim  
By which she hopes to keep him on the limb  
  
Shes so many women  
He cant find the one who was his friend  
So hes hanging on to half her heart  
He cant have the restless part  
So he tells her to hasten down the wind
