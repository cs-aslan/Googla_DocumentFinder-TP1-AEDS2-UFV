Aint it beautiful  
Dont it make you feel complete  
It comes into your life  
Then sweeps you right off your feet  
  
Time stands still for two lovers  
And its intangible  
But it hits like steel  
It stops me in my tracks  
  
Makes my private world unsealed  
A crashed car  
A communication failsafe  
We could share this vision  
  
In fact weve got no choice  
Into the arena of love  
Speaking with one voice  
Aint it something else  
  
Like skydiving into Shangrila  
And the clearest cool is the zealblue heaven  
And you cant quite put your finger on it  
And you could be anywhere  
  
Anytime anyplace in your lovers arms  
Could be paradise or walkin on thin ice  
We can share this vision  
Were on some oneway street  
  
Exchanging cigarettes and glances  
We both feel the heat  
Its a love collision  
Love collision  
  
Theres no decision  
Its a love collision  
If I close my eyes  
Visualizing you and I somewhere in this city  
  
And moments of desire  
The steady the silent gaze of lovers transfixed  
We could share this vision  
In fact weve got no choice  
  
Into the arena of love  
Speaking with one voice  
Its a love collision  
Love collision  
  
And theres no decision  
Its a love collision  
  
Love collision  
Love collision  
Love collision  
Love collision  
Love collision  
Love collision  
  
Oh no  
Love collision  
Love collision  
Love collision
