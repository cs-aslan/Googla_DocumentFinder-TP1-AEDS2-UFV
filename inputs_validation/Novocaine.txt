Verse 1  
This is a black black ski mask song  
So put all of your anger on  
In the truly gruesome do we trust  
I will always land on you like a sucker punch  
  
PreChorus  
Singing I am the worst I am the worst nightmare  
Na na na na na na na na na na na  
I am the worst I am the worst nightmare  
Na na na na na na na na na na na  
If you knew knew what the blue birds sang at you  
You would never sing along  
Cast them out because this is our culture  
These new flocks are nothing but vultures  
  
Chorus  
Because they took our love and they filled it up  
Filled me up with Novocaine and now Im just numb  
Now Im just numb  
Dont mind me Im just a son of a gun  
Dont stop dont stop till your heart goes numb  
Now Im just stuck  
I dont feel a thing for you  
  
Verse 2  
Im just a problem that doesnt want to be solved  
So could you please hold your applause  
Take this sideshow and all its freaks  
And turn it into the silver screendream  
  
PreChorus  
Singing I am the worst I am the worst nightmare  
Na na na na na na na na na na na  
I am the worst I am the worst nightmare  
Na na na na na na na na na na na  
If you knew knew what the blue birds sang at you  
You would never sing along  
Cast them out because this is our culture  
These new flocks are nothing but vultures  
  
Chorus  
Because they took our love and they filled it up  
Filled me up with Novocaine and now Im just numb  
Now Im just numb  
Dont mind me Im just a son of a gun  
Dont stop dont stop till your heart goes numb  
Now Im just stuck  
I dont feel a thing for you  
  
Bridge  
Ooooh I say one day the valley is gonna swallow me whole  
Hijack the hype hijack the hype  
I sing like a photo thats been over exposed  
Hijack the hype hijack the hype  
  
Outro  
Because they took our love and they filled it up  
Filled me up with Novocaine and now Im just numb  
Now Im just numb  
Dont mind me Im just a son of a gun  
Dont stop dont stop till your heart goes numb  
Now Im just stuck  
I dont feel a thing for you
