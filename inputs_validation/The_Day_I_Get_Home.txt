When this young man comes rolling home  
The lamp posts move and in the road  
I sing and dance in falling rain  
Its good to be back home again  
The roads of air that map the globe  
Take me away to places new  
Im lucky I can get around  
Im taking off and touching down  
When I get home its much the same  
The tax returns return again  
The news is on it isnt good  
I see the trees but not the wood  
  
The road stretches out as far as I can see  
And I eat the lines ahead of me  
Its experience  
As the days unfold  
But theres nothing quite like  
The day I get home  
  
When this young man comes rolling home  
The cheese on toast is in the grill  
Memories are filed away  
I come and go its fun that way  
The roads of air that map the globe  
Go east and west and north and south  
I like to look and see the sights  
I stay up late and hit the heights  
  
When I return things havent changed  
Neither have I I like to think  
The worlds an oyster on a plate  
I get around and get up late
