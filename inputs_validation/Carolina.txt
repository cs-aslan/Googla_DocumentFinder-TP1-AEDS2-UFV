Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina in the morning  
No one could be sweeter than my sweetie  
When I meet her in the morning  
Where the morning glories twine around the door  
Whispering pretty stories I long to hear once more  
Strolling with my girlie  
Where the dew is pearly early in the morning  
Butterflies all flutter up and kiss each little buttercup at dawning  
If I had Aladdins lamp for only a day  
Id make a wish and heres what Id say
