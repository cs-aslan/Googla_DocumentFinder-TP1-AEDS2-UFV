You had me to get her  
And here I thought it was me  
I was changin arrangin my life to fit your lies  
Its all said and all done  
I gave it all for the long run  
Can she say the same thing  
I guess this is good bye and good luck  
I cant be what you want me to be  
  
Chorus  
Im sorry for changing  
Im sorry it had to be this way  
Believe me its easier just to pretend  
But I wont apologize for who I am  
  
No no  
  
Remember the time when you said  
You were out with your best friend  
But it wasnt the best friend  
That you know I thought you meant and  
I used to accept it  
I didnt know I could be free  
But I am and I wont go back  
cause you so dont deserve me  
I dont even want to be her  
  
Chorus  
  
I thank you for this hopeless war  
Cause through the pain now Im stronger now than before  
Now Im more  
I dont need you anymore  
Im sorry  
Listen close I wont say this again  
  
Chorus  
  
Im sorry for changing  
Im sorry it isnt like it was  
Believe me its easier just to pretend  
But I wont apologize  
Why should I apologize  
No I wont apologize for who I am
