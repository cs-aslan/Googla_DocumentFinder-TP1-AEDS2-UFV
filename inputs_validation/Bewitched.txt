After one whole quart of brandy  
Like a daisy Im awake  
With no bromoseltzer handy  
I dont even shake  
  
Men are not a new sensation  
Ive done pretty well I think  
But this halfpint imitation  
Put me on the blink  
  
Im wild again beguiled again  
A simpering whimpering child again  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered  am I  
  
Couldnt sleep and wouldnt sleep  
When love came and told me I shouldnt sleep  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered  am I  
  
Lost my heart but what of it  
He is cold I agree  
He can laugh but I love it  
Although the laughs on me  
  
Ill sing to him each spring to him  
And long for the day when Ill cling to him  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered  am I  
  
Hes a fool and dont I know it  
But a fool can have his charms  
Im in love and dont I show it  
Like a babe in arms  
  
Loves the same old sad sensation  
Lately Ive not slept a wink  
Since this halfpint imitation  
Put me on the blink  
  
Ive sinned a lot Im mean a lot  
But Im like sweet seventeen a lot  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered  am I  
  
Ill sing to him each spring to him  
And worship the trousers that cling to him  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered  am I  
  
When he talks he is seeking  
Words to get off his chest  
Horizontally speaking hes at his very best  
  
Vexed again perplexed again  
Thank god I can be oversexed again  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered  am I  
  
Wise at last my eyes at last  
Are cutting you down to your size at last  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered  no more  
  
Burned a lot but learned a lot  
And now you are broke so you earned a lot  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered  no more  
  
Couldnt eat was dispeptic  
Life was so hard to bear  
Now my hearts antiseptic  
Since you moved out of there  
  
Romance finis your chance finis  
Those ants that invaded my pants finis  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered  no more
