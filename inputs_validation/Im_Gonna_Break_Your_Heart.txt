Theres a time to laugh and theres a time to cry  
Theres a time to live and love but my love for you has died  
I just dont want you anymore although youve done your part  
I can love you out of sympathy Im gonna break your heart  
I always kinda like you dear and your cute little ways  
  
But I never meant for you to fall in love with me this way  
I should have never let you on and drag your love this far  
Im sorry dear dont waste your tears Im gonna break your heart  
The time to laugh is over and the time to cry has come  
  
But we shared a lot of good times Ive thought we had a lot of fun  
Ive stayed as long as Im goin to now Ive just got to go  
But darling before I do theres something I want you to know  
I tried to make you happy dear I tried to do my part  
  
But love just died go on and cry Im gonna break your heart  
But love just died go on and cry Im gonna break your heart
