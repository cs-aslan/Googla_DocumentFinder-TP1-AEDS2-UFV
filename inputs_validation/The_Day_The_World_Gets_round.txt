The day the world gets round  
to understanding where it is  
Using all its found  
to help each other hand in hand  
  
The day the world gets round  
to understanding where its gone  
Losing so much ground  
killing each other hand in hand  
Such foolishness in man  
I want no part of their plan  OH NO  
  
If youre the destructive kind  
Now Im working from day to day  
As I dont want to be like you  
I look for the pure of heart  
And the ones that have made a start  
  
But Lord there are just a few  
who bow before you  
in silence they pray  
  
Oh how they pray for the day the  
world gets round  
  
Using all theyve found  
To help each other hand in hand  
  
The Day The World Gets Round
