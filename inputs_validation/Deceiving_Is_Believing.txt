I always have an alibi  
You allow me there  
But tonight I have no conscience  
So what comes after that  
  
Youre coming down already  
This high wont see us through  
Nothing I can change now  
Ive learnt to lie to you  
  
What happened to me  
What happened to you  
You were pulling me on  
I was leading you through  
Lie to me  
  
I always had a vision  
That love would see us through  
But whats the point in wishing  
When my dreams depend on you  
Gonna need support now  
Your friends can gather round  
And you can tell them stories  
On how I let you down  
  
What happened to me  
What happened to you  
You were pulling me on  
I was leading you through  
Lie to me  
  
Deceiving is believing  
Deceiving is believing  
Deceiving is believing  
Deceiving is believing  
  
Im much too young to be cynical  
Its you that makes me miserable  
Can you tell a lie through a smile  
In bed we always deviate  
And Im the one who comes too late  
These things hide inside of my mind my mind  
  
I always have an alibi  
You allow me there  
But tonight I have no conscience  
So what comes after that  
  
What happened to me  
What happened to you  
You were pulling me on  
I was leading you through  
Lie to me  
  
Lie to me  
Lie to me  
Deceiving is believing  
Believing  
Believing  
Believing  
  
Believe
