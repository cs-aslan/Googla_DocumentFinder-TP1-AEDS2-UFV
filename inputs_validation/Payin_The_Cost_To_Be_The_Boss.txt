You act like you wanna listen when Im talkin to you  
You think you oughta do baby anything you wanna do  
  
You must be crazy baby  
You just gotta be outta your mind  
As long as Im payin the bills  
Im payin the cost to be the boss  
  
Ill drink if I wanna and play a little poker too  
I dont want to hear nothin from ya  
As long as Im takin care of you  
As long as Im workin baby payin all the bills  
I dont want no mouth from you bout the way Im supposed to live  
  
You must be crazy baby  
You just gotta be outta your mind  
As long as Im footin the bill  
Im payin the cost to be the boss  
  
Now that you got me huh you act like youre ashamed  
You dont act like my man  youre just usin my name  
Im gonna have all the money baby  
I dont want no back talk  
You dont like how Im doin  
You can pick up your things and walk  
  
You must be crazy baby  
You just gotta be outta your mind  
As long as Im payin the bills  
Im payin the cost to be the boss
