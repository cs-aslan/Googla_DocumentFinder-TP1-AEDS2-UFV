He always found it hard to take her  
She wouldnt listen to advice  
And though he never tried to make her  
She often thought it would be nice  
  
Oh and now shes headin out to California  
Its been a long time comin but shes feeling like a woman tonight  
And she left a little letter said shes gonna make a stop in Nevada  
Goodbye goodbye  
  
She tried for years to be a good wife  
It never quite got off the ground  
And all those stories of the good life  
Convinced her not to hang around  
  
Oh and now shes heading out to California  
And she doesnt know whats comin but shes sure of what shes leaving behind  
And she left a little letter said shes gonna make a stop in Nevada  
Goodbye goodbye  
  
And though she finds it hard to leave him  
She knows it would be worse to stay  
He wouldnt understand the reasons  
That make a woman run away  
  
Oh and now shes heading out to California  
With some money in her pocket shes a rocket on the fourth of July  
And she left a little letter said shes gonna make a stop in Nevada  
Goodbye goodbye
