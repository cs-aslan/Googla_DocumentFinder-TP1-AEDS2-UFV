My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
And I aint comin back here anymore  
  
I had me a mother that could pray boys  
She prayed for me both night and day boys  
And I tore down every down every prayer that she could say boys  
And I aint comin back here anymore  
  
I want to find me a lady fair and tender  
Want to play her song on my steel strings  
Gonna lay her down in a bed of clover  
Then I aint comin back here anymore  
  
Ive seen this whole wide country over  
From New York city down to Mexico  
And Ive seen the joyful and the sorrow  
And I aint comin back here anymore  
  
So Mister Sinby can you hear me  
Down there in Gracel LouisanaO  
Ill lay a joint upon your grave Sir  
Then I aint comin back here anymore  
  
My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
And I aint comin back here anymore
