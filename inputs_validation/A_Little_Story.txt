School yall to somethin right quick  
Sit down open your ears close your eyes listen  
Heres a little story that I got to tell  
About this Chico named Pit everyone knows so well  
Illmatic like Nas but that aint hard to tell  
Owes it all to Dade County and the ATL  
Picked rap and skipped the triple beam scale  
And its a known fact he gon die before he fails  
These boys rap about hustlin but cant make bail  
I call that hustling backwards and thats real  
Miamis hot so I can vacation in hell  
The way the game is shit man I mind as well  
I look at these fools on camera flashin they tools  
They mustve forgot the streets got codes and rules  
But me Im confused  
Cause rappers wanna be gangstas  
Gangstas wanna be rappers  
Ballers wanna be rappers  
And rappers wanna be ballers  
The truth is its more sickening than Ebola  
Until they handcuff then its over  
Pop up no dandruff no neck just head and shoulders  
Bust guns sell drugs thats what the streets showed us  
But corporate America thats what they sold us
