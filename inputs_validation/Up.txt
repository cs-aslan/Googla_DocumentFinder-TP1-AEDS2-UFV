Verse 1

Waited for your reply here in the pouring rain

Just breathe against the glass  
Leave me some kind of sign  
I know the hurt wont pass yeah  
Just tell me its not the end of the line  
Just tell me its not the end of the line  
  
Chorus  
I never meant to break your heart  
I wont let this plane go down  
I never meant to make you cry  
Ill do what it takes to make this fly oh  
You gotta hold on hold on to what youre feeling  
That feeling is the best thing the best thing alright  
Im gonna place my bet on us  
I know this love is heading in the same direction  
Thats up

From your side to mine  
Ill be the one to cross over
