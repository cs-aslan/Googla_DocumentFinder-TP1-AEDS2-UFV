Need I say I love you  
Need I say I care  
Need I say that emotions  
Something we dont share  
I dont want to be sitting here  
Trying to deceive you  
Cos you know I know baby  
I dont wanna go  
  
We cannot live together  
We cannot live apart  
Thats the situation  
Ive known it from the start  
Every time that I look at you  
I can see the future  
Cos you know I know baby  
I dont wanna go  
  
Throwing it all away  
Throwing it all away  
Is there nothing that I can say  
To make you change your mind  
I watch the world go round and round  
And see mine turning upside down  
Youre throwing it all away  
  
Wholl light up the darkness  
Who will hold your hand  
Who will find you the answers  
When you dont understand  
Why should I have to be the one  
Who has to convince you  
Cos you know I know baby  
That I dont wanna go  
  
Some day youll be sorry  
Someday when youre free  
Memories will remind you  
That our love was meant to be  
Late at night when you call my name  
The only sound youll hear  
Is the sound of your voice calling  
Calling after me  
  
Just throwing it all away  
Throwing it all away  
Theres nothing I can say  
Youre throwing it all away
