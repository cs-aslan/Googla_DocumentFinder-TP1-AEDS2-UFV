Chorus  
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain  
Telling me just what a fool Ive been  
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain  
And let me be alone again  
  
Now the only girl Ive ever loved has gone away  
Looking for a brand new start  
Little does she know that when she left that day  
Along with her she took my heart  
  
Bridge  
Rain please tell me now does that seem fair  
For her to steal my heart away when she dont care  
I cant love another when my hearts somewhere far away  
  
Chorus  
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain  
Telling me just what a fool Ive been  
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain  
And let me be alone again  
  
Bridge  
Oh the only girl Ive ever loved has gone away  
Looking for a brand new start  
Little does she know that when she left that day  
Along with her she took my heart  
  
Rain wont you tell her that I love her so  
Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow  
And rain in her heart and let the love we knew start to grow  
  
Chorus  
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain  
Telling me just what a fool Ive been  
Oh I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain  
And let me be alone again  
  
When the rain comes  
They run and hide their heads  
They might as well be dead  
When the rain comes
