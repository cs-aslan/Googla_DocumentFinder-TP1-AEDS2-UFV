Our fair country Canada  
Is north of the USA  
Our maritimes are lovely  
And our prairies give us hay  
You might think you Yankees are better than us Canucks  
But we dont need no microchips inside our hockey pucks  
  
We know that youve got Disney World  
And you keep it very clean  
We dont have Bob Dole  
But we can drink when were 19  
We even watch your TV shows for hours and hours and hours  
Well give you Alan Thicke but Shania Twain is ours  
  
Were proud to be Canadian  
Were awfully nice to strangers  
Our manners feel our curse  
Its cool in many ways to be Canadian  
We wont say that we are better  
Its just that were less worse  
  
Your beer is not too tasty  
And you weather cant be beat  
We all fly south in the winter time  
To escape the snow and sleet  
Were pleased to say weve enjoyed all your southern charms  
But we get sun burnt when we exercise our right to bear our arms  
  
Were proud to be Canadian  
Were awfully nice to strangers  
Our manners feel our curse  
Its cool in many ways to be Canadian  
We wont say that we are better  
Its just that were less worse  
  
Alanis Morrissette  
She is our latest pride and joy  
She used to sing about high school dances  
And chancing after boys  
But now she is fed up and about as angry as can be  
Shes got one hand in her pocket and the other is on guard for thee  
  
Were proud to be Canadian  
Were awfully nice to strangers  
Our manners feel our curse  
Its cool in many ways to be Canadian  
We wont say that we are better  
Its just that were less worse  
  
Were proud to be Canadian  
Were awfully nice to strangers  
Our manners feel our curse  
Its cool in many ways to be Canadian  
We wont say that we are better  
Its just that were less worse  
  
We wont say that we are better  
Its just that were less worse  
  
Tears are not enough
