Ask and you wont be forgiven  
This is a blessing in disguise  
All of your choices are spoken  
Youve killed the child in my eyes  
Im gonna see you burn  
  
When in some dark distant future  
youll meet my presence in a song  
Youll punch the walls in frustration  
Can you hear my voice and say Im wrong  
Im gonna see you burn  
  
With the first light I touch your skin  
rise above the challenge the day begins  
and the brightnessss runs to black  
fading in the darkness Im not coming back  
  
Here we live and here now we die  
on this mountainside  
arms entwined the chosen the brave  
fire wind to take you away like the wrath of God  
  
Ask and you wont be forgiven  
This is a blessing in disguise  
All of your choices are spoken  
Youve killed the child in my eyes  
Im gonna see you burn
