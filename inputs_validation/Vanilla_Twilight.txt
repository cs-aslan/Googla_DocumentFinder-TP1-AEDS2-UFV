The stars lean down to kiss you  
And I lie awake and miss you  
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere  
Cause Ill doze off safe and soundly  
But Ill miss your arms around me  
Id send a postcard to you dear  
Cause I wish you were here  
  
Ill watch the night turn light blue  
But its not the same without you  
Because it takes two to whisper quietly  
The silence isnt so bad  
Til I look at my hands and feel sad  
Cause the spaces between my fingers  
Are right where yours fit perfectly  
  
Ill find repose in new ways  
Though I havent slept in two days  
Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone  
But drenched in vanilla twilight  
Ill sit on the front porch all night  
Waist deep in thought because when  
I think of you I dont feel so alone  
  
I dont feel so alone  
I dont feel so alone  
  
As many times as I blink  
Ill think of you tonight  
  
Ill think of you tonight  
  
When violet eyes get brighter  
And heavy wings grow lighter  
Ill taste the sky and feel alive again  
And Ill forget the world that I knew  
But I swear I wont forget you  
Oh if my voice could reach back through the past  
Id whisper in your ear  
Oh darling I wish you were here
