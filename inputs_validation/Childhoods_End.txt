I lived a life of illusion and you had your kicks  
So what theres nothing left to do  
And you and your obsessions and your crucifix  
As if what I thought mattered much to you  
  
And you were always my friend  
From Childhoods End  
It was forever and ever  
Did you understand  
Its Childhoods End  
But never the dream is over  
  
Sunday morning in the New York Times  
I read you died last night  
It said you were smilin when you blew your mind  
And the note you left behind said  
  
You were always my friend  
From Childhoods End  
Seems like forever and ever  
Yeah you wont have to have to pretend  
Its near the end  
You wont ever be a rock and roller  
Yeah you were always my friend  
From Childhoods End  
But never the dream is over  
You were just like me  
I was just like you  
For eternity Ill think of you  
  
Repeat chorus fade out  
Youve got something about you  
Youve got something I need
