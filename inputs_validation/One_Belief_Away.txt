Last night I thought I found you  
I saw it in a dream  
I was tangled in the rushes baby  
You were caught up in the stream  
And the more I tried to reach you  
The more you slipped away  
And when I woke up in the darkness  
I was callin out your name  
  
Chorus  
You and we dance around it  
Why is the truth so hard to say  
We long for true love well  
Weve found it its just  
One Belief Away  
  
Theres a shadow in the garden  
And its coiled around our hearts  
Wont you help me to believe you baby  
Wont you show me where to start  
  
The more I try to reach you  
The more you slip away  
I want to wake up in the darkness  
And hear you callin out my name  
  
Chorus
