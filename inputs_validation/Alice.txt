Trippin out  
Spinnin around  
Im underground I fell down  
Yeah I fell down  
  
Im freakin out  
So where am I now  
Upside down  
And I cant stop it now  
It cant stop me now  
  
I Ill get by  
I Ill survive  
When the worlds crashing down  
When I fall and hit the ground  
I will turn myself around  
Dont you try to stop me  
I I wont cry  
  
I found myself in Wonderland  
Get back on my feet again  
Is this real  
Is this pretend  
Ill take a stand until the end  
  
I Ill get by  
I Ill survive  
When the worlds crashing down  
When I fall and hit the ground  
I will turn myself around  
Dont you try to stop me  
I I wont cry  
  
I Ill get by  
I Ill survive  
When the worlds crashing down  
When I fall and hit the ground  
I will turn myself around  
Dont you try to stop me  
I I wont cry
