Tear me to bits enjoy the scene  
Of screen name verbal vanity  
Churning the words embued in filth  
Your tongue oily water under my bridge  
  
You have the world  
Its all for you  
I wish youd find the lost in you  
Grateful for the pain  
It proves were alive  
Can you feel it  
  
I cant make you want the truth  
Its up to you  
  
Yours is an empty hope  
Yours is an empty hope  
  
Feed me to pigs in your fantasies  
Your sea roars bitter elegies  
Like narcissus who bribes the pool  
A hollow voice ruin with a roof  
  
Stop Life is now still all for you  
Turn from the hate  
Turn from the smoke  
I see the parchment of your soul  
The note the song  
Join your voice  
  
I cant let you have the world  
Its all for you  
  
Yours is an empty hope  
Yours is an empty hope
