The darkness has come to the roses  
The fire is reaching the air  
The colours that I have created  
Are suddenly flying away  
  
Im not fighting myself will not follow  
Cause my choices are mine its my fate  
And Ill never bow down from the sorrow  
Ill face all that is coming my way  
  
The lying the devil the silence  
Embracing the world on the edge  
  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
The night in the skies here tonight  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
In this fire that makes us yearn  
Were fighting our fear of the silence  
Were running through walls where they stand  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
  
Im searching no more for tomorrow  
I reach for the skies while I can  
The unknown will always be waiting  
My last day Ill jump in its hands  
  
Im not fighting myself will not follow  
Cause my choices are mine its my fate  
And Ill never bow down from the sorrow  
Ill face all that is coming my way  
  
The lying the devil the silence  
Embracing the world on the edge  
  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
The night in the skies here tonight  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
In this fire that makes us yearn  
Were fighting our fear of the silence  
Were running through walls where they stand  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
  
Why why dont you let me burn  
Why dont you come down  
And break out and let me burn  
  
Oh why why dont you let me burn  
Why dont you let me burn  
Why dont you let me burn  
  
Oh why  
Chasing the demons in my mind  
Oh why me  
Waiting for chains to throw me to the ground  
  
The darkness has come to the roses  
And the fire is reaching the air  
  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
The night in the skies here tonight  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
In this fire that makes us yearn  
Were fighting our fear of the silence  
Were running through walls where they stand  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
Let us burn
