Verse  
Fall out of bed and catch a fading star  
Fancy I woke up before my alarm  
Brought my mind through my eyes  
Its the best I can do  
Before its automatic hand it over turn it to you  
Though her smile when it happens almost as if it was magic  
It means theres a god somewhere and hes laughing  
And I shuffle my slipperless toes to the kitchen  
Still low to the ground but high on living  
Chorus  
And I know I know its gonna be a good day  
Hello hello you beautiful thing  
Verse  
Waking up and stretch my body  
And acknowledge the makes  
It must be something I did yesterday  
Pour a cup of liquid gold  
Cause my engines still cold  
And in a minute everythings gonna change  
Chorus  
Cause I know I know its gonna be a good day  
Hello hello you beautiful thing  
Yes I know I know its gonna be a good day  
Hello hello you beautiful thing

Verse  
Looking out from a  watching the band of the  
Earth take the plaque of the night from the dirt  
I can see from the depths of my readjustinize of reflection  
Of yess and that ever changing sky  
But why do bad dreams linger long after I awake  
I dont need no scenes of valid paying replayed   
And I feel quite foolish sometimes when I pray  
But my thoughts are all Ive got so I try to make them brave  
Chorus  
Cause I know I know its gonna be a good day  
Hello hello you beautiful thing  
Hello hello you beautiful thing  
I say hello hello you beautiful thing  
Oh now this is what Ive been waiting for  
this is what Ive been waiting for  
Oh this is what Ive been waiting for this is what Ive been waiting for  
Oh this is what Ive been waiting for this is what Ive been waiting for  
Oh this is what Ive been waiting for Hello  
I know I know its gonna be a good day  
Hello hello you beautiful thing
