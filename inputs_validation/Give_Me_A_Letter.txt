Give me a letter  
The sooner the better  
Im out of here  
  
Give me a card  
Im not waiting hard  
To hear you  
  
All Im trying to do  
Is all you want to say  
  
Give me a letter  
The sooner the better  
Im away from you  
  
Trying so hard  
Im not taking a car  
And Ill lose you  
  
All I want to do  
Is all Im trying to say  
  
What Im trying to say  
Is what Im trying to do  
  
Repeat first two verses  
What Im trying to say  
What Im trying to do  
Is keeping up with you
