Its tearin up my heart when Im with you  
But when we are apart I feel it too  
And no matter what I do I feel the pain  
With or without you  
Baby I dont understand  
Just why we cant be lovers  
Things are gettin out of hand  
Tryin too much but baby we cant win  
Let it go  
If you want me girl let me know  
I am down on my knees  
I cant take it anymore  
  
Baby dont misunderstand  
What Im tryin to tell ya  
In the corner of my mind  
Baby it feels like were running out of time  
Let it go  
If you want me girl let me know  
I am down on my knees  
I cant take it anymore  
  
Tearin up my heart and soul  
Were apart I feel it too  
and no matter what I do I feel the pain  
with or without you  
Tearin up my heart and soul  
Were apart I feel it too  
and no matter what I do I feel the pain  
with or with out you  
Its tearin up my heart when Im with you  
Tearin up my heart and soul  
But when we are apart I feel it too  
Were apart I feel it too  
And no matter what I do I feel the pain  
With or without you  
And no matter what I do I feel the pain  
With or without you
