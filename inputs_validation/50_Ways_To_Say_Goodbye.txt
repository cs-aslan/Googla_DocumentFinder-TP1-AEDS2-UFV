My heart is paralyzed  
My head was over sized  
Ill take the high road like I should  
You said its meant to be  
That its not you its me  
Youre leaving now for my own good  
  
Thats cool but if my friends ask where you are Im gonna say  
  
She went down in an airplane  
Fried getting suntan  
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand  
Help me help me Im no good at goodbyes  
She met a shark under water  
Fell and no one caught her  
I returned everything I ever bought her  
Help me help me Im all out of lies  
And ways to say you died  
  
My pride still feels the sting  
You were my everything  
Some day Ill find a love like yours a love like yours  
Shell think Im Superman  
Not super minivan  
How could you leave on Yom Kippur  
  
Thats cool but if my friends ask where you are Im gonna say  
  
She was caught in a mudslide  
Eaten by a lion  
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion  
Help me help me Im no good at goodbyes  
She dried up in the desert  
Drown in a hot tub  
Danced to death at an east side night club  
Help me help me Im all out of lies  
And ways to say you died  
  
I wanna live a thousand lives with you  
I wanna be the one youre dying to  
Love but you dont want to  
  
Thats cool but if my friends ask where you are Im gonna say  
Thats cool but if my friends ask where you are Im gonna say  
  
She went down in an airplane  
Fried getting suntan

Help me help me Im no good at goodbyes

I returned everything I ever bought her  
Help me help me Im all out of lies

Help me help me Im no good at goodbyes  
She dried up in the desert  
Drown in a hot tub  
Danced to death at an eastside night club  
Help me help me Im all out of lies  
And ways to say goodboy
