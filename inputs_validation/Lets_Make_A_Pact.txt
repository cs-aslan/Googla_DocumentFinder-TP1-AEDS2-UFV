Empty me  
Like a dustman rids a rubbish bin  
Fill me up with glimpses of you  
And let the music begin  
Oh oh oh  
Take me to the altar  
  
Lets make a pact  
One well never take back  
Let me prove that Im true  
Lets make a pact  
  
Alter me  
The change could only do me good  
Other have tried to and failed  
I wish that somebody could  
Oh oh oh  
Do what no one can do  
  
Lets make a pact  
One well never take back  
Let me prove that Im true  
Lets make a pact  
  
Take me to the world and let me wonder at the view  
Set me off in motion and let me dance  
After 20 years of doubt and then a week with you  
Im ready baby  follow through  
  
Cover me in dirt  
And leave me to the wind and the rain  
If I should ever hurt  
The one who made me human again  
Oh oh oh  
Take me to the altar  
  
Lets make a pact  
One well never take back  
Let me prove that Im true  
Lets make a pact  
  
Lets make a pact  
One well never take back  
Let me prove that Im true  
Lets make a pact
