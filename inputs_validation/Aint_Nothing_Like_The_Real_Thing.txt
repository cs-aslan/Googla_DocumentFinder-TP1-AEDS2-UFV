Aint nothing like the real thing baby  
Aint nothing like the real thing  
Aint nothing like the real thing baby  
Aint nothing like the real thing  
  
I got your picture hanging on my wall  
But it cant seem to come to me  
When I call your name  
I realized its just a picture in a frame  
  
I read your letters but youre not here  
They dont move me they dont groove me  
Like when I hear  
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear  
  
I play my games of fantasy  
I pretend I dont see reality  
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me  
  
I got some memories to look back on  
Though they help me when youre gone  
Im well aware  
Nothing can take the place of you being there  
  
No other sound is quite the same as your name  
No touch can do half as much  
To make me feel better  
Lets stay together  
  
Im so  
So glad we got the real thing baby  
So glad we got the real thing  
Aint nothing like the real thing baby  
Aint nothing like the real thing
