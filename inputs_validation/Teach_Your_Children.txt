You who are on the road  
Must have a code that you can live by  
And so become yourself  
Because the past is just a goodbye  
Teach your children well  
Their fathers hell  
Will slowly go by  
And feed them on your dreams  
The one they pick  
The one youll know by  
Dont you ever ask them why  
If they told you you would cry  
So just look at them and sigh  
And know they love you  
And know they love you  
And you of tender years  
Dont know the fears  
That your elders grew by  
So please help them with your youth  
They seek the truth  
Before they can die  
Can you hear and do you care  
And cant you see we must be free  
To teach our children what you believe in  
Make a world that we can believe in  
Teach your parents well  
Their childrens hell  
Will slowly go by  
And feed them on your dreams  
The one they pick  
The one youll know by  
Dont you ever ask them why  
If they told you you would cry  
So just look at them and sigh  
And know they love you  
And know thay love you  
And know thay love you
