Ive been losing myself beneath this so much broken by the rain  
Nothing can take my mind off how to make them pay  
Give up myself to nothing then the pain will go away  
Losing myself to know this Ive been going away  
  
If I could turn the hands of time  
I would but here I am  
  
Tell me why am I still here when Im so dead  
I am just a ghost of yesterday  
Tell me why am I still trying to hold on  
Gotta turn it down to let it go  
  
I do turn to keep on trying but I spend it to the end  
Knowing that theres no person for my rising side  
Ive buried again in evil always the one whos left behind  
I am the one whos standing I will live to tell  
  
If I could turn the hands of time I would but here I am here I am  
  
Tell me why am I still here when Im so dead  
I am just a ghost of yesterday  
Tell me why am I still trying to hold on  
Gotta turn it down to let it go  
  
Tell me why Im wasting away  
Tell me how to be my own change  
Cause Ive been losing it too long  
Tell me how to stand here and fight  
Tell me how to face my own day  
Cause Im still standing  
  
Im still standing such as a fighter  
Ive got to fight for all of it  
  
Tell me why am I still here when Im so dead  
I am just a ghost of yesterday  
  
Tell me why am I still here when Im so dead  
I am just a ghost of yesterday  
Tell me why am I still trying to hold on  
Gotta turn it down to let it go
