All the way back in a history  
How a girl thinks is a mystery  
We spend our lives cruisin the bars  
The Venus girls and the men from mars  
So in all this time did you ever think  
Do the girl see red when the man sees pink  
And if your best lovins in the past  
Cuz youre somewhere slow is nowhere fast  
Youre outta your head yeah  
So outta your head yeah  
Stay outta your head  
You better get with it  
Cuz youre so without it  
Youre outta your head yeah  
So outta your head yeah  
Stay outta your head  
Somewhere somewhere underneath the rainbow  
Aaarbricka braka fiya kraka sis boombah  
Heres comes trouble in a push up bra  
Your style is sharp as carpet tack  
But youre out of your box and youre way off track  
You can moderate on a mental binge  
Your catastrophes on a lunatic fringe  
Its good for the gander its tit for tat  
You say its all good but its more than that  
Youre outta your head yeah  
So outta your headyeah  
Stay outta your head  
You better get with it  
Cuz youre so without it  
Youre outta your headyeah  
So outta your headyeah  
Stay outta your head  
So in all this time did you ever think think think think think  
So outta your headyeah
