No man ever sounded so lonesome  
No man ever made you feel such pain  
Lord it must have been a real mean bottle  
That made you sing that way  
The stories you told about prison  
About a young man gone astray  
Lord it must have been a real mean bottle  
That made you write the songs that way  
A real mean bottle poured straight from the devil  
Its a miracle youre standin here today  
A real mean bottle made you such a rebel  
Mustve been a real mean bottle made you sing that way  
You spent most all your life with strangers  
With a ramblin fever in your veins  
Hag it must have been a real mean bottle  
That made you play the blues that way  
A real mean bottle poured straight from the devil  
Its a miracle youre standin here today  
A real mean bottle made you such a rebel  
It mustve been a real mean bottle made you sing that way  
A real mean bottle poured straight from the devil  
It mustve been a real mean bottle made you sing that way
