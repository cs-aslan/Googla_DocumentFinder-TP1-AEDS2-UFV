It was a masquerade at Mardi Gras  
That was the only trip that I recall  
Every time I turned around at all  
There was you  
  
Some days are easier said than done  
Always expecting somethings wrong  
Id rather live alone than drag this on  
  
Take your time please lay your hands on me  
Dont wanna be alone oh no  
A mask behind the face and then youre gone  
Ohyeah comes a time when youre better off alone  
Youre on your own  
  
Ive got a kaleidoscope of memories  
Visions of you locked up inside of me  
Cant you see  
  
We once collided like a broken wheel  
So undecided what was real  
Maybe a crash somehow has sex appeal  
Whatever turns you on  
  
Take your time please lay your hands on me  
Dont wanna be alone oh no  
A mask behind a face and then youre gone  
Oh yeah comes a time when youre better off alone  
  
One down one to go  
Oh no playin in a carnival  
Your time is gone  
  
One down one to go  
Oh no playin in a carnival  
Youre all alone  
  
One down one to go  
Oh no youre on your own
