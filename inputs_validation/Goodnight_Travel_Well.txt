The unknown distance to the great beyond  
Stares back at my grieving frame  
To cast my shadow by the holy sun  
My spirit moans with a sacred pain  
And its quiet now  
The universe is standing still  
  
Chorus  
Theres nothing I can say  
Theres nothing we can do now  
Theres nothing I can say  
Theres nothing we can do now  
  
And all that stands between the souls release  
This temporary flesh and bone  
We know that its over now  
I feel my faded mind begin to roam  
  
Every time you fall  
And every time you try  
Every foolish dream  
And every compromise  
Every word you spoke  
And everything you said  
Everything you left me rambles in my head  
  
Chorus  
  
Up above the world so high  
  
And everything you loved  
And every time you try  
Everybodys watching  
Everybody cry  
  
Stay dont leave me  
The stars cant for your sign  
Dont signal now  
  
Chorus  
  
Goodnight travel well  
Goodnight travel well  
  
And theres nothing I can say  
Theres nothing I can do now
