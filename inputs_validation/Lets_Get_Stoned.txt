Lets go get stoned lets go get stoned  
When your baby wont let you in  
Got a few pennies a bottle of gin  
Just call your buddy on the telephone  
Lets go get stoned  
  
Lets go get stoned lets go get stoned  
When you work so hard all the day long  
And every thing you do seems to go wrong  
Just drop by my place on your way home  
Lets go get stoned  
  
It aint no harm youre taking just a taste  
But dont blow your cool and start messing up the place  
It aint no harm youre faking just a nip  
But make sure you dont fall down bust your lip  
Lets go get stoned lets go get stoned
