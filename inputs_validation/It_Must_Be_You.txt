It must be you  
Makin me feel things I cant explain  
For some reason Im just laughin at the rain  
I cant believe  
Who I am has changed so suddenly  
Im doin things I never thought Id do  
This is not like me  
It must be you  
  
It must be love  
Nothin else could turn me upside down  
Or plant my feet so firmly on the ground  
Whats happening  
Everything I say I want to sing  
Everything Ive dreamed is coming true  
Whats this feeling in my heart  
It must be you  
  
Hold me now like this forever  
And let this moment go on endlessly  
Cause Im alive when youre beside me  
Thats how I know were how its supposed to be
