Maybe Im a little oldfashioned maybe youre a little unkind  
Maybe Im a little impatient well concede that in mind  
You wont give me your number you wont give me your time  
You said meet me on the corner and theres still no sign  
Maybe Im a little outdated maybe a little out of time  
To believe your heart is in the right place  
Despite what youre doing to mine  
So Im standing on the corner looking like I dont care  
Dyou want to crucify my feelings with your fingernails  
And leave the loneliest boy in the western world  
Cruising the streets for an ice cream girl  
I feel like a shady politician trying to sell a brokendown car  
Sit home sleeping for virgin princess you know thats not what you are  
Do I have to feel this small before youll play ball  
Maybe I lack sophistication maybe a little unrefined  
So my credit aint too good well call a dollar a dime  
You wont give me your number you wont give me your time  
Im standing on the corner and theres still no sign  
Dyou want to crucify my feelings with your fingernails  
And leave the loneliest boy in the western world  
Cruising the streets for an ice cream girl hey  
Dyou want to crucify my feelings with your fingernails  
And leave the loneliest boy in the western world  
Cruising the streets for an ice cream girl
