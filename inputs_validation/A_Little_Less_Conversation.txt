A little less conversation  
A little less conversation a little more action please  
All this aggravation aint satisfactioning me  
A little more bite and a little less bark  
  
A little less fight and a little more spark  
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me  
Satisfy me baby  
Baby close your eyes and listen to the music  
  
Drifting through a summer breeze  
Its a groovy night and I can show you how to use it  
Come along with me and put your mind at ease  
A little less conversation a little more action please  
  
All this aggravation aint satisfactioning me  
A little more bite and a little less bark  
A little less fight and a little more spark  
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me  
  
Satisfy me baby  
Come on baby Im tired of talking  
Grab your coat and lets start walking  
Come on come on  
  
Come on come on  
Come on come on  
Dont procrastinate dont articulate  
Girl its getting late gettin upset waitin around  
  
A little less conversation a little more action please  
All this aggravation aint satisfactioning me  
A little more bite and a little less bark  
A little less fight and a little more spark  
  
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me  
Satisfy me baby
