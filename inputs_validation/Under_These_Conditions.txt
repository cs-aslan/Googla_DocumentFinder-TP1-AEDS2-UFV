I know were both married  
Yet were both alone  
Hes always working  
And shes never home  
If we got together  
It would be so good  
But under these conditions  
I dont think we should  
  
Cause we both have children  
And they need us around  
Although were both willing  
We cant let em down  
As much as we want to  
You know where we stand  
Under these conditions  
I dont think we can  
  
We love each other  
But its only in dreams  
But we have to get used to the fact  
Its just one of those things  
Well never know how  
This love could feel  
And under these conditions  
We never will
