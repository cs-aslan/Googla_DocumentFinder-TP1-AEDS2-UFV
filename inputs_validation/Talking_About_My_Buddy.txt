My friend finally made a record and took to the road and played guitar  
He met this girl from Pennsylvania stuck by his side in love and war  
Fearful and fussy but so faithful poor and devoted real and true  
Shes not the type to be forsaken and I see much of her in you  
  
While on a gig up in Toronto during a pause between his show  
He met this foxy German stallion who understood him head to toe  
She played it smart and learned his weakness and made him confess and yield
into  
Her lustful whims became his fancy and I would fear the same from you  
  
Then in the swank suburbs of Houston off in a mansion built of stone  
Escorted by this wealthy widow into her lounge and left alone  
Her maid announced that she was waiting for him to come and rendezvous  
Where he bestowed a long relation one like I hope to have with you  
  
Then on the sands right off the ocean just as the sun sank in the sea  
So did my buddy slow and easy into a freak of fancyfree  
It was a group in automation getting together two by two  
Where people live and love one another people who live like me and you  
  
Then on the beach in warm Miami there was a teacher far from school  
Taught him the way to please a woman made him concede the Golden Rule  
He learned to do it unto others as he used to just have them do  
So they began to come together as I will try to do with you  
  
And there was one who was a virgin never been touched by anyone  
She was as pure as any angel in fact shes called to be a nun  
But it was all because my buddy just couldnt spoil a girl so true  
And so he left her as he found her like I may have to do with you  
  
The girl hes got now hes never left her she was the first I thought hed
shun  
Until I saw my buddys eyes when she came forth and bore his son  
Since then hes known no other woman I think his ramblin days are through  
They built a home up in the country a life Id love to build with you  
  
Although youve never known my buddy and I am sure he dont know you  
But you know the life hes living and all of the changes hes been through  
Sweetheart Im talking about my buddy cause I dont want to wind up blue  
I could be happy with you only cause I see all of them in you
