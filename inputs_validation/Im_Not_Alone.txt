I see what I do first look at the phone  
Turn on your TV  
Unscrew a bottle of beer  
An orange square cellophane cheese  
First I think of this and then I turn to that  
Maybe I just dont think  
Might sing to this I might sing to that  
If I could only sing  
  
Now as you can see  
This clearly isnt me  
Im not alone Im just blue  
Im not alone  
  
There was a day when I was alone  
A few sane days ago  
There was a love Ive been living with  
That I lost on the way home  
First I thought of this  
And then I turn to that  
And then I turn a little bit scared  
Well I feel a little bit easier  
Knowing that youre here  
  
Now as you can see  
This clearly isnt me  
Im not alone Im just blue  
Im not alone  
  
First I think of this  
Then I turn to that  
Then I turn a little scared  
I feel a little easier now  
Knowing that youre all here  
  
Now as you can see  
This clearly isnt me  
Im not alone Im just blue  
Im not alone
