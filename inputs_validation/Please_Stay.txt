Please stay  
Please stay  
Two words Ive thought Id never learn to say  
Dont go away  
Please stay  
  
Dont leave me here  
When so many things so hard to see are clear  
I need you near to me  
  
Will you stay with me to the end  
When theres nothing left  
But you and me and the wind  
Well never know till we try  
To find the other side of goodbye  
  
Please stay  
Please slay  
Two words Ive thought Id never learn to say  
Dont go away  
Please stay
