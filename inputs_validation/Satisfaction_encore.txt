I cant get no satisfaction I cant get no satisfaction  
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try I cant get no I cant get no  
When Im driving in my car and that man comes on the radio  
And hes telling me more and more about some useless information  
Supposed to fire my imagination  
I cant get no Oh no no no Hey hey hey thats what I say  
When Im watching my tv and that man comes on to tell me how white my shirts
  
When Im riding round the world and Im doin this and Im signin that  
And Im trying to make some girl  
Who tells me baby maybe come back later next week  
Cause you see Im on a losing streak
