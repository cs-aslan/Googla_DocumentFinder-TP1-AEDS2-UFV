I picked you up I held you out  
I love you I love you  
I placed you down I held my breath  
I wonder Yeah I wonder  
Whatd I do Youre not around  
  
Its a fall  
Ive got to tell you  
That this wall was not meant for you  
I see sides all sides all around  
Get through  
Youll get through this  
  
The moon strikes one You rest your head  
This refuge oh this refuge  
The sun comes up and life begins  
Theres danger oh theres danger  
Whatd I do if you werent around  
  
Its a fall  
Ive got to tell you  
That this wall was not ment for you  
I see sides all sides all around  
Youll get through youll get through  
  
The human condition needs a hiding place  
This human condition needs a hiding place  
A hiding place  
  
Its a fall  
Ive got to tell you  
That this wall was not meant for you  
I see sides all sides all around  
Youll get through youll get through  
Youll get through through youll get through
