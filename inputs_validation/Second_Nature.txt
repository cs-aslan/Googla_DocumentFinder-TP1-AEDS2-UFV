Second Nature Lyrics  
Something tells me when somethings wrong  
Seems like its been such a long  
Long time since I felt that one  
  
You have your ways and I have my ways  
And like the back of my hand I know it  
And I dont have to try to make you show it  
You dont have to show me how  
  
Cause its second nature to me now  
Somethings taken hold of me somehow  
Cause its second nature to me now  
  
Nobody must explain to me your way of communication  
Give me the time to understand  
I always come around  
I have my ways and you have your ways  
  
And we need no elaboration  
We can just enjoy that sweet sensation
