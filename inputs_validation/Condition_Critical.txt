Oh the tensions mounting  
The pressure starts to show  
All the men in haunting  
Please dont let me go  
  
Dont go  
Try to free my body  
Dont go  
Try to strap me down  
Dont go  
Thesell never break me  
Dont go  
Free wheel to look at me  
  
Condition critical  
Im feeling physical  
Condition critical  
Not really cynical  
  
The bells they are ringing  
Or is it in my head  
My nerves numb understanding  
Im falling out of bed  
  
Dont go  
So call it paranoia  
Dont go  
I dont see it that way  
Lets go  
You say I adore ya  
Hell no  
Were gonna rock they way  
  
Condition critical

Dont feel no pain  
Whats so wrong  
I think Im going out of my head  
Over heels  
I cant feel  
No pain only pleasure  
Get me out  
Take me home  
Cant you see my condition
