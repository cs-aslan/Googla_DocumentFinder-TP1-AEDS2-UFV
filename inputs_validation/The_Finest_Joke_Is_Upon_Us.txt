Mother feeling your hand I  
Believe you and I did then  
And mother release every bad seed  
The geese are leaving the trees  
  
Exposed to winters cold  
They waited too long  
But we too exaggerated  
And I take the cake away  
Its a long song  
And I can play it so  
Give me a pick now collector of bones  
  
Words of smoke  
Distorted never broken  
Paradise is open but I choke  
One of these days when I see through the smoke  
Thatll be the day I get the joke
