Wake up straight caught out by the sun  
On the first day of April  
Out of bed thought there was a plane crash  
But Im sure that I was  
Dreaming  
TV on of course caffeine  
A science of submission again  
Another day on this little island just a bell hangs on  
  
Porridge done I take my kid to school past the pound shop Woolworths  
Under bridge where the subway the daytime and the Westway flies by  
Then on my bike down the Ladbroke Grove to the forthcoming dramas  
A studio and a love of all sweet music we just cant let go  
Let go let go let go let go  
  
So meditate on what weve all become on a cold day in springtime  
Civil war is what were all born into raise your left hand right sing  
Dont capitulate to the forces of the marketplace theyve long departed  
Consolidate the love we have together on a cold day in springtime
