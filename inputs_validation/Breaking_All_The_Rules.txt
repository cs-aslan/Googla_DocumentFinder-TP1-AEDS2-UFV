Well I know  
I could be just another stranger  
But to you  
I guess Im just another fool  
And you swear  
You like to live your life in danger  
Then you hide  
Behind a wall of silly rules  
Nobody thinks the way I do  
I guess that nobody cares  
Your heads so full of things  
So set your mind free of them  
Im breaking the rules  
Did you know  
That in the truth theres nothing stranger  
I suppose  
You think I think I know it all  
Nobody hears the things I say  
I guess that nobody cares  
My heads so full of things  
I set my mind free of them  
Im breaking the rules  
Breakin all the rules  
Cant you see theyre nothing without you  
Empty heads full of fools  
Now you see Im breaking all the rules  
Breakin all the rules  
Well I know  
That you would love to go to Heaven  
But you know  
That youre just too afraid to die  
And I know  
That you would love to know the answers  
But to you  
The truth is just another lie  
Nobody hears the things I say  
I guess that nobody cares  
My heads so full of things  
I set my mind free of them  
Im breaking the rules  
Breakin all the rules  
Cant you see theyre nothing without you  
Empty heads full of fools  
Now you see Im breaking all the rules  
Breakin all the rules  
Breakin all the rules  
Why dont you tell to them  
Breakin all the rules  
Now come on now come on  
Breakin all the rules
