Youve got it made youve got real love  
Something you dont find every day  
Someone to trust someone to lean on  
Something I would hold onto if I were you  
  
Youve got it made youve got no one  
You dont have those strings to tie you down  
You come and go free as the wind blows  
I wouldnt settle down too soon if I were you  
  
If I were you Id be satisfied  
Oh Im sure the grass is greener on the other side  
If I were you Id stay by her side Id be running wild  
I would never leave her  
Thats what I would do  
If I were you  
  
If I were you Id be satisfied  
Oh Im sure the grass is greener on the other side  
If I were you would I rather be would I rather be  
Someone just like me  
I wouldnt change a single thing  
If I were you
