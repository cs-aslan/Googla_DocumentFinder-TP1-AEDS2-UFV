What a day young boy next door passed away  
Oh it makes me want to say  
I dont want to waste another day  
  
Can you and I start mixing gene pools  
Eastern Western people  
Get naughty multilingual  
  
I was sort of like soul searching  
But your bodys so jawdropping  
Our chemistrys groundbreaking  
Dont keep me waiting  
  
Hurry up baby hurry up baby  
Let me give you my love  
Hurry up lets turn this room into a melting pot  
Giddy up baby giddy up baby  
Let me give you my love  
Buckle up boy I know youre gonna like what I got  
  
Maybe its not worth the wait  
Maybe I should walk away  
I dont want to waste my energy  
  
Can you and I stop acting like fools  
Or move on to other people  
Its funny but Id like to settle  
  
I was sort of like soul searching  
But your bodys so jawdropping  
Some say its rule breaking  
But times are changing  
  
Hurry up baby hurry up baby  
Let me give you my love  
Hurry up lets turn this room into a melting pot  
Giddy up baby giddy up baby  
Let me give you my love  
Buckle up boy I know youre gonna like what I got  
  
Let me know if what Im feeling isnt mutual  
All I know is that Im feeling very very hot hot hot  
  
Hurry up baby hurry up baby  
Let me give you my love  
Hurry up lets turn this room into a melting pot  
Giddy up baby giddy up baby  
Let me give you my love  
Buckle up boy I know youre gonna like what I got  
  
Hurry up baby hurry up baby  
Let me give you my love  
Hurry up lets turn this room into a melting pot  
Giddy up baby giddy up baby  
Let me give you my love  
Buckle up boy I know youre gonna like what I got
