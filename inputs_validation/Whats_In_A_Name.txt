openminded educated popular and medicated now and you still wont make it
filled with silent indignation blind with hopeless expectation now and you
still wont make it so youre afraid that they will think ill of you get a
load of me now and if youre scared they couldnt care less of you get over
yourself now its fame and popularity ill never understand if it feels like
this is what you need youll never understand innocence and innuendo
confidence and acquiescence now and you still wont make it selfconsciousness
is not a virtue everyone is looking at you now you may never make it
