Havent heard from you in days  
Im spreading thin what Ive got taped  
And Ive come down from your highest ties  
Now what the hell am I supposed to say  
  
Whoa I know it feels like I let you down  
But Im still around  
  
If you cant find a way to reach me  
Take your time I could be underneath you  
And looking up to see you from where we used to hide  
From where we used to hide  
  
Busy writing thoughts tonight  
A message sent with no reply  
You used to hang on my every word  
Now they never come out right  
  
Whoa I know it feels like I let you down  
But Im still a round  
  
If you cant find a way to reach me  
Take your time I could be underneath you  
And looking up to see you from where we used to hide  
From where we used to hide  
  
You are invisible in this so invisible in this  
Your too caught up in what you missed caught in what you missed  
So spend what I gave I give you more  
You are invisible in this  
  
If you cant find a way to reach me  
Take your time I could be underneath you  
And looking up to see you from where we used to hide  
From where we used to hide  
  
If you cant find a way to reach me  
Take your time cause I am underneath you  
Looking up to see you from where we used to hide  
From where we used to hide
