From time to time they cry  
Only if you know why  
Here they go  
  
A hundred thousand people  
Walking down the streets  
Trying to protect their dream  
Following their feet  
Theyre busy lost  
Cant find anyone  
Theyre looking for a disguise  
And the stars could come  
No more  
No tears  
Just cries and fears  
I dont believe it  
Look at them  
I really cant believe it  
Look at them  
Theyre fucking crazy  
Hey Just ha ha ha ha  
I cant believe it  
Look at them  
All right all right  
All right folks  
This was todays show time  
And now go home  
See you tomorrow  
Same time same place  
Take care
