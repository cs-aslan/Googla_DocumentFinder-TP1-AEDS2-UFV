Paradise can not refuse us  
Never such a happy pair  
  
Everybody must excuse us  
If we walk on air  
  
All the shadows now will lose us  
Lucky stars are everywhere  
  
As a happy being  
Heres what Im foreseeing  
  
For you for me forever more  
Its bound to be forever more  
  
Its plain to see  
We found by finding each other  
The love we waited for  
  
Im yours youre mine  
And in our hearts  
The happy ending starts  
  
What a lovely world  
This world will be  
With a world of love in store  
For you for me forever more  
  
What a lovely world  
This world will be  
With a world of love in store  
For you for me forever more
