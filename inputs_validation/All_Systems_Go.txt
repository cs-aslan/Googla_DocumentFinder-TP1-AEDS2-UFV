If youre ready to fall in love  
Heres the thing youve been dreaming of  
Scientific fact that you should know  
  
If youre ready to give your heart  
And you dont know which way to start  
And youre afraid youll go against the flow  
  
Ask anyone whos ever been given the blow  
If youll know when all systems are go  
  
Chorus  
All systems go ohoohooh  
All systems go oohoohooh  
All systems go all systems go  
All systems go oo oh oo oh  
All systems go all systems go  
All systems go oo oh oo oh  
  
Is your mind in computer mode  
And all your senses in overload  
And all controls for take off in your hands  
  
200000 watts of my love are starting  
To glow  
Let you know that all systems are go  
  
Youre on a one way trip to the sun  
Your hearts on fire and youre ready to run  
Faster now faster were headin out for  
Planet Mars  
Love sudden impact everythings under  
Control  
And all systems are go  
  
Chorus
