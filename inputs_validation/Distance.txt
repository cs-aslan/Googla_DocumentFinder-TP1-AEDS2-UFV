The sun is filling up the room  
And I can hear you dreaming  
Do you feel the way I do right now  
  
I wish we would just give up  
Cause the best part is falling  
Calling anything but love  
  
And I will make sure to keep my distance  
Say I love you when youre not listening  
How long can we keep this up up up  
  
Please dont stand so close to me  
Im having trouble breathing  
Im afraid of what youll see right now  
  
Ill give you everything I am  
All my broken heartbeats  
Until I know youll understand  
  
And I will make sure to keep my distance  
Say I love you when youre not listening  
How long can we keep this up up up  
  
And I keep waiting  
For you to take me  
And you keep waiting  
To save what we had  
  
So Ill make sure to keep my distance  
Say I love you when youre not listening  
How long can we keep this up up up  
  
Make sure to keep my distance  
Say I love you when youre not listening  
How long til we call this love love love
