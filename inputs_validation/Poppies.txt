Hes delighted to love me but you know  
I just dont know what to say to him I just dont know  
  
Heard it on the radio its no good  
Heard it on the radio its news to me  
When she gets something its understood  
Babys got somethin shes not used to  
  
Down down poppy yeah  
Down down poppy yeah  
  
Goin on the corner Im gonna score  
Baby wants somethin shes in the mood to  
Baby wants somethin I want more  
When I dont get it I get blue blue  
  
Down down and its really comin really comin  
Down down poppy yeah  
  
Goin on the corner Im gonna score  
Babys got somethin gonna get through through  
When I want somethin I want more  
Heard it on the radio theres nothin I can do do  
  
Im in the mood to and Im a woman and an individual  
And I want rockin real slow I wanna hear it on the radio  
I wanna hear it I wanna score poppies I wanna hear

On the radio heard it on the radio  
Baby got it but baby want more  
babble  
Heard it on the radio wont be no need for layin in the road  
Tonight Im goin out oh yeah baby got it but baby want more  
She wont need it any more babble  
Although she was tense and lean in the sun splintered like a country  
Gently pulled his finger  
Everything is soakin and spread with butter  
Their flowers on an average on the seed   
  
And then they laid her on the table  
She connected with the inhaler  
And the needle shiftin like crazy  
She was she was completely still  
It was like a painting of a vase  
She just lay there and the gas traveled fast  
Through the dorsal spine and down and around  
I want more  
The anal cavity her cranium  
I wanna score  
Just it was really great man  
The gas had inflicted her entire spine  
With the elements of a voluptuous disease  
With a green vapor made her feet light  
  
Baby want more  
  
Baby was it in the closet  
Baby get it there baby tag it  
Baby got it and baby begged for it baby  
  
I dont think after station theres any station  
I remember when  
Quite as interesting to me  
baby worship something  
As the 12th station  
laughin at the flowers  
I tuned in to the tower too many centuries  
Were calling to me  
And I spin come down thru time  
Oh watch them say youre too high  
  
And I swim through  
  
Hear it on the radio goddamn in my radio  
Hear it on the radio hear it on the radio  
babble  
One long ecstatic pure sensation  
Restriction started excreting started excreting ah exhilarating  
Bottomless pit  
  
Hey sheba hey salome hey venus eclipsin my way ah  
Her vessel every woman is a vessel is evasive is aquatic  
Everyone silver ecstatic platinum disk spinning
