Go go go away with me hm  
Far from his heart and eyes I can love you and youll realize  
That your life holds so much in store  
When you wanted and loved and adored  
Go go go away with me and I know you soon will forget  
His false love thats haunting your memories  
Go and youll never regret  
  
Youre his plaything and nothing more  
He will hurt you hes done it before  
Then youll cry out cry out in vain  
For his heart to go wondering again  
Go go go away with me  
Go go go away with me hm
