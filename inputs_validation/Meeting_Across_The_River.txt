Hey Eddie can you lend me a few bucks  
And tonight can you get us a ride  
Gotta make it through the tunnel  
Got a meeting with a man on the other side  
  
Hey Eddie this guy hes the real thing  
So if you want to come along  
You gotta promise you wont say anything  
Cause this guy dont dance  
And the words been passed this is our last chance  
  
We gotta stay cool tonight Eddie  
Cause man we got ourselves out on that line  
And if we blow this one  
They aint gonna be looking for just me this time  
  
And all we gotta do is hold up our end  
Here stuff this in your pocket  
Itll look like youre carrying a friend  
And remember just dont smile  
Change your shirt cause tonight we got style  
  
Well Cherry says shes gonna walk  
Cause she found out I took her radio and hocked it  
But Eddie man she dont understand  
That two grands practically sitting here in my pocket  
  
And tonights gonna be everything that I said  
And when I walk through that door  
Im just gonna throw that money on the bed  
Shell see this time I wasnt just talking  
Then Im gonna go out walking  
  
Hey Eddie can you catch us a ride
