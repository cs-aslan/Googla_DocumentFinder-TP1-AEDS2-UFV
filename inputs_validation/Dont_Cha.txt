I know you like me  
I know you do  
Thats why when I come around  
Shes all over you  
And I know you want me too  
Its easy to see  
And in the back of your mind  
You know you should be on with me  
Dont cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me  
Dont cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me  
Dont cha  
Dont cha baby Dont cha  
Dont cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me  
Dont cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me  
Dont cha  
Dont cha baby Dont cha  
Fight the feeling  
Leave it alone  
Cause if it aint love  
It just aint enough to leave my happy home  
Lets keep it friendly  
You have to play fair  
See I dont care but I know  
She aint gonna wanna share  
Dont cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me  
Dont cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me  
Dont cha baby Dont Cha  
Dont cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me  
Dont cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me  
Dont cha  
Dont cha baby Dont cha  
I know she loves you  
I understand  
Id probably be just as crazy about you  
If you were my own man  
Maybe next lifetime  
Possibly  
Until then old friend  
Lets just see if you can hang with me  
Dont cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me  
Dont cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me  
Dont cha  
Dont cha baby Dont Cha  
Dont cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me  
Dont cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me  
Dont cha  
Dont cha baby Dont Cha
