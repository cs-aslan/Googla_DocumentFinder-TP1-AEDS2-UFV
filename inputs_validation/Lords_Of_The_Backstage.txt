A love song with no validity  
Pretend you never meant that much to me  
Numb a Valium child bored by meaningless collisions  
A lonely stretch of headlight diamonds trapped in black ice  
A mirror cracked among the white lines  
  
I just wanted you to be the first one  
I just wanted you to be the first one  
Ashes are burning burning  
Ashes are burning burning  
  
A lifestyle with no simplicities  
But Im not asking for your sympathy  
Talk we never could talk distanced by all that was between us  
A lord of the backstage a creature of language  
Im so far out and Im too far in  
  
I just wanted you to be the first one  
I just wanted you to be the first one  
Bridges are burning burning  
Bridges are burning burning  
Now now now now
