I feel my spirit fly  
Only after dark  ahh  
I kiss the world goodbye  
Only after dark  ahh  
  
Fight with the city lights  
Only after dark  ahh  
Run Id like to run away  
Only after dark  ahh  
  
Wont you disappear into midnight with me  
Why dont you come why dont you come why dont you fly fly fly with  
Sweet elusive fate will be our company  
  
Bring out the vamp in me  
Only after dark  ahh  
Moon sinful as can be  
Only after dark  ahh  
  
Its wrong to feel so free   
Only after dark  ahh  
Only you know it can be  
Only after dark  ahh  
  
Wont you disappear into midnight with me  
Why dont you come why dont you come why dont you fly fly fly with  
Sweet elusive in fade  will be our company
