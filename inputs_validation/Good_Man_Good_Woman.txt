Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey  
Midnight Im wound up tight  
Slowly comin down in the daytime  
I been lyin low from work hangin over from the hurt from you babe  
But Im gonna suffer through the strain till I get a  
Better thing with you Darlin me and you  
So far to see ahead  
When I cant seem to drag myself out of bed  
Gotta find me a good man a good man a good manYeah  
You better stop think about what youre saying  
I was seriously dedicated in the game of playin  
You made ten thousand promises you couldnt keep  
I forgave you when you lied pleaded and weeped  
Put up with your disrespect and neglect  
What an experience Ill never forget  
Till now everything I did was wrong Im sorry baby  
Today youre free but we live alone  
Gotta find me a good womanGood womanGood womanYeah  
It was twelve oclock in the midnight hour  
I heard the door slam and then the shower  
When I got up you were already gone  
I slipped and fell from the water you left on  
Gotta find a good woman  
Gotta find a good man  
Gotta find a good woman  
Gotta find a good man
