One bright and guiding light  
That taught me wrong from right  
I found in my mothers eyes  
  
Those baby tales she told  
Of pathways paved with gold  
I found in my mothers eyes  
  
Just like a wandering sparrow a lonely soul  
Id walk the straight and narrow till I reach my goal  
  
Gods gift sent from above  
One true unselfish love  
I found in my mothers eyes  
I found in my mothers eyes  
  
Just like a wandering sparrow a lonely soul  
Id walk the straight and narrow till I reach my goal  
  
Gods gift sent from above  
One true unselfish love  
I found in my mothers eyes  
I found in my mothers eye
