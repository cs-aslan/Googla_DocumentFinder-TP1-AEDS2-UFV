The prettiest thing  
I ever did see  
Was lightning from the top of a cloud  
Moving through the dark a million miles an hour  
With somewhere to be  
  
So why does it seem  
Like a picture  
Hanging up on someone elses wall  
Lately I just havent been myself at all  
Its heavy on my mind  
  
Im dreamin again  
Like Ive always been  
And way down low  
I know  
  
The prettiest thing  
I ever did see  
Was dusty as the handle on the door  
Rusty as a nail stuck in the old pine floor  
Looks like home to me  
  
Im dreamin again  
Like Ive always been  
And way down low  
Im thinkin of the prettiest thing
