Verse 1  
I confess I am lost  
In the age of the social  
On our knees take a test  
To be lovin and grateful  
  
PreChorus  
Shots were fired on the street  
By the church where we used to meet  
Angel down angel down  
But the people just stood around  
Chorus  
Im a believer its a trial  
Foolish and weaker oh oh oh  
Id rather save an angel down  
Im a believer its chaos  
Where are our leaders Oh oh oh  
Id rather save an angel down  
  
Verse 2  
Doesnt everyone belong  
In the arms of the sacred  
Why do we pretend were wrong  
Has our young courage faded  
  
PreChorus  
Shots were fired on the street  
By the church where we used to meet  
Angel down angel down  
Why do people just stand around  
  
Chorus  
Im a believer its a trial  
Foolish and weaker oh oh oh  
Id rather save an angel down  
Im a believer its chaos  
Where are our leaders Oh oh oh  
Id rather save an angel down

Who who who who who  
Who who who who who
