Hey wait a minute  
Youre a little lost  
Things keep on changing  
And so does the cost  
Of doin business with yourself  
Dont want nobody else no  
  
I wont take no for an answer  
I wont take no from you  
I wont take no for an answer  
I wont take no no no no  
  
Hey mister sister  
Leave me alone  
Today kids dont grow up  
They just grow alone  
Guess you know how bad I felt  
When you were with somebody else oh  
  
I wont take no for an answer  
I wont take no from you  
I wont take no for an answer  
I wont take no no no no  
  
Hey  
You  
Hey hey you  
  
I wont take no for an answer  
I wont take no from you  
I wont take no for an answer  
I wont no  
I wont no for an answer  
  
I wont no for an answer
