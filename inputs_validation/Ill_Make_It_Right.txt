Oh no no no no no oh baby  
  
Chorus  
Ill make it right  
Baby you know that I can make it right  
  
Keep it on a cutie girl cause Im really into you yeah  
Tell me is there a way that i can spend some time with you  
So much I want to know about you  
Seems like I cant do without you  
You really turn me on you got it goin on  
Anything you ask ill do for you  
So baby dont you see  
You mean the world to me  
Just one thing I have to know  
Baby can I make it right  
  
Chorus  
  
As Im looking into your eyes all I see is you lovely face  
And theres nothin I like more than to show you I adore  
The simple things that you do to me with the sweet little  
Things you say  
Baby when I kiss your lips it really brightens up my day  
Oh Oh Oh  
Anything you ask Ill do for you  
You mean the world to me  
Just one thing I have to know  
Baby can I make it right  
  
Chorus  
  
So baby dont you see you mean the world to me  
If you just swing my way  
Ill make it right  
So tell me where do we go from here  
Oh yeah  
  
Theres nowhere that we can go  
But take it nice and slow  
Baby enjoy the flow  
Lots of pleasures I can give  
Ive got it waitin here  
So put away your fears  
  
Chorus
