If you ever found anything better than working  
Youd want to do it again  
Like flying a plane or nude body surfing  
Youd want to do it again  
That Casanova he had it right  
Hed just do it again  
Hed do it again all day and all night  
Then hed do it again  
  
You gonna drink too much say never no more  
But youre gonna do it again  
Trust me Im a doctor I know for sure  
Youre gonna do it again  
  
Do it again do it again  
If you all like it do it again  
Do it again do it again  
If it hits you right just do it again  
  
Me I get time off I twiddle my thumbs  
cause I want to do it again  
I get a rush every night when 845 comes  
Cant wait to do it again  
There is a price to pay it aint cheap  
If you want to do it again  
But I sold my soul yeah Im in deep  
Might as well do it again  
  
Life is short never complain  
You could be hit by a truck fall under a train  
Enjoying yourself is the name of the game  
Gotta go back tonight and do it again  
  
Do it again do it again  
If you all like it do it again  
Do it again do it again  
If it hits you right just do it again  
  
That Mona Lisa now she could smile  
And do it again  
Shed sit and grin for quite a while  
Then shed do it again  
You is here then you aint that was never in doubt  
Better do it again  
Dont take no Einstein to work it out  
So do it again  
  
Do it again do it again  
If you all like it do it again  
Do it again do it again  
If it hits you right just do it again  
Do it again do it again  
If you all like it do it again  
Do it again do it again  
If it hits you right just do it again
