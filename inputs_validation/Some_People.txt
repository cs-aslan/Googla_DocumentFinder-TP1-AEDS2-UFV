Isnt a gamble laying your heart out on the floor  
Nothin short of miracle when you find the one youre lookin for  
Yeah its another kind of trouble trying to hang on to who you are  
When all you want to do is lose yourself in someone elses arms  
Isnt a wonder that we got this far  
  
Some people arent lucky like us  
Some people they just give up  
And when the hard times fall and the thrill of it all is gone  
They leave it in a cloud of dust  
Its sad to think that some wont find it  
And others wouldnt recognize it even when it comes  
Were all at the mercy of the will of love  
And some people yeah  
Some people arent lucky like us  
  
Two lonely souls that just stumbled into fate  
Look how much weve been given baby in spite of all of our mistakes  
I will never forget Im been blessed with the gift of lovin you  
And when the goin aint easy baby  
A little faith will pull us through  
Thank god we have each other we can hang on to  
  
Some people arent lucky like us  
Some people they just give up  
And when the hard times fall and the thrill of it all is gone  
They leave you in a cloud of dust  
Its sad to think that some wont find it  
And others wouldnt recognize it even when it comes  
Were all at the mercy of the will of love  
And some people yeah  
Some people arent lucky like us  
  
To have someone you can laugh with someone you can cry with  
Tell all your secrets to  
To have someone who wont judge you someone who just loves you  
No matter what they stand beside you  
  
Some people arent lucky like us  
Some people they just give up  
And when the hard times fall and the thrill of it all is gone  
They leave you in a cloud of dust  
Its sad to think that some wont find it  
And they wont recognize it even when it comes  
Were all at the mercy of the will of love  
And some people yeah  
Some people arent lucky like us
