Mother doesnt know where love has gone  
She says it must be youth  
That keeps us feeeling strong  
See it in her face thats turned to ice  
And when she smiles she shows  
The lines of sacrifice  
And now I know what theyre saying  
When the sun begins to fade  
And we made our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades  
Father made my history  
He fought for what he thought  
Would set us somehow free  
He tought me what to say in school  
I learned off by heart  
But now thats torn in two  
And now I know what theyre saying  
In the music of the parade  
We made our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades  
Born on different sides of life  
We feel the same  
And feel all of this strife  
So come to me when Im asleep  
Well cross the line  
And dance upon the street  
And now I know what theyre saying  
When the drums begin to fade  
We made our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades  
Oh turn around and Ill be there  
Theres a scar through my heart  
But Ill bare it again  
I thought we were the human race  
But we were just another borderlinecase  
And the stars reach down and tell us  
That theres always one escape  
I dont know where love has gone  
And in this trouble land  
Desperation keep us strong  
Fridays child is full of soul  
With nothing left to lose  
Theres everything to go  
And now I know what theyre are saying  
Its a terrible beauty weve made  
So we make our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades  
Now I know what theyre are saying  
As hearts go to their graves  
We made our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades
