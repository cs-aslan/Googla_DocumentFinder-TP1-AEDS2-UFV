Having a problem turn on the TV  
Got too much money give it to me  
Ill say what you wanna hear  
Do what you think I should  
Cause Im on your side  
Dont be misunderstood  
Will I retain my sanity  
Or tumble into vanity  
Effect all of Humanity  
You will pay  
Reach out for something escape reality  
Insane suicide pay the penalty  
Dont see whats the final move  
On how to play the game  
Dont think youll end up like them  
Dont think that youre the same  
Will I retain  
Murder you justify so your hands are clean  
Carry out the task you set  
Homage to the green  
Taking life without a care  
Sadist of a kind  
Making you into a man  
A man without a mind  
Will I retain  
Do I control my destiny  
Or theres a higher authority  
That commits atrocity  
I fear for humanity
