All these empty places  
I try so hard to fill  
Will I find another love  
I pray to God I will  
Girl we had some good times  
But time does not stand still  
Its rolling like a rockslide down a hill  
  
Ive met someone I care for  
I know she cares for me  
Will I fall in love again  
Its a possibility  
Girl we had some good times  
That time cannot undo  
No one will ever take the place of you  
  
Heart jinxed condition  
Never sure how I feel  
Trying to separate the real thing  
From the wishful thinking  
Sometimes I wonder  
If Ill make it without you  
Im determined to  
Ill make my stand  
And if after all is said and done  
You only find one special one  
Then Ive thrown down diamonds in the sand  
Then Ive thrown down diamonds in the sand  
Then Ive thrown down diamonds in the sand  
Then Ive thrown down diamonds in the sand  
  
Remember when we used to watch the sun set in the sea  
You said youd always be in love with me  
All through the night we danced and sang  
Made love in the morning while the church bells rang  
  
Leave the fire behind you and start  
Ill be playing it by ear  
Left here with an emptyhanded heart
