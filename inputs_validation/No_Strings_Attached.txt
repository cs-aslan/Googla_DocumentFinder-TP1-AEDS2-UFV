Baby youre not the only one  
I see the things he does to you  
All the pain that he puts you through  
If I see whats really going on  
Staying out at night  
While youre by the phone  
  
Take it from me  
Its a lesson to be learned  
Even the good guys get burned  
Take it from me  
See I would give you love  
The kind of love that youve only dreamed of

That a girl like you needs that a girl like you needs  
cause he always looks around  
His eyes wander around  
He doesnt see you like I see
