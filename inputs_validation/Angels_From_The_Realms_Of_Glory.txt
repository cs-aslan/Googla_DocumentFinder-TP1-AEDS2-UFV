Angels from the realms of glory  
Wing your flight oer all the earth  
Ye who sang creations story  
Now proclaim Messiahs birth  
  
Come and worship come and worship  
Worship Christ the newborn King  
  
Shepherds in the field abiding  
Watching oer your flocks by night  
God with man is now residing  
Yonder shines the infant Light  
  
Come and worship come and worship  
Worship Christ the newborn King  
  
Sages leave your contemplations  
Brighter visions beam afar  
Seek the great Desire of nations  
Ye have seen his natal star  
  
Come and worship come and worship  
Worship Christ the newborn King  
  
Saints before the altar bending  
Watching long in hope and fear  
Suddenly the Lord descending  
In his temple shall appear  
  
Come and worship come and worship  
Worship Christ the newborn King  
  
Though an infant now we view him  
He shall fill his Fathers throne  
Gather all nations to him  
Every knee shall then bow down  
  
Come and worship come and worship  
Worship Christ the newborn King
