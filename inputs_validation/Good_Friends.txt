Feeling one anothers joy and sorrow  
Dreams today may come true tomorrow  
Good friends  
Close together like theyre bookends  
Feeling what the other one is feeling  
They never seem to be without  
Those little things to laugh about  
  
Good friends  
They have the kind of love  
That only deepens  
Its something that you rarely find worth keeping  
Oh people even new ones come  
Youre lucky if you find just one good friend  
  
And we say goodbye  
Knowing what we have will fade away  
Well meet another time  
Another day  
My friend  
  
Good friends  
Their paths may never come together again  
But in their hearts  
Theyre on a road with no end  
Where life will take us who can tell  
Guess its time to say farewell  
My friend  
  
Good friends  
You never will forget  
Your good friends
