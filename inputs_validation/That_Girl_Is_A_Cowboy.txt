It was a hundred and seven  
We were heading to town  
She had her sleeves rolled up  
And the windows rolled down  
That girl is a cowboy  
Robert Earl was singing out  
The Buckin Song  
With every word that Keen was bringing  
She was singing along  
That girl is a cowboy  
  
chorus  
Sometimes the best cowboys  
Aint cowboys at all  
Shes got my back  
Even when its against the wall  
When I need a friend  
Shes the guy I call  
Cause sometimes the best cowboys  
Aint cowboys at all  
  
So I took her out to show her  
How to rope and ride  
I cant believe that it was me  
That wound up broke and tied  
That girl is a cowboy  
  
So that night I decided  
We should paint the town  
I made it home although  
I really dont remember how  
That girl is a cowboy  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Theres just something that a cowgirl has  
Aint no cowboys got  
Man shes something when shes one of the boys  
But something else  
Any time shes not  
  
Repeat Chorus
