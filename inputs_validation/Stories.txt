How can I climb inside you  
The way that youre climbing inside me  
How could I ever deny you  
The way that you never deny me  
How can I climb inside you  
Touching the parts that people really see  
How can I open and find you  
And feel you the way that you want me to feel  
  
I want you to know what Im thinking of  
I want you to read my mind before I write it  
I want you to know that I have stories to tell  
I wanna tell you a little bit more  
  
How do I get to align with you  
Lets tell our times and well see  
If we can piece together something  
Or something else that will be  
  
Cant believe that youre less  
Im still not against your will  
A change that you really want too  
If I pour it all out  
Will you still have no doubt  
Theres a reason or two that you are too  
  
I want you to know what Im thinking of  
I want you to read my mind before I write it  
I want you to know that I have stories to tell  
I wanna tell you a little bit more
