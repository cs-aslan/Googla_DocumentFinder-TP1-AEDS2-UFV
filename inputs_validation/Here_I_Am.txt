Why is it that u can see the worst in me  
I swear sometimes it feels like it natures me  
But to keep it all real is kinda hurtin me  
I could say Im done with it but it lurks in me  
So Im a just tell myself that it works for me  
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes  
And I might pop a couple of them percaces  
Yeah thatll make me transform to Hercules  
  
Chorus  
Here I am here I am so tell me cause I am  
Here I am here I am so tell me cause I am  
Here I am here I am so tell me cause I am  
  
I love who I am I love whoa  
  
I swear to God man everything in life is old  
And the only thing that change is the price of gold  
Even in the afterlife Im a fight your soul  
Cause the second time around Ill be twice as bold  
So do you take me to be who I am  
To have and to hold till death do us part  
Cause if not its just best we both part  
Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start  
You got me thinkin twice to just breathe  
Then you say I wont survive if I leave  
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve  
I no longer need your attention at ease  
  
Its a joke its a game  
Why am I still keeping score  
Im in pain Im ashamed  
Im a woman hear me roar  
  
Its a joke its a game  
Why am I still keeping score  
Im in pain Im ashamed  
Im a woman hear me roar  
  
Now its a joke its a game  
Why am I still keeping score  
Im in pain Im ashamed  
Im a woman hear me roar  
  
Its a joke its a game  
Why am I still keeping score  
Im in pain Im ashamed  
Im a woman hear me roar  
  
Here I am here I am so take me as I am
