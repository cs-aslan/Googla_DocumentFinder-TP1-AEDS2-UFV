Time is going by so much faster than I  
And Im starting to regret not spending all of it with you  
Now Im wondering why Ive kept this bottled inside  
So Im starting to regret not telling all of it to you  
So if I havent yet Ive gotta let you know  
  
Youre never gonna be alone  
From this moment on if you ever feel like letting go  
I wont let you fall  
Youre never gonna be alone  
Ill hold you till the hurt is gone  
  
And now as long as I can Im holding on with both hands  
Cause forever I believe that theres nothing I could need but you  
So if I havent yet Ive gotta let you know  
  
Chorus  
Youre never gonna be alone  
From this moment on if you ever feel like letting go  
I wont let you fall  
When all hope is gone  
I know that you can carry on  
Were gonna take the world on  
Ill hold you till the hurt is gone  
  
Oh  
Youve gotta live every single day  
Like its the only one what if tomorrow never comes  
Dont let it slip away  
Could be our only one you know its only just begun  
Every single day  
May be our only one what if tomorrow never comes  
Tomorrow never comes  
  
Time is going by so much faster than I  
And Im starting to regret not telling all of this to you  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gonna be there all the way  
I wont be missing one more day  
Im gonna be there always  
I wont be missing one more day
