Are there years between us  
Have you seen me when I didnt see you  
Its so good to know that someone can  
Love me as much as I think you do  
Do I love you  
Your a fool if you dont know  
Or maybe Im so good at hiding  
Even the truth is hidden from you  
But somehow I doubt that your  
As smart as I could ever be  
But still my question remains  
Is our love meant to be  
Cause it feels too good to be true  
Can someone love me so much more than I love myself  
Is this all true  
Does love resonate in your heart  
Like the songs say it does  
I cant even begin to believe my dreams  
When they actually come true
