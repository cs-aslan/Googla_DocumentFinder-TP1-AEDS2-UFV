Honey love ya honey little honey bunny Sunday mornin  
Love ya more funny love in the skyline baby  
Ice cream scuse me I seen ya looking good the other evenin  
Oh you dig it had to smile just an hour  
So if were in love like I think well be  
It aint a long rhyme it took ages to think  
I think Ill hurl it in the water baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Thinkin you are a nice little one  
To put it all around you its just good  
I like it  
I like it  
Hey Hey Hey suppose sometime that day  
You wont be swingin along over across to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Good time rocker woman  
Well stray our pieces  
Little creepy we shine so sleepy so whoopie  
Thats how you look
