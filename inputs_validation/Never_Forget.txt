Come on baby could you ever be  
Just a little close to me  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Could we ever forget tonight  
Come on baby lets take a stroll  
Youre feelin warm so dont be cold  
Ooh ooh oh  
Well never forget tonight  
What a wonderful night to be  
The stars must be my friends  
To shine for me  
Come on baby now dont you be cold  
Just remember that love is gold  
Ooh ooh  
We will never forget tonight
