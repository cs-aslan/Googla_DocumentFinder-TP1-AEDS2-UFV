Take all your goodness and shiness away  
Ill tell you the things Ive been longing to say  
Ill break it to you just so you understand  
The force and control that you hold in your hands  
  
Make me the beat of your heart  
Then fall into mine  
One step at a time  
You have no reason for doubting your feelings  
Love isnt always the same  
  
You are loved

Live for the moment according to you  
And so when the time comes you know what to do  
Trust me Im giving no secret away  
Im drowning in you but I want it that way  
  
Make me the beat of your heart  
Then fall into mine  
One step at a time  
You have no reason for doubting your feelings  
Love isnt always the same
