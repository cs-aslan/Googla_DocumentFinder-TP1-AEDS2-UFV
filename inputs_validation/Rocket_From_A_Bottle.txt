Birds beware expect me up there  
Me and air are feeling light today  
Jets should hide Ill fly alongside  
Me and pride are bolted tight today  
  
Ive been set off by a pretty little girl  
  
Im like a rocket from a bottle shot free  
Ive been just explosive since you lit me  
Ive been up with the larks  
Ive been shooting off sparks  
  
And Im feeling in love  
  
Im a rocket from a bottle shot free  
Ive been just explosive since you kissed me  
Ive been up in the clouds  
Ive been shrugging off shrouds  
  
And Im feeling in love  
  
Hate step back my smile might just crack  
Cant stop grins from going wide today  
Hell look sharp angels play your harp  
I feel strong like the tide today
