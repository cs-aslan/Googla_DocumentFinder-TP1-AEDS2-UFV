Will you risk your reputation  
I dont know  
You just dont know  
What youre saying  
Anymore  
You know beggars  
Cant be choosers  
And its fair  
We may win we may be losers  
I dont care no no no  
  
Oh baby I just cant stand  
Another lonely night  
So come on over and save me  
Save me from another lonely night  
  
I hear every word youre saying  
Theyre all lies  
But with every breath youre taking  
Youre thinking of  
Ways to say goodnight  
  
Baby I just cant stand  
Another lonely night  
So come on over and save me  
Save me from another lonely night  
Come on over  
Come and save me
