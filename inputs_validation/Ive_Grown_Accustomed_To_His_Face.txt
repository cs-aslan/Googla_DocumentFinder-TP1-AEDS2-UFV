Ive grown accustomed to his face  
He almost makes the day begin  
Ive grown accustomed  
To the tune that he whistles night and noon  
  
His smiles his frowns  
His ups his downs  
Are second nature to me now  
Like breathing out and breathing in  
  
I was serenely independent  
And content before we met  
Surely I could always be that way again  
And yet Ive grown accustomed to his look  
  
Accustomed to his voice  
Accustomed to his face  
Im so used to hearing him say  
Good morning every day  
  
His joys his woes  
His highs his lows  
Are second nature to me now  
Like breathing out and breathing in  
  
Im very grateful hes a man and so easy to forget  
Rather like a habit one can always break  
And yet Ive grown accustomed  
To the trace of something in the air  
  
Accustomed to his face
