you need more you need more you need more  
You need moreyou need moreyou need more  
You need moreyou need moreyou need more  
  
Boy its tough getting on in the world  
When the sun doesnt shine and a boy needs a girl  
Its about getting out of a rut you need luck  
And your stuck and dont know how oh  
  
dont have to be A big bucks Hollywood star  
dont have to driveA super car to get far  
dont have to liveA life of power and wealth  
dont have to be beautiful but it helps  
dont have to buyA house in Beverly hills  
dont have to haveyour daddy paying the bills  
dont have to liveA life of power and wealth  
dont have to be beautiful but it helps  
  
You need more than a big blank check to be a loveror  
A gulf stream jet to fly you door to door  
Somewhere chic on another shore  
You need more you need more you need more you need more you need more you need
more  
You need love you need love you need love  
Too much of anything is never enough  
Too much of everything is never enough  
  
Boy its tough getting on in the world  
When the sun doesnt shine and a boy needs a girl  
Its about getting out of a rut you need luck  
And your stuck and dont know how oh  
  
dont have to be A big bucks Hollywood star  
dont have to driveA super car to get far  
dont have to wearA smile much colder than ice  
dont have to be beautiful but its nice  
  
You need more than Gerhard Richter hangin on your wall  
A chauffeurdriven limousine on call  
To drive your wife and lover to a white tie ball  
  
you need more you need more you need more  
You need moreyou need moreyou need more you need love  
I believe that we can achieve the love that we need  
I believe call me naive  
Love is for free  
  
dont have to be A big bucks Hollywood star  
dont have to driveA super car to get far  
dont have to liveA life of power and wealth  
dont have to be beautiful but it helps  
Beautiful that it helps  
Beautiful that it helps
