Im lost in your eyes  
Reaching out to cross the great divide  
You are drifting away  
Mind and soul and body day by day  
  
Nothings stopping you and I  
Its do or die tonight  
  
So tell me why Im alone  
When were lying here together  
On a night thats so cold  
And youre just a touch away  
Baby try to hold on  
Till we make it to forever  
Were alive  
And the future never dies  
  
Ive been dying inside  
Holding back the tears I never cried  
Now Im down on my knees  
Cause everything you are is what I need  
  
Youre the meaning of it all  
Dont let me fall youve gotta  
  
Tell me why Im alone  
When were lying here together  
On a night thats so cold  
And youre just a touch away  
Baby try to hold on  
Till we make it to forever  
Were alive  
And the future never dies  
Were alive  
And the future never dies  
  
Weve got to come together  
Cause everybody needs a heart to hold  
Cant you see its now or never  
Cause weve got nowhere else to go  
  
Tell me why Im alone  
When were lying here together  
  
Baby try to hold on  
Till we make it to forever  
Were alive  
And the future never dies  
Were alive  
And the future never dies  
In your eyes  
The future never dies
