I got my head but my head is unraveling  
Cant keep control cant keep track of where its traveling  
I got my heart but my hearts no good  
Youre the only one thats understood  
I come along but I dont know where youre taking me  
I shouldnt go but you reaching back and shaking me  
Turn off the sun pull the stars from the sky  
The more I give to you the more I die  
And I want you  
You are the perfect drug the perfect drug  
The perfect drug the perfect drug  
You make me hard when Im all soft inside  
I see the truth when Im all stupideyed  
The arrow goes straight through my heart  
Without you everything just falls apart  
My blood just wants to say hello to you  
My soul is so afraid to realize  
How every little bit is left of me  
And I want you  
You are the perfect drug the perfect drug the perfect drug  
Take me with you  
Without you everything just falls apart  
Its not as much fun to pick up the pieces
