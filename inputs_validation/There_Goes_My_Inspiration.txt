They say pain can bring out the artists best  
But since youve been gone I just cant care less  
Common sense doesnt realize  
It can hurt so bad  
Everyday I sit in my garret staring at the floor  
But my heart isnt in it anymore  
  
There goes my inspiration  
My reason for creation  
There goes my inspiration  
I felt it fly away when you said goodbye  
  
Me and Gaugin used to party down  
I was hung in the Louvre I was Renoirs pal  
Vincent Van Gogh used to joke with me  
Now they dont come round  
Its all over town that the masters lost his touch  
Im so lost I can hardly hold a brush  
  
There goes my inspiration  
My reason for creation  
There goes my inspiration  
I felt it fly away when you said goodbye  
  
And now my palette is a sorry mix of grey and brown  
And all the other art lovers stay away cause Im bringing them down  
  
Now I wander the Left Bank every day  
Searching for my muse in a sad cafe  
Peddle my oils to the galleries  
But they turn me down  
Everybody says Im a master of technique  
But the style and the sentiment is weak  
  
There goes my inspiration  
My reason for creation  
There goes my inspiration  
I felt it fly away when you said goodbye  
  
There goes my inspiration  
My reason for creation  
There goes my inspiration  
I felt it fly away when you said goodbye
