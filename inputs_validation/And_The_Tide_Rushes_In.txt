Ive been searching for my dream  
A hundred times today  
I build them up you knock them down  
Like they were made of clay  
  
Then the tide rushes in  
And washes my castles away  
Then Im really not so sure  
When side of the bed I should lay  
I should lay  
  
You keep looking for someone  
To tell your troubles to  
Ill sit down and lend an ear  
Yet I hear nothing new  
  
Then the tide rushes in  
And washes my castles away  
Then Im really not so sure  
When side of the bed I should lay  
I should lay  
  
Blackbird sitting in a tree  
Observing whats below  
Acorns falling to the ground  
Hell stay and watch them grow
