Maybe your heart is aching  
I wouldnt know now would I  
Maybe your spirits breaking up  
I shouldnt care now should I  
Maybe youre thinking of me  
Well I dont know now do I  
If you only knew how I feel  
Wish I could die now dont I  
  
Im just another crazy guy  
Playing at love was another high  
Just another high  
Couldnt believe in my eyes  
You drifted into my life  
But marriages made in heaven  
Can they survive in this life  
Surely it came as no surprise  
Love was too hot to handle  
Well I really blew my cool and you  
You just blew out the candle  
Didnt you just try just another high  
Didnt you sign as you waved goodbye  
  
Just another high  
Im just another crazy guy  
Playing at love was another high  
Such a crazy high  
Lately it seems so empty here  
But I suppose Im alright  
Maybe tomorrows not so clear  
Still I remember that night  
Singing to you like this is  
My only way to reach you  
Though Im too proud to say it  
Oh how I long too see you  
Shattered by dreams by your goodbye  
As shattered my goodbye as filled the sky  
  
Desolate am I  
Just another crazy guy  
Playing at love was another high  
Such a crazy high  
Maybe I should start anew  
And maybe I should find someone who  
Will maybe love me like I love you  
Maybe Im too stuck on you  
Maybe I got stuck on you
