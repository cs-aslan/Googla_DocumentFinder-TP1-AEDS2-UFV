When the night shows  
The signals grow on radios  
All the strange things  
They come and go as early warnings  
Stranded starfish have no place to hide  
Still waiting for the swollen Easter tide  
Theres no point in direction we cannot  
Even choose a side  
  
I took the old track  
The hollow shoulder across the waters  
On the tall cliffs  
They were getting older sons and daughters  
The jaded underworld was riding high  
Waves of steel hurled metal at the sky  
And as the nail sunk in the cloud the rain  
Was warm and soaked the crowd  
  
Lord here comes the flood  
Well say goodbye to flesh and blood  
If again the seas are silent  
In any still alive  
Itll be those who gave their island to survive  
Drink up dreamers youre running dry  
  
When the flood calls  
You have no home you have no walls  
In the thunder crash  
Youre a thousand minds within a flash  
Dont be afraid to cry at what you see  
The actors gone theres only you and me  
And if we break before the dawn theyll  
Use up what we used to be  
  
Lord here comes the flood  
Well say goodbye to flesh and blood  
If again the seas are silent  
In any still alive  
Itll be those who gave their island to survive  
Drink up dreamers youre running dry
