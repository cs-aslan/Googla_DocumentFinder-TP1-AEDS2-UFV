She used to be someone you could depend on  
To brighten up your coldest winter day  
But the one she leaned upon  
Let her down now has moved on  
  
And morning brings another empty day  
Now shes only a broken down angel  
Shes only a bird thats broke her wing  
Shes only someone someone whos gone wrong  
Shes only a child thats lost her way  
  
She used to be a girl of simple pleasures  
A breath of spring to chase your blues away  
But now she bears a cross for a love that she has lost  
No sunshine in her life just clouds of gray  
  
Now shes only a broken down angel  
Shes only a bird thats broke her wing  
Shes only someone someone whos gone wrong  
Shes only a child thats lost her way  
  
Shes only a broken down angel  
Shes only a bird thats broke her wing  
Shes only someone someone whos gone wrong  
Shes only a child thats lost her way  
  
Now shes only a broken down angel  
Shes only a bird thats broke her wing  
Shes only someone someone whos gone wrong  
Shes only a child thats lost her way
