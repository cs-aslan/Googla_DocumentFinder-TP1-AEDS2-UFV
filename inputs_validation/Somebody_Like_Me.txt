Tired of naggin nothins ever happenin  
Thats the attitude that isnt fun  
A bottle of wine a tube of glue  
I dont know what to do  
  
I am just a guy who likes to rock and roll  
I am just a guy who likes to get drunk  
I am just a guy who likes to dress punk  
Get my kicks an live up my life  
  
Tired of complaints I am ready for fun  
But Ill make friends with anyone  
Are you out there somebody like me  
If you are I hope that you can see  
  
I am just a guy who likes to rock and roll  
I am just a guy who likes to get drunk  
I am just a guy who likes to dress punk  
Get my kicks an live up my life  
  
Dont go to school dont make me laugh  
Cant hardly spell cant do math  
In the bar or out on the street  
At the concert at the boutique
