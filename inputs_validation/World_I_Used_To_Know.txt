Some day in some old familiar rain will come along and know my name  
And then my shelter will be gone and Ill have to move along  
But till I do Ill stay awhile and track the hidden country of your smile  
Some day the man I used to be will come along and call on me  
And then because Im just a man youll find my feet are made of sand  
But till that time Ill tell you lies and chart the hidden boundrys of your
eyes  
Some day the world I used to know will come along and lead me go  
Then Ill be leaving you behind for love is just a state of mind  
But till that day Ill be your man and love away your troubles if I can  
And till that day Ill be your man and love away your troubles if I can
