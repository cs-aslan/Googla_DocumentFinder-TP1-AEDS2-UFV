Hellhound hot leather on your legs  
That smokin powder keg  
Youre riding on is hellbound  
And youre the one they claim  
Its going down in flames  
Youre riding Hades rails Hellion  
  
Hellion  
The Devils Hellion child  
Hellion  
Will never have to die  
  
Well child youre sweatin and youre stoned  
That alcohol you downed  
Makes you crazy All night you damn the hurt and pain  
And drink the devils rain  
Its screaming out your name  
  
Hellion  
The Devils Hellion child  
Hellion  
Will never have to die  
The Gods you worship are steel  
At the altar of rock n roll you kneel  
A slave who forever rocks  
Is chained in the devils locks  
And slain by the bloody axe I wail  
  
Hellion  
The Devils Hellion child  
Hellion  
Will never have to die
