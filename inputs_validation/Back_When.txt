Dont you remember  
The fizz in a pepper  
Peanuts in a bottle  
At ten two and four  
A fried bologna sandwich  
With mayo and tomato  
Sittin round the table  
Dont happen much anymore  
  
We got too complicated  
Its all way overrated  
I like the old and outdated  
Way of life  
  
Back when a hoe was a hoe  
Coke was a coke  
And cracks what you were doing  
When you were cracking jokes  
Back when a screw was a screw  
The wind was all that blew  
And when you said Im down with that  
Well it meant you had the flu  
I miss back when  
I miss back when  
I miss back when  
  
I love my records  
Black shiny vinyl  
Clicks and pops  
And white noise  
Man they sounded fine  
I had my favorite stations  
The ones that played them all  
Country soul and rockandroll  
What happened to those times  
  
Im readin Street Slang For Dummies  
Cause they put pop in my country  
I want more for my money  
The way it was back then  
  
Back when a hoe was a hoe  
Coke was a coke  
And cracks what you were doing  
When you were cracking jokes  
Back when a screw was a screw  
The wind was all that blew  
And when you said Im down with that  
Well it meant you had the flu  
I miss back when  
I miss back when  
I miss back when  
  
Give me a flat top for strumming  
I want the whole world to be humming  
Just keep it coming  
The way it was back then  
  
Back when a hoe was a hoe  
Coke was a coke  
And cracks what you were doing  
When you were cracking jokes  
Back when a screw was a screw  
The wind was all that blew  
And when you said Im down with that  
Well it meant you had the flu  
I miss back when  
I miss back when  
I miss back when
