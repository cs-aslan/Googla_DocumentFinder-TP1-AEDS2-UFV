Get that feeling  
Head is reeling  
You think youre in control  
But you dont know me babe  
I can move you  
I can soothe you  
I can take you places in a different way  
  
I dont think you understand  
What Im trying to say  
Ill be your operator baby  
Im in control  
  
Watch your action  
Close reaction  
And everything youre thinking babe inside your head  
Conversation my creation  
Nothing that you do  
You do unless I said  
  
You dont know the consequences  
Of the things you say  
Ill be your operator baby  
Im in control  
  
All the things you tried to do babe  
And all the words we said before  
Are only part of what I started baby  
And you cant stop me anymore
