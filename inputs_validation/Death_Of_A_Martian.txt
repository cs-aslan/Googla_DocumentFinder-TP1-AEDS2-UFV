Bear paws and rascal power  
Watching us in your garage  
Big girl you ate the neighbor  
The nova is over  
Wake up and play  
Balleradio  
Make room for Claras bare feet  
The love of a Martian  
  
Tick tock and waiting for the meteor  
This clock is opening another door  
  
Lots of love just keep it comin  
Making something out of nothin  
These are the best that I  
I dont know how to say  
Losin what I love today  
These are the best that I  
Lots of love just keep it comin  
Making something out of nothin  
These are the best that I  
I dont know what to say  
Look at what I lost today  
And these are the things that I  
  
Blood flowers in the kitchen  
Signing off and winding down  
This Martian ends her mission  
The nova is over  
She caught the ball  
By the mission bell  
Chase lizards bark at donkeys  
The love of a martian  
  
Lets bow our heads  
And let the trumpets blow  
Our girl is gone  
God bless her little soul  
  
Shes got sword in case  
Tho this is not her lord in case  
The one who cant afford to face  
Her image is restored to grace  
  
Disappeared  
No trace  
Musky tears  
Suitcase  
  
The down turn brave  
Little burncub bearcareless turnip snare  
Rampages pitch color pages  
Down and out but not in Vegas  
Disembarks and disengages  
No loft  
  
Sweet pink canary cages plummet pop dewskin fortitude  
For the sniffing black noses that snort and allude  
To dangling trinkets that mimic the dirt cough go drink its  
Its for you  
  
Blue battered naval town slip kisses delivered by duck  
Muscles and bottlenosed grifters arrive in time to catch the late show  
Its a beehive barrel race  
A shehive stare and chase wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her  
Embossed beneath a box in the closet thats lost  
The kind that you find when you mind your own mysteries  
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters into the new morning milk
blanket  
Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny whos bouquet set a course for
bloom without decay  
Get you broom and sweep the echoes of yesternights fallen freckles away
