Well you know those times  
When you feel like theres a sign there on your back  
Says I dont mind if ya kick me  
Seems like everybody has  
Things go from bad to worse  
Youd think they cant get worse than that  
And then they do  
  
You step off the straight and narrow  
And you dont know where you are  
Use the needle of your compass  
To sew up your broken heart  
Ask directions from a genie  
In a bottle of Jim Beam  
And she lies to You  
Thats when you learn the truth  
  
If youre going through hell  
Keep on going Dont slow down  
If youre scared dont show it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows youre there  
  
Well I been deep down in that darkness  
I been down to my last match  
Felt a hundred different demons  
Breathing fire in my back  
And I knew that if I stumbled  
Id fall right into the trap that they were laying Yeah  
  
But the good news  
Is theres angels everywhere out on the street  
Holding out a hand to pull you back upon your feet  
The ones that you been dragging for so long  
Youre on your knees  
You might as well be praying  
Guess what Im saying  
If youre going through hell  
Keep on going Dont slow down  
If youre scared dont show it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows youre there  
  
Yeah If youre going through hell  
Keep on moving Face that fire  
Walk right through it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows youre there  
  
If youre going through hell  
Keep on going Dont slow down  
If youre scared dont show it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows youre there  
  
Yeah If youre going through hell  
Keep on moving Face that fire  
Walk right through it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows youre there  
Yeah you might get out  
Before the devil even knows youre there  
Yeah
