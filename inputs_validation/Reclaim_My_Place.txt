What the fuck  
Im so dumb therefore I cant relate  
Im so dumb there is nothing to hate  
Really is it me or is it fate  
Give me peace or release for fucks sake  
Give him something to say  
Something super fly never play  
All I hear is disgrace  
Erase them all and reclaim my place  
In the past I was known as a freak  
Had no friends picked on cause I was weak  
Save my ass I got into this band  
Never thought the band would pick on the man  
Give him something to say  
Something super fly never play  
All I hear is disgrace  
Erase them all and reclaim my place  
Reclaim my place  
  
Say it to my face  
So I look around at all these stupid little faces  
Something I can never slap but I embrace  
Youll never ever see youll never ever be  
You wanna fuck around then come fuck with me  
You think you cant relate  
Youll never ever find  
You think you feel my hate  
Look at me and you will find  
My fate you always raped  
I will always be the son  
You want to fuck with me  
Come on fucking play  
  
Now  
  
You can feel it now or be stoned  
Yes you feel it come right now  
You can feel it now or be stoned  
Yes you feel it come right now  
You can feel it now or be stoned  
Yes you feel it come bow down  
Bow down  
  
Give him something to say  
Something super fly never play  
All I hear is disgrace  
Erase them all and reclaim my place  
What the fuck So what the fuck
