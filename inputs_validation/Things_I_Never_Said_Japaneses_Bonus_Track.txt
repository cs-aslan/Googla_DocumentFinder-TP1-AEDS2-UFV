Dont get me started lets get it right  
Theres no use to talk about it deep into the night  
Dont ask about secrets I could tell  
Im gonna keep them to myself  
  
No bad decisions no good advice  
No time to think about it even once or twice  
No second chances looking down the road  
When theres the only way only way to go  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
Whats going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that Im under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
I cant remember I cant forget  
Take it from me theres not a moment of regret  
Since the day I learned to tie my shoes  
I found it hard to spread the news  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
Whats going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that Im under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
Its hard to swallow its hard to take  
When I think about it now my knees begin to shake  
Never came to me to mention at the time  
Tell the truth it never crossed my mind  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
Whats going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that Im under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
Whats going on inside my head  
Could it be the pressure that Im under  
Makes me forget the things I never said
