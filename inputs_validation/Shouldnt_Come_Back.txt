See you calling again  
I dont wanna pick up no oh  
Ive been laying in bed  
Probably thinking too much oh oh  
Sorry Im not sorry for the times  
I dont reply you know the reason why  
  
Maybe you shouldnt come back  
Maybe you shouldnt come back to me  
Tired of being so sad tired of getting so mad baby  
Stop right now youll only let me down oh oh  
Maybe you shouldnt come back  
Maybe you shouldnt come back to me  
  
Trying not to forget should be easier than this oh oh  
And all the birthdays youve missed  
I was only a kid oh oh  
Sorry Im not sorry for the times  
I dont reply you know the reason why  
  
Maybe you shouldnt come back  
Maybe you shouldnt come back to me  
Tired of being so sad tired of getting so mad baby  
Stop right now youll only let me down oh oh  
Maybe you shouldnt come back  
Maybe you shouldnt come back to me  
To me  
  
Sorry Im not sorry for the times  
  
Maybe you shouldnt come back  
Maybe you shouldnt come back to me  
Tired of being so sad tired of getting so mad baby  
Stop right now youll only let me down oh oh  
Maybe you shouldnt come back  
Maybe you shouldnt come back to me  
Baby you shouldnt come back to me
