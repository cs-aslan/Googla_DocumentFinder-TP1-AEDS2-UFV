Weve got nothing to fearbut fear itself  
Not pain not failure not fatal tragedy  
Not the faulty units in this mad machinery  
Not the broken contacts in emotional chemistry  
With an iron fist in a velvet glove  
We are sheltered under the gun  
In the glory game on the power train  
Thy kingdoms will be done  
And the things that we fear are a weapon to be held against us  
Hes not afraid of your judgment  
He knows of horrors worse than your Hell  
Hes a little bit afraid of dying  
But hes a lot more afraid of your lying  
And the things that he fears are a weapon to be held against him  
Can any part of life be larger than life  
Even love must be limited by time  
And those who push us down that they might climb  
Is any killer worth more than his crime  
Like a steely blade in a silken sheath  
We dont see what theyre made of  
They shout about love but when push comes to shove  
They live for the things theyre afraid of  
And the knowledge that they fear is a weapon to be used against them
