There was a time I call before  
When all I knew was what I saw  
The keeper of a major key  
I lived in a town called Liberty  
  
I worked hard  
To give you all the things that you need  
And almost anything that you see  
I spent a lifetime working on you  
And you wont even talk to me  
  
Cant you see  
Why dont you look at me  
Its not your right to be  
So much my enemy  
  
I knew that I could never give  
You knew that you could not forgive  
No price or pride would fall before  
A ten foot wall without a door  
  
But you know  
I watch every step that you make  
To find some other fool you can take  
And I dont know why I even try  
Because it all comes down to this  
  
Cant you see  
Why dont you look at me  
Its not your right to be  
So much my enemy  
  
Cant you see  
Why dont you look at me  
Its not your right to be  
So much my enemy  
  
I worked hard  
To give you all the things that you need  
And almost anything that you see  
I spent a lifetime working on you  
And you wont even talk to me
