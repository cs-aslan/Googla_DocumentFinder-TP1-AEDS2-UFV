Im the one you put all your stories on  
Shes the one you keep it a secret from  
She believes you just like I did at the start  
When you wrapped up my heart and played with my emotions  
  
Chorus  
Tell it to her  
Cause I dont want to hear it  
Tell it to her  
I know why she would  
Theres a fool born every minute  
When youre in it it feels so good  
Why dont you tell it to her  
  
She dont know the darker side of you  
She dont know what your love will put her through  
Your sweet talkin makes her feel so safe and sure  
But that wont change what you are  
And Im the one who knows it  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause I dont want to hear it  
Tell it to her  
I know why she would  
Theres a fool born every minute  
When youre in it it feels so good  
  
Youre the one who had it all and wanted more  
But you cant do it to me anymore  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause I dont want to hear it  
Tell it to her  
I dont want to hear it  
Tell it to her  
Go on and tell it to her  
Tell it to her  
Theres a fool born every minute  
Tell it to her  
Go on and tell it to her  
Tell it to her
