I cant leave you alone tonight  
I cant leave you aloooone  
  
Bring my beat at midnight  
Dont be till the daylight do it right  
Kiss me with affection  
Make that friends connection with some tide  
Alright  
You dont have to wait another life  
Put it all put it all put it all over me  
And grant me on my wishes at one time  
Now give me that fantasy  
  
Kiss me like a stranger  
Its time to misbehave  
Dont leave me lonely  
I cant leave you alone tonight  
You dont need my permission  
When youre in that position  
When you hold me  
I cant leave you alone  
  
Ooh uh oh oh  
Ooh uh oh oh  
Ooh uh oh oh  
Ooh uh oh oh  
  
Stroll down to the dancefloor  
Act like you dont know me for tonight  
Sexy like a diva dressed in black to tease me in the light  
Alright  
  
You dont have to wait another life  
Put it all put it all put it all over me  
And grant me on my wishes at one time  
Now give me that fantasy  
  
Kiss me like a stranger  
Its time to misbehave  
Dont leave me lonely  
I cant leave you alone tonight  
You dont need my permission  
When youre in that position  
When you hold me  
I cant leave you alone  
  
A different kind of love  
A different kind of love  
A different kind of love  
A different kind of love  
Ah ah ah ah  
  
Im lost in a different body  
Surely you can see the signs  
This thing you seize youre mine  
Youre all tied up  
And its different every time  
But you always feel the same the same  
Dont change dont you ever change  
  
Be that fantasy that I visualize  
And youre telling me to do the same  
And well just dress our love up in the skies  
And Ill show what that means  
  
Kiss me like a stranger  
Its time to misbehave  
Dont leave me lonely  
I cant leave you alone tonight  
You dont need my permission  
When youre in that position  
When you hold me  
I cant leave you alooone  
  
A different kind of love  
A different kind of love  
A different kind of love  
A different kind of love  
Ah ah ah ah  
A different kind of love  
A different kind of love  
A different kind of love  
A different kind of love  
Ah ah ah ah
