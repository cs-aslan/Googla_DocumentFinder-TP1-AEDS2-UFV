First glance you nearly made my jaw drop  
First dance and you were looking so hot  
How tense I moved in for a liplock  
Dont stop baby dont stop baby  
  
A first taste like honey you were so yum  
Cant wait for a second cause its so fun  
Third base Im headed for a homerun  
Dont stop baby dont stop baby now  
  
Hold on tight to this rollercoaster ride  
And if youre loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
Cause you aint seen nothing yet  
  
Just let go if you dont well never know  
So if youre loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
Cause you aint seen nothing yet  
  
My place you showed up with flowers  
Your face could stare at it for hours  
Cant wait to see your superpowers  
Dont stop baby dont stop baby  
  
Your car Im sitting right beside you  
Rockstar at everything that you do  
My heart is ready for the next move  
Dont stop baby dont stop baby now  
  
Hold on tight to this rollercoaster ride  
And if youre loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
Cause you aint seen nothing yet  
  
Just let go if you dont well never know  
So if youre loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
Cause you aint seen nothing yet  
  
Yeah yeah not yet  
Yeah yeah not yet  
Yeah yeah not yet  
Cause you aint seen nothing yet  
  
Hold on tight to this rollercoaster ride  
And if youre loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
Cause you aint seen nothing yet  
  
Just let go if you dont well never know  
So if youre loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
Cause you aint seen nothing yet  
  
Yeah yeah not yet  
Yeah yeah not yet  
Yeah yeah not yet  
Cause you aint seen nothing yet
