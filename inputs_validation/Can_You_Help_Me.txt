Can you finally reach me  
Out beyond the blue  
Ive been gone a long time  
Far away from you  
  
I can see that love alone is not enough  
If you dont believe in what you are and what youve got  
  
The tears youve cried have come to my eyes  
  
Can you can you help me  
cause I went away  
Can you can you help me  
Or is it too late  
Can you can you help me  
Im trying to get through  
Can you can you help me  
cause I wanna love you  
  
Once youve been defeated  
Once youve been defined  
Once your will is broken down  
Its so hard to feel alive  
  
But I believe that somewhere out across the fields  
I can see what is false and what is real  
  
Youre the one face that holds me in place  
I can see you  
  
Can you can you help me  
cause I went away  
Can you can you help me  
Or is it too late  
Can you can you help me  
Im trying to get through  
Can you can you help me  
cause Im want to love you  
  
You say hush everyone heals in time  
So hush hush everyone heals in time  
Hush everyone heals in time time  
So hush hush everyone heals in time  
  
Can you can you help me  
cause I went away  
Can you can you help me  
Or is it too late  
Can you can you help me  
Im trying to get through  
Can you can you help me  
cause I wanna love you  
  
I wanna love you
