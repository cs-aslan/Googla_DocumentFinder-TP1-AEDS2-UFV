Ive been slavin my mind just to try to find a way out  
And its been on my brain just to put the blame on you  
Ive gotta find a way just to make my day a useful one  
Cause Im a front row ticket to a nothin show  
Ive got one free pass just to let me know  
Hey babe its a stagnant time  
But it takes more than that to hang my coat and hat and sleep  
Ive gotta sweat once more till my bones feel sore  
I tell you why  
Cause Im a front row ticket to a nothin show  
Ive gotta crash this prison and not let go  
My hearts on a sun cloud screamin for progress  
Cause I want work  
Ill keep slavin my mind just to try to find some kind of light  
Im gonna burn this damn ticket and think of tomorrow  
And I wont live this long life in stagnation no more  
My hearts on a sun cloud screamin for progress  
Cause Im a man  
And mans gotta work
