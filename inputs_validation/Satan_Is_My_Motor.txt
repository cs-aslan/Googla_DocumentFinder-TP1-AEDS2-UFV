Ive got wheels of polished steel  
Ive tires that grab the road  
Ive got seats that selflessly hold my friends  
And a trunk that can carry the heaviest of loads  
  
Ive got a mind that can steer me to your house  
And a heart that can bring you red flowers  
My intentions are good and earnest and true  
But under my hood is internal combustion power  
And Satan is my motor  
Hear my motor purr  
Satan is my motor motor  
Hear my motor purr  
Satan is the only one who seems to understand  
  
Ive got brakes Im wide awake  
I can stop this car at any time  
At the very last second I can change directions  
Turn completely around if I feel so inclined  
  
Ive got a mind that can steer me to your house  
And a heart that can bring you red flowers  
My intentions are good and earnest and true  
But under my hood is internal combustion power  
  
And Satan is my motor  
Hear my motor purr  
Satan is my motor motor  
Hear my motor purr  
Satan is the only one who seems to understand  
  
Satan is my motor x4  
  
Satan is my motor  
Hear my motor purr  
  
Satan is my motor  
Satan is the only one who seems to understand
