I never wanted to go  
I never wanted a way  
A way to see it believe it  
I know that youre not leaving today  
  
Caught in a trap of routine  
Caught in a shitty old scene  
Ill tell you a secret  
I need it  
Take a trip and youll see what I mean  
  
Time is just not only seconds in a day  
Cause what you got can be taken all away  
With just one shot yeah nothings here to stay  
Why dont you get up Cause this ime its going down  
  
Wanting and waiting  
Dreams are fading  
Things will never be the same  
Ever changing and rearranging  
Will you notice anyway  
  
I never really wanted to go  
I never really wanted a way  
A way to see it believe it  
I know that youre not leaving today  
  
One day youll look and see that things are not the same  
The time you took has been taken all away  
The hands you shook dont even know your name  
You better get up cause this time its going down  
  
I never really wanted to go  
I never really wanted a way  
A way to see it believe it  
I know that youre not leaving today  
  
Take a look and see that things are not the same
