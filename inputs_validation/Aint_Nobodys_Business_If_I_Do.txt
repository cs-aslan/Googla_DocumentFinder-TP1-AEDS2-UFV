There aint nothing I can do  
Or nothing I can say  
That folks dont criticize me  
But Im going to do  
Just as I want to anyway  
And dont care just what people say  
If I should take a notion  
To jump into the ocean  
Aint nobodys business if I do  
If I go to church on Sunday  
Then cabaret all day Monday  
Aint nobodys business if I do  
If my man aint got no money  
And I say take all mine honey  
Aint nobodys business if I do  
If I give him my last nickel  
And it leaves me in a pickle  
Aint nobodys business if I do  
But Id rather my man would hit me  
Than follow him to jump up and quit me  
Aint nobodys business if I do  
I swear I wont call no copper  
If Im beat up by my papa  
Aint nobodys business if I do  
Nobodys business  
Aint nobodys business  
Nobodys business if I do
