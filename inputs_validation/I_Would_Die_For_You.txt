I gotta take a little time a little time to think things over  
I better read between the lines in case I need it when Im older  
Now this mountain I must climb feels like the world upon my shoulders  
Through the clouds I see love shine it keeps me warm as life grows colder  
In my life theres been heartache and pain  
I dont know if I can face it again  
Cant stop now Ive travelled so far to change this lonely life  
I want to know what love is I want you to show me  
I want to feel what love is I know you can show me  
Im gonna take a little time a little time to look around me  
Ive got nowhere left to hide it looks like love has finally found me  
In my life theres been heartache and pain  
I dont know if I can face it again  
Cant stop now Ive travelled so far to change this lonely life  
I want to know what love is I want you to show me  
I want to feel what love is I know you can show me  
I want to know what love is I want you to show me  
And I wanna feel I want to feel what love is  
And I know I know you can show me  
Lets talk about love  I want to know what love is  
The love that you feel inside  I want you to show me  
And Im feeling so much love  I want to feel what love is  
No you just cant hide  I know you can show me  
I want to know what love is lets talk about love I know you can show me  
I wanna feel it too  I want to feel what love is  
I wanna feel it too and I know and I know  I know you can show me  
Show me love is real yeah  I want to know what love is
