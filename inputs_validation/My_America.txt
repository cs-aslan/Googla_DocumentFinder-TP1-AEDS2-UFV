  
Rush Limbaugh dont know shit about  
The Way Things Ought To Be  
Lets over throw the government  
Leave everything to me  
Ive got a plan yea  
You could call it a vision  
Ill be the dictator  
And make all the decisions  
This is my America  
Thats how its gonna be  
Ive always wanted my own  
Nuclear capability  
This is my America  
Thats how its gonna be  
This is my America  
One nation under me  
This is my America  
This is my America  
This is my America  
This is my America  
Ive got a plan to deal with all the  
Sickos on death row  
Gladiator fightsll  
Be your new favorite show  
Confiscate the crack babies  
From the hospitals  
Microchips in their brains make  
Cyborg soldiers of em all  
This is my America  
Thats how its gonna be  
A hedonist police state  
From sea to shining sea  
This is my America  
Thats how it gonna be  
This is my America  
All hail Me  
All hail Me  
All hail Me  
All hail Me  
Concentration camps  
For everyone I thinks a jerk  
Thatll be most everyone  
And theyll do all the work  
Dissidents are put to death  
Nightly on the tube  
Executions will continue  
Until morale improves  
This is my America  
Thats how its gonna be  
Ive always wanted my own  
Nuclear capability  
This is my America  
Thats how its gonna be  
This is my America  
One nation under me  
This is my America x 8
