Im moving out of Tombstone yeah with the sun behind my back  
Im tired of people talking of things that I lack  
Ever since a week ago the day he passed away  
Ive been taking too much notice of the things theyve had to say  
  
And all they say is you aint half the man he used to be  
He had strength and he worked his life to feed his family  
So if thats the way it has to be Ill say goodbye to you  
Im not the guy or so it seems to fill my old mans shoes  
  
Like Im a wicked way of life the kind that should be tamed  
Theyd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains  
Oh its hard and I cant see what they want me to do Lord Lord  
They seem to think I should step into the old mans shoes
