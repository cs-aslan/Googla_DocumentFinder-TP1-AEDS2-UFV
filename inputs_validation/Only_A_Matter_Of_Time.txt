A suited man smiled said  
Its just a matter of time  
You can have the world at your feet  
By tomorrow  
Just sign on this line  
Hold tight limelight  
Approaching the paramount  
With the sun in our eyes  
Fearing family ties legalize  
Compromise  
  
In a dimly lit room with a stool as his  
Stage  
A dreamstricken prince of a paupers  
Descent  
Haunts the eavesdropping silence  
That presses his window  
As he sweats a performance  
To an audience that ticks on the wall  
  
To the practical observer  
Its just a matter of time  
You can deviate from the com  
Monplace  
Only to fall back in line  
I understand mines a risky plan  
And your system cant miss  
But is security after all a cause  
Or symptom of happiness  
  
Brave yet afraid his eyes on horizon  
In a steadyset gaze  
A mariner soon from an open cocoon  
Takes a moment to summon his courage  
To stifle his grave apprehension and  
Trembling approaches the surf  
A fathers benediction as his hopeful  
Son departs  
To brave the sea of rage and conquer  
At all costs  
  
Lingers in his memory  
And visions still surviving in a logic  
Proof shell  
That should have been held sacred safe  
And hidden well  
Are compromised in usury  
With every rising sun that yields no  
Sight of land  
The hesitation cultivates within the  
Tired man  
And rumors spread of mutiny  
And though the time will come when  
Dream and day unite  
Tonight the only consolation causing  
Him to fight  
In fearless faith in destiny  
  
Even when plans fall to pieces  
I can still find the courage  
With promise Ive found in my faith  
  
Likely or not its a dream that we keep  
And at odds with our senses well climb  
But if faith is the answer were already  
Reached it  
And if spirits a sign  
Then its only a matter of time
