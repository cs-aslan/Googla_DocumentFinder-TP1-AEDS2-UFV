Got a Black Magic Woman  
Got a Black Magic Woman  
Yes I got a Black Magic Woman  
Shes got me so blind I cant see  
But shes a Black Magic Woman and  
shes trying to make a devil out of me  
  
Dont turn your back on me baby  
Dont turn your back on me baby  
Yes dont turn your back on me baby  
Dont mess around with your tricks  
Dont turn your back on me baby  
cause you might just wake up my magic sticks  
  
You got your spell on me baby  
You got your spell on me baby  
Yes you got your spell on me baby  
Turnin my heart into stone  
I need you so bad  
Magic Woman I cant leave you alone
