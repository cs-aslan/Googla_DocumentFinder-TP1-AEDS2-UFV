Nothings changed here  
Its like you never left  
I kept everything the same  
Even left your socks at the end of the bed  
  
Everyone keeps telling me  
Youre not coming back  
But for my sanity Im holding on  
Its the only thing I have  
  
I cant let go of your memory baby  
Always in my head oh  
  
Its the only thing that keeps me going lately  
Since you left  
Oh suddenly I cant remember  
  
What happened here  
Why did you leave  
Are you coming back  
  
What happened here  
Why did you leave  
Are you coming back home  
Are you coming back to me  
  
Can you hear me calling  
Can you still feel my touch  
Wont you find your way back home  
Back to me my love  
  
Still feel your footsteps  
Coming down the hall  
I still feel you next to me when I know youre not there  
Im so lost  
  
Without you I dont smile  
Without you I dont laugh  
I dont feel at all no  
  
Without you I dont care  
Without you Im scared  
When Im trying  
I cant remember  
  
What happened here  
Why did you leave  
Are you coming back  
  
What happened here  
Why did you leave  
Are you coming back home  
Are you coming back to me  
  
Im tired of crying all night long  
I used to be so strong  
My foolish heart was wrong  
  
I try to hard just not to picture you  
But every day I do  
Lord I do  
Everything reminds me of you  
  
What happened here  
What happened here  
  
I cant let go of your memory baby  
Always in my head oh  
  
Its the only thing that keeps me going lately  
Since you left  
Oh suddenly I cant remember  
  
What happened here  
Why did you leave  
Are you coming back  
  
What happened here  
Why did you leave  
Are you coming back yeah  
Are you coming back to me  
  
What happened here  
Why did you leave  
Are you coming back
