No one can tell me just why it is  
That it always has to come to this  
Fix it up  
Throw it away  
I dont get it  
The price you pay  
theres no sense no matter what you say  
What sticks inside aint gonna fade away  
Fix it up  
Throw it away  
I dont care  
Its the price you pay  
Im fallin away  
Im fallin away  
Im fallin away  
Im fallin away  
cant make out this next part but I think its  
You say dont pay  
You say dont pay  
Too high  
Too low  
Im fallin away  
Im fallin away  
Im fallin away  
Im fallin away  
Again cant quite tell but this time it sounds a lot more like  
You say dont pay  
You say dont pay  
You say dont pay  
You say dont pay  
fading out  
Fallin away  
Fallin away  
Fallin away  
Fallin away  
Fallin away  
Fallin away  
Fallin away  
Fallin away
