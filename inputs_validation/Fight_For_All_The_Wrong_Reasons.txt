Well I wanted you  
I wanted no one else  
I thought it through  
I got you to myself  
You got off  
Every time you got onto me  
I got caught up  
In favorable slavery  
  
Chorus  
I guess it wasnt really right  
I guess it wasnt meant to be  
It didnt matter what they said  
Cause we were good in bed  
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight  
For all the wrong reasons  
No it didnt matter what I tried  
Its just a little hard to leave  
When youre going down on me  
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight  
For all the wrong reasons  
  
Well you know my friends  
They know your enemies  
And Id pretend  
Not to hear what they said to me  
Cause I got off  
Every time you got onto me  
Was it wrong  
To go along with insanity  
  
Chorus  
  
I guess it wasnt what it wasnt really what I thought  
I thought it was the day I got I want it all to go away  
I guess it wasnt what it wasnt really what I thought  
I thought it was the day I got I want it all to go away  
I guess it wasnt what it wasnt really what I thought  
I thought it was the day I got I want it all to go away  
I guess it wasnt what it wasnt really what I thought  
I thought it was the day I got I want it all to go away  
  
Chorus
