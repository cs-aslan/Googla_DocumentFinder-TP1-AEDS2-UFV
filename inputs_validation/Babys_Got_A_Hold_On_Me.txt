Sittin on the front porch tryin to keep still  
Babys lookin finer than a fifty dollar bill  
Pretty blue eyes and it isnt hard to see  
That babys got a hold on me  
  
Long blond hair down the middle of her back  
Shes got the keys to her daddys Cadillac  
Got every little thing that Im ever gonna need  
Babys got a hold on me  
  
Got a hold on got a hold on me  
Got a hold on babys got a hold on me  
  
Weve got a full tank of gas lookin for a thrill  
A three day weekend lot of time to kill  
Put the top down but were never gonna freeze  
Cause babys got a hold on me  
  
Got a hold on got a hold on me  
Got a hold on babys got a hold on me  
Hold on  
  
Well the full moons shinin on a Carolina night  
Drivin my girl across the interstate line  
Got a preacher waitin and thats how its gonna be  
Cause babys got a hold on me  
  
Got a hold on got a hold on me  
Got a hold on babys got a hold on me  
  
Got a hold on got a hold on  
Got a hold on babys got a hold on me  
Babys got a hold on me  
Babys got a hold on me  
Babys got a hold on me
