Girl afraid  
Where do his intentions lay   
  
Or does he even have any   
  
She says   
  
He never really looks at me  
I give him every opportunity  
In the room downstairs  
He sat and stared  
In the room downstairs  
He sat and stared  
Ill never make that mistake again   
  
Ill never make that mistake again  
Ill never make that mistake again  
  
Boy afraid  
Prudence never pays  
  
And everything she wants costs money  
  
But she doesnt even like me   
And I know because she said so  
In the room downstairs  
She sat and stared  
In the room downstairs  
She sat and stared  
Ill never make that mistake again
