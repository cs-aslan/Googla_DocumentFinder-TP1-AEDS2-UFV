Far off into the distance  
Holding on inside  
Nobody to hear me scream  
Nobody to hear me cry  
Too close to no nobody  
Too far to hold onto life  
Theres nowhere to run  
And onwhere to hide  
  
Hold onto yourself  
Hold onto the life that u live  
Hold onto me  
And neva let go  
Dont be afraid  
To face the dangers each day  
Hold onto me  
And neva let go  
  
Too heavy to fly away  
Too light to try to die  
Too false to live no truth  
Too trughful to deny  
Too weak to live  
Too strong to hold back now  
Too many answers  
To ask the qusetion how  
  
Chorus  
Dont deny that u live  
Dont deny that u breathe  
Just hold onto me  
Dont lie cos ur real  
Dont lie u can deal with this  
Hold onto me
