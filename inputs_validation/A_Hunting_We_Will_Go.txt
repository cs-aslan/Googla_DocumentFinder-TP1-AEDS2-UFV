A hunting we will go a hunting we will go  
Heigh ho the dairyo a hunting we will go  
A hunting we will go a hunting we will go  
Well catch a fox and put him in a box  
And then well let him go  
  
A hunting we will go a hunting we will go  
Heigh ho the dairyo a hunting we will go  
A hunting we will go a hunting we will go  
Well catch a fish and put him on a dish  
And then well let him go  
  
A hunting we will go a hunting we will go  
Heigh ho the dairyo a hunting we will go  
A hunting we will go a hunting we will go  
Well catch a bear and cut his hair  
And then well let him go  
  
A hunting we will go a hunting we will go  
Heigh ho the dairyo a hunting we will go  
A hunting we will go a hunting we will go  
Well catch a pig and dance a little jig  
And then well let him go  
  
A hunting we will go a hunting we will go  
Heigh ho the dairyo a hunting we will go  
A hunting we will go a hunting we will go  
Well catch a giraffe and make him laugh  
And then well let him go
