Its getting dark outside  
Daytime is done  
The lights along the river come up  
One by one  
Lets make love again  
We got time  
I am yours  
You are mine  
Its getting dark outside  
I have to go  
Dont want my husband  
Or my friends to know  
Zip up my dress  
  
I cant find my shoes  
Dont fall in love with me  
Too much to lose  
The kids are home by now  
Have to think fast  
I really think this afternoon  
Must be the last  
Dont say anything  
Dont turn on the light  
Thanks for loving me  
Call you tonight
