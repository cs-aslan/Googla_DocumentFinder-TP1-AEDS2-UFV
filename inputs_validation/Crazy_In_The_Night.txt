Somewhere out in the galaxy  
A numbers up but not for me  
Theres a light inside the window  
And the curtains coming down  
Pig is on the spit and turning round  
  
Going crazy in the night  
Crazy in the night  
  
Dropped in from Munich with a master plan  
Guess he left his wife and kids at home  
Hes got so much money rollin  
From the crimes hell commit  
But the Siamese cats are gonna take a little bit  
  
Chorus  
Going crazy in the night  
Crazy in the night  
Will I turn and run or do I stand and face the gun  
Going crazy in the night  
Everybody seemed tove lost their way  
Crazy in the night  
Seems theres no way outta here  
Do I turn and run  
No  
  
Got no hands but Ive got my head  
Ive come so far from the temple  
Maybe this is Babylon or maybe its a dream  
If it werent so beautiful it would be obscene  
Drinking with the panthers dancing for their life  
God this place is hungry  
Come and see the players but dont stay for the show  
The cats are out tonight hungry for their rites  
  
Chorus  
  
Got no hands but Ive got my head  
Ive come so far from the temple  
Maybe this is Babylon or maybe its a dream  
If it werent so beautiful
