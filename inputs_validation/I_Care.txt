I dont believe you when you say theres nothing wrong  
And you cant hide the tears in your eyes from me  
Dont you know weve been together much too long  
Please dont hide itoh baby cant you see  
CHORUS  
That I care Yes I careAnd I swear I do Oh I do oh I do  
I really do love you Oh I care Yes I care And I swear I do  
Oh I do Yes I do I really do want you  
Would it matter if I told you I was sorry  
For all the little things I didnt do for you  
And if you ever left me girl dont you know Id worry  
You know all I ever wanted was you  
And I care Yes I care And I swear I do And I do oh I do  
I really do love you Oh I care Yes I care And I swear I do  
Oh I do Yes I do I really do want you  
BRIDGE  
Oh I want you to want me too  
Just to love me just to love me  
CHORUS
