Every day I wake  
Every word I speak  
Got you on my mind  
Ive made love to you  
And I may not be  
The answer to your prayer  
Give me just one night  
And Ill take you there  
  
I can read your mind  
Honey I aint blind  
You want love so hard  
Its no federal crime  
  
Chorus  
Someones gotta tell me  
That youre mine all mine  
Take me to your river honey  
Fracture my mind  
Ill be bad for you  
So very bad for you  
Ive got my brand on you  
Ill be bad for you  
  
When you turn around  
Ill be standing there  
Anywhere you go  
I will follow you  
Any place you walk  
Any words you talk  
Ill be by your side  
I wont let you down  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill be bad for you  
So very bad for you  
I put my brand on you  
Ill be bad for you  
Bad for you  
  
Listen to me  
Be bad for me  
  
Every day I wake  
Every word I speak  
Got you on my mind  
Ive made love to you  
  
When the night gets hot  
Youre my only thought  
Cant control myself  
Ill make love to you  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill be bad for you  
So very bad for you  
Aint nothin you can do  
Ill be bad for you  
Bad for you  
Nothing you can do  
Im so bad for you baby  
Ill be bad for you baby
