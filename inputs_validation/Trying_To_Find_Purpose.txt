Well the sun sets gently on your shoulders  
And it makes me want to touch you there  
And the light in your eyes makes me feel  
Like theres something much better out there  
Something kind  
  
And I know someday I might be looking around  
Trying to find some purpose  
Well purpose it cant be that hard to find  
As long as Ive got the wind  
The wind and your love to carry me  
  
Well tomorrow holds only mystery  
And whos to say what might be  
But I know in you Ive found a love so strong  
The sun and the moon look on in jealousy  
In jealousy  
  
Chorus  
  
Well the sun sets gently on your shoulders  
And it makes me want to touch you there  
And the light in your eyes makes me feel  
Like theres something much better out there  
Something kind  
  
Chorus  
  
To carry me  
Please carry me
