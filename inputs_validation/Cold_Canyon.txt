Travel round the country  
Look out for what I can get  
Another blessed highway  
Hey mister youre gonna regret  
  
Cause you just reminded me of something  
I long to forget  
But no matter how much he drink or smoke  
My memorys still clear  
  
It hurts me dear  
Its sharp today like it was yesterday  
No I dont have much hope  
Just the other night I came  
  
Face to face with my past  
Came down like a lightning bolt  
Struck me with a flash  
I was praying all along  
  
That it would not last  
Oh stop it stop it stop it stop it  
Yknow the last time you rang  
I nearly died I almost cried  
  
I put my pride in my pockets  
And said you gotta stay cool cool cool  
Yknow some things just gotta hang  
Oh Lord Lord  
  
Take me back  
Im going back  
The long track  
So do yourself a favor  
  
And leave me if you please  
Im in a cold cold canyon  
With a cold cold canyon breeze  
Woke up in a strange room  
  
And then I saw a door  
I went right over and opened it  
Though Id never been there before  
Started presiding over the meeting  
  
The chairman said I had the floor  
And when we adjourned everyone  
Was satisfied  
We all got our money  
  
Then went out where it was sunny  
But it was kind of funny  
To find out that I was such a dummy  
But theres no place you can really hide
