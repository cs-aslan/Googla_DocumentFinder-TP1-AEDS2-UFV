We hang tough  
When the chips are low  
Cant buy enough  
So we steal the show  
We get so hot  
We cant cool down  
So the hell with that  
Were rippin through your town  
  
Weve had enough of the raw deals  
Hit the road and tell ya how it feels  
  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
  
We live fast  
But we love it so  
Cant see the past  
But its gone we know  
We get so hot  
We cant cool down  
So the hell with that  
Were burnin through your town  
  
Weve had enough of the raw deals  
Hit the road and tell ya how it feels  
  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Run like hell  
  
Hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels
