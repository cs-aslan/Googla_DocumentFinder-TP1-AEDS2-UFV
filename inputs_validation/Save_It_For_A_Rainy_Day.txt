Its no secret that lately there aint no escape  
And that Ive been waking up alone  
Just me and the tv and a sinking feeling  
That you aint ever coming home  
  
But today  
The tears aint gonna hit the floor  
Cause the boats in the bay  
And its calling my name  
So Im heading on out the door  
  
Cause the suns too bright  
The skys too blue  
Beers too cold to be thinking about you  
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away  
Save it for a rainy day  
  
When I turned the ignition  
I knew Id be missing  
The feel of the wind on my face  
I was stuck in a habit  
  
Wondering what happened  
Two days of taking all the blame  
Got a drink or two  
Thats as fool proof as what it will be  
Its a beautiful world with a beautiful girl  
Kind of making eyes at me  
  
Cause the suns too bright  
The skys too blue  
Beers too cold to be thinking about you  
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away  
Save it for a rainy day  
  
Yeah the musics too good  
My friends are all out  
And theyre all too high to be bringing them down  
If they ask about you  
Ive got nothing to say  
Ill save it for a rainy day  
  
Theyll be plenty of time for ones and whys  
And howd I let you get away  
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head  
Is just gonna have to wait  
  
Cause the suns too bright  
The skys too blue  
Beers too cold to be thinking about you  
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away  
Save it for a rainy day  
  
Yeah the musics too good  
My friends are all out  
And theyre all too high to be bringing them down  
If they ask about you  
Ive got nothing to say  
Ill save it for a rainy day  
  
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away  
Save it for a rainy day  
Save it for a rainy day
