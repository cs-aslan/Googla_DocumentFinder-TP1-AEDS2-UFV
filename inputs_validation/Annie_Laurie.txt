Maxwellton braes are bonnies where early fas the dew  
And its there that Annie Laurie gied me her promise true  
Gied me her promise true which ner forgot shall be  
And for bonnie Annie Laurie Id lay me down an dee  
Her brow is like the snawdrift ner neck is like the swan  
Her face is the fairest that eer the sun shone on  
That eer eer the sun shone on and dark blue is her ee  
And for bonnie Annie Laurie Id lay me down and dee  
Like dew on the gowan lyin is the fa of her fairy feet  
And like winds in summer sighin her voice is low and sweet  
Her voice is low and sweet and shes a the worls tae me  
And for bonnie Annie Laurie Id lay me down and dee  
And for bonnie Annie Laurie Id lay me down and dee
