I want to know you  
I want to show you  
I want to grow you  
Inside of me  
I want to see you  
I want to free you  
I want to be you  
Inside of me  
Love me 50000 miles beneath my brain  
Love me 50000 times and then again  
  
Can you love me with a thousand eyes  
Can you see right through my bones  
Can you kiss me with a thousand lips  
Can you melt a solid stone  
Can you hear me from a thousand miles  
When youre screaming at the stars  
Can you pull me up to Jupiter  
When Im all hung up on Mars  
Burn my eyes with your flame  
Let your world spin free  
Let it go baby  
Ill do the same  
All depends on me  
Let it go  
Its all the same  
What with jewels that you cant see  
Love me love me love me love me love me babe  
Bring it on home to me
