You will keep the fires burning  
You will keep the fires burning  
You will keep the fires burning  
You will keep the fires burning  
  
Were standing in the desert  
Of dry bones  
But still we see Your life  
Walking through the valley of shadows  
But holding onto light  
And were waiting  
Waiting on You God  
And our hearts will trust  
Trust in who You are  
  
God who keeps our fires burning  
Burning through the darkest night  
See the hope in our hearts  
The faith in our eyes  
You can move the highest mountain  
You can keep our dreams alive  
Youre the joy of our hearts  
And Youre the fire in our eyes  
  
Were standing in the desert  
Of dry bones  
But still we see Your life  
Walking through the valley of shadows  
But holding onto light  
And were waiting  
Waiting on You God  
And our hearts will trust  
Trust in who You are  
  
God who keeps our fires burning  
Burning through the darkest night  
See the hope in our hearts  
The faith in our eyes  
You can move the highest mountain  
You can keep our dreams alive  
Youre the joy of our hearts  
And Youre the fire in our eyes  
  
Light up our lives with Holy flame  
All for the honor of Your name  
Give us the strength to face the day  
Light up our lives with Holy flame  
All for the honor of Your name  
Give us the strength to face the day  
Youre the fire in our eyes  
  
God who keeps our fires burning  
Burning through the darkest night  
See the hope in our hearts  
The faith in our eyes  
You can move the highest mountain  
You can keep our dreams alive  
Youre the joy of our hearts  
And Youre the fire in our eyes  
Youre the fire in our eyes  
Youre the fire in our eyes  
You light up our lives  
Youre the fire in our eyes  
  
You will keep the fires burning  
You will keep the fires burning burning  
You will keep the fires burning  
You will keep the fires burning burning
