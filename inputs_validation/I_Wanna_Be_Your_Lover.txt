Well the rainman comes with his magic wand  
And the judge says Mona cant have no bond  
And the walls collide Mona cries  
And the rain man leaves in the wolf mans disguise  
  
I want to be your lover baby I want to be your man  
I want to be your lover baby  
I dont want to be hers I want to be yours  
  
Well the undertaker in his midnight suit  
Says to the masked man aint you cute  
Well the mask man he gets up on the shelf  
And he says you aint so bad yourself  
  
I want to be your lover baby I want to be your man  
I want to be your lover baby  
I dont want to be hers I want to be yours  
  
Well jumpin Judy cant go no higher  
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire  
Rasputin hes so dignified  
He touched the back of her head an he died  
  
I want to be your lover baby I want to be your man  
I want to be your lover baby  
I dont want to be hers I want to be yours  
  
Well Phaedra with her looking glass  
Stretchin out upon the grass  
She gets all messed up and she faints  
Thats cause shes so obvious and you aint  
  
I want to be your lover baby I want to be your man  
I want to be your lover baby  
I dont want to be hers I want to be yours
