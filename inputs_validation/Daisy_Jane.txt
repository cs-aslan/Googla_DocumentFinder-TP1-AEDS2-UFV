Flyin me back to Memphis  
Gotta find my Daisy Jane  
Well the summers gonne  
And I hope shes feelin the same  
Well I left her just to roam the city  
Thinkin it would easy the pain  
Im a crazy man and Im playin my crazy game game  
Does she really love me I think she does  
Like the star above me I know  
Because when the sky is bright  
Everythings all right  
  
Flyin me back to Memphis  
Honey keep the oven warm  
All the clouds are clearin  
And I think were over the storm  
Well I been pickin it up around me  
Daisy I think Im sane  
Well Im awful glad  
And I guess youre really to blame blame  
Do you really love me  
I hope you do  
Like the stars above me how I love you  
When its cold at night  
Everythings all right
