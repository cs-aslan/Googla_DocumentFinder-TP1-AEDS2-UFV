Oh randy if they knew  
I think theyd take me away  
Just for loving you you  
All alone in my own quiet way  
Cause thats the way that I want it  
  
Wish I could see you now  
You and your cherry black eyes  
My heart would never lie down down  
Cause thats the way my arrow flies  
And thats the way that I want it  
  
You never said it would rain  
You only told me that the sun would come again  
You never said it would rain  
Oh randy if you did  
It wouldnt mean a thing  
It wouldnt hurt me a bit  
Cause only you can break my wings  
And thats the way that I want it  
  
You drew my face in the sand  
And ever since that day you made me what I am  
You drew my face in the sand  
Oh randy if I could  
Theres nothing I wouldnt give  
To live with you for good  
Cause thats the way Id like to live  
And thats the way that I want it  
  
Randy oh my randy  
Randy oh my randy  
Randy oh my randy
