We all want to make a place in this world  
We all want our voices to be heard  
Every one wants a chance to be someone  
We all have dreams we need to dream  
Sweeter than any star you can reach  
cause when you reach and find youve found someone  
Youll hold this worlds most priceless thing  
The greatest gift this life can bring  
Is when you look back and know  
You were loved  
  
Chorus  
You were loved by someone  
Touched by someone  
Held by someone  
Meant something to someone  
Loved somebody  
Touched somebodys heart  
Along the way  
You can look back and say mm  
You were loved yes you were  
  
You can have diamonds in your hands  
Have all the riches in the land  
But without love  
You dont really have a thing no no  
When somebody cares that youre alive  
When somebody trusts you with their life  
Thats when youll know huh  
That you have all you need  
Youll hold this worlds most priceless gift  
The finest treasure that there is  
You can look back and know  
You were loved  
  
Chorus  
  
So many roads that you can take  
Whatever way you go  
Dont take that road alone  
Its better you should know  
  
Chorus  
  
So remember to tell that special one yeah mm  
You were loved  
You were loved  
You were loved  
You were loved  
Hey hey hey hey hey
