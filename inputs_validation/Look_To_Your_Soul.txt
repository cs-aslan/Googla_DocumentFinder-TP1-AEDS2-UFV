I know if Id been wiser this would never have occurred  
But I wallowed in my blindness so its plain that I deserve  
For the sin of selfindulgence when the truth was writ quite clear  
I must spend my life amongst the dead who spend their lives in fear  
Of a death that theyre not sure of of a life they cant control  
Its all so simple really if you just look to your soul  
  
Some say that Im a wise man some think that Im a fool  
It doesnt matter either way Ill be a wise mans fool  
For the lesson lies in learning and by teaching Ill be taught  
For theres nothing hidden anywhere its all there to be sought  
And so if you know anything look closely at the time  
At others who remain untrue and dont commit that crime
