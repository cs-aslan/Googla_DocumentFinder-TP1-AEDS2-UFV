Bless the day you came into my life I still remember  
Horny cowboy with your stars and stripes  
Bringing the light into my day  
With that Texan smile  
  
Too afraid to love to hope that you would stay  
So broken that I never saw you chase the past away  
  
My American Angel he doesnt want to fight doesnt need to fight  
My US of Angel holds me in the dead of night  
Takes away that fear that I carried forever  
You stopped to wipe away my tears  
And you stayed forever and more  
  
I dont think that I  
  
Yesterday it seemed my life was colder than December  
All alone I watched the eagles fly  
Even the light seemed to have changed  
In the Californian sky  
  
Through all of those battles then you came  
Stepped out of the fading light  
Said Baby Im American dry your eyes again  
Because Im here to save your life  
  
My American Angel he doesnt want to fight doesnt need to fight  
My US of Angel holds me in the dead of night  
Takes away that fear that I carried forever  
You stopped to wipe away my tears  
But you stayed forever amore  
  
And more didnt you baby  
  
Because I dont think that I could love and lose again  
I dont think I have the strength  
I dont think I have the strength  
  
I dont think that I
