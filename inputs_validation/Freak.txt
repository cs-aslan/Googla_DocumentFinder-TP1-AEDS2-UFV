I used to wonder why  
When I was walking by  
They talked about me  
What could it be  
They tried to break me  
Never could make me  
  
Out in the streets  
Takin all the heat  
Dancin in the sheets oh yeah  
  
All those streaks in my hair  
People point at me and stare  
If they ask me Ill say yeah  
Im a freak  
And I love the clothes I wear  
Where their life goes I dont care  
Its my price Im proud to pay  
Im a freak  
  
The called me crazy  
It doesnt faze me  
Im doing fine theyre doing time  
They tried to break me  
Never could make me  
Live like a fire  
Dancin with desire  
Walkin on the wire oh yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Im a freak and love what I see  
Im a freak and I love being me yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Out in the streets  
Takin all the heat  
Dancin in the sheets oh yeah  
  
I pledge allegiance to the state of independence  
  
I got streaks in my hair  
People point at me and stare  
If they ask me Ill say yeah  
Im a freak  
And I love the clothes I wear  
Where their life goes I dont care  
Its my price Im proud to pay  
Im a freak  
Im the freak and I love what I see  
Im the freak and I love being me  
Im a freak and thats all I can be  
Im a freak yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
I pledge allegiance to the state of independence
