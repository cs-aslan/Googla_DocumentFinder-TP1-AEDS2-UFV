Its funny how the Earth rotates man you never know whats  
going to happen ya know mean  
All I said was Aiight I got this chiki bang bang dang da dang  
Then it all got it started for me man  
Yo man Im just getting back from the tour man  
What it be like man  
Yo bust it turn me up  
Somebody told me if you can make in New York City man you can  
make it anywhere else man  
Somehow I believe that shhhh  
  
Chorus  
Oh what a night  
Late December 1993 what happened  
Who thought he would rule the industry  
What an MC on the grind  
  
Yo I aint always have whips I aint always have yachts  
I aint always have chips I aint always have rocks  
Matta fact I was a grimey little negro  
Who said if music didnt work Id sell diesel  
What chall thought I wasnt raised in the projects  
First of the month waitin for that PA check  
Lived on the first floor  
Were so poor that if you rung the buzzer the roaches would answer the door
who is it  
I went from boy to man in one night  
When I saw my life flash like light from poltergeist  
What made it worse I couldnt speak English  
But from his facial expressions he wanted my Adidas  
So hurry up and come out and play  
Ill be damned if I leave barefooted in this hallway  
And I got big plans so beg your pardon  
Cause next year this time Ima sell out the Garden  
  
Chorus  
  
Yo yo I aint gonna brag and boast and say I did it all  
But Im the only rapper to play Carnegie Hall  
The first rap group video cost a million  
First rapper to ever rep for the Haitians  
And sa fa say na boolay  
Grammy night we took 3 away  
22 million sold I cant believe this  
Theres still aint a rapper alive who could achieve this  
But I aint satisfied when back to my home contemplating  
How could I become the next Quincy Jones  
Thats when Jerry hit me up on the horn and said  
Clef your on the cover of  
the cover of The Source by The Rolling Stones  
No more struggling good life we loving it  
You could live it too if you only publish it  
So here we go so whats the scenario  
I own so many cars that Im renting em for videos  
  
Chorus
