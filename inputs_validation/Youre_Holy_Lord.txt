Verse 1  
Creation stands in awe of who You are  
The seas the mountains  
The sun the moon the stars  
The trees wave their branches in adoration to Your name  
The cry of all creation is the same  
  
Chorus  
Youre holy Lord  
Youre holy Lord  
We worship You  
In one accord  
Youre worthy to our praise afford  
For You are holy Lord  
  
Verse 2  
No greater praise could ever be heard  
Than the cry of sins redeemed soul  
See Im amazed by grace divine  
This praise I bring to You is mine  
No other name so worthy could I find  
  
Bridge  
The angels sit silent as we sing  
Lifting high the anthem of the redeemed  
Glory honor power be unto Your majesty  
As we cry holy  
  
Ending  
Holy Holy Holy  
There is none beside thee  
For You are holy  
You are holy  
You are holy Lord Lord Lord  
Holy Lord
