whos this guitarplaying sonsa bitch  is a question common asked  
On his head a bucket of chicken bones on his face a plaster mask  
Hes the bastard son of a preacher man on the town he left a stain  
They made him live in a chicken house to try to and hide the shame  
  
He was born in a coop raised in a cage children fear him critics rage  
Hes half alive hes half dead folks just call him buckethead  
  
Farmers would torment him as he snuggled with the hens  
Theyd hose him down with water and steal his little friends  
Now late at night hed sneak off to the graveyard all alone  
And play a soapbox guitar to the faces made of stone  
  
Buckethead found his freedom at the age of 17  
When he burned the chicked house down with a quart of gasoline  
He did puppet shows on corners and bought a real guitar  
And with the help of colonel sanders hes bound to be a star  
  
He was born in a coop raised in a cage children fear him critics rage  
Hes half alive hes half dead folks just call him buckethead
