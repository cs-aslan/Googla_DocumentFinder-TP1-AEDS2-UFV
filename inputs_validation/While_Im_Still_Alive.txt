Playing the game  
With the chips on my shoulder  
Checking in the mirror  
As my coffee cup gets colder  
  
Stagger and swagger  
Combing my hair  
If tomorrows not there  
Then at least todays all mine  
  
Chorus  
While Im still alive  
While Im still alive  
While Im still alive  
  
Strutting my stuff  
Im blagging the damage  
From coupling with headlines  
I was suckled on salvage  
  
The fightings exciting  
The age is dramatic  
Im crackling with static  
Just jiving to survive  
  
Chorus  
  
Take a stroll down the side roads I know you want to  
A shock in the dark can be good for your heart oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Scuffling along  
On the crest of a wave  
Laughing and grafting  
Or jerking and working  
  
Striking a match  
Where life is a gas  
I need the flash  
To make it all worthwhile  
  
Chorus
