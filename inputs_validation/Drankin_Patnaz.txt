And not once but twice am I back on line  
Remarkably delivering these words of mine  
And when I come forth I come with such a force  
You believe that its been nice since the last time you felt the need  
And thats to get loose and let you soul be free  
Cause when we step out in this vision you gon surely see  
And aint no way in hell we gon let that ride  
While you huggin on the wall bein cool denied  
Now it done jumped off in the blind of an eye  
And everybodys off the hook feelin good and high  
Cause its the last call for alcohol so just jook and drink  
and have a ball cause we gon party long until the wee hours  
And will it ever end I truly dont doubt it  
Youngbloodz is the truth you seen now go shout it  
And come back tomorrow and watch the world crowd it
