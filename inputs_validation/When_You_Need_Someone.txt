How does it feel to be on your own  
While the night slips away  
You toss and turn like a ship in a storm  
Have you lost your way  
  
I can see by the look in your eyes  
Youve been hurt before  
Hold me close like the very first time  
Cause thats what love is for  
  
Theres no reason to cry  
Cause Ill be there beside you  
When you need someone  
Id never leave you  
I swear that you will be the only one  
Through the sorrow and pain  
Just call out my name  
When you need somone  
Id stay forever  
I swear that you would never be the lonely one  
When you need someone  
  
Sometimes the world can be so cold  
And you just dont know why  
Youre reaching out but theres no one to hold  
And times rushin by  
  
Theres no reason to cry  
Cause Ill be there beside you  
When you need someone  
Id never leave you  
I swear that you will be the only one  
Through the sorrow and pain  
Just call out my name  
When you need somone  
Id stay forever  
I swear that you would never be the lonely one  
When you need someone  
  
When you need someone  
Its a long long day  
When you need someone  
Its a cryin shame  
When you need someone  
You can call out my name  
  
Theres no reason to cry  
Cause Ill be there beside you  
When you need someone  
Id never leave you  
I swear that you will be the only one  
Through the sorrow and pain  
Just call out my name  
When you need somone  
Id stay forever  
I swear that you would never be the lonely one  
When you need someone  
  
When you need someone  
Oh do ya need someone  
  
Id never leave you  
I swear that you will be the only one  
Through the sorrow and pain  
Just call out my name  
When you need someone  
Id stay forever  
I swear that you would never be the lonely one  
Do you need someone  
Do you need someone  
  
Ill stay forever  
Swear that you will be the only one  
Through the sorrow and pain  
Just call out my name  
When you need someone  
Please stay forever  
Swear that youll never be the lonley one  
Dont you need someone
