Im a wartime killer Im a man  
Im a peacetime killer  
Doin the best I can  
  
Bless yourself with a fiery hand  
Spit on the place you stand  
Dont make amends for what you do  
Or move on your demands  
Imagination running wild  
Were all an only child  
Product of our environment  
  
Cut blown and styled  
  
Im a wartime killer  
Im a man  
Im a peacetime killer  
  
Doin the best the best I can  
  
I adapt to nothing and nothing pleases me  
Im a loaded pistol  
Just you wait and see  
  
Infliction I am here  
Infection where do we go from here  
Inception made it clear  
As I move into the plan  
  
Hey Hey Hey  
At birth I made a deal  
Called into the killing fields I go  
  
Doin the best that I can  
  
Cut blown and stywhywhyyled  
  
Im a wartime killer  
Ya know what I am  
Im a peacetime killer  
Doin the best best that I can  
  
Ya Im a man  
Wartime killer  
Ya man
