Oohooh wouldnt tell you no lies  
Same end on another story  
II could have prophesised  
Id lose the prize  
  
IIm gonna raid the future  
Oohooh and I wanna know why  
Everything is so temporary  
Ooh those Ill let you know eyes  
I should have realized  
  
Im no hero  
I wont get the glory  
Im the one whos left behind  
Im no hero  
No place in your story  
Im the man whos left behind  
I must have been blind  
Must have been
