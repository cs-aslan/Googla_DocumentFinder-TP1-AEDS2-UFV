Angels and sailors  
Rich girls  
Backyard fences  
Tents  
Dreams watching each other narrowly  
Soft luxuriant cars  
Girls in garages stripped  
Out to get liquor and clothes  
Half gallons of wine and sixpacks of beer  
Jumped humped born to suffer  
Made to undress in the wilderness  
I will never treat you mean  
Never start no kind of scene  
Ill tell you every place and person that Ive been  
Always a playground instructor never a killer  
Always a bridesmaid on the verge of fame or over  
He maneuvered two girls into his hotel room  
One a friend the other the young one a newer stranger  
Vaguely Mexican or Puerto Rican  
Poor boys thighs and buttock scarred by a fathers belt  
Shes trying to rise  
Story of her boyfriend of teenage stoned death games  
Handsome lad dead in a car  
Confusion  
No connections  
Come ere  
I love you  
Peace on earth  
Will you die for me  
Eat me  
This way  
The end  
Ill always be true  
Never go out sneaking out on you babe  
If youll only show me Far Arden again  
Im surprised you could get it up  
He whips her lightly sardonically with belt  
Havent I been through enough she asks  
Now dressed and leaving  
The Spanish girl begins to bleed  
She says her period  
Its Catholic heaven  
I have an ancient Indian crucifix around my neck  
My chest is hard and brown  
Lying on stained wretched sheets with a bleeding virgin  
We could plan a murder  
Or start a religion
