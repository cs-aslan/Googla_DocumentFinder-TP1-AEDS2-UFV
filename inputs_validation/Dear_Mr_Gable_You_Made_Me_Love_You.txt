You made me love you  
I didnt want to do it  
I didnt want to do it  
You made me love you  
And all the time you knew it  
I guess you always knew it  
You made me happy sometimes  
You made me glad  
But there were times  
Dear you made me feel so bad  
You made me sigh for  
I didnt want to tell you  
I didnt want to tell you  
I want some love thats true  
Yes I do deed I do  
You know I do  
Give me give me  
Give me what I cry for  
You know you got the brand of kisses that Id die for  
You know you made me love you
