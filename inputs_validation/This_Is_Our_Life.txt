Baby this is our life  
And I still believe that love is the answer  
This is our life  
I sit alone on the balcony  
In the middle of the night  
And everything is calm  
And everything is right  
Thinking back on the time  
I was depending on somebody  
Tellin me what to do  
I know what to do  
Because were born with freedom  
We can live our lives  
The way we want  
And just the way we feel  
We will discover the truth  
For me its love  
My love is true  
Baby this is our life  
I still believe that love is the answer  
This is our life  
I still believe our love will last forever  
This is our life  
Baby this is our life  
This is our life  
Were heading into the future  
But were running out of time  
And were running out of gas  
We forget why were here  
If we stop for a moment  
Give it all up for care  
Im taking care of you  
Take good care of me  
Because were born with freedom  
We can live our lives  
The way we want  
And just the way we feel  
And if we follow our heart  
We will discover the truth  
For me its love  
My love is true  
Take care of yourself  
Be nice to your friends  
And visit your relatives once in a while  
Give love to your family  
Take care of your baby  
Dont be afraid to open your heart
