Can you hear me  
Call my name twice  
Can you feel me  
I treat you so nice  
When youre up here  
I feel its getting cold  
Come around me  
And you will see my world  
  
Move with me to the left  
And then move with move with  
Move with me to the right  
Move with me to the left  
And then move with move with  
Move with me to the right  
  
Just dance

So sexy  
  
Move with me to the left  
And then move with move with  
Move with me to the right  
Move with me to the left  
And then move with move with  
Move with me to the right  
  
Just dance

So sexy  
  
Move with me to the left  
And then move with move with  
Move with me to the right  
Move with me to the left  
And then move with move with  
Move with me to the right
