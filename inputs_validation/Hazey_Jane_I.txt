Do you curse where you come from  
Do you swear in the night  
Will it mean much to you  
If I treat you right  
Do you like what youre doing  
Would you do it some more  
Or will you stop once and wonder  
What youre doing it for  
Hey slow Jane make sense  
Slow slow Jane cross the fence  
  
Do you feel like a remnant  
Of something thats past  
Do you find things are moving  
Just a little too fast  
Do you hope to find new ways  
Of quenching your thirst  
Do you hope to find new ways  
Of doing better than your worst  
Hey slow Jane let me prove  
Slow slow Jane were on the move  
  
Do it for you  
Sure that you would do the same for me one day  
So try to be true  
Even if its only in your hazey way  
  
Can you tell if youre moving  
With no mirror to see  
If youre just riding a new man  
Looks a little like me  
Is it all so confusing  
Is it hard to believe  
When the winter is coming  
Can you sign up and leave  
Hey slow Jane live your lie  
Slow slow jane fly on by
