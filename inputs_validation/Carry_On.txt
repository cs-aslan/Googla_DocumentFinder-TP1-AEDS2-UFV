Carry on  
  
So what can I do what can I say  
Do I have to stand and  
Watch you walk away  
I know theres got to be  
A better way  
I just cant go on living for today  
  
I thought I heard a voice  
Out on the wind  
And Im sure I heard it say  
Id find a friend  
And it said Id find  
The answers in the end  
All I gotta do is carry on  
  
Carry on carry on the time is flyin  
You need another love  
Maybe another town  
Carry on carry on  
Dont wait until your hope is gone  
When your last chance  
Comes round  
  
Im gonna keep on looking  
I wont quit  
Aggravation  
It aint gonna hurt a bit  
And I believe that  
I have seen the last of it  
Theres nothing left to do  
But carry on
