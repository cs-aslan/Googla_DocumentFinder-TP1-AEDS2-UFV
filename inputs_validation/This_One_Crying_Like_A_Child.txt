How can I put this I I I  
Im an independent woman I  
Ive been crying like a child  
I just wanted you to know the person that I am  
More than any other your fans  
I would love you for a thousand years  
Yours truly  
  
I aint gonna play it cool  
Let me tell you Ive tried that  
Already  
Every day and every night your words  
Ring through me  
Who am I trying to fool honey Ive been living on my own  
like Freddy  
But Im still a woman baby tell me how  
  
How could I ever love another  
How could you say you dont remember  
God knows Id give anything  
For just one more night together  
Today Ill miss you more than ever  
How could you say you dont remember  
This ones for the happiness Ill be wishing you forever  
  
Its just another Friday night  
For you and your accessory  
And there you are before my eyes  
Two hours and for fifteen minutes you are here  
I dont wanna scream lest I should tear  
A whisper in the darkness disappears  
Sincerely  
  
We should get back on the road  
Like Simon and Garfunkel  
Lets get married  
You were all the shelter that I need above me  
Who am I trying to fool  
Honey Ive got your ring tone on my  
Blackberry  
And I wont give a damn if only I knew how  
  
How could I ever love another  
How could you say you dont remember  
God knows Id give anything  
For just one more night together  
Today Ill miss you more than ever  
How could you say you dont remember  
This ones for the happiness Ill be wishing you forever  
  
You got me crying like a child  
Aint no need for me to lie  
A hundred jpeg files fillin up my herddrive  
You got me crying like a child  
And the crowd is going wild  
This one this is the one  
Come on and give it up  
  
How could I ever love another  
How could you say you dont remember  
God knows Id give anything  
For just one more night together  
Today Ill miss you more than ever  
How could you say you dont remember  
This ones for the happiness Ill be wishing you forever  
  
How could I ever love another  
How could you say you dont remember  
God knows Id give anything  
For just one more night together  
Today Ill miss you more than ever  
How could you say you dont remember  
This ones for the happiness Ill be wishing you forever
