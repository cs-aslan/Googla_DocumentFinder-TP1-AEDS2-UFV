Its midnight now and Im still all alone  
Its always late each night when you come home  
I stay and take each heartache that you give cause God gave me a heart to
forgive  
Yes I could call these tears my closest friends  
They stay with me till you come home again  
You brought me every misry that there is but God gave me a heart to forgive  
You hurt me as much as you can  
Then you tell me that youre just weak like any other man  
Still youre the only reason that I live and God gave me a heart to forgive  
 steel   
You hurt me as much as you can
