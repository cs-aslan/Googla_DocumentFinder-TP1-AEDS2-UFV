Used to be that I believed in something  
Used to be that I believed in love  
Its been a long time since Ive had that feeling  
I could love someone  
I could trust someone  
I said Id never let nobody near my heart again darlin  
I said Id never let nobody in  
  
But if you asked me to  
I just might change my mind  
And let you in my life forever  
If you asked me to  
I just might give my heart  
And stay here in your arms forever  
If you asked me to  
If you asked me to  
  
Somehow ever since Ive been around you  
Cant go back to being on my own  
Cant help feeling darlin since Ive found you  
That Ive found my home  
That Im finally home  
I said Id never let nobody get too close to me darlin  
I said I needed needed to be free  
  
But if you asked me to  
  
Ask me to I will give my world to you baby  
I need you now  
Ask me to Ill do anything for you baby  
For you baby  
  
If you asked me to  
Id let you in my life forever  
If you asked me to
