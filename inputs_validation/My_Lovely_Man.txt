I used to shout  
Across the room to you  
And youd come dancin  
Like a fool  
Shuffle step  
You funky mother  
Come to me  
All warm as covers  
  
Rest with me  
My lovely brother  
For you see  
There is no other  
Memory so sad and sweet  
Ill see you soon  
Save me a seat  
  
Well Im cryin  
Now my lovely man  
Yes Im cryin  
Now and no one can  
Ever fill the  
The hole you left my man  
Ill see you later  
My lovely man if I can  
  
In my room  
Im all alone  
Waiting for you  
To get home  
  
Listen to Roberta Flack  
But I know you wont come back  
  
Well Im cryin  
Now my lovely man  
Yes Im cryin  
  
Just in case  
You never knew  
I miss you slim  
  
I love you too  
See my heart  
Its black and blue  
When I die  
I will find you  
  
Well Im cryin  
Now my lovely man  
Yes Im cryin  
Now and no one can  
Ever fill the  
The hole you left my man  
Ill see you later  
My lovely man if I can
