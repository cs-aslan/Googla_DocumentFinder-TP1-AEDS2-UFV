You were the first  
And you taught me how to love  
And youll always stay close to my heart  
But it would not be fair it I wouldnt tell you now  
  
That its over baby its over  
  
You took this lonely child  
And you taught it how to feel  
You took the rain clouds from my eyes  
You made fantasy seem real  
Still it hurts me so inside  
But I cant change and I cant hide  
  
That its over maybe its over  
  
Oh now I know youre not the one  
Its me  
Ive changed inside  
I feel a need to be free  
Its over  
Maybe baby its over  
  
I was a lonely girl  
Just calling out for him  
You taught me how to live  
You taught me how to love myself  
Still it hurts me so inside  
But I cant change and I cant hide  
  
Thats its over baby its over  
  
Oh now I know youre not the one  
Its me  
Ive changed changed inside  
I feel a need to be free  
  
Its over  
Maybe baby its over  
Its over  
Please dont hate me  
But its over  
  
Dont you know that I love you  
Dont you know that I care  
Dont you know that I love you  
But I cant always be there  
It aint you  
No its me  
Gonna fly like a bird  
Fly like a bird  
Yeah I must be free
