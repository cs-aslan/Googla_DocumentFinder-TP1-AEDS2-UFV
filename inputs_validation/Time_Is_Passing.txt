Im playing my guitar while my sister bangs the jar  
The glass sets up a sound like people laughing  
Its going to my brain and its easing all my pain  
I must hear this sound again cause time is passing  
Mmm  
Im walking by the sea and the shingle sings for me  
The crabs are swimming down among the starfish  
The rocks all clatter down and the seagulls fly around  
But the whole trip rubs it in that time is passing passing  
Find it I got to hear it all again  
My heart has heard the sound of harmony  
Blind to it as my tears fall again  
Its only by the music Ill be free  
Theres something in the whisper of the trees  
Millions hear it still they cant believe  
There are echoes of it splashing in the waves  
As an empire of dead men leave their graves  
Dont listen to people talk dont listen to em selling souls  
Dont listen to me or words from men above  
Dont hear it in your needs and dont hear it in your greeds  
Just hear it in the sound of time apassing  
Find it I got to hear it all again  
My heart has heard the sound of harmony  
Blind to it as my tears fall again  
Its only by the music Ill be free
