This old heart of mine been broke a thousand times  
Each time you break away I feel youre gone to stay  
Lonely nights that come memories that flow  
Bringin ya back again hurting me more and more  
  
Maybe its my mistake to show this love that I feel inside  
cause each day that passes by  
Ya got me never knowin if Im comin or goin cause  
  
I love you yes I do  
This old heart ooh  
I love you yes I do  
Yes I do wait for me  
  
I try hard to hide my hurt inside  
This old heart of mine always keep me cryin  
The way youre treatin me leaves me incomplete  
Yeah youre here for the day gone for the week  
  
But if you leave me a hundred times  
A hundred times Ill take you back  
Im yours whenever you want  
Im not too proud to shout it tell the world about it cause  
  
I love you  
This old heart this old heart waits for you  
And I love ya  
  
I love you hoo hoo  
This old heart waits for you  
  
This old heart of mine been broke a thousand times  
Each time you break away I feel youre gone to stay  
Lonely nights that come memories that flow  
Bringin ya back again hurtin me more and more  
  
Maybe its my mistake to show this love I feel inside girl  
Cause each day that passes by  
Ya got me never knowin if Im comin or goin cause  
  
I love you yes I do old heart of mine waits for you
