Dolly Parton  
In my mind Ive made love to you often  
But only in my mind can it be so  
Cause theres someone at home thats countin on me  
And if I did Im sure that he would know  
Yes he would know yes he could tell  
For he has loved me long enough to know me very well  
And if I lied hed see it in my eyes  
I know my guilt would show and he would know  
But I must admit youre someone very special  
And it would be so easy to let go  
Makin love to you could be so easy  
But if I did Im sure that he would know  
Yes he would know yes he could tell  
For he has loved me long enough to know me very well  
And if I lied hed see it in my eyes  
I know my guilt would show and he would know  
My conscience just wont let me make love to you  
I know it would be sweet but I just cant  
When I go home to him I must be able  
To look him in the eyes and say I aint  
Cause he would know yes he could tell  
For he has loved me long enough to know me very well  
And if I lied hed see it in my eyes  
I know my guilt would show and he would know  
He would know
