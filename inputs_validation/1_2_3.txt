From the bowery to the brimstone I tried to find your heart  
With drugs of initiation bottom of the barrel that drops  
I understand your causes sympathize the motivation  
But all the details of this war are just selfinfatuation

Nothings for free

Pick up the sticks and go home  
Manic blood runs thick my friend are you looking for a clean escape  
Whats left when the locks have all been broken young children of authority  
How long can you be agile dancing between the alter and the mercy seat  
Heres a chance to make a choice are you aware of the fire beneath your feet

Pick up the sticks and go home  
The basement lies within us the fear comes through the door  
Theres nothing left between us the fear becomes a roar  
Once that wheel is in motion dont you lose what you have found  
Im talking about that burning wheel of tongues everything that makes it go  
around  
Were all born in the devils scorn they want to see you die  
Are you true Everything they say is a lie
