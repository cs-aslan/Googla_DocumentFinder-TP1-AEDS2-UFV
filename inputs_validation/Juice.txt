Yeh ah Ah  
Boy wonder Drizzy  
Ah Ah Uh  
  
Yall aint really like me  
I can understand  
My flow is sitting right inside da pocket on ma pants  
Im still fly you cant float  
Run this ship you same boat  
A write your favorite records aah you singin thoses  
20 thousand for a verse is our routine quote  
Im getting rich aah you staying broke  
Chilling if even if Im in a goosed down coat  
I cant see you through the Mosley Tribes  
So I dont even flinch when you throw me hi fives  
They try to measure up but theres no my size  
Whatever 40 smokin bout to low my eyes  
Beast mode on them a never take a night off  
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off  
Grounded as the one way pavement am taking flight off  
Baby go ahead and cut the lights off  
Cuz Its about to go  
  
Beat plays  
  
I hear ma phone ringing when they call  
I aint picking up or entertaining them at all  
Got your girl face down and banging on the wall  
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall  
Hmmm hmmm hmmmmmm  
I cannot relate  
Riding with some tags that a got from outastate  
Riding with a swag that a got from outaspace  
Just show me whos the hottest Ima knock him out his place  
Call me homeside drizzy about to kill your ego  
Im about ma green puffin goody like Im celo  
You can go and take a glance at your hero  
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero  
Fantasy to you reality to me  
And yeah ma gpass is as valid as can be  
Im Im so fresh a stylist would agree  
Waving at your girl  
While shes smiling back at me like
