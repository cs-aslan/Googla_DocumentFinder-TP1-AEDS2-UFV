Everybody says  
That when it comes to friends  
The truest ones are counted on one hand  
But take a look around  
Before you hit the ground  
The only one youll see will be this man  
  
Yeah Ill catch you when you fall  
Cause Im the one who loves you  
Youll never wonder if I care  
Ill always be there  
Standin there in losin ground  
Im your best friend now  
And I wont let you down no oh  
  
Yes Ive been a fool  
But Ive learned what not to do  
Dont take for granted those who keep their faith in you  
And if you lose your way  
On some rainy day  
Just look above  
And I will be the sunshine breakin through  
  
Yeah Ill catch you when you fall  
Cause Im the one who loves you  
Youll never wonder if I care  
Ill always be there  
Standin there in losin ground  
Im your best friend now  
And I wont let you down  
  
And every step along the highway  
Of your life  
Ill be the man standing beside you  
Believe me that I will  
Dont forget you came and you saved me  
You saved my life  
  
Yeah Ill catch you when you fall  
Cause Im the one who loves you  
Youll never wonder if I care  
Ill always be there  
Standin there in losin ground  
Cause Im your best friend now  
And I wont let you  
I will not let you  
I wont let you down
