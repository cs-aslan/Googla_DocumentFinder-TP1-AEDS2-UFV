Something that is gone  
Something that is gone  
Something that I had just yesterday  
But where I must have laid it  
I really couldnt say  
Something that was right  
But now is wrong  
Something that is gone  
  
Something that I lost  
Something that I lost  
Something that I cradled in my hand  
Something rather special  
That pertained to all my plans  
Im left here wondering what on earth it was  
Something that I lost  
  
Something that I missed  
Something that I missed  
Ive looked all around my room  
But its not here  
How can a thing of permanence  
So swiftly disappear   
Something is the cause of all of this  
Something that I missed
