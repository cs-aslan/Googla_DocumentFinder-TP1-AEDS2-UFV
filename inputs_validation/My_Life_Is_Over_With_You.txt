You want to explain thats why you called  
Save your breath it doesnt matter at all  
Not now my friend  
  
You played your cards and you made your choice  
I dont want to listen to your voice  
Not now my friend  
  
Ive found a new part to play in life  
Theres different actors on my stage  
Ill set the pace in a world without you  
I dont want to hear the things that you say  
cause my life is over with you  
  
Now you know whats on my mind  
Dont call again cause you will find  
I wont be here  
  
You chose your path to walk along  
Now I can sing a different song  
I hope thats clear  
  
Chorus  
Ive found a new part to play in life  
Theres different actors on my stage  
  
Good bye my love and dont feel sad  
Just because Im feeling glad  
That youre not here  
  
Youll go your way and Ill go mine  
Maybe well meet some other time  
Goodbye my love  
  
Chorus
