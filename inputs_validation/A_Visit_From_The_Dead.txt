It must be summer the sky is clear  
The garden is so beautiful  
All the flowers and all the trees  
Make Me feel like theyre inside of Me  
Im holding My sisters hand  
While were playing in the sand  
Its all but a dream  
  
My bed is moving I cannot see a thing  
I am in total darkness someone is calling  
I can feel the chill its all around Me  
I know its not a dream No no no  
  
Someone is in My room  
Standing at the end of My bed  
Must be a visit from the dead  
Must be a visit from the dead  
  
Now I see her figure its just a little child  
And theres no reflection shes in the mirror  
Could it really be has she returned  
My little sister  
  
King beware something bad is coming Your way  
King beware  
Must be a visit from the dead  
Must be a visit from the dead  
Missy will You tell Me  
You know we dont have no secrets  
Just beware  
  
Must be a visit from the dead  
Must be a visit from the dead  
Youve to to tell Me Missy  
Come on now spit out little girl  
  
I will send You a dream
