I guess Ill go to California  
Seems like Im always on the run  
Nobody ever needs a loser  
We just exist under the sun  
But someday somehow someone may need me  
When my drifting days are done  
  
Well Im aimlessly drifting  
Looks like I live from day to day  
Hard as I try to make a showing  
Something is always in my way  
Even the one I truly love now  
Deals in the games that people play  
  
Every time I love I always lose  
Seems like Ill never ever win  
Each I hear them lonesome blues  
Im all alone at home again  
Seems like Im just existing  
Aimlessly drifting to no end  
  
All that I ask of this old world  
Is just to have a happy home  
All that I ask of one little girl  
Is just to be my very own  
It seems just like Im just existing  
Aimlessly drifting along  
  
Yes Ill go to California  
Seems like Im always on the run  
Nobody ever needs a loser  
I just exist under the sun  
But someday somehow someone may need me  
But my drifting days be done
