Ive been thinking bout yu oh baby  
And I wonder where you are tonight  
Tryin to live without you its crazy  
Cause no one else can light my fire  
  
More than a few  
Have been willing to do just what I wanted  
But as hard as they try  
It just aint right oh baby  
  
I cant be loved  
By anyone but you oh baby baby  
Its not enough  
There aint no substitute for you  
I cant be loved by anyone but you  
I just cant live without your love  
  
My emotions baby are showing  
No one seems to understand  
This commotion darlin keeps growing  
Im afraid its getting out of hand  
  
Putting aside all the pain and the pride  
And I still want you and I need you tonight  
  
Cant be loved  
There aint no chance for new romance  
Cant be loved  
It just aint love with someone else
