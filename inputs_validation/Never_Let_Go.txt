Ive had my chances too many nights  
All these broken dreams theyre just drifting away  
But Id do it all again just to hear hear you say  
  
Chorus  
Never let never let you go  
I will never let never let you go  
I will never let never let you go  
  
Everyone tells me Im a fool to myself  
But I never listen to a word that they say  
cause Ive heard it a million times before  
And Id give everything away if you will say  
  
Chorus  
  
Never ever let  
Tell me that youll never let you go  
Say youll not leave me baby  
  
Never let  
Never ever let you go  
I will never let  
Never let you go
