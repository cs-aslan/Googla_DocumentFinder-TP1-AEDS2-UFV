And everybody say say  
I know you I know you  
  
I know youre thinking thinking that it must be  
Im a raw flow cause it never get rusty  
I aint gotta say it man dawg trust me  
Bust somebody head TLC where was we  
  
Still rock the Prada fore that rock the Starter  
Niggas out in Georgetown and Magic way harder  
Thinking back to the projects and they way they tore em all up  
Like when I do a project and come back and tear the mall up  
  
We coming from the  
Southside southside  
Southside southside  
Southside southside south  
  
Side of the broads the cars the half moon the stars  
Im like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars  
Burn CDs with no regard for the stars  
Come to the grip with conflict diamonds and the arts  
  
Back in 94 they call me ChiTowns Nas  
Now them niggas know Im one of ChiTowns gods  
We even yo you still talking no cops  
A conscious nigga with mac like Steven Jobs  
  
We coming from the  
Southside southside  
Southside southside  
Southside southside southside side of the Chi  
  
Your fly is open McFly  
The crowd is open I think I know why  
Im back from the future seen it with my own eyes  
And yep Im still the future of the Chi  
  
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon  
I knew that I couldnt cop a coup with no coupons  
Look at that neutron on his green like two dimes  
People asking him Do you have any gray poupon  
  
We coming from the  
Southside southside  
Southside southside  
Southside southside southside side of the Chi  
  
You in the building but the buildings falling  
You wouldnt be balling if your name is Spalding  
My mind get flooded I think about New Orleans  
Back in school yall niggas you should call him August  
  
Im the sun that goes down but Im still revolving  
Southside bout to walk it out I still get crawling  
If rap was Harlem Id be James Baldwin  
With money in the bank like G Rap were calling  
  
We coming from the  
Southside southside  
Southside southside  
Southside southside southside of the Chi  
  
With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera  
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas  
Cant wait til they say Yeah he ran up at the Oscars  
Poppa I heard his life is like a movie  
  
Like when Em played him and Mekhi played a rasta  
Mexicans dont love it like it was for La Raza  
But this is for the mobsters holla  
We some true ChiTown legends accept no Incomprehensible  
  
We coming from the  
Southside southside  
Southside southside  
Southside southside southside of the Chi  
  
The unAmerican Idol Tower like the Eiffel  
Lean Wit it Rock Wit It black like the Disciples  
Know when to use a Bible and when to use a rifle  
You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle  
  
Caught a case of robbery and Beat It like Michael  
Your career is a typo mine was written like a haiku  
I write to Do the Right Things like Spike do  
Through conflicts is crucial and trauma is psycho  
  
We coming from the  
Southside southside  
Southside southside  
Southside southside southside of the Chi  
  
Were coming from the  
Incomprehensible spice it up  
You might have to spice it up  
Spice it up spice it up take your life and  
  
Yo were coming from the  
Were coming from the
