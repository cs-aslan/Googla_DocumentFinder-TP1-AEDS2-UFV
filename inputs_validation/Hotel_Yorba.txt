I was watching  
With one eye on the other side  
I had fifteen people telling me to move  
I got moving on my mind  
I found shelter  
In some thoughts turning wheels around  
I said thirty nine times that I love you  
To the beauty I had found  
  
Well its one two three four  
Take the elevator  
At the Hotel Yorba  
Ill be glad to see you later  
All they got inside is vacancy  
  
Ive been thinking  
Of a little place down by the lake  
They got a dirty little road leading up to the house  
I wonder how long it will take till were alone  
Sitting on the front porch of that home  
Stomping our feet on the wooden boards  
Never gonna worry about locking the door  
  
Well its one two three four  
Take the elevator  
At the Hotel Yorba  
Ill be glad to see you later  
All they got inside is vacancy  
  
It might sound silly  
For me to think childish thoughts like these  
But Im so tired of acting tough  
And Im gonna do what I please  
Lets get married  
In a big cathedral by a priest  
Cause if Im the man that you love the most  
You can say I do at least  
  
Well its one two three four  
Take the elevator  
At the Hotel Yorba  
Ill be glad to see you later  
All they got inside is vacancy  
  
And its four five six seven  
Grab your umbrella  
Grab hold of me  
Cause Im your favorite fella  
All they got inside is vacancy
