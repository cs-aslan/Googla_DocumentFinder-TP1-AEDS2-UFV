The sun just slipped its note below my door  
And I cant hide beneath my sheets  
Ive read the words before so now I know  
The time has come again for me  
  
And Im feelin the same way all over again  
Feelin the same way all over again  
Singin the same lines all over again  
No matter how much I pretend  
  
Another day that I cant find my head  
My feet dont look like theyre my own  
Ill try and find the floor below to stand  
And I hope I reach it once again  
  
And Im feelin the same way all over again  
Feelin the same way all over again  
Singin the same lines all over again  
No matter how much I pretend  
  
Yeah oh yeah  
  
So many times I wonder where Ive gone  
And how I found my way back in  
I look around awhile for something lost  
Maybe Ill find it in the end  
  
And Im feelin the same way all over again  
Feelin the same way all over again  
Singin the same lines all over again  
No matter how much I pretend  
  
Feelin the same way all over again  
Feelin the same way all over again  
Singin the same lines all over again  
No matter how much I pretend  
No matter how much I pretend
