If it came to pass that they should ask  
What could I tell them  
Would they criticize behind my back  
Maybe I should let them  
Oh if only then and only then  
They would understand  
Theyd turn a fullblooded city boy  
Into a fullblooded city man  
  
If they could face it  
I could take it in their eyes  
Oh I know Id make it  
Their tiny minds  
And sacred cows just fake it  
If only then and only then  
They would understand  
Theyd turn a fullblooded city boy  
Into a fullblooded city man  
  
But I know the way they want me  
In the way they publicize  
If they could turn their focus off  
To the image in their eyes  
Maybe it would help them help them understand  
Maybe it would help them help them understand  
Maybe it would help them help them understand  
That a fullblooded city boy  
Is now a fullblooded city man  
  
Oh my soul  
Oh my soul  
Oh my soul
