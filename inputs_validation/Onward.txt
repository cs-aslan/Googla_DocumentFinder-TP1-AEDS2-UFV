Contained in everything I do  
Theres a love I feel for you  
Proclaimed in everything I write  
Youre the light  
Burning brightly  
Onward through the night  
Onward through the night  
Onward through the night of my life  
  
Displayed in all the things I see  
Theres a love you show to me  
Portrayed in all the things you say  
Youre the day  
Leading the way  
Onward through the night  
Onward through the night  
Onward through the night of my life  
  
Onward through the night  
Onward through the night  
Onward through the night of my life
