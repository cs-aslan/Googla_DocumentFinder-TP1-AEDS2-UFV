The strange logic in your clumsiest line  
It stayed it stayed it stayed emblazoned on my mind  
You say break up the family  
And lets begin to live our lives  
  
I want to see all my friends tonight  
It wasnt youth it wasnt life  
Born old sadly wise  
Resigned well we were  
To ending our lives  
Im so glad to grow older  
To move away from those awful times  
I want to see all my friends tonight  
  
Yes you found love but you werent  
At peace with your life  
Home late full of hate  
Despise the ties that bind  
Im so glad to grow older  
To move away from those younger years  
Im in love for the first time  
And I dont feel bad  
  
Let me see all my old friends  
Let me put my arms around them  
Cause I really do love them  
Now does that sound mad  
Captain of games solid framed  
I stood on the touchline  
Hailstones driven home  
In a car  no brakes I dont mind  
Im so glad to grow older  
To move away from those darker years  
Oh Im in love for the first time  
And I dont feel bad  
So wish me luck my friends  
Goodbye  
So wish me luck again  
Goodbye  
Wish me luck my friends  
Goodbye  
Mmm wish me luck my friends  
Goodbye  
Ahh  
Ahh
