My momma was raised in the era when  
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin  
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help  
But they wasnt satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself  
You see its broke nigga racism  
Thats that Dont touch anything in the store  
And this rich nigga racism  
Thats that Come in please buy more  
What you want a Bentley Fur coat A diamond chain  
All you blacks want all the same things  
Used to only be niggas now everybody playing  
Spending everything on Alexander Wang  
New Slaves  
  
You see theres leaders and theres followers  
But Id rather be a dick than a swallower
