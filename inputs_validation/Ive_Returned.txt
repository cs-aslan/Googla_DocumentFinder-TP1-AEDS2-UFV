Ive returned  
Ive returned  
Ive returned  
  
Last night I played the drunken fiddle  
Disabled love with a word of dribble  
On and on about some jumbled subject  
I said your friends were a bunch of muppets  
  
Said your sister shouldve grown a moustache  
Said you didnt need to take off your mask  
Down the staircase I made my stagger  
I left you cryin but it didnt matter  
  
And so I sat inside my car in wonder  
A headache in my head like the thunder  
I chewed my nails like a guilty victim  
I couldnt see or feel the night or nothin  
I wanted to explain but oh so clever  
Love was like it was some endeavor  
Then I dont remember who said what when  
On a stack of paper I placed my pen  
  
And when I woke up in the mornin  
Beside you in the bed  
My mouth was full of nothin  
My arms around your head  
I dont know how I got there  
But I didnt want to check  
Now back between each other  
Were salvaging our wreck  
Now Ive returned  
  
You throw our jigsaw all over the floor  
Were at the deepest deep  
I thought our love had died forever  
But it just went to sleep  
  
Ive returned  
Ive returned  
Ive returned  
Ive returned  
Ive returned
