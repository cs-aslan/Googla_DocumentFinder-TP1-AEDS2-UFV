Ive traveled all around the world  
And there are places that still stand out to me  
But nowhere else can quite compare  
To my island in the sea  
  
My personal utopia a place to run to  
Where I can hide away  
Where I can truly reign supreme  
somewhere fresh and clean  
Where a man can dream  
  
Chorus  
Im king king of somewhere hot  
Dontcha know  
Im king like every man should be  
Im king king of somewhere hot  
Way to go  
Where the music in my soul  
makes me start to lose control  
I could melt right on the spot  
Im king of somewhere hot  
  
Someday I hope to find my queen  
I know shell come my way  
Ill give her all my love  
Its not a complicated thing  
just a place where I can swing  
Where a man can be a king  
  
Chorus  
Im king king of somewhere hot  
Dont cha know  
Im king like every man should be  
Im king king of somewhere hot  
Way to go  
O dont care how hard you look  
you wont find me in the book  
I could melt right on the spot  
Im the king of somewhere hot
