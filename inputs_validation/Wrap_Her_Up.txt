Duet with Elton John  
  
There are ladies illegal Xs  
Mona Lisas well connected  
They may be shady English roses  
Blue blooded turned up noses  
  
Money talks see what it catches  
Postage paid no strings attached  
Shes a honey shes a tramp  
Roaring twenties molls and vamps  
  
Wrap her up Ill take her home with me  
Wrap her up she is all I need  
Wrap her up I only get one chance  
Beasts and beauties but they all can dance  
  
Wrap her up Ill taker her home with me  
Wrap her up she is all I need  
Wrap her up  
Give her to me wrap her up  
  
Is she foreign legs eleven  
Italian girls take me to heaven  
You pretty babies from Paris France  
Crazy horses love to dance
