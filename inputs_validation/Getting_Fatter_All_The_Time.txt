Im getting fatter all the time  
I used to be size 32 and I never gave  
My jeans used to fit I looked cool  
Now Im not the same  
Put on a few pounds my shapes getting round  
And lately I cant see my shoes  
I hate to admit but Im getting fatter fatter  
A little fatter all the time  
I cant lose no weight  
Yes I admit Im getting fatter fatter Im getting fatter  
I love to dine That meats pretty cruel to my waistline  
Im driving a steak through my heart  
Eating things that I love  
Man I was lean but I dug french cuisine  
Now Im big as the Michelin Man  
I admit Im getting fatter fatter  
Im getting fatter all the time  
I cant skip desert Now I dont dare get on a ladder  
Fatter Im getting fatter  
It aint no crime getting so much fatter all the time  
Im getting fatter all the time  
Fatter fatter fatter  
Im getting fatter all the time  
Fatter fatter fatter  
Getting so much fatter all the time
