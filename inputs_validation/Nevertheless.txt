Maybe Im right and maybe Im wrong  
Maybe Im weak or maybe Im strong  
Nevertheless Im in love with you  
  
Maybe Ill win or maybe Ill lose  
Maybe Im in for crying the blues  
Nevertheless Im in love with you  
  
Somehow I know at a glance  
The terrible chances Im taking  
Fine at the start that left  
With a heart that is breaking  
  
Maybe Ill live a life of regret  
And maybe Ill give much more than I get  
But nevertheless Im in love with you  
  
Somehow I know at a glance  
The terrible chances Im taking  
Fine at the start but then left  
With a heart thats breaking  
  
Maybe Ill live a life of regret  
And maybe Ill give much more than I get  
But nevertheless Im in love with you  
Nevertheless Im in love with you
