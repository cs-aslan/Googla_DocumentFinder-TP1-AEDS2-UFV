Hold my hand feel the touch of your body cling to mine  
You and me makin love all the way through another night  
I remember you and I walking though the park at night  
Kiss and touch nothing much let it blow just touch and go  
  
Love me more never leave me alone by house of love  
People talk people say what we have is just a game  
Oh Ill never let you go come here girl  
Just got to make sweet love til the break of dawn  
  
Chorus  
I dont want the sun to shine I want to make love  
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart  
I dont know what Im gonna do I cant stop lovin you  
I wont stop til break of dawn makin love  
  
Hold my hand feel the sweat yes youve got me nervous yet  
Let me groove let me soothe let me take you on a cruise  
Theres imagination workin never been there before  
Have you ever wanted to dream about those places youve never know  
  
Break of dawn theres no sun up in the sky  
Break of dawn I can see it in your eyes  
Break of dawn girl you got to understand  
Its the way that I love you let me show you Im your man  
Break of dawn  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Lets not wait the sun is out lets get up and lets get out  
Its the day a brand new day lets both go outside and play  
Let us walk down the park makin love til its dark  
Can you move can you soothe til the break of dawn and you know its true
oh  
  
Chorus x3
