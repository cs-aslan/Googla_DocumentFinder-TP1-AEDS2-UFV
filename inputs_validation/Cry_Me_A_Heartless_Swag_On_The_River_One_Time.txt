How could you be so heartless Oh  
How could you be so heartless  
  
You were my sun  
You were my earth  
But you didnt know all the ways I loved you no  
So you took a chance  
And made other plans  
I bet you didnt think that they would come crashing down no  
  
You know why  
Cause in the night I hear them talk  
The coldest story ever told  
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul  
To a woman so heartless  
How could you be so heartless Oh  
How could you be so heartless  
  
Thats why I said  
Hopped up out the bed  
Turn my swag on  
Take a look in mirror said whats up  
Yeah Im gettin money Ohh Ohhh  
  
I want the money money and the cars  
Cars and the clothes the shows I suppose  
I just wanna be I just wanna be successful  
I just wanna be I just wanna be successful yeah said  
I just wanna be I just wanna be successful
