Hail to the taxis  
They go where I go  
Farewell the newspapers that know more than I know  
Flung under a streetlamp still burning at dawn  
Im in the mood again  
  
I walk the damp streets rather than slumber  
Along the fine windows of shameless and plunder  
But none of their riches could ever compare  
Im in the mood again  
  
I dont know whats come over me  
But its nothing that Im doing wrong  
You took the breath right out of me  
Now youll find it in the early hours  
In a lovers song  
  
I lay my head down on fine linens and satin  
Away from the madhatters who live in Manhattan  
The Empire State Building illuminating the sky  
Im in the mood  
Im in the mood  
Im in the mood again
