When you say you do  
Makes me want to spend life with you  
I never knew life could be so good  
When you say you care  
Want to be right there beside you  
And show the world  
Youve been good to me  
And you know I do  
  
All my love  
You are my love  
Without your love I go nowhere  
All my love  
You are my life  
You are the girl Im dreaming of  
Youre the one I really love  
I do love you  
I do love you  
I do love you  
I do love you  
  
When you say its true  
Lets me know well be forever  
Insightful joy  
Of a love so good  
Want to be right there beside you  
And tell the world  
Youve been good to me  
And you know I do  
  
All my love  
You are my love  
Without your love I go nowhere  
All my love  
You are my live  
You are the girl Im dreaming of  
Youre the one I really love  
I do love you  
I do love you  
I do love you  
I do love you
