Uh oh here she come  
She got them gold hot pants on again  
Yeah man  
I wanna talk but I dunno  
Shes a Peach  
She was dark she was tan  
She made me glad to be a man  
She was young she was smart  
Just one glance and she stole my heart  
The kinda girl you wanna teach  
Shes a Peach  
Summertime feelin fine getting wild  
All thats on my mind  
Here she come dressed in red  
Get her done is all thats in my head  
Her hot pants cant hide her cheeks  
Shes a Peach  
She was pure every ounce  
I was sure when her titties bounced  
Every way shes a winner  
Turn a gay preacher to a sinner  
No one you want your mama meet  
Shes a Peach  
This is a girl plays hard to get  
I would die if I kissed her  
I would try but Im last on her list  
Shes so cool and Im so ugly  
Id be a fool to think she could love me  
This kinda girls always out of reach  
Shes a Peach  
Peach
