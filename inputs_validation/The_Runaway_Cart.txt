The crowd parts to reveal that the cart has crashed trapping M
Fauchelevant  
  
Voices  
Look at that  
Look at that  
Its Monsieur Fauchelevant  
Dont approach Dont go near  
At the risk of your life  
He is caught by the wheel  
Oh the pitiful man  
Stay away turn away  
There is nothing to do  
There is nothing to do  
  
Valjean  
Is there anyone here  
Who will rescue the man  
Who will help me to shoulder  
The weight of the cart  
  
Voices  
Dont go near him Mr Mayor  
The load is heavy as hell  
The old mans a goner for sure  
Itll kill you as well  
  
Valjean attempts to lift the cart They manage to pull Fauchelevant clear  
  
Fauchelevant  
Msieur le Mayor I have no words  
You come from God you are a saint  
  
Javert takes Valjean aside  
  
Javert  
Can this be true  
I dont believe what I see  
A man your age  
To be as strong as you are  
A memory stirs  
You make me think of a man  
From years ago  
A man who broke his parole  
He disappeared  
Forgive me Sir  
I would not dare  
  
Valjean  
Say what you must dont leave it there  
  
Javert  
I have only known one other  
Who can do what you have done  
Hes a convict from the chain gang  
Hes been ten years on the run  
But he couldnt run forever  
We have found his hideaway  
And hes just been rearrested  
And he comes to court today  
Of course he now denies it  
Youd expect that of a con  
But he couldnt run forever  
No not even Jean Valjean  
  
Valjean  
You say this man denies it all  
And gives no sign of understanding or repentance  
You say this man is going to trial  
And thats hes sure to be returned  
To serve his sentence  
Come to that can you be sure  
That I am not your man  
  
Javert  
I have known the thief for ages  
Tracked him down through thick and thin  
And to make the matter certain  
Theres the brand upon his skin  
He will bend he will break  
This time there is no mistake  
  
Javert leaves Valjean is alone
