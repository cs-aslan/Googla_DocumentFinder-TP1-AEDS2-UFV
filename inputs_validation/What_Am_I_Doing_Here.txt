Pale the young squire who goes to fight  
To die at his masters side  
Living is just a dream inside  
You ask me why he cried  
What am I doin here  
What am I doin here  
  
Beautiful princess fair and pale  
Stares out across the sea  
Alone in her castle dark and grey  
Her love shell never see  
What am I doin here  
What am I doin here  
  
Tenderly bury the fair young dead  
Place a wooden cross at his head  
All the words you can say  
Have been said  
Its for you my tears are shed  
  
What can be done you wont believe  
Listen and you may see  
Everyones dream is deep within  
Find it and youll be free  
What am I doin here  
What am I doin here  
  
Tenderly bury the fair young dead  
Place a wooden cross at his head  
All the words you can say  
Have been said  
Its for you my tears are shed  
  
Tenderly bury the fair young dead  
Place a wooden cross at his head  
All the words you can say  
Have been said  
Its for you my tears are shed
