Oh do you remember ooh  
When the family was everything ooh  
Oh do you remember ooh  
It was so long ago and so much has changed ooh  
I want to go back go backooh  
want to go back to those simple days ooh  
I want to go back go backooh  
But now weve grown and gone our separate ways  
  
aah  
Times is hard times is hard  
And things are a changin  
I pray to God  
That we can remain the same  
All Im trying to say is our love dont have to change  
No it dont have to change  
  
Do you remember ooh  
Back at Grannies house on Christmas Day ooh  
Help me sing  
Do you remember ooh  
How wed gather round and sing all day ooh  
I want to go back go backooh  
To playing basketball and football games  
I want to go back go backooh  
To yesterday but its not the same  
  
Times is hard times is hard  
And things are a changin  
I pray to God  
That we can remain the same  
All Im trying to say is our love dont have to change  
No it dont have to change  
  
Times is hard times is hard  
And things are a changin  
So I pray to God  
That we can remain the same  
All Im trying to say is our love dont have to change  
No it dont have to change
