She can concentrate on workin  
Until her work is done  
She can hold a conversation  
As well as anyone  
Shell fool you with sincerity  
And if you didnt know her well  
You would never see it  
You could never tell  
  
Chorus  
Shes just looking for him  
Shes only rememberin  
She might look like shes ready  
To fall in love again  
But shes just looking for him  
  
She keeps one eye on the road  
And one on the other lane  
Lookin for his car  
His memorys replayed  
She searches other faces  
Tryin to find that spark  
But no one new can reach her  
Or fill her hollow heart  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh youd better keep your distance  
Dont let her reel you in  
Shes not quite herself now  
How could she be when  
  
Chorus
