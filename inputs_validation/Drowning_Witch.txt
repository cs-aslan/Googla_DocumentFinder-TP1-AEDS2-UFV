Theres a ship arriving too late  
To save a drowning witch  
She was swimmin along  
Tryin to keep a date  
With a merchant marine  
Who told her he was really rich  
But it doesnt matter no more  
Shes on the ocean floor  
n the waters all green down there  
n its not very clean down there  
n water snakes  
n rusty wrecks  
Is all that she can see  
As the light goes dim  
And shes tryin to swim  
Will she make it  
boy we sure hope so  
Not even a witch oughta be caught  
On the bottom of americas spewinfested  
Hohoho heyhey  
She could get radiation all over her  
She could mutate insanely aieeeaie  
She could mutate insanely earth wall  
Then you know  
She could go on the freeway and grow up to be 15 feet tall  
And very very scarylookin  
And then  
Cars could crash all over the place  
As a result of people with hawaiian shirts on  
Lookin up to hear her go ha ha ha  
Sardines in her eyebrows  
Lobsters up n down her pudenda  
All of them horribly large from graduation  
And smelling very bad  
And dangerous  
Maybe a submarine could save her  
Thats right yes thats true  
And bring her back just like a mudshark  
Tell em what they win bob  
Well therefore ladies  
A full weeks supply of gartenions onion rings  
Broncos new bondageinabottle  
It wont crack it wont stake it wont beat it wont budge  
It wont bite the old fate  
And of course a brand new absolutely brand new  
New new and of course but also a new car
