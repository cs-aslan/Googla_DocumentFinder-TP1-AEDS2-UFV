Youve got to lift yourself up so high  
You cant see the ground  
You dont hear a sound  
Youve got to move it up so slow  
You see it all  
Youll probably fall  
  
Id rather die than see you fly  
Than see you try  
Id rather die than see you fly  
Than see you try  
  
Its like pushing locked doors to get in your mind  
I dont care what I find  
Its like pushing locked doors to get in your mind  
I dont know what Ill find  
  
Youve got to move me up  
So high it hurts  
So high it burns  
But if you let me down  
Dont bother to call  
Just let me fall  
Id rather die than see you fly  
Than see you try  
Id rather die than see you fly  
Than see you try  
  
Its like pushing locked doors to get in your mind  
I dont know what Ill find  
Its like pushing locked doors to get in that mind  
I dont care what I find  
Its like pushing locked doors to get in that mind  
I dont care what I find  
Its like pushing locked doors to get in that mind  
I dont care what I find  
Its like pushing locked doors to get in that mind  
I dont care what I find  
Its like pushing locked to get in that mind  
I dont care what I find  
Its like pushing locked doors to get in that mind  
I dont care what I find  
  
Its only one  
  
One way to go  
One way to go  
  
One way to go  
One way to go
