Well I really had a fall last night  
I held all the pretty girl tight  
I was feelin single but seein double  
And wound up in a whole lotta trouble  
The day I face a big fight  
But I really had a fall last night  
  
I came home from work this mornin  
My little womans was afeelin low  
She told me what was on her mind  
And she told me where I could go  
  
Well I didnt go where she told to to  
Cause the water was cold in the lake  
Theres something fishy bout this whole deal  
Im gonna see where I made a mistake  
  
Well I really had a fall last night  
I held all the pretty girl tight  
I was feelin single but seein double  
And wound up in a whole lotta trouble  
The day I face a big fight  
But I really had a fall last night  
  
Well when I opened the door this mornin  
Like me the sun was high  
I started walkin the long way home  
Just to think of an alibi  
  
Well I couldnt think of a doggon thing  
That I hadnt already said  
Guess I better play it by ear  
For Im already dead  
  
Well I really had a fall last night  
I held all the pretty girl tight  
I was feelin single but seein double  
And wound up in a whole lotta trouble  
The day I face a big fight  
But I really had a fall last night
