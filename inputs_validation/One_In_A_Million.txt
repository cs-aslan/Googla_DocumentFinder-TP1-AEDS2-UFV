Why  
This uncertainty  
Its not clear to me  
Would you rather be independent  
Have I lost your love  
Have you had enough  
Do you feel too much resentment  
How can I make you see  
When you disagree  
That you just cant leave  
  
One in a million men  
Could change the way you feel  
One in a million men  
Baby its up to me  
  
I  
Wont stand in your way  
I can make you stay  
Though of course I feel rejected  
Youre a part of me  
Youre the family  
I cant bear to leave  
  
One in a million men  
Could change the way you feel  
One in a million men  
Baby its up to me  
  
Feel  
Free  
To leave  
If you think youre trapped but  
Please  
Believe  
Ill always want you back  
  
One in a million men  
Could change the way you feel  
One in a million men  
Baby its up to me  
  
One in a million men  
Could change the way you feel  
One in a million men  
Baby its up to me  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
One in a million men  
Could change the way you feel  
One in a million men  
Baby its up to me  
  
One in a million men  
Could change the way you feel  
One in a million men  
Baby its up to me
