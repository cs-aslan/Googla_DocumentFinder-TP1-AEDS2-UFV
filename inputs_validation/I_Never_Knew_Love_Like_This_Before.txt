I NEVER KNEW LOVE LIKE THIS BEFORE  
WRITERS REGGIE LEWIS JAMES MTUME  
  
I never knew love like this before now Im lonely never more  
Since you came into my life You are my lovelight this I know  
And Ill never let you go You my all youre part of me  
Once I was lost and now Im found Then you turned my world around  
When I need you I call your name  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
Opened my eyes  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
What a surprise  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
This feelings so deep inside of me Such a tender fantasy  
Youre the one Im living for You are my sunlight and my rain  
And time could never change  
What we share forever more oohhoo  
I never knew love like this before  
Now Im lonely never more Since you came into my life  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
Opened my eyes  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
What a surprise  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
You are my lovelight this I know And Ill never let you go  
You my all youre part of me Once I was lost and now Im found  
Then you turned my world around  
When I need you I call your name  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
Opened my eyes  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
What a surprise  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
Inside of me I never knew love like this before  
Opened my eyes  
Never  never  
Never knew love like this Never  never  
Never knew love like this Never  never  
Never knew love like this Never  never never  
Never knew love like this Never  never never  
Never knew love like this Never  never I never  
Never knew love like this Never  never never  
Never knew love like this Never
