Quite a surprise  
What an ingenious device  
Boredom encompassesmy time  
I dont know what I should do  
Indulging a moment of your time  
Seldom the breeder of lies  
But you wont believe that its true  
  
They take to the skies  
Southbound pachyderm  
  
Pinholes through cardboard at the sun  
Passing the bucks by one by one leaving nothing in return  
Watching the majesty blow past  
Speculating which will be the last  
Savoring my piece of pie  
  
And there is no reprise  
They take to the sky  
Southbound pachyderm
