Looking from a hill top watching from a lighthouse  
Just dreaming  
Up here I can see the world  
Ooh sometimes it dont look nice  thats OK  
Life from a window Im just taking in the view  
Life from a window observing everything around you  
Staring at a grey sky try to paint it blue  
teenage blue  
Some people that you see around you tell you how devoted they are  
They tell you something on Sunday but come Monday theyve  
changed their minds  
Im looking from a skyscraper  
Im standing on the Post Office tower   
So I can see  all there is to see
