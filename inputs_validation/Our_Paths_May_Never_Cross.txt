Lady I know your out there somewhere  
Like me your feeling lost  
Maybe right now we both need each other  
But our paths may never cross  
  
People like us never find each other  
Love is our greatest loss  
Baby I know you are out there some where  
But our paths may never cross  
  
Were to people that should be together  
Cause were lonely at the very same time  
But theres a million to many good reasons  
Why your love can never be mine  
  
Maybe this song was written for you  
Listen dont turn it off  
I wish you could learn it  
And come sing it with me  
But our paths may never cross  
  
I wish you could learn it  
And come sing it with me  
But our paths may never cross
