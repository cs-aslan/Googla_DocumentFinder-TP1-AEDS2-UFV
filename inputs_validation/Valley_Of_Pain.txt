Ah dont let me grow bitter I pray  
Give me strength to carry on my way  
  
Im leanin on you like a wooden cane  
Well Im walkin through Im walkin through the valley of the pain  
  
Im believin theres a reason for this trial  
This too shall pass in a little while  
Whoa Lord have mercy if I complain  
Im walkin through Im walkin through the valley of the pain  
Yes Im walkin through Im walkin through the valley of the pain  
  
Paint me in a river of my tears  
Whisper hope and truth courage in my ears  
  
Well when Im hurtin I have a dangerous tongue  
I lose it and use it like a gun  
Oh wont you stop me if you see me takin aim  
Im walkin through Im walkin through the valley of the pain  
If Im walkin through Im walkin through the valley of the pain  
Yes Im walkin through Im walkin through the valley of the pain  
  
Paint me in a river of my tears  
Whisper hope and truth courage in my ears  
Remind me when I reach the other side  
Ill b thankful for every tear that I cries  
  
Dont let the darkness drive me insane  
Im walkin through Im walkin through the valley of the pain  
If Im walkin through Im walkin through the valley of the pain  
Yes Im walkin through Im walkin through the valley of the pain
