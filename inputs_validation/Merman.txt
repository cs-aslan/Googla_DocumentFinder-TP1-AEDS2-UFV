Go to bed  
The priests are dead  
Now no one  
Can call you bad  
Go to bed  
The priests are dead  
Finally youre in peppermint land  
  
Hes a merman  
He doesnt need your voice  
Hes a merman  
  
Go to bed  
Dream instead  
And you will find him  
Hes a merman  
To the knee  
Doesnt need something youre not willing to give  
Hes a merman  
Doesnt need your voice to cross his lands of ice  
  
Go to bed  
The priests are dead  
Now no one  
Can call you bad  
Go to bed  
The priests are dead  
Finally you found him  
  
Let it out  
Who could ever say youre not simply wonderful  
Who could ever harm you  
Sleep now  
Youre my little goat  
  
Go to bed  
The priests are dead  
And come sing it all again  
Go to bed  
Past the apple orchard  
And youll feel nice  
  
Two can play  
I said two can play
