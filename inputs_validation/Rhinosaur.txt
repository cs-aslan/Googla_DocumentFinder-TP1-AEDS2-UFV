Standing with my enemies  
Hung on my horns  
With haste and reverie  
Killing with charm  
  
Only happy when you hurt  
Only deadly in a swarm  
Only healthy in the dirt  
Only empty in your arms  
  
I play Im sick and tame  
Drawing the hordes  
I wait and show the lame  
The meaning of harm  
The skull beneath my feet  
Like feathers in sand  
I graze among the graves  
A feeling of peace  
  
Only bending when you break  
Only feeding when youre cold  
Only healing when you ache  
Only feeling when you dont
