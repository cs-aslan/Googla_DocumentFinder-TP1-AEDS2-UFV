While digesting Readers Digest in the back of a dirty book store  
A plastic flag with gum on the back fell out on the floor  
Well I picked it up and I ran outside slapped it on my window shield  
And if I could see old Betsy Ross Id tell her how good I feel  
But your flag decal wont get you into Heaven anymore  
Theyre already overcrowded from your dirty little war  
Now Jesus dont like killin no matter what the reasons for  
And your flag decal wont get you into Heaven anymore  
Well I went to the bank this morning and the cashier he said to me  
If you join the Christmas club well give you ten of them flags for free  
Well I didnt mess around a bit I took him up on what he said  
And I stuck them stickers all over my car and one on my wifes forehead  
But your flag decal wont get you into Heaven anymore  
Theyre already overcrowded from your dirty little war  
Now Jesus dont like killin no matter what the reasons for  
And your flag decal wont get you into Heaven anymore  
Well I got my window shield so filled with flags I couldnt see  
So I ran the car upside a curb and right into a tree  
By the time they got a doctor down I was already dead  
And Ill never understand why the man standing in the pearly gates said  
But your flag decal wont get you into Heaven anymore  
Were already overcrowded from your dirty little war  
Now Jesus dont like killin no matter what the reasons for  
And your flag decal wont get you into Heaven anymore
