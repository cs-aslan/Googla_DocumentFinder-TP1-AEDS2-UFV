Dont feel bad if you wake up feeling suddenly old  
More the realisation that youve let yourself be covered by mould  
Age is not something you wrap up if youre feeling the cold  
Its a laugh ten times harder at a joke eleven times told  
  
Down to the churchyard check out the vaults  
Dig up the coffins unscrew the bolts  
No better reminder no strong enough salts  
To show this pitiful few that weve missed the last waltz  
  
Dont feel bad if youre feeling past you sellby date  
Like the roller coaster ride slowed down to a serious debate  
Oh the weather you tell them youre ready or whether you wait  
Does someone place a hand on your shoulder you point the way to the gate  
  
Down to the churchyard check out the vaults  
Dig up the coffins unscrew the bolts  
No better reminder no strong enough salts  
To show this pitiful few that weve missed the last waltz  
  
You dont count the birthdays til your out on your own  
They come thicker and faster and too damn late to postpone  
And wisdoms the last thing the scientists willing to clone  
Science advances maturity dances alone
