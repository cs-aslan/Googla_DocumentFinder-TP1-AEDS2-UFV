How many times  
Have I been here before  
Like a worn away piece of the night  
Waiting for the dawn  
  
Daylight breaks  
And the dream is gone  
Leaving me to stay  
But Im still holding on  
Yeah Ill keep holding on  
  
I used to think I knew  
Just exactly what I took  
You move in fast and hard  
And you make your own luck  
  
Daylight breaks  
And the dream is gone  
Leaving me to stay  
But Im still holding on  
  
I see it better now  
Smell the tears upon this tracks  
Its a long long way before its over  
And what you give out  
Is what you get back  
The easy way out  
It will bite you hard someday  
You see me smile and learn  
I find a better way  
  
Im still holding on
