I dont know why was getting so good with us  
I dont know why was getting so good with us  
I dont know why was getting so good  
Was getting so good with us  
  
I dont know why was so good with us  
  
The rooms so empty the rooms empty without you  
My bodys so empty the worlds so empty without you  
  
I dont know why  
I dont know why  
I dont know why  
I dont know why twas so good with us  
  
You left me you left me you left me without words  
You left me you left me you left me without words  
You left me you left me you left me without words  
  
You bastards  
Hate us hate me we had evrything you
