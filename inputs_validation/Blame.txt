So I think you are a fool  
Hanging on my every word  
Its getting ugly  
So Im ugly  
  
Tear me from your heart  
Tearing me apart  
  
So I thought you disappeared  
Being alone is what you fear  
Are you lonely  
Yes lonely  
  
Tear me from your heart  
Tearing me apart  
  
Rolling and throwing consoling  
Everything that goes this far  
Joking and hoping revolting  
All that shit thats who you are  
Hoping and scolding revolving  
Peel it back reveal the scar  
Loathing exploding controlling  
This is what you really are  
  
The time is coming  
God is saying  
Youre really happy  
What a game  
The time is coming  
A bed of flames  
Your life is over and youre to blame  
The time is coming  
Youve gone insane  
Youre feeling happy  
Youve won the game  
The time is coming  
A bed of flames  
Your life is over and youre to blame  
  
Rolling and throwing consoling  
Everything that goes this far  
Joking and hoping revolting  
All that shit thats who you are  
Hoping and scolding revolving  
Peel it back reveal the scar  
Loathing exploding controlling  
This is what you really are  
  
Rolling and throwing consoling  
Everything that goes this far  
Joking and hoping revolting  
All that shit thats who you are  
Hoping and scolding revolving  
Peel it back reveal the scar  
Loathing exploding controlling  
This is what you really are
