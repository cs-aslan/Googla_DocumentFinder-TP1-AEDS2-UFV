Save time to collect my fortune  
Paid upon arrival  
But I dont know where Ill be goin  
Im travelin survival  
Aw girl  
When I get there  
If it aint for free  
I want you to know theres  
Nobody like you to me  
  
Ive been scarred by my commitment  
To tell them what I see  
But I cant see that Ive  
Been blinded  
By mediocrity  
Aw girl  
If I dare  
To change what it should be  
I want you to know theres  
Nobody like you to me  
  
Maybe I should take it easy  
Seems Im the only one  
But you wont let me rest my conscience  
Til all I know is done  
Aw girl  
If I care  
Enough to disagree  
I want you to know theres  
Nobody like you to me
