Smoothtalking  
So rocking  
Hes got everything that a girls wantin  
Guitar cutie  
Who plays it groovy  
And I cant keep myself from doing something stupid  
  
Think I may be falling for his smile  
Get butterflies when he says my name  
  
Hes got something special  
Hes got something special  
The way that hes lookin at me I want to get all sentimental  
Hes got something special  
Hes got something special  
I can hardly breathe somethings telling me telling me maybe he could be the
one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one Repeat  
  
Hes lightning  
Sparks are flying  
Everywhere I go hes always on my mind and  
Im goin crazy  
About him lately  
And I cant help myself from how my heart is racing  
  
Think Im really digging on his vibe  
He really blows me away  
  
Woooo  
  
Hes got something special  
Hes got something special  
And when hes looking at me I want to get all sentimental  
Hes got something special  
Hes got something special  
I can hardly breathe somethings been telling me telling me maybe he could
be the one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one Repeat  
  
And hes got a way of making me feel  
Like everything I do is  
Perfectly fine  
The stars are aligned when Im with him  
And Im so into him  
  
Hes got something special  
Hes got something special  
And when hes looking at me I want to get all sentimental  
Hes got something special  
Hes got something special  
I can hardly breathe somethings been telling me telling me maybe he could
be the one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one Repeat
