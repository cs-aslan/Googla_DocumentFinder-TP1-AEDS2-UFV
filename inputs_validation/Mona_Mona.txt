I remember sayin  
She came out of nowhere  
Like the devil in disguise  
I believed it when she told me  
  
That she loved me  
 tellin lies  
  
Everybody knows her name  
Mona Mona  
Everybody knows her game  
Mona Mona  
  
Shes gonna break your heart  
Mona Mona  
She Cut you right down  
Then shell tear you apart  
Mona Mona  
  
You know youd better try to forget it  
You know youre gonna live to regret it  
Id really hate to be the one  
To tell you so I told you so  
  
Let me take the time to remind you  
Youre better off leavin her behind you  
I really think its something  
That you ought a know  
You better let her go  
  
Yeah yeah let her go  
  
Everybody knows her name  
Mona Mona  
Everybody knows her game  
Mona Mona  
  
Shes gonna break your heart  
Mona Mona  
She Cut you right down  
Then shell tear you apart  
Mona Mona  
  
You know youd better try to forget it  
You know youre gonna live to regret it  
Id really hate to be the one  
To tell you so I told you so  
  
Let me take the time to remind you  
Youre better off leavin her behind you  
I really think its something  
That you ought a know  
You better let her go
