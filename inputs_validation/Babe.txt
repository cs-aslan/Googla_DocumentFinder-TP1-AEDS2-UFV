Babe Im leaving  
I must be on my way  
The time is drawing near  
My train is going  
I see it in your eyes  
The love the need your tears  
But Ill be lonely without you  
And Ill need your love to see me through  
So please believe me  
My heart is in your hands  
And Ill be missing you  
  
Cause you know its you babe  
Whenever I get weary  
And Ive had enough  
Feel like giving up  
You know its you babe  
Giving me the courage  
And the strength I need  
Please believe that its true  
Babe I love you  
  
You know its you babe  
Whenever I get weary  
And Ive had enough  
Feel like giving up  
You know its you babe  
Giving me the courage  
And the strength I need  
Please believe that its true  
Babe I love you  
  
Babe Im leaving  
Ill say it once again  
And somehow try to smile  
I know the feeling were trying to forget  
If only for a while  
Cause Ill be lonely without you  
And Ill need your love to see me through  
Please believe me  
My heart is in your hands  
Cause Ill be missing you  
Babe I love you  
Babe I love you  
Ooh babe
