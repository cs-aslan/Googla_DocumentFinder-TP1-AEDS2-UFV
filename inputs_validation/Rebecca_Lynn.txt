Rebecca Lynn grew up in Carolina  
Half a mile from Tucker Cherrys farm  
A quiet girl with green eyes full of fire  
Her daddys pride and all her mamas charm  
Rebecca Lynn became my hearts desire  
Long about the start of second grade  
Mrs Roosenbloom let me sit beside her  
So wed pass notes and after school wed play  
  
Chorus  
Singing ring around the rosie  
Pocket full of dreams and posies  
Patty cake and bakers man  
Tag your it kick the can  
  
And I think I hear my mama calling  
Gotta go  
Man I loved her so  
  
High school days with me and Becky learning what it really means to be in love  
Give and take holding back for Heavens sake  
And fighting for a week and making up  
I said please Becky wont you marry me  
Prom night in my car out by the curb  
She was so surprised first she laughed and then she cried  
And somewhere in my heart Im sure I heard  
  
Chorus  
  
Mama flashed the porch light for me  
Gotta go  
Man I loved her so  
  
When love is wrong it dies and thats the way it goes  
But when its right your love grows  
  
Laura Jean was born in Tennessee  
Now thats a common little miracle I know  
But for me and Becky Lynn shes the dream that started  
When we fell in love so many years ago  
  
Chorus  
  
And I think I hear your mama calling  
Gotta go  
Oh man I loved you so
