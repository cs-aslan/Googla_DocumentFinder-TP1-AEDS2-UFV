Kill kill kill  
Kill kill kill  
Kill kill kill  
  
Chorus  
Mentally ill from Amityville Ill  
Accidentally kill your family still  
Thinkin he wont Goddamnit he will Hes  
Mentally ill from Amityville  
  
I get lifted and spin til Im halftwisted  
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick  
Pen full of ink think sinful and rap sick shit  
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit  
Drink gin til my chins full of splashed whiskers  
Hash whiskey and ash til I slap bitches  
Ask Bizzy hes been here the past six years  
Mash with me youll get in imagine this  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I fucked my cousin in his asshole slit my mothers throat  
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope  
My little sisters birthday shell remember me  
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity  
And bitches know me as a hornyass freak  
Their mother wasnt raped I ate her pussy while she was sleep  
Pissydrunk throwin up in the urinal you fuckin homo  
Thats what I said at my dads funeral  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Thats why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin idiots still still  
Thats why the first motherfucker poppin some shit he gets killed killed  
Thats why we dont call it Detroit we call it Amityville Ville  
You can get capped after just havin a cavity filled filled  
Thats why were crowned the murder capital still still  
This aint Detroit this is motherfuckin Hamburger Hill Hill  
We dont do drivebys we park in front of houses and shoot  
And when the police come we fuckin shoot it out with them too  
Thats the mentality here here thats the reality here here  
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here huh  
While Im holdin a pistol with this many calibers here here  
Plus some registration that just made this shit valid this year year  
Cause once I snap I cant be held accountable for my actions  
Thats when accidents happen  
When a thousand bullets come at your house  
And collapse the foundation around you and they found you  
And your family in it Ah  
God dammit he meant it when he told you  
  
Chorus x2
