Well love can be an uphill climb  
Im gonna meet a lot of resistance  
It takes every ounce of strength weve got  
If were gonna go the distance  
We can get discouraged and lose our courage  
Worrying bout the daily grind  
But lifes a journey no need to hurry  
Its one day at a time  
  
Chorus  
One foot in front of the other  
Take one step then take another  
Keep on walkin were headed in the right direction  
Puttin one foot in front of the other  
Little by little gets a whole lot further  
Hittin our stride one foot in front of the other  
  
Whats down the road we cant say  
And the road behind dont matter  
But every mile along the way  
Is just another mile together  
Unconcerned about the twists and turns  
Were takin it nice and slow  
Safe and sound covering ground  
Steady as she goes  
  
Chorus  
  
Yesterday is dead and gone  
And tomorrow takes care of itself  
Well just keep on keepin on  
Cause we aint stumbled yet  
  
One foot in front of the other  
Take one step and then take another  
Just awalkin and atalkin and amovin in the same direction  
Just puttin one foot in front of the other  
Little by little gets a whole lot further  
Hittin our stride one foot in front of the other  
  
Well just ahittin our stride  
One foot in front of the other
