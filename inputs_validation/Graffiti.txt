I see you writin on my wall why you wanna do that  
My names tagged you already see that  
The media wanna paint it all black  
And they do it right in my face  
See I cant sit back and let it all wash away  
I worked too hard for it to be erased  
Before you talk Ima finish what I gotta say  
  
Cause I already put in time with all of my grindinwith all of my grindin  
You know I grind through all of this trouble all of this trouble  
Even through the pain I still had to hustle  
Man I had to feed my family and at the same time keep my sanity oh no  
Man I cant let you do it  
  
Graffiti youre tryna spray spray on me  
Graffiti youre tryna spray on my name  
Graffiti youre tryna spray spray on me  
All the graffiti youre tryna spray on my name  
  
But its already written on the wall  
Cant cover it up cant cover it up  
But its already written on the wall  
Cant cover it up cant cover it up  
  
Who got award shows rockin every time I hit the stage  
Even the haters went and bought a CD  
Without my fans Im an empty spray can and I just cant paint a thing  
Seems like the less I had the money the less I had the problems  
The more I got the money the more I got the problems  
Let me clear my throat gotta make sure you hear me go  
  
Cause I already put in time with all of my grindin with all my grindin  
You know I grind through all of this trouble all of this trouble  
Even through the pain I still had to hustle  
Man I had to feed my family and at the same time keep my sanity oh noo  
Man I cant let you do it  
  
Graffiti youre tryna spray spray on me  
Graffiti youre tryna spray on my name  
Graffiti youre tryna spray spray on me  
All the graffiti youre tryna spray on my name  
  
Cause its already written on the wall  
Cant cover it up cant cover it up  
Cause its already written on the wall  
Cant cover it up cant cover it up baby  
  
Its already done aint gotta pay no more  
All this pain that Ive endured  
I know I was wrong for what I did  
And I made some mistakes cause Im human  
I aint gon feed into the negative  
Ima keep grindin ohh yeah  
But this graffiti oh oh oh  
  
Cause I already put in time with all of my grindin  
You know I grind through all of this trouble all of this trouble  
Even through the pain I still had to hustle  
Man I had to feed my family  
and at the same time keep my sanity oh no  
Man I cant let you do it
