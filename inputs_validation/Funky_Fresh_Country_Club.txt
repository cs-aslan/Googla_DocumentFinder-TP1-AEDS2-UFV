Funky fresh tunes  
And youre walking down the street  
And youre trying to find the girl  
That you really want to meet  
  
Youre flying past the reef  
And youre drinking shrunken heads  
You wake up in the morning  
And you wish that you were dead  
  
As you stagger home  
In the blackest form of night  
The rollers out in force baby  
Theyre looking for a fight  
  
You try to play the game  
You try to pass the test  
But the only thing in sight baby  
Is the sight of your arrest  
  
Jail cell living hell  
Cains off me Im free  
Doing time one more time  
Mine all mine all mine  
  
Now the country club is cold  
And the country club is mean  
The attendants at the country club  
Aint something to be seen  
  
If youre messing with my girl  
Youre messing with your life  
Cause Im gonna cut you  
With a big big knife  
You bet your fuckin life  
  
Now as you stagger home  
In the blackest form of night  
The rollers out in force baby  
Theyre looking for a fight  
  
You try to play the game  
You try to pass the test  
But the only thing in sight baby  
Is the sight of your arrest  
  
Jail cell living hell  
Cains off me Im free  
Doing time one more time  
Mine all mine all mine  
  
I want to tell you a story baby  
I hope you want to hear  
I want to tell you a story baby  
I hope you want to hear  
  
Going downtown in the back of a car  
Some mothafucka left the door ajar  
Remember what your parents said  
Be home by eight and in your bed  
  
Now as you stagger home  
In the blackest form of night  
The rollers out in force baby  
Theyre looking for a fight  
  
You try to play the game  
You try to pass the test  
But the only thing in sight baby  
Is the sight of your arrest  
  
Jail cell living hell  
Cains off me Im free  
Doing time one more time  
Mine all mine all mine
