One two one two three  
Well I travel at the speed unknown to man  
So I bring you a message from the mirrors of my hand  
I said a message of love dont you hid away  
Face the mirrors of your mind  
Face the truth today  
  
Well I am what I am thank god  
Lord some people just dont understand  
Help them god  
I said find yourself first  
And then your tool  
Find yourself first  
Just dont be no fool  
  
I see a woman comin  
I see ya layin on your back  
For the birth of pleasure  
I see you on the right track  
Free is free  
You aint supposed to be  
Now dont rely on no man  
Try to argue instead  
I said find yourself first  
And then your talent  
Work hard in your mind  
Go come alive  
And prove to the man  
Your as strong as him  
In the eyes of god  
  
Everybody come alive  
Everybody come alive  
Everybody come alive  
Everybody love a lot  
Everybody love a lot  
Everybody love a lot  
Everybody love a lot
