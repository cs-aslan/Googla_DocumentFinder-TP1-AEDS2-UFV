Early mornin  
Great  
I was out real late last night  
Got a little messy  
Early morning  
Cant be like that anymore  
No  
  
I was shaking my ass in the streets alone and  
Just walked in and its early mornin  
Bump bump till the break of dawn  
And it dont stop till the early mornin  
Passed out on the couch and yawnin  
Just walked in and its early mornin  
Bump bump till the break of dawn  
And it dont stop till the early mornin  
  
Met a tall dude kinda dark hair  
When he walked up somebody grabbed him  
But I liked him told him come here  
Kinda cool  
Baby we can make plans  
Where ya live  
Do ya mama live there  
We can hook up at the hotel  
Hands down so I told him lets go  
But have a next guess  
But you dont wanna know  
  
I was shaking my ass in the streets alone and  
Just walked in and its early mornin  
Bump bump till the break of dawn  
And it dont stop till the early mornin  
Passed out on the couch and yawnin  
Just walked in and its early mornin  
Bump bump till the break of dawn  
And it dont stop till the early mornin  
  
Oh in love  
So I approached him  
We gotta give him his friends  
Theres something bout him that shows  
So I said what the hell lets go  
Got up got on the dance floor  
Hooked up with a guy named Joe  
When the music was fast and slow  
But have a next guess  
But you dont wanna know  
  
I was shaking my ass in the streets alone and  
Just walked in and its early mornin  
Bump bump till the break of dawn  
And it dont stop till the early mornin  
Passed out on the couch and yawnin  
Just walked in and its early mornin  
Bump bump till the break of dawn  
And it dont stop till the early mornin

Call all your girls  
Call all your friends  
Lets do it again  
Lets do it again  
  
Yes  
Early morning  
Yes  
Cant keep doin this

Your one desire  
Pull on me baby  
And Ill take you higher  
  
You should try her  
So come over here and lets go so woah woah
