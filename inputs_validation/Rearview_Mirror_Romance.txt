Im movin Im feeling like Im rollin on my own what could be better  
Then somewhere drivin my car the radio turn it on what could be better  
I check around in traffic from my point of view what could be better  
Then I saw her in the mirror  
Maybe the same thing has happened to you  
It was  
  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Romance after just one look  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
I didnt know her but it didnt matter  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Just by chance I still cant believe that its true love reflected sight  
Its a rear view romance tonight  
  
She pulled up close first glance I saw here eyes what could be better  
I couldnt stop starin at her she didnt realize what could be better  
Then looked up in the mirror smile on her faace  
There she goes heaven knows  
Maybe the same thing has happened to you  
  
It was  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Romance after just one look  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
I didnt know her but it didnt matter  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Just by chance I still cant believe that its true love reflected sight  
Its a rear view romance tonight  
  
There she goes heaven knows  
I want to meet her all alone  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Romance after just one look  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
I didnt know her but it didnt matter  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Just by chance I still cant believe that its true love reflected sight  
  
Its a rear view romance tonight  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Romance after just one look  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
I didnt know her but it didnt matter  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Just by chance I still cant believe that its true love reflected sight  
Its a rear view romance tonight  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Romance after just one look  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
I didnt know her but it didnt matter  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Just by chance I still cant believe that its true love reflected sight
