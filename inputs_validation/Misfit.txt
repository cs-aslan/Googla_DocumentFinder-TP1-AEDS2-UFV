There are plenty of late nights  
If you want to stay up for them  
Youll just want to find yourself a friend  
And tie a couple on in a night spot  
Draw pictures of your soul win the jackpot  
For tears in your beer  
Its hip to be miserable when youre young and intellectual  
In a bit youll admit youre a misfit  
  
Come on home with me  
Well turn on the TV  
About 10 oclock well turn off the light  
Not every man was born to stay up late at night  
  
There are plenty of boats to catch  
If you notice all the sails in the wind  
But you better look hard my friend  
In case you catch a ride on the wrong one  
In the distance is the one you belong on  
Oh the water is wide  
Its hip to be miserable when youre young and intellectual  
In a bit youll admit youre a misfit  
  
Come on home with me  
Well sit under a tree  
And if you get the itch  
Ill supply the scratch  
Not every man was born with a boat to catch  
  
Its hip to be miserable when you are young and intellectual  
In a bit youll admit youre a misfit  
A misfit
