To whom it may concern  
You found another love I know  
To whom it may concern  
My heart wont ever let you go  
You tore my heart apart  
When you found somebody new  
But you found out that your heart could be broken too  
So to whom it may concern  
Youve learned that heartache has no pride  
  
Pretending unconcerned wont stop those tears you try to hide  
And when youre all alone with just a memory  
Thats when Ill bet youll learn the one whos most concerned is me  
And when youre all alone with just a memory  
  
Thats when Ill bet youll learn the one whos most concerned is me
