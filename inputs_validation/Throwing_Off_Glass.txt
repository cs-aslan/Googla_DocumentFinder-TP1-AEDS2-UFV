Why is the world so creepy she asked  
After a car full of haircuts drove past  
A backseat full of the boys  
I told her that It isnt  
That that its exquisite  
But like love it has its barbarous threats  
Still in spite of the cads  
And the stoopshouldered teens  
I know Im losing you  
I know what that means yeah  
I told her that it isnt  
That its real exquisite  
But like love it can have its  
Stubbedtoe effects  
And juts like after she heard the word Iridescent  
And everything was iridescent for awhile  
It wasnt long before she exalted out of nowhere  
Isnt this exquisite  
Once youve said mmm in unison  
And oh in double surprise  
And shared relief with a mutual phew  
And a look in each others eyes  
I tell her that is isnt insisted that it isnt  
Because like love it has toocunning effects yeah  
I told her that it isnt that its just exquisite  
Because like love it has its barbarous threats  
Why is the world so creepy she asked  
After a car full of haircuts drove past  
A backseat full of the boys  
Breaking glass throwing off glass
