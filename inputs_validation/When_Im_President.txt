I remember it well  
I was just about three  
My dad said  
son what do you want to be  
It didnt ring no bells but I said  
daddy Im a bit too young what do you want from me  
  
Im much older now  
Im almost a man  
I can do anything you bet I can  
Raise a family  
Now wouldnt that be grand  
So sorry but I got bigger plans  
  
You can be anything in the world today  
Something like a preacher a teacher  
A baseball player  
Those kind of things I just dont care  
I want to represent the usa  
  
The american dream  
As far as the eye I say can you see  
I want to be  
I want to be the leader of the country  
  
When Im president  
Things will be different  
Well start a new government  
When Im president  
When Im president  
You can be in my cabinet  
Ill be your heaven sent  
President  
  
First things first were gonna change the rules  
Better listen up all you boys and girls  
Your president says therell be no after school  
So vote for me wouldnt that be cool  
  
Yeah yeah  
  
Now I know theres trouble in the middle east  
Ill spend all the money when I stop the arms race  
All my brothers in the desert  
Gonna have themselves a feast  
When thats done then well start on world peace  
  
So go ask Alice  
Cos you know what he said  
What did he say  
Remember I wanna be elected
