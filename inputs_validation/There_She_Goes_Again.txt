There she goes again  
Shes out on the streets again  
Shes down on her knees my friend  
But you know shell never ask you please again  
  
Now take a look theres no tears in her eyes  
She wont take it from just any guy what can you do  
You see her walkin on down the street  
Look at all your friends shes gonna meet  
You better hit her  
  
There she goes again  
Shes knocked out on her feet again  
Shes down on her knees my friend  
But you know shell never ask you please again  
  
Now take a look theres no tears in her eyes  
Like a bird you know she would fly what can you do  
You see her walkin on down the street  
Look at all your friends that shes gonna meet  
You better hit her  
  
Now take a look theres no tears in her eyes  
Like a bird you know she will fly fly fly away  
See her walking on down the street  
Look at all your friends that shes gonna meet  
  
Shes gonna bawl and shout  
Shes gonna work it  
Shes gonna work it out bye bye  
Bye bye baby  
All right
