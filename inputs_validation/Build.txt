  
Now Thats What I Call Quite Good  
  
Clambering men in big bad boots  
Dug up my den dug up my roots  
Treated us like plasticine town  
They build us up and knocked us down  
  
From Meccano to Legoland  
Here they come with a brick in their hand  
Men with heads filled up with sand  
Its build  
  
Chorus  
Its build a house where we can stay  
Add a new bit everyday  
Its build a road for us to cross  
Build us lots and lots and lots and lots  
  
Whistling men in yellow vans  
They came and drew us diagrams  
Showed us how it all worked out  
And wrote it down in case of doubt  
  
Slow slow quick quick quick  
Its wall to wall and brick to brick  
They work so fast it makes you sick  
Its build  
  
Chorus  
Oh Its buildx4  
  
Down with sticks and up with bricks  
In with boots and up with roots  
Its in with suits and new recruits  
Its build  
  
Chorus
