I dont need a perfect lover to hold me in the rain  
Someone to ease my pain when I feel blue  
If I lost you to another think Id drown out here for sure  
Wont you stay with me and be my only cure  
  
Dark skies may cloud my day  
But that dont bother me  
As long as I can hold you close to me  
  
I dont need a part time lover to leave me in the cold  
With empty arms to hold when I need you  
Tell me that there is no other send the cold wind from my door  
Give you all my love and more if you want me to  
  
Dark skies may cloud my day  
But that dont bother me  
As long as I can hold you close to me
