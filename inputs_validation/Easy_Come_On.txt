Everybody called the lady Easy  
For the way the lady was to please  
Everybody told her she was crazy  
Lovin all that love away for free  
  
People hate to see you make it Easy  
Theyll never understand  
Some take life for granted  
Cause it seems to take so long  
Easy takes it any way she can  
  
Chorus  
Easy come on take it easy  
Come on here we go again  
Let it go as easy as you can  
Its the sweetest and the saddest place  
A bodys ever been  
Feelin Easy come and go again  
  
Easy  
To please  
She was crazy  
And Free  
  
So lets take our time and make it Easy  
Bring that bottle from the shelf  
Everybodys laughin when theres money love and friends  
When theyre gone the jokes are on yourself  
  
Chorus  
  
Easy come on take it easy  
Come on here we go again  
Bring us down a bottle from the shelf  
Cause its easy come to anyone with money love and friends  
When theyre gone the jokes are on yourself
