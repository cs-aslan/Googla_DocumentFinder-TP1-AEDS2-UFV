Pumps and a bump now many say a big butt  
But if youre hip you know that its a phone crud  
Its making the brothers go crazy in the 2G  
Shake like a bottle girl fine as wine G  
So when I here I got a step to a fine thing  
Never been a coward cause its a eastside thing  
Just step right up to the girl with the big butt  
Tell her whats up you got the pumps and a bump  
Men Ooooh Everyone for the rest of your life theres a girl fucking tight  
Ladies All everyone theres a man who is tight who can hit it all night  
We gotta get the pumps
