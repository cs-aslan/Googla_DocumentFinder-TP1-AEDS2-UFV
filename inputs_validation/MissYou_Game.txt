Been so long since we brokeup  
But it still feels just the same  
Still feels like Im a pawn  
Playing the missyou game  
  
The same sun rises and then it sets  
The waves toss and turn and break  
The clocks tick away louder each time  
But I still lie here awake  
  
The croked smile still appiers  
When some one mentions your name  
Gonna be a victom forever  
A victom of this missyou game  
  
Time is the only strong whip  
That can make my wild passions tame  
Till then Im on the board forever  
Dragging on the miss you game
