Someones rocking my dreamboat  
Someones invading my dream  
We were sailing along  
So peaceful and calm  
Suddenly something went wrong  
  
Someones rocking my dreamboat  
Disturbing the beautiful dream  
Its a mystery to me  
This mutiny at sea  
Who can it be  
  
A friendly breeze gave us a start  
To a paradise of our own  
All at once a storm blew us apart  
And left me drifting alone  
  
Someones rocking my dreamboat  
Im captain without any crew  
But with love as my guide  
Ill follow the tide  
Ill keep sailing til I find you
