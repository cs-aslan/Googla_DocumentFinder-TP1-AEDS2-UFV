Now Im the king of the swingers  
Oh the jungle VIP  
Ive reached the top and had to stop  
And thats what botherin me  
I wanna be a man mancub  
And stroll right into town  
And be just like the other men  
Im tired of monkeyin around  
  
Oh oobee doo  
I wanna be like you  
I wanna walk like you  
Talk like you too  
Youll see its true  
An ape like me  
Can learn to be humen too  
  
Gee cousin Louie  
Youre doin real good  
  
Now heres your part of the deal cuz  
Lay the secret on me of mans red fire  
  
But I dont know how to make fire  
  
Now dont try to kid me mancub  
I made a deal with you  
What I desire is mans red fire  
To make my dream come true  
Give me the secret mancub  
Clue me what to do  
Give me the power of mans red flower  
So I can be like you  
  
You  
I wanna be like you  
I wanna talk like you  
Walk like you too  
Youll see its true  
Someone like me

Like someone like you  
Can learn to be  
Like someone like me
