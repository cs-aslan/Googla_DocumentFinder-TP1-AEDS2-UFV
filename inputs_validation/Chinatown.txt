Living and dying  
In Chinatown  
Yes theyre living and dying down in old Chinatown  
In Chinatown  
You better look around  
Man you dont stand a chance if you go down in Chinatown  
Man you dont stand a chance if you go down in Chinatown  
  
Laughing and crying you know its a fact  
Theyre not laughing they are crying  
Cause they wont be back  
Oh no you dont come back  
Not from Chinatown  
Man you dont stand a chance if you go down in Chinatown  
Man you dont stand a chance if you go down in Chinatown  
  
Chinatown its a different scene  
There are people there they are so obscene  
If you see what I mean  
Then theyve sold you the dream  
Down in Chinatown  
What goes up it must come down  
  
Living and dying  
There is no release  
Living and dying  
There is no relief  
There is no beliefs  
Not in Chinatown  
Man you dont stand a chance if you go down in Chinatown  
Man you dont stand a chance if you go down in Chinatown
