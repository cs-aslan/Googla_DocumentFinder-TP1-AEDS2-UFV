Ramblin about  
Down through the South  
I find things are a changing a lot  
Especially me  
Its easy to see  
Montgomerys still hotand Im not  
I stopped by today  
At Hank Williamss grave  
My hero from the days of my youth  
Was that him or me  
That I used to be  
In the times when I searched for the truth  
  
Chorus  
Hank you were my inspiration  
And I was obsessed with your ways  
But to tell you the truth  
Its no thanks to you  
That Im still living today  
Hank I still love your music  
And in spite of the things Ive just said  
Youll always be  
A hero to me  
  
But the Hank Williams syndrome is dead  
The new hats are here  
And its increasingly clear  
Our day is slipping on by  
Theyre not like me and you  
But thats alrighttoo  
They could keep the music alive  
  
Chorus
