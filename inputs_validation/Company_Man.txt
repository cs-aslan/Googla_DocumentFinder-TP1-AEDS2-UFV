It seems youve been living on your own  
Lonely and free  
Looking to make yourself known same as me  
Well I see you in the public eyes  
I see youre looking fine  
The boy would be a businessman  
And he signs the bottom line  
  
Singing company man  
Do what you can with my name  
Rock and roll man here I am  
Im staking my claim to fame  
  
Hes got the smiling face of a friend  
Still youre not quite certain you know him  
The smile turns into a grin  
What do you owe him  
You know you owe him  
  
So if theres something you do well  
Something youre proud of  
Better to save some for yourself  
If thats allowed  
The crowd will never know you  
Youll hardly know yourself  
Theyll turn you round  
And blow you up till  
You think youre someone else  
  
Singing company man  
Do what you can with my name  
Rock and roll man here I am  
Im staking my claim to fame  
  
He can turn your time to gold  
You better make as much as you can my friend  
Cause his money will turn you old  
And they need a young man  
The job takes a young man
