Written By Cohen Performed In Night Magic  
  
Michael We were chosen we were chosen  
Miles and miles apart  
I to love your kingdom  
You to love my heart  
  
Angels We were chosen  
We do what must  
What must be done  
  
Michael The love is intermittent  
The discipline continues  
I work on your spirit  
You work on my sinews  
  
Angels We work on his sinews  
And the discipline continues  
  
We have fun cause  
We do what must  
What must be done  
  
Michael I watch myself from where you are  
Please do not be mistaken  
The spider web you see me through  
Is the view Ive always taken  
  
  
Begin the ceremony now  
That we have been preparing  
Im tired of this marble floor  
That we have both been sharing  
  
Angels Now we will be sharing  
What he has been preparing  
  
Girls Hes the only one  
Hes the only one  
Hes the riddle of the music  
Hes the music of my life  
  
Boys Now it begins  
Now it begins  
Hes the riddle of the music  
Hes the music of the sacrifice  
  
Valkyries Messenger  
Messenger  
Our will  
Will be done  
  
Angels We work on his sinews  
And the discipline continues  
  
Everyone Begin the ceremony  
Begin the sacrifice
