Welcome to the show the great finales finally here  
I thank you for coming into my theater of fear  
Welcome to the show youre all witnesses you see  
A privileged invitation to the last rites of me  
Remember me You cant save me  
Mama you never needed me  
No crimson king look in my eyes youll see  
Mama Im lonely its only me its only me  
I dont wanna be I dont wanna be I dont wanna be  
The crimson idol of a million  
I dont wanna be I dont wanna be I dont wanna be  
The crimson idol of a million eyes of a million  
I am the prisoner of the paradise I dreamed  
The idol of a million lonely faces look at me  
Behind the mask of sorrow four doors of doom behind my eyes  
Ive got their footprints all across my crimson mind  
Long live long live  
Long live the king of mercy  
Long live long live  
There is no love to shelter me  
Only love love set me free  
No love to shelter me only love love set me free  
I was the warrior with an anthem in my soul  
The idol of eight thousand lonely days of rage ago  
And remember me when it comes your time to choose  
Be careful what you wish for it might come true  
Long live long live  
Long live the king of mercy  
Long live long live  
There is no love to shelter me  
Only love love set me free  
No love to shelter me only love love set me free  
Red crimson red am I the invisible boy  
The straps on my back  
Red crimson red no I was never to be  
Only one crimson son no it never was me  
Living in the limelight little did I know  
I was dying in the shadows and the mirror was my soul  
It was all I ever wanted everything I dreamed  
But the dream became my nightmare no one could hear me scream  
With these sixstrings I make a noose  
To take my life its time to choose  
The headlines read of my demise yeah suicide of my suicide  
Oh sweet silence where is the sting  
I am no idol no crimson king  
Im the impostor the world has seen  
My father was the idol it was never me  
I dont wanna be I dont wanna be I dont wanna be  
The crimson idol of a million  
I dont wanna be I dont wanna be no I dont wanna be  
The crimson idol of a million eyes  
No love to shelter me  
Only love love set me free  
No love to shelter me only love love set me free
