Do you hear me  
Do you hear me  
Do you hear me  
Do you hear me  
Do you hear me  
Do you hear me  
Just because you can  
You treat me like a fool  
But just because you can  
Dont make it right  
Can it be so hard  
To be a little kind  
And you could be here  
With me tonight  
Ive got feelings  
Dont be unkind  
Feelings  
Dont be unkind  
Feelings  
Stay with me tonight  
Youve been stealing  
Thats so unkind  
Stealing  
A heart a mind  
Stealing  
Stay with me tonight  
Cruel young lover  
Blow your mind out  
Time will come when  
You will find out  
Time will take your cruel power away  
Cruel young lover  
Try to stand out  
Will it always pay  
To bland out  
Time will take your cruel power away  
Do you hear me  
Do you hear me  
Do you hear me  
Do you hear me  
Do you hear me  
Do you hear me  
Once again youre gone  
Somewhere in the night  
Disappearing  
Leaving me alone  
The lure of city streets  
The pull of unknown souls  
The overpowering draw  
Of the unknown  
Youve been stealing  
Thats so unkind  
Stealing  
A heart a mind  
Im appealing  
Stay with me tonight  
Cruel young lover  
Hit the action  
Can you live on your attraction  
Time may take your cruel power away  
Cruel young lover  
Try to stand out  
Will it always pay  
To bland out  
Time will take your cruel power away  
Cruel young lover  
Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
Do you hear me  
Cruel young lover  
Do you hear me  
Do you hear me  
Cruel young lover  
Do you hear me  
Cruel young lover  
Do you hear me  
Do you hear me  
Cruel young lover  
Ah ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah ah  
Do you hear me  
Cruel young lover  
Ah ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah ah  
Do you hear me  
Cruel young lover  
Ah ah ah ah ah  
Thats so unkind  
Do you hear me  
Thats so unkind  
Do you hear me  
Thats so unkind  
Cruel young lover  
Thats so unkind  
Do you hear me  
Do you hear me  
Do you hear me  
Ah ah ah ah ah  
Cruel young lover  
Thats so unkind  
Do you hear me  
Thats so unkind

Do you hear me  
Thats so unkind  
Do you hear me  
Do you hear me  
Cruel young lover  
Cruel young lover  
Do you hear me

Do you hear me  
Thats so unkind
