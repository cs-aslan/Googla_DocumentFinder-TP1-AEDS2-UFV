Driving in my car smoking my cigar  
The only time Im happys when I play my guitar  
  
Sailing in my yacht what a lot I got  
Happiness is something that just cannot be bought  
  
Ive been in and Im out Ive been up and down  
I dont want to go until Ive been all around  
  
Whats it all about anyone in doubt  
I dont want to go until Ive found it all out
