One dayI gotta get out of here  
I gotta make everything clear  
I gotta see you  
I knowthe way that I feel is wrongso wrong  
But I gotta carry on when you aint around  
  
I believe things are going wrong  
And the night goes on and on  
All your dreams have flown away  
And the sun wont shine today  
  
Chorus  
The lights go down  
The lights go down  
The lights go down and theres no one around  
  
I knowyoure waiting so close to me  
But how will you ever see as time rolls away  
Lonely but tryin to be so proud  
And just as I turn around the lights go down  
  
I believe things are going wrong  
And the night goes on and on  
All your dreams have flown away  
And the sun wont shine today  
  
Chorus
