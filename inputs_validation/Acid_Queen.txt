If your child aint all he should be now  
This girl will put him right  
Ill show him what he could be now  
Just give me one night  
  
Im the gypsy the acid queen  
Pay me before I start  
Im the gypsy and Im guaranteed  
To mend his aching heart  
  
Give us a room close the door  
Leave us for a while  
You wont be a boy no more  
Young but not a child  
  
Chorus  
Im the gypsy the acid queen  
Pay me before I start  
Im the gypsy Im guaranteed  
  
To tear your soul apart  
  
Gather your wits and hold them fast  
Your mind must learn to roam  
Just as the gypsy queen must do  
Youre gonna hit the road  
  
My works been done now look at him  
Hes never been more alive  
His head it shakes his fingers clutch  
Watch his body writhe  
  
Chorus  
  
To break your little heart  
  
If your child aint all he should be now  
This girl will put him right  
Ill show him what he could be now  
Just give me one more night  
  
Chorus  
  
To tear your soul apart
