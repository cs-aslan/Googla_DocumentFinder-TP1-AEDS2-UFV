Believe in me send us money  
Died on the cross and that aint funny  
But my so called friends theyre making me a joke  
They missed out what I said like I never spoke  
They choose what they want to hear they dont tell a lie  
They just leave out the truth as theyre watching you die  
Theyre saving your souls by taking your money  
Flies around shit bees around honey  
  
Chorus  
Holy Smoke Holy Smoke plenty bad preachers for  
The Devil to stoke  
Feedem in feet first this is no joke  
This is thirsty work making Holy Smoke yeah  
making Holy Smoke  
  
Jimmy Reptile and all his friends  
Say they gonna be with you at the end  
Burning records burning books  
Holy soldiers nazi looks  
Crocodile smiles just wait a while  
Till the TV queen gets her makeup clean  
Ive lived in filth Ive lived in sin  
And I still smell cleaner than the shit youre in  
  
Chorus  
  
Holy Smoke smells good  
  
They aint religious but they aint no fools  
When Noah built his cadillac it was cool  
Two by two theyre still going down  
And the satellite circus just left town  
I think theyre strange and when theyre dead  
They can have a Lincoln for their bed  
Friend of the president trick of the tail  
Now they aint got a prayer 100 years in jail  
  
Chorus  
  
Holy Smoke
