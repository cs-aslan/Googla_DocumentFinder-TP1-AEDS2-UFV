Its sunshine life for me  
If I could get away from this cloud over me  
Seems to just follow me around  
  
Theres a good life had for free  
When youre out in the country  
Thats what I could use  
If I could get away there soon  
  
Its a sunshine life for me  
If I could get away from this cloud over me  
Seems to just follow me around  
  
Theres a good life had at sea  
If youre not in the navy  
Thats the life for you  
Sail away raymond sail away  
  
Now most folks just bore me  
Always imposing and Id rather meet a tree  
Somewhere out in the cornfield  
  
And its a sunshine   
Its a sunshine life for me  
If I could get away from this cloud over me  
Seems to just follow me around
