Man this fuckin bitch  
Took off fuckin with some college graduate  
Punk ass Abercrombie wearin motherfucker  
Left me broken hearted in the Chevy  
Its all good though know why  
I got me bitch  
  
Both of us was in the same class in oh two Antioch NashVille  
And I wanted you so bad  
That I forgot to mind my manners  
Everybody wanted them panties  
Every guy was hopin to land it  
We would flirt around and touch hands  
Until we fucked around and took Xanex  
And thats when you began to drive me bananas  
I was in denial its apparent  
You began to lie to your parents  
You should know that I cant live  
Without you holdin my name  
Now my hearts in control of my brain  
And I cant hold it in the lanes  
  
Rollin down 20 man  
With this Jack in my cup feelin down on my luck  
And Im doin 120 man  
Maybe Im givin up baby Im givin up  
Baby what is happening  
Dont you believe in us Dont you believe in us  
She said I know you gave me everything  
But love is not enough love is not enough love is not enough  
  
Used to fuck so much we missed school  
You was there when I needed you  
I was there when you needed me  
We were inseparable  
And I was broke with no fuckin food  
You was tough enough to be cool  
Skate holes all in my shoes  
Dope boys had me confused  
I was in love with hiphop  
You was in love with that to  
What made it come to a stop  
Had to have been the money issue bitch  
And I really miss the rain  
I gave you all of my soul and I got left was a key chain  
  
Rollin down 20 man  
With this Jack in my cup feelin down on my luck  
And Im doin 120 man  
Maybe Im givin up baby Im givin up  
Baby what is happening  
Dont you believe in us Dont you believe in us  
She said I know you gave me everything  
But love is not enough love is not enough love is not enough  
  
Who the fuck are you fuckin now  
Bet hes always takin you out  
College educated and proud  
Me well Im just a drop out  
Cant really blame you for buggin  
Aint I the dirt on your rug and  
Just a place to wipe your shoes  
And give me all your thrown away lovin  
Back to my buzzin and druggin  
Back to my gutter with nothin  
Back to the rut all of a sudden  
cracks in the covenant trust in me  
You aint gotta worry bout sharin this success with Wayne  
Now its just petty change  
But I still feel the pain  
  
Rollin down 20 man  
With this Jack in my cup feelin down on my luck  
And Im doin 120 man  
Maybe Im givin up baby Im givin up  
Baby what is happening  
Dont you believe in us Dont you believe in us  
She said I know you gave me everything  
But love is not enough love is not enough love is not enough
