Five million guys have tried to reduce her  
To another girl out in the street  
All those pretty eyes have lied to seduce her  
But they come crawlin back at her feet  
  
Too many times Ive seen them abuse her  
Just like the times Ive been deceived  
The touch of her starlight makes me happy  
I can see her shinin through in my dreams  
  
And I wake up cryin   
Chorus  
Please me   
Please me baby  
Please me   
Please me out of my heeaeaeaad  
Please me baby  
  
Everybodys been a toy for someone  
So take me if you want to play  
Tease me even if its only for fun  
And let me play the game on another day  
  
Chorus  
  
Please me baby  
Please me baby  
Please me baby  
Please me baby please me baby  yeah  
Please me baby  
Please me baby please   
Please me baby  
Please me baby  
  
Suck it
