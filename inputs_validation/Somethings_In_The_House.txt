Memories lost in the faded films  
Of my life  
And a friend that used to be  
Something special to me  
Red wine and good times  
If you dont feel at all  
There is no point in going on tonight  
Somethings in the house  
Somethings on the stairs  
Wars in the air  
The queer is out of order  
And me Im on the ground  
But thats no place to be  
  
Jack Burroughs says what you doing  
Oh me Im going home  
Oh what a shame  
Nothing has changed  
And nothing is new  
These days
