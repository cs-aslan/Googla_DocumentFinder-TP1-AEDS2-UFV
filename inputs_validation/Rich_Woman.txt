I got a woman with plenty of money  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
called my baby late last night  
She told me daddy everything was all right  
  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
  
I dont have to worry cause shes real fine  
I know my baby and shes all mine  
She give me a Cadillac a diamond ring  
She told me daddy dont you worry bout a thing  
  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
  
Shes all mine and Im so glad  
Shes the best woman that I ever had  
Shes all mine and Im so glad  
Shes all mine and Im so glad  
Shes all mine and Im so glad  
  
Ah stop your train  
Ah mama stop your train
