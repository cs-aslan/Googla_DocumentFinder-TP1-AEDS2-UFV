Come to me baby mine  
And Ill make love to you  
Just when the sun begins to shine  
On the morning dew  
Ive been gone far away  
The days they seemed like years  
Right by your side Im gonna stay  
Kiss away your tears  
Gently Ill wake you  
I wont hardly shake you  
Gently Ill wake you  
I wont hardly shake you  
And Ill make sweet love to you  
Hold me tight dont let go  
Well dream the whole day through  
I missed you more than you could know  
I love only you  
Come to me baby mine  
And Ill make love to you  
Just when the sun begins to shine  
On the morning dew  
Gently Ill wake you  
I wont hardly shake you  
Gently Ill wake you  
I wont hardly shake you  
And Ill make sweet love to you
