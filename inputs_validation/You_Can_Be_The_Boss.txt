You taste like the fourth of July  
Malt liquor on your breath my my  
I love you but I dont know why  
  
You can be the boss daddy  
You can be the boss  
Taste like a keg party back on the sauce  
I like you a lot I like you a lot  
Dont let it stop  
You can be the boss daddy  
You can be the boss  
Bad to the bone sick as a dog  
You know that I like like you a lot  
Dont let it stop  
  
He had a cigarette with his number on it  
He gave it over to me do you want it  
I knew it was wrong but I palmed it  
I saved it I waited I called it  
The liquor on your lips the liquor on your lips  
The liquor on your lips makes you dangerous  
I knew it was wrong Im beyond it  
I tried to be strong but I lost it  
  
You taste like the fourth of July  
Malt liquor on your breath my my  
  
You can be the boss daddy  
You can be the boss  
Taste like a keg party back on the sauce  
I like you a lot I like you a lot  
Dont let it stop  
You can be the boss daddy  
You can be the boss  
Bad to the bone sick as a dog  
You know that I like like you a lot  
Dont let it stop  
  
He has a white corvette like I want it  
A fire in his eyes no I saw it  
Hes bleeding from his brain and his wallet  
Hes sick and hes taken but honest  
The liquor on your lips the liquor on your lips  
The liquor on his lips I just cant resist  
As close as Ill get to the darkness  
He tells me to shut up I got this  
  
You taste like the fourth of July  
Malt liquor on your breath my my  
  
You can be the boss daddy  
You can be the boss  
Taste like a keg party back on the sauce  
I like you a lot I like you a lot  
Dont let it stop  
You can be the boss daddy  
You can be the boss  
Bad to the bone sick as a dog  
You know that I like like you a lot  
Dont let it stop  
  
I need you I need you babe  
Like I never needed anyone  
Youre wrong but youre so much fun  
You say you trat me mean to keep  
The opinion of that night  
But you taste like the fourth of July  
Malt liquor on your breath my my
