Oh oh oh oh oh  
Yeah  
  
You have so many relationships in this life  
Only one or two will last  
You go through all the pain and strife  
Then you turn your back and theyre gone so fast  
Oh yeah  
And theyre gone so fast yeah  
Oh  
So hold on the ones who really care  
In the end theyll be the only ones there  
And when you get old and start losing your hair  
Can you tell me who will still care  
Can you tell me who will still care  
Oh care
