I saw you with that girl last night  
The both of you were making eyes  
You did it right in front of my face  
As if I had no pride  
  
And now youre always working late  
You never have much time for me  
And youre expecting me to believe  
That youre not out with she  
  
Tonight I give you my surprise  
I hope that you wont mind  
Im giving you an eye for an eye  
Baby Ive found another  
  
And he is my lover  
And Im going out for the rest of your life  
  
I betcha never thought Id go that far  
I betcha never thought Id break your heart  
I betcha never even thought at all  
I betcha never no you never  
  
I know that everybody lies that I know I cant deny  
But what if theyre intentional  
The intention of your crimes  
Cause I know how much that I can take  
  
I know my heart demands a change  
If I cant have my way then all I have to say  
Tonight I give you my surprise  
In return for all the lies  
Im giving you and eye for an eye  
Baby Ive found another  
  
And he is my lover  
And were going away for the rest of your life
