Dying to live  
Living to die  
Aint no hellos here  
Nothing but goodbye  
Its like singing a song that cannot be sung  
Its like having to end child  
Whats yet to love begun  
  
Chorus  
Hey hey hey now  
Where I am at times I just cant tell  
Hey hey hey now  
Im lost somewhere between heaven and hell  
  
All that you know and all that you knew  
In the end child  
Tell me whats it all mean to you  
Dont forget just who and where you are  
You can spread your wings son  
But dont you spread yourself too far  
  
Hey hey hey now  
Where I am at times I just cant tell  
Hey hey hey now  
Im lost somewhere between heaven and hell
