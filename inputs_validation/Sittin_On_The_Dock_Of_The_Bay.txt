Sittin in the mornin sun  
Ill be sittin when the evening comes  
Watchin the ships roll in  
Then I watch em roll away again yeah  
  
Im sittin on the dock of the bay  
Watchin the tide roll away  
Just sittin on the dock of the bay  
Wastin time  
  
I left my home in Georgia  
Headed for the Frisco Bay  
I have nothing to live for  
Look like nothings gonna come my way yeah  
  
So Im sittin on the dock of the bay  
Watchin the tide roll away  
Yes Im just sittin on the dock of the bay  
Wastin time  
  
Look like nothings gonna change  
Everything still remains the same  
I cant do what ten people tell me to do  
So I guess Ill remain the same  
  
Sittin hear resting my bones  
And this loneliness wont leave me alone yeah  
But two thousand miles I roam  
Just to make this dock my home yeah  
  
Now Im sittin at the dock of the bay  
Watching the tide roll away yeah  
Im just sittin on the dock of the bay  
Wasting time
