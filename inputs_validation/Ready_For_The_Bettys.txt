You gotta bang your Betty bongos  
And bring your Betty bass guitar yeah yeah  
And with the Betty backbeat  
Youll go Betty Betty far  
  
So drop your boring baggage  
And come with Missy Tink and Crash  
Theres a Betty Theres a Betty bandwagon  
Going to a Betty bash Going to a Betty bash  
  
Get ready for the Bettys ready for the Bettys  
Get ready for the Bettys ready for the Bettys  
Ready for the Bettys  
Get ready for the Bettys ready for the Bettys  
Its the best thing you can do  
Get ready for the Bettys cause the Bettys are ready for you
