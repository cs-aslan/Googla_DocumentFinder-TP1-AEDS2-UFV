In a dogs life  
A year is really more like seven  
And all too soon a canine  
Will be chasing cars in doggie heaven  
  
It seems to me  
As we make our own few circles round the sun  
We get it backwards  
And our seven years go by like one  
  
Dog yearsIts the season of the itch  
Dog yearsWith every scratch it reappears  
  
In the dog days  
People look to Sirius  
Dogs cry for the moon  
But these connections are mysterious  
  
It seems to me  
While its true that every dog will have his day  
When all the bones are buried  
There is barely time to go outside and play  
  
Dog yearsIts the season of the itch  
Dog yearsWith every scratch it reappears  
Dog yearsFor every sad son of a bitch  
Dog yearsWith his tail between his ears  
  
Id rather be a tortoise from Galapagos  
Or a span of geological time  
Than be living in these dog years  
  
In a dogs brain  
A constant buzz of lowlevel static  
One sniff at the hydrant  
And the answer is automatic  
  
It seems to me  
As well make our own few circles round the block  
Weve lost our senses  
For the higherlevel static of talk
