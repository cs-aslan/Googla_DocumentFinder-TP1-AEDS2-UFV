Walking stiff let me tall ya  
Better left for dead  
And now we are on a mission  
Well its full speed ahead  
My legions when we do the crime  
Lets get one thing straight  
To get there early is on time  
And showing up on time is late  
Ladies and gents were still alive  
By the skin of our teeth now its killing time  
Angel in our pocket devil by our side  
We aint going nowhere cuz heroes never die  
Still alive  
Blood of heroes  
Never die  
They never die  
Weve been run down every hill  
Chased up all the dead end streets  
But if you try to cut us out  
Youll get a kick in the teeth  
Ladies and Gents were still alive  
By the skin of our teeth now its killing time  
Fasten up you head belts  
Time to ride the skies  
Its time to be immortal cuz heroes never die
