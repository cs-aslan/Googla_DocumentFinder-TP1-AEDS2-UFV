Ive got my cat in the yard  
And Ive got my car in the street  
And Ive got my nose to the stone  
What I dont have is you  
Cause I didnt know  
  
I got my way  
And you got yours  
  
Ive got my hole in the wall  
Somewhere I can go when the sky begins to fall  
Ive got my candles to burn  
What I dont have is you  
Cause I didnt learn  
  
I got my way  
And you got yours  
  
Ive got my CDs to turn  
Ive got my lessons to learn  
And Ive got my coat for the road  
What I dont have is you  
Cause I didnt know  
  
I got my way  
And you got yours
