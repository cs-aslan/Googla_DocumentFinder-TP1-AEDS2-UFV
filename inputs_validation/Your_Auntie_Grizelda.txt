She knows her mind all right your Auntie Grizelda  
She says she knows my kind she might maybe so  
Oh yeah shes raised you right your Auntie Grizelda  
You only know the things she wants you to know  
  
I know shes having a fit  
She doesnt like me a bit  
No bird of grace ever lit on Auntie Grizelda  
  
You cant begrudge her style your Auntie Grizelda  
She couldnt budge a smile and do it for free  
So righteous making fudge your Auntie Grizelda  
So proper judging others over her tea  
  
You look just like her you do  
I know by looking at you  
That youve been listening to your Auntie Grizelda  
  
Oh no dont look at me like Auntie Grizelda  
It takes much more to be someone of your own  
Youve got to make it free from Auntie Grizelda  
Or just like her youll have to make it alone  
  
I know shes having a fit  
She doesnt like me a bit  
No bird of grace ever lit on Auntie Grizelda  
  
Auntie Grizelda Auntie Grizelda
