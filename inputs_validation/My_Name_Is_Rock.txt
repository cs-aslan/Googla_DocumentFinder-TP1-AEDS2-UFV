Fly with new blast get gas  
Kid Rock some folks thought Id flew right past  
Faded fast ran outta gas  
Here I come again all back in that ass  
  
No questions I tell no lies  
Rely Kid Rock is on the rise  
Like a sky scraper  
Im back like smack and so are the vapors  
  
And the papers cause Im gonna rhyme  
Right jump right back up into the lime light  
And Im rackin my brain where the pain was  
No I got more soul than the train does  
  
Mid western funkin car pumpin from the amps in the trunkin  
Ya cant stop this boy this time  
Im the real macoy  
And you know My name is Rock  
  
You know My name is Rock Repeat x 7  
  
So hey punk feel the funk  
Feel the wrath of the rock  
Non stop I got a glock in my pants  
I dont dance I sit around  
  
I dont sip 40s I pound  
I been around too long commin too strong  
Kid Rock got it goin on  
See me see you see through emcees who knew  
  
Fly like the wind I hang like a hinge  
Been gone like rhymes on a drinkin binge  
So dont cringe at the sight of Rock  
Ya want to fight the rock ya gotta fight this glock  
  
And you can say my beats are fake  
But it dont mean shit when your gettin paid  
HipHop the jam dont stop  
  
You know My name is Rock Repeat x 7  
  
Im the D to the O P to the D  
O to the straight up G see  
I been around like Jesus layin tracks  
But I had to come back I had to come back  
  
Back from the dead enough said  
Still trippin like Fred  
Be red ya got a head full of holes  
I got a head full of bowls  
  
Im the KI straight from the D punk  
From the home of the be funk  
Aint no frontin here I wont disapear  
Ill be around next year  
  
Im the Jiffymack  
In the rack writin off for some ify crack  
Last year this year its all the same  
But you know my name is Rock  
  
You know My name is Rock Repeat x 8  
  
KIDs the name
