Im on my second cup of coffee and I still cant face the day  
Im thinking of the lady who got lost along the way  
And if I dont stop this trembling hand from reaching for the phone  
Ill be reachin for the bottle Lord before this day is done  
  
Im on my second cup of coffee and I still cant face the day  
The room was filled with laughs as we danced the night away  
But my sleep was filled with dreaming of the wrongs that I had done  
And the gentle sweet reminder of a daughter and a son  
  
Sitting alone my friends have all gone home  
You never know when theyll come droppin in  
Thinking of girls with their fingers in my curls  
Too young to understand how love begins  
  
Im on my second cup of coffee and I still cant face the dawn  
The radio is playin a soft country song  
And if I dont stop this trembling hand from reaching for the phone  
Ill be reachin for the bottle Lord before this day is done
