Now that the truth is hard to face  
I cant forget you once were mine  
Someone else is in my place  
Whenever we meet my heart beats out of time  
  
Just a little bit of green  
Clouds my eyes to what Ive seen  
Just a little bit of green  
When I see you with someone new  
And knowing that theres nothing I can do  
  
Please dont try to tie me down  
Those are the words you often say  
I cant help seeing you around  
You smile with surprise I turn my eyes away  
  
Just a little bit of green  
Ohohho clouds my eyes to what Ive seen  
Just a little bit of green  
When I see you with someone new  
And knowing that theres nothing I can do  
  
Ohohohohohoh  
  
Just a little bit of green  
Ohohho clouds my eyes to what Ive seen  
Just a little bit of green  
When I see you with someone new  
And knowing that theres nothing I can do  
  
Ohohohohohoh  
Just a little bit of green
