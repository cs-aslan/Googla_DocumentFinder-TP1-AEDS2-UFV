You led me to the cross  
And I saw the face of mercy in that place of love  
You opened up my eyes  
To believe Your sweet salvation  
Where Id been so blind  
Now that Im living in Your all forgiving love  
My every road leads to the cross  
  
Jesus keep me near the cross  
I wont forget the love Youve shown  
Savior teach me of the cross  
I wont forget the love  
I wont forget the love Youve shown  
  
And theres an empty tomb  
That tells me of Your resurrection and my life in You  
The stone lies rolled away  
Nothing but those folded grave clothes  
Where Your body lay  
Now that Im living as a risen child of God  
My every road leads to the cross
