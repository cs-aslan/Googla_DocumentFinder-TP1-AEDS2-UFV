Lonely grief is hounding me  
Like the lonely shadow hounding me  
Its always there just out of sight  
Like a fragling tree on a lightening night  
Lonely wind cries out my name  
  
Sad as haunted music in the rain  
Its born of grief and born of woe  
But I hear it call and Ive got to go  
Where can I be headed for  
The blues call in my north  
To lick my heart once more  
Love lives in a lonely land  
Where theres no helping hand to understand  
Why does it bring this hate to me  
Why it dont matter why  
I only know misery has to be part of me  
Never hope to count on love  
To be a partner of that heaven above  
Never hope to understand  
Love is a barrel land  
A lonely land a lonely land
