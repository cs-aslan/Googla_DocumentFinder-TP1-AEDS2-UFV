So you figure that youve got him all figured out  
Hes a sweet talkin stud  
Who can melt a girls heart with his pout  
Hes the kind of lover that the ladies dream about  
  
Hes got plenty of cash  
Hes got plenty of friends  
He drives women wild  
Then he drives off in a MercedesBenz  
Hes got a long wick with a flame at both ends  
Hes hot  
  
But dont let him go  
Just give him a chance to grow  
Take it easy take it slow  
And dont let him go  
  
He makes you so angry  
He makes you so sore  
The weight may be worth it  
But how can you wait anymore  
When youre wonderin what youre waitin for  
Baby I dont know  
  
But dont let him go  
He just needs a chance to grow  
Take it easy take it slow  
And dont let him go  
Dont let him go
