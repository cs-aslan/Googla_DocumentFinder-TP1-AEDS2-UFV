Oh its night again  
And the dark just killed the sun  
If the light must end  
Youve got time to run away  
  
Theres a door to dreams  
And it always lets you in  
But with a silent scream  
All the nightmares must begin  
  
Still you chase what you cant see  
Like death and pain and sin  
And the shadow of the wind  
The shadow of the wind  
  
Youll remember me  
I could make you disappear  
Be where you want to be  
Just as long as its not here  
  
Well Im back and stronger  
And the first ones always free  
And it lasts much longer  
You can bet your sanity  
  
Never more the victim cries  
As I slip beneath the skin  
Like the shadow of the wind  
The shadow of the wind  
  
If words had names like red and green  
And two for sympathy  
Black and white and in between  
Then youd be misery  
  
Every day is an inquisition  
Who are you What are you Why  
Im alive I belong Ill be back  
Its a half truth still a whole lie  
  
In the garden of good and evil  
Youll know but you know  
The spider only spins  
The shadow of the wind  
The shadow of the wind
