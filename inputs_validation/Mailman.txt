Hello dont you know me  
Im the dirt beneath your feet  
The most important fool you forgot to see  
Ive seen how you give it  
Now I want you to receive  
I know that you  
Would do the same for me  
  
Im know Im headed for the bottom  
But Im riding you all the way  
  
For all of your kisses turned  
To spit in my face  
For all that reminds me  
Which is my place  
For all of the times when  
You made me disappear  
This time Im sure you will  
Know that Im here  
  
Im know Im headed for the bottom  
But Im riding you all the way  
  
My place was beneath you  
But now Im above  
And now I send you a message  
Of love  
A simple remind of what  
You wont see  
A future so holy without me  
  
Im know Im headed for the bottom  
But Im riding you all the way
