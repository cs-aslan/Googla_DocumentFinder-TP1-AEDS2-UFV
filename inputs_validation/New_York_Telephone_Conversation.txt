I was sleeping gently napping when I heard the phone  
Who is on the other end talking am I even home  
Did you see what she did to him did you hear what they said  
Just a New York conversation rattling in my head  
  
Oh my and what shall we wear  
Oh my and whop really cares  
  
Just a New York conversation gossip all of the time  
Did you hear who did what to whom happens all the time  
Who has touched and who has dabbled here in the city of shows  
Openings closings bad repartee everybody knows  
  
Oh how sad why do we call  
Oh Im glad to hear from you all  
  
I am calling yes Im calling just to speak to you  
For I know this night will kill me if I cant be with you  
If I cant be with you
