You told so many lies your tongue is black with fireflies  
But you spit them out and pretend youre sneezing  
And every word is such a joke  
With so many pasts youd be ninety years old  
Dont you wonder why the room keeps on leaving  
Hey hey whats that I heard you say  
Dont think that I would never need it  
Hey hey whats that I heard you say  
Dont think that I would ever believe it  
Its just a thought and nothing more  
That all your thoughts and moves are taught  
And memorized each night before your sleeping  
And every word is such a joke  
Strung from neon masts flying flags you hope  
Will win you friends and give your life some meaning  
Hey hey whats that I heard you say  
Dont think that I would never need it  
Hey hey whats that I heard you say  
Dont think that I would ever believe it  
You told so many lies your tongue is stained with alibis  
Youve been around the world and found it pleasing  
And every word is such a joke  
With so many pasts youd be a hundred years old  
Dont you wonder why the room keeps on leaving  
Hey hey whats that I heard you say  
Dont think that I would never need it  
Hey hey whats that I heard you say  
Dont think that I would ever believe it
