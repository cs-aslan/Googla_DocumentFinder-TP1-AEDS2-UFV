I keep asking  
Whats your lie  
It is disturbing  
This isnt mine  
Days keep passing  
One notch at a time  
I dont feel right  
Please God let me sleep tonight  
  
Everyday confronted  
Fuck off its giving in  
I just want to know why  
Want to give it up but I cant escape  
  
I keep asking  
Again please try  
It is haunting  
This takes my mind  
Days keep passing  
Line after line  
I dont feel right  
  
Please God dont let me die tonight  
Everyday confronted  
Fuck off its giving in  
I just want to know why  
Want to give it up but I cant escape  
  
Please God  
Please God help me  
Please God free me  
Please God save me from my painful situation
