I never knew of heartache  
Til I messed with you  
I sure do sitting here  
And feeling all the pain  
I just cant sleep now  
Cause Im hoping that youll keep  
Another heartache for my heart again  
  
My mama taught me  
How to read from the good book  
My papa taught me  
How to win and lose a game  
They went down smiling  
cause they left me all they had  
Plus another heartache for my heart again  
  
Chorus  
But now its fine fine fine  
Cause youre with me all the time  
There to care and share the things I do  
And now its fine fine fine  
Cause youre with me all the time  
Everywhere and even nowhere too  
  
I use to make the late nights  
On a cheap weekend  
But all the women there were  
Just a crying shame  
I heard them saying  
That they didnt think Id stop  
For another heartache for my heart again  
  
Chorus  
But now its fine fine fine  
Cause youre with me all the time  
There to care and share the things I do  
And now its fine fine fine  
Cause youre with me all the time  
Everywhere and even nowhere too
