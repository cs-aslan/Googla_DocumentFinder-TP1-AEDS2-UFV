Ooh I have love sweeter than lies  
Gave you no reason not to decide  
Say you are leaving youve got too much pride  
Its not love if you have it to hide it  
  
Oh woe who is the man  
Who puts waves on the sand  
Its the stormkeeper stormkeeper  
Liven my life  
When I need to survive  
Is the storm keeping you warm  
Keeping you warm  
  
Oh I have cried so many times  
But only for things that never were mine  
Heaven is sweet love is unkind  
Thoughts are twisted inside of your mind  
  
Dont let them tell you  
That this love is wrong  
And dont let them fool you  
That this love cant go on
