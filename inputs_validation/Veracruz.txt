I heard Woodrow Wilsons guns  
I heard Maria crying  
Late last night I heard the news  
That was dying  
Veracruz was dying  
Someone called Marias name  
I swear it was my fathers voice  
Saying If you stay youll all be slain  
You must leave now  you have no choice  
Take the servants and ride west  
Keep the child close to your chest  
When the American troops withdraw  
Let Zapata take the rest  
I heard Woodrow Wilsons guns  
I heard Maria calling  
Saying Veracruz is dying  
And Cuernavacas falling  
Aquel dia yo jure On that day I swore  
Hacia el puerto volvere To the port I will return  
Aunque el destino cambio mi vida Even though destiny changed my life  
En morire In I shall die  
Aquel dia yo jure On that day I swore  
I heard Woodrow Wilsons guns  
I heard them in the harbor  
Saying Veracruz is dying
