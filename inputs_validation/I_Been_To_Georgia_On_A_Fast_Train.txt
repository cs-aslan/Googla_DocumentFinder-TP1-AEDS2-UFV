On a rainy Wednesday morning thats the way that I was born in  
That old sharecroppers one room country shack  
They said my mommie left me the day before she had me  
Said she hit the road and never once looked back  
And I just like to mention my grandmas old age pension  
Is the reason why Im standing here today  
I got all my country learning a milking and a churning  
Picking cotton raisin hell and baling hay  
I been to Georgia on a fast train honey I wouldnt born no yesterday  
I got a good Christian raisin and an eight grade education  
Aint no need in yall a treatin me this way  
  
Now sweet Carolina I dont think Ill ever find  
Another woman put together like you are  
I like your wiggle in your walking and your big city talking  
And your brand new shiny Plymouth ragtop car  
Well its hurry up and wait in this land of give and take  
It seems like haste it makes for waste everytime  
I declare to my soul when you hear those ages roll  
You better know Im gonna get my share of mine  
I been to Georgia on a fast train  
  
I been to Georgia on a fast train  
There aint no need in yall a treatin me this way
