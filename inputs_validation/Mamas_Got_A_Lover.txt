Mamas got a lover  
A painter I am told  
Shes getting out of real estate  
For the art scene down in old Soho  
Art scene down in old Soho  
  
Mamas got a lover  
He owns a gallery  
She says he likes collages  
But the moneys in graffiti  
Moneys in graffiti  
  
Chorus  
Mamas got a lover  
I met him yesterday  
She says she hopes I like him  
Maybe Ill send him a card on fathers day  
Fathers day  
  
Mamas got a lover  
Theyre backing a film  
Its about a working mother  
Who gives birth to black and white Siamese twins  
Black and white Siamese twins  
  
Mamas got a lover  
Hes got something to say  
He says hes into dirt and rot  
The essence of urban decay  
Urban decay  
  
Chorus  
  
Mamas got a lover  
I met him yesterday  
Shes starting a new chapter  
I wish she was on the last page  
The last page  
  
Chorus  
  
Mamas got a lover mamas got a lover  
Mamas got a lover mamas got a lover oh  
Mamas got a lover mamas got a lover  
My mamas got a lover mamas got a lover  
  
Mamas got a lover  
Mamas got a lover  
Mamas got a lover  
Mamas got a lover  
Mamas got a lover  
Mamas got a lover  
Mamas got a lover  
Mamas got a lover  
Mamas got a lover  
Mamas got a lover  
Mamas got a lover  
Mamas got a lover
