Id like to drop my trousers to the world  
I am a man of means of slender means  
Each household appliance  
Is like a new science in my town  
And if the day came when I felt a  
Natural emotion  
Id get such a shock Id probably jump  
In the ocean  
And when a train goes by  
Its such a sad sound  
No  
Its such a sad thing  
  
Id like to drop my trousers to the Queen  
Every sensible child will know what this means  
The poor and the needy  
Are selfish and greedy on her terms  
And if the day came when I felt a  
Natural emotion  
Id get such a shock Id probably jump  
In the ocean  
And when a train goes by  
Its such a sad sound  
No  
Its such a sad thing  
  
And when Im lying in my bed  
I think about life  
And I think about death  
And neither one particularly appeals to me  
And if the day came when I felt a  
Natural emotion  
Id get such a shock Id probably lie  
In the middle of the street and die  
Id lie down and die  
Oh oh
