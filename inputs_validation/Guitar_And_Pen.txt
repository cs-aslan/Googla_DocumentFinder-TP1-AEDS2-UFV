Youre alone above the street somewhere  
Wondering how youll ever count out there  
  
You can walk you can talk you can fight  
But inside youve got something to write  
In your hand you hold your only friend  
Never spend your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
  
When you take up a pencil and sharpen it up  
When youre kicking the fence and still nothing will budge  
When the words are immobile until you sit down  
Never feel theyre worth keeping theyre not easily found  
Then you know in some strange unexplainable way  
You must really have something  
Jumping thumping fighting hiding away  
Important to say  
  
When you sing through the verse and you end in a scream  
And you swear and you curse cause the rhyming aint clean  
But it suddenly comes after years of delay  
You pick up your guitar you can suddenly play  
When your fingers are bleeding and the knuckles are white  
Then you can be sure you can open the door  
Get off of the floor tonight  
You have something to write  
  
When you want to complain theres no one can stop you  
But when your music proclaims theres no one can top you  
You are wearing you heart on your jumping feet  
Youve got a head start away from the street  
  
But is that what you want to be rich and be gone  
Could be theres just one thing left in the end  
Your guitar and your pen  
  
When you sing to your mum and you hum and you croon  
And she says that shed like it with more of a tune  
And you smash your guitar at the end of the bed  
Then you stick it together and start writing again  
And you know that it wont be too long til your back  
To bring her some money shes calling you honey  
Stashed in a bloody great sack  
In your Cadillac  
  
Youre alone  
Youre alone  
  
Youre alone above the street somewhere  
Wondering how youll ever count out there  
  
You can walk you can talk you can fight  
But inside youve got something to write  
In your hand you hold your only friend  
Never spend your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
  
Never spend your guitar or your pen
