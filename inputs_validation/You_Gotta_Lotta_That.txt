Hey you wit the ass

Chorus x2  
A nigga need a shot a that  
And I know where they got it at  
Damn girl you gotta lotta that  
Why dontcha let a real nigga goin and handle that  
  
Look at you girl light brown ass round  
Feel like a nigga chasin down a rebound  
Its bouncin like a basketball  
If you got no ass at all  
Sorry girl but you wont make the casting call  
Skinny bitches need to find that nutritious  
Shit that makes yo ass so thick and delicious  
Is it the food or is it the water  
That make your daughter show what momma taught her  
  
Come here let me whisper in your ear  
Tell you all that bullshit that you want to hear  
Youll probably hate my fuckin guts in a year  
But right about now you like a niggas style huh  
How I talk how I smell how I smile  
How I faint how I fuck how I growl  
Fuck with me you get your meat and your vegetables  
Fuck with him you get a fuckin metro sexual  
You want a man stronger than you  
Not a motherfucker in the mirror longer than you  
Break a nail and his punk ass lookin for glue  
You want a nigga with a hard dick lookin at you  
  
Chorus  
  
You came up there lookin all cute and stuff  
You and yo home girl a pimp couldnt get enough  
You talk that shit like you wasnt up there just to fuck  
But guess what now bitch you with us

Go and split another blunt now roll it up  
Whats yo name a nigga love how you came  
You just in need of some game  
And I got that good thing

Let you party all day and hit you with that dingalang  
I got that good shit lollipop  
And once I get up in ya I make that body rock  
Yous a thick little bad bitch walk with a switch  
All you need now is some gangsta dick

Doggie Shizow to make your kitty cat meow  
Big beak freakaleak fuck some sleep
