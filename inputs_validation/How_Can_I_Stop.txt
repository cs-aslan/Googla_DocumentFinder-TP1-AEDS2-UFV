You offer me  
All your love and sympathy  
Sweet affection baby  
Its killing me  
  
Cause baby baby  
Cant you see  
How could I stop  
Once I start baby  
  
How could I stop once I start  
How could I stop  
Yeah yeah  
How could I stop once I start  
  
You look at me  
But I dont know what you see  
A reflection baby  
Of what I want to be  
  
I see your face  
And I want to roll with it  
  
But how could I stop  
Baby how could I stop  
How could I stop  
Stop it stop it  
  
If I could Id take you all the way  
Baby baby listen what I say  
Theres even some things  
That I just would not pay  
  
Cause how could I stop  
If I start babe  
How could I stop  
If I start  
Start with you  
  
How could I stop  
If I start baby  
How could I stop  
If I start with you  
  
Its too easy to lay here at your feet  
I couldnt take the heat  
Theres somewhere else  
Maybe you should go  
Baby maybe baby just a further down the road  
How could I stop  
If I start with you baby  
How could I stop  
How could I stop  
Once I start  
  
You tell me baby  
Once Ive started with you  
How could I stop  
Once I start  
  
Stop stop stop
