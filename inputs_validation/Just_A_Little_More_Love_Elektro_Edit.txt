Just a little more love just a little more peace  
Its all it takes to live a dream  
Were walking hand in hand youve got to understand  
And one day soon well live in harmony  
  
Just a little more love just a little more peace  
Its all it takes to live a dream  
  
Were walking hand in hand youve got to understand  
And one day soon well live in harmony  
  
Just a little more love just a little more peace  
Its all it takes to live a dream  
Were walking hand in hand youve got to understand  
And one day soon well live in harmony  
  
Just a little more love just a little more peace  
Its all it takes to live a dream  
Were walking hand in hand youve got to understand  
And one day soon well live in harmony  
  
Just a little more love just a little more peace  
Its all it takes to live a dream  
Were walking hand in hand youve got to understand  
And one day soon well live in harmony  
  
Just a little more love just a little more peace  
Its all it takes to live a dream  
Were walking hand in hand youve got to understand  
And one day soon well live in harmony  
  
Just a little more love just a little more peace  
Its all it takes to live a dream  
Were walking hand in hand youve got to understand  
And one day soon well live in harmony  
  
Just a little more love  
Just a little more love  
Just a little more love
