When their mother is gone  
Motherless children have a hard time  
When their mother is gone

When the mother is gone  
People say a sister will do  
When the mother is gone

Father do the best he can  
When the mother is gone  
Father do the best he can  
When the mother is gone

But theres so many things he just dont understand  
Motherless children have a hard time  
When their mother is gone  
  
I was lookin for some place to plead my case  
And Im standing here all alone  
I was framed the times they have change  
And I dont know where Im goin  
Motherless children have a hard time  
All that weepin all that cryin  
Motherless children have a hard time  
When their mother is gone
