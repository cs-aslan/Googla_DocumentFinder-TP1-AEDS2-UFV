I have learnt theres a magical spot at the hop  
Come with me to the church on the corner the hop  
Theres nuts and crisps and CCC cola on tap  
A good time had by the boys and girls at the hop  
  
Tell me what do you say  
Tell me what do you say  
  
Life begins at the hop boys and girls  
  
Prepare yourself for the boys in the band at the hop  
The cheap guitars too young for the bars at the hop  
Well jive around make fools of ourselves then stop  
Back next week with another ridiculous tie knot  
  
Tell me what do you say  
Tell me what do you say  
  
Life begins at the hop boys and girls
