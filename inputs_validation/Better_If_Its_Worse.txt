This is the place where dreams are unmade  
Cut into pieces and left in the rain  
Theyre left in the rain  
  
This is the place where hearts come undone  
Spill onto the sidewalk and crack in the sun  
  
Im boarding up my windows  
And locking all my doors  
Thats what theyre for  
Its better if its worse than before  
  
This is the day when promises break  
curl up at the edges turn into mistakes  
  
So I am smashing up my suitcase  
And sleeping on my floor  
Id rather be bored  
Its better if its worse than before  
  
Go on go on  
Go on go on  
Without me  
  
Go on go on  
Go on go on  
Without me  
  
Its better if its worse than before  
Its better if its worse than before  
Its better if its worse than before  
Its better if its worse than before
