Her name was Julie  
When she took me on a ride in her old Chevrolet  
Straight into a dusty sundown  
I knew she was gonna make up one of her stories  
And then she couldnt believe that I told her  
How much I love her lies and how much I love her games  
  
Riding on the highway  
Youre going much too far  
Youre lying so much better  
When you drive a car  
Youre lying til the sundown  
So look into my face  
Youre lying I love it  
Youre lying I love it  
Youre lying I love it  
Youre lying I love it  
Youre lying  
  
I love your games  
I love your lies  
I love your games  
Look in my eyes  
Dont believe Im worried  
When youre playing all these games  
I love your lies just hold me tight  
I got no one to blame  
Youre lying Im buying  
Im buying every word  
I love your lies  
I love your games  
  
Take me to the ballroom  
Were dancing through the night  
Im in your arms I love your lies  
They make me feel so light  
Youre lying to your shadow  
So look into my face  
Youre lying I love it  
Youre lying I love it  
Youre lying I love it  
Youre lying I love it  
Youre lying  
  
Julie stopped her car  
The sun had gone and left one of these dark red skies  
She looked in my eyes and with a smile in her face she said  
Of Course Im Lying  
But I think I love you  
  
Take me on the highway  
Youre going much too far  
Youre lying even better  
When you drive a car  
Youre lying til the sundown  
So look into my face  
Youre lying I love it  
Youre lying I love it  
Youre lying I love it  
Youre lying I love it  
Youre lying  
  
I love your games  
I love your lies  
I love your games  
Look in my eyes  
Take me in your arms and hold me tight just for tonight  
I need no drugs I love your lies  
You hide me from the night  
Youre lying Im buying  
Im buying every word  
I love your lies  
I love your games
