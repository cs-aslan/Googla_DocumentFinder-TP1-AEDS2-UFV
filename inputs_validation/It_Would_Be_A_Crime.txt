Babys got sunshine cause she dances through the rain  
Mommas got a baby so she smiles through the pain  
Daddys got a job so hes tired but inspired for a change  
Come out the window you can see it from here  
Its like a new found restoration  
A destination thats clear theyve got each other  
And thats a whole lot more than some folks have it would be a crime  
A crime if the sun forgot to shine  
A crime if the stars forgot to align  
It would be a crime if we dont find a way to love somebody  
It would be a crime  
Now Ive got a dream and it started this way  
I get myself early up in the morning and it shines on my face  
Anytime you can find a reason and a place itd be a crime  
A crime if the sun forgot to shine  
A crime if the stars forgot to align  
It would be a crime if we dont find a way to love somebody  
It would be a crime  
Some days make you want your feet on the ground  
Some days make you want to fly  
Some people make you want to keep your head down  
But you make me wanna try  
A crime if the sun forgot to shine  
A crime if the stars forgot to align  
It would be a crime if we dont find a way  
It would be a crime  
Oh it would be a crime  
Yeah itd be a crime itd be a crime be a crime
