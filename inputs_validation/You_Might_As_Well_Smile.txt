Youre still the best pererson  
I ever knew  
There were a thousand little things that I was always  
Just about to say to you  
But the now time it grows shorter  
For the speeches  
Just let me leave you with the line  
It might help you pass the time  
Sometiime  
  
You might as weell smile  
Aint no tears gonna drown the rain  
Keeps on fallin  
You might as weell smile  
Aint no pain gonna change what still remaiains  
You might as well regain babe  
Youre lost serenity serenity  
And shine it on me  
Shine it on meeeee  
  
I remember times when you heeld me  
Youd freeeeze my spine  
We were lookin in the mirror at the time  
I got confused and I thought your eyes were mine  
But now the time it grows shorter  
For the secrets  
Just let me leave you with some truth  
Might help you hold on  
To your jewels sometimes  
  
You might as weell smile  
Aint no tears gonna drown the rain  
Keeps on fallin  
You might as weell smile  
  
Aint no pain gonna change what still remaiains  
You might as well maintain babe  
Protect your sanity your sanitywhy  
And it shine it on me  
  
Shine it on meeeee  
Shine it on meeeeeee
