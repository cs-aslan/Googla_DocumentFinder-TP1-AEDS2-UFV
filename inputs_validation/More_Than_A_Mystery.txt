Mesmerized since the day I saw you  
Maybe somewhere Ive misplaced my pride  
In trying to prove Im on your side  
Were two of the many walking wounded  
And all I want is to try to be the cure  
So well never feel loneliness anymore  
  
Chorus  
I want to be declared your one and only  
Hear you say that Im your destiny  
And I want you to be more than a mystery to me  
  
Am I making you feel uneasy  
Do you recognize the movie that were in  
Every game you swore youd never play you win  
Do you want to know the truth about you  
Do you even hear the voices in your head  
Cant you see Im hanging there by a thread  
  
I want to feel your gentle arms around me  
Want to know the sweet taste of your kiss  
Want to hear you whisper  
Baby nothings better than this  
I want to be declared your one and only  
Hear you say that Im your destiny  
And I want you to be more than a mystery to me  
  
Chorus  
  
The more I reach out to you  
The harder you are to find  
How could I be so drawn to something so unkind  
  
Do I make you feel uneasy  
Am I saying any words you want to hear  
Love isnt really love without fear  
  
Chorus
