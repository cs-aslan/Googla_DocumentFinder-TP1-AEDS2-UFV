I still see your coat hangin on the door  
Never let anybody put one there before  
My pillows got your head printed on it  
Baby of all the guys you were my favorite  
  
Dont ask me why  
I just cant say goodbye  
No not tonight  
No I just cant say it  
  
Chorus  
Cause Im gonna hold on  
Yeah Im gonna hold on  
Baby gotta keep holdin on to what we had  
Cause I dont wanna move on  
So I gotta hold on  
Baby because you and me are sinking like quicksand  
Like quicksand like quicksand  
Baby because you and me are sinking like quicksand  
Like quicksand baby like quicksand  
Baby because you and me are sinking like quicksand  
  
You came along I didnt know of love  
But now I know that sometimes its just not enough  
I hear your footsteps in my corridor  
But it is just my heart its pounding like before  
  
Wish I could try  
But I just cant say goodbye  
No not tonight  
No I just cant say it  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause the ground is breaking  
I can feel it shaking  
Wish it was that easy  
But its not that easy  
Gotta hold my hands up  
Gotta keep my head up  
Gotta keep on breathing  
Baby even if were sinking  
Even if were sinking  
Baby even if were sinking  
Even if we are sinking  
  
Cause I justjust gottagotta hold Hold  
  
Chorus  
  
Only got one life to live  
We dont even need a piece of sand  
Only you and me  
We need to hold on and hold on and  
  
Only got one life to live  
We dont even need a piece of sand  
Only you and me  
We need to hold on and hold on and hold on  
And hold on  
And hold on and hold on  
  
And hold on and hold on and hold on  
And hold on and hold on and hold on  
And hold on and hold on and hold on
