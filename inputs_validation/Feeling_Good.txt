Birds flying high you know how I feel  
Sun in the sky you know how I feel  
Breeze driftin on by you know how I feel  
  
Its a new dawn  
Its a new day  
Its a new life for me yeah  
  
Its a new dawn its a new day its a new life for me  
Ouh  
And Im feeling good  
  
Fish in the sea you know how I feel  
River running free you know how I feel  
Blossom on the tree you know how I feel  
  
Its a new dawn  
Its a new day  
Its a new life  
For me  
And Im feeling good  
  
Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean dont you know  
Butterflies all havin fun you know what I mean  
Sleep in peace when day is done thats what I mean  
And this old world is a new world  
And a bold world for me  
  
Stars when you shine you know how I feel  
Scent of the pines you know how I feel  
Oh freedom is mine  
And I know how I feel  
  
Its a new dawn  
Its a new day  
Its a new life  
For me  
  
And Im feeling good
