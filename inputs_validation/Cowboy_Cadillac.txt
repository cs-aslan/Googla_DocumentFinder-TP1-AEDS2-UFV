Ive never known one better  
Shes a real go getter  
If you met her youd be good as gone  
Shes a real red liner  
Likes it all behind her  
Shes the kind that keeps you hangin on  
  
Shes a cowboys buddy  
Even when she gets muddy  
Lord shes lovely from her front to back  
So either comin or goin  
Know her best sides showin  
Shes my cowboy Cadillac  
  
Shes the perfect picture  
Of the perfect mixture  
Tween a woman and a fine machine  
Shes a hard work lover  
A real tough mother  
Shes the cover of a magazine  
And Im happy knowin  
That what keeps me goin  
Is whats gonna keep me comin back  
Shes my honkin tonkin  
Everything Im wantin  
Cowboy Cadillac  
  
She loves to haul them cattle  
All my ropes and saddle  
And it doesnt matter work or play  
If its a mountain she can crawl it  
If its hay then she can haul it  
Shes the last one to call it a day  
  
Shes the perfect picture  
Of the perfect mixture  
Tween a woman and a fine machine  
Shes a hard work lover  
A real tough mother  
Shes the cover of a magazine  
And Im happy knowin  
That what keeps me goin  
Is whats gonna keep me comin back  
Shes my honkin tonkin  
Everything Im wantin  
Cowboy Cadillac
