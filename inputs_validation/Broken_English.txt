Cold lonely puritan  
What are you fighting for  
Its not my security  
  
Its just an old war  
Not even a cold war  
Dont say it in Russian  
Dont say it in German  
Say it in broken English  
Say it in broken English  
  
Lose your father your husband  
Your mother your children  
What are you dying for  
Its not my reality  
  
Its just an old war  
Not even a cold war  
Dont say it in Russian  
Dont say it in German  
Say it in broken English  
Say it in broken English
