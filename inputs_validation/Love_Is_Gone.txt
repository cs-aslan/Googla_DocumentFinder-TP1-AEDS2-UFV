Now that the love is gone  
  
What are we supposed to do  
After all that weve been through  
When everything that felt so right is wrong  
Now that the love is gone  
  
Love is gone  
  
What are we supposed to do  
After all that weve been through  
When everything that felt so right is wrong  
Now that the love is gone  
There is nothing left to prove  
No use to deny this simple truth  
Cant find the reason to keep holding on  
Now that the love is gone love is gone  
  
Now that the love is gone what felt so rights so wrong  
Now that the love is gone  
  
I feel so hurt inside feel so hurt inside got to find the reason  
  
What are we supposed to do  
After all that weve been through  
When everything that felt so right is wrong  
Now that the love is gone  
There is nothing left to prove  
No use to deny this simple truth  
Cant find the reason to keep holding on  
Now that the love is gone love is gone  
  
Got to find a reason got to find a reason  
Got to find a reason to hold  
  
Love theres nothing left for us to say yeah  
Love why cant we turn and walk away  
  
What are we supposed to do  
After all that weve been through  
When everything that felt so right is wrong  
Now that the love is gone  
There is nothing left to prove  
No use to deny this simple truth  
Cant find the reason to keep holding on  
Now that the love is gone love is gone  
  
Love is gone
