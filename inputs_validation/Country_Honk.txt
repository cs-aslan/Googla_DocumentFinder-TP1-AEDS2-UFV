Im sittin in a bar tipplin a jar in Jackson  
And on the street the summer sun it shines  
Theres many a bar room queen Ive had in Jackson  
But I just cant seem to drink you off my mind  
  
Its the honky tonk women  
Gimme gimme gimme the honky tonk blues  
  
I laid a divorcee in New York City  
I had to put up some kind of a fight  
The lady she all dressed me up in roses  
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind  
  
Its the honky tonk women  
Gimme gimme gimme the honky tonk blues  
  
Its the honky tonk women  
Gimme gimme gimme the honky tonk blues  
  
Its the honky tonk women  
Gimme gimme gimme the honky tonk blues
