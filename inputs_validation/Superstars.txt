Youve read about me in the papers  
Youve seen me on the movie screen  
You know everything about me  
Im your late night fantasy  
  
But dont think I cant hear you calling  
From the shadow of the 14th row  
Cause Ive had the same dreams youve had  
A few short years ago and thats why I know  
  
You and I  
We will climb so high  
Superstars  
Whoa whoa you and I  
  
And well just close our eyes  
And well become our fantasy  
  
Superstars yes yes superstars  
Step right this way Everyones welcome  
We want your dreams  
The offers simple momentary immortality  
  
Cause Ive seen them all you know  
Ive seen them climb and Ive seen them fall  
Ive seen them come and Ive seen them go  
And through it all theres only one thing that matters  
  
Love  
And thats simply  
You and I  
Yes You and I  
For we are superstars
