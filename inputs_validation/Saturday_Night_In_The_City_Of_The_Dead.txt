While a fat guy zips by bony in a Zodiac  
Picking out trouble maybe looking for a heart attack  
Allnight boys in the Piccadilly arcade  
 trawling for some rough trade  
Saturday night  
Saturday night  
Saturday night in the city of the dead  
Cant you feel the time bomb ticking in your head  
Too many memories are burning in your bed  
Saturday night in the city of the dead  
Dead in the dole queue face like a statue  
Laugh like a maniac walk like a king too  
Spiked hair dont care hot spam outlaw  
Rad man  rips it out youre buzzing like a chainsaw  
Chorus  
Highrise reptile sucking on a cigarette  
Ripped suit zip boots dancing like an insect  
Tottenham Court Rolexes the excuses  in the wind hide  
The citys pretty dead but Im still alive  
Chorus  
Saturday night  
Saturday night  
Saturday night  
Saturday night in the city of the dead  
Saturday night  
Repeat and fade
