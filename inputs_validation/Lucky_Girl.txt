Im a lucky girl  
I found my friend  
Ive been all around the world  
Mission Impossible  
Chasing the rainbows end  
Wise guys  
Shy guys  
And sly lover boys  
With big bad bedroom eyes  
I never loved a man I trusted  
As far as I could pitch my shoe  
Til I loved you  
  
Youre my lucky star  
Youre my magician  
You make the night prowling disappear  
Vanished from the starwarbars  
Empty repetition  
I get my heart full here  
Playboys  
Stray boys  
And Say hey hey boysll treat you like a toy  
I never loved a man I trusted  
As far as I could pitch my shoe  
Til I loved you  
  
Cheaters  
Woman beaters  
And Huck Finn shucksters hopping parking meters  
I never loved a man  
I trusted  
As far as I could pitch my shoe  
til I loved you  
  
Im a lucky girl  
I found my friend  
I been all around the world  
Mission Impossible  
Chasing the rainbows end  
Wise guys  
Boobyprize guys  
And sly lover boys  
With big bad bedroom eyes  
I never loved a man I trusted  
As far as I could throw my shoe  
Til I loved you
