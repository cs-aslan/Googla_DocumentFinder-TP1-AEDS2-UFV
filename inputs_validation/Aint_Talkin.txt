As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden  
The wounded flowers were dangling from the vine  
I was passing by yon cool crystal fountain  
Someone hit me from behind  
  
Aint talkin just walkin  
Through this weary world of woe  
Heart burnin still yearnin  
No one on earth would ever know  
  
They say prayer has the power to heal  
So pray from the mother  
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell  
I am atryin to love my neighbor and do good unto others  
But oh mother things aint going well  
  
Aint talkin just walkin  
Ill burn that bridge before you can cross  
Heart burnin still yearnin  
Therell be no mercy for you once youve lost  
  
Now Im all worn down by weeping  
My eyes are filled with tears my lips are dry  
If I catch my opponents ever sleeping  
Ill just slaughter em where they lie  
  
Aint talkin just walkin  
Through the world mysterious and vague  
Heart burnin still yearnin  
Walkin through the cities of the plague  
  
Well the whole world is filled with speculation  
The whole wide world which people say is round  
They will tear your mind away from contemplation  
They will jump on your misfortune when youre down  
  
Aint talkin just walkin  
Eatin hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town  
Heart burnin still yearnin  
Some day youll be glad to have me around  
  
They will crush you with wealth and power  
Every waking moment you could crack  
Ill make the most of one last extra hour  
Ill revenge my fathers death then Ill step back  
  
Aint talkin just walkin  
Hand me down my walkin cane  
Heart burnin still yearnin  
Got to get you out of my miserable brain  
  
All my loyal and my muchloved companions  
They approve of me and share my code  
I practice a faith thats been long abandoned  
Aint no altars on this long and lonesome road  
  
Aint talkin just walkin  
My mule is sick my horse is blind  
Heart burnin still yearnin  
Thinkin bout that gal I left behind  
  
Well its bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin  
Fame and honor never seem to fade  
The fire gone out but the light is never dyin  
Who says I cant get heavenly aid  
  
Aint talkin just walkin  
Carryin a dead mans shield  
Heart burnin still yearnin  
Walkin with a toothache in my heel  
  
The sufferin is unending  
Every nook and cranny has its tears  
Im not playing Im not pretending  
Im not nursin any superfluous fears  
  
Aint talkin just walkin  
Walkin ever since the other night  
Heart burnin still yearnin  
Walkin til Im clean out of sight  
  
As I walked out in the mystic garden  
On a hot summer day a hot summer lawn  
Excuse me maam I beg your pardon  
Theres no one here the gardener is gone  
  
Aint talkin just walkin  
Up the road around the bend  
Heart burnin still yearnin  
In the last outback at the worlds end
