I cant win I cant reign  
I will never win this game without you without you  
I am lost I am vain  
I will never be the same without you without you  
I wont run I wont fly  
I will never make it by without you without you  
I cant rest I cant fight  
All I need is you and I without you without you  
Oh oh oh you you you without you  
You you without you  
Cant erase so Ill take blame  
But I cant accept that were estranged without you  
  
I cant quit now this cant be right  
I cant take one more sleepless night without you without you  
I wont soar I wont climb  
If youre not here Im paralyzed  
Without you without you  
I cant look Im so blind  
Lost my heart lost my mind without you without you  
Oh oh oh you you you  
Without you you you  
Without you  
I am lost I am vain  
I will never be the same without you without you  
Without you
