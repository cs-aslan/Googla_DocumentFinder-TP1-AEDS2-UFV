How can you say you love me  
When you dont even love yourself  
You live your life like a jagged knife  
Just waiting on the shelf  
  
How can you live for tomorrow  
When you curse the night and day  
The minutes pass through the hour glass  
As you let them slip away  
  
Chorus  
Do you love me  
White sister  
Do you love me when I play your game  
Do you love me  
White sister  
Do you love me  
When I call your name  
  
How can you touch the sorrow  
With a leather gloved hand  
When you summon the winds of anger  
Just as fast as you can  
  
You crucify an orphan  
With the rainbow in your eyes  
Then you send out invitations  
And address them with his cries  
  
I dont even know whats right  
I can say  
That you put up some kind of fight  
Ive been branded  
Ive been stranded  
Im so thankful for what Ive been handed  
I wish I could say that youre mine  
Such a card game  
  
Chorus
