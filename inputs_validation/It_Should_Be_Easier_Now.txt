Now that Ive made up my mind youre gone it should be easier now  
Perhaps now my heart will stop hanging on it should be easier now  
The lesson Ive learned from you gold cant buy a heart can be broken and
still survive  
Thanks to you now a much wiser man am I and it should be easier now  
  
The worst now is over Ive stood the test it should be easier now  
They say everything happens for the best it should be easier now  
The wounds in my heart youve carved deep and wide  
Hollowed and washed by the tears Ive cried  
But now therell be more room for love inside and it should be easier now
