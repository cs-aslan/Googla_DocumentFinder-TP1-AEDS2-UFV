Hey God why are you doing this to me  
Am I not living up to what Im supposed to be  
Why am I seething with this animosity  
Hey God I think you owe me a great big apology  
  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
  
Hey God I really dont know what you mean  
Seems like salvation comes only in our dreams  
I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme  
Hey God can this world really be as sad as it seems  
  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
  
Dont take it away from me  
I need someone to hold on to  
Dont take it away from me  
I need you to hold on to  
Dont take it away from me  
I need someone to hold on to  
  
Dont take it  
Dont take it  
Dont take it  
  
Hey God  
Hey God  
Hey God  
Hey God  
  
Hey God theres nothing left for me to hide  
I lost my ignorance my security and pride  
Im all alone in this fucking world you must despise  
Hey God I believed your promisesYour promises were lies  
  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
  
You made me throw it all away  
My morals left to decay  
How many you betray  
Youve taken everything  
  
My head is filled with disease  
My skin is begging you please  
Im on my hands and knees  
I want so much to believe  
  
Hey God  
Hey God  
Hey God
