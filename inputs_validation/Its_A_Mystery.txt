Its a Mystery  
How the heart beats  
How the sun shines  
How our eyes meet  
  
Its a Mystery  
Lts a wonder  
How we keep from  
Sinking under  
  
Its A Mystery  
  
All the nonsense  
Set before us  
Supposed to shock us  
But it bores us  
  
All the ennui  
All the replays  
All the rewrites  
All the cant says  
  
Its A Mystery  
  
Electron guns fire images  
They end in interstellar space  
Within the year  
  
And through it all  
We dance and starve and  
Burn and clear  
  
Its A Mystery  
How they con us  
How they sneak til  
Theyre upon us  
  
All the anchors  
With their helmets  
Getting ratings  
With their zealots  
  
All the pundits  
All the salesmen  
Setting snake oil  
To the nation  
  
All the specials  
Every rerun  
All the penguins  
Getting welldone  
  
Its A Mystery  
  
Its A Mystery  
How the heart beats  
How the sun shines  
How our eyes meet  
  
Its A Mystery  
Its a wonder  
How we ever  
Find each other  
  
Its A Mystery
