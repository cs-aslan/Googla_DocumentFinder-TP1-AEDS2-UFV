Good mornin dearly beloved  
We are gathered here today  
To watch two people we know  
Make a big mistake  
Theyll stand up at the altar  
And solemnly swear I do  
Theyll be together forever  
Til they find somebody new  
  
Her daddys in the front row  
Mutterin Oh no here we go again  
They had a couple dates  
Now shes three months late  
And its twenty bucks a plate I spent oh  
  
Good mornin dearly beloved  
Id like to welcome yall  
To see the side effects  
Of sex and alcohol  
Please bow your heads and join me  
In a prayer for these two  
Wholl be together forever  
Til they find somebody new  
  
The bride is a flirt and the groom is worse  
As hes putting the ring on her  
Hes checkin out the bridesmaids  
Thinkin that he might take  
The maid of honors honor oh  
  
Welcome dearly beloved  
We are here this afternoon  
To throw rice as these two  
Drive down the road to ruin  
With cans tied to the bumper  
And a draggin muffler too  
Theyll be together forever  
Til they find somebody new  
  
So raise your glass and join me  
Heres to the bride and groom  
Theyll be together forever  
Til they find somebody new
