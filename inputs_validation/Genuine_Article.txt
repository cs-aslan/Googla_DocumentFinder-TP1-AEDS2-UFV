Do what you have to  
I do what I had to  
To break through a pick a style that sticks like glue  
And as I rank I want to thank no one  
  
Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done  
You helped me around  
My parents put me down  
I never skipped town  
  
I stood my ground  
We kept showin up  
Drinkin and throwin up  
Rap was my life  
  
As I was growin up  
Actin a fool in school no one topped us  
Smart ass in class at times abnoxious  
Drivin a bronco  
  
Runnin my own show  
And pullin the look a like Marilyn Monroe hoes  
And me and Bo got together  
Made sense  
  
Spent many nights in Mt Clemens basements  
I scratched records and performed a few tricks  
KDC mix let the Black man talk shit  
Pumpin the new sounds town to town  
  
Who holds it down like Bad Leroy Brown  
Now I wont stop cause yo Im Kid Rock

Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done  
  
FFFames a costin the price aint nice  
Its like the roll of the dice  
For a whole new life  
But dont get my song wrong  
  
I enjoy it a lot  
Walkin around like a big shot  
Cause Im Kid Rock  
Smooth as an ice cube  
  
Cool as an igloo  
And more complex than a rubix cube  
A healthy wealthy young one with a quick tongue  
Smart from the start and from the heart my rhymes run  
  
And as I incline through time to get mine  
I try not to slide but walk a straight line  
Though its hard when the climb gets steep  
The one who finds is the one who seeks  
  
So I sought and fought  
And a lot I got taught  
And although I left those who stole got caught  
Many shows I rocked  
  
Many suckers I laughed at  
And those who snapped back usually got slapped  
The cat if I was strap  
Cause I was a son of a gun  
  
Livin life on the run  
Now I pleaded 18 and outdone by none  
Bold Young Handsome Bad like Bronson  
Pumpin the new sounds town to town  
  
And when in motown I cool out in Greektown  
On the upside with nuthin too high

Six Generations of rap and Im first  
Ready to burst the style is rehearsed  
I worked and worked and worked and I worked  
When many thought I was just gettin jerked  
  
Used abused but I paid my dues  
And now no one out there could fill my shoes  
And my pants and do this dance  
This shit didnt happen by chance  
  
It went slow not quick but now Im your pick  
Aint that a trip when I started from zip  
And now up and up and up I wont stop  
The flop just pop the flat top the Kid Rock  
  
Yes me the low key MC  
With the ability to rock a party  
Anywhere and make people stare  
Im lookin while Im cookin with no care  
  
Pumpin the new sound town to town  
Who holds it down like bad Leroy Brown  
And still I wont stop growin this flat top
