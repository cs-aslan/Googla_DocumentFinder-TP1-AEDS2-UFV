Me And My Old Lady  
Lay in bed all day  
And when I say I love her  
Well she rolls the other way  
But really she dont mean it  
Everything she says  
Still if I believe in love  
Theres nothing wrong  
Theres nothing wrong with my head  
Me and my old lady  
Sit and sip on wine  
And when she says she loves me  
Will I say that love is blind  
But really I dont mean it  
Everything I say  
Still if she believes in love  
Theres nothing wrong  
Theres nothing wrong with her head  
So what if were making a scene now  
You know she dont give a shit  
When shes pawin and grabbin on me now  
You know I dont mind a bit  
Its all good and we  
Aint gonna change now  
The world is unaware  
So if you want go on and stare  
Cause we dont care  
She aint no ball and chain  
Me and my old lady  
Suck each other dry  
And when in that position  
Im the luckiest man alive  
Quenching our libidos  
Passing time away  
Now that we believe in love  
Theres nothing wrong  
Theres nothing wrong with our head
