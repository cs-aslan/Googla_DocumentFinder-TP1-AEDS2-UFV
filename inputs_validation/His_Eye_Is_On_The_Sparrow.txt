Why do I feel discouraged  
Why do the shadows come  
And why does my heart feel lonely  
And long for heaven and home  
When Jesus is my portion  
A constant friend is He  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
So I sing because Im happy  
And I sing because Im free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
So I sing because Im happy  
And I sing because Im free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches  
And I know He watches  
And I know He watches me
