Chorus  
Longer boats are coming to win us  
Theyre coming to win us theyre coming to win us  
Longer boats are coming to win us  
Hold on to the shore theyll be taking the key from the door  
  
I dont want no god on my lawn  
Just a flower I can help along  
Cause the soul of no body knows  
How a flower grows  
Oh how a flower grows  
  
Chorus  
  
Mary dropped her pants by the sand  
And let a parson come and take her hand  
But the soul of no body knows  
Where the parson goes where does the parson go  
  
Chorus  
  
Addition verse performed in live version of this song  
  
Raise your mind up and look around  
You can see them yes theyre looking down  
From a lonely asteroid in a vacant void  
Dyin but not destroyed
