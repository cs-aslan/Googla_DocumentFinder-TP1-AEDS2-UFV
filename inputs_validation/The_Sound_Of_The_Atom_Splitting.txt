I hate you I hate you  
Nothing will ever be the same  
Oh really Dont be silly  
I told you it was all a game  
Whenever I see you or your work  
It makes me feel like spitting  
Whats that noise  
Oh that weve been expecting it for ages  
Its the sound of the atom splitting  
  
Hes a villain him over there with the stocking on his head  
Look theres another they call themselves pinheads  
Whats that noise over there  
Is it corrugated iron theyre hitting  
No no its perfectly normal  
Its just the sound of the atom splitting  
  
Whose side are you on anyway  
Is that some kind of threat  
Well I suppose itll have to do  
As long as you dont make too much mess  
And would the last person to leave  
Once youve all finished kissing  
Turn the video on to record  
You never know what youre missing  
Bread and circuses and maybe later  
The sound of the atom splitting  
  
Quiet at the back please No hissing  
Its the sound the sound  
The sound of the atom splitting  
  
I hate you I hate you  
Quiet at the back please No hissing  
Its the sound the sound  
The sound of the atom splitting
