So few years ago her daddy held her in his arms  
Snugged the blanket around her feet to help and keep em warm  
When he kissed her tender cheek oh how her eyes would shine  
His evry dream was built around his daughter Caroline  
He remembered evry time shed turn another year  
And at the birthday parties when hed shed a happy tear  
Thinking of the wedding dress that she would wear someday  
When hed have to give his daughter Caroline away  
He thought of what he saw the night they called her from the roll  
A silver graduation ring and engagement ring of gold  
It seems as tho twas yesterday he met her valentine  
And now shes grown and here to wed his daughter Caroline  
Maarching on his arm she whispered Pa I still love you  
Those words remained within his ears when she vowed I do  
Cheer was sparkling from his eyes but tears were in behind  
When he gave his heart away his daughter Caroline
