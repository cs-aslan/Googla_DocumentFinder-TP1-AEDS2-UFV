How many times do I have to say  
To get awayget gone  
Flip your shit past another lasses  
Humble dwelling  
You got your game made your shot  
And you got away with a lot  
But Im not turned on  
So put away that meat your selling  
Cause I do know whats good for me  
  
And Ive done what I could for you  
But youre not benefiting and yet Im sitting  
Singing again sing sing again  
How can I deal with this  
If he wont get with this  
Am I gonna heal from this  
He wont admit to it  
Nothing to figure out  
I gotta get him out  
Its about time the truth was out  
That he dont give a shit about me  
  
How many times can it escalate  
Til it elevates to place I cant breathe  
And I must decide if you must deride  
That Im much obliged to up and go  
Ill idealize   
Then realize that its no sacrifice  
Because the price is paid  
And theres nothing left to grieve  
Fuckin go  
  
Cause Ive done what I could for you  
But youre not benefiting and yet Im sitting  
Singing again sing sing again  
How can I deal with this  
If he wont get with this  
Am I gonna heal from this  
He wont admit to it  
Nothing to figure out  
I gotta get him out  
Its about time the truth was out  
That he dont give a shit about me
