From the moment that we met  
My world was turned around  
Upside down  
To some degree I still regret  
  
My memory  
For keeping you around  
Girl I thought that you were mine  
But my broken hearts been  
  
Shattered  
One too many times  
  
And I dont wanna see you anymore  
Im just not that strong  
I love it when youre here  
But Im better when youre gone  
  
Im certain that Ive given  
And oh how you can take  
Theres no use in you lookin  
Theres nothin left for you to break  
  
Baby please release me  
Let my heart rest in pieces in pieces  
  
Someone let you down again  
So you turn to me  
Your convenient friend  
Oh but I know what youre doin  
  
And what you hope to find  
Ive seen it a thousand times  
All the fire we had before  
Are now just bitter ashes  
Left scattered on the floor  
  
And I dont wanna see you anymore  
Im just not that strong  
I love it when youre here  
But Im better when youre gone  
  
Im certain that Ive given  
And oh how you can take  
Theres no use in you lookin  
Theres nothin left for you to break  
  
Baby please release me  
Let my heart rest in pieces yeah  
  
I dont wanna see you anymore  
Im just not that strong  
I love it when youre here baby  
But Im better when youre gone  
  
Im certain that Ive given  
And oh how you can take  
Theres no use in you lookin  
Theres nothin left for you to break  
  
Baby please release me  
We both know that you dont need me You dont need me  
Let my heart rest in pieces in pieces  
Let it rest
