Ive been trying for hours just to think of what exactly to say  
I thought Id leave you with a letter or firey speech  
Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play  
And Ive been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense  
Id like to know how you faded and you threw it away  
Id like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant  
  
Well I could tell you goodbye or maybe see you around  
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks  
We started out with a bang and at the top of the world  
Now the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks  
And everythings blank  
  
Chorus x2  
If I could find the words then I would write it all down  
If I could only find a voice I would speak  
Oh its there in my eyes so cant you see me tonight  
cmon and look at me and read em and weep  
  
Ive been whispering softly trying to build a cry up to a scream  
We let the past slip away and put the future on hold  
Now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream  
  
And Ive been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense  
Id like to know why you faded and you threw it away  
Id like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant  
  
Well I could tell you goodbye or maybe see you around  
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks  
But now the rooms are all empty the candles are dark  
The guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks and everythings blank  
  
Chorus  
  
Its there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart  
Its running silent and angry and deep  
Its there in my eyes and its all I can say cmon and read em and weep  
  
Read em and weep for all the hours well be spending alone  
Read em and weep for the dreams well ignore  
Running silent and deep  
And all those promises we promised to keep they wont be kept anymore  
  
Read em and weep for the magic that our bodies had made  
Read em and weep for the blood that we lost  
Running silent and deep and all the secrets that we somehow betrayed  
For whatever the cost  
  
Read em and weep for the memories still alive in the bed  
Read em and weep for the lies we believed  
Running silent and deep and all the things that can never be said  
  
Why dont you look at me and read em and weep  
cmon and look at me and read em and weep  
Its there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart  
Its running silent and angry and deep  
Its here in my eyes and its all I can say  
cmon look at me and read em and weep
