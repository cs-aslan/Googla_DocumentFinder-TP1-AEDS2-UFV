The dream is lost  
Dont let it slip away  
Or bloody days wont be far away  
Cause when theres no more sin  
Theres no where you can run  
  
Does anybody know how many lives weve lost  
Can anybody ever pay the cost  
What will it take for us to join in peace my friends  
Does anybody out there even care  
  
Wake up world before its too late  
Its time for love to conquer hate  
And when that battles won  
We all can live as one  
  
Does anybody know how many lives weve lost  
Can anybody ever pay the cost  
What will it take for us to join in peace my friends  
Does anybody out there even care  
  
Riots in the streets men dressed in white sheets  
Is that what we want  
A little boy hanging from a tree and a burning cross  
If we can learn that were one we can overcome  
Before this takes us all  
Wed better catch ourselves before we fall  
  
Does anybody know how many lives weve lost  
Can anybody ever pay the cost  
What will it take for us to join in peace my friends  
Does anybody out there even care
