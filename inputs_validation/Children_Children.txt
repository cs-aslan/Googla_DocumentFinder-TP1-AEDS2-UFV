I know a tiny waterfall  
A magic little place  
Where we can play together  
And watch the fishes race  
Children children where are you  
Hiding in the forest playing in the rain  
I hope you not too far away  
For me to see again  
  
I know where theres a fairy  
Who will invite us all to tea  
But she wont let me in alone  
Youll have to come with me  
  
Children children where are you  
Hiding in the forest playing in the rain  
I hope you not too far away  
For me to see again  
  
I know a tiny waterfall  
A magic little place  
Where we can play together  
And watch the fishes race  
  
Children children where are you  
Hiding in the forest playing in the rain  
I hope you not too far away  
For me to see again
