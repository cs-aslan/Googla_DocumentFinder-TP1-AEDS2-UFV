In the eye of the storm you found me  
I was caught in the rain like you  
And it pulled us down together  
And it tangled us in blue  
Oh all of my life  
I wanted that night  
Together and still it remains  
I still hear the rain  
I cant get it out of my heart  
  
And I will wait for you forever  
No matter what you do or say  
Ill wait for you forever  
Cause Im still caught in the rain  
  
They say the eye of the storm is quiet  
And thats where Ill wait for you  
They say dreams can show us answers  
Oh baby I hope thats true  
Cause night after night  
I dream of a light  
That shows me back through the rain  
I find you again  
I cant get it out of my heart  
  
And I will wait for you forever  
No matter what you do or say  
Ill wait for you forever  
Cause Im still caught in the rain  
  
Oh all of my life  
I wanted that night  
Together and still it remains  
I still hear the rain  
I cant get it out of my heart  
  
And I will wait for you forever  
No matter what you do or say  
Ill wait for you forever  
Cause Im still caught in the rain
