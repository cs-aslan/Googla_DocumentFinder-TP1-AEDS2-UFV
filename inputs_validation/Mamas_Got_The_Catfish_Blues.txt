I aint had a bite cause the moons too bright  
I wish I had a big one or two  
My crock lines set and my hooks are all wet  
And mamas got the catfish blues  
Dont like to see her unhappy  
She treats me like a water tree  
I hate to see mama with the catfish blues  
And the catfish are layin in the river asleep  
Theres a bottle of wine layin easy on my mind  
I dug enough bait to catch a few  
My reelings wet but I cannot forget  
Mamas got the catfish blues  
Theres a turtle on the stump and the toadfrog jump  
And I guess I could gig me a few  
In settlin fog I caught a big water dog  
Mamas got the catfish blues  
I dont like to see her unhappy  
She treats me like a water tree  
I hate to see mama with the catfish blues  
And the catfish are layin in the river asleep  
Theres a bottle of wine layin easy on my mind  
I dug enough bait to catch a few  
My reelings wet but I cannot forget  
Mamas got the catfish blues yeah
