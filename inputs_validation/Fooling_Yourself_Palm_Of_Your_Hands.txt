You see the world through your cynical eyes  
Youre a troubled young man i can tell  
Youve got it all in the palm of your hand  
But your hands wet with sweat and your head needs a rest  
  
And youre fooling yourself if you dont believe it  
Youre kidding yourself if you dont believe it  
How can you be such an angry young man  
When your future looks quite bright to me  
How can there be such a sinister plan  
That could hide such a lamb such a caring young man  
  
Youre fooling yourself if you dont believe it  
Youre kidding yourself if you dont believe it  
Get up get back on your feet  
Youre the one they cant beat and you know it  
Come on lets see what youve got  
Just take your best shot and dont blow it  
  
Youre fooling yourself if you dont believe it  
Youre killing yourself if you dont believe it  
Get up get back on your feet  
Youre the one they cant beat and you know it  
Come on lets see what youve got  
Just take your best shot and dont blow it
