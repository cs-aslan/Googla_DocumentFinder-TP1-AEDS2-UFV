This is a tale of a Northern Soul  
Looking to find his way back home  
Hes coming from that same old road  
You know the one your folds dont know  
  
I want to see if you know me  
I was born in a rented room  
My mother didnt get no flowers  
Dad didnt approve of me do you  
  
Im alive with something inside of me  
And I dont think Im coming back  
So come on come in inside of me  
Lets spread it all around  
  
Give me your powder and pills  
I want to see if they cure my ills  
Ive no time for love and devotion  
  
No time for old fashioned potion  
Take a look into my eyes  
I tell you so many lies and then Ill let you go into the night  
And I dont think Im coming down  
Im alive with something inside of me  
And I cant seem to get it out  
  
Im gonna die alone in bed  
This is a tale of a northern soul  
Looking for his way back home  
And my friend said Come in side of me  
And your speakers are telling the truth  
Coming through and into your room on a river of sound  
  
This is a tale of a northern soul looking for his way back home  
And if he sees it I know Ill know repeat  
And theres fighting on the street below  
I know theres fighting on the street below  
But I dont care Cause Im a Northern Soul  
And Im looking for a way back home  
  
Too busy staying alive repeat  
Too busy living a lie too busy living my life  
Too busy staying alive
