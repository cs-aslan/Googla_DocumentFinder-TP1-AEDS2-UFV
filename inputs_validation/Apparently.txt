Intro  
Oh right oh  
Oh why  
Nadadada  
  
Hook  
I keep my head high  
I got my wings to carry me  
I dont know freedom  
I want my dreams to rescue me  
I keep my faith strong  
I ask the Lord to follow me  
Ive been unfaithful  
I dont know why you call on me  
  
Verse 1  
This is my canvas  
Imma paint it how I want it baby oh I  
This is my canvas  
Ima paint it paint it paint it how I want it nigga  
Fuck you cause there  
There is no right or wrong only a song  
I like to write alone be in my zone  
Think back to Forest Hills no perfect home  
But the only thing like home Ive ever known  
Until they snatched it from my mama  
And foreclosed her on the loan  
Im so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone  
I was up in New York City chasin panties gettin dome  
Had no clue what you was goin through  
How could you be so strong  
And how could I be so selfish I know I can be so selfish  
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl  
Damn she so selfless but she put up with my way  
Because she loves me like you do  
And though it dont always show I love her just like I love you  
And I need to treat you better  
Wish you could live forever so we could spend more time together  
I love you mama

Apparently you believe in me you believe in me  
Apparently you believe in me and I thank you for it  
  
Verse 2  
Another day another rhyme ho  
Another day another time zone  
Today I woke up feelin horny so its only right  
I got two bitches playin on my trombone  
Keep up never sure where the words would take me  
Niggas eat em up and regurgitate me  
Shit jumped tight never slurred it lazy  
Give a virgin the urge to rape me  
Nigga please  
Best friends really make great for enemies  
My watch came niggas cant wait for one of these  
I see you nigga this aint no Rolex its a AP nigga  
Im hot dog catch up to me nigga  
Uh couldnt resist  
Aim for the stars and I shouldnt have missed  
But I was ridin on fumes so I stopped by the moon  
Now Im sittin on the hood of this bitch  
Like thanks for the view  
Waitin on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldnt exist  
You know that shit gave you the blueprint dont forget  
Cole is your phone on zero percent  
Going off now niggas showin off  
Niggas swear they hard but they flowin soft  
Im taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing  
Gettin head like a coin toss  
Too easy
