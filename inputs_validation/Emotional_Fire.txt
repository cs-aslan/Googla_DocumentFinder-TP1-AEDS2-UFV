I cant wait til I see you baby  
I cant wait til the night comes fallin down  
I gotta see you again  
And ever if it couldnt be forever  
Id trade a lifetime for this night together  
Hold on hold on  
  
My heart is burning with the heat of this  
Emotional fire  
Every time I see you  
Im on fire every time we touch  
Cant you feel me burnin with desire  
Baby feel warm give me some  
Emotional fire  
Emotional fire  
  
Theres a feelin when Im here beside you  
Couldnt leave you and I wouldnt try to  
Baby Id only need you again  
There aint nothin that can break this fever  
The love gets stronger and the passion deeper  
Hold on hold on  
  
I cant let go cause theres no stoppin this  
Emotional fire  
Every time I see you  
Im on fire every time we touch  
Cant you feel me burnin with desire  
Baby feel warm give me some  
Emotional fire  
Emotional fire  
  
I cant wait until I see you baby  
I cant wait til the night comes fallin  
Hold on hold on  
  
My heart is burning with the heat of this  
Emotional fire  
Every time I see you  
Im on fire every time we touch  
Cant you feel me burnin with desire  
Baby feel warm give me some  
Emotional fire  
Emotional fire  
Emotional fire
