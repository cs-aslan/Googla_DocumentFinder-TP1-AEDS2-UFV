Everything is different now  
Look at me and you can see Ive change somehow  
You might think its strange the way I hold it down  
But I know I know you want it  
And you know I know you know  
I got what you need  
My life is different now  
  
Look and you and I can see youre wonderin how  
Though you think its strange the way I hold it down  
Know I know I know you want it  
And I know I know you know  
I got what you need  
Saw you drivin by just the other day  
  
I was riding in my car and my hands were raised  
By the way that I was rockin you thought I was bumpin Biggie or Jay  
But I was steady spinnin Fred cause I could praise for days  
You hollered at me  
I was at the light  
Said I was looking fly and asked what up tonight  
I said I know you used to see me at the clubs til three  
  
But I dont kick it like I did cause theres a change in me  
Everything is different now  
Look at me and you can see Ive change somehow  
You might think its strange the way I hold it down  
But I know I know you want it  
And you know I know you know  
I got what you need  
My life is different now  
  
Look and you and I can see youre wonderin how  
Though you think its strange the way I hold it down  
Know I know I know you want it  
And I know I know you know  
I got what you need  
Some of my girls I hadnt seen in a while  
Saw them at the mall and we traded hugs and a smile  
  
They said we hear youre doing well  
You seem so confident  
I told them that it wasnt me but it was heaven sent  
I saw confusion in their eyes  
Said Im living right no compromise  
I dont talk I dont dress like I did before  
  
And if you give me just a minute I will tell you more  
I am not the same God has changed the game  
Found that its okay I dont have to live that way  
I am not the same God has changed the game  
You know its okay you dont have to live that way
