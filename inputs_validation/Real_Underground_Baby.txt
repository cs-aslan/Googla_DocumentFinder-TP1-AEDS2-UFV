Real underground baby  
  
By Insane Clown Posse  
  
This clown dont smile and honk your nose  
This clown dont wear green goofy clothes  
And this clown dont mind your hatred for me  
Hell get turned into a dead corpse right before me  
  
And the preacher man said Hellalujah  
And the preacher man said Hellalujah  
And the preacher man said Hellalujah me and the  
Witch gonna go right to ya   
And the preacher man said Hellalujah  
And the preacher man said Hellalujah  
And the preacher man said Hellalujah me and the  
Witch gonna go right to ya  
  
My motto eat a dick up and swallow  
Only motto I follow be da Jim Beam Bottle  
And Ima kick a fuckin hole in the wall  
Ima kick a fuckin hole in the wall  
Full throttle punchin in an Eldorado  
Full bottle I care about no tomorrow and  
Ima kick a fuckin hole in the wall  
Ima kick a fuckin hole in the wall  
  
Who can paint their face up  
who can paint their face up  
And wear a Ninja suit  
and wear a Ninja suit  
Floatin through some backyards  
Dropkick your niece head backwards  
Im outtie wit a poof And aint  
That shit the truth  
  
My days are long and lonely  
Black rain is right before me  
Real underground baby  
My brain does nothin for me  
Heyey This pain will be my story  
This pain will be my story  
  
Who took the chicken from the plate and  
Put it in the fridge Shaggy 2 Dope did  
Who took the chicken from the plate and  
Put it in the fridge Shaggy 2 Dope did  
Who took the chicken from the plate and  
Put it in the fridge Shaggy 2 Dope did  
Who took the chicken from the plate and  
Put it in the fridge Shaggy 2 Dope did
