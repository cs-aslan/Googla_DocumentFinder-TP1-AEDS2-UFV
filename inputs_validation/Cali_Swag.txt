Chris Brown  
Yeah my swaggers like Uh in the domino at that  
Swathy sending text and she fellin me lemme forward that  
To my other girl now she say she wanna meet her  
A nigga going in like a quarter in a meter  
So come on  
  
I dont give a damn if she rollin then Im rollin  
I aint talking bout appeal but she pop it like she own it  
Her continuous moaning it carries to the morning  
And teach her like a stick so Im calling it Tboning  
  
My girl got a girlfriend so you know what it is  
I call them daycare cause they take care of my kids  
Ah bring the camera out of motion picture  
Before you take your clothes off let me get the liquor  
  
Nigga Im ill oh believe that  
Her titties like snowballs call them sky racks  
They be like Hulk Hogan aint no one in team  
I tell them fuck you nigga its me  
  
What it is how you doin nice to meet you  
My flow is just like bullets  
So this beat will be my nina  
That traver go bow it split you from your feet up  
  
I got your girl wet flooding like Katrina  
Rather Billy or Bima Fatima of Christina  
Milly Yang Imma done Im getting right between her  
Im strip club ballin throwing franklins like Aretha  
  
She said her mouth dry so Im guessing its the refull  
Whole team gorillaz K Mack and Joe  
Cali swag nigga I aint talking doggie do  
Its reject nigga have you breaking all the rules  
  
Your my catdaddy check on tmz its breaking news  
My car lot jackpot got these girls cheering like a mascot  
Boy you ask that cause Im hot  
Im mad all you singles neck like an ascot

When they hear the fame drop they gon shit a brick  
No pun intended but I recommand it  
Fuck your feelings nigga I dont care if you offended
