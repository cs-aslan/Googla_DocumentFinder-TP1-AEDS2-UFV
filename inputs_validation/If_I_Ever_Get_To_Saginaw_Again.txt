If I ever get to Saginaw again  
A locale thats somewhat off the beaten track  
Get to see the girl I never saw again  
Who must know why I have never ventured back  
We we young  
And so alive  
And now I wonder if shed cling to me  
Become my very own as she did then  
If I ever get to Saginaw again  
  
If I ever get to Saginaw again  
It wont be in Spring with meadows turning green  
It wont be to tangle with the law again  
And it wont be with someone one only seventeen  
Who gave her love  
And made me hers  
And when you find the one youre dreaming of  
Who thinks to ask How old is love  
Not when  
You may never get to Saginaw again  
  
If I ever get to Saginaw again  
I will get to see son who bears my name  
And perhaps Ill quietly withdraw again  
When I see the little man that he became  
And how I yearn  
To watch him grow  
A fathers love is maybe all it takes  
To not repeat those sad mistakes of men  
If I ever get to Saginaw again
