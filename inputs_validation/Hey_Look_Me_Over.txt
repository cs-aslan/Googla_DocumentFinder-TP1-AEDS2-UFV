Hey look me over  
Lend me an ear  
Fresh out of clover  
Mortgage up to here  
But dont pass the plate folks  
Dont pass the cup  
I figure whenever youre down and out  
The only way is up  
  
And Ill be up like a rose bud  
High on the vine  
Dont thumb your nose  
But take a tip from mine  
Im a little bit short of the elbow room  
But let me get me some  
And look out world  
Here I come  
  
Yes hey look me over  
Lend me an ear  
Fresh out of clover  
Mortgage up to here  
But dont pass the plate folks  
Dont pass the cup  
I figure whenever youre down and out  
The only way is up  
  
And Ill be up like a rose bud  
High on the vine  
Dont thumb your nose  
But take a tip from mine  
Im a little bit short of the elbow room  
But let me get me some  
And look out world  
Here I come
