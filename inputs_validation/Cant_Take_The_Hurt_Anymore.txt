Now that the past has ended  
My lifes an open door  
I know that we could have been mended  
Oh but I cant take the hurt anymore  
Cant take the hurt anymore  
Ooh ooh cant take the hurt anymore  
The rainbows over  
But Ive seen it leave before  
A love thats been left in the corner  
Ooh cause I cant take the hurt anymore  
Cant take the hurt anymore  
Ooh ooh cant take the hurt anymore  
Lady of my ladys  
Cant we find the right  
And leave behind the sorrow  
Lady of my ladys  
Cant we find the light  
Bright enough to guide us  
Cant take the hurt anymore  
Ooh ooh cant take the hurt anymore  
This love grows older  
But Ive felt it all before  
Yesterdays over my shoulder  
Ooh cause I cant take the hurt anymore  
Cant take the hurt anymore  
Ah ah cant take the hurt anymore  
My love I found has lost its crown  
But I just cant leave it die  
I fool myself and no one else  
cause I would if I could and I try  
Cant take the hurt anymore etc
