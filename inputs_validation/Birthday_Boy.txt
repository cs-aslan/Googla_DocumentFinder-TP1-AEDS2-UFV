Jesus Christ  
Pain  
Take one  
Yeah Pain  
  
Last time I saw you I was holding your hand  
And I couldnt wait for you to leave  
I knew right then that it was over and done  
And I couldnt believe that I was free  
  
Help me now Im going down  
And I dont know if Ill be ok  
Ill be around Ill be in town  
If you need a place to stay  
  
When the wind blows and theres a chill in the air  
I hope that someone is taking care of you  
Im alright yeah Im really ok  
Just so you know Im always there for you  
  
Help me now Im going down  
And I dont know if Ill be ok  
Ill be around Ill be in town  
If you need a place to stay  
  
This is Happy Birthday  
Happy Birthday to you happy Birthday to you  
Happy Birthday dear Aaron happy Birthday to you  
Youre no longer only just a teenager youre a fullgrown 20
