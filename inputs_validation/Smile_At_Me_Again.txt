Monday caught me early  
Comin down by surprise  
Waiting for a signal light to change  
Breathing something bitter  
That was burnin my eyes  
Thinkin Id go drink myself  
Back home on the range  
Shot down and sinking fast on Sunset Strip  
  
Holding on to something in my head  
Everything gets heavy when youre  
Losin your grip  
Nothin looks as empty as a motel bed  
  
Lord Im still a stranger  
In this Godforsaken land  
Farther from my future and my friends  
Im gonna take enough  
To wake me up and make me one  
Last one night stand  
Then take me home to somethings  
Gonna smile at me again  
  
Break my connections  
When I shake me loose  
Give my old equipment to the band  
Let my friend the devil  
Pay the rest of my dues  
Take me home to somethings  
Gonna smile at me again
