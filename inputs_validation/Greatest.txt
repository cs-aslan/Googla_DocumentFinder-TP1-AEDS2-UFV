I dont know why youre hurt inside  
Or what was said to make you cry  
I hope that you can see  
You are the greatest thing to me and when  
You feel like your not enough  
Ill give you wings Ill lift you up  
I hope that you can see you are  
The greatest greatest thing to me  
  
I dont wanna waste another day  
And took hand off you up in the middle of the day  
What I can see is you waste another day  
  
Cuz when Im with you I fall apart  
I see your permanently broken heart  
Baby your the greatest to me  
No no matter what what what  
  
I dont know why youre hurt inside  
Or what was said to make you cry  
I hope that you can see you are the greatest  
Thing to me and when  
You feel like your not enough  
Ill give you wings Ill lift you up  
I hope that you can see you are the greatest  
Greatest thing to me  
  
I dont wanna waste another day  
And took hand off you up in the middle of the day  
What I can see is you waste another day  
  
Cuz when Im with you I fall apart  
I see your permanently broken heart  
Baby your the greatest to me  
No no matter what what what  
  
I dont know why youre hurt inside  
Or what was said to make you cry  
I hope that you can see you are the greatest  
Thing to me and when  
You feel like your not enough  
Ill give you wings Ill lift you up  
I hope that you can see you are the greatest  
Greatest thing to me  
  
I dont know why youre hurt inside  
Or what was said to make you cry  
I hope that you can see you are the greatest  
Thing to me and when  
You feel like your not enough  
Ill give you wings Ill lift you up  
I hope that you can see you are the greatest  
Greatest thing to me
