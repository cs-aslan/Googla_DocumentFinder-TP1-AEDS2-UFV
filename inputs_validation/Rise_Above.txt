Uh you would have thought that from seeing me going hard  
That thatd motivate these motherfuckers to get on they job  
But instead they hating on what Ive been doing  
Having conversations in my face about what I should do for em  
What Imma do keep rolling and dropping weed on em  
Pack my bags look like Im staying for weeks but be gone in the morning  
If the flight is private we probably should board it  
You see it you like it I can probably afford it  
If niggas really felt some type of way about the shit Im doing  
You picked a crazy time to start letting me know  
Cause jealousy and envy thats a trait for mostly bitches  
Not a man so you aint one if you letting it show  
Now the money like the weed how we letting it grow  
And I aint holding on to shit Im letting it go  
Started small but now we all in them bigger game  
All in a bigger plane ballin and getting paid  
  
First the love was there  
Then the paper came  
Then the haters came  
But we still rise above

My phone is dead but I got a contact  
My sharpie paint pen on my Timbo combats  
You talk shit I wont respond back  
What they gon get and you dont want that  
That nigga will forget the deal  
Remember what get for real  
My whip appeal my crib is real  
My wrist as well you knowthe Richard Mille  
And my grunge nigga I make her come quicker  
Then rock toe socks yellow sponge nigga  
I Tebow for hoes that eat hoes  
Emojis fo me and my people  
The hoes love me Im on they TiVo  
I work they thighs and they kegels  
Skateboard I love Chanel  
Retweet me bitch Im Pharrell

Ill never be muzzled  
Im a piece to a puzzle  
Im Robert Townsend and my words gon Hollywood Shuffle  
My nigga I move moo my motivation is moves foo  
I get up and does do I evenly do ten things at once  
Multitaskin super fast and king of tattin super pimpin  
House of rollin run a business while Im tourin on you bitches  
Doing features while watching a double feature nigga  
I see you suffering from haterism get that check  
I take nothin and make somethin theres no breaks when the hustles runnin  
Aint dealin with fakes aint fuckin with snakes  
They all in my face now they got what it takes my nigga Im straight  
So dont reach out cause I peaced out when I reached out  
Theres no response like knockin on an empty house  
Yeah so I keep on while you peep on what I be on and youre behind  
Thats what karmas about
