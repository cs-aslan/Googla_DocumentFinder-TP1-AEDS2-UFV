Little yellow house sittin on a hill  
That is where he lived  
That is where he died  
Every Sunday morning  
Hear the weeping willows cry  
  
Two children born  
A beautiful wife  
Four walls and livins all he needed in life  
Always giving never asking back  
I wish I had a simple love like that  
  
Chorus  
I want a simple love like that  
Always giving never askin back  
For when Im in my final hour lookin back  
I hope I had a simple love like that  
  
My mama was his only little girl  
If hed had the money hed have given her the world  
Sittin on the front porch together they would sing  
Oh how I long to hear that harmony  
  
Chorus x 2
