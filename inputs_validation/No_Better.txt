Ah ah Ah ah Ah ah  
Wonder in youre wilderness  
Close enough take a breath  
Closer still touch youre skin  
Open up open up  
Let me in  
Dont you know youre taking me down  
Youre making me high  
My lifes turned around  
Now safe me tonight  
No better love  
Than when we make it  
To get up and taste it  
Intoxication this elation  
Uh uh theres no better love  
Follow up my fantasies  
So nice ment to be  
Nicer still whats to come  
Take a ride take a ride  
Come undone  
Dont you know youre taking me down  
Youre making me high  
My lifes turned around  
Now safe me tonight  
No better love  
Than when we make it  
To get up and taste it  
Intoxication this elation  
Uhh theres no better love  
No better love  
Than when we make it  
To get up and taste it  
Intoxication this elation  
Uh uh theres no better love  
dont you know youre taking me down  
Youre making me high  
My lifes turned around  
Now safe me tonight  
Ah ah mm Ah ah mm Ah ah mm Ah ah mm Ah ah mm Ah ah mm Ah ah mm  
Dont you know youre no better love  
Than when we make it  
To get up and taste it  
Intoxication this elation  
Uhh theres no better love  
No better love  
Than when we make it  
To get up and taste it  
Intoxication this elation  
Uh uh theres no better love  
No better love no better love
