Oh I cannot explain  
Every time its the same  
More I feel that its real  
Take my heart  
Ive been lonely to long  
Oh I cant be so strong  
Take the chance for romance take my heart  
I need you so  
Theres no time  
Ill ever go  
  
Cheri cheri lady  
Going through emotion  
Love is where you find it  
Listen to your heart  
Cheri cheri lady  
Living in devotion  
Its always like the first time  
Let me take a part  
  
Cheri cheri lady  
Like theres no tomorrow  
Take my heart dont lose it  
Listen to your heart  
Cheri cheri lady  
To know you is to love you  
If you call me baby Ill be always yours  
  
I get up I get down  
All my world turns around  
Who is right Who is wrong  
I dont know  
Ive got pain in my heart  
Got some love in my soul  
Easy come but I think easy go  
I need you so  
Although times  
I move so slow
