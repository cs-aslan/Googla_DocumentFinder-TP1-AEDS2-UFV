Since I become a shooting star  
Ive been wondering where you are  
Seems like your forever in a getaway  
Momma told me that it would happen to me one day  
Feels like weve been apart for some light years  
Crater in my heart filled with my tears  
Stars align Ill be your girl again  
What Im tryin say I want you back in my world again  
  
Youre the reason I dont change my number  
I want you to know that its still the same  
And I bet you remember that summer  
When we kicked it everyday  
Dont know how it happened just happened  
Kinda like we faded away  
And I feel so alienated dont you feel so alienated  
  
I miss you and I want you back  
I lost your signal Where you at  
And I dont know how we lost contact  
Where did you go Im searching for you  
Cant get you outta my system  
Outta my system Outta my system  
Cant get you outta my system  
Outta my system Outta my system  
Cant get you outta my system  
Outta my system Outta my system  
Where did you go Im searching for you  
  
Sitting watching time passing by me  
Voice in my head asking why me  
Im here wishing you would stop by my place  
But the only time we talk is on Myspace  
By the way have you found my replacement  
She should be the one on this spaceship  
Waking up reaching for you when youre not there  
You got me in another galaxy Im out there  
  
Youre the reason I dont change my number  
I want you to know that its still the same  
Oh boy I know you remember that summer  
When we kicked it everyday  
Dont know how it happened just happened  
Kinda like we faded away  
And I feel so alienated dont you feel so alienated  
  
I miss you and I want you back  
I lost your signal Where you at  
And I dont know how we lost contact  
Where did you go Im searching for you  
Cant get you outta my system  
Outta my system Outta my system  
Cant get you outta my system  
Outta my system Outta my system  
Cant get you outta my system  
Outta my system Outta my system  
Where did you go Im searching for you  
  
Where did you go Im searching for you  
I wanna know where did you go  
Where did you go Im searching for you  
I wanna know where did you go  
Where did you go Im searching for you  
I wanna know where did you go  
Where did you go Im searching for you  
I wanna know where did you go  
  
System Outta my system Outta my system  
System Outta my system Outta my system  
How can I get you outta my  
System Outta my system Outta my system  
Where did you go Im searching for you
