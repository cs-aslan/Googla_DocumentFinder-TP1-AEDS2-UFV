If your whole life somehow  
Wasnt much til now  
And youve almost lost  
Your will to live  
No matter what youve been through  
Long as theres breath in you  
There is always one more time  
  
If your dreams go bad  
Every one that youve had  
dont you think that your dreams  
Cant come true  
Because its funny about dreams  
Just strange as it seems  
Becouse there is always one more time  
  
Turnin corners  
Turnin corners  
Only a state of mind  
Only a state of mind  
Keeping your eyes closed  
Keeping your eyes closed  
Worse than being blind  
Worse than being blind  
  
If better a heart out there  
If better a heart out there  
Looking for someone to share  
Looking for someone to share  
I dont care if its been  
I dont care if its been  
Turned down time and time again  
Turned down time and time again  
  
And if we meet some day  
And if we meet some day  
Please dont walk away  
No no dont walk away  
  
Cause there is always always one more time  
One more time  
Cause there is always one more time
