Living in the sixth dimension  
Things get rough  
Living in the sixth dimension  
Can be tough  
Its so hard when your on your own  
When your on your own  
  
Moving in the wrong direction  
Brings bad luck  
Living without protection  
Really sucks  
  
Its so hard when your on your own  
You might fall into the forbidden zone  
  
Going down down down  
How far can you go  
You might fall into the forbidden zone  
Going down down down  
cross the border line  
The guards look scary but the girls are pretty fine  
  
Im going down  
Im going down  
Im going down i go  
Turning me around  
Turning me around  
Turning me around i know  
  
Living in the sixth dimension  
Moving in the wrong direction  
Living in the sixth dimension  
Moving in the wrong direction  
Living in the sixth dimension  
Moving in the wrong direction  
  
Its so hard when youre on your own  
When your on your own  
The forbidden zone  
  
Going down down down  
How far can you go  
You might fall into the forbidden zone  
Going down down down  
cross the border line  
The guards look scary but the girls are pretty fine  
  
Going round round round  
Driving me insane  
Everything looks different  
But nothing has changed
