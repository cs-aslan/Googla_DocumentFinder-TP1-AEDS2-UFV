After its all been said  
The music spinning in our head  
Cant forget the feeling of  
The magic of that summer love  
Ooh I wanna take you there  
Do you wanna turn back the pages  
Memories in photographs  
The world is changed  
And yet the game is still the same  
  
Isnt it time we danced the night away  
How about doing it just like yesterday  
Every time I think of you  
All of those things we used to do  
  
Remember those nights we spent  
Little did we know how the time would fly  
Isnt it time oh oh  
Isnt it time oh oh  
  
The good times never have to end  
Nows the time to let them happen again  
We can have ourselves a blast  
Good times that arent only in the past  
  
Isnt it time we danced the night away  
How about doing it just like yesterday  
Every time I think of you  
All of those things we used to do  
  
Remember those nights we spent  
Little did we know how the time would fly  
Isnt it time oh oh  
Isnt it time oh oh  
  
And as the sun goes down we raise a glass to kindness  
To all the good times we share  
Isnt it time we get ready again  
Isnt it time we go steady again  
  
Isnt it time we danced the night away  
How about doing it just like yesterday  
Every time I think of you  
And all of those things we used to do  
  
Remember those nights we spent  
Little did we know how the time would fly  
Isnt it time oh oh  
Isnt it time oh oh  
  
Isnt it time we danced the night away  
How about doing it just like yesterday  
Every time I think of you  
And all of those things we used to do  
  
Remember those nights we spent  
Little did we know how the time would fly  
Isnt it time oh oh  
Isnt it time oh oh
