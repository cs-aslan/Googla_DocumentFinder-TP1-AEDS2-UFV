Five names that I can hardly  
Stand to hear  
Including yours and mine  
And one more chimp who isnt here  
I can see the ladies talking  
How the times are getting hard  
And that fearsome excavation  
On Magnolia Boulevard  
  
CHORUS  
And Im going insane  
And Im laughing at the frozen rain  
And Im so alone  
Honey when they gonna send me home  
Bad sneakers and a Pina Colada  
My friend  
Stompin on the avenue  
By Radio City with a  
Transistor and a large  
Sum of money to spend  
  
You fellah you tearin up the street  
You wear that white tuxedo  
How you gonna beat the heat  
Do you take me for a fool  
Do you think that I dont see  
That ditch out in the valley  
That theyre digging just for me  
  
CHORUS
