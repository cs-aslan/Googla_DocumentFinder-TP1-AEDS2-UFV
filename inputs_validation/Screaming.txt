Ive watched you from a distance  
Ive passed you on the street  
Im obsessed with you  
I dont know what to do  
To make you pay attention  
and fall in love with me  
Im obsessed with you  
I dont know what to do  
  
Guess theres no place to hide  
when youre screaming inside  
Theres no place to hide  
when youre screaming inside  
  
Ive called you from the corner  
You dont pick up the phone  
Im depressed by you  
I dont know what to do  
To make you understand me  
To hear you speak my name  
Im impressed with you  
I could impress you too  
  
Guess theres no place to hide  
when youre screaming inside  
Theres no place to hide  
when youre screaming inside  
  
Ive explained it in my letters  
Im miserable as sin  
Im obsessed with you  
What am I gonna do  
  
Guess theres no place to hide  
when youre screaming inside  
Theres no place to hide  
when youre screaming inside
