Youre on the phone with your girlfriend  
Shes upset  
Shes going off about something that you said  
Cause she doesnt get your humor like I do  
Im in my room  
Its a typical Tuesday night  
Im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like  
And shell never know your story like I do  
  
But she wears short skirts  
I wear Tshirts  
Shes cheer captain  
And Im on the bleachers  
Dreaming about the day when you wake up  
And find that what youre looking for has been here the whole time  
  
If you can see Im the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why cant you see  
You belong with me  
You belong with me  
  
Walkin the streets with you and your wornout jeans  
I cant help thinking this is how it ought to be  
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself  
Hey isnt this easy  
  
And youve got a smile that could light up this whole town  
I havent seen it in a while since she brought you down  
You say your fine  
I know you better then that  
Hey what you doing with a girl like that  
  
She wears high heels  
I wear sneakers  
Shes cheer captain and Im on the bleachers  
Dreaming about the day when you wake up  
And find that what what youre looking for has been here the whole time  
  
If you can see that Im the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why cant you see  
You belong with me  
  
Standing by and waiting at your back door  
All this time how could you not know  
Baby you belong with me  
You belong with me  
  
Oh I remember you drivin to my house in the middle of the night  
Im the one who makes you laugh  
When you know youre about to cry  
And I know your favorite songs  
And you tell me about your dreams  
I think I know where you belong  
I think I know its with me  
  
Cant you see that Im the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why cant you see  
You belong with me  
  
Standing by and waiting at your back door  
All this time  
How could you not know  
Baby you belong with me  
You belong with me  
  
You belong with me  
Have you ever thought just maybe  
You belong with me  
You belong with me
