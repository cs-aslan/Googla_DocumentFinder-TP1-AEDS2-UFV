CHORUS  
While the poor people sleepin  
With the shade on the light  
While the poor people sleepin  
All the stars come out at night  
After closing time  
At the Guernsey Fair  
I detect the El Supremo  
From the room at the top of the stairs  
Well Ive been around the world  
And Ive been in the Washington Zoo  
And in all my travels  
As the facts unravel  
Ive found this to be true  
  
CHORUS  
  
They got the house on the corner  
With the rug inside  
They got the booze they need  
All that money can buy  
They got the shapely bods  
They got the Steely Dan Tshirt  
And for the coupdegras  
Theyre outrageous  
  
CHORUS  
  
Show biz kids making movies  
Of themselves you know they  
Dont give a fuck about anybody else  
  
CHORUS
