Blue again  
Blue again  
And you know darn well  
Its you again  
You said last night  
We were through again  
And now Im blue again  
  
Im alone again  
Alone again  
Im out around on my own again  
Theres a mockingbird thats flown again  
And Im alone again  
  
Now baby though I said I hate you  
I love you more every day babe  
Though I aggravate you  
All that Im dying to say  
Is that its new again  
You again  
And well meet today at half past two again  
And tonight well fight  
Again  
And Ill be blue again
