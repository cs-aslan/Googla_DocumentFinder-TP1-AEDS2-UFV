Well you talk about important people that you say you know  
Presidents and superstars of big television shows  
Well I know someone personally whos bigger than em all  
And next to him your superstars look mighty small  
And I have a talk with him each day and hes interested in every word I say  
No secretary ever tells me hes been called away I talk to Jesus every day  
  
Well now I dont think that Ill ever be in any Hall of Fame  
And the social register of wealthy folks might drop my name  
But my name is written in the book of life Im proud to say  
And thats all that really matters anyway  
And I talk to Jesus every day and hes interested in every word I say  
No secretary ever tells me hes been called away I talk to Jesus every day  
I talk to Jesus every day
