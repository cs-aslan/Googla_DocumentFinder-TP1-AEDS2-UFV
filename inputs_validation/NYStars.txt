The stock is empty in our eyeball store  
All we got left a few cataracts and sores  
The faggot mimic machine never had an ideas  
Mission impossible they self destruct on fear  
On a standard NY night ghouls go to see their so called stars  
A fairly stupid thing to pay five bucks for a 4th rate imitation  
They say Im so empty no surface no depth  
Oh please cant I be you your personalitys so great  
Like new buildings square tall and the same  
Sorry Miss Stupid didnt you know it was a game  
Im just waiting for them to hurry up and die  
Its really getting to crowed here  
Help me NY stars  
Contributions accepted all the same  
We need new people store  
Remember were very good at games
