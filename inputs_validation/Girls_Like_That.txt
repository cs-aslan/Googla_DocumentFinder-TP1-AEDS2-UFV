Im in a bad spot babe  
I cant hear what you say  
Id love to stop and talk  
You keep fading away  
Just the way she said it  
Something in her tone  
Always so convincing  
But shes good on the phone  
Ill wait until shes ready  
That could be a while  
She always takes her time  
Then she turns up in style  
Something not right  
Didnt recognize the car  
Women being what they are  
  
There is no sense of reason  
In a reasonable world  
Makes any sense at all  
To a reasonable girl  
She said you know what I mean  
But I couldnt understand  
Didnt know what she said  
Im a reasonable man  
It wasnt meant that way  
I was only having fun  
She looked me in the eye  
But the damage was done  
I got the vague impression  
She was under my thumb  
I looked the other way  
And I had to succumb  
  
Girls like that  
I want girls like that  
Girls like that  
I like girls like that
