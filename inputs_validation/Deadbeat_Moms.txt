Bitch back up cause your dimmin my shine  
You got nine kids only two of them mine  
I get you cigarettes weed pampers and similac  
Bitch start giving back fuck hittin that

And every time Im with you Im smelling nothing but baby poop

And Ima murder any friend of the court  
Throw a bomb in they office on the way to the airport  
Then blast off catch a flight to another life

Callin me while Im in the Bahamas with Lana and Donna  
Two freaks that I met with the hummer from last summer  
Anyway bitch howd you get my new number  
Fuck my baby momma she need a new weed  
That bitch did something that I couldnt believe  
She called up a priest she called the police  
And then called a lawyer and took half of my piece  
Fuck my baby momma I cant see it like Stevie Wonder  
All I know is when it rains it thunders  
My baby momma took me under  
Fuck my baby momma and my thirty kids  
Dont tell me bout shit that none of them did  
To all you deadbeat moms who be bringin the drama  
Fuck you in front of the court and fuck my baby momma  
Chorus  
Deadbeat moms are chasing me aint no one on my side  
Im packin all my shit up and Im taking off tonight  
Shaggy 2 Dope

You dont love them kids you only keep them to use  
You breathe fire all your baby daddies are rappers

Baby momma baby momma baby momma fuck off  
All I know you shoulda just jacked me off

So I just keep on hittin them with gauges
