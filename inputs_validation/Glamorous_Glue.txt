First day with the jar  
You find  
Everyone lies  
First day with the jar  
You find  
Everyone lies nobody minds  
  
Everyone lies  
Where is the man you respect  
And where is the woman you love  
Wheres the woman you love  
  
Third week with the jar  
You find  
Everything dies  
We wont vote Conservative  
Because we never have  
  
Everyone lies everyone lies  
Where is the man you respect  
And where is the woman you love  
Wheres the woman you love  
  
Everything of worth  
On Earth  
Is there  
To share  
  
I used to dream and I used to vow  
I wouldnt dream of it now  
We look to Los Angeles  
For the language we use  
London is dead London is dead  
London is dead London is dead  
London is dead London is dead  
Now Im too much in love  
Im too much in love  
  
I know  
Ill go  
Empty hand  
From the land
