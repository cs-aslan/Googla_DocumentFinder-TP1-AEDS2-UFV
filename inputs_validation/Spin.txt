Note Like Morei Sky and a couple of other submitted songs this is a Grey
Daze song Chester Benningtons band before Linkin Park  
  
I want to pick up the pieces so that  
Theres less complication so that  
Theres less conversation and  
Less aggravation  
  
I want to go out alone man so that  
Theres less confrontation and man  
Theres less association and  
Less company yeah  
  
I was so frustrated man that  
I was all confused man and that  
I was disillusioned and  
sick of your friends  
  
Chorus  
Run dont walk my way  
Dont look my way  
Cause I dont care oh no  
So why are you still here  
Why dont you disappear  
And spin out of my life oh  
  
Why do we have limitation and man  
Why do we have limitation so that  
We dont get very far and so that  
We dont climb very high  
  
I cant handle the indecision and  
I cant watch no more television and  
I wont miss you when youre gone  
Cause I know my life will go on  
  
Chorus
