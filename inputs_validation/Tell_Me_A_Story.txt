What must I do to take a holiday  
Show me a bill that they can make me pay  
Tell me a story  
And maybe Ill believe it  
  
Me Im just a lucky guy  
Young and free  
Too hard to cry  
  
Lorna from my school shes 21  
Shes good looking and a married girl so  
Tell me a story  
Tell me stories  
And man I aint complaining  
  
Me Im just a lucky guy  
Young and hard  
Too tough to cry  
  
Standing in a show  
The lights aint low  
Theyre shining down on me  
And I like I like it  
Just like I like I like it  
Im taking like I find it  
  
What did they do to chill the joy away  
What did they do to say you had to pay  
And pay  
And pay  
Tell me stories  
You know I never can believe them  
Never ever  
  
Me Im just a lucky guy  
Im young and free  
Too dumb to cry  
  
What must I do to take a holiday  
Show me a bill that they can make me pay  
Tell me a story  
And maybe Ill believe it  
  
Me Im just a lucky guy  
Im Young and free  
Too hard to cry
