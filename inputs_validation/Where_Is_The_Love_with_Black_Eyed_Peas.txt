Black Eyed Peas  
Whats wrong with the world Mama  
People livin like they aint got no mamas  
I think the whole world is addicted to the drama  
Only attracted to things that bring the trauma  
Overseas yea we trying to stop terrorism  
But we still got terrorists here livin  
In the usa the big cia the blood through the cripts of the kkk  
But if you only have love for your own race  
Then you only leave space to discriminate  
And to disciminate only generates hate  
And when you hate youre bound to get irate  
Madness is what you demonstrate  
And thats exacly how Enga works and operates  
Man ya gotta have love to set it straight  
Take control of your mind and meditate  
Let your soul gravitate to the love yall  
  
Chorus  Justin Timberlake  
People killin people dyin  
Children hurtin you here them cryin  
Can you practice what you preach  
And would you turn the other cheek  
Father Father Father help us  
Send some guidence from above  
These people got me got me questionin  
Where is the love  
where is the love  
Where is the love  
Where is the love  
The love the love  
  
Black Eyed Peas  
It just aint the same  
Always have changed  
New days are strange  
Is the world the same  
If love and peace is so strong  
Why would pieces of love that dont belong  
Nations dropping bombs  
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones  
With ongoing suffering as the youth die young  
So ask yourself is the lovin really caused  
So I can ask myself really what is going wrong  
In this world that we livin in  
People keep on givin in  
Makin wrong decisions  
Only visions of a different end  
Now we respectin each other  
And Ive my brother  
A wars going on  
But the reasons undercover  
The truth is kept secret  
And swept under the rug  
If you never know the truth  
Then you never know love  
Wheres the love yall I dont really know  
Wheres the truth yall I dont really know  
  
Chorus  
  
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder  
As Im gettin older yall people gets colder  
Most of us only care about moneymakin  
Selfishness got us followin the wrong direction  
Wrong information always shown by the media  
Negative images is the main criteria  
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria  
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas  
  
What ever happened to the values of humanity  
What ever happened to the fairness and equality  
Instead of spreading love were spreadin anamosity  
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity  
Thats the reason why sometimes Im feeling under  
Thats the reason why sometimes Im feeling down  
Theres no wonder why sometimes Im feeling under  
Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found  
  
Chorus
