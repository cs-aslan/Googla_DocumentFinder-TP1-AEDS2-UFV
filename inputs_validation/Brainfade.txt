Spit it out suck it in  
Let that genius flow  
All the answers to all the questions  
Theres nothing you dont know  
Experience is an asset  
When youve done most anything  
Just call it intuition  
Just call it anything  
  
Watch him fade  
The jack of all trades  
Backed against the wall  
Watch him fade  
Hes quite afraid  
To contradict it all  
  
I know you like a book  
I know all the lies  
I know that you know  
Your mouth is catchin flies  
Blank expression a burnt out bulb  
A thimble full of wit  
Endless stories never follow  
In short youre full of shit  
  
Watch him fade  
The jack of all trade  
Backed against that wall  
To an all but captive audience  
Watch out  
Here it comes  
Brainfade  
  
Take a minute to think  
Brainfade  
Stop flappin your gums  
Brainfade  
Youre gettin in deep  
Brainfade  
And Im fallin asleep  
  
When youre talkin to me  
Brainfade

Brainfade  
That what comes outta your mouth  
Brainfade
