Ride on ride on friends of the black swan  
Ride on ride on do you know where shes gone  
Gumdrops and Saturdays did Eric call by the way  
He knew he knew and he knew where the pillow goes  
  
Ride on ride on friends of the black swan  
Ride on ride on do you know where shes gone  
Buttercups and fishing flies the biggest thickest ever sky  
I know they know something  
I know  
  
Ride on ride on now friends of the black swan  
Ride on ride on you know where shes gone  
  
Little green men do OK  
Its the fairies revenge they say  
And gumdrops and Saturdays did Eric call by the way  
  
Ride on ride on ride on
