Theres a pine tree in a window in a house on a hill  
With a tree top angel sitting perfectly still  
Shes watching the shoppers walk through the snow  
With their arms full of treasures and hearts all aglow  
  
Chorus  
We held hands and stared at the lights on the tree  
As if christmas was invented for you and for me  
When the angel on the treetop requested a song  
We sang silent night all day long  
  
Theres a family thats gathered in some living room  
Dinner on the table thats been cooking since noon  
Stockings on the mantle are hanging with care  
While every body is saying a prayer  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Theres a room out there somewhere with a woman in a chair  
With memories of childhood still lingering there  
How pretty the paper the lights and the snow  
How precious those memories of long long ago  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
When the angel on the treetop requested a song  
We sang silent night all day long
