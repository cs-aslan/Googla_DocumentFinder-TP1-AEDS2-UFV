Oh if you could see me now  
  
Oh if you could see me now  
  
It was February 14 Valentines Day  
The roses came but they took you away  
Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm  
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is youre gone  
  
And Ill never get to show you these songs  
Dad you should see the tours that Im on  
I see you standing there next to Mom  
Both singing along yeah on and on  
  
And there are days when Im losing my faith  
Because the man wasnt good he was great  
Hed say Music was the home for your pain  
And explained I was young he would say  
  
Take that rage put it on a page  
Take that page to the stage  
Blow the roof off the place  
Im trying to make you proud  
Do everything you did  
I hope youre up there with God saying Thats my kid  
  
Chorus  
I still look for your face in the crowd  
Oh if you could see me now  
Oh if you could see me now  
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow  
Oh if you could see me now  
Oh if you could see me now  
  
Oh if you could see me now  
  
If you could see me now would you recognize me  
Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me  
Would you follow every line on my tearstained face  
Put your hand on my heart that was cold  
As the day you were taken away  
  
I know its been a while but I can see you clear as day  
Right now I wish I could hear you say  
I drink too much and I smoke too much dutch  
But if you cant see me now that shits a must  
  
You used to say I wont know a wind until it crossed me  
Like I wont know real love til Ive loved and Ive lost it  
So if you lost a sister someones lost a mom  
And if you lost a dad then someones lost a son  
And theyre all missing out yeah theyre all missing out  
So if you get a second to look down on me now  
  
Mom Dad Im just missing you now  
  
I still look for your face in the crowd  
Oh if you could see me now  
Oh if you could see me now  
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow  
Oh if you could see me now  
Oh if you could see me now  
  
Oh oh  
Would you call me a saint or a sinner  
Would you love me a loser or winner  
Oh oh  
When I see my face in the mirror  
We look so alike that it makes me shiver  
  
I still look for your face in the crowd  
Oh if you could see me now  
Oh if you could see me now  
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow  
Oh if you could see me now  
Oh if you could see me now  
Yeah Im just missing you now  
  
I still look for your face in the crowd  
Oh if you could see me now  
Oh if you could see me now  
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow  
Oh if you could see me now  
Oh if you could see me now  
  
If you could see you could see me now x2
