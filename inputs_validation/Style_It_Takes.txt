Youve got the money Ive got the time  
You want your freedom make your freedom mine  
Cause Ive got the style it takes  
and money is all that it takes  
Youve got connections and Ive got the art  
You like my attention and I like your looks  
and I have the style it take  
and you know the people it takes  
Why dont you sit right over there well do a movie portrait  
Ill turn the camera on and I wont even be there  
A portrait that moves you look great I think  
Ill put the Empire State Building on your wall  
Watch the sun rise above it in your room  
Wallpaper art a great view  
Ive got a Brillo box and I say its art  
Its the same one you can buy at any supermarket  
Cause Ive got the style it takes  
And youve got the people it takes  
This is a rock group called The Velvet Underground  
I show movies on them  
Do you like their sound  
Cause they have a style that grates and I have art to make  
Lets do a movie here next week  
We dont have sound but youre so great  
You dont have to speak  
Youve got the style it takes Kiss  
Youve got the style it takes Eat  
Ive got the style it takes Couch  
Weve got the style it takes Kiss
