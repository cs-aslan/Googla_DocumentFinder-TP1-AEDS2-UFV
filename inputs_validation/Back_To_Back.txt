Intro  
Oh man oh man oh man not again  
  
Verse  
Yeah I learned the game from William Wesley  
You can never check me  
Back to back for the niggas that didnt get the message  
Back to back like Im on the cover of Lethal Weapon  
Back to back like Im Jordan 96 97  
Whoa very important and very pretentious  
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention  
Yeah but its weighin heavy on my conscience  
Yeah and fuck you left The Boy no options  
I wanna see my niggas go insane  
You gon make me step out of my fuckin frame  
You gon make me buy bottles for Charlamagne  
You gon make me go out of my fuckin way  
I waited four days nigga where yall at  
I drove here in the Wraith playin ARAB  
Im not sure what it was that really made yall mad  
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make yall rap  
I mean woah cant fool the city man they know whats up  
Second floor at Tootsies gettin shoulder rubs  
This for yall to think that I dont write enough  
They just mad cause I got the midas touch  
You love her then you gotta give the world to her  
Is that a world tour or your girls tour  
I know that you gotta be a thug for her  
This aint what she meant when she told you to open up more  
Yeah trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers  
Yeah you gettin bodied by a singin nigga  
Im not the type of nigga thatll type to niggas  
And shoutout to all my boss bitches wifein niggas  
Make sure you hit him with the prenup  
Then tell that man to ease up  
I did another one I did another one  
You still aint did shit about the other one  
I got the drink in me goin back to back  
Yeah goin back to back  
I got the drink in me goin back to back  
Yeah Im goin back to back  
I dont wanna hear about this ever again  
Not even when she tell em that they better as friends  
Not even when you sayin Drizzy tell em again  
I been puttin on a show it was a sell out event  
Oh you need better seatin  
I didnt wanna do it gave me every reason  
The point Im tryna make is I dont ever need em  
Seen what youd do for fame or what youd do for freedom  
Please check em for a wire or a earpiece  
Please please do not let these niggas near me  
Please think before you come for the great one  
Please whos a real nigga and who aint one  
Please somebody stop me  
Im talkin boasy and gwanin wassy  
I got the fest in five days and its my shit  
Soon as a nigga hit the stage they gon  
They gon ask if I can play this shit back to back  
Yeah they want it back to back  
They gon ask if I can play this shit back to back  
I took a break from Views now its back to that nigga
