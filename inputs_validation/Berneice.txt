I can still remember I was eight years old  
The first time that I picked her up little did I know  
Shes taken me to places that Ive never been  
Did my first gig in a rocknroll band  
Berneice sweet Berneice  
  
Get a real job let the guitar go  
There aint no future in this rocknroll  
So go for your guitars go for your guns  
Better think twice its three against one  
Take your best shot its a showdown now  
Berneice sweet Berneice  
Oh Berneice wont you play for me  
  
A guitar woman needs a guitar man  
One without the other neither one of them can stand  
Remember where we came from we can do it all again  
So thanks to all you people give youselves a hand  
Berneice sweet Berneice  
Berneice wont you play for me
