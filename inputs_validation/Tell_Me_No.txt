Reaching for my dreams and  
Youre so quick to say what I cant do  
You criticize my actions but  
I dont see you standing in my shoes  
Im going the wrong way  
And doing the wrong things  
Every word just gives me fuel  
So come on come on come on  
Come on come on come on  
  
Chorus  
Tell me no  
Ill show you I can  
Tell me no  
Ill dig my feet right in  
Tell me no  
Just tell me that I cant win  
Come on Im sure Ill prove you wrong  
Come on and go  
Tell me no  
  
For every step I take youre right there  
Trying to block my next move  
And if youre making me feel bad  
Then tell me then do you feel good  
Im just human and all Im doing  
Is what my heart tells me I should  
So come on come on come on  
Come on come on come on  
  
Chorus  
  
No no no no no no  
It motivates me more and more  
And I think its time you know  
Youre giving me something to look forward  
And I cant wait for the day  
I can rub things in your face  
I aint gon stop til Im done  
Ive reached the top Im Number One  
But every time you try and tell me no  
Oh it makes me keep on keeping on  
  
Chorus
