I scandalized my brother  
While admitting that he sang some pretty songs  
Id heard that hed been scandalizing me  
And Lord I knew that that was wrong  
  
Now Im looking at it over somethin cool  
And feeling fool enough to see  
What I had called my brother on  
Now he had every right to call on me  
  
Dont ever cuss that fiddle boy  
Unless you want that fiddle out of tune  
That picker theres in trouble boy  
Aint nothin but another side of you  
  
If we ever get to heaven boys  
It aint because we aint done nothin wrong  
Were in this gig together  
So lets settle down and steal each others song  
  
I found a wounded brother  
Drinkin bitterly away the afternoon  
And soon enough he turned on me  
Like hed done every face in that saloon  
  
Well we cussed him to the ground  
And said he couldnt even steal a decent song  
But soon as it was spoken  
We was sad enough to wish that we were wrong  
  
Dont ever cuss that fiddle boy  
Unless you want that fiddle out of tune  
That picker theres in trouble boy  
Aint nothin but another side of you  
  
I know that it sounds silly  
But I think that I just stole somebodys song  
Shes a good timin woman  
In love with a good two timin man  
And she loves him in spite of the way  
That she dont understand
