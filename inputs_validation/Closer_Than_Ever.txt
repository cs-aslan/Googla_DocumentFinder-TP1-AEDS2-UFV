Honey Im home and its late the day is over  
Youve been running through my mind all day long  
And theres somethin Im just dying to tell you  
Were not lovin enough here at home  
  
And maybe its a womans intuition  
For I have those same feelins too  
Weve been living not loving together  
And Im so glad to hear it from you  
  
Turn out the lights come to bed lets get to together  
Cause when your touchin me you mean so much to me in my arms  
You know I said Ill be right there itll be heaven  
Well be closer than ever again  
  
Closer than ever again
