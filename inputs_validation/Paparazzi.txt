We are the crowd  
Were ccoming out  
Got my flash on its true  
Need that picture of you  
Its so magical  
Wed be so fantastical  
  
Leather and jeans  
Were rock glamorous  
Not sure what it means  
But this photo of us  
It dont have a price  
Ready for those flashing lights  
Cause you know that baby I  
  
Chorus  
Im your biggest fan  
Ill follow you until you love me  
Papapaparazzi  
Baby theres no other superstar  
You know that Ill be  
Your papapaparazzi  
Promise Ill be kind  
But I wont stop until that boy is mine  
Baby youll be famous  
Chase you down until you love me  
Papapaparazzi  
  
Ill be a girl backstage at your show  
Velvet ropes and guitars  
Yeah cause youre my  
Rockstar in between the sets  
Eyeliner and cigarettes  
  
Shadow is burnt  
Yellow dance and we turn  
My lashes are dry  
Purple teardrops I cry it dont have a price  
Loving you is cherry pie  
Cause you know that baby I  
  
Chorus  
  
Real good  
Were dancing in the studio  
Snap snap to  
That shit on the radio  
Dont stop  
For anyone  
Were plastic but we still have fun  
  
Chorus
