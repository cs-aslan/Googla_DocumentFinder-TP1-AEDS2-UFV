Gush gush gush  
Tell me when gush  
Make the pussy just gush  
Make the pussy just gush  
Make the pussy just gush  
Make it just gush  
Make it just gush  
I make the pussy just gush  
I make it just gush  
  
Im imagining things  
Do you wanna try  
Take off your halo and wings  
Girl I can make her fly  
  
I dont know whats come over me  
My momma didnt raise me that way  
You lit a fire from inside of me  
Thatd light your seat ablaze girl  
Light that ass on fire  
  
I could be the guy to treat you  
To a nice movie feed you  
But I dont wanna mislead you  
Tonight I think I wanna be dirty girl  
Do you wanna get dirty girl Come on  
Light that ass on fire  
Do you wanna get dirty girl Cmon lets go  
  
Girl the worlds watchin  
From sunset to midnight  
Theyre tryna catch a glimpse intimacy  
Of you and I  
  
I dont know I don know whats come over me  
My momma didnt raise me that way  
You lit a fire from inside of me  
Thatll light your seat ablaze girl  
Ha I light that ass on fire  
  
I could be the guy to treat you  
To a nice movie feed you  
But I dont wanna mislead you  
Tonight I think I wanna be dirty girl  
Do you wanna get dirty girl Come on  
Light that ass on fire  
Do you wanna get dirty girl Cmon lets go  
  
I dont know whats come over me  
My momma didnt raise me that way  
You lit a fire from inside of me  
Thatd leave those panties in flames girl  
I light that ass on fire  
  
I could be the guy to treat you  
To a nice movie feed you  
But I dont wanna mislead you  
Tonight I think I wanna be dirty girl  
Do you wanna get dirty girl Come on  
Light that ass on fire  
Do you wanna get dirty girl Cmon lets go  
Do you wanna get dirty girl Come on  
Light that ass on fire  
Do you wanna get dirty girl Cmon lets go  
Do you wanna get dirty girl Come on  
Light that ass on fire  
Do you wanna get dirty girl Cmon lets go
