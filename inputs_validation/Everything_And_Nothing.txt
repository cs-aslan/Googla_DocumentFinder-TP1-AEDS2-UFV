Its like jail its like flight  
Its a dream that breaks in the middle of the night  
Its like chains its like an open door  
Love is everything and nothing Ive been looking for  
Its coming home its lost at sea  
Its a hopeless addiction to sweet misery  
Its the poison its the candy store  
Well love is everything and nothing Ive been looking for  
I cant hide from the truth this love I feel for you  
Oh its the one thing that I cant ignore  
I know I cant explain the pleasure or the pain  
Your love is everything and nothing Ive been looking for  
Its like freedom its like a trap  
Its a short trip to Heaven and a long ride back  
Well dance on the ceiling and crawl on the floor  
And love is everything and nothing Ive been looking for  
I cant hide from the truth this love I feel for you  
Oh its the one thing that I cant ignore  
I know I cant explain the pleasure or the pain  
Your love is everything and nothing Ive been looking for  
I cant hide from the truth this love I feel for you  
Oh its the one thing that I cant ignore  
I know I cant explain the pleasure or the pain  
Your love is everything and nothing Ive been looking for  
Well love is everything and nothing Ive been looking for
