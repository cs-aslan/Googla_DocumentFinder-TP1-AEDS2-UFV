Ive been down in the Delta workin these fields  
Breakin my back I need a better deal  
So long Mississippi so long Alabam  
I want to face the promise of the Promised Land  
Ive got fevered dreams mighty plans  
I need a black top road I need a wheel in my hands  
So long Arizona so long desert sands  
I need to face the promise of the Promised Land  
Im tired of this river these nothin nights  
Im small towned out I need city lights  
So long Allegany so long Olean  
I need to face the promise of the Promised Land  
Ill need a world of changes I need a  
Brand new space  
I need an Eldorado thats got to be someplace  
Theres a line inside I think Ive crossed  
You better watch out now Im gonna  
Be my own boss  
So long Massachusetts so long Framingham  
I need to face the promise of the Promised Land  
So long North Dakota you must understand  
I need to face the promise of the Promised Land
