Here here in this world  
Where do we go  
Where can we turn  
When we need some love  
It seems that love just cant be found  
Where where do we stand  
When loves supply dont meet loves demands  
  
We got enough stars to light the sky at night  
Enough sun to make the whole world bright  
We got more than enough  
But theres one thing theres just not enough of  
  
Chorus  
Not enough love and understanding  
We could use some love to ease these troubled times  
Not enough love and understanding why oh whwhywhy  
  
Spend all of our time  
Building buildings up to the sky  
Reaching everywhere but where we need to reach the most  
Hearts never can win  
Oh in this race  
This race that were in  
  
Weve got enough cars to drive around the world  
Enough planes to take us anywhere  
We got more than enough  
But theres one thing theres just not enough of  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
We need some understandin  
We need a little more love  
Some love and understandin  
Enough stars to light the sky at night  
Enough sun to make the whole world bright  
Enough hearts to find some love inside  
We got more than enough  
But theres one thing theres just not enough of  
  
ChorusRepeat x5
