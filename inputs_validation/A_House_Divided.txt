We all know about the hate youre breeding  
And we pay for the machine youre feeding  
You can never shut up you can never shut down  
This house divided  
  
We all know we all know somethings wrong we all know  
  
Somethings wrong about the way youre thinking  
The rats are jumping and your ship is sinking  
You can never get on you can never get off  
This house divided  
  
We all hear about this case youre pleading  
Your demands have gone beyond conceding  
You can never get in you can never get out  
This house divided  
  
This is a sad day for violence  
When speech results in silence  
Im supposed to hate you  
Youre supposed to hate me  
We can never agree  
  
Solo Chris  
  
Now weve become so desperate  
Dont you forget you asked for it  
Im supposed to hate you  
Youre supposed to hate me  
We never agree  
  
Solo Chris  
  
Solo Dave  
  
We all know about the hate youre breeding  
And we pay for the machine youre feeding  
  
A house divided
