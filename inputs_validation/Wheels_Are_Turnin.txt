Ive been sittin back quietly  
Watchin as my spirit fades  
As all of my attempts to do rightly  
Get treated like some kind of terrorist raids  
Maybe I ask too much from you  
Well I aint gettin too much in return  
Im doin my best to love you baby  
But the wheels are beginning to turn  
When youre cut down to the bone  
You bleed but it heals  
You hurt still you must carry on  
cus the wheels are turnin  the feelings burnin  
The thrills returnin  
My soul is yearnin  my heart is churnin  
The wheels are turnin again  
Maybe Im actin irrational  
Hope I dont hurt your heart  
This whole problem is only geographical  
I just need some kind of new start  
And if I cant get inspired round here  
Im going out to the world and learn  
Theres action in my soul tonight  
I feel the wheels are beginning to turn  
When youre cut down to the bone  
You bleed but it heals  
You hurt still you must carry on  
cus the wheels are turnin  the feelings burnin  
The thrills returnin  
My soul is yearnin  my heart is churnin  
The wheels are turnin again  
I remember the last time I got on one of these rolls  
I learned all about the tolls that it takes  
I get something in my mind  it begins to unfold  
I get out in the cold  I cant do what Im told  
I get out of control  I cant hold on to the brakes  
When youre cut down to the bone  
You bleed but it heals  
You hurt still you must carry on  
cus the wheels are turnin  the feelings burnin  
The thrills returnin  
My soul is yearnin  my heart is churnin  
The wheels are turnin again
