All day all night you feel as if the earth could fly  
Three more all for fine Indian Gin and whiskey dry  
Fine Indian Gin and whiskey dry  
  
Small town closed down  
Theres nowhere else around to try  
Disturbingly a voice would cry  
Go home no loan  
Youll have you gin and whiskey dry  
Youll have your gin and whiskey dry  
  
Four ten four men lining up for their handy brandy  
Alls gone youre none came the bartenders reply  
But Ive tried and Im tied to Indian Gin and whiskey dry  
  
To Indian Gin and whiskey dry Repeat x4
