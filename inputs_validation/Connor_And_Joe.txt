You change your mind like Mollie dyes her hair  
Yeah you pms like a bitch I would know  
And you always speak  
About Connor and Joe  
You should know that your no good for them  
Chourus  
Cos youre hot n your cold  
Youre Connor and Joe  
Been out with Miles and James  
Your love always changed  
You fight you break up  
Never kiss or make up  
You dont really wanna say no  
But you dont really wanna go oh  
Cos youre hot n your cold  
Youre Connor and Joe  
Been out with Miles and James  
Your love always changed  
  
You and Joe used to be just like twins  
So in sync  
Our old energys  
Now a dead battery  
Used to sob over it  
And you still do now  
You should know  
That their not gonna change  
Chourus  
Cos youre hot n your cold  
Youre Connor and Joe  
Been out with Miles and James  
Your love always changed  
You fight you break up  
Never kiss or make up  
You dont really wanna say no  
But you dont really wanna go oh  
Cos youre hot n your cold  
Youre Connor and Joe  
Been out with Miles and James  
Your love always changed  
  
Someone call the doctor  
Got a case of a love bipolar  
Stuck in a single period  
Cant get out this time  
  
You change your mind like Mollie dyes her hair  
Chourus  
Cos youre hot n your cold  
Youre Connor and Joe  
Been out with Miles and James  
Your love always changed  
You fight you break up  
Never kiss or make up  
You dont really wanna say no  
But you dont really wanna go oh  
Cos youre hot n your cold  
Youre Connor and Joe  
Been out with Miles and James  
Your love always changed
