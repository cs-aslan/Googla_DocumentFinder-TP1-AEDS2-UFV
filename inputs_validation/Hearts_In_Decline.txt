Nothing lasts foreverI know that this is true  
But I never knew how true it was  
Til I was losing you  
Maybe Im a dreamer  
Or maybe Im a fool  
But I never thought  
That love could be  
So careless or so cruel  
You wrestle with the reasons  
But the reasons never rhyme  
Or comfort when the  
Heart is in decline  
And it doesnt really matter  
If its chance or its design  
Its going to take some time  
Love dont play no favorites  
You know theres no one thats immune  
Cause she changes her demeanor  
Like the phases of the moon  
There aint no easy answers  
You know theres only shades of grey  
But when its love or its survival  
I guess you gotta get away  
The days stretch on forever  
And the nights are so unkind  
And endless when the  
Heart is in decline  
And it doesnt really matter  
If its chance or its design  
Its going to take some time  
Its going to take some time
