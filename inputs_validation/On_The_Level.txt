I knew that it was wrong  
I didnt have a doubt  
I was dying to get back home  
And you were starting out  
I said Id best be moving on  
You said we have all day  
You smiled at me like I was young  
It took my breath away  
Your crazy fragrance all around  
Your secrets all in view  
My lost my lost was saying found  
My dont was saying do  
  
Lets keep it on the level  
When I walked away from you  
I turned my back on the devil  
Turned my back on the angel too  
They oughta give my heart a medal  
For letting go of you  
When I turned my back on the devil  
Turned my back on the angel too  
  
Now Im living in this temple  
Where they tell you what to do  
Im old and Ive had to settle  
On a different point of view  
I was fighting with temptation  
But I didnt want to win  
A man like me dont like to see  
Temptation caving in  
  
Your crazy fragrance all around  
Your secrets in my view  
My lost my lost was saying found  
My dont was saying do  
  
Lets keep it on the level  
When I walked away from you  
I turned my back on the devil  
Turned my back on the angel too  
  
They oughta give my heart a medal  
For letting go of you  
When I turned my back on the devil  
Turned my back on the angel too  
  
They oughta give my heart a medal  
For letting go of you  
When I turned my back on the devil  
Turned my back on the angel too
