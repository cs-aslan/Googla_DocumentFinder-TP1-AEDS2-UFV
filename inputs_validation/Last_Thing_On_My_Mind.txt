A lesson too late for the learning made of sand made of sand  
In the wink of an eye my soul is turning in your hand in your hand  
Are you going away with no word of farewell will there be not a trace left
behind  
I could have loved you better didnt mean to be unkind  
You know that was the last thing on my mind  
  
Youve got reasons of plenty for going this I know Lord this I know  
For the weeds have been steadily growing please dont go please dont go  
As I lie in my bed in the morning without you without you  
Each song in my breast dies a borning without you Lord without you  
Are you going away
