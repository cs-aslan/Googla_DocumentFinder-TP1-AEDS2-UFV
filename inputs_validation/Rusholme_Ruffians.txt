The last night of the fair  
By the big wheel generator  
A boy is stabbed  
And his money is grabbed  
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine  
  
She is famous  
She is funny  
An engagement ring  
Doesnt mean a thing  
To a mind consumed by brass money  
  
And though I walk home alone  
I might walk home alone  
But my faith in love is still devout  
  
The last night of the fair  
From a seat on a whirling waltzer  
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye  
Its a hideous trait on her mothers side  
From a seat on a whirling waltzer  
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye  
Its a hideous trait on her mothers side  
  
And though I walk home alone  
I might walk home alone  
But my faith in love is still devout  
  
Then someone falls in love  
And someones beaten up  
Someones beaten up  
And the senses being dulled are mine  
And someone falls in love  
And someones beaten up  
And the senses being dulled are mine  
  
And though I walk home alone  
I might walk home alone   
But my faith in love is still devout  
  
This is the last night of the fair  
And the grease in the hair  
Of a speedway operator  
Is all a tremulous heart requires  
A schoolgirl is denied  
She said  How quickly would I die  
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes  
La

Soscratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen  
This means you really love me  
Scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen  
This means you really love me  
Oh  
  
And though I walk home alone  
I just might walk home alone  
But my faith in love is still devout  
I might walk home alone  
But my faith in love is still devout  
I might walk home alone  
But my faith in love is still devout
