Baby wont you dream sweet dreams about me  
Let me share your love even if its only in your mind  
Baby wont you dream sweet dreams about me  
Dreams of happiness and secret pleasures we have yet to find  
And though were far apart wont you treat me in your heart  
Till Im back in your arms where I belong  
And dream sweet dreams about me till Im home  
  
The time has come and it wont keep that flame on the ground much longer  
Ive got to say goodbye for a while  
So hold me one more time cause hon Im gonna miss you oh I miss you  
So before I go just let me see your smile  
And baby wont you dream sweet dreams about me  
Let me share your love even if its only in your mind  
And though were far apart  
  
Baby wont you dream sweet dreams about me till Im home
