If we speak of lovin  
Will it come from our hearts  
Do we want this night of love to last forever  
Or do we just part  
Listen to yourself  
Are you sure thats what you wanna say  
We know that things sound different  
In the cold light of day  
Dont get dizzy and lose our heads  
On the merry go round  
I dont wanna be taken for a ride  
Keep both feet on the ground  
When we wake up in the morning  
Will there be anyone there  
Whoever is the first one to rise  
Will be the one who cares  
So lets close our eyes and go to sleep  
With a thought for the day  
Waiting for tomorrow  
Just to see if theres truth in what they say  
Lets say goodnight  
You know goodbye is a hard word to say  
Hold me close  
Weve reached the end  
So lets drift on away  
With a thought for today  
Break  
Im hopin youre wishin  
Ill stay by your side  
Im wishin youre hopin  
That a flame doesnt die  
  
And if we speak of lovin  
Will it come from our hearts  
Do we want this night of love to last forever  
Or do we just part  
So lets close our eyes and go to sleep  
With a thought for today  
Waiting for tomorrow  
Just to see if theres truth in what they say  
Lets say goodnight  
You know goodbye is a hard word to say  
Hold me close  
Weve reached the end  
So lets drift on away  
Drift on away  
Drift on away  
Drift on away
