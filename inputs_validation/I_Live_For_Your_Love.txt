Stand up stand on your own thats what they tell me  
You can make it alone but where does it say I have to move  
Far away from you to prove Im strong  
Oh when all it really proves is Im lonely without you  
  
And loneliness has to be wrong I live for your love everyday every minute  
I live for your love in my life want you in it  
I live for your love I admit it I live for your love  
I wake up with no one to kiss sometimes I wonder wonder wonder if I just
exist  
  
I know there are people I can see places I could be and friends who call  
Oh but what good does it do theres no substitute for you  
I want you or nothing at all I live for your love every day every minute  
I live for your love in my life want you in it I live for your love I
admit it  
I live for your love and your kisses and know how Im missing  
  
Your sweet tender touch tender touch I need you so much  
That I just cant go on anymore what I wouldnt give for  
Cause darling I live for your love Everyday every minute  
I live for your love Got one life want you in it  
I live for your love I hate to admit it but oh I live for Id die for  
  
What I wouldnt give for your love I live for your love every day  
I live for your love got one life every day every minute  
I live for your love I have only got one life I want you in it  
Oh my baby yes yes I live for your love ooh ooh
