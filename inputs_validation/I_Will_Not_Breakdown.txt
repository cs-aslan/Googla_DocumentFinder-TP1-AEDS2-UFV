I will not breakdown  
Tim Feehan Joe Brooks Gene Black  
Time was  
You could start a revolution with this disillusion I feel  
Time was  
You would never make a fool of me  
Cant see nothing but a violent solution  
In this war of confusion in me  
I should run from you but I never would be free  
I will not breakdown will you break down  
I will not stand still are you standing still  
I will not fall to pieces on the floor  
Just like you want me to  
Time was  
We could have a conversation without confrontation and tears  
Time was  
I wouldnt have to reminisce at all  
This time Im gonna make a move  
Im gonna make an uphill climb  
Thats what Ive been waiting for  
Bad luck I guess Im not a bird in your cage no more  
I will not breakdown will you break down  
I will not stadn still are you standing still  
I will not fall to pieces on the floor  
Just like you want me to  
Theres nothing left for me  
Cant you understand it  
But something left us here just standing in the burning ashes  
Theres nothing left for me  
Its not the way I planned it  
But something left us here just buried in our circumstances  
Time was  
You could start a revolution with this disillusion I feel  
Time was  
You would never make a fool of me
