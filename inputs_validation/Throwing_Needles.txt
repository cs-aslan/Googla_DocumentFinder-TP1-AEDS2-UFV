Whats there at the door that changed my life  
Without a simple reason why  
Feel another afternoon  
Split my poor broken heart in two  
Its not a friend that you and I  
Throwing needles at the sky  
March with friends thats you today  
Put them on and walked away  
  
I walked away  
I walked away  
I walked away  
  
You laughed the while you kissed my head  
Talk about the time we spent  
Picking arms up from the sand  
Sure to never never land  
In the middle of my story  
Fuel the bed to keep you warm  
Lie around and beat my head  
Feed the cactus im instead  
  
Get lost instead  
Get lost instead  
Get lost instead  
  
The end  
The end  
The end
