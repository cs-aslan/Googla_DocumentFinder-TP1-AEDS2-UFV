See my true reflection  
Cut off my own connections  
I can see life getting harder  
So sad is this sensation  
Reverse the situation  
I cant see it getting better  
  
Ill walk you through the heartbreak  
Show you all the out takes  
I cant see it getting higher  
Systematically degraded  
Emotionally a scapegoat  
I cant see it getting better  
  
Perverse and unrealistic  
Try to make it all sick  
I cant see it getting better  
Hollow now Im burned out  
All I need to break out  
I cant see life getting higher  
Love life makes you feel higher  
Love of life makes you feel higher  
Higher higher higher higher  
Higher higher higher higher  
Love of life makes you feel higher
