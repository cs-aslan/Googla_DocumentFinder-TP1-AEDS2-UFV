Holding you you holding me  
Everyone could see we were in ecstasy  
Making love against the wall  
Feeling very small when we didnt need to be  
  
Chorus  
Easy now dont let my love flow out of you  
Please remember that I want you to come too  
  
Oh my darling help me please  
When Im without you I fall down and graze my knees  
I look so funny and I feel sad  
Your love is all Ive ever had so please dont tease  
  
Chorus  
  
Yesterday you know tomorrow  
Could it be Ill have to borrow someone new  
I know that Im the one to blame  
But all the same there must be something you can do  
  
ChorusRepeat x3
