Darlin I dont know much  
I know I love you so much  
My life depends on your touch  
And my love is a river runnin soul deep  
Way down inside me its asoul deep  
Its to big to hide and it cant be denighed  
My love is a river runnin soul deeeeeep  
I work myself to death for ya  
Just to show I adore ya  
Nothing I wouldnt do for ya  
Cause my love is a river runnin soul deep  
Way down inside me its asoul deep  
Its to big to hide and it cant be denighed  
My love is a river runnin soul deeeeeep  
All I ever ever hope to be  
Depends on your love for me  
Baby believe me if you should leave me  
Id be nothing but an empty shell  
I know darn well I can tell now  
I dont know much  
But I know I love you so much  
My life depends on your touch  
And my love is a river runnin soul deep  
Way down inside me its asoul deep  
Its to big to hide and it cant be denighed  
My love is a river runnin soul deeeeeep  
My love is a river runnin soul deep  
Way down inside me its asoul deep  
My love is a river runnin soul deep  
Way down inside me its asoul deep
