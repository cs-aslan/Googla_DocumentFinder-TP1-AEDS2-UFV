Now the night has gone  
Now the night has gone away  
Doesnt seem that long  
We hardly had two words to say  
Hold me in your arms  
For just another day  
I promise this one will go slow  
Oh  
We have the right you know  
We have the right you know  
  
Dont say the mornings come  
Dont say the mornings come so soon  
Must we end this way  
When so much here is hard to lose  
Love is everywhere  
I know it is  
Such moments as this  
Are too few  
Oh  
Its all up to you  
Its all up to you  
  
Chorus  
Here I am  
The one that you love  
Askin for another day  
Understand the one that you love  
Loves you in so many ways  
  
Tell me we can stay  
Tell me we can stay oh please  
They are the words to say  
The only words I can believe  
Hold me in your arms  
For just another day  
I promise this one will go slow  
Oh  
We have the right you know  
We have the right you know  
  
Chorus  
  
The night has gone  
A part of yesterday  
I dont know what to say  
I dont know what to say  
  
Chorus
