I I got a new life you would hardly recognize me Im so glad  
How can a person like me care for you  
I why do I bother when youre not the one for me  
Oohoohoooooo  
Is enough enough  
  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign  
Life is demanding without understanding  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign  
No ones gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong  
But where do you belong  
  
I under the pale moon for so many years I wondered who you are  
How could a person like you bring me joy  
Under the pale moon where I see a lot of stars  
Oohoohoooooo  
Is enough enough  
  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign  
Life is demanding without understanding  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign  
No ones gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong  
But where do you belong  
  
I saw the sign and it opened up my mind  
And I am happy now living without you  
Ive left you  
Oh ohohoh  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign  
No ones gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong  
  
I saw the sign I saw the sieeign I saw the sign  
I saw the sign I saw the sieeieeign  
I saw the sign I saw the sign  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
