  
I heard some things about you  
I cant believe its true  
I heard the flame dont burn bright as it used to  
I heard some things about you  
I know they must be lies  
Dont turn your face away baby  
When I need to see your eyes  
cause I keep hearing rumors  
People telling me rumors  
I keep hearing those rumors  
Seems like everybodys my best friend  
Rumors dont go believing rumors  
I swear its only rumors  
Listen babe I dont want our love to end  
Its a shame  they talk they talk they talk  
I heard some things about you  
Suspicion coming on  
I need some answers woman  
Dont tell me nothings wrong nothings wrong  
I heard some things about you  
The way youre treating me  
You give your love to someone else  
When it used to come to me  
Oh Ive been hearing rumors  
Everybodys saying rumors  
I dont want to hear no rumors  
How come everybody wants to be my best friend  
I dont believe it no oh  
Its a shame  they talk  
They talk they talk  
They talk they talk  
They talk they talk  
Now Ive got so many friends  
Ive never had before  
And youre the only friend I want  
I dont want no more  
All these rumors I hear  
I cant believe theyre true  
And theyre trying to tear me  
Oh no theyre trying to tear me away from you  
Rumors I dont believe it babe  
Rumors  
Theyre just whispers in the wind  
Theyve got it all wrong  
Everybodys wants our love to end  
Rumors I dont believe in those  
Rumors lots of big rumors  
Rumors its only vicious rumors  
I dont want our love to end  
I dont want our love to end  
I dont want our love to end
