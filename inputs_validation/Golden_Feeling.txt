Though this place is so crowded  
You feel so alone cause youre eye to eye with him  
And you know he will take you  
Hes got nothing to lose and theres no way for you to win  
Desperados in love wont kill this sweet dove  
For nuggets of fleeting bliss  
Cmon cmon you cant escape  
The bleeding bullet of a kiss  
Here comes that golden feeling  
Its shining in your eyes  
Were always going on and on  
Right from that day they start to shine  
Its a new situation  
The start of a game youve already won the prize  
Hes a lunatic dancer  
Whos not aware that hes skating on thin ice  
Theres no turning back  
No time for regrets you shouldve known better though  
Another chance to fall in love  
Another chance to turn you on  
Another chance to turn you on  
Here comes that golden feeling  
Its shining in your eyes  
Were always going on and on  
Right from that day they start to shine
