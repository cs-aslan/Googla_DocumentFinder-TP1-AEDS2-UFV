Tele Hes Not Talking  
Tele hes the one he knows what to say  
Knows how to find his own way  
He knows the roads by night and by doorways  
But watching the light in a hall  
Wont change a thing or say at all  
What it is that he says  
  
Still he says that I dont know  
Still he says that I dont know  
  
Chorus  
I dont why I think about so much  
When I dont know what it is I cant say  
And I wouldnt change a thing if I believe you all  
And scream it in your face  
  
Still Id say hey I dont know  
Still Id say hey I dont know  
  
Tele deals the cards and draws an ace  
And finds himself miles away  
Where skies aint bruised by towers and fumes  
Children aint too young to play  
Would I change a thing  
Id change it all  
But were born different days  
  
Still Id say hey I dont know  
Still Id say hey I dont know  
  
Chorus  
  
Would I change a thing  
Id change it all when Im miles away  
Would I change a thing  
Id change it all but we were born on different days  
  
Id change a thing  
Id change it all when Im miles away
