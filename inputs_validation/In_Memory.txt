No one told me the way I should feel  
You left an aching heart  
Lost and lonely the feeling goes on  
You were the one friend I had  
You gave me so much love  
Now the tears remind me youre gone  
  
It still haunts me theres a silence  
Where you used to be  
It still haunts me  
Just an empty space in history  
It still haunts me  
But life must go on and on  
  
Its still haunting me  
Its still haunting me  
Haunting me  
Haunting me  
Its still haunting me
