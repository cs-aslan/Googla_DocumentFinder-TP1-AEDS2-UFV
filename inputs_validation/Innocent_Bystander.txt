Standing by the railway station  
Waiting for your train  
But the train never comes  
No the train never comes  
And I think Im going out of my head  
Yes I think Im going out of my head  
  
Running down the track  
Trying to reach the end  
But the end never comes  
No the end never comes  
And I think Im going out of my head  
Yes I think Im going out of my head  
  
Ive been waiting for the sun  
But it always hides behind the sky  
And time rolls by before my eyes  
Thats the story of my life  
And I think Im going out of my head  
Yes I think Im going out of my head  
Aaah  aaah  
Aaah  
Aaah  
  
Ive been waiting for the sun  
But it always hides behind the sky  
And time goes by before my eyes  
Thats the story of my life  
And I think Im going out of my head  
Yes I think Im going out of my head  
Well I Think Im going out of my  
  
I think Im going out of my  
I think Im going out of my  
I think Im going out of my  
I think Im going out of my head
