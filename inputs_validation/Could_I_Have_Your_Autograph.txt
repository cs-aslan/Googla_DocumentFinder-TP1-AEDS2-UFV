Dolly Parton  
Hello I dont know me from Adam you dont know me from Eve  
I just came here tonight cause I was lonely  
Youre no Elvis Presley Im no Marilyn Monroe  
But I do think youre sexy just thought Id tell you so  
Hey could I have your autograph  
Your name and your number on a small photograph  
Id like to know you and what youre all about  
Hey could I have your autograph  
Ive had my eyes on you and youre worth lookin at  
Could I ask you out or should a lady do that  
You may not be famous but you look like a star  
You should be in movies as cute as you are  
Hey could I have your autograph  
Your name and your number on a small photograph  
Could I interest you in a romance perhaps  
Hey could I have your autograph  
Got my heart in my hands and my head in the clouds  
And youre everything every girl dreams about  
And being with you would be heaven no doubt  
What I wouldnt do for your autograph  
Oh could I have your autograph  
Oh could I have your autograph  
Hey could I have your autograph  
I like your body could I help you work it out  
Maybe moving to the music playing on the phonograph  
Hey could I have your autograph  
Oh could I have your autograph  
You know youre just the kind to makes a woman real proud  
Would you take a chance on a girl from the South  
Could I have your autograph
