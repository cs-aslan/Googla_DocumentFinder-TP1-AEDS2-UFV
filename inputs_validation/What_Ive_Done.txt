In this farewell  
Theres no blood theres no alibi  
Cause Ive drawn regret  
From the truth of a thousand lies  
So let mercy come and wash away  
What Ive done  
  
Ill face myself to cross out what Ive become  
Erase myself  
And let go of what Ive done  
  
Put to rest what you thought of me  
While I clean this slate  
With the hands of uncertainty  
So let mercy come and wash away  
What Ive done  
  
Ill face myself to cross out what Ive become  
Erase myself  
And let go of what Ive done  
  
For what Ive done  
I start again  
And whatever pain may come  
Today this ends  
Im forgiving what Ive done  
  
Ill face myself to cross out what Ive become  
Erase myself  
And let go of what Ive done  
  
Na na na na na na na na na na na na  
What Ive done  
Na na na na na na na na na na na na  
Forgiving what Ive done  
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na
