Oo oo oo ooo goin on  
When in the mornin  
I must arise  
I look in the mirror  
It couldnt be clearer  
Somethin is gone from my eyes  
Goin on

Cause since youve been gone  
My mind keeps on reelin mind keeps on reelin  
My heart keeps on feelin heart keeps on feelin  
Why is my love goin on goin on  
Goin on

Things wont be the same till I kiss you  
Im empty  
Without you  
My hearts full with my arms about you  
Ooo ooo ooo ah ah ah  
We said it was over  
Were livin apart  
We couldnt quite make it couldnt quite make it  
But still I cant shake it but still I cant shake it  
Our love still lives on in my heart in my heart  
Goin on
