Aint nothing out here but me the road and the radio  
Looking for an exit and a song that I might know  
Counting down the memories and adding up the miles  
Searching for a feeling I aint felt in a while  
  
Clarity and inspiration  
Happiness is a destination thats hard to find  
It may take some time  
But in my mind theres something more  
And Ill open up a brand new door  
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind  
And Ill get there leanin on some friends I know  
The road and the radio  
  
Spent the night in Carolina got up early out of bed  
Bought a Red Bull and a road map and a old Stones cassette  
Setting my sights south bound no reason or rhyme  
Threw up a prayer just lookin just lookin for a sign  
  
And some clarity and inspiration  
Happiness is a destination thats hard to find  
It may take some time  
But in my mind theres something more  
And Ill open up a brand new door  
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind  
And Ill get there leanin on some friends I know  
The road and the radio  
  
In my mind theres something more  
And Ill open up a brand new door  
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind  
And Ill get there leanin on some friends I know  
The road and the radio  
The road and the radio  
The road and the radio  
  
Mmmmmmmmmm   
The road and the radio  
The road and the radio  
Mmmmmmmmmm
