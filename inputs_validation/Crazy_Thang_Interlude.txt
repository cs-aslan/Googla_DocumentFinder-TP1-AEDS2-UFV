Stop  
Just  
Come on now  
Just  
  
Sometimes I just  
Get out ya  
I just feel so confused  
No dont do that  
I just wanna know how you feel  
Dont do it  
I love you  
Mother fucker do you know what youve done  
Ive always needed you  
But I really love her  
You see love is a crazy thing  
At first it feels so good  
Laughter  
And you would think  
It last forever  
But then it also hurts so bad  
You know somethin  
I hate ya fuckin guts  
Leave me the fuck alone  
Then what you do  
Do you give up  
Or do you believe  
Ill always love you
