Verse 1  
Clipped wings I was a broken thing  
Had a voice had a voice but I could not sing  
You would wind me down  
I struggled on the ground  
So lost the line had been crossed  
Had a voice had a voice but I could not talk  
You held me down  
I struggle to fly now  
  
Bridge  
But theres a scream inside that we all try to hide  
We hold on so tight we cannot deny  
Eats us alive oh it eats us alive  
Yes theres a scream inside that we all try to hide  
We hold on so tight but I dont wanna die no  
I dont wanna die I dont wanna die  
  
Chorus  
Im not gon care if I sing off key  
I find myself in my melodies  
I sing for love I sing for me  
I shout it out like a bird set free  
No I dont care if I sing off key  
I find myself in my melodies  
I sing for love I sing for me  
Ill shout it out like a bird set free  
Ill shout it out like a bird set free  
Ill shout it out like a bird set free  
  
Verse 2  
Now I fly hit the high notes  
I have a voice have a voice hear me roar tonight  
You held me down  
But I fought back loud  
  
Bridge  
But theres a scream inside that we all try to hide  
We hold on so tight we cannot deny  
Eats us alive oh it eats us alive  
Yes theres a scream inside that we all try to hide  
We hold on so tight but I dont wanna die no  
I dont wanna die I dont wanna die  
  
Chorus  
Im not gon care if I sing off key  
I find myself in my melodies  
I sing for love I sing for me  
I shout it out like a bird set free  
No I dont care if I sing off key  
I find myself in my melodies  
I sing for love I sing for me  
Ill shout it out like a bird set free  
Ill shout it out like a bird set free  
Ill shout it out like a bird set free  
Ill shout it out like a bird set free  
Ill shout it out like a bird set free  
Ill shout it out like a bird set free
