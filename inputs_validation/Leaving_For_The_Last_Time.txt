I never thought that it would be  
Not in my wildest dream  
Ive realized that your not the one for me  
So why cant you see that  
I gave my all to you  
But you proved my love untrue  
So tell me boy what am I supposed to do  
About you about you you you oh o  
  
Chorus  
I gave you what you wanted  
I gave you what you need I walked the fire for ya  
But now Im gonna leave  
Im leaving for the last time I said Im leaving for the last time  
And now my eyes are open  
Wont be a fool no more  
I built my world around ya  
And now Im out the door  
Im leaving for the last time  
  
Verse 2  
Days And night would pass me by  
And all I did was cry  
Cause all the promises you told me where lies  
So why did you deceive me  
Now theres nothing left to do  
But get away from you  
I wish the way that I felt was so untrue  
About you  
About you you you oh o  
  
Chorus  
I gave you what you wanted  
I gave you what you need  
I walked the fire for you  
But now Im gonna leave  
Im leaving for the last time I said Im leaving for the last time  
And now my eyes are open  
Wont be a fool no more  
I built my world around ya  
And now Im out the door Im leaving for the last time  
  
Bridge  
I never thought that you would treat me this way  
Turn around and think that it is ok  
Boy you know that you hurt me  
And I just cannot stay  
You did me wrong  
For so long  
Im moving on  
Im moving on  
Im leaving for the last time  
Leaving for the last time No babe  
  
Chorus  
I gave you what you wanted  
I gave you what you need Yes I did  
I walked the fire for ya I I Im  
Im leaving for the last time I said Im leaving for the last time babe  
And now my eyes are open  
Wont be a fool no more  
I built my world around ya  
And now Im out the door  
Im leaving for the last time I said Im leaving for the last time baby  
  
Chorus  
I gave you what you wanted  
I gave you what you need Yes I did  
I walked the fire for ya I I Im  
Im leaving for the last time I said Im leaving for the last time babe  
And now my eyes are open  
Wont be a fool no more  
I built my world around ya  
And now Im out the door  
Im leaving for the last time I said Im leaving for the last time baby
