Wesley sox wilson  
  
Up in harlem every saturday night  
Where the highbrows get together  
Its just too right  
They all congregate and all night hop  
And what they do is ooh boppa dap  
Ole hanna brown from way across town  
Gets full of corn and starts  
Bringing them down  
And at the break of day  
You can hear ole hanna say  
Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me a gate I dont care  
Feel just like I wanna clown  
Give the piano player a drink  
Because hes bringing me down  
Hes got rhythm yeah when he stamps his feet  
He sends me right off to sleep  
Cheek all your razors and all your guns  
Were gonna be arrested when the wagon comes  
Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me cause I dont care  
  
I want a pigfoot and a bottle of gin  
Send me daddy move right in  
I feel just like I wanna shout  
Give the piano player a drink  
Because hes knocking me out  
Hes got rhythm when he stamps his feet  
He moves me right off to sleep  
Check all your razors and your guns  
  
Do the hueklebuck until the rising sun  
Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of gin  
Move me cause Im in my sin  
Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer
