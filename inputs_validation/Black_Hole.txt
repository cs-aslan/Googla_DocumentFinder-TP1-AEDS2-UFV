Some days go on forever  
Last long into the night  
Some days feel like December although its warm on the inside  
Forget the middle of summer  
I bet you I am alive  
Well wipe the floors together nice try  
  
Save it all  
You have all the answers  
Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it  
Crying out  
You have all the anger  
Blame it on yourself again theres nothing wrong with it  
Youre a black hole  
  
Some days are complicated  
Some ways Ill take the blame  
Some days I take it all to heart again  
This place is made of panic  
They check you every mile  
Thank God youre going out for a while  
  
Save it all  
You have all the answers  
Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it  
Crying out  
You have all the anger  
Blame it on yourself again theres nothing wrong with it  
Youre a black hole  
  
Nobody noticed what youre talking about  
Nobodys got a clue what youre all about  
Save it all  
Save it all  
rock  
  
Save it all  
You have all the answers  
Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it  
Crying out  
You have all the anger  
Blame it on yourself again theres nothing wrong with it  
Youre a black hole  
Youre a black hole  
Youre a black hole
