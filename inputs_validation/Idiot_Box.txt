You keep your riches and Ill sew my stitches  
You cant make me think like you mundane  
Ive got a message for all those who think that  
They can etch his words inside my brain  
TV what do I need  
  
Tell me who to believe  
Whats the use of autonomy  
When a button does it all  
So listen up  
Glisten up closely all  
Whove seen the fuckin eye ache too  
  
Its time to step away from cable train  
And when we finally see the subtle light  
This quirk in evolution will begin  
To let us live and recreate  
TV what do I need  
  
Tell me who to believe  
Whats the use of autonomy  
When a button does it all  
TV what should I see  
Tell me who should I be  
Lets do our mom a favor and drop  
A new god off a wall  
  
Let me see past the fatuous knocks  
Ive gotta rid myself of this idiot box  
Let you see past the feathers and flocks  
And help me plant a bomb in this idiot box  
From the depths of the sea  
To the tops of the trees  
To the seat of a lazy boy  
Staring at a silver screen
