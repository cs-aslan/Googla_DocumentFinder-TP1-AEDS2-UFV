I wanted to write a song called Cosmic  
I wanted to get a view of the earth  
I wanted to be a lonesome cowboy  
I wanted to love you till it hurt  
  
I wanted the right to misbehave  
To say she aint my crave  
  
Chorus  
I put these things aside for years  
Til laughter took the place of tears  
Its like I was asleep yet now Im here  
Im here  
  
I wanted to take your place just sometimes  
To know the things you know and why you did the things you do  
To say no one time and believe it  
Oh I wanted so much but only needed you  
  
Wasnt it just my choice to make  
The bed in which I lay  
  
Chorus  
  
I wanted to be able to talk without the interruption  
I wanted to sing exotic words  
I wanted to find a way to put the end to all of my destruction  
I wanted to reknow what I was worth  
  
But wasnt it just my choice to make  
The bed in which I lay  
  
Chorus
