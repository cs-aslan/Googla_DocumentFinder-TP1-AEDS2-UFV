Well it seemed like yesterday when the world was lookin dark  
It felt so cold and grey and why the hell am I even here  
Whats the purpose all I feel is guilt and hate and fear oh yea yea  
  
Till that day you came along  
My heart was empty like the soul was missing  
From a song and I thought I loved a few yea  
  
No one ever made me feel the way that you do  
Hey little girl look what you do oh I love you hey little girl I love you  
Well I know Im not always right  
  
And girl it breaks my heart when I have to see you cry  
So many things I want to say yea now I know that your the reason  
That Im here today whenever your here just stay near well be alright  
Yea alright hey little girl look what you do oh I love you  
Hey little girl look what you do and you do  
  
When all my love starts running thin I got you my own  
Cailin hey little girl I love you yea  
Ill be alright but I need you close please stay tonight  
As long as your here just stay near well be alright yea alright
