Man I miss my brother I swear to God  
Im still mad at myself that I couldnt take the charge  
I remember like yesterday phone ringing up off the hook  
Pandemonium in the north what happened to juk

Feds said DP got caught with half a brick  
That damn near stopped my heart  
Cause me and knowing my brother Im thinking this shit hard  
But luckily it was soft and fortunately he was straight  
Were findin to take it to trial but went on sign for eight

Got me a brick and started moving that weight  
His sister taking it bad mama trying to be strong  
Couple calendar years I never shedded a tear  
Wrote him a couple letters to tell him Im doin better  
Told him I took his Chevy and put the shit back together  
Told him Im gettin money I counted a hundred Gs  
Told me to slow it down play the shit low key  
Told me to make it happen focus more on rappin  
Cause fuckin round in these streets that anything can happen  
Told me I had heart plus he knew I was smart  
The only thing thatd break his heart is  
If I fuck around and catch a charge  
Told me to watch my sister and never let mama suffer  
And do what I had to do to overcome the struggles

Finally made parol they think he gon change his life

Half an ounce of the reddy rock man they got his ass again  
Judge gave him a bond now he out on the run  
With that fuck the world attitude still totin a gun  
Still havin his fun we clubbin it on the weekend  
Thought I had conversations bout going to turn himself in  
Wanted to raise his son gon get the shit behind him  
Plus he knew its only so long before they find him  
Lawyer was talking good say he gon get three  
When the prosecutor quit yellin they gave my brother eleven  
My mama damn near fainter my brother didnt want to accept it  
The hardest part for me I couldnt do nothing to help it  
Rap shit paid off now we all on TV
