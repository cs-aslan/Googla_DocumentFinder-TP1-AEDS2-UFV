My mom and dad are always fighting  
And its getting very unexciting  
To get a good job  
You need a proper schooling  
Now who the hell  
Do ya think youre fooling  
  
But its not my place oh no  
No its not my place no no  
No its not my not my not my place  
In the 9 to 5 world  
And its not my place  
In the 9 to 5 world  
  
And its not my place  
With 9 to 5 girl  
Its not my place  
In the 9 to 5 world  
  
Hangin out with Lester Bangs you all  
And Phil Spector really has it all  
Uncle Floyd shows on the T V  
Jack Nicholson Clint Eastwood 10cc  
  
But its not my place  
  
Dont wanna be a working stiff  
Lose my identity  
Cause when it comes  
To working 9 to 5  
There aint not place for me  
Aint my reality to me  
  
Vin Scelsas on the radio  
Ramones are hangin out in Kokomo  
Roger Cormans on a talk show  
With Allan Arkush and Stephen King  
You know  
But its not my place
