Temperatures rising  
Fever is high  
Cant see no future  
Cant see no sky  
  
My feet are so heavy  
So is my head  
I wish I was a baby  
I wish I was dead  
  
Cold turkey has got me on the run  
  
My body is aching  
Goosepimple bone  
Cant see no body  
Leave me alone  
  
My eyes are wide open  
Cant get to sleep  
One thing Im sure of  
Im in at the deep freeze  
  
Cold turkey has got me on the run  
  
Cold turkey has got me on the run  
  
Thirtysix hours  
Rolling in pain  
Praying to someone  
Free me again  
  
Oh Ill be a good boy  
Please make me well  
I promise you anything  
Get me out of this hell  
  
Cold turkey has got me on the run  
Cold turkey  
Cold turkey  
Got me on the run  
Cold turkey
