Well now baby used to stay all night long made me cry Lord she done me
wrong  
Hurt my eyes open and thats no lie tables turnin now its her turn to
cry  
Cuz I used to love her but its all over now  
Well I used to wake up in the morning get my breakfast in bed  
When I got worried you know she eased my achin head  
But now shes here and there with every man in town  
Still tryin to take for that same old clown  
Cuz I used to love her but its all over now  
Well she used to run around with every man in town  
Spend all my money Lord I better pass go  
Put me out it was a pity how I cried tables turnin now its her turn to
cry  
Cuz I used to love her but its all over now  
Yes and I used to love her but its all over now
