He was king at five card stud  
The strangers game was five card stud  
He was hard to beat  
Rather played an e  
As long as it was five card stud  
When he played he played for blood  
  
You had better beware  
Bet your poke and hed leave you broke and hed make a joke as he slidely  
Grinned  
Then hed say Its enough today and hed run away like the wind  
Stud was all he lived and breathed  
  
Never played to hand the same  
He could bluff you bluff you blind  
Could swear that  
He invented the game  
How he loved that five card stud  
Life to him was five card stud  
When he played he played for blood  
He was king at five card stud
