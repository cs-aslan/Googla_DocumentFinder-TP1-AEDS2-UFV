Im not the kind of person you think I am  
Im not the antichrist or the iron man  
I have a vision that I just cant control  
I feel Ive lost my spirit and sold my soul  
  
Got no control  
  
I try to entertain you the best I can  
I wish Id started walking before I ran  
But I still love the feeling I get from you  
I hope youll never stop cause it gets me through yeah  
It gets me through yeah  
  
The feelings that I hide behind  
Sometimes realitys unkind  
The nightmares stalk for me at night  
I dread the long and lonely nights  
  
Im not the kind of person you think I am  
Im not the antichrist or the iron man  
But I still love the feeling I get from you  
I hope youll never stop cause it gets me through yeah  
  
Im just trying live yeah  
Im just trying live yeah  
Im just trying live yeah  
Im just trying live yeah
