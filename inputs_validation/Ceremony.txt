This is why events unnerve me  
They find it all a different story  
Notice whom for wheels are turning  
Turn again and turn towards this time  
All she asks the strength to hold me  
Then again the same old story  
World will travel oh so quickly  
Travel first and lean towards this time  
  
Oh Ill break them down no mercy shown  
Heaven knows its got to be this time  
Watching her these things she said  
The times she cried  
Too frail to wake this time  
  
Oh Ill break them down no mercy shown  
Heaven knows its got to be this time  
Avenues all lined with trees  
Picture me and then you start watching  
Watching forever forever  
Watching love grow forever  
Letting me know forever
