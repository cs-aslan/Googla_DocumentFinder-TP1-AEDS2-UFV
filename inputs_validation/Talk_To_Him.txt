Give me a plate and Id break it  
Show me a smile and Id cry  
Give me your love and Id hate it  
Tell me the truth and Id lie  
Give me a crust and Id burn it  
Show me the way and Id shout  
Give me a page and Id turn it  
Well you could never put me down  
  
Misunderstood like a cockroach  
As tasty as a crab  
Who just tries to live for the day  
My worlds on my back  
People wont need to be frightened  
As frightened as I am  
Excepting I was born this way  
  
Dont sweep me under the carpet  
Tomorrow Ill be there  
Dont file me away for my sins  
Theres some I can repair  
Friends are now beginning to say  
So pleased with their despair  
How come I dont talk to him  
I didnt talk to him  
  
Give me an egg and Id suck it  
Show me the sun and Id freeze  
Give me a nest and some honey  
Keep all the birds and the bees please  
Helplessness under my wing  
People said dont talk to him
