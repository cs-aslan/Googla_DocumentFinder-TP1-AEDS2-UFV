I found out just a little too late  
I had my doubt but I decided to wait  
Even though I could feel somethin comin  
It came as such a surprise  
I should have known when you first started  
Runnin away before my eyes  
  
Im so out of season  
You left me cold and Im standin here freezin  
Im so out of season now  
  
I lost out  
I wasnt playing to win  
And I think about  
How I just took it all in  
  
Just when I thought  
I couldnt get any higher  
You cut me down to size  
I should have noticed  
When you put out the fire  
Instead I just closed my eyes  
  
Im so out of season  
You left me cold and Im standin here freezin  
Im so out of season now  
  
Im so out of season  
You let me go and you gave me no reason  
Im so out of season now
