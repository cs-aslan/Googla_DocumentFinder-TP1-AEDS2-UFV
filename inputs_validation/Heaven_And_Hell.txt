On top of the sky is a place where you go if youve done nothing wrong  
If youve done nothing wrong  
And down in the ground is a place where you go if youve been a bad boy  
If youve been a bad boy  
  
Why cant we have eternal life  
And never die  
Never die  
In the place up above you grow feather wings and you fly round and round  
With a harp singing hymns  
  
And down in the ground you grow horns and a tail and you carry a fork  
And burn away  
  
Why cant we have eternal life And never die  
Never die
