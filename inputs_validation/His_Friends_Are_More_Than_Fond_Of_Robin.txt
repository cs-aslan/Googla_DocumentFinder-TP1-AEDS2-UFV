His friends are more than fond of Robin  
He doesnt need to compliment them  
And always as he leaves he leaves them  
Feeling proud just to know him  
  
When Robin goes on holiday  
Theres noone livin in our lane  
Oh yes folks still live in our lane  
But theyre not like Robin  
  
Robin Ive never told you  
But Ill be yours until were old  
Please learn to call me in your dreams  
The way Im lookin at you is just as it seems  
  
Hes talked about before he gets there  
Though he can never understand it  
And I wouldnt like to be his alone  
But Im shy and cant demand it  
  
But when Robin gives his love to others  
Theres noone living in my heart  
Oh yes I keep others in my heart  
But theyre not like Robin
