No one said it had to be this way  
Why are we the victims of their final word  
  
Dying world is killing us so slowly  
I believe no god may save us now  
  
Cant you see what I see  
Sinners say your prayers tonight  
Your judgment day is here  
Child tomorrow will die not even  
Born jesus our questions  
He never seems to hear  
Dying for the answers may be  
The price we pay to find the  
Key to our lives  
Is there a heaven is there a hell  
Whos this god tell me theres  
No god above why  
We chose what lord deep  
Within our souls  
Hes not one thing  
We are his spirit  
We could save this world  
From destruction day  
Cant you see what I see  
  
You and I victims of their word  
As the masters of power  
Try to poison our world  
  
Greed money taken over  
Their souls youre  
Just mechanical brains  
Politicians dont know  
Just dont know  
We can chance this world we  
Live in dont let it die
