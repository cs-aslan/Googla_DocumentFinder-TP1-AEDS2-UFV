Tried to get away from you  
When you said that I was wrong  
I tried to get away from you  
But your hold is much too strong  
  
Youve got a magic spell on me  
And theres nothing I can do  
Youve got a magic spell on me  
And I cant get away get away from the  
  
Chorus  
Hard hard magic hard magic you do  
Hard hard magic hard magic with you  
Shake shake I could break everytime  
Think think give or take losing my mind  
With all the hard hard magic hard magic you do  
  
I tried to break away from you  
But I didnt wanna fight  
I tried to break away from you  
But your grip is much too tight  
  
Youve got a magic spell on me  
And Im stuck to you like glue  
You put a magic spell on me  
So I cant get away get away from the  
  
chorus  
  
Ive tried everything I know  
I dont think I like your hard magic  
Ive struck every single blow  
But the spell is much to hard for me  
  
Oh my Im not scared go away  
Not another night with vampires  
Hey is your bite any worse than your bark  
Oh how divine keep howlin baby
