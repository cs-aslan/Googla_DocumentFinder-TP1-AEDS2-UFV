I better keep myself from being busted  
I better keep myself out of jail  
Cause I aint got a friend to get me trusted  
Thats why my mama sends my money through the mail  
  
Ive been down on my luck  
Ive been down on my wealth  
Im gonna start taking care of business  
Start taking care of my health  
  
Ive gotta leave this town  
Ive gotta leave this town behind  
Ive gotta leave this town tonight  
  
Well I set off down the main street  
With such a long long way to go  
But before I started I was cornered on the corner  
Still waiting for my sugar to show  
  
Ive been down on my luck  
Ive been down on my wealth  
Ive gotta stop taking care of somebodys elses business  
Start taking care of myself  
  
Ive gotta leave this town  
Ive gotta leave this town behind  
Ive gotta leave this town tonight  
  
I was fooling around with the sheriffs daughter  
She was a real fine fox  
But the sheriff  he came after  
And threatened to lock me in a cell box  
  
He showed me his magnum  
He showed me his shotgun  
He stuck it in my face  
And said Boy I think you best be gone  
  
Ive gotta leave this town  
Ive gotta leave this town behind  
Ive gotta leave this town tonight
