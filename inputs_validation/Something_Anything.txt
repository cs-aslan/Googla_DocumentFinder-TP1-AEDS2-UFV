Like a melody that is impossible to play away  
In my memory theres a part of you thats gone away  
To keep my mind from wondering  
Im wondering  
To keep myself on falling  
Im following  
  
Chorus  
Something Anything just to keep on living  
Just to keep on breathing for a moment longer  
Something Anything just to keep on living  
Just to keep on breathing for a moment longer  
  
Id tell you anything if I had anything to say ehh  
I keep a battle in cause theres a time and theres a place for this  
I keep my story where it is  
An act this it  
Dont even all wanna this  
When all I need is  
  
Chorus
