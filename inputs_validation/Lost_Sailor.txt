Compass card is spinning  
Helm is swinging to and fro  
Oh where is the dog star  
Oh wheres the moon  
Youre a lost sailor  
Youve been too long at sea  
Some days the gales are howling  
Some days the sea is still as glass  
Oh raise the main sail  
Oh lash the mast  
Youre a lost sailor  
Youve been too long at sea  
Now the shorelines beckon  
Yeah theres a price for being free  
Hear the sea birds cryin and theres a ghost wind blowing  
And its calling you to that misty swirling sea  
Till the chains of your dreams are broken  
No place in this world you can be  
Youre a lost sailor  
Youve been away too long at sea  
Now the shorelines beckon  
Yeah theres a price for being free  
Driftin youre driftin  
Yeah driftin and dreamin  
Cause theres a place youve never been  
Maybe a place youve never seen now  
You can hear them callin on the wind  
Oh you drift your life away  
Incomprehensible  
Hey baby drift your life away  
Driftin and dreamin  
Really goin on a dream now  
Really goin on a dream really goin on a dream  
Really goin on a dream
