Every girls a story call it morning glory  
She wakes it up and pony whoa  
Dancing on the table everybodys  
Holding up his dollars pointing as he hollers

I want a secret family with you  
Waiting out for you baby

Looking for an adult  
Standing in the mirror  
Tryna get you nearer  
Funking is the meaner

He said Ive been a lonely man du du du du du du du  
Such a lonely man du du du du du du du
