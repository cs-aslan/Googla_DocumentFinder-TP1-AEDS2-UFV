Who wouldve thought of it  
That I might feel like this  
Some kind of wonderful  
Theres nothing quite comparable  
  
The thing about it is  
Its oh so innocent  
I wasnt looking for  
It came knockin at my door  
  
Im trying to do things right  
But Im about to lose this fight  
Cause spending time with you  
Well it feels so good and thats the truth  
  
And every day with you  
I swear it brings me closer  
To my only reservation is you  
My sweet temptation baby  
  
Chorus  
Oh my heart is calling  
Im falling for you  
Oh my heart is calling  
Im falling for you  
  
Who could imagine it  
I found my happiness  
In someone I barely know  
And I like to take it slow  
  
But youre so different boy  
Youre breaking all my rules  
What is it in your smile  
That makes me feel the way I do  
  
Im trying to live my life  
And Im trying to live it right  
If I desire you  
It aint because Im trying to  
  
Boy everyday with you  
I swear it brings me closer to  
My only reservation is you  
My sweet temptation baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive given it consideration uh huh  
And it all adds up to you  
I wont deny this heart is calling for you baby  
Ive given it a lot of thought uh huh  
And it all ends up on you  
My sweet temptation  
God knows Im falling for you  
  
Chorus  
  
Is is in your smile boy  
Is it touch baby  
I dont know why
