I need you here tonight  
Your body next to mine  
I havent seen you for a while  
I need your tender kiss  
The touch of your fingertips  
I havent seen you for some time now  
I need to touch you like I used to do before  
Though I have touched you girl a million times or more  
I dont know how to love no more  
I dont know what Im waiting for  
Take it to your heart my friend and teach me how to love again  
I dont know how to cry no more  
So tell me what Im living for  
Take it to your heart my friend and teach me how to love again  
Yeah teach me  
I need you here tonight  
To squeeze and hold you tight  
And feel your skin so close to mine  
I wonder where you are  
So near but yet so far  
Your name is always on my mind  
I need to touch you like I used to do before  
I dont know how to love no more  
Come on teach me  
Yeah teach me  
Come on and teach me  
I need you here tonight  
Ive been longing for some time now  
I need to touch you like I used to do before  
Come on and teach me  
I dont know how to love no more  
I dont know how to love no more  
No I dont know what Im waiting for  
I dont know how to cry no more  
No I dont know how to love no more
