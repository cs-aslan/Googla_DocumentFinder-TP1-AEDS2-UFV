I loved you once  
But look at you now  
Youre in somebody elses bed  
I loved you once  
So I dont know how  
Youre with a man like that  
Youd be better off dead  
He dont care  
He dont treat you right  
Its not fair  
I still want you at night  
Cant you see you made a mistake girl  
He treats you like dirt and I hate it  
  
Na na na na na na lady look at your hands  
You got two fat children and a drunken man  
Betcha dont betcha dont betcha dont like your life  
Betcha dont betcha dont betcha dont like it  
Ma ma ma ma baby look at your hands  
You should have been my woman when you had the chance  
Betcha dont betcha dont betcha dont like your life  
Betcha dont betcha dont betcha dont like your life now  
  
He hits you once  
He hits you twice  
He dont care about the blood on his hands  
But thats okay  
Cause its his wife  
Its the only thing she understands he says  
  
Say youre gonna leave him  
Say youre gonna try  
But youre only talking youre only talking  
Oh I know you think Im a young boy  
But Im good and I think we can make it  
  
Na na na na na na lady look at your hands  
You got two fat children and a drunken man  
Betcha dont betcha dont betcha dont like your life  
Betcha dont betcha dont betcha dont like it  
Ma ma ma ma baby look at your hands  
You should have been my woman when you had the chance  
Betcha dont betcha dont betcha dont like your life  
Betcha dont betcha dont betcha dont like your life now  
  
Dont like your guy now  
  
Well excuse me baby but its making me mad  
The only one you want is the only one youll never have  
Its so sad  
The only one youll never have  
Its too bad  
Only one youll never have  
  
Na na na na na na lady look at your hands  
Youve got two fat children and a drunken man  
And I bet you dont like your life now
