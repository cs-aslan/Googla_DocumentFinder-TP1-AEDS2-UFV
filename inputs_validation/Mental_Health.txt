Lets go  
The lights are on but there is no one home  
Yeah Im the type of guy that shouldnt be left alone  
They say just one more night of observation  
Theres nothing like a permanent vacation  
I break down like you want me to  
But I will not give control to you  
Sniff like a pound of glue  
Forget all the things youll put me through  
Dial up the residue  
Now Im nuts just like a blue cashew  
I go psycho psycho  
Psycho psycho  
And all I want is to go home just for a bit  
But these padded rooms are the shit  
Whoa Im happy in my mental health  
Whoa these conversations with myself  
Whoa they say that only time will tell  
Whatever Im happy in my mental health  
Im happy in my mental health  
1 2 1 2 3 go  
Hey meet a friend of mine now whered he go  
Hes probably sitting there but you would never know  
They say just one more shock try not to resist  
They say lie down and bite on this  
You let the shocks away  
But the voices in my head are here to stay  
No bullshit tests today  
I get more drugs than the DEA  
One day theyll do a play  
They take your shoelaces away  
We go psycho psycho  
Psycho psycho  
And all I want is to go home just for a bit  
But these padded rooms are the shit  
Whoa Im happy in my mental health  
Whoa these conversations with myself  
Whoa they say that only time will tell  
Whatever Im happy in my mental health  
Straitjacket bad habit  
Cause I live for the havoc  
This static illmatic  
Double dose is just like magic  
Straight jacket lets have it  
You pump up all my panic  
Welcome this is my life  
A padded room up in the attic  
And all I want is to go home just for a bit  
But these padded rooms are the shit  
Whoa Im happy in my mental health  
Whoa these conversations with myself  
Whoa they say that only time will tell  
Whatever Im happy in my mental health  
Psycho psycho  
Im happy in my mental health  
Psycho psycho  
Im happy in my mental health  
Psycho psycho  
Im happy in my mental health  
Psycho psycho  
Im happy in my mental health
