Oh Linda you done me wrong  
Im gonna sing you a goodbye song  
Sing a song thats most unkind  
I aint even gonna try to change your mind  
  
Oh Linda you made me grieve  
I feel like I could die  
Look out baby the moon is falling  
Down from your sky  
  
Oh gal dont you say goodbye  
Now that I need you by my side  
Love me now or be on your way  
If you go be gone to stay  
  
I saw Linda late last night  
Dressed for town she looked alright  
Painted eyes and lips like wine  
Walkin on down with a friend of mine  
  
Oh gal dont you say so long  
I feel like I could die  
Look out baby the moon is falling  
Down from your sky  
  
Oh gal dont you be unkind  
I aint even gonna try to change your mind  
Love me now or be on your way  
If you go be gone to stay  
  
Oh Linda you made me grieve  
I feel like I could die  
Look out baby the moon is falling  
Down from your sky  
  
Oh gal dont you say goodbye  
Now that I need you by my side  
You can have everything I own  
Take everything but acome on home  
  
Oh gal dont you say so long  
I feel like I could die  
Look out baby the moon is falling  
Down from your sky  
  
Oh gal dont you do me wrong  
Im gonna sing you a goodbye song  
Sing a song thats most unkind  
I aint even gonna try to change your mind
