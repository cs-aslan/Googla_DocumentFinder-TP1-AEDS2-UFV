Theres a stranger in my mirror  
Who dont know how to behave  
He keeps grinnin bout you and whistlin tunes  
While he ought to be watchin me shave  
We move alike and we look the same  
But I swear weve got totally different brains  
And the love were in with you  
Just makes it clearer  
He used to be my twin  
Now theres a stranger in my mirror  
  
And he doesnt want to go out drinkin  
With all of his friends no more  
Hes got both of thinkin youre what were livin for  
Weve gone crazy and we cant recover  
Youre always on one mind or the other  
I admit we should be certified  
Hes a little schizophrenic and so am I  
  
Theres a stranger in my mirror  
Who dont know how to behave  
He keeps grinnin bout you and whistlin tunes  
While he ought to be watchin me shave  
We move alike and we look the same  
But I swear weve got totally different brains  
And the love were in with you  
Just makes it clearer  
He used to be my twin  
Now theres a stranger in my mirror  
  
And hes always doin little things  
I never thought Id do  
Like lookin at diamond rings  
Drawin hearts and writin I love yous  
Thought it was just a case of mild affection  
Until I caught a glimpse of my reflection  
I looked up into my own eyes  
And saw someone startin back I didnt recognize  
  
Theres a stranger in my mirror  
Who dont know how to behave  
He keeps grinnin bout you and whistlin tunes  
While he ought to be watchin me shave  
We move alike and we look the same  
But I swear weve got totally different brains  
And the love were in with you  
Just makes it clearer  
He used to be my twin  
Now theres a stranger in my mirror  
  
Lord Im in love with you  
Now theres a stranger in my mirror
