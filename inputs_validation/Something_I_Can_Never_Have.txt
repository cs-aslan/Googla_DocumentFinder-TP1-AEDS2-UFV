I still recall the taste of your tears  
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears  
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore  
Scraping through my head til I dont want to sleep anymore  
  
You make this all go away  
You make this all go away  
Im down to just one thing Im starting to scare myself  
You make this all go away  
You make it all go away  
I just want something  
I just want something I can never have  
  
You always were the one to show me how  
Back then I couldnt do the things that I can do now  
This thing is slowly taking me apart  
Grey would be the color if I had a heart  
  
You make this all go away  
You make this all go away  
Im down to just one thing Im starting to scare myself  
You make this all go away  
You make it all go away  
I just want something  
I just want something I can never have  
  
In this place it seems like such a shame  
Though it all looks different now  
I know its still the same  
Everywhere I look youre all I see  
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be
