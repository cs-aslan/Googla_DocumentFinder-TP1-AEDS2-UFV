Have you seen my childhood  
Im searching for the world that I come from  
Cause Ive been looking around  
In the lost and found of my heart  
No one understands me  
They view it as such strange eccentricities  
Cause I keep kidding around  
Like a child but pardon me  
  
People say Im not okay  
Cause I love such elementary things  
Its been my fate to compensate  
For the childhood  
Ive never known  
  
Have you seen my childhood  
Im searching for that wonder in my youth  
Like pirates in adventurous dreams  
Of conquest and kings on the throne  
  
Before you judge me try hard to love me  
Look within your heart then ask  
Have you seen my childhood  
  
People say Im strange that way  
Cause I love such elementary things  
Its been my fate to compensate  
For the childhood Ive never known  
  
Have you seen my childhood  
Im searching for that wonder in my youth  
Like fantastical stories to share  
The dreams I would dare watch me fly  
  
Before you judge me try hard to love me  
The painful youth Ive had  
  
Have you seen my childhood
