Georgia sweet sweet Georgia keeps pulling on my ring  
Most men would give their right off or anything they own  
To have a woman just like you to be waitin when they come home  
But the devil made me cheat on you one too many times  
And honey Im sorry but she left heaven on my mind  
Georgia sweet Georgia keeps pulling on my ring  
I need her and I love her Lord shes a sweet and precious thing  
Her sweet and easy loving Lord beats all Ive ever seen  
Georgia sweet sweet Georgia keeps pulling on my ring  
I didnt wanna fall in love with anybody else  
But when I tasted heaven Lord I just couldnt help myself  
I pray someday that youll forget and forgive me for all these things  
I just cant seem to love you with Georgia pulling on my ring  
Georgia sweet Georgia
