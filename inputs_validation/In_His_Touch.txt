Forgive me  
Dont know where to start  
I guess weve come to  
The serious part  
I need to find out  
If theres a chance  
For us  
  
Dont give me that same old look  
It wont win me over  
Dont give me that same old speech  
You dont have to speak at all  
  
You can say you love me  
That Im your perfect crush  
How it hurts to need someone that much  
You can swear you mean it  
But that aint good enough  
cause when a man loves a woman it is all  
In his touch  
  
I wish you could you see yeah  
Just how simple  
Its supposed to be  
  
Cause now that weve come this far  
We dont want to loose it  
If you want to win my heart  
Baby just shut your mouth  
  
You can say you love me  
That Im your perfect crush  
How it hurts to need someone that much  
You can swear you mean it  
But that aint good enough  
Cause when a man loves a woman it is all  
In his touch  
  
Then words dont mean that much
