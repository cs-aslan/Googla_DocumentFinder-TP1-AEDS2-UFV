You may not show it  
I may not know it  
But its real as it can be  
You need no season  
I need no reason  
When its your heart singin  
This was meant to be  
  
When youre both in love  
Both in love  
Seein eye to eye and feelin  
Heart to heart  
Yes were both in love  
Both in love  
With each other from the start  
Evrythins magic  
When were together  
In this wonderland for two  
Theres nothing like it  
Wont try to hide it  
Anyone can tell theres nothin you can do  
  
Theres no need to worry  
Which starts were under  
Weve got all we need to know  
We have the answer  
Forever after  
Youre the one for me  
And Im the one for you
