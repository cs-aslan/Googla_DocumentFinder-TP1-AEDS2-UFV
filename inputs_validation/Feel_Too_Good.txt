Feel too good to go to work today  
I need a little more time so i can stay this way  
Lets go for a ride on the circle line  
Couldnt you use a day in the sunshine  
Mustnt let your bank payments get behind  
The bills may pile up i just brush them off my mind  
  
I cant let debt collectors bother me  
Because i feel too good  
I feel so good that you just cant bring me down  
  
I cant remember when i felt so high  
My mind is on vacation and i dont know why  
Wouldnt you like to go for a country drive  
Doesnt it make you feel good to be alive  
Luncheon by the roadside will do just fine  
I left the water running  
It just must have slipped my mind  
  
Cant let the little things bother me  
Because i feel too good  
I feel so good that you just cant bring me down  
Someones bound to bring you down  
  
Theres a strange speaking man on the front lawn  
Making rude noises and gestures  
Its just the neighbors got something on his mind  
Feel too good  
I cant let frenchie start to bother me  
Because i feel too good  
I feel so good that you just cant bring me down
