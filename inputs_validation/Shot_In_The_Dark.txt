Shot In The Dark Lyrics  
Everyday its the same old situation  
I face the same old line of empty faces  
Sit at my desk while the clock counts up my wages  
  
Pick up my pay every Friday and take off like a  
Shot in the dark  
I took off like a shot in the dark  
I split the scene like a shot in the dark  
  
Aint got no target dont aim for no mark  
Cause Im off like a shot in the dark  
It was only a game when we first started  
The novelty wore away and the fun departed  
  
I cant live up anymore to those things I spouted  
And if you say you feel the same way  
Ill be off like a  
Shot in the dark  
  
Theres no changes going down  
Theres no lesson to be found  
Makes no sense to hang around  
If thats all there is to that  
  
Thats what she said  
Someone just tossed a bomb through  
Kitchen window  
And in the middle of a shoofly pie  
  
Mama took off like a  
Bat out of hell  
She took off like a shot in the dark
