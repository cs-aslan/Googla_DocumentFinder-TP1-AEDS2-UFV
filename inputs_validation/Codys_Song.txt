When you feel afraid  
When you lose your way Ill find you  
Just try to smile and dry your eyes  
I will bring back the moon into your skies  
And ever you will remember darling Ill be there to  
  
Say to you  
Ill promise you  
Ill promise to  
Comfort you and say to you  
Darling Ill be there just for you  
  
Theres so much to learn  
And when you want me  
Then Ill show you  
And through the years  
Youll always be  
The lullaby in the heart of the child in me  
  
Whenever you will remember darling  
Ill be there to  
  
Say to you  
Ill promise you  
Ill promise to  
Comfort you and say to you  
Darling Ill be there just for you  
  
Hold it feel it  
Music is in your heart  
When you need it  
Just keep listening  
Let it sing let it sing  
  
Though youve grown away  
No matter how youll change  
Ill know you  
And when you tire of life alone  
There will always be one sure way back home  
  
Just turn on the quiet  
And you close your eyes  
And listen inside  
unconditional  
unconditional  
unconditional  
  
Ill be there to sing to you  
I promise you  
I promise to  
Comfort you  
And sing to you  
  
And darling Ill be there  
Anytime and anywhere  
Cody Ill be there just for you
