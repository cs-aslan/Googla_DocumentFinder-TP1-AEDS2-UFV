When you hit your note  
Its like you had no choice  
I cant resist distractions web  
When you use that voice  
On a crowded stage  
I play soliloquy  
Im at the center of the earth  
When you gaze on me  
The familiar ring of the native drums  
Sometimes I hardly recognize it  
Inspiration comes  
With the tip of my mind  
Holding back the sea  
I have no choice but to prevail  
When you gaze on me  
Ive got the ghost of a new machine  
Where I can find reality routine  
Every time you fix your gaze on me  
When you gaze on me  
I feel a ring of fire  
When you gaze on me  
And I lose all desire  
Fix your heart on me  
Ill show you what Ive memorized  
Fix your gaze on me  
I need to see your eyes uh  good god  
Out in the cold the assassin waits  
Armored by love no sword can penetrate  
Every time you fix your heart on me  
Im a new machine  
Where I can find reality routine  
Every time you fix your gaze on me
