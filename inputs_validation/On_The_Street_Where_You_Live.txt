I have often walked down this street before  
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before  
All at once am I several stories high  
Knowing Im on the street where you live  
  
Are there lilac trees in the heart of town  
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town  
Does enchantment pour out of every door  
No its just on the street where you live  
  
And oh the towering feeling just to know somehow you are near  
The overpowering feeling that any second you may suddenly appear  
  
People stop and stare they dont bother me  
For theres nowhere else on earth that I would rather be  
Let the time go by I wont care if I  
Can be here on the street where you live
