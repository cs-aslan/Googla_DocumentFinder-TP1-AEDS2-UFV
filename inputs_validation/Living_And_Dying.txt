In the dirty old city  
There is my home  
Theres my home theres my home  
There is my home  
  
Nothing really looks pretty  
And Ive been alone  
Ive been alone Ive been alone  
Ive been alone  
  
And in my heart  
Many wishes are crying  
Living and dying  
  
And in my heart  
Many wishes are crying  
Living and dying  
  
In the house of darkness  
Theres a magic stone  
Magic stone magic stone  
The magic stone  
  
But I couldnt find it  
Cause the shine is gone  
Shine is gone shine is gone  
The shine is gone  
  
And in my heart  
Many wishes are crying  
Living and dying  
  
And in my heart  
Many wishes are crying  
Living and dying  
  
Living and dying  
Living and dying
