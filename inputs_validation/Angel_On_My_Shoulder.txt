I never thought Id ever make it I cant believe the hell Ive been through  
Couldnt see the light at the end of the tunnel I didnt know what to do  
Ive been through the rain Ive been through the fire  
There was something that I never knew  
  
Chorus  
I had an angel on my shoulder with a plan for me divine  
Must be an angel on my shoulder who was right there all the time  
Angel must be an angel This world can be so cold and so heartless  
  
Its hard to find your way alone I used to run so fast no one could catch me  
I couldnt find the way back home but Ive laughed Ive cried  
I almost died but my broken heart just never knew  
Chorus  
  
I had an angel on my shoulder with a plan for me divine  
Got to be an angel on my shoulder who was right there  
Right there all the time everybody needs someone to cling to  
With an unchanging love I finally found a hand to hold on to  
A shelter to run to now I see Hes watching over me  
  
Chorus  
  
Angel on my shoulder angel Ive got an angel on my shoulder  
Angel on my shoulder with a plan for me divine  
Got to be an angel on my shoulder angel on my shoulder  
Who was right there right there right there all the time  
Got to be an angel an angel an angel right there all the time
