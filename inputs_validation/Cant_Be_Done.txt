Everywhere I dare to go the corners that I turn  
Im sure to see a face I know someone who doesnt earn  
Thats all I ever get to hear is other peoples woe  
Lets climb into a rocket and well press the one and go  
Although they say it cant be done  
Dont say to me it cant be done  
Looking how we used to be the way and what we wore  
The things we hoped that future held but always wanted more  
If God had meant for man to fly he would have given wings  
He didnt so we have to make the best of everything  
So lets not say it cant be done  
Although they say it cant be done  
Dont say to me everybody says it cant be done  
That there aint no chance at all  
Anybody can be right or wrong  
When there aint no chance at all  
Half the world is in a mess the other half as well  
Ive got a feelin strange to me I wish that I could tell  
It wont be long before we push the button I am sure  
So throw away the key when I am locked behind the door  
Youre telling me it cant be done  
Stop telling me it cant be done  
Dont say to me everybody says it cant be done  
That there aint no chance at all  
Anybody can be right or wrong  
When there aint no chance at all  
Half the world is in a mess the other half as well  
Ive got a feelin strange to me I wish that I could tell  
It wont be long before we push the button I am sure  
So throw away the key when I am locked behind the door  
Youre telling me it cant be done  
Stop telling me it cant be done  
Lets pray and pray it can be done  
Just pray and pray it can be done  
It can be done  
It can be done  
It can be done  
It can be done
