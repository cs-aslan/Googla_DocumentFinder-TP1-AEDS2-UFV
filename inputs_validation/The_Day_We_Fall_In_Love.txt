Therell be birds singin everywhere  
And the wind will be blowin through your hair  
Ill look in your eyes  
And wait for the prize  
Your lips kissing mine  
With a love that is real  
And youll look so young and fair  
  
On the day we fall in love  
You and me  
On the day we fall in love  
Youll see  
  
Therell be rainbows reachin cross the sky  
And well both be so happy we will cry  
Well walk hand in hand  
In snow or in sand  
Whether roses are blooming  
Or snowmen stand by  
Time will stop for you and I  
  
On the day we fall in love  
It will be on the day we fall in love  
Youll see  
  
And if the lines that I say fall apart  
Its because I wont know where to start  
But youll understand when I say them to you  
Cause theyll come straight from my heart  
  
On the day we fall in love  
You and me  
On the day we fall in love  
Youll see  
Youll see
