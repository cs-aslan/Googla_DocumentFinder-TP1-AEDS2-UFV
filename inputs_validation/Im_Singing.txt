Only one name lasts forever  
Only one fame stands alone  
Only one King has an anthem  
That goes on and on and on  
  
And Im singing to the God  
Who brings redemption to the nations  
Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise  
  
And Im singing to the God  
Who wrote the book on our salvation  
To the One who covers me in grace  
Im singing  
  
Only one word in the beginning  
Only one truth will prevail  
Only one love brings a freedom  
Only one Man took the nails  
  
And Im singing to the God  
Who brings redemption to the nations  
Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise  
  
And Im singing to the God  
Who wrote the book on our salvation  
To the One who covers me in grace  
Im singing  
  
Praise praise to the Savior  
Praise to the Lamb of God  
Praise in all of His splendor  
Praise for saving my life  
  
And Im singing to the God  
Who brings redemption to the nations  
Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise  
  
And Im singing to the God  
Who wrote the book on our salvation  
To the One who covers me in grace  
  
And Im singing to the God  
Who brings redemption to the nations  
Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise  
  
And Im singing to the God  
Who wrote the book on our salvation  
To the One who covers me in grace  
To the One who covers me in grace  
Im singing Im singing Im singing Im singing
