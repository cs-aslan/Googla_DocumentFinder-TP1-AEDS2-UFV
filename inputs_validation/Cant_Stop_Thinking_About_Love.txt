Hey yeah yeah  
Day and night youve always on my mind  
A love like ours was very hard to find  
But now your love has been taken away  
What can I do to make you stay  
Days go by but still so much more tears to cry  
So far apart left me with this lonely broken heart  
  
Chorus  
Baby I cant stop thinking about love tonight  
Cant even tell you whats wrong or right  
I need you here to love me for the rest of my life  
Dont you know how much loving I have for you  
When youre not around my heart breaks in two  
Baby I cant stop thinking about love tonight  
Cant stop thinking bout you  
  
To love is what I do best  
Youll always be better than the rest  
It wont be easy finding someone new  
Coz theres no other one like you  
The night goes on and I still think of you from dusk till dawn  
I love you so dont know how Im ever gonna let you  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Baby I hope you know I love you  
With all my heart and soul  
If you open your eyes look into my heart  
Youll see the love in store for you  
  
Instrumental  
Repeat Chorus till it fades
