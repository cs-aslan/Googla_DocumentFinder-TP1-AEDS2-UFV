Dont forget to turn on the light  
Dont laugh babe itll be alright  
dom do aaah Pour me out another phone

Perhaps the strange ones in the dome  
Can lend us a book we can read up alone  
  
And try to get it on like once before  
When people stared in Jaggers eyes and scored  
Like the video films we saw  
  
His name was always buddy got got do aaah aah aah  
And hed shrug and ask to stay  
Shed sigh like twig the wonder kid got got do aaah  
And turn her face away  
  
Shes uncertain if she likes him got got do aaah aah aah  
But she knows she really loves him  
Its a crash course for the ravers got got do aaah  
Its a drivein Saturday  
  
Jung the foreman prayed at work dom do aaah  
Neither hands nor limbs would burst  
Its hard enough to keep formation with this fall out saturation  
  
bah dom bah cursing at the astronette  
dom do aaah who stands in steel by his cabinet  
Hes crashing out with Sylvian  
The bureau supply for aging men  
With snorting head he gazes to the shore  
Once had raised a sea that raged no more  
Like the video films we saw  
  
His name was always buddy got got do aaah aah aah  
And hed shrug and ask to stay  
Shed sigh like twig the wonder kid got got do aaah  
And turn her face away  
  
Shes uncertain if she likes him got got do aaah aah aah  
But she knows she really loves him  
Its a crash course for the ravers got got do aaah  
Its a drivein Saturday  
  
His name was always buddy got got do aaah aah aah
