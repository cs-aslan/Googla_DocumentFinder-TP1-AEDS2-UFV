Listen to the rain afallin  
Cant you hear that lonesome sound  
Oh my poor old heart is breakin  
Cause my sweet love aint round  
Lord I think Ill start to ramble  
Got to leave this weary town  
This old place is way too lonely  
Cause my sweet love aint around  
On that train tonight Im leavin  
And dont ask me where Im bound  
I cant stay here any longer  
Cause my sweet love aint around
