Roaming souls  
Prisoners of the bottomless pit  
Tempting us  
To be tortured in the everlasting fire  
They are trying  
To penetrate into your  
Religious ones  
Protected by the words of Christ  
Militant atheists  
Destroying the ones that are unsafe  
With evil powers  
They are pestilenting  
The human race  
They are trying  
To penetrate  
Into your faith  
CHORUS  
Spirits of damnation  
Who wander throughout the world  
Trying to destroy us before Armageddon  
For the ruin of our souls  
Beware the Antichrist will be here  
To exterminate our religion each year  
Because he knows the Son of Man is near  
Dont be afraid Jesus Christ will be here  
The end is near  
Lets all beware  
Of the prophecies  
Deads and alives shall be judged  
By all holy forces  
Sinners will be Satans wrath  
For a thousand years they will regret  
Its coming so lets all be aware  
Theyre trying  
To penetrate  
Into your faith  
CHORUS  
Spirits of damnation  
Who wander throughout the world  
Trying to destroy us before Armageddon  
For the ruin of our souls
