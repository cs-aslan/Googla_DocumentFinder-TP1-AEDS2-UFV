Youve seen him leaning on the streetlight  
Listening to some song inside  
Youve seen him standing by the highway  
Trying to hitch a ride  
  
Well they tried so hard to hold him  
Heaven knows how hard they tried  
But hes made up his mind  
Hes the restless kind  
  
Hes the wild age  
Hes the wild age  
Hes the wild age  
Wild age  
Its the wild age  
And the law cant stop em  
No one can stop em  
At the wild age  
  
Mostly when the reckless years end  
Somethings left to save  
Some of them keep running  
Til they run straight in their graves  
To stay the wild age  
Stay the wild age  
Stay the wild age  
Wild age
