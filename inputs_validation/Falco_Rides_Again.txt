These are the given lyrics for this song but to my ears  
Most of the first verse sounds to me to be in German  
This is the story of a lonely man  
Whos seen the world  
From japan to Afghanistan  
Hey ho  
  
Everybody thought that I was gone for good  
But Im back understood  
Hey ho  
  
Ive been through the snow and the storm  
Felt the cold  
No one to keep me warm  
Agony and pain  
  
Falco rides again bang bang  
I wont break  
I wont bend  
Falco rides again  
Its me and my gang  
I came back just like a boomerang  
Ill fight till the end  
Falco rides again  
Ive been up Ive been down  
Ive been pushed around  
Beated mistreated  
Gagged and bound  
Hey ho  
  
Not a soul in the world thought I would survive  
Took every muscle in my body to stay alive  
Hey ho  
Ill break down the walls  
No more defeat  
I want the taste of victory  
Revenge is sweet  
  
Rides again
