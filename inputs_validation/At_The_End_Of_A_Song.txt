They tell me  
Somewhere this life isnt crazy  
But Ive traveled the world far and wide  
And I say theyre wrong  
  
Dont sell me  
Stories that musics a lady  
Its not when the singers alone  
At the end of a song  
  
Chorus  
At the end of a song  
Theres no one  
After the last note is played  
Only the memory stays  
Then even that fades away  
And theres nothing so hard  
As convincing your heart  
That you should start singing again  
  
You told me  
Nothing could change perfect lovers  
But like every promise you made  
It broke before long  
  
Its lonely  
Falling away from each other  
But weve come to the last of your words  
And the end of a song  
  
Chorus
