I used to spend my nights out  
In a bar room  
Liquor was the only love Id known  
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom  
Brought me back from being too far gone  
Youre as smooth as Tennesee whiskey  
Youre as sweet as strawberry wine  
Youre as warm as a glass of Brandy  
And I stay stoned on your love all the time  
I looked for love  
In all the same old places  
Found the bottom of the bottles  
Always dry  
But when you poured out your heart  
I didnt waste it  
Cause theres nothing like your love  
To get me high  
Youre as smooth as Tennesee whiskey  
Youre as sweet as strawberry wine  
Youre as warm as a glass of Brandy  
And I stay stoned on your love all the time  
I stay stoned on your love all the time
