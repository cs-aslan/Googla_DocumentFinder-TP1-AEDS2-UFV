I woke up this afternoon and looked into your eyes  
And somethin was as wrong as if the sun forgot to rise  
I picked up a road map and I checked a few good places that I know  
And if youre no longer givin I believe Ill hit the road and go  
  
I just got the feelin that the fire was burnin out  
Cause the air was turnin colder every time you came about  
And a flame wont take a fannin if the last reserve of love is runnin low  
So since Ive gotta button up I believe Ill hit the road and go  
  
County road 640 State Highway 45  
Life out of the interstate is very much alive  
Theres magic in the mountains and music in the valleys down below  
And my song aint through playin yet so I believe Ill hit the road and go  
  
Good morning to you sunshine good morning to you rain  
The windshield wipers rhythm keeps me singin down the pain  
Today Im gonna miss you less if I miss you at all  
Youll never know youll never know  
This rambler has cut all the ties and pulled up stakes to hit the road and go  
This rambler has cut all the ties and pulled up stakes to hit the road and go
