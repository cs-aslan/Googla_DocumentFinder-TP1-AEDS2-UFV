If I cant be a happy man I wont be no one at all  
If I cant be just who I am I wont let you come to  
call  
I was all right before I walked through the door  
I was all right outside but inside I had to cry  
  
Low today and high tomorrow I see that its real  
One mans meats another mans sorrow do you know how  
it feels  
To be dead drunk on the floor  
To get up and ask for more  
To be lying in the dark crying  
  
If I cant be a peaceful man I will be who I can  
If I cant get everything I want Ill just get what I  
can  
I was alright before I walked out the door  
I was alright inside  
  
But outside I had to look again again again  
  
A love  
Love again  
A love supreme divine  
Anyway that you want it to be  
Love Its love its love  
Love Love Love  
A love supreme a love supreme  
A love supreme a love supreme  
  
Make no mistake  
Make no mistake its love  
Make no mistake its love  
Make no mistake its love  
  
Divine its love its fine its wine its time its  
love  
Love Love Love  
Make no mistake its love  
Make no mistake its love  
  
Make no mistake its love  
Its love Its love love
