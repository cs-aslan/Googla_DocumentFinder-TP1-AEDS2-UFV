On a quiet summer day long ago and far away  
Two tiny tots their game of play did end  
As they gazed into the sky where the lazy clouds go by  
The little girl said lets just play pretend  
  
Chorus  
Lets pretend those clouds are islands in the sky  
And lets pretend that were up there just you and I  
Lets pretend that no one knew where to find us in the blue  
Lets pretend our dreams come true as years go by  
  
Now today as long years fly  
Do they wander side by side  
And do their dreams into the future wind  
Do they still recall the day when she turned to him to say  
Darling take my hand and lets pretend  
  
Chorus  
Lets pretend those clouds are islands in the sky  
And lets pretend that were up there just you and I  
Lets pretend that no one knew where to find us in the blue  
Lets pretend our dreams come true as years go by
