Time is my friend  
Till it aint and runs out  
And that is all that I have  
Till its gone  
  
Tried to build on bones of birds  
Singing in the cold and fall to earth  
  
Hey Sometimes she wont cry  
When the smallest one is trapped  
Too weak to survive  
Probably maybe  
  
Tried to look out  
Through a hole in the vague  
Circle above looking down  
Bird of prey  
  
Tried to build on bones of birds  
Singing in the cold and fall to earth  
  
Hey Sometimes she wont cry  
When the smallest one is trapped  
Too weak to survive Too weak to survive  
Too weak to survive  
Probably maybe
