Well September comes around like an old familiar friend  
So I take off to Central Park to watch those falling leaves again  
And in the arbors of Strawberry Fields in a night as bright as day  
I look up at the sky and wish I could fly away  
And I say I know this life wont last forever  
But wherever you go these days  
Im with you all the way  
And I say I know your time and mine together  
Is more than I could understand  
But I promise you Ill always be your man  
And so I watch those falling leaves until the winter kicks in good  
Until I reach the same conclusion we never say the things we should  
Youre with me all the time it seems yeah these days Im not alone  
I cant explain the things Im going through its you not me thats flown
away  
And I say I know this time wont last forever  
But wherever you go these days  
Im with you all the way  
And I say I know your time and mine together  
Is more than I could understand  
But I promise you Ill always be your man  
And time has put us through some heavy changes  
And I say I still care about you and I know what loves for  
And Ill be right here waiting for you every day  
To come in laughing through that door  
Look up at the towers through the falling snow  
Its hard to tell what youve been going through  
Because Im a stranger now in your world  
And I say I know this world wont last forever  
But wherever you go these days  
Im with you all the way  
And I say I know your time and mine together  
Is more than I could understand  
But I promise you Ill always be your man  
Day in day out I have no doubt  
Ill always be your man
