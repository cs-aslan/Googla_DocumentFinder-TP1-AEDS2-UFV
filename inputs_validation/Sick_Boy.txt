Well Im searching through my bed  
I got ankles in my head  
Im in really bad  
Its the best time I ever had  
Im a sick boy  
Im a sick boy  there should be more  
Well Im happy the way I am  
A sardine in a can  
People taking notes  
People in white coats  
Im a sick boy  
Im a sick boy  there should be more  
Well Im happy the way I am  
And Im sorry I shit on my hand  
People taking notes  
People in rubber coats  
Im a sick boy  
Just a sick boy  
Im a sick boy  
Theres assholes everywhere  
Plus girls with big town hair  
But why must I suffer  
For being a fecal lover  
Im a shit boy  
Im a snit boy  there should be more
