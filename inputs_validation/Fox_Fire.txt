Caught in the middle of a moonbeam oh a flicker of light  
I took a look and then it run away back on into the night  
Oh stopped stopped tickin of my heartbeat a look in his eye  
Had the hunger of a mountain lion and the thunder in fire  
  
And every time he appears it comes as a surprise  
And he thinks hes clever as fox fire dancin on a distant rise  
Then when I catch that devil ooh there gonna be a slow down  
There gonna be a mighty slow down yeah  
  
Caught in the embers of my night fire in the cracklin and glow  
I get the feeling hes awatching me somewhere there in the cold  
  
And one of these days Im thinking Ill take him by surprise  
Hes not so clever as fox fire dancing on a distant rise  
And when I catch that devil there gonna be a slow down  
There gonna be a mighty slow down
