Cotton candy two for a quarter  
See if the fat man can guess your weight  
A big stuffed tiger is what I bought her  
And Im going home cause its late  
  
Roller coasters make me dizzy  
And cotton candy makes me sick  
I wish I had some Bromo fizzy  
Now that would do the trick  
  
Everyone knows that the clowns arent happy  
And everyone knows that the people dont care  
I wish I could laugh at the way that theyre acting  
But Im so sick I just dont dare to  
  
High wire dancers kick and balance  
White silk horses step in time  
The tattooed man displays his talents  
Im not the talented kind  
  
I always go to the circus on Sunday  
And there I can laugh at the people I see  
But when I leave home in the morning on Monday  
Everybody laughs at me  
  
I make other people nervous  
I guess thats why they laugh at me  
But to me my life is a threering circus  
And I can see it for free  
  
Have you seen my wife Elvira  
She can tame a lion you know  
Well I once had a bushy mane  
But that was so damn long ago  
  
Tightcollared clowns in plastic buildings  
Have happy families as their fate  
Happy jobs and happy clubs  
And happy people they hate  
  
Everyones juggling and everyones acting  
With smiles of grease paint three feet wide  
Everyones caught on a carousel pony  
And one time around is a lifetime ride
