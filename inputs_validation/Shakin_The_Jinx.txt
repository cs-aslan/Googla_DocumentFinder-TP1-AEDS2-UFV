Its just too easy to hide in these trees  
Rust in this water up to your knees  
Not many dreamers ever get out alive  
Some kind of sickness sleeps in this town  
I barely got out but so many drown  
The more you struggle  
The faster youre gonna sink  
Youre shakin youre shakin the jinx  
Youre beating the odds by the skin of your teeth  
Baby baby its a long way down  
They want to be there when you hit the ground  
You gotta shake it right in their face and smile  
And when youve got em right in the palm of your hand  
You dont need em cause you understand  
So you turn slowly and you give the boys one last wink  
And then  
Youre shakin youre shakin the jinx  
Youre beating the odds by the skin of your teeth  
  
You gotta face the fools who put sand in the gears  
You gotta shake a fist at a thousand different fears  
You gotta break it fake it  
But never let em know what you think  
While  
Youre shakin youre shakin the jinx  
Youre beating the odds by the skin of your teeth
