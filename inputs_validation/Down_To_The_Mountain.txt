it doing something to see you day by day Everything changes when I come in
your places

Cause it down to the mountain and I can see you there hoping for sweet smile
and dont know what to do I cant tell you about it because you have love
someone that you love more than me But someday you will love me

Cause it down to the mountain you make me smile I go and find another like you
cause down to the mountain you make me fall for you everyday  
Cause down to the mountain you make me smile
