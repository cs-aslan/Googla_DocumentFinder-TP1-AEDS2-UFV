Baby your eyes have that look  
And baby I put down my book  
And maybe we wont be disturbed  
By a thing  
  
Let it ring let it ring let it ring  
  
Oh baby Ive got you alone  
And baby Im not made of stone  
And maybe we wont be disturned  
By a thing this is too much  
  
Let it ring let it ring let it ring  
  
Doesnt matter whos on the line  
When your lips are so close to mine  
Dont let anybody intrude on this mood  
Were incommunicado  
  
Baby if someone should call  
Ignore it do nothing at all  
Just kiss me who knows what  
This moment may bring  
  
Just let it ring let it ring  
Oh let it ring
