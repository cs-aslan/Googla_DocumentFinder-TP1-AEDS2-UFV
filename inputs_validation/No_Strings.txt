I wake up every morning with a smile on my face  
Everything in its place as it should be  
I start out every morning just as free as the breeze  
My cares upon the shelf  
Because I find myself with  
  
No strings and no connections  
No ties to my affections  
Im fancy free and free for anything fancy  
  
No dates that cant be broken  
No words that cant be spoken  
Especially when I am feeling romancy  
  
Like a robin upon a tree  
Like a sailor that goes to sea  
Like an unwritten melody  
Im free thats me  
  
So  
  
Bring on the big attraction  
My decks are cleared for action  
Im fancy free and free for anything fancy
