Close enough to start a war  
All that I have is on the floor  
God only knows what were fighting for  
All that I say you always say more  
  
I cant keep up with your turning tables  
Under your thumb I cant breathe  
  
So I wont let you close enough to hurt me  
No I wont ask you you to just desert me  
I cant give you what you think you gave me  
Its time to say goodbye to turning tables  
To turning tables  
  
Under haunted skies I see you  
Where love is lost your ghost is found  
I braved a hundred storms to leave you  
As hard as you try no I will never be knocked down  
  
I cant keep up with your turning tables  
Under your thumb I cant breathe  
  
So I wont let you close enough to hurt me no  
I wont ask you you to just desert me  
I cant give you what you think you gave me  
Its time to say goodbye to turning tables  
Turning tables  
  
Next time Ill be braver  
Ill be my own savior  
When the thunder calls for me  
Next time Ill be braver  
Ill be my own savior  
Standing on my own two feet  
  
I wont let you close enough to hurt me no  
I wont ask you you to just desert me  
I cant give you what you think you gave me  
Its time to say goodbye to turning tables  
To turning tables  
Turning tables yeah  
Turning oh
