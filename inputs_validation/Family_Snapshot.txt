The streets are lined with camera crews  
Everywhere he goes is news  
Today is different  
Today is not the same  
Today I make the action  
Take snapshot into the light snapshot into the light  
Im shooting into the light  
  
Four miles down the cavalcade moves on  
Driving into the sun  
If I worked it out right  
They wont see me or the gun  
  
Two miles to go theyre clearing the road  
The cheering has really begun  
Ive got my radio  
I can hear whats going on  
  
Ive been waiting for this  
I have been waiting for this  
All you people in TV land  
I will wake up your empty shells  
Peaktime viewing blown in a flash  
As I burn into your memory cells  
cause Im alive  
  
Theyre coming round the corner with the bikers at the front  
Im wiping the sweat from my eyes  
Its a matter of time  
Its a matter of will  
And the governors car is not far behind  
Hes not the one Ive got in mind  
cause there he isthe man of the hour standing in the limousine  
I dont really hate you  
I dont care what you do  
We were made for each other  
Me and you  
I want to be somebody  
You were like that too  
If you dont get given you learn to take  
And I will take you  
  
Holding my breath  
Release the catch  
And I let the bullet fly  
  
All turned quiet I have been here before  
Lonely boy hiding behind the front door  
Friends have all gone home  
Theres my toy gun on the floor  
Come back Mum and Dad  
Youre growing apart  
You know that Im growing up sad  
I need some attention  
I shoot into the light
