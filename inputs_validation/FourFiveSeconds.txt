Verse 1 Rihanna  
I think Ive had enough  
I might get a little drunk  
I say whats on my mind  
I might do a little time  
Cause all of my kindness  
Is taken for weakness  
  
Chorus Rihanna  
Now Im FourFiveSeconds from wildin  
And we got three more days til Friday  
Im just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin  
I swear I wish somebody would tell me  
Ooh thats all I want  
  
Verse 2 Kanye West  
Woke up an optimist  
Sun was shining Im positive  
Then I heard you was talkin trash  
Hold me back Im bout to spaz  
  
Chorus Rihanna and Kanye West  
Yeah bout FourFiveSeconds from wildin  
And we got three more days til Friday  
Im just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin  
I swear I wish somebody would try me  
Ooh thats all I want  
  
Bridge Rihanna  
And I know that youre up tonight  
Thinkin how could I be so selfish  
But you called bout a thousand times  
Wondering where I been  
Now I know that your up tonight  
Thinkin how could I be so reckless  
But I just cant apologize  
I hope you can understand  
  
Bridge Kanye West  
If I go to jail tonight  
Promise youll pay my bail  
See they want to buy my pride  
But that just aint up for sale  
See all of my kindness  
Is taken for weakness  
  
Chorus Rihanna and Kanye West  
Now Im FourFiveSeconds from wildin  
And we got three more days til Friday  
Im just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin  
I swear I wish somebody would tell me  
Ooh thats all I want  
  
Chorus Rihanna and Kanye West  
FourFiveSeconds from wildin  
And we got three more days til Friday  
Just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin  
I swear I wish somebody would tell me  
Ooh thats all I want
