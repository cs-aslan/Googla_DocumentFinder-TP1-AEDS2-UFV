Baby please try to forgive me  
Stay here dont put out the glow  
Hold me now dont bother  
If every minute it makes me weaker  
You can save me from the man that Ive become  
oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
Looking back on the things Ive done  
I was trying to be someone  
Played my part kept you in the dark  
Now let me show you the shape of my heart  
  
Sadness is beautiful  
Loneliness is tragical  
So help me I cant win this war  
oh no  
Touch me now dont bother  
If every second it makes me weaker  
You can save me from the man Ive become  
  
Chorus  
  
Im here with my confession  
Got nothing to hide no more  
I dont know where to start  
But to show you the shape of my heart  
  
Im looking back on things Ive done  
I never want to play the same old part  
Keep you in the dark  
Now let me show you the shape of my heart  
  
Looking back on the things Ive done  
I was trying to be someone trying to be someone  
Played my part kept you in the dark  
Now let me show you the shape of my heart Now let me show you the true shape
of my heart  
  
Chorus  
  
Show you the shape of my heart
