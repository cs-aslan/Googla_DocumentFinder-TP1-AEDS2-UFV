He was a most peculiar man  
Thats what Mrs Reardon says  
And she should know  
She lived upstairs from him  
She said he was a most peculiar man  
He was a most peculiar man  
He lived all alone within a house  
Within a room within himself  
A most peculiar man  
He had no friends he seldom spoke  
And no one in turn ever spoke to him  
Cause he wasnt friendly and he didnt  
Care  
And he wasnt like them  
O nooo  
He was a most peculiar man  
He died last Saturday  
He turned on the gas and he went to sleep  
With the windows closed  
So hed never wake up  
To his silent world  
And his tiny room  
And Mrs Reardon says he has a brother somewhere  
Who should be notified sooooon  
And all the people said  
What a shame that hes dead  
But wasnt he a most peculiar man
