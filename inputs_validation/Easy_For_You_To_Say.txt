I heard some talk around this town  
Talk about you and me  
How a fool fell out of love with you  
Wanted to be free  
  
Well thats easy for you to say  
That I dont know what Im doing  
That Ive thrown our love away  
And left my life in ruin  
Thats easy for you to say  
  
I read your letter again  
Im sure you know the one  
Goodbye you said like a coward  
Itll be better in the long run  
  
Well thats easy for you to say  
That I dont know what Im doing  
That Ive thrown our love away  
Left my life in ruin  
Thats easy for you to say  
  
Go back to her again  
Back to the way you were  
Shes a damn sight better for you  
Youre a damn sight better for her  
  
Well thats easy for you to say  
That I dont know what Im doing  
When youve thrown our love away  
Left my life in ruin  
Thats easy for you to say
