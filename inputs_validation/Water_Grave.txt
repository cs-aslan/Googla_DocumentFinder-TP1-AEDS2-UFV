In my house theres been a mercy killing  
The man I used to be has been crucified  
And the death of this man was the final way of revealing  
In the spiritual way to live I had to die  
Now if I let that dead man linger in me  
I might get a little idol in my way  
So Im going down to the celebration river  
And take this dead man down to a water grave  
  
Chorus  
Im goin down to the river  
And Im gonna be buried alive  
I want to show my Heavenly Father  
The man I use to be has finally died  
  
Now when I think of where Im goin  
In terms of where Ive been  
It makes me glad to know my Lord that Ive been born again  
Now when I think of where Im goin  
In terms of where Ive been  
It makes me glad to know my Lord that Ive been born again  
  
Chorus
