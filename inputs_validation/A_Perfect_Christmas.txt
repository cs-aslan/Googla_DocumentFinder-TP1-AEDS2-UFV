My idea of a perfect Christmas  
Is to spend it with you  
In a party or dinner for two  
Anywhere would do  
Celebrating the yuletide season  
Always lights up our lives  
Simple pleasures are made special too  
When theyre shared with you  
  
Looking through some old photographs  
Faces and friends well always remember  
Watching busy shoppers rushing about  
In the cool breeze of December  
Sparkling lights all over town  
Childrens carols in the air  
By the Christmas tree  
A shower of stardust on your hair  
  
I cant think of a better Christmas  
Than my wish coming true  
And my wish is that youd let me spend  
My whole life with you
