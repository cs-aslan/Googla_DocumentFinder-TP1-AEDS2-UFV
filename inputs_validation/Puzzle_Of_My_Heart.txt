Its the way she fills my senses  
Its the perfume that she wears  
I feel Im losing my defenses  
To the color of your hair  
  
And every little piece of her is right  
Just thinking about her takes me through the night  
  
Chorus  
Every time we meet the picture is complete  
Every time we touch the feeling is too much  
Shes all I ever need to fall in love again  
I knew it from the very start  
Shes the puzzle of my heart  
  
Its the way shes always smiling  
That makes people think she never cries  
Feel like Im losing my defenses  
To the color of her eyes  
  
And every little piece of her is right  
  
Chorus  
  
Like a miracle should meant to be  
She became the light inside of me  
Like a feeling like a memory from long ago  
  
Chorus
