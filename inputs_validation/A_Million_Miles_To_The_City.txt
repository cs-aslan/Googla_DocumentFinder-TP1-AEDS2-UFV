Yeah I remember it now we were kids back then livin down on the farm  
We were told that the city could only bring us harm  
How far is the city somebody said and oh thats a great big town  
Barbara said why its a million miles and the story got around  
  
Chorus  
Its a million miles to the city  
From the hills and valleys we know  
Its a million miles to the city  
And someday we all want to go  
  
There was a town nearby but a town is a town and a citywell thats  
Something else  
Our daddy had been to a city but he never was much help  
  
Why the buildings are taller than oak trees ah but we knew better than
that  
Aint nobody could climb that high the cities were wide and flat  
  
Chorus  
Well now time has passed and we have grown and traveled far and wide  
The cities have changed the kids we were we see it in each others eyes  
But Id love to go back to those hills again to the boy I used to be  
Where the leaves and the wind and the whippoorwills were part of the land like
me  
  
Chorus x2
