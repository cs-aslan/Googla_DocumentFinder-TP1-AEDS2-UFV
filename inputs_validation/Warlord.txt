When you see me comin flying down the road  
You know I aint afraid to lay it down  
Yea got me some leather Leather is my skin  
Black n chrome flashin through the town  
Some call me the WARLORD cause Im a GODDAMN  
bad machine young n hungry not too proud n mean  
  
Ride ride ride Im the WARLORD of the road  
Riding riding riding aint never growin old  
  
Take what I want and I go where I please  
Got the world right by the balls This world aint  
big enough to keep me down Yea were livin  
in a sick world The man on the TV said we  
got lotsa trouble overseas well what the hell  
do I care Think they care about me  
Stop sending money send em all a bomb  
  
Ride ride ride Im the WARLORD of the road  
Ridin ridin ridin aint never growin old  
  
Born to live in the fast lane on a chopped up  
HarleyD smell that oil and high test gasoline  
Never got a shortage of girls to share my seat  
Well they all want to know what people say is true  
You know get a biker started n hell drive all  
damn night Well hold on honey cause this rides  
for a ride  
  
Ride ride ride ride ride ride ride  
Im the WARLORD of the road  
Riding ridin ridin aint never growin old
