Dear  
How are things in your little world I hope theyre going well and you are
too  
Do you still see the same old crowd the ones who used to meet every Friday  
Im really sorry that I cant be there but work comes first Im sure youll
understand  
Things are really taking off for me business is thriving and Im showing a
profit and  
And in any case it wouldnt be the same cause weve all grown up and weve
got our lives  
And the values that we had once upon a time seem stupid now cause the rent
must be paid  
And some bonds severed and others made  
  
Now I dont want you to get me wrong ideals are fine when you are young and I
must admit  
We had a laugh but thats all it was and ever will be cause the burning sky
keeps  
Burning bright and as long as it does and it always will theres no time
for dreams  
When commerce calls and the taxmans shouting cause he wants his dough and the
wheels of  
Finance wont begin to slow  
  
And its only us realists who are gonna come through cause theres only one
power higher  
Than that of truth and thats the burning sky  
  
Oh and by the way I must tell you before I sign off that Ive got a meeting
next week  
With the head of a big corporate I cant disclose who but Im sure youll know
it and  
And the burning sky keeps burning bright and it wont turn off til its had
enough  
Its the greedy bastard who wont give up and youre just a dreamer if you
dont realize  
And the sooner you do will be the better for you then well all be happy and
well all be  
Wise and all bow down to the burning sky  
  
Then well all be happy and well all be wise and together we will live beneath
the  
Burning sky
