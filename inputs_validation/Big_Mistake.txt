Theres no sign on the gate  
and theres mud on your face  
Dont ya think its time we reinvestigate this situation  
Put some fruit on your plate  
Youve forgotten how it started  
Close your eyes  
think of all the bubbles of love we made  
and youre down on your knees  
its too late  
Oh dont come crawlin  
and you lie by my feet  
what a big mistake  
I see you fallin  
got a buzz in my head  
and my flowers are dead  
Cant figure out a way to rectify this situation  
I dont believe what you said  
you forgotten how it started  
Close your eyes  
think of all the bubbles of love we made  
and youre down on your knees  
its too late  
Oh dont come crawlin  
and you lie by my feet  
what a big mistake  
I see you fallin  
I could sting like a bee  
Careful how you treat me  
baby I dont think Ill accept your sorry invitation  
Close the door as you leave  
and you cry over me  
I cant wait  
I feel you stallin  
and you try to reach me  
What a big mistake  
I hear you calling  
Chorus
