Have you Fuck up from the last time  
You think you got everyone figured out  
We are leavin in a glass house  
Cause everything is shadowing all around  
Now tell me what you mad about  
Im tired of developing nonsense  
And if you were to leave me now  
I probably do nothing to stop it  
  
I wont be missing you anymore  
Missing you anymore  
Missing you anymore  
Missing you anymore  
Missing you anymore  
Touch you little more  
Not love you anymore  
Is That what you really want  
Is That what you really want  
  
Have you Fuck up from the last time  
You think you got everyone figured out  
We are leavin in a glass house  
Cause everything is shadowing all around  
Now tell me what you mad about  
Im tired of developing nonsense  
And if you were to leave me now  
I probably do nothing to stop it  
  
Missing you anymore  
Missing you anymore  
Missing you anymore  
Missing you anymore  
Touch you little more  
Not love you anymore  
Is That what you really want  
Is That what you really want  
  
Now you can go spin your game girl  
GoGoGo on with your game girl  
Now you can go spin your game girl  
GoGoGo on with your game girl
