How many times did you call me  
And I knew it was late  
I left everybody  
But I never went straight  
I dont claim to be guilty  
But I do understand  
Theres a Law theres an Arm theres a Hand  
  
Now my hearts like a blister  
From doing what I do  
If the moon has a sister  
Its got to be you  
Im going to miss you forever  
Tho its not what I planned  
Theres a Law theres an Arm theres a Hand  
  
Now the deal has been dirty  
Since dirty began  
Im not asking for mercy  
Not from the man  
You just dont ask for mercy  
While youre still on the stand  
There s a Law theres an Arm theres a Hand  
  
I dont claim to be guilty  
Guiltys too grand  
There s a Law theres an Arm theres a Hand  
  
Thats all I can say baby  
Thats all I can say  
It wasnt for nothing  
They put me away  
I fell with my angel  
Down the chain of command  
There s a Law theres an Arm theres a Hand
