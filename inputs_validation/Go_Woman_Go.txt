Go woman go go woman go  
There you stand to tellin me youre gettin tired of me  
Youre sayin that Ive changed up not the way I used to be  
Well theres some things I wanna say I think you ought to know  
And then I think Im gonna let you go woman go  
 dobro   
I stood by and watched you as you tore my honor down  
I even bought the clothes you wore to go out on the town  
I thought youd have your fling and settle down but now I know  
That all you ever wanted was to go woman go  
 dobro   
Now there you stand to tellin me youre walkin out the door  
Youre sayin that youve had it that you cant stand me no more  
Youre thinking that Ill take you back the way I did before  
But not this time Ive set your free to go woman go  
Woman go woman go woman go woman go
