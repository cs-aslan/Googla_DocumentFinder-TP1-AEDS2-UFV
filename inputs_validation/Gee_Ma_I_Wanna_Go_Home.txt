Gee Ma I wanna go but they wont let me go  
Gee Ma I wanna go home  
Oh the soldiers in the army we know theyre mighty fine  
And the Navy Air Force and Marines keep us all in line  
But I dont want no more of this military life  
Gee Ma I wanna go but they wont let me go  
Gee Ma I wanna go home  
Oh the viddles in the mess hall they say theyre mighty fine  
But that SheIte on a shingle why I think Ill give you mine  
Oh I dont want no more of this military life  
Gee Ma I wanna go but they wont let me go  
Gee Ma I wanna go home  
  
Oh I wanna go back home back where civilians roam  
Gee Ma I wanna go home  
  
Well now I tried to join the army they said my feet were flat  
And since I can not see them Ill take their word for that  
Oh Gee Ma I wanna go home  
  
Oh I wanna go back home back where civilians roam  
Gee Ma I wanna go home  
  
Oh the mother of all battles is what Sadam had planned  
Well he shoulda sent his Mother cause his troops all turned and ran  
Oh I dont want no more of this military life  
Gee Ma I wanna go but they wont let me go  
Gee Ma I wanna go home  
  
Oh I wanna go back home back where civilians roam  
Where my rules are all my own  
Gee Ma I wanna go home
