On a lovers leap with a freeway view  
Sittin on my hood  
Thinkin bout you  
Going over in my mind  
Every kiss and every fight  
Yeah the fool on the hill  
Is leading down another night  
  
There were days so hard  
I thought I had to go  
Id get in my car  
And just follow the road  
But this is my home  
And its who I am  
And I know Id stay  
If I could make this old town new again  
  
Color other than blue again  
Id have something to do again  
Instead of thinking about you again  
But the people I know  
The places I go  
Remind me of you  
Oh wont somebody come around  
And make this old town new  
  
There were nights so long  
I thought the sun burned out  
And there were girls so wrong  
I dont want to talk about  
I was burning up the night  
Yeah in an alcohol flame  
Lightin up my way  
Trying to make this old town new again  
  
Color other than blue again  
Id have something to do again  
Instead of thinkin about you again  
But the people I know  
The places I go  
Remind me of you  
Wont somebody come around  
And make this old town new  
  
But the people I know and  
The places I go  
Remind me of you  
  
Love goes wrong but life goes on  
And I know what I gotta do  
Im just hangin around  
Tryin to make this old town new
