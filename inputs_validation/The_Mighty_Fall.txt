Malibu ooh ooh oh  
So why the hell is there a light thats keeping us forever  
Bel Air baby did you get dressed up  
Pretty pout pout  
Until you bottomed up oh

The mighty fall  
They fall in love  
How the mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
Oh how the mighty fall in love  
  
Your crooked love is just a pyramid scheme  
And Im dizzy on dreams and Im dizzy on dreams  
But if you ask me twos a whole lot lonelier than one  
Baby we should have left our love in the gutter where we found it  
Gutter where we found it  
Cause your only crime is that you got caught  
Im singing

The mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
They fall in love  
How the mighty fall  
The mighty fall

Its getting clear  
Youre never coming clean  
Lock you up inside and swallow swallow the key  
  
Hello  
Yeah I know you said not to call unless Im dying  
But Im driving and I cant stop staring at my eyelids  
But even though my eyes closed I still see you  
I just hope that when you see me Im not seethrough  
You know how we do  
  
Sometimes I swear I need a day just for me to lay  
With some T and A but the way we they way we is do deeper  
Baby straight up chemistry DNA  
Make me wanna give you every dollar out my B of A  
Like I let her climb on top  
Im either fuckin or workin so the grind dont stop  
They say I got screws missing well hell only when Im missing you  
And hell yeah Im a dick girl addicted to you  
  
Whoa  
How the mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
They fall in love  
How the mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
Oh how the mighty fall in love
