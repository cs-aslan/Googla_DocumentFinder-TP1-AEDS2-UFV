Theres a song Id like to sing  
Do you know the song I mean  
It dont always sound the same  
But its always good to sing  
  
Maybe it dont mean a thing  
Its a pretty little tune  
Its a song Id like to sing  
And Id love to sing with you  
  
And we can get to know each other  
Like a sister and a brother  
Like a father and a mother  
Like a woman and a man  
  
We can sing along together  
Just enjoying till its over  
It dont need to last forever  
If we want it to it can
