Is yall ready for Twenty07 its now another drought  
Everyones a killer wow we buggin out  
Since 86 showin the crowd what Im about  
And they still want to know when the album comin out  
Ask the teenagers OGs and Ask the kids  
What they definition of Classic is  
Timeless cause age dont count in the booth  
And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth  
And no doubt the truth Im off the meters  
Everybody cosigning even nonbelievers  
I came in the door became one of yalls leaders  
In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers  
Uptown we call em uppies when they on divas  
Prolly worn when KRS One teaches  
Nas made you look before the haters  
I bet you Kan had em on when he walked with Jesus  
This is classic  
classic better than Iv ever been  
Talent  
If its classic its gonna last forever than Im everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
Classic  
Better than Iv ever been  
Kanye West  
Cant buy this superflyness like a shyness your highness  
Its performin look how long the line is  
Thats what happens when you make shit thats timeless  
Thats what happens these rappers is the pioneers  
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is  
Thats so novice Im so polished I got a right to be a little bit snobbish  
I did a little bit of college semesters it took 2 like Rob Base  
To let me figure out this wasnt my place the beat slowed til you listened
to my pace  
cause I be killin shit but thats evident and yall feelin it but I
expected it  
If its classic its gonna last forever than Im everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
classic better than Iv ever been  
Talent  
If its classic its gonna last forever than Im everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
Classic  
Better than Iv ever been  
Nas  
Perseverance see the fake hustler rapper to them it hurts to hear this  
O you went platinum  yeah thats nice now let me see you do the same thing
twice  
New times 4 times then been a couple of more times please your amateur
night is show time  
Its one life to live so live it the best you can the world could use one
less man  
Not enough air not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans
and vans  
When they do make the whip you like ya chips aint right by the time you
could afford it the car aint important  
In the streets silent its just I and  cops keep firin in my environment  
Leavin your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager
to jump on  
I like to be the wall that they post up on I like to see them fall guilty
for doing wrong  
Im classic like the Air Ones the Hustler shoe thats what Im accustomed to  
classic better than Iv ever been  
Talent  
If its classic its gonna last forever than Im everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
Classic  
Better than Iv ever been  
KRS One  
How many yall got criminal minded you you you yall dont be blinded  
Me I got no jewels on my neck why  I dont need em I got your respect  
KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock  this hip hop  
And wes a nation dont you want to hear more KRS on your radio station  
Instead of broadcasting how we smokin trees on the radio we need to hear
more local MCs  
Where you at Come on where you at This is the difference between MCing and
rap  
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal MCs spit rhymes to uplift they
people  
Peace love unity and Havin fun these are the lyrics of KRS One
