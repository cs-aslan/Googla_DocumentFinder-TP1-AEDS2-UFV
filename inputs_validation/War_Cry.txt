Oh I I was marked from the day I was born  
A rebel and I was the one who I am  
My father could not understand the fire in me  
There was there was times I was crazy for real  
So crazy I just couldnt feel no no no  
Confusion would stand in the door and tell me lies  
But now I stand on my feet so alive  
Im a metal warrior I need their cries War Cry  
  
Im a soldier soldier a soldier of fortune  
Ahh come take a stand  
Together well let out a cry  
Im a soldier soldier a soldier of fortune  
Ahh come take a stand  
Together well never say die  
  
Oh I I did not choose the music chose me  
I was christened and destined to be who I am  
The one that they said would be damned  
A hellion child that  
I stand at the mirror and sing  
I dare to be different and dream now I am  
Big thunder that rolls on the land forever wild  
But still this feeling inside never die  
Im a metal warrior I need their cries War Cry  
  
Im a soldier soldier a soldier of fortune  
Ahh come take a stand  
Together well let out a cry  
Im a soldier soldier a soldier of fortune  
Ahh Come take a stand  
Together well never say die  
  
Raise your fist and support your rebel outlaws  
Cause nobody rides for free  
The freedom we lose today you lose tomorrow  
Because freedom means something to us  
  
Im a soldier soldier a soldier of fortune  
Ahh come take a stand  
Together well let out a cry  
Im a soldier soldier a soldier of fortune  
Ahh come take a stand  
Together well never say die
