Did you ever stop to listen  
To what youre missin in the things you say  
If you open up your eyes  
Than youll realize what I say  
  
You can do what you want to  
You can do if you try  
You can do what you want to  
You can do if you try  
  
You take that golden rule  
That you learned in school  
And just throw it away  
If youre well directed  
Then youre protected from the evil ways  
  
You can do what you want to  
You can do if you try  
You can do what you want to  
You can do if you try  
  
You can do what you want to  
You can do if you try
