Affection the gifted architect  
Is making a draft and beautiful design  
The options and possibilities  
Are endless when we connect and realign  
Collections of books and documents  
Arise and parade around my cluttered desk  
Reworking the math and measurements  
Until Im convinced these plans are picturesque  
Like mountains in the Midwest  
  
Reaction creates the columns dark  
And wide like the roads around Fort Lauderdale  
The structures begin to take their shape  
Before Ive designed the public monorail  
The turnpike and highspeed motorway  
Connect and enclose the quaint suburban streets  
The airport the broad suspension bridge  
The lake and the beach where several rivers meet  
Compounded from the spreadsheet  
  
A city sparkles in the night  
How can it glow so bright  
The neighborhoods surround a soft fluorescent light  
Designer skyline in my head  
Abstract and still wellread  
You went from numbered lines to buildings overhead
