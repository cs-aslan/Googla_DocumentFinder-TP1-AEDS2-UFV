Me and TBone on the road to town  
Its like Im walking with a talking machine  
Just as soon as he thinks of something else  
He wont wait to interrupt himself  
Must be something that he cant quite say  
He just doesnt want to leave it that way  
Although he may not know it yet  
Unless I miss my bet  
Hes just trying to forget  
What his heart remembers  
  
I see that TBone got an automobile  
Lowloping and open to the sky  
All night behind the hurricane wheel  
Riding in the eye  
All day underneath the hood  
Mondo Bondo plastic wood  
He needs a mile of masking tape if he wants  
To keep his ship in shape  
Someday to escape what his heart remembers  
Yes what his heart remembers  
  
TBones not alone not alone  
Looks like he gets a second chance  
Its Mamarama and Lumalamalu  
Want to take him to recovery dance  
Hes looking like he gets his meat suit back  
I guess he must have missed the crack attack  
Still hes riding for a fall  
Cause its written upon the wall  
That now he must recall what his heart remembers What his heart remembers
