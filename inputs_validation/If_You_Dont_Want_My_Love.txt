If you dont want my love  
If you dont want my love  
If you dont want my love  
I know who  
Ill give it to  
If you dont want my love  
If you dont want my love  
If you dont want my love  
Anymore  
  
If you dont want the thrill  
If you dont want the thrill  
If you dont want the thrill  
I know who  
I know who will  
If you dont want my love  
If you dont want my love  
If you dont want my love  
Anymore  
  
If thats the way that the world goes round  
Then thats the way  
That it all comes down  
And when you want me  
I wont be around  
If you dont want my love  
If you dont want my love  
If you dont want my love  
I know who  
Ill give it to  
If you dont want my love  
If you dont want my love  
If you dont want my love  
Anymore
