Album Cold Mountain  
Music from the Miramax Motion Picture  
Year 2003  
  
Youll walk unscathed through musket fire  
No ploughmans blade will cut thee down  
No cutlass pull will mark thy face  
And you will be my ain true love  
And you will be my ain true love   
  
And as you walk through deaths dark vale  
The cannons thunder cant prevail  
And those who hunt thee down will fail  
And you will be my ain true love  
And you will be my ain true love  
  
Asleep inside the cannons mouth  
The captain cries Here comes the rout  
Theyll seek to find me north and south  
Ive gone to find my ain true love  
  
The field is cut and bleeds too red  
The cannon balls fly round my head  
The infirmary man may count me dead  
When Ive gone to find my ain true love  
Ive gone to find my ain true love
