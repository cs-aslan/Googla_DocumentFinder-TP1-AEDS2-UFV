All of my love and  
Most of my fears  
Been coming on strong  
For most of my years  
Add up and end up in a song  
  
Cellophane tweeds and revenue streams  
Are blocking my shots and killin my dreams  
That showed me how to be the cause  
  
Ooh ahh yella ooh ahh hey ah what now  
  
Its a lifetime of a strange man thats right  
Its a long time for me I see  
She wants to belong and I want to be free  
Excommunicated cause there aint no guarantee  
  
Ooh ahh yella ooh ahh yeah  
  
All of my friends and enemies  
They were part of this dance  
That put me right here we go  
So glad I got this chance  
  
Better known plans  
And lesser known schemes  
Were all about love and less about me  
Id have to say she wore the pants  
  
Thats oh  
  
Its the lifetime of a strange man thats right  
Its a long time for me Uhhu  
She wants to belong and I want to be free  
Excommunicated cause there aint no guarantee  
  
Woo Yeah  
Ahh  
Go  
Oh  
Ive been left  
Cant figure out what he says next  
And then a bunch of scat  
  
Its a lifetime of a strange man thats right  
Its a long time for me lets see  
She wants to belong and I want to be free  
Excommunicated cause there aint no guarantee  
  
Its a lifetime of a strange man thats me  
Its a long time for me uhuh  
She wants to be rich and I want to be free  
Keep your plans elastic cause there aint no guarantee
