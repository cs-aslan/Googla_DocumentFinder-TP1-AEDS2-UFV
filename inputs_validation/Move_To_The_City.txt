You pack your bags  
And you move to the city  
Theres somethin missin here at home  
You fix your hair  
And youre lookin real pretty  
Its time to get it out on your own  
Youre always fightin  
With your mama and you papa  
Your family life is one big pain  
When you you gonna move to the city  
Into the city where it all began  
  
You gotta move You gotta move  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma  
Time you gotta move  
  
You stole your mamas car  
And your daddys plastic credit card  
Youre sixteen and you cant get a job  
Youre not goin very far  
Youre always ridin  
With the teachers and the police  
This life is much too insane  
When you you gonna move to the city  
Into the city where it all began  
  
You gotta move You gotta move  
Mamamamamamamamama  
Time you gotta move  
Right to the city  
Where the real men get it  
Aw child aint it a pity  
Sometimes it gets too shitty  
Come on and hit me  
  
Youre on the streets  
And it aint so pretty  
You need to get a new what you please  
You do what you gotta do for the money  
At times you end up on your knees  
  
Im always buyin  
With the local and the junkies  
This city life is one big pain  
But you you had to move to the city  
Into the city where it all began  
  
You gotta move You gotta move  
Mamamamamamamamama  
Time you gotta move  
Oh right to the city  
With the real nitty gritty  
Aw child aint it a pity  
Sometimes it gets too shitty  
Come on and hit me
