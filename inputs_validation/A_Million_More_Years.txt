Im finding it hard nobody knows  
Got to hide my desperation before it shows  
With no sense of time I got it all wrong  
We only ever spoke about it after youd gone  
  
Now Im missing you so much  
Loving you so much it hurts  
  
A million more years if I had to wait  
So you can see me  
In another life time  
A million more years if that what it takes  
I know that youll find me  
In another lifetime  
  
I left it too long I thought it would wait  
I never gave a second thought and now its too late  
I gave up too much letting you go  
And all the time I think about how you need to know  
  
How Im missing you so much  
Loving you so much it hurts  
  
And Its never gonna let me go  
  
A million more years if that what it takes  
So you can find me  
In another lifetime  
A million more years if I had to wait  
So you can see me  
In another life time  
  
Youre so far away  
Im missing you missing you  
You know that Ill wait  
  
Im finding it hard nobody knows  
I got to hide my desperation before it shows  
And Im missing you so much  
Loving you so much it hurts  
  
And its never gonna let me go  
A million more years if I had to wait  
So you can see me  
In another life time  
A million more years if that what it takes  
I know that youll find me  
In another lifetime  
  
In another lifetime  
In another lifetime  
In another lifetime  
In another lifetime
