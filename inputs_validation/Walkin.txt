Walkin for your love  
Walkin for your love  
Walkin for your love  
Walkin for your love  
  
Im only going where my eyes are going  
Im only going where my toes are pointed  
I just bought me this new pair of big shoes  
Im only going if I can walk there with you  
  
Shinin for your love  
Shinin for your love  
Shinin for your love  
Shinin for your love  
  
Im afraid to open my eyes  
Im even afraid to look at you  
Right here Im gonna open my eyes  
Im gonna move with you  
  
Disappearin for your love  
Disappearin for your love  
Disappearin for your love  
Disappearin for your love  
  
Were only going in this closet here  
Im only going if the doorknob turns  
Im only going if the light goes on  
Im only going if I can boogie with you
