Gotta tell you a story  
On a cold winters night  
Youll be sailin for glory  
Before you know what is right  
  
So come over here now  
I got a vision for you  
Its my personal snake oil  
Its just something I do  
  
Im the jester with no tears  
And Im playing on your fears  
Im a trickster smiling underneath this mask of love and death  
The eternal lie Ive told  
About the pyramids of gold  
Ive got you hooked at every turn your moneys left to burn  
  
Youll be wanting a contract  
Youll be waiting a while  
Id like to give you my contact  
But that isnt my style  
  
Well you only get one chance  
And its too good to miss  
if i didnt lie to ya  
Then I wouldnt exist  
  
Greed lust and anvy pride  
Its the same old same old ride  
The smoke and mirrors visions that you see are just like me  
Im a bankers face  
With just a letter out of place  
I know someone just like you knows someone just like me  
  
El Dorado come and play  
El Dorado step this way  
Take a ticket for the ride  
El Dorado streets of gold  
See my ship is oversold  
Youve got one last chance to try  
  
So gone is the glory  
And gone is the gold  
Well if you knew the story  
How come it has to be told  
  
Well you can say Im a devil  
And I wouldnt say no  
But out here on the dark side  
Hey on with the show  
  
So now my tale is told  
Big and bad and twice as bold  
This ship of fools is sinking as the cracks begin to grow  
There is no easy way  
For an honest man today  
Which is something you should think of as my lifeboat sails away  
  
El Dorado come and play  
El Dorado step this way  
Take a ticket for the ride  
El Dorado streets of gold  
See my ship is oversold  
Youve got one last chance to try  
  
El Dorado come and play  
El Dorado step this way  
Take a ticket for the ride  
El Dorado streets of gold  
See my ship is oversold  
Youve got one last chance to try
