Say do you remember that guy Larry next door  
Well he always was the neighborhood clown  
Like the time he pulled my pants off  
And he took those color pictures  
  
And posted copies all over town  
Or the time that he dumped toxic waste on my lawn  
Or those wacky prank phone calls from midnight till dawn  
What a crazy kid Larry was always foolin around  
  
Boy what a joker  
What a funny funny guy  
Ill never forget about Larry  
No matter how I try  
  
Say do you remember when I lost all my hair  
Cause Lar gave me that Nair shampoo  
And hey how bout the day he put Ben Gay inside my jockstrap  
And filled my toothpaste tube up glue  
All those wedgies he gave  
All those shoestrings he tied  
All those brownies he made with the ExLax inside  
Oh Lar I swear it was a laugh a minute with you  
  
Boy what a joker  
What a funny funny guy  
Ill never forget about Larry  
No matter how I try  
  
You know I couldnt help but laugh  
Even though he treated me like slime  
Remember when he cut my car in half  
Well he really got me good that time  
  
Say do you remember when I broke in Larrys house  
Late at night and tied his mouth with a rag  
Then I dragged him by his ankles to the middle of the forest  
And stuffed him in a big plastic bag  
  
If the cops ever find him who knows what theyd say  
But Im sure if ol Lar were still with us today  
He would have to agree with me  
It was a pretty good gag  
  
Oh boy what a joker  
What a funny funny guy  
Ill never forget about Larry  
No matter how I try  
  
Oh boy what a joker  
What a funny funny guy  
Ill never forget about Larry  
No matter how I try  
No matter how I try  
  
Oh I remember Larry
