I dont know much about you but I pretty sure I want to be with you  
I havent got a clue what is wrong what is right what is left to do  
I read a magazine  
I watch a TVscreen  
I dive into a dream only to find me in love with you  
  
I wish youll never stop to make my head go pop  
You make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop  
every time youre around  
  
Its a pleasant valley Sunday and everything seems to be beautiful  
People go to church but Im found contemplating by the swimmingpool  
Im gazing at the sun  
I watch him bringing joy to everyone  
I feed the ducks with a ban only to find me in love with you  
  
I wish youll never stop to make my head go pop  
You make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop  
  
You make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop  
every time youre around  
Press to play and never stop to make my head go pop  
Yea you make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop every time youre around  
  
Make my head go pop pop pop  
Make my head go pop pop  
Go pop pop  
I feed the ducks with a ban only to find me in love with you
