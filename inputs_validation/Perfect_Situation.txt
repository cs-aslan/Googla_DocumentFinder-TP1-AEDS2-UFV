Whats the deal with my brain  
Why am I so obviously insane  
In a perfect situation  
I let love down the drain  
Theres the pitch slow and straight  
All I have to do is swing  
And Im the hero but Im the zero  
  
Hungry nights once again  
Now its getting unbelievable  
Cause I could not have it better  
But I just cant get no play  
From the girls all around  
As they search the night for someone to hold onto  
I just pass through  
  
Singing  
Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhhhhhhh  
Singing  
Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhhhhhhh  
  
Get your hands off the girl  
Cant you see that she belongs to me  
And I dont appreciate this excess company  
Though I cant satisfy all the needs she has  
And so she starts to wander  
Can you blame her  
  
Singing  
Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhhhhhhh  
Singing  
Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhhhhhhh  
  
Tell me theres a logic out there  
Leading me to better prepare  
For the day that something really special might come  
Tell me theres some hope for me  
I dont want to be lonely  
For the rest of my days on the earth  
  
Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhhhhhhh  
Singing  
Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhhhhhhh  
Singing  
Ooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
