Though you have refused  
To see me my dear  
Youd rather Id be all alone  
Still I cant forget  
The kisses we knew  
And the days  
When I called you my own  
But you found another  
And you loved him too  
My heart is broken  
Im sad and Im blue  
I am sorry we met  
Its so hard to forget  
The days that used to be  
  
But you found another  
And though you werent true  
I still think of you  
And your memorys so dear to me  
But you found another
