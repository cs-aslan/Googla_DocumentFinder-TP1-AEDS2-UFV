Theres your picture by the bed  
Im gonna leave it where it is  
cause if I tear it out tonight  
My heart would know  
But something aint right  
Between me and you  
Im gonna lie here in the dark  
And pretend youre in my arms  
And if I cant keep on crying out your name  
My heart would think youre here beside me  
And things are still the same  
My mind knows its over  
But how do I break it to my heart  
If I let it down easy  
Itd still be torn apart  
And if I tell it the truth  
Then the pain is gonna start  
My mind knows its over  
But how do I break it to my heart  
When I saw him by your side  
I guess it opened up my eyes  
And my ears can finally hear your soft goodbye  
But my heart still says Im loving you tonight  
And for the rest of its life
