Ive forgotten your number  
I hadnt called in a while  
And Im slowly forgetting your funny little smile  
Ive even stopped missing  
The love that we knew  
But Ive never stopped dreaming of you  
  
Ive lost all the memories  
The feel of your touch  
And its left my mind why I loved you so much  
Ive even forgotten who walked out on who  
But Ive never stopped dreaming of you  
  
Chorus  
Ive never stopped seeing your face every night  
I see it each time that I close my eyes  
And times heal the memories  
Of the pain I went through  
But Ive never stopped dreaming of you  
  
Ive misplaced all the trinkets  
That you told me to keep  
And its been such a long time  
Since Ive lost any sleep  
Now Im doing just fine  
With somebody new  
But Ive never stopped dreaming of you  
  
Chorus  
  
No Ive never stopped dreaming of you
