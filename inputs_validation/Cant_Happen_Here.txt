Contaminated fish and micro chips  
Huge supertankers on arabian trips  
Oily propaganda from the leaders lips  
All about the future  
Theres people over here people over there  
Everybodys looking for a little more air  
Crossing all the borders just to take their share  
Planning for the future  
  
And were so abused and were so confused  
Its easy to believe that someones gonna light the fuse  
Cant happen here cant happen here  
All that you fear theyre telling you cant happen here  
  
Supersonic planes for a holiday boom  
Rio de janeiro in an afternoon  
People out of work but theres people on the moon  
Looking for the future  
Concrete racktracks nationwide  
Juggernauts carving up the countryside  
Cars by the million on a one way ride  
Using up the future  
  
And were so abused and were so confused  
Its easy to believe that someones gonna light the fuse  
Cant happen here cant happen here  
All that you fear theyre telling you cant happen here  
  
Satellites spying for the cia  
The kgb and the men in grey  
Wonder if Im gonna see another day  
Somewhere in the future  
We got everything we need for a peaceful time  
Take what you want but you cant take mine  
Everybodys living on the siegfried line  
Worried bout the future  
And were so abused and were so confused  
Its so easy to believe that someones gonna light it  
Easy to believe someones gonna light the fuse  
Cant happen here cant happen here  
All that you fear theyre telling you cant happen here can it
