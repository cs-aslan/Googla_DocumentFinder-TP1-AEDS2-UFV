Dont think that Ill be hangin round while youre havin fun  
I wont sit there cryin over you  
Well from now on when you step out Ill tell you what Ill do  
Ill lock the door put out the cat and Ill go steppin too  
Yes Ill go steppin too my honey Ill go steppin too  
Ill lock the door put out the cat and Ill go steppin too  
Now every time you come in late and we begin to fight  
You tell me there are more fish in the sea  
But the bait aint what it used to be and I got news for you  
Now after this when you go out well Ill go steppin too  
Yes Ill go steppin too my honey Ill go steppin too  
Ill lock the door put out the cat and Ill go steppin too  
From now on when you come in and wont tell where you been  
With your hair messed up and your clothes dont fit you right  
Well I dont care if I find perfume on you too  
Well you will know that I have been steppin just like you  
Yes Ill go steppin too my honey Ill go steppin too  
Ill lock the door put out the cat and Ill go steppin too  
Yes Ill go steppin too my honey Ill go steppin too  
Ill lock the door put out the cat and Ill go steppin too
