Didnt I tell you everything is possible  
In this deja vu  
Try the river boat the carousel  
feed the pigeons Barbeque  
  
Look at all the people happy faces all around  
Smiling throwing kisses busy making lazy sounds  
  
Its a bright June Afternoon it never gets dark  
WahWah Here comes the sun  
Get your green green tambourine lets play in the park  
WahWah Here comes the sun  
  
Some folks are on blankets slowly daydreaming  
And reaching for their food  
Lets go buy an icecream  
And a magazine with an attitude  
  
And put on a cassette we can pretend that youre a star  
Cause lifes so very simple just like lalala  
  
Its a bright June Afternoon it never gets dark  
WahWah Here comes the sun  
Get your green green tambourine lets play in the park  
WahWah Here comes the sun comes the sun  
  
Theres a painter painting his masterpiece  
Theres some squirrels jumping in the trees  
Theres a wideeyed boy with a red balloon  
All my life Ive longed for this afternoon  
  
Its a bright June Afternoon it never gets dark  
WahWah Here comes the sun  
Get your green green tambourine lets play in the park  
WahWah Here comes the sun
