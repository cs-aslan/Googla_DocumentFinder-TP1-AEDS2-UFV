Well you walked in here and took that stool right next to me  
And you just got through your sad lifes history  
Id like a few words before you start again friend  
  
Blues my name heartbreak is my next of kin  
  
Im living in a world of misery  
Life aint been peaches and cream for me  
And I aint smiled since I dont know when friend  
  
Blues my name heartbreak is my next of kin  
  
Yes I know what its like to love and loose  
Ive stood and watched my golden dreams turn to blue  
Ive lost my love to someone I called my best friend  
  
Blues my name heartbreak is my next of kin  
Blues my name heartbreak is my next of kin
