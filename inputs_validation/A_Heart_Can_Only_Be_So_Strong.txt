A hundred times I have walked out the door  
Just to walk back a hundred times more  
A thousand nights I have sworn not to stay ooh oh  
I remained tangles in the chains of desire ooh  
I know that its no good  
I shouldnt be here  
I know I should leave you  
Shouldnt let you close to me  
Shouldnt have this hold on me  
No I shouldnt be so weak  
But a heart can only be so strong  
Every time I try to go  
Just one look in your eyes I know  
A heart can only be so strong  
A heart can only be  
A hundred ways you have captured my soul  
I cant hold on but I cant let go  
Your spell on me is a spell I cant break ooh oh  
All my strength burning in the flames of desire ooh  
I dont wanna stay here  
I dont wanna leave you  
Dont know how to leave you  
Shouldnt let you close to me  
Shouldnt have this hold on me  
No I shouldnt be so weak  
But a heart can only be so strong  
Every time I try to go  
Just one look in your eyes I know  
That a heart can only be so strong  
A heart can only be so strong  
Oh so strong  
Oh so strong  
I cant let go  
So strong yeah  
Cause youre a part of my soul  
And I I cant escape you  
No matter how hard I try  
I can never be free of your hold on me  
Oh so strong  
Oh I cant let go oh  
A hundred times I have walked out the door  
Just to walk back a hundred times more  
Shouldnt let you close to me  
Shouldnt have this hold on me  
No I shouldnt be so weak  
But a heart can only be so strong  
Every time I try to go  
Just one look in your eyes I know  
In your eyes I know  
That a heart can only be so strong  
Shouldnt let you close to me  
Shouldnt have this hold on me  
But a heart can only be so strong  
Every time I try to go  
Just one look in your eyes I know  
In your eyes I know  
That a heart can only be so strong  
A heart can only be so strong  
A heart can only be so strong
