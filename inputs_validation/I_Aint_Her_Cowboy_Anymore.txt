I pack up my saddle  
Throw it in that twohorse trailer  
Back up my truck hook em up  
And drive away  
Wont be the first time  
But this times the last time  
She meant it when she said  
Thats all Ive got to say  
Never had been thrown like this before  
I aint her cowboy anymore  
  
Never saw it comin  
But I knew where it was goin  
When she asked how long this time  
Before I hit the road  
She didnt come right out and say it  
But I sure got the message  
When I reached out to hold her  
That shoulder sure was cold  
Figured Id just let goodbye run its course  
I aint her cowboy anymore  
  
Chorus  
These white lines are a blur  
Like the last few nights I spent with her  
I dont know where I went wrong  
Or if I did  
Like the good ol boy I am  
I told her that I understand  
But Lord knows that I wont long as I live  
Seems lately every time it rains it pours  
I aint her cowboy anymore  
  
We met in Denver  
Settled down in Dallas  
The best days of my life  
Were the ones I spent with her  
Youd think that all that lovin ought to count for something  
Guess I wore out my welcome  
Like the rowels of these old spurs  
That Casper sunsets what Im shootin for  
Cause I aint her cowboy anymore  
  
Chorus  
  
Her cowboy anymore  
I aint her cowboy anymore
