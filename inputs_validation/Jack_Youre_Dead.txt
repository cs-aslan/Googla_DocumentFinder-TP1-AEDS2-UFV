When youve got no more assurance  
Than a great big hunk of lead  
And if you dont respond to romance  
Jack youre dead  
  
When a chick is smiling at you  
Even though theres nothing said  
If you stand there like a statue  
Jack youre dead  
  
Youve been always kicking  
But you stubbed your toes  
When you ups and kicks the bucket  
Just like old man mose  
  
When you get no kicks from loving  
And you blow your top instead  
Its a fact that you aint living  
Jack youre dead  
  
If you just aint got nobody  
Since youve gone and lost your head  
Rigor Mortis has set in daddy  
Jack youre dead  
  
Whats the use of having muscles  
When your life hangs by a thread  
If you aint got no red corpuscles  
Jack youre dead  
  
Youve been always kicking  
But you stubbed your toes  
When you ups and kicks the bucket  
Just like old man mose  
  
When you get no kicks from loving  
And the news begins to spread  
All the cats will holler Murder  
Jack youre dead  
  
All the breath is leaked out of you  
When your friends gather round the bed  
Look at you and say Dont he look natural  
When that happens to you daddy  
Jack youre dead
