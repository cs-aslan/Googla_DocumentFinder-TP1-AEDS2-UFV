Im gonna wipe these teardrops from my eyes  
There aint no use for me to cry  
And theres some things I think I need to say  
Ill think about you every day every day while youre away  
Ill be true to you honey while youre gone if youre not gone too long  
But if youre gone for a year or two it may be too long for me to be true  
I might find somebody else cause I get lonesome by myself  
Ill be the truest love youve known and for a while Ill stay at home  
Ill be true to you honey while youre gone if youre not gone too long  
 guitar  steel   
Tomorrow youll be gone I know so love me now before you go  
We dont know whats farther down the road  
There may be a detour sign to upset plans of yours and mine  
Ill be true to you honey while youre gone if youre not gone too long  
But if youre gone for a year or two  
Oh yeah if youre not gone too long
