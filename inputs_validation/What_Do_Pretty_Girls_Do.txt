She was a party girl stayed up til the small hours  
Now shes embarrassing and everybody laughs  
At the girl with the face that could drive her baby wild  
Now wasnt she the child with everything  
You should have seen her with her head held high  
Now what do pretty girls do  
She used to be the apple of his eye  
Now what do pretty girls do  
She went through such a lot and never even learned  
That even pretty girls can get their fingers burned  
Shes got a cabin in a town upon the border  
She gets in trouble with the local law and order  
Everybodys happy when she isnt at the door  
She sends out invitations to everyone they dont come  
And the phone aint ringing for her now  
You should have seen her with her head held high  
Now what do pretty girls do  
She used to be the same as me or you  
Now what do pretty girls do  
Well they get older just like everybody else  
She never thought shed have to take care of herself  
You should have seen her with her head held high  
Now what do pretty girls do  
She used to be the apple of his eye  
Now what do pretty girls do  
Collecting all the records and the posters  
Of the people that she knew and they knew  
That shed get older just like everybody else  
She never thought shed have to take care of herself
