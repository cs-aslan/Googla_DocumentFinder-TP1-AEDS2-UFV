I just cant get it through my head you love another now instead  
Cant make myself believe were really through  
Im walkin up and down the hall talkin to the silent wall  
Ill lose my mind before Im over you  
I think Ive almost lost my mind I think about you all the time  
Im goin crazy yes I know and I dont have far to go  
The way you treat me is a shame but Ill keep lovin you the same  
Ill lose my mind before Im over you  
 guitar  piano   
I keep your letters I should burn I wear your ring I should return  
But theres a million foolish things I do  
It makes me cry but you would laugh to know I kiss your photograph  
Ill lose my mind before Im over you  
I think Ive almost lost my mind
