They say I wont make it to the top of the hill  
Wont take the fruit of a tree  
And everybody says Im out for the kill  
  
Theyre all laughing at me  
Theyre all laughing at me  
  
Im a rebel rebel  dont you just know it  
Im a rebel rebel  
And theyre all laughing at me  
  
They say Im a danger to the public and all  
I only wish they would see  
Im just a product of a screwedup world but theyre all  
  
Theyre all laughing at me  
But theyre all laughing at me  
  
Im a rebel rebel  dont you just know it  
Im a rebel rebel  dont you just know it  
Im a rebel rebel  
But theyre all laughing at me  
  
Never ever wash my old blue jeans  
And brush the smile off my face  
But still Im a member of the  
  
Human race human race human race human race  
Im a rebel rebel  dont you just know it  
Im a rebel rebel  dont you just know it  
Im a rebel rebel  dont you just know it  
Im a rebel rebel  
And theyre all laughing at me  
Im a rebel
