Me and my me and my me and my  
Me and my me and my friends  
Like two sweet peas  
In an even sweeter pod  
Thats my friend  
And my friends named Bob  
Like the devil knows hell  
I know Bob well  
Well enough to tell you  
bout his 67 smells  
Well enough to tell you  
Hes a hellaswell fellow  
Well enough to tell you  
That we know each other better  
Than we know our selves  
Like freaks of a feather  
We rock together  
I know Bob well  
But I think he knows me better  
Me and my me and my me and my  
Me and my me and my friends  
Hes as close to me  
As a friend can be  
Ill be standin by my buddy  
Hell be standin by me  
Just another half of  
The two headed freak  
But I need him like  
My heart needs to beat  
At this point  
In this friendly verse  
Ive got to sing a little something  
That I havent rehearsed  
Its about my man  
And his name is Hillel  
For who my love  
Is woul brother sacred  
Take it hickleberry  
Slim boy take it  
Me and my me and my me and my  
Me and my me and my friends  
Jackys eyes are closed  
But hes right on course  
Because hes guided by  
The invisible force  
He drives a kooky green chrysler  
Bad as anybodys porsche  
Hes a working class drummer  
Hes as strong as a horse  
Me and my me and my me and my  
Me and my me and my friends
