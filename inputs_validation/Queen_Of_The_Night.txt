Chorus  
Ive got the stuff that you want  
Ive got the thing that you need  
Ive got more than enough  
To make you drop to your knees  
Cause Im the queen of the night  
The queen of the night  
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah  
  
Dont make no difference if Im wrong or Im right  
Ive got the feeling and Im willing tonight  
Well I aint nobodys angel  
What can I say Im just that way  
  
Chorus   
  
Youve got a problem with the way that I am  
They say Im trouble and I dont give a damn  
But when Im bad I know Im better  
I just want to get you and turn it up for you  
  
Chorus
