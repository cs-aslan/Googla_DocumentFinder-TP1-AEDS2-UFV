Cant think of anything to sing about  
Not much out there to sing about  
The worlds okay the weathers fine  
No need to sing about that  
  
Ill sing about  
  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah yeah  
Sponges suck sponges suck  
Sponges absorb liquid then you squeeze them out yeah  
  
Theres lots of songs of peace  
Lots of songs of love  
Even songs about peaches and Valkyries  
No songs about  
  
Tuna fish tuna fish tuna fish tuna fish  
Theyre real big and swim in oceans  
Come in cans like hockey pucks  
Tuna got their names cause they dont swim in pairs  
  
Get it Tuna Are there two of those fish Nah Twonah Twonah Its funny
Hee hee No I like tuna  
  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah yeah  
Sponges suck sponges suck  
Sponges suck sponges suck  
Sponges clean up dishes and sinks  
And countertops and babys noses  
They suck up soap and when you squeeze them out they make  
Bubbles  
Bubbles  
Bubbles  
  
Sponges
