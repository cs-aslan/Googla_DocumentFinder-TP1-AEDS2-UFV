I know that youre sad  
I know that youre lonely  
You lie awake till way past when  
I want you to know  
  
That Im leaving you only  
Cause I might not get the chance again  
  
Chorus  
Im cold and Im tired  
And I cant stop coughing  
Long enough to tell you all of the news  
Id like to tell you  
That Ill see you more often  
But often is a word I seldom use  
Often is a word I seldom use  
  
Tell me where did the weekend go  
Tell me where did the weekend go  
Went like thunder felt like snow  
Went like thunder felt like snow  
  
You must think my lifes a circus  
Watching me laughing  
And slapping my thighs  
Howd ya like to die  
  
In the house of mirrors  
With nobody around to close your eyes  
  
Chorus  
  
Going down to the Greyhound station  
Going back home  
And get whats mine  
Got me a date  
  
With the ten oclock special  
Gonna be there at a quarter to nine  
  
Chorus
