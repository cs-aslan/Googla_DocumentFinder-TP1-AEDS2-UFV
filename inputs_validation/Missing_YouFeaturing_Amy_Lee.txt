I dont want to say goodbye  
I can see the fear inside your eyes  
Its so hard to walk away  
  
I know that this feels like the end  
Life never seems to let you win  
But Ill be back someday  
  
Im already missing you  
But Im not even gone  
In time well be together again  
And it wont be long  
  
Now everything goes up and down  
And the world keeps spinning round and round  
And still youre waiting there  
  
Ill try to make it another night  
And dream of you when I close my eyes  
Cause Ill be back someday  
  
Im already missing you  
But Im not even gone  
In time well be together again  
And it wont be long  
  
Just hold it in  
Dont let it go  
Youll always live  
Inside my soul
