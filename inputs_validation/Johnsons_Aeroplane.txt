Four long lines one darker than the rest  
Each one has a purpose making borders on the land  
Farmers pride you know he works real hard  
From a small aeroplane you can see the fields  
  
Heart shaped hedges  
Japanese gardens  
Heart shaped hedges  
Japanese gardens  
  
A place to work and grow Repeat x4  
  
Four long years one leaner than the rest  
The animals are fed and the pastures dry  
Farmers pride if the weather doesnt lie  
From a small aeroplane you can see the sea  
Lots of blue very deep blue  
  
A place to work and grow Repeat x4  
  
Johnson sees the fields from all the sides  
Steel machines and black tar roads  
Countryside where the spirit never dies  
In his face all the history shows  
Farmers pride as the rains came down  
  
Heart shaped hedges  
Japanese gardens
