Fragile  
Like a baby in your arms  
Be gentle with me  
Id never willingly  
Do you harm  
Apologies  
Are all you seem to get from me  
But just like a child  
You make me smile  
When you care for me  
And you know  
Its a question of lust  
Its a question of trust  
Its a question of not letting  
What weve built up  
Crumble to dust  
It is all of these things and more  
That keep us together  
Independence  
Is still important for us though we realise  
Its easy to make  
The stupid mistake  
Of letting go do you know what I mean  
My weaknesses  
You know each and every one it frightens me  
But I need to drink  
More than you seem to think  
Before Im anyones  
And you know  
Its a question of lust  
Its a question of trust  
Its a question of not letting  
What weve built up  
Crumble to dust  
It is all of these things and more  
That keep us together  
Kiss me goodbye  
When Im on my own  
But you know that Id  
Rather be home  
Its a question of lust
