Part of me wants to break the ice  
And part of me wants to roll the dice  
Exactly how it stands  
Part of me wants to roll the dice  
And part of me wants to leave them curled up in my hands  
  
Where they will be safe and no one will know  
How I really feel and Ill never be real  
And Ill roll with the punches that Ill never feel  
And Ill have a heart that no one can steal  
  
Chorus  
Its you and me and youre nowhere to be found  
Im rolling on the ground  
Its me and you and Im nowhere to be found  
  
Part of me wants to break these chains  
And part of me wants to keep them locked up tight  
Part of me wants to stop these rains  
And part of me wants them to fall all night  
  
Fall on my head just to wake me up  
Anything to drench my halfempty cup  
And Im sorry baby Ive had enough  
Im tired of your promised tearing me up  
  
Chorus  
  
You will be safe and no one will know  
How you really feel and youll never be real  
And youll roll with the punches that youll never feel  
And youll have a heart that Ill never steal  
  
Chorus
