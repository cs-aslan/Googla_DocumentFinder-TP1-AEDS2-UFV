I dont see you through the windshield  
I dont see you in faces looking back at mealcohol doesnt have much that
matters to saycant imagine where you and time to kill will stay  
  
When the bible is a bottle  
And the hardwood floor is home  
When morning comes twice a day or not at allif I break in two will you put me
back together  
When this puzzles figured out will you still be around  
To say youve just been there  
Walking the line upside down  
  
Walked and breathed many a cancerous mile  
Where the bat of an eye is too slow to beat the coffin  
They wont tell it on the TV  
They cant say it on the radio  
They pay to move it off the shelf and into our mindsuntil you cant tell the
truth  
When its right in front of your eyes  
  
When the bible is a bottle  
And the hardwood floor is home  
When morning comes twice a day or not at all  
If I break in two will you put me back together  
When this puzzles figured out will you still be around  
To say youve just been there  
Walking the line upside down
