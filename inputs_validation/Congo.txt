You say that I put chains on you  
But I dont think thats really true  
But if you want to be free from me  
You gotta lose me in another world  
  
Send me to the Congo Im free to leave  
Theres always somewhere anybody can lead  
Send me to the Congo you have to believe  
You can do it if you want to just do what you please  
  
Like a soldier ant  
I will wait for the signal to act  
To take a walk right through the door  
If you dont want me here any more  
  
Send me to the Congo Im free to leave  
Theres always somewhere anybody can lead  
Send me to the Congo you have to believe  
You can do it if you want to just do what you please  
  
Into my heart you came  
And gave a whole new meaning to my life  
Into my world you brought a light  
I thought it never would go out  
  
Send me to the Congo Im free to leave  
Theres always somewhere anybody can lead  
Send me to the Congo you have to believe  
You can do it if you want to just do what you please  
  
You can send me to the Congo Im free to leave  
Theres always somewhere anybody can lead  
Yes you can send me to the Congo you have to believe  
You can do it if you want to just do what you please  
  
I would never be the one to say you had no reason  
To want me somewhere else far far away  
But someday you may understand someday you will see  
That someone who would die for you is all Ive ever been  
  
Congo the Congo if thats how its got to be  
Congo the Congo if thats what you want from me  
  
I would never be the one to say you had no reason  
To want me somewhere else far far away  
Someday you may understand someday you will see
