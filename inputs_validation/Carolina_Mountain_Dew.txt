Somewhere in the mountains In northern Alabama  
The Carolina lady waits for her man from Tennessee  
Somewhere in a motel Out in Oklahoma  
Theres the Alabama dreamer  
That same man from Tennessee  
  
Sometime late at night The lonely wakes her gently  
And knocks at her door But she wont give in  
But like every other woman She needs to feel wanted  
She thinks of making love And goes to sleep again  
  
Carolina Dreamin lonely  
Carolina Cant you see  
You will always be the lady  
That I dream of holding tight  
That I kiss and tell goodnight  
Carolina Mountain dewe  
  
Sometime that next day On a Mississippi freeway  
The Alabama dreamer Is homeward bound  
His conscious is as clear As those green eyes of Carolina  
And shes waiting with the baby from the love Of the only man to  
Lay her down  
  
Carolina Dreaming lonely  
Carolina Cant you see  
You will always be the lady  
That I dream of holding tight  
That I kiss and tell goodnight  
Carolina Mountain dewe  
Carolina I love you
