Were done but its not over well start it again  
After the end of the day it keeps getting better  
Dont be afraid well do it together  
  
Come on come on you know  
Its your time to move its my time to move  
Come on come on let go  
Leave it all behind your past and mine  
  
Chorus  
Gone are the days of summer  
We couldnt change it if we tried  
Why would we want to lets go where we got to  
Out paths will cross again in time  
Its never the same tomorrow  
And tomorrow is never clear  
  
So come on come on you know  
Our time our time is here  
  
We know but were not certain  
How can we be how can we see whats ahead  
The road keeps on turning  
And all we can do is travel each day to the next  
  
Come on come on you know  
Its your time to move its my time to move  
Come on come on let go  
Leave it all behind your past and mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah  
  
Gone are the days of summer  
We couldnt change it if we tried  
If we tried  
So come on come on come on  
Come on come on come on  
So come on come on you know  
Our time our time  
Is here yeahoh
