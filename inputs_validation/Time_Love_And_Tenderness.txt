So you say that you cant go on  
Love left you cryin  
And you say all your hope is gone  
And whats the use in tryin  
What you need is to have some faith  
Shake off those sad blues  
Get yourself a new view  
  
Oh nothing is as sad as it seems you know  
Cause someday youll laugh at the heartache  
Someday youll laugh at the pain  
Somehow youll get through the heartache  
Somehow you can get through the rain  
  
Chorus  
When love puts you through the fire  
When love puts you through the test  
Nothing cures a broken heart  
Like time love and tenderness  
When you think your world is over  
Baby just remember this  
Nothing heals a broken heart  
Like time love and tenderness  
Time love and tenderness  
  
I understand how youre feeling now  
And what youve been through  
But your worlds gonna turn around  
So baby dont you be blue  
All it takes is a little time  
To make it better  
The hurt wont last forever  
  
Oh all the tears are gonna dry you know  
Cause someday youll laugh at the heartache  
Someday youll laugh at the pain  
You may be down on your luck  
But baby that old lucks gonna change  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby oh baby you just need some  
You just need some  
Time love and tenderness  
Time love and tenderness  
The hurt aint gonna last forever  
Time love and tenderness  
Time love and tenderness
