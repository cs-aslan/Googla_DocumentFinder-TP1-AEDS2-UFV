Father I have come  
To tell you about somethin I done  
Well as the night reared its light head  
Into a babys sun  
We rolled down into the town  
From where the black throats come  
  
And you know there was a robbry  
There was a holdup  
Ooh there was a shootout  
And there was a killin  
And theres blood on my hands  
Today I killed a man  
  
Well now sister you know me well  
And you ask me well how it was I felt  
Well she had an appetite for lovin  
Only a fadin beauty could posses  
She knew just what she wanted  
And she wouldnt take less  
  
I figured it was a small town  
It was at sundown  
It was just a small crowd of people around  
Oh But he wouldnt put his guns down  
No he wouldnt put his guns down  
Oh he wouldnt put his guns down  
Now his bloods on my hands  
Today I killed a man  
  
And papa you showed me the beauty of buckshot  
Well that song a bullet sings as she whistles  
And showed me the story of the selfloading pistol  
  
Well now father I have come  
To tell you about somethin I done  
He had a widow runnin through town screamin  
He had a brother and his tears were streamin  
Now Im movin on the border  
With a rifle on my shoulder  
  
cuz daddy you showed me the beauty of buckshot  
The love song a bullet sings as she whistles  
And showed me the glory of the selfloading pistol  
  
And I just come to tell ya  
That it dont hurt no more  
No it dont hurt no more  
cuz your son hes an outlaw  
Oh your son hes an outlaw  
Yes your son hes an outlaw  
Oh your son hes an outlaw  
Now your son hes an outlaw  
Oh your son hes an outlaw  
And this blood feels good on my hands  
Today I killed a man
