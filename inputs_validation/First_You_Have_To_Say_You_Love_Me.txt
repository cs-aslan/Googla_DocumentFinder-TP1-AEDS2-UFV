First you have to say you love me  
Its no good unless you do  
Cause I need to hear you love me  
Baby just like you  
Yes I need to hear forever  
And if forever it never comes  
Well at least I heard you say it  
If only just for once  
Just like you  
I need to be remembered  
Just like you  
I need to know you care  
It takes to of us to be together  
Just like one  
When its said and done  
Thats only fair  
We could live for just the moment  
But that moment its gonna pass  
Cant you see its now or never  
But if we need to be together  
Its time for you and me to say forever  
For hows it gonna last  
Yes I need to hear you love me  
Baby just like you
