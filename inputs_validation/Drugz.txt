My guitar is jealous of our relationship  
Cause she dont get half the attention that you get  
Lately I dont know how it happened  
But it did  
And now baby now  
All I ever seem to want is  
  
CHORUS  
A kiss a hug some sort of affection  
Ooh I need it  
Youve become my crutch a drug  
Youre my new addiction  
Gimme my fix ooh your love is  
DrugzOoh your touch is  
DrugzOoh your kiss is  
DrugzBaby you are  
DrugzOooh youre just like drugz  
  
I am not what you would call a crazy chick  
But youve got me on some of that crazy  
Shiverin  
Like im cold when its nice and warm  
Sittin by the phone  
Waiting for you to call  
Cause it be callin me  
Baby all I need is  
  
CHORUS  
  
I I I I  
Really need a fix  
oooh I really need a fix baby  
I I I I  
Really need a fix

I I I I  
Really need a fix
