Hey lucky lady lucky lady you are now the lucky lady  
Are you happy with my baby you know youre a lucky lady you lucky lady  
Lucky lady thats what I was I was lucky to have his love  
All a woman could wish for he was that and so much more  
He was mine and how I loved him before your hands ever touched him  
Long before your temping eyes lured my baby from my life

If you dont want something lasting if its just the time youre passing  
Lucky lady give him up cause I do love him very much
