She dont like the flash wanna keep us in the dark  
She dont like the fame baby when were miles apart  
And she getting to the point where its too much for  
And throw us all away its too much for  
She cant hide away cause the world knows who we are  
  
She dont like the lights  
She dont she dont she dont  
She dont like the lights  
She dont she dont she dont  
  
Dont wanna share with no one else want me to herself  
Dont want no love in front of the camera  
  
She dont like the lights  
She dont she dont she dont  
She dont like the lights  
  
Shes giving ultimatums she dont like this life  
She said if I loved her Id give it up wont think twice  
I cant do that  
And its getting to the point where its too much for  
Wanna throw it all away cause its too much for  
She dont wanna live this life damn its my life too  
  
She dont like the lights  
She dont she dont she dont  
She dont like the lights  
She dont she dont she dont  
  
Dont wanna share no one else want me to herself  
Dont want no love in front of the camera  
  
She dont like the lights  
She dont she dont she dont  
She dont like the lights  
  
Why can I choose between the two  
One of the nights Ill run right now  
I wish she could see how good this can be  
I hope she waits a little bit longer  
Cause I dont wanna live life without her by my side  
Cause she gets the light that is in me  
But she dont know she dont know  
  
She dont like the lights  
She dont like the lights  
She dont she dont she dont  
She dont like the lights  
She dont she dont she dont  
She dont like the lights
