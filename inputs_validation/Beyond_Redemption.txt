I see your scars  
I know where theyre from  
So sensually carved and bleeding  
Until youre dead and gone  
Ive seen it all before  
Beauty and splendor torn  
Its when heaven turns to black  
And hell to white  
Right so wrong and wrong so right  
  
Feel it turning your heart into stone  
Feel it piercing your courageous soul  
Youre beyond now redemption  
And no ones going to catch you when you fall  
  
I see you crawl  
You can barely walk  
And arms wide open  
You keep on begging for more  
Ive been there before  
Knocking on the same door  
Its when hate turns to love  
And love to hate  
Faith to doubt and doubt to faith
