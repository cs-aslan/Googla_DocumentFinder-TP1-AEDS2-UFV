Liar liar with your pants on fire white spades hangin on the telephone  
Wire gamblers reevaluate along the dotted line youll never recognize  
Yourself on heartattack and vine  
  
Doctor lawyer beggar man thief Philly Joe remarkable looks on in disbelief  
If you want a taste of madness youll have to wait in line youll probably  
See someone you know on heartattack and vine  
  
Boneys high on china white shorty found a punk dont you know there aint  
No devil theres just god when hes drunk well this stuff will probably kill  
You lets do another line what you say you meet me down on heartattack and  
Vine  
  
See that little jersey girl in the seethrough top with the peddle pushers  
Sucking on a soda pop well I bet shes still a virgin but its only twenty  
Five til nine you can see a million of em on heartattack and vine  
  
Better off in iowa against your scrambled eggs than crawling down cahuenga  
On a broken pair of legs youll find your ignorance is blissful every goddamn  
Time yourre waitin for the RTD on heartattack and vine
