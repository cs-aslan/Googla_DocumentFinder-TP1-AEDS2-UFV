Esta es la casa This is the house  
Este es el cerro This is the hill  
Esta es la historia This is the story  
Es algo chiquitito Its a little thing  
  
This is the house  
This is the hill  
This is the story its a little thing  
A lock of hair  
An invisible smoke trail  
Nothing there but the dust and the rust  
Oh oh oh everything changes  
  
This is your picture its in black and white  
This is the family having a party  
Theres a crack in the ceiling  
And theres an open door  
Nothing there but the dust and the rust  
Oh oh oh everything changes
