I came in here just to see his guilty face  
Im just checkin  
Hes been dead twenty years but I sort of miss the chase  
Im just checkin  
  
Ive seen folk just like her pop their noses round the door  
Theyre just checkin  
If this is where their husband was between 1 and 4  
Theyre just checkin  
  
Nothing hits so definite hits so hard  
When hes moved from Old White Hart  
and hes doing the Old Graveyard  
Were running a check On the love we had taken away  
Were running a check That death wasnt fortnight astray  
Nothing hits so definite repeat  
  
The mask of sobriety for afternoons hed save  
Im just checkin  
If he could fool me regularly hed certainly fool his grave  
Im just checkin  
  
Ive seen those widows pray for the hunt that was taken away  
Theyre just checkin  
They pretend theyve just popped by like they popped by yesterday  
Theyre just checkin  
  
I came round here in case he left a slate  
No one settles up around here like the widowed or the late  
Weve seen folk like you settle bills or family feuds  
But no ones bought a drink for those that death excludes  
Were just checkin  
Were just thinkin  
Were just sinkin
