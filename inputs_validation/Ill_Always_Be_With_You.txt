I just went to the corner  
To get some bread and butter  
Dad called hed got your letter  
This is his new number  
Chickens on the burner  
But wait for me if you can  
Ill be back soon honey  
Big kiss from mommy  
  
Kill kill kill kill kill  
Kill kill kill kill kill  
Kill kill kill kill kill  
  
Please I have a son  
  
Kiss kiss kiss kiss  
Kiss kiss kiss kiss  
  
Sorry I was so late  
Did you call your dad  
I hope he was nice to you  
I dont want to see you sad  
I see you ate your chicken  
And saved me a plate  
I dont know how to tell you I dont know how to tell  
But I love you baby rememember Ill always be with you  
Ill always be with you  
  
I love you mommy I love you with all my heart  
Please always be with me  
  
Miss miss miss miss  
Miss miss miss miss  
  
Mommy mommy  
Why do I love you so if youre just a spec of dust  
Floating endlessly amongst the trillion stars  
Knowing that one day we may float apart  
Meeting each other in universe
