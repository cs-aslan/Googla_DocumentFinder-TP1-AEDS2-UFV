Thought Id go crazy when you said goodbye  
I didnt have that far to go  
But I made a wrong turn somewhere in the night  
Down a long and lonely road  
  
Chorus  
To Honkytonkville an ideal  
Home away from home sweet home  
Honkytonkville where I dont feel  
A thing since youve been gone  
Where the futures always bright  
In the glow of neon lights  
Livin high on Barstool Hill in Honkytonkville  
  
Theres friendly faces everywhere I turn  
Droppin quarters in the slot  
Lord knows that weve all got memories to burn  
And thats why that jukebox plays around the clock  
  
Chorus  
  
Livin high on Barstool Hill in Honkytonkville
