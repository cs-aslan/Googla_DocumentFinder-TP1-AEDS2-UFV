I never cared much for moonlit skies  
I never wink back at fireflies  
But now that the stars are in your eyes  
Im beginning to see the light  
  
I never went in for afterglow  
Or candlelight on the mistletoe  
But now when you turn the lamp down low  
Im beginning to see the light  
  
Used to ramble through the park  
Shadow boxing in the dark  
Then you came and caused a spark  
Thats a fouralarm fire now  
  
I never made love by lantern shine  
I never saw rainbows in my wine  
But now that your lips are burning mine  
Im beginning to see the light  
  
I never cared much for moonlit skies  
I never wink back at fireflies  
But now that the stars are in your eyes  
Im beginning to see the light  
  
I never went in for afterglow  
Or candlelight on the mistletoe  
But now when you turn the lamp down low  
Im beginning to see the light  
  
Used to ramble through the park  
Shadow boxing in the dark  
Then you came and caused a spark  
Thats a fouralarm fire now  
  
I never made love by lantern shine  
I never saw rainbows in my wine  
But now that your lips are burning mine  
Im beginning to see the light  
  
Now that the stars are in your eyes  
Im beginning to see the light  
Now when you turn the lamp down low  
Im beginning to see the light  
  
Used to ramble through the park  
Shadow boxing in the dark  
Then you came and caused a spark  
Thats a fouralarm fire now  
  
Now that your lips are burning mine  
Im beginning to see the light  
Im beginning to see the light  
Im beginning to see the light  
  
Now that your lips are burning mine  
Im beginning to see the light
