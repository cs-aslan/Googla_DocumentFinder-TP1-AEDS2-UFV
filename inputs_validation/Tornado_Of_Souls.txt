This morning I made the call  
The one that ends it all  
Hanging upI wanted to cry  
But dammitthis wells gone dry  
Not for the moneynot for the fame  
Not for the powerjust no more games  
But now Im safe in the eye of the tornado  
I cant replace the liesthat let a 1000 days go  
No more living trapped inside  
Anyway Ill surely die  
In the eye of the tornadoblow me away  
  
Youll grow to loathe my name  
Youll hate me just the same  
You wont need your breath  
And soon youll meet your death  
Not from the yearsnot from the use  
Not from the tearsjust self abuse  
  
Whos to saywhats for me to saybedo  
Cause a big nothing itll be for me  
The land of opportunity  
The golden chance for me  
My future looks so bright  
Now I think Ive seen the light  
  
Cant say whats on my mind  
Cant do what I really feel  
In this bed I made for me  
Is where I sleepI really feel  
I warn you of the fate  
Proven true to late  
Your tongue twist perverse  
Come drink now of this curse  
And now I fill your brain  
I spin you round again  
My poison fills your head  
As I tuck you into bed  
You feel my fingertips  
You wont forget my lips  
Youll feel my cold breath  
Its the kiss of death
