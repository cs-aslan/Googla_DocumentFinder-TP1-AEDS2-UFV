Ive never been a loner  
Never been to California but I wanted to  
I thought it was dreams in my head  
Ive never been a moaner  
But Ill get to Arizona if it kills me to  
I wish I could fly from my bed  
  
And its calling me over  
And its calling me home  
Lets talk it over  
Im calling calling crawling crawling  
Rolling me over  
And its rolling me home  
Im glad all over  
Its calling calling Im crawling my way home  
  
I wrote a little letter  
But it didnt make it better I was aiming to  
But you read it wrong what I said  
Hold on it doesnt matter  
What was written in the letter and Im telling you  
Its not just some dream in my head  
  
And its calling me over  
And its calling me home  
Lets talk it over  
Im calling calling crawling crawling  
Rolling me over  
And its rolling me home  
Im glad all over  
Its calling calling Im crawling my way home  
  
I could always go along without you  
You know I could do it alone and I would  
Cause Im a prima donna gonna go ahead  
Im gonna gonna get my own way if I can  
  
And it keeps calling me over  
And its calling me home  
Lets talk it over  
Im calling calling crawling crawling  
Rolling me over  
And its rolling me home  
Im glad all over  
Its calling calling Im crawling crawling
