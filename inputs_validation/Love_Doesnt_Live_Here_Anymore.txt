How can I stay in this place  
All that I see is her face  
And every room just seems to haunt me  
  
Why would she throw love away  
Guess theres no reason to stay  
Maybe its time to close the door  
  
Chorus  
Darlin  
Love it doesnt live here anymore  
Why cant it be like before  
I know that she still wants me  
Tell me why why did she have to go  
Love doesnt live here I know  
  
I thought our love would go on  
But somehow she knew all along  
That we could never find an answer  
  
Putting an end to our plans  
Leaving my heart in my hands  
Saying goodbye is such a chore  
  
Chorus  
  
And we had something  
There can be no doubt  
Now theres nothing left to talk about  
Shes the one thing I cant live without  
How can I leave it all behind  
  
And how could she throw love away  
Guess theres no reason to stay  
Maybe its time to close the door  
  
Darlin  
Love doesnt live here anymore  
Why cant it be like before  
I know that she still wants me  
Tell me why why did she have to go  
  
Love doesnt live here anymore  
Why cant it be like before  
I know that she still wants me  
  
Tell me why why did she have to go  
Love doesnt live here  
I know Repeat x4
