All night all smiles we were holding hands  
And now you wont shre the bed with me  
Explain if you can  
  
We may not agree on this but lets not fight  
Because who cares who is wrong or right I  
Feel like I cant breathe like thisyour  
Grip is too tight  
  
Taken by surprise because I felt so secure  
Because all the things that youve done  
Have let me wondering  
  
We may not agree on this but lets not fight  
Because who cares who is wrong or right I  
Feel like I cant breath like thisyour  
Grip is too tight  
  
You leave me breatheless with your words  
  
We can say that weve changed together  
Another daygive me your hand let me  
Explain because Ive come to terms with  
Who you are  
  
We may not agree on this but lets not fight  
Because who cares who is wrong or right I  
Feel like I cant breathe like thisyour grip  
Is too tightlets not fight your grip is too  
Is tootight  
  
You leave me breatheless with your words
