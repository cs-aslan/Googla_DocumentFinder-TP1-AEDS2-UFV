Well every time that I come home  
Nobody wants to let me be  
It seems that all the friends Ive got  
Just got to come interrogate me  
I appreciate your feelings  
And I dont want to pass you by  
But I dont ask you bout your business  
Dont ask me about mine  
  
Well its true I love the money  
And I love my brand new car  
I like drinkin the best of whiskey  
And playin in a honktonk bar  
But when I come off the road  
I just gotta have my time  
Cause I got to find a break in this action  
Or else Im gonna lose my mind  
  
So dont ask me no questions  
And I wont tell you no lies  
So dont ask me bout my business  
And I wont tell you goodbye  
  
Well whats your favorite color  
And do you dig the brothers is drivin me up a wall  
And every time I think I can sleep  
Some fool has got to call  
Well dont you think that when I come home  
I just want a little piece of mind  
If you want to talk about the business  
Buddy youre just wasting time  
  
So dont ask me no questions  
And I wont tell you no lies  
So dont ask me bout my business  
And I wont tell you goodbye  
  
I said dont ask no stupid questions  
And I wont send you away  
If you want to talk fishin  
Well I guess thatll be OK
