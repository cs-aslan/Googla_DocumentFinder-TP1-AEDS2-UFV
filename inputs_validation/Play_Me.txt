Everybodys an Enemy  
Telling me lies and its killing me  
Why they all want to get rid of me  
Everybodys my enemy  
Several try to disguise the devil in them  
Wanting to get into my cerebellum but Im  
Ready and willing to tell them that I cant f with them  
Exhale so hard it got my chest swelling  
Like my dick does when watching naked women  
Do sick stuff on my porn collection on television  
  
Trust nobody  
I dont know who to call a friend  
They all just pretend to be  
Fuck Everybody this is to all of yall  
cause everybody is an enemy  
cause everybody is an enemy  
  
Watching my own back  
Strapped in chrome to my homies  
Where the tombstones at where the hoes at  
cause to many didnt act like dikes hermaphrodites  
With benzene amen  
Look at the trash they biting  
The life in times is kinda weaker  
Like the time and life of the sandman  
On Apollo theater  
Imagine that another black with a hook  
Who pulls the wack talent off the stage  
Im in raged  
  
Trust nobody  
I dont know who to call a friend  
They all just pretend to be  
Fuck Everybody this is to all of yall  
cause everybody is an enemy  
cause everybody is an enemy  
  
You fill your lies around me  
And you think youve won  
You feel you can control me  
With the things youve done  
  
You think that you can take me  
You think that you can play me  
Youre going to start to hate me  
I feel that you disgraced me  
I feel that you disgraced me  
I feel that you disgraced me  
I feel that you disgraced me  
I feel that you disgraced me  
  
Trust nobody  
I dont know who to call a friend  
They all just pretend to be  
Fuck Everybody this is to all of yall  
cause everybody is an enemy  
cause everybody is an enemy
