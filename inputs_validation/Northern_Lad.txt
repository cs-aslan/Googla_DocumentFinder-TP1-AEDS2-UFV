Had a northern lad  
Not exactly had  
He moved like the sunset god who painted that  
First he loved my accent  
How his knees could bent  
I thought wed be okay  
Me and my molasses  
But I feel something is wrong  
But I feel this cake just isnt done  
And dont say that you dont  
You dont show much these days  
It gets so fuckin cold  
I loved his secret places  
But I cant go anymore  
You change like sugar cane sayes my northern lad  
Well I guess you go too far when pianos try to be guitars  
I feel the west in you  
But I I feel it falling apart too  
And dont say that you dont  
And if you could see me now  
Said if you could see me now  
Girls youve got to know  
When its time to turn the page  
When your only wet because of the rain  
Because of the rain x2  
Because of the rain
