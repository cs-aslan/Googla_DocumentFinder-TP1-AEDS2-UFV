I can feel the world upon my back  
I got sixteen people breathin down my neck  
And its kinda hard to keep your head afloat  
When the rain wont stop and your face is soaked  
But Im  
  
Im alright alright  
Im alright alright  
  
Chorus  
So just hang on cause I  
I wont be long and  
Just sing that song to me  
It goes Im in love with you  
In love with me  
  
And I can feel your breath upon my neck  
One last caress Im a nervous wreck and its  
Kinda hard to keep your head afloat  
When the rain wont stop and your face is soaked  
But Im  
  
Im alright alright  
Im alright alright  
  
So just hang on cause I  
I wont be long and  
Just sing that song to me  
It goes Im in love with you  
In love with me  
Yeah Im in love with you in love with me  
  
Im alright alright  
Im alright alright  
  
So just hang on cause I  
I wont be long and  
Just sing that song to me  
It goes Im in love with you  
In love with me  
Goes Im in love with you in love with me  
Yeah Im in love with you in love with me now  
Yeah Im in love with you in love with me
