I dream of a day  
When I dare to believe  
Youre the answer  
  
When the shame  
And the guilt are removed  
And the truth appears  
  
Of the touch of your hand  
I lose who I am  
If I want to  
  
I try to resist but  
Succumb to the bliss  
Of your kiss  
  
You should be higher  
Ill take you higher  
Well dont be afraid  
Youll just have to pray  
  
Your lies are more attractive  
Than the truth  
Love is all I want  
Your lies are written down now  
In your book  
Love is all I want  
  
Your arms are infected  
Theyre holding the truth  
Oh stop all your crying  
This one youll lose  
  
You should be higher  
Ill take you higher  
So dont be afraid  
Youll just have to pray  
  
Your lies are more attractive  
Than the truth  
Love is all I want  
Your lies are written down now  
In your book  
Love is all I want  
  
You should be higher  
You should be higher  
  
Love love  
Love love
