One word thats all was said  
Something in your voice called me caused me to turn my head  
Your smile just captured me you were in my future as far as I could see  
And I dont know how it happened but it happens still  
You ask me if I love you if I always will  
  
Well you had me from Hello  
I felt love start to grow the moment I looked into your eyes  
You won me it was over from the start  
You completely stole my heart and now you wont let go  
I never even had a chance you know  
You had me from Hello  
  
Inside I built a wall so high around my heart I thought Id never fall  
One touch you brought it down  
Bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground  
And I swore to me that I wasnt going to love again  
The last time was the last time Id let someone in  
  
Well you had me from Hello  
I felt love start to grow the moment I looked into your eyes  
You won me it was over from the start  
You completely stole my heart and now you wont let go  
I never even had a chance you know  
You had me from Hello  
  
Thats all you said  
Something in your voice calls me caused me to turn my head  
You had me from Hello  
You had me from Hello  
Girl Ive loved you from Hello
