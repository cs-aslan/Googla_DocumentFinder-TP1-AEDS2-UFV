She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak  
Ive been locked inside your heartshaped box for weeks  
Ive been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap  
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

Meateating orchids forgive no one just yet  
Cut myself on angel hair and babys breath  
Broken hymen of your Highness Im left back  
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back
