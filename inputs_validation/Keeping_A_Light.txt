Hey did you happen to see my sweet baby

Tell him for me that if you see him tonight  
Everything is alright

Oh hes a beautiful man  
Kinda hard to understand but  
Hes the only good man that I know  
Wont you tell him for me  
Im keepin a light shinin in the window  
Just in case he decides to come home  
Shining in the window just in case he decides to come home
