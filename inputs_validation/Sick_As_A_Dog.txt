Please I just got to talk to you  
Please well keep your head out of the loo  
Please were a long long way from home  
Please youd turn a young mans face to stone  
  
Chorus  
Sick as a dog whats your story  
Sick as a dog a cat got your tongue  
Sick as a dog youll be sorry  
Sick as a dog cause youre really aint that young  
  
Please you were much to my surprise  
Please youre a lady in disguise  
Please youre the only friend I got  
Please youre the last to see me rot  
  
Please its a shame youre so refined  
Please she was the last thing on my mind  
Please dont be late to take it light  
Please youre gonna bay into the night  
  
Say goodnight
