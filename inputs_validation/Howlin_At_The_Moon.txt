I know theres never been a man in the awful shape Im in  
I cant even spell my name my heads in such a spin  
Today I tried to eat a steak with a big old tablespoon  
You got me chasin Rabbits walkin on my hands and howlin at the moon  
  
Well Sug I took one look at you and it almost drove me mad  
And then I even went and lost what little sense I had  
Now I cant tell the day from night Im crazy as a loon  
You got me chasin Rabbits pullin out my hair and howlin at the moon  
  
Some friends of mine asked me to go out on a huntin spree  
Cause there aint a hound dog in this state that can hold a light to me  
I eat three bones for dinner today then tried to tree a coon  
You got me chasin Rabbits scratchin fleas and howlin at the moon  
  
I rode my horse to town to day and a gas pump we did pass  
I pulled Im up and I hollered WHOA said fill Im up with gas  
The man picked up a monkey wrench and WHAM he changed my tune  
You got me chasin Rabbits spittin out teeth and howlin at the moon  
  
I never thought in this old world a fool could fall so hard  
But honey baby when I fell the whole world must have jarred  
I think Id quit my doggish ways if youd take me for your groom  
You got me chasin rabbits pickin out rings and howlin at the moon
