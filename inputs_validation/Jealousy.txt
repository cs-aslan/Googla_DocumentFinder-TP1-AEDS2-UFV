Just jealousy my jealousy  
Is what you see doing me  
Jealous of me such jealousy  
It shouldnt be  leave me alone  
  
Time is running out out runs the time  
I waste it on my own  
But dont think Im alone  
Oh no not again I wont reply  
I cant stay on the phone  
Ill see you back at home  
I really did think that problem was solved  
But it is not  
  
Just jealousy my jealousy  
Is what you see doing me  
Jealous of me such jealousy  
It shouldnt be  leave me alone  
  
Ive got another one listen to me  
And dont get all hung on  
To things I have done wrong  
Oh no not again I wont reply  
Its only how I feel  
It sometimes seems unreal  
But everyone gets there once in a while  
Are you wishing  
  
Just jealousy my jealousy  
Is what you see doing me  
Jealous of me such jealousy  
It shouldnt be  leave me alone  
Just jealousy my jealousy  
Is what you see doing me  
Jealous of me such jealousy  
It shouldnt be  leave me alone
