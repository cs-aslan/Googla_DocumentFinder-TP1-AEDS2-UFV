White chocolate kisses under the stars  
Riding on horses boys with guitars  
If you really wanna get the root of me  
You dont have to try so hard  
Give me a reason to dance in the dark  
Be there to catch me and Ill fall apart  
If you wanna know how to get to me  
Follow the map to my heart  
I cry for no reason  
I laugh at awkward moments  
Theres no manual that explains where Im going  
So show me the way show me the way  
White chocolate kisses under the stars  
Riding on horses boys with guitars  
If you really want to know how to get to me  
Follow the map to my heart  
You played that thing like youre talking again  
You strum those strings like an angel of love  
Did you notice I cant focus on nothing else  
Whats making me come out of my shell  
Sometimes its so hard to tell  
I dont even know myself when you do yeah you do  
Oh baby dont ask for directions  
Im tired of explaining  
Theres no book Ive read that says what Im saying  
So show me the way show me the way  
Give me a reason to dance in the dark  
Be there to catch me and Ill fall apart  
If you really want to get the root of me  
You dont have to try so hard  
If you wanna know how to get to me  
Then follow the map to my heart  
Just follow it baby to my to my heart  
Just follow
