When will you make up your mind  
Darling just be yourself tonight  
Theres nothing wrong with the way you feel  
The moon and stars are in the sky  
Were centuries apart  
And the lights are shining down on you  
I cant stand it  
Everybodys kissing someone  
Holding hands just to get some fun  
I couldnt care less if I ever get none  
Or never fall into some lovers arms again  
I cant stand it  
Aah Conditioned soul  
When will you make up your mind  
I cant stand it  
Aah Conditioned soul  
When will you make up your mind  
I cant stand it  
Darling dont be afraid tonight  
Somethings wrong with the way you feel  
The moon and stars have all gone by  
Were centuries apart and the lights are dying  
Everybodys hurting someone  
Stabbing back just to get some fun  
I hope to God I dont get me none  
Or never fall into some killers arms again  
When will you make up your mind  
I cant stand it
