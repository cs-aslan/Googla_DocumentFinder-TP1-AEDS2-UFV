Crushing all your worthless goals  
I define control  
Your pains my fucking ecstasy  
So putrid is my world of tyranny  
Accentuate your desperation  
Flesh from bone Ill rip and tear  
I hate the fact  
That we breathe the same air  
Helpless as I dominate  
I wont celebrate  
Until youve all been crucified  
I can not rest til everyone has died  
I cant stand the victim in you  
Infecting everything that I do  
I will eradicate  
Obliterate depopulate  
Divine atrocious suffering  
Cleansation of the weak supremacy  
Pissing on your faith  
Incinerate Gods whore  
Perpetual is my reign  
I will eat your soul  
Must maintain control of the weak  
Must maintain control of the weak  
Must contain the minds of the free  
Must maintain control of the weak  
Must contain the minds of the free  
Must maintain control of the weak
