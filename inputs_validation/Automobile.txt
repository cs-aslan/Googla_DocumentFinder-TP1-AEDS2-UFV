February morning my car wont start today  
I turned the key at 8 03 and the battery passed away  
Inside a my automobile  
I want my automobile  
I want my automobile  
I want to drive it all around this world  
  
Brides gettin married in the springtime  
Widows gettin married in the fall  
I got married in high school  
Or I wouldnt of got married at all  
Id be drivin my automobile  
Be drivin my automobile  
Be drivin my automobile  
I wanna drive it all around this world  
  
Everybody said to the new groom  
Groom what ya gonna be  
I said Im gonna be a symphony  
Just as soon as I find a key  
To my automobile  
I want my automobile  
I want my automobile  
All around this world  
  
Spoken  
Lets take a ride  
  
Columbus sailed the ocean  
Moses parted the sea  
Dolores left me yesterday  
Well I think she took the key  
To my automobile  
I want my automobile  
I want my automobile  
Wanna drive it all around this world  
  
Now I held a little bitty baby  
I held a woman all night  
Whenever I get the hiccups  
I hold my breath til my head gets light  
Then I drive my automobile  
Yeah I drive my automobile  
I drive my automobile  
Im want to drive it all around this world  
  
February morning my car wont start today  
Yeah I turned the key at 8 03  
And the battery passed away  
Inside a my automobile  
Im drivin my automobile  
Wanna my automobile  
Wanna drive it all around this world  
Go on  
  
Spoken  
It is a beautiful day for a ride  
Hey get your head down I cant see anything  
Someone give me a cigarette  
I dont want to take my hands off the wheel  
We ought to take the air filter off this sucker  
So we can see what it will really do  
Uh oh it looks to me like a hospital zone  
Everybody get quiet Shhhhhhhh  
Dont wake the dead up  
Were almost out Hang on Uh oh here we go  
Well you can just hold it until we get to the next town
