Ive got a song that it is my mind  
My little love who is never unkind  
Im a poet and Im better off dead  
These are the words she said  
Down by the breadline pickin up dough  
Hand me the guitar there Ill go  
I would rather make a living instead  
Instead of bein in the red  
My little love from the world outside  
Helpin me keep turnin the tide  
Come and meet me by the neon light  
And Im hopin youll make it alright  
Ill do anything you see fit my little love  
My little love movin in my soul  
My little love who will never turn cold  
It doesnt matter if I aint shaved  
It doesnt matter if I aint behaved  
My little love you been on my side  
Helpin me keep turnin the tide  
Havin a hard time livin right now  
Havin a fine time showin you how  
My little love from the world out there  
Helpin me keep adoin my share  
Come and meet me by the neon light  
And Im hopin you will make it alright  
Ill do anything you see fit my little love  
Ive got a song that it is my mind  
My little love who is never unkind  
Im a poet and Im better off dead  
These are the words she said  
Down by the breadline pickin up dough  
Hand me the guitar there Ill go  
It doesnt matter if I aint shaved  
It dont matter if I aint behaved  
I got a light that is in my soul  
I got a love thatll never turn cold  
Come and meet me by the neon tonight  
And Im hopin youll make it alright  
Ill do anything you see fit my little love  
Ill do anything you see fit my little love
