One two three four five lets go for a drive  
Six seven eight nine ten lets go there and back again  
  
Somethings open its my heart  
If somethings missing its when were apart  
If somethings good its when were back together again  
  
Nothings wrong its just insane  
Nothings right until youre back again  
Nothings broken when its softly spoken  
And were walking slowly down the lane  
  
Why dont we drive in the rain  
Straight to the eye of the hurricane  
Go for a ride in the driving rain  
  
One two three four five lets go for a drive  
Six seven eight nine ten ooh ooh  
One two three four five lets go for a drive  
Six seven eight nine ten lets go there and back again  
Baby baby  
  
You come walking through my door  
Like the one that Ive been waiting for  
Letting sunshine in the darkest places when Ive been going there again  
  
So why dont we drive in the rain  
Straight to the eye of the hurricane  
  
Why dont we drive in the rain  
Straight to the eye of the hurricane  
Go for a ride in the driving rain  
One two three four five lets go for a drive  
Six seven eight nine ten ooh ooh  
One two three four five lets go for a drive  
Six seven eight nine ten lets go there and back again  
Baby baby  
  
In the driving rain  
Why dont we drive  
In the driving rain  
  
One two three four five ooh ooh  
Six seven eight nine ten lets go back again  
One two three four five lets go for a drive  
Six seven eight nine ten lets go there and back again  
  
You come walking through my door
