Dont want to be an actor pretending on a stage  
Dont want to be a writer with my thoughts out on a page  
Dont want to be a painter cause everyone comes to look  
Dont want to be anything when my lifes an open book  
I dream its true but I see it through  
If I could be wasting my time with you  
Dont want to be a farmer working in the sun  
Dont want to be an outlaw always on the run  
Dont want to be a climber reaching for the top  
Dont want to be anything were I dont know when to stop  
I dream Its true but I see it through  
If I could be wasting my time with you so if Im inside your head  
Dont believe what you might have read youll see what I might have said  
To hear it come waste your time with me come waste your time with me  
Wasting my time with you if I could be wasting my time with you  
So if Im inside your head dont believe what you might have read  
Dont believe what you might have read youll see what I might have said  
To hear it come waste your time with come waste your time with me  
Come waste your time with me wasting my time with you if I could be wasting  
My time with you
