Morning sing me a song  
Afternoon bring it along  
Nighttime show me a friend  
Say it again  
Send a good dream my way  
  
Wednesday feeling just fine  
I got to say time on my hands  
Friday look at them run  
Show me some fun  
Taking the sunshine in  
  
God knows youve got to give yourself  
Time to think these days  
Lord knows youve got to take enough  
Time to look both ways  
The pieces fly by so quickly now  
  
Laura look at you walk  
I swear youve got eyes in my head  
Id like to follow you down  
Show you around borrow the crown you wear  
  
Bacon lie on the plate  
Two blackeyed peas wait on the side  
Gravy chicken and rice isnt it nice  
Tell me the price of the food  
  
What happens when the answers they give you arent good enough  
What happens when it rains for eight days on your week off  
You know you cant buy tomorrow no  
Its all a matter of opening up your eyes  
And looking around cause its all there  
Its all there I said taking the sunshine in
