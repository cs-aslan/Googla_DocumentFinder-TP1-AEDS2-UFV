Out here in the country where the weather gets so mean  
She thinks about the places that she aint never seen  
She knows that shes married but she cant remember why  
And she wonders what it might feel like with some other guy  
  
And though shes hotter than an oven  
Just to fill your lovin cup  
If a man answers you better hang up  
  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
  
Youre from New York City where they dont say no prayers  
Anything goes and nobody cares  
And the country girl might thrill ya but you better pass her by  
Cause her ol man love to kill ya for the look thats in your eye  
  
And though youre hotter than an oven  
Just to fill her lovin cup  
If a man answers you better hang up  
  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up
