You better listen my brother  
cause if you do you can hear  
There are voices still callin from across the years  
And theyre cryin across the ocean  
And theyre cryin across the land  
And they will until we all come to understand  
  
That none of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
  
Well there are people in the darkness  
And they just cant see the light  
And if we dont say its wrong then that says its right  
We got to feel for each other  
Let our brothers know were here  
Got to get the message and send it out loud and clear  
  
That none of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
Well its the single truth  
We all need to see  
That none of are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
  
Well I swear to you salvation isnt very hard to find  
None of us can find it on our own  
We got to join together Spirit heart and mind  
All the are suffering knows theyre not alone  
  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
  
If you just look around you  
Youre see what I say  
cause the worlds gettin smaller each passin day  
Now its time to make some changes  
Now its time all realized  
That the truth is shinin right before our eyes  
  
cause none of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
  
Well its the very heart of humanity  
cause none of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
  
None of us none of us  
None of us none of us  
None of us none of us are free  
  
None of us none of us  
None of us none of us  
None of us none of us are free  
  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
cause its the very truth  
We all need to see  
That none of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free
