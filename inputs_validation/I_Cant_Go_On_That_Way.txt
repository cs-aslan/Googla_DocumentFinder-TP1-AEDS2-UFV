Life was a ball of alcohol  
And pills and blues and gals  
And every hung over mornin  
Was an unheeded warnin  
That I shared with my lost pals  
  
And the music flowed  
And my chosen road grew wider everyday  
Til the highs got low and the will said no  
I cant go on that way  
  
Cant go that way cant go that way  
Yes the highs got low and the will said no  
I cant go on that way  
  
Sugar is sweet and good prime meat  
Is so hard to come by  
Saccharine is round again  
But today its do or die  
  
My babys is home where I belong  
And this is still my day  
I am hangin on and I am comin on strong  
And I cant go on that way  
  
Cant go that way cant go that way  
Im still hangin on and comin on strong  
And I cant go on that way  
  
Up is down and next time around  
I aint goin round again  
When it comes my time Im gonna stop at the line  
And forget where Ive been  
  
Who was it said that alive is dead  
And night to some is day  
Just let her go and let a new wind blow  
Cause I can go on that way
