Close  
Naked  
Skin on skin  
Tears are falling  
Tears of joy  
Her first boy  
His first girl  
Makes a change  
  
In a world full of nothing  
Though its not love  
It means something  
  
Shes lonely  
And he says  
Its for her only  
That he lusts  
She doesnt trust him  
Nothing is true  
But he will do  
  
In a world full of nothing  
Though its not love  
It means something  
  
Its not easy to slip away  
And believe it all  
  
Though its not love  
It means something
