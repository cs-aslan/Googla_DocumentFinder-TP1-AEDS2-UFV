Were an oyster cracker on the stew  
And the honey in the tea  
Were the sugar cubes one lump or two  
In the black coffee  
The golden crust on an apple pie  
That shines in the sun at noon  
Were a wheel of cheese high in the sky  
But were gonna be sinkin soon  
  
In a boat thats built of sticks and hay  
We drifted from the shore  
With a captain whos too proud to say  
That he dropped the oar  
Now a tiny hole has sprung a leak  
In this cheap pontoon  
Now the hull has started growing weak  
And were gonna be sinkin soon  
  
Were gonna be  
Sinkin soon  
Were gonna be  
Sinkin soon  
Everybody hold your breath cause  
Were gonna be sinkin soon  
  
Were gonna be  
Sinkin soon  
Were gonna be  
Sinkin soon  
Everybody hold your breath cause  
Down and down we go  
  
Like the oyster cracker on the stew  
The honey in the tea  
The sugar cubes one lump or two  
No thank you none for me  
Were the golden crust on an apple pie  
That shines in the sun at noon  
Like the wheel of cheese high in the sky  
Well were gonna be sinkin soon
