Its only been twenty good minutes since I kissed you  
Come back boo I miss you  
Wish I had twenty million hours to caress you  
And undress you to be continued  
Boy you you dont know how it feels when you whisper in my ear  
Boy you you give my body chills whenever you are near  
  
And boy I got your lovin on my mind  
I got your lovin on my mind  
You got me wrapped up packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
I got your lovin on my mind  
I got your lovin on my mind  
You got me wrapped up packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
  
Wrapped up packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
Wrapped up packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
  
Sometimes we argue and we fight  
But they better know that thats my baby  
You might even think you cute  
But everybody knows that Im his lady  
Every time you see us we super fly  
So proud hes by my side  
He knows Im ride or die  
You dont know how we roll  
Holla at your boy  
Boy you you dont know how it feels when you whisper in my ear  
Boy you you give my body chills whenever you are near  
  
And boy I got your lovin on my mind

You got me wrapped up packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it

You got me wrapped up packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
  
Wrapped up packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
Wrapped up packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it
