This is a song full of metaphors  
All I be needing is  
Tobacco and draw  
Better let me into your  
Country though  
Then I can show you what  
Youre missing me for  
Im a night kind of animal  
Got a receiver  
What you testing me for  
I was scared so I ate em all  
They tasted good  
But they make me look old  
  
And ooh you teach  
Like a toothache  
Im not here for my sake  
How long will this mickey take  
And ooh  
Theres heavy entertainment  
Out here on the pavement  
The men about you gotta  
Get away  
  
Do ooh ooh ooh ooh ya mind  
If I I I I I I touch ya  
Do ooh ooh ooh ooh ya mind  
If I I I I I I touch ya  
  
Ill think youre famous  
If thats what ya want  
But you can pick your  
Own pulpit  
You must fill your own fonts  
Bring some wine  
And some sensodyne  
Then you can be my  
Favorite dodo  
Anyone fancy Monaco  
Im a placebo theyre  
Chasing me fool  
Dont be scared  
You could eat em all  
They taste good  
But they make you look old  
  
Ooh you sick little cup cake  
You could be a keepsake  
You jukebox to generate  
And ooh  
Im heavy entertainment  
In need of containment  
Im mad about you  
Gotta get away  
  
Do ooh ooh ooh ooh ya mind  
If I I I I I I touch ya  
Do ooh ooh ooh ooh ya mind  
If I I I I I I touch ya  
  
Anyone fancy Monaco  
  
Go get a portable  
Recliner bin  
Must take a photo for sure  
Got our our problems and  
A real long name  
And she gets high on  
Rollin rollups  
  
And ooh you teach  
Like a toothache  
Im not here for my sake  
How long will this mickey take  
And ooh  
Theres heavy entertainment  
Out here on the pavement  
The men about you gotta  
Get away  
  
Do ooh ooh ooh ooh ya mind  
If I I I I I I touch ya  
Do ooh ooh ooh ooh ya mind  
If I I I I I I touch ya  
Do ooh ooh ooh ooh ya mind  
If I I I I I I touch ya  
Do ooh ooh ooh ooh ya mind  
If I I I I I I touch ya
