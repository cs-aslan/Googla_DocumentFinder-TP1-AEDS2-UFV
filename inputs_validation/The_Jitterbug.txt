Whos that hiding in the tree top  
Its that rascal The Jitterbug  
Should you catch him buzzing round you  
Keep away from The Jitterbug  
  
Oh the bats and the bees and the breeze in the trees have a terrible
horrible  
Buzz  
But the bats and the bees and the breeze in the trees couldnt do what The  
Jitterbug does  
So be careful of that rascal Keep away from The Jitterbug  
  
The Jitterbug  
  
Oh The Jitter Oh The Bug  
Oh The Jitterbug Bugabug bugabug bugaboo  
In a twitter in the throes Oh the critters  
Got me dancing on a thousand toes  
Thar she blows  
  
Oh the bats and the bees and the breeze in the trees have a terrible
horrible  
Buzz  
But the bats and the bees and the breeze in the trees couldnt do what The  
Jitterbug does  
So be careful of that rascal Keep away from The Jitterbug
