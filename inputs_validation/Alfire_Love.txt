Things were all good yesterday  
And then the devil took your memory  
And if you fell to your death today  
I hope that heaven is your resting place  
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain  
But then that could have been the medicine  
And now youre lying in the bed again  
Either way Ill cry with the rest of them  
  
And my father told me son  
Its not his fault he doesnt know your face  
And youre not the only one  
Although my grandma used to say he used to sing  
  
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night  
And well lie inside a little while here oh  
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up  
And were wrapped in light in life in love  
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut  
For theyre designed to be together oh  
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one  
And were set alight were afire love love love oh  
  
And things were all good yesterday  
Then the devil took your breath away  
And now were left here in the pain  
Black suit black tie standin in the rain  
And now my family is one again  
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend  
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen  
Six years old I remember when  
  
And my father told me son  
Its not his fault he doesnt know your face  
And youre not the only one  
Although my grandma used to say he used to sing  
  
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night  
And well lie inside a little while here oh  
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up  
And were wrapped in light in life in love  
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut  
For theyre designed to be together oh  
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one  
And were set alight were afire love love love oh  
  
And my father and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah  
And my mother and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing halellujah  
And my brother and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah  
And all of my brothers and my sisters yeah  
And my father and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah  
Hallelujah
