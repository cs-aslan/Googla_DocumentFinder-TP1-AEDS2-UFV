Hey Mac see you down the Dolce Vita  
Get back we dont have time  
cause I hear were sending off the heroes  
When the year goes theyre out of the bay  
Trying to find a way  
To make it alive  
  
So long said poor men to their families  
Be strong til we get back home  
And if not take care of all the children  
Until then just hope and pray  
To make it alive  
  
You guys are crazy  
  
They shout and then we leave the harbor  
In doubt theyre acting weird  
And the sea is whipping up a welcome  
If hell come were all easy prey  
Trying to find a way  
To make it alive  
  
You guys are crazy  
  
The captains hand shook for the guys to get in place  
He said Lets look behind your face  
With each corner covered they were all around  
Waiting for the midnight bell to sound  
Out of sight cried Aeron through his glasses  
Dont fight said Gorhams smioulder  
I was scared of being easy prey  
Trying to find a way  
To make it alive
