Liam  
Youre insecure so half of four  
Your old brains are not what they were before  
Zayn  
Add two threes its fine for us  
Cause were young and we can still remember stuff  
  
Harry  
Everyone else can multiply by 60  
Everyone else can add two  
  
All  
And Now take off one hundred and add on 24  
Then divide by two and add on seven more  
And if youre struggling now its not hard to tell  
You dont know o oh your maths skills are terrible  
  
All  
If only you had a mind like me  
Youd understand how to divide the sum by three  
And then just add on the age of this OAP  
You dont know o oh your maths skills are terrible o oh  
  
Harry  
Its really kinda pitiful
