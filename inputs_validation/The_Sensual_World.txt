Mmh yes  
  
Then Id taken the kiss of seedcake back from his mouth  
Going deep South go down mmh yes  
Took six big wheels and rolled our bodies  
Off of Howth Head and into the flesh mmh yes  
  
He said I was a flower of the mountain yes  
But now Ive powers oer a womans body yes  
  
Stepping out of the page into the sensual world  
Stepping out  
  
To where the water and the earth caress  
And the down of a peach says mmh yes  
Do I look for those millionaires  
Like a Machiavellian girl would  
When I could wear a sunset mmh yes  
  
And how wed wished to live in the sensual world  
You dont need wordsjust one kiss then another  
  
Stepping out of the page into the sensual world  
Stepping out off the page into the sensual world  
  
And then our arrows of desire rewrite the speech mmh yes  
And then he whispered would I mmh yes  
Be safe mmh yes from mountain flowers  
And at first with the charm around him mmh yes  
He loosened it so if it slipped between my breasts  
Hed rescue it mmh yes  
And his spark took life in my hand and mmh yes  
I said mmh yes  
But not yet mmh yes  
Mmh yes
