Darling what are we goin through  
Its no secret what I do  
Always through revolving doors  
Each times harder than before  
What goes around comes around  
Ill be with you when I can  
I know its hard to understand  
But I am a circular  
I am a circular man  
Seems Im gone before I left  
Always just one step ahead  
For you its longer marking time  
Lovin me as I pass by  
Chorus  
When daddys on the doorstep  
He wont take you for granted  
Its better than the very first time  
You can count on me eventually  
Cant make up for the time weve lost  
Stolen from myself the most  
I keep your picture close to me  
Take it out for the boys to see  
What goes around comes around  
Ill be home when I can  
Sometimes its hard to understand  
But I am a circular  
I am a circular  
I am a circular man  
Woohoo mmmhmmm  
What goes around comes around  
What goes around comes around  
What goes around comes around  
What goes around comes around  
Around and round and round
