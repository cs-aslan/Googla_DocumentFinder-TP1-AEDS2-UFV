These days are slipping away like thieves in the night  
I try to hold on to them with all my might  
Precious time spent with you goes by much too fast  
Like snow in the sun it just never seems to last  
  
Another tasteless coffee  
Another empty day  
Suddenly last night is just so far away  
Too many talking heads  
What was it that they said  
When were apart the days are dark  
When Im with you Im in the light  
  
Youre my oasis in the night yeah  
Youre my oasis in the night  
Youre my oasis in the night  
You keep our love light shinning bright  
Youre my oasis in the night yeah  
  
When youre in my arms you keep the world at bay  
You stop it at the door  
I dont care what they say  
Times too short  
The fires too hot  
Dont know what to do  
Cause I know in a flash  
Its just a memory too  
  
Another tasteless coffee  
Another empty day  
Suddenly last night is just so far away  
Too many talking heads  
What was it that they said  
When were apart my days are dark  
When Im with you Im in the light  
  
Youre my oasis in the night  
Youre my oasis in the night  
Youre my oasis in the night  
Youre my oasis in the night  
  
I think Ill die  
I just cant wait  
  
Till our next oasis in the night yeah  
Aah till our next oasis in the night  
Till our next oasis in the night yeah  
Youre my oasis in the night
