Its not easy  
Its not easy living on your own  
Its not easy  
Its not easy living on your own  
And its hard its not easy  
And its hard its not easy  
And its a pretty hard thing its not easy  
Its not easy living on your own  
  
All of the things that you used to do  
If theyre done now well theyre done by you  
It seems a big failing in a man  
To take his girl for granted if he can  
  
And its hard thing its not easy  
And its hard its not easy  
And its a pretty hard thing its not easy  
Its not easy livin on your own  
  
Theres no place where you can call home  
Got me running like a cat in a thunderstorm  
Just a big bed and a telephone  
Like the last remnants of a stately home  
  
And its a pretty hard thing its not easy  
And its hard its not easy  
Well its a pretty hard thing its not easy  
Its not easy livin on your own  
  
And its hard its not easy  
And its hard its not easy  
And its a pretty hard thing its not easy  
Its not easy living on your own  
  
Sit here thinking with your head of fire  
Go think the same thing and never tire  
Imaginin the glow of her long clean hair  
As she goes to sit on her own high chair  
  
And its hard thing its not easy  
Well its a pretty hard thing its not easy  
Well its hard babe its not easy  
Its not easy livin on your own  
  
Its not easy a pretty tough thing  
Its not easy well life pretty rough  
Its not easy its a hard time baby  
Its not easy its a hard time baby  
Its not easy its a pretty hard life
