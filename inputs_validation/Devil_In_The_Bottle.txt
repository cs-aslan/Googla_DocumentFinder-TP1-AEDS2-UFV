Well theres a devil in the bottle staring straight at me  
Daring me to reach out but I know hes testing me  
If I take just one sip I become that devils son  
Act a fool sell my soul before God and everyone  
Oh Lord I know I only hurt the ones I love  
  
Im walkin down this dead end road all alone and by myself  
Wish I could blame the whiskey but I can only blame myself  
Running out of chances and Lord thats such a crime  
I got to find the answer before I lose my mind  
Oh Lord its a cryin shame oh Lord Ive caused so much pain  
I only hurt the ones I love  
  
Theres a devil in a bottle that just wont let me be  
So many times Ive been hurtin my soul and family  
But I got free on the day I fought the  
Devil in the bottle  
  
The next time that ol devil tries to get the best of me  
Ill smash that bottle against the wall and know Im finally free  
Theres a devil in a bottle that just wont let me be  
Theres so many times I let him hurt me  
I got free the day I fought the  
  
Devil in the bottle  
Devil in the bottle  
Devil in the bottle
