I can tell just by the look in your eyes  
That the love is gone that I once took  
  
So much has changed in the way you live  
I bet theres nothing left that you could ever give  
  
The words of a madman have spoken  
I guess Im not the only one  
The heart of a sad man is broken  
Eyes lyin eyes  
You can fool anyone without disguise  
Eyes lyin eyes  
Oh yeah you look as cold as ice  
  
Its in your blood  
It floats in your veins  
Ive sacrificed myself  
But all I feel is pain  
Youve done me wrong  
Youve been so bad  
Its the last time a battle is lost  
When Im the one whos sad  
  
The words of a madman have spoken  
I guess Im not the only one  
The heart of a sad man is broken  
Eyes lyin eyes  
You can fool anyone without disguise  
Eyes lyin eyes  
Oh yeah you look as cold as ice  
  
I wish youd die  
I wish youd break down and cry  
I wish youd move  
And then I know Ill be satisfied  
  
Cant you see Im on the edge  
I cant look down  
It is me whos lost and never found
