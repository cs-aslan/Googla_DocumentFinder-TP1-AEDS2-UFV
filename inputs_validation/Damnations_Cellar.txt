Did anybody notice over marmalade and eggs  
In between the princess legs  
What with wars and floods and beggars  
Not to mention stocks and shares  
If you have a moment to spare  
Can you write and reassure me that I have seen  
Theyre constructing a time machine  
There will be no need for the obituary pages  
We can have any hero from the bygone ages  
Til the truth emerges the argument rages  
  
Chorus  
The major and the minor  
Turn from tallow into tar  
Should we leave them in their place  
Down in damnations cellar  
  
When any form of deity that you might enjoy  
Can be conjured with a testtube and a flame  
If its out there then science can explain it  
Or at least remove the blame  
And if theres is anyone youd like to see again  
The speak up quickly  
  
Send us back Da Vinci then we dont have to ponder  
The maddening smile of La Giaconda  
The critics say Nijinsky the dancer of course  
While the punters would probably prefer the horse  
Youll find its quicker than history cheaper than divorce  
  
Chorus  
  
Bring back Liberace or Ollie and Stan  
Shakespeare will have to wait his turn  
Elvis Presley and Puccini shall return  
I suppose we live and learn though its hard to believe as we  
Cheerfully burn  
Its curious  
Some will call for justice  
There are murders to solve  
What about Hitler or at least lee Harvey Oswald  
Give us this day and everything we squander  
Anyone beautiful  
Somebody blonder  
Theyll never please mankind so lie back and enjoy it  
Stop press theyve just decided to destroy it  
  
Chorus
