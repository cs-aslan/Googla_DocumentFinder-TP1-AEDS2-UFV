Well I married a wife in the month of June  
Married her up by the light of the moon  
We live down on Cripple Creek  
Weve been there about a week  
  
Chorus  
Im agoin down to Cripple Creek Im goin on a run  
Goin down to Cripple Creek to have some fun  
Goin down to Cripple Creek Im goin on a run  
Goin down to Cripple Creek to have some fun  
  
Now Cripple Creek girls about halfgrown  
Jump on a man like a dog on a bone  
Roll my pants up to my knees  
Cross on Cripple Creek awhen I please  
  
Chorus  
  
Well Im goin to Cripple Creek Im goin on a run  
Im agoin to Cripple Creek to have some fun  
  
Chorus  
  
Im agoin to Cripple Creek Im goin on a run  
Goin to Cripple Creek to have some fun
