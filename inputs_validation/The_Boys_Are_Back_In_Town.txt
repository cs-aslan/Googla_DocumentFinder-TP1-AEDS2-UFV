Guess who just got back today  
Them wildeyed boys that had been away  
Havent changed that much to say  
But man I still think them cats are crazy  
  
They were askin if you were around  
How you was where you could be found  
Told em you were livin downtown  
Drivin all the old men crazy  
  
The boys are back in town  
The boys are back in town  
  
The boys are back in town  
The boys are back in town again  
  
You know that chick that used to dance a lot  
Every night shed be on the floor shakin what she got  
When I say she was cool she was red hot  
I mean she was steamin  
  
And that time over at Johnnys place  
Well this chick got up and she slapped Johnnys face  
Man we just fell about the place  
If that chick dont want to know forget her  
  
The boys are back in town

Spread the word around  
Guess whos back in town  
  
Just spread the word around  
  
Friday night theyll be dressed to kill  
Down at Dinos Bar n Grill  
The drink will flow and the blood will spill  
And if the boys want to fight you better let em  
  
That jukebox in the corner blastin out my favorite song  
The nights are getting longer it wont be long  
Wont be long till the summer comes  
Now that the boys are here again  
  
The boys are back in town  
The boys are back in town  
  
The boys are back in town  
The boys are back in town

Been hangin down at Dinos  
The boys are back in town again
