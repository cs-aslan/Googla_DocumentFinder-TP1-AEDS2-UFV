The walls are closing in again oh well  
The walls are closing in again oh well  
I seen some thing I thought I never saw  
Covered in hair  
Pauls dad is warped and bubbling oh well  
Pauls dad is warped and bubbling oh well  
And my mind is out here on another wave  
Covered in hair  
  
She wont grow  
  
Chorus  
Youve got a monster distress in your parasol body out  
Youve got a monster dwarfs doors in your parasol of course  
Youve got a monster displeasure in your parasol I told you  
Youve got a monster  in your parasol xnay  
Pauls sister is an alien oh well  
  
Pauls sister is an alien oh well  
I seen some things I thought I never saw  
Covered in hair  
  
She wont grow  
  
Youve got a monster distress my pest in your parasol  
Youve got a monster dwarfs in your parasol war horse  
Youve got a monster displeasure in your parasol   
Youve got a hole in you I never saw   
In your parasol in your parasol
