Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City  
And I dreamed about those cotton fields at home  
I dreamed about my mother  
Dear old papa sister and brother  
  
I dreamed about that girl  
Whos been waiting for so long  
I wanna go home I wanna go home  
Oh how I wanna go home  
  
Home folks think Im big in Detroit City  
From the letters that I write they think Im fine  
But by day I make the cars  
And by night I make the bars  
If only they could read between the lines  
  
Spoken  
  
You know  
I rode a freight train north to Detroit City  
After all these years  
I find that Ive just been wastin my time  
So I just think Ill take my foolish pride  
Put on a south bound freight and ride  
Goin back to the love ones  
The ones I left waitin so far behind  
  
I wanna go home I wanna go home  
Oh how I want to go home
