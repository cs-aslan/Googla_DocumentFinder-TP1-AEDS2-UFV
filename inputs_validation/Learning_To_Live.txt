There was no time for pain  
No energy for anger  
The sightlessness of hatred slips away  
Walking through winter streets alone  
He stops and takes a breath  
With confidence and selfcontrol  
  
I look at the world and see no understanding  
Im waiting to find some sense of strength  
Im begging you from the bottom of my heart  
To show me understanding  
  
I need to live life  
Like some people never will  
So find me kindness  
Find me beauty  
Find me truth  
When temptation brings me to my knees  
And I lay here drained of strength  
Show me kindness  
Show me beauty  
Show me truth  
  
The way your heart sounds  
Makes all the difference  
Its what decides if youll endure the pain that we all feel  
The way your heart beats  
Makes all the difference  
In learning to live  
  
Here before me is my soul  
Im learning to live  
I wont give up till Ive no more to give  
No more to give  
  
Listening to the city  
Whispering its violence  
I set out watching from above  
The 90s bring new questions  
New solutions to be found  
I fell in love to be let down  
  
Once again we dance in the crowd  
At times a step away  
From a common fear thats all spread out  
It wont listen to what you say  
Once youre touched you stand alone  
To face the bitter fight  
Once I reached for love  
And now I reach for life  
  
Another chance to lift my life  
Free the sensation in my heart  
To ride the wings of dreams  
Into changing horizons  
It brings inner peace within my mind  
As Im lifted from where I spilt my life  
I hear an innocent voice  
I hear kindness beauty and truth  
  
  
The way your heart sounds  
Makes all the difference  
Its what decides if youll endure the pain that we all feel  
The way your heart beats  
Makes all the difference  
In learning to live  
  
Spread before you is your soul  
So forever hold the dreams within our hearts  
Through natures inflexible grace  
Im learning to live
