Cherish is the word I use to describe  
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside  
You dont know how many times Ive wished that I had told you  
You dont know how many times Ive wished that I could hold you  
You dont know how many times Ive wished that I could  
Mold you into someone who could  
Cherish me as much as I cherish you  
Perish is the word that more than applies  
To the hope in my heart each time I realize  
That I am not gonna be the one to share your dreams  
That I am not gonna be the one to share your schemes  
That I am not gonna be the one to share what  
Seems to be the life that you could  
Cherish as much as I do yours  
Oh Im beginning to think that man has never found  
The words that could make you want me  
That have the right amount of letters just the right sound  
That could make you hear make you see  
That you are drivin me out of my mind  
Oh I could say I need you but then youd realize  
That I want you just like a thousand other girls  
Whod say they loved you With all the rest of their lies  
When all they wanted was to touch your face your hands  
And gaze into your eyes  
Cherish is the word I use to describe  
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside  
You dont know how many times Ive wished that I had told you  
You dont know how many times Ive wished that I could hold you  
You dont know how many times Ive wished that I could  
Mold you into someone who could  
Cherish me as much as I cherish you  
And I do cherish you  
And I do cherish you  
Cherish is the word
