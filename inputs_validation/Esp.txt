Dark is the night high is the fire  
Touches the sky love with no shape or form  
I am in your minds eye just let your dreams run wild  
  
Somewhere out across the nation  
Someone waiting in the shadows  
Listen I dont want to hear  
return to sender  
Calling I can see the future  
Someday signal with a single motion  
Show me you believe in someone somewhere  
  
Oh baby you give me  
You give me the runaround  
Just another night with you  
Youre on my mind  
And we got love  
And lovell take you higher and higher and higher  
Higher and higher  
  
E S P  
I communicate with you  
Tell me what it means to feel  
What am I supposed to do  
E S P  
Nothing any words can say  
Nothing that we know is real  
But itll take your breath away  
Your breath away  
  
Danger suddenly an early warning  
Suddenly the soul is burning  
But I still believe in someone somewhere  
  
Baby you give me  
You give me the runaround  
Just another night with you  
Im in your mind  
And we got love  
And lovell take you higher and higher and higher  
Higher and higher  
  
E S P  
I communicate with you  
Tell me what it means to feel  
What am I supposed to do  
E S P  
And lovell take you higher and higher and higher  
Higher and higher  
Be prepared to make your sacrifice tonight  
Far beyond the point of no return oh no  
And we got love  
And lovell take you higher and higher and higher  
Higher and higher higher and higher  
Higher and higher higher and higher  
  
Oh oh oh  
What am I supposed to do  
Supposed to do  
Oh oh oh  
But itll take your breath away  
Your breath away  
  
E S P  
I communicate with you  
Tell me what it means to feel  
What am I supposed to do  
Supposed to do  
E S P  
Nothing any words can say  
Nothing that we know is real  
But itll take your breath away  
Your breath your breath away  
ESP  
Nothing any words can say  
Nothing that we know is real  
But itll take your breath away
