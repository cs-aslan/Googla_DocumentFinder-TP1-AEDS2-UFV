Dont really know what day it is  
Been rocking nine days in a row  
All I know is its hurricane season  
And any minute shes gonna blow  
  
I need a shave and I need some rest  
I know some people are worried about me  
But Im french kissing life square in the mouth  
Sailing out on the sea  
  
Went through customs and immigration  
Still this feels like home  
Im floating round through Gorda Sound  
With a cooler and a bong  
  
Maybe I couldve been a pirate  
Maybe in my next life thats what Ill be  
French kissing life square in the mouth  
Sailing out on the sea  
  
Tonight I dont need to feel famous  
Out here all I feel is free  
  
French kissing life square in the mouth  
Sailing out on the sea  
Maybe I couldve been a pirate  
Maybe in my next life thats what Ill be  
French kissing life square in the mouth  
Sailing out on the sea
