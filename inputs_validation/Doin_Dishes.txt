Ayeaye ayeaye  
Ayeaye aye uh  
  
Stupid look at you now  
You screwed it all up  
You kept gamblin  
And ran out of luck  
You thought you was strong  
Thought you was so tough  
And now all youve got  
Is your pride to hold  
And thats not enough  
  
Uh never seen this kind of rain  
This change is so strange  
Though I feel your absence  
Its like a numb pain  
Girl I want to feel again  
  
I dont want to be here  
Doin dishes dishes  
Doin dishes  
I dont want to be here  
Doin dishes dishes  
Doin dishes  
I dont want to be no  
  
Sos sos  
Call sos sos  
Callin sos sos  
Call sos sos  
  
She gave you the world  
And you threw it away  
Plus she was your girl  
And youre engaged  
Inseparable through holiday  
Now shes invisible  
Gone away  
  
Ive been hit by a truck  
And Im bleeding inside  
The cure is too far away  
And Im about to die  
  
Never seen this kind of rain  
Ooh this change is so strange  
Though I feel your absence  
Its like a numb pain yeah  
Girl I want to feel again  
  
I dont want to be here  
Doin dishes dishes  
Doin dishes  
I dont want to be here  
Doin dishes dishes  
Doin dishes no  
I dont want to be no  
  
By the time the sun rise again rise again  
Im hoping you will be with me cause  
I dont want to go on without you  
And I dont want to live here without you  
  
I dont want to be here  
Doin dishes dishes  
Doin dishes  
I dont want to be here  
Doin dishes dishes  
Doin dishes  
  
I dont want to be here  
Doin dishes dishes  
Doin dishes  
I dont want to be here  
Doin dishes dishes  
Doin dishes
