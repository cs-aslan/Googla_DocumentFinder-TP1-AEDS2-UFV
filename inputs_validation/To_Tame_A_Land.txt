He is the king of all the land  
In the Kingdom of the sands  
Of a time tomorrow  
  
He rules the sand worms and the Fremen  
In a land amongst the stars  
Of an age tomorrow  
  
He is destined to be a King  
He rules over everything  
On the land called planet Dune  
  
Body water is your life  
And without it you would die  
On the desert the planet Dune  
  
Without a still suit you would fry  
On the sands so hot and dry  
In a world called Arrakis  
  
It is a land thats rich in spice  
The sand riders and the mice  
That they call the MuadDib  
  
He is the Kwizatz Haderach  
He is born of Caladan  
And will take the Gom Jabbar  
  
He has the power to foresee  
Or to look into the past  
He is the ruler of the stars  
  
The time will come for him  
To lay claim his crown  
And then the foe yes  
Theyll be cut down  
Youll see hell be the  
Best that theres been  
Messiah supreme  
True leader of men  
And when the time  
For judgements at hand  
Dont fret hes strong  
And hell make a stand  
Against evil and fire  
That spreads through the land  
He has the power  
To make it all end
