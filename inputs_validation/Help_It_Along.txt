Some fine day well live  
Together give together  
One fine day  
A time beyond our time  
Come that day well make  
It if were strong  
So help it along help it along  
Help it along  
Please dont laugh at me  
When I tell you  
I believe in love  
cause its still  
The only thing that  
There is too little of  
And its a long time coming  
But come Im sure it will  
And just in time  
The world will rhyme on  
The far side of a hill  
On some fine  
 help it along
