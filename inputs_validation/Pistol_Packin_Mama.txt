Lay that pistol down babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Oh drinking beer in a cabaret  
Was I having fun  
Until one night she caught me right  
And now Im on the run  
  
Oh lay that pistol down babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Oh Ill sing you every night Bing  
And Ill woo you every day  
Ill be your regular mama  
And Ill put that gun away  
  
Oh lay that pistol down babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that thing down before it goes off and hurts somebody  
  
oh she kicked out my windshield  
And she hit me over the head  
She cussed and cried and said I lied  
And she wished that I was dead  
  
Oh lay that pistol down babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Were three tough gals  
From deep down Texas way  
We got no pals  
They dont like the way we play  
Were a rough rooting tooting shooting trio  
But you ought to see my sister Cleo  
Shes a terror make no error  
But there aint no nicer terror  
Heres what we tell her  
  
Lay that pistol down babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Pappy made a batch of corn  
The revenuers came  
The drought was slow  
So now they know  
You cant do that to Mame  
  
Lay that pistol down babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Oh singing songs in a cabaret  
Was I having fun  
Until one night it didnt seem right  
And now Im on the run  
  
Oh lay that pistol down babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Oh pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down
