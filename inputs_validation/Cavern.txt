Your time is near the missions clear  
Its later than we think  
Before you slip into the night  
Youll want something to drink  
Steal away before the dawn and  
Bring us back good news  
But if youve tread in primal soup  
Please wipe it from your shoes  
  
Just then a porthole pirate  
Scourged the evening with his cry  
And sanctuary bugs deprived  
The monkey of its thigh  
A dust arose and clogged my nose  
Before I could blink twice  
Despite the stuff that bubbled up  
I gave some last advice  
  
The flesh from Satans dogs  
Will make the rudiments of gruel  
  
Deduct the carrots from your pay  
You worthless swampy fool  
  
Exploding then through fields and fen  
And swimming in the mire  
The septic maidens gargoyle tooth  
Demented me with fire  
I drifted where the current chose  
Afloat upon my back  
And if perchance a newt slimed by  
Id stuff it in my sack  
  
Soon I felt a bubble form Somewhere below my skin  
But with handy spine of hedgehog  
I removed the force within  
Suzie then removed her mask  
And caused a mighty stir  
The angry mob responded  
Taking turns at grabbing her  
  
The foggy caverns musty grime  
Appeared within my palm  
I snatched Ricks fork to scrape it off  
With deadly icy calm  
  
The brothel wife then grabbed a knife  
And slashed me on the tongue  
I turned the blade back on the bitch  
And dropped her in the dung  
  
The crowd meanwhile had taken Sue  
And used her like a rag  
To mop the slime from where the slug  
Had slithered with the bag  
  
In summing up the moral seems  
A little bit obscure  
  
Give the director a serpent deflector  
A mudrat detector a ribbon reflector  
A cushion convector a picture of nectar  
A virile dissectora hormone collector  
  
Whatever you do take care of your shoes
