I cant see the meaning of this life Im leading  
I try to forget you as you forgot me  
This time there is nothing left for you to take  
This is goodbye  
  
Summer is miles and miles away  
And no one would ask me to stay  
  
And I should contemplate this change  
To ease the pain  
And I should step out of the rain  
Turn away  
  
Close to ending it all I am drifting through the  
stages just  
Of the rapture born within this loss  
Thoughts of death inside  
Tear me apart from the core of my soul  
  
Summer is miles and miles away  
And no one would ask me to stay  
  
And I should contemplate this change  
To ease the pain  
And I should step out of the rain  
Turn away  
  
At times the darks fading slowly  
But it never sustains  
Would someone watch over me  
In my time of need  
  
Summer is miles and miles away  
And no one would ask me to stay  
  
And I should contemplate this change  
To ease the pain  
And I should step out of the rain  
Turn away
