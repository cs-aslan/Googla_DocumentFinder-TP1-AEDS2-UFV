Happy to meet you  
Happy to say hello  
Youre someone  
Id like to know  
Thats very clear to see  
  
Im happy to meet you  
Glad that you  
Wandered by  
No need to be too shy  
Its only you and me  
  
And though we dont  
Know each other very well  
Somehow its not  
Too soon to tell  
Our friendship is  
Gonna grow  
Who knows how far  
It may go  
  
Oh so happy  
To meet you  
And as the days go by  
A possible you and I  
Will meet and then  
Well say happy  
To meet you  
Again and again
