Ive taken so many down  
Ive helped them all to dismount  
Ive followed so many down  
I take their hand me downs  
All with hope  
All with hope  
That emptiness brings fullness  
And loss of love brings wholeness  
All with hope  
All with hope  
That emptiness brings fullness  
And loss of love brings wholeness  
To us all  
  
Everything that I believe  
Crawls from underneath the streets  
Everything I truly love  
Comes from somewhere far above  
Everything that I believe  
Is wrong with you is wrong with me  
Everything I truly love  
I love in you and I love in me  
So give me hope  
Give me hope  
That emptiness brings fullness  
And loss of love brings wholeness  
To us all  
  
You swear you cant swim the river  
Ive become the beggar now  
youve become the saint somehow  
But I saw you running to jump in  
Ive become the beggar now  
youve become the saint somehow  
I swore Id never be your sinner  
Ive become the beggar now  
youve become the saint somehow  
Til I held your sin  
Hand me downs  
  
Now you ask me why Im here  
The same as you  
Im scared its fear  
Ive become the beggar now  
And youve become the saint somehow  
Twist the words and place the blame  
And tell me now arent we the same  
Tripping in our yellow feet  
Checking underneath our sheets  
For some hope  
Give me hope  
That emptiness brings fullness  
And loss of love brings wholeness  
Give me hope  
Give me hope  
That emptiness brings fullness  
And loss of love brings wholeness  
To us all
