Well let the geek in the pink take a stab at it  
If you like the way Im thinkin baby wink at it  
I may be skinny at times but Im fat full a rhymes  
Pass me the mic and Im a grab at it a  
Isnt it delicious crazy way that Im kissin  
Cause baby listen to this dont want to miss it while its hittin  
Sometimes you gotta fit in to get in  
But dont ever quit so soon Im gonna let you win but see  
  
I dont care what you might think about me  
You can vibe without me if you want  
I could be the one to take you home  
Baby I could rock the night alone  
If we never get down it wouldnt be a let down  
But sugar dont forget what you already know  
I could be the one to turn you out  
We could be the talk across the town  
Dont judge me by the color confuse it for another  
You might regret what you let slip away

Well this relationship fodder dont mean to bother nobody  
But cupids automatic musta fired multiple shots at her  
Because she fall in love too often thats what the matter  
At least I talk about it keep a pattern of flattery and a  
She was staring through the doorframe  
Eyeing me down like already a bad boyfriend  
Well she can get her toys outta the drawer then  
Cause I aint comin home I dont need that attention see  
  
I dont care what you might think about me  
Youll get by without me if you want  
I could be the one to take you home  
Baby we could rock the night alone  
If we never get down it shouldnt be the let down  
But sugar dont forget what you already know  
I could be the one to turn you out  
You could be the talk across the town  
Dont judge it by the color confuse it for another  
You might regret what you let slip away  
  
I am more than youre thinking  
Hey look at me go  
From hero to zero  
Oh take it from a geek like me  
I can save you from unoriginal dumbdums  
Who wouldnt care if you complete him or not  
  
So what Ive got a short attention span  
A coke in my hand  
Because Id rather have the afternoon relax and understand  
Mm hip hop and flip flops it dont stop with the light rock  
A shot to mock you kinda puts me in the tight spot  
The hype is nothing more than hoohah so Im  
Developing a language and Im calling it my own  
So take a peek into the speaker and youll see what I mean  
That on the other side the grass is greener  
  
I dont care what you might think about me  
Youll get by without me if you want  
I could be the one to take you home  
Baby we could rock the night alone  
If we never get down it wouldnt be the let down  
But sugar dont forget what you already know  
I could be the one to turn you out  
We could be the talk across the town  
Dont judge it by the color confuse it for another  
You might regret what you let slip away  
  
Im the geek in the pink pink pink
