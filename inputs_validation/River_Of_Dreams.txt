In the middle of the night  
I go walking in my sleep  
From the mountains of faith  
To a river so deep  
  
I must be looking for something  
Something sacred I lost  
But the river is wide  
And its too hard to cross  
  
And even though I know the river is wide  
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore  
And try to cross to the opposite side  
So I can finally find what Ive been looking for  
  
In the middle of the night  
I go walking in my sleep  
Through the valley of fear  
To a river so deep  
  
And Ive been searching for something  
Taken out of my soul  
Something Id never lose  
Something somebody stole  
  
I dont know why I go walking at night  
But now Im tired and I dont want to walk anymore  
I hope it doesnt take the rest of my life  
Until I find what it is that Ive been looking for  
  
In the middle of the night  
I go walking in my sleep  
Through the jungle of doubt  
To a river so deep  
  
I know Im searching for something  
Something so undefined  
That it can only be seen  
By the eyes of the blind  
  
In the middle of the night  
  
Im not sure about a life after this  
God knows Ive never been a spiritual man  
Baptized by the fire I wade into the river  
That runs to the promised land  
  
In the middle of the night  
I go walking in my sleep  
Through the desert of truth  
To the river so deep  
  
We all end in the ocean  
We all start in the streams  
Were all carried along  
By the river of dreams  
  
In the middle of the night
