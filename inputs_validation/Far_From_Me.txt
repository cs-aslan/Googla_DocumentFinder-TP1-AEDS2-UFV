For you dear I was born  
For you I was raised up  
For you Ive lived and for you I will die  
For you I am dying now  
You were my mad little lover  
In a world where everybody fucks everybody else over  
You who are so far from me  
Far from me  
So far from me  
Way across some cold neurotic sea  
Far from me  
  
I would talk to you of all matter of things  
With a smile you would reply  
Then the sun would leave your pretty face  
And youd retreat from the front of your eyes  
I keep hearing that youre doing best  
I hope your heart beats happy in your infant breast  
You are so far from me  
Far from me  
Far from me  
  
There is no knowledge but I know it  
Theres nothing to learn from that vacant voice  
That sails to me across the line  
From the ridiculous to the sublime  
Its good to hear youre doing so well  
But really cant you find somebody else that you can ring and tell  
Did you ever  
Care for me  
Were you ever  
There for me  
So far from me  
  
You told me youd stick by me  
Through the thick and through the thin  
Those were your very words  
My fairweather friend  
You were my bravehearted lover  
At the first taste of trouble went running back to mother  
So far from me  
Far from me  
Suspended in your bleak and fishless sea  
Far from me  
Far from me
