Hands in line  
Arms close to my side  
Im fighting tides of an oceans undertow  
And I figure I might not make it  
And Im taking empty  
But seldom keeping  
And the words retreat breathing histories into stories untold  
And I unfold  
  
My hands are high  
And Im holding out holding up  
Because I figure that I just might make it  
And Im waking empty but seldom sleeping  
And the words repeat breathing histories into stories untold  
And I unfold  
  
Quality is what you see now in the corner of your eye  
Dont be surprised if you hear the bells ring  
They form from the sky and they sound bong bong bong  
And Im holding up because I figure that I just make it  
  
And Im waking empty but seldom sleeping  
And the words repeat breathing histories into stories untold  
And I unfold
