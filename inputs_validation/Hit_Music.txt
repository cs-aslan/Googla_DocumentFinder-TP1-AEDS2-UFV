Hit music on the radio  
Hit music on the radio  
  
When you dance with me we dance forever  
All night long to your favourite  
  
Hit music on the radio  
Hit music on the radio  
  
When you dance with me we dance forever  
All night long to the latest song  
Live a lie dance together  
All night long to your favourite  
  
Hit music  
Hit music  
  
Ive been working hard all day  
To pay the bills I have to pay  
Dont have the strength to work all night  
Or fight until its almost light  
  
Music on the radio  
The dance music at the disco  
  
Live a lie dance together  
All night long to your favourite song  
Live and die its all that we know  
I need a friend at the journeys end  
  
Hit music in stereo  
  
Its all Ive brought but its about forgetting  
Choose a song when the nights too long  
We all need love and we want protection  
I need a friend at the journeys end  
In Kensington or Spanish Harlem  
All night long to your desperate  
  
Hit music on the radio  
Music at the disco  
Hit music on the radio  
Hit music on the radio
