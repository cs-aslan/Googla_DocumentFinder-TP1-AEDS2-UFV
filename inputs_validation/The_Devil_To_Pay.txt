Go on girl take your chances see how long you can go on from man to man  
I can read the lines between your stolen glances  
And I know its time to fold this loosin hand  
Cause youre drawn to the flame by the thrill and the shame  
Of the cheatin game they taught you how to play  
Thats the price of the high life youre livin and you still got the devil to
pay  
Join your friends while you got em cause you know youre gettin older every
day  
You cant wait to let them take you to the bottom  
And Im gettin tired of standin in your way  
But when you hit the ground dont come lookin around  
For the pieces of the love you threw away  
Thats just part of the high cost youre leavin and you still got the devil
to pay  
Now youve been flyin so high for so long and you lie to yourself now most of
all  
Baby all that you needed from me was the freedom to fall  
When the bright lights are gone youll be standin alone  
Forsaken in the naked light of day  
Then youll know that its all over but the dying and you still got the devil
to pay
