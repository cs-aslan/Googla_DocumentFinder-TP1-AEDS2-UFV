If I were a boy even just for a day  
Id roll out of bed in the morning and throw on what I wanted and go  
  
Drink beer with the guys and chase after girls  
Id kick it with who I wanted and Id never get confronted for it  
Cause they stick up for me  
  
If I were a boy I think I could under stand  
How it feels to love a girl I swear Id be a better man  
  
And Id listen to hercause I know how it hurts  
When you lose the one you wanted cause hes takin you for granted  
And everything you had got destroyed  
  
If I were a boy I would turn off my phone  
Tell everyone its broken so theyd think that I was sleepin alone  
  
Id put myself first and make the rules as I go  
Cause I know that shell be faithful waitin for me to come home  
To come home  
  
And if I were a boy I think I could understand  
How it feels to love a girl I swear Id be a better man  
  
And Id listen to her cause I know how it hurts  
When you lose the one you wanted cause hes takin you for granted  
And everything you had got destroyed  
  
Its a little too late for you to come back  
Say its just a mistake think Id for give you like that  
If you thought I would wait for you you thought wrong  
  
But youre just a boy you dont understand you dont understand  
Oh how it feels to love a girl someday you wish you were a better man  
Oh you dont listen to her and you dont care how it hurts  
Until you lose the one you wanted cause youre takin her for granted  
And everything you had got destroyed  
  
But youre just a boy
