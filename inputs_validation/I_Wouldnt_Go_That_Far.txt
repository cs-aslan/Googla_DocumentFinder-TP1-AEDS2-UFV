Ill never forget that night long ago  
When he drove me down that old dusty road  
He took me as far as Id ever been  
He wanted me and I wanted him  
But Id always been told I shouldnt give in  
  
Chorus  
I wouldnt go that far  
I didnt follow my heart  
He said he loved me  
But I wasnt ready  
And I wouldnt go that far  
  
He was so patient he didnt give up  
With a ring in his hand and a heart full of love  
He asked me for forever I asked him to wait  
To please understand these dreams I must chase  
Though it was a promise I wanted to make  
  
Chorus  
  
After all these years I saw him again  
He had his wife and his family with him  
He said he was proud of all my success  
He guessed both of us had found happiness  
  
Chorus  
  
Yes I knew he loved me  
But I wasnt ready  
And I wouldnt go that far
