When you hear would should coulda  
Gotta think mighta been in spite of  
Low down tired of being a fighter  
Turn around put it all behind you  
Caught in a trap and you cant walk out  
Its in your mind so you cant walk out  
Now dont get stuck  
Stuck in a loop again  
Well youre gonna get stuck  
Stuck in a loop again  
When you hear maybe baby someday  
Gotta say when do I get it my way  
Freezedried waitin for the big day  
Get wise take another freeway  
Caught in a trap and you cant walk out  
Its in your mind so you cant walk out  
Just when you think youve got it beat  
It sets you up and knocks you down  
Try to blow it off or trade it in  
Youll wind up in the lost and found  
And then youre stuck  
Stuck in a loop again  
Well youre gonna get stuck  
Stuck in a loop again  
Maybe random maybe a scam  
Fate lays waste to the greatest plans  
Thats life  
Talk about karma moan about sin  
Just dont get stuck in that loop again  
Cause thats life
