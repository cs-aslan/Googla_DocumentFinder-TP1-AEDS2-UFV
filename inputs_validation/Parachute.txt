I wanna take you with me  
To life with no more yesterdays  
We can start again awake and so excited  
And change the way we always push  
The way we pull  
  
I open up and be your parachute baby  
And Ill never let you down  
So open up and be my human angel  
And well only hit the ground  
Running  
  
And when the world gets sharp and tries to cut you down to size  
And makes you feel like giving in  
Oh I will stay I will rain I will wash the words and pain away  
And I will chase away the way we push  
The way we pull  
Youre beautiful  
  
Ill open up and be your parachute  
  
And Ill never let you down  
So open up and be my human angel  
And well only hit the ground  
Running  
  
And if it feels like we might drop  
It will stop  
So dont look down  
It wouldnt be the same without you  
This life is too good to give up on  
  
Ill open up and be your parachute  
And Ill never let you down  
So open up and be my human angel  
And well only hit the ground  
And were gonna hit the ground  
Running
