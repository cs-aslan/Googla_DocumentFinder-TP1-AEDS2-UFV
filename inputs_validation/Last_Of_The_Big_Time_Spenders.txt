Well if money makes a rich man  
Then I might never make the grade  
Ill be a small time operator  
If I just get the landlord paid  
But if time is an indication  
Of the wealth that I never knew  
Then Im the last of the big time spenders  
Cause Ive been spending time on you woo oo oo woo  
It takes time to appreciate  
Lord knows that you can learn to hate it  
I believe cause Ive been there too  
When it gets down to desperation  
You make the best of the situation  
I can tell Ive seen it through oh oh oh  
Though it seems like the day is wasted  
And the nights have been overdue  
Well Im the last of the big time spenders  
And Ive been spendin time on you woo oo oo woo  
Its been so long since we got together  
In between it seems to take forever  
But Im a dreamer Ill be there soon  
It takes time to appreciate  
All of those that you can learn to hate  
I believe Ive seen it through oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You can call me the Great Pretender  
And in a way it might be true  
But Im the last of the big time spenders  
And Ive been spendin time on you woo oo oo woo
