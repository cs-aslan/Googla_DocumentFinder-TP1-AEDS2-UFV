Who will love a little Sparrow  
Whos traveled far and cries for rest  
Not I said the Oak Tree  
I wont share my branches with  
No sparrows nest  
And my blanket of leaves wont warm  
Her cold breast  
  
Who will love a little Sparrow  
And who will speak a kindly word  
Not I said the Swan  
The entire idea is utterly absurd  
Id be laughed at and scorned if the  
Other Swans heard  
  
Who will take pity in his heart  
And who will feed a starving sparrow  
Not I said the Golden Wheat  
I would if I could but I cannot I know  
I need all my grain to prosper and grow  
  
Who will love a little Sparrow  
Will no one write her eulogy  
I will said the Earth  
For all Ive created returns unto me  
From dust were ye made and dust ye shall be
