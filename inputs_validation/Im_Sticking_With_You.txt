Im sticking with you  
Cause Im made out of glue  
Anything that you might do  
Im gonna do too  
  
You held up a stage coach in the rain  
And Im doing the same  
Saw youre hanging from a tree  
And I made believe it was me  
  
Im sticking with you  
Cause Im made out of glue  
Anything that you might do  
Im gonna do too  
  
Some people go  
Into the stratosphere  
Soldiers fighting  
With the Cong  
  
But with you by my side  
I can do anything  
When we swing  
We hang past right or wrong  
  
Ill do anything for you  
Anything you want me too  
Ill do anything for you  
Oh Im sticking with you  
Oh Im sticking with you  
Oh Im sticking with you
