Once upon a time you dressed so fine  
Threw the bums a dime in your prime didnt you  
People call say beware doll youre bound to fall  
You thought they were all kidding you  
You used to laugh about  
Everybody that was hanging out  
Now you dont talk so loud  
Now you dont seem so proud  
About having to be scrounging your next meal  
  
How does it feel how does it feel  
To be without a home  
Like a complete unknown like a rolling stone  
  
Ahh youve gone to the finest schools alright Miss Lonely  
But you know you only used to get juiced in it  
Nobodys ever taught you how to live out on the street  
And now youre gonna have to get used to it  
You say you never compromise  
With the mystery tramp but now you realize  
Hes not selling any alibis  
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes  
And say do you want to make a deal  
  
How does it feel how does it feel  
To be on your own with no direction home  
A complete unknown like a rolling stone  
  
Ah you never turned around to see the frowns  
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you  
You never understood that it aint no good  
You shouldnt let other people get your kicks for you  
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat  
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat  
Aint it hard when you discovered that  
He really wasnt where its at  
After he took from you everything he could steal  
  
How does it feel how does it feel  
To have on your own with no direction home  
Like a complete unknown like a rolling stone  
  
Ahh princess on a steeple and all the pretty people  
Theyre all drinking thinking that theyve got it made  
Exchanging all precious gifts  
But you better take your diamond ring you better pawn it babe  
You used to be so amused  
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used  
Go to him he calls you you cant refuse  
When you aint got nothing you got nothing to lose  
Youre invisible now youve got no secrets to conceal  
  
How does it feel ah how does it feel  
To be on your own with no direction home  
Like a complete unknown like a rolling stone
