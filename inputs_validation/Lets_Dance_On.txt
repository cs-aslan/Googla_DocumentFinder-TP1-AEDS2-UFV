Lets dance on  
Oh baby come on  
Lets dance on til the dawn  
Have fun til the musics all gone  
  
Weve been dancin  
Nearly all night long  
Lets keep it up baby  
Cause the musics still strong  
Were doin the Pony  
Now youre doing the Jerk  
A come on baby  
Let me see how you work  
  
Lets dance on  
Oh baby come on  
Lets dance on til the dawn  
Have fun til the musics all gone  
  
The way youre movin  
Girl you look so fine  
You been doin the Shotgun  
Let me see you do the Twine  
Lets see the Watusi  
And the Action too  
Now hang on baby  
Ill do the sloopy with you  
  
Lets dance on  
Oh baby come on  
Lets dance on til the dawn  
Have fun til the musics all gone
