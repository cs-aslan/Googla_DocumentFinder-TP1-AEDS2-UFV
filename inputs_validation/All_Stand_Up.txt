All stand up let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up are you ready for the weekend are you ever  
All stand up let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up let me hear you say were gonna get together  
  
Working all week till Friday  
Wish I could do it my way  
Until when Im living it up  
I aint giving it up  
Making the best of my lot  
One of these days when I stop  
And Im gonna be living it up  
I wont be giving it up  
Telling you now its my day  
Oh Im gonna do it my way  
  
All stand up let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up are you ready for the weekend are you ever  
All stand up let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up let me hear you say were gonna get together  
  
The job it just drives me crazy  
Guess Im a little lazy  
I dont care cause what do they know  
Theyll be there when I go  
Every day feel like screaming  
Nothing gonna stop me dreaming  
And theres one thing sure that I know  
I cant wait for the whistle to blow  
Telling you now its Friday  
Im gonna do it my way  
  
All stand up let me hear you say never say never  
  
All stand up let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up are you ready for the weekend are you ever  
All stand up let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up let me hear you say were gonna get together  
  
Living and loving and learning  
Gotta keep the whole world turning  
So come on lets give it a try  
No use in wondering why  
Running away and hiding  
Taking our time and finding  
If we stop then its all gonna go  
Dont wait for the whistle to blow  
Everyday feel like screaming  
Nothing gonna stop me dreaming  
  
All stand up let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up are you ready for the weekend are you ever  
All stand up let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up let me hear you say were gonna get together  
  
All hands up let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up let me hear you say never say never say never say
