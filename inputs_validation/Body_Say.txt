Verse  
If I had it my way I would take you down  
If I had it my way I would turn you out  
And if my body had a say I would come again  
Scared of what I might say cause Im at the edge  
  
And our eyes are crossing paths across the room  
Theres only one thing left for us to do  
  
Chorus  
You can touch me with slow hands  
Speed it up baby make me sweat  
Dreamland take me there cause I want your sex  
If my body had a say I wouldnt turn away  
Touch make love taste you  
If my body told the truth baby I would do  
Just what I want to  
  
Verse  
If I had it my way I would take the lead  
And if I had it my way I would take you deep  
If my body had a say Id get it off my chest  
Show you all the red lace underneath this dress  
  
And our eyes are crossing paths across the room  
Theres only one thing left for us to do  
  
Chorus  
You can touch me with slow hands  
Speed it up baby make me sweat  
Dreamland take me there cause I want your sex  
If my body had a say I wouldnt turn away  
Touch make love taste you  
If my body told the truth baby I would do  
Just what I want to  
  
Bridge  
My minds getting in the way  
Cant feel what my body say  
Imma tell you anyway  
Imma tell you anyway  
My minds getting in the way  
Cant feel what my body say  
Imma show you anyway  
Imma show you anyway  
  
Theres only one thing left for us to do  
Oh you can  
  
Chorus  
You can touch me with slow hands  
Speed it up baby make me sweat  
Dreamland take me there cause I want your sex  
If my body had a say I wouldnt turn away  
Touch make love taste you  
If my body told the truth baby I would do  
Just what I want to  
  
You can touch me with slow hands  
Dreamland  
If my body had a say I wouldnt turn away  
Touch make love taste you  
If my body told the truth baby I would do  
Just what I want to
