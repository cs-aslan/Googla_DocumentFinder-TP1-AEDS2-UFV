IWho took the money  
Who took the money away  
IIts always showtime  
Here at the edge of the stage  
I I I wake up and wonder  
What was the place what was the name  
We want to wait but here we go again  
  
Itakes over slowly  
But doesnt last very long  
Ino need to worry  
Evrythings under control  
O  you  T But no hard feelings  
What do you know Take you away  
Were being taken for a ride again  
I got a girlfriend thats better than that  
She has the smoke in her eyes  
Shes moving up going right through my house  
Shes ginna give me surprise  
Better than this know that Its right  
I think you can if you like  
I git a girlfriend with bows in her hair  
And nothing is better than that  
  
Down down in the basement  
We hear the sound of machines  
I I Im driving in circles  
Come to my senses sometimes  
Why why why why start it over  
Nothing was lost everythings free  
I dont care how impossible it seems  
  
Somebody calls you but you cannot hear  
Get closer to be far away  
Only one look and thats all that we need  
Maybe thats all that it takes  
All that it takes all that it takes  
All that it takes all that it takes  
I got a girlfriend thats better than that  
And she goes wherever she likes there she goes  
  
I got a girlfriend thats better than that  
Now everyones getting involved  
Shes moving up going right through my heart  
We might not ever get caught  
Going right through try to stay cool going through staying cool  
I got a girlfriend thats better than that  
And nothing is better than you  
  
I got a girlfriend thats better that this  
And you dont remember at all  
As we get older and stop making sense  
You wont find her waiting long  
Stop making sense stop making sensestop making sense making sense  
I got a girlfriend thats better than that  
And nothing is better that this  is it
