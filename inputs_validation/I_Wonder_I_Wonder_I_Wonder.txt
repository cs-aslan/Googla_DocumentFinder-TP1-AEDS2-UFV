All by myself alone at home a feeling blue  
Thoughts keep roaming through my mind theyre all of you  
I wonder if youre dancing with somebody new  
I wonder I wonder cant help it if I wonder  
No matter which side of the pillow that Im sleeping on  
My dreams of you continue through until the dawn  
And after that I find the day dream crew comes on  
I wonder I wonder cant help it if I wonder  
You care for someone else I see  
Well then its quite alright with me  
Im gonna get me dressed up in my Sunday suit  
And find myself somebody who is twice as cute  
And when you realize that you and I are through  
I wonder I wonder I wonder what youll do
