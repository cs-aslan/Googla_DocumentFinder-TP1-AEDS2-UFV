I got a feelin called blueueues  
Oh lord  
Since my baby said goodbye  
Id dont what Im gonna do  
All I do is sit and sigh  
Oh lord  
The last long day said goodbye  
Well I know how hard I would cry  
  
Hell do me  
Hell do you  
Hes got that kinda lovin  
Lord I love to hear it  
When he calls me sweet baby  
Such a beautiful dream  
I had to think it all oover  
I lost my heart it seems  
  
Well I got some esteem somehow  
Im nobodys sugar baby now  
I got the looonesome  
Ive got the lovesick blues  
  
Well Im in love  
Im in love  
With a wonderful guy  
Thats whats the matter with me  
Im in love  
Im in love with a wonderful guy  
But he dont care about me  
  
Well Ive tried and tried  
To keep him satisfied  
But he just cant see  
And now that he is leaeaeavin  
That is all I can say  
  
I got a feelin called blueueues  
Oh lord  
Since my baby said goodbye

All I do is sit and sigh oh lord  
The last long day said goodbye
