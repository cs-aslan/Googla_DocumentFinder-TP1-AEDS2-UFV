Dont hang around boy find yourself a job  
Get it next year or better take it today  
Dont let the others already come to top  
Create security for the time youre out of date  
  
Before you get old at the underground  
Soakin your life away  
  
Some pretty nice boys say you must be mad  
You must be jokin is it funny or sad  
You must be throwing your life away  
Cant bear existence from powered life all day  
  
Youll miserably die in a dead end street  
Soakin your life away  
  
I got an amp and a guitar  
Im gonna scratch the stars  
Important things in life Id never sell  
Got the world and I got you  
Nothing more to do  
But future is a thing that I cant tell
