People try to take my soul away but I dont hear the rap that they all say  
They try to tell us we dont belong thats alright were millions strong  
This is my music it makes me proud these are my people and this is my crowd  
  
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  
  
Sometimes days are so hard to survive a million ways to bury you alive  
The sun goes down like a bad bad dream  
Youre wound up tight gotta let off steam  
They say they can break you again and again if life is a radio turn up to
ten  
  
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  
  
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  
  
And they try to tell us that we dont belong  
But thats alright were millions strong  
You are my people you are my crowd this is our music we love it loud  
  
Yeah and nobodys gonna change me cause thats who I am  
  
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  
  
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  
  
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights
