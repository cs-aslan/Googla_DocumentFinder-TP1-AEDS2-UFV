I bought a bourgeois house in the hollywood hills  
With a truckload of hundred thousand dollar bills  
Man came by to hook up my cable tv  
We settled in for the night my baby and me  
We switched round and round til halfpast dawn  
There was fiftyseven channels and nothin on  
  
Well now home entertainment was my babys wish  
So I hopped into town for a satellite dish  
I tied it to the top of my japanese car  
I came home and I pointed it out into the stars  
A message came back from the great beyond  
Theres fiftyseven channels and nothin on  
  
Well we mighta made some friends with some billionaires  
We mighta got all nice and friendly if wed made it upstairs  
All I got was a note that said  byebye john  
Our love is fiftyseven channels and nothin on  
  
So I bought A 44 magnum it was solid steel cast  
And in the blessed name of elvis well I just let it blast  
til my tv lay in pieces there at my feet  
And they busted me for disturbing the almighty peace  
Judge said  what you got in your defense son  
 fiftyseven channels and nothin on  
  
I can see by your eyes friend youre just about gone  
Fiftyseven channels and nothin on
