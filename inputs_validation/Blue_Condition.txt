Dont take the wrong direction passing through  
Instead of deep reflection of whats true  
For its a combination of judgments made by you  
That cause a deep dejection all the way through  
  
No relaxation no conversation no variation  
In a very dark blue blue condition  
  
Early rising every day  
You must be enterprising in your way  
For you will hear no laughter nor see the sun  
Life would be one disaster all the way through  
  
No relaxation no conversation no variation  
In a very dark blue blue condition  
  
Dont take the wrong direction passing through  
Instead of deep reflection of whats true  
For its a combination of judgments made by you  
That cause a deep dejection all the way through  
  
No relaxation no conversation no variation  
In a very dark blue blue condition  
  
No relaxation no conversation no variation  
In a very dark blue blue condition
