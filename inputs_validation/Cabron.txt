I see you in the park  
Youre always wearing dark or blue  
My dawg and me  
And anyone from any other crew  
I am small but I am strong  
Ill get it on with you  
If you want me to  
What else can I do  
Everyone would take a cue from anything you do  
If you want them to  
What else can it do  
I dont want to fight  
I want to get along with you  
This time of nights for singing songs about the local news

I come around and make peace get down have a barbecue  
Lets keep the moon awake and do electric boogaloo  
I am small but I am strong  
You see Im just like you  
If you only knew  
That Im just like you  
All the world would take a cue from anything you do  
If you only knew  
That theyre just like you  
I dont want to fight  
I want to get along with you  
This time of nights for singing songs about the local news  
  
I dont want to fight  
I want to get along with you  
This time of nights for singing songs about the local news

Cause Im just like you  
If you only knew
