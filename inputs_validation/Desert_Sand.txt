You tell me theres no darkness  
While the sun shines down on you  
And just because your life is peaceful  
Theres no fighting left to do  
For every cup that runneth over  
Many more are filled with pain  
You talk to me of sunshine  
When its pouring down with rain  
  
Just because you cant see it  
Doesnt mean it isnt there  
Just because it cant touch you  
Doesnt mean you shouldnt care  
For every life thats lit with love  
Many more are racked with pain  
You talk to me of sunshine  
When its pouring down with rain  
  
  
CHORUS  
  
Its a long black night good people  
Descended on our land  
Share your light  
Make a flower grow  
In the desert sand
