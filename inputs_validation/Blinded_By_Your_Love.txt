I was blinded by your love  
I was blinded by your love  
I couldnt talk to you last night  
Friends and strangers side by side  
I was blinded by your love  
  
Oh God knows  
Were walking through a fire  
Sound of breaking hearts around  
Oh you know were burning in desire  
City of the lost and found  
In a world of broken dreams  
We will build a better life  
Youre my Venus in blue jeans  
Only the strong survive  
So come on baby come on baby  
  
Dreams are made  
Made of deep emotion  
Love will feed a brand new world  
Baby you need the shadows and devotion  
Living in a better world  
Theres a heavy weather girl  
The clouds disappear  
The masquerade of loneliness  
Is drowning too much tears  
Come on baby come on baby
