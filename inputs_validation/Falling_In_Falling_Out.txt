Oh no I took your number down  
Now I cant find it and Im back in town  
Tonight tonight  
I cant believe where the hell its gone  
And looking for a lover wont be too much fun  
Tonight tonight  
  
Im standing in line again  
Wasting my time  
I know Id feel fine again  
With you on the line  
With you on the line  
  
Chorus  
And Im falling in falling out  
I still dont know what its all about  
Im falling in falling out  
Im creeping in but Im crawling out again  
Falling in falling out  
Im giving up so Im calling out to you  
  
I bet youre thinking you where just a game  
I bet you bet I cant recall your name  
Tonight tonight  
How can I tell if I cant get through  
How can I make it if Im not with you  
Tonight tonight  
  
Im standing in line again  
Wasting my time  
I know Id feel fine again  
With you on the line  
With you on the line  
  
Chorus x3
