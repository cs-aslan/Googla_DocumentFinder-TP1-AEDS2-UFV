I speak to myself sometimes and I say Oh my  
In a lot of ways youre a lucky guy  
Now all you need is a chance to try  
Any love  
  
In my heart theres a need to shout  
Dyin screamin cryin let me out  
Are all those feelings that want to touch  
Any love  
  
What a world for the lonely guy  
Sometimes I feel Im gonna lose my mind  
Can anybody tell me just where to find  
Any love any love  
  
Chorus  
Everyone needs a love no doubt  
Any love Any love  
Everybody feels alone without  
Any love any love  
  
I know theres a love waiting  
To enter my life enter my life  
  
Every day as I live  
I try to think positive  
I pray for someone good to come  
Any love  
  
Love is sweet and so divine  
And I cant wait for my love life to shine  
Can anybody tell me where I can find  
Any love any love  
  
Everyone needs a love no doubt  
Any love Any love  
Everybody feels alone without  
Any love any love  
  
I know theres someone waiting for me  
To enter my life Come into my life  
  
Suddenly Im up in clear blue skies  
Lonely tears start to fill my eyes  
I can weep but I refuse to cry  
Ive got to keep holding on  
  
To think love is strong  
To keep holding on  
  
Everyone needs a love no doubt  
Any love Any love  
Everybody feels alone without  
Any love any love  
  
And I know I know I know I know shell come into my life  
Come into my life
