Dont make me beg for your kisses  
Beg for your tender embrace  
I want your love not your sympathy  
Please dont make a beggar of me  
Since I looked in your direction  
Your tenderness is all I seem to crave  
But when I look for your affection  
You smile my dear and tell me to behave  
Dont make me beg for your kisses  
Beg for your tender embrace  
I want your love not your sympathy  
Please dont make a beggar of me  
While I sigh and keep confessing  
The love I have for you will never die  
Somehow you always keep me guessing  
And wondering just how long Ill have to cry  
Dont make me beg for your kisses  
Beg for your tender embrace  
I want your love not your sympathy  
Please dont make a beggar of me
