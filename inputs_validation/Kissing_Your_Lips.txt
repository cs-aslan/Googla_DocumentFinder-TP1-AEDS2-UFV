A little piece in my life  
Is all I need to get me by  
But of course  
One or two more things  
Would make me satisfied  
  
But right about now  
Im sitting down  
With a girl who think shes found  
Something more  
I dont know  
A little sister cant be sure  
Listen  
  
I just like kissing your lips  
My darling girl  
I know thats not what love is  
So why cant I  
Keep mine and you keep yours  
So we both know  
What were still waiting for  
  
Just one more week  
Go back home  
Suburban life cant be that bored  
Take your pills  
Wash them down  
With some coffee and some crowns  
  
Just give me a kiss with your lips  
Can you let me grab your hips  
Make me stop  
I dont know  
If I can do that on my own  
  
I just like kissing your lips  
My darling girl  
I know thats not what love is  
So why cant I  
Keep mine and you keep yours  
So we both know  
What were still waiting for  
  
Here we are  
Were going through the motions  
Doesnt mean  
Were promising devotion  
Dont ask me  
Dont tell me no  
This is love  
  
A cigarette is what I need  
Cause after this I should believe  
This is love  
Understand  
That youll have to tell your man  
So just tell him  
  
I just like kissing your lips  
My darling girl  
I know thats not what love is  
So why cant I  
Keep mine and you keep yours  
So we both know  
What were still waiting for x2
