She walks in and Im suddenly a hero  
Im taken in my hopes begin to rise  
Look at me cant you tell Id be so  
Thrilled to see the message in your eyes  
You make it seem Im so close to my dream  
And then suddenly its all there  
  
Suddenly the wheels are in motion  
And I Im ready to sail any ocean  
Suddenly I dont need the answers  
Cause I Im ready to take all my chances with you  
  
How can I feel youre all that matters  
Id rely on anything you say  
Ill take care that no illusions shatter  
If you dare to say what you should say  
You make it seem Im so close to my dream  
And then suddenly its all there  
  
Suddenly the wheels are in motion  
And I Im ready to sail any ocean  
Suddenly I dont need the answers  
Cause I Im ready to take all my chances with you  
  
Why do I feel so alive when youre near  
Theres no way any hurt can get through  
Longing to spend every moment of the day with you  
  
Suddenly the wheels are in motion  
And I Im ready to sail any ocean  
Suddenly I dont need the answers  
Cause I Im ready to take all my chances with you
