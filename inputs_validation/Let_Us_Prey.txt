It took three damn days for the mission man  
Heard hes comin straight from hell  
With a fast track bleedein and siren screamin  
If you dont listen you could never tell  
  
Three days dead and risin  
Where you goin nowI widh you well  
Three days dead and risin  
With a half head full a  dreams I could never sell  
  
Let us prey  
Three days gone for the misson man  
Three days gone and risin  
Three days gone hear the mission man say  
  
Time to get down to business  
Let us prey  
He walked in like the duke he was the mission man  
He had death leakin from his eyes  
  
Machine gun bigger with his linger of the trigger  
Said it took me three days to rise  
Three days dead and risin  
I think these here are yours I couldnt tell  
  
Three days dead and risin  
Then he handed on back the dreams that he couldnt sell  
Lord I got a bleeder it a taste track feeder  
And it nailed me down tight for the rest a my life  
  
Its a double damn shot a  what I need when I want it  
And its givin me redemption through the darkest og night  
Lord I lost the lightenin it was so damn frightenin  
And it pulled me up close like I was losin my life  
  
Was a double damn shot knocked me down yeah I got it  
And it givin me some light through the rest a my life
