We talk on the phone  
There it is its only your mind  
But can it   
Dont you hurt  
Its all coming right here  
The sweet up and down  
Tickle in your throat  
Things you know quite well  
Youre a joke  
I know whats gone wrong  
Needles in my legs keep me raw  
The sweet up and down  
I believe in love  
But think nothing about it  
When youre not around  
I believe in love  
Think its just so fine  
Sweet up and down  
  
Got two words to make up the wall  
Gods the selling point  
And the great inventor of course of  
The sweet up and down  
I believe in love  
But believe that its love  
That keeps beating me down  
I believe in love  
I think its just fine  
The sweet up and down  
Leaves me  
I know my place  
I made my money selling  
Gods the selling point  
And the great inventor of course of  
The sweet up and down  
I believe in love  
But think nothing about it  
When its not around  
I believe in love  
I think its just fine  
Oh the sweet up and down  
I believe in love  
And think nothing about it  
When youre not around  
I believe in love  
I think its just fine  
Oh sweet up and down
