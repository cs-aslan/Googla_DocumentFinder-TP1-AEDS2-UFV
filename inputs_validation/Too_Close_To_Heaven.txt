All your trouble will be over so will your pain  
you are gonna see those blue skies bursting right through the rain  
The higher you climb the lower you fall  
You got too close to heaven thats all  
  
Now in the morning you can cry all you want to  
Well spend the whole day weeping  
Right now I want you to lay down your weary head  
and let me see you sleeping  
Youve been walking around baby inflamed and ashamed  
feeling like youre one inch tall  
You got too close to heaven thats all  
  
Youre way too hard on yourself baby  
You got some pretty basic things wrong  
You wouldnt believe me if I told you why I wrote you into this song  
Youre looking at your heart baby and youre calling it black  
But like Icarus and like Saul  
You got too close to heaven thats all  
  
Now I know this hurt youre feeling  
Ive felt these same things too  
Ive got spaces way down deep inside of me that are just the same as you  
You want to wrap your arms around your head turn out the lights  
And roll yourself into a ball  
You got too close to heaven thats all  
  
Are you blinded by the brilliance  
Are you dazzled by the Light  
Why is it I see nothing but emptiness in your tired beaten eyes  
That once were bright  
I know you just cant help but run when you hear that sweet voice call  
You got too close to heaven thats all  
  
I walked a mile for you baby  
So wont you smile for me baby
