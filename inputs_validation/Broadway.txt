In a hotel room just off Times Square its like a closet  
I can watch the dancing class go round  
But in a hotel room that costs as much as my apartment  
I can watch the working class go down  
And its enough to make a crooked man go straight  
Broadway Broadway  
In a hotel room just off Times Square they made a monster  
He was unaware of what went down  
Fattening him up just like calf before a slaughter  
But hed had his fill of hollow town  
And its enough to make a stupid man think straight  
Broadway Broadway  
And its enough to make a crooked man go straight  
Broadway Broadway Broadway Broadway
