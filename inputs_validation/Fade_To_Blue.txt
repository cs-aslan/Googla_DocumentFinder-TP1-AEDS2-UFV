I think I know the way the storys gonna end  
Its getting to the part I hate when heartache close in  
The stage is set its time for me to leave  
Cause I dont want to see the final scene  
  
Fade to blue  
We didnt make it through  
Let the curtain fall  
And fade to blue  
  
We played the part of lovers  
Knew every line by heart  
But sometimes love just cant erase  
Whats written in the stars  
So before the bitter words come crashing down  
Lets leave whats left and the lights go out  
  
And fade to blue  
We didnt make it through  
There wont be a curtain call  
Just fade to blue  
  
Almost happy endings have no way of coming true  
Once the feelings starts to fade to blue  
We didnt make it through  
So let the curtain fall  
Just fade to blue  
And fade to blue
