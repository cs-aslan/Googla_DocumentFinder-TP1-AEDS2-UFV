Look around me look at what Ive found Credits  
Look around me look at what Ive found  
People come and people go  
And thats the way it is   
What does it really matter  
About twenty years after  
Specialise we modernise  
Make changes day to day  
One day up and one day down  
Lets call it fashion  
  
Look around me  can anybody tell me what to do  
Look around me  I only have eyes for you  
Look around me  tumbeling stumbeling upsidedown  
Look around me  Look at what Ive found  
  
Turn and turn tell me what are you seeing  
Clear your mind if you wanna be free  
  
You know the cityslicks and politics  
Now they dont bother me  
As long as theres no ration  
Of love and passion  
Be cool be kind  
But dont be blind  
To all the love Im giving  
Dont waist a minute  
Get into living  
  
Look around me  can anybody tell me what to do  
Look around me  I only have eyes for you  
Look around me  tumbeling stumbeling upsidedown  
Look around me  Look at what Ive found  
  
Dont wait dont be late  
You dont have a second left to hesitate  
Walk talk do it all  
Nothing you can do will ever break the fall  
Turn and turn tell me what are you seeing  
Clear your mind if you wanna be free  
Turn and turn tell me what are you seeing  
Clear your mind if you wanna be free  
  
Everybody  
They need somebody  
Everybody  
Theyre looking at me  
Everybody  
They need somebody  
Everybody  
Theyre looking at me  
  
Oh look around me look at what Ive found  
Look around me  I only have eyes for you  
Oh look around me look at what Ive found  
Look around me  tumbeling stumbeling upsidedown  
Look around me  Look at what Ive found  
Look around me  can anybody tell me what to do  
Look around me  I only have eyes for you  
Look around me  tumbeling stumbeling upsidedown  
Look around me  Look at what Ive found
