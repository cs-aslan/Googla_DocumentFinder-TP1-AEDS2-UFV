I know that you think that this is probably my fault  
We do  
The catty comments and the constant assaults  
Its cool  
I was here once and seen a lot  
So listen if you wanna survive  
  
Inside this High School Miserable  
I never thought Id be invisible  
In this High School Miserable  
You gotta keep being indivisible  
In this High School Miserable  
Dont understand what is happening to me  
In this High School Miserable  
Someone get me back on tv  
  
I thought the girls here would go crazy for me  
I flubbed a test Im clearly getting a D  
I never knew how high my undies would go  
Theres tons of wedgies I didnt know  
Like the the hoodie the Hourglass ow  
The 360 spin that hurt  
The fig leg The bat the bowling pin strike  
The donkey The monkey man am I sore  
I cant believe theirs 28 more  
Neat  
  
Someone get me back on tv
