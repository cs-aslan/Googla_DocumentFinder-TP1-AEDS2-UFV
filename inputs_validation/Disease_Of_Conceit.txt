Whole lot of people crying tonight from the disease of conceit

Conceit is the disease that the doctors got no cure  
Theyve done a lot of research on it but what it is theyre still not sure

Whole lot of people seeing trouble tonight fro the disease of conceit  
Give you delusions of grandeur an evil eye  
Give you the idea that youre too good to die  
The they bury you from head to feet  
From the disease of conceit
