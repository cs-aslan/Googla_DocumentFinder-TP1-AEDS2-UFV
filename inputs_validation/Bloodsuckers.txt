Dont speak to me of morality  
Justice wrong or right  
You dig up the dirt ignore the hurt  
And spit out all your lies  
  
Conscience free as we bleed  
Hypocrisy born from greed  
Dont preach to me of integrity  
Or your legal highs  
  
The judges thrilled  
Hes dressed to kill  
On TV every night  
  
Subliminal so absurd  
Its criminal yet cant be heard  
  
Bloodsuckers how can they sleep at night  
Bloodsuckers nothing but parasites  
  
You will be on the stand today  
They cannot harm you its okay  
But they will destroy your family  
And drag you through hell and tragedy  
  
A circus heading into town  
Complete with cameras and the clowns  
The First Amendment shot to bits  
The world is watching just for kicks  
  
As the day drew close to hand  
For all to view the faceless man  
He put out the lights its sad  
Now whos to blame for that  
  
Intimidate twist what you say  
With their fine points of law  
They lose the case but pontificate  
And then appeal some more  
  
Subliminal its so absurd  
Its criminal but cant be heard  
  
Bloodsuckers how can they sleep at night  
Bloodsuckers nothing but parasites  
  
Bloodsuckers how can they sleep at night  
Bloodsuckers nothing but parasites  
  
Promise to tell the truth  
The whole truth  
And nothing but the truth  
So help me God  
  
You will be on the stand today  
They cannot harm you its okay  
They will destroy your family  
And drag you through hell and tragedy  
  
Bloodsuckers parasites
