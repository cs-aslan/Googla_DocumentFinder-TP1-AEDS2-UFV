Runnin from the rate race  
Just as fast as I can  
Take off my tie so I can breathe  
Me Im going where the fresh airs blowin  
Take a little walk in the country with me  
  
Chorus  
Walk in the country with me  
Watch the sun sinkin down on the trees  
Its gonna do us some good  
To get down in the woods  
Take a little walk in the country with me  
  
Im so sick of all them tv shows  
I need some dirt road under my feet  
Cmon lets point our toes where the red fern grows  
Take a little walk in the country with me  
Come on now  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Walkin the country  
Oh bless my soul  
Just gimme that country road  
Come on now  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Take a little walk in the country with me  
Come on now baby  
Take a little walk in the country with me
