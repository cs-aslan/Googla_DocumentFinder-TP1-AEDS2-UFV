Bring that beat back to me again  
Take me back take me back cant catch me cant catch me  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Take me back take me back cant catch me cant catch me  
  
Ride my bike down that old dirt hill cant catch me  
First time without my trainin wheels  
First time I kissed you I lost my legs cant catch me  
Bring that beat back to me again  
  
Screamin shoutin louder innocence  
Days when all we did would never end  
  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Take me back take me back cant catch me cant catch me  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Take me back take me back cant catch me cant catch me  
  
Smokin on the railroad bridge  
I used to ride my bike down that old dirt hill  
The first time I kissed you I lost my legs  
Bring that beat back to me again  
  
Screamin shoutin louder innocence  
Days when all we did would never end  
  
Screamin down that old dirt hill  
Bring that beat back to me again  
  
Oh when it gets hard  
Thats when the days I remember seem so far  
When I was just a kid thats what I miss  
When I was just a kid thats what I miss  
Take me back Take me back to that beat again  
  
Smokin on the railroad bridge  
Bring that beat back to me again again  
Bring that beat back to me again cant catch me  
Bring that beat back to me again  
First time all we were was good friends  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Bring that beat back to me again cant catch me  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Bring that beat back to me again
