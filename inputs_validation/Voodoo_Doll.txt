You haunt my room in the dead of night  
I see your face in the firelight  
Your hungry kiss I cant forget  
But I wont give it to you yet  
You got moves make a good girl sweat  
You wont catch me in your net  
You work your magic on my blues  
But I aint no slave for you to use  
I wont beg and I wont crawl  
I wont be your voodoo doll  
Baby I wont be your voodoo doll  
Stirring up a potion of colors  
Making me crazy  
You got something I cant leave alone  
Shaking me  
Trembleyoure calling me baby  
Heaven help me turn my heart to stone  
Hey moon man  dont shine on me  
You are dnagerous company  
I got treasure in my chest  
And the price is high for all the rest  
Aint no snake inside my wall  
I wont be your voodoo doll  
Baby I wont be your voodoo doll
