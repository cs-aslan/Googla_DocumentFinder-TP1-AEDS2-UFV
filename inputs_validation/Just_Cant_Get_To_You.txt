Im driving through the rain  
Just to talk to you again  
Please dont run away this time  
Until I say whats on my mind  
  
Tonight I need to stay with you  
This time Im not passing through  
Tear down the walls around your heart  
And though I know its who you are  
  
I just cant get to you girl  
Oh yeah I just cant get to you  
If you wont let me through girl  
Oh no I just cant get to you  
  
You say you really need me here  
So I cant let you disappear  
Even though its getting late  
Somehow I seem to hesitate  
  
Cause I just cant get to you girl  
Oh yeah I just cant get to you  
If you wont let me through girl  
Oh no I just cant get to you  
  
Youre afraid that youll get hurt again  
Yes I knw thats how it feels  
Dont surrender thats no way to win  
Let it go let me in  
  
Cause I just cant get to you  
Just cant get to you girl  
Oh yeah just cant get to you  
If you wont let me through girl  
Oh no I just cant get to you  
  
Just cant get to you girl  
Oh yeah just cant get to you  
You wont let me through girl  
Oh no I just cant get to you
