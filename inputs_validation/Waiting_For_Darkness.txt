Waiting for darkness  
Doesnt anybody see  
  
Deafened by silence  
Doesnt anybody hear  
Im waiting darkness  
Playing with fire  
But theyre screaming  
When theyre burned  
Out of the sunlight  
Hasnt anybody learned  
I know what they find  
Is in their mind  
Its what they want to see  
Spare me from the light  
Here comes the light  
And here Ill stay  
Waiting for darkness  
  
Promise me rebirth  
And then you tear me from the womb  
Give me my freedom  
And then you lock me in a tomb  
  
Im waiting for darkness  
You gotta believe you gotta believe its true  
Im waiting for darkness  
I just cant concieve why darkness is overdue  
  
Who knows the answers  
Is it friend or is it foe  
Dont ask me questions  
There are things you shouldnt know
