Bachelorette you climb on rooftops and you bachelorette  
You can turn dust into champagne  
You even remembered his name  
  
Bachelorette the braves you painted pink for bachelorettes  
You tried to show him that he can  
But you can never rush a man  
  
You must remember  
Youre a car girl  
Youre a star girl  
You are at the door  
The tide will turn  
Theres a window  
  
Bachelorette the things you do girls  
To your bachelorettes  
You thought that  
  
You must remember  
Youre a car girl  
Youre a star girl  
You are at the door  
The tide will turn  
Theres a window  
  
Bachelorette you fly alone now and you cry sometimes  
Theres nothing like it in the world  
Youll go to Paris on your own  
Just bachelorette you climb on rooftops and you bachelorette  
You can turn dust into champagne  
You even yidiedididi
