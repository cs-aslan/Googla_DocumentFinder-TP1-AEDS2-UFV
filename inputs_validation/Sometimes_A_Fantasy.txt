I didnt want to do it but I got too lonely  
I had to call you up in the middle of the night  
I know its awful hard to try to make love long distance  
But I really needed stimulation  
Though it was only my imagination  
  
Its just a fantasy  
Its not the real thing  
Its just a fantasy  
Its not the real thing  
But sometimes a fantasy  
Is all you need  
  
When am I gonna take control get a hold of my emotions  
Why does it only seem to hit me in the middle of the night  
You told me theres a number I can always dial for assistance  
I dont want to deal with outside action  
Only you can give me satisfaction  
  
Its just a fantasy  
Its not the real thing  
Its just a fantasy  
Its not the real thing  
But sometimes a fantasy  
Is all you need  
  
Sure it would be better if I had you here to hold me  
Be better baby but believe me its the next best thing  
Im sure theres many times youve wanted me to hear your secrets  
Dont be afraid to say the words that move me  
Anytime you want to tell them to me  
  
Its just a fantasy  
Its not the real thing  
Its just a fantasy  
Its not the real thing  
But sometimes a fantasy  
Is all you need  
Its just a fantasy  
Its not the real thing  
Its just a fantasy  
Its not the real thing
