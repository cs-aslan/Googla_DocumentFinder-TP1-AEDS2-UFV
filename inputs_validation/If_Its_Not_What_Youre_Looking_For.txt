What you thinkin of  
Darlin youve been with me every day  
But you seem so far away I know  
No its never enough  
To smile and say theres something on your mind  
If you doubt my love  
Know that its here all the time  
If thats not what youre lookin for  
If its not what you need to know  
And if there is somethin more  
Girl Ill give you anything you want  
Girl its been so right  
Nobody could ever love you more  
Ive never been more sure  
Where in the middle of the night  
I hold you near  
And take your heart in my arms  
Swearin all my love  
Thats something youve known from the start  
If thats not what youre lookin for  
If its not what you need to know  
And if there is somethin more  
Ill give you anything you want  
If thats not what youre lookin for  
If its not what you need to know  
Know that youre free to go  
Just be sure that what you want  
Is not what you got  
Hold me oh hold me tonight  
Forever here my love  
So youll never fly away  
Gotta work it out  
Im tryin to hold on to our romance  
Weve only got one more chance I know  
So tell me what its all about  
Oh darlin if theres still a way to your heart  
Ill use all my love to keep us from fallin apart  
If thats not what youre lookin for  
If its not what you need to know  
And if there is somethin more  
Ill give you everything you want  
If thats not what youre lookin for  
If its not what you need to know  
Know that youre free to go  
Just be sure that what you want  
Is not what you got
