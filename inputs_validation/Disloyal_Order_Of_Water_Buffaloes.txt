Im coming apart at the seams  
Pitching myself for leads in other peoples dreams  
Like buzz buzz buzz  
Doc theres a hole where something was  
Doc theres a hole where something was  
  
Fell out of bed  
Butterfly bandage  
But dont worry  
Youll never remember  
Your head is far too blurry  
Put him in the back of a squad car  
Restrain that man  
He needs his head put through a cat scan  
Hey editor Im undeniable  
Hey Doctor Im certifiable  
Oh Im a loose bolt of a complete machine  
What a match  
Im half doomed and youre semisweet  
  
Chorus  
So boycott love  
Detox just to retox  
And Id promise you anything for another shot at life  
And perfect boys  
With their perfect lives  
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy  
  
Wants to hear you sing about tragedy  
  
Oh  
  
Little girl  
You got my staring odd oh  
Or was it just a telescopic camera nod  
Painted doors in the highway  
Truck stop stalls  
Lotlizards scales to deny my rules  
All the rookies leave your badge and your gun on the desk when you leave the
room  
  
Im a loose bolt of a complete machine  
What a match  
I am half doomed and youre semisweet  
  
Chorus  
  
Wants to hear you sing about tragedy  
  
Detox just to retox  
Detox just to retox  
Detox just to retox  
Detox just to retox  
So boycott love  
Boycott love  
  
Chorus  
  
Wants to hear you sing  
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy  
Whoa
