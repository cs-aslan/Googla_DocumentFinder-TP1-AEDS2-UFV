The beautiful days are long gone  
And I cant seem to breathe  
Feels like it hasnt been that long  
Since you walked away from me  
  
Now I can try to act real strong  
But you and I both know  
I still think of you that way  
You should know that  
  
The beautiful lights the starfilled nights  
They dont mean a thing  
Cause you are my star so it dont seem right  
Without you here with me  
  
Now I can try to act real strong  
But you and I both know  
Its hard for me to say  
You were my soul  
  
Now I could say that I dont love you no more  
And I could say that Ive closed the door for our love  
And I could tell you I feel its time for us to go our separate ways  
But baby I just wouldnt be the same  
  
Cause girl your love is still on my brain  
Now when youre in love it takes time to heal  
When someones broken your heart it changes how you feel  
I thought that you would never do me that way  
  
But even after all I still think of you that way  
Now I could say that I dont love you no more  
And I could say that Ive closed the door for our love  
And I could tell you I feel its time for us to go our separate ways  
  
But baby I just wouldnt be the same  
Cause girl your love is still on my brain  
Now love is a game that we both like to play  
When I win or lose if I go or if I stay  
  
Even though I try to hide my broken heart inside  
Girl you know me inside out  
And I cant get you off of my mind  
And I could say that I dont love you no more  
  
And I could say that Ive closed the door for our love  
And I could tell you I feel its time for us to go our separate ways  
But baby I just wouldnt be the same  
Cause girl your love is still on my brain  
La la la la
