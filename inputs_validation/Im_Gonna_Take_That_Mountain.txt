I was born a stubborn soul  
Aint afraid of the great unknown  
Or a winding road thats all uphill  
This is just a stumbling block  
Intimidating wall of rock  
If you think this broken heart will break my will  
  
Im gonna take that mountain  
Aint nothing gonna slow me down  
There aint no way around it  
Gonna leave it level with the ground  
I aint just gonna cross it climb it fight it  
Im gonna take that mountain  
  
Its overwhelming looking up  
Knowing its the challenge of  
Me against this heartache to survive  
I may slip and I may fall  
But even if I have to crawl  
Ill break through to the healing side  
  
Im gonna take that mountain  
Aint nothing gonna slow me down  
There aint no way around it  
Gonna leave it level with the ground  
I aint just gonna cross it climb it fight it  
Im gonna take that mountain
