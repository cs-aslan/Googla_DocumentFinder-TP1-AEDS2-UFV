Oh I should have known  
Youre late again  
No no no no  
And now Im here  
Will you appear  
I dont think so  
  
Every single day  
The same again  
You keep me waiting  
For somebody who dont care at all  
  
Chorus  
I dont wanna wanna  
Be no prima donna  
Tired standing waiting feeling like you never wanna  
Say youre trying trying  
Boy I know youre lying  
Telling me well never be too late cause I was crying  
Youre so tricky tricky  
Yeah now mister wicky  
Now its been an hour  
Make me feeling freaky freaky  
I cant take it take it  
You stole my time and now its  
Now its too late  
Now its too late  
Now its too late  
  
You didnt wait  
What a mistake  
Always too late ah  
  
Always too late  
You didnt wait  
What a mistake ah  
  
I cant take it you can change it  
Why you did so wrong  
  
Why you did it I can change it  
Oh you did so wrong  
  
Where are you today  
You said youd call  
You said youd meet me  
10 oclock it was no shock  
You were not there  
  
Foolish cause I am  
But then again  
I keep on waiting  
For somebody who dont care no no  
  
Chorus  
  
What do I gotta do  
Take some look or two  
To get over you  
  
You treat me like a fool  
Careless is your rule  
Thats why youre so cruel  
  
You didnt wait  
What a mistake  
Always too late ah  
  
Always too late  
You didnt wait  
What a mistake ah  
  
I cant take it what do I gotta do  
You can change it take some look or two  
Why you did so to get over you wrong  
  
Why you did it every single day  
I can change it the same the same again  
Oh you did so do do do do do wrong  
  
Now its too late
