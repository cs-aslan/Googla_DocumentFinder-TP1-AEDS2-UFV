Let there be not one stranger  
To away in a manger  
Let there be not one soul left untold  
Let there be not one face unknown to the face of the one  
Who will gather the foe  
  
For Christs sake its Christmas  
So for Christ sake let everyone know  
They all have the choice so lift up your voice  
Make sure they know by Christmas Eve  
Pray that everyone sees that weve opened the eyes  
That were closed  
For Christs sake its Christmas  
And for Christs sake let everyone know  
  
For Christs sake its Christmas  
So for Christ sake let everyone know  
They all have the choice so lift up your voice  
Make sure they know by Christmas Eve  
Pray that everyone sees that weve opened the eyes  
That were closed  
For Christs sake its Christmas  
And for Christs sake let everyone know
