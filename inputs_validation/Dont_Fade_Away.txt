As I stand at the crossroad  
I see the sun sinking low  
With my cross of indecision  
I cant tell which way to go  
Now I have seen the seven wonders  
And I have sailed the seven seas  
Ive walked and talked with angels  
And danced all night with gypsy queens  
  
All in all its been a rocky road  
Twists and turns along the way  
But I still pray for tomorrow  
All my hopes my dreams  
Dont fade away  
Dont fade away  
  
I have painted many portraits  
Memories of love and pain  
Though cut down by lifes deceptions  
I found the strength to start again  
  
All in all its been a rocky road  
Twists and turns along the way  
But I still pray for tomorrow  
All my hopes my dreams  
Dont fade away  
Dont fade away  
  
Heaven help a man  
Trying to make up his mind  
With the darkness closing in  
I feel Im running out of time  
Shine a light for me  
Help me find the way to go  
And take me where Ive never been before  
  
And so I stand at the crossroad  
Watching the sun sinking low  
With my cross of indecision  
Trying to find the way to go  
  
All in all its been a rocky road  
Twists and turns along the way  
But I still pray for tomorrow  
All my hopes my dreams  
Dont fade away
