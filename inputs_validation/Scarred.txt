To Rise To Fall  
To Hurt To Hate  
To Want To Wait  
To Heal To Save  
  
Cant hear it  
We fear it  
Awareness wont come near it  
  
Distractive  
Reactive  
Disguised in spite of time  
  
I never bared my emotion  
My passion always strong  
I never lost my devotion  
But somewhere fate went wrong  
  
Cant let them rape me again  
Your venoms not family here  
Wont let them fill me with  
Fatalistic remedies  
  
What if the rest of the world  
Was hopelessly blinded by fear  
Where would my sanctity live  
Suddenly nobody cares  
  
Its never enough  
Youre wasting your time  
Isnt there something I could say  
You dont understand  
Youre closing me out  
How can we live our lives this way  
  
You tell me Im wrong  
Im risking my life  
Still I have nothing in return  
I show you my hands  
You dont see the scars  
Maybe youll leave me here to burn  
  
What if the rest of the world  
Was hopelessly drowning in vain  
Where would our self pity run  
Suddenly everyone cares  
  
Blood  
Heal me  
Fear  
Change me  
Belief will always save me  
Blood  
Swearing  
Fear  
Staring  
Conviction made aware  
  
Give up on misery  
Turn your back on dissent  
Leave their distrust behind  
Wash your hands of regret  
  
Do you feel you dont know me anymore  
And do you feel Im afraid of your love  
And how come you dont want me asking  
And how come my hearts not invited  
You say you want everyone happy  
Well were not laughing  
  
And how come you dont understand me  
And how come I dont understand you  
Thirty years say were in this together  
So open your eyes  
  
People in prayer for me  
Everyone there for me  
Sometimes I feel I should face this alone  
My soul exposed  
It calms me to know that I wont  
  
Blood  
Heal me  
Fear  
Change me  
Belief will always save me  
Blood  
Swearing  
Fear  
Staring  
Conviction made aware  
  
Give up on misery  
Turn your back on dissent  
Leave their distrust behind  
Wash your hands of regret  
  
Blood  
Heal me  
Fear  
Change me  
Belief will always save me  
Blood  
Swearing  
Fear  
Staring  
Conviction made aware  
  
Learning from misery  
Staring back at dissent  
Leaving distrust behind  
Im inspired and content
