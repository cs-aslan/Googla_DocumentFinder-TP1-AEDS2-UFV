Im just a Broadway Baby  
Walking off my tired feet  
Pounding Forty Second Street  
To be in a show oh  
  
Blaine  
Broadway Baby  
Learnin how to sing and dance  
Waiting for that one big chance  
To be in a show oh  
  
Blaine and Rachel  
Gee Id like to be on some marquee  
All twinkling lights  
A spark to pierce the dark  
From Battry Park to Washington Heights  
  
Rachel  
Some day maybe  
  
Blaine  
All my dreams will be repaid  
  
Rachel

Making rounds all afternoon  
Eating at a greasy spoon  
To save on my dough  
  
At my tiny flat theres just my cat  
A bed and a chair

All some day maybe
