Oh Daughter dear Daughter  
Take warning from me  
And dont you go marching  
With the NAACP  
  
For theyll rock you and roll you  
And shove you into bed  
And if they steal your nuclear secret  
Youll wish you were dead  
  
Chorus  
Singin too roo la too roo la too roo li ay  
Singin too roo la too roo la too roo li ay  
  
Oh Mother dear Mother  
No Im not afraid  
For Ill go on that march  
And Ill return a virgin maid  
  
With a brick in my handbag  
And a smile on my face  
And barbed wire in my underwear  
To shed off disgrace  
  
Chorus  
  
One day they were marching  
A young man came by  
With a beard on his cheek  
And a gleam in his eye  
  
And before she had time  
To remember her brick  
They were holding a sitdown  
On a nearby hay rig  
  
Chorus  
  
For meeting is pleasure  
And parting is pain  
And if I have a great concert  
Maybe I wont have to sing those folk songs again  
  
Oh Mother dear Mother  
Im stiff and Im sore  
From sleeping three nights  
On a hard classroom floor  
  
Chorus  
  
One day at the briefing  
Shed heard a man say  
Go perfectly limp  
And be carried away  
  
So when this young man suggested  
It was time she was kissed  
She remembered her brief  
And did not resist  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh Mother dear Mother  
No need for distress  
For the young man has left me  
His name and address  
  
And if we win  
Tho a baby there be  
He wont have to march  
Like his dada and me
