The last of Englands spoiled brats  
Grand order of the gutter rats  
A big fish in a public house  
Youre never going to learn to shut your mouth  
A silly pseudo lager lout  
With nothing much to shout about  
Spent hours looking in the mirror  
Trying to perfect the perfect pout  
  
Now take the spotlight  
And pause for your applause  
Well my oh my youre such a big boy  
On a Saturday night  
You try but there is always something  
Something not right inside  
Theres always someone  
Somebody else to take  
The power and the glory  
All for themselves  
  
With you I suffered heaven knows  
Although we never came to blows  
Its just as well cause I can tell  
I would have wiped the floor with you  
You dont like them you dont like us  
You make me laugh but seriously  
I look at you what do I see  
A clapped out Nazi with a blunderbuss  
  
So take the spotlight  
And pause for your applause  
Well my oh my youre such a big boy  
On a Saturday night  
You try but there is always something  
Something not right inside  
Theres always someone  
Somebody else to take  
The power and the glory  
All for themselves  
  
So take the stage and  
Lets have a great big hand now  
My oh my youre such a big boy  
On a Saturday night  
Thats when you really know they love you  
When somebody else will feed your face  
And kiss your arse  
And wonder where the time flew past  
Oh yes my darlings such a  
Big boy on a Saturday night
