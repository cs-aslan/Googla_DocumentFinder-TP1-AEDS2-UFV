Is the magic still there whenever I hold you  
Do these lips of mine send chills down your spine  
Like they used to  
Or is it slipping away Baby come out and say  
Im asking because I care  
I just need to know is the magic still there  
Oh I still recall our first time together  
Oh we kissed and we touched we couldnt get enough of each other  
And when we said goodnight beneath that old porch light  
It left us wanting more  
But Im wondering now if time has somehow  
Changed what we felt before  
Is the magic still there whenever I hold you  
Do these lips of mine send chills down your spine  
Like they used to  
Or is it slipping away Baby come out and say  
Im asking because I care  
I just need to know is the magic still there  
Am I still the one that you daydream of  
When we turn out the light is there fire in the night  
When we make love  
Dont want to take you for granted so baby Im askin  
Only because I care  
I just want to know  
Is the magic still there whenever I hold you  
Do these lips of mine send chills down your spine  
Like they used to  
Or is it slipping away Baby come out and say  
Im asking because I care  
I just need to know is the magic still there  
Is the magic still there is the magic still there
