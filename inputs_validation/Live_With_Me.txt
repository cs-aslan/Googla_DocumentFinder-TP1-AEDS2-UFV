I got nasty habits I take tea at three  
Yes and the meat I eat for dinner  
Must be hung up for a week  
My best friend he shoots water rats  
And feeds them to his geese  
Doncha think theres a place for you  
In between the sheets  
  
Come on now honey  
We can build a home for three  
Come on now honey  
Dont you want to live with me  
  
And theres a score of harebrained children  
Theyre all locked in the nursery  
They got earphone heads they got dirty necks  
Theyre so 20th century  
Well they queue up for the bathroom  
Round about 735  
Doncha think we need a womans touch to make it come alive  
  
Youd look good pram pushing  
Down the high street  
Come on now honey  
Dont you want to live with me  
  
Whoa the servants theyre so helpful dear  
The cook she is a whore  
Yes the butler has a place for her  
Behind the pantry door  
The maid shes French shes got no sense  
Shes wild for Crazy Horse  
And when she strips the chauffeur flips  
The footmans eyes get crossed  
  
Doncha think theres a place for us  
Right across the street  
Doncha think theres a place for you  
In between the sheets
