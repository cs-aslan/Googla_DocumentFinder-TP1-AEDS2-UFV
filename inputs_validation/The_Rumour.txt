This is the last time  
Ill look across this table  
And try to face a feeling I dont even recognize  
This is a sad hand  
That reached across and touched you  
When all wed built around us came crashing to the ground  
  
There was a tide turning  
Somewhere deep inside us  
When all these years together seem lost behind my tears  
Oh there were good times  
But in between the dog days  
I felt the pain of rumour whisper in my ears  
  
But I still tried to love you  
I still tried to care  
Still tried to hold on with the power of my prayers  
But you cant fight the rumour  
You cant argue with you heart no  
Once the rumour spreads once the rumour spreads  
Once the rumour spreads the truth is just a thing of the past  
  
As the rain falls  
I listen to the radio  
And try to memorize the words to Georgia On My Mind  
But were no old song  
We never stood the test of time  
The lies inside the rumour left trust so far behind  
  
But I still tried to love you  
I still tried to care  
Still tried to hold on with the power of my prayers  
But you cant fight the rumour  
You cant argue with you heart no  
Once the rumour spreads once the rumour spreads  
Once the rumour spreads the truth is just a thing of the past  
  
And when we say goodbye  
Be sure to look me in the eye  
And know the real secret  
Was the thing we didnt have to hide  
  
But I still tried to love you  
I still tried to care  
Still tried to hold on with the power of my prayers  
But you cant fight the rumour  
You cant argue with you heart no  
Once the rumour spreads once the rumour spreads  
Once the rumour spreads the truth is just a thing of the past  
Once the rumour spreads
