Life is timeless days are long when youre young  
You used to fall in love with everyone  
Any guitar and any bass drum  
Life is a drink and you get drunk when youre young  
Life is new and theres things to be done  
You cant wait to be grown up  
Acceptance into the capital world  
You pull on some weed then you pull on someone when youre young  
  
But you find out life isnt like that  
Its so hard to comprehend  
Why you set up your dreams to have them smashed in the end  
  
But you dont mind youve got time on your side  
And theyre never gonna make you stand in line  
Youre just waiting for the right time  
  
Youre fearless and brave you cant be stopped when youre young  
  
You swear youre never ever gonna work for someone  
No corporations for the new age sons  
Tears of rage roll down your face  
But still you say its fun  
  
And you find out life isnt like that  
Its so hard to understand  
Why the world is your oyster but your futures a clam  
  
Its got you in its grip before your born  
Its done with the use of a dice and a board  
They let you think youre king but youre really a pawn  
  
Youre fearless and brave you cant be stopped when youre young  
You used to fall in love with everyone  
Any guitar and any bass drum
