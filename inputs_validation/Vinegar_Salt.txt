Ilike the things that you hate  
And youhate the things that I like  
But it hurts  
Honestys your church  
But sometimes  
Its better to lie  
Iam the vinegar and salt  
And youare the oil that dissolves  
My frustration  
Honestys limitation  
But sometimes  
Its better to lie  
I am the vinegar and salt  
And you are the oil that dissolves my frustrations  
Limitations  
But sometimes  
I dont dare to ask why
