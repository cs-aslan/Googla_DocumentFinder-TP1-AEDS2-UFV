Its raining again  
Oh no my loves at an end  
Oh no its raining again  
And you know its hard to pretend  
Oh no its raining again  
Too bad Im losing a friend  
Oh no its raining again  
Oh will my heart ever mend  
Oh no its raining again  
Youre old enough some people say  
To read the signs and walk away  
Its only time that heals the pain  
And makes the sun come out again  
Its raining again  
Oh no my loves at an end  
Oh no its raining again  
Too bad Im losing a friend  
  
Cmon you little fighter  
No need to get uptighter  
Cmon you little fighter  
And get back up again  
Oh get back up again  
Fill your heart again
