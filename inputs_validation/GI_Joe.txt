Well he smoked those Camel cigarettes about three packs a day  
Nicotine stains on his fingers when hed stretch them out to play  
That old Midnight special is one he loved to do  
Then hed sing Im walking the floor over you  
  
TV preachers and welfare checks for him just had no place  
But hed take his time to tune real good when he sang  
Amazing Grace Hed say boys Im old and crazy but I still give a damn  
And I still think the boys got screwed over in Vietnam  
  
Hed drag out that old uniform  
And say they used to call me slim  
He never could get it buttoned up  
But the pride looked good on him  
He still feels the way he felt  
Over forty years ago  
Heres to the old man  
Heres to GI Joe  
  
He only sang the old songs hes standing still in time  
My Phillipino baby right there on his mind  
Then hed talk about the big one the war we didnt lose  
Hed pick a little bit like Travis ReEnlistment blues  
  
Heres to my old man  
And all the GI Joes
