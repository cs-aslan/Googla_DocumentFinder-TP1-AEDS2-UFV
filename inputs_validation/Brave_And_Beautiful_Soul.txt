Well heres to you all cynical  
Heres the ammunition that you need  
Heres another song about empathy  
Please yourself think what you will  
  
In her light that shines I fall apart  
Fall apart  
Her life is blessed and I dont understand  
Her brave and beautiful soul  
Brave and beautiful soul  
  
Heres to you all sensible  
Never taking time to stand for something  
Hey the future always come round here too soon  
I just cant leave here doing nothing  
  
In her light that shines I fall apart  
Fall apart  
In her darkness how she wins my heart  
Her brave and beautiful soul  
Brave and beautiful soul  
  
An emotional response  
Sometimes better than an intellectual one  
  
In her light that shines I fall apart  
Fall apart  
Her life is blessed and I dont understand  
Her brave and beautiful soul  
Brave and beautiful soul
