Tryin to make it back  
To my old home town  
Ive been driving since  
The break of dawn  
Got a feeling like a fever  
Burning in my brain  
When I see her  
Itll be all gone  
  
Pacific highway  
Getting nearer now  
And I feel like  
The dream is coming true  
Pacific highway  
Getting closer now  
I dont need directions  
To find my way back to you  
  
Take another turning  
On the old creek road  
Making sure I dont get lost  
Im hoping to hell  
My tacos reading right  
Get ahead no matter  
What the cost  
  
Tryin to take it easy  
On the old home stretch  
But city limits come into sight  
Im getting ready for my Betty  
God how I missed that girl  
Were rocknrollin  
Through the night  
  
I dont need directions  
To find my way back to you  
  
I only got five more miles yeah  
Only four more miles yeah  
I only got three miles two miles  
One mile to go
