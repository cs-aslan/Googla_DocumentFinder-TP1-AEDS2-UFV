You want to love with me love with me then  
  
I only ask that you still be my friend  
  
For there are many where friendships unknown  
  
They live together but really alone  
  
And the days go their ways in silence  
  
Tense hours of woe  
  
We do not mean to have it so  
  
I know that sometimes Im harder to love  
  
I thrash out blindly like nothings thought of  
  
So wont you help me to help you be sure  
  
God only knows that I want to be pure  
  
But the world keeps it promise daily to let me down  
  
But it cant hide what I have found  
  
So I will love you and love you I do  
  
Its not complete yet but you know were not through  
  
And the days go their ways in blessings  
  
Moments of truth  
  
We truly dare not waste our youth  
  
You wanna love with me love with me then
