Gangster  
  
Verse 1  
I though it was love  
Didnt wanna admit that  
When I looked back  
It was lust  
Too bad I had to learn a lesson  
Theyre against me  
You were with me  
But you never let your old thang go  
I dont care to know why  
Girl I guess some things  
Cant be explained  
  
Chorus  
It is what it is what it is  
I dont know what to call it  
Cause Im feelin something else Im feeling something else  
  
It is what it is what it is  
Just dont let yourself get caught up uh huh  
When its really something else  
  
Verse 2  
Know that is okay  
Felt something going on  
For every time that I thought it uh  
Girl I bet thats what it was  
Called myself being down for you ice cold

Before I knew you I already knew you  
How you get down uh  
But if thats your thang babe
