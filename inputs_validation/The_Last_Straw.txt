Hotel hobbies padding dawns hollow corridors  
A typewriter cackles out a stream of memories  
  
Drying out a conscience evicting a nightmare  
Opening the doors for the dreams to come home  
  
We live out lives in private shells  
Ignore our senses and fool ourselves  
To thinking that out there theres someone else cares  
Someone to answer all our prayers all our prayers  
  
Are we too far gone are we so irresponsible  
Have we lost our balls or do we just not care  
Were terminal cases that keep talking medicine  
Pretending the end isnt quite that near  
We make futile gestures act to the cameras  
With our made up faces and pr smiles  
And when the angel comes down down to deliver us  
Well find out that after all were only men of straw  
  
But everything is still the same  
Passing the time passing the blame  
We carry on in the same old way  
Well find out we left it too late one day to say what we meant to say  
  
Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the water  
Those problems seem to arise the ones you never really thought of  
The feeling you get is similar to something like drowning  
Out of your mind youre out of your depth you should have taken soundings  
Clutching at straws were clutching at straws were clutching at straws  
  
And if you ever come across us dont give us your sympathy  
You can buy us a drink and just shake our hands  
And youll recognise by the reflection in our eyes that deep down inside were
all one and the same  
  
Were clutching at straws  
Were still drowning  
Clutching at straws  
Were still drowning yeah clutching at straws  
Im still drowning  
Were clutching at straws  
Im still drowning
