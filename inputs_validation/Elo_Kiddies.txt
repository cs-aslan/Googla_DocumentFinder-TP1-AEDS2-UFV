Elo kiddies elo kiddies  
What ya gonna do when the lights start shining  
Elo kiddies elo kiddies  
What ya gonna do when your heads exploding  
  
So you missed some school  
You know schools for fools  
Today money rules  
And everybody steals it  
  
Elo kiddies elo kiddies  
What ya gonna do when your stomachs burning  
Elo kiddies elo kiddies  
What ya gonna do when your guts start churning  
  
You lead a life of crime  
You gotta go unwind  
You havent got much time  
You know theyre out to get you  
  
Elo kiddies elo kiddies  
What ya gonna do when you get religion  
Elo kiddies elo kiddies  
Hope you didnt get it on the television
