Lir Ive had time to write a book  
About the way you act and look  
But I havent got a paragraph  
Words are always getting in my way  
Anyway I love you  
Thats all I have to tell you  
Thats all Ive got to say  
  
And now Id like to make a speech  
About the love that touches each  
But stumbling I would make you laugh  
I feel as though my tongue were made of clay  
Anyway I love you  
Thats all I have to tell you  
  
Im not a man of poetry  
Music isnt one with me  
It runs from me  
It runs from me  
Duet  
Lir And I tried to write a symphony  
Amalthea Once when I was searching  
Lir But I lost the melody  
Amalthea Somewhere out of reach  
Lir Alas I only finished half  
Amalthea Far away  
Lir And finish I suppose I never may  
Amalthea In a place I could not find  
Lir Anyway I love you  
Amalthea Or heart obey  
Lir Thats all I have to tell you  
Amalthea Now that Im a woman  
Lir Thats all Ive got to say  
Amalthea Now I know the way  
Lir Thats all Ive got to say  
Amalthea Now I know the way  
Together Thats all Ive got to say
