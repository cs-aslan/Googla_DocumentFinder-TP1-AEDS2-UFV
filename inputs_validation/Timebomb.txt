I got a time bomb in my mind Mom  
I hear it ticking but I dont know why  
I call the police but they dont like me  
I hear em whispering when I walk by  
  
I got a land mine in my bloodline  
Im not immune to getting blown apart  
Shes like a claymore thats what shes there for  
Shes waiting round here to get blown apart  
  
Having her on my brains like getting hit by a train  
Shes gonna kill me oh Celeste oh Celeste  
Oh Celeste oh Celeste  
  
I got a time bomb in my mind Mom  
Its gonna go off but I dont know when  
I need a doctor to extract her  
I got a feeling shed get right back in again  
  
I got a time bomb in my mind Mom  
I got it badly for a sticklegged girl  
Shes gonna kill me and I dont mean softly  
I got it badly for a sticklegged girl  
  
Having her on my brains getting hit by a train  
Shes gonna kill me oh Celeste oh Celeste  
Oh Celeste oh Celeste  
  
Oh Celeste
