Me and Mrs Jones we got a thing going on  
We both know that its wrong  
But its much too strong to let it go now  
  
We meet every day at the same cafe  
Sixthirty I know shell be there  
Holding hands making all kinds of plans  
While the jukebox plays our favorite song  
  
Me and Mrs Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones  
We got a thing going on  
We both know that its wrong  
But its much too strong to let it go now  
  
We gotta be extra careful  
That we dont build our hopes too high  
Cause shes got her own obligations and so do I  
Me and Mrs Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones  
  
Well its time for us to be leaving  
And it hurts so much it hurts so much inside  
And now shell go her way Ill go mine  
But tomorrow well meet at the same place the same time  
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones  
Same place  
We both know that its wrong  
Same time  
Everyday at the same place  
Same place  
We got a thing going on you know its wrong  
Same time  
But its much too wrong  
Same place  
Me and Mrs Jones
