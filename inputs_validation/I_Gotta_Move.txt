I dont want to get left behind  
Gonna love my baby all the time  
If I dont want to get left alone  
I gotta move on down my babys home  
And if my baby isnt there  
Im gonna fill my gap and comb my hair  
Gotta move gotta move  
Gotta move gotta move  
  
All my life Ive had to move  
Always failed to stay in school  
If I moved down  road  
Sometimes I wished Id stayed at home  
Where Im going no one knows  
Only know I gotta go  
You gotta move gotta move  
Gotta move gotta move  
  
I dont want to get left behind  
Gonna love my baby all the time  
If I dont want to get left alone  
I gotta move on down my babys home  
And if baby isnt there  
Im gonna brush my boots and comb my hair  
I gotta move gotta move  
I gotta move gotta move
