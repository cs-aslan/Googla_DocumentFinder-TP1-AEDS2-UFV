Well it must have been good  
Cause you said it was love  
I guess the day you left me  
It wasnt good enough  
Now youre calling my number  
Say you want to come back  
Oh baby baby  
Its too late for that  
Cause when you see me therell be somebody new by my side  
Somebody who is sure he is mine  
  
Chorus  
When you see the smile on his face  
Just remember baby  
Couldve been you couldve been you  
When hes standing there in your place  
I hate to say it baby  
Couldve been you  
  
Guess I shouldve been cool  
Maybe I was too kind  
When loving me was easy  
You were hard to find  
When I cried over you baby  
How the teardrops burned  
Oh baby baby  
Now the tables turned  
So if those tears start falling when you see us walking by  
I hope you wont forget who said goodbye  
  
Chorus  
  
Shouldve been you but you threw it all away  
Couldve been you standing here today  
So if those tears start falling when you see us walking by  
I hope you wont forget who said goodbye  
You said goodbye  
  
Chorus x 2
