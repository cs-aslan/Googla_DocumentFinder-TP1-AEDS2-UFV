Livin in the fast lane is easy  
Till you run out of road  
Friends will turn to strangers  
When youre out of control  
A slip of the tongue when  
Its done is often hard to  
See it through  
So never let your words be lies  
Or theyll come looking for you  
  
Its a hard life to love  
  
For the price of glory you left  
And threw your fortunes away  
Never really cared too much for  
The job or the pay  
  
Youre standing in the rain with  
No cover but you never complain  
Youre an angry young man face to  
Face but your mirrors insane  
Its a hard life to love  
  
Im simply refusing a part in your world  
And I see how it burns  
See how it burns  
And youre simply denying the fact  
That youre blind and I see no more  
I see red  I only see red  
  
Think of all the times I was  
Hurting but you felt no pain  
Think of all the lies you told me  
Again and again  
And still you see the truth  
From those who continue to lie  
And now youre seeking life  
From those who are living to die  
Its a hard life to love  
  
Im simply refusing a part in your world  
And I see how it burns  
See how it burns  
And youre simply denying the fact  
That youre blind and I see no more  
I see red  I only see red  
  
Livin in the fast lane aint easy  
When you run out of road  
Friends will turn to strangers  
When youve nowhere to go  
Dont give a damn when youre lost  
Cause youll die from it all  
Laws were made to be broken  
And you do it for the thrill of it all  
Its a hard life to love  
Its a hard life to love
