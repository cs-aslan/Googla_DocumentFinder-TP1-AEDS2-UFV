ZRo  
How does it feel when they dont believe anything you say  
Always got to show and prove yourself every single day  
Man this aint living nothing but drama all through the week  
And if they dont respect my words why they want me to speak  
Im feeling worse even though I put my family first  
Im shedding tears cause I feel as if Im headed to the dirt  
Ghetto on me stressed out my mama buried aint dead  
Aint got no partners cause my partners put a price on my head  
Have you ever told a lie to make the drama stop  
Watch the world you love turn against you no more family problems  
How does it feel to be the black sheep how does it feel to  
Victimized yourself for one time and evermore after the g  
And focus on the dresser bad liquor approaching fast  
Sitting around waiting on death to come watching time pass  
My life my life falls under the wicked and shife  
I wonder where I got to sleep tonight my nigga how does it feel  
Chorus  2x  
When you cant make the pain stop  
Walking in the rain so your tears can blend in with the rain drops  
When your kin people done turned they back  
Every family that I know is just like that my nigga how does it feel  
ZRo  
I could of sworn I wasnt the only person on this earth  
But it seems that Ive been one deep ever since the day of my birth  
Im sick and tired of being lonely in this crooked land people think  
Im tripping cause of my facial expressions but they dont understand  
24 years old and use to frowning daily trying to figure out  
Who was the friend who was the foes you know its bout to drive me crazy  
Mama tell Jesus I cant handle the pressure look at  
The way they do me down here my vision is ZRo on the stretcher  
Cant I breed in peace wont yall leave me alone  
Like Makavelli I close my eyes and picture home  
Bout a Mo City block a place that aint no glocks and it aint no sin  
No longer watching my back for the retaliation  
How does it feel to wish that you was dead I can  
Answer that cause many of nights my pistols to my head  
But Im so scared my life my life 360 degrees  
Of being neglected stressing enemies my nigga how does it feel  
Chorus  2x  
ZRo  
How does it feel when these busters try to take your life  
Lord knows I dont want to pull my 45  
But see Ima survive nigga dont make me use my tool  
Get some of that bomb green from Tom fore I lose my cool  
How can I make to it to the top Im like a crab in a bucket  
It got me hostile I see my pistol grab it and bust it  
Nigga get off me I dont love nan one of yall  
Im coming forward you pen and killing every one of yall  
Call me ceaser get em while they sleeping Im grim reaping  
Bust and never saw me coming left him with his blood seeping  
Im a soldier recognize the signs of the time  
It seems its kill or be killed up in this stony life of mine  
Can you feel it when its hard to rub against a real nigga  
How does it feel to see my blood spill my nigga  
My life my life feel like Im running out of time  
Till its over catch me running with my nine how does it feel  
Chorus  4x
