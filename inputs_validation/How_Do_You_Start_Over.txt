How do you start over again  
Tell me where do you begin  
What does a loser do  
When love seems lost  
When bridges are burning  
can they still be crossed  
  
How do you start overover again  
How do you begin whats already been  
  
When love was youngwe knew our love would last  
But now our dreams are somewhere in the past  
And I dont know which way to go  
I only know I miss you so  
And wish somehow it could be  
the way it was with you and me  
Remember when  
How do you start overover again  
  
How do you make love when the feeling is gone  
How do you make wrong rightwhen right seems so wrong  
  
Just tell me you love me and then  
We can start over over again
