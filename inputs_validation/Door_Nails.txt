These two shots are for Derrick  
For Rifle not the handgun  
For Coffee and Cigarettes  
Give It Back  
  
You know suicide isnt painless  
When you leave everyone in pain  
Two shots will never go down the same  
  
This beatings for Jimmy  
For Ultimate Devotion  
For your Mind Of My Own  
Bring Out Your Dead  
  
Sedated flagellated  
You were the one most loved and hated  
Thanks for all that carpet and your songs  
  
This Petrons for Jason  
This lagers for Andy  
And these doses are for Bomber  
And this fix is for Bradley  
This ritalins for Lumpy  
And this speedballs for Friday  
This nitrous hit is for Lynn and best friend Dobbs  
  
This bowl is for my mom  
For drinking more than I did  
For posting bail for me in New York  
  
And in Hollywood that first time  
And that joint we smoked was the worst time  
Cause doing drugs with parents is just wrong  
  
This Petrons for Jason  
This lagers for Andy  
And these doses are for Bomber  
And this fix is for Bradley  
This song is for winning losers  
Its for lucky substance abusers  
The ones who left their black marks on us all
