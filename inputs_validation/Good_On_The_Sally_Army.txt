Sunday finds me curled in bed  
I can hear the Sally Army in the old town square  
I can hear their brass and choruss they fill the air  
And I wonder why they do it when theres noone ever there  
Moments later out of bed goes me and Im gazing out the window in the morning
light  
And the lasses in their bonnets makes a pretty sight  
And I thought if thats an army its a funny way to fight  
But its an empty life if youve got no purpose  
And your lost and feel your on your own  
And if I told my work mates theyd have said Id gone barmy  
When I ran down the stair to join the Salvation Army  
Oh it was love that I could depend upon  
And all of my emptiness had gone  
Babababbababababa  
Oh its an empty life if youve got no purpose  
And your lost and feel your on your own  
If I told my work mates theyd have said Id gone barmy  
When I ran down the stair to join the Salvation Army  
Oh it was love that I could depend upon  
And all of my emptiness had gone  
Some years later looking back at me  
I believe Ive found the answer and Id like to say  
Youve need never be alone when Gods a prayer away  
And Hell fill you with his sunshine if your life is cold and grey
