Hey teacher whatcha trying to do  
Im gettin tired livin in this zoo  
You slap my face and you knock me down  
You beat my head right in the ground  
I never ever felt this way before  
I cant take it no more  
  
So give the radio  
Yeah give the radio back  
Give the radio back to the maniacs to the maniacs  
  
Well theres a party going on outside  
All my friends got ya terrified

Dont break up this blownout symphony  
You think Im wasting all my precious time  
You say my music oughta be a crime
