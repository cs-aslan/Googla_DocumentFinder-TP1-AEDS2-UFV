Phone calls and taxirides  
And somebodys leaving  
Misunderstandings get out of control  
And the right words get left  
And the wrong words get spoken  
Hes gone but not your pride  
Chorus  
Not much can help  
The full heart thats breaking  
Cant find the words  
And you cant hide the feelings  
And its down to the bone  
To the heart of the matter  
Youre free free as stone  
Look at you now  
Youre the picture of sorrow  
Head in your hands  
Like a scene from a movie  
And all of the things  
That seemed so important  
Are leaves and are blowing away  
Chorus  
Nothing can help  
The full heart thats breaking  
You cant find the words  
And you cant hide the feelings  
And its down to the bone  
To the heart of the matter  
Youre free free as stone  
Walk through this town  
On a cold Sunday morning  
Soldiers in uniforms  
Guns in their hands  
The world all caught up  
With barbed wire fences  
Im free Im free as stone  
Chorus  
Oh nothing can help  
The full heart thats breaking  
Wont find the words  
And you cant hide the feelings  
And its down to bone  
To the heart of the matter  
Youre free free as stone  
Youre free free as stone
