Been away from you for much too long  
Been away but now Im back where I belong  
Believed while I was gone away  
But I do just fine  
But I couldnt get the music of my mind  
And I couldnt leave the needing you behind  
  
Read the word from the page  
Free the bird from the cage  
Just go out there and face  
What you did before  
Did it once  
You can do it once more  
Yeah  
  
Chorus   
Coming back for one more bite of the apple  
Tastes as sweet  
Its the nectar of life  
And you know that its right  
Cause you know youre not out there alone  
And that one more bite of the apple is all  
You gonna need to bring it home  
  
I couldnt count the chances that Ive lost  
Couldnt count the chances or the cost  
But I cant help thinking about the days  
Of way back when  
And I know I wanna taste them once again  
Yes I know I wanna taste them once again  
  
Got some things to be said  
Going round in my head  
Time to get out of bed  
Cause Ive slept too long  
And I know theres a place I belong  
Yeah  
  
Chorus   
  
Was a time that I wont ever forget  
They were times that I will never regret  
Ive been thinking about those days  
Since way back when  
And thinking I could bring back again  
Just maybe I could bring them back again  
  
One more dance in the night  
One more chance to get it right  
One more grab at the brass ring thats flying by  
One more toast to the mud in your eye  
Yeah  
  
Chorus   
  
Ill be back  
And sitting up high on the saddle  
All I want  
Is to do it once more  
Let me get through that door  
Cause I still do believe that I can  
Want that one more bite of the apple  
And just a chance to taste it once again  
  
Been around the world a time or two  
Everywhere Ive been I thought of me and you  
I was hoping youd remember how it used to be  
And maybe that youd still remember me  
And that apple just as sweet as it could be  
Reach right up and pick one of that apple tree
