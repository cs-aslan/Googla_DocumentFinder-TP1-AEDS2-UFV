I tied my bandanatook my pack from the floor  
You were still sleepingas I stood at the door  
Once more I was heading toGod only knows where  
Thats when it hit meI was already there  
Chorus  
I could ramblea thousand miles or more  
Never find the light Ive seen in your eyes before  
You gave me the freedom to go on my own way  
But you gave me much moreyou gave me the freedom to stay  
Why keep on runningjust to wish on a star  
Searching for Heavenwhen I know where you are  
Life is just emptywhen youre walking alone  
So wherever were going girlLord its good to be at home  
Chorus
