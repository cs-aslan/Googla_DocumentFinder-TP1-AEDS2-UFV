Ah she danced like a floozie in a hot tub of guava  
Achin round the scene you know shes hip to her mantra  
He was a meditated fucker all strungout on Sinatra  
Hitting van Winkle like there aint no tomorra  
  
I saw van Winkle show up on the scene  
I cant remember when I saw thats hes been doing all the  
Sketches of Winkle crying to the heavens in a fit of rage  
Sketches of Winkle keep little humans locked up in a cage  
Sketches of Winkle I think I love her but she dont love me  
Sketches of Winkle why dont you love me girl  
  
She drained all the fluid from the sink in the kitchen  
Achin round these all shes doin is bitchin  
Steven said he went and bought a new pair of mittens  
Mean Ween cut me and he said he was kidding  
  
I saw van Winkle show up on the scene  
I cant remember when I saw thats hes been doing all the  
Sketches of Winkle crying to the heavens in a fit of rage  
Sketches of Winkle keep little humans locked up in a cage  
Sketches of Winkle I think I love her but she dont love me  
Sketches of Winkle why dont you love me girl  
  
Rip van Winkle rip rip Rip van Winkle  
Rip van Winkle rip rip Rip van Winkle  
Rip van Winkle rip rip Rip van Winkle
