Lazy lightnin sleepy fire in your eyes its like desire in disguise  
I keep on tryin but I I cant get through  
Lazy lightnin Id like to find the proper potion  
Thats gonna capture your emotion  
Youre right beside me but I I cant get through  
Youre a loop of lazy lightnin just a loop of lazy lightnin  
Must admit youre kinda frightnin but you really get me high  
So exciting when I hear your velvet thunder  
You seem so near I start to wonder  
Would you come closer if if I asked you to  
So inviting the way youre messing with my reason  
Its an exception but its pleasing  
Tell me a lie and I will swear Ill swear its true  
Youre a loop of lazy lightnin  
Lazy lightnin  
Just a loop of lazy lightnin  
Lazy lightnin  
Must admit youre kinda frightening  
Just a loop of lazy lightnin  
Put the fire in my eyes  
Lightnin  
Put the fire every time  
Lightnin  
Put the fire in my heart  
Lightnin  
Well come on lazy lightnin  
Just a loop of lazy lightnin  
Misty lightning well you always electrify me  
Someday I know youll satisfy me  
And all that lightnin will be my lightnin too  
My lightnin too  
My lightnin too  
Just a loop of lazy lightnin  
My lightnin too  
My lightnin too  
My lightnin too  
Just a loop of lazy lightnin  
My lightnin too  
My lightnin too  
My lightnin too  
Oh come on lazy lightnin  
My lightnin too
