Forward yesterday makes me wanna stay  
What they said was real makes me wanna steal  
Living under house guess Im living Im a mouse  
Alls I gots is time got no meaning just a rhyme  
  
Take time with a wounded hand cause it likes to heal  
Take time with a wounded hand cause I like to steal  
Take time with a wounded hand cause it likes to heal  
I like to steal  
  
Im half the man I used to be this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray  
  
Feeling uninspired think Ill start a fire  
Everybody run bobbys got a gun  
Think youre kinda neat then she tells me Im a creep  
Friends dont mean a thing guess Ill leave it up to me  
  
Take time with a wounded hand cause it likes to heal  
Take time with a wounded hand guess I like to steal  
Take time with a wounded hand cause it likes to heal  
I like to steal  
  
Im half the man I used to be this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray  
Angst
