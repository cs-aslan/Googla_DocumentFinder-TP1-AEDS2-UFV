You walked in  
I woke up  
Ive never seen a pretty girl look so tough baby  
You got that look  
Color you peach and black  
Color me taken aback  
Crucial  
I think I wantcha  
  
Youve got the look  
Youve got the hook  
you shonuf do be cookin in my book  
Your face is jammin  
Your bodys heck a slammin  
If love is good  
Lets get to rammin  
You got the look  
You got the look  
  
You got the look  
You must a took  
A whole hour just to make up your face baby  
Closin time ugly lights  
Everybodys inspected  
But you are a natural beauty unaffected  
Did I say an hour  
My face is red  
I stand corrected  
  
You walked in  
I woke up  
Ive never seen a pretty girl look so tough baby  
You got that look  
Yes you do  
Color you peach and black  
Color me taken aback  
Baby  
Crucial  
I think I wantcha
