Whats somebody like you doing in a place like this  
Say did you come alone or did you bring all your friends  
Say whats your name what you drinking  
I think I know what youre thinking  
Baby whats your sign tell me yours Ill tell you mine  
Say whats somebody like you doing in a place like this  
One two three come one  
  
Chorus  
Ill never be the same if we ever meet again  
Wont let you get away said if we ever meet again  
This free falls got me so  
Kiss me all night dont ever let me go  
Ill never be the same  
If we ever meet again  
  
Say if we ever meet again  
  
Do you come here much I swear Ive seen your face before  
Hope you dont see me blush but I cant help but want you more more  
Baby tell me whats your story  
I aint shy dont you worry  
Im flirting with my eyes wanna leave with you tonight  
So do you come here much I gotta see your face some more some more  
  
Cause baby I  
  
Chorus  
  
If we ever meet again  
Ill have so much more to say if we ever meet again  
  
If we ever meet again  
I wont let you go away said if we ever meet again  
  
If we ever meet again  
Ill have so much more to say say if we ever meet again  
  
If we ever ever meet again  
I wont let you go away  
  
Chorus x2
