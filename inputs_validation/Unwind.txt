Verse  
I hide my pain like the rest of them  
Thats why Im always laughing  
Im troubled Im brilliant and miserable too  
Thats why I am so funny  
I swallow down all my fears  
With a bottle made of silver  
Ive only been here for 27 years  
But already my life is over  
  
Chorus 1  
And I need to unwind yes and I  
I need to unwind yes and I  
Want all the time  
To be loved to unwind  
  
Verse 2  
My life is like a fairytale  
That nobody believes in  
I cant remember anything  
Not the people not the places Ive been  
Just one more day you can make it babe  
Thats what I tell myself  
And everything that I love in life  
It is killing me cause its bad for my health
