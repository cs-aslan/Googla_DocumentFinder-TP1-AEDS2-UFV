Id rather be blue thinking of you  
Id rather be blue over you  
Than be happy with somebody else  
  
Im crazy about ya without ya  
For you Im strong  
I cant do without ya  
Ouchamagoucha dont stay too long  
  
I need a little ah little ooh little oh  
And Im knocking on wood  
Honey hurry up hurry up hurry up  
Its so hard to be good  
  
Id rather be blue thinking of you  
Id rather be blue over you  
Than be happy with somebody else  
  
Will I be good Will I be bad  
Dont be a fool you fool  
My little flat Im turning that  
Into a Sunday school  
  
While youre away Im here to say  
Therell be no ice man there  
Singing the blues Im gonna use  
Nothing but Frigidaire  
  
Id rather be blue thinking of you  
Id rather be blue over you  
Than be happy with somebody else  
  
Blue over you  
Id rather be blue over you  
Than be Haphaphaphappy  
With somebody else
