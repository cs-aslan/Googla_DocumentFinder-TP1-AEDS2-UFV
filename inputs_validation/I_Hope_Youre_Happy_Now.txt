Hes a fine figure of a man and handsome too  
With his eyes upon the secret places hed like to undo  
Still he knows who knows who and where and how  
And I hope youre happy now  
  
Hes got all the things you need and some that you will never  
But you make him sound like frozen food his love will last forever  
Still he knows what you want and what you dont allow  
And I hope youre happy now  
  
I hope that youre happy now like youre supposed to be  
And I know that this will hurt you more than it hurts me  
  
Hes acting innocent and proud still you know what hes after  
Like a matador with his pork sword while we all die of laughter  
In his turquoise pajamas and motorcycle hat  
I hope youre happy now because youll soon put pay to that  
I knew then what I know now I never loved you anyhow  
And I hope youre happy now
