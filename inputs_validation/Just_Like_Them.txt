I know its hard but  
Lets go  
  
Theres something different in your eyes baby  
You cant seem to look into mine lady  
Tell me what is on your mind baby  
Or Im gonna assume that somethings wrong  
  
Chorus  
I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed  
Cause all those other women couldnt get it lets  
And Im not barely trippin I just cant do this again  
Please dont tell me youre just like them  
Please dont tell me youre just like them  
Youre just like them  
  
I know that its hard to trust of  
But you need the trust that my love  
Whether I need you in the dust  
  
Chorus  
I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed  
Cause all those other women couldnt get it lets  
And Im not barely trippin I just cant do this again  
Please dont tell me youre just like them  
Please dont tell me youre just like them  
Youre just like them  
  
Baby you aint get this love on track  
Will you run away gotta wait on after love back  
You know that I love you girl so tell me what youre waiting for  
You gotta know know know know  
Know know know know know know  
Know know know know know know  
  
Chorus
