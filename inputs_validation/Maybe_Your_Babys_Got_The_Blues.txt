If you hear her cry at night  
Better turn on your light  
Maybe your babys got the blues  
When she says theres nothing wrong  
She just wants to be alone  
You can bet your babys got the blues  
  
Chorus  
Women like men to make the first move  
And touch her like he used to  
When theres achin in her heart  
Only tenderness can find  
Women like men to make them feel alive  
And keep her apron strings untied  
Yes women like men  
To love them through the blues sometime  
  
When her days all run the same  
And she says she thinks she needs a change  
Maybe your babys got the blues  
If she says shes just a wife  
And so far from the glamorous life  
You can bet your babys got the blues  
  
Chorus  
  
Yes women like men to love them through the blues sometimes
