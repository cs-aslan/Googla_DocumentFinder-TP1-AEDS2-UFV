Day dream day dream  
Day dreamday dream  
  
So many times Ive overflowed  
So many faces come and go  
I play my cards into the sun  
And try to work out  
What you are to me  
  
To me  
  
Been here before  
A million open doors  
Only one will set me free  
So I fall against the wall  
And try to work out  
What you are to me to me to me to me  
  
To me  
  
Inside my eyes  
The answer lies  
Something I cant see  
Another day  
Another way  
Its the same to me to me  
  
To me to me to me  
  
whats wrong  
  
To me to me  
To me to me  
To me to me  
To me to me
