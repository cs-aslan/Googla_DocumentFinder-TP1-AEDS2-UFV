ZRo talking  
Uh seem like they got my life on the big screen  
ZRo versus the world feel me round one  
ZRo  
Is it reality or just a fable  
The most powerful lyricists in the world was on a low budget label  
Even if I dont clear me in I just want to be living well  
Not saying that heaven is promised to me but I dont want to believe in hell  
Feeling on coming also cause problems worry me  
If it aint the stress somebodys always trying to bury me  
So thinking Im undercovers and the dope they try to deal me  
Jealousy and envy make my niggas want to kill me  
Everybody want to pick up a gun and bust thinking artillery fin to be  
drilling me nigga  
But I sick of this pistol play bumping aint no more killng me nigga  
Cause Im a soldier trying to keep his mind at ease  
And if I squeeze then we all bleed  
Chorus  2x  
Feel a nigga worldwide not just in Texas  
I think Im bout to lose my mind aggravated and restless  
I dont want to die  
ZRo  
Look at how they made me traditon systems raised me  
The drama that they give me never ceases to amaze me  
They tell me that my minds gone coming up is what my minds on  
I guess theres nothing left to do but get my grind on  
Thinking about my family but knowing they neglect me  
Im not gonna give up Im gonna make my family respect me  
Im talking to my father now daddy Im a grown up  
Depending on you is falseafied because you havent shown up  
Caught up in these streets Im taking penitentiary chances  
I done forgived and I done forget plus Im not giving you anymore chances  
Quick to run out of the house for nothing now your son is feeling anger  
Remember the times you couldnt come around because your life has been in
danger  
Im a leader to follow is not my destiny  
But I guess it was written for me to fall victim to jealousy  
Its killing me to stay alive but there aint no use in me crying  
No matter what I guess its what is right on southside  
Chorus  2x  
ZRo  
Whoever would of thought that I would be this famous  
Put in work until it hurt but keep pretending its pain its  
Affiliated with killers when we fight us to the death  
Picture your partner cocked and aim and headed straight for your chest  
Its hard to focus cause my homies keep on killing eachother  
Everybody stressing cause aint nobody feeling eachother  
I often conversate with god but whos to say if hes listening  
Even though I died as a sinner but resurrected as a christian  
At 11 years old I was told that most friends turn to foes  
From velicos to calicoes it helps when our battle folds  
If it aint true if it aint crew its a mexican deed  
Ima catch an attitude instntly bitch you plexing with me  
And aint no begging for mercy because you shot my nigga  
And I swear to god everywhere you go its gone be hot my nigga  
And maybe god can forgive you but see the streets seeing different  
They want you dead you might not make it to prison bitch  
Chorus  4x  
ZRo talking  
Ha ha new millennium music shouts out  
Dirty D Anonymous Heavy Rotation  
My nigga Pop Belly I love you boy
