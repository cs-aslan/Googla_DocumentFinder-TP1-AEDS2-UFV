I didnt ever mean to steal from you  
But how could I resist  
When everything you are and say and do  
Is perfect as it is  
  
I didnt really mean to go this far  
But now Ive broken in  
And now I wanna stay and stay away  
From every place Ive been  
  
You see  
These old record sleeves  
Dont keep me warm at all  
The TV wont answer me  
Like all the people on my wall  
  
I only want to try to be your friend  
If you dont have enough  
Sometimes I think you know that in the end  
That you and I are us  
  
You see  
These old record sleeves  
Dont keep me warm at all  
The TV wont answer me  
Like all the people on my wall  
  
And I dont mind  
If you dont write  
Or call on me  
One day the faces  
On my wall  
Will fall for me  
  
I donI how any choice  
A little voice  
Says I belong to you  
And you wont ever be  
Rid of me  
No matter what you do  
  
You see  
These old record sleeves  
Dont keep me warm at all  
The TV wont answer me  
Like all the people on my wall
