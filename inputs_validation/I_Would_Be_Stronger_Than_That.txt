Theres a friend who will call  
When her husbands asleep  
Crossing the phone lines for comfort  
And she cries that she needs him and  
  
Someday hell change  
And nows not a good time to go  
And it isnt my place to say leave him and run  
That no love is worth all the damage hes done  
  
But if shell hold her ground  
Then Ill hold my tongueever the diplomat  
Oh Id like to think  
That I would be stronger than that  
  
Wheres her head  
Wheres her nerve  
Does part of her think this is all she deserves  
OhI would be stronger  
I would not stay one minute longer  
I would be stronger than that  
  
It started out goodthey usually do  
Then one dayits taken for granted  
Til words become weapons and love turns to pain  
Ohwhy is she still holding on  
  
She says living without him is too hard to face  
And I try to imagine myself in her place  
But with well chosen words and well placed tears  
She forgives him in two seconds flat  
  
OhId like to think  
That I would be stronger than that  
  
Wheres her head  
Wheres her nerve  
Does part of her think this is all she deserves  
Oh I would be stronger  
I would not stay one minute longer  
I would be stronger than that  
  
I know what shes thinking and I know what shed say  
That my life and her life are like night and like day  
And her love is the love that will save him  
Brave words but I dont believe them  
  
Wheres her head  
Wheres her nerve  
Does part of her think this is all she deserves  
Oh I would be stronger  
I would not stay one minute longer  
I would be stronger than that  
  
Oh I would be stronger  
I would not wait one minute longer  
I would be stronger than that
