Who wouldve believed  
That you and me would fall  
And land together  
And who couldve forseen  
  
In you Id find the place  
Ive belonged forever  
And if I move closer  
Then love will take over  
  
And lead the way  
Id given up hope  
Losing the faith that love  
Could be mine to treasure  
  
And now  
Nothings the same  
I found myself reborn  
On the day I met you  
  
And if we move closer  
Then love will take over  
And lead the way  
Suddenly you are lying  
  
Here with me and the truths  
I used to hold have changed  
And if I move closer  
And let it take over  
  
Then love will lead the way  
And let it take over  
Then love will lead the way
