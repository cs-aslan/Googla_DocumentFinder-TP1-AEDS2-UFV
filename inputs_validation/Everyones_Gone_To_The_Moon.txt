Streets full of people all alone  
Roads full of houses never home  
A church full of singing out of tune  
Everyones gone to the moon  
Eyes full of sorrow never wet  
Hands full of money all in debt  
Sun coming out in the middle of June  
Everyones gone to the moon  
You see a long time ago life had begun  
Everyone went to the sun  
Parks full of motors painted green  
Mouths full of chocolatecovered cream  
Arms that can only lift a spoon  
You see everyones gone everybodys gone  
Everyones gone to the moon  
Everyones gone to the moon  
What will happen now  
Everyones gone to the moon  
Theres nobody left  
Everyones gone to the moon
