Well now on a summer night in a dusky room  
Come a little piece of the Lords undying light  
Crying like he swallowed the fiery moon  
In his mothers arms it was all the beauty I could take  
Like the missing words to some prayer that I could never make  
In a world so hard and dirty so fouled and confused  
Searching for a little bit of Gods mercy  
I found living proof  
  
I put my heart and soul I put em high upon a shelf  
Right next to the faith the faith that Id lost in myself  
I went down into the desert city  
Just tryin so hard to shed my skin  
I crawled deep into some kind of darkness  
Lookin to burn out every trace of who Id been  
You do some sad sad things baby  
When its your you re tryin to lose  
You do some sad and hurtful things  
Ive seen living proof  
  
You shot through my anger and rage  
To show me my prison was just an open cage  
There were no keys no guards  
Just one frightened man and some old shadows for bars  
  
Well now all thats sure on the boulevard  
Is that life is just a house of cards  
As fragile as each and every breath  
Of this boy sleepin in our bed  
Tonight lets lie beneath the eaves  
Just a close band of happy thieves  
And when that train comes well get on board  
And steal what we can from the treasures of the Lord  
Its been along long drought baby  
Tonight the rains pourin down on our roof  
Looking for a little bit of Gods mercy  
I found living proof
