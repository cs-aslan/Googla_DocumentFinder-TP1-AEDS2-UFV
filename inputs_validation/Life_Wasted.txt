Youre always saying that theres something wrong  
Im starting to believe its youre playing along  
Death came around forced to hear its song  
And know tomorrow cant be depended on  
  
Seen the home inside your head  
Unlocked doors and unmade beds  
  
Open sores unattended  
Let me say just once that  
  
I have faced it a life wasted  
Im never going back again  
I escaped ita life wasted  
Im never going back again  
Having tasted a life wasted  
Im never going back again  
  
The world awaits just up the stairs  
Leave the pain for someone else  
Nothing back there for you to find  
Or was it you you left behind  
  
Youre always saying youre too weak to be Strong  
Youre harder on yourself than just about Anyone  
  
Why swim the channel just to get this far  
Halfway there why would you turn around  
  
Darkness comes in wavestell me  
Why invite it to stay  
  
Youre one with negativity  
Yes comfort is an energy  
But why let the sad song play  
  
I have faced it a life wasted  
Im never going back again  
  
Oh I escaped it a life wasted  
Im never going back again  
  
Having tasted a life wasted  
Im never going back again  
  
Oh I erased it a life wasted  
Im never going back again
