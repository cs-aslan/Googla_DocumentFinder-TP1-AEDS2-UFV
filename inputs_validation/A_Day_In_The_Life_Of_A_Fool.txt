Morning comes and Im alone   
Its been a year since youve been gone  
But it seems like yesterday you said goodbye  
Im finding ways to pass the time so I wont lose my mind  
  
But my every waking hour I think of you  
Thats just a day in the life of a fool  
The one whos holding out for only you  
Knowing all along your love for me is true  
  
Its just a day in the life of a fool  
You would think Id learn by now  to forget it all some how   
But my favorite memories were made with you  
So every moment that I have  I live them in the past  
  
Even though theres no way back to where we were  
Thats just a day in the life of a fool  
The one whos holding out for only you  
Knowing all along your love for me is true  
  
Its just a day in the life of a fool  
Its just a day in the life of a fool
