Ive tried to fake it  
Ive tried to lie about it  
Ive tried to take it  
Theres nothing new about it  
I cant take a thing from you  
Because I want what I want and it wouldnt do  
Ive tried to make it  
Theres nothing you can say  
  
I used to think that things were going to be ok  
I never wanted to think  
There would be another way  
Is there another way
