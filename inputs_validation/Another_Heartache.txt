I told you once Im a jealous man  
But you never want to listen to who I am  
Were divided completely out of touch  
I guess thats why we seem to fight so much  
  
Believe me darling this aint no game  
If you think Ill be your fool  
You better think again  
I know you love me  
It just aint right  
Im sick and tired of fighting  
with you every night  
  
You say you dont want to hurt me  
But youre doing things I cant explain  
Oh baby why dont you leave me  
Because I know youll never change  
  
Its only another heartache  
Aint nothing to worry about  
Something Im getting used to  
Dragging my heart around  
But one day soon  
And it wont be long  
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home  
Its only another heartache  
Aint nothing to worry about  
  
Ill find a honey to take a chance  
And roll that dice into my past  
Shell cover me for a little while  
And show me love aint out of style  
  
I dont care how long it takes  
My hearts in the hands of fate  
Oh God I aint asking much  
Just a woman that I can trust  
  
Its only another heartache  
Aint nothing to worry about  
Something Im getting used to  
Dragging my heart around  
Oh but one day soon  
And it wont be long  
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home  
Its only another heartache  
Aint nothing to worry about  
  
I want to love thats strong and real  
I gotta know just how it feels  
Somebody to share my life  
To hold onto through the night  
  
Its only another heartache  
Nothing to worry about  
Something Im getting used to  
Dragging my heart around  
  
Its only another heartache  
Nothing to worry about  
Its only another heartache  
Nothing to worry Heartache
