All the people under broken homes  
Dont wanna fight no more  
All the people nursing shattered bones  
Dont wanna fight no more  
But theres no profit in peace  
So weve gotta fight some more  
  
And all these who are in foreign lands  
Dont wanna fight no more  
And all those those lost their feet or hands  
Dont wanna fight no more  
But theres no profit in peace boys  
We gotta fight some more  
  
hey we dont fight no more  
hey hey hey We dont wanna fight no more  
But theres no profit in peace  
So we gotta fight some more  
  
And all those just trying to play their part  
Dont wanna fight no more  
And all those who own a human heart  
Dont wanna fight no more  
But theres no profit in what you want  
So we must fight some more  
  
And all those who got an axe to grind down  
Dont wanna fight no more  
And all those who got their burning lives  
Dont wanna fight no more  
But theres no profit in ever being right  
So we must fight some more  
  
And all the people under broken homes  
Dont wanna fight no more  
But there is profit in the land you own  
So we must fight some more  
  
And all those who got a tired face  
Dont wanna fight no more  
And all those who are lost without a trace  
Dont wanna fight no more  
But there is profit in the love of hate  
So we must fight some more
