Got a fliptop pack of cigarettes in her pocket  
Feeling good at the top  
Shopping in sharp shoes  
Walking in the sunshine town  
feeling very cool  
But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores  
Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores  
Apples and oranges  
Apples and oranges  
  
Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly  
To meet the people  
Shes on time again  
And then  
I catch her by the eye  
then I stop and have to think  
What a funny thing to do cause Im feeling very pink  
Apples and oranges  
Apples and oranges  
  
I love she  
She loves me  
See you  
  
See you  
  
Thought you might like to know  
Im the lorry driver man  
Shes on the run  
Down by the river side  
feeding ducks by the afternoon tide  
Quack quack  
Apples and oranges  
Apples and oranges  
Apples and oranges
