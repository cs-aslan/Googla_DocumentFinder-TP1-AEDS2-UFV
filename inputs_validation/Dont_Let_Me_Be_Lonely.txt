Here we are again  
Two lovers lost in a maze  
So many roads we could go down  
So many ways we could go wrong  
  
You think we should part  
Both go our own separate ways  
Oh girl why cant oo we work it out  
Cant you hear what my heart says ah  
  
Dont let me be lonely  
Dont let me be lonely tonight  
That wouldnt be right  
Now that i ah need you more than ever  
  
Here we are tonight  
Both starring in the same play  
But im the one oo who plays the fool  
Ive only one line to say ah  
  
Dont let me be lonely  
Dont let me be lonely tonight  
That wouldnt be right  
Now that i ah need you more than ever  
  
Girl what will i be  
If you walk away from me  
How can i make you stay ah  
  
Dont let me be lonely  
Dont let me be lonely tonight  
That wouldnt be right  
Now that i need you more than ever
