You feel bad let me tell you we all get the blues  
Sometimes life is a burden weighed down in your shoes  
When its bad worse worst  
And when youre feeling so bad  
And you think youre cursed  
And youve got it sad  
Well if theres one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
Its gotta be rockn roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
Theres gotta be rockn roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
My friend Sam is a chauffeur Annie goes to school  
Jerry works at the office Sue lies by the pool  
But on all weekends  
Together again  
When I meet my friends  
Im gonna see them now  
And were lookin round for the action we sure play it cool  
  
Its gotta be rockn roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
Theres gotta be rockn roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You paint your world and use all colors  
And then you find it all comes out too bright  
You know its only a lie  
The songs you sing are too romantic  
And when you want the truth  
They only spit in your eye  
Oh yeah theyre only telling you lies  
Oh yeah theres gotta be rockn roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You feel bad let me tell you we all get the blues  
Sometimes life is a burden weighed down in your shoes  
When its bad worse worst  
You know youre feeling so bad  
And you think youre cursed  
And youve got it sad  
Well if theres one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
Its gotta be rockn roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
Theres gotta be rockn roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
Theres gotta be rockn roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
Theres gotta be rockn roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
Theres gotta be rockn roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
Theres gotta be rockn roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
Theres gotta be rockn roll  
To fill the hole in your soul
