If he walks by and the women get engrosed  
If he winks an eye and the bread slice turns to toast  
Hes got a lot of what they call the most  
  
You know the boy cant help it  
He was born to please  
And if hes got himself a figure thats just made to squeeze  
Wont you kindly be aware that the boy cant help it  
  
If he mesmerizes each and every one  
And Lord when he smiles the beefsteak becomes well done  
He even makes my grandma feel like shes twenty one  
  
You know the boy cant help it  
He was born to please  
And if I got to go down to him on bended knees  
Its because Im hoping obviously  
That some day his answer will be  
The boy cant help it  
Hes in love with me
