Dont throw no roses on my grave boo  
Deaths not a soldier its more like an angel  
You got no where to run no one to pray to  
Jesus and Moses aint comin to save you  
The greatest the the the greatest  
  
I float like a butterfly I sting like a hornet  
They wont let me have it  
Not even if no one else want it  
And if I try to take it  
They want to break me down and strip me naked  
They write a brand new rule and break it  
They lie they cheat they steal they fake it  
  
But Imma make it Lord I can take it  
Im the The greatest man alive  
Cut the drama boy save it for your mama  
Im the The greatest man alive  
I cant sweat it know I got to get it  
Im the The greatest man alive  
Without no doubt my name will survive  
The greatest the the greatest man alive  
The greatest man  
The greatest the the  
  
Imma make it Lord I can take it  
Im the The greatest man alive  
Cut the drama boy save it for your mama  
Im the The greatest man alive  
I cant sweat it I know I got to get it  
Im the The greatest man alive  
Without no doubt my name will survive  
The the greatest man alive  
  
The greatest the the greatest man  
The the the greatest man alive  
The the the greatest the the the greatest man  
The greatest man alive  
  
Imma make it I know that I can take it  
Im the The greatest man alive  
Cut the drama boy save it for your mama  
Im the The greatest man alive  
I cant sweat it I know I gotta get it  
Im the The greatest man alive  
Without no doubt my name will survive  
The greatest man the greatest man alive  
  
It only gets harder  
It always seems so far away  
The skys getting darker  
Another storm is on the way  
The the greatest the the the greatest  
Another storm is on the way  
The the the the greatest the the greatest  
The greatest man alive
