Hello sir remember me  
Im the man you thought Id never be  
The boy who you reduced to tears  
The lad called thingy for six whole years  
Yeah thats right my names bob  
The one who landed the popstars job  
The one who you told Look dont touch  
The Kid who wouldny amount to much  
Well Im here and youre still there  
With your fake sports car and receding hair  
Dodgy farout trousers that you think are smart  
Married to the woman that teaches art  
Married to the life  
Married to the school  
I want to sing and dance sir  
Now whos the fool  
Sing and dance you thought I was balmy  
Settle down thingy join the army  
And who were you to tell me this  
The dream I want Ill have to miss  
Sir is god hes been given the right  
To structure lives overnight  
Now I know lifes true path  
Tanks and guns thatll be a laugh  
Nah not me Im a mega civillian  
I wont leave my life riding pillion  
But thanks for the advice and Im sure itll do  
For the negitive dickheads just like you  
As for now the different weapon  
Stage and screen is about to beckon  
And here I sit in first class  
Bollocks sir kiss my ass
