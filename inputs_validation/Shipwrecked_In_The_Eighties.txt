Well you fight like the devil to just keep your head above water  
Chained to whatever you got that you cant throw away  
And youre shootin through space on this river of life that youre ridin  
And its whirling and sucking you deeper on down every day  
So you turn to your trusty old partner to share some old feelings  
And you find to your shock that your faithful companion is gone  
And the truth slowly dawns that youre lost and alone in deep water  
And you dont even know how much longer there is to go on  
 harmonica   
Like an old Holy Bible you clung to through so many seasons  
With the rules of survival in words you could still understand  
When they prove something wrong you believed in so long you go crazy  
And youre so close to folding the cards that you hold in your hand  
Singing Holy Toledo I cant see the light anymore  
All those horizon that I used to guide me are gone  
And the darkness is driving me farther away from the shore  
Throw me a rhyme or a reason to try to go on
