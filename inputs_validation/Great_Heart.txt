This world is full of strange behavior  
Every man has to be his own savior  
I know I can make it on my own if I try  
But Im searchin for a great heart  
To stand me by  
Underneath the African sky  
A great heart to stand me by  
  
Chorus  
Im searching for the spirit of the great heart  
To hold and keep me by  
Im searchin for the spirit of the great heart  
Under African sky  
Sometimes I feel that you barely know me  
Sometimes theres so much you can show me  
  
Theres a highway of stars across the heavens  
Theres a whispering song of the wind in the grass  
Theres a rolling thunder across the savannah  
A hope and a dream at the edge of the sky  
And your life is the story of the wind  
Your life is a story like the wind  
  
Chorus  
Im searching for the spirit of the great heart  
To hold and stand me by  
Im searchin for the spirit of the great heart  
Under African sky  
Im searchin for the spirit of the great heart  
I see the fire in your eyes  
Im searchin for the spirit of the great heart  
That beats my name inside  
sometimes I feel that you really know me  
Sometimes theres so much you can show me  
Chant  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Im searching for the spirit of the great heart  
To hold and stand me by  
Im searchin for the spirit of the great heart  
Under African sky  
Im searchin for the spirit of the great heart  
I see the fire in your eyes  
Im searchin for the spirit of the great heart  
That beats my name inside  
Sometimes I feel you really know me  
Sometimes theres so much you can show me  
  
Guk a mzimba body grow old  
Sala nhliziyo but heart remain behind
