Home again our day is over  
Now its time to close the door  
Turning on all over england  
You and I and millions more  
All in all its getting stranger  
Can you see an end in sight  
Calling all the other nations  
Bring alive the world tonight  
  
And if we never understand  
Then every feeling second hand  
Is new  
And everything we ever know  
Is just the background of a show  
For you  
  
Faraway a living legend  
Wears a crown in no mans land  
Theres a war thats never over  
All deny their heavy hand  
Will it all be coming closer  
If and how were still alright  
See it all before tomorrow  
Bring alive the world tonight  
  
And if we never understand  
Then every feeling second hand  
Is new  
And everything we ever know  
Is just the background of a show  
For you
