Do you believe in fairy tales  
I dont know  
But I do believe in Christmas  
  
Walking through a winter dreamland  
Sleighbells ringing and my friends by my side  
I know were having fun together  
Out on a Christmas ride  
  
The snow is falling all around me  
The reindeer is singing our favourite song  
And Santas coming to our party  
Dancing all night long  
  
Cause I believe in Christmas  
I believe in dreams come true  
When its cold outside  
I close my eyes  
And its magic through and through  
I believe in Christmas  
I believe in Santas gifts  
All the bells will ring  
The angels sing  
And Christmas time is here  
For you and for me  
  
The stars are shining oh so brightly  
The snowmans hopping and bopping with me  
Lots of joy for everybody  
Under the Christmas tree  
Everyone is so excited  
You know its just how I want it to be  
Im hoping that all my wishful thinking  
Will be reality  
  
Cause I believe in Christmas  
I believe in dreams come true  
When its cold outside  
I close my eyes  
And its magic through and through  
I believe in Christmas  
I believe in Santas gifts  
All the bells will ring  
The angels sing  
And Christmas time is here  
For you and for me  
  
For real  
I cant wait cause Santa is coming to town  
Oh yeah yeah  
Hes gonna make your Christmas dreams come true  
  
Cause I believe in Christmas  
I believe in dreams come true  
When its cold outside  
I close my eyes  
And its magic through and through  
I believe in Christmas  
I believe in Santas gifts  
All the bells will ring  
The angels sing  
And Christmas time is here  
For you
