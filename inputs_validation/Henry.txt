Every year along about this time it all goes dry  
Nothing round for love or money thatll get you high  
Henry got pissed off and he run to Mexico  
See if he could come back holdin 29 keys of Gold  
Now the road to Acapulco is very hard indeed  
And it isnt any better if you havent any weed  
Henry struggled to hold it straight on twisty mountain roads  
Fifty people waitin back in hopes for Henrys load  
Chorus  
Now hes rolling down the mountain goin fast fast fast  
And if he blows it this ones going to be his last  
Run to Acapulco to turn the Golden Key  
Henry keeps the brakes on for this corner if you please  
Henry got to Mexico and he turned his truck around  
Talkin with the man who has it growin from the ground  
Henry tasted he got wasted couldnt even see  
How hes going to drive like that its not clear to me  
Chorus  
Sunday afternoon Tihajuana is a lovely town  
Bullfight brings the tourist in their money flowing down  
Border guards are much too busy there at 5 oclock  
Henry truckin right on through he hardly even stopped  
Chorus
