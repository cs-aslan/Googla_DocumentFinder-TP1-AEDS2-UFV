Its not my destiny to be the one that you will lay with  
So many reasons why I have to go but want to stay here  
Sometimes I want a taste but then I dont know what Im saying  
You are the angel and I am the one who is praying  
  
There is another love that I would rather be obeying  
I see the ecstasy and already Im anticipating  
I feel a deeper peace and that deeper peace is penetrating  
Ive got the magic in me I am complete is what Im saying  
  
Im flying up so high my purple majesty displaying  
Ive reached a higher place that no one else can make a claim in  
  
Ill take you there my friend  
Im reaching out my hand so take it  
We are the angels and we are the ones that are praying  
  
Peace shalom peace shalom  
Peace peace  
Peace shalom peace shalom  
Peace peace
