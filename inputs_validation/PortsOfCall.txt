I cant help thinkin as those ships sail away  
What sirens beckon and call  
How long at sea this time how long between  
The portsofcall portsofcall  
Under the bridge they move to far off lands  
Maybe Australia or North African sands  
Complete the mission supply and demand  
To portsofcall portsofcall  
And everyday as the sun is setting  
Along the bay city lights appear  
Snake charmers sway while the smoke is rising  
Time is growing near  
When theyll be casting off anchor as they sail away  
Into the morning light  
Rising and falling through the blue and gray  
To portsofcall portsofcall  
And everyday as the sun is setting  
Along the bay city lights appear  
Snake charmers sway while the smoke is rising  
Time is growing near  
And everyday as the sun is setting  
Along the bay city lights appear  
Snake charmers sway while the smoke is rising  
Time is growing near  
Ill take the chance this time to change my world change my world  
And break those ties that bind ties that bind  
Far from those people passing through my life  
Like portsofcall portsofcall  
Under the bridge Ill move to far off lands far off lands  
Maybe Australia or North African sands North African sands  
Complete my mission hope you understand  
Portsofcall portsofcall  
Portsofcall portsofcall  
Portsofcall portsofcall
