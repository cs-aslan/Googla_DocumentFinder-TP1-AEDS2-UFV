Lately Ive been thinking too much lately  
Ive been staying kinda stoned  
Maybe I need someone who can make me feel  
Like Im not making it alone  
Lately youve been colder than the weather  
Whether love was right or love was wrong  
Once you told me there was no one better  
Now you say youre better off alone  
Yesterday has ran into tomorrow  
Wrecking every dream weve ever known  
Even though were lying here together in this bed  
I believe were laying here alone  
  
Lately Ive been drivin myself crazy lately  
This old house aint been no home  
I thought you were something to hold on to  
When I could not make it on my own  
Lately youve been more than I can handle lately  
I cant handle being stoned  
Maybe I need someone who can make me feel  
Like Im not making it alone  
Yesterday has ran into tomorrow  
Wrecking every dream weve ever known  
Even though were lying here together in this bed  
I believe were laying here alone  
Lately Ive been thinking too much lately
