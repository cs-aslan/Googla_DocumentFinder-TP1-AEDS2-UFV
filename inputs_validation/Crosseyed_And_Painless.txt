Lost my shape  
Trying to act casual  
Cant stop  
I might end up in the hospital  
Im changing my shape  
I feel like an accident  
Theyre back  
To explain their experience  
Isnt it weir  
Looks too obscure to me  
Wasting away  
And that was their policy  
Im ready to leave  
I push the fact in front of me  
Facts lost  
Facts are never what they seem to be  
Nothing there  
No information left of any kind  
Lifting my head  
Looking for danger signs  
There was a line  
There was a formula  
Sharp as a knife  
Facts cut a hole in us  
There was a line  
There was a formula  
Sharp as a knife  
Facts cut a hole in us  
Im still waiting Im still waiting Im still waiting  
Im still waiting Im still waiting Im still waiting  
Im still waiting Im still waiting  
The feeling returns  
Whenever we close out eyes  
Lifting my head  
Looking around inside  
The island of doubt  
Its like the taste of medicine  
Working by hindsight  
Got the message from the oxygen  
Making a list  
Find the cost of opportunity  
Doing it right  
Facts are useful in emergencies  
The feeling returns  
Whenever we close out eyes  
Lifting my head  
Looking around inside  
Facts are simple and facts are straight  
Facts are lazy and facts are late  
Facts all come with points of view  
Facts dont do what I want them to  
Facts just twist the truth around  
Facts are living turned inside out  
Facts are getting the best of them  
Facts are nothing on the face of things  
Facts dont stain the furniture  
Facts go out and slam the door  
Facts are written all over your face  
Facts continue to change their shape  
Im still waiting Im still waiting Im still waiting  
Im still waiting Im still waiting Im still waiting  
Im still waiting Im still waiting
