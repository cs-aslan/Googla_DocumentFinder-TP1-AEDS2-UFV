The day I first met you  
You told me youd never fall in love  
But now that I get you  
I know fear is what it really was  
Now here we are so close  
Yet so far havent I passed the test  
When will you realize  
Baby Im not like the rest  
  
Dont wanna break your heart  
Wanna give your heart a break  
I know youre scared its wrong  
Like you might make a mistake  
  
Theres just one life to live  
And theres no time to wait  
  
To waste  
So let me give your heart a break  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
On Sunday you went home alone  
There were tears in your eyes  
I called your cell phone my love  
But you did not reply  
  
The world is ours if we want it  
We can take it  
  
If you just take my hand  
Theres no turning back now Theres no turning back now  
  
Baby try to understand  
Dont wanna break your heart  
Wanna give your heart a break  
I know youre scared its wrong  
  
Like you might make a mistake  
  
Rachel and Brody  
Theres just one life to live  
And theres no time to wait  
  
To waste  
So let me give your heart a break  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
Theres just so much you can take  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
  
Oh yeah yeah  
When your lips are on my lips  
And our hearts beat as one  
But you slip out of my finger tips  
Every time you run  
  
Dont wanna break your heart  
Wanna give your heart a break  
I know youre scared its wrong  
  
Like you might make a mistake  
Theres just one life to live  
And theres no time to wait  
  
To waste  
So let me give your heart a break  
  
Cause youve been hurt before Give your heart a break  
I can see it in your eyes Give your heart a break  
You try to smile it away Give your heart a break  
Some things you cant disguise  
  
Dont wanna break your heart  
Maybe I can ease the ache the ache  
So let me give your heart a break  
  
Give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
  
Your heart a break  
Theres just so much you can take  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break your heart a break
