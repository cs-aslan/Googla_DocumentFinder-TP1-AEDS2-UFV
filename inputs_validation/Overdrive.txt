Every now Im running out  
This time I think Im breaking up  
Come on down well take this town  
Tonight before it turns to dust  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Every now Im drifting out  
This time it keeps on sinking us  
Come on down well take this town  
Tonight before it turns to dust  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Overdrive Im going life or death  
Overdrive Im going life or death  
Overdrive Im going life or death  
Keep hanging by a thread  
  
Theres a lie I think youll find  
Its locked inside of everyone  
You and I get on with life  
Pray well find a better one  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Overdrive Im going life or death  
Overdrive Im going life or death  
Overdrive Im going life or death  
Keep hanging by a thread  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Every now Im drifting out  
This time I think its sinking us  
Come on down well take this town  
Tonight before it turns to dust  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Overdrive Im going life or death  
Overdrive Im going life or death  
Overdrive Im going life or death  
Keep hanging  
Keep hanging  
You keep hanging
