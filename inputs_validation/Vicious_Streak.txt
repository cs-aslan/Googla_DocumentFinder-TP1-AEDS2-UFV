  
What am I gonna do   
I feel like Im on fire  
If you only knew  
That youre the object of desire  
  
I keep hanging on keep hanging on  
And I swear by God that youre the only one  
I keep hanging on keep hanging on  
And I swear by God that it wont be long  
  
My aim is true  
My vision is clear  
My thoughts are crude  
Whenever youre near  
  
I keep hanging on keep hanging on  
And I swear by God that youre the only one  
I keep hanging on keep hanging on  
And I swear by God that it wont be long  
  
I keep hanging on  
  
Youve got a vicious streak  
For someone so young  
Youre like solar flare  
In the rising sun  
  
I keep hanging on  
I keep hanging on  
I keep hanging on  
I keep hanging on
