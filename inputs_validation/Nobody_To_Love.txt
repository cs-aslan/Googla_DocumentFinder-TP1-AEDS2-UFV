Hey baby whats your game  
I ask you the question and the answers still the same  
How can you go on day to day  
Without someone to care  
If I wanted to take that chance  
If I wanted to be your man  
You tell me that you feel lonely  
But you wont love nobody  
You tell me that you got a big heart  
But you wont love no one  
You lie and you moan and you bitch and you groan  
But you wont let nobody in to love  
What am I gonna do  
Hey there baby youre not shy  
We talk for hours and you seem just fine girl but  
Every time I bring up love  
You run for cover  
Suppose I told you something thats true  
Suppose I told you that I want you  
You tell me all the guys want you  
But you wont love nobody  
You keep your heart in seclusion  
And you wont love no one  
You game and you flirt and you talk a lot of dirt  
But you dont want nobody to love  
What are you gonna do  
Heart feels empty theres no one home  
Nights are longer when youre alone  
You tell me that you feel lonely  
But you wont love nobody  
You tell me that you got a big heart  
But you wont love no one  
You lie and you moan and you bitch and you groan  
But you wont let nobody in to love  
What am I gonna do  
You tell me all the guys want you  
But you wont love nobody  
You keep your heart in seclusion  
And you wont love no one  
You game and you flirt and you talk a lot of dirt  
But you dont want nobody to love  
What are you gonna do
