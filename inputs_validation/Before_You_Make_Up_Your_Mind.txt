Before you make up your mind to leave me  
Before you make up your mind to walk out the door  
Before you telle me that its all over  
Let me say what I have to say it wont take me all day  
And if you still wanna leave dont stay for I wont try to hold you anymore  
Does she really love you way that I love you  
Does she treat you right even when youve done wrong  
If shes woman enough to forgive you way that Im willing to  
If she aint then dont go for I still love you so we all make mistakes I know  
Give these thoughts a little time before you make up your mind
