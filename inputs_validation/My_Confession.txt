I have been blind  
Unwilling  
To see the true love  
Youre giving  
I have ignored every blessing  
Im on my knees  
Confessing  
  
That I feel myself surrender  
Each time I see your face  
I am staggared by your beauty  
Your unassuming grace  
And I feel my heart is turning  
Falling into place  
I cant hide it  
Now hear my confession  
  
I have been wrong about you  
I thought I was strong without you  
For so long  
Nothing could move me  
For so long  
Nothing could change me  
  
Now I feel myself surrender  
Each time I see your face  
I am captured by your beauty  
Your unassuming grace  
And I feel my heart turning  
Falling into place  
I cant hide it  
Niow hear my confession  
  
You are the air that I breathe  
Youre the ground beneath my feet  
When did I stop believing
