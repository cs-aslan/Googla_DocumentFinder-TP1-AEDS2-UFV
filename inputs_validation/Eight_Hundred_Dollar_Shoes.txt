You had your grand illusion and wrestled with your fate  
The winter of your discontent came twenty years too late  
If it was love and I was there Ive forgotten where it lives  
We both stepped off a frozen rock onto a burning bridge  
You came like an invasion all bells and whistles blowing  
Reaping the rewards of the fable youd been sowing  
I saw you cross the landing and descending marble stairs  
Like Caesar crossed the Rubicon you seemed to walk on air  
  
Chorus  
And yeah Ive seen your movie  
And I read it in your book  
The truth just flew off every page  
Your songs have all the hooks  
Youre seven wonders rolled in one  
You shifted gear to cruise  
Oh you came to town in headlines  
And eight hundred dollar shoes  
  
Oh the bellboys are crying and moneys changing hands  
Your cloak and dagger legacys gone home to no mans land  
The marquee lights are flickering your posters fading fast  
Your being here just melts away like ice cubes in a glass  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh you came to town in headlines  
And eight hundred dollar shoes
