I see the lights of the city tonight and I see a star shinin so bright  
A babe in a manger in swaddling clothes its you its me everyone knows  
  
The Christmas spirit is in the air the Christmas spirit is everywhere  
Like th day Christ was born in Bethlehem the Christmas spirit has been  
coming down  
  
I hear the sound of church bell ring and I see kids and grownups sing  
A real live nativity scene its you its me we all know what it means  
  
The Christmas spirit is in the air the Christmas spirit is everywhere  
Like the day Christ was born in Bethlehem the Christmas spirit has been  
coming down  
  
An its time to let the angels sing its time to praise the newborn King  
Its time for that eastern star to shine its time its Christmas time  
  
Yes its time to let the angels sing its time to praise the newborn King  
Its time for that eastern start to shine its time its Christmas time  
  
Since the day Christ was born in Bethlehem the Christmas spirit has been  
coming down
