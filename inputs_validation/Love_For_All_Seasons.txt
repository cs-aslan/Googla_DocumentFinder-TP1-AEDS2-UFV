Hey there boy did ya happen to know  
Wherever you go Ill follow  
Ooh babe youre like a cool breeze  
On a summer day  
When youre near me  
I dont know what to do  
I feel like a fool  
Like a schoolgirl  
True blue girl  
Who wants to know  
Can you come out and play  
You make me feel the way  
A woman is supposed to feel  
Show you that my loves for real  
  
Ill be the rain in your summer  
The chill in your fall  
Ill be what ya want  
Anything at all  
Ive got a love for all seasons  
A love for all time  
Ill be the fire in your winter  
The sun in your spring  
Ill do what you want  
Give ya everything  
Ive got a love for all seasons  
A love for all time  
  
Ill be there for you  
Keeping you warm  
Through the storm  
Ill guide you  
Stand by you until the stars fall from the sky  
When you call me  
I never hesitate  
Making you wait for my love  
Never lie love  
Its something that I just cant deny  
Ill read your each and every feeling  
When you need me to  
So now I gotta let you know  
This loves for you  
  
You dont have to search no more  
Baby you dont have to dream  
Cause what Ive got inside for you  
Its all that youll ever need  
You dont have to search no more  
My heart is yours  
For real for sure  
You dont have to wonder why  
Ill never leave  
Ill never lie
