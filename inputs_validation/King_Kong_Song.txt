Well I was looking at a movie on the TV last night  
Then I had a very funny notion yeah  
I really had to write a song about it  
And then Im gonna sing it with my rock n roll band  
And I bet the people gonna like it yeah  
I know that everybodys gonna shout it  
  
And what a dreadful mighty killer  
A big black wide gorilla  
  
Chorus  
We do the King Kong song wont you sing along  
Listen to the music and it couldnt go wrong  
We do the Kong Kong song gotta sing along  
Cant you hear the beating of the monkey tomtom  
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song  
  
Now we can make the jungle out of any old place  
We can make gorillas out of people yeah  
Well who can tell a monkey from a monkey  
So people get together gonna have a good time  
Everybody listen to the music yeah  
Cause what were gonna sing is kinda funky  
  
So let your arms hang down  
And waddle all around  
Like a dreadful mighty killer  
A big black wide gorilla  
  
Chorus  
  
Like a dreadful mighty killer  
A big black wide gorilla  
  
Chorus x2
