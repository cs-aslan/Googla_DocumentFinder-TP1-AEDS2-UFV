Shes a rich kid  
She wears diamond rings  
Knows how to walk  
Knows everything  
About love shes not too sure  
  
What shes looking for  
Fresh from the woods  
Out on the street  
Shes looking good  
Looking so neat  
She dont know if she should  
  
Cause she dont know  
If shes bad or good  
She dont care if it  
Hurts her father  
She dont care if it  
  
Breaks her mother  
She dont care anymore  
She just wants what  
Shes never had before  
All she wants is love shes ready  
  
She wants love  
And shes gonna get it  
All she needs is love  
Shes gotta have it someone to love  
All she wants is love shes ready  
Gotta have love shell get it  
All she needs is love  
  
Shes never had it someone to love  
She was a school boys dream  
High school queen  
She had it all when she was sixteen  
Stayed away from boys  
Cause she thought shed get hurt  
  
Why did she listen to  
Her mothers words  
Couldnt go out  
Had to stay home  
And how she hated  
Being on her own  
She needs love like everybody else  
Now shes gonna  
Get some for herself  
All she wants is love shes ready  
  
She wants love  
And shes gonna get it  
All she needs is love  
Shes gotta have it she needs love  
All she wants is love shes ready  
She wants love  
And shes gonna get it  
All she needs is love  
Shes gotta have it someone
