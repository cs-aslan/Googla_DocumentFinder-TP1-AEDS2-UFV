Oh baby baby  
How was I supposed to know  
That something wasnt right here  
Oh baby baby  
I shouldnt have let you go  
And now youre out of sight  
Show me how you want it to be  
Tell me baby cause I need to know now  
Oh because  
  
Chorus  
My loneliness is killing me  
and I  
I must confess I still believe  
still believe  
If Im not with you I lose my mind  
Give me a sign  
Hit me baby one more time  
  
Oh baby baby  
The reason I breathe is you  
Girl you got me blinded  
Oh pretty baby  
Theres nothing that I wouldnt do  
Its not the way I planned it  
Show me how you want it to be  
Tell me baby cause I need to know now  
Oh because  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh baby baby  
How was I supposed to know  
Oh pretty baby I shouldnt have let you go  
I must confess that my loneliness  
Is killing me now  
Dont you know I still believe  
That you will be here  
And give me a sign  
Hit me baby one more time  
  
Chorus
