Let me take you down  
cause Im going to Strawberry Fields  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout  
Strawberry Fields forever  
  
Living is easy with eyes closed  
Misunderstanding all you see  
Its getting hard to be someone  
But it all works out  
It doesnt matter much to me  
  
Let me take you down  
cause Im going to Strawberry Fields  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout  
Strawberry Fields forever  
  
No one I think is in my tree  
I mean it must be high or low  
That is you cant you know tune in  
But its all right that is  
I think its not too bad  
  
Let me take you down  
cause Im going to Strawberry Fields  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout  
Strawberry Fields forever  
  
Always no sometimes think its me  
But you know I know when its a dream  
I think I know I mean a Yes  
But its all wrong that is I think I disagree  
  
Let me take you down  
cause Im going to Strawberry Fields  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout  
Strawberry Fields forever  
Strawberry Fields forever
