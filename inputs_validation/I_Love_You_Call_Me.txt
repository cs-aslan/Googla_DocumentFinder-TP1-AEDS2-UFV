I love you I love you  
I love you too  
Baby will you call me  
The moment you get there  
  
I love you I love you  
And i love you too  
Baby will you call me  
The moment you get there  
  
My tears my dearest of all darling  
I know i know i know  
I know weve got to part  
Baby baby baby it really doesnt hurt me that bad  
Because youre taking me with you and  
Im keeping you right here in my arms  
  
Its all because i love you  
Call me call me the hour  
Call me the minute the second you get there
