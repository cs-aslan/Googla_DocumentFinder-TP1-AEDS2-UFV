The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows  
Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere  
He didnt care  
He stood in a field where barley grows  
  
His head did no thinking  
His arms didnt move except when the wind cut up  
Rough and mice ran around on the ground  
He stood in a field where barley grows  
  
The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me  
But now hes resigned to his fate  
Cause lifes not unkind he doesnt mind  
He stood in a field where barley grows
