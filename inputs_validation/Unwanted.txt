All that I did was walk over  
Start off by shaking your hands  
Thats how it went  
I had a smile on my face and I sat up straight  
Oh yeah yeah  
I wanted to know you  
I wanted to show you  
  
Chorus  
You dont know me  
Dont ignore me  
You dont want me there  
You just shut me out  
You dont know me  
Dont ignore me  
If you had your way  
Youd just shut me up  
Make me go away  
  
No I just dont understand why  
You wont talk to me  
Its hurts that Im so unwanted for nothing  
Dont talk words against me  
I wanted to know you  
I wanted to show you  
  
Chorus  
  
Make me go away  
  
I tried to belong  
It didnt seem wrong  
My head aches  
Its been so long  
Ill write this song  
If thats what it take  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Make me go away  
Make me go away
