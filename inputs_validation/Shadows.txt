Scold me thats all youve got to say  
Coldly hurt me and turn away  
You say Im not sorry yet Im resigned to what is next  
I head for the shadow  
Hold me taking it back through tears  
Youve told me slowly confessed your fears  
But Ive got myself to protect Its too soon for me to forget  
Ill wait in the shadows  
In the shadows  
Though I am alone  
They help me see that Im the only one in your heart  
So until I truly believe that your words convey what you mean  
Ill wait in the shadows 2x  
I dont mind the shadows
