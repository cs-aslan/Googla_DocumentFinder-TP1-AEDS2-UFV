Pretty baby if you dont like the way  
That I touch you  
Then I wont touch you no more yeah  
Pretty baby if you dont like the way  
That I love you  
Then throw my love on the floor  
My mean daddy my bad baby  
Dont you want me  
I dont believe you when you say you  
Want to leave  
  
Darling honey if you dont think  
That you gonna want me  
Then honey let me know  
Listen honey I dont wanna keep thinking  
You love me  
Just to find out you dont  
  
My mean daddy my bad baby  
Dont you want me  
I dont believe you when you say you  
Want to leave  
Wont you gonna miss me

Pretty baby if you dont like the way  
That I hold you  
Then honey let me go  
Pretty baby if you dont like the way

Then baby tell me so  
My mean daddy my bad baby  
Dont you want me
