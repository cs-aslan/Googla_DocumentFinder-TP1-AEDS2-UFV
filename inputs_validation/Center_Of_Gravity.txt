In crowded bars at subway cars  
Whenever you are next to me  
Center of gravity  
Cant feel both feet on the ground  
Walking home after dark past the softball park  
Its clear to me according to a rule I learned one day in school  
Basic geometry two halves of a circle you and me  
Its a familial song weve known so long  
Your clever cuts into me  
As long as youre next to me  
I cant feel both feet on the ground
