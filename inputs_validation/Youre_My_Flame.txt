You take a stroll into the morning sun  
You make a Happy Meal a portion for one  
  
You steal the wallet of a man with a gun  
You make this seem like a whole lot of fun  
Yeah you do  
  
Youll make new shapes with your hands on a wall  
Youre driving a nail while youre taking a call  
You wouldnt care if you had nothing at all  
Instead of chasing the dream  
Youre just chasing a ball  
Yeah you are  
  
Youre just dodging all the friendly fire  
Youre never dressed in the right attire  
You miss the start of every game  
Youre my flame  
  
You make hay when the sun dont shine  
You dont need a dollar you dont need a dime  
You burn at both ends yet still youre fine  
Youre my flame  
  
Teach me to haggle  
Ill teach you to swim  
Get right back on the saddle  
Push me on a swing  
  
Take me to Rio  
Ill take you to Berlin  
Ill give you some yarn  
And youll give it some spin  
Yes you will  
  
Now youre sitting sure yes in an old tree  
Youve tied our legs and so now we have three  
You dip your toes into the ice cold sea  
I see your reflection your reflection is me  
Yes I am  
  
Youre just dodging all the friendly fire  
Youre never dressed in the right attire  
You miss the start of every game  
Youre my flame  
  
You make hay when the sun dont shine  
You dont need a dollar you dont need a dime  
You burn at both ends yet still youre fine  
Youre my flame  
  
Youre my flame  
Youre my flame  
Youre my flame  
  
Youre my flame  
Youre my flame  
Youre my flame
