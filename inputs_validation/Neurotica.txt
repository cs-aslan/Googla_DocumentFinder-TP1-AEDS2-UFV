You just dont get it  
What it iswell youre not really sure  
You move like youre walking on this ice  
Talking like youre still insecure  
  
Time is a spiral space is a curve  
I know you get dizzy but try not to lose your nerve  
Life is a diamond you turn into dust  
Waiting for rescue and I know you just  
Dont get it  
You just dont get it  
  
NeuroticaExotica  
Its just EroticaHypnotic  
Its just PsychoticChaotic  
Its just ExoticaNeurotica  
  
You just dont get it  
Baby dont you ask yourself why  
If you dont like the answer forget it  
You know I hate to see you cry  
  
Fortune is random Fate shoots from the hip  
I know you get crazy but try not to lose your grip  
Life is a diamond you turn into dust  
Looking for trust and I know that you just  
Dont get it  
You just dont get it  
  
Snap  
Hide in your shell let the world go to hell  
Its like Russian roulette to you  
Snap  
Sweat running cold you cant face growing old  
Its a personal threat to you  
Snap  
The world is a cage for your impotent rage  
But dont let it get to you  
Snap
