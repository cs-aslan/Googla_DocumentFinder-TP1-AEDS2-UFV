Dont you see  
Im the one for you youre the one for me  
Dont you see  
The love Ive got is the love you need  
Dont you see  
Im all dressed up  
To be what you want  
Me to be Im all dressed up  
To be what you want me to be  
Im all dressed up  
All dressed up all dressed up  
Dont you see dont you see  
The infinite possibilities  
Dont you need dont you need  
The kind of love that I need  
Dont you see me dont you see me  
Im all dressed up  
To be what you want me to be  
Im all dressed up  
To be what you taught me to be  
Im all dressed up  
All messed up all messed up  
You dont even notice me  
Moving you like a ton of glaciers  
You dont even notice me  
Soothing you like a long lost sister  
You dont even care  
No you dont even care  
All dressed up  
With no place to go  
But home but home  
Im all dressed up  
To be what you want me to be  
Im all dressed up  
To be what you want me to be  
Im all dressed up  
All dressed up all dressed up  
You dont even comfort me  
And carry on with the will of samson  
You dont even comfort me  
You keep your faith and you keep your phantoms  
And you dont even care  
No you dont even care  
All dressed up still theres something wrong  
Im all dressed up and youre just a song  
Im all dressed up youre forever gone everlong  
You dont even care  
No you dont even care  
You dont even care  
No you dont even care  
You dont even care  
No you dont even care  
You dont even care  
No you dont even care  
You dont even care  
No you dont even care  
You dont even care
