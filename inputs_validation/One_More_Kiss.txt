Part one  
At sunset you hear the soft parade is coming  
And the cars and the beast behind they all start humming  
And ooh you got a cool machine so lets get it runnin  
Well break the silence of the night  
And you know theyre gonna hear us comin  
We always see them whisper we know theyre gonna talk  
They fantasize the mysteries bout the night and the dark  
  
So baby one more kiss baby one more kiss  
We never have to say goodbye  
Oh one more kiss baby one more kiss  
It brings a little luck to the night  
  
Artists got their easels theyre ready on the mark  
Gonna try and take the pictures  
Of the dust and the gold in the sparks  
And ooh you got a cool machine baby lets get it runnin  
You never looked so good before  
And you know your time its finally comin  
Cause our home is the wind you know were gods of the mornin  
Champions of the night when the engines are rumblin  
Our home is the wind you know were gods of the mornin  
Champions of the night when the engines are rumblin  
  
So just one more kiss baby one more kiss  
We never have to say goodbye  
One more kiss baby one more kiss  
I never wanna see you cry  
One more kiss baby one more kiss  
It brings a little luck to the night  
One more kiss baby one more kiss  
We never have to say goodbye  
  
Part two  
Ready ready to roll ready ready to roll ready ready to roll ready  
Under my foot gonna hit it down  
Take this stance before the crowd  
Sleepin city urban fall  
Summers sadness time to answer the call  
Cool machine get it runnin ready to roll  
Soft hands around my neck  
One more kiss then its time to connect  
Leave this child leave me all alone  
This ones mine and Im takin it home  
Ready ready ready to roll  this ones mine and Im takin it home  
  
Part three  
Now behind closed walls new histories start to rise  
Of the soft parade and the heroes where they lie  
And ooh you got a cool machine baby lets get it runnin  
You never looked so good before  
And you know your time its finally comin  
Cause our home is the wind you know were gods of the mornin  
Champions of the night when the engines are rumblin  
Our home is the wind you know were gods of the mornin  
Champions of the night when the engines are rumblin  
  
One more kiss one more kiss one more kiss one more kiss  
One more kiss one more kiss  
It brings a little luck brings a little luck to the night  
One more kiss one more kiss Ooh one more kiss
