All life we work but work is bore  
If lifes for livin whats livin for  
She lives in a house thats near decay  
Built for the industrial revolution  
But in her dreams she is far away far away  
  
In Oklahoma USA  
With Shirley Jones and Gordon McRea  
As she buys her papers at the cornershop  
Shes walkin on the surrey with the fringe on top  
Cos in her dreams she is faraway far away  
  
In Oklahoma USA  
She walks to work but shes still in a daze  
Shes Rita Hayworth or Doris Day  
And Errol Flynn wants to take her away  
  
To Oklahoma USA  
All life we work but work is a bore  
If lifes for livin whats livin for
