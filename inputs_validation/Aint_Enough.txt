Riding a hurricane tied to a ball and chain  
Too much of a good good thing it kind of stops you in your tracks  
How did you ever get this far now honey dont look back  
And you best believing that all thats good is inside of you  
Heh inside of you yeah  
  
Ride on a carpet ride high on the tears you cried  
Ones just too many but a thousands not enough  
And you cant make up your mind playing blind mans bluff  
And you best believing that all thats good is inside of you  
Yeah inside of you  
  
It aint enough I take it all but still it aint enough  
Aint enough I got to have it now aint it tough  
It aint enough you got no misery cause it aint enough  
aint enough you got to have it cause it aint enough  
Oh shit  
  
You know another touch is easy try and reach the sky  
And though you cant get much more higher than you ever tried  
When you die youre not forsaken  
Best be taking tries of all the things that youre not taking  
  
Aint enough I take it all but still it aint enough  
I got to have it aint it tough  
I got to have it  
  
Aint enough I take it all but still it aint enough  
I got to have it  
  
Aint enough you got no misery cause it aint enough  
Aint enough you got to have it cause it aint enough  
I got to have it  
  
Aint enough I really got to have it  
Aint enough I really got to have it  
Aint enough I really got to have it
