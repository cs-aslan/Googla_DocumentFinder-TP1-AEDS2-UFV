If I should die for our way  
I pray the streets my world to take  
Divide throughout the unfortunate  
Give my jewelery to the most respected  
My car to the one thats giving my guns to the gunners  
You know what Im saying  
  
Chorus  
Cocaine thoughts fish scale visions  
Pray the Lord forgive a nigga streets is my religion  
Amen amen amen amen  
Can I hear hood niggas scream amen  
This my testimony testimony  
My testimony testimony  
This my testimony testimony  
My testimony testimony  
Amen amen amen amen  
Can I hear hood niggas scream amen  
  
See Im a different type of nigga Im on that different shit  
Every day I wake up I want a different bitch  
I dont want the whip plain I want the kit on it  
Talking rims so big they can feed on it  
I just bought a different watch and another chain  
Fuck around and call my bitch another name  
Got confession to make you hoes look the same  
And Im so full of that liquor it oughta be a shame  
Say the rap game changed alot of niggas stressin  
But between me and you nigga thats a blessin  
fake niggas come up real niggas suffer  
Record labels fuckin niggas thats why I dont trust em  
This my testimony my testimony I made it true to see  
Hope the Lord forgive a nigga streets is my religion  
Now I can get a amen or can you bless a nigga with a thousand eight grams  
  
Chorus  
  
Man Im in my hood slangin that white  
Shirt on right no  on sight  
Hundred I shoot hundred I hit  
Five hundred  nigga this my life  
Yo Gotti dont shit round me but my money get high
