Ft Taj Jackson  
  
Baby dont speak  
Let your body tell me  
Everything that you want and you need  
Its the language of love  
Let your heart beat  
Tell me everything  
That you want and you need  
Cause its the language  
The language of love  
Language of love  
  
Your expressions are saying what I wanna hear  
Like baby will you spend the night  
Lets go to the special place you always take me to  
The signal Im whispering inside your ear  
Got you feeling butterflies  
Cause youre anticipating the things Ima do to you  
  
Shes swinging her hair  
Thats sign number one  
Doing the dance for me  
Like Im that song in the club  
And shes putting her hair  
Where she wants me to start from  
Only what I wanna hear you say  
  
Baby dont speak  
Let your body tell me  
Everything that you want and you need  
Its the language of love  
Let your heart beat  
Tell me everything  
That you want and you need  
Cause its the language  
The language of love  
Language of love  
The language of love  
Softly youre killing me the pillow  
Shes finding me funny  
But shaking like its 30 degrees below  
So I gotta keep her warm  
Like some hot tea  
Keep you up all night  
Like some coffee  
Take you on a ride  
Well be sitting in the backseat  
On my Bentley  
Take you anywhere you wanna go  
  
Shes breathing hard  
Thats sign number two  
Doesnt matter where we are  
Long as Im with you  
But the way you communicate  
When I do what you like  
Only what I wanna hear you say  
  
Baby dont speak  
Let your body tell me  
Everything that you want and you need  
Its the language of love  
Let your heart beat  
Tell me everything  
That you want and you need  
Cause its the language  
The language of love  
Language of love  
The language of love
