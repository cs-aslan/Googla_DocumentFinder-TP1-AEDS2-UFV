Therell be times  
When my crimes  
Will seem almost unforgivable  
I give in to sin  
Because you have to make this life livable  
But when you think Ive had enough  
From your sea of love  
Ill take more than another riverful  
And Ill make it all worthwhile  
Ill make your heart smile  
  
Strangelove  
Strange highs and strange lows  
Strangelove  
Thats how my love goes  
Strangelove  
Will you give it to me  
Will you take the pain  
I will give to you  
Again and again  
And will you return it  
  
Therell be days  
When I stray  
I may appear to be  
Constantly out of reach  
I give in to sin  
Because I like to practice what I preach  
Im not trying to say  
Ill have it all my way  
Im always willing to learn  
When youve got something to teach  
And Ill make it all worthwhile  
Ill make your heart smile  
  
Pain will you return it  
Ill say it again pain  
Pain will you return it  
I wont say it again  
  
I give in  
Again and again  
I give in  
Will you give it to be  
I give in  
Ill say it again  
I give in  
  
I give in  
Again and again  
I give in  
Thats how my love goes  
I give in  
Ill say it again  
I give in
