I go out walkin after midnight  
Out in the moonlight  
Just like we used to do  
Im always walkin after midnight searchin for you  
  
I walk for miles along the highway  
Well thats just my way  
Of sayin I love you  
Im always walkin after midnight searchin for you  
  
I stop to see a weepin willow  
Cryin on his pillow  
Maybe hes cryin for me  
And as the skies turn gloomy  
Night winds whisper to me  
Im lonesome as I can be  
  
I go out walkin after midnight  
Out in the moonlight  
Just hopin you may be  
Somewhere awalkin after midnight searchin for me  
  
I stop to see a weepin willow  
Cryin on his pillow  
Maybe hes cryin for me  
And as the skies turn gloomy  
Night winds whisper to me  
Im lonesome as I can be  
  
I go out walkin after midnight  
Out in the moonlight  
Just hopin you may be  
Somewhere awalkin after midnight searchin for me
