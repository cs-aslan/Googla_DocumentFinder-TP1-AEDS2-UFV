If you wake up in the morning light  
Something doesnt seem  
Or know is right  
Lay back and let your feeling show  
Come on and let the people know  
Oh thats the price that you pay  
Oh thats the price that you pay  
  
Just Money  
Your baby  
  
Now come on boys  
Oh thats the price that you pay  
Oh thats the price that you pay  
  
Oh thats the price that you pay  
Oh thats the price that you pay  
  
Bad news is just an excuse  
Get down and  
Let yourself keep loose  
Go on and live for tomorrow  
So much spent today in sorrow  
Oh thats the price that you pay  
Oh thats the price that you pay
