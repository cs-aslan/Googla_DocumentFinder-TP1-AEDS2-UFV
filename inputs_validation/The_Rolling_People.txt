I got one more life  
Can you see it wasting away  
But I got a plan  
Do you understand  
  
The drugstore wife  
I was dealing soul and other white  
I wont shake your hands  
Cause death has no plans  
  
But here we are the rolling people  
Cant stay for long  
We gotta go  
  
So come alive with the rolling poeple  
Dont ask why  
We just know  
  
Im on a big jet plane  
With my briefcase and crime in my veins  
Ill be the first to toast  
To my rowdy soul  
  
But here we are the rolling people  
Dont ask why  
We dont know  
  
So come alive with the rolling people  
Dont ask why  
We just go now  
Yeah  
  
Dont even know which way Im going to  
The lights are on and I am feeling blue  
I hope you know which way Im going to fly  
Thank you for my life  
I said good night goodbye  
  
You see me going  
  
But here we are the rolling people  
Cant stay for long  
We gotta go  
  
So come alive with the rolling people  
Dont ask why  
We dont know now  
Yeah
