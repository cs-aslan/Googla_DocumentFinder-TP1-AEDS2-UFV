The Chase is Better Than the Catch  
Metallica  Miscellaneous  
  
You know Im bad the times Ive had  
Ive gotta bad reputation  
I dont care I get my share  
Dont feel no deprivation  
The more I get the better it is  
I like it fine Like a little whizz  
Treatem like ladies thats a fact  
You know the chase is better than the catch  
  
Silver tongued devil deamon leach  
You know just what Im doing  
I like a little innocent bitch  
You know I aint just screwing  
I love you baby love you too much  
I like you fine I feel your touch  
But your appearance dont hold no class  
You know the chase is better than the catch  
  
A little beauty I love you madly  
Come on home with me  
I know youre hot I know what youve got  
You know I want to shake your tree  
Come on honey touch me right there  
Come on honey dont you get scared  
Come on honey let me get you in the sack  
You know the chase is better than the catch
