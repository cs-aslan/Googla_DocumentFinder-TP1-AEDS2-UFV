Oh lamour  
Broke my heart and now Im aching for you  
Mon amour  
Whats a boy in love supposed to do  
  
Looking for youyou were looking for me  
Always reaching for you you were too blind to see  
Oh love of my heart why leave me alone  
Im falling apart no good on my own  
  
Oh lamour  
Broke my heart and now Im aching for you  
Mon amour  
Whats a boy in love supposed to do  
  
Why throw it away Why walk out on me  
I just live for the day for the way it should be  
There once was a time I had you here by my side  
You said I wasnt your kind only here for the ride  
  
Oh lamour  
Broke my heart and now Im aching for you  
Mon amour  
Whats a boy in love supposed to do  
  
No emotional ties you dont remember my name  
I lay down and die Im only to blame  
Oh love of my heart its up to you now  
You tore me apart I hurt insideout  
  
Oh lamour  
Broke my heart and now Im aching for you  
Mon amour  
Whats a boy in love supposed to do
