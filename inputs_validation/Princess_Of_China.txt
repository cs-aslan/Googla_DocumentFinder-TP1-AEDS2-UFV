Once upon a time somebody ran  
Somebody ran away saying Fast as I can  
I got to go  
I got to go  
  
Once upon a time we fell apart  
Youre holding in your hands  
The two halves of my heart  
Ohoh ohohoh  
  
Once upon a time were burning bright  
That all we ever seemed to do is fight  
On and on  
And on and on and on  
  
Once upon a time on the same side  
Once upon a time on the same side  
In the same game now whyd you have to go  
Have to go and throw it all in my flame  
  
Couldve been a princess youd be a king  
Could have had a castle and worn a ring  
But no you let me go  
  
I couldve been a princess youd be a king  
Could have had a castle and worn a ring  
But no you let me go  
  
Stole my star  
Lalalalalala lalalalalala  
Lalalalala  
You stole my star  
Lalalalalala  
  
Cause you really hurt me  
Oh you really hurt me  
Cause you really hurt me  
Oh you really hurt me  
Cause you really hurt me  
Ohoh you really hurt me  
Cause you really hurt me  
You really hurt me
