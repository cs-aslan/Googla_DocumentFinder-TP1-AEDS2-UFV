I searched through the drinkers  
Each propped over his glass  
I ran through each bar  
Until I found guy at last  
Guy youve been to the doctor  
No I dont think it wise  
Took one of his pills  
Boiled the blood in my eyes  
  
When you played the master mix  
To the company man  
Took three million worldwide  
To make him understand  
You dont work for peanuts  
But theyll push you too  
Its that company trick  
Were all jumping through  
Bet you aint had no food now  
Since you last went to sleep  
The wild seed that was sowed  
Will take forever to reap  
  
What days and nights though  
Rocking out of ham yard  
Oh skip that fandango  
Bring the blues back down hard  
Though chuck would never admit it  
At the door of the jail  
There stood Guy Stevens  
And he was waving the bail  
  
Guy youve finished the booze  
And you run out of speed  
But the wild side of life  
Is the one that we need
