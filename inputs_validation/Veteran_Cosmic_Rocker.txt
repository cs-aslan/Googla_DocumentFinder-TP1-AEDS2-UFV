The lights go down  
The stage is set  
The man in the wings breaks out in sweat  
A backstage joker spiked his coke  
While the dressing room was full of smoke  
A crowd of fools got him high  
Hes afraid hes gonna die  
Hes the apple of their eye  
  
He steps into the remaining light  
The crowd go wild  
Hes outa sight  
Arms held high in the sign of peace  
His manager signed the one night lease  
The house is full getting high  
Hes afraid hes gonna die  
Hes the apple of their eye  
He struts he strolls  
His love is rock n roll  
Hes the VETERAN COSMIC ROCKER  
  
He steps into the remaining light  
The crowd go wild  
Arms held high in the sign of peace  
His manager signed the one night lease  
The house is full getting high  
Hes afraid hes gonna die  
Hes the apple of their eye  
He struts he strolls  
His life is rock n roll  
Hes the VETERAN COSMIC ROCKER  
Hes afraid that he will die
