A hungry boy  
In a town of one hundred more  
The food is out the door  
Makes me want to help myself help myself  
A river red  
Pouring from the side of his head  
A bullet through the brain  
Make him feel different today  
Oh colder grow the days  
Oh much faster pass the years by  
Til we die  
A treasure not my own  
I take it took it nobody will notice  
Well that suits me well  
Big house big yard help myself help myself  
Every once in a while  
To help the helpless comes into style  
The mercy mercy mile  
1800helpmyself help myself  
Oh colder grow the days  
Oh much faster pass the years by  
Oh colder grow the days  
Oh much faster pass the years by  
Til we die  
Summers here were swimming in the river  
Summer rain burns holes in flowers  
Dangerous hours  
Dangerous hours  
Dangerous hours  
Every now and then  
TV preacher tell of Heaven  
Redemption for a penny a soul  
1800 help yourself help yourself  
Help yourself  
Summers here were swimming in the river  
Summer rain come down come down come down come down  
Summers here were dancing in the daisies  
Summer rain burns holes in flowers  
Dangerous hours  
Dangerous hours  
Dangerous hours
