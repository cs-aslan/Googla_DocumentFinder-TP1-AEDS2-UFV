I must be crazy they dont know what weve done  
You are my lover  
Even though I know its wrong  
I hear them talking  
But whatever they do  
I need to love you  
And if I love you couldnt we make it  
  
Got someone loving me  
He wont say goodbye  
Hes been so good to me  
I dont want to make him cry  
I need you both to love me  
Its up to you  
You can help me  
Youre the reason I cant decide  
  
Breakin my bones and shakin my nerves  
Till I just cant see tomorrow  
Looking at him and looking at you  
And I dont know who to follow  
Ill never win in the state Im in  
  
Its a crime of passion Im bad to love you  
Whenever Im with you I lose control  
Its a crime of passion for me and for you  
Whatever I give you  
Its just too late to save my soul  
I need to love you  
My desperation is the power to go on  
Each night I prayed for love  
Im at the mercy of  
And if you dont hear me now  
Then Ill be the only one  
Dont want to be dont want to be the only one  
  
I saw him yesterday  
The questions he asked  
I think he knows about us  
Did we move too fast  
How can we hide it  
When we know its a lie  
Keep our love under the covers  
The pressure is too high  
  
Why do I get myself tied up  
Why tangle with love you borrow  
I should have been known as a one man woman  
Should have been one love but oh no  
Never be a cure for the human law  
  
Its a crime of passion Im bad to love you  
Whenever Im with you I lose control  
Its a crime of passion for me and for you  
Whatever I give you  
Its just too late to save my soul  
I need to love you  
My desperation is the power to go on  
Each night I prayed for love  
Im at the mercy of  
And if you dont hear me now  
Then Ill be the only one  
Dont want to be dont want to be the only one
