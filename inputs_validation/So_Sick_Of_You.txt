Im through with you  
Dont care what you say or do  
Im through with you  
You saw our shirts on MTV  
You say how could this be  
Betrayed you throw yours away  
You throw it all away  
  
Ive had it up to here  
And now I just dont care  
Dont care what you think of us  
Were sick of you  
  
Dont support us anymore  
Cause we played warped tour  
Say we turned our backs on you  
  
Thats not the fucking truth  
Its more work then youll ever know  
Some say we dont have much to show  
Theres records cds and magazines  
Thats immortality  
  
Oh  
What are they thinking  
What a scam I believed in that band  
How could they play for such kids  
  
Say Ill play when I want  
To who I want fuck you  
Your not the one to tell me  
What to do what to do  
  
Were so sick of you
