Gather round right now and hear me whisper  
The words of the prison the words of laughter  
The lords and the ladies were fixing their hairdos  
Cursing their lovers  
cursing the Bible  
  
Hallowed by my name  
Yelling at fathers  
Screaming at mothers  
Hallowed by my name  
  
Come all you sinners come now in your glory  
And my ears will listen to your dirty stories  
Youre fighting to go up cause youre on your way down  
Cursing their lovers  
Cursing the Bible  
  
Hallowed by my name  
Yelling at fathers  
Screaming at mothers  
Hallowed by my name  
  
Sluts and the hookers have taken your money  
The queens are out dancing but now theyre not funny  
Cause there goes one walkin away with your sonny  
Cursing their lovers  
Cursing the Bible  
  
Hallowed by my name  
Yelling at fathers  
Screaming at mothers  
Hallowed by my name
