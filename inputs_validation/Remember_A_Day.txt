Remember a day before today  
A day when you were young  
Free to play alone with time  
Evening never came  
Sing a song that cant be sung  
Without the mornings kiss  
Queen you shall be it if you wish  
Look for your king  
Why cant we play today  
Why cant we stay that way  
  
Climb your favorite apple tree  
Try to catch the sun  
Hide from your little brothers gun  
Dream yourself away  
Why cant we reach the sun  
Why cant we blow the years away  
Blow away  
Blow away  
Remember  
Remember
