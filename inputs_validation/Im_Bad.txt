Calling all cars calling all cars  
Be on the lookout for a tall lightskinned brother with dimples  
Wearing a black Kangol sweatsuit gold chain and sneakers  
Last seen on Farmers Boulevard headed east  
Alias LL Cool J  
Hes bad  
  
No rapper can rap quite like I can  
Ill take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand  
Not the last Mafioso Im a MC cop  
Make you say Go LL and do the wop  
  
If you think you can out rhyme me yeah boy I bet  
Cause I aint met a motherfucker who can do that yet  
Trendsetter Im better my rhymes are good  
I got a gourmet plate that says I wish you would  
  
And when rap begin then I gotta join in and  
Before my rhyme is over you know Im a win  
Cool J has arrived so you better make way  
Ask anybody in the crowd they say the kid dont play  
  
Sparring competition thats my hobby and job  
I dont wear a disguise because I dont own the mob  
Got a pinpoint rap that makes you feel trapped  
So many girls on my jock I think my phone here is tapped  
  
Im bad

Im makin sure you dont try to battle me no more  
Got concrete rhymes been rappin for ten years and  
Even when Im braggin Im bein sincere  
  
MCs cant win I make em rust like tin  
They call me Jaws my hat is like a sharks fin  
Because Im bad as can be got my voice all waxed  
Some brothers think hes making records now he must have relaxed  
  
I couldnt shouldnt and itll stay that way  
The best rapper youve heard is LL Cool J  
Kamikaze take a look at what Ive done  
Used to rock in my basement now Im number one  
  
And can happen on time never standin on lime  
You want to try me first you better learn how to rhyme  
Im the pinnacle that means I reign supreme  
And Im notorious Ill crush you like a jelly bean  
  
Im bad  
I eliminate punks cut em up in chunks  
You were souped you heard me and your ego shrunk  
Im devastating Im so good its a shame  
Cause I eat rappers like a cannibal they call me insane  
  
Im as strong as a bull of course you know I am pull  
I enjoy what Im doing plus Im paid in full  
Not Buckaroo Bonsai but busted out as I  
Say the kind of rhymes that make MCs withstand I tie  
  
Never retire or put my mike on the shelf  
The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself  
Not bitter or mad just provin Im bad  
You want a hit give me a hour plus a pen and a pad  
  
MCs they retreat cause they know I can beat em  
And eat em in a battle and the ref wont cheat em  
Im the best takin out all rookies  
So forget Oreos eat Cool J cookies  
  
Im bad

Never wearin no Levis battle me why try  
Ill treat you like a stepchild so tell mommy bye bye  
Sparrin MCs and Im a never get with  
When I retire Ill get worship like a old battleship  
  
LL Im bad other rappers know  
When I enter the center they say Yo yo there he go  
My paychecks large Mr Bogart in charge  
Not a puncher or hunter from a rap cool large  
  
The original Todd teachin how to be hard  
Take the skin off a snake and split a pea from a pod  
Youre a novice Im noble and I decipher my tongue  
Not Atilla the Hun but no Im Threwler his son  
  
My pulse exact like rack and pinion in a Jag  
You try to brag you get your rhymes from a grabbag  
No good scavenger catfish vulture  
My tongues a chisel in this competition sculpture  
  
Im bad  
Think Im gonna need backup  
Think Im gonna need backup  
What you need that for  
Yo this is LL Cool J  
And youll never catch me so dont even try it  
Im too bad for ya understand  
Im bad
