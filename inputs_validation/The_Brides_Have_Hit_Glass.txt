I dont come around  
Never call or let her know  
I got a life of my own  
You know I hate to be around her  
When shes like that  
I wrote a song once about her  
Called The Brides Have Hit Glass  
You know it just wont last  
To be on top of your own world  
With no guardrails to cling to  
You fall so very fast  
Its very odd to find her up again  
Staking out expansion  
Seeking new exposure  
And when she holds out an empty glass  
And she comes for a handout  
I ask for the same thingits sad  
And I hold on so sure I can take all she can  
Just to be around her  
Just to feel bad  
One day I will know  
Thats its a waste of time  
And theres a better road ahead of me  
I just dont know how to make it there  
So Ill just hang around and take my chance  
Once again Ill roll the dice  
And try to hang on to my shrinking paradise  
And Ill hold out an empty glass  
And Ill come for a handout  
And Ill ask for the same thingits sad  
And Ill hold on so confident  
Thats it all I can give  
To try to find my way back  
Just to hit glass
