I cant afford to breathe in this town  
Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand  
Look back up to the cathode ray  
Im better off dead  
Im better off dead  
Im better off  
  
Prove yourself  
Prove yourself  
Prove yourself  
  
I want to breathe I want to grow  
Id say I want it but I dont know how  
I work I bleed I beg I pray  
  
Im better off dead  
Im better off dead  
Im better off  
  
Prove yourself  
Prove yourself  
Prove yourself  
  
Im better off dead  
Im better off dead  
Im better off  
  
Prove yourself
