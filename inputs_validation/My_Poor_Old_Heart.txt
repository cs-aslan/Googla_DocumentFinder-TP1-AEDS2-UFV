Dont expect too much from my poor old heart  
You can blame me unforgiven for my scars  
You might just be the best that I can find  
But I cant seem to forget the tears Ive cried  
I dont know that I will ever trust again  
Its a price I must pay for all my sins  
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt  
And my heart may be lost never to be found  
  
Once upon a time I did believe  
In my true love that swept me off my feet  
Then the wind of change swept him away  
And left me drowning in my own pain  
I dont know that I will ever love again  
Its a price that I must pay for all my sins  
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt  
And my heart may be lost never to be found  
I dont know that I will ever love again  
Its the price that I must pay for all my sins  
  
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt  
I dont know that I will ever trust again  
Its the price I must pay for all my sins  
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt  
And my heart may be lost never to be found  
  
I dont know that I will ever trust again
