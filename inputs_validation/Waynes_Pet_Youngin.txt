Morgans pain succumbs to the frame  
In a zany combination of Waynes pet youngin  
Astral plane conversing lame  
In a zany combination of Waynes pet youngin  
  
A stained pane drownin out the rain  
In a zany combination of Waynes pet youngin

And Roger and Rerun to Waynes pet youngin  
  
Reruns brain  confetti stain
