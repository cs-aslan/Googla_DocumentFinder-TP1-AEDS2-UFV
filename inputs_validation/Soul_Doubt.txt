Sometimes I feel my life is going round in circles  
Beneath my eyes are bluish black  
Theres nothing new no one I want to talk to  
Nothing I want to think about I got soul doubt  
  
I stick my head out of the window its closed  
Instead of air I get glass stuck into my head  
The citys sounding I cant seem to stop the pounding  
Cant keep my thoughts from flying round  
Cant keep my thoughts from flying round  
Not sure what Im thinking about I got soul doubt  
  
A shameless display wearing a smile full of pain  
A frameless Erte a painting without a signature  
Shes waiting for someone to save her  
As I pass her by I see Cinderella  
  
She doesnt fit into a slipper  
Like she fits in a bottle of liquor  
Theres no one to take her away  
  
Her eyes meet mine she sees right through me  
The question is asked Whatcha gonna do for me  
I dont want nothin just a connection  
I gotta know what shes all about  
Cause I know shes been there   
Soul doubt  
  
I stick me head outside the window once again  
This time I see a thousand faces all too clear  
They wear the same expression Ive seen in my face  
So many times I know exactly how they feel  
I know exactly how they feel  
I know just what they think about  
Theyve got soul doubt
