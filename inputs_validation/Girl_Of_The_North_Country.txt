If youre travelin in the North Country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to one who lives there  
For she once was a true love of mine  
If you go when the snowflakes storm  
When the rivers freeze and summer ends  
Please see she has a coat so warm  
To keep her from the howlin winds  
Please see if her hair hangs long  
If it rolls and flows all down her breast  
Please see for me if her hairs hanging long  
For thats the way I remember her best  
Im awonderin if she remembers me at all  
Many times Ive often prayed  
In the darkness of my night  
In the brightness of my day  
So if youre travelin the North Country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to one who lives there  
For she once was a true love of mine
