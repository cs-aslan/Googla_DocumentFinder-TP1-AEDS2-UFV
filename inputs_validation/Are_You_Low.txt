Are you low  
Are you low  
Take it slow  
Tried to live high ended up so low  
  
Cant believe this is real somethings got to change  
Got to live my life but I love to be strange  
Dont wanna be wrapped up in a typical package  
Ran away but couldnt find my way back  
Now Im low  
I feel low  
  
Stuck in between its hard to explain  
Why every new beginning feels exactly the same  
And so I drink drink still I am famished  
I want to go the distance but never quite finish  
  
Now Im low  
I feel low  
Take it slow  
Try to live high and you end up low  
  
So here I reside in the middle of pride  
In the middle of the night I lost my ride  
And in a blink blink everyone vanished  
I know your vision understands my condition  
Now Im low  
Are you low  
Take it slow  
Tried to live high but I lost control  
Now Im low  
Are you low  
Take it slow  
Got to slow it down  
And regain control  
  
Pain might take you away from where you wanted to be  
Im drawing the line  
Somewhere down below  
And then Im gonna rise up  
Make my way back into the line up  
Oh must let it go  
If the onedrop undertow tells you so  
Are you low  
Or are you waiting  
Are you low  
While the sun is fading  
Down below  
Why are you waiting  
You know you cant live high if you cant live low  
If you cant live low  
Are you low  
Or are you waiting  
Are you low  
While the sun is fading  
Take me slow  
Why are you waiting  
I know you want to be high but you must be low  
Are you low  
Or are you waiting  
Are you low  
While the sun is fading  
Why are you waiting  
If you want to be high  
Youve got to live low
