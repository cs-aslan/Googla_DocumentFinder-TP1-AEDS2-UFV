Wait  
Before you walk out that door  
Hang your clothes in the closet  
Youre forgetting one thing  
Im the one who saved you  
From a long lonely life  
Im the one who gave you  
Youre first taste to paradise  
  
Look how you paying me back  
Look how you pack in your bag  
Please dont do me like this honey  
All this good love youre going to miss  
  
Think about it honey  
You really ought to think about it  
Fore you leave me  
Dig this  
  
Im the one who showed you  
How to live when you wanted to die  
Im the one who taught you  
How to laugh when you wanted to cry  
  
But look what youre doing to me  
Look how youre hurting me  
Please dont do me like this  
All of this good loving your going to miss  
  
Think about it baby listen  
You really really ought to think about it  
Fore you leave  
You really ought to think about it  
Deep down think about it  
Fore you leave me  
  
Do this for me honey  
Dont make me no lonely man  
Dont try to push me out of your plan  
Dont try to kick out love aside  
Just wait  
Before you tell me goodbye

How I give it  
You really really really ought to think about it  
How I live it  
One million times  
I better stay up all night
