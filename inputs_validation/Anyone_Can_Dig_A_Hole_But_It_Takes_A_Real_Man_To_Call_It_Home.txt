Im no leader Im just a mess  
Its not the way its supposed to be  
Its just the way that it is  
Im afraid we are all victims here  
And the one whose in charge  
Ive lead us all astray again  
  
Oh how the plot thickens  
Are we too far gone  
  
We always assume the worst  
  
Im afraid no ones listening anymore  
Im freaking out  
Im so sick  
Im making me sick  
Dont look down  
  
The only thing in my way is myself  
Im just thinking out loud  
How can I still be alive  
I should have been gone so long ago  
  
I cant get away from it all  
I messed up like I always do  
I gave you nothing  
I took you nowhere  
Youre still listening  
  
The world around me  
Has taken a turn for the worst  
Im left alone  
Climbing to the top  
Should I jump should I stay  
Can I make another day  
  
I am the one whos wrong  
God forgive me
