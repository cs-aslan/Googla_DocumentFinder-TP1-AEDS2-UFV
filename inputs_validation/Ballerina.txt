Spread your wings  
Come on fly awhile  
Straight to my arms  
Little angel child  
You know you only  
Lonely twentytwo story block  
And if somebody not just anybody  
Wanted to get close to you  
For instance me baby

Is ring a bell  
Step right up step right up  
And step right up  
Ballerina  
Crowd will catch you  
Fly it sigh it try it  
Well I may be wrong  
But something deep in my heart tells me Im right and I dont think so  
You know I saw the writing on the wall  
When you came up to me  
Child you were heading for a fall  
But if it gets to you  
And you feel like you just cant go on  
All you gotta do  
Is ring a bell  
Step right up and step right up  
And step right up  
Just like a ballerina  
Stepping lightly  
Alright well its getting late

And this time I forget to slip into your slumber  
The light is on the left side of your head  
And Im standing in your doorway  
And Im mumbling and I cant remember the last thing that ran through my head  
Here come the man and he say he say the show must go on  
So all you gotta do
