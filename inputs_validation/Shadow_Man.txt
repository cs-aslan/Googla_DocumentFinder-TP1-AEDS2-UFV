Asleep in black  
Theres no light in the crack  
The crooked fingers for you  
No dont ya dare say a prayer  
Its just the nights in your mare  
Oh the long forever youll do  
  
No Mercy no coming back  
No mercy forever fade to black  
  
Oh wheres the god that made you  
Oh youre Superman  
Going down forever  to never land  
Oh wheres the God you pray  
Forsaken again  
Giving you forever  
The Shadow Man  
  
Oh free at last  
With a heart in the black  
Forever Shadowing you  
Dont you swear to the terror  
Your god never cares  
Oh come oh whatever your do  
  
No Mercy no coming back  
No mercy forever fade to black  
  
Oh wheres the god that made you  
Oh youre Superman  
Going down forever to never land  
Oh wheres the God you pray  
Forsaken again  
Giving you forever  
The Shadow Man  
  
Wheres the god that made you  
Oh youre superman  
Going down forever to never land  
Dont runaway or hide again  
No gates of Heaven
