Oh love is never easy  
Its almost always out of your way  
Its not the path of least resistance  
Its not some words you get to say  
  
Its a stream running up a mountain  
Its a wave rolling out from the shore  
Wish I could say I never felt that way before  
  
I have a friend whos lonely  
She is chasing after her dreams  
And she is the one and only  
One who knows how hard it could be  
  
Theres a treasure on her island buried in the city of news  
Wish I could say we didnt have that much to lose  
  
One friend tried to end it  
He could not see the good in his life  
In his mirror or his pocket  
And his hopes had come down like a knife  
  
Its a stream running up a mountain  
Its a wave rolling out from the shore  
Wish I could say I never felt that way before  
  
Theres a treasure on these islands buried in the city of news  
Wish I could say we didnt have that much to lose  
Oh theres a treasure on these islands buried in the city of news  
Wish I could say we didnt have that much to lose
