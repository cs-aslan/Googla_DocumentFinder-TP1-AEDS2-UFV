You light a match  
And watch it start a fire  
You take a drug  
That makes you fall much higher  
You plant a seed  
And grow a field of fury  
You make a law  
Where youre the judge and jury  
  
Its firelight  
  
You suffocate  
Denying all his glory  
You meditate  
Its not your fuckin story  
You flick a switch  
To set the scene in darkness  
You break a law  
Where you collect the profits  
  
Its firelight  
  
You sit it out  
Refusing condemnation  
You take a shot  
Pretending its a play thing  
You plant a bomb  
Forget to set the timer  
You wake up dead  
The firelight reminds you  
  
The fires out
