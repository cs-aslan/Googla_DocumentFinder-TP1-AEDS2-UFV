You tell me your friends are distant  
You tell my your mans untrue  
You tell me that youve been walked on  
And how you feel abused  
  
So you stand here an angry young woman  
Taking all the pain to heart  
I hear you saying you want to see changes  
But you dont know how to start  
  
Love will find a way How do you know  
Love will find a way How can you see  
I know its hard to see the past and still believe  
Love is gonna find a way  
I know that  
Love will find a way A way to go  
Love can make a way Only love can know  
Leave behind the doubt  
Loves the only out  
Love will surely find a way  
  
I know this life is a strange thing  
I cant answer all the whys  
Tragedy always finds me  
Taken again by surprise  
  
I could stand here an angry young woman  
Taking all the pain to heart  
But I know that love can bring changes  
And so weve got to move on  
  
If our God His Son not sparing  
Came to rescue you  
Is there any circumstance  
That He cant see you through
