You had demons to kill within you screaming  
With a gun loaded with guilt you opened their eyes  
  
Love preys the living and praises the dead  
In the heart of our hearts by death we were wed  
  
Bleed well the soul youre about to sell for passion deranged  
Kiss and tell baby were bleeding well  
Bleed well the heart youre about to fail for reasons insane  
Kill and tell baby were bleeding well  
In hell  
  
No love lost under her will I heard you weeping  
And on those words a church was built to keep the pain in  
  
If death is the answer to loves mysteries  
Then bleed on my darling to the sound of a dream
