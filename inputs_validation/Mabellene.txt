Chorus  
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true whoah Maybellene why cant you be
true  
Youre not startin right doin those things you used to do  
  
As I was motivatin over the hill I saw Maybellene in a Coup de Ville  
A cadillac arollin on the open road yeah but nothin out race my V8 Ford  
The Cadillac doin bout 95 shes bumper to bumper rollin side by side  
  
Chorus  
  
He cooled down the motor cooled down  
Thats when Id heard that highway sound  
I kept back sittin like a ton of lead  
Got a hundred and ten a half mile ahead  
Cadillac lookin like its standin still  
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill

Youre not startin right doin those things you used to do  
Youre not startin right doin those things you used to do
