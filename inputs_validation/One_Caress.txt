Well Im down on my knees again  
And I pray to the only one  
Who has the strength  
To bear the pain  
To forgive all the things that Ive done  
Oh Girl  
Lead me into your darkness  
When this world is trying its hardest  
To leave me unimpressed  
Just one caress  
From you and Im blessed  
When you think youve tried every road  
Every avenue  
Take one more look  
At what you found old  
And in it youll find something new  
Im shying from the light  
I always loved the night  
And now you offer me eternal darkness  
I have to believe that sin  
Can make a better man  
Its the mood that I am in  
That left us back where we began
