Brendon  
Its getting late and I  
Cannot seem to find my way home tonight  
Feels like I am falling down a rabbit hole  
Falling for forever wonderfully wandering alone  
What would my head be like  
If not for my shoulders  
Or without your smile  
May it follow you forever  
May it never leave you  
To sleep in the stone  
May we stay lost on our way home  
  
Brendon  
Cmon cmon with everything falling down around me  
Id like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
Nate  
If I should die tonight  
May I first just say Im sorry  
For I never felt like anybody  
I am a man of many hats although I  
Never mastered anything  
When I am ten feet tall  
Ive never felt much smaller since the fall  
Nobody seems to know my name  
So dont leave me to sleep all alone  
May we stay lost on our way home  
  
Brendon and Nate  
Cmon cmon with everything falling down around me  
Id like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
Brendon and Nate  
Cmon cmon with everything falling down around me  
Id like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
Brendon  
Try not to mistake what you have with what you hate  
  
Brendon and Nate  
It could leave it could leave come the morning  
  
Nate  
Celebrate the night  
Its the fall before the climb  
  
Brendon and Nate  
Shall we sing shall we sing til the morning  
  
Brendon  
If I fall forward you fall flat  
  
Brendon and Nate  
And if the sun should lift me up  
Would you come back Cmon  
  
Music interlude  
  
Brendon  
Cmon cmon with everything falling down around me  
Id like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
Brendon and Nate  
Cmon cmon with everything falling down around me  
Id like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
Brendon and Nate  
So cmon cmon with everything falling down around me  
Id like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
Brendon screams yeah yeah yeah  
  
Brendon  
Its getting late and I cannot seem to find my way home tonight
