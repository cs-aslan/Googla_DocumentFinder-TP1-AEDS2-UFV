Do you ever get past the pain you go through  
When you give all you can and you cant understand  
Why a dream wont come true  
  
Its one sided romance you cant undo  
When you do all the loving and hurting too  
You cant take it back once you give your heart  
Trying not to recall how you did all is the hardest part  
  
And you cant change the reason you feel like a fool  
Cause you did all the loving and hurting too  
  
Thats the price you pay for doing more than your share  
When you love enough for both of you no one else has to care  
And though its all over you look back on the truth  
You did all the lovin and the hurting too  
  
And though its all over its over for you  
Youre still doing all the lovin and the hurting too  
You did all the lovin and the hurting too
