See what the worlds done Came to london  
Shes a nothing a no one shes undone  
Broken dreams stolen freedom  
Trapped in the night trafficked and beaten  
All a part of an evil economy  
Nothing more than someones commodity  
A precious being like you and me  
A daughter a sister a somebody  
  
She was drawn by the bright lights  
She was tied up in their lights  
She worked right through the daylight  
No voice shes a slave to the night  
  
27 million like me  
Thats 27 million on this cruel journey  
  
Weve got to rise up open our eyes up  
Be her voice be her freedom come on stand up  
Weve got to rise up open our eyes up  
Be her voice be her freedom come on stand up  
Weve got to rise up open our eyes up  
Be her voice be her freedom come on stand up  
Weve got to rise up open our eyes up  
Be her voice be her freedom come on stand up  
  
After the man left shes nothing left  
No one no love no one to call her friend  
Shes stuck in the pit of hell  
Shes almost sick from the smell  
Shes numb shes dead from the inside out  
Her heart is screaming but you dont hear the shout  
Whos the voice Whos gonna break the door down  
Who wakes her up from the nightmare now  
  
She was drawn by the bright lights  
She was tied up in their lights  
She worked right through the daylight  
No voice shes a slave to the night  
  
27 million like me  
27 million need heavens mercy  
  
Weve got to rise up open our eyes up  
Be her voice be her freedom come on stand up  
Weve got to rise up open our eyes up  
Be her voice be her freedom come on stand up  
Weve got to rise up open our eyes up  
Be her voice be her freedom come on stand up  
Weve got to rise up open our eyes up  
Be her voice be her freedom come on stand up  
  
27 million are you joking  
How did we let evil get so tight a grip  
Watching while the world falls apart  
How did we let this stuff begin  
Were not bothered if this offends  
Cause you got people that can depend  
But they aint got that they got nothing  
Sometimes you gotta stand for something  
Let this be the stand against your blood running  
  
Little girl dont cry  
Let me dry your eyes in the darkest night  
Youre not alone  
Hold on through the storm  
Youre not on your own  
Hold on love will come  
  
Weve got to rise up open our eyes up  
Be her voice be her freedom come on stand up  
Repeat until end
