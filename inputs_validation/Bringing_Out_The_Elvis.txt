Youre bringing out the Elvis in me  
Youre bringing out the Elvis in me  
  
Just like a fossil  
Frozen in time I could not move  
My heart my soul my feet  
Then you unearthed me  
And put me in a hot pulsating groove  
Now Im a slave to the beat  
  
Youre bringing out the Elvis in me  
Making my hips want to swing  
You bring out the Elvis in me  
Making me burst out and sing  
  
When Im with you  
I never have to feel like a sardine  
In a little metal can  
Im more like a wild shark  
That travels in a pink limosuine yeah  
Yeah together with my fans  
  
Youre bringing out the Elvis in me  
Making my hips want to swing  
You bring out the Elvis in me  
Making me burst out and sing oh yeah  
  
People think Im a silly fool  
Because I think you are so nice and cool  
And some people say  
Youre so square  
But I dont care  
Youre bringing out the Elvis in me  
Youre bringing out the Elvis in me  
  
Youre bringing out the Elvis in me  
Making my hips want to swing  
You bring out the Elvis in me  
Making me burst out and sing  
Youre bringing out the Elvis in me
