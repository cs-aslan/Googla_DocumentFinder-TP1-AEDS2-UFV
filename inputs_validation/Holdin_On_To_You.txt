There are those whod love to love me  
Take me home and take care of me  
Treat me just the way you never do  
But Im here on your door step  
Something I cant seem to help  
Like a fool Im holdin on to you  
  
Chorus  
Oh you dont love me you dont love me  
You place everything above me  
Like a fool Im holdin on to you  
You dont want me you dont want me  
  
You just hurt and disappoint me  
Like a fool Im holding on to ooh ooh  
Like a fool Im holding on to you  
What is this spell thats on me  
Make me think you own me  
Why do I keep holding on to you  
I just cant shake the feeling  
I only know its real  
And I keep holding holding holding on to you  
  
Chorus
