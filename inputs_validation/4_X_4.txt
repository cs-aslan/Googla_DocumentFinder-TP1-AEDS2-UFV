Round and round and away we go

Four by four and away we go

Round and round and away we go and away we go  
Four by four and away we go  
High not low and away we go

Im a female rebel cant you tell  
Bang on the dashboard just chipped my nail  
Lean out the window thats when I yell  
Driving so fast bout to piss on myself  
Driving so fast bout to piss on myself

Hooked on donuts and

Verse 2  
Im a female rebel cant you see  
Riding around your backyard who could it be  
Pull out on the scene  
Pumping his breaks to the sound of the beat

He dont understand what hes doing to me  
Deep down inside like a pitbull in heat  
Someones coming so we

Verse 3  
Its 12 oclock and I dont want to party  
My big boyfriend and my big truck hobby  
A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody  
Now I got dirt all over my body  
Might as well lie to L  
His big fog lights is bright as hell  
Calls it off he starts to yell  
He hits the gas so I grab the rail  
  
Bridge Nelly  
Sure you want to ride with me  
If you scared dont lie to me  
Im a crazy motherfucker from the midwest  
With a Mississippi flow and a  
Four by four with the ultra steps  
We doing donuts underneath the  
I need a chick on time dont mind being early  
A ride or die dollar six thirty  
A straight up chick like twelve oclock  
I dont know where you at  
Thats what you tell the cops  
Take a stand for a nigga  
Raise a hand for a nigga  
I solemnly swear he was with me all day  
Up to the judge he know what I love  
Hell he could tell she dont even budge  
Round and round we go  
Dont stop til I tell you so
