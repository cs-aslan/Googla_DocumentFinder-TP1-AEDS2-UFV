Shes got an eye on you  
Theres nowhere to hide  
She keeps her motives still  
Deep down inside  
  
She shows no mercy no  
She plays it rough  
She dont want no money  
She just wants to love  
  
Love stealer raw dealer  
Heart breaker love taker  
Yeah yeah  
She walks in the shadows  
  
As she waits for the night  
She gets what shes looking for  
She knows how to fight  
If you see her coming  
  
Then youd better know  
If your loves for the taking  
Shell steal the show  
She just cant go round there first  
  
Facing the joint  
Then shell move in  
And get right to the point  
So keep your love locked away  
  
Dont let it show  
Or the love stealer will rock you  
For more than youll know
