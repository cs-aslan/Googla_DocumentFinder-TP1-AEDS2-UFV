Welcome to the Grand illusion  
Come on in and see whats happening  
Pay the price get your tickets for the show  
The stage is set the band starts playing  
Suddenly your heart is pounding  
Wishing secretly you were a star  
  
But dont be fooled by the radio  
The TV or the magazines  
They show you photographs of how your life should be  
But theyre just someone elses fantasy  
So if you think your life is complete confusion  
Because you never win the game  
Just remember that its a Grand illusion  
And deep inside were all the same  
Were all the same  
  
So if you think your life is complete confusion  
Because your neighbors got it made  
Just remember that its a Grand illusion  
And deep inside were all the same  
Were all the same  
  
America spells competition join us in our blind ambition  
Get yourself a brand new motor car  
Someday soon well stop to ponder what on Earths this spell were under  
We made the grade and still we wonder who the hell we are
