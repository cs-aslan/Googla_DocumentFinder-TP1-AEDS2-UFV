He was just a friend of mine  
Id run in to from time to time  
And long before he moved away  
We used to share a taste for wine  
Still I never knew that he was sad back then  
He said the time had come for him to take a holiday  
And he says its brilliant there  
Theres something in the air  
And sunshine everywhere  
Hes on the beach  
I know hes changed somehow he sends us postcards now  
Im not sure where he is but he is out of reach  
When he called me up one day  
And said that he was going away  
I thought he meant a week in France  
And not 12000 miles to Sydney Bay  
Still he had to take his chances  
He said the time had come for him to make a move away  
And he says its brilliant there  
Theres something in the air  
And sunshine everywhere  
Hes on the beach  
I know hes changed somehow he writes us postcards now  
Hes on his own again and he is out of reach  
I bet he gets it on the beach  
And I dont blame him  
Leaving was the best thing he could do  
He longed for changes  
I just hope hes happy when he does the things he thinks he has to do  
And he tries and he tries yes he tries  
But hes a little bit hard on himself  
So now hes trying to be someone else  
And he says he says he says its brilliant there  
Theres something in the air  
And sunshine everywhere  
Hes on the beach  
I know hes changed somehow its in his postcards now  
Hes on his own again so far out of reach  
And he says its brilliant there  
Theres something in the air  
And sunshine everywhere  
Hes on the beach  
I know hes changed somehow its in his postcards now  
Hes in Australia so far out of reach  
And he says its brilliant there
