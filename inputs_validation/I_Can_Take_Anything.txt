I can take anything cause Im different from the rest  
Your lying lips dont bother me they still bring me happiness  
And I dont see all the things other people say you do  
I can take anything but losing you  
I can take anything cause Im living for that day  
You get tired of running round and come back in my arms to stay  
I dont care how long you treat me like you do I can take anything but losing
you  
I can take anything cause my hearts learned to live  
Oh what you used to be and the love you used to give  
How do I take it now knowing Im just a fool I can take anything but losing
you
