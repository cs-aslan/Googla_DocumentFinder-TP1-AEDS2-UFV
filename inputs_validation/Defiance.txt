You almost had me there  
It was the batting lashes that gave you away  
Youre bold beyond repair  
And theres an absence today of defiance  
  
Our most awakened inclination  
And your elegant aberration  
  
Somethings happening  
And all the rebels and devils have come to naught  
To hear your sirening  
And who would unring oh your bell  
  
Defiance our most awakened inclination  
Defiance your elegant aberration
