Life is a paradisewhoa oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven  
I know I know  
Cause Ive been there with you tonight  
  
I believe life could be paradise once again  
And the love we thought we lost is sleeping within  
Close your eyes its something for you  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Im a prisoner of hope  
I know  
  
We are young and we are old  
Were fallin like leaves like leaves  
And your hearts so full of soul  
It makes me believe  
Once again its something for you  
  
Chorus x2  
  
A bridge over time  
Was what you need to see the light to see the light  
Oh yeah  
Lucky love lucky love  
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven  
  
Chorus x2
