This is your wake up call young hearts be free  
Get up get on get out about and shout it  
Tell em all youre dressed and on your way  
Oh theres absolutely no doubt about it  
This is your wake up call  
Youre gonna miss it all  
Am I the only one out there thats listening  
Cause its such a lovely noise that I can hear  
Eyes are opening up to all around them  
This is their wake up call  
Theyre gonna miss it all  
Can you feel whats happening here  
Everything is changing all around you  
Its in the air electricity  
Everybody yes everybodys waking up  
Good morning to you  
Youre not the only one out there whos running  
But the man whos sitting next to yous asleep  
So pick him up and shake him till he hears you  
This is his wake up call  
Hes gonna miss it all  
Can you feel whats happening here  
Everything is changing all around you  
Its in the air electricity  
Everybody yes everybodys waking up  
Good morning to you  
Those whove done all they can do sleep easy  
Those that turn away they sleep alone  
But theres no doubt about it absolutely  
This is a wake up call

This is your wake up call
