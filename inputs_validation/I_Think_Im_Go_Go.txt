Funny words I cannot read  
Trams and boats where Strauss is street  
Milky way and far out looks  
On your bike and Anne Frank books  
  
Down the disco its clockworktime  
Wheres the humour where am I  
This worlds got smaller  
Im shaking lots of hands  
  
Saying lots of things  
That no one understands  
You can shake my tree  
But you wont get me  
  
Where am I  
I think Im go go go go go go  
  
Liquor store and rodeos  
P I X and rock and roll  
The freckled face the thin and fat  
The drivein films and drivein macs  
  
Strip and porno neon signs  
Wheres the building where am I  
  
Buckingham Palace trains all late  
Funny little men all out in the rain  
Car front deals and after pubs  
Tenth year plays and seedy clubs  
  
Iffy people dont seem to mind  
Wheres the action where am I
