I can still remember  
When I was just a kid  
When friends were friends forever  
And what you said was what you did  
  
Well it was me and Dan and Bobby  
We cut each others hands  
And held tight to a promise  
Only brothers understand  
  
But we were so young so young  
One for all and all for one for one  
Just as sure as the rivers gonna run  
  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
Wed still be standing  
When all was said and done  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
And Ill be here for you  
Till Kingdom come  
Blood on blood  
  
Well Bobby was our hero  
Cause he hed a fake ID  
I got busted stealing cigarettes  
And he took the rap for me  
  
Danny knew this white trash girl  
We each threw in a ten  
She took us to this cheap motel  
And turned us into men  
  
We were so young so young  
One for all and all for one for one  
Just as sure as the rivers gonna run  
  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
Wed still be standing  
When all is said and done  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
And Ill be here for you  
Till Kingdom come  
Blood on blood  
  
Now Bobby hes an uptown lawyer  
Danny hes a medicin man  
And me Im just the singer  
In a long haired rocknroll band  
  
Through the years and miles between us  
Its been a long and lonely ride  
But if I got a call in the dead of the night  
Id be right by your side  
  
Blood on blood blood on blood  
  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
Wed still be standing  
When all is said and done  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
And Ill be here for you  
Till Kingdom come  
Blood on blood  
  
Blood on blood
