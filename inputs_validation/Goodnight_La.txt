I said Goodnight LA  
Cause Im awake in my room  
I been up for thirty eight hours  
And it dont look like sleeps coming soon  
  
Cause I could break like a bird  
Or I could swallow the sea  
It seems like the daylight is coming  
And no one is watching but me  
  
But I dont mind the dark discovering the day  
Cause the night  
Is a beautiful bright blue and grey  
  
And what brings me down now is love  
Cause I can never get enough  
  
And its a dangerous time for a heart on a wire  
Shuttled from station to station noisily  
Now knowing why  
  
So I put my head on the ground  
And the sky is a wheel  
Spinning these days into things that Ive lost  
But you can keep all the years  
  
But I dont mind the days gone rolling away  
Cause this sunlight  
Feels warm on my face today  
  
And what brings me down now is love  
Cause I can never get enough of love
