Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum  
Hoist the mainsail here I come  
Aint no room on board for the insincere  
Youre my witness  
Im your mutineer  
  
I was born to rock the boat  
Some may sink but we will float  
Grab your coat lets get out of here  
Youre my witness  
Im your mutineer  
  
Long ago we laughed at shadows  
Lightning flashed and thunder followed us  
It could never find us here  
Youre my witness  
Im your mutineer

Grab your coat lets get out of here  
Youre my witness  
Im your mutineer  
Youre my witness  
Im your mutineer  
Im your mutineer
