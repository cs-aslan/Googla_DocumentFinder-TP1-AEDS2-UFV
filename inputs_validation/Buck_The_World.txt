Chorus  
Woke up screaming fuck the world today I had it up to here  
Exgirlfriend got custody today cause they say she feels  
That Ill never be the daddy that she wants me to be  
Hardest thing Ive ever had to do sayin bye to my seeds ohhh  
  
Chorus  
  
Damn look at what I call my life a glock9  
And a eightball of white I got mine  
Well not quite I got signed  
And fifty put me right in the light it took time  
Meanwhile Im livin the life  
Where a nigga just might see prison tonight  
My rent due baby need food and shoes  
Im flat broke still I refuse to lose  
So I smoke lookin for the fools with jewels  
Im bout to see if its true what a Uzi do  
Nobody cares and life aint fair or free  
The best thang you can do is say a prayer for me  
And how dare yall try to lock me up  
You not here so you aint really givin a fuck  
But I swear as long as Im breathin Im hustlin  
Im thuggin and this is the reason because I  
  
Chorus  
  
If you see me in a suit and tie in a suit and tie  
Tell all my niggaz goodbye tell my niggaz goodbye  
Tell em that Im on my wayyyyy tell em Im on my way man  
Say a prayer for me and hug the kids hug the kids  
Tell God all of the shit I did the shit I did  
And how the kids looked up to me cause they did look up to me nigga  
Yeahhhh  
  
Heyyy holla if you feel my pain  
I been to hell and back and Im still the same  
The block hotter than flames but we sell the caine  
Puttin all kind of thangs in our babys name  
Tell the hoes Im rich bitch like my name Rick James  
I really aint got shit but I cant complain  
Cause LT got life and Big Ju got fifty  
Jimmy did his ten and D doin his twenty  
Come get me seems like its no way out  
So when I say Dirty you say South  
Tryin to put my hands on somethin brush off my shoulders  
Buy up some land or somethin get what they owe us  
You dont have a plan youre nuttin is what they told us  
Remember what the OGs showed to the soldiers  
Gotta make it to heaven or die tryin to get it  
The day dude fuck with Dre I was feelin like  
  
Chorus
