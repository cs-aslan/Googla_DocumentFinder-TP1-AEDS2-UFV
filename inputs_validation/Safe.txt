Hard to find a way to get through  
Its a tragedy  
Pulling at me like the stars do  
Youre like gravity  
Even if the wind blows  
It makes it hard to believe  
  
How ya gonna love  
How ya gonna feel  
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real  
And If you lost your way  
I will keep you safe  
Well open up all the world inside  
I see it come alive tonight  
I will keep you safe  
  
Doesnt even matter to you  
To see what I can see  
Im crawling on the floor to reach you  
Im a wreck you see  
When youre far from home now  
Makes it hard to believe  
  
So how ya gonna love  
How ya gonna feel  
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real  
  
If youve lost your way  
I will keep you safe  
Well open up all your world inside  
Til you come alive tonight  
I will keep you safe  
  
We all fall down  
We all feel down  
Cause rainy days and summer highs  
The more we pray the more we feel alive  
  
How ya gonna love  
How ya gonna feel  
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real  
How ya gonna love  
How ya gonna feel  
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real  
  
If youve lost your way  
I will keep you safe  
Well open up all your world inside  
So you come alive tonight  
I will keep you safe  
  
Well I will keep you safe  
I will keep you safe
