Ive had to think up a way to survive  
Since you said its over  
Told me goodbye  
I just cant make it one day without you  
Unless I pretend that the opposites true  
Rivers flow backwards  
Valleys are high  
Mountains are level  
Truth is a lie  
Im perfectly fine  
And I dont miss you  
The sky is green  
And the grass is blue  
  
How much can a heart and a troubled mind take  
Where is that fine line before it all breaks  
Can one end their sorrow  
Just cross over it  
And into that realm of insanitive bliss  
  
Theres snow in the tropics  
Theres ice on the sun  
Its hot in the arctic  
And crying is fun  
And Im happy now  
And Im glad were through  
And the sky is green  
And the grass is blue  
  
And the rivers flow backwards  
And my tears are dry  
Swans hate the water  
And eagles cant fly  
But Im alright now  
Now that Im over you  
And the sky is green  
And the grass is blue  
And I dont love you  
And the grass is blue
