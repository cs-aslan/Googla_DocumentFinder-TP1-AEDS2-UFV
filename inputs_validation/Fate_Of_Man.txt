Pity a man for he dont know  
The trouble hell pass goin down lifes road  
  
When a man is one and twenty he thinks he knows it all  
He cant see down the road of life where hell ever fall  
But fall he will as he travels through life  
With all its pitfalls troubles and strife  
  
Now at 50 hes goin real strong  
He has him a family and a nice little home  
But old age is creeping up his spine  
And the day is comin when the sun wont shine  
  
Now at 60 he wont have to guess  
Hes already missed the boat that leads to success  
But hes done his best and he cant see why  
The fame of life just passed him by  
  
Now at 70 he can see the light  
And he knows hes never been very bright  
But hes done his best as hes travelled by  
And now all he can do is just sit and sigh  
  
Pity a man for he dont know  
The trouble hell pass goin down lifes road  
  
Now at 80 hes ready for the wreath  
Hes wore out his hair and two sets of teeth  
He has rheumatism in his hands and feet  
And nothin seems good to eat  
  
So you can pity him as he goes up the line  
As he wobbles on the spindle and his almost blind  
And you can tell by the way that he travels alone  
That it wont be long before hes goin home  
  
But if hes kept the commandments as hes travelled through life  
Hell have a home in heaven where therell be no strife  
Hes worked all his life to get things the way he wants em  
He comes here against his will and he goes away disappointed
