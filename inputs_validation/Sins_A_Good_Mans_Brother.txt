Sins A Good Mans Brother  
  
Aint seen a night things work out right go by  
Things on my mind and I just dont have the time and it dont seem right  
Aint seen a day that I dont hear people say they know theyre gonna die  
This may seem a little bit crazy but I dont think you should be so lazy  
If you think youve heard this before well stick around Im gonna tell you
more  
  
One just like the other sins a good mans brother but is that right  
You tell me that I dont then I say I wont but then I might  
You said this is the way its supposed to be but it just dont seem right to
me and thats outta sight  
Some folks need an education dont give up or well loose the nation  
You say we need a revolution It seems to be the only solution
