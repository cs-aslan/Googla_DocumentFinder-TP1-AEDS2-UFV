I eat food to satisfy my hunger  
I drink water to quench my thirst  
I use my mouth and air to blow balloon up  
I prick with pin to watch it burst  
To make noise I use my breathe  
To unlock doors I use a key  
When Im looking for something I use my eyes  
I use booze to unlock me  
  
I sweep so I can sleep  
I sweep so I can sleep  
  
Sweep sweep sweep sweep sweep  
  
I wear shoes so I can run  
As to avoid the broken glass  
I wear the pants because they suit me  
And to discourage the pinchin of ass  
Ill tell a joke to make you laugh  
Ill close the door to have a cry  
They say that change and pain is a positive thing  
Have I changed since you died  
  
I sweep so I can sleep  
I sweep so I can sleep  
  
Sweep sweep sweep sweep sweep  
  
Dont ask me why I smoke  
I dont know  
But I drink to get drunk  
  
Dont ask me why I smoke  
I dont know  
But I drink to get drunk  
  
Dont ask me why I smoke  
I dont know  
But I drink to get drunk  
  
Dont ask me why I smoke  
I dont know  
But I drink to get drunk
