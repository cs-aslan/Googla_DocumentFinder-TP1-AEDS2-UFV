I used to get mad at my school  
The teachers that taught me werent cool  
Holding me down and turning me round  
Filling me up with your rules  
  
Got to admit its getting better  
Its getting better all the time  
Have to admit its getting better  
Its getting better since youll be mine  
  
I used to be angry young man  
Me hiding me head in the sand  
You gave me the word I finally heard  
Im doing the best that I can  
  
Got to admit its getting better  
Its getting better all the time  
Have to admit its getting better  
Its getting better since youll be mine  
Getting so much better all the time  
  
Its getting better all the time better better better  
Its getting better all the time better better better  
  
I used to be cruel to my woman I beat her  
And kept her apart from the things that she loved  
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene  
And Im doing the best that I can  
  
Got to admit its getting better  
Its getting better all the time  
Have to admit its getting better  
Its getting better since youll be mine  
Getting so much better all the time
