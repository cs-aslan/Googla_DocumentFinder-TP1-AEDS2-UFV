Its cloudy out in Pittsburgh  
Its rainin in Saigon  
Snows fallin all across the Michigan line  
Well she sits by the light of her Christmas tree  
With the radio softly on  
Thinkin how a good man is so hard to find  
  
Well once she had a fella  
Once she was somebodys girl  
And she gave all she had that one last time  
Now theres a little girl asleep in the back room  
Shes gonna have to tell about the meanness in this world  
And how a good man is so hard to find  
  
Well theres pictures on the table by her bed  
Him in his dress greens and her in her wedding white  
She remembers how the world was the day he left  
And now how that world is dead  
And a good man is so hard to find  
  
She got no time now for Casanovas  
Yeah those days are gone  
She dont want that anymore shes made up her mind  
Just somebody to hold her  
As the night gets on  
When a good man is so hard to find  
  
Well she shuts off the TV  
And without a word  
Into bed she climbs  
Well she thinks how it was all so wasted  
And how expendable their dreams all were  
When a good man was so hard to find  
Well its cloudy out in Pittsburgh
