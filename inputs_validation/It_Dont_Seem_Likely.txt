Likely it dont seem likely  
Faithless love getting me down  
Got your head spinning around  
With faithless love it aint my style  
Take my hand stay for a while  
You may think that I could walk away  
And think that I dont plan to stay  
Well you think what you want  
Me I say that it dont seem likely  
Oh no  
Cause it all really matters  
Take a look at it my way  
I want to keep it together  
Likely it dont seem likely  
  
Look ahead what do you see  
Simple times times made of need  
Life to day moves with the tide  
Stormy seas harbor of light  
You may think that I could turn and go  
Run away with any soandso  
Well you think what you like  
Me I know  
That it dont seem likely  
Oh no  
See a whole lot of sense an  
Take a look at it my way  
Oh yeah  
It dont seem likely  
  
Youll finally get it when youre least aware  
Out alone or in your easy chair  
Its so slow but youll know  
That I care  
But it dont seem likely  
Cause I know it really matters  
Take a look at it my way  
I want to keep us together  
Though it dont seem likely oh no  
Cause I know what really matters  
I want to keep it together  
Though it dont seem likely  
Oh no  
Likely
