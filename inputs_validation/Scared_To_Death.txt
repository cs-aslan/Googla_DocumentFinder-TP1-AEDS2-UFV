Grit your teeth and listen for the gun  
Get in the runners block and kneel  
And run the human race  
That decadent decathlon and  
Let the games begin for real  
Stop scaring me its bedlam in paradise  
Stop I cant see nowhere I can hide  
Scared to run this monstrous  
Marathon of fear  
  
I run the races with a dark horse to win  
Across a finish line of fear  
I swim a sea of skin afraid to drown in flesh  
Xgenerations revolutions here  
Scared to have sex I dont want to die  
Scared Ill be next Im scared for my life  
Dying to live but there aint no way  
Outta here alive all were all scared theres  
  
Nowhere to run Im scared to death  
Nowhere to hide scared Ill be next  
Oh stop stop stop stop  
Nowhere to run Im scared to death  
Nowhere to hide scared Ill be next  
Oh stop stop stop stop  
  
Am I a prisoner of the universe  
Is destiny fixed among the stars  
Should I cry or laugh  
All I know is that  
The best time to laugh  
Is any time you can  
Lifes one big party thrown here by God  
We all get invitations if we want them or not  
Its all truth or dare and nothing is fair no  
No no  
Were all scared theres  
  
Oh its the decade of fear  
No way out of here no no no  
No no no no no no no no no  
Oh scream in my ears  
Oh stop what I hear no no no  
No no no no no no no no no
