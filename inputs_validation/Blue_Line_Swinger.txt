You you wont talk about what we see when the lights are out  
And Im willing to hold your hand while youre lost  
While youre so full of doubt  
Walk for miles on your own loose ends Ill find you there  
Ill find you there  
  
You you walk up thin blue lines possible with reality  
And I I see through small red eyes  
Glowing still at your uncertainty  
Out of darkness you will come around I know you will  
I know you will  
And Ill find you  
And Ill find you there
