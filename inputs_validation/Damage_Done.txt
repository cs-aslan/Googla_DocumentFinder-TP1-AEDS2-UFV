Check the damage girl  
You got a car crash  
A new stash  
Stage fright  
Who do you worship now  
You got a mistress  
A new bitch to get you high  
Fifififififind it  
Or youre gonna freak out  
Youre fucking out of your mind  
Cant you see the damage done  
Is all over now  
You cant cry anymore girl  
Cause your tears dried up  
With the needle and the score yeah  
Lielielielielielielike it or not  
You cant stop  
Such a heavenly ride  
Memorize the number  
Got a beepbeepbeeper  
The bump on Riverside  
Check my best friend out  
Shes burned out  
But shes beautiful inside  
Cant you see the damage done  
Is all over now  
You cant cry anymore girl  
Cause your tears dried up  
When you woke up on the floor  
Cant you see the damage done  
Its all over now  
You dont try anymore girl  
And I need you now  
Like I never did before  
These moments are sacret  
Youre my religion my love my life  
Venice beach  
Orange sunset  
I say life  
You say suicide  
And I try to stop you girl  
I try to keep you close  
Try to take you home  
Were two girls with one soul  
Two girls with one soul  
Two girls with one soul  
My angel  
Haleakala  
Haleakala  
Cant you see the damage done  
Its all over now
