The way you move  
Has got me yearning  
The way you move  
Has left me burning  
I know you know what youre doing to me  
I know my hands will never be free  
I know what its like to be  
In chains  
  
The way you move  
Is meant to haunt me  
The way you move  
To tempt and taunt me  
I know you knew on the day you were born  
I know somehow I shouldve been warned  
I know I walk every midnight to dawn  
In Chains  
  
In chains Im in chains  
In chains Im in chains  
  
Youve got me dying for you  
Its you that Im living through  
Youve got me praying to you  
Saying to you anything you want me to  
Youve got me reaching for you  
My souls beseeching me too  
Youve got me singing to you  
Bringing to you anything you ask me to  
  
The way you move  
Is mesmerizing  
The way you move  
Is hypnotizing  
I know I crumble when you are around  
Start to mumble a bit of a false sound  
Straggle stumble shackled and bound  
In chains  
  
In chains Im in chains  
In chains Im in chains  
  
Youve got me dying for you  
Its you that Im living through  
Youve got me praying to you  
Saying to you anything you want me to  
Youve got me reaching for you  
My souls beseeching me too  
Youve got me singing to you  
Bringing to you anything you ask me to  
  
Im in chains  
  
In chains Im in chains  
In chains Im in chains  
In chains Im in chains
