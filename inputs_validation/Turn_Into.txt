I know what I know I know  
On the car ride down  
I hear it in my head real low  
Turn into  
The only thing I ever  
Turn into  
Hope I do  
Turn into you  
  
I know what I know I know  
That girl you found  
Keeps that kind of window closed  
Shell turn into  
The only thing you ever  
Turn into  
Hope I do  
Turn into you  
  
Cant say why I kept this from you  
My those quiet eyes become you  
Leave it where it cant remind us  
Turn this all around behind us  
Oh Well I know  
Ill fall right in to keep you out  
Id like to tell you all about it  
  
I know what I know I know  
This last time around  
Ill hear it in my head real low  
Turn into  
The only thing you ever know  
  
I know what I know I know  
Ah yes
