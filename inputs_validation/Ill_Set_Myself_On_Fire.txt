Ha Ha Ha  
Ho Ho Ho  
Now you see it  
Now you dont  
Has no bones  
To hurt your throat  
Good and sweet  
Nice to eat  
If you like it  
Just repeat  
  
Ill set myself on fire  
Ill set myself on fire  
Ill set myself on fire  
Oh strike my hand  
On a stone Joan  
God knows this is yuk  
Do it all in unison  
Ha ha ha  
Ho ho ho  
  
We have the pool  
Ah  no thats cruel  
Why do you take me for  
A fool  
Try the rails  
Its just not me  
No no no  
No  Siree
