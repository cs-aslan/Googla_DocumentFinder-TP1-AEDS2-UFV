There are no words I can use  
Because the meaning still leaves for you to choose  
And I couldnt stand to let them be abused by you  
  
Dreams I had just last night  
Made me scared white with fright  
But Im over to that sunnyside road  
Over to that sunnyside road  
  
Fortunes come and fortunes go  
But things get better babe thats one thing I know  
And Im over to that Sunnyside road  
Over to that Sunnyside road  
  
I have a friend that I have met  
Who gives me love and a certain respect  
Just a little respect everybody needs just a little respect  
That means youyou  
  
And in a little while our love will spread  
To you  
Aint no matter who inside this world you know  
Therell he someone who will love you just for who you are  
Really are  
  
Dreams I had just last night  
Made me worried to face up to the light  
But Im over to that Sunnyside road  
Over to that Sunnyside road  
  
Come on now its freedom calling  
Come on over and find yourself  
Come on now its freedom calling  
Come on in and remind yourself  
  
Oh darling you see my face  
But its in my heart thats where its taking place  
And I couldnt stand to let it go to waste  
Can you  
  
Oh love sweet blue love  
No man can ever get enough  
But maybe one day well all die in love  
Will youoh love sweet love mylove  
  
Oh babe understand  
Take my love thats all I have at hand  
Please say you willdont say you cant  
Oh will you will you will you  
  
The moment you walked inside my door  
I knew that I need not look no more  
Ive seen many other girls before ah but darling  
Heaven mustve programmed you  
  
The moment you fell inside my dreams  
I realized all I had not seen  
Ive seen many other girls before ah hot darling  
Heaven mustve programmed you  
  
You can live in the largest house  
And eleven apartments too  
Run your own private plane  
And a boat in Malibu  
  
But till you know deep down what inside you really need  
Well I love you baby ooh my dear  
And I think about you sometimes  
But when youre with me boy it chokes my mind  
  
Come on now its freedom calling  
Come on over and find yourself  
Come on now its freedom calling  
Come on in and remind yourself  
  
Man must fight for freedom sure thats what most other people would say  
Look for a body to lead them but theres too many to lead them away  
Why wait until its your time to die before you learn what you were born to
do  
Come on now its freedom calling but theres only one freedom for you  
Love love boy  
And I cant wait to be with you tomorrow night  
  
Wont you give me your word that you wont laugh  
Cause youve been a saving grace to me  
And Id hate to face a day without you around  
My life would be without sound  
  
Love love love love mustve made you on a Sunday  
Cause you taste to me as good as god made honey taste babe  
And the sky all glistens with gold  
When youre talking to me  
And the whirling wind turns to song  
Why it sets my soul free  
  
Love love love Love mustve made you on a Sunday  
There are no words I can use  
Because the meaning still leaves for you to choose  
And I couldnt stand to let them be abused by you
