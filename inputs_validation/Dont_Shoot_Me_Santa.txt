Oh Santa  
Ive been waiting on you  
Thats funny kid  
Because Ive been coming for you  
Oh Santa  
Ive been killing just for fun  
Well the party is over kid  
Because I because I got a bullet in my gun  
A bullet in your what  
Santas got a bullet in his gun you know it  
Santas got a bullet in his gun  
Dont shoot me Santa Clause  
Ive been a clean living boy  
I promise you did every little thing you ask me to  
I cant believe the things Im going through  
Dont shoot me Santa Clause  
No one else around believes me  
But the children on the block they tease me  
I couldnt let them off that easy  
Oh Santa  
Its been a real hard year  
There just aint no getting around this  
Life is hard but look at me I turned out alright  
Hey Santa  
Why dont we talk about it work it out  
Believe me this aint what I wanted  
I love all you kids you know that hell  
I remember when you were just 10 years old  
Playing out in the desert  
Just waiting for a sip of that  
Sweet Mojave rain  
In the sweet Mojave rain  
The boy was on his own  
Dont shoot me Santa Clause  
Ive been a clean living boy  
I promise you did every little thing you ask me to  
I cant believe the things Im going through  
Hey Santa Clause  
No one else around believes me  
But the children on the block they tease me  
I couldnt let them off that easy  
They had it coming so why cant you see  
I couldnt turn my check no longer  
The sun is going down and Christmas is near  
Just look the other way and Ill disappear forever  
Dont shoot me Santa Clause  
No one else around believes me  
But the children on the street they tease me  
I couldnt let them off that easy  
Believe me Santa Santa
