Horses are running wide open I just gotta ride  
To those honkytonk bars that stay open way past closing time  
Songs bout free thinkin and drinkin sure light my fire  
That flame leaves a scar on my heart like an old branding iron  
  
Chorus  
She said Rodeo man where are you going  
Dont you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone  
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire  
Then Ill lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider  
  
Yesterdays nothing but dust I brush off my boots  
While Im wearing out roads dont you know that Im sure missing you  
When I leave youll be wondering when Ill be back again  
Between Texas and ranchers and old friends where do you fit in  
  
Chorus  
  
Cmon  
  
Hey Rodeo man where are you going  
Dont you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone  
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire  
Then Ill lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider  
Woman come lay down beside me and be my shotgun rider
