Hes a square peg in a round hole  
Misfit in a slick world  
Dont play the game  
Dont do what hes told  
Hes a square peg in a round hole  
  
Square peg dont care  
The bright lights hes not there  
Catch the shadows see him slip away  
Square peg thats what they say  
Square peg Square peg  
  
Square peg you have got to be strong  
Square peg hes got his own song  
Square peg Ill see you around  
Square peg face down  
  
Square peg round hole
