You look so sorry please tell me whats wrong  
Just what are you thinking you look so forlorn  
Maybe youre thinking that I have been untrue  
So let me assure you and tell you the truth  
Im not one to fool around  
The mistake that I made was not meant to hurt you  
I needed somehow to try and find out  
How I really felt inside  
And I know Im  
  
Still in Love Im so  
Still in Love  
Im gonna be all you want me to be cause I am  
Still in Love ooh  
Still in Love yeah  
Im gonna do all you want me to do  
  
Dont ask no questions wont tell you lies  
Its something that happened in which I cant disguise  
I needed somebody to take me away  
From feelings of doubt which in my mind delay  
But youve always been the one  
And there are days when I know I should have told you  
  
So please dont cry  
cause Im gonna try  
To make you believe in me  
And I know Im  
  
Still in Love Im so  
Still in Love  
Im gonna be all you want me to do  
  
You must be the one for me  
cause as hard as I try  
I just cant you go  
So that you know baby  
Please please dont go  
cause you are just all that I need  
And I know Im  
  
Still in Love Im so  
Still in Love  
Im gonna be all you want me to be cause I am  
Still in Love ooh  
Still in Love yeah  
Im gonna do all you want me to do
