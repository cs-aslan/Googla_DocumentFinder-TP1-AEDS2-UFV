Why do you hurt yourself  
You do it very well  
You do it so politely  
That you couldnt even tell  
When everything has changed  
You think youre not to blame  
How come you keep on talking  
When the whole thing feels so strange  
But seeing  
Is not the same as believing  
When everything goes wrong  
Youre anything but strong  
Its all bittersweet  
Outside in the street  
The grass is growing greener  
Underneath your feet  
We come and go  
Deep water flows  
Tiny leaves from small seeds  
To tall trees do grow  
But wanting  
Is not the same thing as needing  
Theres no need to pretend  
You cant turn back again  
And loving  
Is so different to keeping  
The hurting that we send  
Is so difficult to mend  
Hold on to the good things  
That keep you from falling down  
Hold on to the good things  
That keep you from falling down  
How my heart aches  
More than I can take  
What are we really learning  
When we make the same mistakes  
Where is your hope  
Its all gone up in smoke  
You used to be so funny  
Now its just the same old joke  
And laughing  
Is so very close to crying  
When theres nothing to defend  
It gets you in the end  
And living  
Is so very close to dying  
You struggle on and on  
To find where you belong  
Where do you belong
