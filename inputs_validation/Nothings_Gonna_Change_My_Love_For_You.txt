If I had to live my life without you near me  
The days would all be empty  
The nights would seem so long  
With you I see forever oh so clearly  
I might have been in love before  
But it never felt this strong  
Our dreams are young and we both know  
Theyll take us where we want to go  
Hold me now touch me now  
I dont want to live without you  
  
Chorus  
Nothings gonna change my love for you  
You ought to know by now how much I love you  
One thing you can be sure of  
Ill never ask for more than your love  
Nothings gonna change my love for you  
You ought to know by now how much I love you  
The world may change my whole life through  
But nothings gonna change my love for you  
  
If the road ahead is not so easy  
Our love will lead a way for us  
Like a guiding star  
Ill be there for you if you should need me  
You dont have to change a thing  
I love you just the way you are  
So come with me and share the view  
Ill help you see forever too  
Hold me now touch me now  
I dont want to live without you  
  
Chorus
