Oh say can you see  
By the dawns early light  
What so proudly we hailed  
At the twilights last gleaming  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars  
Through the perilous fight  
Oer the ramparts we watched  
Were so gallantly streaming  
And the rockets red glare  
The bombs bursting in air  
Gave proof through the night  
That our flag was still there  
Oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave  
For the land of the free and the home of the brave
