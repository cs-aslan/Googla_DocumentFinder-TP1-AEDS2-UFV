Were sailing on a strange boat  
Heading for a strange shore  
Were sailing on a strange boat  
Heading for a strange shore  
Carrying the strangest cargo  
That was ever hauled aboard  
  
Were sailing on a strange sea  
Blown by a strange wind  
Were sailing on a strange sea  
Blown by a strange wind  
Carrying the strangest crew  
That ever sinned  
  
Were riding in a strange car  
Were followin a strange star  
Were climbing on the strangest ladder  
That was ever there to climb  
  
Were living in a strange time  
Working for a strange goal  
Were living in a strange time  
Working for a strange goal  
Were turning flesh and body  
Into soul
