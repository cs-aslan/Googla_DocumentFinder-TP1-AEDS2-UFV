Everybody read about it  
You can find it in the checkout line  
They say I got husbands aleavin boyfriends acallin  
And problems that aint even mine  
Well all that trash dont bother me none  
Its all just part of the game  
Im just a goodhearted downhome country girl  
And you all know my name  
  
Chorus  
  
I like to ride  
I need my space  
And I love being at home  
But if you wanna get right into my heart  
Take a left at the wyld unknown  
The wyld unknown  
  
You dont wanna cross my little mama  
And you sure dont wanna mess with me  
Cause theres a wild streak running down from the roots  
To the top of my family tree  
Im a woman of passion a woman of faith  
As honest as I can be  
To tell you the truth Im bulletproof  
So take your best shot at me  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Bridge  
  
The wyld unknown  
Ill show you somethin that  
You aint never been shown  
  
Whenever trouble finds me  
I always take my share of the blame  
Im the kind of girl who can rock your world  
Or love you like a hurricane  
Im a woman of passion a woman of faith  
As honest as I can be  
To tell you the truth Im bulletproof  
So take your best shot at me  
  
Repeat Chorus
