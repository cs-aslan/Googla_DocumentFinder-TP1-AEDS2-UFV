On glory day well get the gifts of heaven up above  
All around you hope and joy to find and fall in love  
  
Can you feel that maximum joy  
Rolling round like a brand new boy  
Rain and sunshine from heaven  
  
Feeling the wonder of sun rain and thunder  
Unraveling lifes mysteries living to make history  
Free at last

Rolling round like a brand new boy  
Rain and sunshine from heaven

Rolling round like a brand new boy  
Rain and sunshine from heaven

Let dreamers dream and lovers leap  
I pray for you our souls to keep free at last  
  
Can you feel that maximum joy  
Rolling round like a brand new boy  
Rain and sunshine from heaven  
  
Can you feel that maximum joy  
Rolling round like a brand new boy  
Rain and sunshine from heaven

And tie you to a star thats rising dancing on the moon on the moon
