We might have been meant for each other  
To be or not to be let our hearts discover  
I have a feelin its a feelin Im concealin I dont know why  
Its just a mental incidental sentimental alibi  
But I adore you so strong for you  
Why go on stallin Im fallin love is callin why be shy  
  
Lets fall in love  
Why shouldnt we fall in love  
Our hearts are made of it  
Lets take a chance why be afraid of it  
  
Lets close our eyes  
And make our own paradise  
Little we know of it  
Still we can try to make a go of it  
  
Now we might have been meant for each other  
To be or not to be let our hearts discover  
  
Lets fall in love  
Why shouldnt we fall in love  
Now is the time for it while we are young  
Lets fall in love  
  
Lets fall in love  
Lets fall in love
