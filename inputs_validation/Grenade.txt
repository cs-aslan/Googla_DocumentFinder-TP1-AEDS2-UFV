Easy come easy go thats just how you live oh  
Take take take it all but you never give  
Should have known you was trouble from the first kiss  
Had your eyes wide open  
Why were they open  
  
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash  
You tossed it in the trash you did  
To give me all your love is all I ever asked cause  
What you dont understand is Id catch a grenade for ya yeah yeah  
Throw my head on a blade for ya yeah yeah  
Id jump in front of a train for ya yeah yeah  
You know Id do anything for ya yeah yeah  
  
Oh oh I would go through all this pain  
Take a bullet straight through my brain  
Yes I would die for ya baby  
But you wont do the same

Black black black and blue  
Beat me til Im numb  
Tell the devil I said hey when you get back to where youre from  
Mad woman bad woman

Yeah youll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car  
  
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash  
You tossed it in the trash yes you did  
To give me all your love is all I ever asked  
Cause what you dont understand is  
  
Id catch a grenade for ya yeah yeah  
Throw my head on a blade for ya yeah yeah
