Youre taking a walk on the wild side  
If youre gonna take a chance with me  
Im gonna make you take a look on the inside  
And you might not like what you see  
So dont you knock on my door  
If you dont want an answer  
Or gimme a beat  
If you dont want a dancer  
  
Ive got my love gun loaded  
Ive got you in my sight  
I never take no for an answer  
So youd better say yes tonight  
I told you the score  
Right from the start  
Youll never get to heaven  
If you break my heart  
  
So if you dont mean business  
Knock on someone elses door  
Cause its a mean mean business  
Staying alive if you fool with me  
  
You say you want my money  
I say youve got no sense  
If you just want to bleed me dry  
Stay on your side of the fence  
No mercy you can see  
Cause seven to eleven made a fool out of me  
  
So if you dont mean business  
Knock on someone elses door  
Cause its a mean mean business  
Staying alive if you fool with me  
  
Youre taking a walk on the wild side  
If youre gonna take a chance with me  
Im gonna make you take a look on the inside  
And you might not like what you see  
So dont you knock on my door  
If you dont want an answer  
Or gimme a beat  
If you dont want a dancer  
  
So if you dont mean business  
Knock on someone elses door  
Cause its a mean mean business  
Staying alive if you fool with me
