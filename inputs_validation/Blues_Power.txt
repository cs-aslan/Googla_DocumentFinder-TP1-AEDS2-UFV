Bet you didnt think I knew how to rock n roll  
Oh I got the boogiewoogie right down in my very soul  
There aint no need for me to be a wallflower  
Cause now Im living on blues power  
  
I knew all the time but now Im gonna let you know  
Im gonna keep on rocking no matter if its fast or slow  
Aint gonna stop until the twentyfifth hour  
Cause now Im living on blues power  
  
Talking to you now  
The boogies gonna pull me through  
Keep on keep on keep on keeping on  
Keep on keeping on keep on keeping on
