Something stops me from seeing too clear  
A misty haze floats round the room  
The murmurs make it hard to hear  
The voices and the words  
The days seem to drag away  
My speech is sparse and tends to slur  
I wonder what happened to my friend to day  
Cant hear the words  
  
Chorus  
Your name has slipped my mind again  
Your name has slipped my mind again  
  
Its hard to focus in this light  
Im growing warm and feeling dull  
The heartbeat pounds with vicious fright  
Theres something to remember  
I clench my fist but feel no sensation  
The walls around me spin and sway  
A flash back image in my vision  
I remember  
  
Repeat chorus 3 times
