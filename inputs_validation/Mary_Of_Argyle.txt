I have heard the mavis singing  
His love song to the moon  
I have seen the dewdrop clinging  
To the rose just nearly born  
But a sweeter song has cheerd me  
At the evenings gentle close  
And Ive seen an eye still brighter  
Than the dewdrop on the rose  
twas thy voice my gentle mary  
And thine artless winning smile  
That made this world an eden  
Bonie mary of argyle  
Tho thy voice may lose its sweetness  
Thine eye its brightness too  
Tho thy step may lack its fleetness  
And thy hair its sunny hue  
Still to me wilt thou be dearer  
Than all the world shall own  
I have loved thee for thy beauty  
But not for that alone  
I have watched thy heart dear mary  
And its goodness was the wile  
That has made thee mine forever  
Bonnie mary of argyle
