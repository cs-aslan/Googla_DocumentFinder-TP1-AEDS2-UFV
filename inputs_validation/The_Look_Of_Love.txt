The look of love is in your eyes  
A look your smile cant disguise  
The look of loove is saying so much more than just words could ever say  
And what my heart has heard well it takes my breath away  
  
I can hardly wait to hold you feel my arms around you  
How long I have waited  
Waited just to love you now that I have found you  
Dont ever go Youve got the  
  
Look of love its on your face  
A look that time cant erase  
Be mine toniight let this be just the start of so many nights like this  
Lets take a lovers vow and then seal it with a kiss  
  
I can hardly wait to hold you feel my arms around you  
How long I have waited  
Waited just to love you now that I have found you  
Dont ever go  
Dont ever go  
  
I love you so  
I love you so  
I love you so
