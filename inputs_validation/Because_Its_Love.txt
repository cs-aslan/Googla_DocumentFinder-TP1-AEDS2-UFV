Every time I look at your face  
I get this feeling  
Every time I look in your eyes  
It starts healing  
Every time we walk side by side  
Yes I get this feeling  
Because its love yes its love  
Oh its love  
Chorus  
And we climb a step  
Every day its you and I  
We climb a step  
Every day and every night  
Its every time you look at my face  
You give me this feeling  
Every time you look in my eyes  
My heart starts to tumble  
Oh I think of you all the time  
Its you I believe in  
Because its love yes its love  
Oh its love  
Chorus 1x  
Every time I look at your face  
I get this feeling  
Because its love yes its love  
And its love  
Chorus 2x
