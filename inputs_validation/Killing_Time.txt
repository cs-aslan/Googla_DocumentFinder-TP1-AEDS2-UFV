I need your confidence need to know youre mine  
When it gets right down to the killing time  
I know your heart is bad but its all  
Ive ever had we can live our lives on this righteous crime  
  
I got kicked when I was down  
And a sailor took my girl to town  
Then she licked my wounds with the sea dogs salt I drank a  
Half a bottle of jack swore Id never take you back by the bottles  
End I was on that phone  
  
What you call compromise I dont understand what you call compromise I dont
understand  
  
How do you walk away how do you walk away  
How do you walk away from a woman that gone and done you wrong
