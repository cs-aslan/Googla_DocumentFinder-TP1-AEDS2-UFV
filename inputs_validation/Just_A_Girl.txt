Thieves in the window  
Trouble down the hall  
The resin white ceiling  
Blood dripping flows  
Out on the front line  
Preachers sweep the earth  
Out on their backsides  
With nothing in common with no problem  
  
Shes just a girl  
Just just a girl yeah  
Just one time around  
She has little chance to make good  
Distance of her lie  
Decided in the woods  
  
Burning fires  
Shes led to police  
This maid in progress  
Betrayin your mothers need for a shelter  
  
Oh just a girl  
Just just a girl  
Just one time around  
She had little chance to make good  
Treats them now shes young  
But it can be taken away  
Just one time around can be taken away  
We all make mistakes  
  
Hush my baby dont you cry  
Youre my little alibi  
Oh baby please I need some sleep  
Now be taking  
You with me  
  
Just a girl Repeat x5  
Just a kid yeah
