The heart is a bloom  
Shoots up through the stony ground  
Theres no room  
No space to rent in this town  
  
Youre out of luck  
And the reason that you had to care  
The traffic is stuck  
And youre not moving anywhere  
  
You thought youd found a friend  
To take you out of this place  
Someone you could lend a hand  
In return for grace  
  
Its a beautiful day  
Sky falls you feel like  
Its a beautiful day  
Dont let it get away  
  
Youre on the road  
But youve got no destination  
Youre in the mud  
In the maze of her imagination  
  
Youre lovin this town  
Even if that doesnt ring true  
Youve been all over  
And its been all over you  
  
Its a beautiful day  
Dont let it get away  
Its a beautiful day  
  
Touch me  
Take me to that other place  
Teach me  
I know Im not a hopeless case  
  
See the world in green and blue  
See China right in front of you  
See the canyons broken by cloud  
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out  
See the Bedouin fires at night  
See the oil fields at first light  
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth  
After the flood all the colors came out  
  
It was a beautiful day  
Dont let it get away  
Beautiful day  
  
Touch me  
Take me to that other place  
Reach me  
I know Im not a hopeless case  
  
What you dont have you dont need it now  
What you dont know you can feel it somehow  
What you dont have you dont need it now  
Dont need it now  
Was a beautiful day
