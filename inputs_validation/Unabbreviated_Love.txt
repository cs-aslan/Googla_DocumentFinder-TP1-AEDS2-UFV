How long will I last  
Standing out here on my own  
I wonder did I move too fast  
You know I hate slow dancing alone  
  
I keep leading with my heart  
You keep saying  
That were worlds apart  
That our love is so taboo  
  
These empty arms  
Wont last too long  
Hope you appreciate  
I need your unabbreviated love  
And Ill stick like glue  
Can I anticipate  
I need your unabbreviated love  
  
Now thats how I feel  
Im gonna be your lucky star  
If you stop spinning your wheels  
And sending out these false alarms  
  
Why must love feel like a heart attack  
You held me once and  
You keep coming back  
Oh boy you havent got a clue  
  
Oh these empty arms  
Wont last too long  
Hope you appreciate  
I need your unabbreviated love  
And Ill stick like glue  
Can I anticipate  
I need your unabbreviated   
  
Love is unavoidable  
Love can put you back on track  
As a matter of fact  
Love makes you forget your troubles  
A love like that  
You dont throw back no no  
  
I keep leading with my heart  
You keep saying  
That were worlds apart  
That our love is so taboo  
  
These empty arms  
Wont last too long  
Hope you appreciate  
I need your unabbreviated love  
And Ill stick like glue  
Can I anticipate  
I need your unabbreviated love  
  
to fade  
Need ya yeah  
I wanna hold ya  
I wanna kiss ya  
I need your unabbreviated love  
  
I wanna hold ya  
I wanna squeeze ya yeah  
I need your unabbreviated love
