One time I spent a week inside a little country jail  
And I dont guess Ill ever live it down  
I was sittin at a red light when these two men came and got me  
And said that I was speeding through their town  
  
Well they saidtomorrow morning you can see the judge then go  
They let me call one person on the phone  
I thought Id be there overnight so I just called my boss  
To tell him Id be off but not for long  
  
Well they motioned me inside a cell with seven other guys  
One little barred up window in the rear  
My cellmates said if they had let me bring some money in  
We ought to send the jailer for some beer  
  
Well I had to pay him double cause he was the man in charge  
And the jailers job was not the best in town  
Later on his wife brought hot bologna eggs and gravy  
The first day I was there I turned it down  
  
Well next morning they just let us sleep but I was up real early  
Wonderin when Id get my release  
Later on we got more hot bologna eggs and gravy  
And by now I wasnt quite so hard to please  
  
Two days later when I thought that I had been forgotten  
The sheriff came in chewin on a straw  
He said where is the guy who thinks that this is indianapolis  
Id like to talk to him about the law  
Well I told him who I was and told him I was working steady  
And I really should be gettin on my way  
That part about me bein who I was did not impress him  
He said the judgell be here any day  
  
The jailer had a wife and let me tell you she was awful  
But she brought that hot bologna every day  
And after seven days she got to lookin so much better  
I asked her if shed like to run away  
  
The next mornin that old judge took every nickel that I had  
And he said son let this teach you not to race  
The jailers wife was smilin from the window as I left  
In thirty minutes I was out of state
