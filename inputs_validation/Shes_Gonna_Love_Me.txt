Shes gonna love me like you never could  
Shes gonna treat me like you never would  
Shes gonna love me live Ive never been loved before  
  
You should have grabbed me when you had your chance  
You got a little bit too big for your own leather pants  
I could have told you from the start  
No ones ever taken better care of your heart  
Now your gone I dont care  
Ive got a woman who will always be there and  
  
Shes gonna love me like you never could  
Shes gonna treat me like you never would  
Shes gonna love me like Ive never been loved before  
Shes gonna spin me like a roulette wheel  
Shes gonna treat me like Im her last meal  
Shes gonna love me and I keep comin back for more  
  
Ooh shes gonna love me  
Ooh shes gonna love me  
Shes gonna love me like her favorite hobby  
Throw me down and love me in the hotel lobby  
  
You figured Id just always be around  
You thought we were so hot you could have any boy in town  
Baby Ive got some news for you  
Ive got places to go and people to do  
Yeah I cried a little when you said goodbye  
But now my eyes are filled with tears of joy cus  
Shes gonna love me like you never could  
Shes gonna treat me like you never would
