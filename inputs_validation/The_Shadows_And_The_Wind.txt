Oh theyre moving in again  
Hidden by the shadows  
And the wind  
But well just wait awhile and then  
Well show em all that  
This time we aint giving in  
  
Without a care they  
Sweep aside our dreams  
To try and make way for their own  
No more should we surrender  
To their schemes  
Its time to stand and  
Show em we are not alone  
  
Time has changed us all  
We have our minds  
Life has taught us  
We all have our love  
And its time to use it use it  
  
Nature gave us colour  
Day and night  
So if you really got a reason  
Then you better be right  
The seasons of the year  
Still are spring and fall  
But theres nothing in the world  
Thats says its right to fight  
  
Time has changed us all  
We have our minds  
Life has taught us  
We all have our love  
Why dont we use it  
Come on and use it  
Why dont we use it  
Come on and use it  
  
La la la la la
