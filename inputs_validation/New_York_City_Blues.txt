Life and death in an alley way  
Just a heartbeat away from a maaan  
Whos learned to turn his head away  
From the paiain that draiains the laand  
Harlems not too far from here  
You can smell the garbage feel the fear  
I hear theyre gonna build a skyscraper thereere  
As if we didnt need the extra airair  
  
Chorus  
New York City blueues  
In order to wiin youve got to looose  
Old before your tiime  
The dirt and the griime get into everythiing  
And the papers love to sayayay  
Its the meanest town in the USA  
But I think its okay  
Its the town Ive maade my home  
  
On another side of Park Avenue  
Respectable folks dont knowowow  
Hungry eyes take in the view  
Of the wororld that layays them lowow  
Too many years on a welfare line  
The old song and daance tiime after time  
You can only get so pushed arouound  
Until you want to tear the damn thing dowown  
Tear it dowown  
  
Chorus x 2
