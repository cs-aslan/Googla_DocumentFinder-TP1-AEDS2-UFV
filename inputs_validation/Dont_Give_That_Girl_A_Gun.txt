A jury of my peers  
Im ready to be ritious  
Screaming in her ears  
Im not dignified anymore  
You cant say I didnt call  
I say I love you  
She dont hear me anymore  
  
Dont give that girl a gun  
I said now dont give that girl a gun  
Shes already won  
Shes already won  
  
I made a bad connection  
She says I would have stayed  
I jumped ship abandoned my post  
I didnt think I lost my way  
But how the mighty falls  
I saw her crack a smile  
I dont got a chance of redemption  
She dont believe in the American mile  
  
So take the first shot baby  
It will be real clean  
Im your girlits all me  
And take the second shot baby  
Itll be real cold  
Im your girl  
  
Dont give that girl a gun  
I said now dont give that girl a gun  
Shes already won  
Shes already won  
  
Yeah  
  
Yeah  
  
I sing hold me closer  
Oh somethings happening  
I cant belong again  
And I said I doubt we ever will  
Ever will again  
  
I said dont give that girl a gun  
I said now dont give that girl a gun  
Shes already won already won
