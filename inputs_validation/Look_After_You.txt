If I dont say this now I will surely break  
As Im leaving the one I want to take  
Forgive the urgency but hurry up and wait  
My heart has started to separate  
  
Oh oh oh  
Be my baby  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Ill look after you  
  
There now steady love so few come and dont go  
Will you wont you be the one I always know  
When Im losing my control the city spins around  
Youre the only one who knows you slow it down  
  
Oh oh oh  
Be my baby  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Ill look after you  
  
If ever there was a doubt  
My love she leans into me  
This most assuredly counts  
She says most assuredly  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Be my baby  
Ill look after you  
  
Its always have and never hold  
Youve begun to feel like home  
Whats mine is yours to leave or take  
Whats mine is yours to make your own  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Be my baby  
Oh oh oh
