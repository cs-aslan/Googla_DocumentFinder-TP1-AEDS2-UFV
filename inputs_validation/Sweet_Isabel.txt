The autumn leaves are falling  
Like tears from her eyes  
Theres no see me calling  
The pain you felt inside  
  
And I know youre feeling like you should run away run away  
And I know youre wandering oh why you should stay why you should stay  
  
Chorus  
Sweet sweet Isabel  
Just believe it wont be alright  
Sweet sweet Isabel  
No you dont have to leave tonight  
  
You feel that change is coming  
But you were so afraid inside  
I know your hearts been broken  
Oh wait too many times  
  
And I know youre feeling like you should run away run away  
  
Chorus  
  
You dont have to leave tonight  
You dont have to leave tonight  
You dont have to leave tonight  
You dont have to leave tonight  
No you dont  
  
Chorus  
  
The autumn leaves are falling  
Like tears from her eyes  
Theres no see me calling  
The pain you felt inside
