I rounded first never thought of the worst  
As I studied the shortstops position  
Then crack went my leg like the shell of an egg  
Someone call a decent physician  
Im no Pete Rose I cant pretend  
While my mind is quite flexible  
These brittle bones dont bend  
  
Im growing older but not up  
My metabolic rate is pleasantly stuck  
So let the winds of change blow over my head  
Id rather die while Im living than live while Im dead  
  
Sometimes I see me as an old manatee  
Heading south as the waters grow colder  
He tries to steer clear of the hum drum so near  
It cuts prop scars deep in his shoulders  
Thats how it flows right to the end  
His bodys still flexible but that  
Barnacle brain dont bend  
  
Im growing older but not up  
My metabolic rate is pleasantly stuck  
So let the winds of change blow over my head  
Id rather die while Im living than live while Im dead  
  
So now dont get me wrong  
This is not a sad song  
Just events that I have happened to witness  
And time takes its toll as we head for the poll  
As the days grow more complicated the night life still wins  
  
Im growing older but not up  
My metabolic rate is pleasantly stuck  
So let the winds of change blow over my head  
Id rather die while Im living than live while Im dead  
  
Let the winds of change blow over my head  
Id rather die while Im living than live while Im dead
