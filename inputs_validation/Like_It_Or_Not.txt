Isnt it more the way you do it than the way that you look  
Isnt it in the way you use it not the lessons you took  
Isnt it time you started asking what goes on in your mind  
You wont take no for an answer  
Nobody could tell you your place  
Theyd better not turn round and tell ya  
Even if its straight to your face  
I aint lonely but Im happy if it makes you feel good  
But its no way its a fools way itll end up no good  
Isnt it more the way you do it than the way that you look  
Isnt it in the way you use it not the lessons you took  
Isnt it time you started asking what goes on in your mind  
This is the way I want to do it whether you like it or not  
This is the way I gotta tell you and I aint gonna stop  
Baby I should have let you find it out but in your own time  
So dont be scared of the future  
Everything is looking real fine  
I think my ways gonna suit ya  
But only if youre gonna stay mine  
And you could do and you should do itll make you feel fine  
cause the best way is the best way and well make it on time  
Well Ive been really really wondering am I losing my mind  
Why do we do the things we shouldnt do Wed rather be fine  
Were in a sticky situation and you really dont mind  
This is the way I want to do it whether you like it or not  
This is the way I gotta tell you and I aint gonna stop  
Baby I should have let you find it out but in your own time  
And you could do and you should do itll make you feel fine  
cause the best way is the best way and well make it on time  
Isnt it more the way you do it than the way that you look  
Isnt it in the way you use it not the lessons you took  
Isnt it time you started asking what goes on in your mind  
This is the way I want to do it whether you like it or not  
This is the way I gotta tell you and I aint gonna stop  
Were in a sticky situation and you really dont mind
