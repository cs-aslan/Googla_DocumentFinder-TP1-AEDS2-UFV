Verse 1  
I walk a lonely road  
The only one that I have ever known  
Dont know where it goes  
But its home to me and I walk alone  
  
Verse 2  
I walk this empty street  
On the Boulevard of broken dreams  
Where the city sleeps  
And Im the only one and I walk alone  
  
PreChorus  
I walk alone  
I walk alone  
  
I walk alone  
I walk a  
  
Chorus  
My shadows only one that walks beside me  
My shallow hearts the only thing thats beating  
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me  
Till then I walk alone  
  
Ahah ahah ahah aahah  
Ahah ahah ahah  
  
Verse 3  
Im walking down the line  
That divides me somewhere in my mind  
On the border line of the edge  
And where I walk alone  
  
Read between the lines  
Whats fucked up and everythings all right  
Check my vital signs to know Im still alive  
And I walk alone  
  
PreChorus  
I walk alone  
I walk alone  
  
I walk alone  
I walk a  
  
Chorus  
My shadows only one that walks beside me  
My shallow hearts the only thing thats beating  
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me  
Till then I walk alone  
  
Ahah ahah ahah aahah  
Ahah ahah  
  
I walk alone  
I walk a  
  
Verse 4  
I walk this empty street  
On the Boulevard of broken dreams  
Where the city sleeps  
And Im the only one and I walk a  
  
Chorus  
My shadows only one that walks beside me  
My shallow hearts the only thing thats beating  
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me  
Till then I walk alone
