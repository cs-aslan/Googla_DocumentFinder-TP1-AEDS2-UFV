Fairy tales sometimes come true  
Use fairy dust and pixie glue  
Then all the love will stick to you  
My little lovely  
  
Always believe and never doubt  
That wizards cast their spells about  
Theres such a lot you wont lose count  
If you look closely  
  
Ripples are like dreams  
Searching for the shore  
Poured together make oceans roar  
Night visions make spirits soar  
So choose one wisely  
  
Not all angels can grow wings  
They seem to soar by other means  
You can fly although it seems  
A little slowly  
  
Fairy tales sometimes come true  
Use fairy dust and pixie glue  
Then all the love will stick to you  
My little lovely  
  
Ripples are like dreams  
Searching for the shore  
Poured together make oceans roar  
Night visions make spirits soar  
My little lovely
