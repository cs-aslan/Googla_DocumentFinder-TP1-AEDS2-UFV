Goodbye its time for me to go  
So baby dont cry  
I want you to know that baby  
Ill be back someday  
  
Cheer up  
The skies above are bound to clear up  
I like to stick around but baby  
Ill be back someday  
  
Dont be blue Ill return with love untold  
When I do I want you to have and hold  
  
I know that youll be close to me  
Wherever I go  
So when I say goodbye remember  
Ill be back someday
