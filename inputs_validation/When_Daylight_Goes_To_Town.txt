I remember you when you was me  
Oh what a beautiful sight  
Youd cool it up  
Or youd cool it down  
From some dizzy dizzy height  
I can still hear that rolling sound  
Like a diesel in my head  
Sometimes I wake and I think of you now  
Forgetting that youre dead  
I was born on a rolling train  
Runnin when I hit the ground  
I watch these wheels turning now  
Nothing here nothing left  
Watching the daylight fade away  
Watching the daylight go to town  
Well  
This hotel rooms like the wild wild west  
And theres strangers moving underground  
I still have your photograph  
It picks me up when Im feeling down  
Pull up a chair and you pour me one  
Lets kick back and let it roll  
Theres nothing here  
And theres nothing left  
But watching the daylight go to town  
Wed get swept up on a pillow fight  
You just couldnt let it go  
I watch these wheels turning now  
Nothing here nothing left  
Watching the daylight fade away  
Watching the daylight go to town  
Dont you fade away  
solo  
Well I guess Im walking right back home  
Got to set this all down  
Pull up a chair and you pour me two  
cause theres nothing herenothing left  
But watching the daylight turn around  
Watching the daylight go to town  
Watching this world spin around  
Watching the daylight go to town
