You were lookin at your mother  
So you went and told your father  
Daddy dont say nothin hes got plenty in his past  
Changed your way of thinkin  
So you started drinkin  
And you got arrested for drivin blind  
  
Take the rap take the rap  
Its gonna break your back its a fact take the rap  
  
It was lined up on the mirror  
And you just started shavin  
Didnt know what you were smokin  
Cigarette came from a friend  
Judge said youre delinquent  
You dont want to think it  
So you put your head down started servin time  
  
Take the rap take the rap  
Its gonna break your back take the rap  
  
Tried to talkbut I got nothin to provewhy you want to  
Tried to run they took away my shoeswhy you want to  
Why you want me to take the rap  
  
Take the rap take the rap  
Its gonna break your back take the rap  
  
Well your damned if iron barsll  
Keep you rottin in a prison  
Hell is lookin better cause youll  
Never get to heaven  
See your chance and take it  
Sure youre gonna make it  
Youre prepared to take it cause youre never gonna  
  
Take the rap take the rap  
Its gonna break your back its a fact take the rap
