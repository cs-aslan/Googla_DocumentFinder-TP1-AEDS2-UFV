Colours will change  
I love every shade of you  
Dont lose your faith  
Keep walking out you do  
Dont you say that wasnt worth  
All the pain and all the hurt youre going through  
And Ill always be with you  
  
Goodbye friend  
No this is not the end  
Just go your way  
Somewhere well meet again  
Hold on to the moments we shared  
Those are the chances that once youll be back  
Goodbye friend  
  
The worlds just a place  
That were only passing through  
Heaven awaits  
Those that keep marching through  
Dont you say that loving lost  
Wasnt worth the pain it cost youre going through  
Cause Id take it all for you  
  
Goodbye friend  
No this is not the end  
Lift up your head  
Somewhere with me again  
Or until the moments be shared  
Those are the treasures that wont disappear  
Goodbye friend  
Friend friend friend friend
