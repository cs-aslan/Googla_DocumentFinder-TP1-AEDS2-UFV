I got my head checked  
By a jumbo jet  
It wasnt easy but nothing is no When I feel heavy metal  
And Im pins and Im needles  
Well I lie and Im easy  
All the the time but Im never sure  
Why I need you  
Pleased to meet you I got my head done  
When I was young  
Its not my problem  
Its not my problem When I feel heavy metal  
And Im pins and Im needles  
Well I lie and Im easy  
All the time but I am never sure  
Why I need you  
Pleased to meet you
