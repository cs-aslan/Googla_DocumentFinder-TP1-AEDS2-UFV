New love is blind  
Why dont you see  
You hurt me inside youre killing me  
It makes me sad all the time  
  
To see you around with all these guys  
My hearts in pain  
I need you so  
My loves the same  
So please dont go  
  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need  
  
Lets try again  
Theres still romance  
Well start a new life take a chance  
There are so many ways  
  
Please dont forget it anyday  
My hearts in pain  
I need you so  
My loves the same  
So please dont go  
  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need
