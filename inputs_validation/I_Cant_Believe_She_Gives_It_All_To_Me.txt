I pinch myself when I wake up each mornin  
Cause Im constantly amazed when I see  
Exactly everything Ive always wanted  
But I cant believe she gives it all to me  
Mmm lips that warm my face with mornin kisses  
Arms that reach to hold me tenderly  
And love that always satisfies completely  
But I cant believe she gives it all to me  
She gives me more than any one man deserves  
I who have everything am nothing without her  
Somehow she knows I need her desperately  
I cant believe she gives it all to me
