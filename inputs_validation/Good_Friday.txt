Kanye  
Such an easy mornin we on a ride  
And Im feelin smooth as the way the Benz drive  
Turn the radio down if they playin that bullshit  
They dont want black people to think at trial  
He think he live  
  
Common  
He think he live he think he cold  
He think Im high Im in thinker mode  
Eyes lowd I let the skies hold the thoughts  
The streets are like the high road that I go across  
  
Kanye

The Phillip Lim remind them that its Fashion Week

Sellin kilos through your ipod nano  
Cocaine vandal I induct scandal  
Money drive you crazy look at Marburys handle  
Vaseline face reminiscent of my tires  
Ice cream paint job somethin like Breyers  
Euro tank top Dior inspired  
Sell it to you hard no assembly required  
Eyuck Im 2012 in 2010  
Which makes this a time machine not just any Benz  
Floss for the members of the gang with 28
