Hope weve found our sweet release  
I hope I fill that hole in your soul  
Hope that at last we get some peace  
I hope the light shines on we as one  
  
Therell never be enough to learn  
The rivers deep and the road is long  
And every which way we turn  
Always seems insane  
But it makes me feel alive  
  
Shout it out loud  
When Im alive  
Shout it out loud  
When Im alive  
Shout it out loud  
When Im alive  
Shout it out loud  
  
As we wish the world away  
Dyou think its all a dream  
cause thats what it seems  
  
Every night we hope and pray  
That we can do enough  
To keep our love  
  
Never be enough to learn  
The rivers deep and the road is long  
And every which way we turn  
Always seems insane  
But it makes me feel alive  
  
Shout it out loud  
When Im alive  
Shout it out loud  
When Im alive  
Shout it out loud  
When Im alive  
Shout it out loud  
When Im alive  
Shout it out loud  
When Im alive  
Shout it out loud  
When Im alive  
Shout it out loud  
When Im alive  
Shout it out loud  
  
Shout it out loud
