Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
People always saying youre crazy well it doesnt faze me  
I like crazy you know  
I love your personality but I dont think I understand it  
Youre on another planet  
Is there room for me  
And I dont know why  
You do the things you do  
But all I know is how  
I feel when Im alone with you  
  
If you wanna keep running round with your head in the clouds  
Well then thats alright with me  
You dont listen to a thing that I say  
Just live for today  
You know thats alright with me  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Thats alright with me  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Thats alright with me  
  
See I know I know I know they try to tame you  
Theyre always trying to change you  
But I dont wanna change a thing  
Everybody is telling me  
Stay away from that troublemaker I like that kinda behavior  
So come and make some trouble with me  
See I dont know why You do the things you do  
But all I know is how I feel when Im alone with you  
  
If you wanna come running round with your head in the clouds  
Well then thats alright with me  
You dont listen to a thing that I say  
Just live for today  
You know thats alright with me  
It feels like starring at the stars to see the world from where you are  
Take my hand and take my heart show me how to light that spark  
Oohhhhh  
  
If you wanna keep running round with your head in the clouds  
Well then thats alright with me  
You dont listen to a thing that I say  
Just live for today  
You know thats alright with me  
Thats alright with me  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Well thats alright with me  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Thats alright with me
