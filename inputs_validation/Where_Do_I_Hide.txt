Got a criminal record I cant cross state lines  
First on the bad list and youre last on mine  
Lookin for a scapegoat long past due  
Walking down the aisle still straining you  
  
Still hear you screaming where do I hide  
All he asks I said hurry inside  
  
He said she said no she dont  
Be back before morning you know she wont  
I remember that summer like yesterday  
And I remember his mother as he was dragged away  
  
I still hear him screaming  
Where do I hide  
All he asks I say hurry inside  
A whole lot of memory  
Yours and not mine  
All he asks I said hurry inside  
  
Got a criminal record I cant cross state lines  
First on the bad list and youre last on mine  
Lookin for a scapegoat long past due  
Walking down the aisle still straining you  
  
Still hear you screaming  
Where do I hide  
All he asks I say hurry inside  
A whole lot of memory  
Yours and not mine  
All he asks I said hurry inside  
Where do I hide
