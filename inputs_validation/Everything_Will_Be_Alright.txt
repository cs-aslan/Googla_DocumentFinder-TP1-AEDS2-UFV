I believe in you and me  
Im coming to find you  
If it takes me all night  
Wrong until you make it right  
And I wont forget you  
At least Ill try  
And run and run tonight  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright  
  
I wasnt shopping for a doll  
To say the least I thought Ive seen them all  
But then you took me by surprise  
Im dreaming bout those dreamy eyes  
I never knew I never knew  
So take your suitcase cause I dont mind  
And baby doll I meant it every time  
You dont need to compromise  
Im dreaming bout those dreamy eyes  
I never knew I never knew  
But its alright  
  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright
