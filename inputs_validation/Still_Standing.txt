ZRo talking  
Yes indeed HTown it go down Lil Flex ZRo Big Mello  
Know what Im saying you boys cant stop us man  
Unstoppable feel me yeah  
They got to feel us till they kill us this for the radio  
  
Lil Flex  
Aint nothing but a g thang baby  
Turnel sets dried yellow bones crazy  
Cant fade me died lately  
Pulling out the escallade or a mercedes  
Trunk popper show stopper drank sipper  
Rule number one is to never tip a stripper  
And I know a lot of whyall want to wish me trouble  
Went from swanging hoodoos to a bentley bubble  
Image is everything diamonds in every ring  
Piece and chains that hang down low to my dangalang  
Stop that cop that Im a baller baby  
Got the rims that poke out on the prowler baby  
Im the same young cat that dropped the jewels on them  
Next year Im about to drop 22s on them  
From the Mo to the Fo back to airport landing  
Diamonds speak for theyself Flex so outstanding  
  
Chorus  
Still standing and you know we represent the south  
And ya know ya know we represent the south  
Still standing we in the door and these haters cant keep us out  
  
Big Mello  
I represent that SOyouTH to the SIDE  
Drop screens you can see me completely  
Off the heezy fa sheezy Im breezy  
Cause my diamonds they be known to blind hoes like Stevie  
Believe me outstanding with my family  
From me and ZRo and Lil Flex at the grammy  
Boss player from Texas you could tell by the necklace  
We gone break these hoes on fours now we frozen the Lexus  
My protected move around get around  
Come through show some round when we hit your town  
It go down whoa now school slow down  
Watch these fours roll down crawl down your block  
Top drop trunk knock glock cocked  
And these shops gone bop it dont stop  
Wont stop how it go down  
Harm clock Mo City south west still shine wooo  
  
Chorus  
ZRo  
Screwed up representer these fellas dont want none  
From the land of the trunk poppers where ballers blow tons  
We stacking funds and living our life out on the run  
In search of a platinum plack trying to get stacks it just begun  
If you talking down move around we aint having that  
East and West took it before but see we came to grab it back  
Cant see us like cataracts off in our natural habitat  
Thats the studio and bro you know aint no more selling crack  
Aint nothing but rocking trash talking on down to the aint that  
Cause Im a veteran to this here ever since the days of the Wave Band  
When I was knee high to a grass hopper but now we roll on chppers  
Me and Gene hovering over the ground in candy helicopters  
Now we platinum status without driving a dodge stratus  
Keeping it gangsta energy instinct with a heater to protect us  
Man its third coast to me our music mean the most  
Big Mello and Lil Flex and ZRo the crooked as your folks and we  
  
Chorus  2x
