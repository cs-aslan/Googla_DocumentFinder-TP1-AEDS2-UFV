Change change its all rearrangin  
Lookin around at the situation  
Go back see what youre doin  
The way youre takin life youre goin  
To rack and ruin  
Im turning circles so stay away  
Weve all got somethin wrong to say  
Slow down see where were headin  
The way things are goin now  
Your life it aint pleasin  
Had my share of up and down  
Dont spend time dont spend time  
Rushin around  
Im turning circles so stay away  
Weve all got somethin wrong to say  
Uhuh uhuh  
Uhuh uhuh  
Im turning circles so stay away  
Weve all got somethin wrong to say  
Uhuh uhuh turning circles  
Uhuh uhuh stay away
