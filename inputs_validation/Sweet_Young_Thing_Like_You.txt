Sweet sweet young thing  
Like you like you baby  
Youve gone and made me  
Lose my cool  
  
Sweet sweet young thing  
Like you like you baby  
Youre all I need  
To see me through  
  
I said Id never love again  
Ive always been on the losing end  
  
When you touched my hand  
I knew right there and then  
I loved you I loved you baby  
I love you  
  
Sweet sweet young thing  
Like you like you baby  
Youve gone and made me  
Lose my cool  
  
Sweet sweet young thing  
Like you like you baby  
Yeah babe youre all I need  
To see me through  
  
My whole life was upside down  
Misery and heartbreak  
Followed me around  
  
Things that used to make me sad  
Have got a brand new sound  
I love you I love you baby  
I love you  
  
Sweet sweet young thing  
Like you like you baby  
Youve gone and made me  
Lose my cool  
  
Sweet sweet young thing  
Like you like you baby  
Youre all I need  
To see me through
