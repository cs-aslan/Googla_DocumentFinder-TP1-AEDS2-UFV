Original by Jefferson Airplane  
  
One pill makes you larger  
And one pill makes you small  
And the ones that mother gives you  
Dont do anything at all  
Go ask Alice  
When shes ten feet tall  
  
And if you go chasing rabbits  
And you know youre going to fall  
Tell em a hookah smoking caterpillar  
Has given you the call  
Call Alice  
When she was just small  
  
When the men on the chessboard  
Get up and tell you where to go  
And youve just had some kind of mushroom  
And your mind is moving low  
Go ask Alice  
I think shell know  
  
When logic and proportion  
Have fallen sloppy dead  
And the White Knight is talking backwards  
And the Red Queens off with her head  
Remember what the Dormouse said  
Feed your head  
Feed your head  
Feed your head
