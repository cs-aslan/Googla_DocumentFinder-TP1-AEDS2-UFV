Dont tell me you dont know what love is  
When youre old enough to know better  
When you find strange hands in your sweater  
When your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote  
Im a man with a mission on two or three editions  
  
And Im giving you a longing look  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday I write the book  
Chapter One We didnt really get along  
Chapter Two I think I fell in love with you  
You said youd stand by me in the middle of Chapter Three  
  
But you were up to your old tricks in Chapters Four  
Five and Six  
And Im giving you a longing look  
The way you walk  
The way you talk and try to kiss me  
And laugh in four or five paragraphs  
All your compliments and your cutting remarks  
Are captured here in my quotation marks  
  
And Im giving you a longing look  
Everyday I write the book  
Dont tell me you dont know the difference  
Between a lover and a fighter  
With my pen and my electric typewriter  
Even in a perfect world where everyone was equal  
Id still own the film rights and be working on the sequel  
  
And Im giving you a longing look  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday I write the book  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday I write the book
