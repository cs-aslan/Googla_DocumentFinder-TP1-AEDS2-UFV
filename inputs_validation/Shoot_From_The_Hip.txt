All my life Ive taken what I want  
Give an inch take a mile  
Always on the hunt  
Ooh  sex money fast cars never get my fill  
I ride hard and die free  
Paying for my thrills  
Fire water moonshine going to my head  
He and my pistols loaded  
Go out and knockem dead  
  
REFRAIN  
Im gonna shoot it bangboom  
Shoot it from the hip  
Got it loaded bang pull the trigger boom  
I dont never miss  
Im gonna shoot it bangboom  
Shoot it from the hip  
Got it loaded bang pull the trigger boom  
I dont never miss  
  
Hot sweaty steel a womans fingers on my gun  
Pull it hard touch the trigger  
Squeeze it when Im gone  
Ooh come woman touch me put it in your hand  
Take a hold heart and soul  
Honey Im your man  
Cock the hammer slowly and aim it at your love  
Put my barrel in your holster  
Like a velvet glove  
  
REFRAIN  
  
Hot and sticky here it comes  
Emotion you cant tame  
Kind a tricky watch it run  
Smoking like a flame flame flame  
  
Hot and sticky here it comes  
I got the bullet load it up  
Slide it into place  
My emotions  
Coming down all across your face  
  
REFRAIN
