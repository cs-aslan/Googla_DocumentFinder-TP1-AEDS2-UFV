The winters chill chilled me to the bone this year  
And something in my mind just got away  
Being in the places where we used to be  
Somehow being there without yous not the same  
  
Parking lots office parks and shopping malls  
And all you left were bills you hadnt paid  
The winters chill chilled me to the bone this year  
And something in my mind just got away  
  
Its all behind you now  
Youre moving on  
Theyll never find you now  
Youre moving on on on  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah naa  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah naa  
  
Alcohol cigarettes and luxury goods  
Christmas lights look desperate in this room  
Winters light left me in the dark last night  
And Jingle Bells are smothered in this gloom  
  
Winters trees freezing in the bitter wind  
And autumns leaves have all been blown away  
Being in the places where we used to be  
Somehow being there without yous not the same  
  
Its all behind you now  
Youre moving on  
Theyll never find you now  
Youre moving on on on  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah naa  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah naa  
  
Its all behind you now  
Youre moving on  
Theyll never find you now  
Youre moving on on on  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah naa  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah naa
