But The Problem Is This Time Its Mine  
  
So many times Ive seen  
So many peoples dreams  
Lost and washed away  
Out to the sea yeah  
  
I said No not I  
Pain would surely pass me by  
Happening to them but not to me yeah  
  
Hearts get broken all the time oohhh  
Never used to worry about things like this  
I wouldnt worry  
But the trouble is This time its mine  
Now Im worrying This one is mine  
See the problem is the heart is mine  
  
Love would be all Id need  
How naive could I be  
Trusting other people with my care yeah  
  
Never thought Id have to be  
One of loves casualties  
Up until now my belief was that love was fair  
  
Hearts get broken all the time oooh  
But I never worried bout things like this  
I didnt worry  
But the trouble is This time its mine  
I keep worrying This one is mine  
See the problem is the heart is mine  
  
This time my hearts breaking  
This time my loves failing  
Im trying hard not to be bitter now  
  
I never dreamed that the broken heart would be mine  
  
Hearts get broken all the time  
You think its love but it never really is  
Never could imagine a thing like that I wouldnt worry  
But the trouble is This time its mine  
Got me worrying This one is mine  
See the problem is the heart is mine  
This is mine this is mine yeah  
  
Hearts get broken all the time  
Never cared a doggone thing about that I didnt worry  
But the trouble is This time its mine  
And the problem really is This one is mine  
See the whole thing is the heart is mine  
  
This time its mine  
This one is mine  
The heart is mine  
  
This time its mine  
This one is mine  
The heart is mine  
  
This time its mine  
This one is mine  
The heart is mine
