New York City was a stitch in time  
When I stood all I could of LA  
Patchin up the pieces of my tangled mind  
Diggin somethin different every day yeah  
Soon as I was better I was movin on  
Gettin it together gettin good and gone  
And by gettin by high good and high and strange  
Gonna get some strange  
New aint nothin but a state of mind  
Keeps a man from missin what he left behind  
Ill take anything that I can find  
Anyhow anywhere anyway anytime  
Ill keep livin till the day I die as long as I can  
Get it up for one more try  
Gettin by gettin by high good and high and strange  
Gonna get some strange  
New aint nothin but a state of mind  
Gettin by good and high and strange  
Gonna get some strange
