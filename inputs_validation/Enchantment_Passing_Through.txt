A few more days well be home in glory  
Already theyll be getting out the flags  
With Memphis high in mode adulatory  
Still I only see a lot of snags  
  
For just because I triumphed as a slaver  
Brought booty back to Egypt by the ton  
Of this and every month now Im the flavor ooh yeah  
And scheduled to do things Ive never done  
  
And why should I tell you this a stranger I just met  
A woman who in hours from now Ill certainly forget  
  
Anonymous and undemanding  
Enchantment passing through  
My secrets and my confidence are safe enough with you  
  
My days out on the field are all but ended  
Theyll put me out to grass which means the throne  
Bedecked with jewels alongside my intended  
I feel as if my heart is set in stone  
  
For just because I triumphed as a slaver  
Brought booty back to Egypt by the ton oh yeah  
Of this and every month Im now the flavor  
And scheduled to do things Ive never done hey hey  
  
And why should I tell you this a stranger I just met  
A woman who in hours from now Ill certainly forget  
  
Anonymous and undemanding  
Enchantment passing through  
My secrets and my confidence is safe enough in you  
  
Why should I tell you this a stranger I just met  
Someone who in hours from now Ill certainly forget  
  
So anonymous and undemanding yeas you are  
Enchantment passing through  
My secrets and my confidence is safe enough with you  
  
And why should I tell you this a stranger I just met  
A woman who in hours from now Ill certainly forget  
  
Anonymous and undemanding  
Enchantment passing through  
My secrets and my confidence are safe enough with you  
Are safe enough with you
