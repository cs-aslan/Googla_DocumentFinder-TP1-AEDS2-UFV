I woke up this mornin  
Peaked out my door  
It was rainin cold an grey  
Its my one day off I was gonna play golf  
There goes the plans that I made  
Oh but you wont hear me complain  
  
An oh what a perfect day for lovin you  
When youre in my arms Ive got sunshine  
An the skys always blue  
Couldnt ask for better weather  
To do what I do  
Oh what a perfect day for lovin you  
  
So lets go grab a blanket  
An a hot cup of coffee  
And sit out on the front porch and swing  
That look in your eyes is whats on my mind  
We dont have to say anything  
Lets just listen to that old tin roof sing  
  
An oh what a perfect day for lovin you  
When youre in my arms Ive got sunshine  
An the skys always blue  
Couldnt ask for better weather  
To do what I do  
Oh what a perfect day for lovin you  
Oh what a perfect day for lovin you  
For lovin you
