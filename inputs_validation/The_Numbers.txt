Verse 1  
It holds us like a phantom  
The touch is like a breeze  
It shines its understanding  
See the moon smiling  
  
Open on all channels  
Ready to receive  
And were not at the mercy  
Of your shimmerers or spells  
Your shimmerers or spells  
Mmmhm  
  
We are of the earth  
To her we do return  
The future is inside us  
Its not somewhere else  
Its not somewhere else  
Its not somewhere else  
  
Chorus  
One day at a time  
One day at a time  
  
Verse 2  
We call upon the people  
People have this power  
The numbers dont decide  
Your system is a lie  
The river running dry  
The wings of a butterfly  
And you may pour us away like soup  
Like were pretty broken flowers  
Well take back what is ours  
Take back what is ours  
  
Chorus  
One day at a time
