Spinning laughing dancing to  
Her favorite song  
A little girl with nothing wrong  
Is all alone  
  
Eyes wide open  
Always hoping for the sun  
And shell sing her song to anyone  
That comes along  
  
Fragile as a leaf in autumn  
Just fallin to the ground  
Without a sound  
  
Crooked little smile on her face  
Tells a tale of grace  
Thats all her own  
  
Spinning laughing dancing to her  
Favorite song  
A little girl with nothing wrong  
And shes all alone
