Across this bloody river to the other side  
41 shots they cut through the night  
Youre kneeling over his body in the vestibule  
Praying for his life

Is it a knife  
Is it a wallet  
This is your life  
It aint no secret it aint no secret  
It aint no secret it aint no secret  
Aint no secret my friend  
You can get killed just for living in your american skin
