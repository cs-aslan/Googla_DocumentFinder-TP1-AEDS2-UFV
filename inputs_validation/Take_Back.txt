You pushed me once too far again  
Id like to break you fucking teeth  
Stick a knife in the center of your back  
You better grow some eyes in the back of your  
Head I fight dirty just like your looks  
Cant take cant take cant take anymore  
Take back take back take  
The taste of bad blood on the tip of my tongue  
An eye for an eye Gun for a gun  
Coldcocked and Im taking back whats mine  
Expect it when youre least expecting it  
No loss of love the smell of regret  
Lights out  
Cant take anymore  
Shit
