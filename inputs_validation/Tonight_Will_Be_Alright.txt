Little darling  
Where youve been so long  
Ive been out here thinking about ya  
And the feelings real strong  
Well the time has come to celebrate  
You and me girl so sounds great  
Cause tonight will be alright  
Oh baby  
  
Little darling come on  
Lets take a ride  
To a midnight honey town and set it on fire  
We dont want to be mad  
But we have to be cool  
You and me girl  
Lets break all the rules  
Cause tonight will be alright  
Oh my baby Im gonna say it again  
I can see us moving on  
Down the highway  
I can see us loving  
Till our hearts desire  
Anything you want to do girl  
You just tell me  
Cause its alright cause its alright  
  
Little darling telling you no use  
Keep me thinking about you honey  
My souls on fire  
Well if you want me girl  
And the games I play  
Anythings alright anything you say  
Cause tonight will be alright

Alright alright alright baby  
We gonna make it alright  
You and me baby alright
