When I was in grade six  
I used to hold open a door for a girl and she called me a wimp  
Said theres just no need to be so fucking polite  
I politely agreed with her I think she was right  
It just never entered my mind  
That a twelve year old came down to choosing sides  
You said Id die if I had nothing to do  
Put a drink in my hand and Ill talk to anything that moves  
I just refuse to give you what you think would make things right  
Just to find hate when youve lost the will to fight  
And would it be really in touch with the times  
To put somebody down for choosing sides  
  
And you said show us them teeth  
Give us them braces  
Show us the dental work that puts fear in twelve year old faces  
I can make you feel even half worthwhile  
But please dont ask me to smile  
  
And times when it still feels right  
Ill hold open a door for a girl or back down from a fight  
And if theres just no need to be so fucking polite  
At least it helps you sleep easier at night  
Just never entered my mind  
That ever should come down to choosing sides  
  
And you said show us them teeth  
Give us them braces  
Show us the dental work that puts fear in twelve year old faces  
I can prove to you that I do or dont get high  
But please dont ask me to smile
