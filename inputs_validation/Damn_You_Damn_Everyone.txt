Try Runnin around the candle  
I was only running into you  
Try Runnin around the candle  
I dont try to run it into you  
  
I get tired of runnin into you  
  
Damn you damn everyone  
Ill be fine without you  
Damn you damn everyone  
Ill be fine without you  
  
Im still tired of runnin into you  
  
Try one thats with you  
Tear my damn heart in two  
I wont battle At you  
Running into it Running into it
