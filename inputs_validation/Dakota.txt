I had a dream about you  
It was December in the afternoon  
Youre something pretty and cool  
Signing records as youre passing through  
  
You saw everyone as an angel  
But what about the thieves  
Who dont know what do  
And dont know who to be  
You saw everyone as an angel  
But what about the thief  
Who took away from you  
He took away from you  
  
If you just kept walking on your way  
If you just kept walking on your way  
If you just kept walking on walking on walking on your way  
  
Behind the archway lies a thief  
Awaiting double fantasy  
Hes something evil underneath  
Outside Dakota died the symphony  
  
I think everyone has a devil waiting in the wings  
When you dont know what to do  
And you dont know who to be  
You saw everyone as an angel  
But what about the thief  
Who took away from you  
Took away from you  
  
If you just kept walking on your way  
If you just kept walking on your way  
If you just kept walking on walking on walking on your way  
  
Maybe this is just a nightmare  
And I will wake up  
We all will wake up  
Maybe this is just a nightmare  
December afternoons they took away from you
