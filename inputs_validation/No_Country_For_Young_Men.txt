Many motherfuckers criticize  
Pros and how they play  
And many motherfuckers criticize  
Rappers and what they say  
Even though they criticize  
Secretly they fantasize  
But they know theyll never paid be to play  
  
Yea  
Ima kill one of you young punks  
With a old school flow  
Flow flow  
  
Though I walk through the shadow of death  
I gotta make sure that my shoes and my outfit fresh  
Yall bitches get jealous when you see me coming  
Yall would too if you seen my woman  
Yall know we bout to do what we do  
This shit here bout as sick as the flu  
Drunk motherfuckers wanna vomit on my shoe  
Niggas cant have shit prolly cause of you  
Rappers go to jail like Oprah go to Yale  
Stedman policy dont ask dont tell  
Where my waterbees as I go get the mail  
Half black is the new black cant you tell  
It was blue black like Wesley Snipes in new jack  
Now you got to have a white mama just to do that  
Tiger woods used to be a safe nigga  
Go ahead let your daughter have a date with him  
Hell mate wit em prolly in a wifebeater  
Tiger bout to change his name to cheater  
I dont like it when you call me big poppa  
From south central and I hate helicopters  
If we at school Ill break in your locker  
See me with a water bottle its probably vodka  
Drink responsibly or drink constantly  
Be who you wanna be in this economy  
Drunk as Sean Connery at the Bonavie  
Cant throw me out motherfucker Im the honery  
Trust me Ill never be the nominee  
I dont kiss enough ass Im too honery  
Ice cube be where the piranha be  
Swim upstream eatin all kind of meat  
West coast treat it like hyenas  
Take what you want from these lieing ass cheaters  
Eat the fuck out these beavers  
Thats how we act when you dont wanna feed us  
Crazy motherfucker ever since I was a fetus  
Might as well join us you aint gonna beat us  
Please believe us you can ask Jesus  
Ima be here bout as long as Regis  
Understand I never pledge of alligiance  
To this balla confusion might cause a contusion boy  
I see youre cruising for a bruising  
Fucking with a principal that dont like students  
Dont you know that detention is a lynching  
And if I fail to mention Im spending out my pension  
No no no no  
The reason I hung in  
Cause this right here aint no country for young men  
Sunny you done fucked up the churches money  
Im red fox and you that big dummy  
This junkyard was a empire  
Yall let it get over ran by vampires  
Most MCs is god damn liars  
Like them fucking supervisors working up Kaiser  
Bitch Im not a dodger Im a laker punk  
Yous a fucking clipper you can call me jack the ripper  
Cut you up by your gizzard then down by your liver  
Rooter by the tooter gut you like flipper  
Dipper yall better treat me like the skipper  
Head trigga the heir nigga  
Air honkey and air critter  
I come through and kill every litter  
Like that like that like that  
No country for young men  
No no no no  
Its like balla confusion  
No country for young men  
No no no no  
Your world is just an illusion  
No no no no  
No country for young men  
No no no no  
Its like balla confusion  
No country for young men  
Your world is just an illusion
