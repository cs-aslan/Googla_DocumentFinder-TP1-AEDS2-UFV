I dont know whats wrong with me  
Ive been foolish as a fool can be  
Baby I cant sleep at night  
And I lost my appetite  
Went to the doctor but he dont know  
Its getting to where it aint funny no more  
Tell me baby what I might gonna do  
I believe Im in love with you  
I believe Im in love with you  
Tell me baby that you love me too  
I cant fight baby I decided  
Im in love with you  
I guess this time I realize  
For you baby I got eyes  
Come on baby and give me a chance  
All I need is your romance  
You know what Im tryin to fight  
Im telling you baby Ill be true  
I believe Im in love with you  
I believe Im in love with you  
Tell me baby that you love me too  
I cant fight baby I decided  
Im in love with you
