Judds Bye Bye Baby Blues  
  
Chorus  
Ooh Im missin you  
Ive got those byebye byebye baby blues  
Ooh aint much to do  
Just sing those byebye byebye baby blues  
  
Havin the blues hatin to loose  
Guess I got a lot to learn  
All of my friends have lost now and then  
I guess its just my turn  
  
Chorus  
  
Tell me the first hurt you the worst  
And time is your best friend  
But when youre this sad and hurtin this bad  
How do you love again  
  
Chorus  
  
Byebye byebye baby blues
