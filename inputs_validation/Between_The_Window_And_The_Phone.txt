Today is a far cry from yesterday for yesterday the love was mine I need today  
Ive walked on many miles since youve been gone  
Somewhere between the window and the phone  
Somewhere between the window and the phone youll find me waiting here all
alone  
Ive thought about leaving but Id go right on grieving  
Somewhere between the window and the phone  
If the phone should ring I wonder what Id say  
Would I tell you that I love you in the same sweet way  
If you look through the window Ill be home  
Somewhere between the window and the phone  
Somewhere between the window
