ronnie lane  
I close my eyes and ignore all the signs  
Im walking round in circles  
Ive closed my ears and believed my own lies  
And break the silence always  
I make a lot of words big storm in the air  
All round your hair its blowing  
Just leave it be and it will all blow away  
The weathers always changing  
You can go if you want to  
I dont own you go be wild  
  
Leave my hand its wide open  
Sos the door evermore  
It hurts me more to think ill keep you in chains  
Than if you were to leave me  
I am what you are and Im running too  
All for the open prairie  
So you can go if you want to  
I dont own you go be wild  
Leave my hand its wide open  
Sos the door forevermore
