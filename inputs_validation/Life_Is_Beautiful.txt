Smile without a reason why  
Love as if you were a child  
Smile no matter what they tell you  
Dont listen to a word they say  
Cause life is beautiful that way  
  
Tears a tidal wave of tears  
Light that slowly disappears  
Wait before you close the curtain  
There is still another game to play  
And life is beautiful that way  
  
Here with his eyes forevermore  
I will always be as close as you  
Remember from before  
Now that youre out there on your own  
Remember what is real and  
What we dream is love alone  
  
Keep the laughter in you eyes  
Soon your long awaited prize  
Well forget about our sorrows  
And think about a brighter day  
Cause life is beautiful that way  
  
Well forget about our sorrows  
And think about a brighter day  
Cause life is beautiful that way  
Theres still another game to play  
And life is beautiful that way
