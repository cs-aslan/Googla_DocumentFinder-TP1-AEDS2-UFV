Ill drive around with the trunk tied down  
With a bungee cord  
Because I hoped a curb and backed into her  
New boyfriends Ford  
  
And down the hall  
Theres a hole in the wall thats hard to miss  
Its about the size and shape of  
my right busted fist  
  
Chorus  
Everything I own has got a dent  
Its cracked or scratched or rip or torn  
Banged up or slightly bent  
Why should my heart be any different  
Everything that I own has got a dent  
  
She used to say Im a man thats way to hard on stuff  
She let me know that that also goes for our love  
I guess her hearts like that old dead gold fish that I forgot to feed  
And mind like that dirt bike that I wrapped around that tree  
  
Chorus  
  
Inside hole in the back  
Big piece of junk ready for the trash  
Better days gone  
Heart just keeps on beating anyways  
  
Chorus  
  
Cant find one thing that dont  
Everything that I own has got a dent  
Big old dent
