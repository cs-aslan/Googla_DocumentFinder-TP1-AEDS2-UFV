I got home about three am  
Working my fingers to the bone  
My womans waiting up for me  
Gonna put me through the third degree  
where you been who you seen   
Is all she wants to know  
I cant lie to save my life  
cause I got nothin to hide  
Let me tell you whats been on my mind  
You been in the city again  
I aint lyin baby I saw you on your high horse  
Walkin along like you didnt belong  
To any selfrespecting man  
Is that the way youre gonna repay  
All the love that Ive given to you  
Its a windup windup  
Wind up accusin me repeat  
Wind me up  
Maybe we should start all over again   
Thats the best advice  
Meet me halfway and Ill be there   
I been there so long and now Im coming home for rest  
Im ok how about you  
Everything I said baby was true  
We only got ourselves to blame   
Makin our bed is just a part of the game  
Its a windup windup  
Wind up accusin me  
Baby its a windup windup  
Windup for you and me repeat  
You want me you want me to be  
You gotta stop what you do  
Windup windup  
I dont need no more of your lies  
Windup windup  
I gotta stop now  
Windup windup
