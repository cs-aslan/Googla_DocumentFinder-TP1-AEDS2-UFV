So you take your chances  
Look through dirty lenses  
Unintended consequences  
We dont need your ugly fences  
Well make our own way out of here  
  
Start a car  
Get away  
Theres so much you could see today  
  
If we dont escape  
Well turn into  
Everything we hate  
But tell me do  
We even have a chance  
  
If we dont escape  
The things we do  
Wont make a difference  
Its just me and you  
And all our best laid plans  
  
So weve run right off the map  
Get away from all the traps  
Inevitable consequences  
Living only present tenses  
Only living for the now  
  
Start a car  
Get away  
Theres so much you could see today  
  
If we dont escape  
Well turn into  
Everything we hate  
But tell me do  
We even have a chance  
  
If we dont escape  
The things we do  
Wont make a difference  
Its just me and you  
And all our best laid plans  
  
If we dont escape  
Well turn into  
Everything we hate  
But tell me do  
We even have a chance  
  
If we dont escape  
The things we do  
Wont make a difference  
Its just me and you  
And all our best laid plans
