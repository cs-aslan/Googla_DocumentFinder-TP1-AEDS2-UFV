My hearts your heart  
My love your love  
And I am not okay  
Unless youre okay  
  
Ive seen what youre facing  
Please dont be alarmed  
If you need me just call me  
Youre never alone  
Hey Im barely sleepin  
Im barely eating  
Until the rain turns into change  
  
My hearts your heart  
My love your love  
And I am not okay  
Unless youre okay  
And my mind is your mind  
An my soul is your soul  
And I am not okay  
Unless youre okay  
Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh oh yeah  
Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh oh yeah  
  
Im headed wherever youre going  
And I mean that from my heart  
In the end youll see that Ive been there from the start  
Im not walking away  
Not talkin just to say  
Your pains my pain  
And uh your gains my gain  
  
I wanna be right here  
To make sure your tears dont form a river  
Im gonna be right here  
Until youre vision becomes clearer  
I aint sleepin  
Im not eatin  
Until the rain turns into change  
  
My hearts your heart  
My love your love  
And I am not okay  
Unless youre okay  
And my mind is your mind  
An my soul is your soul  
And I am not okay  
Unless youre okay  
Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh oh yeah  
Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh oh yeah
