American beauty  
Came up and spoke  
She touched her toes  
And we shared a joke  
Taxis limos  
Power boat glides  
Jet skies mensa  
Babes without a ride  
  
You know the revolutions gone now  
Theres no revolution song  
Somewhere down the line  
You know on one of Gods good days  
Can you hear me  
Someones gonna have to pay  
  
Moonshot rockets  
Nineteen sixties cool  
Sonny Boy Williamson  
Pope John Paul  
The Congo to Vietnam  
The Beatles to the Stones  
Is nobody left  
Whos gonna shake those bones  
  
You know the revolutions gone now  
Theres no revolution song  
Somewhere down the line  
You know on one of Gods good days  
Can you hear me  
Someones gonna have to pay  
Pay all the time  
  
Solo  
  
All of the misfits  
All of the scars  
All of lifes promises  
Bottled in jars  
Theres a hum and a howl  
Lovers on the run  
Tell me whats on offer  
From the government scum  
  
Solo  
  
Rats will get richer  
And the dirt beg for more  
Crumbs on the table  
For the world of the poor  
News of self worship  
Fresh from Hollywood  
The pygmies of poison  
Dont know bad from good  
  
You know the revolutions gone now  
Theres no revolution song  
Somewhere down the line  
You know on one of Gods good days  
Can you hear me  
Someones gonna have to pay  
Oh thats pay all the time  
Someones got to pay  
you aint walkin  
You aint talkin  
You got to pay  
while Im looking over your shoulder  
You got to pay
