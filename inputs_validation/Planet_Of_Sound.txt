One fine day in my odd past  
I picked me up a transmission  
I turned the fission ignition  
Went looking for the broadcaster  
And when I first touched some ground  
They simply told me to leave  
Was kind of hard to believe  
Cause there was not one around  
This aint the planet sound  
This aint the planet sound  
This aint the planet sound  
This aint the planet sound  
I had a talented wine  
That land of classical gas  
And on the planet of glass  
They sent me skipping through time  
I got to somewhere renowned  
For its canals and color of red  
And lots of guys who shook their heads  
Rhythmically to resound  
This aint the planet of sound  
This aint the planet of sound  
This aint the planet of sound  
This aint the planet of sound  
This aint no rock and roll town  
This aint no fuckin around  
This aint no planet of sound  
I met a guy in a rover  
He said its one more over  
Its just there where your bound  
This aint the planet of sound  
This aint the planet of sound  
This aint the planet of sound  
This aint the planet of sound  
This aint the planet of sound
