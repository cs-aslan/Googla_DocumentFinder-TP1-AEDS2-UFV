He says he doesnt care  
To the girl with the painted hair  
And staggers through the angry crowd  
Like it isnt there  
Feels like a wall of sound  
As he crashes down  
Noone stops to look  
When he hits the ground  
  
Were the nouveaux rich  
On a one way tip  
Living out on a razors edge  
Just to get our kicks  
Were gonna take a stand  
Til the world is in our hands  
And if we win or lose  
We dont give a damn  
  
Hollow people living empty lives  
Looking vacant in the neon lights  
Who need the truth when you can live a lie  
Cant stop now its too late  
  
Cause were running blind  
Til the end comes like a thunder  
Yeah and we all fall under  
Noone gives a damn  
Come on now lets meet the end  
  
He tries to make it home  
Head like a block of stone  
His eyes so closed up now  
His arm so full of dope  
  
Theres nowhere left to run  
He cries out but no one comes  
In the back of some dark alley  
He dies alone  
  
Hollow people living empty lives  
Hearts feel nothing in the neon lights  
Feelings here are so cheap these days  
  
Noone really cares  
If we lose of if we win  
Yeah were the angry youth  
Yeah dont want to be like you  
  
Yeah we do what we want  
Til we want to die  
Yeah were the nouveaux rich  
Yeah we gotcha in our grip  
Theres no escape for you  
  
Cause were running blind  
Were so angry  
Were just so angry  
Angry  
Were all so angry  
In the end
