You dont understand  
This is a demand  
And I think that I have to show you  
Try to look inside  
Take me for a ride  
In the day and the night  
Get to know you  
  
Boys meet boys get together  
Boys meet boys live forever  
Dont say no  
Boys say go  
  
I can run away  
If you never stay  
And the rain and the pain and the sorrow  
Im not very sure  
When you close the door  
If the end is the same as tomorrow  
  
Boys  
Boys  
Boys say go
