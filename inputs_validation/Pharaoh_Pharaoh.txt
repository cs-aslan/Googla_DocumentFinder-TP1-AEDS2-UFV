CHORUS Pharaoh Pharaoh whoa baby let my people go 2x  
  
A burnin bush told me just the other day  
That I should go to Egypt and say  
Its time to let my people be free   
Listen to God if you wont listen to me  
  
CHORUS  
  
Well me and and my people goin to the Red Sea  
With Pharaohs best army comin after me  
I took my staff stuck it in the sand  
And all of Gods people walked on dry land  
Singin  
  
CHORUS  
  
Now Pharaohs army was acomin too  
So whattaya think that God did do  
Had me take my staff and clear my throat  
And all of Pharaohs army did the dead mans float  
  
CHORUS  
  
Well thats the story of the stubborn goat  
Pharaoh shouldve know that chariots dont float  
The lesson is simple its easy to find  
When God says GO you had better mind
