Its the way that you kiss me  
Its the way that you dont  
Its the way that youll miss me  
When you swear that you wont  
  
Theres a feeling you give me  
When we talk on the phone  
God I hope you outlive me  
So Im never alone  
  
Whatever you do I will be there for you  
Through the thunder the wind and the rain  
And whatever you do I will promise to you  
I will be there Ill be there for you  
  
I may lack social graces  
But I wont swallow my pride  
There are millions of places places  
I could be but Im here by your side  
  
And whatever you do I will be there for you  
Through the thunder the wind and the rain  
Be there for you  
And whatever you do I will promise to you  
I will be there  
Be there  
Ill be there for you  
  
Though theres nothing to guide us  
We will weather the storm  
Till the heavens divide us  
I will keep you from harm  
  
Whatever you do I will be there for you  
Through the thunder the wind and the rain  
Be there for you  
And whatever you do I will promise to you  
I will be there  
Be there  
Ill be there  
  
Whatever you do I will be there for you  
Through the thunder the wind and the rain  
Be there for you  
I will always be true this I promise to you  
I will be there  
Be there  
Ill be there for you
