In modern music some clever guy has started a brand new craze  
A fellow must put Do De O Do into all he sings or plays  
Now some may think this foolish but Im not one of those  
For I attach importance to those Do De O Do Do De O Dos  
Now you cant be rich youre poor instead  
Without the Do De O Do De O Do  
You cant make cakes and you cant make bread  
Without the Do De O Do De O Do  
You need it in your music as any child will know  
The Re Me Fah So Las alright but what about the Do De O Do  
Now we take these champion boxers theres a lot that we all know  
Who fall on the ground in the second round to get the Do De O De O De O Do  
To get the Do De O De O De O Do  
Now you cant be rich youre poor instead  
Without the Do De O Do De O Do  
You cant make cakes and you cant make bread  
Without the Do De O Do De O Do  
You even need it in your music as any little child will know  
The Re Me Fah So Las alright but what about the Do De O Do  
Now suppose your keeping rabbits youve a buck well may be so  
How can he raise a family without the Do De O De O De O Do  
Without the Do De O De O De O Do
