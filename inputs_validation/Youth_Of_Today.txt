The kids will make it happen  
Were starting a new way  
People  
In the world today  
Physically strong  
Morally straight  
Positive youth  
Were the youth of today  
Never fight each other  
Use our heads before our fists  
Then well kick down all the barriers  
Of hate and prejudice  
Live fast die young was just a fad  
For a bunch of losers  
Who didnt take care  
Im gonna live my life  
Breath every breath  
Look towards the future  
And move straight ahead
