Yes sometimes it seems that I dont care  
Dont worry bout it baby dont you never never never fear  
Thats a mans way oh thats a mans way  
Thats a mans way  
Of lovin you yes it is yes it is child  
  
One more thing I know I buy you so many fancy things  
When you already have so much you just can hardly find room enough  
But thats a mans way oh thats a mans way  
Thats a mans way  
Of lovin you yes it is yes it is child  
  
If I had to leave you and go away you know what  
Id write you a letter each and every day  
One more thing I know you get so tired of me callin you on the phone  
But thats a mans way of sayin you just dont wanna be all alone  
  
If you give me a million things to do you know what  
Id do them all baby just to get back home to you  
Thats a mans way oh thats a mans way  
Thats a mans way  
Of lovin you yeah  
Thats a mans way  
  
Yes it is  
Thats a mans way  
A real mans way  
Thats a mans way
