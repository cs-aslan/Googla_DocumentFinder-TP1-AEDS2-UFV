Hey honey wont you sit down  
And stop here for a spell  
Singin the sweet old lullabies  
To forget about your health  
Dont think about tomorrow  
Its a whole nights sleep away  
Sure would be pleased to have you stay  
And its reach out old Virginia  
Wont you rock him close to you  
The poor boys had a hotel so long  
He dont know what to do  
Its time to come on home  
And put your feet up for a while  
So much travlin round tends to take away your smile  
Pears to me its all a body can do to stay in tune  
And youve been strainin at those strings  
From mornin till noon  
So come on down and hang around  
Itll put you right real soon  
Cause nothings changed  
Its all the same  
Reach out old Virginia  
Wont you rock him close to you  
The poor boys had a hotel so long  
He dont know what to do  
Its time to come on home  
And put your feet up for a while  
So much travlin round can take away your smile  
Reach out old Virginia  
Wont you rock him close to you  
The poor boys had a hotel so long  
He dont know what to do  
Its time to come on home  
And put your feet up for a while  
So much travlin round can take away your smile
