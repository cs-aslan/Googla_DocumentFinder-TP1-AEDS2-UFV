Never had a point of view  
Cause my mind was always someone elses mind  
  
I never had to tell a lie  
Cause I left the choices up to them  
Dont know why but I did  
  
Oh I want life  
Life wants me  
To breath in its love  
  
Take me Im yours  
Now Im comin up for air  
Im gonna live my time  
For the rest of my life  
Then Ill be comin back for more  
  
I never had to call the tune  
Cause I always drifted with the tide of the moon  
Ah la luna my love my love my love  
  
I would go out every night  
Looking for someone to treat me right  
Not a chance chance not a hope hope  
In this world world  
  
Oh I want life  
Life wants me  
To breath in its love  
  
Take me Im yours  
Now Im comin up for air  
Im gonna live my time  
For the rest of my life  
Then Ill be comin back for more  
  
Take me Im yours  
Now Im comin up for air  
Im gonna live my time  
For the rest of my life  
Then Ill be comin back for more  
  
More  
  
Take me Im yours  
Now Im comin up for air  
Im gonna live my time  
For the rest of my life  
Then Ill be coming back for more more  
oh yeah More
