Somebodys got to help me  
This girls drivin me insane  
Cause some they likes it hot  
And some they likes it cold  
And some they just dont like it at like it at all now  
  
Chorus  
Somebodys got to help me  
This girls drivin me insane  
Now somebody shes got to help me  
It makes me feel like that Im nowhere at all  
It makes me feel like Im nowhere at all  
  
Somebodys got to help me  
This girls got me on the line now  
Cause some they likes it hot  
And some they likes it cold  
And some they just dont like it at like it at all now  
  
Chorus

Give it to me now

No honey Rocky dont know it at all  
Im no no nowhere at all
