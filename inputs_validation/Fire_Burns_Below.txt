Stand and face each other  
Dont know what to say  
But that look in your eyes  
Give it all away  
You say youve got these feelings  
You cant put into words  
But you dont have to say a thing  
Cause Ive already heard  
Give me one good reason  
Why this has to be  
Thats all Im asking for  
Dont say that its over  
When you and I both know  
You cant put out this love  
The fire burns below  
Weve been through so much together  
Weve laughed and weve sometimes cried  
To say our love aint working well we  
Havent really tried  
But why lets talk things over  
Love cant be bought and sold  
One more night togethers what the future holds  
What the future holds  
Well give me one good reason  
Why this has to be  
I said thats all Im asking for  
Cant you see I said  
You cant put out the fire down below
