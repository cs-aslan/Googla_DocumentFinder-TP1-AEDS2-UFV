The night  
She brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek  
Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow  
Clouds soothe Shredded by the calico  
Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now  
  
This time like every other time I believe that I never find  
Another sweet little girl with sequined sea foam eyes  
Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky  
And Im all alone again tonight not again not again not again  
  
And dont it feel alright and dont it feel so nice Lovely  
  
Still Im unable to inhale all the riches  
As Im awkward as a wound on my bones  
Still Ive got cobblestone joints and plate glass points  
As Im all by myself tonight not again not again  
  
And dont it feel alright and dont it feel so nice Lovely  
  
Well if you should nervously break down  
When its time for the shakedown would you take it  
Its when you cry just a little but you laugh in the middle that youve made
it  
And dont it feel alright and dont it feel so nice  
Lovely  
  
Say it again Lovely So lovely to do it again  
Again Loving again Its coming again  
Lovely
