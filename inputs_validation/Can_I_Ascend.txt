Can I ascend the hill of the Lord  
Can I stand in that holy place  
There to approach the glory of my God  
Come towards to seek your face  
Purify my heart  
Purify my hands  
For I know it is on holy ground Ill stand  
Im coming up the mountain Lord  
Im seeking you and you alone  
I know that I will be transformed  
My heart unveiled before you  
Im longing for your presence Lord  
Envelop me within the clouds  
Im coming up the mountain Lord  
My heart unveiled before you  
I will come  
Can I ascend the hill of the Lord
