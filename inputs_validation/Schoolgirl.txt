Everyone said that youd always  
Been left but you got there  
Here we are now when  
The rest of the show are not there  
Nobody knows by the look of  
Your clothes youre a schoolgirl  
Who wouldve guessed  
By the way that youre dressed  
Youre a schoolgirl  
You said on my lap that  
I wasnt the right kind of person  
What I wanna know is that  
Who in the show I am worse than  
Who wouldve guessed  
By the way that youre dressed  
Youre a schoolgirl  
Nobody knows by the look of  
Your clothes youre a schoolgirl  
Oh schoolgirl  
Looking for something  
That you cant have   
You said on my lap that  
I wasnt the right kind of person  
What I wanna know is that  
Who in the show I am worse than  
But who wouldve guessed  
By the way that youre dressed  
Youre a schoolgirl  
And nobody knows by the look of  
Your clothes youre a schoolgirl  
Oh schoolgirl  
Looking for something  
That you cant have   
Listen  
Everyone said that youd always  
Been left but you got there  
Here we are now when  
The rest of the show are not there  
Nobody knows by the look of  
Your clothes youre a schoolgirl  
Who wouldve guessed  
By the way that youre dressed  
Youre a schoolgirl  
Oh schoolgirl
