Once you told me you were gonna love me  
That it was meant to be and theres no other way  
Then came someone showed you more fun  
Weve had a good run better think it over  
  
Do the right thing baby do the right thing  
Go with your heart and do the right thing  
  
Hes got a good line shows you a good time  
Did he change your mind guess its your move  
Ill lose my pride Id even step aside  
Honey you really must decide whos best for you  
  
Do the right thing baby do the right thing  
Go with your heart and do the right thing  
Do the right thing baby do the right thing  
Go with your heart and do the right thing  
  
You might chose me or chose to lose me  
Someday youll see the good thing you had  
  
Do the right thing baby do the right thing  
Go with your heart and do the right thing  
Do the right thing baby do the right thing  
Go with your heart and do the right thing  
Go with your heart and do the right thing
