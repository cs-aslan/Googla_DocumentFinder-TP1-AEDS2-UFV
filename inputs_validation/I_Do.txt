Tell me can you feel my heart beat  
Tell me as i kneel down at your feet  
I knew there would come a time  
When these two hearts would  
entwined just put your hand in mine  
Forever  
  
For so long I have been an island  
When noone could ever  
Reach the shores  
And weve got a whole lifetime to share  
And Ill always be there darling this i swear  
  
Chorus  
So please believe me  
For these words I say are true  
And dont deny me  
A lifetime loving you  
And if you ask will I be true  
Do I give my all to you  
Then I will say I do  
  
Im ready to begin this journey  
Well Im with you with every step you take  
And weve got a whole lifetime to share  
And Ill always be there  
Darling this i swear  
  
Chorus  
  
Come on just take my hand oh come on  
Lets make a stand for our love  
But I know this is so hard to believe  
So please  
  
Chorus
