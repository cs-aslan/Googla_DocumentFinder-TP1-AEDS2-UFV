First Man I think I think I am therefore I am I think  
Establishment Of course you are my bright little star  
Ive miles  
And miles  
Of files  
Pretty files of your forefathers fruit  
And now to suit our  
Great computer  
Youre magnetic ink  
  
First Man Im more than that I know I am at least I think I must be  
Inner Man There you go man keep as cool as you can  
Face piles  
And piles  
Of trials  
With smiles  
It riles them to believe  
That you perceive  
The web they weave  
And keep on thinking free
