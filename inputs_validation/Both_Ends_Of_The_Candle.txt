Ive been trying so hard to forget you  
But this chore of forgetting I find  
Has me burning both ends of the candle  
And fighting a battle with time  
  
What Id give just to sleep for a moment  
But its a luxury that I cant afford  
For I know that I just dream about you  
And my tears would start falling once more  
  
So Im burning both ends of the candle  
I just hope that it lasts through the night  
For each moment the candle is burning  
Brings closer the ending of life  
  
So Im burning both ends of the candle  
I just hope that it lasts through the night  
For each moment the candle is burning  
It brings closer the ending of life
