Reality reality reality is always  
You tattooed yourself what a piece of art  
Youve already broken your mothers heart  
When I was your age working my ass off  
Your generations soft  
  
Reality is always such a drag  
For barely blooming eighteens  
The barely blooming eighteen  
Wants to know  
  
Whats keeping her from searching  
You cannot pierce that and  
Youre dressed too tight  
  
Got a lot to learn about wrong and right  
So dye you hair dads gonna wash it out  
Come on wash out your mouth  
  
Reality is always such a drag  
For barely blooming eighteens  
The barely blooming eighteen  
Wants to know  
  
Whats hiding in the shadow  
Reality reality reality is always  
Reality is always
