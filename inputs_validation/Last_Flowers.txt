Appliances have gone berserk  
I cannot keep up  
Treading on peoples toes  
Snotnosed little punk  
  
And I cant face the evening straight  
And you cant offer me escape  
Houses move and houses speak  
If you take me there youll get relief  
Believe believe believe believe  
  
And if Im gonna talk  
I just wanna talk  
Please dont interrupt  
Just sit back and listen  
  
Cause I cant face the evening straight  
And you cant offer me escape  
Houses move and houses speak  
If you take me there youll get relief  
Believe believe believe believe  
  
Its too much  
Too bright  
Too powerful  
  
Too much  
Too bright  
Too powerful  
  
Too much  
Too bright  
Too powerful  
  
Too much
