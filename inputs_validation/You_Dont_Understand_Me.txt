Ive been up all night youve been puttin up a fight  
Seems like nothin I say gets through  
How did this old bed fit a world between me and you  
We said Goodnight but the silence was so thick  
You could cut it with a knife  
Weve hit the wall again and theres nothin I can do  
Youre the one yea Ive put all my trust in your hands  
Cmon and look in my eyes here I am here I am  
  
You dont understand me my baby  
You dont seem to know that I need you so much  
You dont understand me my feelings  
The reason Im breathin my love  
  
The mornin comes and youre reaching out for me  
Just like everythings the same  
And I let myself believe things are gonna change  
When you kiss my mouth and you hold my body close  
Do you wonder whos inside  
Maybe theres no way we could feel each others pain  
Tell me why it gets harder to know where I stand  
I guess loneliness found a new friend here I am  
  
You dont understand me  
  
You dont seem to get me my baby  
You dont really see that I live for your touch  
You dont understand me my dreams or the things I believe in my love  
You dont understand me You dont understand me Understand me
