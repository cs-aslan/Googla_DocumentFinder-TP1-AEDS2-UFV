Only See  
  
You and you alone  
You and you alone have the power to be the master of your life  
  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
  
You alone  
  
Granted youre taking me for a sucker  
When I am not  
Gradually well patch up mends and Ill make you see  
What Ive got  
Apparently youre taking me for a slip on  
Youve gotta tie me up  
Eventually you will tamper mends Ill make you see  
I am enough  
  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
  
Obviously youre taking me for what suits you  
When I dont  
With slow ease Ill show you disgraced you were on my knees  
You know I won  
Foolishly youre taking me for a sleeper  
When Im quite away  
Evidently weve not through been me your intense scene  
And youll now break  
  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
  
You and you alone  
You and you alone
