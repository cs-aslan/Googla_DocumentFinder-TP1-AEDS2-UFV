Dying on my feet  
Sure beats living on my knees  
These hands around my neck  
They get tighter as you squeeze  
Id crawl across the water baby  
Just to get away from you  
Take my life but make it shorter  
Seems the least that you could do  
  
Reach out  
Someone reach out to me  
Cause Ive lost my way  
Sometimes we  
Give into things when we lie and cheat  
Say things  
My lifes crumbling down  
Time for me to pray  
Hold me in  
Deep inside cause Im dying on my feet  
  
Life is hard  
But I think Compared to what  
Cant see the things you get to  
But deserve just what you got  
Will you still forgive me baby  
If I dont come back for more  
Everything that ever mattered baby  
Is locked behind your door  
  
Cant judge  
Things I dont understand  
Since you walked away  
Easy to  
Feel this way  
Cause Im back on the street well  
Life is  
A game you cant win  
You can only play  
Here I am  
Im just dying  
Im just dying  
Im just dying  
  
Reach out  
Someone reach out to me  
Cause Ive lost my way  
Sometimes we  
Give into things when we lie and cheat  
Say things  
My lifes crumbling down  
Time for me to pray  
Hold me in  
Deep inside cause Im dying  
Im just dying Im just dying
