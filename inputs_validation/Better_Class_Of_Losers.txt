Im getting out of this highrise penthouse suite  
Where we pretend lifes rosy and sweet  
Im going back to the folks that I used to know  
Where everyone is what they seems to be  
  
And these highclass friends that you like to hang around  
When they look my way theyre always looking down  
Im tired of spending every dime I make  
To finance this way of life Ive learned to hate  
  
Im going back to a better class of loser  
This uptown livings really got me down  
I need friends who dont pay their bills on home computers  
And who buy their coffee beans already ground  
You think its disgraceful that they drink threedollar wine  
But a better class of loser suits me fine  
  
You say the grass is greener on the other side  
From where I stand I cant see grass at all  
And the concrete and the steel wont change the way you feel  
It takes more than caviar to have a ball
