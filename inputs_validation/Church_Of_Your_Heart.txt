Cant we leave the world outside  
Just for a while Just for a while  
And spend some time you and I  
Under this bright glorious sky  
  
Its been so long since I first saw you  
But I still love that smile in your eyes  
  
Yes its true right from the start  
I believed in the church of your heart  
Yes its you that made me be part of  
And believe in the church of your heart  
  
Step inside lay yourself down  
Just for a while rest for a while  
I can hear a thundering sound  
Beating inside when youre around  
  
Its been so long since I first met you  
Since we made love you know how time flies  
  
Yes its true right from the start  
I believed in the church of your heart  
Yes its you that made me be part of  
And believe in the church of your heart  
In the church of your heart
