No cloud a sleepy calm  
Sun baked earth thats cooled by gentle breeze  
And trees with rustling leaves  
Only endless days without a care  
Nothing must be done  
  
Silent as a day can be  
Far off sounds of others on their chosen run  
As they do all those things they feel give life some meaning  
Even if theyre dull  
  
Time to stop this dreaming must rejoin the real world  
As revealed by orange lights and a smoky atmosphere  
  
The trees and I are shaken by the same winds but whereas  
The trees will lose their withered leaves  
I just cant seem to let them loose  
And they cant refresh me those hot winds of the south  
Feel like an alien a stranger in an alien place  
  
Now the light id fading fast  
Chances slip away a time will come to pass  
When therell be none  
Then addicted to a perfumed poison  
Betrayed by its aftertaste  
We shall lose the wonder and find nothing in return  
Many are the substitutes but theyre powerless an their own  
  
Beware the fisherman whos casting out his line  
Into a dried up river bed  
But dont try to tell him cause he wont believe you  
Throw some bread to the ducks instead its easier that way  
Feel like an alien a stranger in an alien place
