I have been in here for way too long  
And as I walk the halls at night  
I see the other inmates hiding from my eyes  
  
This is for the mentally ill  
For those who have lost the will  
  
I have seen the sickness of all mankind  
And as I walk the halls at night  
I see the other inmates hiding from my eyes  
  
This is for the mentally ill  
For those who have lost the will  
  
Black Hill Sanitarium Theyre driving me crazy  
Black Hill Sanitarium Theyre driving me crazy here  
  
Gotta get out of here Gotta erase the fear  
Gotta get out of here No more silent tears  
Gotta get out of here No more silent tears  
  
SOLO Herb  
  
Black Hill Sanitarium Theyre driving me crazy  
  
SOLO Andy  
  
I am going down deep into the black of my mind  
Ive had enough  
Therapy in little rooms Im lying down in my cocoon  
Nothing here could end too soon Im lying down  
Oh God I hate those men in white  
  
Oh those men in white sticking needles in my mind  
  
And as I walk the halls at night  
I see the other inmates hiding from my eyes  
  
This is for the mentally ill  
For those who have lost the will  
  
Black Hill Sanitarium Theyre driving me crazy  
Black Hill Sanitarium Theyre driving me crazy here  
  
Gotta get out of here Gotta erase the fear  
Gotta get out of here No more silent tears
