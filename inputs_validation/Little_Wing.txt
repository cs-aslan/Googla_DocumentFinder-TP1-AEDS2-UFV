Well shes walking through the clouds  
With a circus mind thats running wild  
Butterflies and zebras  
And moonbeams and a fairy tale  
Thats all she ever thinks about  
Riding the wind  
  
When Im sad she comes to me  
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free  
Its alright she saysits alright  
Take anything you want from me  
Anything  
  
Fly on little wing  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Fly on little wing
