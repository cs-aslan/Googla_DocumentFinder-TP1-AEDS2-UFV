All things come to those who wait  
Sometimes they just come too late  
And if we never speak again  
I dont wanna make that mistake  
We never seem to find  
The place or time  
To say whats on our minds so  
  
Chorus  
Tell me everything now  
Dont leave anything out  
Ill tell you all my fears  
My mistakes  
Before its too late  
  
I dont wanna wake up one day  
Wondering if I shied away  
From something that once seemed so hard  
One thing thats so simple to say  
Why do you always hide  
Your tears when you cry  
Isnt it time you try to  
  
Chorus  
  
Before its too late  
Before its too late  
  
Chorus  
  
Before its too late  
Before its too late
