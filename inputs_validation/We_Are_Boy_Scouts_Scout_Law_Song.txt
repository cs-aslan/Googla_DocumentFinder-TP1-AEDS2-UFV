We are boy scouts  
Trusting in our honour  
Loyal Helpful  
Friend to One and All  
  
Ever Courteous  
Every kind to animals  
We obey our orders even though theyre small  
  
Always cheerful  
Whistle through the rain drops  
Careful and thrifty  
Clean in thought and deed  
  
So come on boys now  
Dont forget were boy scouts  
Be prepared be prepared  
Keep in mind the law
