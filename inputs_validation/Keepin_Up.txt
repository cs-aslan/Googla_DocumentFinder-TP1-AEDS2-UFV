Whats goin on with the sun and the moon  
Cause ones goin down to early ones comin up to soon  
The hands on my old clock tell me once again that Im fallin behind  
Theres too much to do and not enough time  
  
Keepin up Im movin as fast as I can  
Keepin up in a circle that never ends  
I cant stop like it or not Im stuck  
Its runnin me to death and Im out of my breath keepin up  
  
Theres no such thing for me as a nine to five  
It takes more sweat than that just to get us by  
Its like Im chasin my own tail  
Cause Monday mornin starts another stressed out week  
  
The world is breathing down my neck I can feel the heat  
Keepin up Im movin as fast as I can  
Keepin up in a circle that never ends  
I cant stop like it or not Im stuck  
  
Its runnin me to death and Im out of my breath keepin up  
By the time we make ends meet  
Theres not much left for you and me  
And no job security  
  
It sure makes it tough  
Keepin up  
Keepin up  
I cant stop like it or not Im stuck  
  
Its runnin me to death and Im out of my breath keepin up  
Im movin as fast as I can  
Keepin up in a circle that never ends  
Keepin up  
  
I cant stop  
Keepin up like it or not  
Keepin up Im movin as fast as I can  
Keepin up in a circle that never ends  
  
Keepin up  
I cant stop  
Keepin up like it or not  
Keepin up
