The phone call was wrong  
The ibms have already gone  
Talkins too late  
The future has ended now  
Cant change our fate  
  
So sorry now  
But that dont change a thing anyhow  
Let the games begin  
The dealer laid hands out that no one can win  
  
What made us this way  
Something Im doing or something I say  
But could it be a fact  
That I never thought Id get caught in the act  
  
And I I dont know why I still keep  
Hangin around when I know that its time  
Popped the silo  
Pushed the button  
Its the big one this time  
  
Doctor strange love were all in your movie now  
You get no change love  
Your bill is too high  
  
The threats on its way  
The package from hell that you ordered today  
Pray to your sign  
Your wish has been granted this time  
  
And I I dont know why I still keep  
Hangin around when I know that its time  
Popped the silo  
Pushed the button  
Its the big one this time
