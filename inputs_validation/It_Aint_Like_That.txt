There I was laid out on a table  
Screamin sweat and bare feet to the floor  
In my life Id not soften  
Things that cut and burn so often  
But I sit think of somethin  
Scared to face the dyin nothin  
  
Chorus   
See the cycle Ive waited for  
It aint like that anymore  
  
Where I go is when I feel Im able  
How I fight is why Im feelin sore  
In my mind not forgotten  
Feel as though a tooth were rotten  
Behind the smile a tongue thats slippin  
Buzzards cry when flesh is rippin  
  
Chorus   
  
Here I sit writing on the paper  
Trying to think of words you cant ignore  
In my eyes what Im lacking  
Score at face a ten for slacking  
Sign the deal set in motion  
Smaller fish so huge the ocean  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X
