My dingalingaling  
  
When I was a little biddy boy  
My grandma bought me a cute little toy  
Two silver bells on a string  
She told me it was my dingalingaling  
  
My dingaling my dingaling wont you play with my dingaling  
My dingaling my dingaling wont you play with my dingaling  
  
When I was little boy in grammar school  
Always went by the very best rule  
But every time the bell would ring  
Youd catch me playing with my dingaling  
  
Once while climbing the garden wall  
Slipped and fell had a very bad fall  
I fell so hard I heard birds sing  
But I held on to my dingaling  
  
Once while swimming cross turtle creek  
Man them snappers right at my feet  
Sure was hard swimming cross that thing  
With both hands holding my dingaling  
  
Now this here song it aint so bad  
Prettiest little song that you ever had  
And those of you who will not sing  
Must be playing with your on dingaling
