If Id cry every time you hurt me Id be cryin all the time  
If I made a scene each time you were mean wed be quarrellin all the time  
But I dont cry and I dont get mad I try to take the good with the bad  
If Id cry every time you hurt me Id be cryin all the time  
  
Strings  
  
Now and then you say you love me I try to believe you do  
Then you turn right around and hurt me like I was nothing to you  
But I love you so and Ill stay somehow my tears wont flow and my head wont
bow  
If Id cry every time you hurt me Id be cryin all the time
