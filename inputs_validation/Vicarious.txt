Eye on the TV  
Cause tragedy thrills me  
Whatever flavor it happens to be  
Like  
Killed by the husband  
Drowned by the ocean  
Shot by his own son  
She used a poison  
In his tea  
And kissed him goodbye  
Thats my kind of story  
Its no fun until someone dies  
  
Dont look at me like  
I am a monster  
Frown out your one face  
But with the other  
Stare like a junkie  
Into the TV  
Stare like a zombie  
  
While the mother holds her child  
Watches him die  
Hands to the sky crying  
Why oh why  
  
Cause I need to watch things die from a distance  
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies  
You all need it too dont lie  
  
Why cant we just admit it  
Why cant we just admit it  
We wont give pause until the blood is flowing  
Neither the brave nor bold  
Were writers of the stories told  
We wont give pause until the blood is flowing  
  
I need to watch things die from a good safe distance  
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies  
You all feel the same so  
  
Why cant we just admit it  
  
Blood like rain come down  
Drum on grave and ground  
  
Part vampire  
Part warrior  
Carnivore and voyeur  
Still have the transmitter  
Synched to the death rattle  
  
La la la la la lalalie x4  
  
Credulous at best  
Your desire to believe in  
Angels in the hearts of men  
Pull your head of your hippie haze and give a listen  
Shouldnt have to say it all again  
  
The universe is hostile so impersonal  
Devour to survive so it is so its always been  
  
We all feed on tragedy  
Its like blood to a vampire  
  
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies  
Much better you than I
