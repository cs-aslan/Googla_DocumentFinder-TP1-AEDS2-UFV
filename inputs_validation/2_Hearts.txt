You said you would wait for me but something went wrong  
The house was empty your pictures gone  
I knew youd come back one day our love was so strong  
The past behind us its here you belong  
  
Cause Im deep inside you youre deep inside me  
I always knew that we would always be  
  
Chorus  
  
Two hearts forever one heart alone I need to know your love is mine  
Two hearts forever one heart alone I wont let go of you this time  
  
You couldve talked to me what changed your mind  
I could have been there by your side  
You thought you could walk away but you know thats a lie  
This loneliness is hard to hide  
  
Its so easy to surrender and temptation always finds a way  
You must hold on you know we must hold on whoaohoh  
  
Two hearts forever one heart alone I wont let go of you this time  
Take this heart of mine whoaohoh
