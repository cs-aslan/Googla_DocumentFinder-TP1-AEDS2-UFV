Julie Christie the rumors are true  
As the pages turn my eyes are glued  
To the movie star and his sordid life  
Mr X and his oldsuffering wife  
  
I spent so much time dreaming about Eleanor Bron  
In my room with the curtains drawn  
See her in the arms of Paul  
Say it I can say no more  
  
As the music swells somehow stronger from adversity  
Our hero finds his inner peace  
So now Im looking for a lucky charm  
With a needle hanging out of its arm  
  
As time goes by I know its gonna happen  
I know its going away  
Gonna take its toll gonna take its toll  
Gonna take my time  
  
And Im thinking about the way things are  
And Im thinking about the way things were  
Thinking about Eleanor Bron  
  
And Im thinking about a lucky charm  
And Im thinking about the needle  
Oh Im thinking about the needle  
And Im thinking about
