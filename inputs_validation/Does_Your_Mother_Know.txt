Does your mother know  
You had to go someday  
Does your mother know  
That you would go so fast  
Anyway thats all you think about  
Youd call her if you could  
  
But the letters that you write  
In the faded winter light  
Just tell her they tell her  
That youve got ten dollars  
And youll be all right  
And when you get straight  
Youre gonna come back east some day  
  
Does your mother know  
You have a man in the West  
Does your mother know  
You drove him from your door  
Anyway thats all you think about  
Youd call her if you could  
  
Does your mother know  
You walked all day in the rain  
Does your mother know  
How deep your love could be  
Anyway thats all you think about  
Youd call her if you could  
  
But the letters that you write  
In the faded winter light  
Just tell her they tell her  
That youve got ten dollars  
And your rent costs eight  
And when you get straight  
Youre gonna come back east some day  
  
But the letters that you write  
In the faded winter light  
Just tell her they tell her
