I see you jaded like a debutante  
Things your image never shows  
Theres something hiding deep inside of you  
Something that Ill never know  
Then I saw you on the streets alone  
Had you paged on the corner phone  
The words just kept me straining to express  
Youre hard to break and you still ache  
Like a young girl like a young girls heart  
Like a young girl just like a young girls heart  
I stand here waiting in my lily white  
Scan the lines youll be famous for  
Then well talk about whats good and whats bad  
Romantic moves we wont have to score  
Like you were saying what you really want  
Ah its funny you should ask me now  
It was all right there in the story I just read  
Im hard to break and you still ache  
Like a young girl like a young girls heart  
Like a young girl just like a young girls heart  
Like a young girl just like a young girls heart  
Like a young girl like a young girls heart  
Just like a young girl like a young girls heart  
Like a young girl just like a young girls heart  
Like a young girl like a young girls heart  
Like a young girl just like a young girls heart  
Like a young girl like a young girls heart  
Just like a young girls heart
