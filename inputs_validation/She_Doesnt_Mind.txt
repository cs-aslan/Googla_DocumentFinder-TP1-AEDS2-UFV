For love you pay the price  
You give it up you sacrifice  
And if necessary you comprimise  
Sometimes its bitter sweet  
Youve got to try eight days a week  
To create a good enough love to keep  
You see hearts belong to fire  
So does her love  
She burns me up with desire  
  
My girls love is right on time  
Sweet and sweet and ever kind  
Shes so fine  
She doesnt she doesnt  
She dont mind  
Even when I come home late at night  
We dont fuss we never fight  
Cause the girl loves me to the line  
She doesnt she doesnt  
She dont mind  
  
It was out of my hands  
I did my best please understand  
I was late for one of our evening plans  
Champagne dinner for two  
With candlelight she set the mood  
But there wasnt anything I could do  
  
But she is so forgiving  
The one thing I know is  
Its off her love Im living  
  
That girls love is right on time  
Sweeter than sweet and ever kind  
Shes so fine  
She doesnt she doesnt  
She dont mind  
Even when I come home late at night  
We dont fuss we never fight  
Cause the girl loves me to the line  
She doesnt she doesnt  
She dont mind  
  
When I go out to play  
She doesnt mind if Im a little bit late  
She knows I think about her face  
Till I get home  
Till I get back home  
What we gonna do tonight  
Its raining heavy and its cold outside  
So lets just love until we get things right  
And waste a whole lotta time  
I dont mind  
  
I tell her things she cant repeat  
Makes her little heart just skip a beat  
She blush a little bit  
And then I find  
She doesnt she doesnt  
She dont mind  
  
Even though our love is Cest Si Bon  
Sometimes I like to be alone  
Ring the girl on her private line  
She doesnt she doesnt  
She dont mind  
  
Go to work early come back late  
Outta my head cant concentrate  
Sometimes my love is a waste of time but  
She doesnt she doesnt  
She dont mind  
  
Shes better even than she used to be  
Loving her is no mystery  
Sometimes Im not so sweet and kind  
She doesnt she doesnt  
She dont mind  
  
When I call her in the middle of the day  
Shes busy at work but its okay  
But not too busy to give me time  
She doesnt she doesnt  
She dont mind
