Been theredone thatEvery spot on the map  
See these lines on my face and these bones out of place  
I got dirt on my hat been blessed and cussed at  
No bragjust factBeen theredone that  
I wear old blue jeansThey got holes in the seams  
Ive got boots made of brassKicked a whole lot ofyou know what I mean  
Ive been up and downboth sides of the town  
Im stating the factsBeen theredone that  
Been theredone thatEvery town on the map  
See these lines on my face and these bones out of place  
I got mud on my hatIve been blessed and cussed at  
I aint no pussy catBeen theredone that  
Guess theres only one thing Keeps a man like me going  
Gets my attention right nowWell you know what Im talking about  
A pretty green eyed queen dolled up in tight jeans  
It makes my heart beat fastcause Ive been there and done that  
Been theredone thatEvery joint on the map  
See these lines on my face and these guitar pickin fingers way out of place  
I got mud on my hatIve been blessed and cussed at  
Dont put up with no crap  
Been theredone that
