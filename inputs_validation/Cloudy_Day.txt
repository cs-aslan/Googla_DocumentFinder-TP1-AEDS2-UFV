I never did like that apartment it was not a place I like to be  
In summertime the place was hot in wintertime Id sit around and freeze  
I never did like that apartment seems to me it always smell like food  
People down the hall complained because I liked to pick and sing  
And anyway the rent was overdue  
Cloudy day this is my cloudy day  
One for you and one for him one for her and one for them  
This looks like a cloudy day for me  
Ive forgot the number of the Interstate that brought me to this town  
Ive been here for seven months and still I do not know my way around  
Well Id like to find a quiet place and trouble is I dont know where its at  
I dont know which way is best but I think Ill be headin west  
So Ill be walkin where the land is flat  
Cloudy day this is my cloudy day  
Ive know people higher up the ladder who can always pick and choose  
Anything they want to be or anyplace they go to just cant lose  
It doesnt matter who you are we all must have a cloudy day some time  
Days that we cant seem to win days that we aint got a friend  
We all have days and I guess this is mine  
Cloudy day this is my cloudy day  
One for you and one for him one for her and one for them  
This looks like a cloudy day for me
