In these days of mine for keeps Im trying to hold on  
Suddenly youre all out of reach and everything goes wrong  
What we say and what we do are entirely different things  
Meaning lost straight through the roof  
Thats not how it should be  
  
Easy like a bird  
I ride the breeze  
My mind is falling  
  
Youre so ordinary  
Youre my sanctuary in the morning darling  
New sensation love vibration  
Heart to heart and a long goodbye  
  
You go your way and Ill go my way  
Life is truer than fiction  
In this crazy land of milk and honey  
Life is just an illusion  
  
I just dont know what to believe in  
If the truth be known  
Suffering from soul fatigue  
Weathering the storm  
  
What we say and what we do are entirely different things  
Whispered voices fill the room  
Thats not how it should be  
  
Swaying like a tree  
I feel the sky  
Somebody calling  
  
Youre so ordinary  
Be my sanctuary in the morning darling  
New sensation love vibration  
Heart to heart and a dumb goodbye  
  
You go your way and Ill go my way  
Life is truer than fiction  
In this crazy mixed up world of honey  
Life is just an illusion darling  
  
Illusion darling  
Youre so ordinary  
Youre so  
Youre so ordinary  
  
Easy like a bird  
I ride the breeze  
My mind is falling  
  
Youre so ordinary  
Be my sanctuary in the morning darling  
New sensation love vibration  
Heart to heart and a long goodbye  
  
You go your way Ill go my way  
Life is truer than fiction  
In this crazy mixed up world of honey  
Life is just an illusion  
  
Youre so ordinary sanctuary  
Be my one in the morning darling  
New sensation love vibration  
Heart to heart and a dumb goodbye  
  
You go your way and Ill go my way  
Life is truer than fiction  
In this crazy mixed up world of honey  
Life is just an illusion  
  
Youre so ordinary sanctuary  
Be my light in the morning darling  
New sensation love vibration  
Heart to heart and a long goodbye  
  
You go your way and Ill go my way  
Life is truer than fiction  
In this crazy mixed up world of honey  
Life is just an illusion darling  
  
Darling  
Darling  
Darling
