The cold reign of darknessshadows the infinite shadow  
Enlisting blackness to repairthe wounds  
Which were successfully administered  
By the cruel curse of lifesblinding lights  
Hell regurgitates devouring magma from the dank depths  
  
Royalty or notyoure all gonna die  
Catholic or notyoure all gonna die  
  
Once more to reclaim the throneever more to claim heredity  
Ownership of the dead and all the responsibilities  
Falling helpless into the hands of nomore you  
That cold lonely planet was never your real home  
  
Rich man or notyoure all gonna die  
President or notyoure all gonna die  
  
There are those who defy the endscream and beg for more  
Dragged away and destined to scream  
Whims that howl in tormented storms  
No rights to beno rights to see  
Your sad epitaph shall now read as follows  
  
Scientist or notyoure all gonna die  
Satanist or not
