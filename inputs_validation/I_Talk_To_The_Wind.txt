Said the straight man to the late man  
Where have you been  
Ive been here and Ive been there  
And Ive been in between  
  
I talk to the wind  
My words are all carried away  
I talk to the wind  
The wind does not hear  
The wind cannot hear  
  
Im on the outside looking inside  
What do I see  
Much confusion disillusion  
All around me  
  
You dont possess me  
Dont impress me  
Just upset my mind  
Cant instruct me or conduct me  
Just use up my time  
  
I talk to the wind  
My words are all carried away  
I talk to the wind  
The wind does not hear  
The wind cannot hear
