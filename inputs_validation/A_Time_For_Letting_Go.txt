Sometimes you find out what you wanted  
Isnt really what you need  
And the dream and all its promise  
Was never meant to be  
All your hopes and desperation  
Wont make it like it was  
And you believe the pain will never end  
Believe me in time it does  
  
Chorus  
Youve gotta know when love is over  
Youve gotta learn to carry on  
And with the world upon your shoulders  
You walk away when hope is gone  
When your golden road has reached the end  
You find a way to start again you know  
Theres a time for love a time for letting go  
  
When youre standin tall tomorrow  
Looking back at yesterday  
Through the memory of your sorrow  
How the dawn was so far away  
Youll be far beyond the shadow  
Where hearts can learn to shine  
And youll realize the endless night  
Was only a moment in time  
  
Chorus  
  
The night is long the night is cold  
With nothing to believe in  
Just hold on cause life goes on  
Your new day is waiting  
Let go and let it begin  
  
Chorus
