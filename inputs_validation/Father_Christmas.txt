When I was small I believed in Santa Claus  
Though I knew it was my dad  
And I would hang up my stocking at Christmas  
Open my presents and Id be glad  
  
But the last time I played Father Christmas  
I stood outside a department store  
A gang of kids came over and mugged me  
And knocked my reindeer to the floor  
  
They said  
Father Christmas give us some money  
Dont mess around with those silly toys  
Well beat you up if you dont hand it over  
We want your bread so dont make us annoyed  
Give all the toys to the little rich boys  
  
Dont give my brother a Steve Austin outfit  
Dont give my sister a cuddly toy  
We dont want a jigsaw or monopoly money  
We only want the real mccoy  
  
Father Christmas give us some money  
Well beat you up if you make us annoyed  
Father Christmas give us some money  
Dont mess around with those silly toys  
  
But give my daddy a job cause he needs one  
Hes got lots of mouths to feed  
But if youve got one Ill have a machine gun  
So I can scare all the kids on the street  
  
Father Christmas give us some money  
We got no time for your silly toys  
Well beat you up if you dont hand it over  
Give all the toys to the little rich boys  
  
Have yourself a merry merry Christmas  
Have yourself a good time  
But remember the kids who got nothin  
While youre drinkin down your wine  
  
Father Christmas give us some money  
We got no time for your silly toys  
Father Christmas please hand it over  
Well beat you up so dont make us annoyed  
  
Father Christmas give us some money  
We got no time for your silly toys  
Well beat you up if you dont hand it over  
We want your bread so dont make us annoyed  
Give all the toys to the little rich boys
