Met a girl called Lola and I took her back to my place  
Feelin guilty feelin scared hidden cameras everywhere  
Stop hold on stay in control  
  
Girl I want you here with me  
But Im really not as cool as Id like to be  
Cause theres a red under my bed  
And theres a little yellow man in my head  
And theres a true blue inside of me  
That keeps stoppin me touchin ya watchin ya lovin ya
