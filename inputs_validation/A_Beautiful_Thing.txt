In the ulcerating silence perspective comes  
The way it always does for its ransom  
So randomly somebody calls  
The phone rings and it brings Niagara Falls  
At 3 oclock in the morning  
Youd better be dyin you were  
So we talked about time and where it went  
Unremarkable events and how  
One day took two days and they got spent  
How youd continue  
Carefully in degrees  
Trying to do one true beautiful thing  
And your beautiful thing  
Itd be a beautiful thing  
To see that beautiful thing continuing  
I dont live there I just commute  
Secretly cradling a joint I might puke  
Fumble with the keys under duress  
The point is this is practice duress  
3 oclock in the morning  
Youd better be dying and you were  
So we talked about things and where they went  
Big remarkable events and how  
Each days a new day and they get spent  
How youd continue artfully like the breeze  
Trying to do one true beautiful thing  
Your beautiful thing  
Itd be a beautiful thing to see  
That beautiful thing continuing  
Your beautiful thing continuing  
Your beautiful thing will be  
A beautiful thing to me  
A beautiful thing continuing  
Your beautiful thing continuing
