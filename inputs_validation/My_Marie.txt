MY MARIE  
WRITERS BARRY MASON TONY MACAULAY  
Marie  
I cant bear to see the children without bread  
Oh Marie  
They deserve a decent roof above their heads  
Trust me now  
And when I leave for town my darling dont be sad  
Or ask me how  
But tomorrow were have all the things we never had  
But if Im not back there with you  
By the time the sun goes down  
Take the train change your name  
And get the children out of town  
Yes if Im not back there with you  
By the time the sun has gone  
Forget me my Marie  
And move on  
Marie  
Ah youve never had a new dress you could wear  
Oh Marie  
You look so pretty with a ribbon in your hair  
For too long  
Youve gone without the life that I once promised you  
Right or wrong  
But today Ill find a way to make it all come true  
But if Im not back there with you  
By the time the sun goes down  
Take the train change your name  
And get the children out of town  
Yes if Im not back there with you  
By the time the sun has gone  
Forget me my Marie  
And move on  
Forget me my Marie  
And move on
