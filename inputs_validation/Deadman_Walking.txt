The enemy is at the door  
The enemy within  
Dressed up in the strangest clothes  
Smells of drinking Bombay gin  
  
Theres a deadman walking  
And his shadows growing long  
Theres a deadman walking  
Taking it in  
Before his time is gone  
  
My father was a Russian Jew  
My Irish mother crazy  
I see summer winter fall  
When grown men  
Cry like babies  
  
Theres a deadman walking  
And his shadows growing long  
Theres a deadman walking  
Taking it in  
Before his time is gone  
  
Solo  
  
Wish I never had to leave  
Wish Id never known  
Wish I could stay here forever  
Watch my garden grow  
  
Theres a deadman walking  
And his shadows growing long  
Theres a deadman walking  
Taking it in  
Before his time is gone  
  
Theres a deadman talking  
And his shadows growing long  
Theres a deadman talking  
Taking it in  
Before his time is gone  
Theres a deadman walking  
Deadman walking  
Deadman talking
