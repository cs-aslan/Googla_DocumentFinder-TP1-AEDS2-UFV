Rat in a drain ditch caught on a limb you know better but I know him  
Like I told you what I said Steal your face right off your head  
Now hes gone now hes gone Lord hes gone hes gone  
Like a steam locomotive rollin down the track  
Hes gone gone nothins gonna bring him back hes gone  
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride hot as a pistol but cool inside  
  
Cat on a tin roof dogs in a pile  
Nothin left to do but smile smile smile  
Now hes gone now hes gone Lord hes gone hes gone  
Like a steam locomotive rollin down the track  
Hes gone gone nothins gonna bring him back hes gone  
  
Goin where the wind dont blow so strange  
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain  
Lost one round but the price wasnt anything  
A knife in the back and more of the same  
Same old rat in a drain ditch caught on a limb  
You know better but I know him  
Like I told you what I said  
Steal your face right off your head  
  
Now hes gone now hes gone Lord hes gone hes gone  
Like a steam locomotive rollin down the track  
Hes gone gone nothins gonna bring him back hes gone  
Oh nothins gonna bring him back
