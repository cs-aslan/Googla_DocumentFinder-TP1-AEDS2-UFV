Aint no sunshine when shes gone  
Its not warm when shes away  
Aint no sunshine when shes gone  
Shes gone much too long  
Any time she goes away  
  
Aint no sunshine when shes gone  
Wonder if shes gone to stay  
Aint no sunshine when shes gone  
And this house just aint no home  
Anytime she goes away  
  
I know  
Shes gone to stay  
Its breakin me up  
Anytime she goes away  
Gotta leave the young thing alone  
There aint no sunshine when shes gone  
  
Aint no sunshine when shes gone  
Its not warm when shes away  
Aint no sunshine when shes gone  
And shes gone much too long  
Any time she goes away  
  
Aint no sunshine when shes gone  
I wonder if shes gone to stay  
There aint no sunshine when shes gone  
And this house just aint a home  
Any time she goes away  
  
I know  
Shes gone to stay  
Its breaking me up  
Any time she goes away  
Gotta leave the young thing alone  
There aint no sunshine when shes gone  
  
Aint no sunshine when shes gone  
I wonder if shes gone to stay  
Aint no sunshine when shes gone  
And this house just aint no home  
Any time she goes away  
Any time she goes away
