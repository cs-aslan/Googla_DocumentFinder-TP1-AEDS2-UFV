I pay my gardener to clean up my garden  
I pay my doctor to check out da other ting  
I pay my lawyer to fight for my rights  
And I pay my bodyguard to guard my body  
Theres only one man I pay  
But I dont know what Im paying for  
Im talking about the taxman  
Im talking about the taxman  
Im talking about the taxman  
  
What have you done for me lately  
Mr Taxman  
What have you done for me lately  
Mr Taxman  
What have you done for me lately  
Mr Taxman  
What have you done for me lately  
Mr Taxman  
  
You take from the rich take from the poor  
You even take from me cant understand it now  
I pay for the police to errI dont know why  
Cause if my dollar was good enough  
There wouldnt be so much crime in the streets  
They tell me youre a fat man  
And you always take and never give  
  
What have you done for me lately  
Mr Taxman
