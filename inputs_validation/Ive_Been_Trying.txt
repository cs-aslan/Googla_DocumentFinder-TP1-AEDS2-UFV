Ive been trying  
Lord knows that Ive been trying  
To understand why  
Cant I be your only man  
  
Now you said you loved me  
So sincerely  
That I believed that you loved me  
Yet I cant understand why  
Cant I be your only man  
  
Day after day you  
Ya Treat me any old way  
I wanna go but my heart says no  
Acting so strange  
But my love still remains  
So keep on trying boy  
Shes gonna change

Day after day you  
Ya Treat me any old way  
I wanna go but my heart says no  
Acting so strange  
Yet my love still remains  
It says keep on trying boy  
Shes gonna change  
  
Now Ive been trying  
Lord knows how Ive been trying  
But I cant understand why  
Cant I be your only man

Ooohohoooh  
Just keep on trying  
Ooohohoooh  
Ya gotta keep on trying  
Ooohohoooh
