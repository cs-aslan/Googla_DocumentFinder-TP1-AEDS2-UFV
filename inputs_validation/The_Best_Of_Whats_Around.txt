Hey my friend  
It seems your eyes are troubled  
Care to share your time with me  
Would you say youre feeling low and so  
A good idea would be to get it off of your mind  
  
See you and me  
Have a better time than most can dream  
Have it better than the best  
And so can pull on through  
Whatever tears at us  
Whatever holds us down  
And if nothing can be done  
Well make the best of whats around  
  
Turns out not where but who youre with  
That really matters  
That really matters  
And hurts not much when youre around  
When youre around  
  
And if you hold on tight  
To what you think is your thing  
You may find youre missing all the rest  
She ran up into the light surprised  
Her arms are open  
Her minds eye is  
  
Seeing things from a  
Better side than most can dream  
On a better road I feel  
So you could say shes safe  
Whatever tears at her  
Whatever holds her down  
And if nothing can be done  
Shell make the best of whats around  
  
Turns out not where but what you think  
That really matters  
That really matters  
That really matters  
And hurts not much when youre around
