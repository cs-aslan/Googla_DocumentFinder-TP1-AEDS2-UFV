The love you leave  
Will be there after youre gone  
Will be there after youre gone  
Still be there after youre gone  
  
The air you breathe  
Will be there after youre gone  
Will be there after youre gone  
Still be there after youre gone  
  
The lochs and seas  
Will be there after youre gone  
Will be there after youre gone  
Still be there after youre gone  
  
Three score years and ten of joy and pain  
Adds up to mayflies on the windowpane  
The windowpane  
  
The mystery  
Will be there after youre gone  
Will be there after youre gone  
Still be there after youre gone  
  
The lochs and seas  
Will be there after youre gone  
Will be there after youre gone  
Still be there after youre gone  
Gone  
  
Aaaaa  
Aaaaa  
Ah Ah Ah Ah  
  
Aaaaa  
Aaaaa  
Ah Ah Ah Ah  
  
Aaaaa
