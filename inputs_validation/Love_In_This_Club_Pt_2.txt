Chorus  
  
Shawty want a thug it started with a hug  
And the rest went like this  
I gave her neck a kissy kiss  
She gave my neck a kiss back  
I said we could do it like a stack  
I mean we could do it like a G  
On the couch in VIP  
Shawty we can get it on  
Im like shout out to the DJ  
For playin this song  
Girl we could act like two damn fools  
Have everybody think we doin a dance move  
Call me so I can make it juicy for ya  
Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover girl  
And it started with a hug but now we makin love in this club  
And we not gonna stop just because  
The people in the crowd are watching us  
Cause we dont give a damn what they say this is  
Ththe remix baby
