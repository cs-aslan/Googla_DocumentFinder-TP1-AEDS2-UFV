I keep on dancin on the roof  
Try not to fall stay in the groove  
A step too far Im out of place  
Life beats you up some of these days  
Just like a whisper theres a voice  
Inside of me  
Its sayin you aint got a choice  
Well cant you see  
  
Ooh when your world comes tumbling down  
Ooh you better find a way around  
  
I keep on walkin in the clouds  
Find out what life is all about  
I keep on runnin away from here  
To learn the grass aint greener there  
Just like a whisper theres a voice  
Inside of me  
Its sayin you aint got no choice  
As you can see  
  
Ooh when your world comes tumbling down  
Ooh you better find a way around  
Ooh cause no one else but you  
Ooh can find the stone inside your shoe  
  
Ooh when your world comes tumbling down  
Ooh you better find a way around  
Ooh cause no one else but you  
Ooh can find the stone inside your shoe  
  
Inside your shoe  
Inside your shoe  
Inside your shoe  
Yeah  
  
Keep rockin in the street  
Keep landing on my feet  
Keep runnin on and on  
Still play my favorite blond  
Keep rockin mother earth  
Just all around the world  
These days mean safer sex  
Get my survival pack  
My orgasm isnt faked  
Ooh Lord I need a break  
And whats annoying too  
Is that damn thing in my shoe  
Ooh there is a stone in my shoe
