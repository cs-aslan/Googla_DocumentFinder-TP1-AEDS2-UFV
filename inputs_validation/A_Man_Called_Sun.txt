Everybody seems to know when hes around  
He lifts me up and fades without a sound  
Mr Sun wont you shine  
Mr Sun wont you shine  
  
Why hes here I will never know  
He makes you know you feel  
Like somewhere to go  
  
Mr Sun wont you shine  
Mr Sun just you shine  
  
Walking with a man called Sun  
I think my journeys just begun  
Do you think hell mind  
  
He lifts you up he shines  
And then hes gone  
But you know you need him  
More when hes gone  
  
Mr Sun just shine  
Mr Sun just shine  
  
Walking with a man called Sun  
I think my journeys just begun  
Do you think hell mind  
  
Shine  
Shine  
Shine  
Shine  
Let it shine
