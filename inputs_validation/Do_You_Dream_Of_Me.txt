Dreams within the still of night  
On wings of hope take flight inside of me  
There upon some distant shore  
We want for nothing more than what will be  
And you and I here we are  
I wonder as weve come this far  
  
If I could only read your mind  
Tell me the answer I would find  
Do you dream of me  
And when youre smiling in your sleep  
Beyond the promises we keep  
Do you dream of me  
  
Love has found a magic space  
A deep and hidden place where time stands still  
Now I hold you in my arms  
You know you hold my heart and always will  
  
And you and I here we are  
And its a wonder that weve come this far  
  
And after all that weve been through  
Youve leaned on me Ive leaned on you  
Do you dream of me  
And when youre smiling in your sleep  
Beyond the promises we keep  
Do you dream of me  
  
If I could only read your mind  
Tell me the answer I would find  
Do you dream of me  
And when youre smiling in your sleep  
Beyond the promises we keep  
Do you dream of me  
And after all that weve been through  
Youve leaned on me Ive leaned on you  
Do you dream of me
