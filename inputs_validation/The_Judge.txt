Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
Na Na Na Na Oh Oh

Verse 1  
When the leader of the bad guys sang  
Something soft and soaked in pain  
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway  
He mustve forgot to close his door  
As he cranked out those dismal chords  
And his four walls declared him insane  
  
PreChorus  
I found my way  
Right time wrong place  
As I pled my case  
  
Chorus  
Youre the judge Oh no  
Set me free  
Youre the judge Oh no  
Set me free  
I know my souls freezing  
Hells hot for good reason  
So please take me  
  
Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
  
Verse 2  
Three lights are lit  
But the fourth ones out  
I can tell cause its a bit darker  
Than the last nights bout  
I forgot about the drought  
Of light bulbs in this house  
So I head out  
Down a route I think is heading south  
But Im not good with directions  
And I hide behind my mouth  
Im a pro at imperfections  
And Im best friends with my doubt  
And now that my minds out  
And now I hear it clear and loud  
Im thinking Wow  
I probably shouldve stayed inside my house  
  
PreChorus  
  
Chorus  
Youre the judge Oh no  
Set me free  
Youre the judge Oh no  
Set me free  
I know my souls freezing  
Hells high for good reason  
So please  
  
Bridge x2  
I dont know if this song  
Is a surrender or a revel  
I dont know if this one  
Is about me or the devil  
  
Chorus  
Youre the judge Oh no  
Set me free Oh no  
Youre the judge Oh no  
Set me free Oh no  
I know my souls freezing  
Hells high for good reason  
So please  
  
Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
  
Chorus  
Youre the judge Oh no  
Set me free  
Youre the judge Oh no  
Set me free  
Youre the judge Oh no  
Set me free  
Youre the judge Oh no  
Set me free
