They said  Oh yeah its a tough world  
Youre restless and youre young  
I said  Oh girl its a good twirl  
And your time will come your time will come  
They said  you came from the wrong side  
Hes a page from the end of the book  
I said  You came from the right side  
Took me just one look  
Then you understood  
  
With a little love  
You will survive  
With a little love  
You will get by  
Do what you want  
Go your own way  
Cause its your life  
  
With a little love  
Youll make a start  
Yeah why lovers break each others heart  
Do what you want  
Go your own way  
Cause its your life  
  
They said  no future forget it  
You came from the wrong side of town  
I said  dont listen dont let it  
Let it bring you down  
Make you wear a frown  
They said  Oh let him down easy  
Laugh at the heart you have won  
I said  that life is for living  
Like the morning sun  
It had just began
