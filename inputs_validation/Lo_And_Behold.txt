Lonely by day empty and cold  
Only to say lo and behold  
Deep in the night down in my dreams  
Glorious sight this soul has seen  
  
Theres a well on the hill  
You just cant kill for Jesus  
Theres a well on the hill let it be  
Dont build no heathen temples  
Where the Lord has done laid his hand now  
Theres a well on the hill let it be  
  
Everyones talking bout the gospel story  
Some shall sink and some shall rise  
Everyones talking bout the train to glory  
Long long time till it gets here to you baby  
  
Theres a well on the hill  
You just cant kill for Jesus  
Theres a well on the hill let it be  
Dont build no heathen temples  
Where the Lord has done laid his hand now  
Theres a well on the hill let it be
