Welcome to the years 2000 minus 25 oh say can you smell her for the smoke  
Gods still up there laughin so shes gotta be alive  
Who says he cant take a dirty joke  
  
Power isnt power does and power slips away its so easy to abuse  
Whodve thought them Arabs wouldve brought the USA just to give it to the
Jews  
Singing crime still dont pay just like it used to  
And you know this time slips away til you die  
  
Well I dont give a damn when I choose to no it dont hurt so bad when youre
high  
Oh say does the future of the homesick and the brave even matter anymore  
There aint no more reason for them boys to run away than there was to fight
before  
Would you tell me why the hell wed try  
To win back in a war what we lost in the last  
  
Might just aint as righteous as it used to be before when your armys out of
gas  
Singing crime still dont pay  
Singing crime still dont pay
