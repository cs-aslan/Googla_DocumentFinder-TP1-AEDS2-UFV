Wish I could be the one  
The one who could give you love  
The kind of love you really need  
  
That Ill always stay with you  
But baby thats not me  
You need someone willing to give their heart and soul to you  
Promise you forever baby thats something I cant do  
  
Oh I could say that Ill be all you need  
But that would be a lie  
I know Id only hurt you  
I know Id only make you cry  
  
Im not the one youre needing  
I love you goodbye  
  
I hope someday you can  
Find some way to understand Im only doing this for you  
I dont really want to go  
But deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do  
  
Youll find someone wholl be the one that I could never be  
Wholl give you something better  
Than the love youll find with me  
Oh I could say that Ill be all you need  
  
But that would be a crime  
I know Id only hurt you  
I know Id only make you cry  
Im not the one youre needing  
I love you goodbye  
  
Leaving someone when you love someone  
Is the hardest thing to do  
When you love someone as much as I love you  
  
Oh I dont want to leave you  
Baby it tears me up inside  
But Ill never be the one youre needing  
I love you goodbye  
  
Baby its never goin work out  
I love you goodbye
