Were character actors from the Tower of Babel  
Bewildered burnt out hardly able  
To sit astride the high wire cable  
Its hard to balance a little unstable  
  
Through broken eyes and contact lenses  
Watched you draw your future tenses  
See kisses of flame blow out of your lips  
Youre back telling me your Apocalypse  
  
Dont get me wrong Ill be strong  
When the slow burn sunset come along  
Youve gotta stay the night  
I gotta think that you might  
  
Weve tried a handful of bills and a handful of pills  
Weve tried making movies from a volume of stills  
But the words fell like hailstones  
bouncing at our feet  
Covering our feelings with a frozen sheet  
  
A chance to move I take a shot  
I get cold you get hot  
We look outside lyin awake  
See birds breaking surface on a silent lake  
  
But dont get me wrong Ill be strong  
When Im back on the Isle of Avalon  
Dont get me wrong Ill be strong  
When the slow burn sunset come along  
Youve got to stay the night  
Ive got to think that you might  
  
Dont try to make it easy itll cut you down to size  
Darlin weve got to trust in something  
Were shooting down our skies  
Shooting down our skies
