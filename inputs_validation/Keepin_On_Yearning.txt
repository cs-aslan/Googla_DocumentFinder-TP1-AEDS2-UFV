Keepin on smoking Lord I keep on joking  
Keepin on moving a round  
Leaving everything behind until at last  
I find what no ones ever found  
  
Feeling kind of lonely on the telephone  
To day I must keep moving on  
Leaving everything I know I really need  
And so I guess Ill move a long  
  
It doesnt matter if the sun dont shine  
It doesnt matter if the rain dont fall  
I could think about you all the time  
Do you ever think of me at all  
  
Keepin on yearnin keepin on learnin  
Lord I keep turning it on  
Leaving everything I know I really love  
And so I guess Ill move along  
  
It doesnt matter if the sun dont shine  
It doesnt matter if the rain dont fall  
I know I could make you mine  
You know I wouldnt mind at all  
  
Keepin on smokin gotta keep on joking  
Gotta keep moving around  
Leaving everything behind until at last  
I find what no ones ever found  
  
It doesnt matter if the sun dont shine  
It doesnt matter if the rain dont fall  
I could think about you all the time  
Do you ever think of me at all  
  
Keepin on yearnin gotta keep on learnin  
Gotta keep turning it on  
Leaving everything I know I really love  
And so I guess Ill move along  
  
It doesnt matter if the sun dont shine  
It doesnt matter if the rain dont fall  
I know I could make you mine  
You know I wouldnt mind at all
