There I was again tonight forcing laughter faking smiles  
Same old tired lonely place  
Walls of insincerity  
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face  
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you  
  
Your eyes whispered have we met  
Across the room your silhouette starts to make its way to me  
The playful conversation starts  
Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy  
And it was enchanting to meet you  
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you  
  
This night is sparkling dont you let it go  
Im wonder struck blushing all the way home  
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you  
  
The lingering question kept me up  
Two am who do you love  
I wonder till Im wide awake  
Now Im pacing back and forth wishing you were at my door  
Id open up and you would say hey  
It was enchanting to meet you  
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you  
  
This night is sparkling dont you let it go  
Im wonder struck blushing all the way home  
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew  
This night is flawless dont you let it go  
Im wonder struck dancing around all alone  
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you  
  
This is me praying that this was the very first page  
Not where the story line ends  
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again  
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon  
I was enchanted to meet you  
Please dont be in love with someone else  
Please dont have somebody waiting on you  
Please dont be in love with someone else  
Please dont have somebody waiting on you  
  
This night is sparkling dont you let it go  
Im wonder struck blushing all the way home  
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew  
This night is flawless dont you let it go  
Im wonder struck dancing around all alone  
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you  
  
Please dont be in love with someone else  
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
