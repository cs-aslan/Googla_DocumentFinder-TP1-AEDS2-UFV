Its a frighten time  
For people round the world  
Feel uneasy now about the future  
Time to end the war against humanity  
Time to build the peace  
In our new century  
  
Were talking bout a revolution an evolution of the heart  
  
The listening heart  
Opens up but wont surrender  
Just as you are  
To what you could be  
Opening Mind  
Reaching out for something better  
Changing my life  
A revolution of the heart  
  
Theres a beating heart that beats in everyone  
Fills the universe without exception  
From a speck of dust to far off galaxies  
Right back down to Earth  
The heart of you and me  
  
Were talking bout a revolution an evolution of the heart  
  
The listening heart  
Opens up but wont surrender  
Just as you are  
To what you can be  
  
Opening Mind  
Reaching out for something better  
Changing my life  
A revolution of the heart  
  
Were talking bout a revolution an evolution of the heart  
  
The listening heart  
Opens up but wont surrender  
Just as you are  
To what you can be  
  
Opening Mind  
Reaching out for something better  
Changing my life  
A revolution of the heart
