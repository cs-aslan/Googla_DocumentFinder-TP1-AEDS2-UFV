Tonights the night were gonna make it happen  
Tonight well put all other things aside  
Get in this time and show me some affection  
Were goin for those pleasures in the night  
  
I want to love you feel you wrap myself around you  
I want to squeeze you please you I just cant get enough  
And if you move real slow I let it go  
  
Im so excited and I just cant hide it  
Im about to lose control and I think I like it  
Im so excited and I just cant hide it  
And I know I know I know I know I know I want you  
  
We shouldnt even think about tomorrow  
Sweet memories will last for long long time  
Well have a good time Baby dont do worry  
And if were still playin around boy thats just fine  
  
Lets get excited we just cant hide it  
Im about to lose control and I think I like it  
Im so excited and I just cant hide it  
I know I know I know I know I know I want you I want you  
  
I want to love you feel you wrap myself around you  
I want to squeeze you please you I just cant get enough  
And if you move real slow I let it go  
  
Im so excited I just cant hide it  
Im about to lose control and I think I like it  
Im so excited and I just cant hide it  
I know I know I know I know I know I want you
