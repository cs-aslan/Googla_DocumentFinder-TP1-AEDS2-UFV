The sun came up  
Desperate desperate  
The stars above  
Held you back once again  
  
Half way here  
Half way here  
They whisper  
You talk so much sense  
  
When youre sleeping  
When youre sleeping  
And you share all the secrets  
And the mystery when youre sleeping  
  
I saw your tears  
Violet violet  
And its been years  
The skies been crying for you  
  
I found out beautiful things about you  
You talk so much sense  
When youre sleeping  
When youre sleeping  
  
And you share all the secrets  
And the mystery  
When youre sleeping  
  
So you go and wonder  
Where you wander  
Lose yourself to  
Take us higher  
And Ill be waiting  
For you when youre down  
  
You talk so much sense  
When youre sleeping  
When youre sleeping  
And you share all the secrets  
And the mystery  
When youre sleeping  
  
You talk so much sense  
When youre sleeping  
When youre sleeping  
And you share all the secrets  
And the mystery  
When youre sleeping
