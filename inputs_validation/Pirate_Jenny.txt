You people can watch while Im scrubbing these floors  
And Im scrubbin the floors while youre gawking  
Maybe once ya tip me and it makes ya feel swell  
In this crummy Southern town  
In this crummy old hotel  
But youll never guess to who youre talkin  
No You couldnt ever guess to who youre talkin  
  
Then one night theres a scream in the night  
And youll wonder who could that have been  
And you see me kinda grinnin while Im scrubbin  
And you say Whats she got to grin  
Ill tell you  
  
Theres a ship  
The Black Freighter  
With a skull on its masthead  
Will be coming in  
  
You gentlemen can say Hey gal finish them floors  
Get upstairs Whats wrong with you Earn your keep here  
You toss me your tips  
And look out to the ships  
But Im counting your heads  
As Im making the beds  
Cuz theres nobody gonna sleep here honey  
Nobody  
Nobody  
  
Then one night theres a scream in the night  
And you say Whos that kicking up a row  
And ya see me kinda starin out the winda  
And you say Whats she got to stare at now  
Ill tell ya  
  
Theres a ship  
The Black Freighter  
Turns around in the harbor  
Shootin guns from her bow  
  
Now  
You gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face  
Cause every building in town is a flat one  
This whole frickin place will be down to the ground  
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound  
And you yell Why do they spare that one  
Yes  
Thats what you say  
Why do they spare that one  
  
All the night through through the noise and todo  
You wonder who is that person that lives up there  
And you see me stepping out in the morning  
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair  
  
And the ship  
The Black Freighter  
Runs a flag up its masthead  
And a cheer rings the air  
  
By noontime the dock  
Is aswarmin with men  
Comin out from the ghostly freighter  
They move in the shadows  
Where no one can see  
And theyre chainin up people  
And theyre bringin em to me  
Askin me  
Kill them NOW or LATER  
Askin ME  
Kill them now or later  
  
Noon by the clock  
And so still by the dock  
You can hear a foghorn miles away  
And in that quiet of death  
Ill say Right now  
Right now  
  
Then theyll pile up the bodies  
And Ill say  
Thatll learn ya  
  
And the ship  
The Black Freighter  
Disappears out to sea  
And  
On  
It  
Is  
Me
