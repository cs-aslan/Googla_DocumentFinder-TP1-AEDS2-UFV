She played third base on a softball team  
Had a pretty good arm and a real nice swing  
I was workin part time out at Gentrys farm  
Had a thing for a girl in a uniform  
After the game she was mine young wild and free  
Yeah old Mr Gentry was pretty cool he said son I know where Id be  
And what Id say if it was me  
  
Chorus  
One of these days Im gonna have to grow up  
Have to get real jobs and be adult some day just not today  
Have to worry about things out of our control  
Like kids love and money and gettin old someday just not today  
Just not today  
  
Had a rope swing hanging from a sycamore tree  
By a deep little spot on white sand creek  
Used to walk barefoot down a little dirt path  
Wed throw out the beach towels and lay on our backs  
Had four wheel drive trucks parked up in the shade  
With those speakers blasting we never knew how much we really had it made  
Without a care in the world wed say  
  
Chorus  
  
Have to show some maturity responsibility  
Pay the ole fiddler face reality  
Maybe tomorrow the older and wiser well be  
God love us well be  
  
One of these days were gonna have to grow up  
Have to get real jobs and be adult some day just not today  
Have to worry about things out of our control  
Like kids love and money and gettin old someday just not today  
Just not today  
Just not today  
Just not today
