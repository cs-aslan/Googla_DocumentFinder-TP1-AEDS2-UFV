Verse 2  
Im In My M6 Beemer  
This Is No 645

So Much Weight Off In My House You Would Think It Was A Gym  
Plus My Nikes Match My Necklace And My Necklace Match My Rims  
I Got Court In Early Mornin I Dont Really Wana Go  
Say I Violated Probation Just Because I Blew My Nose  
Blew 300 On My Rolce

Million Dollars On The Crib

East Atlanta 6  
You Know How We Roll  
I Just Bought Anotha Chevy Got It Right Back Out The Bowl  
Tall Stacks Up In My Closet I Cant Even See My Clothes  
And My Belly Get So Big I Can Hardly See My Toes  
Got A Car In My Garage I Have Never Ever Drove  
Its A Door Black On Black Phantom I Call That Bitch Dorrough  
If She Going To The Ladies Room I Guess Ill Let Her Know  
I Got Powder In My Living Room So She Dont Have To Stroll  
A Year Ago Today I Was Sitting In My Cell  
Where You See Yoself In 5 Years  
A So Icey Billionare  
Gucci  
  
Chorus
