Love cant you see Im alone  
Cant you give this fool a chance  
A little love is all I ask  
A little kindness in the night  
  
Please dont leave me behind  
No dont tell me love is blind  
A little love is all I ask  
And that is all  
  
Ooh love Ive been searchin so long  
Ive been searchin high and low  
And little love is all I ask  
A little sadness when you go  
  
Maybe youll need a friend  
Only please dont lets pretend  
A little love is all I ask  
And that is all  
  
I wanna spread my wings  
But I just cant fly  
As a string of pearls  
The pretty girls go sailin by  
  
Ocean deep  
Im so afraid to show my feelings  
I have sailed a million ceilings  
Solitary room  
  
Ocean deep  
Will I ever find a lover  
Maybe she has found another  
And as I cry myself to sleep  
I know this love of mine Ill keep  
Ocean deep  
  
Now cant you hear when I call  
Cant you hear a word I say  
A little love is all I ask  
A little feelin when we touch  
  
Why am I still alone  
Ive got a heart without a home  
A little love is all I ask  
And that is all  
  
I wanna spread my wings  
But I just cant fly  
As a string of pearls  
The pretty girls go sailin by  
  
Ocean deep  
Im so afraid to show my feelings  
I have sailed a million ceilings  
Solitary room  
  
Ocean deep  
Will I ever find a lover  
Maybe she has found another  
And as I cry myself to sleep  
I know this love of mine Ill keep  
Ocean deep  
  
Im so lonely lonely lonely Ocean deep  
On my own in my room  
Im so lonely  
Ocean deep  
Im so lonely Im so lonely  
This love of mine  
Ill be ocean deep  
Im so lonely lonely lonely  
In my room
