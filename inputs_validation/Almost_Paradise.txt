I thought that dreams belonged to other men  
Cause each time I got close theyd fall apart again  
I thought my heart would beat in secrecy  
I faced the nights alone oh how could I have known  
That all my life I only needed you  
  
Woah almost paradise  
Were knocking on heavens door  
Almost paradise  
How could we ask for more  
I swear that I could see forever in your eyes  
Paradise  
  
It seems that perfect loves so hard to find  
Id almost given up you must have read my mind  
And all these dreams I save for a rainy day  
Theyre finally coming true Ill share them all with you  
Cause now we hold the future in our hands  
  
Woah almost paradise  
Were knocking on heavens door  
Almost paradise  
How could we ask for more  
I swear that I could see forever in your eyes  
Paradise  
  
And in your arms salvations not so far away  
Its getting closer closer every day  
  
Almost paradise  
Were knocking on heavens door  
Almost paradise  
How could we ask for more  
I swear that I could see forever in your eyes  
Paradise  
Paradise  
Paradise
