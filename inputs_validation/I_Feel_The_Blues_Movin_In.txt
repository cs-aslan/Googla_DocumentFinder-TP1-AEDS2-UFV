Dell McCoury  
Though the miles are between us  
I thought our love would strengthen  
As it has so many times before  
But something has happened  
I can see it in your eyes  
I can feel my world is crumblin  
And the blues are at my door  
The last letter that you wrote was  
On a blue piece of paper  
That old feelins back  
The clouds are movin in  
The beginning of the end is near  
I feel your love has faded into darkness  
It seems I have no friend  
I feel the blues movin in  
Oh its not the words you wrote that made me sad  
And brokenhearted  
Thats put me in this sad shape Im in  
Between the lines are mixed emotions  
And theres teardrops on the paper  
You said thats all Ill write today  
Ill cose for now old friend  
The last letter that you wrote was  
On a blue piece of paper  
That old feelins back  
The clouds are movin in  
My state of mind is desperate  
And this hole that Im sinkin in  
Gets deeper while Im diggin to get out  
Oh please give the right answer to the questions Im askin  
Tell me you still love me  
That would turn my world about  
The last letter that you wrote was  
On a blue piece of paper  
That old feelins back  
The clouds are movin in
