Well I wrote to Santa just today I told him I dont plan to stay  
Cause youve been bad yes youve been treatin me wrong  
So listen to me heres Christmas cheers because you wont be with me here  
I wont decorate your Christmas tree this year  
You can stay out there to toast and cheer with all of your friends  
Dont hang on me a bein here when you come back again  
Your bags are burnt out and your tinsel dont shine  
I just wont be a waitin this time  
I wont decorate your Christmas tree this year  
 guitar   
Well I wont be here this Christmas Day I wouldnt give the presents anyway  
But have a good time dont be concerned about me  
Im going back to my mom and dad they love me more than you ever had  
I wont decorate your Christmas tree this year  
You can stay out there  
No I wont decorate your Christmas tree this year
