Somethings gotta give  
Somethings gotta give  
Somethings gotta give  
When an irresistible force such as you  
Meets and old immovable object like me  
You can bet as sure as you live  
Somethings gotta give somethings gotta give  
Somethings gotta give  
When an irrepressible smile such as yours  
Warms an old implacable heart such as mine  
Dont say no because I insist  
Somewhere somehow  
Someones gonna be kissed  
So on guard who knows what the fates have in store  
From their vast mysterious sky  
Ill try hard ignoring those lips I adore  
But how long can anyone try  
Fight fight fight fight fight it with all of our might  
Chances are some heavenly star spangled night  
Well find out as sure as we live  
Somethings gotta give somethings gotta give  
Somethings gotta give  
Fight fight fight it with all of our might  
Chances are some heavenly star spangled night  
Well find out as sure as we live  
Somethings gotta give somethings gotta give  
Somethings gotta give  
Somethings gotta somethings gotta give
