Feat Dr Dre  
  
You dont see me he same no more  
Its hard to see the light  
Were closing doors  
Dont treat me like like Im invisible  
Your tone with me is not the usual  
We scream we fight  
Saying things that we both regret  
And thats not right that you could just forget me like that  
You never try  
Always taking the easy route  
Always taking the easy route  
Never wanting to work it out  
  
You want to be free  
You want to leave me  
I cant believe  
Cause without you Baby Im incomplete  
  
Chorus  
Am I erased  
Just a figment of your imagination Yea  
Im feeling replaced  
Like a faded picture where you cant see my face  
Im scratched out erased  
  
In memory of what we used to call love  
I reminisce what used to be us  
Remember when when I was the most important to you  
But now Im a ghost  
The trust has died  
Theres no way we can bring it back  
We live a lie no bars no strings attached  
Its in your eyes a part of you just wants me back  
All of me just wants you back  
  
You wanna be free  
You wanna be free  
You wanna leave me  
You wanna leave me  
I cant believe  
I cant believe  
  
Am I am I  
  
Chorus  
Am I erased  
Just a figment of your imagination Yea  
Im feeling replaced  
Like a faded picture  
Where you cant see me face  
  
Chorus  
Am I erased  
Just a figment of your imagination Yea  
Im feeling replaced like a faded picture  
Where you cant see me face  
  
Im scratched out erased X4  
  
Can anybody see me  
See me now  
Im erased from the crowd  
So cold and I dont know how  
Find me now  
  
Chorus  
Am I erased  
Just a figment of your imagination Yea  
Im feeling replaced  
Like a faded picture  
Where you cant see me face  
  
Chorus  
Am I erased  
Just a figment of your imagination Yea  
Im feeling replaced  
Like a faded picture  
Where you cant see me face  
  
Im scratched out erased X4
