Buried beneath the statue the answer hides  
Enduring throughout the ages  
The transmitter lies  
Once the chambers open the signal will be sent  
To another world far beyond the stars  
  
Dont open til doomsday  
Destructions not far away  
Dont open til doomsday  
You might not like what you find  
  
Dont open til doomsday  
Destructions not far away  
Dont open til doomsday  
You might not like what you find inside  
  
We were warned of this coming so long ago  
Immortal secrets man shouldnt know  
Entering a realm where we just dont belong  
We called them and theyre coming  
  
Dont open til doomsday  
Destructions not far away  
Dont open til doomsday  
You might not like what you find inside  
  
Dont open til doomsday  
Inside Destructions not far away  
Inside Dont open til doomsday  
You might not like what you find  
You might not like what you find inside
