Im looking for a religious girl  
With childbearing hips and a wedding veil  
But im saddened to report sir its not easy  
This town is full of those cynical girls  
Walking two steps behind fortyfiveyearolds  
I cant bear to hear those church bells ring again  
So driver cant you drive me a little more slowly  
Ive gotta go  
Cant you find me some george jones on your radio  
Ive gotta go cant say no to the church
