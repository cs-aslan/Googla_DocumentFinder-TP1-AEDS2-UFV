Well the party is through we said our goodbyes  
We had a good time yet theres tears in my eyes  
Oh what can it be whats the matter with me  
You left me half loved  
We stood in the dark and you held my hand  
Why were you afraid I cant understand  
I wanted your kiss but its always like this  
You left me half loved  
Well you hold me close everytime we danced  
  
Am I a fool to think that I had a chance  
To hope you see Im your big romance  
Baby thats why Im in the dark  
Ohohohoh my friends have all said  
To love you is wrong  
They say youre too young but Ill string along  
Someday youll wake up and then Ill make up  
For bein half loved
