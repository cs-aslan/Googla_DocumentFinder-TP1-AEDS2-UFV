Lip stick junkie  
Debunked the only one  
She came back wearing a smile  
Lookalike someone drug me  
They wanted to unplug me  
No one here is on trial  
Its just a turnaround  
And we go oh  
Well then we go uh huh oh  
  
Tick tock I want to rock you  
Like the eighties  
Cock blocking isnt allowed  
Tugboat Shiela is into memorabilia  
Who said three is a crowd  
We better get it on the go  
  
Weve got to make it rain somehow  
She told me to  
And showed me what to do  
How Maggie makes it in her cloud  
  
I said hey now  
Weve got to make it rain somehow  
She told me to  
And showed me what to do  
She knows how to make it loud  
  
Rain dance Maggie  
Advances to the final  
Who knew that she had the goods  
Little did I know  
Her body was one  
Delicious vinyl  
To your method the words  
I want to lick a little bit  
  
Hey now  
Weve got to make it rain somehow  
She told me to  
And showed me what to do  
How Maggie makes it in her cloud  
  
Weve got the wrong girl  
But not for long girl  
Its in the song girl  
Cause Ill be gone girl  
  
Hey now  
Weve got to make it rain somehow  
She told me to  
And showed me what to do  
How Maggie makes it in her cloud  
  
I said hey now  
I want to rock this rowdy crowd  
She told me to  
And showed me what to do  
She knows how to make it loud  
  
But not for long girl  
Its in the song girl  
Cause Ill be gone bye bye bye yeah  
Bye bye bye girl  
  
Bye bye girl  
Bye bye girl  
Bye bye
