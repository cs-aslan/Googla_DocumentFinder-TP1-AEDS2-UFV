My heart it longs my soul it thirst for more  
For more of you  
Im reaching out Im waiting here for more  
For more of you  
  
Cause all I want is you  
All I need is to be here with you  
  
Im hungry for Your fire  
Im desperate Youre my one desire  
Jesus please dont pass me by  
  
I need You more than ever  
Im thirsty for a touch from Heaven  
Jesus please dont pass me by
