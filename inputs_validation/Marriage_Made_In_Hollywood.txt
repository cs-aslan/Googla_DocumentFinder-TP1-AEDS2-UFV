Jimmys not a high concept guy  
But hes front page news let me tell you why  
Hes on the cover of the New York Post  
Every network coast to coast  
All he needed was a hot night in June  
Cause he had the needle and he had the spoon  
When he spiked it bit and man he flew  
Into Americas living room  
  
We all love tragedy and it loves us too  
Its a marriage made in Hollywood  
Between greed and you  
All you need to be a star is to die in open view  
Its a marriage made in Hollywood  
Between greed and you  
Between greed and you  
Between greed and you  
  
Loved by women admired by men  
He walked down Broadway with his best friend  
His brain was wired like a light in a socket  
With his old friend in his back pocket  
That horse could kick that horse could scream  
Ride you outta here into a different scene  
Unrequited love and that makes it fair  
But who keeps score when youre in midair  
  
We all love tragedy it loves us too  
Its a marriage made in Hollywood  
Between greed and you  
All you need to be a star is to die in open view  
Its a marriage made in Hollywood  
Between greed and you  
Between greed and you  
Between greed and you  
  
Like a freefall chute that didnt open  
He looked down to see his dream was broken  
He stared back up at a hot grey sky  
Reran his life and then he died  
Well if you jump off a building brother beware  
Cause my friend Jimmy woke up midair  
No time to smile no time to wave  
They buried him in a media grave  
  
We all love tragedy it loves us too  
Its a marriage made in Hollywood  
Between greed and you  
And all you need to be a star is to die in open view  
Its a marriage made in Hollywood  
Between greed and you  
Between greed and you  
Between greed and you
