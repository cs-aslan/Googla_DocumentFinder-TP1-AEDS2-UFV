It was in the merry month of May  
When green buds were aswelling  
Sweet William on his death bed lay  
For the love of Barbriallen  
  
He sent his servant to the town  
The place where shed been dwelling  
Say master dear has sent me here  
If your name be Barbriallen  
  
And slowly slowly she got up  
And slowly she went to him  
And all she said when she got there  
Young man I think you are dying  
  
Oh dont you remember the other day  
When we where in a tavern  
You drank your health to the ladies there  
And you slighted Barbriallen  
  
He turned his face unto the wall  
He turned his back upon her  
Adieu adieu to all my friends  
Be kind to Barbriallen  
  
She looked to the east she looked to the west  
She saw his corpse acoming  
Oh put him down for me she cried  
That I may gaze upon him  
  
The more she looked the more she grieved  
She bursted it out in crying  
Oh pick me up and carry me home  
For I feel like I am dying  
  
They buried sweet Willy in the old church yard  
And Barbara in the new one  
From Willys grave there grew a rose  
From Barbaras a green briar  
  
They grew and they grew on the old church wall  
And could not grow no higher  
And there they tied in a true loves knot  
The rose bush and the briar
