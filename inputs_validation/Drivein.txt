Every time I have a date theres only one place to go  
Thats to the drive in  
Its such a groovy place to talk and maybe watch a show  
Down at the drive in  
  
Forget about the plot itll do very well  
But make sure you see enough so youre prepared to tell  
About the drive in  
I love the drive in  
we love the drive in we love the drive in  
  
If the windows get fogged youll have to take a breath  
Down at the drive in  
Or the cat dressed in white will scare you both to death  
Down at the drive in  
  
A big buttered popcorn and an extra large coke  
A few chili dogs and man Im goin broke  
Down at the drive in  
Yeah at the drive in  
we love the drive in we love the drive in  
  
Dont sneak your buddies in the trunk cause they might get caught  
By the drive in  
And theyd look kinda stupid gettin chased through the lot  
Around the drive in  
  
If you say you watch the movie youre a couple o liars  
And remember only you can prevent forest fires  
Down at the drive in  
  
I love the drive in  
we love the drive in we love the drive in  
Down at the drive in  
  
I love the drive in  
we love the drive in we love the drive in  
Down at the drive in  
  
I love the drive in  
we love the drive in we love the drive in
