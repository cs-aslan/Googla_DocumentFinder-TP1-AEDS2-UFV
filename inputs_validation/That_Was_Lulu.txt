When you woke up this morning  
On your front lawn  
You had a smile on your lips and  
Your wallet was gone  
You remember some girl  
But the rest is all a blur  
Well youre not the first one to fall under  
Her spell  
I know dozens of guys whove been there  
As well  
Theyve got scars to show  
And they owe em all to her  
Chorus  
That was Lulu  
Did she fool you  
That was Lulu  
That aint legal  
That aint voodoo  
That was Lulu  
Well Lulus got charms that money cant buy  
And shes made her reputation  
Making strong men cry  
All the victims may change  
But there stories are the same  
Lulus there whey your airplane  
Just happens to crash  
Still she walks away without even a scratch  
Leaving in flames  
But she never leaves her name  
Chorus  
And I know what Im talking about  
I saw it all from the start  
Long before she started running around  
Who do you think ran away with my heart  
That was Lulu  
Chorus
