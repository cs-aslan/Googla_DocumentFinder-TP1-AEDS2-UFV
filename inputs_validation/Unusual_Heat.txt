My mind tells me what will be shall be  
Not a thing I can do about it  
Cause in my heart I cant do without it  
Its so cold out here like minus ten degrees  
And Im trying to get through to you baby  
Ive got my heart on ice and its about to freeze yeah  
Only you can pull me through  
Cause I want some of your unusual heat yeah  
And I need more and more unusual heat  
My body tells me hold on I gotta hold on  
But Im so cold and hungry  
All stretched out like a month of Sundays  
Ive been out of my head from that very first day  
Searchin for somebody like you  
Ive been stumblin around every step of the way alright  
And only you can pull me through  
Cause I want some of your unusual heat yeah  
And I need more and more unusual heat yeah yeah  
I need it every way every minute of the day  
Baby Im yours Ill do anything you say  
If you just give me some of your warm unusual heat yeah  
Its so cold out here Im about to freeze  
But Im still trying to get through to you  
Ive got my heart on ice oh baby please please please  
Only you can pull me through  
Cause I want some of your unusual heat yeah  
And I need more and more unusual heat oh  
I need it every way every minute of the day  
Baby Im yours Ill do anything you say  
If you just give me some of your warm
