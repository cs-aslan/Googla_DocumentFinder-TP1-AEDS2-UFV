Im standing on a bridge  
Im waitin in the dark  
I thought that youd be here by now  
Theres nothing but the rain  
No footsteps on the ground  
Im listening but theres no sound  
  
Isnt anyone tryin to find me  
Wont somebody come take me home  
  
Its a damn cold night  
Tryna figure out this life  
Wont you take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I dont know who you are  
But I Im with you  
  
Mmeemm  
  
Im looking for a place  
Im searching for a face  
Is anybody here I know  
Cause nothins going right  
And everythins a mess  
And no one likes to be alone  
  
Isnt anyone tryin to find me  
Wont somebody come take me home  
Its a damn cold night  
Tryna figure out this life  
Wont you take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I dont know who you are  
But I Im with you  
Im with you yeah you  
  
Oh why is everything so confusing  
Maybe Im just out of my mind  
Yea yea yea yea yea yea yea oh  
  
Its a damn cold night  
Tryna figure out this life  
Wont you take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I dont know who you are  
But I Im with you  
Im with you  
  
Take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I dont know who you are  
But I Im with you  
Im with you  
  
Take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I dont know who you are  
But I Im with you  
Oh  
Im with you
