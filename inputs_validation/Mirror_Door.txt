If you dont hear me how can I tell you  
If you dont listen why should I speak  
If youre indifferent how can I reach you  
Just cos youre angry dont assume Im weak  
  
Howling Wolf and old Link Wray  
Dave Van Ronk and Doris Day  
Bobby Darin Brownie McGhee  
Elvis Buddy and Eddie C  
  
Music makes me makes me strong  
Strong vibrations make me long  
Long for a place where I belong  
You will find me in this song  
  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
Will there be music or will there be war  
Will we be rich or will we be poor  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
Will there be music or will there be war  
Will we be rich or will we be poor  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
  
A thousand angels a million children  
Fire and fear in a suicide eye  
Golden stairway to a Zeppelin heaven  
Rolling thunder under New York sky  
  
Frank n Ella Ray Whatd I Say  
Johnny Cash and Johnnie Ray  
Amadeus and Ludvig Van  
Henry Johann and the doo dah band  
  
We are here in celebration  
This musics gonna make us strong  
We climb up high to the golden station  
Curtis Mayfield aint waiting long  
  
Get on board  
  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
Will there be music or will there be war  
Will we be rich or will we be poor  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
Will there be music or will there be war  
Will we be rich or will we be poor  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
  
Howling Wolf and old Link Wray  
Dave Van Ronk and Doris Day  
Bobby Darin Brownie McGhee  
Elvis Buddy and Eddie C  
  
Frank n Ella Ray Whatd I Say  
Johnny Cash and Johnnie Ray  
Amadeus and Ludvig Van  
Henry Johann and the doo dah band  
  
Keep on climbing
