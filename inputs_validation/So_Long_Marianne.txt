Come over to the window my little darling  
Id like to try to read your palm  
I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy  
Before I let you take me home  
  
Now so long Marianne its time that we began  
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again  
  
Well you know that I love to live with you  
But you make me forget so very much  
I forget to pray for the angels  
And then the angels forget to pray for us  
  
Now so long Marianne its time that we began  
  
We met when we were almost young  
Deep in the green lilac park  
You held on to me like I was a crucifix  
As we went kneeling through the dark  
  
Oh so long Marianne its time that we began  
  
Your letters they all say that youre beside me now  
Then why do I feel alone  
Im standing on a ledge and your fine spider web  
Is fastening my ankle to a stone  
  
Now so long Marianne its time that we began  
  
For now I need your hidden love  
Im cold as a new razor blade  
You left when I told you I was curious  
I never said that I was brave  
  
Oh so long Marianne its time that we began  
  
Oh you are really such a pretty one  
I see youve gone and changed your name again  
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside  
To wash my eyelids in the rain  
  
Oh so long Marianne its time that we began
