What about your friends  
What about  
What about your friends  
What about what about  
  
Every now and then I get a little crazy  
Thats not the way its supposed to be  
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy  
I cant tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me yeah  
  
People try to say I act a little funny  
But thats just a figure of speech to me  
They tell me I changed because I got money  
But if you were there before then youre still down with me  
  
Chorus  
What about your friends will they stand their ground  
Will they let you down again  
What about your friends are they gonna be low down  
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you  
  
Well is it me or can it be Im a little too  
Friendly so to speak hypothetically  
Say I supply creativity to what others  
Must take as a form of selfhate  
Only to make an enemy  
Which results in unfortunate destiny  
They dog me out then be next to me  
Just cause I am what some choose to envy  
  
Every now and then I get a little easy  
I let a lot of people depend on me  
I never though they would ever deceive me  
Dont you know when times got rough I was standing on my own  
Ill never let another get that close to me  
You see Ive grown a lot smarter now  
Sometimes you have to choose and then youll see  
If your friend is true theyll be there with you  
Through the thick and thin  
  
Chorus  
  
Friends  
Let you down again  
Be low down  
  
Forget giggly boogly  
Im attack it like a seizure  
I got rhymes at my leisure  
Time when I need ta  
With T to the L to the C  
What I be sayin  
Gettin loose on this track  
But underground is where Im stayin  
So hip hip hooray organizers comin in  
On a friend like the oj  
But what about your friends to the end  
Will they run on out like a jeeble  
Or youll find em stickin close to your side  
Like a big bunch of fiends  
Six now the groupies drinkin water  
I get real funny so youd better hide your daughter  
Oh buddy oh pal oh chump friend of mine  
Stayin close like ketchup  
A virgin thats right you call me Bruce Lee right  
For the styles that me kick  
And give me enough respect for this funky remix  
One one thousand two one thousand three one thousand blitz  
Now the rabbit felt blue so I gave the nigga Trix  
Cuz I was his friend wasnt down for the beggin  
You called me a friend were seven about to takin  
Take a tickin keep on lickin why you dippin for the border  
You said youd be down for richer for poorer but  
OyouTKAST aint no change so tlc go head and sang baby  
  
Yo is it me  
L to the EFTEYE a ha ha  
Or can it be I am a little too  
Friendly so to speak hypothetically  
Say I supply creativity to what others  
Must take as a form of selfhate  
Only to make an enemy  
Which results in unfortunate destiny  
They dog me out then be next to me  
Just cause I am what some choose to envy  
  
Brrrrr Ba ba ba  
Back up  
This ya wicked remix  
Come down wicked sing  
Rewind with em aya  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus  
  
People say I act a little funny  
I wouldnt change not for no money  
Ill be a friend as long as youre a friend to me yeah yeah  
Even though I might seem easy  
It dont give you no cause to deceive me
