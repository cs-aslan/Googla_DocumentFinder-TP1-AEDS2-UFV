Free zone workers you working hard everyday  
But all the work you do dont get enough pay  
I mad I still dont know why I still dont know why  
Is minimum wage for your sufferation have no more toleration  
  
Hand to mouth cant work  
Hand to mouth cant work  
Hand to mouth business no it cant work  
School teachers you working hard educating  
But all the work you do they take you for a play thing  
I mad I still dont know why I still dont know why  
Is little bit a pay for your contribution and you mean so much to the nation  
Me say me naah get enough good weh day  
All thema work is like them naah get no pay  
Naah get enough food from weh day  
All the work we work is like we naah get no pay  
Watching everything go up in inflation  
Food price go up and man pay a go down  
Ask some a them  
Them telling short long  
But in a corner we wings and a jam  
Ragga ragga a watch the notion  
Say we naah get no good food from weh day  
Naah sow no good seed from weh day  
Naah sow no good seed from weh day  
Naah get enough food weh day  
Our nurses saving lives everyday  
But all the lives you save you dont get enough pay  
  
I mad I still dont know why  
I still dont know why  
Is little bit a pay for your life savings  
What a grave theyre digging  
Now our farmers them digging hard every day  
But all the food they grow import them a say  
That make me mad that make me mad mad mad mad  
Mad mad mad mad  
  
Is little bit a pay for your mama too and  
Your sister got to shop for two  
Oh civil servants you working hard everyday and  
You sweating out for your pay  
But I man still dont know why  
  
Still dont know why is little bit  
A pay everyday what you got to take away  
Woy woy woy woy woy

Me say me naah get enough good from weh day  
All the talk we talk is like we naah  
Naah get no good yood from weh day all the bawl we bawl  
Say them no hear wha we a say  
Workers a the backbone a the whole island  
Dont treat them right is total confusion  
Cant go no doctor for no medication  
School but no teacher no education  
Pay more dollars to the foundation  
Naah get enough pay from weh day musician a suffer but a play  
Same way engineer a bawl how him pay too small  
Cant build him house with no concrete wall  
Bass man a cry bout him cant get string  
Have the contacts and cant bring them in raggamuffin dj and sing  
  
Lord naah get enough good from weh day  
All the talk we talk is like we naah Lord  
Naah get no good yood from weh day  
All the bawl we bawl say them no hear wha we a say  
Watching everything go up in inflation  
Food price go up and man pay a god down  
Some a them

Ragga ragga deh pon the version  
Ziggy zaggy a watch the movements
