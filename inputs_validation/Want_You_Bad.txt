If you could only read my mind  
You would know that things between us  
Aint right  
I know youre arms are open wide  
But youre a little on the sraight side  
I cant lie  
  
Your one vice  
Is youre too nice  
Come around now cant you see  
  
I want you  
All tattooed  
I want you bad  
  
Complete me  
Mistreat me  
I want you to be bad  
  
If you could only read my mind  
You would know that Ive been waiting  
So long  
For someone almost like you  
But with attitude Im waiting  
So come on  
  
Get out of clothes time  
Grow out those highlights  
Come around now cant you see  
  
I want you  
In a vinyl suit  
I want you bad  
  
Complicated  
Xrated  
I want you bad bad bad bad bad  
Bad  
  
Dont get me wrong  
I know youre only being good  
But thats whats wrong  
I guess I just misunderstood  
  
I want you  
All tattoed  
I want you bad  
  
Complicated  
Xrated  
I want you bad  
  
I mean it  
I need it  
I want you bad bad bad bad bad  
Bad  
Really really bad
