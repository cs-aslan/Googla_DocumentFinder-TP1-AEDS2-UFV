Guess its just the same old story  
Fool I didnt have a chance  
She took me like a house thats burning  
Never gave a second glance  
Eat em up let em go and you never  
Let your feelings show  
She aint here and youre asking why  
Lifes a bitch and then you die  
Come on lover just let go  
  
Is there something I should know  
Was it just one of those nights  
Something you dont remember yeah  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something I dont remember  
Sitting at the bar drinking beer  
Happy hours over and loves cost me dear  
The piano player sits at his stool  
Hes playing Feelings aint life cruel  
Uptown downtown lifes a river  
And I wish I could drown  
  
I could still hear those loving sighs  
A lesson learnt loves just a lie  
I know I made a big mistake  
With love theres no even break  
Theres a price you have to pay  
I got the bill when I heard you say  
  
Was it just one of those nights baby  
Something I dont remember  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something you dont remember  
  
Was it just one of those nights baby  
Something I dont remember  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something I dont remember  
  
Was it just one of those nights baby  
Something I dont remember  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something you dont remember
