All night stand  
Been around seen a thousand places  
All night stand  
Seen a good half a million faces  
  
Because Ive lived this life  
And I made it for myself  
If you scandalize my name  
Then you scandalize yourself  
  
Because Im not to blame  
For the things that Ive been doing  
You all say Im bad  
And Ill only end in ruin  
  
All night stand  
With a different girl each night  
All night stand  
With two hundred miles to ride  
  
But I wont give it up  
As long as I can make the bread  
When I do I shall stop  
Close my eyes and go to bed  
  
And forget all this night  
And all the people on my back  
Once Im free from these chains  
I aint never looking back  
  
All night stand  
Been around seen a million faces yeah  
All night stand  
Seen a good half a million places yeah  
  
All night stand  
Cant get these people off my back  
All night stand  
Ten percent for this and that  
  
All night stand  
All night stand
