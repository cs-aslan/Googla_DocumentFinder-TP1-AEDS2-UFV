Deaths pointed at your head  
Your mind on the trigger pull it  
Bludgeon bodies give up their muted horror story  
Scene of your rage  
Death is not strange  
Blood on the walls  
You stand alone satisfied  
  
Ill wake the silence in you  
Ill shoot the violence through you  
  
Terrified by the thought that you are all alone  
Paralyzed by the fact that you are not alone  
Youre losing your mind Im losing control  
Youre losing your mind as I bury your world  
  
Ill wake the silence in you  
Ill shoot the violence through you  
  
I cant remember yet someone always seems to die  
You are the reason why I became the chosen one  
Ive got the right  
God makes no sense  
Ive got the right  
I feel my back against the wall  
  
Deaths pointed at your head  
Your mind on the trigger pull it  
Bludgeon bodies give up their muted horror story  
  
Scene of my rage  
Scene of my rage  
Death is your name  
Youre facing your grave  
  
I taste your tears caress your face  
I watch you lie insane  
Dying for love  
Praying to die  
  
I want whats inside you  
Dressed in your blood  
You wear it well  
Dying because I care  
  
Your eyes are wide but you cant see  
Rotting my lust away  
Ill shoot the violence through you  
And wake the part thats dead  
I hate the silence in you  
I want whats in your head
