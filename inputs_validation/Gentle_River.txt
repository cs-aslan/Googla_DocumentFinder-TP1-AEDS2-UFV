Ive lived a life full of sorrow  
With no where to run or to hide  
Happiness youll see is borrowed  
All I want is you by my side  
  
Chorus  
Gentle river take me away  
to the time of happier days  
All I need is love and company  
Gentle river bring him back to me  
  
You can spend all your time acryin  
Listen here I dont need your sympathy  
Cause Ive made my life to live it  
All I need is you here with me  
  
Chorus  
  
Gentle river bring em back to me
