Excuse me for this  
I just want a kiss  
I just want to know what it feels like to touch  
Something so pure  
Something Im so sure of  
What it feels like to stand outside your door  
Im unworthy  
I can see youre above me  
But I can be lovely given the chance  
  
Dont move  
I want to remember you just like this  
Dont move  
Its only a breath or two between our lips  
  
Chorus  
I know why you left  
I cant blame you myself  
Must be hard living with ghosts and such an empty shell  
I tried to warn you  
Ive been a mess since youve known me  
I cant promise forever  
But Im working on it  
If I cant hold you  
Can I give you a kiss  
  
Can I have a kiss  
  
I see that youre torn  
Ive got some scars of my own  
Seems I want what I know is gonna leave me hungry  
  
Dont move  
I need to remember you just like this  
  
Chorus  
  
Can I  
  
All I have  
All I can give to you I will  
Just promise this  
If I cant have forever  
Can I have a kiss kiss kiss  
No  
  
Chorus  
  
Can I give you a kiss  
Can I can I  
Can I have a kiss
