It was too hot to thing us sweeping tossing and turning  
Waiting for a girl like you feeling lonely  
I am lost in the sea of love Its only you that I am  
Thinking how  
I dont know what I would do if I had to live my life  
Without you  
  
Oh I wish it was a magic night So we can dance to the  
Morning light  
Moving together body and soul Body and soul under the  
Stars  
Oh I wish this was a magic night So we can dance into  
The morning light  
Moving together body and soul body and soul  
  
What wonderful moments we had moments of passion  
Never thought Id ever be live so lonely  
I am lost in the sea of love Its only you that I am  
Thinking how  
I dont know what I would do if I have to live my life  
Without you  
  
Oh I wish it was a magic night So we can dance to the  
Morning light  
Moving together body and soul Body and soul under the  
Stars  
Oh I wish this was a magic night So we can dance into  
The morning light  
Moving together body and soul body and soul
