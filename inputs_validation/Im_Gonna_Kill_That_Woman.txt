Yeah my baby left me this morning  
And I dont care now I dont care what the people say  
  
Yeah I did everything that I could everything I could  
Lord knows I did everything I could  
I tried to satisfy her worried mind thats what I did  
  
You know she was nothing but trouble trouble  
She keep me worried all the time  
God knows her movements are killing me  
  
Yeah my baby stayed out all night long all night long  
She keep me worried all the time  
  
Yeah I lay down last night I was thinking  
Must I kill that woman Must I kill that woman  
Oh Lord I get down on my knees  
They tell me God forgivin everything you do  
But I dont care what the people say  
Im gonna kill that woman  
Im gonna kill that woman God knows  
Im gonna get down on my knees
