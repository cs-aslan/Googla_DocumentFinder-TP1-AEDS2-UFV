Christmas Day is getting closer but theres sadness mixed with joy  
Every day a few more questions from our little girl and boy  
Not alone but theyll be lonely for their daddy wont be here  
And just like the air at Christmas therell be a chill upon the chill  
Christmas without daddy will be such a lonesome day  
Well send a prayer and all our love to you so far away  
Your son just wrote to Santa asked him to send you home  
Yes Christmas without daddy well be blue and all alone  
 steel   
Christmas without daddy I dont know what were gonna do  
On the present from your baby she wrote daddy I love you  
Your son just wrote to Santa asking him to send you home  
Yes Christmas without daddy well be blue and all alone
