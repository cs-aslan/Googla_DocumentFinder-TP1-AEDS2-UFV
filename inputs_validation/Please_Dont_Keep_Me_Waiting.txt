I want to love you once again  
Couldnt you love me too  
Dont turn away from all that weve been through  
Everyone changes be my friend  
Havent you got the time  
Help me I need you throw me down a line  
  
Please dont keep me waiting  
I cant hold on much longer  
Please dont keep me waiting  
I cant love you any stronger  
Please dont keep me waiting  
I cant take this kind of pain  
Take me back in your arms once again  
  
Living on dreams from yesterday  
Waking and youre not here  
I want to see your face  
I want you near  
Now is the moment we must live  
You cant run and hide  
I know you want me too  
Down deep inside  
  
Please dont keep me waiting  
I cant hold on much longer  
Please dont keep me waiting  
I cant love you any stronger  
Please dont keep me waiting  
I cant take this kind of pain  
Take me back in your arms once again  
  
Please dont keep me waiting  
I cant hold on much longer  
Please dont keep me waiting  
I cant love you any stronger  
Please dont keep me waiting  
I cant take this kind of pain  
Take me back in your arms once again
