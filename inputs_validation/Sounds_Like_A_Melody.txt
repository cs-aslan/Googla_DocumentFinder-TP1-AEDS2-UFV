Its a trick of my mind  
Two faces bathing in the screen light  
Shes so soft and warm in my arms  
I tune it into the scene  
My hands are resting on her shoulders  
When were dancing away for a while  
Oh were moving were falling  
We step into the fire  
By the hour of the wolf in a midnight dream  
Theres no reason to hurry  
Just start that brand new story  
Set it alight were head over heels in love  
Head over heels  
The ringing of your laughter  
It sounds like a melody  
To once forbidden places  
Well go for a while  
  
Its the definite show  
Our shadows resting in the moonlight  
Its so clear and bright in your eyes  
Its the touch of your sighs  
My lips are resting on your shoulder  
When were moving so soft and slow  
We need the ecstasy the jealousy  
The comedy of love  
Like the Cary Grants and Kellys once before  
Give me more tragedy more harmony  
And fantasy my dear  
And set it alight just starting that satellite  
Set it alight  
  
The ringing of your laughter  
It sounds like a melody  
To once forbidden places  
Well go for a while
