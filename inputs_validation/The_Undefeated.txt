I was gently raised  
Fussed over r in school  
Fed and housed and entertained  
Wanting to be cool  
Summers in the grass  
Winters warm and slow  
Until the one thing on my mind was to just  
Get up and go  
  
Were the undefeated  
We got what they want  
Were so bored and spoiled  
Life is just a bag of pot  
Were the undefeated  
TV in the shade  
Girls at all our parties  
We have really got it made  
  
Theres a real mean world outside  
Where many lives are lost  
But struggle builds character  
And we are growing soft  
I dont want to sit and watch no TV show  
I want to roam and be challenged  
I want to grow and grow  
  
Were the undefeated  
We got what they want  
Were so fucking spoiled  
Life is just a bag of pot  
Were the undefeated  
TV in the shade  
Girls at all our parties  
We have really got it made  
What have we made  
A giant jail  
A bunch of walls  
Thats all that weve made  
Oh my  
  
Were the undefeated we got what they want  
Were so bored and spoiled life is just a bag of pot  
Were the undefeated we got what they want  
Were so bored and spoiled life is just a bag of pot  
  
Were the undefeated  
Always undefeated  
Were the undefeated  
Were the undefeated  
Now
