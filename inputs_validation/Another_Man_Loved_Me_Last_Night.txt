He doesnt know that I cant look him in the eyes  
For that I cant speak or Ill start tellin lies  
I hope he thinks that Im just moody and quiet  
But another man loved me last night  
Yes another man loved me last night  
Id almost forgotten what love was really like  
But Im only human only a woman  
I let another man love me last night  
While hes sleepin well Im cryin here awake  
Not being loved was more than I could take  
Though it was wrong there in his arms it seemed so right  
When another man loved me last night  
Yes another man loved me last night  
Id almost forgotten what love was really like  
But Im only human only a woman  
I let another man love me last night
