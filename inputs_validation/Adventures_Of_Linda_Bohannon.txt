In a town about the size of a truckstop or bigger  
Lived Linda Bohannon a natural queen  
She lived with her folks in a little white farmhouse  
She helped out by hoeing the corn and the beans  
Sometimes she would stare at herself in a mirror  
And any would say there was much to admire  
Every turn of the curve of her body was flawless  
From pretty white teeth to her shiny blond hair  
One day as she stood by the road leading westward  
In blue jeans and tshirt and mailorder boots  
The tractors and trailers and pickups saw Linda  
The drivers all slowed down to holler and hoot  
They received not a smile from miss Linda Bohannon  
No bag and no brush did she hold in her hand  
Just Linda Bohannon a physical treasure  
Stepped into a lightblue Mercedes Benz  
And this is one of those times  
That we wish we knew the missing parts to these stories  
But this is all we know  
She was missing a week and her parents were worried  
She called Sunday morning and said Im okay  
Well Bohannons dont talk much but we found out later  
She called from a movie stars house in LA  
Shes home now and been here for six years or seven  
She brought home a baby a finelooking lad  
Well Bohannons dont talk much and Linda dont either  
And nobody told us a thing about his dad  
Well shes pretty as ever and she works in a gift shop  
Looks after her boy and she dont ask for help  
She watches the reruns of an old TV western  
And the boy looks a lot like a rerun himself
