Lets hit the road and throw out the map  
Wherever we go we wont look back  
Cause were going places and were going there fast  
And lets move to Paris and get ourselves a loft  
Lets live in squalor and spend all cost  
Lets throw caution to the wind and start over again  
  
Think how many doors well open  
Just as many stars are shining  
Who knows where were going  
Yeah who knows what well find  
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you  
  
Lets hike in the mountains and challenge our will  
Lets leap over canyons and get lost in the hills  
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you  
  
Think how many doors well open  
Just as many stars are sure to shine  
Who knows where were going  
And who knows what well find  
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you  
  
All of our plans will be at sea  
The sum of all our failures they cannot hurt us now  
Lets hoist up ourselves  
And shove off to China and climb up a wall  
Well keep on climbing looking over it all  
Laughing it up yeah having a ball  
  
Think how many doors well open  
Just as many stars are going to shine  
Who knows where were going  
And who knows what well find  
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you  
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you
