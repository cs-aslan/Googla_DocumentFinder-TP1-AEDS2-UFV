I done cried a river of tears  
This you may not believe  
But Ive been crying for five long years  
Afraid of all my fears  
  
Love has got me now  
In a terrible bet  
I done lost the best little woman  
That I ever had  
  
So direct Me  
Straight to my babys love  
Direct Me  
Straight to my womans love  
  
Shame on me shame on me  
I made a big mistake  
When I see my babe again  
Im gonna bake me her favorite cake  
  
Ten thousand dollar reward  
For the first the one that finds her  
When I get my hands on her yall  
Im gonna just chain and bound her  
  
Somebody direct Me  
Straight to my babys love  
Direct Me  
Straight to my womans love ou ou  
  
Deputy sheriff On your trail  
The FBI I know  
They wont fail they cant fail  
They gonna bring you back  
  
Somebody direct Me  
Straight to my babys love  
Direct Me  
Straight to that womans love
