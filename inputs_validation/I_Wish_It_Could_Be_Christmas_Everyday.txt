When the snowman brings us snow  
Well he just might like to know  
Hes put a great big smile on someone elses face  
If you jump into your bed  
Quickly cover up your head  
Dont you lock the doors  
You know that sweet Santa Claus in on the way  
  
Well I wish it could be Christmas every day  
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play  
Oh I wish it could be Christmas every day  
Let the bells ring out for Christmas  
  
When were skating in the park  
If the snow cloud makes it dark  
Then your rosy cheeks gonna light my merry way  
Now the frosty paws appear  
And theyve frozen up my beard  
So well lie by the fire  
Til the heat simply melts em all away  
  
Well I wish it could be Christmas every day  
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play  
Oh I wish it could be Christmas every day  
So let the bells ring out for Christmas  
  
When the snowman brings the snow when the snowman brings the snow  
Well he just might like to know well he just might like to know  
Hes put a great big smile on somebodys face  
So if Santa brings that sleigh Santa brings that sleigh  
All along the Milky Way along the Milky Way  
Ill sign my name on the rroftop in the snow  
Then he may decide to stay  
  
Well I wish it could be Christmas every day  
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play  
Oooh I wish it could be Christmas every day  
So let the bells ring out for Christmas  
  
Okay you lot  take it  
  
Well I wish it could be Christmas every day Christmas day  
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play Ohoh  
Oh I wish it could be Christmas every day  
Let the bells ring out for Christmas  
  
Why dont you give your love for Christmas  
  
When the snowman brings the snow  
When the snowman brings the snow  
When the snowman brings the snow  
When the snowman brings the snow  
When the snowman brings the snow  
When the snowman brings the snow
