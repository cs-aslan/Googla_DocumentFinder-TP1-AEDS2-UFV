Healing rain is coming down  
Its coming nearer to this old town  
Rich and poor weak and strong  
Its bringing mercy it wont be long  
Healing rain is coming down  
Its coming closer to the lost and found  
Tears of joy and tears of shame  
Are washed forever in Jesus name  
  
Chorus  
Healing rain it comes with fire  
So let it fall and take us higher  
Healing rain Im not afraid  
To be washed in Heavens rain  
  
Lift your heads let us return  
To the mercy seat where time began  
And in your eyes I see the pain  
Come soak this dry heart with healing rain  
And only you the son of man  
Can take a leper and let him stand  
So lift your hands they can be held  
By someone greater the Great I Am  
  
Chorus  
  
Healing rain is falling down  
Healing rain is falling down  
Im not afraid  
Im not afraid
