Oh Eve where is Adam  
I see youve been kept  
Out of the garden  
And I said  
Oh Eve where is Adam  
Now youve been kept  
Out of the garden  
I have wandered from shore to shore  
Dont you find that theres no more  
Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
  
Dont you wish  
Love alone  
Dont you wish  
Love  
Dont you wish  
Love alone  
Dont you wish  
Love  
Dont you wish love alone  
Could save the world from disaster  
Is only love inner confusion  
Is it just one more illusion  
And I said  
Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
  
Well if you want to have great love  
Youve got to have great anger  
Well if you want to have great love  
Youve got to have great anger  
When I see innocent folks shot down  
Should I just shake my head and frown  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
  
Girl if you want to hit the target square  
Youve gotta look out for it not happening there  
Or else itll be just one more time  
The correction creates another crime  
Girl if you want to hit the target square  
You better not have right angles  
Oh just keep one more time  
For the correction creates another crime  
  
Oh Eve you tell Adam  
Next time he asks you  
You say baby its cold outside  
Whats the password  
To come inside  
You say  
Pacem in terres me shanti shalom haywah  
  
Oh Eve go tell Adam  
Weve got to build a new garden  
Oh Eve go tell Adam  
Weve got to build a new garden  
Got to get working on a building  
A decent home for all of gods children  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
  
Well if music  
Could only bring peace  
Id only be a musician  
Well if music  
Could only bring peace  
Id only be a musician  
Well if songs could do more than  
Dull this pain  
And all melodies bravely changed well  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
Four thousand languages in this world  
Doesnt mean the same thing  
To every boy and girl  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
  
save the world from disaster  
Well if only love  
well I sad  
just one more illusion  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah
