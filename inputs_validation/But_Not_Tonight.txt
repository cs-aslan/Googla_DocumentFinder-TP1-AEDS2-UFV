Oh God its raining  
But Im not complaining  
Its filling me up  
With new life  
  
The stars in the sky  
Bring tears to my eyes  
Theyre lighting my way  
Tonight  
  
And I havent felt so alive  
In years  
  
Just for a day  
On a day like today  
Ill get away from this  
Constant debauchery  
  
The wind in my hair  
Makes me so aware  
How good it is to live  
Tonight  
  
And I havent felt so alive  
In years  
  
The moon  
Is shining in the sky  
Reminding me  
Of so many other nights  
But theyre not like tonight  
  
Oh God its raining  
And Im not containing  
My pleasure at being  
So wet  
  
Here on my own  
All on my own  
How good it feels to be alone  
Tonight  
  
And I havent felt so alive  
In years  
  
The moon  
Is shining in the sky  
Reminding me  
Of so many other nights  
When my eyes have been so red  
Ive been mistaken for dead  
But not tonight
