She wasnt a fool  
That glittering girl  
She followed the rules  
That shimmering pearl  
  
Said the rules mama preaches  
Go down when they break  
The themes mama teaches  
You just gotta shake  
  
But she wasnt a fool  
That slender love figure  
She followed her rules  
And made money bigger  
  
She wasnt a fool  
That shining young woman  
She followed her rules  
Shes crying for no man  
  
Said the rules mama preaches  
Go down when theyre broken  
She explodes into peaches  
And cries when Ive spoken  
  
She wasnt a fool  
That goddess of hell  
There are no mothers rules  
She makes them herself  
  
And I was down upon my knees  
To beg her surrender up to me  
  
Something inside her  
Told her she shouldnt  
Tried and alight her  
But the girl wouldnt  
  
She wasnt a fool  
But love flowed from her face  
Shes not scared of me  
Shes afraid of disgrace  
  
She wasnt a fool  
That female for our world  
She followed her rules  
That glittering girl x4
