I was thrilled to death the day that Babe Ruth signed my baseball bat  
I always remember that the greatest one of all  
When I was out in Hollywood John Wayne tipped his cowboy hat  
And when I got his autograph I felt ten feet tall  
I met the great Hank Williams one night backstage at the Opy House  
He look down and grinned when I said Im your biggest fan  
And I was there the day when JFK rode into Dallas  
I walked up to the limousine and shook his mighty hand  
Ive met the famous and Ive met the best  
But there one man Ive never met that outshines all the rest  
And Hes one man I always wanted to meet  
He is the King of Kings and Hes the Prince of peace  
If I ever get the chance Ill fall down at His feet  
Hes one man I always wanted to meet  
Jesus is the man I always wanted to meet
