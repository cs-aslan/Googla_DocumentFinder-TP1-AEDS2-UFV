You C C Rider see what you done done  
C C Rider you see what you done done  
You C C Rider you see what you done done  
You done made me love you and now your man done come  
  
My home is on the water I dont like no land at all  
Homes on the water and I dont like no land at all  
My homes on the water and I dont like no land at all  
Id rather be dead than to stay here and be your dog  
  
So you C C Rider see what you done done  
C C Rider you see what you done done  
You C C Rider you see what you done done  
You done made me love you and now your man done come
