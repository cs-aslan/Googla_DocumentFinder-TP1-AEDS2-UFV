The urge to take you grows more strong  
For time had made me wait too long  
Each watch I smash apart  
Just adding to my power  
Each watch I smash apart  
Just bringing near the hour  
Of twentyfive oclock  thats when youre going to be mine  
Twentyfive oclock well be together till the end of time  
At twentyfive oclock  
  
The ticking seconds  hear them call  
My spell of hours will make you fall  
Each timer that I break  
Will halt the flowing sands  
Each timer that I break  
Will put you in my hands  
At twentyfive oclock  thats when youre going to be mine  
Twentyfive oclock well be together till the end of time  
At twentyfive oclock  
  
Each watch I smash apart  
Just adding to my power  
Each watch I smash apart  
Just bringing near the hour  
Of twentyfive oclock
