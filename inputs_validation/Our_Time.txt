I may be dead honey  
But I was left with my eyes  
And underneath sugar  
Well Ive been stung by your lies  
  
And my heart baby  
Is cold and blue  
Were two of a kind baby  
Me and You  
  
Its our time sweet babe  
To break on through  
  
Its the year to be hated  
So glad that we made it  
Cause all the kids in the street  
Whisper sounds that sweet  
The stars under their feet  
Well its the year to be hated  
  
One two ready go  
Its our time our time our time our time  
Its our time our time our time our time  
To be hated  
All right  
To be hated  
  
Come on kids  
Its our time our time our time our time  
Its our time our time our time our time  
To be hated  
All right  
Well its the year to be hated
