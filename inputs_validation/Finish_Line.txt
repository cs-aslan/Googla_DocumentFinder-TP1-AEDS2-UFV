Wind blows snow outside my windows  
Crowd below runs wild in the streets  
Two rented brothers race down two separate alleys  
Heading for the finish line  
  
Down in the train yard out by the stockyard  
Butchers with aprons hack meat in the snow  
Blood has the brothers pulsing with envy  
Heading for the finish line  
  
Two rented brothers Their faces keep changing  
Just like these feelings I have for you  
And nothings forever not even five minutes  
When youre headed for the finish line  
  
Down in the depot out by the meat rack  
Down by the tunnels surrounding the jail  
Prisoners are marching in squares and in circles  
Theyre heading for the finish line  
  
Theyre lining up for Noahs Ark  
Theyre stabbing each other in the dark  
Saluting a flag made of some rich guys socks  
Heading for the finish line  
  
Close to the line the ice is cracking  
Two rented feelings sitting in the stands  
Two mothers two fathers and both of them are paid for  
All of a sudden it comes back to me  
  
Just up ahead is the finish line  
Two rented referees and two checkered rags  
Out of the corner of my eye comes a  
Dark horse with black wings  
Headed for the finish line  
  
Im five years old the room is fuzzy  
I think theres also a very young girl  
Its hard to remember what happened exactly  
As Im staring at the finish line  
First came fire then came light  
Then came feeling then cane sight
