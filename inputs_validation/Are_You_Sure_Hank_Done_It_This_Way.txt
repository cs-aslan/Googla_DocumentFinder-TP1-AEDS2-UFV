Lord its the same old tune fiddle and guitar  
Where do we take it from here  
Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars  
Its been the same way for years  
We made the change  
  
Somebody told us when we came to Nashville  
Boys you really got it made  
Old Hank made it here were all sure that you will  
But I dont think Hank done it this away  
I dont think Hank done it this away nah  
  
Been years on the road working one night stands  
Speeding my young life away  
Yeah tell me one more time just so Ill understand  
Are you sure Hank done it this away  
Did Ol Hank really do it this away  
  
Yeah Ive seen the world with a four piece band  
Looking sidways at me  
Singing our songs want to hear us now and then  
But I dont think Hank done em this away  
No I dont think Hank done em this away yeah  
  
No I dont think Hank done em this away  
  
Yeah I dont think Hank done em this away
