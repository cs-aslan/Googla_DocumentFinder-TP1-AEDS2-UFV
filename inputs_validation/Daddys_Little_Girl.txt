Im thinking back two three years ago  
Thought of making you go eat  
Those words you said  
To me to me to me  
  
Watch you undress  
Youre hysterical  
I might be giving you the money  
But today  
Forgive me  
  
Daddys little girl  
Doesnt like the way I talk  
Shes a spoiled little girl  
Gonna have to cut her off  
Because thats the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I dont know when love is real  
Daddys little girl  
Shes so nasty in the sack  
Shes a crazy little girl  
Gonna have it coming back  
Because thats the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I dont know why love is not enough  
  
I wish that I was invisible  
Maybe then youd never see me run away  
And I must confess  
I feel terrible  
But lets not listen to  
Those voices inside of me  
  
Daddys little girl  
Doesnt like the way I talk  
Shes a spoiled little girl  
Gonna have to cut her off  
Because thats the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I dont know when love is real  
Daddys little girl  
Shes so nasty in the sack  
Shes a crazy little girl  
Gonna have it coming back  
Because thats the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I dont know why love is not enough  
  
A poster child of what we are  
Your hand your keys  
Your brand new car  
The love we share the melody  
The life you lead  
Daddys little girl  
  
Daddys little girl  
Doesnt like the way I talk  
Shes a spoiled little girl  
Gonna have to cut her off  
Because thats the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I dont know when love is real  
Daddys little girl  
Shes so nasty in the sack  
Shes a crazy little girl  
Gonna have it coming back  
Because thats the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I dont know why love is not enough  
  
Daddys little girl  
Throwing money all around  
You had everything girl  
I hope I never see your face around this town
