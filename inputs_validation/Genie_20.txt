I feel like Ive been locked up tight  
A century of lonely nights  
Waiting waiting for someone  
  
Youre licking your lips  
And blowing kisses my way  
That dont mean Im gonna give it away  
Baby oh baby  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby theres a price to pay  
Im a genie in a bottle  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
The musics playin  
And the lights down low  
One more dance and then were good to go  
Waitin waitin for someone  
  
My hormones racin at the speed of light  
But that dont mean its gotta be tonight  
Baby ooh baby  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby theres a price to pay  
Im a genie in a bottle  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
If you wanna be with me  
I can make your wish come true  
Gotta make a big impression  
Gotta like what you do  
Gotta like what you do  
Gotta like what you do  
  
Im a genie in a bottle baby  
Im a genie in a bottle baby  
  
Come on come on come on and let me out  
Come on come on come on and let me out  
Come on come on come on and let me out  
Come on come on come on and let me out  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby theres a price to pay  
Im a genie in a bottle  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
If you wanna be with me  
I can make your wish come true  
You gotta make a big impression  
Gotta like what you do  
  
Im a genie in a bottle baby  
Im a genie in a bottle baby  
  
Come on come on come on and let me out  
Come on come on come on and let me out  
My heart is sayin no  
Come on come on come on and let me out  
My heart is sayin no  
  
Come on come on come on and let me out  
My heart is sayin no  
Come on come on come on and let me out  
My bodys sayin lets go  
Come on come on come on and let me out
