Well how much blues do you use  
Before you use it up  
And how many fools take a chance  
Before they hit it lucky  
Tomorrows want to be the day  
It never seem to work that way  
  
Chorus  
Whats up with that  
Whats up with that  
Whats up with that  
Whats up with that  
  
Everybody want a little more  
Than they think they got  
But what you might think it is  
Might really not be baby  
Pick it up or leave it lay  
It always seem to slip away  
  
Chorus  
  
Now how high will a river get  
Before it overflows  
And how long is the hole to China  
It dont really know  
This is what its all about  
Theres always gonna be a doubt  
  
Chorus
