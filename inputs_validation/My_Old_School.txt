I remember the thirtyfive sweet goodbyes  
When you put me on the Wolverine  
Up to Annandale  
It was still September  
When your daddy was quite surprised  
To find you with the working girls  
In the county jail  
I was smoking with the boys upstairs  
When I heard about the whole affair  
I said oh no  
William and Mary wont do  
  
Chorus  
Well I did not think the girl  
Could be so cruel  
And Im never going back  
To my old school  
  
Oleanders growing outside her door  
Soon theyre gonna be in bloom  
Up in Annandale  
I cant stand her  
Doing what she did before  
Living like a gypsy queen  
In a fairy tale  
Well I hear the whistle but I cant go  
Im gonna take her down to Mexico  
She said oh no  
Guadalajara wont do  
  
Chorus  
  
California tumbles into the sea  
Thatll be the day I go  
Back to Annandale  
Tried to warn you  
About Chino and Daddy Gee  
But I cant seem to get to you  
Through the US Mail  
Well I hear the whistle but I cant go  
Im gonna take her down to Mexico  
She said oh no  
Guadalajara wont do  
  
Chorus
