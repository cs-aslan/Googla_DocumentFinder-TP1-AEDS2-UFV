I cant see my feelings  
Open my eyes  
I cant see my feelings  
Open a pair of eyes  
I cant see my feelings  
Keep them behind  
I just keep on reeling  
Running back down the line  
Oh I cant stand that screaming  
Dont even try  
Music fans some feelings  
Itll be tell me why  
I cant stop that feeling  
Showing me why  
Man I love that feeling  
Yeah blowin me right through the sky  
Oh hey hey hey hey hey hey  
Oh listen to what she says  
If its good its nice
