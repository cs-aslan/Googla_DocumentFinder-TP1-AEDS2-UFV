I live in an apartment on the ninetyninth floor  of my block  
And I sit at home looking out the window  
Imagining the world has stopped  
Then in flies a guy whos all dressed up  like a Union Jack  
And says Ive won five pounds if I have his  kind of detergent pack  
  
Chorus  
I says Hey You Get off of my cloud  
Hey You Get off of my cloud  
Hey You Get off of my cloud  
Dont hang around cause twos a crowd  
On my cloud baby  
  
The telephone is ringing  
I say Hi its me Who is there on the line  
A voice says Hi hello how are you  
Well I guess Im doin fine  
He says Its three am theres too much noise  
Dont you people ever want to go to bed  
Just cause you feel so good  
Do you have to drive me out of my head   
  
Chorus  
  
I was sick and tired fed up with this  
And decided to take a drive downtown  
It was so very quiet and peaceful  
There was nobody not a soul around  
I laid myself out I was so tired  
And I started to dream  
In the morning the parking tickets were just  like a flag stuck on my window
screen  
  
ChorusRepeat x2
