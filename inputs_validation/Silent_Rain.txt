He is God and he is light  
He means everything in life  
To her awaking mind  
Hes the one of two she loves  
Hes the one of two she snogs and hugs  
In blind faith  
  
But in the recent dead of nights  
There was wonder there was fright  
Daddys coming for a secret playing  
Secret playing  
  
Silent giants  
Silent rain  
Silence covers shame  
Lying colours  
Lurking bane  
Under the silent rain  
  
Daddy told her not to speak  
Not to wail and not to weep  
A promise she wont keep  
Saw her mother at the door  
Staring craven to the core  
She wont care no more  
  
So in the endless coming years  
There was sorrow there was fears  
Daddys coming for a secret playing  
Secret playing  
  
Silent giants  
Silent pain  
Silence covers shame  
Lying colours  
Lurking Bane  
Under the silent rain
