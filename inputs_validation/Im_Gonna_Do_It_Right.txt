Waitin for the night to fade  
Here on a foreign shore  
And all Ive done is run away  
Like too many nights before  
  
Its taken far too long  
To make my world my own  
Im gonna try  
Cause this time round  
Ive made my mind up  
  
Chorus  
If I think about leavin  
Im gonna do it right alright  
N if Im thinkon about holdin on  
Im gonna do it right  
  
Never been known to lie to me  
Aint gonna start in now  
Ive never been one for hide and seek  
So whats all this endless doubt about  
  
I know just what Ill do  
Ive got to make my move  
N Ill be fine  
Cause this time round  
Ive made my mind up  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont matter what you do  
Just get to doin  
Itll come to you  
  
No more maybe  
No more baby  
No more save me  
  
And if I want to live my life  
I gotta get it up to do it right  
And if I want to feel alright  
Gotta shed a little light on me tonight  
  
Oh hold on hold on  
  
Chorus x2
