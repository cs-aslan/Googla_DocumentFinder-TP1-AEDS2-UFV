April is a cruel time  
Even though the sun may shine  
And world looks in the shade as it slowly comes away  
Still falls the April rain  
And the valleys filled with pain  
And you cant tell me quite why  
As I look up to the gray sky  
Where it should be blue  
Grey sky where I should see you  
Ask why why it should be so  
Ill cry say that I dont know  
  
Baby once in a while Ill forget and Ill smile  
But then the feeling comes again of an April without end  
Of an April lonely as a girl  
In the dark of my mind I can see all too fine  
But there is nothing to be done when I just cant feel the sun  
And the springtimes the season of the night  
  
Grey sky where it should be blue  
Grey sky where I should see you  
Ask why why it should be so  
Ill cry say that I dont know  
I dont know
