Understand this Im not looking  
For true love tonight  
If you wanna be my little baby  
You can meet me in the pale moonlight  
  
Ive been working everyday eight to nine and  
Servin coke and fries at the movie blue drivein  
If you want me you know where to find me  
  
I can be your one time baby  
I can be your little dairy queen  
I dont wanna care tonight I dont wanna fight  
You dont have to give me anything  
Just put your sweet kiss kiss on my lips now baby  
  
Understand this Ive been liking  
You since I was small  
I dont wanna get you running scared  
When theres no pressure there at all  
  
Ive been working eight to nine everyday and  
Think about you almost all the time all the time and  
If I want to see you I drive by  
  
I can be your one time baby  
I can be your little dairy queen  
I dont wanna care tonight I dont wanna fight  
You dont have to give me anything  
Just put your sweet kiss kiss on my lips now baby

Why are you so mean  
When you gonna ditch that stupid bitch  
You got its me you should be seeing

Fantasy about yous like a goldmine goldmine  
Asking everybody is he mine is he mine  
Not quite yet but Im gonna get get him  
Not quite yet but Im gonna get get him  
  
I can be your one time baby  
I can be your little dairy queen  
I dont wanna care tonight I dont wanna fight  
You dont have to give me anything  
Just put your sweet kiss kiss on my lips now baby
