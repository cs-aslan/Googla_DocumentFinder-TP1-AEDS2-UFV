Special Markets  
It wasnt the queen of diamonds that I drew first  
Instead I got the ace of spades reversed  
She quit me  
She up and quit me manyeah  
She quit me  
She up and she quit me  
It wasnt because I didnt treat her rightno  
When dawn had drawn the curtains of the night  
She quit me  
She up and she quit me man  
She quit me  
She up and quit meyeah  
It wasnt because I didnt treat her kind  
I wonder who put leaving on her mind  
She quit me  
She up and she quit me man  
She quit me  
She up and quit meyeah  
It wasnt because I couldnt satisfyno  
Now whered she get the nerve to say goodbye  
Oh she quit me  
She up and quit me manoh yeah  
She quit me  
She up and quit meyeah
