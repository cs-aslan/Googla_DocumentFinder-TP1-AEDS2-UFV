I was grinding through my day gig  
Stackin cutouts at the Strand  
When in walks Franny from NYU  
We were quite an item back then  
  
We talked about her films and shows and CDs  
And I dont know what else  
She said yeah Hollywoods been good to me  
But tell me how about yourself  
  
Chorus  
Im still working on that novel  
But Im just about to quit  
Cause Im worrying about the future now  
Or maybe this is it  
Its not all that I thought it would be  
What a shame about me  
  
She said talk to me do you ever see  
Anybody else from our old crew  
Bobby Dakine won the Bunsen Prize  
Now hes coming out with something new  
  
Alan owns a chain of Steamer Heavens  
And Barry is the software king  
And somebody told me in the early 80s  
You were gonna be the next big thing  
  
Chorus  
  
Well now that was just a rumor  
But I guess Im doin fine  
Three weeks out of the rehab  
Living one day at a time  
Sneaking up on the new century  
What a shame about me  
  
What a shame about me  
Im thinking of a major Jane Street sunrise  
And the goddess on the fire escape was you  
  
We both ran out of small talk  
The connection seemed to go dead  
I was about to say hey have a nice life  
When she touched my hand and said  
  
You know I just had this great idea  
This could be very cool  
Why dont we grab a cab to my hotel  
And make believe were back at our old school  
  
Chorus  
  
I said babe you look delicious  
And youre standing very close  
But like this is Lower Broadway  
And youre talking to a ghost  
Take a good look its easy to see  
What a shame about me  
What a shame about me
