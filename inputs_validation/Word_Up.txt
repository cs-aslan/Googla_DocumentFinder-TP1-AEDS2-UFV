Yo pretty ladies around the world  
Got a weird thing to show you  
So tell all the boys and girls  
Tell your brother your sister and your mamma too  
Were about to go down  
And you know just what to do  
Wave your hands in the air like you dont care  
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare  
Do your dance do your dance do your dance quick mama  
Come on baby tell me whats the word  
  
Word up up up everybody say  
When you hear the call youve got to get it on the way  
Word up up up its the code word  
No matter where you say it you know that youll be heard  
  
Now all you sucker DJs who think youre fly  
Theres got to be a reason and we know the reason why  
You try to put on those airs and act real cool  
But you got to realize that youre acting like fools  
If theres music we can use it  
Be free to dance  
We dont have the time for psychological romance  
No romance no romance no romance for me mama  
Come on baby tell me whats the word  
  
Word up up up everybody say  
When you hear the call youve got to get it on the way  
Word up up up its the code word  
No matter where you say it you know that youll be heard  
  
Word up up up everybody say  
When you hear the call youve got to get it on the way  
Word up up up its the code word  
No matter where you say it you know that youll be heard  
  
Word up up up everybody say  
When you hear the call youve got to get it on the way  
Word up up up its the code word  
No matter where you say it you know that youll be heard
