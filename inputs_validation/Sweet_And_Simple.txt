Try and keep it simple  
Not too far away  
Movin slow so simple  
  
Never felt this way  
  
Movin sweet so simple  
Takin time to say  
The way to being to being simple  
Never felt this way  
  
Dont be lonely  
Oh my friends forget the past  
Sweet as sugar  
When youre movin  
When youre movin slow at last  
Its what I like to do  
  
How could it be so simple  
To forget the way  
A way to being to being simple  
Never felt this way  
  
Dont be lonely  
No no no forget the past  
Sweet as sugar  
When youre movin slow  
Your movin slow at last  
Its what I like to do  
Its what I like to do  
Its what I like to do  
Its what I like to do  
Dont be lonely lonely lonely  
Its what I like to do  
  
Sweet as sugar sugar sugar  
Its what I like to do  
Its what I like to do  
Movin slow movin slow at last  
Its what I like to do  
Its what I like to do  
Dont be lonely lonely lonely  
Its what I like to do  
Its what I like to do  
Sweet as sugar
