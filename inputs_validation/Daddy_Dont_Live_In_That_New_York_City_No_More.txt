Daddy dont live in that New York City  
No more  
He dont celebrate Sunday on a Saturday night  
No more  
Daddy dont need no lock and key  
For the piece he stowed  
Out on Avenue D  
Daddy dont live in that New York City  
No more  
Daddy dont drive in that Eldorado  
No more  
He dont travel on down to the neighborhood  
Liquor store  
Lucy still loves her coke and rum  
But she sits alone  
Cause her daddy cant come  
Daddy dont drive in that Eldorado  
No more  
  
Driving like a fool out to Hackensack  
Drinking his dinner from a paper sack  
He says I gotta see a joker  
And Ill be right back  
  
Daddy dont live in that New York City  
No more  
He cant get tight every night  
Pass out on the barroom floor  
Daddy cant get no fine cigar  
But we know youre smoking  
Wherever you are  
Daddy dont live in that New York City  
No more
