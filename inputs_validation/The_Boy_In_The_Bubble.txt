It was a slow day  
And the sun was beating  
On the soldiers by the side of the road  
There was a bright light  
A shattering of shop windows  
The bomb in the baby carriage  
Was wired to the radio  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
This is the long distance call  
The way the camera follows us in slomo  
The way we look to us all  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
Thats dying in a corner of the sky  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
And dont cry baby dont cry  
Dont cry  
  
It was a dry wind  
And it swept across the desert  
And it curled into the circle of birth  
And the dead sand  
Falling on the children  
The mothers and the fathers  
And the automatic earth  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
This is the long distance call  
The way the camera follows us in slomo  
The way we look to us all oyeah  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
Thats dying in a corner of the sky  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
And dont cry baby dont cry  
Dont cry  
  
Its a turnaround jump shot  
Its everybody jump start  
Its every generation throws a hero up the pop charts  
Medicine is magical and magical is art think of  
The Boy in the Bubble  
And the baby with the baboon heart  
  
And I believe  
These are the days of lasers in the jungle  
Lasers in the jungle somewhere  
Staccato signals of constant information  
A loose affiliation of millionaires  
And billionaires and baby  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
This is the long distance call  
The way the camera follows us in slomo  
The way we look to us all oyeah  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
Thats dying in a corner of the sky  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
And dont cry baby dont cry  
Dont cry dont cry  
  
Om
