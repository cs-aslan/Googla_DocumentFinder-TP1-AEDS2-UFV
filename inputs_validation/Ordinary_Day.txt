Ah  
ah ha ha ah  
  
I want to kiss you  
Just not ordinary miss you  
Its an ordinary day  
I would like to do the same tomorrow  
I want to kiss you  
Just not ordinary miss you  
But youre sleeping on my arm  
Im longing to wake you up  
  
I want it simple  
I have travelled around the world  
I can never see myself in the rain  
Walking out  
Now its you and me  
And we take it from here and now  
Twosome wild and free  
  
I want to kiss you  
Just not ordinary miss you  
Its an ordinary day  
I would like to do the same tomorrow  
  
Would I lie would I lie  
To something so obvious to myself  
Im wanting you day and night  
I see your smile  
Whe youre waking up here beside me  
And your hair is a mess  
And I cant resist you  
Its heaven on earth  
How will I do  
To protect our little world  
Easy life bye bye  
  
Its heaven on earth  
I want to kiss you  
Just not ordinary miss you  
Its an ordinary day  
Its an ordinary day Come come come to me  
  
Come come come to me ordinary day  
Come come come to me  
Come come come to me  
  
Oh when you come to me  
I can never see myself in the rain  
Walking out oh when you come to me  
Twosome wild and free  
  
I want to kiss you  
Just not ordinary miss you  
Its an ordinary day  
I would like to do the same tomorrow
