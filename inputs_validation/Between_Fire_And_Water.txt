Youre mine for awhile till a new face appears  
And then youre no longer with me  
They call me a fool and laugh at my tears  
But they know Ill never be free  
  
CHORUS  
Between fire and water  
Thats where you got me  
I get burned every time Im with you  
Between fire and water  
I cry an ocean  
Cause without you Im bluer than blue  
  
My love cannot die though you break my heart  
Ill want you the rest of my days  
I try to forget but each time I start  
Im still but a slave to your ways  
  
CHORUS  
Between fire and water  
Thats where you got me  
I get burned every time Im with you  
Between fire and water  
I cry an ocean  
Cause without you Im bluer than blue
