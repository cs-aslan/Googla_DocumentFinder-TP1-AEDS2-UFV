Go to sleep you little babe  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Your mamas gone away and your daddys gonna stay  
Didnt leave nobody but the baby  
  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Everybodys gone in the cotton and the corn  
Didnt leave nobody but the baby  
  
Youre sweet little babe  
Youre sweet little babe  
Honey in the rock and the sugar dont stop  
Gonna bring a bottle to the baby  
  
Dont you weep pretty babe  
Dont you weep pretty babe  
Shes long gone with her red shoes on  
Gonna need another lovin baby  
  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Go to sleep you little babe  
You and me and the Devil makes three  
Dont need no other lovin baby  
  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Come and lay your bones on the alabaster stones  
And be my everlovin baby
