Theres guns across the river aimin at ya  
Lawman on your trail hed like to catch ya  
Bounty hunters too theyd like to get ya  
Billy they dont like you to be so free  
  
Campin out all night on the berenda  
Dealin cards til dawn in the hacienda  
Up to Boot Hill theyd like to send ya  
Billy dont you turn your back on me  
  
Playin around with some sweet senorita  
Into her dark hallway she will lead ya  
In some lonesome shadows she will greet ya  
Billy youre so far away from home  
  
Theres eyes behind the mirrors in empty places  
Bullet holes and scars between the spaces  
Theres always one more notch and ten more paces  
Billy and youre walkin all alone  
  
They say that Pat Garretts got your number  
So sleep with one eye open when you slumber  
Every little sound just might be thunder  
Thunder from the barrel of his gun  
  
Guitars will play your grand finale  
Down in some Tularosa alley  
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley  
Billy youre so far away from home  
  
Theres always some new stranger sneakin glances  
Some triggerhappy fool willin to take chances  
And some old whore from San Pedro to make advances  
Advances on your spirit and your soul  
  
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down  
Theyve hired Pat Garrett to force a showdown  
Billy dont it make ya feel so lowdown  
To be shot down by the man who was your friend  
  
Hang on to your woman if you got one  
Remember in El Paso once you shot one  
She may have been a whore but she was a hot one  
Billy you been runnin for so long  
  
Guitars will play your grand finale  
Down in some Tularosa alley  
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley  
Billy youre so far away from home
