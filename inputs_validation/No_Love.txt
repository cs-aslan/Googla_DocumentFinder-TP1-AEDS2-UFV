At the end of my life when its time to depart  
Will the last face I see be yours  
When I take my last breath and I drift through the dark  
Will I look round and still feel secure  
  
Its no sacrifice to stay by your side  
Till hell freezes clear to the core  
Whatever the price no matter how high  
Over your shoulder  
When you turn around Ill be tellin you  
  
No love will ever be stronger  
No love anywhere  
No love will ever last longer  
If I cant have your love I dont want no love at all  
  
Ill put my change on the dresser next to your scarf  
Cook my heart in the skillet next to yours  
Ten thousand tears lead up to now  
You are the treasure for sure  
  
Lines on my face get deeper each day  
But the feelings are ageless and smooth  
One single trace of doubt still remains  
Over my shoulder when I turn around  
Will you be tellin me  
  
No love will ever be stronger  
No love anywhere  
No love will ever last longer  
If I cant have your love I dont want no love at all
