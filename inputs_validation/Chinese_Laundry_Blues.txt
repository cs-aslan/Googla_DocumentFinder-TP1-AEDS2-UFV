Now Mr Wu was a laundry man in a shop with an old green door  
Hell iron all day your linen away he really makes me sore  
Hes lost his heart to a Chinese girl and his laundrys all gone wrong  
All day hell flirt and scorch your shirt thats why Im singing this song  
Oh Mr Wu what shall I do Im feeling kind of Limehouse Chinese Laundry
Blues  
This funny feeling keeps round me stealing  
Oh wont you throw your sweetheart over do  
My vests so short that it wont fit my little brother  
And my new Sunday shirt has got a perforated rudder  
Mr Wu what shall I  
Im feeling kind of Limehouse Chinese Laundry Blues  
Now Mr Nu hes got a naughty eye that flickers  
You ought to see it wobble when hes ironing ladies blouses  
Mr Wu what shall I do Im feeling kind of Limehouse Chinese Laundry Blues  
Now Mr Wu hes got a laundry kind of tricky  
Hell starch my shirts and collars but hell never touch my waistcoat  
Mr Wu what shall I do Im feeling kind of Limehouse Chinese Laundry Blues
