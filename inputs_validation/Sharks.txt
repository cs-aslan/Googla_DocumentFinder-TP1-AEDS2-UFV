Sharks dont attack the Irish  
Its mostly Australians  
Theres nothing accomplished  
By these splashing citizens  
From the Moon down to the surface  
Of the Marianas Trench  
I wont send you in a cab when  
I can take you there myself then steal a look  
Over your shoulder at  
The distant lights of your firmament  
  
When the sharks finished the Irish  
And those people from Berlin  
We left our look of the landed  
With one of rescues imminent  
From the Moon down to the surface  
Of the Marianas Trench  
I wont send you in a cab when  
I can take you there myself then steal a look  
Over your shoulder at  
The chandeliers of your firmament  
Its your firmament baby
