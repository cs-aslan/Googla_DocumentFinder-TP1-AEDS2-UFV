Im not running away  
Im running to  
Corruption of the spirit isnt in it  
For a good looking man about town  
  
Are you afraid of someone alive  
Are you feeling heartbroken  
Because youll never be mistaken for a  
Good looking man about town  
  
You got your degree  
Then you flew to Mars  
But you still feel wretched cause  
Youll never be naked with a  
Good looking man about town  
  
Are you afraid of someone alive  
Are you scared to death  
Of even looking at the flesh of a  
Good looking man about town  
  
Hear the gang say  
Marry me marry me  
  
On the midnight street  
No moon and no stars  
No one around to calm you down  
And to soften the stings to my heart  
  
The dream is sand in my hands  
The dream becomes sand in my hands
