After the party you took me back to your parlour  
A little nervous laughter locking the door  
My stockings fall onto the floor desperate for more  
Nobody else can share this  
Here comes one and one makes one  
The glorious union well it could be love  
Or it could be just lust but it will be fun  
It will be wonderful  
  
Oh feel it oh oh feel it feel it my love  
Oh feel it oh oh feel it feel it my love  
Oh I need it oh oh feel it feel it my love  
Feel it See what youre doing to me  
  
God but youre beautiful arent you  
Feel your warm hand walking around  
I wont pull away my passion always wins  
So keep on amoving in keep on atuning in  
Synchronize rhythm now  
  
Oh feel it oh oh feel it feel it my love  
Oh feel it oh oh feel it feel it my love  
Oh I need it oh oh feel it feel it my love  
Feel it See what youre doing to me
