Cmon check it  
  
Through steel walls  
Your voice blastin on  
True rebel my brother Mumia  
I reflect upon  
You be tha spark  
That set tha prairie fires on  
Make tha masses a mastodon path  
To trample tha fascists on  
At fifteen exposed Phillys finest killing machine  
With boots and mad guns  
They tried to pacify you young  
Cause and effect  
Smell tha smoke and tha breeze  
My panther my brother  
We are at war until youre free  
  
Youll never silence tha voice of tha voiceless  
Youll never silence tha voice of tha voiceless  
  
You see tha powerful got nervous  
Cause he refused to be their servant  
Cause he spit truth  
And burned like black churches  
Prose and verses  
A million poor in hearses  
Watch tha decision of Dred Scott  
As it reserves  
So long as tha rope  
Is tight around Mumias neck  
Let there be no rich white life  
We bound to respect  
Cause and effect  
Cant ya smell tha smoke in tha breeze  
My panther my brother we are at war until youre free  
  
Youll never silence tha voice of tha voiceless  
Youll never silence tha voice of tha voiceless  
Youll never silence tha voice of tha voiceless  
Youll never silence tha voice of tha voiceless  
  
And Orwells hell a terror era coming through  
But this little brothers watching you too  
And Orwells hell a terror era coming through  
But this little brothers watching you too
