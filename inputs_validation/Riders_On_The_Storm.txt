Riders on the storm  
Riders on the storm  
Into this house were born  
Into this world were thrown  
Like a dog without a bone  
An actor out alone  
Riders on the storm  
  
Theres a killer on the road  
His brain is squirmin like a toad  
Take a long holiday  
Let your children play  
If ya give this man a ride  
Sweet FAMILY will die  
Killer on the road yeah  
  
Girl ya gotta love your man  
Girl ya gotta love your man  
Take him by the hand  
Make him understand  
The world on you depends  
Our life will never end  
Gotta love your man yeah  
  
Riders on the storm  
Riders on the storm  
Into this house were born  
Into this world were thrown  
Like a dog without a bone  
An actor out alone  
  
Riders on the storm  
Riders on the storm  
Riders on the storm  
Riders on the storm  
  
Riders on the storm
