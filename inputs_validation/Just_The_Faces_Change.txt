I look around for faces I know  
I never ever want to go home  
My friends are in bed but Im best on my own  
Im terrified of driving a car  
  
Afraid Im afraid of the dark  
But it happened before in a different bar  
And I know its late but wont you take me home  
I must have thought of getting out now  
  
But how am I gonna get out  
When even the names stay the same  
Just the faces change  
  
Its easier to stare at the sun  
Than look at all the things that youve done  
Intentions were good but so was the fun  
And you know its wrong it cant go on for long  
  
I must have thought of getting out now  
But how am I going to get out  
When even the names stay the same  
Just the faces change  
Just the faces change  
  
I must have thought of getting out now  
But how am I going to get out  
When even the names stay the same  
Just the faces change  
Just the faces change
