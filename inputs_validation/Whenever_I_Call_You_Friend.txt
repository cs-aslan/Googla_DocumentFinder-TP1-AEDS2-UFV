Whenever I call you friend  
I begin to think I understand  
Anything we are  
You and I have always been ever and ever  
  
I see myself within your eyes  
And thats all I need to show me why  
Everything I do always takes me home to you  
Ever and ever  
  
Now I know my life has given me  
More than memories  
Day by day we can see  
In every moment theres a reason to carry on  
  
Sweet love showin us a heavenly light

Sweet love flowin almost every night
