Charlene2 When a dictator gets deposed  
And then hes thrown into the DOC  
Doofenshmirtz2 Oy vey  
Charlene2 His wife is thrown in right beside him  
Under key and lock  
So to avoid a situation  
With such limited appeal  
Doofenshmirtz2 Me and Mrs Doofenshmirtz  
We struck a little deal  
  
Charlene2 We told everyone around us  
We had split  
Doofenshmirtz2 Yes we were through  
So if they came to haul me off  
They wouldnt get her too  
Charlene2 Theres that and then theres also tax  
Advantages of course  
Doofenshmirtz2 and Charlene2 All the convoluted reasons  
We pretend to be divorced  
  
We get double the amount  
Of discount coupons in the mail  
We have twice the junk to offer  
In our annual yard sale  
We each have our separate bathrooms  
Bedrooms living rooms and dens  
We see each other all the time  
But through a telescopic lens  
  
Charlene2 We dont agree on restaurants  
Or where to holiday  
Doofenshmirtz2 But now for those activities  
We go our separate ways  
Doofenshmirtz2 and Charlene2 We spend so little time together  
Conversations never forced  
All the convoluted reasons  
We pretend to be divorced
