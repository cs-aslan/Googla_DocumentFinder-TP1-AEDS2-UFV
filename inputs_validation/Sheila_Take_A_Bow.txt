Is it wrong to want to live on your own  
No its not wrong  but I must know  
How can someone so young  
Sing words so sad  
  
Sheila take a Sheila take a bow  
Boot the grime of this world in the crotch dear  
And dont go home tonight  
Come out and find the one that you love and who loves you  
The one that you love and who loves you  
Oh  
  
Is it wrong not to always be glad   
No its not wrong  but I must add  
How can someone so young  
Sing words so sad   
  
Sheila take a Sheila take a bow  
Boot the grime of this world in the crotch dear  
And dont go home tonight  
Come out and find the one that you love and who loves you  
The one that you love and who loves you  
  
Take my hand and off we stride  
Oh la  
Youre a girl and Im a boy  
La  
Take my hand and off we stride  
Oh la  
Im a girl and youre a boy  
La  
  
Sheila take a Sheila take a bow  
La  
Throw your homework onto the fire  
Come out and find the one that you love  
Come out and find the one you love
