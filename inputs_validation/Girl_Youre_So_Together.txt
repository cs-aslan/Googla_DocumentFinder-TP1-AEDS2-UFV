Girl youre so together  
Together we can make it all the way  
If I had a chance to choose  
Between a million bucks and you  
Id choose you babe yeah  
  
Its no dreams  
But with proof as sweet as you noo  
Apples peaches and cherries  
Just wont do ooh baby  
  
Even the flowers and lollipops  
Could never hope to top  
The sweetness of your kiss  
Can you dig it  
  
Girl youre so together  
And together we can make it all the way yeah yeah  
If I had a chance to choose  
Between a million bucks and you  
Id choose you babe  
Choose you babe  
Girl your smile ooh  
  
Is like the month of may yeah  
When youre near me  
The storm clouds stay away yeah  
Even the little honey bees  
Turn to you when they need more honey  
Love you so much its not funny  
  
Girl youre so together  
And together we can make it all the way yeah  
Oh girl youre so together  
Oh hey girl girl eye eye popper  
A real life traffic stopper  
A knockout queen  
  
Oh what I mean is  
Girl youre so together  
And together we can make it all the way  
Oh I love her I love her I love I love you babe

And together we can make it all the way  
Ooh girl youre so together
