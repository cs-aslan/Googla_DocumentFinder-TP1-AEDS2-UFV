I missed you Thanksgiving I didnt do much  
Watched football on TV and I lost twenty bucks  
Did you go to Georgia well Georgia is in they had a nice meal at the Holiday
Inn  
I missed you on Christmas and so did my friends  
I know you were busy and I understand  
I sent you a card with a good Snoopy joke aint it a pity that we didnt have
snow  
 acguitar   
I missed you on New Years my doesnt time fly  
That Auld Lang Syne song sure gets in my eye  
Heard you had a party and some people went you were the life of the party
again  
Well springtime is coming it makes me a fool  
I thought I would call you while everythings cool  
I know it sounds crazy but I wanted to say  
I hope that you have a happy Groundhog Day
