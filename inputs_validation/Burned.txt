Been burned and with both feet on the ground  
Ive learned that its painful comin down  
No use runnin away and theres no time left to stay  
Now Im finding out that its so confusin  
No time left and I know Im losin  
  
Flashed and I think Im fallin down  
Crashed and my ears cant hear a sound  
No use runnin away and theres no time left to stay  
Now Im finding out that its so confusin  
No time left and I know Im losin  
  
Now Im finding out that its so confusin  
No time left and I know Im losin

No use runnin away and theres no time left to stay
