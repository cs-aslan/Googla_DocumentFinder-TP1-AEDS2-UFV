You were born together and together ye shall be forever  
Until death could scatter  
Shouldnt matter in the memory of god above  
Let the wind of heaven dance between you too  
Allowing time and space to bring you closer to everlasting love  
So what should you do if god moves through you  
  
When love beckons its ways are often hard and steep  
And his wings unfold ye yield to all that it speaks  
Though a sword it might be hidden there among the pinions  
Oh you may wear a wound that truly spoke to you  
Believe in all that voice and follow through  
So what should you do when god moves through you  
  
Love possesses nothing  
Nor would it ever be possessed  
Love is love sufficient unto love  
And you can figure out the rest  
  
God rests in reason  
So what should you do oh oh  
When god moves through you  
  
Well your children will not be your children  
Maybe the daughter the son of a beginning  
Theyll come through your womb but not be coming from you  
They will be with you but they do not belong to you  
  
You can give them your love but not your thoughts  
Cause theyll arrive with their own hearts  
Theyre the coming of angels this blessed season  
And then theyll sing oh yea god rests in reason  
God rests in reason  
So what should you do when god moves through you  
  
And think not you can direct the course of  
Love itself directs the course of love  
Believe not god is in your heart child  
But rather youre in the heart of god  
  
So you see so far Im all right  
Pleasant and awkwardly polite  
Watching carefully the comedy  
The tick tock moments of the grid lock day  
  
And why Im singing  
About the fact that Im giving up everything  
And giving back to the people that made me want to change  
My evil lazy ways  
Im gonna give you one more phrase to explain  
  
See I believe in only one thing  
I believe in good orderly D I are E C T I O N  
Ill spell it again roll it with abbreviation  
Easy as a 1 2 3  
Spell it backwards its a D O G  
Cause its a dog eat dog world  
What a life girl maybe you should make you my wife girl  
  
And I believe in omni possibility  
Its nothing more than good orderly direction  
Nothing more than good orderly direction  
Nothing more than good orderly direction  
This is nothing more than good orderly direction  
So what should you do when god moves through you  
What should you do when god moves through you
