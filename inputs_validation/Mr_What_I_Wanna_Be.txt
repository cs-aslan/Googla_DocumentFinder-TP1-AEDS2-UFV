I everyone has A friend of their own  
Someone that we can look up to  
Mine is like no one IVe ever known  
HeS not like me heS not like you  
Ii while you and I climb the ladder high  
He looks into the horizon  
He asks me  boy what are you tryin to find   
Then I realize my journeyS just begun  
Chorus I  
Everybody say Hello to this friend of mine  
HeS standing here right inside of me  
And everybody heS the one whoS always on my mind  
HeS somebody you donT see  
Iii knowing whatS good and what is right from wrong  
He always seeks to find it  
The choice between coin and candy for the soul  
He needs nobody to remind him  
Iv he always packs his bag with honesty  
Specially to show to himself  
A tankFull of courage and humility  
So he wonT get lost tryin to be somebody else  
Chorus ii  
Everybody say  hello to this friend of mine  
HeS standing here right inside of me  
And everybody heS the one whoS always on my mind  
HeS somebody you donT see  
His name is mr What I  wanna  be  
His name is mr What I  wanna  be  
Bridge  
And the race goes on and on and on  
The race for truth in A world of lies  
Life is not just what we have known  
In A world full of blindness  
Now I wanna see with both my eyes  
Repeat chorus ii  
Coda  
I am learning  
I am learning from someone  
Never stop learning  
Until he and I are one
