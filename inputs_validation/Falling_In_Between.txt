Ive just got to find  
Find a way back home to you girl  
  
Lifes been Hell to pay  
I cant disobey  
Gotta live in my world  
  
I hear voices calling  
From the faces never seen  
Darkness all around me  
I am falling in between  
  
Youve been lookin down  
Down to the ground  
On everything I say girl  
  
Hope just cant be found  
Im so gagged and bound  
Because of you girl  
  
I hear voices calling  
From the places I have been  
Love and understanding  
Only flows from deep within  
Darkness that surrounds me  
I am falling in between
