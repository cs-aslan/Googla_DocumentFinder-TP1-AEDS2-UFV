Had a dream  
Had a drowning dream I was in a river of pain  
Only difference this time  
I wasnt calling out your name yeah  
Has it ended before its begun  
You hold on  
And I try to run but  
Anybody heading in my direction  
Away from the city  
Anybody want to change the way they feel  
step inside  
Doesnt really matter where you want to take me  
Away from the city  
I want to start again  
I want to start again  
A want to take it back  
I want to start again  
Start again  
Funny how those friends forget you when you tired of their games  
You miss a show or a party that blows  
And theyve forgotten your name yeah  
And you wonder what youve become  
They pull you back when you try to run  
Well anybody heading in my direction  
Away from the city  
Anybody want to change the way they feel  
Step inside  
Doesnt really matter where you want to take me  
Away from the city  
I want to start again  
I want to start again  
A want to take it back  
I want to start again  
Start again  
I left the me I used to be  
I want to see this through  
Left the me I used to be  
If only youd see it too  
Well I wonder what youve become  
You pull me back when I try to run  
Well anybody heading in my direction  
Away from the city  
Anybody want to change the way they feel  
Step inside  
Doesnt really matter where you want to take me  
Away from the city  
I want to start again  
I want to start again  
A want to take it back  
I want to start again  
Start again
