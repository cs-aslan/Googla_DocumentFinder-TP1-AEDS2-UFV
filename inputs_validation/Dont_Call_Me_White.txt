Dont call me white dont call me white  
Dont call me white dont call me white  
The connotations wearing my nerves thin  
Could it be semantics generating the mess were in  
  
I understand that language breeds stereotype  
But whats the explanation for the malice for the spite  
Dont call me white dont call me white  
Dont call me white dont call me white  
I wasnt brought here I was born  
Circumcised categorized allegiance sworn  
Does this mean I have to take such shit  
For being fair skinned No  
  
I aint a part of no conspiracy Im just youre average joe  
Dont call me white dont call me white  
Dont call me white dont call me white  
Represents everything I hate  
The soap shoved in the mouth to cleanse the mind  
The vast majority of sheep  
  
A buttoned collar starched and bleached  
Constricting veins the blood flow to the brain slows  
Theyre so fuckin ordinary white  
Dont call me white dont call me white  
Dont call me white dont call me white  
Oh were better off this way  
Oh say what youre gonna say  
  
So go ahead and label me an asshole  
cause I can  
Accept responsibility for what Ive done  
But not for who I am  
Dont call me white dont call me white  
Dont call me white dont call me white
