I can almost see it  
That dream Im dreaming but  
Theres a voice inside my head saying  
Youll never reach it  
Every step Im taking  
Every move I make feels  
Lost with no direction  
My faith is shaking but I  
Got to keep trying  
Got to keep my head held high  
  
Theres always going to be another mountain  
Im always going to want to make it move  
Always going to be an uphill battle  
Sometimes Im gonna to have to lose  
Aint about how fast I get there  
Aint about whats waiting on the other side  
Its the climb  
  
The struggles Im facing  
The chances Im taking  
Sometimes might knock me down but  
No Im not breaking  
I may not know it  
But these are the moments that  
Im going to remember most yeah  
Just got to keep going  
And I  
I got to be strong  
Just keep pushing on cause  
  
Theres always going to be another mountain  
Im always going to want to make it move  
Always going to be an uphill battle  
Sometimes Im gonna to have to lose  
Aint about how fast I get there  
Aint about whats waiting on the other side  
Its the climb yeah  
  
Theres always going to be another mountain  
Im always going to want to make it move  
Always going to be an uphill battle  
Sometimes you going to have to lose

Aint about whats waiting on the other side  
Its the climb yeah yeah ea ea
