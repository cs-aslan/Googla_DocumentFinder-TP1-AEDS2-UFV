Im sailing down the summer wind  
I got whiskers on my chin  
And I like the mood Im in  
As I while away the time of day  
In the lee of Christian Island  
  
Tall and strong she dips and reels  
I call her Silver Heels  
And she tells me how she feels  
Shes a good old boat and shell stay afloat  
Through the toughest gales and keep smiling  
But for one more day she would like to stay  
In the lee of Christian Island  
  
Im sailing down the summer day  
Where fish and seagulls play  
I put my troubles all away  
And when the gale comes up Ill fill my cup  
With the whiskey of the highlands  
Shes a good old ship and shell make the trip  
From the lee of Christian Island  
  
Tall and strong she slips along  
I sing for her a song  
And she leans into the wind  
Shes a good old boat and shell stay afloat  
Through the toughest gales and keep smilin  
When the summer ends we will rest again  
In the lee of Christian Island  
  
When the summer ends we will rest again  
In the lee of Christian Island
