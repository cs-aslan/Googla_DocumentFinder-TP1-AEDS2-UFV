I walk down to the blue side of town  
Where theres no happiness no joy  
Down at the end of a long dark street  
I saw a little paper boy  
Paper boy paper boy  
Ive got bad news for you  
Paper boy paper boy  
Me and my baby are through  
She was my love my one and only  
I feel so bad Im oh so lonely  
Im looking for my love  
Ive got my own headlines for today  
Theyve been the same since she went away  
One dark haired angel disappears  
Seems like Shes been gone a million years  
Paper boy Paper boy  
So long goodbye  
Paper boy paper boy  
Thanks for listening while I cry  
I feel a little better now that someone knows  
But I will go on looking forever I suppose  
Im looking for my love  
Extra extra read all about it  
My babys gone and I wanna shout it  
Im looking for my love  
Im looking for my love  
Im looking for my love  
Im looking for my love
