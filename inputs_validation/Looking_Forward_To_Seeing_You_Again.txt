Looking forward to seeing you again Im looking forward to seeing you again  
Well it seems like only yesterday that I was living here  
And Im surprised that hasnt change throughout these many years  
That old tree aint grown much more than six or seven feet  
Lord I sometimes wish that I lived on this street  
Looking forward to seeing you again Im looking forward to seeing you again  
Its silly but in all my little hometown kinda dreams  
I thought of you and sunny skies and ice banana cream  
I think of coffee conversation about the local folks  
And how things were when I was just a joke  
And Im looking forward to seeing you again  
Oh Im looking forward to seeing you again  
I know Im foolish when I think that life here never ends  
The never changing smile of all my old familiar friends  
But I suppose that death is just as real in Olive Hill as it is in some big
city by a mill  
Im looking forward to seeing you again oh Im looking forward to seeing you
again  
Remember all the times Ive had to borrow fifteen bucks  
How could I be so optimistic so down on my luck  
You never mentioned that I had so many things to learn  
And you never said it when my back was turned  
And Im looking forward to seeing you again my friend  
Im looking forward to seeing you again  
Well here I am a few miles from your friendly coffee pot  
I meant to call and tell you I was here but I forgot  
I guess we never changed much from the things that we have been  
But Im looking forward to seeing you again  
Im looking forward to seeing you again oh Im looking forward to seeing you
again  
There aint too many cities like this pretty town today  
And I can hear an old dog barkin somewhere far away  
Perhaps the great brave friend son of a dog that I once knew  
Barking at somewhere with whom I went to school  
Looking forward to seeing you again oh Im looking forward to seeing you again  
Looking forward to seeing you again my friend  
Im looking forward to seeing you again  
Looking forward to seeing you again oh Im looking forward to seeing you again
