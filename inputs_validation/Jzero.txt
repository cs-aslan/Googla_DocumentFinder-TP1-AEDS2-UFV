Well I aint got nothing  
But it dont worry me  
I came to this life like a freewalking tree  
No need to be tied no need to be  
They call me Jzero  
  
Well I aint got nothing  
And to nothing I belong  
You wont find me right  
Yet you wont find me wrong  
If you think about me  
Dont think too long  
Jus call me Jzero  
  
Well I dont house no past  
Never carried a key  
My sun doesnt rise from under the sea  
There is only one morning  
Eternally dee dlee dlee  
  
Well he says he hasnt got nothing  
But he seems to possess less  
He waltzed through the door  
Like a tapdance with death  
What kind of fool is he  
  
No need to guess jus call me Jzero  
  
Well I dont eat a lot  
I do work for nothing so  
If theres a job I can fill the gap  
I dont need a room bed or pillow oh  
Once youve decided to trust me with time  
You wont need to look back  
A doo de doo de doo  
  
Well I aint got nothing  
But it dont worry me  
I came to this life like a freewalking tree  
No need to be tied no need to be  
They call me Jzero
