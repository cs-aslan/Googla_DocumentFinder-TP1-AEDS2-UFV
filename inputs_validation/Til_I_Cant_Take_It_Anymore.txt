Ben E King  
  
Lets not fight it anymore  
Unpack the bags and close the door  
Ill never leave you no no  
Though you lied right from the start  
I cant convince my stupid heart  
Not to believe you no no  
Youve got two good men strung out  
And theres not the slightest doubt  
That other men have loved you before  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell  
Till I cant take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
  
If I had one ounce of pride  
Id stand up or step aside  
But girl love you cant you tell it  
So Ill accept the crumbs you drop  
Cause Im a fool and I cant stop  
Or rise above you no no  
Let him speak up for himself  
I speak for me and no one else  
Cause Im a beggar knockin on your door  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell  
Till I cant take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
  
Im too far gone to turn around  
To lift myself up off the ground  
And start all over over and over  
Now he or I must win or lose  
No matter which one you may choose  
Youll be in clover you know you will  
While youre makin up your mind  
Ill be prayin all the time  
Prayin that youll never never ever let me go  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and live in Hell  
Till I cant take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and live in Hell  
Till I cant take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
Till I cant take it anymore  
Take it anymore
