Winter sounds the crying  
Like an old man slowly dying  
And the only sound the wind that fills the trees  
Even colder comes the moon  
And though it never seems too soon  
A sudden stillness as the rainfall starts to freeze  
  
Chorus x2  
Im Mr Blue  
Im here to stay with you  
And no matter what you do  
When youre lonely  
Ill be lonely too  
  
A young girl she is shaded  
Bears the scars that never faded  
Of the baby that was born on Christmas Day  
While the heavens sing their song  
A childs life is never long  
Cos the food supplies will only last a day  
  
Chorus  
  
Patriot emotion is the cause of the commotion  
After all theres really noone here to blame  
Soldiers taking orders cos we must defend the borders  
Of our nation and the other sides the same  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill come to you at night  
When all the world is sleeping tight  
And lie beside you til the early morning dew  
You cant hear me you cant see  
But you can feel me when you read  
The folded letter she left addressed to you  
  
Chorus
