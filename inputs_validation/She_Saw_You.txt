Why did you tell your girlfriend you were hanging with the boys  
She called me last night and I tried to cover for ya  
She asked if I liked the flick that we all went out to see  
I said ooo uh it was nice  
She said Dont you lie to me  
You messed up you shoulda warned me first she saw you  
Im sad to tell ya  
You shoulda told me cause you made it worse she saw you unlucky fella  
You better take that credit card she saw you to Cartier  
You better hope with all you got she saw you  
She feels like forgiving you today  
Too bad for you  
You were out there trying to be a player now shes gone its true  
Its hard to feel that sorry for you  
She saw you now this is the end  
Saw you kiss the very girl whos supposed to be only your friend  
Shes convinced you took her heart  
And played with it like a toy  
And from what I heard you just might need you a lawyer  
Its too late for feeling bad you did not respect the girl  
You tried to play around  
And got caught with your pants down  
You cant escape from what youve done she saw you your time is up  
Youre like a deer whos caught up in she saw you the headlights of love  
You cant be too proud to plead she saw you shes gonna make you pay  
Forgiveness is what you need she saw you shes too mad to let you get away  
Looks bad to me  
You were busy trying to be a player  
Now shes gone breathe deep  
You cant be doing that creep creep creep creep  
She saw you now this is the end  
Saw you kiss the very girl whos supposed to be only your friend
