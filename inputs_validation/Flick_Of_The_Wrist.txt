Dislocate your spine if you dont sign he says  
Ill have you seeing double double  
Mesmerize you when hes tonguetied  
Simply with those eyes ooh ooh ooh  
Synchronize your minds and see  
The beast within him rise  
  
Dont look back  
Dont look back  
Its a ripoff  
Flick of the wrist and youre dead baby  
Blow him a kiss and youre mad ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Flick of the wrist  hell eat your heart out  
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head  
Hes taken an arm and taken a leg  
All this time honey  
Baby youve been had  
  
Intoxicate your brain with what Im saying  
If not youll lie in kneedeep trouble  
Prostitute yourself he says  
Castrate your human pride ooh ooh ooh  
Sacrifice your leisure days  
Let me squeeze you till youve dried  
  
Dont look back  
Dont look back  
Its a ripoff aah aah aah  
  
Work my fingers to my bones  
I scream with pain  
I still make no impression  
Seduce you with his moneymake machine  
Crosscollateralize bigtime money money  
Reduce you to a muzakfake machine  
Then the last goodbye  
Its a ripoff  
  
Flick of the wrist and youre dead baby  
Blow him a kiss and youre mad ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Flick of the wrist  hell eat your heart out  
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head  
Hes taken an arm and taken a leg  
All this time honey  
Baby youve been had
