People talkin tryin to break us up  
Why dont they let us be  
Sticks and stones may break my bones  
But talk dont bother me  
  
People talkin tryin to break us up  
When they know I love you so  
I dont care what the people may say  
Ill never never let you go  
  
Ive been abused  
In my heart and soul  
Ive been abused  
Been abused been abused and Ive been stoned  
  
People talkin tryin to break us up  
Man scandalize my name  
Theyll say anything just to make me feel bad  
Yes anything to make me ashamed  
  
Ive been abused  
In my heart and soul  
Ive been abused  
Been abused been abused and Ive been stoned  
  
People talkin tryin to break us up  
Man scandalize my name  
Theyll say anything just to make me feel bad  
Yes anything to make me ashamed  
  
Oh yes I know  
Dont you know it too  
Yes I know it  
Dont you know it too
