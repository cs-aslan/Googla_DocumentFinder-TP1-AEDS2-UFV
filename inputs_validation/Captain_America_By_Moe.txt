Captain America said you gotta be like me  
Or youre gonna wind up dead last  
At the end of your rope  
Flat broke  
Down and tired  
You sleepy head  
Wont you go to bed  
Let me run your life  
Lies  
  
Clark Kent ran for president  
No one knew about the secrets locked in his head  
Friends tried to take his life  
Accusations flew  
Flew like Kryptonite  
Clark Youre still looking good  
What you gonna say  
To make everything alright  
Lies  
  
May be right  
May be wrong  
Im in the middle anyway  
May be right  
May be wrong  
Im in the middle anyway  
Stuck in the middle anyway  
  
Buckshot shooter  
Had a realm of fun  
With a smoking gun  
Heard around the world  
What a War of the Worlds  
What a wonderful way to wage  
Suicide  
Lies  
Pay your fine  
Do your time  
Let me run your life  
Lies  
  
May be right  
May be wrong  
Im in the middle anyway  
May be right  
May be wrong  
Im in the middle anyway  
Stuck in the middle anyway  
Right in the middle  
Dead in the middle anyway  
  
Captive America read I gotta be like you  
With a bubble in my bed  
Buzzin your telephone  
Like youre not at home  
Home on the range  
Bread and corn fed  
Wont you got to bed  
Let me run your life  
Lies  
  
May be right  
May be wrong  
Im in the middle anyway  
May be right  
May be wrong  
Im in the middle anyway  
May be right  
May be wrong  
Im in the middle anyway  
May be right  
May be wrong  
Im in the middle anyway  
Stuck in the middle  
Right in the middle  
Dead in the middle anyway
