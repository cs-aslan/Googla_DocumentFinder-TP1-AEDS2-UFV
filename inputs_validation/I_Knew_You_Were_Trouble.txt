Once upon time  
A few mistakes ago  
I was in your sights  
You got me alone  
You found me  
You found me  
You found me  
  
I guess you didnt care  
And I guess I liked that  
And when I fell hard  
You took a step back  
Without me without me without me  
  
And hes long gone  
When hes next to me  
And I realize the blame is on me  
  
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places Id never been  
So you put me down oh  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places Id never been  
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground  
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble  
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble  
  
No apologies  
Hell never see you cry  
Pretend he doesnt know  
That hes the reason why  
Youre drowning youre drowning youre drowning  
  
And I heard you moved on  
From whispers on the street  
A new notch in your belt  
Is all Ill ever be  
And now I see now I see now I see  
He was long gone  
When he met me  
And I realize the joke is on me  
  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places Id never been  
So you put me down oh  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places Id never been  
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground  
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble  
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble  
  
When your saddest fear comes creeping in  
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything  
Yeah  
  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places Id never been  
So you put me down oh  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places Id never been  
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground  
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble  
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble  
  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
Trouble trouble trouble  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
Trouble trouble trouble
