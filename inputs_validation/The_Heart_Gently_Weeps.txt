Wu Wu Wu Tang Tang Tang  
  
The joy the flowers bring me  
The pain still has me sinking  
All while the heart gently weeps  
Your smell has got me shrinking  
The tears in your eyes are twinkling  
Because the heart gently weeps  
  
Raekwon  
Snowy night fiends basing  
A Raisin in the Sun was amazing  
The joint on the dresser a gauge went off  
Jumped up fish tank it fell and they stuck  
They shot her cousin LaVon he owed a buck  
Willie was awful pulled out the ratchet let off two  
Grits fell on his leg Kiana ripped the cold bowl  
He violent an Island nigga with the talent  
Of six killas who just came home from straight wilding  
Robbing everything in Macys Lacy short haircut  
With long arms who fuck niggas got four babies  
Yvette jabber her slapped her wig off ran in the crib  
She did the dumb shit my nigga then clapped her  
Lester smoked Chester sister Vest I heard it was a mess  
They ripped the apple out her throat blessed her  
Hungry hyenas from Medina all eight trained us  
Who got reluct think fast and blast from Beamers  
  
Ghostface Killah  
I brought my bitch out to Pathmark shes pushing the cart  
Headed to aisle four damn I got milk on my Clarks  
Thats what I get not focusing from hitting that bar  
My mouth dried need plenty water quick I feel like a shark  
In the aisle busting them paper towels and wiping my Wallys down  
  
I stood up to face a barrel hes holding a shiny pound  
Its him he want revenge I murdered his Uncle Tim  
I sold him a bag of dope his wife came and copped again  
That bitch is crazy and uh she brought her baby  
She knew I hard the murders a smack it killed her man though  
Now I got his fucking nephew gripping his gat youse a bitch  
You better kill me you know youre booty  
You pulled your toolie out on me motherfucker  
First thought was to snatch the ratchet said fuck it and fucking grabbed it  
I ducked he bucked twice this nigga was fucking laughing  
I wrestled him to the ground tustle scuffle constantly kicked him  
He wouldnt let go the joint so I fucking bit him  
Shots was whizzing hitting Clorox bottles  
Customers screaming then the faggot ran out of hollows  
I had to show him what its all about  
Next thing you read in the paper A man who came to kill gets knocked out  
  
Chorus Erykah Badu  
I dont know whhhhhhhhhhhy nobody told you  
Mans not supposed to cry  
Though were just babies and youre so crazy  
How tears of joy bring so much life  
  
Method Man  
Yo aiyo yo yo yo  
You on ya way to the store nigga grab me a Dutch  
Im mad as fuck my dude my count was short when I was bagging it up  
Now I need liquor nigga pass me a cup  
Whats up with Officer Brown The other day he tried to shackle me up  
He killed Kase and now he hassling us  
This motherfucker got balls even the gaul to try and patten me up  
Time to reup let these niggaz know we back on the block  
With three hundred off a Gpack its cracking the spot  
  
Chorus
