Just yesterday  
You were looking up to me  
And Youd ask me  
What I thought  
  
But now Im sitting here  
All alone with my tears  
Lookin at my life  
That Ive bought  
  
Where did I go yeah  
My eyes they will show  
  
Little me  
Please forgive me  
I couldnt see  
You hurting inside  
  
Little me  
Please forgive me  
I couldnt see  
You hurting inside  
  
But now Im sitting here  
You were looking up to me  
And Youd ask me  
What I thought  
  
But now Im sitting here  
All alone with my tears  
Lookin at my life That Ive bought  
  
Where did I go yeah  
My eyes they will show  
  
Little me  
Please forgive me  
I couldnt see  
You hurting inside  
  
Little me  
Please forgive me  
I couldnt see  
You hurting inside  
  
Where did I go yeah  
My eyes they will show  
  
Little me  
Please forgive me  
I couldnt see  
You hurting inside  
  
Little me  
Please forgive me  
I couldnt see  
You hurting inside
