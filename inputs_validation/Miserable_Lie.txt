So goodbye  
Please stay with your own kind  
And Ill stay with mine  
  
Theres something against us  
Its not time  
Its not time  
So goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye  
  
I know I need hardly say  
How much I love your casual way  
Oh but please put your tongue away  
A little higher and were well away  
The dark nights are drawing in  
And your humor is as black as them  
I look at yours you laugh at mine  
And love is just a miserable lie  
You have destroyed my flowerlike life  
Not once  twice  
You have corrupt my innocent mind  
Not once  twice  
I know the windswept mystical air  
It means  Id like to see your underwear  
I recognize that mystical air  
It means  Id like to seize your underwear  
What do we get for our trouble and pain   
Just a rented room in Whalley Range  
What do we get for our trouble and pain   
Whalley Range   
Into the depths of the criminal world  
I followed her   
  
I need advice I need advice  
I need advice I need advice  
Nobody ever looks at me twice  
Nobody ever looks at me twice  
  
Im just a countrymile behind  
The world  
  
Im just a countrymile behind  
The whole world  
Oh oh oh   
  
Im just a countrymile behind  
The world  
  
Im just a countrymile behind  
The whole world  
Oh oh oh   
  
Take me when you go  
Oh oh oh  
  
Take me when you go  
Oh oh oh   
  
I need advice I need advice
