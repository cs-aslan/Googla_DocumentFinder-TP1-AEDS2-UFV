Believe me Natalie  
Listen Natalie  
This is your last chance to find  
A gogo dance to disco now  
Please believe me Natalie  
Listen Natalie  
This is your last chance to find  
A gogo dance to disco now  
  
Forget what they said in Soho  
Leave the ohnos out  
And believe me Natalie  
Listen Natalie  
This is your last chance  
  
There is an old cliche  
Under your Monet painting  
Remember the arch of roses  
Right above your couch  
Forget what they said in Soho  
Leave the ohnos out  
Yes there is an old cliche  
Under your Monet painting  
You left the station now to the floor  
With speculation what was it for  
In that old hallway  
Moses why dont you say  
Youve been away for a long time  
  
Believe me Natalie  
This is your last chance  
To find a gogo  
Forget what they said in Soho  
And walk away  
If my dreams for us cant get you through  
Just one more day  
Its alright by me  
  
God help me somehow  
Theres no time for survival left  
The time is now  
Cause this might be your last chance  
To disco ohoh
