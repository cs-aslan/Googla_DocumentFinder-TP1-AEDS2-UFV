Born on a farm in a transatlantic moonlight  
Split like a cord of wood my family broke up  
Sold like a piece of steer a piece of meat a cow  
A breathing piece of shit  
  
Picked for my age for my strength and make up  
Called for I was tall I was big I could hold up  
A tree or a piece of steel I could do  
What my fat owner cant  
  
Ah future farmers of America  
Future farmers of America  
Future farmers of America  
  
Ah  
Im always watching the way his wife looks me over  
I have a sex twice as big as her husbands  
If I wasnt so large so strong so pale  
Id disappear under a bush  
Colorless men and ladies of the world unite  
Kill your master with one cut of your knife  
Kill them during sex kill them during talk  
Kill them whenever you can  
  
Future farmers of America  
Future farmers of America  
Future farmers of America  
  
These   
Stupid black owners are foreigners to affairs of the heart  
Look at me Ill never own land that I work on  
Every one of us here shares a surname  
This father must die  
  
I was born on the dark cusp of twilight  
My father was dark my mother was light  
Look at me Im strong  
I could crush him in my fist  
  
Ah  
I could crush him in my  
I could crush him in my  
I could crush him in my fist  
  
I could crush him in my  
I could crush him in my  
I could crush him in my fist  
  
Future farmers of America  
I could crush him in my fist  
Future farmers of America  
I could crush him in my fist  
Future farmers of America  
I could crush him in my fist
