I heard a voice through the discord  
Of a deluge of passersby  
I saw one gaze frozen in time  
Watching me passing by  
  
I swear Ill know your face in the crowd  
And Ill hear your voice so loud  
When your whispering  
  
Hey unfaithful I will teach you to be stronger  
Hey ungraceful I will teach you to forgive one another  
  
Heres my kiss to betray  
Desperate to brush the lips of grace  
Do you feel hollow when you think of how Iv lied  
  
Oh sweet angel of mercy  
With your grace like the morning  
Wrap your loving arms around me  
  
Hey unfaithful I will teach you to be stronger  
Hey ungraceful I will teach you to forgive one another  
Hey unloving I will love you  
  
Jesus Im ready to come home
