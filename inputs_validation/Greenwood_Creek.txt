Tom johnston  
Smell the fragrance of the old pine tree  
See the woman shes down on her knees  
She own some land and a good crop she seeks  
Down along the banks of greenwood creek  
I can hear that southbound rollin  
Carryin all my hopes away  
Im strapped to my mule at the old country school  
When Im gonna get out I cant say  
Played guitar for ten long years  
My only pay was the hound dogs cheers  
Someday Im gonna get me some land  
Far away in that promised land  
I can hear that southbound rollin  
Carryin all my hopes away  
Im strapped to my mule at the old country school  
When Im gonna get out I cant say
