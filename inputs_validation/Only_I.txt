Only I no one else but only I  
No one else but only I  
Nobody else but I can call her mine  
Only I no one else but only I  
Some people call her an angel  
The answer to my prayers  
Shes all this heart of mine desires and knows  
They say shes deep as a river  
And gracious as the morn  
Some people say  
Shes as lovely as a rose  
They call her gentle  
They call her warm and kind  
But only I only I can call her mine  
Some people say shes a candle  
Glowing in the dark  
They say shes the wind  
That blows the clouds away  
They say that shes like the sunshine  
Through the pouring rain  
Her smile can brighten up anybodys day  
They call her radiant  
They call her bright  
They call her a star that shiness  
But only I only I can call her mine  
Only I have her heart  
And only she has mine  
Whod have ever thought  
A man like me could be  
The one to say  
Shes with me all the way  
The one to say  
She loves only me only me  
Some people says shes the best thing  
To ever come my way  
They say shes a blessing  
The best in my life  
They say shes a jewel  
So rare so hard to find  
They call her a wonder  
They call her one of a kind  
They call her precious  
They call her dear  
They call her divine  
But only I only I can call her  
The one that Ill love forever  
Only I only I can call her mine  
Only I no one else but only I  
No one else but only I  
Only I No one else but only I  
Only I can call her mine
