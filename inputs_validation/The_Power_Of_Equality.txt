Ive got a soul that can not sleep  
At night when something just aint right  
Blood red but without sight  
Exploding egos in the night  
Mix like sticks of dynamite  
Red black or white this is my fight  
Come on courage lets be heard  
Turn feelings into words  
American equality has always been sour  
An attitude I would like to devour  
My name is peace this is my hour  
Can I get just a little bit of power  
  
The power of equality  
Is not yet what it ought to be  
It fills me up like a hollow tree  
The power of equality  
  
Right or wrong my song is strong  
You dont like it get along  
Say what I want do what I can  
Death to the message of the Ku Klux Klan  
I dont buy supremacy  
Media chief you menance me  
The people you say cause all the crime  
Wake up motherfucker and smell the slime  
Blackest anger whitest fear  
Can you hear me am I clear  
My name is peace this is my hour  
Can I get just a little bit of power  
  
The power of equality  
Is not yet what it ought to be  
It fills me up like a hollow tree  
The power of equality  
  
Ive got tapes  
Ive got cds  
Ive got my Public Enemy  
My lilly white ass is tickled pink  
When I listen to the music that makes me think  
Not another motherfuckin politician  
Doin nothin but something for his own ambition  
Never touch the sound we make  
Soul sacred love vows that we take  
To create straight what is true  
Yo hes with me and what I do  
My name is peace this my hour  
Can I get just a little bit of power  
  
The power of equality  
Is not yet what it ought to be  
It fills me up like a hollow tree  
The power of equality  
  
Madder than a motherfucker lick my finger  
Cant forget cause the memory lingers  
Count em off quick little piccadilly sickness  
Take me to the hick eat my thickness  
Ive got a welt from the Bible belt  
Dealing with the hand that Ive been dealt  
Sitting in the grip of a killing fist  
Giving up blood just to exist  
Rub me wrong and I get pissed  
No I can not get to this  
People in pain I do not dig it  
Change of brain for Mr Bigot  
Little brother do you hear me  
Have a heart oh come get near me  
Misery is not my friend  
But Ill break before I bend  
What I see is insanity  
Whatever happened to humanity
