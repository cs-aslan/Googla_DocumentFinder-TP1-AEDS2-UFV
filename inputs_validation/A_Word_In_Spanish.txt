I dont know why  
I just know I do  
I just cant explain  
In this language that I use  
Something leaves me speechless  
Each time that you approach  
Each time you glide right through me  
As if I was a ghost  
  
If I only could tell you  
If you only would listen  
Ive got a line or two to use on you  
Ive got a romance we could christen  
  
And theres a word in Spanish I dont understand  
But I heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man  
He said it with devotion he sounded so sincere  
And the words he spoke in Spanish brought the female lead to tears  
A word in Spanish a word in Spanish  
  
If you cant comprehend  
Read it in my eyes  
If you dont understand its love  
In a thin disguise  
And what it takes to move you  
Each time that you resist  
Is more than just a pretty face  
To prove that I exist  
  
When manners make no difference  
And my gifts all lay undone  
I trade my accent in on chance  
And fall back on a foreign tongue
