I have been lost in this verbal rain  
I went to bed feeling no pain  
I was drowning baby youre my wine  
Youre my thoughts youre my silence  
Youre my sense of time  
  
By 730 youll fall in love with me  
Do you believe in destiny  
I believe by 730  
  
Maybe your loves an uncrackable code  
Or maybe your love is a railroad  
That you ride when you are all alone  
And you speed down the tracks  
To what you call home  
  
By 730 youll fall in love with me  
Do you believe in destiny  
I believe by 730  
  
Quite unsubtle these thoughts  
You send me  
Or is it I who sends them unreceived  
And they fly through the air  
At enormous speed  
Like a boomerang flying back at me  
  
By 730 youll fall in love with me  
So you believe in destiny  
I believe by 730
