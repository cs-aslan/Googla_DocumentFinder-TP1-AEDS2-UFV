You me  
Understand  
Shake my hand  
Last chance little man  
Aint it grand  
Its a bargain its a steal  
30 pieces of silver  
And a deals a deal  
  
Sign upon the dotted line  
Ill be yours and youll be mine  
Nothings free  
Eventually  
Nothings free  
  
From the rules and laws of morality  
Free to take your fill  
Free from your own free will  
Nothings free  
  
My boy its getting late  
Ill raise the stakes  
So close  
Control your fate why hesitate  
Seal the deal close the sale  
Take my hammer drive the nail  
  
Sign upon the bloody line  
A drop of yours a drop of mine  
Nothings free  
Eternally  
Nothings free  
  
From your conscience or  
Free from the consequence  
Free to sin and death  
Free till your final breath  
Nothings free  
Free from the claws and flaws of your family  
Free from obedient life  
Youre cut like a doubleedged knife  
Nothings free nothings free  
Oh you pay me  
  
Free to ignore the bore of authority  
Free to spit in the face  
Be the winningest rat in the race till Judgement Day  
Then nothings free  
Bow to me if you want to be free  
Free from life come die with me  
And when were dead its for eternity  
  
Come on little one and dance in the fire  
The heats getting close  
and the flames getting higher  
When the musics over theres a hush in the choir  
Nothings free  
When the trumpets sound  
and his light is all around  
And the saints all raise from the graves  
in the ground  
Well be going way downtown  
Way downtown
