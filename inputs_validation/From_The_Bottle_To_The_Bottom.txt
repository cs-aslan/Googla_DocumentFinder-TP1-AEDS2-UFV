You ask me if Im happy now  
Thats good as any joke Ive heard  
It seems that since Ive seen you last  
I done forgot the meaning of the words  
If happiness is empty rooms  
And drinkin in the afternoon  
Well I suppose Im happy as a clam  
But if its got a thing to do  
With smilin of forgettin you  
Well I dont guess that I could say I am  
  
Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone  
Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew  
When the water from the weeds has soaked the paper  
Hes been puttin in his shoes to keep the ground from comin through  
And his future feels as empty as the pocket in his pants  
Because hes never seen a single dream come true  
Thats the way that Ive been feelin since the day I started falling  
  
From the bottle to the bottom stool by stool  
Learnin hard to live with losin you  
You wonder if Im better off  
With freedom now to do the things I choose  
With all my times my own and  
I got nothin left but sleepin time to lose  
Theres no one here to carry on  
If I stay out the whole night long  
or give a tankerous damn if I dont call  
Im livin like I wanted to  
And doin things I want to do  
And nothin means a thing to me at all  
  
Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone  
Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew  
When the water from the weeds has soaked the paper  
Hes been puttin in his shoes to keep the ground from comin through  
And his future feels as empty as the pocket in his pants  
Because hes never seen a single dream come true  
Thats the way that Ive been feelin since the day I started falling  
  
Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone  
Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew  
When the water from the weeds soaked the paper  
Hes been puttin in his shoes to keep the ground from comin through  
And his future feels as empty as the pocket in his pants  
Because hes never seen a single dream come true  
Thats the way that Ive been feelin since the day I started falling  
From the bottle to the bottom stool by stool  
Learnin hard to live with losin you
