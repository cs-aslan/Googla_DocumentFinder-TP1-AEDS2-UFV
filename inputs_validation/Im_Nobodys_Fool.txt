I know your kind you pick a girl guy  
Then change your mind and have a whirl  
Now the gals guys that youve kissed say  
Im next on your list uh uh baby  
Im nobodys fool  
  
You had youre fun by telling lies  
And now youve come to claim this prize  
Uh uh baby  
Im nobodys fool  
  
Ive heard your evry lie  
Dear its the same old tune  
Dont even waste your time here  
Baby Im immune  
  
Just turn around be on your way  
Dont hang around it doesnt pay  
Cause I wont take a chance  
On a one way romance  
Uh uh baby  
Im nobodys fool
