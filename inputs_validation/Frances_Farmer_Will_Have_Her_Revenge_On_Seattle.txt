Its so relieving to know that youre leaving as soon as you get paid  
Its so relaxing to hear youre asking wherever you get your way  
Its so soothing to know that youll sue me this is starting to sound the
same  
I miss the comfort in being sad  
In her false withness we hope youre still with us  
To see if they float or drown  
Our favorite patient  
A display of patience diseasecovered Puget Sound  
Shell come back as fire to burn all the liars  
And leave a blanket of ash on the ground  
I miss the comfort in being sad
