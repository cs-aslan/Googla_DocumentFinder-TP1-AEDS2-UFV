Sitting in my room  
Record player on  
Sitting in my room  
Humming a sickening tune  
Sitting in my room  
Something to do soon  
  
We know what we think of them  
The problems just keep piling in  
They got complains about everything  
  
Its us against them  
Its us against them  
Its us against them  
  
They just want to worry  
Thats not what any kid  
Should have to do  
They just want to be so lame  
Maybe they should  
Try and sniff some glue
