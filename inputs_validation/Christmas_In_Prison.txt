It was Christmas in prison and the food was real good  
We has turkey and pistols carved out of wood  
I dream of her always even when I dont dream  
Her names on my tongue and her bloods in my stream  
  
Wait a while eternity  
Old Mother Natures got nothin on me  
Come to me run to me come to me now  
Im rollin my sweetheart  
Im flowin by God  
  
She reminds me of a chess game with someone I admire  
Or a picnic in the rain after a prairie fire  
Her heart is as big as this whole goddamn jail  
And shes sweeter than saccharine at a drug store sale  
  
Wait a while eternity  
Old Mother Natures got nothin on me  
Come to me run to me come to me now  
Im rollin my sweetheart  
Im flowin by God  
  
The search light in the big yard turns round with the gun  
And spotlights the snowflakes like the dust in the sun  
Its Christmas in prison therell be music tonight  
Ill probably get homesick I love you Good night  
  
Wait a while eternity  
Old Mother Natures got nothin on me  
Come to me run to me come to me now  
Im rollin my sweetheart  
Im flowin by God
