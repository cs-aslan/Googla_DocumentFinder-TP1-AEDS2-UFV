Hush now dont explain  
Just say youll remain  
Im glad your back dont explain  
  
Quiet dont explain  
What is there to gain  
Skip that lipstick  
Dont explain  
  
You know that I love you  
And what endures  
All my thoughts of you  
For Im so completely yours  
  
Cry to hear folks chatter  
And I know you cheat  
Right or wrong dont matter  
When youre with me sweet  
  
Hush now dont explain  
Youre my joy and pain  
My lifes yours love  
Dont explain
