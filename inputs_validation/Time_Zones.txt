Time zones  
It doesnt matter where you go or how you wiggle and squirm  
Were in a maze baby  
All alone  
What doesnt kill you has a mommas way of  
Helping ya learn  
Blast off  
Five four three baby bout to  
Push it through  
Its a payoff  
You can tell cause  
Dont tow it away  
Well all be back tomorrow  
After today  
Well all come back tomorrow  
Pit stop  
Were in the middle everybodys learnin to breathe  
Leavin like an  
Earthquake  
Leaves you shakin but at least were not  
Shakin alone  
Angel bright life and death  
Up the road gonna salt my bread  
Angels fly around my head  
All gatherin at the foot of my bed  
Dont believe the lies they said  
Keep it simple around  
Hot steam  
Were in the middle and baby thats a  
Beautiful thing  
Dont kill the  
Mockingbird whos really just  
Learning to sing  
Dont tow it away  
Angel bright life and death
