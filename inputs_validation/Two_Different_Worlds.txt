I know this girl shes always on my mind  
She lives in her world and I live in mine  
I should forget about her and Ive tried oh Lord knows Ive tried  
But I want to know her and heres the other side  
  
Ive got someone waiting for me every night  
Shes the only one Ive ever loved its been that way for the longest time  
And shes the one that makes my world go right  
And it tears me in two because I know where Ill be tonight  
  
I think she knows it  
I think she knows  
  
I live in two different worlds two different worlds  
One that belongs to me one could be wrong for me  
Two different worlds two different worlds  
Ohh its two different worlds  
  
Is she that different or is it the thrill of someone new  
Strung out on her I need her love I need it bad that I know I know its
true  
Im the one that lies awake alone  
And I know shes the one that makes me stray from home  
  
And I know it  
Yeah I know it  
  
I live in two different worlds two different worlds  
One that I may regret one that I cant forget  
Two different worlds two different worlds  
Oh its two different worlds  
  
No I cant explain this emptiness  
No I know that I cant go on like this  
Two different worlds two different worlds  
  
Oh its two different worlds I live in two different worlds  
One that I may regret and one that I wont forget  
Two different worlds but I cant live in both I know  
One world I must let go
