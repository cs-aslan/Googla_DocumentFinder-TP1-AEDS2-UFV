My father always said that theres no free ride  
Youve got to make a sacrifice  
With so many Prophets on the Lords side  
Even your soul has got a price  
But talk is cheap it takes money to buy your freedom  
And the tax mans knockin at your door  
  
Chorus  
Spend it while you can  
Moneys contraband  
You cant take it with you when you go  
Spend it while you can  
Before its taken from your hand  
Theres no free ride in this carnival world  
  
Too many hawkers on this travelin show  
Everybodys got something to sell  
Bootleg Swatches cardboard Gucci gear  
Watch your step at the wishing well  
  
Whats mine is mine  
If its only one thin dime  
My cash has always meant to flow  
  
Chorus  
  
Spend it while you can etc  
Theres no free ride in this carnival world  
  
But talk is cheap it takes money to buy your freedom  
And the tax mans knockin at your door  
  
Chorus  
  
Spend it while you can  
 theres no free ride in this carnival world  
Theres no free ride in this carnival world
