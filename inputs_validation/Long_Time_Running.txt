Does your mother tell you things  
Long long when Im gone  
Who you talking to  
Is she telling you Im the one  
Its a grave mistake and Im wide awake  
  
DriveIns rained out  
Weatherman wetfingers the sky  
He pokes it out he pulls it in  
He dont know why  
Its the same mistake  
  
Its been a long time running  
Its been a long time running  
Its well worth the wait  
  
We dont go anywhere  
Just on trips  
We havent seen a thing  
We still dont know where it is  
Its a safe mistake  
  
Its been a long time running  
Its been a long time running  
  
Well well its all the same mistake  
Dead to rights and wide awake  
Ill drop a caribou Ill tell on you  
Ill tell on you Ill tell on you  
  
Youve got a boatload of nerve  
But I would say youve been told  
You work me against my friends  
And youll get left out in the cold  
Its the same mistake  
  
Its been a long time running  
Its been a long time coming  
Its been a long long long time running  
Its well worth the wait  
Its well worth the wait  
Its well worth the wait  
Its well worth the wait
