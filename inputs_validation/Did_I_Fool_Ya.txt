When daddy sings  
Hes an auctioneer auctioneer  
And mother clings to anniversaries  
And his sister shes got a little bit of mister in her  
And her brothers goin round round round his bed  
And I said and I say  
I say well believe what I say  
I said did I did I fool ya fool ya  
Well didnt daddy fool ya  
He sang once and a goin twice  
Hes gone for 35 or 40  
And he go once and a goin twice  
Hes gone for 35 Sold to the middle line  
They go once and a goin twice  
And aint it nice  
And oh lord they made it up to 65  
They go once and a goin twice  
And aint it nice Aint it nice oh aint it nice  
 Said aint it nice for the price  
I said I got a nice life for the price is right  
Body rock rody bock  
And they boss said a come on down down down

Youre the next big winner  
So come on down

But I but I I said I  
I give and give and I lay it all down now  
Well look what Ive found

Now look what Ive found ah look what Ive found  
Blue skies theyre smiling at me  
And thats my favorite melody  
But I cant read and I cant read and  
I cant read between the things unseen  
And I dont mind and I dont mind and I dont mind  
If I dont find because Ive tried
