I walk into a room  
I say how do you do  
They look at me and I look back at them  
I slip into a chair  
They say are you prepared I said I do not know  
Sometimes I feel it but I cant explain  
Sometimes I need and want them through my vains  
Now theres ten in front of me  
Asking me what do I see  
I see nothing but butterflies and  
Tests I did not know  
The answers will not show  
And all I see is butterflies and  
Sometimes I feel it but I cant explain  
Sometimes the answers running to my brains  
And in the long run you always said Ill be there beside you  
And in the long run you always thought Ill be there to guide you  
Sometimes I feel it but I cant explain  
Sometimes I need it like a running train  
Sometimes I feel it in my pride  
Sometimes I take it in my stride  
Slow down feelings  
Loved up with you  
I cant feel my legs  
I cant feel you  
Slow down feelings  
Loved up with you  
The night before an hour too  
On my back and leaving you  
Falling down the stairs and seen it through  
Falling down feelin this  
Monday morning I feel out of sorts  
But thats ok  
Dried up and dreaming  
Punching and screaming  
Feeling the morning through  
Duuududududuudu  
Duuududududuudu  
Duuududududuududududu  
Duuududududuudu  
Duuududududuudu  
Duuududududuududududu
