Light green to green dark green brown  
Every life is falling down  
Brown to black its coming back  
Dies to be part of the ground  
Seed to seedling root to stem  
  
Eyes no eyes theres no difference  
Every life is looking in  
Swallowing seeds on the deathbed  
Dig a hole in the garden  
  
Everyone is practicing  
But this worlds an accident  
I was the fool because I thought  
  
I thought the world  
Turns out the world thought me  
Its all the other way round  
Were upside down  
  
Daddys gone up flames  
But this aint no movie  
This aint no book you can close  
When the big lie hits your eye  
  
Everybodys practicing  
Our worlds an accident  
I was the fool because I thought  
  
Let the fluency set it down  
Theres an upside of down  
  
The moon is rolling around
