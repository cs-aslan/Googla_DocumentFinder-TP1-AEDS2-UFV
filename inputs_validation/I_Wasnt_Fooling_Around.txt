I wasnt fooling around  
Everythings true that I said  
So take me seriously  
Darling please just take me  
I wasnt fooling around  
  
Laugh if you want to  
But I wasnt joking  
About this love thats so real  
Is it surprising  
Im romanticizing  
About the way I feel  
  
I wasnt playing around  
Im not a kid anymore  
Im not the clown  
Thats just here to amuse you  
I wasnt fooling around  
  
Laugh if you want to  
But I wasnt joking  
About this love thats so real  
Is it surprising  
Im romanticizing  
About the way I feel  
  
I wasnt fooling around  
It wasnt like that at all  
So take me seriously  
Darling please just take me  
I wasnt fooling around  
I wasnt fooling around
