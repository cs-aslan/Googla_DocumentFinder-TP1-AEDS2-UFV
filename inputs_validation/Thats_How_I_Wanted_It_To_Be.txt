I thought Id like to leave the black side of life for a while  
To live alone and have some fun  
So I told her to take the kids and go back to her ma  
Thats how I wanted it to be and I felt satisfied it was over and done  
I wake up every morning make myself a cup of jay  
Down to the factory thats where I spend my pay  
Five oclock the whistle blows and that leaves the evening free  
Thats how I wanted it to be  
Well it didnt take me long to find out just how much I missed her  
So I wrote and told her to take the kids and come on back home  
Cause I was ready to settle down now  
Well you see I just got her letter today  
And it seems shes found someone she can depend on  
Thats how I wanted it to be she aint coming home no more  
I wake up every morning
