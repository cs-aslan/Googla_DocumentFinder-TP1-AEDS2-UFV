Blue Monday morning at the factory gate  
Almost time to clock in  
The boys were bettin  
That Joe wouldnt show  
Cause they had seen him over the weekend  
He had four new tire on his old cadillac  
Betty the waitress and some clothes in the back  
A dashboard full of roadmaps of Mexico  
Yeah Joe knows how to live  
  
He said Women were made to love  
Money is made to spend  
Life is something buddy  
You will never live again  
Yeah youve got to admit it  
Joes knows how to live  
  
And now theyll be down at the ocean  
He and Betty stretched out somewhere  
The only blue in his life  
Is the blue moonlight  
Bouncin off Bettys blonde hair  
I can just see em rollin round on the sand  
I never thought I was a jealous man  
But when I think what hes doin that Im not hah  
Lord Im jealous about it  
  
He said Women were made to love  
Money is made to spend  
Life is something buddy  
You will never live again  
Yeah youve got to admit it  
Joes knows how to live  
  
Lets go to Mexico  
Now Bettys back home with her mother  
Joes back on the assembly line  
But he brings in his pictures  
And his Mexican hat  
Just to remind us sometime  
That women were made to love  
Money is made to spend  
Life is something buddy  
You will never live again  
  
Yeah youve got to admit it  
Joes knows how to live  
Yeah youve got to admit it  
Joes knows how to live  
That boys a genius  
He sure is crazy  
Oooo la la la la la la
