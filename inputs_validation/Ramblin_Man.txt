I can settle dowown and be doinjust fine  
Til I hear an old train rollindown the line  
Then I hurry straiaight home and pack  
And if I didn go I believe I blow my stack  
I love you baaby but you gotta understand  
When the lord made me  
He made a ramblin man  
  
Some folks might saay that I no good  
That I wouldn settle down if I could  
But when that open rooad starts to callinme  
There somethinor the hill that I gotta see  
Sometimes it harrd but you gotta understand  
When the lord made me he made a raamblinman  
  
I love to see the towowns apassinby  
And to ride these rails eath god blue sky  
Let me travel this laand from the mountains to the sea  
Cause that the life I believe he meant for me  
And when I goone and at my grave you stand  
Just say God called home your raamblinman
