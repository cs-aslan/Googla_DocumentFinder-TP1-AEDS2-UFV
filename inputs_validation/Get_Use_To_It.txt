If you try to get wit me  
Pull a four on the fifty  
Fuck yo monkey ass up like Bobby did Whitney  
Trigger fingers get itchy  
When niggaz get bitchy  
And they need they story told on Jerry or Ricki  
Well youre green and youre iffy  
Im clean and Im spiffy  
If they lock me up today Ill be back in a jiffy  
All my niggaz thats wit me  
All my bitches are picky  
To ride around thats right on time  
Bitch you know its tricky  
Take a hit of the sticky  
Everybody get tipsy  
When we hittin that whiskey  
All my niggaz get pissy  
Dont fuck wit no sissy  
All we bumpin is missy  
If you know where I am motherfucker come get me  
Im a man out of mickey  
All my niggaz love hickies  
That dont go away til ya well in your sixties  
All Im wearin is dickies  
Dont try to evict me  
When we come to Atlanta we gon reopen Nickies  
  
Im a gangsta rap teacher nigga you better know it  
Its the Don Gotti Jr slash motherfuckin poet  
Sit back and take notes while I spin like hundred spokes  
My flow is razor sharp Im comin straight for ya throat  
With that west coast gang bang  
Watch him when his chain hang  
East coast down south  
Niggaz do the same thang  
Throw up ya dubs like WuTang who bang  
Harder than that nigga barrelin thru ya hood wit two chains  
Swangin like hes nuts cuz he dont give a fuck  
I know nigga that aint bangin in no khakis or some chucks  
Its that westside connected with that nigga who flow so wreckless  
He spent a hundred thousand on his necklace I bet this  
Motherfuckin coast aint got shit after me  
Aint have shit before Cube except a Dub C  
The mack circle is back with mad purple in fact  
Im bout to join the Lynch mob thats me squirtin the mack
