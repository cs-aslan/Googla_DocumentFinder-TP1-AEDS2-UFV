Cold are the bones of thy soldiers  
Longing for home their little paradise  
I dont feel redemption on their side  
  
Fallen from grace help me rise again  
Fallen from grace help me through  
Fallen from grace help me through  
Fallen from grace  
  
Feel these hands the pressure the cold tremble  
Do you hear these words  
Do you feel the wounds  
Ill never help you through  
  
Cold are thy souls  
I feel resentment  
they feel betrayed  
They hate the cold  
I dont feel redemption on their side  
  
Fallen from grace help me rise again  
Fallen from grace help me through
