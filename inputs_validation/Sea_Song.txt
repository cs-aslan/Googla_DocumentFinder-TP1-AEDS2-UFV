You look different every time  
You come from the foam  crested brine  
Its your skin shining softly in the moonlight  
Partly fish partly porpoise partly baby sperm whale  
Am I yours are you mine to play with  
  
Joking apart when youre drunk youre terrific  
When youre drunk I like you mostly late at night  
Youre quite alright  
But I cant understand the different you  
In the morning  
When its time to play at being human for a while  
We smile we smile we smile  
  
Youll be different in the spring I know  
Youre a seasonal beast  
Like the Starfish that drift in with the tide with the tide  
So until your blood runs to meet the next full moon  
Your madness fits in nicely with my own with my own  
Your lunacy fits neatly with my own  
My very own  
Were not alone
