I tumble into space try to stop the fall  
My body ripped and tore I could have floated in space  
  
Could have floated  
  
I stumble round my home  
I am on the outside My legs and arms are lead feeling love from no one  
Could have floated My head weighs ninetypounds and Ive been down  
My friends are aliens and Ive been down  
Well now Ive got no wife Cut a lizards tail it grows back to life  
I killed some sleepless nights my hearts torn to pieces  
Could have floated I am the funny guy yeah Ive been down  
I am the big rock star yeah Ive been down  
Ill never be the same cause Ive been inside out  
And I want to be an animal and take care of my own  
My head weighs ninety pounds and Ive been down  
My friends are aliens and Ive been down  
I know what its like cause Ive been down Devil sneaks in and deals and Ive
been down
