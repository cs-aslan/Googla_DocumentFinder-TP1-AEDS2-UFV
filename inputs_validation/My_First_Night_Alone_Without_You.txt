There is an aching in my head  
From the bed I cant get used to  
Its these little hours in the dark I dread  
As I spend my first night alone without you  
  
Honey half of me has gone away  
With all the love I learned to cling to  
Tomorrow Ill have to find another way  
To live the rest of my life alone without you  
  
You taught me how to live  
How to be myself  
And how to give  
Oh but now its you  
Whos given up on giving  
  
Youve lost the thing no one to teach  
Changing and now youre out of reach  
And my life tonight just dont seem worth living  
No no  
  
Ive been sitting learning how to read  
Cause back in school I never liked to  
Its just one of those little things Im gonna need  
As I put my life together baby without you
