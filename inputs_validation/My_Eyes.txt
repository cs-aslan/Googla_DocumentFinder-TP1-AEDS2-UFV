My eyes are so tired  
They should sleep  
But they wont  
They dont  
They wont let me pass this up  
  
My eyes are stuck open in love  
They want more of him  
They need less of this  
Theyre everything  
Theyre unbelievable  
  
My eyes are lonely and cold  
Theyre young  
And theyre old  
Theyre looking for a way out  
And a moment to let you in  
They want nothing to do with me  
And only want to do with him  
Theyre hungry  
Im warning  
And Im scared  
  
And they wont let me thrive  
Theyll need everything you own  
Make it all so real  
By learning to feel  
Its not really happening  
Whats going on is much more  
Than I ever hoped for  
Ever hoped for  
  
And Id much rather imagine it  
Then not live at all
