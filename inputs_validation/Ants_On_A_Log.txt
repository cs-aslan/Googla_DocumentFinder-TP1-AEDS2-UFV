Ants on a log  
Floatin down a river  
Runnin around  
But not gettin anywhere  
Powersteerin wheels  
Just aint connected  
And we cant jump off like flees on a dog  
Cant fly away like flies on a hog  
Were really just along for the ride like ants on a log  
  
I got an uncle  
He plays a game  
Cant win it  
Hes got a mold  
Tries to fit everybody else in it  
Whens he gonna learn hes bangin his head on the wall  
He aint gonna change  
And he looks at me strange when I tell him  
  
Were all just ants on a log  
Floatin down a river  
Runnin around  
But not gettin anywhere  
Powersteerin wheels  
Just aint connected  
And we cant jump off like flees on a dog  
Cant fly away like flies on a hog  
Were really just along for the ride like ants on a log  
  
We all know people  
We yella t the cars and the traffic  
Folks in a hurry  
Lifes full of heartache and havoc  
I finally learned how to lay back and let life happen  
I just image  
The angels up in heaven  
Lookin down at us and laughin  
  
At ants on a log  
Floatin down a river  
Runnin around  
But not gettin anywhere  
Powersteerin wheels  
Just aint connected  
And we cant jump off like flees on a dog  
Cant fly away like flies on a hog  
Were really just along for the ride like ants on a log  
  
And just about the time you think  
Youre rollin in clover  
Along comes a rabbit  
And the world tips over  
  
Ants on a log  
Floatin down a river  
Runnin around  
But not gettin anywhere  
Power steer wheels  
Just aint connected  
And we cant jump off like flees on a dog  
Cant fly away like flies on a hog  
Were really just along for the ride like ants on a log  
  
Yeah were really just along for the ride like ants on a log
