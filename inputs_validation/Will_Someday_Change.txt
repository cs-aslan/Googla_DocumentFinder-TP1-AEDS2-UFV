You say that love is a disease  
Restless in its company  
Like a river to the sea is where you run  
You say that all the birds have flown  
The heart an antique turned to stone  
There is comfort in this great unknown  
  
Chorus  
And all that youve known  
And all that you say  
All that youve known will someday change  
  
You say forgiveness dont last long  
You hear the ticking of the bomb  
Leaves you wondering where it all went wrong  
  
Chorus  
  
Light will lead us all like harmless spirits traveling  
Light will lead us all like harmless spirits traveling  
  
Chorus  
  
And all that youve known
