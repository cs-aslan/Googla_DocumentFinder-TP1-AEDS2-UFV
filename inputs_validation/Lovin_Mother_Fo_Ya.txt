Riding in the park with your golden tan  
You got your new tattoo half devil half man  
Straddlin a stallion made of chrome and steel  
Spittin out fire this cats for real  
  
Hell be a lovin mother for ya dont you know  
Hell be a lovin mother for ya dont you know  
  
Everybodys got their attitudes  
Some are nice and some are rude  
They come up and slap your back  
They say Hey buddy you cant do that  
Everybodys got their opinions to protect  
But after midnight theyll be sucking your neck  
  
Theyll be a sucking mother for ya dont you know  
Theyll be a sucking mother for ya dont you know  
  
Squeeze me girl dont let me fall  
I want to walk dont want to crawl  
Let me put my kickin mule into your stall  
Cause Im a kickin mother for ya dont you know  
Cause Im a kickin mother for ya dont you know
