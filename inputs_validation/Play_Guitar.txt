You may drive around in your town  
Ina brand new shiny car  
Your face in the wind your haircuts in  
And your friends think youre bizarre  
You may find a cushy job and I hope that you go far  
But if you really want to taste some cool success  
You better learn to play guitar  
  
Chorus  
Play guitarplay guitar 3X  
  
You got your eyes on the cheerleader queen  
And youre walkin her home from school  
You know that shes only seventeen  
But you know that your a fool  
You know you cant touch this stuff  
Without money or a brand new car  
Let me give you some good advice young man  
You better learn to play guitar  
  
Chorus  
  
All women around the world want a phony rock star  
Who plays guitar  
  
Well you can pump your iron and shine your shoes  
And wear your hair just right  
You go down out on cruisin street  
Cause you want to score tonight  
We all want to strut our stuff  
And you really want to show your scars  
Forget all about that macho shit  
And learn how to play guitar  
  
Chorus
