JayZ  
Everytime  
The guns goes blast  
Another day goes past  
I dont miss my dogs  
Im wishing the days  
Could go fast  
So I could crash  
Close my eyes  
Try to go to sleep  
And bring you back but  
I cant bring you back  
Nah cant bring you back  
So I back  
Back memories of us  
Acting bad  
Wish time could freeze  
But time is up  
And I promise ya  
Imma hold it down  
Till its my time  
To leave and Im ok  
I mean  
Am allright not ok  
And it hurts my soul  
I wont see your face  
But if you truely  
Are in a better place  
Like what say  
And thats ok  
Ill be allright  
Ive been up all night  
Like if I didnt  
With my nigga to be living  
With the time  
Ticktickticking away  
So forever Im forever  
Im in search of yesterday  
Yesterday  
Like a beattle song  
I close my eyes  
Repeat the song  
Tryna bring us back  
To where we belong  
Middle of the club  
When be was on I tear  
The song blowing on  
Going back before  
So when I meet the don you  
Should know I meet way back  
With my dog when I go  
So when times says goodbye  
Yall say hello  
  
Mariah  
Bye bye 3x  
Bye bye  
  
JayZ  
Rock with me  
Mc come one  
  
Mariah  
And you never got the chance  
To see how good Ive done  
And you never got to see me  
Back at number one  
I wish that you were here  
To celebrate together  
I wish that we could spend  
The holidays together  
  
I remember when you used  
To tuck me in at night  
With the Teddy Bear  
You gave to me  
That I held so tight  
I thought you  
Were so strong  
That you can make it  
Through whatever  
Its so hard  
To accept the fact  
Youre gone forever  
  
Never knew  
I could hurt like this  
And everyday  
Life goes on like  
I wish I could  
Talk to you for awhile  
I wish I could find a way  
Try not to cry  
As time goes by  
And soon as you reach  
A better place  
Still Ill give  
The whole world  
To see your face  
And Im right here  
Next to you  
It feels like you  
Gone too soon  
The hardest thing to do  
Is say bye bye  
  
Bye bye 3x  
Bye bye  
  
This is for my peoples  
Who just lost somebody  
Your best friend your baby  
Your man or your lady  
Put your hand way up high  
Put em up put em up  
We will never say bye  
No no no  
Mammas daddys sisters  
Brothers friends and cousins  
This is for my peoples  
Who lost their grandmothers  
Lift your head to the sky  
Lift it up lift it up  
Cause we will never  
Say bye bye  
  
Never knew  
I could hurt like this  
I never knew it  
And everyday  
Life goes on like  
Everyday of my life I wish  
I wish I could  
Talk to you for awhile  
I wish  
Miss you  
But I try not to cry  
As time goes by  
I wish I wish  
I wish as time goes by  
And as soon  
As you reached  
A better place  
Still Ill give the world  
To see your face  
And we were here  
Next to you  
It feels  
Like youre gone too soon  
Now the hardest thing  
To do  
Is say bye bye  
  
Its hard to say  
Bye bye bye  
Bye bye bye  
So come on  
Somebody sing it with me  
Wave your hands up high  
Hey hey  
This if for my peoples  
Who just lost somebody  
So this is for everybody  
You put your hand to the sky  
Cause we will never say bye bye
