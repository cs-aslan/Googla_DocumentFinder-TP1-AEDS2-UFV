Sitting waiting in the falling rain  
Getting ready to begin again  
  
Wounded lying crying  
Bodies moving and dying  
All around there is the smell  
Of death and fire  
  
Here the planes are coming  
Hear the soldiers running  
Killing on a scale to comprehend  
  
Why are we here  
In this place Here to kill  
Please God forgive us for  
What we have done  
  
I always thought I was doing right  
As of now Im not feeling so sure  
  
Im at a place of where  
I give no grace  
Im a soldier of war  
  
I sit waiting for my darkest hour  
To come  
I cannot think about the things  
That I have done  
It shouldnt take a fool to see  
That I believe  
Accept the consequence  
Repent for what Ive done  
  
You tell me what is certain  
But Ill tell you what is true  
You tell me that is honesty  
When all around is death and cruelty  
  
The making of a man is fire  
By giving in to our desires  
Within the truth that lies  
Within the only thing  
  
Mother Of Mercy  
Angel of death desire  
Mother Of Mercy  
Taking my last breath of fire  
  
Mother Of Mercy  
Angel of pain  
Mother Of Mercy  
Taking my last breath  
  
Some say you are a lost cause  
Some say youre a Saint  
Just being heres an act of  
Sufering and restraint  
  
Walk down the long dark road  
To ruin panic not  
Ill die a lonely death of that  
Im certain of  
  
Rivers flow with blood  
Theres nowhere left to hide  
Its hard to comprehend  
Theres anyone left alive  
  
Sick of all the killing  
And the reek of death  
Will God tell me  
What religion is to man  
  
I dont hold with bad religion  
Understand whats underneath it  
Now I come to think of it  
I just dont hold at all you know it  
  
You say you are a holy man  
But what is it you do  
From where I stand is nothing  
But a hollow man I see  
  
Mother Of Mercy  
Angel of death desire  
Mother Of Mercy  
Taking my last breath of fire  
  
Mother Of Mercy  
Angel of pain  
Mother Of Mercy  
Taking my last breath  
  
Im just a lonely soldier fighting  
In a bloody hopeless war  
Dont know what Im fighting  
Who it is or what Im fighting for  
  
Though it was for money  
Make my fortune now Im not  
So sure  
Seem to just have lost my way
