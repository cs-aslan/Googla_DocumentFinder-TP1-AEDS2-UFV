Is this just another day this God forgotten place  
First comes love then comes pain Let the games begin  
Questions rise and answers fall insurmountable  
  
Love boat captain  
Take the reigns and steer us towards the clear here  
Its already been sung but it cant be said enough  
All you need is love  
  
Is this just another phase earthquakes making waves  
Trying to shake the cancer off stupid human beings  
Once you hold the hand of love its all surmountable  
  
Hold me and make it the truth  
That when all is lost there will be you  
Cause to the universe I dont mean a thing  
And theres just one word I still believe  
And its  
  
Its an art to live with pain mix the light into grey  
Lost nine friends well never know two years ago today  
And if our lives became too long would it add to our regret  
  
And the young they can lose hope cause they cant see beyond today  
The wisdom that the old cant give away  
Hey  
Constant recoil  
Sometimes life  
Dont leave you alone  
  
Hold me and make it the truth  
That when all is lost there will be you  
Cause to the universe I dont mean a thing  
And theres just one word that I still believe and its  
Love love Love Love Love  
  
Love boat captain  
Take the reigns steer us towards the clear  
I know its already been sung cant be said enough  
Love is all you need all you need is love  
Love love  
Love
