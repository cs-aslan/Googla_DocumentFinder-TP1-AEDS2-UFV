Verse 1  
Yeah you really tried  
But I was blind to all the lies you told me boy  
All the shit youve done  
You cant outrun the way you understand me  
  
PreChorus 1  
You acted like you bought me at a bargain sale  
You dont even care  
You focused your frustration on a small detail  
Blew it out of scale like my ponytail  
  
Chorus 1  
Well if you dont want to see the girl I want to be  
Then why then why should I listen  
If you dont want to do the things I need from you  
Goodbye goodbye  
Cause I gave it away I gave it away I gave it away  
And Im taking it right back  
  
Verse 2  
Im no blow up doll no freeforall  
No slave to your decision ooh  
Gotta find a way to break the spell  
To get the hell away from those who block my vision  
  
PreChorus 2  
You used me as a fragment of your grand design hey  
And you you dont get to put me on your bottom line  
You dont get whats mine and Im doing fine  
  
Chorus 2  
Said you dont want to see the girl I want to be  
Then why then why would I listen  
If you dont want to do the things I need from you  
Goodbye goodbye  
Cause I gave it away I gave it away I gave it away  
Im taking it right back baby  
  
Chorus 1  
Well if you dont want to see the girl I want to be  
Then why then why should I listen  
If you dont want to do the things I need from you  
Goodbye goodbye  
Cause I gave it away I gave it away I gave it away  
And Im taking it right back hey  
Taking it right back baby  
Im taking it right back hey
