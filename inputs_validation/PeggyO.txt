As we marched down to Fanerio  
As we marched down to Fanerio  
Our captain fell n love with a lady like a dove  
And they called her name pretty Peggyo  
Come a runnin down the stairs pretty Peggyo  
Come a runnin down the stairs pretty Peggyo  
Come a runnin down the stairs combin back  
Your yellow hair  
Youre the prettiest little girl Ive ever seeno  
  
In a carriage you will ride pretty Peggyo  
In a carriage you will ride pretty Peggyo  
In a carriage you will ride with your true love by  
Your side  
As far as any maiden in the areeo  
What will your mother say pretry Peggyo  
What will your mother say pretty Peggyo  
What will your mother say when she finds youve  
Gone away  
To places far and strange to Fanerio  
  
If ever I return pretty Peggyo  
If ever I return pretty Peggyo  
If ever I return all your cities I will burn  
Destroying all the ladies in the areeo  
Destroying all the ladies in the areeo
