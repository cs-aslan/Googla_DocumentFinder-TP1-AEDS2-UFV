Love and other moments  
Are just chemical reactions in your brain  
And feelings of aggression  
Are the absence of the love drug in your viens  
  
In your veins  
Love come quickly  
Because I feel my self esteem is caving in  
Its on the brink  
  
Love come quickly  
Because I dont think I can keep this monster in  
Its in my skin  
  
Love and other socially acceptable emotions are morphine  
Theyre morphine  
Cleverly concealing primal urges often felt but rarely seen  
Rarely seen  
  
Love I beg you  
Lift me up into that privileged point of view  
The world of two  
Love dont leave me  
  
Because I console myself that  
Hallmark cards are true  
I really do  
  
Im gunning down romance  
It never did a thing for me  
But heartache and misery  
Aint nothing but a tragedy  
  
Love dont leave me  
  
Take these broken wings  
Im going to take these broken wings  
And learn to fly  
And learn to fly away  
And learn to fly away  
  
Im gunning down romance
