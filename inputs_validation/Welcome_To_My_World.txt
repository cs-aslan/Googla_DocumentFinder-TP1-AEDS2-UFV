Welcome to my world  
Step right through the door  
Leave your tranquilizers at home  
You dont need them anymore  
  
All the drama queens have gone  
And the devil got dismayed  
He backed up and fled this town  
His master plan delayed  
  
And if you stay a while  
Ill penetrate your soul  
Ill bleed into your dreams  
Youll want to lose control  
Ill weep into your eyes  
Ill make your vision sing  
Ill open endless skies  
And ride your broken wings  
  
Welcome to my world  
Welcome to my world  
Welcome to my world  
  
Watch the sunrise set  
And the moon begin to blush  
Our naked innocence  
Translucently too much  
  
And I hold you in my arms  
I keep you by my side  
And we sleep the devils sleep  
Just to keep him satisfied  
  
And if you stay a while  
Ill penetrate your soul  
Ill bleed into your dreams  
Youll want to lose control  
Ill weep into your eyes  
Ill make your vision sing  
Ill open endless skies  
And ride your broken wings  
  
Welcome to my world  
Welcome to my world  
Welcome to my world
