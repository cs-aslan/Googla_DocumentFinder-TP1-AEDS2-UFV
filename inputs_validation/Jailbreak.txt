Tonight theres gonna be a jailbreak  
Somewhere in this town  
See me and the boys we dont like it  
So were getting up and going down  
  
Hiding low looking right to left  
If you see us coming I think its best  
To move away do you hear what I say  
From under my breath  
  
Tonight theres gonna be a jailbreak  
Somewhere in the town  
Tonight theres gonna be a jailbreak  
So dont you be around  
  
Dont you be around  
  
Tonight theres gonna be trouble  
Some of us wont survive  
See the boys and me mean business  
Bustin out dead or alive  
  
I can hear the hound dogs on my trail  
All hell breaks loose alarm and sirens wail  
Like the game if you lose  
Go to jail  
  
Tonight theres gonna be a jailbreak  
Somewhere in the town  
Tonight theres gonna be a jailbreak  
So dont you be around  
  
Tonight theres gonna trouble  
Im gonna find myself in  
Tonight theres gonna be a jailbreak  
So woman stay with a friend  
  
You know its safer  
  
Breakout  
  
Tonight theres gonna be a breakout  
Into the city zones  
Dont you dare to try and stop us  
No one could for long  
  
Searchlight on my trail  
Tonights the night all systems fail  
Hey you good lookin female  
Come here  
  
Tonight theres gonna be a jailbreak  
Somewhere in the town  
Tonight theres gonna be a jailbreak  
So dont you be around  
  
Tonight theres gonna be trouble  
Im gonna find myself in  
Tonight theres gonna be trouble  
So woman stay with a friend
