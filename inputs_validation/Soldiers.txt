Were on the corner every morning just to see you get across  
The civic fathers divide us up into cats and dogs  
The sergeant major of the neighbourhood is weighing up the cost  
The senior transit lane  
While were standing in the rain  
Worried if our head will fall  
Alright right  
Well stay together til the kids die just to keep it clean  
Buy the weapons with the sales made from garden magazines  
Strike up the ladies to bake tea cakes for the councils war machine  
And theyre digging up the roads  
And widening it just so  
You can suffocate at home  
Alright right  
The Prince of Wales tea  
To keep the garden green  
But they dont want to be there  
The shit cant be there  
You woke me up just to check that Im alive  
We talk to each other as if were five  
Raise open the flag just to see which of us cares  
And theyre digging up the roads  
And widening it just so  
You can suffocate at home  
Alright right  
Alright alright alright alright
