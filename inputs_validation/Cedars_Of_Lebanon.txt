Yesterday I spent asleep  
Woke up in my clothes in a dirty heap  
Spent the night trying to make a deadline  
Squeezing complicated lives into a simple headline  
I have your face in an old Polaroid  
Tidying the childrens clothes and toys  
You smiling back at me I took the photo from the fridge  
Cant remember what Emily did  
Havent been with a woman it feels like for years  
Thought of you the whole time your salty tears  
This shitty world sometimes produces a rose  
The scent of it lingers but then it just goes  
  
Return the call to home  
  
The worst of us are a long drawnout confession  
The best of us are geniuses of compression  
You say youre not gonna leave the truth alone  
Im here cause I dont wanna go home  
Child drinking dirty water from a riverbank  
Soldier brings oranges he got out from a tank  
Waiting on the waiter hes taking a while to come  
Watching the sun go down on Lebanon  
  
Return the call to home  
  
I got a head like a lit cigarette  
Unholy clouds reflect in a minaret  
So high above me higher than everyone  
Where are you in the cedars of Lebanon  
Choose your enemies carefully cause they will define you  
Make them interesting cause in some ways they will mind you  
Theyre not there in the beginning but when your story ends  
Gonna last with you longer than your friends
