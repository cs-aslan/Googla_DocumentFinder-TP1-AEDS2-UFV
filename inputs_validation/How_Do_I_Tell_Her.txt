How do I tell her that Im gonna wait  
When I know that shell be begging me to stay  
And how do I tell her that the time has come to part  
When shes shes gonna take it so hard

Cause I promised her forever  
That Ill be by her side  
  
So how do I tell her tell her goodbye  
Oh yeah  
  
How do I tell her that my path is gonna change  
When I know that her heart wont be able to stand the pain  
And how do I tell her that Im moving on with my life  
When shes just gonna break down and die  
Oh I dont wanna break her heart no

When I promised a girl forever Ill be by her side
