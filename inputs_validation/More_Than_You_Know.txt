Baby no more no  
Hmm  
  
This is how it happened  
I saw you  
My dream became reality  
The minute I was by myself  
Then you became a part of me  
Easy come easy go was in my mind  
I was holding on to the past  
Then I realized you were mine  
I knew that we were gonna match  
  
I wont let nobody try to turn me  
From loving you  
I am more than satisfied  
Nobody else is gonna do  
I wont let nobody in my business  
Its all about you  
If you want me here I am  
Cause Im here for you more than you know  
  
Stay with me  
Dont you go  
I love you tonight more than you know  
Stay with me  
Dont you go  
I love you tonight more than you know  
  
When I wonder how it wouldve been  
If I never met you  
I think about if for awhile  
Then I let it go cause I got you  
And my hearts so full of love  
I can not even breathe no  
Youre the air to my body  
Youre all that I need  
  
I wont let nobody try to turn me  
From loving you  
I am more than satisfied  
Nobody else is gonna do  
I wont let nobody in my business  
Its all about you  
If you want me here I am  
Cause Im here for you more than you know  
  
Stay with me  
Dont you go  
I love you tonight more than you know  
Stay with me  
Dont you go  
I love you tonight more than you know  
  
Your the pieces to my puzzle  
Without you Im incomplete  
The song to my melody  
Sweeter than honey  
If you add all the days of my life  
Multiply by the reasons I love you  
It couldnt measure up to  
How much I really need you  
  
I wont let nobody try to turn me  
From loving you  
I am more than satisfied  
Nobody else is gonna do  
I wont let nobody in my business  
Its all about you  
If you want me here I am  
Cause Im here for you more than you know  
  
Stay with me  
Dont you go  
I love you tonight more than you know  
Stay with me  
Dont you go  
I love you tonight more than you know
