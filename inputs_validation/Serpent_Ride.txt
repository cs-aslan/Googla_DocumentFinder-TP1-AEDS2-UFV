Upon the wings of a dream she rides  
Oh she comes to me fills me with life  
Towards the dark side of the moon we glide  
She sings me a tune on our way through the silvery starlight  
  
I dont wont to wake up this time  
Im alive on this serpent ride  
  
In the grace of our love we writhe in pain  
Farther into the song I fall mesmerized  
A drop of her blood tastes like wine  
I answer her call with a rhyme  
  
That is not dead which can eternal lie  
Yet with strange aeons death may die  
  
In your eyes lies the world where I dont wanna go  
You said youd changed but I dont believe in miracles  
Since you conquered my heart weve never been apart  
One day well close our eyes open them again  
And discover each other  
  
As I open up my eyes she greets me with a smile  
From her wrists flows wine
