Intro  
Theres a room in a hotel in New York City  
It shares our fate and deserves our pity  
I dont want to remember it all  
The promises are made if you just hold on  
Hold on hold on hold on hold on  
  
Verse 1  
I just need enough of you to dull the pain  
To get me through the night until were twins again  
Until were stripped down to our skeletons again  
Until were saints just swimming in our sins again  
  
PreChorus  
And theres a jet black crow droning on and on and on  
Up above our heads droning on and on and on  
Keep making trouble till you find what you love  
I need a new partner in crime and youre my shotgun  
  
Chorus  
Theres a room in a hotel in New York City  
It shares our fate and deserves our pity  
I dont want to remember it all  
The promises are made if you just hold on  
Hold on hold on hold on hold on  
  
Verse 2  
A birth and a death on the same day  
And honey I only appear so I can fade away  
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream  
And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame  
  
PreChorus  
And theres a jet black crow droning on and on and on  
Up above our heads droning on and on and on  
Hit it never quit it I have been through the wreck  
But I can scream enough to show my face in the light of day  
  
Bridge  
Theres a room in a hotel in New York City  
It shares our fate and deserves our pity  
I dont want to remember it all  
The promises are made if you just hold on  
Hold on hold on hold on hold on  
  
Outro  
Hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on  
Hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on
