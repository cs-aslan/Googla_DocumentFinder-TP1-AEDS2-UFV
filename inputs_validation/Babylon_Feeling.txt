My heart is broke my will is gone  
Fell in love with a woman named Babylon  
She hook me to the gills all of her forbidden thrills  
I call her baby for short then I ramble on  
Shell forget about me  
  
My soul is high my mind is free  
Met a shorty with some back call her Destiny  
She showed me all my fates my stream of conscious navigates  
I orbit around the sun at high velocity  
Dont forget about me dont forget about  
Sweet things wont you save my soul  
Pretty lady wont you take me home  
Pretty lady wont you take me home tonight  
  
My arms are heavy my bodys tense  
Got the hots for this honey named Confidence  
She points out all of my flaws breaking all of her favorite laws  
Never speaks a word in my defense just forget about me  
  
My spirits weak my lust will thrive  
Got a thing for this bitch said her names a lie  
She controls me with her fear my prayers fall on her cold deaf ear  
She says have a good time and take your dive  
Just forget about me just forget about  
Sweet things wont you save my soul yeah  
Pretty lady wont you take me home  
Sweet thing wont you save my soul yeah  
Pretty lady wont you take me hometonight
