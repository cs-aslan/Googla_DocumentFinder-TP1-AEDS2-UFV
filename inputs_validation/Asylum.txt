Our loves an asylum  
Where you and I go  
Our loves an asylum  
Where we go go go go crazy  
  
In a state of madness  
Wrapped up in your magic  
Ecstatic an addict  
Oh we landed on another planet  
And it feels like home here  
Will never go back there  
  
Cause were crazy Ill go crazy with you  
Youre so crazy Ill go crazy with you  
  
Our loves an asylum  
Where you and I go  
Our loves an asylum  
Where we go go go go go  
  
To the edge of reason  
Grow lose your mind when needed  
  
Our loves an asylum  
Where you and I go  
Our loves an asylum  
Where we go go go go crazy  
  
Cant nobody save me  
Ill go down with you baby  
Ill take you youll take me  
  
Crazy  Ill do crazy with you  
Lets go crazy Ill go crazy with you  
  
Our loves an asylum  
Where you and I go  
Our loves an asylum  
Where we go go go crazy
