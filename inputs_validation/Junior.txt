They call me Junior  
I live here on the street  
I earn two hundred dollars a week  
Id like to say  
Hey thanks a lot  
I know Im missin something  
But I dont know what it is  
That I dont got  
  
I sit here watchin  
The people down below  
I try to imagine  
The places they may go  
I dont know  
I stay home a lot  
I know Im missin something  
But I dont know what it is  
That I dont got  
  
I see the world through the TV Guide  
What a safe place for me to run  
What a small little man I am  
Im afraid of everything  
From golden rules to airplanes  
What a small little man I am  
  
They call me Junior  
Im caught up in this hell  
Sometimes I feel better  
But I never do feel well  
Jesus must have one hell of a plan for me  
I know Im missin something  
But I dont know what it is  
That I dont got  
  
And if I have anything to say  
About judgement day  
Therell be a crown in heaven  
For those who live this way  
Anyway  
You know exactly who you are  
  
I see the world through the TV Guide  
What a safe place for me to run  
What a small little man I am  
Im afraid of everything  
From the golden rule to airplanes  
What a small little man I am  
  
They call me Junior  
I live here on the street  
I earn two hundred dollars a week  
Id like to say  
Hey man thanks a lot  
My name is Junior  
  
I see the world through the TV Guide  
What a safe place for me to run  
What a small little man I am  
Im afraid of everything  
From the golden rule to airplanes  
What a small little man I am
