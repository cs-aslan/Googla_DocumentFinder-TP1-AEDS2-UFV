Uh feels good  
If it feels good dont even fight it man  
You know  
Yeah man  
Real Talk Of New York  
  
Its all eyes on me like Mr Shakur  
So they wanna pause the door  
Chicks come around and put kisses on the jaw  
So I aint a player that need assistance to score  
Any misses you saw  
Climb on the couch kicked off the Christian Dior  
I done popped till I sweat a Christ in a pore  
But I do it again if you missed it before  
Its no big deal  
Im so big wheel  
In them little cars with those big wheels  
With a little box full of those big steels  
Pretty little chicks in those big heels  
For me it never gets old  
Most girls is diggers who aint goin never hit gold  
I get under the sun when the weather get cold  
8 ball five when the seven gets old  
  
Hey hey stop that mama  
Cant you see that Im a East Coast stunna  
Hey hey you must misunderstand  
I dont spend all to bend that over  
Hey hey  
Why you lookin like that for  
Im done you can run no need for conversation  
Hey hey hey hey  
No need for conversation  
  
Now see you the type ta  
Get too hyper  
Maybe cause your chick like me  
But Im a black card swiper  
That just pipe her  
And you dont give a like me  
They say Im the sickest since Carter dropped  
So girls jump to it with Vince Carters hops  
Its the truck with the twenty inch startin stops  
That have em not knowin  
Whether they stayin or goin  
They stare at the Airs and be sayin it glowin  
And they like my style and the way I be flowin  
But thats when I bud in and say that Im blowin  
Now you could make the choice if you stayin or goin  
Girl  
We could go any place in the world  
And the jet hold twelve so theres space for ya girls  
Nobody in the street gonna hear  
That you givin forty thousand feet in the air  
  
Hey hey stop that mama  
Cant you see that Im a East Coast stunna  
Hey hey you must misunderstand  
I dont spend all to bend that over  
Hey hey  
Why you lookin like that for  
Im done you can run no need for conversation  
Hey hey hey hey  
No need for conversation  
  
Most of these tag a longs  
Brag on songs  
But cant keep it up like a Baget thong  
Keep frontin like you spend  
While ya pockets get lighter and lighter like Michaels skin  
On the other hand  
Im the kind of brother man  
With fifty thou of ice just up on the hand  
Bentley bright and rocky covered band  
And a zone thatll tell the time in another land  
Girls spread they legs same day I bagged em  
Its the Mustard Gut Mayo Magnum  
In the twenty twos with the butter knife shine  
Thats why every body and they mother like mine  
I rarely be  
Where the willies be  
There aint been a dude this smooth since Billy D  
Girl you need to make your move  
The ego is what pause the Lakers groove  
  
Hey hey stop that mama  
Cant you see that Im a East Coast stunna  
Hey hey you must misunderstand  
I dont spend all to bend that over  
Hey hey  
Why you lookin like that for  
Im done you can run no need for conversation  
Hey hey hey hey  
No need for conversation  
  
Hey hey stop that mama  
Cant you see that Im a East Coast stunna  
Hey hey you must misunderstand  
I dont spend all to bend that over  
Hey hey  
Why you lookin like that for  
Im done you can run no need for conversation  
Hey hey hey hey  
No need for conversation
