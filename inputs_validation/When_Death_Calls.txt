He saw the world dim with the glow of the vertical sun  
His skin crept cold knowing that this was the hours of dying  
Misguided mortals youll burn with me  
Spirit of man cannot be freed  
  
When Death Calls  This is the hours of dying  
When Death Calls  The spirit of man cannot be freed  
When Death Calls  Theres no tomorrow  
When Death Calls  Just an evil shadow  
  
Tell me not fear of the flames means that heaven is closer  
For I believe Satan lives in the souls of the dying  
Misguided mortals youll burn with me  
Spirit of man cannot be freed  
  
When Death Calls  Heaven is closer  
When Death Calls  Feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying  
When Death Calls  here it comes here it comes here it comes  
When Death Calls  Youre gonna burn  
  
Dont look in those sunken eyes  
Dont look and youll stay alive  
Dont laugh at the face of death or your toungue will blister  
Cant die until Satan says you die  
And Satan takes your soul  
In the face of death or your toungue will blister  
  
Dont look in those sunken eyes  
Dont look and youll stay alive  
Dont laugh at the face of death or your toungue will blister  
Cant die until Satan says you die  
The Devil takes your soul  
With all his wrath he calls the reaper  
  
When Death Calls  This is the hours of dying  
When Death Calls  The spirit of man cannot be freed  
When Death Calls  Theres no tomorrow  
When Death Calls  Just an evil shadow  
When Death Calls  Feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying  
When Death Calls  Youre gonna burn burn burn  
When Death Calls  Heaven is closer  
When Death Calls  I can feel it gonna take you down
