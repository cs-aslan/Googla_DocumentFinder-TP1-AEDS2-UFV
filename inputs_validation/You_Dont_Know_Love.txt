Verse 1  
I dont wanna be your lover  
I dont wanna be your fool  
Pick me up whenever you want it  
Throw me down when you are trough  
Cause Ive learned more from whats missing  
Its about me and not about you  
I know I made some bad decisions  
But my last one was you  
  
Next to you are those lies lies lies  
How it feels when love dies dies dies  
And you told me googbye bye bye  
I dont know when its over when its over  
  
Chorus  
You dont know love til it tears up your heart  
And cuts it and leaves you with scars  
Youre still feeling  
You dont know love  
You dont know love  
  
Verse 2  
You say I can do it better  
Better than someone like you  
What I feel cant write in a letter  
So I wrote this for you  
  
Next to you are those lies lies lies  
How it feels when love dies dies dies  
And you told me goodbye bye bye  
I dont know when its over when its over  
  
Chorus  
You dont know love til it tears up your heart  
And cuts it and leaves you with scars  
Youre still feeling  
You dont know love  
You dont know love  
  
You dont know love til it feels like you died when its missing  
It leaves you blind with no vision  
You dont know love  
You dont know love  
  
Bridge  
You you you you  
You wont ever get no better  
You you you you  
Got a lot more to lose  
You you you you  
You wont ever ever get it  
You dont know love  
You dont know love  
You dont know love  
  
Chorus  
You dont know love til it tears up your heart  
And cuts it and leaves you with scars  
Youre still feeling  
You dont know love  
You dont know love  
  
You dont know love til it feels like you died when its missing  
It leaves you blind with no vision  
You dont know love  
You dont know love  
  
You dont know love
