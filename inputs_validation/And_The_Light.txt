So many years have come and gone since then  
Still I cant forget the past  
But you and me well surelt meet again  
And maybe find the truth at last  
  
And the light in the night  
Shines on brightly  
If its alright with you  
Its alright with me  
  
Well I believe that fate will find a way  
To guide us through these restless years  
And yes I know that well speak one day  
With no more doubts and no more fears  
  
And the light   
  
So tell me now if you can share my view  
Tell me where your comin from  
Weve both had time time to think it through  
To know just where we both belong  
  
And the light   
  
And if your heart is real  
Then tell me how you feel  
Til Im saying  
If its alright with you  
Its alright with me  
Its quite alright with me  
Its all alright with me
