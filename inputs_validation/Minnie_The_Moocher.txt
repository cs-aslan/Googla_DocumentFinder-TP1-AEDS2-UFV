Heres a story about Minnie the Moocher  
She was a low down hoochiecoocher  
She was the roughest toughest frail  
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale  
  
Original Chorus  
Hodeehodeehodeeho hodeehodeehodeeho  
Radeedadeeda radeedadeeda  
Teedleteedledee teedleteedledee  
Hodeehodeehodeeho hodeehodeehodeeho  
  
Min had a dream about the King of Sweden  
He gave her things that she was needin  
Gave her a home built of gold and steel  
A platinum car with diamond starlet wheels  
  
Variations on Chorus  
  
Oh Minnie met ol Deacon Lowdown  
He preached to her oh you oughta slow down  
But Minnie wiggled and did the stroll  
The Deacon Lowdown hollered oh save my soul  
  
Variations on Chorus  
  
They took her where they put the crazies  
Now poor ol Minnie is akickin up daisies  
You heard my story this ends my song  
She was just a good gal but they done her wrong
