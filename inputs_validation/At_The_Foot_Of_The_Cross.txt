They were watching from a distance  
And they could not take their eyes from You  
You were bleeding they were weeping  
Faithful sisters they had followed You  
  
They did not understand they could not see  
They were mourning their loss  
As the sky turned black and the Earth turned red  
At the foot of the Cross  
  
He was standing near Your mother  
They were so close they could hear You sighing  
All around them angry voices  
Pierced the darkness and You were dying  
  
But they would not leave they lingered there  
No matter the cost  
They were staying and they were praying  
At the foot of the Cross  
  
Keep me near the Cross near the Cross  
May I never stray so far  
That I cannot see what flowed down for me  
At the foot of the Cross  
  
Now Im standing in Your presence  
And I cannot take my eyes from You  
You have risen Im forgiven  
Precious Saviour oh I worship You  
  
No Im not looking back  
Ive heard Your voice and Im staying here  
Ive made my choice for now its real  
Now I kneel at the foot of the Cross  
  
Keep me near the Cross near the Cross  
May I never stray so far  
That I cannot see what flowed down for me  
At the foot of the Cross  
  
Keep me near the Cross near the Cross  
May I never stray so far  
That I cannot see what flowed down for me  
At the foot of the Cross
