Well sometimes  
It seems you just dont understand  
The way I think and who I am  
And when Im  
Im told what Im supposed to be  
You think you know whats best for me  
  
Well I want to see you standing next to me now  
Seems youve got nothing much to say  
And when youre dying lying next to me now  
Ill turn my head and walk away  
  
Sometimes  
It seems I might be losing touch  
Or maybe I just try to much  
Now I  
Now I get told Im crazy  
Nothing you could say would phase me now  
  
I want to see you standing next to me now  
Seems youve got nothing much to say  
And when youre dying lying next to me now  
Ill turn my head and walk away  
  
Hey  
  
I walk alone  
My thoughts arent always carved in stone  
My life revolves according to me  
And what you think dont mean a fucking thing to me  
Yeah youll see  
Ill make it farther on my own  
  
Well I want to see you standing next to me now  
Seems youve got nothing much to say  
And when youre dying lying next to me now  
Ill turn my head and walk away  
I want to see you standing next to me now  
Seems youve got nothing much to say  
And when youre dying lying next to me now  
Ill turn my head and walk away
