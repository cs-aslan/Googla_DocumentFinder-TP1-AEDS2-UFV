Mother natures been good to me  
Thats why Im sittin in this cherry tree  
But its alright its alright  
Its not so bad  
Im just a touch away  
  
The shady lady  
From shady lane  
Is lying in my bed again  
And its alright  
It feels good  
Its not so bad  
When shes just a touch away  
  
Nothing much  
Is all I ask  
And its alright OK yes  
Light as a feather oh yes  
  
Like a rosebud  
When the sun is high  
She opens up  
Before my eyes  
And the light falls  
On her wet skin  
Its alright  
Im just a touch away  
  
Nothing much  
Is all I know  
And its alright oh yes  
Light as a feather  
And just a touch away  
  
Put a finger to her lips again  
She cries with pleasure  
Cries with pain  
And its alright  
It feels good  
Its not so bad  
Were just a touch away  
  
Nothing much  
Is all I know  
Not too fast  
Not too slow  
And its alright  
Soft as a feather  
And just a touch away
