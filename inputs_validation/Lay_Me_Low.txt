Theyre gonna lay me low Lay me low  
Theyre gonna sink me in the snow  
Theyre gonna throw back their heads and crow  
When I go  
Theyre gonna jump and shout Lay me low  
Theyre gonna wave their arms about  
All the stories will come out  
When I go  
All the stars will glow bright Lay me low  
And my friends will give up the fight  
Theyll see my work in a different light  
When I go  
Theyll try telephoning my mother Lay me low  
But theyll end up getting my brother  
Wholl spill the story on some longgone lover  
That I hardly know  
Hats off to the man  
On top of the world  
Come crawl up here baby  
And Ill show you how it works  
If you wanna be my friend  
And you wanna repent  
And you want it all to end  
And you wanna know when  
Well do it now dont care how  
Take your final bow  
Make a stand Take my hand  
And blow it all to hell  
They gonna inform the police chief Lay me low  
Wholl breathe a sigh of relief  
Hell say I was a malanderer a badlander and a thief  
When I go  
They will interview my teachers Lay me low  
Wholl say I was one of Gods sorrier creatures  
Therell print informative sixpage features  
When I go  
Theyll bang a big old gong Lay me low  
The motorcade will be ten miles long  
The world will join together for a farewell song  
When they put me down below  
Theyll sound a fluegelhorn Lay me low  
And the sea will rage and the sky will storm  
All man and beast will mourn  
When I go  
Hats off to the man  
On top of the world  
Come crawl up here baby  
And we can watch this damn thing turn  
If you wanna be my friend  
And you wanna repent  
And you want it all to end  
And you wanna know when  
Well do it now Do it now  
Take a long last bow  
Take my hand Make a stand  
And blow it all to hell  
Lay me low  
When I go
