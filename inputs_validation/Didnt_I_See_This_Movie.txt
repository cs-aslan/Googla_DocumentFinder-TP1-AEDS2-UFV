Diana  
Didnt I see this movie  
With Mcmurphy and the nurse  
That hospital was heavy  
But this cuckoos nest is worse  
And isnt this the one where  
In the end the good guys fry  
Didnt I see this movie  
And didnt I cry  
Didnt I cry  
  
Doctor Madden Spoken  
The modern procedures clean and simple The electricity  
Required is barely enough to light a hundredwatt bulb  
  
Diana  
What makes you think  
Id lose my mind for you  
Im no sociopath  
Im no Sylvia Plath  
I aint no Frances Farmer  
Kind of find for you  
So stay out of my brain  
Im no princess of pain  
  
Didnt I see this movie  
Where the doctor looked like you  
Where the patient got impatient  
And said sorry doc Im through  
I know where this is going  
And I know what youre about  
Cause I have seen this movie  
And I walked out  
I walked out  
Im walking
