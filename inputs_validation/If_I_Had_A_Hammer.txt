If I had a hammer Id hammer in the morning  
Id hammer in the evening all over this land  
Id hammer out danger Id hammer out a warning  
Id hammer out love between my brothers and my sisters ah ah all over this
land  
If I had a bell Id ring it in the morning Id ring it in the evening all over
this land  
Id ring out danger Id ring out a warning  
Id ring out love between my brothers and my sisters ah ah all over this land
yeah  
If I had a song Id sing it in the morning Id sing it in the evening all over
this land  
Id sing out danger Id sing out a warning  
Id sing out love between my brothers and my sisters ah ah all over this land  
Well Ive got a hammer and Ive got a bell  
And Ive got a song to sing all over this land  
Its a hammer of justice its a bell of freedom  
Its a gonna be about love between my brothers and my sisters ah ah all over
this land  
Well Ive got a hammer and Ive got a bell
