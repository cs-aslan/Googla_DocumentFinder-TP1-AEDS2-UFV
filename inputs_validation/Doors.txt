Doors why do there have to be doors  
Coz when you walked right out that door of mine  
It made me wonder why there are tears  
Where is the end to all these tears  
Wheres the face that use to cheer me up  
Girl that makes me wonder  
Why does my hear tjust keep on beating  
Why do my arms just keep on reaching  
To someone whos no longer there  
  
What can I say besides Im sorry  
What can I say to change your mind  
What can I do to make tomorrow yours and mine  
  
Chairs  
Why do there have to be chairs  
It shows its empty now  
Theres no one there  
It really makes me wonder  
  
Why does my heart just keep on beating  
Why do my arms just keep on reaching  
For someone whos no longer there  
  
What can I say besides Im sorry  
What can I say to changed your mind  
Why do I keep on holding on  
A chance youll walk back through the door  
When my heart knows theres no hope anymore  
Why do there have to be doors2x
