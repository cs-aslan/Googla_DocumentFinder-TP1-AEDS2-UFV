Well this is my last connection  I been slowing up the line  
Aint no satisfaction in this troubled head of mine  
Gotta get back to the highway  gonna get back to where I know  
cause sooner or later theres gonna be a showdown   
Gotta go man gotta go  
  
Hell Im so so tired  so so tired  
And I dont know where Im gonna start  
Its only heavy breathing in the dark  
  
Aint nobodys sweetheart aint nobodys fool  
And if the sun dont set on my house babe  
Id be the last man to blow my cool  
I feel my body shake  
Well theres so much left to say  
Spend my life anticipatin  
Gonna find a way  
  
Hey Im so so tired  so so tired  
And I dont know where Im gonna start  
Its only heavy breathing in the dark  
  
So so tired  
So so tired  
And I dont know where Im gonna start  
Only heavy breathing in the dark  
Only heavy breathing in the dark  
Its only heavy breathing in the dark  
  
Well I dont believe in evrything you say just to save my soul  
You know theres got to be a way better than a big black hole  
Gotta take me from my suicide  
Now you know its love I crave  
You know we got to live like this from the cradle to the grave  
  
So so so so tired  
So so so so tired  
Im so so so so tired  
  
repeat last verse and fade
