I ate it and at once my eyes could see you  
No sooner had I ooped it down  
I felt so far off from the ground I stood on  
My legs seemed to me like highrise buildings  
My head was high up in the sky  
My skin the sun began to fry like bacon  
And then somebody old appeared and asked had I come far  
And hadnt they just seen me up on Haleakala  
I kept on body surfing to pretend I hadnt heard  
There was someone there beside me swimming like Richard III  
And Im still smiling  
Seven naked native girls swam seven sacred pools  
Loneranger smoking doobies said youre breaking all the rules  
Better get your clothes on or else therell be a row  
If it wasnt for my sunstroke I would take you on right now  
And Im still smiling  
I fell in love with my softhearted Hana  
She entered right in through my heart  
And now although were miles apart  
I still feel her  
She lives beneath the crater in the meadow  
She moves among the fruit and grain  
You can meet her after heavy rain has fallen
