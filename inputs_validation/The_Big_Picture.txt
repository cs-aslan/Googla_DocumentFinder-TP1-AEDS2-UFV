Going round the world  
Dont know where were going  
We dont even care  
But you just cant be from someplace else  
Unless you go somewhere  
And were in the same boat  
So as long as it floats  
We might as well stop n stare  
At the big picture  
The big picture repeat  
Get the BIIIIIIIIIIIg picture  
  
Were almost there  
Were gonna keep on going  
til that new age dawns  
Always keeping an eye on the stars in the sky  
In case one starts to fall  
And were in the same boat  
As the ones who cant float  
So they might freak out and sink us all  
And miss the big picture  
going round the world  
The big picture  
got to get it now  
Like a fish in the water  
You dont know where youve been  
til you jump out and take a look around  
At the BIIIIIIIIIg picture
