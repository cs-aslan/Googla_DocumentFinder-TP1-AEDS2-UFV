Feel the cold wind blowingwinters coming on  
Tis the season so they say  
If you need help believing cause your spirit aint too strong  
Hold my handwell push that cloud away  
  
Put a little holiday in your heart  
Itll put a little shuffle in your step  
Give you a song that you can sing  
With a melody you cant forget  
And if you want to join in a little harmony  
To keep the world from tearin apart  
Well you know where to look  
Yeahyou gotta put a little holiday in your heart  
  
Theres a man on the corner who doesnt have a name  
People pass and turn their heads away  
But to share a simple kindness would set your heart aflame  
And youll get more than youll ever give away  
  
Put a little holiday in your heart  
Itll put a little shuffle in your step  
Give you a song that you can sing  
With a melody you cant forget  
And if you want to join in a little harmony  
To keep the world from tearin apart  
Well you know where to look  
Yeahyou gotta put a little holiday in your heart  
  
It starts with you it starts with me  
That aint no stranger hes family and it dont matter if we agree  
It all comes down to love  
  
Put a little holiday in your heart  
Itll put a little shuffle in your step  
Give you a song that you can sing  
With a melody you cant forget  
And if you want to join in a little harmony  
To keep the world from tearin apart  
Well you know where to look  
Yeahyou gotta put a little holiday in your heart
