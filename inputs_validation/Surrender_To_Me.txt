Is that what weve been together much too long  
The answer may not be in black and white  
  
Were always trying to prove whos right or wrong  
Yet know were giving up without a fight  
  
But I know when youre gone  
Ill wish Id held on  
  
Chorus  
So baby surrender to me  
Therell be no holding back now  
So baby surrender to me tonight  
  
I dont want our love to cause you so much pain  
If this is how its going to be Ill walk away  
  
Neither one of us should ever say goodbye  
Lets forget about the past and whos to blame  
  
cause when this is all gone  
Well wish wed held on  
  
Chorus  
  
How could this love be in danger  
That used to be so good so right  
To think that fate could make us strangers  
Has thrown me in your arms tonight  
  
Chorus
