Things I learned in a hobo jungle  
Were things they never taught me in a class room  
Like where to find a handout  
While thumbing through Chicago in the afternoon  
  
Hey Im not bragging or complaining  
Im just talking to myself man to man  
This old mental fat Im chewing  
Didnt take alot of doing  
But I take alot of pride in what I am  
  
I guess I grew up a loner  
Dont remember ever having any folks around  
But I keep thumbing through the phonebooks  
And looking for my Daddys name in every town  
  
And I meet lots of people  
But I always end up leaving on the lam  
Hey where Ive been where Im going  
I didnt take alot of knowing  
But I take alot of pride in what I am  
  
I never travel in a hurry  
Cause I got nobody waiting for me anywhere  
Home is anywhere Im living  
If its sleeping on some vacant beach or city square  
Or if Im working on some road gang  
Or just living off the fat of our great land  
I never been nobodys idol but at least I have a title  
And I take alot of pride in what I am  
  
This old mental fat Im chewing  
Didnt take alot of doing  
I take alot of pride in what I am
