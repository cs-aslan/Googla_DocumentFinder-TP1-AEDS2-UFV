Put down your chainsaw and listen to me  
Its time for us to join in the fight  
Its time to let your babies grow up to be cowboys  
Its time to let the bedbugs bite  
  
You better put all your eggs in one basket  
You better count your chickens before they hatch  
You better sell some wine before its time  
You better find yourself an itch to scratch  
  
You better squeeze all the Charmin you can while Mr Whipples not around  
Stick your head in the microwave and get yourself a tan  
  
Talk with your mouth full  
Bite the hand that feeds you  
Bite on more than you chew  
What can you do  
Dare to be stupid  
  
Take some wooden nickles  
Look for Mr Goodbar  
Get your mojo working now  
Ill show you how  
You can dare to be stupid  
  
You can turn the other cheek  
You can just give up the ship  
You can eat a bunch of sushi and forget to leave a tip  
  
Dare to be stupid  
Come on and dare to be stupid  
Its so easy to do  
Dare to be stupid  
Were all waiting for you  
Lets go  
  
Its time to make a mountain out of a molehill  
So can I have a volunteer  
Theres no more time for crying over spilled milk  
Now its time for crying in your beer  
  
Settle down raise a family join the PTA  
Buy some sensible shoes and a Chevrolet  
And party till youre broke and they drive you away  
Its OK you can dare to be stupid  
  
Its like spitting on a fish  
Its like barking up a tree  
Its like I said you gotta buy one if you want to get one free  
  
Dare to be stupid yes  
Why dont you dare to be stupid  
Its so easy to do  
Dare to be stupid  
Were all waiting for you  
Dare to be stupid  
  
Burn your candle at both ends  
Look a gift horse in the mouth  
Mashed potatoes can be your friends  
  
You can be a coffee achiever  
You can sit around the house and watch Leave It To Beaver  
The futures up to you  
So what you gonna do  
  
Dare to be stupid  
Dare to be stupid  
What did I say  
Dare to be stupid  
Tell me what did I say  
Dare to be stupid

We can be stupid all night  
Dare to be stupid

Dare to be stupid  
Shout it out loud
