Dont go saying Im leaving you  
Thinking I never got close enough to stay  
Time runs in and then runs out  
Starts again and its always been that way  
Youre gonna drown tomorrow  
If you cry to many tears for yesterday  
Tomorrows half of all youve got  
So treat him good cause when Im gone hell stay  
  
I wont be forgetting you  
You wont be forgetting me I know  
If memory comes a summer cloud  
Rains her sweetness down to me below  
I see you like you look right now  
Maybe wonder why I had to go  
But heaven is the way she is  
Rain falls and rivers flow  
  
So heres to feelin good  
Heres to feelin bad  
Heres to bein thankful  
Sorry for the pleasures that we had  
And autumn days and window panes  
God forgive us if you feel deceived  
The clock dont know you like I do  
And its only him or me you got to believe
