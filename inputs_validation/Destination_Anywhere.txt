J Bon jovi  
  
Hey babe its me parked outside your house  
I know that hes asleep so listen to me now  
Darlin Im tired of living just in your dreams  
Im getting out  
You know we both sold our souls  
Were just growing old in this sleepy deadend town  
  
Destination anywhere  
Name the place and Ill be there  
Pack a bag a were out of here  lets run  
  
Baby we both been running uphill for too long  
We both settled for something got nothing  
And we both know its wrong  
Go on admit it we lived it Im leaving   
Get your boots and come on  
I got my coat and my keys I need you next to me then Im gone  
  
Destination anywhere  
Name the place and Ill be there  
Pack a bag a were out of here  lets run  
Destination anywhere  
Left of right I dont care  
Maybe well just disappear like the sun  
  
When these wheels spin they can all eat our dust  
As far as Im concerned this whole towns lost  
Its nuts  
We wont be here when they put us down  
Its our big chance and Im calling you now  
Theyll never let us go unless we try  
Im tired of living just to die  
Were getting out of here destination anywhere  
  
Destination anywhere  
Name the place and Ill be there  
Pack a bag a were out of here  lets run  
Destination anywhere  
Left of right I dont care  
Maybe well just disappear like the sun come on come on come on
