Time can heal a broken heart  
Oh but does it really ease the mind  
I know its hard for you  
Though you say that youre not longing for my touch  
I know it pains you much  
Whats wrong baby  
Whats on your mind  
Did you leave a piece of love behind  
Whats wrong baby  
What is on your mind  
Did you leave a piece of love behind  
Night begins with calls from you  
Oh asking me if Im alright  
Im really not sure baby  
Im wondering if your love for me has gone away  
Like I heard you say  
Whats wrong baby  
Whats on your mind  
Did you leave a piece of love behind  
Whats wrong baby  
What is on your mind  
Did you leave a piece of love behind  
Its hard to say  
Weve made mistakes  
But when its not over  
Its best to put pride away  
Two eyes should not cry the tears of regret  
Cause two lips wont let go of an age old lovers lie  
Oh baby oh oh  
Whats wrong baby  
Whats on your mind  
Did you leave a piece of love behind  
Whats wrong baby  
What is on your mind  
Did you leave a piece of love behind  
Id do anything for you  
I will give you all my heart  
Did you leave a piece of love behind  
Oh did you leave your love behind
