Well well  
I really really really really really really like girls  
Yeah I really really really really really really like girls  
I like girls 3x  
I like the way that they giggle  
When they walk up and ask you to dance  
I like the way that they wiggle  
Wrapped up in the skin tight pants  
They got style  
They got smiles  
They drive me wild  
Yeah I really really really really really really like girls  
Yes I really really really really really really like girls  
I like them small  
I like em tall  
I like em all  
Now it dont bother me  
If a girl dont know how to cope  
Because the things that they know  
How to do cant be learned in a book  
They got smarts  
They got hearts  
They got my heart  
Thats why I really really really really really really like girls  
Yeah I really really really really really really like girls  
I want em small  
I want em tall  
I want em all  
Every day in every way theyre here to stay  
Theyre really really neat  
Theyre really sweet  
Theyre real petite  
I like girls
