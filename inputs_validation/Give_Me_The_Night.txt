Simple dreams and crazy schemes  
All cant come true  
Hear what Im saying  
My love is with you  
This fire between us  
If only you might  
Give me the night tonight  
  
Give me the night  
My hearts on ice  
Come to me care for me  
Sing to me share with me  
Give me the night tonight  
  
Oh boulevards of broken dreams  
Now dont be depressed oh  
Now were together  
And were riding the crest  
Im full of your passion  
And you know the rest  
So give me the night tonight  
  
Give me the night  
My hearts on ice  
Come to me care for me  
Sing to me share with me  
Give me the night tonight  
Ooh night yes night is better  
Oh having you than having night  
Oh our life our life together  
Oh it fills me with joy that wont stop  
  
Give me the night  
My hearts on ice  
Come to me care for me  
Sing to me share with me  
Give me the night tonight  
  
Ooh hoo my hearts on ice  
  
Oh come to me care for me  
Sing to me share with me  
Give me the night tonight  
Ooh hoo my hearts on ice  
Ah come to me care for me  
Ooh ah ha  
Give me the night tonight
