Its hard to breathe from underneath  
Smothering in all your heat  
Its hard to take Its tough to break  
So I dont make the same mistakes  
  
The same mistake 4x  
  
Out in the yard is where I play  
Dont come in cause Im afraid  
You saw my face I faced my friends  
Do I tell or just pretend  
I found a friend a friend who knows  
Who says hell help but then he goes  
  
And then he goes 4x  
  
In front of me In front of me so far from me yeah yeah  
Im in the way the way it goes so go away yeah yeah  
In front of me In front of me so far from me yeah yeah  
  
Fingernails filled with dirt  
If you dont tell you dont get hurt  
I cry for help I pray to God  
Another tear he tries to rob  
To rob me of my dignity  
Cause sanctuarys far from me  
  
Far from me 4x  
  
In front of me In front of me so far from me yeah yeah  
Im in the way the way it goes so go away yeah yeah  
Its hard to take a piece of me so peacefully yeah yeah  
In front of me In front of me so far from me yeah yeah  
  
So broke inside dont run away  
And find another place to stay  
And make our inhibition go away  
Because Im so afraid yeah yeah  
  
Its hard to breathe from underneath  
Smothering in all your heat  
Its hard to take Its tough to break  
So I dont make the same mistakes  
  
In front of me In front of me so far from me yeah yeah  
Im in the way the way it goes so go away yeah yeah  
Its hard to take a piece of me so peacefully yeah yeah  
In front of me In front of me so far from me yeah yeah
