Verse 1  
What do you got  
Mass produced in somewhere hot  
Youll have to go on the Underground  
To get things done here  
And then you have  
 service done  
This is a place to come to or well it was  
I know a hot spot  
Crossing on the guillotine  
  
Chorus  
And if you have nobody left to rely on  
Ill hold you in my arms and let you drift  
Its got to be that time again  
And you you will be over soon again  
  
Verse 2  
So get yourself up get past  on your way  
Theres nothing to be ashamed of  
Taking off again  
The 514 to East Grinstead  
Youve set me off  
  
And talking types will let us down  
Talk talk on your arse all night  
You wanna be there  
  
Bridge  
Step inside the tarmac ride  
To the land that time forgot  
Oh were just gonna go there  
Cracks inside the tarmac ride  
To the land that crime forgot oh no  
  
Outro  
And if you have nobody left to rely on  
Ill hold you in my arms and let you drift  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Lonesome Street  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Lonesome Street  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Lonesome Street
