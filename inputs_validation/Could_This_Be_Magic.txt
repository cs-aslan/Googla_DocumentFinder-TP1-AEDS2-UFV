Out upon the islands on a cool summer night  
Buddy you dont got to hurry Take your time  
What you need is on the menu and you get it tonight  
Buddy you got womens on your mind  
Could this be magic  
Or could this be love  
Could this turn tragic  
You know that magic often does  
And I see lonely ships upon the water  
Better save the women and children first  
Sail away with someones daughter  
Better save the women and children first  
I hear music on the landin and theres laughter in the air  
Just could be your boat is comin in  
Yeah youre leanin back and your foots tappin and you got your head
right  
Theres a full moon out tonight Baby lets begin  
Could this be magic  
Or could this be love  
Could this turn tragic  
You know that magic often does  
And I see lonely ships upon the water  
Better save the women and children first  
Sail away with someones daughter  
Better save the women and children first
