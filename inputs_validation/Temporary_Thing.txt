Cant help it now baby  
You better make your face get out of here quick  
Maybe your ass was getting aah too rich  
It aint like we aint never seen this thing before  
And if it turns you then around  
Then you better hit the door  
But I know its just a temporary thing  
Ooh yeah its just a temporary thing  
  
Youve read too many books  
Youve seen too many plays  
And its things like this that turn you away  
Hey hey now now look ha look  
Hey look hey look hey look you better think about it twice  
I know that your good breeding makes it seem not so nice  
Its just a temporary thing  
Aha aha aha its just a temporary thing  
  
Wheres the number wheres the dime and wheres the phone  
I feel like a stranger  
I guess you want to go back home  
Your mother your father your brother  
I guess you wouldnt agree with me  
But I dont give two shits theyre no better than me  
  
Aha its just a temporary thing oh yeah been there before  
Just a temporary thing oh yeah been there before  
Ahh bitch get of my temporary thing  
Get out its just a temporary thing
