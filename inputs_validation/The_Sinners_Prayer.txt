Lord Youve touched my heart today  
That is why Ive come to pray  
You see all I have inside  
All the things I try to hide  
Jesus I believe that You are there  
And Youre listening to this sinners prayer  
Touch this broken heart and make it new  
I believe in You  
Please forgive me for my sin  
All Ive done and all Ive been  
Serving You forevermore  
Everyday Youll be my Lord  
Jesus I believe that You are there  
And Youre listening to this sinners prayer  
Knowing Youll remember what Youve heard  
I believe Your word  
In Your name this prayer will end  
And a new life will begin  
Now I know Im not alone  
Hold my hand and lead me home
