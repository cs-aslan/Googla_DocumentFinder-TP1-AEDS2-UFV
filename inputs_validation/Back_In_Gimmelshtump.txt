Dr Doofenshmirtz Back in Gimmelschtump  
I always had to keep it real  
Cause when you grow up in Gimmelshtump  
Young Heinz Your childhood is less than ideal  
Dr Doofenshmirtz So I dont dwell on how Ill crawled my way out of the
gutter  
No I dont  
When people ask me what I mean I say  
DDDDo I stutter  
  
Dr Doofenshmirtz But Im no longer a hater  
Cause I got an Inator  
And a overcomplicated scheme  
I get a couple of checks  
Every month from my Ex  
So I can finance my coming regime  
  
And though my past was a wreck  
I wont let it affect  
My aspirations to cause mass hysteria  
Cause Im as sure as can be  
That its my destiny  
To be the ruler of the TriState Area
