What in this world feels so alive  
Makes us then breaks us then helps us survive  
Buries our hopes then revives our desire to succeed  
Were all greed  
Who in this world sees when I cry  
Throws me then shows me that Im justified  
Measure my worth then decide that Im not what they need  
Theyve agreed  
Where in this world can I hide  
Where can I find someone  
That sees me inside to confide  
How in this world can I go on  
Wondering if youll think of me when Im gone  
Shielding my eyes from the pitiless light of the glare  
Should you care  
When in this world is it enough  
I never thought it could be quite this rough  
Living my life as if millions of people dont stare  
Theyre not there  
Why should I have to defend or derive  
Most of the rules of the game Ive defied  
Though its been hard on my pride  
Its been one hell of a ride  
Curiously  
I didnt set out to be famous
