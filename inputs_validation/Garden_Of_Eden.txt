Its a critical solution  
And the east coast got the blues  
Its a mass of confusion  
Like the lies they sell to you  
  
You got a glass jawed toothache  
Of a mental disease  
An they be runnin round back  
See em line up on their knees  
Cause the kiss ass sycophants  
Throwin penance at your feet  
  
When they got nowhere to go  
Watch em come in off the streets  
While theyre bangin out front  
Inside their slammin to the cruch  
Go on an throw me to the lions  
And the whole damn screamin bunch  
Cause the pissedoff ripoffs  
Are everywhere you turn  
Tell me how a generations  
Ever sposed to learn  
This fire is burnin  
And its out of control  
Its not a problem you can stop  
Its rock n roll  
  
I read it on a wall  
It went straight to my head  
It said Dance to the tension  
Of a world on edge  
We got racial violence  
And wholl cast the first stone  
And sex is used anyway it can be  
Sometimes when I look out  
Its hard to see the day  
Its a feelin you can have it  
Its not mine to take away  
  
Lost in the garden of Eden  
Said were lost in the garden of Eden  
And theres no ones gonna believe this  
But were lost in the garden of Eden  
This fire is burnin  
And its out of control  
Its not a problem you can stop  
Its rock n roll  
Suck on that  
  
Looking through this point of view  
Theres no way Im gonna fit in  
Dont ya tell me what my eyes see  
Dont ya tell me who to believe in  
I aint superstitious  
But I know when somethins wrong  
Ive been draggin my heels  
With a bitch called hope  
Let the undercurrent drag me along  
  
Lost in the garden of Eden  
Said were lost in the garden of Eden  
And theres no ones gonna believe this  
But were lost in the garden of Eden  
  
Most organized religions make  
A mockery of humanity  
Our governments are dangerous  
And out of control  
The garden of Eden is just another graveyard  
Said if they had someone to buy it  
Said Im sure theyd sell my soul  
  
This fire is burnin  
And its out of control  
Its not a problem you can stop  
Its rock n roll  
Lost in the garden of Eden  
An we aint talkin about no poison apple or some missin rib ya hear  
Said were lost in the garden of Eden  
And theres no ones gonna believe this  
Said were lost in the garden of Eden  
This fire is burnin  
And its out of control  
Its not a problem you can stop  
Its rock n roll
