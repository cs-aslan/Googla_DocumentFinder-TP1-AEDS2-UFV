Did you forget  
That I was even alive  
Did you forget  
Everything we ever had  
Did you forget  
Did you forget  
Bout me  
  
Did you regret  
Ever standing by my side  
Did you forget  
What we were feeling inside  
Now Im left to forget  
About us  
  
Chorus  
But somewhere we went wrong  
We were once so strong  
Our love is like a song  
You cant forget it  
  
So now I guess  
This is where we have to stand  
Did you regret  
Ever holding my hand  
Never again  
Please dont forget  
Dont forget  
  
We had it all  
We were just about to fall  
Even more in love  
Than we were before  
I wont forget  
I wont forget  
About us  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
At all  
  
And at last  
All the pictures have been burned  
And all the past  
Is just a lesson that weve learned  
I wont forget  
Please dont forget about us  
  
But somewhere we went wrong  
Our love is like a song  
But you wont sing along  
Youve forgotten  
About us  
Dont forget
