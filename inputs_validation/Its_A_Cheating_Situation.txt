Its a cheating situation  
A stealing invitation  
To take whats not really ours  
To make it through the midnight hours  
Its a cheating situation Just a cheap imitation  
Doing what we have to do  
When theres no love at home  
  
Theres no use in pretending  
Therell be a happy ending  
Where our loves concerned  
Sweetheart we both know  
  
Well take love where we find it  
Love and try to hide it  
Its all we got  
For we know theyre not  
Gonna let us go  
  
Its a cheating situation  
A stealing invitation  
To take whats not really ours  
To make it through the midnight hours  
Its a cheating situation  
Just a cheap imitation  
Doing what we have to do  
When theres no love at home  
  
Its a cheating situation  
When theres no love at home
