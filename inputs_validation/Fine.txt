Its fine  
Fine fine fine fine  
Its alright  
  
I had a dream last night  
That the world stopped turning  
But your madness it kept on  
Guess I wasnt too bright  
And I really wasnt learning  
Should have seen it all along  
  
All those sweet sweet sweet kisses yeah  
And those sweet sweet red roses yeah  
They convinced me it was you  
I made you you exclusive yeah  
Now its so now its conclusive that conclusive  
That you wasnt doin it too  
  
Chorus  
If ya told me from the start  
That you played around I woulda been fine  
Then I woulda played too  
And I guess I woulda had a good time  
If ya told me from the start  
That you played around I woulda been fine  
Then I woulda played too  
And I guess I woulda had a good time  
  
Something didnt feel right  
And I wish I knew it  
I just could not see your games  
I got respect for you  
And you put me through it  
Why would you bring me so much pain  
  
I would stick up for you  
Cause I did I did adore you adore you  
While my dogs would chew you out  
Tried to be so nice  
On those lonely  
On those lonely lonely lonely nights nights  
But I should have figured you out  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby youre so fine  
You are the one that I love  
You are so fine  
Your love was sent from above  
You are so youre fine fine fine fine  
Fine fine fine fine fine so doggone fine  
You are so fine  
Fine your love was sent from above  
Oh youre all of mine  
Youre fine fine fine fine  
Fine fine fine fine fine so doggone fine  
Fine you are the one that I love  
Fine your love was sent from above  
Youre fine fine fine fine  
Fine five fine fine fine so doggone fine  
  
Chorus
