Running round in this new truck  
Bank lets me borrow from month to month  
Running out of credit and find a little cash on the radio  
  
Standing still theyre blowing past  
Numbers on cars going Nascar fast  
What I wouldnt give for a slow down dont you know  
Cause where I come from only the horses run  
When the day is done we take it easy  
  
Meanwhile back at Mamas  
The porch lights on come on in if you wanna  
Suppers on the stove and beers in the fridge  
Red sun sinking out low on the ridge  
Games on the tube and daddy smoked cigarettes  
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet  
Funny the things you thought youd never miss  
In a world gone crazy as this  
  
Well I found a girl and we dont fit in here  
Talk about how hard it is to breathe here  
Even with the windows down cant catch a southern breeze here  
One of these days gonna pack it up and leave here  
  
Cause meanwhile back at Mamas  
The porch lights on come on in if you wanna  
Suppers on the stove and beers in the fridge  
Red sun sinking out low on the ridge  
Games on the tube and daddy smoked cigarettes  
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet  
Funny the things you thought youd never miss  
In a world gone crazy as this  
  
Oh I miss yeah a little dirt on the road  
I miss corn growing in a row  
I miss being somebody everybody knows there  
Everybody knows everybody  
I miss those small town roots  
Walking around in muddy boots  
The sound of rain on an old tin roof  
Its time we head on back  
  
Cause meanwhile back at Mamas  
The for sale signs going up and Im gonna  
Dump this truck and the little Ive got  
On a loan to own and a 3 acre lot  
Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge  
Going for broke yeah were gonna be rich  
Watch the sun settin on the ridge  
Baby tell me whatcha think about this  
  
Me and you back at Mamas  
Yeah me and you back at Mamas
