Gonna see some good times  
Gonna get to ring that bell  
Gonna see some good times  
Sometimes you make up  
For when Im not feeling well  
I must be due some great times  
Cause right now  
Cause right now I feel like hell  
Never trust a woman  
Who wears her pants too tight  
Never trust a woman  
Who wears her pants too tight  
She might love you tomorrow  
But shell be gone tomorrow night  
I say come tomorrow Ill get my pay  
And Im gonna leave this town  
Come tomorrow Ill get my pay  
And Im gonna leave this fucking town  
She dont really love me  
Aint no reason to stick around  
Gonna see some good times  
Gonna get to ring that bell  
Gonna see some good times  
Sometimes you make up  
For when Im not feeling well  
I must be due some great times  
But if they dont come if they dont come  
If they never come around what the hell
