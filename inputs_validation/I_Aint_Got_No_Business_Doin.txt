Im gonna call up my boss and tell him Im ill  
Gonna tell him Im home with the fever and chills  
I dont usually lie but for your sweet love I will I need it so  
  
We wont be disturbed the phones off the hook  
And when it comes to lovin woman you wrote the book  
And I just saw that I want you look and thats all it took well I  
  
Aint got no business doin business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
Cause I aint got no business doin business today  
  
Well the boys at the plant are punching the clock  
If they could see us darlin oh what a shock  
Theyd do the same if they had what I got  
So please dont stop well I  
  
Aint got no business doin business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
Cause I aint got no business doin business today  
  
Aint got no business doin business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
Cause I aint got no business doin business today
