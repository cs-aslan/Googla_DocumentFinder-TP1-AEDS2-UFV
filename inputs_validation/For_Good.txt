Rachel Im limited  
Just look at me  
Im limited  
And just look at you you can do all I couldnt do Glinda  
So now its up to you  
For both of us  
Now its up to you  
  
Kurt Ive heard it said  
That people come into our lives for a reason  
Bringing something we must learn  
And we are led to those who help us most to grow  
If we let them  
And we help them in return  
Well I dont know if I believe thats true  
But I know Im who I am today because I knew you  
  
Kurt Like a comet pulled from orbit as it passes a sun  
Like a stream that meets a boulder halfway through the wood  
Who can say if Ive been changed for the better  
Beacuse I knew you  
I have been cahnged for good  
  
Rachel It well may be that we will never meet again  
In this lifetime  
So let me say before we part  
So much of me is made from what I learned from you  
Youll be with me like a hand print on my heart  
An now whatever way our stories end  
I know you have rewritten my by being my friend  
  
Rachel Like a ship blown from its mooring by a wind off the sea  
Like a seed dropped by a skybird in a distand wood  
Who can say if Ive been changed for the better  
But because I knew you  
  
Kurt Because I knew you  
  
Both I have been changed for good  
  
Rachel And just to clear the air  
I ask forgiveness  
For the things Ive done you blame me for  
  
Kurt But then I guess we know theres blame to share  
  
Both And none of it seems to matter anymore  
  
Kurt Like a comet pulled from orbit  
Rachel Like a ship blown from its mooring  
Kurt As it passes a sun  
Rachel By a wind off the sea  
Kurt Like a stream that meets a boulder halfway throug the wood  
Rachel Like a seed dropped by a songbird in a distant wood  
  
Both Who can say if Ive been changed for the better  
I do believe I have been changed for the better  
  
Kurt And because I knew you  
  
Rachel Because I knew you  
  
Both Because I knew you  
I have been changed for good
