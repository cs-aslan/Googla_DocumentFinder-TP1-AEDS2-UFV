In times when youre troubled  
Seems more than you can affoard  
And you feel you feel you need a friend  
Someone to share the load  
  
And when your skies grow cloudy  
I want you to know got a friend thats true  
Just like a shelter in a time of storm  
Ill see you through thats what Ill do  
  
When your dreams are scattered  
Just like the wind blown sand  
And you feel you feel you need a friend  
Ill be there reach out your hand  
  
And when the tempest is raging  
I want you to know got a friend thats true  
Just like a shelter in a time of storm  
Ill see you through thats what Ill do  
  
Ill see you through your bad times  
Ill see you through your fears  
Ill see you through your hang ups  
Honey Ill dry all your tears  
  
And when the tempest is raging  
I want you to know got a friend thats true  
Just like a shelter in a time of storm  
Ill see you through thats what Ill do  
  
I will see you through I will see you through  
I will see you through I will see you through  
  
When my load got heavy did you see me through  
When my load got to hard to bear did you see me through  
What would you do what would you do  
What would you do what would you do  
  
If youre living on the dole and theres no sugar in your bowl  
All you need to do is give a little knock  
Dont despair hell be there with his loving and his care  
Marx will work for us right around the clock  
  
Hes alright hes alright  
Hes alright hes alright
