Snow  
It wont be long before well all be there with snow  
Snow  
I want to wash my hands my face and hair with snow  
  
Snow  
I long to clear a path and lift a spade of snow  
Snow  
Oh to see a great big man entirely made of snow  
  
Where its snowing  
All winter through  
Thats where I want to be  
Snowball throwing  
Thats what Ill do  
How Im longing to ski  
Through the snowohohohoh  
  
Those glistning houses that seem to be built of snow  
Snow  
Oh to see a mountain covered with a quilt of snow  
  
What is Christmas with no snow  
No white Christmas with no snow  
Snow  
  
Ill soon be there with snow  
Ill wash my hair with snow  
And with a spade of snow  
Ill build a man thats made of snow  
Id love to stay up with you but I recommend a little shuteye  
Go to sleep  
And dream  
Of snow
