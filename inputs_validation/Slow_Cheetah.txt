Waking up dead inside of my head  
Will never never do there is no med  
No medicine to take  
  
Ive had a chance to be insane  
Asylum from the falling rain  
Ive had a chance to break  
  
Its so bad its got to be good  
Mysterious girl misunderstood  
Dressed like a wedding cake  
  
Any other day and I might play  
A funeral march for Bonnie Brae  
Why try and run away  
  
Chorus  
Slow cheetah come  
Before my forest  
Looks like its on today  
  
Slow cheetah come  
Its so euphoric  
No matter what they say  
  
I know a girl  
She worked in a store  
She knew not what  
Her life was for  
She barely knew her name  
  
They tried to tell her  
She would never be  
As happy as the girl  
In the magazine  
She bought it with her pay  
  
Chorus  
  
Everyone has  
So much to say  
They talk talk talk  
Their lives away  
Dont even hesitate  
  
Walking on down  
To the burial ground  
Its a very old dance  
With a merry old sound  
Looks like its on today  
  
ChorusRepeat x2
