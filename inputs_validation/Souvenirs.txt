Take these arms of mine throw them away  
Theyre just souvenirs of some other day  
Take these lips of mine theyre useless to me  
Theyre just souvenirs of things that used to be  
  
Chorus  
Theyre just souvenirs and who needs em now  
Theyre just bits and pieces of my yesterday anyhow  
Take this old heart of mine its been beating too long  
Its just a souvenir of something that went wrong  
  
Take my yesterdays the minutes the hours  
Theyre just souvenirs theyll fade like the flowers  
Take these eyes before I see her again  
Theyre just souvenirs of things that might have been  
  
Chorus  
Ol Ts just a souvenir of something that went wrong
