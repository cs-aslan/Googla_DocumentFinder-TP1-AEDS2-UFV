Our conversation was short and sweet  
It nearly swept me offa my feet  
And Im back here in the rain  
Oh and you are on dry land  
  
You made it there somehow  
Youre a big girl now  
Bird on the horizon sittin on a fence  
Hes singin a song for me at his own expense  
  
And Im just like that bird  
Oh singin just for you  
I hope that you can hear  
Hear me singin through these tears  
  
Time is a jet plane it moves too fast  
Oh but what is the use of changing if all weve shared cant last  
I can change I swear  
Oh see what you can do  
  
I can make it through  
You can make it too  
Love is so simple to quote a phrase  
Youve known it all the time Im learnin it these days  
  
Oh I know I can find you  
Oh in somebodys room  
Its a price I have to pay  
Youre a big girl all the way  
  
A change in the weather is known to be extreme  
Whats the use of changing horses in midstream  
Im going out of my mind  
Oh with a pain that stops and starts  
  
Like a corkscrew to my heart  
Ever since weve been apart
