Confusion  
Desillution  
No Time  
No time for revolution  
No time for revolution  
Elutions for dath romance could breakup the bugs  
You go on makin sense  
Back in the sixties they standed there  
Fight fight for the dreams fight for the right  
In the seventies follow follow to go over to the place  
So went to San Francisco somewhere far out the space  
In the eighties I dont know some did it for the money  
Some did it for the showtheres no time  
No time to remember these days  
No time to hold back in that size  
We dont have no time no time no time  
No time for revolution 4 timesIn the nineties theres a soul called those
generation  
For who is in charge for this situation and this station  
About politicians no embitions  tell me whats the vision  
To be a winner is never ever mather of how  
Political correctness is the word of now  
The spirit of the money is the sound of the time  
Theres something coming up to change your mindtheres no time
