As I walk down the street  
Seems everyone I meet  
Gives me a friendly hello  
I guess Im just a lucky so and so  
  
The birds in every tree  
Are all so neighborly  
They sing wherever I go  
I guess Im just a lucky so and so  
  
If you should ask me the amount  
In my bank account  
Id have to confess that Im slippin  
But that dont worry me confidentially  
  
Ive got a dream thats a pippin  
And when the day is through  
Each night I hurry to  
A home where love waits I know  
  
I guess Im just a lucky so and so  
  
And when the day is through  
Each night I hurry to  
A home where love waits I know  
I guess Im just a lucky so and so  
  
Im just a lucky lucky so and so
