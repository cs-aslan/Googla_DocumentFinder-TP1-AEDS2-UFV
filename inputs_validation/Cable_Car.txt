sylvester  
Cable car flying high  
Passing stars or wondering why  
Did she go or did she die  
I dont know  
Mountainside not so green  
Snow is more than ever seen  
Will she come back in a dream  
I dont know  
Thoughts of her reminding me  
Of a time I couldnt see  
Anything but you and me together  
Colored cloud on you go  
To a land you may not know  
If you see her  
Tell her Im so alone  
Verse 4
