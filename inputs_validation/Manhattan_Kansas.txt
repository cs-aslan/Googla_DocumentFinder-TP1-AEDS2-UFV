Manhattan Kansas aint no place to have a baby  
If you got no man to give it his last name  
And my folks back in Manhattan didnt want me or her bundle  
So I took my child and caught an evening train  
I got a job in Denver washing dishes in a diner  
At least it buys my baby milk to drink  
He once told me I was pretty but the only ring it got me  
Is the ring of grease that runs around the sink  
Yes I laid beside him gentle cause he told me that he loved me  
And he made me dance before the music played  
But at least I didnt beg him Id rather wash my dishes  
It makes me feel as if my handsre clean  
 steel   
At night I stands there thinkin bout the men back home in Kansas  
And how my folks just turned away ashamed  
I look down through the soap suds reache down and pulls the drain plug  
And watches as Manhattan drains away  
Yes I laid beside him gentle
