In my mind Im gone to Carolina  
Cant you see the sunshine  
Cant you just feel the moonshine  
Aint it just like a friend of mine  
To hit me from behind  
Yes Im gone to Carolina in my mind  
  
Karin shes a silver sun  
You best walk her way and watch it shine  
And watch her watch the morning come  
A silver tear appearing now  
Im cryin aint I  
Gone to Carolina in my mind  
  
There aint no doubt in no ones mind  
That loves the finest thing around  
Whisper something soft and kind  
And hey babe the skys on fire  
Im dying aint I  
Gone to Carolina in my mind  
  
In my mind Im gone to Carolina  
Cant you see the sunshine  
Cant you just feel the moonshine  
And aint it just like a friend of mine  
To hit me from behind  
Yes Im gone to Carolina in my mind  
  
Dark and silent late last night  
I think I might have heard the highway call  
And geese in flight and dogs that bite  
The signs that might be omens say  
Im goin Im goin  
Im gone to Carolina in my mind  
  
With a holy host of others standin around me  
Still Im on the dark side of the moon  
And it seems like it goes on like this forever  
You must forgive me if Im up and gone to  
Carolina in my mind  
  
In my mind Im goin to Carolina  
Cant you see the sunshine  
Cant you just feel the moonshine  
Aint is just like a friend of mine  
To hit me from behind  
Yes Im gone to Carolina in my mind  
Gone to Carolina in my mind  
And Im goin to Carolina in my mind  
Goin to Carolina in my mind  
Gone Im gone Im gone  
Say nice things about me cause Im gone south now  
Got to carry on without me Im gone
