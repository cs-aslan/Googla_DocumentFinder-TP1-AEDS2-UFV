Where dyou wanna spend eternity  
Dreaming of liberty  
Searching for reality  
Trucking down infinity  
  
Bury your past an move on fast  
Nothins gonna last so take a bit of grass  
An move on move on fast  
  
Whats your visibility  
Looking for community  
Hoping for unity  
Trucking through infinity  
  
Bury your past an move on fast  
Nothins gonna last so take a bit of grass  
An move on move on fast  
  
Where dyou wanna spend eternity  
I might meet you somewhere  
All roads leads to nowhere  
Trucking through infinity  
  
Bury your past an move on fast  
Nothins gonna last so roll a bit of grass  
An move on move on fast  
  
Move on move on move on move on  
Move on move on move on move on
