Christopher Robin and I walked along  
Under branches lit up by the moon  
Posing our questions to Owl and Eeyore  
As our days disappeared all too soon  
But Ive wandered much further today than I should  
And I cant seem to find my way back to the Wood  
  
So help me if you can  
Ive got to get back  
To the House at Pooh Corner by one  
Youd be surprised  
Theres so much to be done  
Count all the bees in the hive  
Chase all the clouds from the sky  
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh  
  
Winnie the Pooh doesnt know what to do  
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose  
He came to me asking help and advice  
And from here no one knows where he goes  
So I sent him to ask of the Owl if hes there  
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear  
  
Its hard to explain how a few precious things  
Seem to follow throughout all our lives  
After alls said and done I was watching my son  
Sleeping there with my bear by his side  
So I tucked him in I kissed him and as I was going  
I swear that the old bear whispered Boy welcome home  
  
Believe me if you can  
Ive finally come back  
To the House at Pooh Corner by one  
What do you know  
Theres so much to be done  
Count all the bees in the hive  
Chase all the clouds from the sky  
Back to the days of Christopher Robin  
Back to the ways of Christopher Robin  
Back to the days of Pooh
