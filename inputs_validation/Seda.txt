Seda can you hear me  
Do you know my face  
Perfect like a circle  
Gone without a trace  
  
So long I have known you  
Marks upon your skin  
I can picture everything  
Can you picture this  
  
Seda doesnt care  
She just sits and stares  
All the secrets bare for the world to see  
  
Who will stand before you  
If you dont say my name  
Safe to say we will never know  
We are both the same  
  
I dont mind  
I can always find you  
Waiting there for me  
  
Seda doesnt care  
She just sits and stares  
All her secrets bare for the world to see  
  
Seda doesnt care  
She just sits and stares  
Seda doesnt care  
Shes just dyin there  
Seda doesnt care  
Shes just lyin there  
All the secrets bare for you and me
