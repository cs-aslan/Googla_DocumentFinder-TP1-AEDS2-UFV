Let me know  
Do I still got time to grow  
Things aint always set in stone  
That be known let me know  
Let me  
  
Seems like street lights glowin  
Happen to be just like moments passin  
In front of me so I hopped in the cab and  
I paid my fare see I know my destination  
But Im just not there  
  
All the street lights glowin  
Happen to be just like moments passin  
In front of me so I hopped in the cab and  
I paid my fare see I know my destination  
  
But Im just not there  
In the streets  
In the streets  
Im just not there in the streets  
Im just not there  
Lifes just not fair
