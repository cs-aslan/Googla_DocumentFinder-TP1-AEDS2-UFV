Right at the front door I recognized the perfume  
The scent was perfect in the dusk by the moon  
There must be many ways to ask her to my room  
Why didnt I dare  
  
Well every hour I try to get somethin done  
Out on the weekend when Im just havin some fun  
Im windin up with none just zeros no ones just space with no air  
  
I get byebye babybaby bye babybaby byebye  
Real sugar I dont want to climb no walls  
Real sugar thats what I want or none at all  
Real sugar sweet as a sweet can be  
Real sugar thats what I want and what I need  
Thats what I need  
  
Yeh every Friday Im gattin ready to roll  
I want her blue eyes start sayin hi and hello  
But I can always tell shed rather be alone with some other guy  
  
I get byebye babybaby bye babybaby byebye  
Real sugar I dont want to climb no walls  
Real sugar thats what I want or none at all  
Real sugar sweet as a sweet can be  
Real sugar thats what I want and what I need  
Real sugar I dont want to climb no walls  
Real sugar thats what I want or none at all  
Real sugar sweet as a sweet can be  
Real sugar thats what youve got so whats for me Hey whats for me  
  
I turn myself in turn turn turn  
I turn myself out outside and in  
Gimme gimme real sugar  
I dont want to climb no walls
