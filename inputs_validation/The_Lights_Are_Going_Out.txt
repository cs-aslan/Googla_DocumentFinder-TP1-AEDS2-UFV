Theres a painting on the wall  
That wasnt there at all  
Ten minutes ago  
Theres a girl who walks the line  
Shes with you all the time  
She wont let go  
And I cant see me with another girl  
As everything slows down across the world  
  
The lights are going out  
One by one  
Across the world  
With faces turning sown  
The night will hide the sound  
She comes to you  
  
And I cant see me with another girl  
As everything slows down across the world  
  
In a harbor safe from storm  
She waits for darkened forms  
Shes seen you there  
And time and time again  
You hear her call your name  
She calls for you  
  
And I cant see me with another girl  
As everything slows down across the world  
  
The lights are gong out  
One by one  
Across the world  
The lights are going out  
One by one  
Across the world
