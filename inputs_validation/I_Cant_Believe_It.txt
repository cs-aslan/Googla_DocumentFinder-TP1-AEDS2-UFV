There is nothing new  
I could give to you  
Just a life thats torn  
waiting to be born  
  
Rivers overflow  
friends may come and go  
But youve been by my side  
with every tear Ive cried  
  
Oh I cant believe that Youd give everything for me  
I cant believe it no I cant believe it no no  
I know You never lied and so its just my foolish pride  
That I just wont receive it yeah  
Its so hard to receive it in my heart and make the start with you  
  
Help me help me now  
I just dont know how  
You know Ive been so alone  
please melt this heart of stone  
  
La la la la  
  
Oh I cant believe that Youd give everything for me  
I cant believe it no I cant believe it no no  
I know You never lied and so Im giving up my pride  
So I can receive it yeah  
I just want to receive it in my heart and make the start with you  
  
La la la
