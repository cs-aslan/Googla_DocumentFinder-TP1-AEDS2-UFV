Hey  
Shes freaky and she knows it  
Shes freaky and I like it  
  
Listen  
  
She grabs the yellow bottle  
She likes the way it hits her lips  
She gets to the bottom  
It sends her on a trip so right  
She might be going home with me tonight  
  
She looks like a model  
Except shes got a little more ass  
Dont even bother  
Unless youve got that thing she likes  
I hope shes going home with me tonight  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
Shes got me love stoned  
Man I swear shes bad and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Shes freaky and she knows it  
Shes freaky but I like it  
  
She shuts the room down  
The way she walks and causes a fuss  
The baddest in town  
Shes flawless like some uncut ice  
I hope shes going home with me tonight  
  
And all she wants is to dance  
Thats why youll find her on the floor  
But you dont have a chance  
Unless you move the way that she likes  
Thats why shes going home with me tonight  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
Shes got me love stoned  
Man I swear shes bad and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
Shes got me love stoned from everywhere  
Shes bad and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Now dance  
Little girl  
Youre freaky but I like it  
Hot damn  
Let me put my funk on this one time  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
Shes got me love stoned  
Man I swear shes bad and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare  
The way they hit her I just stop and stare  
Shes got me love stoned from everywhere  
Shes bad and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
Shes got me love stoned  
Man I swear shes bad and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
