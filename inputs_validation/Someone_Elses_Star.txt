Alone again tonight  
Without someone to love  
The stars are shining bright  
So one more wish goes up  
Oh I wish I may and I wish with all my might  
For the love Im dreaming of  
And missing in my life  
  
Youd think that I could find  
A true love of my own  
It happens all the time to people that I know  
Their wishes all come true  
So Ive got to believe  
That theres still someone out there who  
Is meant for only me  
  
Chorus  
I guess I must be wishing on someone elses star  
Seems like someone else  
Keeps getting what Im wishing for  
Why cant I be as lucky as those other people are  
I guess I must be wishing on someone elses star  
  
I sit here in the dark  
And stare up at the sky  
And I cant give my heart  
One good reason why  
Everywhere I look  
Its lovers that I see  
Seems like everyones in love  
With everyone but me  
  
Chorus  
  
Why cant I be as lucky as those other people are  
Oh I guess I must be wishing  
On someone elses star
