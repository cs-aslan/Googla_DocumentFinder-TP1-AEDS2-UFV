Chorus  
It takes a little time sometimes  
To get your feet back on the ground  
It takes a little time sometimes  
To get the titanic turned back around  
It takes a little time sometimes  
But baby youre not going down  
It takes more than youve got right now  
Give it time  
  
Whats this walking through my door  
I know Ive seen the look before  
Sometimes in faces on the street  
Sometimes in the mirror looking back at me  
You cant fix this pain with money  
You cant rush a weary soul  
You cant sweep it under the rug now honey  
It dont take a lot to know  
  
Chorus  
  
Now it may not be over by morning  
But Rome wasnt built in a day  
You can name this thing a thousand times  
But it wont make it go away  
Let me put my arms around you  
And hold you while you weep  
Weve been talking and talking  
Im sick of this talk  
And its nothing that wont keep  
  
Chorus  
  
No you cant fix this pain with money  
You cant rush a weary soul  
You cant sweep it under the rug now honey  
It dont take a lot to know  
  
Chorus
