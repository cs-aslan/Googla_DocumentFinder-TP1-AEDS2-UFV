Another day you didnt go to school  
You were in my arms breakin all the rules  
Another night without you by my side  
This aint the way to spend our lives  
Sometimes I wanna leave this town  
Find a better place where they wont put us down  
I know time is on our side so Im hangin on somehow  
Never gonna give you up  
Never gonna say goodbye  
As long as were together baby well survive  
Never gonna let you go  
Never gonna turn away  
Cause I dont wanna lose you  
Never gonna give you up  
People talk about us on the street  
Rumors fly everytime we meet  
But we dont never have to be ashamed  
Our love is real it aint no game  
You say that we should hide away  
I promise baby we dont have to be afraid  
I know time is on our side weve just gotta hang on somehow
