Some people say you hate me  
I dont believe its true things that youre going through  
Some people say you hate me  
I dont believe its you things that youre going through  
Some people sad I pray for  
No one you want to live the eyes that once were his  
Some people sad I pray for  
The way you want to live the eyes you want to give  
Some people say you played me  
I dont care if its true Im waiting here for you  
Some people say you made it  
Im not afraid to know when things are getting low  
Some people say you hate me  
I dont believe its true things that youre going through  
Some people say you hate me  
I dont believe its you things that youre going through
