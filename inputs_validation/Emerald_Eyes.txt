You dont know what she means to me  
Shes a heart that beats close to me  
And gettin back to the way I feel  
Her honest word is my only real thing  
When she comes to me then I feel fine  
And Im not afraid but so gratified  
Emerald eyes is a mystery  
Starin through to the heart of me  
Find emerald eyes in the night  
Gleamin shiny and bright  
As if covered with silver  
Shes still a mystery to me  
The way she sails away slow  
Makes your day to day life easy  
Emerald eyes is a mystery  
Shes my place of serenity  
And gettin back to the way I feel  
Her honest word is my only real thing  
Only an honest word maybe a sky report  
Could be a weather bird it was so close to me  
Emerald eyes is a mystery  
Shes my place of serenity
