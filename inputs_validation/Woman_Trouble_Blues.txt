The womans name was trouble  
She put the blame on me  
I asked her what her game was  
She said Misery  
I didnt ask no questions  
I did not even pray  
When the angel on my shoulder  
Said I should walk away  
  
You promised me heaven  
But you gave me hell  
Cut me down to the bone  
With your kiss and tell  
Nobody listens to a word I say  
Still Im gonna curse you woman  
Til my dying day  
  
I should have known better  
With a girl like you  
You shame the devil  
With the things you do  
I was blind now I see  
A lying woman be the death of me  
  
I got woman trouble blues  
Woman trouble blues  
  
You told me it was meant to be  
But all you did was put the hurt on me  
You made my life a living hell  
And drowned my dreams in the wishing well  
  
Ive got woman trouble blues  
Woman trouble blues  
  
There aint no doubt Im going down  
  
The womans name was trouble  
She put the blame on me  
I gave her what she wanted  
And I got misery  
Now I dont take much persuading  
At times Im easily led  
Im gonna find myself in a prison cell  
Thro the lying things she said  
  
Ill stand accused on judgment day  
And pray the lord hears what I say  
All my life I never learned  
I played with fire and I got burned  
  
Woman trouble blues  
I got woman trouble blues  
Woman trouble blues  
Mean ol woman trouble blues
