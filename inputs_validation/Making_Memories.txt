Theres a time for feelin as good as we can  
The time is now and theres no stoppin us  
Theres a time for livin as high as we can  
Behind us you will only see our dust  
  
You know were havin good days  
And we hope theyre gonna last  
Our future still looks brighter than our past  
We feel no need to worry  
No reason to be sad  
Our memries remind us maybe road lifes not so bad  
  
Just keep smilin move onward evry day  
And try to keep our thoughts away from home  
Were travlin around no time to settle down  
And satisfy our wanderlust to roam  
  
Well from sea to shining sea and a hundred points between  
Still we go on diggin evry show  
The cities in the land all extend a welcome hand  
Till morning when its time for us to go
