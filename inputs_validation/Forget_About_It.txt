Forget about it  
Im admittin I was wrong  
And Ill just take whats mine  
And walk right out the door  
  
Forget about it  
Ill split and Ill be gone  
And youll have memories  
Youll find hard to ignore  
  
Cause after all  
Ill see you sometime maybe  
When I cant recall  
How you drove me crazy  
Forget about it  
When forevers over  
I wont remember how much  
I loved you anymore  
  
Forget about it  
Put me out of your head  
Now that youre free and easy  
Out there on the town  
Forget about it  
When youre lying in bed  
Just wishing I was there to lay you down  
  
Cause after all  
Ill see you sometime maybe  
When you will recall  
How I drove you crazier  
Forget about those stars in your eyes  
Laying by the fireside  
Holding you tight  
I cant remember when I felt so right  
So just forget about it  
  
Forget about it  
When you see me on the street  
Dont wink dont wave  
Dont try to tease me with your smile  
Forget about it  
If we chance to meet somewhere  
Dont think its cause Im trying to reconcile  
  
Cause after all  
Ill see you sometime maybe  
When I cant recall how you drove me crazier  
Forget about those stars in your eyes  
Laying by the fireside  
Holding you tight  
I cant remember when I felt so right  
So just forget about it
