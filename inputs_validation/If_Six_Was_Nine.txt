If the sun refused to shine  
I dont mind no baby I dont mind  
And if the mountains fell in the sea  
It aint me you know youve got to be free  
  
I got my own world to live through  
And I aint gonna copy you  
  
Now if six turned out to be nine  
I dont mind no baby I dont mind  
If all the hippies cut off all their hair  
I dont care no baby I dont care  
  
Because I Ive got my own world to live through  
And I aint gonna copy you  
  
White collar conservative walkin down the street  
Pointin their plastic finger at me  
Hopin my kind will drop and die  
But Im gonna wave my freak flag high  
So play on drummer  
  
Ive got my own world to live through  
And I aint gonna copy you
