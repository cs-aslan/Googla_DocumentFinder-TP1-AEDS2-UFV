If you leave me  
I wont miss you  
And I wont ever take you back  
Girl your memory  
Wont ever haunt me  
Cause I dont love you  
Now if youll buy that  
  
Chorus  
I got some ocean front property in Arizona  
From my front porch you can see the sea  
I got some ocean front property in Arizona  
If youll buy that Ill throw the golden gate in free  
  
I dont worship  
The ground you walk on  
I never have and thats a fact  
I wont follow or try to find you  
Cause I dont love you  
Now if youll buy that  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Yeah if youll buy that Ill throw the golden gate in free
