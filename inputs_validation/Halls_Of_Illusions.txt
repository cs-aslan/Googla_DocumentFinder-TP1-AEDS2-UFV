Halls Of Illusions  
Violent J  
Ticket please thanks walk through the door  
Into the Halls Of Illusions visit yours  
And see what coulda and shoulda and woulda been real  
But you had to fuck up tha whole deal  
Lets take a walk down the hallway  
Its a long way it it takes all day  
And when you get to tha end youll find a chair  
With straps and chains we slap you in there  
Lock you down tight so you cant move a thread  
And pull your eyelids up over your head  
cause youre about to witness an illusionary dream  
Its just to bad it aint what it seems  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
You walk in and see two kids on the floor  
They playin Nintendo and hes got tha high score  
And sittin behind them chillin in a chair  
Is your wife when ya look oh you aint there  
Its some other man in the hand in hand  
Now she looks so happy you dont understand  
See this is an illusion it never came true  
All because of you  
Violent J  
Back to reality and what youre about  
Your wife cant smile cause ya knocked her teeth out  
And she cant see straight from gettin hit  
cause youre a fat fuckin drunk piece of shit  
But its all good here come have a beer  
Ill break the top off it and shove it in ya ear  
And youre death comes wicked painful and slow  
At tha hands of MILENKO  
Chorus 2x  
Great Milenko wave your wand  
Dont look now your life is gone  
This is all because of you  
What you got yourself into  
Violent J  
Look whos next its Mr Clark  
The dirty old man from the trailer park  
You got your ticket Thanks take your coat off  
And later on why not Ill rip your throat off  
Lets take a walk down the hallway  
Its a long way it it takes all day  
And when you get to the end youll find a chair  
You see all the blood yeah your boy was just here  
We get all different kind of people comin through  
Richies chickens and bitches just like you  
In the Halls everybody gets a turn  
To sit and witness your illusion before you burn  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
What do we have here oh yeah no way  
It looks like your kids and they okay  
Your daughters chillin up in college top grade  
And your sons a fuckin doctor phat paid  
They got families and kids and its all good  
They even coach little league in the neighborhood  
Is this true have ya really seen tha holy ghost  
Nah bitch not even close  
Violent J  
Back to reality your sons on crack  
And your daughters got nut stains on her back  
And they both fuckin smell like shit  
And live in the gutter and sell crack to each other  
When they were kids youd beat em and leave em home  
And even whip em with the cord on the telephone  
And that reminds me man hey ya gotta call  
Watch your step to Hellits a long fall  
Chorus 2x  
Violent J  
Ah its time to pack up and move to the next town  
But we forgot Mr Bigot okay dig it  
We cant show you an illusion cause were all packed  
But Ill still cut ya neck out hows that  
Chorus 4x
