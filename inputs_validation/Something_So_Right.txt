Youve got the cool water  
When the river runs high  
And youve got the look of love  
Right in your eyes  
And I was in a crazy motion  
Till you calmed me down  
It took a little time  
But you calmed me down  
Some people never say the words I love you  
Its not their style to be so bold  
Some people never say the words I love you  
But like a child Theyre longing to be told  
Theyve got a wall in China  
Its a thousand miles long  
To keep out the foreigners  
They made it strong  
And Ive got a wall around me  
That you cant even see  
It took a little time  
To get next to me  
If something goes wrong  
Im the first to admit it  
The first to admit it  
But the last one to know  
If something goes right  
Wellits likely to lose me  
Its apt to confuse me  
Because its such an unusual sight  
Oh I cant get used to something so right  
Something so right  
Some people never say the words I love you  
Its not their style to be so bold  
Some people never say the words I love you  
But like a child Im longing to be told  
Theyve got a wall in China  
And Ive got a wall around me  
It took a little time  
To get next to me
