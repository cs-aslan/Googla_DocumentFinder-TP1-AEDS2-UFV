The sun still shines way up above  
But it dont matter now because  
The dream is gone  
The dream is just a memory Oh yeah  
If you see my dream send it back home to me  
  
The stars still glow up in the night  
But somehow they dont seem so bright  
The dream is gone  
The dream is just a memory Oh yeah  
If you see my dream send it back home to me  
  
Cause Ive been waiting for a long long time  
Thought Id found a way  
Now I just wait for someone to call  
Im waiting for it every day  
  
Send it on the wires  
Send it on a plane  
Send it on an express  
But send it back to me again  
  
The music plays so loud and clear  
But somehow I cant make you hear  
The dream is gone  
The dream is just a memory yeah  
If you see my dream send it back home to me  
  
When you get what you want its a long way down  
And you can see for miles around  
When you lose it nothing is for real  
If you see my dream send it back to me  
  
Send it on the wires  
Send it on a plane  
Send it on an express  
But send it back to me again  
  
Send it on the wires  
Send it on a plane  
Send it on an express  
But send it back to me again  
  
Send it Send it send it  
Send it  
Send it Send it send it  
Send it on the wires Send it send it  
Send it on a plane
