Put my hand on the Bible  
Do me for liable  
Its suing season  
And I am broke  
  
Buy me some happy  
Find me some passion  
Will it ever happen  
Heaven knows  
  
Sometimes youve got to get the joke  
Its the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat  
Who put this spanner in my spokes  
I cant change how its wrote  
  
Classy or flashy  
At home with Lassie  
They all walk past me  
I wouldnt know  
  
Make me a new man  
Find me a new plan  
I am a sports fan  
A real bloke  
  
Sometimes youve got to get the joke  
Its the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat  
Who put this chainsaw in my spokes  
I cant change how its wrote  
  
And when my ship comes in shell be on it  
Eating a fresh kebab and I want it  
And I want it now  
  
Sometimes youve got to get the joke  
Its the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat  
Who put this chainsaw in my spokes  
I cant change how its wrote  
  
Sometimes youve got to get the joke  
Its the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat  
You get the dagger out of the cloak  
I cant change how its wrote
