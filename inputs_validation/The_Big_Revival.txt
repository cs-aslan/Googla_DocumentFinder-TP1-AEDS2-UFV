Get ready for the big revival  
Get ready for the big revival  
  
Get ready for the big revival  
Everybody get in the van  
Theres a little church on Eagle Mountain  
Its called The Blood of the Blessed Land  
If your faith aint strong enough child you might wind up dead  
Praise the Lord and pass me a Copperhead  
  
Now Reverend Jones he struts and dances  
While the guitar plays Amazing Grace  
He testifies in tongues of fire  
With tears of joy running down his face  
He aint sure and we aint sure exactly what he said  
But praise the Lord and pass me a Copperhead  
  
Bridge  
You wont find many hypocrites thatll take the chance on getting bit  
The big revival the big revival the big revival the big revival  
But a true believer can survive rattlesnakes and cyanide  
  
Now when you hold that deadly viper  
Keep the holy spirit in your mind  
Do not lose your concentration  
That serpents surely bound to strike  
Either way you wont forget the first time that you said  
Praise the Lord and pass me a Copperhead  
Praise the Lord and pass me a Copperhead
