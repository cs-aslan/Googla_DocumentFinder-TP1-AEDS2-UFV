Stay beside me stay beside me  
Say youll never leave me  
How I love you how I love you  
How I need you please believe me  
In your arms Ive found my heaven  
And your lips have done their part  
  
Il mondo  
Your love is all I need in my world  
Let tender kisses plead in my world  
How could I ever live without you  
  
Il mondo  
My heart belongs to you so take it  
And promise me youll never break it  
Say youll stay here in my arms  
  
Stay beside me stay beside me  
Say youll never leave me  
How I love you how I love you  
How I need you please believe me  
In your arms Ive found my heaven  
And your lips have done their part  
  
Il mondo  
Your love is all I need in my world  
Let tender kisses plead in my world  
How could I ever live without you  
Il mondo  
My heart belongs to you so take it  
And promise me youll never break it  
Say youll stay here in my arms  
Here in my arms  
  
Il mondo  
Il mondo
