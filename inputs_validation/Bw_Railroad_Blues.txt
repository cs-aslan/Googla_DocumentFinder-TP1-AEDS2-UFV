Im gonna lay my troubles on a railroad track  
Im gonna ride I aint lookin back  
Tried to stop but I cant unpack  
Gotta get used to the clicketyclack  
The big ol wheels and the smokin stack  
Ah babe I gotta go  
Babe I gotta go  
  
Loved you honey heart and soul  
I swear youre the sweetest thing I know  
I loved you true and I told you so  
I told you too come time to go  
Ill be gone with any ol wind that blows  
Ah babe I just cant stay  
And its bound to be that way  
  
Theres lots of things Id like to see  
From the mountains to the shining sea  
Up in the sky where the wind blows free  
To the cities down below  
Babe I just dont know  
I got trouble trouble in my soul  
I got trouble in my soul  
  
Im gonna lay my trouble on a railroad track  
Im gonna ride I aint lookin back  
I tried to stop but I cant unpack  
Go to sleep with the clicketyclack  
The big ol wheels and the smokin stack  
Babe Im bound to go  
I got trouble in my soul  
I got trouble trouble in my soul
