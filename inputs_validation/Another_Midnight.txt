He was a coal miner in the spring  
Blinded with its dusty resolutions  
Broke his back for higher contributions  
Now hed take anything  
Well she was 1970  
Burning like a cigarette long season  
Heir to her familys old treasons  
She makes love hard like an enemy  
Oh ma hes dying  
  
And the river dont sleep  
When the water runs cold  
And the calendar burns  
As the story unfolds  
And the valley spans miles  
When the mountain stands high  
Cant they let us run wild  
For another midnight  
  
Perhaps were election day  
Pumping hands and kissing all the babies  
Aint no time for shadowed doubts or maybes  
Is there another way  
Or were a stolen Cadillac  
Racing for a roadblock in the distance  
Flashing by a lifetime in an instance  
Can we take it all back  
Oh ma hes dying  
Oh ma hes dying  
  
And the river dont sleep  
  
Can we take it back  
  
And the valley spans miles  
When the mountain stands high  
Cant they let us run wild  
For another midnight
