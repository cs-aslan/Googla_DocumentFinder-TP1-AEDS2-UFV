You better love loving and you better behave  
You better love loving and you better behave  
Woman in Chains  
Woman in Chains  
Calls her man the Great White Hope  
Says shes fine shell always cope  
Woman in Chains  
Woman in Chains  
Well I feel lying and waiting is a poor mans deal  
And I feel hopelessly weighed down by your eyes of steel  
Its a world gone crazy  
Keeps Woman in Chains  
Trades her soul as skin and bones  
Sells the only thing she owns  
Woman in Chains  
Woman in Chains  
Men of Stone  
Men of Stone  
Well I feel deep in your heart there are wounds Time cant heals  
And I feel somebody somewhere is trying to breathe  
Well you know what I mean  
Its a world gone crazy  
Keeps Woman in Chains  
Its under my skin but out of my hands  
Ill tear it apart but I wont understand  
I will not accept the Greatness of Man  
Its a world gone crazy  
Keeps Woman in Chains  
So Free Her  
So Free Her
