Chorus  
Lay down your burden  
I will carry you  
I will carry you my child my child  
Lay down your burden  
I will carry you  
I will carry you my child my child  
  
Cause I can walk on water  
Calm a restless sea  
Ive done a thousand things youve never done  
And Im really watching  
While you struggle on your own  
Call my name Ill come  
  
Chorus  
  
I give vision to the blind  
I can raise the dead  
Ive seen the darker side of hell  
And Ive returned  
Ive seen those sleepless nights  
And count every tear you cry  
Some lessons hurt to learn  
  
Chorus
