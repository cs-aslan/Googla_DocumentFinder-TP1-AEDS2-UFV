You can call it anything you want  
But a rose is a rose and a thorn is a thorn  
Tell me white is black and black is white  
You can say anything but that dont make it right  
You can tell me that the world is flat  
If I didnt know any better I might go for that  
And the sky is falling on my head  
I believe the sky is falling on my head  
Ive been such a fool  
Dont you agree  
I let you call all my shots for me  
Dont you know how it feels  
When youve got high ideals  
  
Call it what you will dont call it love  
Call it what you will dont call it love  
Call it what you will dont call it love  
Call it what you will dont call it love not in front of me  
  
I think Im old enough  
I can handle myself when the going gets tough  
You dont have to hide it anymore  
Why bother sparing me now when you didnt before  
You can save that line for someone else  
Thats your own can of beans and I swear I wont tell  
Now is the sky is falling on my head  
I believe the sky is falling on my head  
Ive been such a fool  
But dont cry for me  
You are the one who needs sympathy  
Tell me how many times  
Can you play the same line  
  
Now the sky is falling on your head  
Look out baby now the sky is falling on your head  
Yes the sky is falling on your head  
I believe the sky is falling on your head  
Youve been such a fool  
Now cant you see  
You lost your best opportunity  
You passed up a prize  
For some pie in the sky
