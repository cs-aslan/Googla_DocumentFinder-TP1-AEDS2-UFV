These four walls  
They whisper to me  
They know a secret  
I knew they would not keep  
It didnt take long  
For the room to fill with dust  
And these four walls came down around us  
  
It must have been something to send me out of my head  
With the words so radical and not what I meant  
Now I wait  
For a break in the silence cause its all that you left  
Just me and these four walls again  
  
Its hard now to let you be  
I wont make excuses  
Ive made my peace  
It didnt take long  
For me to lose the trust  
Cause these four walls  
Were not strong enough  
  
It must have been something to send me out of my head  
With the words so radical and not what I meant  
Now I wait  
For a break in the silence cause its all that you left  
Just me and these four walls again  
  
Yeah  
Its difficult  
Watching us fade  
Knowing its all my fault  
My mistake  
Yeah and its difficult  
Letting you down  
Knowing its all my fault  
Youre not around  
  
It must have been something to send me out of my head  
With the words so radical and not what I meant  
Now I wait  
For a break in the silence cause its all that you left  
Just me and these four walls again  
  
Again  
These four walls again
