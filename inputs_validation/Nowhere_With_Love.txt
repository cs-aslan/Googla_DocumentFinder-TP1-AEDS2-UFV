In a way I really dont know much at all  
And if you say that Im simple youre on the ball  
On the ball to say that Im going nowhere  
But Im going nowhere with love  
  
They all say that Im not impressive at best  
Thats O K Ive got nobody to impress  
My impression is theyd rather be elsewhere  
Oh Im staying nowhere with love  
  
Well its better to be happy in a cardboard shack  
Than to be alone in a castle  
All you get for your money is a heart attack  
Id just as soon alleviate the hassle  
  
Every day I watch the gogetters go by  
Even they say the ladder is much too high  
Why should I go high Im happy below there  
Right here in nowhere with love
