Last year at Lady Marys fair when I was in Dundee  
I fell in with an old sweetheart and he being on a spree  
His company I did accept and with him I did go  
But to my sad misfortune it proved my poor through  
We wandered east we wandered west we wandered through the lawn  
He said hed see me home that night but home I never saw  
He kept beside me all the while resolved to have his will  
And by and by we lost our way at the back of Rares Hill  
  
For when we got to Rares Hill the laddie said to me  
We cant go home tonight my dear its far to late youll see  
But the night is warm and in my bush Ive got another drill  
And we can lie down here content at the back of Rares Hill  
  
For then he poured a nipper piece to quiet all alarm  
When I awoke in the morning we were locked in each others arms  
He handed me the bottle another glass to fill  
And I drank his heath in store owealth at the back of Rares Hill  
  
And then the lad he said to me Oh lassie do not mourn  
For while I draw the breath of life from you Ill never harm  
If you will come to yonder town my wedded wife youll be  
well be the happiest couple twas ever in Dundee  
  
So its may I never prosper and may I never thrive  
In anything I take in hand as long as Im alive  
If eer I say I rue the day my laddie had his will  
Success to Lady Marys fair and the back of Rares Hill
