When the fantasy we live in  
Lies in pieces on the ground  
And there is no false illusion  
That can turn your heart around  
Nothing can change the way I feel  
Nothing can take your love from me  
If only I didnt worry  
If only I could see  
If only I could see  
  
Chasing shadows on the wall  
Chasing shadows as they dance on the floor  
Chasing dreams that were forever young  
Now Im on my own  
Chasing shadows on the wall  
Shadows on the wall  
  
On the sea of mediocrity  
Drifting from a distant shore  
No goodbyes no celebration  
Noone there to close the door  
Only the silence that I feel  
Only the lonely road is real  
If only I didnt loose you  
If only we could be  
If only we could be  
  
Chasing shadows on the wall  
Chasing shadows as they dance on the floor  
Chasing dreams that were forever young  
Now Im on my own  
Chasing shadows on the wall  
Shadows on the wall  
Chasing shadows on the wall  
Chasing shadows as they start to fall  
Chasing dreams that were forever young  
Chasing shadows on the wall  
Chasing shadows on the wall  
Chasing shadows as they dance on the floor  
Chasing shadows on the wall
