Your love is nothing I cant fight  
Cant sleep with the man who dims my shine  
  
Im in the bedroom  
With tissues and when  
I know youre outside banging that I wont let you in  
Cause its a hard life with love in the world  
And Im a hard girl  
Loving me is like chewing on pearls  
  
Youve got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I  
I like it rough I  
I like it rough  
  
Youve got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I  
I like it rough I  
I like it rough  
  
Wont go without my fix tonight  
Its a little too rough  
Prom girl wipes her tears with silver lines  
And she cant get enough  
  
Im in the bedroom  
With tissues and when  
I know youre outside banging that I wont let you in  
Cause its a hard life with love in the world  
And Im a hard girl  
Loving me is like straightening curls  
  
Youve got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I  
I like it rough I  
I like it rough  
  
Youve got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I  
I like it rough I  
I like it rough  
  
Im shiny and I know it  
Dont know why you wanna blow it  
Need a man who likes it rough likes it rough likes it rough  
  
Im shiny and I know it  
Dont know why you wanna blow it  
Need a man who likes it rough likes it rough likes it rough  
  
Is it because you dont mean it  
Or because I dont feel it  
Yes its rough
