Changes visible changes  
Sky looking so forlorn  
It looks like the worlds been born  
On one more rainy day  
  
Trying to see the sunlight  
My hearts crying out loud  
I try to see through the clouds  
On one more rainy day  
  
One more rainy day  
Once again my mind is gray  
This is what a rainy day can do  
One more rainy day  
One more rainy day  
  
Sun starts shining on through  
New day a day with you  
Its strange what sun can do  
On one more rainy day  
  
One more rainy day  
Once again my mind is gray  
This is what a rainy day can do  
One more rainy day  
One more rainy day
