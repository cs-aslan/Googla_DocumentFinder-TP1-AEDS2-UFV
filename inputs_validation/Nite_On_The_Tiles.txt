I couldnt wait she came in late  
She wasnt there I didnt care  
Im sinking low where can I go  
Has no one goit a bed to share  
  
I spent a night on the tiles  
A night on the tiles  
  
Here comes the day what can I say  
She really knows that Ive been cheating  
The night was long she came on strong  
Its morning that well soon be greeting  
  
I spent a night on the tiles  
A night on the tiles  
  
If only I could lay with you by me  
Id never leave your side again  
Youd make me feel a man and then  
  
She left for good I knew she would  
Theres nothing for me here at all  
Why did she go Ill never know  
How come she had to be so cruel  
  
I spent a night on the tiles  
A night on the tiles
