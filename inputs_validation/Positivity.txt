Oh  
Get up face the power  
Oh hey  
  
Its early in the morning  
The light outside is blinding  
You dont want to know  
Youre so tired of complainin  
Cause your nine to five aint workin  
While your dreams just seem to grow and grow  
  
Nothings clear  
Its so confusin  
Intuitions left you  
Theres no one left to turn to  
Until you hear a voice within your heart  
Telling you which way to go Dont you know  
  
You have got to learn to please your mind  
Positively Oh  
Tryin to find a way to spend your time  
In positivity  
  
Spend the days here waiting  
And all your nights in wishin  
Seasons come and go  
As you sleep the tide is risin  
One by one your dreams are drownin  
While you stare and watch the waters flow  
  
Nothings clear  
Its so confusin  
Intuitions left you  
Theres no one left to turn to  
Until you hear a voice within your heart  
Telling you which way to go Dont you know  
  
You have got to learn to please your mind  
Positively Oh  
Tryin to find a way to spend your time  
In positivity  
  
Dont spend your days  
Watching the way  
Face the power  
Got to please your mind  
  
You have got to learn to please your mind  
Positively Oh  
Tryin to find a way to spend your time  
In positivity  
  
You have got to learn to please your mind  
Positively Oh  
Tryin to find a way to spend your time  
In positivity
