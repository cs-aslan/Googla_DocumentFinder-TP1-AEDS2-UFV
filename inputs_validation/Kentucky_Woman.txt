Kentucky woman  
She shines with her own kind of light  
Shed look at you once  
And a day thats all wrong  
Looks all right  
And I love her  
God knows I love her  
  
Kentucky woman  
If she get to know you  
She goin to own you  
Kentucky woman  
  
Well she aint the kind  
Makes heads turn at the drop of her name  
But something inside  
That shes got turn you on just the same  
And she loves me  
God knows she loves me  
  
Kentucky woman  
If she get to know you  
She goin to own you  
Kentucky woman  
  
I dont want much  
The good Lords earth beneath my feet  
A gentle touch  
From that one girl and life is  
Sweet and good  
Aint no doubt  
Im talkin about  
  
Kentucky woman  
If she get to know you  
She goin to own you  
Kentucky woman
