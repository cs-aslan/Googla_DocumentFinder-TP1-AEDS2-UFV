When you said you were leaving tomorrow that today was our last day  
I said thered be no sorrow that Id laugh when you walked away  
But a little bitty tear let me down spoiled my act as a clown  
I had it made up not to make a frown but a little bitty tear let me down  
  
I said Id laugh when you left me full of funny as you went out the door  
That Id have another one a waitin Id wave goodbye as you go  
But a little bitty tear  
  
Everything went out like I planned it and I really put on quite a show  
I thought that I was gonna stand it but when youve got through the door  
But a little bitty tear  
When you said you were leaving
