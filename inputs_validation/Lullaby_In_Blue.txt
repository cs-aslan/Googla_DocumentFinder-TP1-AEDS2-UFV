I know that Im no saint  
My head is in the clouds  
They called you a mistake  
But I still I still say your name out loud  
  
They called me a stupid girl  
Just like my mom  
Too many men passed through my arms  
At seventeen I looked into your eyes  
Knew I could never comfort your cries  
Every April still reminds me of you  
The child I never knew  
My lullaby in blue  
  
It all goes by so fast  
How lovely you must be  
Why youve reached the age at last  
That I was when your daddy lived with me  
  
How I wish we could meet somewhere  
Talk it through  
There is so much I would say to you  
There are others Im not alone  
A younger brother youve never known  
And a baby girl who so reminds me of you  
The child I never knew  
My lullaby in blue  
  
As the years go by  
Try not to think of us sadly  
Believe it if you can  
I want to see you so badly  
On your birthday Mamas thinking of you  
The child I never knew  
My lullaby in blue  
My lullaby in blue  
My lullaby
