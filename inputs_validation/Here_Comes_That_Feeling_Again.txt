Here comes that feeling again  
Youre always around me  
This island life never ends  
It just circles inside me  
And when were older  
Well go back to being friends  
But oh  
Here comes that feeling again  
I better get away from all these  
Ohsofamilar places that I see  
I gotta find a place without so many  
Familar faces in front of me  
When I wake up in the morning  
And theres no one there but me  
Ill remember  
Ill remember  
Here comes that feeling again  
Youre always around me  
This island life never ends  
It just circles inside me  
And when were older  
Well go back to being friends  
But oh  
Here comes that feeling again  
Gotta keep on moving through these  
Distances between yesterday and now  
As if all this riding on these white lines  
Will make them fade away somehow  
Do you try not to remember  
The things you cannot forget  
And are you sorry for what hasnt happened yet  
I stare at everyone  
It makes me wonder why  
I cant see anyone but you  
Maybe change  
And all these faces  
Reappear in different places  
And I cant see a thing but you  
Here comes that feeling again  
Youre always around me  
This island life never ends  
It just circles inside me  
And when were older  
Well go back to being friends  
But oh  
Here comes that feeling again
