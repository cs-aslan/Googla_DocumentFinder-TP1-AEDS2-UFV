Goodnight ladies ladies goodnight  
Its time to say goodbye  
Let me tell you now goodnight ladies ladies goodnight  
Its time to say goodbye  
  
Ah all night long youve been drinking your tequilla rye  
But now youve sucked your lemon peel dry  
So why not get high high high and  
Goodnight ladies ladies goodnight  
  
Goodnight ladies ladies goodnight  
Its time to say goodbye  
Goodnight sweet ladies all ladies goodnight  
Its time to say goodbye byebye  
  
Ah weve been together for the longest time  
But now its time to get high  
Come on lets get high high high  
And goodnight ladies ladies goodnight  
  
Oh Im still missing my other half  
Oh it must be something I did in the past  
Dont it just make you wanna laugh  
Its a lonely Saturday night  
Oh nobody calls me on the telephone  
I put another record on my stereo  
But Im still singing a song of you  
Its a lonely Saturday night  
  
Now if I was an actor or a dancer that was glamorous  
Then you know an amorous life would soon be mine  
But now the tinsel light of star break  
Is all thats left to applaud my heart break  
And eleven oclock I watch the network news  
  
Oh oh oh something tells me that youre really gone  
You said we could be friends but thats not whats not what I want  
And anyway my TVdinners almost done  
Its a lonely Saturday night  
I mean to tell you its a lonely Saturday night  
One more word its a lonely Saturday night
