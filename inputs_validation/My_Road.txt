Well I wear my clothes like this because I can  
And I wear my hair like this because I can  
And I walk around like this because I can  
And I do my thing like this because its who I am

And if youre respecting me to give you an apology  
Be nothing that you used to used to  
Go round on the head away  
Hold your breath and concentrate  
Keep hold your face until you turn to turn to
