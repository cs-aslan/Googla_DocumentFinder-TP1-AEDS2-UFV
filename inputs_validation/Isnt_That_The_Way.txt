Ive got feelings inside me  
Im not letting you know  
I cant stop the wastin of the world  
Wastin all the days and minutes hours slip away  
I cant stop the ways in which you plan  
To leave our past behind  
I know theyve changed your mind  
Isnt that the way someone told you  
Isnt that the way someone cared  
Isnt that the way someone told you  
Isnt that the way someone cared  
I cant stop the rest of me  
From not letting you know  
Im not here to preach to you what I had  
Faking all the feelings that I started letting grow  
I cant stop the ways in which you plan  
To do it all leave it all behind  
Tomorrows left my mind  
Isnt that the way someone told you  
Isnt that the way someone cared  
Isnt that the way someone told you  
Isnt that the way someone cared
