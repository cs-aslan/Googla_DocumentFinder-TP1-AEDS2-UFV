Shes one of a kind  
Sometimes hard to find  
Like a rainbow  
  
Well shes lost all her glory  
And could tell you some stories  
That we all should know  
  
And theres too many hands  
Being laid on her  
Too many eyes will never see  
That its dragging her down  
But you wont hear a sound as  
She turns round  
  
Her beauty all aflight  
It always seems to turn the tide  
At midnight  
  
And for her there is no rest  
We are doing what is best  
For our future  
  
One of these days she may not  
Be so good to you  
One of these days she might  
Shake you to the ground  
But her fire is still burning  
And her heart is still yearning to be found  
  
Too many hands  
Being laid on her  
Too many eyes will never see  
That its dragging her down  
Still you wont hear a sound as  
She turns round  
  
Too many hands  
Too many hands
