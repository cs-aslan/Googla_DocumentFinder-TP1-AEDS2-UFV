Annie Christian wanted to be number 1  
But her kingdom never comes thy will be done  
She couldnt stand the glory she would be 2nd to none  
The way Annie tells the story shes his only son  
Annie Christian wanted to be a big star  
So she moved to Atlanta and she bought a blue car  
She killed black children and whats fair is fair  
If you try and say youre crazy everybody say electric chair  
Electric chair  
  
Annie Christian Annie Christ  
Until youre crucified Ill live my life in taxicabs  
Annie Christian Annie Christ  
Until youre crucified Ill live my life in taxicabs  
  
Annie Christian was a whore always looking for some fun  
Being good was such a bore so she bought a gun  
She killed John Lennon shot him down cold  
She tried to kill Reagan everybody say gun control  
Gun control
