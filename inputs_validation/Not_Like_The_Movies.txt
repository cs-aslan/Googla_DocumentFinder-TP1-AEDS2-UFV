He put it on me I put it on  
Like there was nothing wrong  
It didnt fit  
It wasnt right  
Wasnt just the size  
They say you know  
When you know  
I dont know  
  
I didnt feel  
The fairytale feeling no  
Am I a stupid girl  
For even dreaming that I could  
  
If its not like the movies  
Thats how it should be yeah  
When hes the one  
Ill come undone  
And my world will stop spinning  
And thats just the beginning yeah  
  
Snow white said when I was young  
One day my prince will come  
So I wait for that date  
They say its hard to meet your match  
Find my better half  
So we make perfect shapes  
If stars dont align  
If it doesnt stop time  
If you cant see the sign  
Wait for it  
One hundred percent  
With every penny spent  
Hell be the one that  
Finishes your sentences  
  
If its not like the movies  
Thats how it will be  
When hes the one  
And my world will stop spinning  
And thats just the beginning  
  
Oh yeah  
Cause I know youre out there  
And your your looking for me  
Its a crazy idea that you were made  
Perfectly for me youll see  
  
Just like the movies  
Thats how it will be  
Oh but thats how it should be  
Cinematic and dramatic with the perfect ending  
Oh its not like the movies  
Oh but thats how it should be  
When hes the one  
Youll come undone  
And your world will stop spinning  
And its just the beginning
