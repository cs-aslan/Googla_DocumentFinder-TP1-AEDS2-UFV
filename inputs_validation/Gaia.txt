Olivia NewtonJohn  
I am your motherborn of the sun  
I gave you shelterwhat have you done  
Your hearts in turmoilmy worlds in pain  
I need to turn you back home again  
I am a womanI am the rain  
And like your fatherI feel the betrayed  
What you are doingcan be undone  
You know the answerstell everyone  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
Whose fates in jeopardy  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
Thats the part you fail to see  
I am the forestnow Im a tree  
The air is dirtyI cannot breathe  
My streams run emptymy tears run dry  
My children call medont let us die  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
Whose fates in jeopardy  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
Thats the part you fail to see  
I love my children and Ive been your home  
But Ill survive thisif Im alone  
Im survivorbut you will be gone  
Lets start a new worldfrom this day on  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
Whose fates in jeopardy  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
Thats the part you fail to see  
For it is you not me  
Thats the part you fail to see  
Oh respect me  
Oh respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
Thats the part you fail to see
