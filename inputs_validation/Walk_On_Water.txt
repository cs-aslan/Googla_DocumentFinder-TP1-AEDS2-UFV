Little flame tormented soul  
Tried to get lost in all that rock and roll  
Came crashing through here like some hurricane  
Too much too soon for you little flame  
You cant walk on water  
You cant walk on water dont try  
Like a lamb to the slaughter  
Oh but for the grace of God go I  
Little flame caught that savage sound  
He liked to turn it upside down  
Well I think I know what you were talking about  
Im just so sorry that your flame went out  
Fun with no conscience tracks with no tears  
The rich get richer and the devils got no fears  
Sounds his call political lies  
There aint no virtue without sacrifice  
You cant walk on water  
You cant walk on water  
You cant walk on water  
You cant walk on water  
You cant walk on water  
You cant walk on water  
You cant walk on  
You cant walk on  
You cant walk on
