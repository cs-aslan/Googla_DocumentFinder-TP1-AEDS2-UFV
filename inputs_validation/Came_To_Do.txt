It aint nothing that make you want it  
Get your tipsy a little blonde  
I pull up and I ask for honey  
Fucked up feeling not upon it

For all my ladies  
For all my ladies  
  
Verse  
Baby youre so damn beautiful  
When I how many like it

And I get what you dont

Hes just the man of the morn  
A hundred stacks in the trunk  
She got a 100 packs in the donk

So I just stopped to get in money while these niggas need a loan  
Why you fucking with these dummies we need to be alone  
Cause Im wanting you baby  
So what to do  
Cause I wanna change your life  
Me and you
