Drift all you like  
From ocean to ocean  
Search the whole world  
Drunken confessions  
And hijacked affairs  
Just make you more alone  
  
If you come home Ill bake you a cake  
Made of all their eyes  
I wish you could see me  
Just when I kill  
Youre my manowar  
Youre my manowar  
  
And the worms will eat you whole  
My love  
  
So unplug your phone  
Stop all the chatter  
Iit all comes flooding back  
From poisoned clouds  
To poison the world  
Youre my manowar  
Youre my manowar  
  
And the worms will eat you whole  
And the worms will eat you whole  
My love
