Im just arriving in the city  
And theres music on my mind  
Lookin for my destination and  
My home is far behind  
cause its a long road ahead  
And you can make it in the end  
And Im gonna make it with my friends  
And Im tryin  
It took me sometime to see it  
Now Im looking through this world  
And its gonna take some time before  
I get back help me girl  
cause you can make it if you try  
You gotta lay it on the line  
And everything will be fine if you try  
Sittin smokin just a thinkin  
Is an easy thing to do  
We gotta keep on trying for  
The feelin to come through  
And its a lonely way to live  
You gotta take it you gotta live  
If you mistake it just try again  
And Im trying yeah  
Got to keep on trying  
Ah we got to keep on trying  
Yeah Im trying etc
