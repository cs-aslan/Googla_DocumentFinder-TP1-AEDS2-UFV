Old friend what you doin out there  
Come inside sit yourself on that chair  
Its been a long time since the last time  
Of many burdons have passed through our hands  
Not end today and day in to tonight  
  
Do you know what I mean Im trying to say Im sorry  
Youre the star in the sea your not just anybody  
Theres a light in your eye that I cant seem to reach  
Over head in the sky is it shining on me is it shining on me  
  
Ive always knew that you would not hang around  
You and me were like the thieves of the town  
Too many girlfriends but not enough love  
Too many late nights and not enough sleep  
Strung out and wasted no good in shape for  
The life we tasted there on the table  
  
Do you know what I mean Im trying to say Im sorry  
Youre the star in the sea your not just anybody  
Theres a light in your eye that I cant seem to reach  
Over head in the sky is it shining on me is it shining on me  
  
Open our heart and deeds in our head but most of the time we stay in a
place  
If you go out there your just up north  
Its a calm cool world I slapped that door
