Thats how heartaches are made  
Thats how heartaches are made  
  
They told me I was such a fool to love you  
They said that youre the kind whod never be true  
Pretty soon the day would come when Id be the sorry one  
But I said that Im not afraid  
  
Chorus  
Well thats how heartaches are made  
Thats how heartaches are made  
  
I went ahead and my heart opened the door  
I gave you so much love No one could love more  
You pretended to be mine How could you be so unkind  
With all the other girls you play  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I know youre not sincere and youll never be  
But still I want those kisses so desperately  
I could never let you go baby even though I know  
Every rule in love you disobeyed  
  
Chorus  
  
Thats how heartaches are made Repeat x3
