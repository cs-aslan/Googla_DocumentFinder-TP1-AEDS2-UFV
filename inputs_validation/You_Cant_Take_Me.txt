Ive been wasting all my time  
And Ive been drinkin all that wine  
And Ive been drinkin all that beer  
And Ive been sheddin all these tears  
  
I cant go but you cant stay  
Your not gonna take me out that way  
Because you cant take me  
I said you cant take me  
No you cant take me anywhere I dont want to go  
  
Ive been down this road before  
And I just can not care no more  
I cant see what you can see  
Im too busy bein me  
  
See I cant go and you cant stay  
You not gonna take me out that way  
Because you cant take me  
I said you cant take me  
No you cant take me anywhere I dont want to go  
  
I dont need to save no face  
I cant wait to leave this place  
Ive been fooled by lesser things  
And I dont care what tomorrow brings  
See I can go but you cant stay  
Your not gonna take me out that way  
Because you cant take me  
I said you cant take me  
No you cant take me anywhere I dont want to go
