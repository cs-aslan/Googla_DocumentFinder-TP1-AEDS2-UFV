If you dont feel like dancing tonight  
Well thats all right  
And if you dont feel like holding me tight  
Well thats all right  
Cause I know that you love me  
And youll show that you love me  
In your own sweet time  
But if you feel like hurting me baby  
Thats not right  
  
If you dont want to go anywhere  
Well I dont mind  
If you want to stay home and play with your hair  
I still dont mind  
Cause I know that you need me  
And youll know how to please me  
In your own sweet time  
But if you want to leave me well baby  
Then I mind  
  
Chorus  
Well I know that Ive been guilty of lying  
I know I had a whole lot of nerve  
But the way that you treat me since I begged your pardon  
Is something that I dont deserve  
  
And if you dont care to give me a date  
Well thats all right  
Cause I dont care how long I have to wait  
Ive got all night  
Cause I know that you want to  
But you know that youre going to make me lose my mind  
And if you can not think of me baby  
Thats not right  
  
Chorus  
  
feel like dancing tonight  
Well thats all right  
And if you dont feel like holding me tight  
Well thats all right  
Cause I know that you love me  
And youll show that you love me  
In your own sweet time  
But if you feel like hurting me baby  
Thats not right
