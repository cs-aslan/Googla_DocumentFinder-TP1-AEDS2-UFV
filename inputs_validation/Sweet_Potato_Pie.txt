Oh Lord I feel fine today  
Im walking on cloud nine today  
Im over that line today  
Happiness is finally mine today  
I guess Im just a lucky guy  
And Im prepared to tell you why  
Its strictly on account  
Of my sweet potato pie  
  
Im the fellow that she loves the most  
The main reason why she left the coast  
Shes my little girlzina  
That much hotter that a jalapeno  
Tender like a night in June  
Sweeter than a honeymoon  
Brighter than a silver spoon  
Just as crazy as a loon  
  
Softer than a lullaby  
Deeper than the midnight sky  
Soulful as a babys cry  
My sweet potato pie  
  
I used to see her around the neighborhood  
I wonder how she grew up so good  
She belonged to Freddy and he was bad  
And I never was ready to make him mad  
Im glad I had to wait awhile  
A little bit too juvenile  
I needed to refine my style a silk suit  
And a crocodile smile  
  
So let the whole damn world go by  
Cause I just want to testify  
From now on its me  
And my sweet potato pie
