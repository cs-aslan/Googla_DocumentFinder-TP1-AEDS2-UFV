Ive searched the holy books  
I tried to unravel the mystery of Jesus Christ the saviour  
Ive read the poets and the analysts  
Searched through the books on human behaviour  
I travelled this world around  
For an answer that refused to be found  
I dont know why and I dont know how  
But shes nobodys baby now  
  
I loved her then and I guess I love her still  
Hers is the face I see when a certain mood moves in  
She lives in my blood and skin  
Her wild feral stare her dark hair  
Her winter lips as cold as stone  
Yeah I was her man  
But there are some things love wont allow  
I held her hand but I dont hold it now  
I dont know why and I dont know how  
But shes nobodys baby now  
  
This is her dress that I loved best  
With the blue quilted violets across the breast  
And these are my many letters  
Torn to pieces by her longfingered hand  
I was her cruelhearted man  
And though Ive tried to lay her ghost down  
Shes moving through me even now  
I dont know why and I dont know how  
But shes nobodys baby now  
Shes nobodys baby now  
Nobodys baby now  
Shes nobodys baby now
