It gets so sticky down here  
Better butter your cuefinger up  
Its the start of another new year  
Better call the newspaper up 250  
For a hiball and a buck and a half  
For a beer happy hour  
Happy hour happy hour is here  
  
The long days of Shockley are gone  
So is football Kennedy style  
Famous last words taken all wrong  
Wind up on the very same pile  
250 for a decade  
And a buck and half for a year happy hour  
Happy hour happy hour is here  
  
I can cry beg and whine  
Tevery rebel I find  
Just to give me a line I could use to describe  
  
Theyd say baby eat this chicken slow  
Its full of all them little bones  
  
So regal and decadent here  
Coffincheaters dance on their graves music  
All its delicate fear  
Is the only thing that dont change  
250 for an eyeball  
And a buck and a half for an ear happy hour  
Happy hour happy hour is here  
  
Nothings dead down here  
Just a little tired theyd say  
Baby eat this chicken slow  
Its full of all them little bones
