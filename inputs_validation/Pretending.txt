Love is a flame that cant be tamed  
And though we are its willing pray my darling  
We are not the ones to blame  
  
Trust is a word all lovers know  
The glorious art of staining souls my darling  
We are not the ones to blame  
  
The more we have the more we want  
And the more it hurts our heart my baby  
It always ends up in tears  
  
So keep on Pretending  
Our heavens worth the waiting  
Keep on Pretending  
Its all right  
So keep on Pretending  
It will be the end of our craving  
Keep on Pretending  
Its all right  
  
When doubts arise the game begins  
The one we will never win my baby  
It always ends up in tears  
  
So keep on Pretending  
Our heavens worth the waiting  
Keep on Pretending  
Its all right  
So keep on Pretending  
It will be the end of our craving  
Keep on Pretending  
Its all right cmon cmon  
  
So keep on Pretending  
Our heavens worth the waiting  
Keep on Pretending  
Its all right  
So keep on Pretending  
It will be the end of our craving  
Keep on Pretending  
Its all right  
  
Love is a flame that cant be tamed  
And though we are its willing pray my darling  
We are not the ones to blame
