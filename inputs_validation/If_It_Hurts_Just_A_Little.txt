Perfect love you will never find  
Say goodbye to whats left  
Behind  
Your release is way overdue  
Let your tears be a friend to you  
  
If it hurts just a little be glad of it  
Dont get caught in the middle  
Thinking bout it  
If it hurts just a little be glad of it  
If you try you will see what will be  
Hurts just a little  
  
Silent eyes make your public life  
And the lies can be cold as ice  
How could you ever be so blind  
Bet you never ever ever thought  
That love could be so kind  
  
If it hurts just a little be glad of it  
Dont get caught in the middle  
Thinking bout it  
If it hurts just a little be glad of it  
If you try you will see what will be  
Hurts just a little

Its a crime of passion  
Thats just what it means to me  
  
If it hurt just a little be glad of it  
Dont get caught in the middle  
Thinking bout it  
If it hurts just a little be glad of it  
If you try you will see  
If it hurt just a little be glad of it  
Dont get caught in the middle  
Thinking bout it  
If hurts just a little be glad of it  
If you try you will see
