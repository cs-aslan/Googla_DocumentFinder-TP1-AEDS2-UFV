Oh you are so very strange  
Sometimes I think youve gone insane  
Twisted hearts youve gone insane  
In this giddy world  
Couldnt you begin to go  
Where odd lines we hardly know  
Couldnt you put in a goal  
Just for me  
  
Did I say I want to know  
Talking about a goal  
Would you please leave me alone  
Cant you see I want to be on my own  
  
Oh I would like to give you your head  
Just to see if you are dead  
Oh Id like to get into that pretty head  
And it would amuse me just to see  
How you feel about me  
How you feel about always getting fried  
  
Did I say I want to know  
Were talking about a goal  
Would you please leave alone  
Cant you see I want to be on my own  
Cant you see I want to be on my own  
  
OhIm going to fly Repeat x 3
