Its coming through a hole in the air  
From those nights in Tienanmen Square  
Its coming from the feel  
That this aint exactly real  
Or its real but it aint exactly there  
From the wars against disorder  
From the sirens night and day  
From the fires of the homeless  
From the ashes of the gay  
Democracy is coming to the USA  
  
Its coming through a crack in the wall  
On a visionary flood of alcohol  
From the staggering account  
Of the Sermon on the Mount  
Which I dont pretend to understand at all  
Its coming from the silence  
On the dock of the bay  
From the brave the bold the battered  
Heart of Chevrolet  
Democracy is coming to the USA  
  
Its coming from the sorrow in the street  
The holy places where the races meet  
From the homicidal bitching  
That goes down in every kitchen  
To determine who will serve and who will eat  
From the wells of disappointment  
Where the women kneel to pray  
For the grace of God in the desert here  
And the desert far away  
Democracy is coming to the USA  
  
Sail on sail on  
Oh mighty Ship of State  
To the Shores of Need  
Past the Reefs of Greed  
Through the Squalls of Hate  
Sail on sail on sail on sail on  
  
Its coming to America first  
The cradle of the best and of the worst  
Its here they got the range  
And the machinery for change  
And its here they got the spiritual thirst  
Its here the familys broken  
And its here the lonely say  
That the heart has got to open  
In a fundamental way  
Democracy is coming to the USA  
  
Its coming from the women and the men  
Oh baby well be making love again  
Well be going d
