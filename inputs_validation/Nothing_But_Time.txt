Rolling down two ninety five out of Portland Maine  
Still high from the people up there and feeling no pain  
Gonna make it to New Jersey gonna set it up and do it again  
  
I got a bottle of wine pass it over  
I got a broken white line Im still sober  
There aint nothin but time between this Silver Eagle  
And that New Jersey line  
  
Well its a rock and roll band or a movie you can take your pick  
And it aint bad work if you can get it  
But you gotta make it stick  
But getting any kind of sleep on this rolling motel thats the trick  
  
Its just a bottle of wine pass it over  
Its just a broken white line Im still sober  
Its just a whole lot of time in the twilight zone  
Between me and these friends of mine
