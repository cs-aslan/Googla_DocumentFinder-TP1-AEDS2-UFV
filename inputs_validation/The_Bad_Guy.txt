You know how William H Bonnies rockin  
I keep the home  two way contact for Johnny Cochran  
  
Be the same dudes testing your patience  
In them hospitals resting like patients confessing to agents  
You smell me you gotta spray the Wesson like fragrance  
And you pay your way out arrests and arraignments

If they see how the Rolls Royce smell  
All day I be emptying my in box and my whole voice mail
