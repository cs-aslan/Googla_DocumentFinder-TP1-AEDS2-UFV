Now theres something my daughter  
That I need to tell you  
And theres no easy way on your heart  
The truth is your mother and I have decided  
Were better off living apart  
But nothins gonna change between you and me  
Well only grow stronger in time  
As sure as the river will run to the sea  
You can always come runnin to this love of mine  
  
Til the end of forever  
The last day of never  
And through all of your life in this world  
Promise me youll always remember  
My love will follow you anywhere  
Til The end of forever I promise Ill always be there  
  
Well look back at the pieces  
That we put together  
And the puzzle will mean so much more  
Ill be right where ya found me  
Wrapped round your finger  
Like Ive been since the day you were born  
  
And wholl walk beside you  
When ya walk down the aisle  
When true love is takin your hand  
When youre lost in the eyes of your own child  
Youll remember this moment and youll understand  
  
Til the end of forever  
The last day of never  
And through all of your life in this world  
Promise me youll always remember  
My love will follow you anywhere  
Til The end of forever I promise Ill always be there  
  
Spread the wings of your dreams  
Thats my only prayer  
To Love every moment from sunrise to sunset  
In your heart is my heart I will be there  
  
Promise me youll always remember  
My love will follow you anywhere  
Til the end of forever I promise  
Til the end of forever I promise  
As God is my witness I promise Ill always be there  
  
So promise youll always remember Ill always be there
