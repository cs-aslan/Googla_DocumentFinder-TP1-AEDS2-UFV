We break break we break break we break break we breaking down  
We break break we break break we break break we breaking down  
  
Its getting later baby and Im getting curious  
Nobodys looking at us I feel delirious  
Cause the beat gonna chase my body  
Shakin aside my bones  
And you pushin all my buttons takin me outta my zone  
Yeah  
  
Bridge  
The way that you stare starts a fire in me  
Come up to my room you sexy little thing  
And lets play a game I wont be a tease  
Ill show you the boom my sexy little thing  
  
Chorus  
I wish you would push up on me  
I wish you would push up on me  
I wish you would light me up and say you want me  
Push up on me  
I wish you would push up on me  
I wish you would push up on me  
I wish you would light me up and say you want me  
Push up on me  
  
I know many guys just like ya extremely confident  
Got so much flavor with you like youre the perfect man  
You wanna make me chase ya like its a compliment  
But lets get right down to it  
I can be the girl that can break you down  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
We break break we break break we break break we breaking down  
We break break we break break we break break we breaking down  
  
I wanna see how you move it  
Show me show me how you do it  
You really got me on it I must confess I must confess  
Baby there aint nothing to it  
Baby who you think youre fooling  
You wanna come get me outta my dress  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
We break break we break break we break break we breaking down  
We break break we break break we break break we breaking down
