Whats in the drink chase the devil away  
Magic I think so I just say Chesay  
Chesay Chesay bring you good luck night and day  
Chesay Chesay thats the gypsy way  
  
Trouble is my middle name though its such a crying shame  
Try and try theres nothing I can do  
But Im feeling kinda strange feel like things are going to change  
Time my lucky star was shining through  
Chesay Chesay bring you good luck night and day  
Chesay Chesay thats the gypsy way  
  
Drink a cup of gypsy love just tip it up and then you just say Chesay  
Swallow once then swallow twice goes down so nice just say Chesay Hey  
  
Whats in the drink chase the devil away  
Magic I think so I just say Chesay  
Chesay Chesay bring you good luck night and day  
Chesay Chesay thats the gypsy way  
  
Chesay Chesay brings you good luck night and day  
Chesay Chesay thats the gypsy way  
Chesay Chesay brings you good luck night and day  
Chesay Chesay thats the gypsy way
