They say they like it now but in the market it  
May not go well as its too laid back  
You need some oomphpapa nothing like  
Frank Zappa  
And not New Wave they dont play that crap  
  
Tyr beating your head on a brick wall  
Hard like a stone  
Dont have time for the music  
They want the blood from a clone  
  
I hear a clock ticking  
I feel the nitpicking  
I almost quit kicking at the wall  
There seems a confusion under the illusion  
That they know just what will suit you all  
  
Beating my head on a brick wall  
Hard like a stone  
Aint got time for the music  
They want the blood from a clone  
  
There is no sense to it  
Pure pounds and pence to it  
Theyre so intense too makes me amazed  
Dont want no music but theyre making you  
sick with  
Some awful noises that may get played  
  
By beating their heads on a brick wall  
Hard like a stone  
Aint no messing round with music  
Give them the blood from a clone  
  
Where will it all lead us  
I thought we had freed us  
From the mundane seems Im wrong again  
Could be they lack roots theyre still wearing  
jack boots theyre  
Marching somewhere in the pouring rain  
  
Beating my head on a brick wall  
Hard like a stone  
Dont have time for the music  
They want the blood from a clone
