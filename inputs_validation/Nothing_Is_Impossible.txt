Isnt life strange  
A total mystery  
As we passed each day  
Did you notice me  
  
And I know girl  
Youve been looking at me  
And I know now  
That you and me were meant to be  
What would it take to realize  
That in my heart  
No matter what they say  
  
Chorus  
No matter what they say  
When it comes to love  
Two hearts are inseparable  
No matter what they say  
When it comes to love  
Nothing is impossible  
  
Walking down that road  
Its coming back to me  
Did you feel it inside  
A thousand memories  
  
Chorus  
  
When it comes to you and me  
Theres so much more  
Than they can see  
And thats how its meant to be  
  
Chorus
