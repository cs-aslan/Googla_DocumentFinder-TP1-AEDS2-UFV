I used to walk with you  
Along the avenue  
Our hearts were carefree and gay  
How could I know Id lose you  
Somewhere along the way  
  
The friends we used to know  
Would always smile hello  
No love like our love theyd say  
Then love slipped through our fingers  
Somewhere along the way  
  
I should forget  
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering everything  
Youre gone and yet  
Theres still a feeling deep inside  
That you will always be part of me  
  
Chorus  
So now I look for you  
Along the avenue  
And as I wander I pray  
That some day soon Ill find you  
Somewhere along the way  
  
I should forget  
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering everything  
Youre gone and yet  
Theres still a feeling deep inside  
That you will always be part of me  
  
Chorus  
  
Somewhere along the way
