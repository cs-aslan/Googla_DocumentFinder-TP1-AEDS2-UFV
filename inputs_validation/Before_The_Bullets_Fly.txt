You know I hate to leave you babe  
But I just cant waste my time  
Well youve got this jealous husband  
And Im far too young to die  
I must move on away from here  
Just before the bullets fly  
  
Ive always been a gabler  
Takin chances all my life  
Always smashin those love affairs  
Just like shootin dice  
I staged the game girl  
Thats what keeps me satisfied  
And I can leave it in the nick of time  
Just before the bullets fly  
  
Solo  
  
I lost my first bet  
When I was twentyone  
Found myself in New Orleans  
On the wrong end of a gun  
The stakes keep getting higher  
But somehow I Survive  
By knowin when the need became  
Just before the bullets fly  
Im knowing when the need became  
Just before the bullets fly  
Im knowing when the need became  
Just before the bullets fly
