Who cares Im in a trance I got no hope I dont stand a chance  
But its all right yes its all right  
Who knows well I dont care cause I dont fit in anywhere  
But its all right yes it is all right  
Well Im numb but thats my style  
Ive been numb for a little while  
And its all right yes its all right  
I checked out yesterday well theres nothing left to say  
But its all right yes its all right  
Dont see nothin in my eyes cause man Ive been lobotomized  
Cold inside anesthetized cause life has got me paralyzed  
Who says I have to pay I didnt want this anyway  
But its all right yes its all right  
Who says life is good Love thyself well I never could  
But its all right yes it is all right  
Im here dressed in black waiting for a heart attack  
But its all right yes its all right  
I try to talk I just cant speak the urge is strong  
But my brain is weak  
And its all right yes its all right  
Dont see nothin in my eyes cause man Ive been lobotomized  
Cold inside anesthetized cause life has got me paralyzed  
And who says life is good Love thyself well I never could  
But its all right yes its all right  
I checked out yesterday well theres nothing left to say  
But its all right yes its all right  
Dont see nothin in my eyes cause man Ive been lobotomized  
Im paralyzed  
Cold inside anesthetized yeah Im feelin otherwise  
Im paralyzed  
Dont see nothin in my eyes cause man Ive been lobotomized  
Im paralyzed  
Cold inside anesthetized yeah Im feelin otherwise  
Im paralyzed
