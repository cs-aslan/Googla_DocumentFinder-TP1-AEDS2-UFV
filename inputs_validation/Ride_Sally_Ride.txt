Sit yourself down  
Bang out a tune on that grand piano  
Sit yourself down  
Lay languidly down upon that sofa  
  
Ooh isnt it nice  
When your heart is made out of ice  
  
Ride Sally ride  
Its not your time or way of confusion  
Ride Sally ride  
Cause if you dont youll get a contusion  
  
Ooh isnt it nice  
When your heart is made out of ice  
  
Sit yourself down  
Take of your pants dont you know this is a party  
Sit yourself down  
Why do you think we brought all these people miss brandy  
  
Ooh isnt it nice  
When you find your hearts made out of ice  
  
Ride Sally ride  
Its not your time its just your confusion  
Ride Sally ride  
Its not your time youll get a contusion  
  
Ooh isnt it nice  
When you find your heart is made out of ice  
  
Ride sally ride  
Ride ride ride ride Sally ride Ride Sally ride  
Ride ride ride ride Sally ride Hey ride Sally ride  
Ride ride ride ride Sally ride Ride sally ride  
Ride ride ride ride Sally ride Ohohoh oh  
Ride ride ride ride Sally ride Heyheyhey heyhey
