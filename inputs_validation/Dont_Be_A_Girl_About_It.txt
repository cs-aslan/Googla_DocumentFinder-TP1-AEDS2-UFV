Any chance you get to play the warn out pity card  
Any opportunity to push my buttons hard  
Its getting old your poor me thoughts  
Believe me boy when I say so what  
  
This broken record thing has got to stop  
Im losing interest in your pillow talk  
  
And oh its not looking good  
And oh Im not in the mood  
And oh I cant get through  
To you  
  
Dont be a girl about it  
Cause I didnt say yes  
Dont be a girl about it  
Cause I wouldnt pretend  
Dont be a girl about it  
Now youre whining again  
Dont be a girl about it  
Youre such a girl about it  
  
Now youre up in arms because I say were not working out  
You wonder if I loved you from the start well I tell you what  
I knew a guy who changed my world  
And then he grew into a little girl  
  
This metamorphosis is just too much  
Youre crossing lines that I just cant let go on  
  
And oh its not looking good  
And oh Im not in the mood  
And oh I cant get through  
To you  
  
Dont be a girl about it  
Cause I didnt say yes  
Dont be a girl about it  
Cause I wouldnt pretend  
Dont be a girl about it  
And now youre whining again  
Dont be a girl about it  
Youre such a girl about it  
  
And oh Im sleeping with the enemy oh oh  
And oh Im counting sheep while youre in love  
  
I guess its true that love can grow in different directions  
I chose the high road and you chose to be a girl  
I know youre mad at me now  
Its all my fault somehow  
Here comes my favorite part  
Youre so misunderstood  
  
And oh its not looking good  
And oh Im not in the mood  
And oh yeah Im so through  
To you  
  
Dont be a girl about it  
Cause I didnt say yes  
Dont be a girl about it  
Cause I wouldnt pretend  
Dont be a girl about it  
And now youre whining again  
Dont be a girl about it  
Youre such a girl about it  
  
And oh Im sleeping with the enemy oh oh  
And oh Im counting sheep while youre in love  
Dont be a girl about it
