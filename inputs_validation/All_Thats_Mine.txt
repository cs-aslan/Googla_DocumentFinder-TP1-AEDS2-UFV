I know its hard to reach you  
I know its hard to breathe  
I know its hard to be you sometimes  
I cant imagine what that means  
  
This must be someone elses story  
I cant follow what youve planned  
How could this be about me  
Am I supposed to understand  
  
Like a ship on the ocean  
Heading out to sea  
You can hardly see it now  
Its a lot like you  
Lost like me  
  
Youre still looking for redemption  
Still cant find a trace  
If there is nothing after  
There ll be the saving grace  
  
Im giving you control now  
I need some kind of sign  
Cant take away the sorrow now  
I gave you all thats mine  
  
Like a ship on the ocean  
Heading out to sea  
You can hardly see it now  
Its a lot like you  
  
Like a ship on the ocean  
Heading out to sea  
You can hardly see it now  
Its a lot like you  
Lost like me
