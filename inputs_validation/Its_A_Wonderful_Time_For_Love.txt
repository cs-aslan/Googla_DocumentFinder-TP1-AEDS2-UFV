Verse  
Its a wonderful time for love  
Its a wonderful time for love  
Sun shines down from above  
  
Its a wonderful time for love  
And you think you have all you dreamed of  
But all the great blue skies just aint enough  
Chorus  
When the sun goes down  
We sleep safe and sound  
A wonderful time for love  
Time for dealing a different game  
One where we dont have to place the blame  
  
Chorus  
How much can we bear  
If pain is all we share  
A wonderful time for love  
Such a beautiful time to rise  
And walk away from all the endless lies  
And try to see the world through other eyes
