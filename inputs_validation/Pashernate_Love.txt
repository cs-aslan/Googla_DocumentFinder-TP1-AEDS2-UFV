Pashernate love  
In any form  
Whether real or a dream  
  
Pashernate love  
Could make your system erupt  
Into wild blisters and boils  
  
Oh as for me  
It still doesnt understand me  
It wouldnt lay one single finger on me  
  
Pashernate love  
Could make your Grandmother zoom  
Rollerskating back from the grave  
  
Pashernate love  
Could make your old Daddy feel  
Like he may have a reason to live  
  
Oh as for me  
It still doesnt understand me  
And it wouldnt lay one single finger on me  
  
Im always there  
Its always elsewhere  
  
Whoah Pashernate love  
Oh where are you  
Where are you  
Where are you  
Where are you  
Where are you  
Where are you  
Where are you  
Where are you  
Where are you  
Where are you  
Where are you  
Where are you
