Hey Creole Darlin  
Talk that French to me  
You know your love is somethin  
Like I aint never seen  
Im goin down down down down to New Orleans  
  
Your eyes shine line diamonds  
And those kisses sure make me scream  
There aint nothin like love on the bayou  
Honey I know you know what I mean  
Im goin down down down down to New Orleans  
Im goin down down down down to New Orleans  
  
They got the gumbo and the Creole  
They got the Quarter all night long  
I got my Delta Queen that makes my heart sing  
Man I aint never goin home  
Im goin down down down down to New Orleans
