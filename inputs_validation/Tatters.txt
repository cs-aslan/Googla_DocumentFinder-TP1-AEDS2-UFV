Some couples live in harmony  
Some do not  
Some couples yell and scream  
Some do not  
But what you said was something  
That I cant forget  
It echoes in my head  
Like a bullet made of lead  
Some people yell and scream  
And some do not  
Some people sacrifice their lives  
And some do not  
Some people wait for sleep  
To take them away  
While others read books endlessly  
Hoping problems will go away  
I know youre hoping everything  
Works out  
Neither one of us is  
The type who shouts  
You sleep in the bedroom  
While I pace up and down the hall  
Our baby stares at both of us  
Wondering which one of us to call  
I guess its true that not  
Every match burns bright  
I guess its true  
Not all that I say is right  
But what you said still bounces  
Around in my head  
Who thought this could happen to us  
When we first went to bed  
Im told in the end  
That none of this matters  
All couples have troubles  
And none of this matters  
But what you said  
Still echoes in my head  
And Im still in the hallway  
Downstairs sleeping alone instead  
I know you dont care  
But heres my last thought  
Not that it matters  
But heres the last thing I thought  
Our little thing is lying  
Here in tatters  
And you my dear  
Dont have any manners  
Sad to leave this way  
To leave it all in tatters  
Saddening to leave this way  
To leave it all in tatters  
I suppose that we all could say  
That nothing of it matters  
Still its sad  
To see everything in tatters
