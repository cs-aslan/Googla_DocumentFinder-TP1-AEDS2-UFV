Ladies and gentlemen  
The Keeper of the keys the Countess of the clink  
The Mistress of murderers row  
Matron Mama Morton  
Ask any of the chickies in my pen  
Theyll tell you Im the biggest mutha hen  
I love them all and all of them love me  
Because the system works the system called reciprocity  
Got a little motto  
Always sees me through  
When youre good to Mama  
Mamas good to you  
Theres a lot of favors  
Im prepared to do  
You do one for Mama  
Shell do one for you  
They say that life is tit for tat  
And thats the way I live  
So I deserve a lot of tat  
For what Ive got to give  
Dont you know that this hand  
Washes that one too  
When youre good to Mama  
Mamas good to you  
If you want my gravy  
Pepper my raggoo  
Spice it up for Mama  
Shell get hot for you  
When they pass that basket  
Folks conribute too  
You put in for Mama  
Shell put out for you  
The folks a top the ladder  
Are the ones the world adores  
So boost me up my ladder kid  
And Ill boost you up yours  
Lets all stroke together  
Like the Princeton crew  
When youre strokin Mama  
Mamas strokin you  
So whats the one conclusion  
I can bring this number to  
When youre good to Mama  
Mamas good to you
