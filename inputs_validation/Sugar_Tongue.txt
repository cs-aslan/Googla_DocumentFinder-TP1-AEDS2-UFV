All the fur and fin will lose again  
Cause our better is their worst reckonin  
And our finefeathered friends will sing until they bleed  
And how will we replace that symphony  
  
Ive got the blackest boots the whitest skin  
Satisfy my sugar tongue again  
Bring me love that buys us shoeshine days  
Guilded verses for your ethylene  
And sing it to me free and clean  
  
All the kids come home with foreign limbs  
From hunting trips abroad they lose again  
And well teach them how to talk  
And whistle while they walk  
And do the dirty work of battle hymns  
  
Ive got the blackest boots the whitest skin  
Satisfy my sugar tongue again  
Sing me love that buys us shoeshine days  
Guilded verses for your ethylene  
And sing it to me free and clean  
  
Drinking tea with milk and Janjaweed  
Pontificate on genocide or greed  
With a spoonful of descent  
For the orchestra of need  
Is just enough to please this colony  
  
Ive got the blackest boots the whitest skin  
Satisfy my sugar tongue again  
Bring me lullabies and morphinedreams  
Belladonna with her atropine  
And sing it to me free and clean
