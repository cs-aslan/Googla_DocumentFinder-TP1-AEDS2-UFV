At any moment hell be walking through that door  
But he wont find me behind it  
Cause the feeling is gone and just wont come back any more  
I worked so hard to find it  
  
Ive been up down tryin to get the feeling again  
All around tryin to get the feeling again  
That one that made me shiver  
Make my knees start to quiver every time he walks in  
Ive look high low everywhere I possibly can  
But theres just no tryin to get the feeling again  
It seemed to disappear as fast at it came  
  
Chorus  
Read every book looked for every meditation and poem  
Just to bring home that old sweet sensation  
But it aint no use to me to try to get the feeling again  
  
When did it leave me  
How did I come to miss use such a beautiful bonnet  
But baby believe me Ive done everything I can do  
But somehow its no returnin  
Ive been up down tryin to get the feeling again  
Like a bloodhound searching for a long lost friend  
Could you help me rediscover  
The way to rebe his lover once again  
  
Chorus  
  
I want to get that feeling again
