Youre such a poet  
I wish I could be Wesley Willis  
My words would flow like honey  
Sweet and laid on thick  
Youre so edgy  
You dont even need a rhyming dictionary  
I wipe my hands on your jeans  
Cause they are more distressed  
So they say youve got a CD  
And they claim you can barely read  
But you say dont bother me with all of your reality  
  
But it could be so simple  
you were thinking  
Life should be that simple  
Who would have thought it  
I wish it were just so simple  
dont know what you were thinking  
But the points been missed  
Youve made a mess  
Who would have guessed  
That its as simple as it seems  
  
So what youre a genius  
But youve got a lot to learn  
Like the time you lost your apartment  
Cause you bought too much Vuitton  
You park in a loading zone  
You sleep with the lights all on  
You cross your Is and dot your ts  
All it goes to show  
  
That it could be so simple  
you were thinking  
Life should be that simple  
Who would have thought it  
I wish it were just that simple  
dont know what you were thinking  
The points been missed  
Weve made a mess  
Who would have guessed  
That its as simple as it seems  
  
Im not saying that its a piece of cake  
Just take a moment to reevaluate  
The possibilities  
The situations  
The opportunities  
That are waiting  
Oh the possibilities  
Oh I  
  
It could it could be that simple  
you were thinking  
Life should be that simple  
Who would have thought it  
I wish it were just so simple  
dont know what you were thinking  
Youre in a haze  
Its just a phase  
You know this maze  
Is as simple as it seems  
  
We could talk all day  
About your eccentricities  
What I mean to say  
Oh is that I need you listen please  
And focus on lifes simplicities  
So dont be afraid to strip it away  
Cause at the end of the day  
Its still as simple as it seems  
  
It is all so simple  
Just deal with it
