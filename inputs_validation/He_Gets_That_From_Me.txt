His early morning attitude  
You have to drag him outta bed  
Only frosted flakes will do  
He gets that from me  
Yeah he gets that from me  
  
His curly hair and his knobby knees  
The way the sun brings those freckles out  
Talkin talk never miss a beat  
Yeah he gets that from me  
He gets that from me  
  
He looks at me with those big brown eyes  
Hes got me in the palm of his hands  
And I swear sometimes  
Its just like youre here again  
  
He smiles that little crooked smile  
Theres no denying hes your child  
Without him I dont know what Id do  
He gets that from you  
Oh he gets that from you  
  
How he loves your old guitar  
Yeah hes taught himself today  
He melts my heart  
Tells me he loves me every day  
  
And cracks a joke at the perfect time  
Makes me laugh when I want to cry  
That boy is everything to me  
He gets that from you  
He gets that from you  
  
Last night I heard him pray  
Lord help me and momma make it through  
And tell daddy well be ok  
  
He said he sure misses you  
He sure misses you  
He really misses you  
He gets that from me
