With my suitcase in my hand

With my suitcase in my hand

Shes in some faroff land

And well leave this ol highway behind  
  
Well the ocean took my baby  
My baby stole my heart from me

She packed it all up in a suitcase

Just as far as my poor eyes can see  
Yes Im awalkin down your highway  
Just as far as my eyes can see  
From the Golden Gate Bridge  
All the way to the Statue of Liberty
