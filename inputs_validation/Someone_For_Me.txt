Im here alone on a Friday night  
Waiting here beside the phone  
The TV radio and me  
Really aint been getting along  
  
I wish that I could fly away  
And party till the break of day  
And there Id be sure to meet  
The guy that would be special to me  
  
Then mama comes and asks me  
Why am I dreaming sitting alone  
Why not go out and have some fun  
Its the only way Ill ever find  
Someone for me  
While I am young and seventeen  
  
Chorus  
Someone for me  
Someone for me  
Ive got to go find someone someone  
Someone for me  
Ive got to find someone yeah  
  
Now heres a party down at Angies house  
With people packed against the wall  
Im sitting in the corner here  
Trying to make some sense of it all  
  
And when I least expect it  
Meeting the guy I see in my dreams  
Here he is walking up to me and asking  
If Id like to come and dance with him  
I think Ive found someone for me  
  
Chorus  
  
And so Im finding out that dreams you believe in  
Can come to be  
And now Im looking up to find the joy and happiness  
Can come to you and me  
At last Ive found someone for me  
  
Chorus
