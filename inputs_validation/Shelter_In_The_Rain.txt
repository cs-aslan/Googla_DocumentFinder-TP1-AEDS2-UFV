When the lights are down  
And the stage is bare  
And no more magics in the air  
Theres not a friend in sight to care  
Your tears no one will share  
Ill be your comfort through your pain  
Ill be your shelter in the rain  
When your sad is bad and your bad is worst  
And theres no who to turn to first  
When youve done everything you can  
No ones there to take your hand  
Ill be you comfort through your pain  
Ill be your shelter in the rain  
When youve looked around  
And havent seen me anywhere  
Though when you were down  
I lifted you up from there  
There isnt a thing you can ask of me  
I wont do  
Just you put your trust in me  
My love will see you through  
When the final candles flickered out  
Why me is all you can think about  
When all your joy has disappeared  
Your future isnt clear  
Ill be you comfort through your pain  
Ill be your shelter in the rain  
When all the odds say theres no chance  
Amidst the final dance  
Ill be you comfort through your pain  
Ill be your shelter in the rain  
Ill be you comfort through your pain  
Yes Ill be your shelter in the rain rain  
Ill be your shelter  
Be your shelter be your shelter in the rain
