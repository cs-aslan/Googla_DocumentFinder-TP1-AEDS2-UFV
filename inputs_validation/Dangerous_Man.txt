He could word it out like a dangerous man  
How could you value his intentions  
Martin had the devil just like anyone can  
He spoke words they were frightened to mention  
  
Chorus  
Yesterday aint gone  
We just pushed it aside  
Out in the jungle  
There aint nowhere you can hide  
Theres a different smile on your face today  
Though you wear it well theres a lot to say  
Theres a different mood in the world tonight  
If we can do it good we can do it right  
  
John he washed it over with a confidence tan  
I know peace and love aint prevention  
Brian in the closet with his masterplan  
Build them up its so sad they forget you  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat x2  
Are we not men did you save us  
Are we not men did you try did you try  
  
We have been Repeat x3  
We have been denied  
  
I could word it out like a dangerous man  
If they landed here wed collect them  
Yellow black or white here in the circus of man  
I dont know I dont care I forget you  
  
Chorus
