Lucy I know what youre going to going to do  
Oh Lucy look what youre doing Im doing it too  
Now youre looking for God in exciting new ways  
I say trust Him at once which is something these days  
Lucy cant dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Lucy cant dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Did the world just explode  
Dont recognize anyone  
But youve still got me under your thumb  
Lucy cant dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy  
In this sexual noise vicious chords offer joy  
You live and you die in the blink of an eye  
Well I cant make you dance  
Dance to the noise  
Lucy cant dance but she knows what the noise can do  
Dance to the noise  
Lucy cant dance but she knows what the noise can do  
Lucy I know what youre going to going to do  
But you cant buy me off in this serial world  
Who who who died and made you material girl  
Lucy cant dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
So Ill spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong  
Guess Ill put all my eggs in a postmodern song  
Lucy cant dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Or this shallow orb mugged by reality  
Just a few simple words like I love you I need you  
Live and you die in the blink of an eye  
Still I cant make you dance  
Dance to the noise  
Lucy cant dance but she knows what the noise can do
