Before you go  
Id like to say  
You give me so much satisfaction  
Started up a chain reaction  
Tryin to work out in my mind  
A way to let you know  
Oh darling  
  
Youre asking me to be strong  
But I cant see the wrong  
In what Im doing  
Just want to hold you every day  
Locked inside this feeling  
I want you here to stay  
  
Holding  
Cause Im holding Im holding  
Im holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
Holding  
Im holding on Still holding  
Still holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
  
What can I do  
But to be true  
Im getting such a strong sensation  
And its not my imagination  
Its not me to pretend  
So try and understand  
Oh darling  
  
My heart is chosen to belong  
And I dont see the wrong  
In what Im feeling  
I know its time to say goodbye  
But Im not living in a lie  
I want you here to stay  
  
Holding  
Cause Im holding Im holding  
Im holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
Holding  
Im holding on Still holding  
Still holding on  
To the pieces of a dream

Im holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
Holding

Still holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
  
Oh baby  
Youre asking me to be strong  
But I still cant see the wrong  
In what Im doing  
Just want to hold you every day  
Locked inside this feeling
