Gonna catch a freight train as far as I can Lord  
I dont care which way it goes  
Gonna climb a mountain the highest mountain Lord  
Jump off aint nobody gonna know  
  
Cant you see oh cant you see  
What that womans been doin to me  
Cant you see cant you see  
What that womans been doin to me  
  
Gonna buy a ticket go as far as I can Lord  
I aint never coming back  
Take me a southbound all the way down Lord  
Till the train run out of track  
  
Cant you see oh cant you see  
What that womans been doin to me  
Cant you see cant you see  
What that womans been doin to me  
  
Cant you see oh cant you see  
What that womans been doin to me  
Cant you see cant you see  
What that womans been doin to me
