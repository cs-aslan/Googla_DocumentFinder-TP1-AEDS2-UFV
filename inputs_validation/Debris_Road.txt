She nails down moon beams  
And talks in double time  
Stumbling down to wherever she goes  
I live in the meantime  
And I get frustrated  
So I put my wager on Debris Road  
  
Chorus  
It keeps me running down Debris Road  
Im not scared but its somewhere I cling to  
All the places I still want to go  
They wont cast a shadow on my Debris Road  
  
I get frustrated looking for moonbeams  
They always fall where I never go  
Cause I like the daylight and I like a good life  
Running so fast down Debris Road  
  
Chorus  
  
Someone got moonfaced and someone gets tearful  
Talking so much that they really dont know  
Sitting up all night singing songs till daylight  
Striking a match with the devil below  
  
Chorus
