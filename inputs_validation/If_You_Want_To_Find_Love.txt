He was sitting on a bar stool  
A picture from a cheating song  
Shed been standing by the jukebox  
Dropping quarters all night long  
  
He said tell me are you lonely  
Is there some place we can go  
She said cowboy you know Im lonely  
But theres something you should know  
  
If you wanna find gold  
Go looking in the mountains  
If you wanna find silver  
Go digging in stones  
If you wanna find heaven  
Go reading in the Bible  
If you wanna find love  
Go looking at home  
  
She touched the gold ring on his finger  
And held it to the jukebox light  
And she said Stranger think what youre losing  
If you leave here with me tonight  
  
So he hold her body closer  
She felt feelings shed never known  
And he said thank you for the lesson  
And if you need me Ill be at home  
  
If you wanna find gold
