When the journey toilsome grows  
Manys the conflict cares and woes  
Going lifes way going life way  
  
How we long for peace and love  
Home in the Fathers house above  
Going lifes way going life way  
  
Sweet the thought that cares will cease  
Over the times our joys increase  
Going lifes way going life way  
  
On the way well rather sing  
Praises to Christ our Lord and King  
Going lifes way going life way  
  
Though the dark way rugged might be  
Its his own hands guiding we seek  
Leading us too that mansion above  
Where there is joy joy joy rapture and love  
  
Jesus leads all shepherds friends  
All of his own He will defend  
Going lifes way going lifes way  
  
Never will our Lord forsake  
Us till in life we shall awake  
Ending lifes way going lifes way  
  
Though the dark way rugged might be  
Its his own hands keeps aguiding we seek  
Leading us too that mansion above  
Where there is joy joy joy rapture and love
