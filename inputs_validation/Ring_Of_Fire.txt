Fun girl you tempted me a feast of sparks  
In the night is what I need  
Ooh Im aready to roar and Im aready for more  
And Im aready to burn like the light into the dawn  
  
Oh I gotta see the fire in me turning into ecstasy  
So stick around and settle down enjoy the mystery  
A voice in the wilderness theres somethin in the air  
A little love wont bring your precious self a secret flame  
  
Fun girl  
Are you ready ready for fun girl  
Feels like fire  
Are you ready ready for fun girl  
Ring of fire  
  
I left so indiscreet youre stealing all of the fire  
Electric me  
Im staring into the sun Im staring into a gun  
Im staring at the sky turn it out and let it burn  
  
Fun girl  
Are you ready ready for fun girl  
Feels like fire  
Are you ready ready for fun girl  
Ring of fire  
  
Fun girl you tempted me ya cut me up  
Like a knife so tenderly  
Oh I gotta see the fire in me burning up my ecstasy  
A little love wont bring your precious self a secret flame  
Oh no  
  
Fun girl  
Are you ready ready for fun girl  
Feels like fire  
Are you ready ready for fun girl  
Ring of fire  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
