Fatal beauty the chokin kind  
Dangerous feeling in this heart of mine  
How can you love me  
And treat me so unkind  
You got me floppin like a fish in a pan  
Aint no way to treat your man  
  
Maydell  
Baby wont you please love me  
Oh Maydell sure put the squeeze on me  
I dont know why I love you  
You put me through hell  
I cant break your spell Maydell  
  
Fire spreads quick through the neighborhood  
Talk is cheap when the storys good  
Nobody said you did but everybody said that you would  
You got me feelin like a dog chasin his tail  
I know Ill never catch you  you play the game too well  
  
Maydell  
Baby wont you please love me  
Oh Maydell sure put the squeeze on me  
Well I dont know why I love you  
You put me through hell  
I cant break your spell Maydell  
  
Every time I try to walk away  
Just walk away  
You bat them eyes beg me to stay  
Honey wont you stay  
Ruby red lips callin my name  
Forget about the sorrow and the shame  
Maydell  
  
Well every time I try to walk away  
Ooo just walk away  
You bat them eyes beg me to stay  
Honey wont you stay  
Ruby red lips callin my name  
Forget about the sorrow and the shame  
  
Maydell  
Baby wont you please love me  
Oh Maydell sure put the squeeze on me  
Well I dont know why I love you  
You put me through hell  
I cant break your spell  
  
Maydell  
Baby wont you please love me  
Oh Maydell sure put the squeeze on me  
Well I dont know why I love you  
You put me through hell  
I cant break your spell  
Cant break the spell  
Cant break the spell Maydell  
Ohhh
