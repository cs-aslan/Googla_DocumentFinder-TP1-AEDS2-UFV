Mommy had A little baby  
There he is Fast asleep  
Hes just A little plaything  
Why not Wake him up  
Cute Cute Little baby  
Little pee pee Little toes  
Now hes comin to me  
Crawl across The kitchen floor  
  
Baby baby please let me hold him  
I want to make him stay up all night  
Sister sister hes just a plaything  
We want to make him stay up all night  
Yeah we do  
  
See him drink From a bottle  
See him eat From a plate  
Cute Cute As a button  
Dont you want to make him Stay up late  
And were having fun With no money  
Little smile On his face  
Dont cha love The little baby  
Dont you want to make him Stay up late  
  
Chorus
