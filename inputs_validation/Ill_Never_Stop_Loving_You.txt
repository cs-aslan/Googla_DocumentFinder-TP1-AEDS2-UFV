One day Ill stop breathing  
My heart will stop beating  
I wont see your face again  
This flesh and blood is weak  
Life isnt ours to keep  
Sometime it has to end nd nd echo  
In time even memories fade away  
With time you will learn to forgive and forget  
The mistakes that Ive made  
I broke some promises  
Sometimes I lied to you  
One thing will always be true  
Ill never stop loving you  
  
Fallin from your grace  
Youll never be replaced  
Lord knows how hard Ive tried  
But it just aint no use  
I thought I could shake you loose  
Im still torn up inside  
In time even memories fade away  
With time you will learn to forgive and forget  
The mistakes that Ive made  
Ive broke some promises  
Sometimes I lied to you  
But one thing will always be true  
Ill never stop loving you  
  
I broke some promises  
Sometimes I lied to you  
But one thing will always be true  
Ill never stop loving you  
  
No I will never stop lovin you
