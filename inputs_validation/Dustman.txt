It took three million years Now its my turn to see it  
Ive got to go back I just dont believe it Do you love it  
Oh I bet you do Do you need it  
Well Im just like you Smiley bug eyed mung worm at the bottom of the bottle  
Lay of its back on the bottom of the bottle  
It took three million years to meet Mr Helpful  
But now that Ive meet him Im extremely doubtful  
  
Are you healthy Well I just eat fruit  
But I tell you man It just dont suit  
Youre the bug eyed mung worm at the bottom of the bottle  
Lay on its back and talking pure twaddle  
Its my turn now and theres always a houseful  
And saying the right thing Its always a mouthful  
It took three million years to meet Mr Moonlight  
To finally ask him To put everything right  
  
Youre the big bug eyed mung worm at the bottom of the bottle  
Lay on its back and your talking pure twaddle  
To make you more smiley You drink olive oil  
It gives me pure headache When your cooking with foil  
Its my turn now And theres always a houseful  
And saying the right thing its always a mouthful
