Where I walk  
And life is warm  
Sun and breath  
Hopefully here  
All our hearts are blessed  
Texas real  
A woman sworn to man  
Here I tried  
Here I tried  
To be the best  
So hot its white and real to me  
Id stay awake all night  
Asking your silent sympathy  
I know something new  
Southern butterfly and you  
I know something new  
Southern butterfly with you  
Texas real  
A woman sworn to man  
Here I tried  
Here I tried  
To be the best  
So hot its fine and real real me  
Id stay awake all night  
Asking your silent sympathy  
I know something new  
Southern butterfly with you  
I know something new  
Southern butterfly and you  
I know something new  
Southern butterfly and you  
I know something new  
Southern butterfly with you
