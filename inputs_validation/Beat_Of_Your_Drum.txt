Photograph king watches you go  
Fashions may change heaven knows but you still leave a stain on me  
  
Supplement queen your colours may fade  
Seasons may change weather blows but you still leave a mark on me  
  
Wrongnegative fadesnever the twain reckless and tame  
  
I like the beat of your drum  
I like to look in your eyes  
I like to look through your things  
Id like to beat on your drum  
  
I like the smell of your flesh  
I like the dirt that you dish  
I like the clothes that you wear  
Id like to beat on your drum  
  
Disco bratfollow the pack  
Watching you peel heaven knows prison cant hold all this greedy intention  
  
Vanitys childpicture you now  
Music may changehidiho keen to follow your nose  
  
Wronglove out of tune  
Sweet is the night bright light destroys me  
  
I like the beat of your drum  
I like to look in your eyes  
I like to look through your things  
Id like to beat on your drum  
  
I like the smell of your flesh  
I like the dirt that you dish  
I like the clothes that you wear  
Id like to beat on your drum  
  
Id like to beat on your drum  
Id like to beat on your drum  
I like your face in the crowd  
Id like to beat on your drum  
  
Id like to beat on your drum  
Id like to beat on your drum  
Id like to blow on your horn  
Id like to beat on your drum
