I never wanted to be  
A man of mystery  
My lifes an open book  
by James Joyce and Agatha Christie  
  
Sometimes I get confused  
Somewhere around page two  
I live the perfect crime  
And crime pays more than it used to  
  
Theyre checkin the evidence  
May be come charges pressed  
The only one they got me on  
is some misdemeanor craziness  
  
CHORUS  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
If they solve my life if they find me out  
Never thought to keep all I have found  
I hae had my fun If It All Falls Down  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I hve had my fund I have bought a few rounds  
And been out on the town way out on the town  
Way way way out If It All Falls Down  
  
Never wanted to be  
A part of history  
I have my days in the sun  
A beach bum a man for all sea sides  
Guidance counselor said  
Your scores are antiheroic  
Computer recommends  
Harddrinking calypso poet  
  
Studied life at sea  
Studied life in bars  
Never passed my SATs  
So I thought Id study extra hard  
  
CHROUS  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I have learned my trade from the inside out  
I can strum real hard I can play real loud  
I can charm a crowd If It All Falls Down  
  
If It all Falls Down falls down falls down  
I can warm a crowd I can make them shout  
I can juggle verbs adverbs and nouns  
I can make them dance till they all fall down  
We had plenty of doctors  
We had plenty of lawyers  
We had people to make us things  
We had people to sell us those things  
We didnt have enough room for those things  
We build lots of self storage  
Calypso poet shortage  
Calypso poet shortage  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
Ill have filled that void from city to town  
Ill have spent my money and taken my bows  
Ill have had my fun If It All Falls Down  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
If they solve my life if they find me out  
Never thought to keep all I have found  
I have had my fun If It All Falls Down  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I can charm a crowd till they snake danced round  
With calypso beat down island sound  
I can make them dance till they all fall down  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I can charm a crowd I can make them shout  
I can juggle verbs adverbs and nouns  
I can make them dance till they all fall down
