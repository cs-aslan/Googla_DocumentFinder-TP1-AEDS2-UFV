Dont want to be an American Idiot  
Dont want a nation under the new media  
Can you hear the sound of hysteria  
The subliminal mind fuck America  
  
Welcome to a new kind of tension  
All across the alienation  
Where everything isnt meant to be ok  
Television dreams of tomorrow  
Were not the ones meant to follow  
For thats enough to argue  
  
Well Maybe I am the faggot America  
Im not a part of a redneck agenda  
Now everybody do the propaganda  
And sing along to the age of paranoia  
  
Dont want to be an American Idiot  
One nation controlled by the media  
Information age of hysteria  
Is Calling out to idiot America
