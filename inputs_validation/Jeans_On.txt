You and me well go motorbike ridin in the sun and the wind and the rain  
I got money in my pocket a tiger in my tank  
And Im king of the road again  
  
When I wake up in the mornin light  
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right  
I pull my blue jeans on I pull my old blue jeans on chch  
I pull my blue jeans on I pull my old blue jeans on chch
