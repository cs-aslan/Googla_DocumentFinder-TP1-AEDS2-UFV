Ive discovered for myself this time  
The start of everything to me  
Is to know our love is older than the sea  
But dont let another flame inside  
Your fireproof heart  
Cause Im not your fulltime lover  
And its tearing me apart  
Ive been hangin on this line too long  
  
8557019  
Dont you ever answer  
8557019  
Dont you hear the word  
Search for a sign  baby  
She was the past and the future  
I just got burned  
8557019  
Is a private number  
I know in your mind that you think  
Its a crime but I had to call  
First and last  there will  
Never be a past or a future  
If you kill my phone  
  
Baby lifts her eyes  
And Im a slave to all the lies  
And Im forever lost  
I believe in you and me  
Together and it keeps this love alive  
  
8557019  
Dont you ever answer  
8557019  
Dont you hear the word  
Search for the sign  baby  
She was the past and the future  
I just got burned  
  
I have suffered for my sins today  
With the pain of love  
Before the dawning comes  
The darker is the night  
Im born to be the one to share your life  
That shows I dont need no operator  
I dont want no one to know  
How much I need you  
  
8557019  
Dont you ever answer  
I know in your mind that you think  
Its a crime  but I had to call  
First and the last  there will  
Never be a past or a future  
If you kill my phone  
  
Baby lifts her eyes and Im a slave to all the lies  
And Im forever lost  
I believe in you and me together  
And it keeps this love alive
