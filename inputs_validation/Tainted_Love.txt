Sometimes I feel Ive got to  
Run away Ive got to  
Get away  
From the pain you drive into the heart of me  
The love we share  
Seems to go nowhere  
And Ive lost my light  
For I toss and turn I cant sleep at night  
  
Once I ran to you I ran  
Now Ill run from you  
This tainted love youve given  
I give you all a boy could give you  
Take my tears and thats not nearly all  
Oh Tainted love  
Tainted love  
  
Now I know Ive got to  
Run away Ive got to  
Get away  
You dont really want anymore from me  
To make things right  
You need someone to hold you tight  
And you think love is to pray  
But Im sorry I dont pray that way  
  
Once I ran to you I ran  
Now Ill run from you  
This tainted love youve given  
I give you all a boy could give you  
Take my tears and thats not nearly all  
Oh Tainted love  
Tainted love  
  
Dont touch me please  
I cannot stand the way you tease  
I love you though you hurt me so  
Now Im gonna pack my things and go  
Tainted love tainted love x2  
Touch me baby tainted love x2  
Tainted love x3
