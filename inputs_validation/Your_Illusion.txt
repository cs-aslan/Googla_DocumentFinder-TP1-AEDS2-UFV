You say you want to kill yourself  
It might make it just a little bit easier  
You think youre the only one who hurts  
Try looking just a little bit harder  
I dont know why youre holding on  
To the damage thats been done  
Cause youve got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on trying to change your conclusion  
But youve got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on dying cause youre busy wasting life  
Dont disguise your emptiness  
By placing blame on me and everyone else  
Protected by your safety nets  
But you cant put the heart of your fears at rest  
All I feel is deep regret for what you have become  
Youve got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on trying to clear the confusion  
But youve got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on dying cause youre busy wasting  
I keep on trying cause youre busy wasting life  
Youre busy wasting life  
Youre busy wasting life  
I cannot go on this way  
I bring no consolation for you and your pain  
No one else can change your fate  
Youll have to do it for yourself  
Youve got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on trying to clear the confusion  
But youve got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on dying cause youre busy wasting life  
Youre busy wasting life  
Youre busy wasting life youve got me wrapped up  
Youre busy wasting life cause I keep on trying  
Youre busy wasting life youve got me wrapped up  
Youre busy wasting life and I keep on dying
