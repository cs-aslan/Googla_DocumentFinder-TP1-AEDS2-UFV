Have I gone crazy  
Is there someone new  
Something strange is going on  
Between me and you  
But tell me baby  
Tell me its not true  
Cause Ive been hearing things about you  
  
Are you unhappy  
Are you lonely too  
Wont you tell me face to face  
What youre gonna do  
Well I still love you  
But Im nobodys fool  
Ive been hearing things about you  
  
Yeah I heard Ive been dancin  
When youre out there runnin round  
And I heard youve been seein  
Some stranger you have found  
And I heard youve been thinkin  
About tellin me were through  
Yeah Ive been hearing things about you  
  
Yeah I heard youve been thinkin  
About tellin me were through  
Ive been hearing things oh I aint naming names  
Ive been hearing things about you
