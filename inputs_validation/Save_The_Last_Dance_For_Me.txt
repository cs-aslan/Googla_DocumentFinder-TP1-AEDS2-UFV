You can danceevery dance with the guy  
Who gives you the eyelet him hold you tight  
You can smileevery smile for the man  
Who held your hand neath the pale moon light  
But dont forget whos takin you home  
And in whose arms youre gonna be  
So darlin save the last dance for me  
  
Oh I know that the musics fine  
Like sparklin winego and have your fun  
Laugh and singbut while were apart  
Dont give your heart to anyone  
But dont forget whos takin you home  
And in whose arms youre gonna be  
So darlin save the last dance for me  
  
Baby dont you know I love you so  
Cant you feel it when we touch  
I will never never let you go  
I love you oh so much  
  
You can dancego and carry on  
Till the night is gone  
And its time to go  
If he asks if youre all alone  
Can he walk you homeyou must tell him no  
Cause dont forget whos taking you home  
And in whose arms youre gonna be  
Save the last dance for me  
  
Cause dont forget whos taking you home  
And in whose arms youre gonna be  
So darlingsave the last dance for me  
Save the last dance for me  
Save the last dance for me
