Pick it Up  
  
I was blind now I see  
Love has got a hold of me  
Now I sing cause I am free  
  
So Im  
So Im Laying Down My Life  
And I am taking up my cross  
  
Im taking up my cross  
Laying down my life  
All for the Glory of Your Name  
  
Living my whole Life  
All for You Jesus  
Taking up my cross everyday  
  
Pick it up  
  
Pick it up  
  
I was lost now Im found  
Put my feet on solid ground  
Now I sing cause I am Free  
  
So Im  
So Im Laying Down My Life  
And I am taking up my cross  
  
Im taking up my cross  
Laying down my life  
All for the Glory of Your Name  
  
Living my whole Life  
All for You Jesus  
Taking up my cross everyday  
  
I Choose to stand for my generation  
I Choose to stand for my generation  
I Choose to stand for my generation  
I Choose to stand for my generation  
  
Pick it up  
  
Im taking up my cross  
Laying down my life  
All for the Glory of Your Name  
  
Living my whole Life  
All for You Jesus  
Taking up my cross everyday  
  
Im taking up my cross  
Im taking up my cross  
Im taking up my cross  
Im taking up my cross  
  
Pick it Up
