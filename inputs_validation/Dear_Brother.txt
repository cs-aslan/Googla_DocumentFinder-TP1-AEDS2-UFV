Dear Brother Mama left us this morning  
Deaths angels took her away  
Shes gone to meet Daddy up there in Heaven  
But well meet again someday  
She left this world with a smile on her face  
Whispering the Saviours name  
Dear Brother Mama left us this morning  
For the city where there is no pain  
As I stood by her bedside those last few moments  
I lived my childhood again  
I thought of you Brother and of the old homestead  
And my tears they fell like rain  
She left this world with a smile on her face  
Whispering the Saviours name  
Dear Brother Mama left us this morning  
For the city where there is no pain
