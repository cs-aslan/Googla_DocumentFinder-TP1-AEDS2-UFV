I know that theres a reason why I need to be alone  
I need to find a silent place that I can call my own  
Is it mine Lord is it mine  
When everythings dark and nothing seems right  
Theres nothing to win and theres no need to fight  
I never cease to wonder at the cruelty of this land  
But it seems a time of sadness is a time to understand  
Is it mine Lord is it mine  
When everythings dark and nothing seems right  
You dont have to win and theres no need to fight  
If only I could find a way  
To feel your sweetness through the day  
The love that shines around me could be mine  
So give us an answer wont you  
We know what we have to do  
There must be a thousand voices trying to get through
