Something is about to give  
I can feel it coming  
I think I know what it means  
Im not afraid to die  
Im not afraid to live  
And when Im flat on my back  
I hope to feel like I did  
  
Cause hardness it sets in  
You need some protection  
The thinner the skin  
  
I want you to know  
That you dont need me anymore  
I want you to know  
You dont need me anyone anything at all  
  
Whos to say when the wind will take you  
Whos to know what it is will break you  
I dont know which way the wind will blow  
Whos to know when the times come around  
Dont want to see you cry  
I know that this is not goodbye  
  
In summer I can taste the salt in the sea  
Theres a kite blowing out of control on a breeze  
I wonder whats gonna happen to you  
You wonder what has happened to me  
  
Im a man Im not a child  
A man who sees  
The shadow behind your eyes  
  
Whos to say when the wind will take you  
Whos to know what it is will break you  
I dont know which way the wind will blow  
Whos to know when the times come around  
Dont want to see you cry  
I know that this is not goodbye  
  
Did I waste it  
Not so much I couldnt taste it  
Life should be fragrant  
Roof top to the basement  
The last of the rock stars  
When hip hop drives the big cars  
In the mean time when new media  
Was the big idea
