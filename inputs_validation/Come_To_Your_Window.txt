Im leaving in the quiet early morning  
When night has left the sky  
Before the dew is dry  
But its not like it used to be  
Im leaving you this warning  
Youre gonna live to see the day  
You long for me  
  
Come to your window  
It aint too late to come  
Into your side again  
Dont make me believe you  
Before you let me have  
A chance to try again  
Or Ill be gone before  
You ever know youre losing me  
  
I know Ive made mistakes  
That bought you sorrow  
But baby keep in mind  
Youre not right all the time  
Dont let me go away  
To face a new tomorrow  
Back where you bought me from  
When I was glad to come  
  
Chorus  
Come to your window  
Look down and see the teardrops  
In my desperate eyes  
Look how I need you  
I got to find a way to make you realize  
That you are casting out  
The deepest love youll ever know  
  
Please dont close your ears  
To what Im saying  
Before I ride away into the early day  
I spent the lonesome evening hours praying  
That you will change your mind  
And try me one more time  
  
Come to your window  
Before our love comes crashing  
Into pieces on the ground  
Dont let it happen  
I promise you this time  
Ill never let you down  
Give me a cause to come  
To your lonesome arms again  
  
Chorus
