Miss Tipsy Dazy youre topsy turvy  
Say one minute everything seem fine  
Tipsy Dazy youre topsy turvy  
The next minute were in a puss and dog fight  
Thats not really right  
  
Seems as the day grow old  
Our love grow cold  
Remember you been told  
Love cant be bought nor sold  
  
Tipsy Dazy youre topsy turvy  
Say one minute everythings just right dynamite  
Tipsy Dazy youre topsy turvy  
Next minute were in this great big fight  
That aint my style of life  
  
When everything seem secure  
I cant just be too sure  
Cause you can wake up one day  
Not in love any more  
Hey Remember youve been told  
Love cant be bought nor sold  
Seems as the days grow old  
Our love grow cold

One minute everything seem right  
Tipsy Dazy youre topsy turvy  
Next minute were in this great big fight

Our heat grow cold
