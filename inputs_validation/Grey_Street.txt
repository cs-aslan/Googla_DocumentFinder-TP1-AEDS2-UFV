Oh just sitting while she listens  
She says I dont need this place  
It seems a million years shes stuck here  
But says nothing of what she thinks  
  
She thinks hey  
How did I come to this  
I dreamt like anybody else one night  
I would be a beautiful princess  
  
But then the roads in the park fall  
And then she rode the line in  
And the colors mix together to grey  
And break me out  
  
Oh when Im indifferent  
She prays to God most every night  
Although she swears he doesnttt listen  
Theres hope in her that he just might  
  
She says I pray  
But then my prayer fall on deaf ears  
Im supposed to take it all myself  
To get out of this place  
  
She feels the lumps in the heart fall  
And she rose up in the back  
She hears the cars scream out from outside  
And she whispers sometimes about this  
But the colors mix together to grey  
And wake me up  
  
Oh he grows up living  
He says take what you can from your dreams  
Make them real as anything  
It takes the work out of the courage  
  
She said please  
Theres a crazy man standing outside my door  
I live on the corner of a dead end street  
At the end of the world  
  
Oh and the rocks out in the heart fall  
And she dreams her way to life  
And she knows no one will lift her  
So she might as well do it herself  
  
And then bummed out and worried  
Of leaving city life  
But all the colors mix together to grey  
On grey street  
On grey street  
To grey street  
  
Oh when it comes down in your loving  
Oh well then baby its right  
You say you think you are nothing  
No one else will do it for you  
Reach up and grab hold of the sunlight  
When you are waiting for whats right  
Youre holding on your heaven  
Wont leave you yeah yeah  
  
And the colors mix together to grey  
Wake me up wake me up wake me up  
To grey
