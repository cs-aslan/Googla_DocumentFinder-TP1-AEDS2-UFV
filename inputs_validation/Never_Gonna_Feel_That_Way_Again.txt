Friday night butterflies  
Like clockwork theyd arrive  
A little chill and the October sky  
Nervous till the kickoff game  
4 quarters win or lose  
Spent Saturdays black and blue  
But it was what I love to do  
And it was more than just a game  
  
It was my life and it was fun  
Another season of my life is done  
Another race Im glad I got to run  
Another chapter of my life its over  
No Im never gonna feel like that again  
Times rushin by me like the wind  
Never be as young as I was then  
No Im never gonna feel like that again  
  
Practice dancin in my garage  
Two left feet and a white corsage  
Daddy let me borrow the dodge  
Said dont bring her home on empty  
Swung by and picked up Cindy Lou  
Took her to the prom for a dance or two  
Then we drove down to the water blue and thats where she kissed me  
  
It was my life and it was fun  
Another season of my life is done  
Another race im glad I got to run  
Another chapter of my life its over  
No im never gonna feel like that again  
Times rushin by me like the wind  
Never be as young as I was then  
No im never gonna feel like that again  
  
I got a call one July day  
Cindy Lou was in that way  
Had a big decision to make  
And I couldnt take it lightly  
At first I thought of leavin town  
But I couldnt let our families down  
Now Im out here throwin this ball around  
With a boy that looks just likes me  
  
Its my life and its sure fun  
Another season of my lifes begun  
Another race Im glad I get to run  
Another chapter of my life Im writin  
No Im never gonna feel like this again  
Times rushin by me like the wind  
Got to grab each moment that I can  
Cuz Im never gonna feel like this again  
No Im never gonna feel like this again  
Nooooooooo Im never gonna feel like this again
