Im leaving today  
Living it  
Leaving it  
To change  
  
Slowly drifting  
Into a peaceful breeze  
Tongue tied and twisted  
Are all my memories  
Celebrating a fantasy come true  
Packing all my bags  
Finally on the move  
  
Im leaving today  
Im living it  
Oh Im leaving it  
To change  
  
As Im driving  
Im captured by the view  
So much beauty  
The road becomes my muse  
The heat is rising  
And my hand surfs through the wind  
Cool calm collected  
Is the child that lies within  
  
See Im leaving today  
Im living it  
Oh Im leaving it  
To change oh yeah  
  
See Im leaving today oh yes Im  
Living it  
Oh Im leaving it  
To change  
  
But somehow I miss it  
I think Ill really miss it  
One day oh  
  
I turn up the radio  
And Im feeling like Ive never felt before  
Turn down the memories of  
Yesteryears and broken dreams I bring  
Finally free ooh  
  
Slowly drifting  
Into a peaceful breeze oh  
Oh  
  
Ooh yeah  
Im leaving today oh yes Im  
Living it oh yeah  
Leaving it to change  
To change oh no  
  
See Im leaving today oh yes Im  
Living it living it  
Leaving it leaving  
To change  
Oh oh  
  
Im leaving today  
Oh Im living it  
Im leaving it to change  
Living it to change  
Leaving it  
To change  
Ooh oh yeah  
  
Living it leaving it  
Said Im living it  
Im leaving it  
Living it leaving it  
To change  
Im leaving it to change  
  
But somehow I miss it  
I think Ill really miss it  
One day yeah
