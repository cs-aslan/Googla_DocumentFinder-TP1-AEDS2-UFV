Hushabye my baby soft and new  
Ooh her loveliness gypsy dance in the rain  
Hushabye my baby what you do  
Ooh the baby cries the wind shes acallin your name  
Mia  
  
Where you came from you aint alone  
Live and loved from the old jaw bone  
Ahh dont you cry youre home sweet home  
  
Rockabye sweet lady gypsy blue  
Ooh the nightingales singin her song in the rain  
Hushabye sweet lady soft and new  
Ooh dont you cry the wind shes ascreamin your name  
  
Come too soon that sunny day  
You give your heart away  
No divorcee no repouise
