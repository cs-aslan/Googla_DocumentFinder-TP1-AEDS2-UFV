The tables are empty  
The dance floors deserted  
You play the same love song  
Its the tenth time youve heard it  
And thats the beginning  
Just one of those clues  
Youve had your first lesson  
In learning the blues  
  
The cigarettes you light  
One after another  
Wont help you forget her  
Or the way that you love her  
Youre only burning  
A torch you cant lose  
But youre on the right track  
For learning the blues  
  
When youre at home alone  
The blues will haunt you constantly  
When youre out in a crowd  
The blues will haunt your memory  
The nights when you dont sleep  
The whole night youre crying  
But you cant forget her  
Soon youll stop trying  
Youll walk the floor  
And wear out your shoes  
When youre feeling your heart break  
Youre learning the blues
