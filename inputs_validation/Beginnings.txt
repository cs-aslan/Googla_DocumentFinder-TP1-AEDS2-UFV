When Im with you  
It doesnt matter where we are  
Or what were doing  
Im with you thats all that matters  
  
Time passes much too quickly  
When were together laughing  
I wish I could sing it to you whoaoh  
Wish I could sing it to you  
  
Woah  
Woah  
Mostly Im silent  
Silent  
Try and think of the right words to say  
  
When I kiss you  
I feel a thousand different feelings  
A pletora of chills  
All over my body  
And when I feel them  
I quickly try to decide which one  
I should try to put into words woahoh  
Try to put into words  
Woah  
Woah  
Mostly Im silent  
Silent  
Lalalalalalalalalalala  
Silent  
  
Only the beginning  
Of what I want to feel forever  
Yes only the beginning  
Only just the start  
Ive got to get you into my life mama  
Got to get you next to me  
Yes only the beginning  
Only just the start  
Heyheyheyheyheyheyhey  
Oh all right
