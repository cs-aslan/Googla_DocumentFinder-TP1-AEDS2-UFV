Listen big boy  
Now that you got me made  
Goodness but Im afraid  
Somethins gonna happen to you  
Listen big boy  
You gotta be hooked and how  
I would die if I should lose you now  
Button up your overcoat  
When the wind is free  
Take good care of yourself  
You belong to me  
Eat an apple every day  
Get to bed by three  
Oh take good care of yourself  
You belong to me  
Be careful crossing streets oohooh  
Cut out sweets oohooh  
Lay off meat oohooh  
Youll get a pain and ruin your tumtum  
Wear your flannel underwear  
When you climb a tree  
Oh take good care of yourself  
You belong to me  
Button up your overcoat  
When the wind is free  
Oh take good care of yourself  
You belong to me  
Boopboopadoop  
When you sass a traffic cop  
Use diplomacy  
Just take good care of yourself  
You belong to me  
Beware of frozen funds oohooh  
Stocks and bonds oohooh  
Dockside thugs oohooh  
Youll get a pain and ruin your bankroll  
Keep the spoon out of your cup  
When youre drinking tea  
Oh take good care of yourself  
You belong to me  
Dont sit on hornets tails oohooh  
Or on nails oohooh  
Or third rails oohooh  
Youll get a pain and ruin your tumtum  
Keep away from bootleg hooch  
When youre on a spree  
You belong to me
