If I show you  
Get to know you  
If I hold you just for today  
Im not gonna wanna let go  
Im not gonna wanna go home  
Tell me you feel the same  
  
Cause Im for real  
Are you for real  
I cant help myself  
Its the way I feel  
When you look me in the eyes like you did last night  
I cant stand to hear you say goodbye  
But it feels so right  
Cause it feels so right just to have you standing by my side  
So dont let me go  
Cause you have my soul  
  
And I just wanted you to know  
I dont wanna look back  
Cause I know that we have  
Something the past could never change  
And Im stuck in the moment  
And my heart is open  
Tell me that you feel the same  
  
Cause Im for real  
Are you for real  
I cant help myself  
Its the way I feel  
When you look me in the eyes like you did last night  
I cant stand to hear you say goodbye  
Well it feels so right  
Cause it feels so right just to have you standing by my side  
So dont let me go  
  
Cause you have my soul  
And I just wanted you to know  
  
Hold Hold me down me down  
Hold Hold me now  
Im safe Im safe  
Im sound sound  
When youre around  
  
Hold Hold me down me down  
Hold Hold me now  
Im safe Im safe  
Im sound sound  
When youre around  
  
Cause Im for real  
Are you for real  
I cant help myself  
Its the way I feel  
When you look me in the eyes like you did last night  
I cant stand to hear you say goodbye  
Well it feels so right  
Cause it feels so right just to have you standing by my side  
So dont let me go  
Cause you have my soul  
And I just wanted you to know

When you look me in the eyes like you did last night  
I cant stand to hear you say goodbye  
Well it feels so right  
Cause it feels so right just to have you standing by my side  
So dont let me go  
Cause you have my soul  
And I just wanted you to know
