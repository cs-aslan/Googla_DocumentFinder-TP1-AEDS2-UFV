Hello Im the aircrash bureau  
I bet youre so surprised to see me  
I could specialize in rumours  
Ill send shivers up your spine  
  
Pilot back I need my squadron  
I was flying before dday  
Now Im warning you of falling  
Ill tell you when youre going down  
  
Sometimes I get these questions  
It reminds me of the skin game  
We used to stand around on corners  
Saying well here we are again  
  
So now she motions closer  
Now thats what I call romance  
Someones calling me but vaguely  
You need the feeling not the man
