We on a brand new page Uh  
Millennium days  
Desperation on the streets gotta find a new way  
Keep the mics and choke holds  
The saga unfolds  
Machavellian approaches executed by the coach  
Im in these streets like a ghost  
The airjettin artist  
To the love I hit em right plus I hit the hardest man  
I got a whole new approach for the rhymin  
You cherry cats slide Im holdin out for the Heisman  
You play the rappin roll  
I take the rap and sold  
And intertwine it wit mine and turn a half to whole  
Im just a genie in a jack bottle  
Them fake ballin ass cats is just a wack model  
This joint knocks wit the force of a gat throttle  
I live by you put it out we get it back motto  
Hey but who around but just your average reproduction love  
Rap is gettin lose so all the ice is screamin thug  
What the hell is wrong  
Im askin in this song  
One time I smoked hash out of the hippies bong  
One of us is goin laid cause I aint gettin played  
I leave you right inside that shittyass bed you made  
And walk along chuggin ballers brains rockin rings  
And things and just waitin for white rains  
I got the drive dog  
I hope the dogs ready  
My mentality on dime chicks is stay sweaty  
  
Chorus  
Wait up your wait up wait up  
Get your Its the ummah for all time wait up  
Wait up your wait up wait up  
Get your The ummah forever wait up  
Wait up your wait up wait up  
Get your Get your wait wait up  
Wait up your wait up wait up  
Get your Up up up up yo wait up  
  
You wanna shoot dice or wanna shoot rounds  
Wanna sell rhymes or wanna sell pounds  
The decision is yours Id rather see tours  
Get chicks wit ghetto shit fallin out they drawers  
My team stay posted they stay roasted  
Niggas who all in it had a hard knock livin  
Administra rhyme minista illa treasura  
You didnt know that your man was a legend huh  
Embonishment for the both of you  
I hit the road and I take my whole fuckin crew  
Cause Im a queens cat True to the gs cat True  
Gettin money for more than one needs cat Aight cmon  
Condition never peers and Take it home kid mind stands out  
From Seattle to South Beach my joint Grand Clout  
Its the street commentator providin you wit data  
On how to live unique and its really not neat we gotta  
  
Chorus  
  
And all the fellas go yeah yeah yeah  
And all my ladies go uh uh uh  
And all the fellas go yeah yeah yeah  
And all the ladies go uh uh uh  
Fellas go where you at  
Ladies go yo come back  
Fellas go ladies go  
Fellas go ladies yo  
  
A mellow disposition even when its pain  
Your mental ammunition is faulty wit a drain  
I puts it down lord fuck a mic cord  
Brothers out of his game so we can see tours  
The innovator your man still a hater  
The abstract imprint it stays like a smint  
I got the masses cold wigglin and shakin they ass  
Ma you betta get involved and do it real fast
