Im going to sing my song  
And sing it all day long  
A song that never ends  
How can I tell you all the things inside my head  
  
The change in these past years  
Has made me see our world  
In many different ways  
How can I tell you love can change our destiny  
  
Love can change the world  
Love can change your life  
Do what makes you happy  
Do what you know is right  
And love with all your might  
Before its too late  
  
Where did I find all these words  
Something inside of me is burning  
Theres life in other worlds  
Maybe theyll come to earth  
Helping man to find a way  
  
One day I hope well be in perfect harmony  
A planet with one mind  
Then I could tell you  
All the things inside my head  
  
Im going to sing my song  
And sing it all day long  
A song that never ends  
How can I tell you all the things inside my head  
  
Im going to sing my song  
A song that never ends
