Everyones got their breaking point  
With me its spiders and with you its me  
Thugs in perpetuity  
When were excited little birds around the feeder  
The cats indifferent or hes just furious  
It seems that hes never neither  
I do the rolling you do the detail  
I do the rolling you do the detail  
  
Hair bird plucks a hair from a sleeping dog  
To build her nest she said Ive looked around  
And I like your hair the best  
I do the rolling you do the detail  
I do the rolling you do the detail  
  
Ruby honey are you mad at your man
