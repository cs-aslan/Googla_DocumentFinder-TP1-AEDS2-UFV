Its darker than the dark bottom  
Rumbles more than the Rumba  
If you think that the two steps got em  
  
Just take a look at this number  
Its got that certain swing  
That makes you wanna sing  
  
Dont go left but be polite  
Move to the right  
Doing the reactionary  
  
Close your eyes to where youre bound  
And youll be found  
Doing the reactionary  
  
All the best dictators do it  
Millionaires keep steppin to it  
The four hundred love to sing it  
Ford and Morgan swing it  
  
Hand up high and shake your head  
Youll soon see red  
Doing the reactionary  
  
Dont go left but be polite  
Move to the right  
Doing the reactionary  
  
Close your eyes to where youre bound  
And youll be found  
Doing the reactionary  
  
All the best dictators do it  
Millionaires keep steppin to it  
The four hundred love to sing it  
Ford and Morgan swing it  
  
Hand up high and shake your head  
Youll soon see red  
Doing the reac  
Doing the reactionary  
  
So get in it begin it  
Its smart oh so very  
To do the reactionary
