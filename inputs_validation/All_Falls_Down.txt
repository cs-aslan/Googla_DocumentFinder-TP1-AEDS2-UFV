She built a bridge out of her own insecurities  
No one was brave enough to cross except for me  
Here I am  
She built a castle from the pieces she took from me  
Im going crazy I think she brought all the worst in me  
Here I am Yeah  
  
Guess the price was the fall if I get up  
Cause the strong will survive that dont give up  
Where she fell in love her heart is resting down  
Six feet underground  
  
Oooh she feel stupid loving me for me Yeah  
And Im the fool who falls to easily  
We all fall down sometimes  
We all fall down sometimes  
So why cant I hey  
So why cant I hey  
  
You gotta go I know the time waits for no man  
Dont say your words unspoken girl I overstand  
Here I am  
Why do we meet Some questions dont have an answer  
Two out of three made me a believer  
Here I am  
  
Guess the price was the fall if I get up  
Cause the strong will survive that dont give up  
Where she fell in love her heart is resting down  
Six feet underground  
  
Oooh she feel stupid loving me for me Yeah  
And Im the fool who falls to easily  
We all fall down sometimes  
Girl we all fall down sometimes  
So why cant I hey  
So why cant I hey
