Youve got it I want it My little troubleshooter  
I need it you feed it My hunger drives me to ya  
You bring me round with your velvet hands  
Youre gettin new life to me  
You put me back to promised land  
Just where you know I should be  
  
You can take me  
You can shake me  
You can break me down  
  
Youre givin Im gettin Im gettin satisfaction  
Youre makin Im takin I want some heavy action  
Youre bendin and Im mendin  
Gettin back together  
You really got what it takes  
To make a bad man better  
  
You can take me  
You can shake me  
You can break me down
