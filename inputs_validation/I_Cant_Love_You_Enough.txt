I Cant Love You Enough  
Id crawl through the desert on my hands and knees without a drink of water  
Just for a chance of a little romance with that coal miners daughter  
Yeah if I was a poor girl beggin in the street livin crumb to crumb  
Id turn down a 12pound tbone steak for a bumbumbum  
Love is all we feel  
Spinnin like a wheel  
We let it roll  
Roll I love you so  
When you walk that walk and you talk that talk  
I cant love you enough I cant love you enough  
Youve got a way of making me say  
I cant love you enough I cant love you enough  
Im never gonna give you up  
I cant love you enough  
Hey Conway youre my Mississippi man  
Youre really gettin to me fast  
Every time we kiss it burns so deep  
It just lasts and lasts and lasts  
Loretta my love for you is strong  
I wouldnt sell it for a million dollars  
I know I belong here singin this song  
With that girl from Butcher Hollow
