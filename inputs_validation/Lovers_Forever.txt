Imagine a life without death or disease  
The kind of power to bring a rich man to his knees  
  
I offer you this  
But it comes with a price  
A moments pain for such a trifle sacrifice  
  
I can show you worlds no human eyes have seen  
I can show you worlds beyond all reasoning  
  
Surrender to me now  
And well be lovers for all time  
Angels and sublime  
Well be lovers forever  
  
Well live just like gods  
Reaching every desire  
Well savor ecstasy with every kiss of fire  
  
I offer you more  
Than mere words can express  
And many mortals who have drained their souls for less  
  
With one gesture I can set your spirit free  
With one gesture youll be mine eternally  
  
Surrender to me now  
And well be lovers for all time  
Angels and sublime  
Well be lovers forever  
  
Surrender to me now  
And well be lovers for all time  
Angels and sublime  
Well be lovers forever  
  
Surrender to me now  
  
Surrender to me now
