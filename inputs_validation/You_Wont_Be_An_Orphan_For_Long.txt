Grace  
  
If he should need the F B I  
Then he will have the F B I  
  
All  
  
With all the favors that hes done  
J Edger Hoover owes him one  
  
Cecille and annette  
  
Till not a stone is left unturned  
  
All  
  
He will search everywhere  
And hell find them I swear  
  
Grace  
  
Oh you wont be an orphan for long  
  
All  
  
Where other men would call it quits  
And disappear  
Hell use his fortune and his wits  
So never fear  
Cross the street  
Or cross the sea  
Annie sweet  
We guarantee  
That you wont be an orphan  
  
Grace and the servants  
  
Tomorrow morning it begins  
Youre with a man who always wins  
Trust him and hell prove  
Mountains easily move  
Oh you wont be an orphan   
No you wont be an orphan for long
