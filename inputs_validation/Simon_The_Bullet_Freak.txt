Freed of empty faces  
Give me your money  
Make my life sunny for a day  
Road that leads to nowhere  
Please stop your crying  
I aint fit for dying this way  
Go steal another with your eye  
Go try some other heartless lie  
Land of hopeless speaking  
Bringing back the moon  
Dont play your silly games with me  
Oh war of wasted daydream  
What is your need  
Im gonna bleed until you kill me  
Youve lost all sight of your direction  
Youre only looking for the next one  
The next one to kill  
Ashes of destruction  
Spread out so far  
Blackened others crying over me  
See a one time city  
Now just a scar  
Tears of the flower man  
Fill the sea  
Give me a chance to fly away  
Theres nothing here for me today  
Today  
Simon the bullet freak
