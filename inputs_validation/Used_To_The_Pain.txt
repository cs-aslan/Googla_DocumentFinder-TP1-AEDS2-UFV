And so I wrote this song for you  
I think I know just what youre going through  
Did you believe youd never change  
Nothin ever stays the same  
  
I know its hard holdin on  
Even harder trying to let it go  
And so youre frozen like a stone  
But you are not alone  
  
Chorus  
Every step I take  
I get a little less afraid  
Of giving in to love love  
Let it out  
Believe me when I say  
It gets better every day  
Once you get used to the pain  
  
What you hide inside I see  
Theres a scar thats always gonna be  
Theres a past in everyone  
You cant undo  
You cant outrun  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Once you get used to the pain
