Years they will come and go  
Sometimes the tears will flow  
Some of my memories will fade  
But Ill always remember that one September day  
I used to reminisce  
Cause I thought that love was bliss  
How did they know it would go astray  
It began and it ended on one September day  
We met by chance  
As people often do  
But it blossomed yes it blossomed  
Into something I never knew  
Now It is in the past  
They said it would never last  
Ill not forget the moment back  
Nor hot May or December  
Nor June or November  
But one September day
