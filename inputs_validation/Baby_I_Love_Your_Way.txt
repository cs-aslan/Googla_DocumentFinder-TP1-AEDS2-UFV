Shadows grow so long before my eyes  
And theyre moving across the page  
Suddenly the day turns into night  
Far away from the city  
Well dont hesitate cause your love wont wait  
  
Ooo baby I love your way everyday  
Gonna tell you I love your way everyday  
Wanna be with you night and day  
Moon appears to shine and light the skies  
With the help of some firefly  
Wonder how they have the power to shine  
I can see them under the pine  
But dont hesitate cause your love wont wait  
  
Ooo baby I love your way everyday  
Gonna tell you I love your way everyday  
Wanna be with you night and day  
  
Solo  on verse but dont hesitate cause your love wont wait  
I can see the sunset in your eyes  
Brown and grey blue besides  
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun  
Wish I could buy one out of season  
But dont hesitate cause your love wont wait  
  
Ooo baby I love your way everyday  
Gonna tell you I love your way everyday  
Wanna be with you night and day
