Its late at night Im all alone  
I call you up hear your voice on the phone  
Say that youre mine tell me its true  
Say that my love is still right for you  
  
Cause I cant fall asleep to a lullaby  
And I miss you so much I dont wanna cry you are why  
I love you oooooo you dont know  
  
Here I am part of the crowd  
Need you so bad Im dreamin out loud  
Say that youre mine tell me its true  
Say that my love is still right for you  
  
Cause I cant fall asleep to a lullaby  
And I miss you so much I dont wanna cry you are why  
I love you oooooo you dont know  
  
Its late at night and Im all alone  
So I call you up to hear your voice on the phone  
Sayin your mine sayin its true  
Please say my love is still right for you  
  
Cause I cant fall asleep to a lullaby  
And I miss you so much I dont wanna cry you are why  
I love you oooooo you dont know
