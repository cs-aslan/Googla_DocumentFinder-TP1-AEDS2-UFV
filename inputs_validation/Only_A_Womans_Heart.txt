My heart is low my heart is so low  
As only a womans heart can be  
As only a womans as only a womans  
As only a womans heart can know  
The tears that drip from my bewildered eyes  
Taste of bittersweet romance  
Youre still in my hopes youre still on my mind  
And even though I manage on my own  
My heart is low my heart is so low  
As only a womans heart can be  
As only a womans as only a womans  
As only a womans heart can know  
When restless eyes reveal my troubled soul  
And memories flood my weary heart  
I mourn for my dreams I mourn for my wasted love  
And while I know that Ill survive all alone  
My heart is low my heart is so low  
As only a womans heart can be  
As only a womans as only a womans  
As only a womans heart can know  
My heart is low yes my heart is so low  
As only a womans heart can be  
As only a womans as only a womans  
As only a womans heart can know  
My heart is low my heart is so low  
As only a womans heart can be  
As only a womans as only a womans  
As only a womans heart can know
