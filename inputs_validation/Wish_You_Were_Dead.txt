He got retribution  
He got loaded guns  
Uses silver bullets in the chamber  
And shoots them just for fun  
  
He got the solution  
Got long lasting pride  
He got silver lining in his pocket  
And a bag full of alibis  
  
Hey baby shine the light on me  
As I shoot across the sky  
Hey baby Im your Superman  
And somebody gonna die  
  
Got me spinning in circles  
Got me towing the line  
Got me into the mess Im in  
But the speed has made me blind  
  
Got me spinning in circles  
Hanging by a thread  
If I had one wish to use I swear it  
I wish you were dead  
  
Its a shallow constitution  
Its only homicide  
You only get what you make it to be  
But your request is denied  
  
Sweet electrocution  
Sweeter than the bride  
Put an X on the hollow eyes  
So we all know that theyve died  
  
Hey baby shine the light on me  
As I shoot across the sky  
Its all up to Batman  
And somebodys gonna die dont ask why  
  
We got our retribution  
Got the final done  
We got the spark we hit the mark  
And the killings just begun  
  
Sweet electrocution  
Sweeter by your side  
Let it go let it fly to the sky  
And we die  
  
Here we go again x2  
  
Got me spinning in circles  
Got me towing the line  
Got me into the mess Im in  
But the speed has made me blind  
  
Got me spinning in circles  
Hanging by a thread  
If I had one wish to use I swear it  
I wish you were dead  
  
Wish you were dead
