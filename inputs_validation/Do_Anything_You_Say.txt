Two by two they go walking by  
Hand in hand they watch me cry  
two by two hand in hand  
Lonely nights I dream youre there  
Morning sun and youre gone  
lonely nights morning sun  
maybe Ill do anything you say  
maybe Ill do anything you say  
maybe Ill do anything you say  
Do anything you say do anything  
One desire I ask of you  
Please be mine please be mine  
one desire please be mine  
Thousand years and Ill return  
Youll be mine youll be mine  
thousand years youll be mine  
maybe Ill do anything you say  
maybe Ill do anything you say  
maybe Ill do anything you say  
Do anything you say do anything  
Two by two theyre walking by  
Hand in hand they watch me cry  
two by two hand in hand  
maybe Ill do anything you say  
maybe Ill do anything you say  
maybe Ill do anything you say  
Do anything you say do anything  
maybe Ill do anything you say  
maybe Ill do anything you say  
maybe Ill do anything you say  
Do anything you say do anything you say
