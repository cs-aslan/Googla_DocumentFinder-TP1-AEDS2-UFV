Every night I say a prayer in the hope that theres a heaven  
And every day Im more confused as the saints turn into sinners  
All the heroes and legends I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay  
And I feel this empty place inside so afraid that Ive lost my faith  
  
Show me the way show me the way  
Take me tonight to the river  
And wash my illusions away  
Show me the way  
  
And as I slowly drift to sleep for a moment dreams are sacred  
I close my eyes and know theres peace in a world so filled with hatred  
That I wake up each morning and turn on the news to find weve so far to go  
And I keep on hoping for a sign so afraid that I just wont know  
  
Show me the way Show me the way  
Take me tonight to the mountain  
And take my confusion away  
  
And if I feel light should I believe  
Tell me how will I know  
  
Show me the way show me the way  
Take me tonight to the river  
And wash my illusions away  
Show me the way show me the way  
Give me the strength and the courage  
To believe that Ill get there someday  
Show me the way  
  
Every night I say a prayer  
In the hope that theres a heaven
