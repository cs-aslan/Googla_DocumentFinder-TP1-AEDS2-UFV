See the writings on the wall  
If you can read  
Theres a black list  
Got one name and its me  
Yea I got no invitation  
But I wont leave  
Gonna keep on fighting  
For everything thats me  
  
Its my life  
Im living free  
Aint nobody nowhere  
Got no chains on me

Keep on fighting for the things I believe
