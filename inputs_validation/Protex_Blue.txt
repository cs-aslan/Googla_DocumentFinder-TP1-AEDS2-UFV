Standing in the bog of a west end bar  
Guy on the right leaning over too far  
Money in my pocket gonna put it in the slot  
Open up the pack see what type I got  
  
I didnt want to hold you  
I didnt want to use you  
Protex protex blue  
All want to do  
  
Its a fab protective for that type of a girl  
But everybody knows that she uses it well  
Its the therapeutic structure I can use at will  
But I dont think it fits my bd drill  
  
Sitting in a carriage of a bakerloo  
Erotica my pocket got a packet for you  
Advert on the escalator on my way home  
I dont need no skin flicks I want to be alone  
  
I didnt want to hold you  
I didnt want to use you  
Protex protex blue  
All I want to do
