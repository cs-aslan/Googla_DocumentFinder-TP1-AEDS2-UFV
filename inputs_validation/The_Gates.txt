Woman goes to heaven its not important when  
Cause as soon as she arrives God has to send her down again  
Youve got an extra five years to clean up after men  
I mean no disrespect God but you better make it ten  
  
Well if heavens an improvement I wont mind the extra squeeze  
Ive got a few more birds down there after losing bees  
Trying to lose their bees  
  
So dont be shocked who queuejumps  
Or who just calmly waits  
A certain type of behavior  
The guest list just creates  
  
No time for lively discussion  
No time for televised debates  
The wellmeaning soon become well meant  
Its the hard sell or hell at the gates the gates  
  
Alcoholic finds himself outside the pearly gates  
Ive only got one worry God a few outstanding slates  
Any tab you used to have been passed to so called mates  
And after theyve paidup theyre off to the land of empty crates  
  
Heaven is a glass neither half empty nor half full  
So do us all a favor God and give that thing a pull  
Give that thing a pull  
  
So dont be shocked who queuejumps  
Or who just calmly waits  
A certain type of behavior  
The guest list just creates  
  
No time for lively discussion  
No time for televised debates  
The wellmeaning soon become the well meant  
Its the hard sell or hell at the gates the gates  
  
Model turns up hours late he had to get it right  
If youre gonna look cool in heaven wear something more than white  
Vanitys close to arrogance just slightly more polite  
Fashion show a jumble sale at a slightly different height  
At a slightly different height  
  
So dont be shocked who queuejumps  
Or who just calmly waits  
A certain type of behavior  
The guest list just creates  
  
No time for lively discussion  
No time for televised debates  
The wellmeaning soon become the well meant  
Its the hard sell or hell at the gates the gates  
The gates the gates
