I dont care  
Theyre crazy  
Said pass the jam would you  
Awfully kind of you  
Now wouldnt it be a little bit nice to sing with this  
  
Gazing at the open door  
Just what lays behind  
Thinking what Im looking for  
Say whats on my mind  
  
Sinking ever deeper  
In the words of guilt of shame  
And now I can redeem myself  
I just dont care  
  
The words Im singing theyre just right  
Thats better for my brain  
If I try to make much sense  
You know Ill go insane  
  
I just dont care  
I just dont care  
  
Stay and have some jam with tea  
But Brutus wasnt kind  
Wasnt strawberries that were red  
He wasnt cutting bread  
  
You pass the jam  
And so he slammed the tea  
 here to me  
Was in the conservatory  
  
Yeah alright  
Yes but still over there  
Sinking ever deeper  
In the words of guilt and shame  
I can redeem myself  
I just dont care  
  
Staring at the silver spoon  
Take it from your mouth  
Take it from the chapter  
Turn and face the south  
  
Now face the north  
And the east  
And the west  
And the serpent song  
  
Still burning on in the night  
Wheres the sun at midnight  
Say its gone  
  
Wheres the moon at dawn  
It carries on and on  
It never ends  
  
To the land of nevermore  
Where time began  
Where the man still stands  
  
And the  x  at the end  
Never know that I sang  
Youll all know its the right place  
In time well it is  
  
The words Im singing  
Thats just right  
Theyre better for my brain  
If I try to make much sense  
You know Ill go insane
