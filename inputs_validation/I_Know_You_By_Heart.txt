Everybody wants to find a love  
Somebody somebody who will always care  
We get locked up in our own worlds  
With feelings and secrets were afraid to share  
But all I have to do is see you smile  
And maybe just maybe if I brush your hand  
Something happens I cannot explain  
And somehow oh somehow I can understand  
I I think youre gonna find  
Gonna find you gonna find you  
Im reading your mind  
I know you by heart  
And youre so much a part of me  
I know you by heart yes I do  
Its no wonder I can love you the way that I do  
I can finish any sentence you start  
I know you I know you by heart  
I know every time youre gonna call  
I pick up the phone before it ever rings  
And when you need some lovin  
Ill be there beside you anticipating everything  
Oh its like I always said  
Youre the one I want  
All I want is you  
Im inside your head  
I know you by heart  
Girl youre so much a part of me  
I know you by heart yes I do  
Its no wonder I can love you the way that I do  
I can finish any sentence you start  
I know you I know you by heart  
Its no wonder I can love you the way that I do  
I can finish any sentence you start  
I know you I know you by heart  
I know you by heart  
And youre so much a part of me  
I know you by heart I know you I know you I know you  
Its no wonder I can love you the way that I do  
I can finish any sentence you start  
I know you I know you by
