This goes out to you and you and you  
You know who you are  
  
Hmm hmm hmm  
When glory days turn to stormy nights  
You must have been so petrified  
Didnt you didnt you feel so cold  
You against the world in a losing fight  
Captive of your demons inside  
  
So you sought an enemy  
Im not your enemy He lives in you you know its true  
Like times before to mock ignorantly  
But the Lord said love love your enemy so just  
Take heed to the Word its time  
Check Proverbs 1929  
Dont cry  
  
I wish you well  
I wish you well  
I wish you well  
  
I truly wanted solidarity  
Still wearing my blinders back then  
So much I didnt see  
I weep for what I dreamed we all could be  
Ill keep you in prayer till the end  
  
Still bruised still walk on eggshells  
Same frightened child hide to protect myself  
Cant believe I still need to protect myself from you  
But you cant manipulate me like before  
Examine first John chapter 4 verse 4  
  
And  
I wish you well  
I wish you well  
I wish you well  
  
Be strong in the Lord and power of His might  
  
If my shows of gratitude are minuscule  
Inside your mind sorry  
Im so sorry please forgive me  
Theres only so much I can do I love you and did all that I could  
  
Maybe when youre cursing me  
You dont feel so incomplete  
But weve all made mistakes  
Felt the guilt and selfhate  
  
I know youve been there for me plenty  
Maybe still got love for me  
But let him without sin cast the first stone brethren  
But who remains standing then  
Not you not I see Philippians 49  
Put it into practice and the God of Peace will be with you  
  
So  
I wish you well  
I wish you well  
I wish you well  
  
He who the Son sets free is free indeed  
No weapon formed against me shall prosper  
Surely God is my salvation  
I will trust and not be afraid  
The Lord the Lord is my salvation  
I will trust in Him  
Yes I know that I know that I know that I know  
  
But I have had Gods help to this very day  
And so I stand here and testify  
To small and great alike  
So the more you curse me  
The more youre blessing me  
The Word said it  
Love your enemies  
  
Do good to those who curse you  
Pray for those who mistreat you  
Psalms 1292  
They have greatly oppressed me from my youth  
But they have not gained victory over me  
In Jesus name  
  
I wish you well  
  
He that keeps his mind state on the Lord  
He will keep them in perfect peace
