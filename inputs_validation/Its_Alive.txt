My pockets on swoll my rims all grown  
When I hit the club everything goes  
Bottles in the air put your lighters in the air  
But when Im in here I dont really care  
Cause I ride on em I style on em  
Yea I lean on em yea I flash on em  
Yea I know thats the way you like it huh  
Yea thats the way you love me huh  
  
Its alive its alive rounds kill the eyes  
I had to bring the bitch back like Frankenstein  
I push weight but Gucci dont exercise  
I get extra from whipping up extra pies  
Im in a hood like the mayor round election time  
Heres a suggestion dont park your car next to mine  
Im a star when the light hit Im supposed to shine  
Your flow is garbage they let me out just in time  
They got a section but none of the hoes are fine  
They need to exit dont let the grind past you by  
I run laps round lames with my shoes untied  
I jump the line walk in and watch the crowd divide  
Still stuck outside its the ugly side  
Look Medusa in the eye and Medusa died  
This top secret shit classified  
Dont blame me swizz was the mastermind  
Cant breath cant breath tone tony brush the time  
I keep my chain moon walking Michael Jackson time  
I keep on buying ice like I lost my mind  
This little light of mine is supposed to shine  
  
My pockets on swoll my rims all grown  
When I hit the club everything goes  
Bottles in the air put your lighters in the air  
But when Im in here I dont really care  
Cause I ride on em I style on em  
Yea I lean on em yea I flash on em  
Yea I know thats the way you like it huh  
Yea thats the way you love me huh  
  
Hurry up hurry up Gucci on the news  
They said he walked out the chair rocking stupid jewels  
They tried to find what it do they made that Jew confused  
Too much cash on my hundred falling out my troops  
A yellow wrist bright as piss bitch Im the shit  
Big Gucci called swizz lets make a hit  
Two things in this world I aint never seen  
Are you a foreigner nigga I need to help to get me mean  
I hope you suffocate me totally baby let me breath  
Cause I dont chase nothing but paper bitches chasing me  
Excuse my french Im Gucci Im so fucking gutter  
It dont make no sense to switch for none of these motherfuckers  
  
My pockets on swoll my rims all grown  
When I hit the club everything goes  
Bottles in the air put your lighters in the air  
But when Im in here I dont really care  
Cause I ride on em I style on em  
Yea I lean on em yea I flash on em  
Yea I know thats the way you like it huh  
Yea thats the way you love me huh  
  
So not to say my life is it  
I said no doc my wife is it  
Now Im back back going like I never never left  
Plus the boy right here Im fresh to death whoo  
Chris Jones on my feet see I cant fall from Suzuki jeeps  
Now Im jumping off decks  
The word about the haters they can be upset and  
The black card in my back pocket  
The corner sig is looking like a speeding rocket  
Yeah Im zooming on a highway  
And you should love me I did it my way  
  
My pockets on swoll my rims all grown  
When I hit the club everything goes  
Bottles in the air put your lighters in the air  
But when Im in here I dont really care  
Cause I ride on em I style on em  
Yea I lean on em yea I flash on em  
Yea I know thats the way you like it huh  
Yea thats the way you love me huh
