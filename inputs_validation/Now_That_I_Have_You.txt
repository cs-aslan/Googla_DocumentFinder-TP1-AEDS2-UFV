You found me when I was alone  
You held me and you made my heart your home  
I sit around and dream  
And theres no one else I see  
Cuz theres no one else for me  
I dont feel like crying  
  
I have no tears  
Cuz I have no reason to cry  
Love is on my mind  
And my hearts no longer blue  
Now that I have you  
  
I dont let anyone tell me what to do  
How to love who to love  
They dont know you like I know you  
This is so natural its hard to believe  
People all around me  
And theres no one else I see  
Cuz theres no one else for me  
I dont feel like crying  
  
I have no tears  
Cuz I have no reason to cry  
Love is on my mind  
And my hearts no longer blue  
Now that I have you  
  
I have the world and I have no fears  
And I know where my happiness is  
Now that Ive got you to care  
Now that youve got me forever  
Everything I dont want is gone  
And I know I cant live without your love  
  
All the things I wanted now  
Are starting to be true  
And all the dreams I ever dreamed  
Are coming now that I have you  
Love is on my mind  
And my hearts no longer blue  
Now that I have you  
Oh now that I have you  
Now that I have you
