Some turnout a hundred grand  
Get with it well shake his hand  
Dont bother to understand  
Dont question the little man  
Be part of the brotherhood  
Yes its chain lightning  
It feels so good  
Hush brother we cross the square  
Act natural like you dont care  
Turn slowly and comb your hair  
Dont trouble the midnight air  
Were standing just where he stood  
It was chain lightning  
It feels so good
