Picture yourself on the sea of a setting sun  
The salty air and the taste of your lovers hair  
Inside you want to fly  
Ah yi yi yi yi yi yi  
Come to the magical mist where the oceans kissed  
A thousand kisses or more on the sandy shore  
And never says goodbye  
Ah yi yi yi yi yi yi  
Ooh la costa ooh  
Ooh la costa ooh  
Come feel the warm of the breeze as the swaying trees  
Caress the velvety skies like a whisper telling you to come and fly  
Ah yi yi yi yi yi yi  
Musical interlude  
Run with the wind at your side let it set you free  
Ill watch the sun in your eyes as the seagulls fly  
Along this lovers isle  
Ah yi yi yi yi yi yi  
You are my love and my life youre my everything  
You calm the sea of my soul oh so tenderly  
It makes me very high  
Ah yi yi yi yi yi yi  
Ooh la costa wee ooh wee  
Ooh la costa ooh  
Picture yourself on the sea  
Come feel the warm of the breeze  
La costa
