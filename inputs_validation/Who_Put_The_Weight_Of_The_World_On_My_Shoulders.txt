Who put the weight of the world on my shoulders  
Who put the lies in the truth that you sold us  
  
Lost behind a silver screen  
Are all the things you couldve been to us  
  
So dont try to fuck up my head with your problems  
Im just tryin to fix up my bed in the doldrums  
  
Lost behind a silver screen  
Are all the things you couldve been in Love and Life soooooo  
  
Chorus  
Help me out my friend  
My head just started to hurt  
I dont pretend  
Ive got all of the time in the world  
So now shes gone  
All alone in her own universe  
I still walk on  
Til I hold you within my world  
  
Help me out my friend  
My head just started to hurt  
I wont pretend  
Ive got all of the time in the world  
So now shes gone  
All alone in her own universe  
I still walk on  
Til I hold you within my world  
  
Who put the weight of the world on my shoulders  
Who put the lies in the truth that you sold us
