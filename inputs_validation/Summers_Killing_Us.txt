Does summer exist in its praises  
Does summer exist in its praises  
The summer lives here where this place is  
Come on up here weve got something to show you  
Wanna show you everything we know  
Wanna show you weve been banished before you  
Wanna show you weve got our own roads  
And does your family know your wishes  
Cause this chorus will do you like the dishes  
Summers killin us  
Its just sing sing sing all day  
Its as if summer existed in its praises  
Come on over Ive got somethin to play you  
Back At Sunshine its the Shadow Band  
We can have strictly cactus relations  
Telling the waves to stop crashing  
And does anybody know your wishes  
Cause this tunell do you like the dishes  
This summers killin us  
Its just sing sing sing all day  
Its as if summer just exists in her praises  
A time for more to happen sooner  
A time to be a person you still know  
To float a while on your sure power  
Till you say Canada lost go home  
The summers killin us  
We sing sing sing all day  
And its as if summer exists here in its praises ooh  
Summer exists in a doorway  
Summer exists at the fair  
Summer is forever changes  
Summers taking me all the way
