Im layin awake at night  
I cant get you out of my mind  
All I can hear is my heart beat  
And a voice in the dark of some kind  
  
Where are you now  
The fears are comin back to me once again  
Oh I wish you were here  
Takin good care of me  
I want you  
I feel as though Im out in the cold  
  
Out in the cold  
Hear me calling  
Cold  
Out in the cold  
Please rescue me  
  
I know it was you I hurt  
I didnt mean to hurt you  
So much to forgive and forget  
Cant take anymore of this hurt  
On no Oh no  
Theres so many things I regret  
  
Where are you now  
The fears are comin back to me once again  
Oh I wish you were here  
Takin good care of me  
I want you  
I feel as though Im out in the cold  
  
Shut me out  
Out in the cold  
Where are you now  
Hear me calling  
I need you Im so cold  
Cant you hear my heart beat  
Out in the cold  
Please rescue me  
  
Give me a chance baby  
Theres nothing I wouldnt do to make it alright  
Just for one more chance baby  
I need all your lovin tonight  
  
Where are you now  
The fears are comin back to me once again  
Oh I wish you were here  
Takin good care of me  
I want you  
I feel as though Im out in the cold  
  
Shut me out  
Out in the cold  
Where are you now  
Hear me calling  
I need you Im so cold  
Cant you hear my heart beat  
Out in the cold
