Military show is blastin off to Kosovo  
Military show with lightning speed  
Sensitivity oh just a rusty nail in the corporate show  
How many stabs before we bleed  
  
Those Pinocchios chattering out in stereo  
Boy Pinocchio and his golden deed  
Masculinity oh galvanized in the world wide show  
As we fertilize the seed  
  
Power mad I didnt chop the tree down dad  
I only try to do whats right  
Power man the best friend that you ever had  
Unless of course you choose to fight  
  
Power mad driving out of the shadows  
He never tires when he plays  
Power mad hes a streak in the night time  
Speculating how hell take on the world some day  
  
Originality oh just a rusty nail in a Broadway show  
How many stabs before we succeed  
  
Power mad I didnt drop my pants down dad  
I know my left hand from my right  
Power man the best friend that you ever had  
Unless of course you lose the fight
