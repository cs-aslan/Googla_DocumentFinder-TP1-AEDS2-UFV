Sometimes I think Im gonna better myself  
Searching for acceptance in this big wide world  
Sometimes I think I wont make it  
Playing in a rock n roll band  
Sometimes I want to be a picture director  
And try to make the world understand  
  
By making groovy movies  
By making groovy movies  
By making groovy movies  
  
All the movie makers of the world would be  
Falling over backwards to have dinner with me  
Ill go down to  
Anytime I feel like a game  
  
Or take a long vacation to san tropez  
And think of all the money I made  
  
By making groovy movies  
By making groovy movies  
By making groovy movies  
  
I dont want to be a producer  
I dont want to be a big star  
I just want to be a picture director  
And smoke a big havana cigar  
  
By making groovy movies  
By making groovy movies  
By making groovy movies  
By making groovy movies  
By making groovy movies  
By making groovy movies
