Feel the heat in the street  
Find out what your people are sayin  
  
Feel the heat in the street  
Find out what the people are sayin  
Bout you Yeh you  
  
Friends you keep lie and cheat  
Makin rules for games that theyre playin  
  
When you meet on the street  
You find out all along theyre playin  
Me against you  
  
I dont care what they say about me  
Ive heard that all before  
Just make this one exception  
Give me your affection  
Listen to your heart for what you need  
  
Feel the heat in the street  
Youre the one that keeps the boys dreamin  
  
If you feel the need come to me  
Or you may find whats on your mind  
May come true
