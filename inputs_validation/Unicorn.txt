I got my shadow tonight  
Is like a horse  
An unicorn is dirtying the hope horn 2x  
  
Hes begging me to come with him  
I dont know why  
When Im with this I feel free  
Like a monster that could fly  
  
Through the skies I come in  
Through the skies I feel free baby  
Like an unicorn can blow my horn 2x  
  
Im not sure  
Will he take my head  
Im not sure  
Will he take my brain  
Im not sure to give my to another body  
Well hes innocent I cant blame  
  
Unicorn Unicorn  
Innocent  
In the dark  
Unicorn  
Unicorn  
Be afraid of the souls  
Be far  
  
Im not sure  
Will he take my head  
Im not sure  
Will he take my brain  
Im not sure to give my to another body  
Well hes innocent I cant blame  
  
I got my shadow tonight  
Is like a horse  
An unicorn is dirtying the hope horn 2x
