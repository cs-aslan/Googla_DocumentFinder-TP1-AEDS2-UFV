Every day were gonna rock and roll  
Rock and roll rock and roll  
Every day were gonna rock and roll gonna  
Rock out a little bit of soul  
  
Every day were gonna go go go  
Gonna kick off the shoes and dance on the floor  
Every day were gonna go go go gonna  
Go go a little bit of soul  
  
Every day were gonna twist and shout  
Hold back baby come on work out  
Every day were gonna twist and shout gonna  
Twist and shout a little soul  
  
Every day were gonna shake shake shake  
Come on Grandpa you aint got no back ache  
Every day were gonna shake shake shake gonna  
Shake a little bit of soul  
  
Every day were gonna turn it on  
Gonna turn it on gonna turn it on  
Every day were gonna turn it on gonna  
Turn on a little bit of soul  
  
Every day were gonna rock and roll  
Round the clock rock and roll  
Every day were gonna rock and roll gonna  
Rock out a little bit of soul
