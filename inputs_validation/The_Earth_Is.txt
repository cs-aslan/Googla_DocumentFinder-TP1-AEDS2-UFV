Theres a man with the smallest of worlds in his hands  
And a tear fills his eyes as he tries to hold on  
Holding his world together  
  
Theres a girl in the other half of the sky  
And shes wondering why her planet should sigh  
Dont you want me round forever  
  
The earth is too small to be divided  
Sunrise moonfall deep in the heart  
A part of everyone  
  
And we cant wait anymore the time has come  
And those who need something more will feel the sun  
Were sharing one  
  
The earth is too small to be divided  
Sunrise moonfall deep in the heart  
A part of everyone  
  
And we cant wait anymore the time is now  
Youve got your foot in the door  
Get through somehow break through somehow  
  
The earth is too small to be divided  
Sunrise moonfall deep in the heart  
A part of everyone
