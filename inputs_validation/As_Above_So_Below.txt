Theres a hole in the sky Because I dont know but dont ask me why There is
a long way to go Where the road is leading me Future will show I will never
die Cause I will fly To the other side For what is right They do what they
want Im trying to fight But evil spirits pass me by What you feel or what you
say They just dont care I will never die Cause I will fly To the other side
Because I dont know but dont ask me why Theres a hole in the sky There is a
long way to go Future will show Where the road is leading me I will never die
Cause I will fly To the other side
