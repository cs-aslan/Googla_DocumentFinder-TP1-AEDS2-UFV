Get away from me  
Get away from me  
This isnt gonna be easy  
But I dont need you believe me  
Yeah you got a piece of me  
But its just a little piece of me  
I dont need anyone these days  
I feel like Im fading away  
Like sometimes when I hear myself on the radio  
  
Have you seen me lately  
Have you seen me lately  
Have you seen me lately  
  
I was out on the radio  
Starting to change somewhere out in America  
Its raining  
Could you tell me one thing you remember about me  
Remember about me  
  
I remember me  
All the little things that make up a memory  
She said she loved to watch me sleep  
She says Its the breathing  
Its the breathing in and out and in and out  
  
Have you seen me lately  
Have you seen me lately  
Have you seen me lately  
  
I was out on the radio  
Starting to change somewhere out in America  
Its raining  
Could you tell me one thing you remember about me  
Remember about me  
Remember about me  
  
You know I thought someone would notice  
I thought somebody would say something if I was missing  
Well cant you see me  
Come on color me in  
Come on color me in  
Come on Come on Come on  
Give me a blue rain  
Give me a black sky  
Give me your green eyes  
Just give me your white skin  
Give me your white skin  
Give me your white skin  
  
I was out on the radio  
Starting to change somewhere out in America  
Its raining  
Could you tell me one thing you remember about me  
Just one thing you Remember about me  
Just one thing you Remember about me  
One thing you remember about me  
Remember about me
