I had to make you mine  
Ive wasted all this time  
You know that Im so glad  
Just to have your love  
  
Im telling all the world  
That youre my little girl  
You know I must be mad  
Just to have your love  
  
When I dream of you  
All my dreams come true  
You are my night my day  
Im lost when youre away  
Can you hear my heart  
Its calling you its calling you  
Oh girl oh little girl  
  
I had to make you mine  
Ive wasted all this time  
You know that Im so glad  
Just to have your love  
  
Im telling all the world  
That youre my little girl  
You know I must be mad  
Just to have your love  
  
I thought youd like to know  
Youve heard this all before  
So even if Im wrong  
Im right where I belong  
Cant you hear my heart  
Its calling you its calling you  
Oh girl oh little girl  
  
I had to make you mine  
Ive wasted all this time  
You know that Im so glad  
Just to have your love  
  
I had to tell the world  
That youre my little girl  
You know I must be mad  
Just to have your love  
  
I had to make you mine  
Ive wasted all this time  
You know that Im so glad  
Just to have your love  
  
I had to make you mine  
I had to make you mine
