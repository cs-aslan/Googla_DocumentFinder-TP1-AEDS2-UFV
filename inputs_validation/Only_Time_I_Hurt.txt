Now I know that Ill forget you cause I forgot you a while ago  
And when I thought of you just now only one tear drip down slow  
My mind is hard and twisted so and it hardly ever sleeks  
But the only time Ive hurt is when my heart beats  
Since Im finally gettin over you I think Ill celebrate  
Think of breakin all your pictures and I might throw one away  
And I wont feel this awful pain in about ten million weeks  
Cause the only time I hurt is when my heart beats  
The only time I hurt is when my heart beats  
I live in constant misry cause the hurtin just repeats  
I think about you now and then and everytime your memry speaks  
But the only time I hurt is when my heart beats  
 steel   
The only time I hurt
