Well I kept fantasizing your eyes were wide open  
and it made me long for little last night  
Yes it was frantic it was young it was sweet  
But a sweet worth every bite  
  
Now Im not normally one to be greedy  
But I had to be greedy with you  
5 days 6 days the whole of the month  
wouldnt satisfy my only sweet tooth  
  
chorus  
Well it can take many years to forge a friendship  
It can take a lifetime to get close  
But we took all the shortcuts  
used our hearts as a map  
and we still got closer than most  
  
hey hey  
hey hey hey hey  
hey hey hey hey  
hey hey hey hey  
  
Well excuse my staring but its just your looks  
are a standard well above myself  
Your face might mean zip to you  
But to me its something else  
  
All I can do is thank you  
and wish that every dream you have will come true  
5 years 6 years the whole of your life  
Ill be wishing for the riches for you  
  
chorus  
  
You dashed prettys only chance of a compliment  
and gave the plain the blues  
Turned supermodel into last years pull  
and got her down shining your shoes  
  
And I dont mean to be hod carrier  
of the ordinary folks bad news  
But tell Miss World to fly to Mars  
If she really doesnt like to lose  
  
chorus
