Since it costs a lot to win and even more to lose  
You and me bound to spend some time wondering what to choose  
Goes to show you dont ever know  
Watch each card you play and play it slow  
Wait until that deal come round  
Dont you let that deal go down no no  
  
I been gambling hereabouts for ten good solid years  
If I told you all that went down it would burn off both of your ears  
Goes to show you dont ever know  
Watch each card you play and play it slow  
Wait until that deal come round  
Dont you let that deal go down no no  
  
Since you poured the wine for me and tightened up my shoes  
I hate to leave you sitting there composing lonesome blues  
Goes to show you dont ever know  
Watch each card you play and play it slow  
Wait until that deal come round dont you let that deal go down  
  
Wait until that deal come round dont you let that deal go down  
Wait until that deal come round dont you let that deal go down  
Dont you let that deal go down dont you let that deal go down
