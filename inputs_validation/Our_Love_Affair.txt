Here we are two very bewildered people  
Here we are two babes that are lost in the wood  
Were not quite certain what has happened to us  
This lovely thing thats so marvelous  
But right from here the future looks awfully good  
  
Our love affair was meant to be  
Its me for you dear and you for me  
Well fuss and quarrel  
And tears start to brew  
But after the tears our love will smile through  
  
Im sure that I could never hide  
The thrill I get when youre by my side  
And when were older well proudly declare  
Wasnt ours a lovely love affair  
  
Im sure that I could never hide  
The thrill I get when youre by my side  
And when were older well proudly declare  
Wasnt ours a lovely love affair
