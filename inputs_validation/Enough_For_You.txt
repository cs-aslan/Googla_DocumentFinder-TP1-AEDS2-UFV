Ive lived enough  
To know that loves not everything you need  
God knows I know there are still so many things  
  
You want to be  
Ive seen enough to understand the pain  
Youre goin through  
Its just a shame to know  
Im not enough for you  
It hurts to see the hurt beneath  
Your laughter and your lies  
And try in vain to free the painful secret  
  
Locked behind your eyes  
And I cant even blame you  
For the things youre turning to  
Its just a shame to know  
Im not enough for you  
  
Ive given you the best  
Of everything I had to give  
Now theres nothin left for me to leave you  
But my will to live  
I hope someday  
  
Somebody somewhere loves you  
Like I do  
Its just a shame to know  
Im not enough for you
