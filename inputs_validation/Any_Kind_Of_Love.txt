Well if youre ever in a tight spot  
And all the things around you are gettin hot  
Come to me and I can cool you off  
And if you ever get yourself in a jam  
And if you ever feel you need to find a man  
Call my number and darling you found one  
  
But I know now it can never work out  
The way I really wished that it would  
But a secondhand love is better than no love at all  
  
And the walls get a little closer  
And my throat gets a little tighter when  
I say to you that a secondhand love from you is better than no love at all  
Any kind of love from you is better than no love at all  
  
If you got the feeling it aint right tonight  
And if the fire at home aint as hot as you like  
Ive got a fire thats burning for you  
And if you ever feel you need to get away  
To get away from the rest of your life  
Ill come arunnin and show you the world
