I took a job in the city  
And I left my country home  
I learned to survive and I got streetwise  
But I couldnt tell for how long  
  
Then I met you where they sing the blues  
Downtown a few months ago  
And you taught me its still good to believe in love  
And I love you so  
  
Im makin some major moves  
Oh city girl to get to you  
Im makin some major moves  
Oh darlin major moves just for you  
  
I sold some things and I bought a ring  
And Ive been married before one time  
And this major move just goes to prove  
Like they say love is really blind  
  
Yes Ive made a change  
And there aint no one to blame  
But me if things dont work out right  
  
And they just might work out  
Cause all I think about  
Is that city girl and country boy tonight  
  
Im makin some major moves  
Oh city girl just for you  
Im makin some major moves  
Oh darlin major moves to get to you  
  
Im makin some major moves  
Oh darlin just to get with you  
Im makin some major moves  
Oh baby major moves to get to you  
Major moves all for you
