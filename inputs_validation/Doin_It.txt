Yea check out it baby make it hot  
Bring the drama uh DefJam ha yea word em up make em bounce  
  
Its the first time together and Im feelin kind of horny  
Conventional methods of makin love kind of bore me  
I want to knock your block off get my rocks off  
Blow your socks off make sure your G spots off  
Ill call ya big daddy and scream your name  
Matter fact I cant wait for your candy rain  
So which you sayin I get my swerve on bring it live  
Make it last forever damn the kitty cat is tied  
Daddy slow down your flow  
Put it on me like a G baby nice and slow  
I need a rough neck mega man dingle in a sec  
Who aint afraid pull my hands and spank me from the back  
No doubt Im the player that youre talking about  
But do you think you could really work it out  
I guarantee ya shorty is real baby stick out here comes the man of steel  
  
Chorus
