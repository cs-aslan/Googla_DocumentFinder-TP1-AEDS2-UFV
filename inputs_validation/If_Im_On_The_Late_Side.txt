If Im late darling dont hesitate  
Just go without me and Ill see you there anyway  
If I miss you at the station  
I want you on that train  
I dont want a sad sack  
Cause Ill be there come what may  
  
Leave a message with the porter  
Or leave it at the gate  
Just let me know that youre aboard her  
Just a word to know that youre safe  
  
I walk from Maryland to Silver town  
I hoped to catch you in the street  
I must have missed you by a moment dear  
I tried the place we always meet  
  
So if Im late darling dont hesitate no no  
Go on your lonesome and Ill catch you there anyway  
I might lose sometime babe  
But if I do Ill make amends in an hour  
When Im laying down beside you
