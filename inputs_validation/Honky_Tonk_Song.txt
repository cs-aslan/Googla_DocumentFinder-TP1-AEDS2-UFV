Got me room in a cheap hotel  
My head was a spinnin and didnt feel well  
I laid right down and tried to go to sleep  
A band kept a playin in the joint underneath  
I picked up my pillow and I covered up my head  
But the band kept a playin and a shaken my bed  
  
Honky tonk all night long  
Honky tonk same old song  
Honky tonk my moneys all gone  
Honky tonk she done me wrong  
  
I turned and I tossed  
And I couldnt go to sleep  
Cause the band kept a playin  
With a honky tonk beat  
  
Im so blue my babys gone she took all my money  
And she left me all alone  
Im tryin to forget her but I dont know what to do  
The honky tonk song keeps a leakin through  
I picked up my pillow and I covered up my head  
But the band kept a playin and a shaken my bed  
  
Honky tonk all night long  
Honky tonk same old song  
Honky tonk my moneys all gone  
Honky tonk she done me wrong  
  
Honky tonk all night long  
Honky tonk same old song  
Honky tonk my moneys all gone  
Honky tonk she done me wrong
