Shes a butterfly  
But she flies too high  
She wont speak the truth  
She dont make excuses  
She dont seem to care  
But you want her anywhere  
cause shes the only one  
She dont make the scene  
But that dont chnge a thing  
You just plan and scheme  
You insist on dreamin  
She wont play your game  
But its all the same  
Now shes the only one  
She knows too well that shes the only one  
She doesnt care if youre the lonely one  
You want to say its over but its just begun  
Shes the only one  
She knows too well that shes the only one  
She doesnt care if youre the lonely one  
Its not the way you planned it  
But shes really got you on the run  
Your one and only one
