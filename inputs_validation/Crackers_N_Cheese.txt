Scratched sample  Im the man  
  
I stand in by the way as I begin  
Do you know who I am and may reply with a grin  
Yes Im tired of being  
Why should I be secluded I got a brand new horn to be tooted  
To sum it up in a nutshell Eminem will you kick it for me  
So I find myself in a certaindepligatory  
A place where I dwell in for some wonderful productions  
To make up for lost time  
Finally let loose unloading the stockpile  
A mental projectile I aim like a reptile  
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this  
Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus  
Is there a reason for this the hatred is aggravating  
How many times will it take you before you realize youre fading  
Fading from existence cause simulations are dead  
Theres so much more to learn it pages left to be read  
So put up the front while you jam for the grammar thats poor  
While I hold the scrapbook thats heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor  
Words can weigh a ton  
Therefore its never to fall into the hands of the wrong one  
  
Scratched samples  Yeah Its another  
  
There are few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side  
But I see no borderline from under this colorblind  
And some will probably never hold peices of the sacred  
But then Im finally about to put an end to the hatred  
The world would never endure to arguing  
Awaking to the abscence of unity is startling  
Oh foolish pride what the hell is you tryin to do  
You cannot beat someone thats better than you so quit trying to  
The outcome we want nothing despicable  
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable  
Youre graceless bland youre tasteless and youre faceless and  
Youre dull its time you faced this here taste this  
Straight from off of the pile one of the numerous styles  
The date of my birth on the Earth the deliverence of a starchild  
Rest with formidable talent and versatility  
  
But with such a power there comes a responsibilty  
To infridge on the boundaries so now the defiance is clear  
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear  
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin  
Refuser abusin its accepted now its a trend  
  
Scratched samples  Yeah Its another  
  
You know I dont understand why we all just cant get along  
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for  
No so then why do you speak for me  
And every other white man when you that were your enemy  
  
On the floor lies a broken door cause Im not to be spoken for  
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore  
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me  
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry  
But Ive apologies are exhausted  
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted  
So who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted  
Switch to the opposite now see it being reenacted  
Pull up the quick  
These we hate him these are past us huh  
Always fighting for the position of top dog  
That spots already occupied and I dont play leapfrog  
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory thats already mine  
But Im always having to proove myself time after time  
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast  
Judged from the past and hes put last  
And bluffing with nothing to say stutterin and slurrin  
And mutterin words with no meaning attack me side Im like Danny Kane  
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin  
And eat it like cheese pass me the crackers please  
Ive got a craving  
  
Scratched sample until end  Im the man
