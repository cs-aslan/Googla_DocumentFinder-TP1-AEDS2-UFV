I used to be a booze hound  
Spent my time downtown  
  
Gettin round  
Sittin in the barroom  
Tryin to get another drink  
I think youve had enough  
come on just one more  
This time I aint feelin so fine  
What cha say we get to downin  
Dont throw me just forget about the line  
I wish I could be drownin  
Sweet water I aint seen her in a while  
I dont know if I can face her  
I know she can always make me smile  
If I cant outrun my chaser  
I used to be a booze hound  
  
Buzzin round midtown  
Gettin loaded  
Tryin to get a number  
Feelin mighty good  
  
is this guy bothering you   
no no I was just  
All my life there aint never been a drought  
Thats probably been my downfall  
Even though you know  
I might be passed out  
I wont drop the high ball  
I know where the river flows  
And the lives that it devours  
Aint it great I can touch my nose  
But I cant smell the flowers  
I used to be a booze hound  
  
Stumblin uptown  
Gettin higher  
Fallin off the bar stool  
Rememberin where I left the floor  
say buddy you need some help  
no Im cool  
  
Come and get me you can be my boogey man  
You can catch me on the rebound  
You may not fly like the candy man can  
But its safer on the ground  
Just one more trip to the fun house  
Theyll smother me with foam  
See my brother thats the one house  
That I can call my home
