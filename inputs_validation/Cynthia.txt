Cynthia when you come walkin by youre an inspiring sight  
Cynthia you dont smile or say hi but baby thats alright  
Cause I dont need to hold you or taste your kiss  
I just like knowin Cynthia you exist  
in a world like this  
  
Cynthia when you pass it seems like this whole town drops  
Cynthia or maybe its just me baby and these fools stuck here punchin this
clock  
Well you give us a reason to stop just for a while  
Stop stand and salute your style  
  
Well now you aint the finest thing Ill never have  
And when you go the hurt you leave baby it aint so bad  
There aint a man in this whole town whod say you aint fine  
You hear them guys talkin tell me baby do you mind  
Well you make us happy honey when we feel sad  
To see something so good in a world gone bad  
Theres still Cynthia  
  
Cynthia no one knows your number no one knows where you live  
Cynthia I wonder do you understand this strange thing you give  
Well baby is it your style the mystery in your smile  
Or just how cool you walk in a world gone wild  
Tell me if you will Cynthia
