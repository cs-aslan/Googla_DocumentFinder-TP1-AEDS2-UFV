Youve been tryin very heard  
Now this time youve gone too far  
Your performance perfect  
In every way perfect  
I hear rumors all around  
Contracts and lawyers  
And champagne downtown  
Tell me what you think  
You want me to do  
Ive been always fair with you  
Turning on me  
After all weve been through  
You want trouble then thats just  
The way it will be  
  
Youre caught up in the power  
A blue magical maze  
Now the circle is broken  
In a spellbinding rage  
Better see if youre holdin  
The wrong edge of the blade  
  
If its sharp if it cuts  
Enjoy yourself
