Day after day I must face a world of strangers  
Where I dont belong  
Im not that strong  
Its nice to know that theres someone I can turn to  
Who will always care  
Youre always there  
  
When theres no getting over that rainbow  
When my small list of dreams wont come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I wont last a day without you  
  
So many times when the city seems to be  
Without a friendly face  
A lonely place  
Its nice to know that youll be there if I need you  
And you always smile  
Its all worth while  
  
When theres no getting over that rainbow  
When my small list of dreams wont come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I wont last a day without you  
  
Touch me and I end up singing  
Troubles seem to up and disappear  
You touch me with the love youre bringin  
I cant really lose when youre near  
When youre near my love  
If all my friends have forgotten all their promises  
Theyre not unkind  
Just hard to find  
One look at you and I know that  
I could learn to live without the rest  
I found the best  
  
When theres no getting over that rainbow  
When my small list of dreams wont come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I wont last a day without you  
  
When theres no getting over that rainbow  
When my small list of dreams wont come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I wont last a day
