Went to buy me a paper at the local newsstand  
And then I heard them laugh and say  
Look theyre gonna go flying way up to the moon now  
Hey whats it good for anyway  
So I said  
Fellas like to ask you a thing if I may  
  
What about Livingstone  
What about all those men  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me wasnt it worth the while  
Traveling up the Nile  
Putting themselves on test  
Didnt that help the rest  
Wasnt it worth it then  
What about Livingstone  
  
And all of those fellas at the local newsstand  
Didnt know what to answer or what to say  
So I told them about him that he was just like  
One of those spacemen in his way  
And if you laugh at them  
Then theres only a thing I can say  
  
What about Livingstone  
What about all those men  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me wasnt it worth the while  
Traveling up the Nile  
Putting themselves on test  
Didnt that help the rest  
Wasnt it worth it then  
  
What about Livingstone  
Didnt he do it well didnt he  
What about all those men  
Didnt he do it well didnt he  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me wasnt it worth the while  
Didnt he do it well didnt he  
Traveling up the Nile  
Didnt he do it  
Putting themselves on test  
Didnt that help the rest  
Didnt that help them Well didnt it  
Wasnt it worth it then  
What about Livingstone  
Didnt he do it well didnt he  
What about all those men  
Didnt he do it well didnt he
