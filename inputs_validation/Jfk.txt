His smile like a million roses bathed in rock n roll  
Ours was the greatest love story ever told  
Throat like an angel with a voice that was made of gold  
Thats my baby  
  
He was the king of the town with a crown that would never fall  
A heart that would beat like a base for his baby doll  
One in a million inimitable song  
Thats my baby  
Young or old summer or cold  
Young or old summer or cold  
Youve got a way like jfk  
When you pull it the way that you move it  
Spins me around like a record baby  
And youve got a soul like no one I know  
Youre so erratic the way you see through that shit  
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy  
He was the king of the town with a crown that would never fall  
A heart like a base that would beat for his baby doll  
Mind like a diamond an inimitable song  
Thats my baby  
Young or old summer or cold  
Young or old summer or cold  
Youve got a way like jfk  
When you pull it the way that you move it  
Spins me around like a record baby  
And youve got a soul like no one I know  
Youre so neurotic the way you see through that shit  
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy  
It drives me crazy  
Youve got it and I want it  
Wild summer nights in July funny  
You know that you can always come home to the one who gave you your name  
Cause I see a light in your eyes  
Its so bright and the skies they open wide for you  
So come to me my baby  
Youve got a way like jfk  
When you pull it the way that you move it  
Spins me around like a record baby  
And youve got a soul like no one I know  
Youre so erratic the way you see through play that shit  
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy  
It drives me crazy  
It drives me crazy  
Crazy
