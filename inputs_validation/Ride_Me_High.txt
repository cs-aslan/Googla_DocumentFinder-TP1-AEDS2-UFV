Lowdown way youre feeling the sexy things you do  
Baby baby baby let me talk to you  
I just love to whisper in your sexy ear  
Tell you that I love you take away your fear  
Destroy your inhibitions ridin back the day  
Lowdown slow down keeping low down in that funky way  
  
Higher higher higher how high can you go  
Ride me high this morning ride me high some more  
  
The way you move your body it is a crying shame  
I wont tell nobody if you will do the same  
If you leave tomorrow one thing thats for sure  
The more you get the more youve got the more you want some more  
  
Higher higher higher how high can you go  
Ride me high this morning ride me high some more
