Day after day you go on living  
While I wait it still feels the same  
Im stuck for answers while you place the blame  
I guess it comes to this again  
So whats there left to say  
You thought youd feel no different  
Now that everything has changed  
  
I guess it comes to this again  
What difference does it make  
That you and I think better  
Of the choices that weve made  
Its fading away  
I dont remember everything  
The words we used to say  
Seem insignificant today
