Take take take takin what you dont need  
Youll get get gettin what you dont need  
Stand back take a look and take heed  
All the children in gods kingdom bleed  
See the networks of concrete and steel  
Theyve no mystery but what they reveal  
Tells a story of a future thats void  
Of the beauty and the majesty that life on  
Earth is meant to be  
  
Talk talk talk talk about the government  
And not a word about political favor  
Everything touched is my political choice  
The life you take is your political voice  
The sacred cows come crashing to their knees  
Golden harvest reaped without intelligence  
Theres no chance between the heavens and the seas  
In a blood bath dont laugh  
Grab your piece of golden calf  
  
Waste not want not pick it up  
Waste not want not pick it up  
Waste not want not pick it up  
Waste not want not  
  
Do unto others as you wish be done to you  
Theres a million lies round everything true  
You slaughter when you feast  
You disrespect the beast  
Make our beds and lie there take your share  
  
Waste not want not pick it up  
Waste not want not pick it up  
Waste not want not pick it up  
Pick it up and eat it  
Waste not want not
