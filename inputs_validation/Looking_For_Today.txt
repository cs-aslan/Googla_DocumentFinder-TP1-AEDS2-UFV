Its complete but obsolete  
All tomorrows become yesterday  
In demand but second hand  
Its been heard before you even play  
  
Up to date but came too late  
Better get yourself another name  
Youre so right but overnight  
Youre the one who has to take the blame  
  
Everyone just gets on top of you  
The pain begins to eat your pride  
You cant believe in anything you knew  
When was the last time that you cried  
  
Dont delay youre in today  
But tomorrow is another dream  
Sundays star is mondays scar  
Out of date before youre even seen  
  
At the top so quick to flop  
Youre so new but rotting in decay  
Like butterfly so quick to die  
But youre only looking for today  
  
Everyone just gets on top of you  
The pain begins to eat your pride  
You cant believe in anything you knew  
When was the last time that you cried  
Looking for today  
  
Glamour trip so soon to slip  
Easy come but oh how quick it goes  
Ten foot tall but what a fall  
Hard to open yet so easy to close  
Front page news but so abused  
You just want to hide yourself away  
Overpaid but soon you fade  
Because youre only looking for today  
Looking for today
