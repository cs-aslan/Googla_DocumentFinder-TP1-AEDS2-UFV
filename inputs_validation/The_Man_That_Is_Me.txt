Im a dreamer by nature  
And Ive always been tryin  
To dream myself out of this world that Im in  
In my dreams I escape all the troubles around  
And it hasnt cost a penny  
For the pleasures Ive found  
  
What is the part  
That Ill play today  
Beggar a business man king for a day  
Ive played many parts  
And Im the first to agree  
That Im still lookin round for the man that is me  
  
Im a dreamer by nature  
And Ive always been  
Looking for something not there  
My financial position  
Dont bother my dreams  
Cause in fairy tale money  
Im my own millionaire  
  
What is the part  
That Ill play today  
Beggar a business man king for a day  
Ive played many parts  
And Im the first to agree  
That Im still lookin round for the man that is me  
  
Im a rich man in dreams  
But in real life Ive hid  
From the fact that Ive got me a wife and a kid  
If I lose what Ive got  
Then they lose it too  
Tell me what in this worlds a poor dreamer to do  
  
What is the part  
That Ill play today  
Beggar a busness man king for a day  
Ive played many parts  
And Im the first to agree  
That Im still lookin round for the man that is me
