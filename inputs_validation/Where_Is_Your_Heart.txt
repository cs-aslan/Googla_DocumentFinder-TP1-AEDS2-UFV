I dont believe in the smile that you leave  
When you walk away and say goodbye  
Well I dont expect the world to move underneath me  
But for Gods sake could you try  
I know that youre true to me  
Youre always there you say you care  
I know that you want to be mine  
  
Chorus  
Where is your heart cause I dont really feel you  
Where is your heart what I really want is to believe you  
Is it so hard to give me what I need  
I want your heart to bleed thats all Im asking for oh  
Where is your heart  
  
I dont understand your love is so cold  
Its always me whos reaching out for your hand  
And Ive always dreamed that love would be effortless  
Like a petal falling to the ground  
A dreamer following his dream  
  
Chorus  
  
It seems so much is left unsaid  
But you can say anything  
Oh anytime you need  
Baby its just you and me oh yeah  
  
I know that youre true to me  
Youre always there you say you care  
I know that you want to be mine  
  
Where is your heart cause I dont really feel you  
Where is your heart what I really want is to believe you  
Is it so hard to give me what I need  
I want your heart to bleed thats all Im asking for yeah  
  
Where is your heart cause I dont really feel you  
Where is your heart what I really want is to believe you  
Is it so hard to give me what I need  
I want your heart to bleed and thats all Im asking for  
Where is your heart Repeat x4
