We got bruised wrists kick flips sending an invasion  
They say loose flips sink ships so might get your probation  
No more teeth six in the mix ripping round rotation  
Chuck E Cheese chips or kung fu kicks just a kids sensation  
So turn the radio on press one for rock  
Got a cuff to get off whats done is done  
Turn the radio on its never enough  
I wanna change it all I want it all  
But you cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
Give up give up give up the dream is over  
We lost the moment now were running sober  
Give up give up give up dont even bother  
Cant get what we want  
Give up give up give up the dream is over  
Were going slow and dropping on their shoulder  
Give up give up give up dont even bother  
Well never get what we want  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
We want star ships banana clips and start a hip religion  
And a postscript recensionship to help them find a vision  
But the bad pray for double play and move with preprecision  
And like arsenic were getting sick of all our indecision  
So turn the radio on press one for rock  
Got a cuff to get off whats done is done  
Turn the radio on its never enough  
I wanna change it all I want it all  
But you cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
Give up give up give up the dream is over  
We lost the moment now were running sober  
Give up give up give up dont even bother  
Cant get what we want  
Give up give up give up the dream is over  
Were going slow and dropping on their shoulder  
Give up give up give up dont even bother  
Well never get what we want  
Hey hey hey  
Its like working on the pieces when the puzzle doesnt fit  
Its like the feeling that you get right before you get hit  
Its like the ground opened up and swallowed you when you sit  
Its like be careful what you have cause now you got shit  
Its like you cant always get what you want  
Opened up and swallowed you  
You cant always get what you want  
Its like a time bomb  
You cant always get what you want  
Opened up and swallowed you  
You cant always get what you want  
Give up give up give up the dream is over  
We lost the moment now were running sober  
Give up give up give up dont even bother  
Cant get what we want  
Give up give up give up the dream is over  
Were going slow and dropping on their shoulder  
Give up give up give up dont even bother  
Well never get what we want  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey
