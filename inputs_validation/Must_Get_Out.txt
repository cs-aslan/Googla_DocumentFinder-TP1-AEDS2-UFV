Ive been the needle and the thread  
Weaving figure eights and circles around your head  
I try to laugh but cry instead  
Patiently wait to hear the words youve never said  
  
Fumbling through your dresser drawer  
Forgot what I was looking for  
Try to guide me in the right direction  
Making use of all this time  
Keeping everything inside  
Close my eyes and listen to you cry  
  
Chorus  
Im lifting you up  
Im letting you down  
Im dancing till dawn  
Im fooling around  
Im not giving up  
Im making your love  
This citys made us crazy and we must get out  
  
This is not goodbye she said  
Its just time for me to rest my head  
She does not walk she runs instead  
Down these jagged streets and into my bed  
  
When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer  
Forgot what I was looking for  
Try to guide me in the right direction  
Making use of all this time  
Keeping everything inside  
Close my eyes and listen to you cry  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres only so much I can do for you  
After all of the things youve put me through  
  
Chorus
