I dont want to go  
Something tells me no no no no  
But traces in the sand  
The lines that set my hand  
Say go go go  
  
Beware of a place  
A smile of a bright shining face  
  
Ill never return how do you know  
Tarot woman  
I dont know  
I dont know  
  
She can take you there  
The entrance to the fair  
Mine mine mine  
  
Ride the carousel  
And cast a magic spell  
You can fly fly  
  
Beware of a place  
A smile of a bright shining face  
  
Ill never return how do you know  
Tarot woman well I dont know  
I dont know  
I dont know  
I dont know  
  
Something in the air  
Tells me to beware no no no  
Her love is like a knife  
Shell carve away your life  
So go go go  
  
Beware of a place  
A smile of a bright shining face  
  
Ill never return how do you know  
Tarot woman I dont know  
I dont know  
I dont know  
Hey I dont know
