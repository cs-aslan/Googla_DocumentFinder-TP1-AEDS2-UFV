Shes got her halo and wings  
Hidden under his eyes  
But shes an angel for sure  
She just cant stop telling lies  
But its too late for his love  
Already caught in a trap  
His angels kiss was a joke  
And she is not coming back  
  
Because heaven sends and heaven takes  
Crashing cars in his brain  
Keep him tied up to a dream  
And only she can set him free  
And then he says to me  
  
Kill me now kill me now kill me now kill me now  
Kill me now kill me now kill me now kill me now  
  
Yeah shes got a criminal mind  
Hes got a reason to pray  
His life is under the gun  
Hes got to hold every day  
  
Now he just wants to wake up  
Yeah just to prove its a dream  
Cause shes an angel for sure  
But that remains to be seen  
  
Because heaven sends and heaven takes  
Crashing cars in his brain  
Keep him tied up to a dream  
And only she can set him free  
And then he says to me  
  
Kill me now kill me now kill me now kill me now  
Kill me now kill me now kill me now kill me now  
  
Stupid on the streets of London  
James Dean in the rain  
Without her its not the same  
The same the same but its alright  
  
Because heaven sends and heaven takes  
Crashing cars in his brain  
Keep him tied up to a dream  
And only she can set him free  
And then he says to me  
  
Kill me now kill me now kill me now kill me now  
Kill me now kill me now kill me now kill me now  
Again and again
