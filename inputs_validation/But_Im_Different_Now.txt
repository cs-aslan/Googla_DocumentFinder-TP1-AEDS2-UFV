Picked you up and let you down and  
I never said a word  
But Im different now and Im glad that youre my girl  
Mess you round and upset you  
I hurt you most of all  
But Im different now and Im glad that youre my girl  
  
Fun lasts for seconds love lasts for days but  
But you cant have both  
And Im different now but Im glad that youre my girl  
  
Because I know I done some things  
That I should never have done  
But Im different now and Im glad that youre my girl
