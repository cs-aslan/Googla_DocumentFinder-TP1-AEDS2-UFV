Im a freewheeler an underground dealer  
The kind of guy you never get to know  
So you can quit thinking about stoppin my drinkin  
You know Ill go the road I choose to go  
  
Im a freewheeler living undercover  
When things get hot I have to move out fast  
When they know Im lyin the women come cryin  
But still I go the road I choose to go  
  
Noones ever going to rearrange me  
Noones ever going to try to change me  
You know Ill go the road I choose to go  
  
Im doin fine takin my time  
I dont want to settle down  
Nonono
