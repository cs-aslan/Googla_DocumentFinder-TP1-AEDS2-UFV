Wont you lend your lungs to me  
Mine are collapsing  
Plant my feet and bitterly  
Breathe up the time thats passing  
Breath Ill take and breath Ill give  
Pray the days not poison  
Stand among the ones that live  
In lonely indecision  
  
Fingers walk the darkness down  
Mind is on the midnight  
Gather up the gold youve found  
You fool its only moonlight  
And if you stop to take it home  
Your hands will turn to butter  
Better leave this dream alone  
Try to find another  
  
Salvation sat and crossed herself  
And called the devil partner  
Wisdom burned upon a shelf  
Wholl kill the raging cancer  
Seal the river at its mouth  
Take the water prisoner  
Fill the sky with screams and cries  
Bathe in fiery answers  
  
Jesus was an only son  
And love his only concept  
But strangers cry in foreign tongues  
And dirty up the doorstep  
And I for one and you for two  
Aint got the time for outside  
Keep your injured looks to you  
Well tell the world that we tried
