Though you dont call anymore  
I sit and wait in vain  
I guess Ill rap on your door  
Tap on your window pane  
I want to tell you baby  
Changes Ive been going through  
Missing you listen you  
Til you come back to me  
Thats what Im gonna do  
Why did you have to decide  
You had to set me free  
Im gonna swallow my pride  
Im gonna beg you to please  
Baby wont you please see me  
Im gonna walk by myself  
To prove that my love is true  
Oh for you baby  
Til you come back to me  
Thats what Im gonna do  
Living for you my dear  
Is like living in a world of constant fear  
Hear my plea Ive got to make you see  
That our love is dying  
Our love is dying  
Its dying  
Although your phone you ignore  
Somehow I must explain  
Im gonna rap on your door  
Tap on your window pane  
Im gonna camp on your step  
Until I get through to you  
Ive got to change your view baby  
Til you come back to me  
Thats what Im gonna do  
Yeah til you come back to me  
Thats what Ill do  
Til you come back to me  
Thats what Im gonna do
