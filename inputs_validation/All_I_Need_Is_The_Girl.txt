Got my tweed pressed  
Got my best vest  
  
All I need now is the girl  
Got my striped tie  
Got my hopes high  
Oh Ive got the time and the place and the rhythm  
All I needs the girl to go with em  
If shell just appear  
Well take this big town for a whirl  
And if shell say  
My darling Im yours Ill throw away  
My striped tie and my best pressed tweed  
All I really need is the girl  
  
Look out now  
You all didnt know I could do that did you  
You still dont know I can do that do you  
  
Oh Ive got the time and the place and the rhythm  
All I needs the girl to go with em  
If shell just appear  
Well well take this big town for a whirl  
And if shell say  
Oh Harry I love ya  
Then Ill throw away my striped tie  
Ill throw away my best pressed tweed  
  
Its a very aqward moment here in the theatre right now  
You dont know exactly how to act or what to think  
And Im in control  
  
A spattering of applause makes the people yet more uncomfortable
