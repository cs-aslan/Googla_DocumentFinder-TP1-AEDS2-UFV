Reaching out now and I touch your face  
Please believe Im only traveling  
Like seeking wonder from a foreign place  
It matters not from where Im coming  
  
And the snow so light is bleeding  
We sleep so tight when were breathing  
Calm a little pint of soul  creeping  
  
Calm the light let me fly back to Basom call is waiting contemplate a
thread already spun  
Calm the light let me fly back to Basom should you carry what you are is
cooked until its done  
  
Left to locate the last trace of waste  
I picked it up and it was smiling  
Just like the dancer who has lost her leg  
She laughs alone but then shes crying  
  
And the snow so light is bleeding  
We sleep so tight when were breathing  
Calm a little pint of soul  creeping  
  
Calm the light let me fly back to Basom call is waiting contemplate a
thread already spun  
Calm the light let me fly back to Basom should you carry what you are is
cooked until its done
