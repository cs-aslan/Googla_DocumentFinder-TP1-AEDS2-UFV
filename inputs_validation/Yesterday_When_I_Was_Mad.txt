Darling you were wonderful you really were quite good  
I enjoyed that though of course no one understood  
A word of what was going on they didnt have a clue  
They couldnt understand your sense of humour like I do  
  
Youre much too kind  
I smiled with murder on my mind  
  
Yesterday when I was mad  
And quite prepared to give up everything  
Admitting I dont believe  
In anyones sincerity and thats whats really got to me  
  
You have a certain quality which really is unique  
Expressionless such irony although your voice is weak  
It doesnt really matter cause the music is so loud  
Of course its all on tape but no one will find out  
  
You hated me too  
But not as much as I hated you  
  
Yesterday when I was mad  
And quite prepared to give up everything  
Admitting I dont believe  
In anyones sincerity and thats whats really got to me  
  
Then when I was lonely  
I thought again  
And changed my mind  
  
Then we posed for pictures with the competition winners  
And argued about the hotel rooms and where to go for dinner  
And someone said Its fabulous youre still around today  
Youve both made such a little go a very long way  
  
Yesterday when I was mad  
And quite prepared to give up everything  
Admitting I dont believe  
In anyones sincerity and thats whats really got to me  
  
Yesterday when I was mad  
And quite prepared to give up everything  
Admitting I dont believe  
In anyones sincerity and thats whats really got to me  
  
Then when I was lonely  
I thought again  
And changed my mind
