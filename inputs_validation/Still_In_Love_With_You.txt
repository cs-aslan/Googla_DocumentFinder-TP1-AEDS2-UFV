Think Ill just fall to pieces  
If I dont find something else to do  
This sadness never ceases  
Im still in love with you  
  
My head it keeps on reeling  
Its got me in a crazy spin  
Darling darling darling  
Is this the end  
  
They say time has a way of healing  
Dries all the tears from your eyes  
But darling its this empty feeling  
My heart cant disguise  
  
After all that weve been through  
I try my best but its no use  
I guess Ill keep on loving you  
Is this the end  
  
Now that its all over woman  
Theres something I think you should know  
Baby baby think it over  
Just one time before you go  
  
Call on me baby  
If theres anything I can do for you  
Call on me baby  
Help me see it through  
  
Call on me baby  
why dont you call on me baby  
aww help me see it through  
Im in love so in love with you
