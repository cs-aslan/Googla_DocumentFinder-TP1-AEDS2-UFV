From the time that I wake to the time that I rise shes a lover and so am I  
But the lady loves her passion more than me  
When Im under her spell then I know very well how her magic can mystify  
And the lady leaves her lovers in ecstasy  
Shes young but shes wise and the heaven in her eyes at half a glance  
Is as much as a man can see  
But shell never really love any more than any other lover in her life  
And youll come to know the devil in Angelique  
For a moment it seems Im a part of her dreams  
And she loves like shes hypnotized  
While she hides inside the man shes made of me  
And then just when Ive found her her visions surround her  
And Ill never fill her eyes but I wonder who in hell the young girl sees  
And she moans and she sighs and you search inside her eyes  
But all you find is a man who can never be  
And you wonder if shell ever discover that the devil could never set her free  
Shes young but shes wise and the heaven in her eyes at half a glance  
Is as much as any man can see  
And youll never really lose any more than any other lover has lost in her
life  
When youve come to know the devil in Angelique  
And youll come to know the devil in Angelique  
And youll learn to love the devil
