There in the shadows looks like a hand  
Without its owner to give it a command  
Its got a purpose but I dont know what it is  
Im in trouble  
  
There in the streets looks like a man  
But something wrong that I dont understand  
His eyes are open but he dont see a thing  
His skin is peeling off his bones are sticking out  
Im getting scared  
  
Oh my god Is it dead  
Is it living Is it dead  
Is it dead or alive  
Is it dead Is it dead Is it dead  
Is it dead Is it dead  
Is it dead or alive  
  
Hiding in the cupboards like little mice  
Hiding in the frigerator that isnt nice  
Its not an animal it dont have legs  
No one else can see it  
  
It moves so fast corner of my eye  
Look again its gone its hiding  
Wont somebody help me doesnt anybody care  
It waits so patiently for me to lose my guard  
Im getting scared  
  
Is it dead is it  
Is it dead  
Is it dead  
Is it dead  
Is it dead or alive  
Is it dead  
Is it dead  
Is it dead  
Is it dead is it  
  
I remember there was a time  
When dead and buried meant just that  
Underneath the cold dark ground  
Things stay put  
  
Oh them bones they make them bodies walk  
Them bones them bones  
If they could only talk  
  
Is it dead
