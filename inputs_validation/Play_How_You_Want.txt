Chorus  
Pink  
Its Pink and Cuban Link  
This is the club with a latin swing  
So if ya wit it baby  
Blaze up a blunt  
Drink till your drunk  
Aint no rules  
Where were from  
Do your thing  
Play how you want  
Its Pink and Cuban Link  
Cause he be shinin like a diamond ring  
Now we be bringin it straight from the Bronx  
Drinkin dom prignon  
Till six in the mornin  
Theres a party goin on  
  
Cuban Link  
Yeah yo  
Mommas be lickin their lips  
Lookin as if they wanna give me a kiss  
Shakin their hips  
Im so good that they be givin me tips  
Is it perhaps  
That they think Im really handsome and shit  
Or just the fact that Im latin  
And Im packin the dick  
No matter what it is Im wit it  
Dont be actin shy or timid  
If you want it Ima give it  
No gimicks and skys the limit  
Baby dont stop  
Get it get it  
Pump that pussy  
Lemme hit it  
If you wit it  
Admit it  
I dont talk it I live it  
Give it a minute  
And Im already half way there  
Theres isnt still not a player  
With your ass in the air  
Takin your underwears off  
Cause I just dont care  
Dead in the middle of the dance floor  
Naked oh yeah  
Take it and get it  
Cause the rhythm got you shakin your rear  
You got a glare  
Like you havent been  
Fucked in a year  
Touchin your hair  
While I whisper  
Sweet nothins in your ear  
Love champagne  
But Id just rather  
Guzzle a beer  
Come over hear honey  
Cause you aint got nothin to fear  
Get somethin clear  
Im a player  
But you can trust me dear  
So look it here  
If theres a party  
Mami meet me at the pier  
We can stay in Manhattan  
And have a passionate affair  
Yeah yeah  
  
Chorus
