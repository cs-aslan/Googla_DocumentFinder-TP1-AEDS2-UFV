If I had one call to make  
I would dial yesterday and warn myself  
Tell my lips the words to say  
Not let you just walk away  
With someone else  
With someone else  
  
Chorus  
Next time I wont suffer this kind of pain  
Own my mistakes  
Not just pass off all the blame  
If you were here we could figure this out  
Then I wouldnt be bitter  
Id just be better now  
  
To be the strong and silent one  
A lot of good that has done  
Yes youd agree  
No more tryin to understand  
Or fix these things because you can  
Guess its up to me  
Yeah its up to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Id be much better off  
Much better off maybe  
If I could just let it go  
With no regrets then  
  
Chorus  
Next time I wont suffer this kind of pain  
Own my mistakes  
Not just pass off all the blame  
Youd still be hereand wed figure this out  
Then I wouldnt be better I wouldnt be better  
Oh no I wouldnt be bitter  
Id just be better now  
  
Oh
