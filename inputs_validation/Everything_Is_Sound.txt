When there is love I cant wait to talk about it  
When things get rough I like to walk with you  
Or when its night I like to be the light thats missing  
And remind you every minute of the future isnt written  
Now get it  
  
When there is love or when the heart feels heavy  
We can lighten it up if youve had enough  
Well you can empty your glass and we can fill it back up  
You know its up to us to make it all up  
So what you making up I can make it up back  
You could be loved no matter what  
You know the only time is right now its right well where you are  
You dont need a vacation when theres nothing to escape from  
  
Singing  
La la la la  
Lets all sing  
La la la la  
Lay me down  
Everything is sound  
  
Lets sing to be happy to feel things to communicate and be heard  
Or sing out to protest and to protect and to harmonize with birds  
Whether its your birthday or your dying day  
Its a celebration too  
Rejoice to use your voice and give wings to any old choice  
Whatever youre choosing right now its right where where you are  
You dont need a vacation when theres nothing to escape from  
  
Send your vibration and your undulation to the highest it can go  
And trust me hear me  
If it makes you wanna sing  
Just sing it  
  
La la la la  
Lets all sing  
La la la la  
Lay me down  
Everything is sound  
La la la la  
Lets all sing  
La la la la  
  
Its a song that Ive forgotten often  
It doesnt make me wrong  
Cause we all need the darkness to see the light  
And now were on rise come on and sing it  
  
La la la la  
Lets all sing  
La la la la  
Lay me down  
Everything is sound  
La la la la  
Lets all sing  
La la la la  
Were connected now  
La la la la  
Lets all sing  
Hallelujah  
Everything is sound  
La la la  
Lets all sing  
La la la la  
Were connected now
