Shes out of sync  
And everyone around her  
Knows that something is wrong  
Shes out of sync  
Shes got all the symptoms  
Of a girl who skipped a beat  
Shes out of sync  
A piece of ancient history  
Shes a walking mirage  
  
Shes out of sync  
She entered through the exit  
And never stopped to think  
Shes out of sync shes a half  
Step behind  
Shes out of luck her body split from  
Her mind  
Shes out of orbit shell never connect  
Shell run out of time before she accepts  
Shes out of sync  
  
Shes out of sync sync  
Shes out of sync sync  
Shes out of sync  
  
Everybody senses  
There s a distance to keep  
Shes out of sync  
And totally committed  
To living in a dark age  
Shes out of sync  
Constantly undoing  
Whats already been done  
Shes out of sync  
Trapped in a silent movie  
And shes on the brink  
Shes out of focus  
Shes a warp in time  
Shes discontinued  
A break in the line
