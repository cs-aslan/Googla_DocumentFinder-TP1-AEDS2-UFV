Girl you look mighty good to me  
And I know that youve got to be  
The kind of girl I could love  
  
Youve got the sweetest pair of eyes  
And your kiss would be paradise  
Youre the kind of girl I could love  
  
You do something to my soul  
That no ones ever done  
If youre looking for true love  
Then let me be the one  
  
Girl deep in my soul Im sure  
And my heart has no doubt that youre  
The kind of girl I could love  
The kind of girl I could love
