I threw a wish in the well  
Dont ask me Ill never tell  
I looked to you as it fell  
And now youre in my way  
  
I trade my soul for a wish  
Pennies and dimes for a kiss  
I wasnt looking for this  
But now youre in my way  
Your stare was holding  
Ripped jeans skin was showing  
Hot night wind was blowing  
Where you think youre going baby  
  
Hey I just met you and this is crazy  
But heres my number so call me maybe  
Its hard to look right at you baby  
But heres my number so call me maybe  
  
Hey I just met you and this is crazy  
But heres my number so call me maybe  
And all the other boys try to chase me  
But heres my number so call me maybe  
  
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad  
I missed you so bad I missed you so so bad  
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad  
And you should know that I missed you so so bad  
  
Its hard to look right at you baby  
But heres my number so call me maybe  
  
Hey I just met you and this is crazy  
But heres my number so call me maybe  
And all the other boys try to chase me  
But heres my number so call me maybe  
  
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad  
I missed you so bad I missed you so so bad  
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad  
And you should know that  
So call me maybe
