This is it  
Ive grown tired of fighting  
Whether youre right or wrong  
Whether Im weak or strong in your eyes  
Cause this is a lonely feeling  
Watching you turn away  
Why does it have to be this way  
On and on tonight  
Youve made a point of being right  
Making this a game instead of love  
You should know  
Where this goes  
Someones heart will surely be broken  
Before too long  
If we keep on playing this game  
Of right or wrong  
  
Chorus  
Whos right whos wrong  
When love is gone  
Whos right or wrong  false or true  
Never used to matter to you  
Youre almost crying  
Saying Ive gotta run  
Easier said than done  
  
Tell me why  
I want to know what youre hiding  
Turn around and look at me  
Ive never been this hard to see before  
If wed only come together  
For a moment here tonight  
You could hold me tight  
And ease your troubled mind  
You should know  
Where this goes  
Someones heart will surely be broken  
Before too long  
If we keep on playing this game  
Of right or wrong  
  
Right or wrong lady  
Right or wrong baby  
Im right youre wrong lady  
Youre right Im wrong baby  
Talkin about whos right or wrong  
It never really matters  
When your love is gone  
Sayin it out  
This right is wrong  
If all our lovin is gone
