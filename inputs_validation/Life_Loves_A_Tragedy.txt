Of all the words that Ive spoken  
And lies that Ive told  
Of all the hearts left broken  
Begged for bought and sold  
  
Lord Im feeling lonely  
Feel like I cant go on  
The streets have all grown cold now  
The mysteries all gone  
  
Shes all gone  
Shes all gone gone gone  
All gone now  
Shes all  
  
Well I aint getting any younger  
Cant you see it in my eyes  
She sweet has turned to sour  
I think its time for me to fly  
  
Well my vices have turned to habits  
And my habits have turned to stone  
The lies chipped away at my smile now baby  
While the truth ate me down to the bone  
  
One more step and I swear  
Ill be over the edge  
Ive gotta stop living at a pace that kills  
Before I wake up dead  
  
Chorus  
Good times bad times  
How life loves a tragedy  
Heartbreaks heartaches  
How life loves a tragedy  
  
The nights I spent in danger  
With strangers I thought were friends  
Only to wake in anger  
For some pleasure they swore theyd send  
  
I think its time I move on  
Like a rolling stone  
Cause I got all the broken dreams I can buy  
Its time to sell the ones I stole  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I paid the price  
For every thrill I got  
Those thrills are all long gone baby  
But Im still paying for them like it or not  
  
I think its time I move on like a rolling stone  
Cause I got all the broken dreams I can buy  
Its time to sell the ones I stole  
  
Chorus
