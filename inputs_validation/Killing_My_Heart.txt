Now hes brought down the rain and the Indian summer is through  
Youll be dancing down the country in the morning time if I know you  
You aint calling me to join you and Im spoken for anyway  
But youll be killing my heart  
When you go away  
Shall we gather by the river for to hear the lovely thunder crash   
Shall we sail now in your speeding bonnie boat here and gone like a splash   
You will see me small receding mouth hung open words I cannot say  
Youll be killing my heart  
When you go away  
Mike Rogers left his whiskey and the night is very very young  
Ive much to say and more to tell  
The words will soon be spilling from my tongue  
Ill rave and I will ramble Ill do everything but make you stay  
Youll be killing my heart  
When you go away
