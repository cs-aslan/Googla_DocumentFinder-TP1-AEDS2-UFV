If I look like a mean old man thats what I am  
If I look like a mean old man thats what I am  
If I look like a mean old man  
Wholl do you any way he can  
To break your heart and kiss your hand  
Thats what I am  
And if I look like a good old friend thats what I am  
If I look like a good old friend thats what I am  
If I look like a good old friend  
Whos good at bending with the wind  
To be your friend right to the end  
Thats what I am  
Chorus  
And if I look like a voodoo doll thats what I am  
If I look like a voodoo doll thats what I am  
If I look like a voodoo doll  
Who takes his licking standing tall  
Whod rather bite you back than crawl  
Thats what I am  
If I look like your uncle bob thats what I am  
If I look like your uncle bob thats what I am  
If I look like your uncle bob  
Who likes to slap you on the back and rob you  
While he still can do the job  
Thats what I am  
Chorus  
And if I look like a voodoo doll thats what I am  
If I look like a voodoo doll thats what I am  
If I look like a voodoo doll  
Who takes his licking standing tall  
Whod rather bite you back than crawl  
Thats what I am
