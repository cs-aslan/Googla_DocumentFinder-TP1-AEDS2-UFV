As I look around the little house we were so happy in  
I think of all the happy times well never see again  
Then I break down and start to cry the children ask what for  
I cant find a way to tell them that Daddy wont be home anymore  
Each night before they go to sleep they fold their little hands  
And say a prayer for Daddy fighting in their faroff land  
So tonight Ill help them say their prayers like Ive always done before  
God give me courage to tell them that Daddy wont be home anymore  
  
But honey as for me therell never be another man  
And Ill bring our children up the best way that I can  
You died for what you thought was right that much I know for sure  
But the children just cant understand why Daddy wont be home anymore  
  
No the children just dont understand why Daddy wont be home anymore
