I swear by Almighty God  
To tell the whole truth  
And nothing but the truth  
  
Guns guns  
They torture all the women and children  
Then theyve put the men to the gun  
cause across the human frontier  
Freedoms always on the run  
  
Guns guns ashaking in terror  
Guns guns killing in error  
Guns guns guilty hands  
Guns guns shatter the lands  
  
A system built by the sweat of the many  
Creates assassins to kill off the few  
Take any place and call it a court house  
This is a place where no judge can stand  
  
Sue the lawyers and burn all the papers  
Unlock the key of the legal papers  
A jury of a billion faces  
Shouted out condemned out of hand  
  
Guns guns and nobodys kidding  
Guns guns or foolin around  
Guns guns the violence is singing  
Guns guns a silence the sound  
  
N I like to be in Africa  
Abeatin on the final drum  
N I like to be in USSR  
Makin sure these things will come  
N I like to be in USA  
Pretending that the wars are done  
N I like to be in Europa  
Saying goodbye to everyone  
  
Guns guns theres guns on the roof  
Guns guns theyre made to shoot
