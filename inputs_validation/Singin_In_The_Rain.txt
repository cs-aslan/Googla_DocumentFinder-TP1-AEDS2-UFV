Im singin in the rain just singin in the rain  
What a glorious feeling Im happy again  
Im laughing at clouds so dark above  
The suns in my heart and Im ready for love  
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place  
Come on with the rain Ive a smile on my face  
Ill walk down the lane with a happy refrain  
And singin just singin in the rain  
  
Why am I smilin and why do I sing  
Why does December seem sunny as Spring  
Why do I get up each morning to start happy  
And get up with joy in my heart  
Why is each new task a trifle to do  
Because I am living a life full of you  
  
Im singin in the rain just singin in the rain  
What a glorious feeling Im happy again  
Im laughing at clouds so dark above  
The suns in my heart and Im ready for love  
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place  
Come on with the rain Ive a smile on my face  
Ill walk down the lane with a happy refrain  
And singin just singin in the rain
