Country women now what you gonna do with your life  
Country women now why dont you get out of this life  
Leave my life alone  
The first time I met you I knew you were the devils daughter  
You came on like a river doin all the things you oughta  
Youre a self made women baby not a madetoorder  
If you had your way  I know youd make me stay  
And that would only bring me down  
Country women now what you gonna do with your life  
Country women now why dont you get out of this life  
Leave my life alone  
  
Country women  country women country women  
Country women country women ahh  
Country women now what you gonna do with your life  
Country women now why dont you get out of this life  
Leave my life alone  
Leave my life alone  
Country women now country women now country women now  
Country women now country women now country women now
