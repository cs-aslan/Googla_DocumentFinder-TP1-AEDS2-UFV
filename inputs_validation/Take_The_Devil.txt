Open up your eyes  
Take the devil from your mind  
Hes been holding on to you  
And youre so hard to find  
The wind outside is cold  
Restless feeling in my soul  
Tempting me to get away  
But theres no place a man can go  
God will you lead me where I roam  
Help me not to let my feelings show  
No no you are the one oh how could you be  
So blind  
The devil prays on runaways  
Hes never far behind  
The many years Ive tried  
Now have been revealed to me  
Closer is the love youll find  
Waiting so patiently  
God will you lead me where I roam  
Help me not to let my feelings show  
No no  
Take the devil  
Take the devil  
From your mind
