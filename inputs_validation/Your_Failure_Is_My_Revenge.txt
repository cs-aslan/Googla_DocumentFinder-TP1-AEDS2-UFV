Go  
  
You say stand up for your rights  
  
But you fall for all their lies  
  
You Claim to know the truth  
  
While wearing a cheap disguise  
  
Who are you to judge us dont tell  
  
Us how to live our lives  
  
The real worlds outside your door  
  
Its gonna open your eyes  
  
Go  
  
Real life is coming gonna wipe  
  
The smile from your face  
  
Youll be left chocking gagging  
  
On realitys bitter taste  
  
Wont talk down to others when  
  
Youre living on your knees  
  
Slowly the hate sets in it  
  
Consumes you like a disease  
  
  
  
Oh your failure failure is my revenge  
  
Lifes gonna catch up with you in the end  
  
  
  
this world youve built is fragile  
  
Its all gonna come crashing down  
  
And when your world collapses  
  
I only pray that Im around  
  
To see the look on your face  
  
The hurt hollow and blank stare  
  
Of a person who just realized  
  
That no one ever cared
