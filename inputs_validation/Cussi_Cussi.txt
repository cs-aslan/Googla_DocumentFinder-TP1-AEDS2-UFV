Please  
Dont bee afraid of this  
Coz we dont move the way they do  
Surely you dont love them  
So why hide it away from me  
Please be easy you got it I havent  
Somewhere in your harmineenou homearneenou  
Theres a room in a long form  
Where you just play a tune  
It gets us really stoned  
Really amazingly  
Cussi Cussi Cussi  
Cussi Cussi Cussi Ah  
Dont let them in  
When you see that secret smile  
Baby dont let them in  
When you feel the ribbons eye  
You get the wrong idea  
Youll get broken  
And you never let yourself go again with me  
And Ive notice in your eyes  
A sadness I dont like  
To recognise  
You are feeling a heavy side of your ecstacy  
Now youre getting to me  
So that I can I hardly bear it  
So that I can I hardly bear it  
No no  
Dont get too deep  
Dont let them in  
When you see that secret smile  
Baby dont let them in  
When you feel the ribbons eye  
You get the wrong idea  
Youll get broken  
And you never let yourself go again with me  
Properly
