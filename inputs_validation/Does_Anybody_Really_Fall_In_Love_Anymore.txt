I walked down the street  
People passing me by  
They look me up and down  
But they dont look me in the eye  
Im just another stranger  
  
In my own home town  
Looking for an angel  
But heaven cant be found  
I say hey are you lonlely tonight  
hey hey hey Im gonna make it through  
  
But that dont make it right  
Does anybody really fall in love anymore  
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody  
Does anybody really ever open that door  
I know I know youve got to love somebody  
I know I know Ive got to find somebody to love  
Theres a sad face in the mirror  
  
And Im sad to say its mine  
Like a ghost up in the attic  
Only love can set him free  
Ive been running around in circles  
On this roller coaster ride  
Theres a lonely world around me  
I get sucked in by the tide  
I say hey love aint no crime  
  
So why is everybody so afraid to cross that line  
Does anybody really fall in love anymore  
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody  
Does anybody really ever open that door  
I know I know youve got to love somebody  
I know I know Ive got to find somebody to love  
  
Hey hey hey Ill be alright  
Cause I know that someone some wheres  
Gonna say these words tonight  
Does anybody really fall in love anymore  
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody  
Does anybody really ever open that door  
I know I know youve got to love somebody  
I know I know Ive got to find somebody to love
