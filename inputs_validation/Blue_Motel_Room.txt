Ive got a blue motel room  
With a blue bedspread  
Ive got the blues inside and outside my head  
Will you still love me  
When I call you up when Im down  
Here in Savannah its pouring rain  
Palm trees in the porch light like slick black cellophane  
Will you still love me  
When I call you up when I get back to town  
I know that youve got all those pretty girls coming on  
Hanging on your boomboompachyderm  
Will you tell those girls that youve got German Measles  
Honey tell them youve got germs  
I hope youll be thinking of me  
Because Ill be thinking of you  
While Im traveling home alone  
Tell those girls that youve got Joni  
Shes coming back home  
  
Ive got road maps  
From two dozen states  
Ive got coast to coast just to contemplate  
Will you still love me  
When I get back to town  
Its funny how these old feelings hang around  
You think theyre gone  
No no  
They just go underground  
Will you still love me  
When I get back to LA town  
You and me were like America and Russia  
Were always keeping score  
Were always balancing the power  
And that can get to be a cold cold war  
Were going to have to hold ourselves a peace talk  
In some neutral cafe  
You lay down your sneaking round the town honey  
And Ill lay down the highway  
  
Ive got a blue motel room  
With a blue bedspread  
Ive got the blues inside and outside my head  
Will you still love me  
When I get back to town
