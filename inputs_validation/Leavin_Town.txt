There she goes again see her smiling so happy with the new love that shes
found  
See her whisper in my ear all those things I used to hear  
Oh how that hurts me so Im leavin town shes the reason why Im leavin town  
Im going far away where no one knows me when morning comes well I wont be
around  
To see her whisper in his ear kiss and call him dear  
Oh I cant stand that so Im leavin town bet shes even glad Im leavin town
