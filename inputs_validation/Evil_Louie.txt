Some say the state of Texas  
Could accommodate the entire  
Human population  
Five point six billion versions of  
The truth under one roof  
Some revelation  
Take a bit of this give a  
Bit of that  
Put it in a blender pull it  
Out a hat  
Theres no going back its a lie  
Its a fact  
Has the cat got your tongue  
Been too long in the sun  
Theres dust on your tracks  
Theres no going back  
  
Come to think of its a  
Load of monkeys  
Every time you listen to your  
Sun kissed lovers words  
Evil Louie is tomorrows sadness  
Its a game of madness in a  
Perfect world  
  
Some would say French cuisines  
More appealing  
Than a cold drink  
Burgers and fries  
Some have said that a  
Pillar of society  
An upright citizens incapable of  
Lust and crime  
Tale a bit of this  
Give a bit of that  
Put it in a blender pull  
It out a hat  
But he dont stand a change  
With his pants around his ankles  
Has the cat got your tongue  
Been too long in the sun  
Theres dust on your tracks  
Theres no going back
