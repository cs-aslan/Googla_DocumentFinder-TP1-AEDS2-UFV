I was foolish cause I loved her so  
Never put no one else above her no  
She put it on me like no other did before  
Now she telling me that she wants to go  
  
She said she got dreams and she want back flights  
She said that she can act and she wants to sign  
Wants to build herself a rep make herself a name  
I tell you girl game recognizes game  
  
And Ill be good when youre gone for ever  
And Ill be fine when youre gone for good  
And Ill be good when youre gone for ever  
And Ill be fine when youre gone for good  
For good  
Gone for good  
  
You say you wanna be loved but wouldnt teach me how  
Girl I dont even know how to reach you now  
You say you wanna love but wouldnt speak no vow  
Girl you aint the one that can break me down  
  
Take all of my love and the you spread it around  
Girl I dont even know how to greet you now  
I hope maybe you choke I hope maybe you drown  
I said Hey Joe I heard you shot your lady down  
  
And Ill be good when youre gone for ever  
And Ill be fine when youre gone for good  
And Ill be good when youre gone for ever  
And Ill be fine when youre gone for good  
For good  
Gone for good  
  
Gone for good  
Gone for good
