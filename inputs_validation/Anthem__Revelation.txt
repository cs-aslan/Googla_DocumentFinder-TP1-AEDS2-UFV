See the sun rise  
Open up your eyes  
Today is the very first day  
Watch the morning come  
Now the night is gone  
Yesterday is so very far away  
Trouble you get out of my sight  
You know I cant look at you when the sun is so bright  
You know everythings coming together now  
Cant you see  
  
And I live my life in celebration  
That Ive got a life to live  
And I sing my song in revelation  
That Ive got a song that I can give to you  
And you know I do  
  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la  
  
I was blind but now I can see  
You know Im just learning how it feels to be free  
You know I never really knew just what it could be before  
  
And I live my life in celebration  
That Ive got a life to live  
And I sing my song in revelation  
That Ive got a song that I can give to you  
And you know I do and you know its true  
  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la
