What can I say shes walking away  
From what weve seen  
What can I do still loving you  
Its all a dream  
How can we  
Hang on to a dream  
How can it really be the way it seems  
What can I do shes saying were through  
With how it was  
What will I try still dont see why  
She says the things she does  
How can we  
Hang on to a dream  
How can it really be the way it seems  
What can I say shes walking away  
From what weve seen  
What can I do still loving you  
Is it all a dream  
How can we  
Hang on to a dream  
How can it really be the way it seems
