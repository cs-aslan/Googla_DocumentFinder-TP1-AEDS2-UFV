The freeway is jammed  
And its backed up for miles  
The car is an oven and baking is wild  
Nothing is ever the way it should be  
What we deserve we just dont get you see  
  
A briefcase a lunch and a man on the edge  
Each step get closer to losing his head  
Is someone in heaven are they looking down  
Cause nothing is fair just you look around  
  
Falling down  
Falling down  
Falling down  
  
Hes sick of waiting of lying like this  
Theres a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss  
Branded a leper because you dont fit  
In the land of the free  
You cant live by your wits  
  
Once he built missiles a nations defence  
Now he cant even give birthday presents  
Across the city he leaves in his wake  
A glimpse of the future a cannibal state
