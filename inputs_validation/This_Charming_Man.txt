Punctured bicycle  
On a hillside desolate  
Will nature make a man of me yet  
  
When in this charming car  
This charming man  
  
Why pamper lifes complexity  
When the leather runs smooth  
On the passengers seat  
  
I would go out tonight  
But I havent got a stitch to wear  
This man said its gruesome  
That someone so handsome should care  
  
Ah  A jumpedup pantry boy  
Who never knew his place  
He said return the ring  
He knows so much about these things  
He knows so much about these things  
  
I would go out tonight  
But I havent got a stitch to wear  
This man said its gruesome  
That someone so handsome should care  
La lala lala lala this charming man  
Oh lala lala lala this charming man  
  
Ah  A jumpedup pantry boy  
Who never knew his place  
He said return the ring  
He knows so much about these things  
He knows so much about these things  
He knows so much about these things
