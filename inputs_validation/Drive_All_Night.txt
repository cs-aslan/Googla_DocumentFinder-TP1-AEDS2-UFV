When I lost you honey sometimes I think I lost my guts too  
And I wish God would send me a word  
Send me something Im afraid to lose  
Lying in the heat of the night like prisoners all our lives  
I get shivers down my spine and all I want to do is hold you tight  
  
Chorus  
I swear Ill drive all night just to buy you some shoes  
And to taste your tender charms  
And I just want to sleep tonight again in your arms  
  
Tonight theres fallen angels and theyre waiting for us down in the street  
Tonight theres calling strangers  
Hear them crying in defeat  
Let them go let them go let them go  
Do their dances of the dead letem go right ahead  
You just dry your eyes girl and cmon cmon  
Cmon lets go to bed baby baby baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres machines and theres fire waiting on the edge of town  
Theyre out there for hire but baby they cant hurt us now  
Cause youve got youve got youve got  
Youve got my love youve got my love  
Through the wind through the rain the snow the wind the rain  
Youve got youve got my my love  
Heart and soul
