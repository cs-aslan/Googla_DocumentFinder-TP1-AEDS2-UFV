Chorus  
Dough is what I got lil mama  
Dough is what I got pretty lady  
Dough is what I got shortie  
Dough is what I got baby  
Cmon Im paid x4  
  
Lil Wayne  
Give a woman none uhhuh  
I already gave my brother some its my sister turn  
Aint it funny how the fish do burn  
But your boy just relax like a fresh new perm  
At the world in the barrel of the pistol term  
Well we get it how we live never live and learn  
Gotta talk about the flow cause you is concerned  
Only down south rapper couldve been in tha firm  
Or the commissioner of WuTang nigga  
Tryna tell you I can kick it like Liu Kang nigga  
Got the SubZero flow how you want me ma  
Nigga get over here like Scorpion  
And when it comes down to this recording  
I must be Lebron James if hes Jordan  
No I want ringsfor my performance  
Im more Kobe Bryant of an artist  
Same coach same game been starting  
Same triangle offense  
I come through the lane like dargent  
Refree niggaz is lame they call charging  
I have no brain Im retarded  
We are not the same Ima Martian  
You can be my Jane im your Tarzan  
Im from the jungle where the snakes is all poison  
I am magnificent like Marcus  
You might wanna fall back like August  
Or late september whatever you call it  
I hit niggaz in the head like Vonage  
I am talking to no particular audience  
But understand Im the guardian  
And understand there wont be no guardin him  
You will just get played like an accordion  
I dont give a damn if shes bossy  
I keep pussy running like a faucet  
She better catch like she Steve Largent  
Because Im Whats up like Martin  
  
Lil Wayne  
See I know yall be talking about and you dont like what you here sometimes  
But um um since Im so bright Ima put the spotlight on you baby  
  
Chorus  
Show me what you bout lil daddy  
I know you need to stop stop hatin  
I know what you not wodie  
And that is Weezy Baby  
Blunts up now  
Blaze x4  
  
Lil Wayne  
Tell the world take six  
Young dictionary make words make sense
