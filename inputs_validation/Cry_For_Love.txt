My life is like a racing car hurtling towards the wall  
At the speed of sound  
My time has been so finely tuned  
But Ive never seen a human being so tightly wound  
At times it seems beyond belief  
I just need a bit of relief  
Like a warweary soldier  
Marching up and over the edge  
Take my hand and pull me up cause Im falling too fast  
Somehow Ive lost my way  Im cryin save me  
  
Chorus  
Can you hear meIm calling out  
Im crying outa cry for love  
I can feel youyoure touching me  
You healing memy cry for love  
  
I will be the first to admit  
I dont have the strength to handle it alone anymore  
I dont have to fret dont have to explain  
All my worryings in vain  
Im not alone anymore  
  
Why is this so hard to believe  
What is mine is mine to freely receive  
Like the changing of seasons  
This is the beauty of the word  
And for all that I have seen and heard  
Oh I want to come home  
Somehow Ill make my way  my way home to you  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
Oh Father hear my call Oh Father hear my call  
I know youll catch me when I fall  
Oh Father hear my call  
I know youll catch me when I fall  
Oh I pray that youll hold me now  
Hold me  
And take my fear away  
  
Im cryin save me  
Oh I know that you can hear me  
Hear me crying out for love  
Oh I know that you can feel my cry for loveooh  
  
I can feel you  youre calling out  
Youre crying out  a cry for love  
I can feel you  youre touching me  
Youre healing me  my cry for love
