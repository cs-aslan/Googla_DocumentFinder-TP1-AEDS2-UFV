She walks real slow  
Talks like an animal  
What am I  
Supposed to do  
Ive tried to explain  
My hearts not a radio  
But I cant seem  
To get to you  
Face to face  
Tears on a heart of stone  
When she talks  
I walk away  
It seems to me  
Its just a waste of time  
These are words  
I know shes heard before  
Shes the girl  
Guess Ill always know  
And Ive tried  
Ive tried  
She always seems to know  
The morning after  
But not before  
I havent slept  
Worrying  
I know I promised  
To come see you  
But now I have these  
Things to do  
All in all  
It seems to me  
You dont understand subtlety  
Shall I make it obvious  
Do you really want me to make up  
She doesnt talk  
For days and days  
And when she does  
She always says  
That I act real slow  
Behave like an animal  
What am I supposed to do  
And Ive tried  
Ive tried  
But she always seems to know  
We dont make sense  
Love and Violence  
We dont make sense  
Love and Violence
