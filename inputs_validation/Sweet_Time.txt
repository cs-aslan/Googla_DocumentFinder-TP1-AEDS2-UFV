When I awaken  
Feelin no pain  
Visibly shaken  
Waitin to touch you again  
My temperatures risin  
But Im fallin a bit behind  
And that aint so surprising  
Were gonna take our own sweet time  
  
Baby we can take our own sweet time  
And spend it when we want to  
Cus its yours and mine  
Let our love come easy and we fin  
We can make it  
And well take our own sweet time  
  
I know when I hold you  
Its a feelin I cant explain  
But I never told you  
I couldnt take it again  
But now I am ready  
I am ready to make you mine  
So Im holdin steady  
And were gonna take our own sweet time  
  
Baby we can take our own sweet time  
And spend it when we want to  
Cus its yours and mine  
Let our love come easy and we find  
We can make it  
And well take our own sweet time  
Repeat  
  
Baby we can take our own sweet time  
And spend it when we want to  
Cus its yours and mine  
Let our love come easy and we find  
We can make it  
And well take our own  
We can make it  
And well take our own  
We can make it  
And well take our own sweet time
