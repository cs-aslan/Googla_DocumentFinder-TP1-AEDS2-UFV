Found my love by the gaswork croft  
Dreamed a dream by the old canal  
Kissed my girl by the factory wall  
Dirty old town dirty old town  
  
I heard a siren from the dock  
Saw a train set the night on fire  
Smelled the spring on the sulfured wind  
Dirty old town whoaoh dirty old town  
  
Were goin to take a good sharp axe  
Shining steel tempered in the fire  
And well chop you down like an old dead tree  
Dirty old town dirty old town  
Dirty old town whoaoh dirty old town  
  
And oh well chop you down  
Oh dirty dirty dirty old town  
Dirty old town dirty old town  
And oh whoaoh dirty old town  
Chop you down one of these days
