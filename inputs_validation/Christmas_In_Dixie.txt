By now in New York City theres snow on the ground  
And out in California the sunshines falling down  
And maybe down in Memphis Gracelands all in lights  
And in Atlanta Georgia theres peace on earth tonight  
  
Christmas in Dixie its snowin in the pines  
Merry Christmas from Dixie to everyone tonight  
Its windy in Chicago The kids are out of school  
Theres magic in Motown The citys on the move  
In Jackson Mississippi to Charlotte Caroline  
  
And all across the nation its the peaceful Christmas time  
Christmas in Dixie its snowin in the pines  
Merry Christmas from Dixie to everyone tonight  
And from Fort Payne Alabama  
And Knoxville Tennessee  
Merry Christmas tonight
