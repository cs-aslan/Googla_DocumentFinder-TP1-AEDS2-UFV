QTip  
Yo Niggas be on the mic they be all serious  
Id love to be serious but effortless shit  
Effortless effortless  
Turn my music up Duro Yo yo you my hero  
Make the shit get louda Even more in my headphones louda  
Uh Sweetheart shake yo ass cheeks  
Bust it  
  
We gon knock it down and put this  
Rock solid Amplified shit up  
Girl its like a situp  
So you betta send a letta to the better  
We cut the bank and takin all the bankin cheddar  
Girls get prettyed up  
Then they comin out the club Rap cats lock it up  
Worldwide vision where  
Everybody sees clear  
I could get you ten here  
Uh Makes no fuss Keep my shit plush  
Compliment I get blushed Thats just how a brother is  
Big Willy kids and we really run our jibs  
Ladies breathe easy Let your man please thee  
Uh Takin rhymes to another zone  
Is your mother home Cause we can get the moans  
And stay strickly on a rhythemic notion and  
Keep the joint close for the commotion and  
Keep movin around Movie stars  
Buy a little car buy out the bar  
  
Chorus QTip Meda Leacock  
All in for the people who move wit me  
All in for the nights of ecstasy  
All in for the way we work and play doin it  
Everyday This is how I need to be  
All in for the people who roll wit me  
All in for the nights of ecstasy  
All in for the people who work and play doin it  
Everyday this is how I need to be  
  
QTip  
Yeah Yeah yeah yeah what  
We do it alive blowin the spot of this  
Showin to prove what rap is What is it  
Marauder pass the blue moon  
Hit you with the ill tune  
Ass cheeks move wit the help of my jacket bloom  
Insert the veteran  
Who consecutively come wit shit yet again  
On the dance floor chicks get horny  
Hopin that they all move on me  
Word for REAL for real  
Do it hard for the love of the game  
Pull your card and Im askin yo name bitch  
JayDee be champion

Id advise you to fix your self for real  
And do your shit wit more zeal More zeal  
We in the mix and its thickenin  
My rhyme and its tickin in  
The hatin and the shit is so sickenin  
Picasso original Riginal  
You forgazy and the shit amaze me  
Sharpen your contrast and put a little color in it  
High Define your screen and put this brotha in it
