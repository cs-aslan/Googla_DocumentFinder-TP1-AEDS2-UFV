Disgraced  
Expendable we are not really real  
A mirage of solitude is what they try to heal and  
I will not be made to feel we are sealed in a fake charade  
  
Spewing bile atrocities  
Bringing existence to its knees  
I will manifest my sins and  
I will kill mercy within  
Immersed in this hypnotic spell  
Influenced by the hate that swells  
Im not terrified anymore  
Theres nothing left but open sores  
  
Disengaged  
Relinquish the reality Ive known  
Im feeling like Im alienated from my own and  
I will not be made to feel we are sealed in a fake charade  
  
Spewing bile atrocities  
Bringing existence to its knees  
I will manifest my sins and  
I will kill mercy within  
Immersed in this hypnotic spell  
Influenced by the hate that swells  
Im not terrified anymore  
Theres nothing left but open sores  
  
Spewing bile atrocities  
Bringing existence to its knees  
I will manifest my sins and  
I will kill mercy within  
Immersed in this hypnotic spell

Theres nothing left but open sores  
  
Nothing left but open sores
