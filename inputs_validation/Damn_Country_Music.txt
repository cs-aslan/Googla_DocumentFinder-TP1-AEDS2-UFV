I packed it all on a whim  
Threw an old Hank cassette tape in  
Dads 84 rusty Ford  
He swore wed never make it  
I quit my job let my momma down  
Broke an angels heart on the way out  
Of town  
Pulled my roots from the ground for  
The hum of wheels on the blacktop  
The strum of strings on a flat top  
Its a neon fever for a small town dreamer  
Tells you everything you have thats worth losin  
Damn country music  
You might get lost in the lights  
The things that keep you up all night  
Whiskey straight 3 am  
Chasin songs in your head  
Its the sweetest highs the lowest lows  
Needin yes and hearin no  
Just another soso  
Believe me i know  
Its the hum of wheels on the blacktop  
The strum of strings on a flat top  
Itll take you break you  
Damn sure make you  
Do things you never thought youd be doing  
Damn country music  
When the money the fame  
The lights on your name  
All fade away  
Well youll still be a slave to  
The hum of wheels on the blacktop  
The strum of strings on a flat top  
Its a neon fever for a small town dreamer  
Tells you everything you have thats worth losing  
Damn country music  
Damn country music
