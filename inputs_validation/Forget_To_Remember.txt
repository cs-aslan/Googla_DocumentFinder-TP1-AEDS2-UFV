Sands in the hourglass fall for us all  
You dont answer me anymore when I call  
So much is trapped inside tangled in your brain  
Its getting cold outside and it looks like rain  
The sky is falling and my heart is caving in  
  
So now the time has come to say the long goodbye  
The setting of the sun reflecting in your eyes  
Day after day after day the world will pass you by  
You forget to remember  
  
If this is living what the hell is living for  
Youve boarded up your eyes your mind has locked the door  
Im just a stranger now with an unfamiliar face  
You cant recall me at all  
Theres not a trace not a trace not a trace  
I dont know where you are and my world is crumbling in  
  
So now the time has come to say the long goodbye  
The setting of the sun reflecting in your eyes  
Day after day after day the world will pass you by  
You forget to remember  
  
I just want to talk  
What do you want  
But youve nothing to say  
Leave me alone  
I beg you to come  
Get away from me  
And you just walk away  
I have no idea who you are  
I curse the day that your smile fades away till then I pray  
  
A burning candle inbetween and at both ends  
With all that weve learned yet we still pretend  
I just wish you could say my name again  
  
They made the lock and broke the key  
The culprit was the mercury  
The vaccine wipes your memories  
Till you forget even how to breathe  
A tangled web they weave when they practice to deceive  
  
So now the time has come to say the long goodbye  
The setting of the sun reflecting in your eyes  
Day after day after day the world will pass you by  
I said that Id be strong but you know I had to lie  
  
You forget to remember its time to say the long goodbye
