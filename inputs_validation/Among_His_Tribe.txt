He would step out of the night and light a fire among his tribe  
Carving from a bears tooth he used the flesh to feed the youth  
Hed salt it down  
  
Sails were made from darkened hide fish were caught in the lowest tide  
Thought of war kept him strong he listened for the battle song  
In the night  
  
And the old would teach the young to heed the word of the masters tongue  
A chosen son would take a bride and light the fire among his tribe  
And on and on
