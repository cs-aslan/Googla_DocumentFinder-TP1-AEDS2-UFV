And they went home on an Easter road  
On a silent night tryin not to show  
Who goes where and who goes when  
Thinkin some day soon theyll get it back again  
  
From the ghetto in Capetown to dig the gold  
Little boy blue cant be sold  
Under tin roof and a plastic wall  
Thinkin someday soon were goin to leave it all  
  
And the renegades sing all the renegade songs  
And the ones who know hope theyre doin wrong  
The blacks and the coloreds play the Biko Drum  
Listen to the Biko Drum  
  
Transvaal Kids on a Transvaal day  
Little by little the show the way  
To a city of dreams and solid ground  
Thinkin someday soon were gonna come around  
  
Steve hes livin in a prison cell  
All the friends that know hope hes doin well  
Down here they listen to the Biko Drum  
Down here they listen to the songs he sung  
  
And the renegades sing all the renegade songs  
And the ones who know hope theyre doin wrong  
The blacks and the coloreds play the Biko Drum  
Listen to the Biko Drum  
  
Nelson listen to the people sing  
Nelson Mandela the peoples king  
Twentyfive years in a white mans jail  
Twentyfive years we couldnt make him say  
  
And the renegades sing all the renegade songs  
And the ones who know hope theyre doin wrong  
The blacks and the coloreds play the Biko Drum  
Listen to the Biko Drum
