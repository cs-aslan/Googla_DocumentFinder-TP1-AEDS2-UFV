So long big city  
Its time to say goodbye  
Im longing for those country roads  
I need to see the sky  
Think Ill take a swing down south  
Visit Tennessee  
See if that girl Annie  
Still remembers me  
  
Gonna take that blue highway  
And leave this sorry town  
Stayed too long but now Im gone  
And I know where Im bound  
I dont want to take the interstate  
It represents all the things I hate  
Im rolling down that blue highway  
  
So long confusion  
Its time to slow things down  
Say goodbye to my old friends  
Ease on out of town  
I made me some money here  
I paid for every day  
And every mile just makes me smile  
Cause Ive made my getaway  
  
Gonna take that blue highway  
And leave this sorry town  
Stayed too long but now Im gone  
And I know where Im bound  
Ive had it up to here with worry  
From now on Im in no hurry  
Rolling down that blue highway  
  
Ill be rolling down that blue highway  
You can find me on that blue highway
