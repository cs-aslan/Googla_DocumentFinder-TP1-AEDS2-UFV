Now youre lookin at a man thats gettin kind a mad  
I had lots of luck but its all been bad  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
Ill never get out of this world a live  
  
My fishin poles broke the creek is full of sand  
My woman run away with another man  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
Ill never get out of this world alive  
  
A distant uncle passed away and left me quite a batch  
And I was living high until that fatal day  
A lawyer proved I wasnt born  
I was only hatched  
  
Evrythings agin me and its got me down  
If I jumped in the river I would probly drown  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
Ill never get out of this world alive  
  
These shabby shoes Im wearin all the time  
Are full of holes and nails  
And brother if I stepped on a worn out dime  
I bet a nickel I could tell you if it was heads or tails  
  
Im not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow  
Cause nothins ever gonna be alright nohow  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
Ill never get out of this world alive  
  
I could buy a Sunday suit and it would leave me broke  
If it had two pair of pants I would burn the coat  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
Ill never get out of this world alive  
  
If it was rainin gold I wouldnt stand a chance  
I wouldnt have a pocket in my patched up pants  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
Ill never get out of this world alive
