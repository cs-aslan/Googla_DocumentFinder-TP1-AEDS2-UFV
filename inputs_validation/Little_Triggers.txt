Little triggers that you pull with your tongue  
Little triggers I dont want to be hung up strung up  
When you dont call up  
  
Chorus  
Little sniggers on your lips  
Little triggers in your grip  
Little triggersmy hand on your hip  
  
Thinkin all about those censored sequences  
Worryin about the consequences  
Waiting until I come to my senses  
Better put it all in present tenses  
  
Chorus  
  
Worryin about the common decency  
When it is only a question of frequency  
When you say OK but youve got cheek to be  
Sayin youre tired of me when you dont even weaken these  
Little sniggers on your lips  
Little triggers in your grip  
Little triggersmy hand on your hip
