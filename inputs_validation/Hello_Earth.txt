Hello Earth  
  
Columbia now nine times the speed of sound  
Roger that Dan Ive got a solid TACAN  
locked on uh TACAN twentythree  
The uh tracking data map data and preplanned  
trajectory are all one line on the block  
Roger your block decoded recorded  
  
Hello Earth  
Hello Earth  
With just one hand held up high  
I can blot you out  
Out of sight  
  
Peekaboo  
Peekaboo little Earth  
With just my heart and my mind  
I can be driving  
Driving home  
And you asleep  
On the seat  
  
I get out of my car  
Step into the night  
And look up at the sky  
And theres something bright  
Traveling fast  
Look at it go  
Look at it go  
  
Listen  
  
Watching storms  
Start to form  
Over America  
Cant do anything  
Just watch them swing  
With the wind  
Out to sea  
  
All you sailors  
Get out of the waves Get out of the water  
All lifesavers  
Get out of the waves Get out of the water  
All you cruisers  
Get out of the waves Get out of the water  
All you fishermen  
Head for home  
  
Go to sleep little Earth  
I was there at the birth  
Out of the cloudburst  
The head of the tempest  
Murderer  
Murder of calm  
Why did I go  
Why did I go  
  
Tiefer tiefer  
Irgendwo in der Tiefe  
Gibt es ein licht  
  
Go to sleep little Earth
