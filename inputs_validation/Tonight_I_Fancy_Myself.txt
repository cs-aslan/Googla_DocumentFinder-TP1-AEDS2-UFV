Shed brought along the oranges  
Hed brought the tea  
Theyd both brought along a sickbag just in case  
  
The plate of chicken sandwiches  
Were lovely they agreed  
And I watched him spit the bits into her face  
  
Do you love me like you used to he sighs  
I love you twice as much she replies  
They were on the train to Venice where else  
I think tonight I fancy myself  
  
Id rather drink that toast to my own health  
I think tonight Id rather love myself  
And if you drink that drink to your own health  
I think tonight Id rather love myself  
  
Later in the evening  
The sun came rolling down  
And they talked about their fantasies and fears  
  
Between the heavy breathing  
And those lighter licking sounds  
I heard him whisper this question in her ear  
  
Would you still love me if I lost my legs  
Id see that you were loved and you were fed  
I end up in a car crash almost dead  
For richer and for partly severed head  
  
Id rather drink that toast to my own health  
I think tonight Id rather love myself  
And if you drink that drink to your own health  
I think tonight Id rather love myself  
  
The neighbours ask them out but they flatly refuse  
Were saving up for a worldwide cruise  
With a choice between loneliness and lovesick QE2s  
Well tonight I choose  selfabuse  
  
A fourpack in the fridge  
A good book on the shelf  
I think tonight Id rather love myself
