Im trying to shave my legs  
Ups at the door  
The kids are clownin on the bed  
The door is scratchin up the floor  
Yeah  Everybody heres just a little crazy  
In our hoop jumping goodlovin Big Top baby  
  
Chorus  
Ooo hoo welcome to the party  
Ooo hoo were just getting started  
Take a front row seat  
Or the back if you prefer  
Cause to me this three ring  
Is the greatest show on earth  
Ooo hoo  
Ooo hoo  
  
Oh the babys on my hip and the noodles are boiling over  
Little Tommy just brought me a four leaf clover  
Im spinnin plates cause dinners late and the phone keeps ringing  
So I turn the radio up cause I feel like singing  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres toys in the yard and the house needs paintin  
And Im pretty sure the neighbors all hate us  
But the view sure looks nice from the front porch swing  
I wouldnt trade it for anything for anything  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
Welcome to the party oh welcome to the party welcome to the party  
Were just getting started
