Well if youve been a married woman  
And things didnt seem to work out  
Divorce is the key to being loose and free  
But youre gonna be talked about  
Everybody knows that you loved once  
They think youll love again  
You cant have a male friend  
When youre a has been  
Or a woman youre rated x  
yeah  
And if youre rated x  
Youre some kinda gold  
That even men turn  to make  
But I think its wrong  
To judge every picture  
If a cheap camera makes a mistake  
So if your best friends husband  
Says to you  
That you started lookin good  
You shouldve known he would  
And he would if he could  
And he will if youre rated x  
Well nobody knows where youre going  
But they sure know where you been  
All theyre thinking of  
Is your experience in love  
Well their minds fill up with sin  
The women all look at you like youre bad  
The men all hope you are  
But if you go too far  
Youre gonna wear the scar  
Of a women rated x  
yeah  
And if youre rated x  
Youre some kinda gold  
That even men turn  to make  
But I think its wrong  
To judge every picture  
If a cheap camera makes a mistake  
So if your best friends husband  
Says to you  
That you started lookin good  
You shouldve known he would  
And he would if he could  
And he will if youre rated x  
Yeah us women dont have a chance  
Cause if youve been married  
You cant have any fun at all  
Youre rated x  
No matter what they do  
Theyre gonna talk about ya  
Dont know what to think about it  
Just let em talk  
Just let em talk meg
