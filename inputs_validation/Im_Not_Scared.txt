Your lifes a mystery mine is an open book  
If I could read your mind I think Id take a look  
I dont care  
Baby Im not scared  
  
What have you got to fight What do you need to prove  
Youre always telling lies and thats the only truth  
I dont care  
Baby Im not scared  
  
Tonight the streets are full of actors  
I dont know why  
Oh take these dogs away from me  
Before they they bite  
  
What have you got to say of shadows in your past  
I thought that if you paid youd keep them off our backs  
But I dont care  
Baby Im not scared  
  
What have you got to hide Who will it compromise  
Where do we have to be so I can laugh and youll be free  
Id go anywhere  
Baby I dont care  
Im not scared  
I dont care  
Baby Im not scared  
  
Tonight the streets are full of actors  
I dont know why  
Oh take these dogs away from me  
Before they they bite  
Tonight I fought and made my mind up  
I know its right  
I know these dogs still snap around us  
But I can I can fight  
  
If I was you if I was you  
I wouldnt treat me the way you do  
If I was you if I was you  
I wouldnt treat me the way you do  you  
If I was you if I was you  
I wouldnt treat me the way you do  
If I was you if I was you  
I wouldnt treat me the way you do  you  
  
Im not scared  
Baby I dont care  
Id go anywhere  
Baby Im not scared  
Im not scared  
Oh Im not scared
