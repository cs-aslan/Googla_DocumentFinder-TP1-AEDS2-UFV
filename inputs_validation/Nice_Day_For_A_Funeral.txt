Black suits eyes closed  
Nothing left to hear  
One mistake blame the youth  
Crossed the line of fear  
Burn the bridges that we crossed in time  
Seemed the only way  
Not for nothing was his only crime  
A final price to pay  
  
Black days loss for words  
When theres so much left to say  
Times mine have so much time  
Since I went away  
Back across the bridges burned  
Now you walk alone  
The lights are on the doors unlocked  
No one is home  
  
I saw the last of sunshine  
Im going back to Mother Earth  
A cry of independence  
Ends in death  
  
Yeah the last of sunshine  
Oh ya know for what its worth  
Nice day for a funeral  
  
One last time to turn your back  
Dont kiss me when I go  
Dont wonder why it came to this  
You didnt want to know  
A bastard child and his misspent youth  
Yeah hes yours and mine  
Were digging graves not the buried truth  
If only we had the time  
  
Yeah the last of sunshine  
Oh ya know for what its worth  
Nice day for a funeral  
Yeah the last of sunshine  
Im going back to Mother Earth  
A cry of independence  
Ends in death
