Got to grab a pen and a paper  
Got to write a tiny note to you  
I cant get you out of my system  
Theres something very difficult bout you  
  
Hook  
Its possible  
When I get that feeling  
Its so revealing  
Its possible  
When youre givin that look  
I just wanna ohohoh  
  
People tell me all the wrong things  
People tell me I dont have a clue  
Theres something in the air I just know it  
Like patches on the skin it stick like glue  
  
Hook  
Is possible  
When I get that feeling  
It so revealing  
Its possible  
When youre givin that look  
I just wanna ohohoh  
  
Break  
  
The sound of your heartbeat promise so much x2  
  
Du du do do do do  
Got to write a tiny note to you  
Du do do do do do  
Theres something very difficult about you  
  
Hook  
Its possible  
When I get that feeling  
Its so revealing  
Its possible when givin me that look  
I just wanna ohohoh  
  
When I get that feeling its so revealing  
Its possible  
When youre givin that look  
I just wanna ohohoh x3
