If you obey societys rules  
You will be societys fools  
Youll obey and then disobey  
Youll disobey but then youll obey  
You thought your mom and dad were fools  
You never wanted to listen in school  
Now your mind wont go where you want to take it  
You got a ride but youre not gonna make it  
Youll never catch up  
Dad pass the catsup  
Clean that mess up Listen up  
If you obey societys fools  
Youll be societys tools  
And youll obey and then disobey  
Youll disobey but then youll obey  
You thought your mom and dad were queer  
You always wanted egg in your beer  
Now your dog wont go  
When you try to make it  
Hes got a bone but hes not gonna shake it  
If you take societys tools  
You will make societys rules  
Which youll obey and then disobey  
Youll disobey but then youll obey  
Thats all for now  
Thats all we know  
This is the end
