Verse 1  
Subjected to my system  
Reflecting on the days  
When we used to be just friends  
Protected both our interest  
Our trust was in a bank  
Thats where our hearts were safe  
  
PreChorus  
And then we got closer  
Separated from my ex  
Til we got closure  
Oh in every visit  
Feelings got stronger  
Now this is out our hands  
Our love is here to stay  
  
Chorus  
So get used to me checking in  
All day  
Get used to me falling through  
Just to see your face  
There aint a moment  
I wont need your brace  
Get used to me touching you  
Get used to me loving you  
Oh get used to it eh  
Oh get used to it eh  
Oh get used to it oh and oh  
Get used to me holding you  
Get used to me woeing you  
Oh get used to it  
  
Verse 2  
And Im a April shower you  
Forever if I May  
Til your flowers bloom in June  
Make sure that our fireworks  
Be your 4th of July  
For life  
As long as you stand right by my side  
  
PreChorus  
Keep growing closer  
Throughout October  
Oh counting down its almost Christmas Eve  
Oh seven days shy of New Years Eve  
Then well be celebrating  
  
Chorus  
So get used to me checking in  
All day  
Get used to me falling through  
Just to see your face  
There aint a moment  
I wont need your brace  
Get used to me touching you  
Get used to me loving you  
Oh get used to it eh  
Oh get used to it eh  
Oh get used to it oh and oh  
Get used to me holding you  
Get used to me woeing you  
Oh get used to it  
  
Bridge  
I aint going nowhere  
I aint going nowhere oh no  
I aint going nowhere  
I aint going nowhere oh no  
Put your faith in me  
Ill be all you need I swear  
Yeah yeah  
Im gonna be right here yeah  
  
Chorus  
So get used to me checking in  
All day  
Get used to me falling through  
Just to see your face  
There aint a moment  
I wont need your brace  
Get used to me touching you  
Get used to me loving you  
Oh get used to it eh  
Oh get used to it eh  
Oh get used to it oh and oh  
Get used to me holding you  
Get used to me woeing you

I know you getting used to it  
Oh get used to it
