Salvadori you can def  
Be my baby boo  
Need my mafiosi rock n roll high  
Back to Malibu and our  
Trailer park for two  
Were like sitting in see love gonna fight  
  
We got a jumper got a jumper  
Got a jumper got a jumper  
My mans crazy and his mind isnt right  
But I like him fact I love him  
I cant get eenough of him  
He knows only I can save him tonight  
  
Ive been waiting on your love  
Baby for too long now too long now  
I thought that I could change you  
Like the others but I dont know how  
Dont know how  
  
Its gonna backfire  
Its gonna backfire baby  
Gonna backfire  
Gonna backfire baby  
  
Told you one million times before  
Youre so much firing a million more  
  
Im tired of fighting you  
Seems like everything I do  
Even when I win I lose what you meant  
And its not something you chose  
You say trouble follows you  
Its been like that since the day you began  
  
We got a jumper got a jumper  
Got a jumper got a jumper  
I know very well youre bringing me down  
I will follow I will follow  
I will follow for a little piece of heaven  
Im ready I am willing to drown  
  
Ive been waiting on your love  
Baby for too long now too long now  
I thought that I could change you  
Like the others but I dont know how  
Dont know how  
  
Its gonna backfire  
Its gonna backfire baby  
Gonna backfire  
Gonna backfire baby  
  
Told you one million times before  
Youre so much firing a million more  
  
Youre always taking trips downtown  
Officer Browns always coming around  
Tappin on the window kids come out  
Aint no way to live when we show you how  
  
But we know were not gonna change  
Keep hustlin every night and day  
  
Ive been waiting on your love  
Baby for too long now too long now  
I thought that I could change you  
Like the others but I dont know how  
Dont know how  
  
Its gonna backfire  
Its gonna backfire baby  
Gonna backfire  
Gonna backfire baby  
  
Done it a million times before  
And I wont fire it a million more
