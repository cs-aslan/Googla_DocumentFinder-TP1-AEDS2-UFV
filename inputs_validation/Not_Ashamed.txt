budda pa pa Bow Budda pa pa pow  
Jesus ill stand  
In every curcamstance  
Ill lift up  
Your name  
To save this generation  
1 2 1 2 3 4  
  
Gotta let it show  
Let the whole world know  
What youve done in me  
Coz I am not ashamed  
I will be the light  
In the darkest night  
Everyone will see  
That I am not ashamed  
No I am not ashamed  
budda pa pa Bow Budda pa pa pow  
  
Sometimes its hard  
To know exacly what to say  
But I will stand up  
Coz you are with me all the way  
oh your with me all the way
