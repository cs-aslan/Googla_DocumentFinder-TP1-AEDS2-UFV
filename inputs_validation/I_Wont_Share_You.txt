I wont share you no  
I wont share you  
With the drive  
And ambition  
The zeal I feel  
This is my time  
  
The note I wrote  
As she read she said  
Has the Perrier gone  
Straight to my head  
Or is life sick and cruel instead  
  
Yes  
No  no  no  no  no  no  
No  no  no  no  no  no  
Oh  
  
I wont share you no  
I wont share you  
With the drive  
And the dreams inside  
This is my time  
  
Life tends to come and go  
Thats OK  
As long as you know  
Life tends to come and go  
As long as you know  
Know know know know know  
Know know know know  
Oh  
  
I wont share you no  
I wont share you  
With the drive  
And the dreams inside  
This is my time  
  
I want the freedom and I want the guile  
I want the freedom and the guile  
Oh life tends to come and go  
As long as you know  
Know know know know  
Know know know know  
Oh  
  
I wont share you no  
I wont share you  
Ill see you somewhere  
Ill see you sometime  
Darling
