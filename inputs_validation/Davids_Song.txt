Wont you let me rock and roll you baby  
I havent seen you in a long long time  
I havent fooled around with any candles lately  
Just thought you might have some music in mind  
Oh I just want to serenade you  
Maybe we could even live a verse or two  
And I could finish this old love song  
So I could start singing it to you oh  
I could start singing it to you  
If I could finish this old love song  
Then I could start singing it to you  
Wont you come and boogiewoogie with me baby  
Its been a while since I held you close to me  
I havent met many boys like you baby  
Knew I would find you eventually  
Oh I just want to serenade you  
Maybe we could even live a verse or two  
And I could finish this old love song  
So I could start singing it to you oh baby  
I could start singing it to you oh honey  
If I could finish this old love song  
Then I could start singing it to you  
If I could finish this old love song  
Then I could start singing it  
Then I could start singing it to you  
Oh to you oh to you baby you  
I said to you
