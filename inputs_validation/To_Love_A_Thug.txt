talking  
Look out man quit tripping man how you gone tell me  
To choose between you and the streets dont you know  
If I leave the motherfucking streets alone  
How are we gonna get the rent paid and the  
Motherfucking bills paid knowImsaying  
You got to cover my eyes remember  
ZRo  
Baby stay down with me through thick and thin and I promise its gonna pay
off  
Though hurts you like a sailor cause baby you need to stay soft  
You took me on a ride without no breaks to mash  
The things you do it make the average nigga hate your ass  
But I just love it when you cuss at a nigga when its all good  
In the bed when your finger nails clutching a nigga  
You said youd always be there and not to worry about a thang  
But when I started to struggle you left a nigga to hang  
What kind of shit is when you want to see your woman tonight  
On top of that there was no food phone water or lights  
I had a state be thought of suicide nobody could move it  
You took the pistol from my head when I attempted to do it  
Baby I know that I be tripping sometimes  
Its just because I never owned anything thats mine  
Understand my situation and be patient and well make it in the end  
Want you to be the first to ride around in my benz  
baby to know me is to love a thug  
  
Chorus  
Forgive me baby Im a thug  
I make all my money from selling all these drugs  
Im in it to win it and I dont want to lose  
But I slowed down my hustle cause Im digging you  
And I wont keep on hogging you  
Even though youre the only girl Im talking to  
Im in it to win it and I dont want to lose  
But if I lose you its all a part of paying dues  
ZRo  
We went from good to better better to worse then we separated  
I should of beeped you to apologize but I guess I changed  
Cause I be feeling like you wanted to end  
Dont want to be your enemy baby but I cant be your friend  
Female associates are gone miss I loved you  
And treated your kid as if he was my own kid  
So if you think I was affatuated bet one hundred seenotes  
That I show you what it is to be broke  
When I was ready to misbehave and get paid my nigga run at me now  
Knew it was peticular car cause I got you on my mind  
Even all the days of my life I want you staying with me  
But the way its been it dont get gravy until you laying with me  
Cause we be at eachothers thugs like we were crypts and bloods  
Always the first to say Im sorry grab your hips and shove  
I want to kick it but I got business to handle with my crew  
Call me later when you ready to say I do  
baby to know me is to love a thug  
Chorus  
ZRo  
Forgive me baby Im a thug what happened to all the capping  
Now that Im rich you want to greet me with kisses and hugs  
I had to stop chasing you I chose to chase my feddy  
Now I get promenade in an escallade and be low keyed in my cheve  
Now you looking like you want to curse  
Never put trust in the woman or a nigga only put trust in my verse  
Cause if it is well then Ill understand  
if you aint helping me making you could find another man  
Ill get my pen and she is number one in my state  
Got ladies looking from me head to chest then the navel  
Willing and abel to be dedicated from the heart  
Must of mistaken me for yourself thats why I cheated from the start  
Freaky in the dark baby I bet I make you cum  
And if your nigga dont like it I bet Ill make him run  
I bet these bitches be tripping over the way I run through em like socks  
Like them old niggas run through throw away glocks  
Should of known me is to love a thug  
Chorus
