When the white eagle of the North is flying overhead  
The browns reds and golds of autumn lie in the gutter dead  
Remember then that summer birds with wings of fire flaying  
Came to witness springs new hope born of leaves decaying  
Just as new life will come from death love will come at leisure  
Love of love love of life and giving without measure  
Gives in return a wondrous yearn of a promise almost seen  
Live handinhand and together well stand on the threshold of a dream
