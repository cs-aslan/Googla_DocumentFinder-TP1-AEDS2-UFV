We had a fight  
A lovers quarrel  
Angry words spoken in haste  
Deep in the night  
It went out of control  
And with tears streaming down my face  
I slammed the door and I walked out  
Swearing that we were through  
Now Im sitting in a bar  
Thinking Ive gone too far  
Wondering what Im gonna do  
Thinking about calling you  
  
Chorus  
To my left blue collar  
To my right a high dollar man  
Across the bar a smooth bartender  
Who thinks Im in the palm of his hand  
Well they buy me drinks  
Light my cigarette  
Theyre all wondering which one Im gonna choose  
Oh my hands on my glass  
My second margarita  
And my mind is on you  
My mind is on you  
  
Well I ran away  
In a moment of weakness  
I couldnt hold my own  
I should stay  
Because being together  
Means more than who was right or wrong  
And sitting in a room full of lonely faces  
Youre the only one I see  
If you only knew  
I was thinking of you  
Would you come and rescue me  
Maybe I should call and see  
  
Chorus  
  
My third margarita  
  
I should of known I could never get along  
Outside of your love  
Its last call  
And Im out of cigarettes  
They are all wondering what Im gonna do  
Oh my hands on the glass  
Its my last margarita  
And my mind is on you  
My mind is on you  
My mind is on you
