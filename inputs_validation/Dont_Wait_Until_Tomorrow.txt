Dont wait until tomorrow  
It may come too late  
Dont wait until tomorrow  
Only fools hesitate  
Take hold of every chance  
Thats offered to you  
Dont say it can wait  
  
That never will do  
Dont wait until tomorrow  
cause it wont wait for you  
Well I wonder sometimes  
What the future will be  
And all that it tells me  
Is wait and see  
  
Should I let the wind carry me  
Like a wave on the shore  
But I dont want my life  
To just pass me by  
When I think Ill grow old  
It just makes me cry  
Theres too much to do and to say  
  
And I dont have the time  
Its all a waste of time  
Dont wait until tomorrow  
The waitings no fun  
Dont wait until tomorrow  
Tomorrow never comes  
Take hold of every chance  
  
Thats offered to you  
Dont say it can wait  
That never will do  
Dont wait until tomorrow  
cause it wont wait for you  
  
And this is the time where my heart belongs  
Ive waited in this town for much too long  
Feeling like a leaf on a tree  
Im waiting to fall  
I think Ive seen it all  
Dont wait until tomorrow  
It may come too late  
  
Dont wait until tomorrow  
Only fools hesitate  
Take hold of every chance thats offered to you  
Dont say it can wait that never will do  
Dont wait until tomorrow  
cause it wont wait for tomorrow no  
Dont wait until tomorrow  
It wont wait for you  
It wont wait for you
