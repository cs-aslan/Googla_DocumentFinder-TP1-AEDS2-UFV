For so long now Im racing on in the wind  
On this road Im moving on  
I feel her heat the desert sun burning skin  
Never stopping always on the run  
Ooh forever all I want is you here by my side  
But I cant wait too long no  
Holding me is like taming the seven seas  
  
REFRAIN  
I want restless gypsy all I need  
Is to catch the wind where my hearts in  
And Im riding in the breeze  
Call me restless gypsy to the end  
Riding free  is all I need  
My spirits in the wind  
  
Move too fast no never hold me down  
Catch me if you really think you can  
Feel my touch two lovers cry that sound  
Never ever knowing who I am  
Ooh I want you closer baby dont you take too long  
Cause tomorrow Ill be gone yeah  
And holding me is like holding the seven seas  
  
REFRAIN  
  
Easy rider on the highway  
Got the wind in my hair  
Come on you can touch me where I lay  
Running free without a care  
  
Come on restless gypsy all I need  
Is to catch the wind where my hearts in  
And Im riding in the breeze  
Call me restless gypsy to the end  
Riding free  is all I need  
My spirits in the wind
