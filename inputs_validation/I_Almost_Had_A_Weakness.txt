Thank you for the flowers  
I threw them on the fire  
And I burned the photographs that you had enclosed  
God they were ugly children  
So youre the little bastard of that brother of mine  
Trying to trick a poor old woman  
Til I almost had a weakness  
  
Last week cousin Florence  
Bit your uncle Joe  
Hit him on the forehead with a knife and a fork  
she said that he looked like the devil  
Then she saidpass the vinegar Im beginning to think  
that Im the only one who hasnt taken to the drinking of it  
Though I almost had a weakness  
  
It pains me to mention  
These delicate concerns  
While I have to tolerate you family jewels  
I really mustnt grumble  
cause when I die the cats and dogs will jump up and down  
And you little swines will get nothing  
Though I almost had a weakness
