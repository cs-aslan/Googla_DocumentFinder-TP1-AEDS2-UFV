Eponine  
Dont you fret Msieur Marius  
I dont feel any pain  
A little fall of rain  
Can hardly hurt me now  
Youre here thats all I need to know  
And you will keep me safe  
And you will keep me close  
And rain will make the flowers grow  
  
Marius  
But you will live Ponine  dear God above  
If I could heal your wounds with words of love  
  
Eponine  
Just hold me now and let it be  
Shelter me comfort me  
  
Marius  
You would live  
A hundred years  
If I could show you how  
I wont desert you now  
  
Eponine  
The rain cant hurt me now  
This rain will wash away whats past  
And you will keep me safe  
And you will keep me close  
Ill sleep in your embrace at last  
The rain that brings you here  
Is Heavenblessed  
The skies begin to clear  
And Im at rest  
A breath away from where you are  
Ive come home from so far Marius in counterpoint  
So dont you fret Msieur Marius  
I dont feel any pain  
A little fall of rain  
Can hardly hurt me now  
Hushabye dear Eponine  
You wont feel any pain  
A little fall of rain  
Can hardly hurt you now  
Im here  
Thats all I need to know  
And you will keep me safe  
And you will keep me close  
And rain  
Will make the flowers I will stay with you  
Till you are sleeping  
And rain  
Will make the flowers  
Grow  
  
Eponine  
The rain cant hurt me now  
This rain will wash away whats past  
And you will keep me safe  
And you will keep me close  
Ill sleep in your embrace at last

She dies Marius kisses her then lays her on the ground  
  
Enjolras  
She is the first to fall  
The first of us to fall upon this barricade  
  
Marius  
Her name was Eponine  
Her life was cold and dark yet she was unafraid  
  
Combeferre  
We fight here in her name  
  
Prouvaire  
She will not die in vain  
  
Lesgles  
She will not be betrayed  
  
They carry her body off
