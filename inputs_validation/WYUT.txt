Back track listen stop that  
Before everything is lost again  
You lied oh why  
Stand back give is slack  
You dont know where my head is at  
Youre in too deep dont try  
  
I dont want I dont want what you up to  
I dont need I dont need what you up to  
Better step down better turn around no  
Better row out heres a bow now move  
I dont want I dont want what you up to no  
  
You grab never give back  
And think I dont think through that  
I do Im onto you  
Too far pushin your luck  
Get out its the end of the line  
For you and now youre mine  
  
I dont want I dont want what you up to  
I dont need I dont need what you up to  
Better step down better turn around go  
Better row out heres a bow now move  
I dont want I dont want what you up to no  
I dont want I dont want what you up to  
I dont want I dont want what you up to  
I dont want I dont want what you up to  
I dont want I dont want what you up to  
I dont want I dont want what you up to  
I dont want I dont want what you up to  
I dont want I dont want what you up to  
  
Stand back give it slack  
You dont know where my head is at  
I do Im onto you  
  
I dont want I dont want what you up to  
I dont need I dont need what you up to  
Better step down better turn around go  
Better row out heres a bow now move  
I dont want I dont want what you up to  
I dont want I dont want what you up to
