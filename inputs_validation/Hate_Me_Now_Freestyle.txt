feat Paul Cain  
  
Fabolous  
Yeah  
Im a motherfuckin ghetto superstar nigga  
Got my nigga Paul Cain with me  
Street dreams  
Im what street dreams are made of nigga  
Hate me now  
Do it now nigga  
Im burnin like them blue flames nigga  
They call me GHETTO  
Ghetto  
Lets do this right nigga  
What the fuck is up nigga  
These niggas cant even breathe now Cain  
  
Verse 1 Fabolous  
It wont stop till my account is in the billions  
And I buy a home on the coast of Miami and the ammounts are in the millions  
Fish tanks and flat screens mounted in the ceilings  
Sippin champagne I have trouble pronouncing while Im chillin  
Felt that you was squealin  
You gon die even if Witness Protection put you in the mountains of New
Zealand  
Cause I hire bountys that be killin  
That play HideAndGo Seek and find you after countin to a million  
But a million records later  
Theres still some speculators  
Man these labels are giving the kid meals and checks like waiters  
When I come through you never see my heels be decked in gators  
And see Jordans that dropped when you was still a second grader  
Spill the Tec on haters  
I got a quick jab  
But when I squeeze these slugsll hit you a milla second later  
I chill and check the waiter  
Dudes play gangsta for a minute but run to the cops squealing seconds later  
You still a Lexus trader  
My credit so good I drive off in the sc and tell the dealer Catch ya later  
All I need is one night I dont deal with second daters  
Cause the white and gold stones on the grill and neck persuade her nigga  
  
Paul Cain  
Yeah  
Yo Fab  
We done pulled the Range out  
The Benz out  
The Caddy truck out  
They aint even see the 128 yet  
These niggas still hatin  
  
Verse 2 Paul Cain  
Ever since I got signed it seems like yall been hatin on the god  
We never held a conversation but you claimin Im a fraud  
Started bringin weight up while I starve  
Gained some cash and the ego now ya perpetrating like ya hard  
If you thinkin you Pac Im a wait in front of Quad  
Have my Kingston bullets through ya face like Im Bernard  
Ya like beef but hate when Im involved  
Cause I dont give ya a chance ta dodge bullets from the 8 when it revolve  
Niggas love when you broke but they hate when you get large  
Wait for you to slip and try to find a way to get you robbed  
Run in ya crib and duck tape you and ya broad  
And dont leave prints so jakes never get the case resolved  
So I play against the odds  
When its all set two niggas with two 40s a peice retaliatin on ya squad  
If you get locked my Haitianll leave you scarred  
Rape you in the yard  
With Gem Star blades cut ya face like a collage  
While I sip champagne in the Vegas lamatage  
In the suite with two freaks videotapin a manage  
Ice in the chain a face in the shepard  
Million dollar crib with a cranberry quarter and a 8 in the garage nigga  
  
Paul Cain  
Yall niggas  
Yall niggas only seen half  
This is just the begining man  
See yall niggas was hatin now man  
Yall niggas gonna be sick to your stomach bending over throwin up  
When yall see the shit we got comin  
My album aint even drop yet man  
And yall niggas talkin crazy  
Man Paul Cain nigga  
The album comin fourth quarter  
Yall motherfuckers is under pressure nigga  
Desert Storm slk we killin everything movin nigga  
Yeah
