Well well well  
Just because you think youre so pretty  
And just because your momma thinks youre hot  
Well just because you think youve got something  
That no other girl has got  
Youve caused me to spend all my money  
You laughed and called me old Santa Claus  
Well Im telling you  
Baby Im through with you  
Because well well just because  
  
Well well well  
Therell come a time when youll be lonesome  
And therell come a time when youll be blue  
Well therell come a time when old Santa  
He wont pay your bills for you  
  
Youve caused me to lose all my women  
And now now you say we are through  
Well Im telling you  
Baby I was through with you  
A long long time ago  
  
Well just because you think youre so pretty  
And just because your mama thinks youre the hottest thing in town  
Well just because you think youve got something  
That nobody else has got  
Youve caused me to spend all of my money  
Honey you laughed and called me your old Santa Claus  
Well Im telling you Im through with you  
Because well well just because
