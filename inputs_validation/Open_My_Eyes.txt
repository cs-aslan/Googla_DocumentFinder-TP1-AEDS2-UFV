All I want is written on my face  
Youe bound to find something  
And all your words that held me into place  
Were nothing but lies  
Another time I might have watched the things I said  
But I cant see  
Somebody  
Open my eyes for a little while little while  
Make me forget all the things I see  
Til then til then dont know what Ill see  
Til then til then dont care what Ill see  
Ill stand and stare until I go blind  
Will you open my eyes  
Dont mind me  
You know me inside out  
Thats the way that you left me  
And you wont find me  
Begging for a chance  
To have you burn me again  
Another time I might have watched the things I said  
But I cant see  
Somebody  
Open my eyes for a little while little while  
Make me forget all the things I see  
Til then til then dont know what Ill see  
Til then til then dont care what Ill see  
Ill stand and stare until I go blind  
Will you open my eyes  
Another time I might have watched the things I said  
Another place you might have left me here for dead  
Another time  
Somebody  
Open my eyes for a little while little while  
Make me forget all the things I see  
Til then til then dont know what Ill see  
Til then til then dont care what Ill see  
Ill stand and stare until I go blind  
Will you open my eyes  
Open my eyes
