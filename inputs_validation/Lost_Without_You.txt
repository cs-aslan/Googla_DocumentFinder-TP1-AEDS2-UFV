Never thought that it would be this way without you  
Its taking all I have just to live from day to day  
My heart aches for you I cant believe were through  
Oh baby I miss you  
  
Chorus  
Im lost Im lost without you baby  
The days arent the same the nights are cold and gray  
I need you in my life  
If not now then someday  
  
As I think about the time weve shared together  
The way I feel for you I know Ill never feel again  
Memories of loving you still linger in my head  
Oh baby I miss you  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a feeling deep inside of me  
That just wont let you go  
And the more I try to fight it  
The more it seems to showcant let you go  
  
Chorus  
  
Im lost without you baby  
The days arent the same the nights are cold and gray  
I need you right now  
Uh If not now maybe someday
