Woman I have to leave you  
I cant stay where there is no pay  
And I dont care where Im goin to  
Its been so long since Ive been gone  
Lord Im tired and I want to go home  
My throat is raw from singing the blues  
  
Need all my friends to talk to  
Now yes I do  
Need all my friends to talk to  
  
Im gonna search around until I find a friend  
Who will believe in me for what I am  
Sing my song til it hurts  
  
Play my music til I hit pay dirt  
Now Ive got to sing my song  
Play my music do the things I love  
  
Its been so long since Ive been gone  
Lord Im tired and I want to go home  
My throat is raw from singing the blues  
  
Need all my friends to talk to  
Now yes I do  
Need all my friends to talk to
