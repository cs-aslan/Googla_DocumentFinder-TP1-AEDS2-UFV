I got an invitation from a girl I used to know back home  
It was an invitation asking me to telephone  
She said its getting lonely here  
And Ive been gone for close a year  
I took the first flight out to meet the girl I used to know back home  
  
She met me off the flight a million dollars in her long red gown  
With a man in a black hat just to drive us back to town  
Now the faces all look the same  
And all the places have the same old names  
But in a year youve changed just like the girl I used to know back home  
Yes in a year youve changed just like the girl I used to know back home  
  
Maybe its true that I go on and on and on  
Maybe its true that Im the lonely one alone  
What can I say to you what can I say to you  
Yes in a year youve changed just like the girl I used to know back home  
  
It took another year before I started getting itchy toes  
And then I had to leave but thats the way the story goes  
Well I reckon if shed made me stay  
Id never live to see another day  
I took the first flight out and left the girl I used to know back home  
  
Maybe its true that I go on and on and on  
Maybe its true that Im the lonely one alone  
What can I say to you what can I say to you  
I took the first flight out and left the girl I used to know back home  
Back home I left the girl back home  
I left the girl back home  
I left the girl back home
