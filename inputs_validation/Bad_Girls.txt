Bad girls  
Talking about the sad girls  
Sad girls  
Talking about bad girls yeah  
  
See them out on the street at night walkin  
Picking up on all kinds of strangers  
If the price is right  
You cant score if youre pockets tight  
But you want a good time  
  
You ask yourself who they are  
Like everybody else they come from near and far  
  
Bad girls  
Talking about the sad girls  
Sad girls  
Talking about bad girls yeah  
  
Friday night and the strip is hot  
Suns gone down and theyre out to trot  
Spirits high and legs look hot  
Do you want to get down  
  
Now dont you ask yourself who they are  
Like everybody else they want to be a star  
  
Now you and me were both the same  
But you call yourself by different names  
Now your mama wont like it when she finds out  
Girl is out at night  
  
Hey mister have you got a dime  
Mister do you want to spend some time Oh yeah  
I got what you want you got what I need  
Ill be your baby come and spend it on me  
  
Hey mister Ill spend some time with you
