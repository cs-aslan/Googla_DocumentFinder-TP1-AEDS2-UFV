Some boys with warm beds and cold cold hearts  
Can make you feel nothing at all  
Theyll never remember and theyll never mind  
If youre counting the cracks in the wall  
Theyre quick and theyre greedy  
They never feel guilty  
They dont know the meaning of hurt  
The boots just go back on  
The socks that had stayed on  
The next time they see you  
They treat you like dirt  
The next time they treat you like dirt  
Now dont come the cowboy with me sonny jim  
I know lots of those and youre not one of them  
Theres a light in your eyes tells me somebodys in  
And you wont come the cowboy with me  
Dont be too rough on my cold cold heart  
Its all Ive got left to me now  
I fell out of favour with heaven somewhere  
And Im here for the hell of it now  
Some girls play cowboys  
And some boys play harder to get  
But theyre got just the same  
They smile and say cheese  
Theyre so eager to please  
But theyll never remember your name  
The names and the places all change  
But dont come the cowboy with me sonny jim  
I know lots of those and youre not one of them  
Theres a light in your eyes tells me somebodys in  
And you wont come the cowboy with me  
Did somebody tell you Im lonely as hell  
I didnt expect you to know me so well  
If I learned a lesson its how to bounce back again  
Sometimes I bounce off the wall  
And sometimes my head hits the floor  
So dont come the cowboy with me sonny jim  
I know lots of those and youre not one of them  
Theres a light in your eyes tells me somebodys in  
And you wont come the cowboy oh  
Dont come the cowboy with me sonny jim  
I know lots of those and youre not one of them  
Theres a light in your eyes tells me somebodys in  
And you wont come the cowboy with me
