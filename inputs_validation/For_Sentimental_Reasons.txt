I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me  
Ive given you my heart  
I love you and you alone were meant for me  
Please give your loving heart to me  
And say well never ever part  
I think of you every morning  
Dream of you every night  
Darling Im never lonely  
Whenever you are in sight  
All because I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me baby  
Ive given you my heart  
Instrumental interlude  
I think of you every morning  
Dream of you every night  
Darling Im never lonely  
Whenever whenever whenever you are in sight  
All because I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me  
Ive given you my heart  
Ive given you my heart  
For sentimental reasons  
Ive given you my heart
