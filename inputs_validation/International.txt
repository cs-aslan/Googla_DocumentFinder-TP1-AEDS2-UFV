The youth and the imperialist tribune was also addressed by a young girl  
From nicaragua whose hands had been cut off at the wrists by the former  
Samosa guards  
Veronica merco of the german federal republic had this to say  
  
Aber ich habe eine ausbildung gemacht  
Ak industrie kaufmann und    
  
Im a shop assistant at the    
And I must say Im a shop assistant by profession  
But it is difficult for    
  
Now and then a little thing gets by  
Now and then well cry  
  
Like a fall in a war like a mothers open arms  
Like a pawn in a game hard to take  
There we sit on a line wasting fortunes at a time and pray  
  
All the time we are gone theres no reason theres no way  
Oh the soul is the one so they say  
There we sit on a line wasting fortunes at a time and play  
  
She never thought hed be this way  
Her arms aloft she holds  
But now its all a memory  
And its gone
