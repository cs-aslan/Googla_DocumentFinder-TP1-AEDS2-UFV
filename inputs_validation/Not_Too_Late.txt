Tell me how youve been  
Tell what youve seen  
Tell me that youd like to see me too  
  
Cause my heart is full of no blood  
My cup is full of no love  
Couldnt take another sip even if I wanted  
  
But its not too late  
Not too late for love  
  
My lungs are out of air  
Yours are holding smoke  
And its been like that for so long  
  
Ive seen people try to change  
And I know it isnt easy  
But nothin worth the time ever is  
  
And its not too late  
Its not too late for love  
For love  
For love  
For love
