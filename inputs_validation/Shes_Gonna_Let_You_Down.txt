Were afraid shes gonna let you down  
Take your money and drop you to the ground  
Wouldnt want to see you messed around  
After all the love you think youve found  
Shes gonna let you down  
  
Doesnt matter what we say  
Loves the stubbornest game to play  
Given time you might see it our way  
And well be sorry boy until that day  
Shes gonna break away  
  
Remember all the times you helped us through  
Now heres our chance to do the same for you  
Guess the thing to do is wait around  
Lend a hand when you are on the ground  
Shes gonna let you down  
Shes gonna let you down  
Shes gonna let you down
