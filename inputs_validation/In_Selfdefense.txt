The situations got me rattled  
I twist and turn late at night  
This whole worlds up in shambles  
Whos the one to make it right  
  
Missing persons lost in action action  
Forgotten victims of the night victims of the night  
Theyre making crime the main attraction attraction  
Theyre making everyone uptight  
Theyre all looking for a fight  
  
In this confusion from day to day  
Sometimes fear just makes no sense  
In this crossfire I see one way  
In self defense  
  
Youll take your chances Mr Policeman policeman  
Youre like a cat with thirteen lives cat with thirteen lives  
Your law and order is our lifeline lifeline  
Through the danger youll survive  
I do what I need to stay alive  
  
In this confusion from day to day  
Sometimes fear just makes no sense  
In this crossfire I see one way  
In self defense  
  
In self self defense  
In self self defense  
  
In this confusion from day to day  
Sometimes fear just makes no sense  
In this crossfire I see one way  
In self defense
