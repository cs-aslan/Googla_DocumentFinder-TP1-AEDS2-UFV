I think Im sophisticated cause Im living my life  
Like a good homo sapiens  
But all around me everybodys multiplying and  
Theyre walking round like flies man  
So Im no better than the animals sitting  
In the cages in the zoo man  
Cause compared to the flowers and the birds and the trees  
I am an apeman  
  
I think Im so educated and Im so civilized  
Cause Im a strict vegetarian  
But with the overpopulation and inflation and starvation  
And the crazy politicians  
I dont feel safe in this world no more  
I dont want to die in a nuclear war  
I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an apeman  
  
Im an apeman Im an ape apeman oh Im an apeman  
Im a King Kong man Im a voodoo man oh Im an apeman  
Cause compared to the sun that sits in the sky  
Compared to the clouds as they roll by  
Compared to the bugs and the spiders and flies I am an apeman  
  
In mans evolution hes created the city  
And the motor traffic rumble  
But give me half a chance and Id be taking off my clothes  
And living in the jungle  
Cause the only time that I feel at ease  
Is swinging up and down in the coconut trees  
Oh what a life of luxury to be like an apeman  
  
Im an apeman Im an ape apeman oh Im an apeman  
Im a King Kong man Im a voodoo man oh Im an apeman  
I look out the window but I cant see the sky  
The air pollution is afucking up my eyes  
I want to get out of this city alive and make like an apeman  
  
Oh come on and love me be my apeman girl  
And well be so happy in my apeman world  
  
Im an apeman Im an ape apeman oh Im an apeman  
Im a King Kong man Im a voodoo man oh Im an apeman  
Ill be your Tarzan youll be my Jane  
Ill keep you warm and youll keep me sane  
Well sit in the trees and eat bananas all day just like an apeman  
  
Im an apeman Im an ape apeman oh Im an apeman  
Im a King Kong man Im a voodoo man oh Im an apeman  
I dont feel safe in this world no more  
I dont want to die in a nuclear war  
I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an apeman
