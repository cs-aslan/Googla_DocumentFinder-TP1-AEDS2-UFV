Verse 1  
I got this feeling inside my bones  
It goes electric wavy when I turn it on  
All through my city all through my home  
Were flying up no ceiling when we in our zone  
  
PreChorus  
I got that sunshine in my pocket  
Got that good song in my feet  
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops  
I cant take my eyes up off it moving so phenomenally  
You gon like the way we rock it so dont stop  
  
Chorus  
Under the lights when everything goes  
Nowhere to hide when Im getting you close  
When we move well you already know  
So just imagine just imagine just imagine  
Nothing I can see but you when you dance dance dance  
Feeling good good creeping up on you  
So just dance dance dance come on  
All those things I should do to you  
But you dance dance dance  
And aint nobody leaving soon so keep dancing  
  
PostChorus 1  
I cant stop the feeling  
So just dance dance dance  
I cant stop the feeling  
So just dance dance dance come on  
  
Verse 2  
Ooh its something magical  
Its in the air its in my blood its rushing on  
I dont need no reason dont need control  
I fly so high no ceiling when Im in my zone  
  
PreChorus  
Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket  
Got that good song in my feet  
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops  
I cant take my eyes up off it moving so phenomenally  
You gon like the way we rock it so dont stop  
  
Chorus  
Under the lights when everything goes  
Nowhere to hide when Im getting you close  
When we move well you already know  
So just imagine just imagine just imagine  
Nothing I can see but you when you dance dance dance  
Feeling good good creeping up on you
