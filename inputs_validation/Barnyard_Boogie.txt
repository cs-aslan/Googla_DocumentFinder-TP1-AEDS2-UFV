Oink oink  
Moo moo

Qqquack Qqquack  
Peep peep Peep peep  
Peep peep said the chick in the barnyard pen  
Quack quack said the duck wont you let me in  
Cluck cluck cluck said the little red hen  
Lets boogie in the barnyard  
Baa baa said the sheep from another bowl  
Moo moo said the cow let the butter roll  
Cluck cluck cluck said the little red hen  
Lets boogie in the barnyard  
Yes the barnyard was jumpin  
Everybody havin their fling  
Even Old MacDonald  
Had to do a little kind o swing  
Bow wow said the dog in the circus top  
Miaow said the cat now please dont stop  
Cluck cluck cluck said the little red hen  
Lets boogie in the barnyard  
Yes even Uncle Ezra  
Got caught with a dozen eggs  
I saw Aunt Suzey  
Kill the chicken with the bandy leg  
Bow wow bow wow  
Miaow miaow  
Cluck cluck cluck cluck said the little red hen  
Lets boogie in the barnyard  
Peep peep quack quack  
Cluck cluck moo moo  
Bow wow Miaow
