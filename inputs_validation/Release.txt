I see the world  
Feel the chill  
Which way to go  
Windowsill  
I see the words  
  
On a rocking horse of time  
I see the birds in the rain  
Oh dear dad  
Can you see me now  
I am myself  
  
Like you somehow  
Ill ride the wave  
Where it takes me  
Ill hold the pain  
Release me  
  
Oh dear dad  
Can you see me now  
I am myself  
Like you somehow  
  
Ill wait up in the dark  
For you to speak to me  
Ill open up  
Release me  
Release me  
Release me  
Release me
