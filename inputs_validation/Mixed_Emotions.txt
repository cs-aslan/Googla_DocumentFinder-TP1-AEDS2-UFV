Ill be on the next train  
See you at dawn  
A picture of us in the rain  
Look and its gone  
  
Do you want my love or do want something I cant give you  
How can I be sure that what you said before had been true  
  
Auh hah hah Will we ever Be the same  
Auh hah hah Will we ever  
  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere  
  
Looking at the red red sky thinking it through  
TwentySeven days and nights since I saw you  
Am I just a fool for wanting all of your attention  
So tell me if Im right or heading in the wrong direction  
  
Auh hah hah Will we ever Be the same  
Auh hah hah Will we ever  
  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere  
  
Dont leave me with these mixed emotions and dreaming of you  
Are you out there somewhere  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Hope you are out there somewhere  
  
Is our love Is our love an illusion Will it fly away  
Is our love Is our love an illusion Watch it fly away  
Its all of its all of an illusion 4x  
  
Auh hah hah 2x  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere  
Dont leave me with these mixed emotions and dreaming of you  
Are you out there somewhere  
Dont leave me with these mixed emotions and dreaming of you  
Are you out there somewhere  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere  
Auh hah hah
