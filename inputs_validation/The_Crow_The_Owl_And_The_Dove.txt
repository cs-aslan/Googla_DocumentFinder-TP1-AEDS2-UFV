Dont give me love dont give me faith  
Wisdom not pride give innocence instead Dont give me love Ive had my
share Beauty not rest give me truth instead A crow flew to me kept its
distance Such a proud creation I saw its soul envied its pride But
needed nothing it had An owl came to me old and wise Pierced right through
my youth I learned its ways envied its sense  
But needed nothing it had  
Dont give me love dont give me faith  
Wisdom not pride give innocence instead  
Dont give me love Ive had my share Beauty not rest give me truth instead
A dove came to me had no fear It rested on my arm I touched its calm
envied its love  
But needed nothing it had  
A swan of white she came to me The lake mirrored her beauty sweet I kissed
her neck adored her grace But needed nothing she could give  
Got to grieve her got to wreck it  
Got to grieve her got to wreck it  
Got to grieve her got to wreck it  
Got to grieve her got to wreck it  
Got to grieve her got to wreck it  
Got to grieve her got to wreck it  
Dont give me love dont give me faith  
Wisdom not pride give innocence instead Dont give me love Ive had my
share Beauty not rest give me truth instead  
Dont give me love dont give me faith  
Wisdom not pride give innocence instead Dont give me love Ive had my
share Beauty not rest give me truth instead  
Dont give me love dont give me faith  
Wisdom not pride give innocence instead Dont give me love Ive had my
share Beauty not rest give me truth instead
