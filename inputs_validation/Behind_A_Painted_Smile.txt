Whenever youre near I hide my tears  
Behind a painted smile  
You cant imagine the tears and sorrow  
Behind a painted smile  
  
My lifes a masquerade  
A world of lets pretend yeah  
Since you took your love  
Pretending never ends yeah  
  
But I cant let you know  
That I still need you so no  
  
Darling I hide the tears that I cry  
Whenever youre near I hide my tears  
Behind a painted smile  
You cant imagine the tears and sorrow  
Behind a painted smile  
  
I cant let you see  
All the tears Im crying  
You would pity me  
That would be like dying  
  
If I cant have your love  
I dont need your sympathy  
  
Darling I hide the tears that I cry  
Whenever youre near I hide my tears  
Behind a painted smile  
You cant imagine the tears and sorrow  
Behind a painted smile  
  
My life is a masquerade  
Since you took your love away  
  
I just cant let you see  
How much you hurting me  
  
Whenever youre near I hide my tears  
Behind a painted smile
