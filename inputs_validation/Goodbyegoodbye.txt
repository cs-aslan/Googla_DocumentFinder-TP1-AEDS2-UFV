Oh I know something  
About the ways of loving  
And I tell you baby  
That somethings wrong  
Look to the sky above and the mud below  
Something drives me crazy got to got to get away  
Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye  
Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye  
  
Without a doubt Im telling you Im burnt out  
My tank is running on empty for far too long  
Woah I need fuel cause Im getting so low  
Something drives me crazy got to got to get away  
Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye  
Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye  
  
I need fuel just the kind you give me  
Makes me feel so bad  
Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye  
Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye  
  
I cant believe  
Im still around  
Its getting kinda late  
Gonna leave  
For a change of scenery  
Im going crazy  
Its not the same  
Since youve been around  
  
Im crazy so crazy  
You treat me like a dirty clown  
Youre always kickin my dog around  
I never get nothin but constant abuse from you  
You couldnt care less what I think or my point of view  
  
Youre always puttin the make on my friends always giving  
Them eyes and the dirty lies bout me and you well Im  
Through its the end of the line for you babe heres a  
Ticket one way Cincinnati Im sendin you home to your ma  
And your daddy so dont try to call me youll only be wastin your  
Time  
  
Oh I know something  
About the ways of loving  
And I tell you baby  
That somethings wrong  
Look to the sky above and the mud below  
Something drives me crazy got to got to get away  
Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye  
Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye
