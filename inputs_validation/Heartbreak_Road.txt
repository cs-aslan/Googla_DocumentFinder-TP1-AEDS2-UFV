Wonder who is it waiting for me  
At the end of heartbreak road  
Hope that shell be tender  
Someone I can know  
  
Hope it just dont  
Dont last forever  
But its a lonely road  
Road that we all must travel  
Once before we go  
  
I believe that loves a good teacher  
When youre in it  
Even if it dont work out  
  
You aint gonna never understand it  
Getting all done it  
Hey hey Lord and find out  
What its all about  
  
Thats all right cause  
Heartache just dont  
Dont last forever  
But its a lonely road  
Road that we all must travel  
Once before we go  
  
I believe that loves a good teacher  
And even if it dont work out  
You aint gonna never understand it  
Till you been all down in it  
And find out what its all about  
  
Thats all right cause  
Heartache just dont  
Dont last forever  
But its a lonely road  
Road that we all must travel  
Once before we go
