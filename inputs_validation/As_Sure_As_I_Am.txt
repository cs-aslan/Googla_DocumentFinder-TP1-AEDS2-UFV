Make your decision now  
Rely on no help from above  
Living is luxury  
I want everything you throw out  
Ill do anything you want to  
  
Please let me go with you  
Ill wear the smile on your face  
Big black and beautiful  
I want it everything you throw out  
There must be something you can do with out  
Cause I am as sure as I am  
  
I couldnt care less  
For what might go wrong  
And Im as happy as sin  
In a fear shaken world  
  
I pity the rhino  
Down there its becoming extinct  
Killed for a love potion  
Sad thing looking like a dead flower  
I want it everything that you throw out  
Cause I am as sure as I am  
  
I couldnt care less  
For what might go wrong  
And Im as happy as sin  
In a fear shaken world  
  
Dont want to be there  
Dont want to be spared  
Ill wear the smile on your face  
I am as sure as I am  
  
I couldnt care less  
For what might go wrong  
And Im as happy as sin  
In a fear shaken world world  
Couldnt care less
