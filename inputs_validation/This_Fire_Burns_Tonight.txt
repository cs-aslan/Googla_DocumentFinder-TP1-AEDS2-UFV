White lines on the highway  
Rolling out into the night  
Got no bag to slow us down  
Were travelling light travelling light tonight  
  
Feel the wheels roll away  
How many miles have i been gone  
Listen girl you never knew  
The road goes on all night long  
  
Chorus  
This fire burns tonight  
The streets are alight  
Out on this town we are bursting  
This fire burns tonight  
The streets are alight  
And out on this town we are bursting  
  
Now me and my partners are moving  
We run on from town to town  
And this here road surface  
Is setting them up rolling them down  
Theres girls out in the neon  
Singing blues every night  
And you that theyll never love you  
Theyre travelling light travelling light  
  
Chorus x3
