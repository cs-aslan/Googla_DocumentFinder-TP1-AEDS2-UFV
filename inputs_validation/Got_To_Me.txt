Love is the liar that no one can blame  
Everyone knows how it feels  
All of us given to lose or to gain  
So I wont question your reasons for keeping me  
Keeping me here now its late  
Taking your time making sure of mine  
Looking for something to say  
That would further your nervous design  
Wish I could tell you that I feel the same  
And its keeping me here now its late  
I believe you got to me and you know it  
I believe you wont let go  
I believe you got to me  
I know that you feel it too  
Got to me got to you  
Looking at you sitting looking at me  
Feeling the night slip away  
To the morning away to the day  
Let it stay sleeping nothing can keep me  
Away from you now that its late  
I believe you got to me and you know it  
I believe you wont let go  
I believe you got to me can you show it  
If you can then he has to know  
I believe you got to me  
I know that you feel it too  
Got to me got to you
