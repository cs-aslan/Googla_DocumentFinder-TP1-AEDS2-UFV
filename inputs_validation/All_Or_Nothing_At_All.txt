All or nothing at all  
Half love never appealed to me  
If your heart never could yield to me  
Then Id rather have nothing at all  
  
All or nothing at all  
If its love there is no in between  
Why begin then cry for something that might have been  
No I rather have nothing at all  
But please dont bring your lips so close to my cheek  
Dont smile or Ill be lost beyond recall  
The kiss in your eyes the touch of your hand makes me weak  
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall  
And if I fell under the spell of your call  
I would be caught in the undertow  
So you see Ive got to say  
No no  
All or nothing at all
