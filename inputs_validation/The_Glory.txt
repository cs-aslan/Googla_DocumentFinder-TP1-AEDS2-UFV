Gonna take you to the glory oh I cant study war  
Now where the south side now where the west side  
  
Can I talk my shit again  
Even if I dont hit again  
Dog are you fucking kidding  
My hat my shoes my coat  
Louis Vuitton stitch with Donatella Versace  
Thats Louis Vuittons bitch  
I think Hennessy I drank Im gone  
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona Im zoning  
Class back in session so I upped it a grade  
Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade  
And hey please dont start me  
Im like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley  
Im pop the Barkers Im hood the Parkers  
While yall was in limbo I raised the bar up  
I touched on everything  
Married to the game rocachain instead of a wedding ring  
Yall bridesmaids catch the garter  
On nights when Ye romance  
Cameras flash so much  
That I gotta do that Yayo dance  
Im on a world tour with Common my man  
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van its easy  
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy  
And oh yeah Yeezy  
I did it for the glory  
  
Now where the south side now where the west side  
  
What am I supposed to do now  
Man the game all messed up  
How Im suppose to stand out when everyone get dressed up  
So yeah at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta  
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido  
But with my ego  
I can stand there in a speedo  
And be looked at like a fucking hero  
The glory the story the chain the polo the night  
The grind the empty bottles of nodoze  
Tank on empty whipping my mammas Volvo  
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos  
The fur is Hermes shit that you dont floss  
The Goyard so hard man Im Hugos boss  
Why I gotta ask what that twodoor cost  
House on the hill  
Two doors from Tracey Ross  
And Im asking about her girlfriends  
Yeah the dark skinny ones  
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented em  
When you meet me in person what do you feel like  
I know I know I look better in real life  
O hear people compare themselves to big a lot  
You know BIG and Pac you know to get it hot  
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG  
Anyone Big Pun Big L or Notorious fit in  
Get money and stunt and stay glorious  
And Im gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit  
  
Now where the south side now where the west side  
  
Yeah Ima stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit  
These haters be killing themselves they wanna come and get the glory
