Many years have passed it seems  
And I am all alone  
Ive sent the children far away  
To some obscure unknown  
  
Chorus x2  
Its so sad  
So sad  
Close another door  
Listen to my eyes  
Close another door  
Youre much too old to work  
So wont you run away  
  
When I was young I used to say  
That age wont bother me  
The life I had was very sad  
It all went out to sea  
  
Chorus  
  
And though the sun is in outside  
The rain is in my hair  
Now my life is lived inside  
Now all my life is mystified  
My home is in my chair  
  
Chorus  
  
Let me go  
Send me flowers and  
Put me on a plane  
Ive paid before  
  
So Ive been told  
At least Im alive  
  
I may be old but Ive been told at least Im still alive  
Fly me young fly and tomorrow yeah  
Get me up  
I been working so so very hard
