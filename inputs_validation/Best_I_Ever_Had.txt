So you sailed away  
Into a gray sky morning  
Now Im here to stay  
Love can be so boring  
Nothing quite the same now  
I just say your name now  
  
But its not so bad  
Youre only the best  
I ever had  
You dont want me back  
Youre just the best  
I ever had  
  
So you stole my world  
Now Im just a phony  
Remembering the girl  
Leaves me down and lonely  
Sending in the weather  
Make yourself feel better  
  
But its not so bad  
Youre only the best  
I ever had  
You dont need me back  
Youre just the best  
I ever had  
  
And it may take some time  
To patch me up inside  
But I cant take it  
So I run away and hide  
And I may find in time  
That you were always right  
Youre always right  
  
So you sailed away  
Into a gray sky morning  
Now Im here to stay  
Love can be so boring  
What was it you wanted  
Could it be youre haunted  
  
But its not so bad  
Youre only the best  
I ever had  
I dont want you back  
Youre just the best  
I ever had  
  
The best I ever had  
Best I ever had
