You have eyes that lead me on  
And a body that shows me death  
Your lips look like they were made  
For something else but they just suck my breath  
I want your pain to taste why youre ashamed  
And I know youre not just what you say to me  
And Im not the only moment youre made of  
  
Chorus  
Youre so sudden and sweet on your legs knockin knees  
Heads blown clean off your mouth paid off  
Fuck me till we know its unsafe  
And well paint over the evidence  
  
Want you wanting me  
Want what I see in your eyes  
So give me something to be scared of  
Dont give me something to satisfy  
  
Chorus  
  
I want your pain to taste why youre ashamed  
And I know youre not just what you say to me  
And Im not the only moment youre made of
