Youve been out again tonight  
With the girls out on the town  
But in those magic neon lights  
I know exactly what you found  
What about your home  
And the man who loves you so  
Is it worth the thrill you feel down on neon row  
  
If youre lonely then your easy  
Them good ol boys just pick and choose  
And lonely women are in season  
A one night stands an all night lose  
And all those lonely highheeled ladies  
Are always putting on a show  
But in the morning putting on coffee  
And putting back on the clothes they wore the night before  
To neon row  
  
Girl I cant hold you back  
Not one day longer  
If my love aint strong enough  
To keep you home  
Just start the fire  
To burn the bridges  
And maybe some night will lead in the magic light  
Down on neon row  
  
If youre lonely then your easy  
Them good ol boys just pick and choose  
And lonely women are in season  
A one night stands an all night lose  
And all those lonely highheeled ladies  
Are always putting on a show  
But in the morning putting on coffee  
And putting back on the clothes they wore the night before  
To neon row  
  
And putting back on the clothes they wore the night before  
To neon row
