E Im praying for the day when the A whole wide world can say  
That this E cruel war it is B7 Oer  
And the E boys who are gone start their A long journey home  
Oh Im E praying for the B7 day when peace will E come  
When the black clouds roll away and the skies are bright and gay  
And the guns are silent once more  
And the bombs no longer fly from the planes up in the sky  
Oh Im praying for the day when peace will come  
Oh theres mother and dad dont you know theyll be so glad  
To see their sons coming home  
This old world will rock with joy for that freedom loving boy  
Oh Im praying for the day when peace will come  
Sweethearts and wives so dear who have waited for that year  
For their loved ones to return  
This old world will be so gay on that great and happy day  
Oh Im praying for the day when peace will come
