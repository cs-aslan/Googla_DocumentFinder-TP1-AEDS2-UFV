Roxie  
Sometimes Im right  
Sometimes Im wrong  
But he doesnt care  
Hell string along  
He loves me so  
That funny honey of mine  
Sometimes Im down  
Sometimes Im up  
But he follows round  
Like some droopyeyed pup  
He loves me so  
That funny honey of mine  
  
He aint no sheik  
Thats no great physique  
Lord knows he aint got the smarts  
  
But look at that soul  
I tell you that whole  
Is a whole lot greater  
Than the sum of his parts  
  
And if you knew him like me  
I know youd agree  
  
What if the world  
Slandered my name  
Why hed be right there  
Taking the blame  
  
He loves me so  
And it all suits me fine  
That funny sunny honey  
Hubby of mine

Now hes shot of his trap  
I cant stand that  
Sap  
  
Look at him go  
rattin on me  
With just one more  
Brain  
What a halfwit  
Hed be  
  
If they string me  
Up  
Ill know who  
Brought the  
Twine  
  
That scummy  
Crummy  
Dummy hubby of  
Mine
