One day away from you Im feeling  
Something new  
The way you look at me says everything  
Its much too late to hide whats building up inside  
Hot blood is rushing through my heart and soul  
  
Chorus  
Love is the strongest emotion  
No one can stop what we do  
Love is the strongest emotion  
That youll ever feel when your love is real  
  
Ive been awake all night my eyes are open wide  
I never dreamed you youre no fantasy  
Oh dont make me wait too long  
Cause youre the only one girl you change my  
Wishes to reality  
  
Chorus  
  
And I want to touch and I want to feel  
What you do to me  
Cause nothing on Earth can move me like you  
Come on baby show me cause I need to give my  
Love to you  
  
I want to touch and I want to feel  
What you do to me  
Cause nothing on Earth can move me like you  
Come on baby show me cause I need to  
Give my love  
  
Love is the strongest emotion  
No one can stop what we do  
Love is the strongest emotion  
That youll ever feel when you know  
Your love is real
