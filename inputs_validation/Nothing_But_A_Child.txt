Nothing but a Child Glass upon me walking on the ocean  
Sun upon me walking on a wave  
You can slide like the lord above Youre a beam of teaming motion  
But for everyone you do  
Theres always one or two like me you cant save  
Sail on Maria burn her to the ground  
Slide your hand between her tears until she comes  
Wake up her mother tell her Youre sorry now  
All gods children walk before they run  
Everything is beautiful in dreamland  
Everything is much much better when were gone  
Think Im going to write myself a letter  
Something you can keep with you forever  
Because everybody gets to be perfect when theyre gone  
Nothing but a child baby  
Nothing but a child baby  
Nothing but a child baby  
In Youre arms I am
