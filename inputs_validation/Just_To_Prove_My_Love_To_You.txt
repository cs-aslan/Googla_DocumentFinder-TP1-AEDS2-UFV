I could walk across kansas in A new york minute  
Climb the colorado mountains in the fall  
Crawl through arizona like A flat land lizard  
If I thought itd do me any good at all  
I could swim lake erie with my hands tied behind me  
Eat A west virginia coal miners shoes  
Drink the mississippi river if it took A month of sundays  
Just to prove my love to you  
  
Chorus  
I remember well the first time I kissed you  
Cuss things aint been the same ever since  
You got me thinkin I could eat A tenPenny nail  
And spit out A barbed wire fence  
Well there aint A living creature gonna ever come between us  
I fight lions snakes and gorillas too  
If that aint enough Id start it all over  
Just to prove my love to you  
  
I could ride my pony through the eye of A hurricane  
Climb mount everest on A string  
Jump niagara falls in A burnin barrel  
And bring ya back A hoop smoke ring  
Wrestle alligators in the okefenokee  
Theres nothin that I wouldnt do  
If you just say the word  
Id catch that great speckled bird  
And bring it back to you  
  
Chorus  
I remember well the first time I kissed you  
cause things aint been the same ever since  
You got me thinking I could eat A tenPenny nail  
And spit out A barbed wire fence  
Well there aint A living creature gonna ever come between us  
I fight lions snakes and gorillas too  
If that aint enough Id start it all over  
Just to prove my love to you  
  
I could walk across kansas in A new york minute  
Climb the colorado mountains in the fall  
Crawl through arizona like A flat land lizard  
If I thought itd do me any good at all  
I could swim lake erie with my hands tied behind me  
Eat A west virginia coal miners shoes
