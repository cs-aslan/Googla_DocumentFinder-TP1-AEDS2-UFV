They tell us that were savages  
Who havent got a hope  
Were burning in the furnaces  
Were choking at the smoke  
They say we havent got a choice  
Refuse to recognize our voice  
Yet they enjoy commissions  
From the proceeds of the joke  
  
Those Butterfly Boys  
At play with their toys  
Stinging like bees  
Itching like fleas  
Butterfly Boys  
You got the toys  
You got the breeze  
We caught the freeze  
Butterfly Boys give us a break  
We got the groceries you got the cake  
  
They tell us that were savages  
Who cannot understand  
Were sailing on a sinking ship  
Were swimming in the sand  
They put their fingers in their ears  
Refuse to recognize our fears  
And fly off to Jamaica  
When we call them underhand
