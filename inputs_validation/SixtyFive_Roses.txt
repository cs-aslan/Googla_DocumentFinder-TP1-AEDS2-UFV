Its been a bit of a while since I seen you smile  
Its been too long baby what went wrong  
Tell me how it got spoilt  
Tell me when it went bad  
How to get back to the times that we had  
  
Were both young  
And our spirits are old  
Now were just angry and we act like were old  
We cant even talk it out without one of us walking away  
  
You were eighteen I just turned twenty nine  
I was fresh out the coffin and  
Girl you were so fine  
The future was bright  
The world it seemed new  
I was with some other woman  
I was thinking of you  
Knew how it hurts  
Knew how it feels  
Knew it how aches  
Cos the heart never heals  
Were so busy screaming that we dont hear the words that we say  
Taking out lumps  
Took a few blows  
Hit a few bumps  
Had our fair share of wounds  
We tried to see good  
Through all of the bad  
Put on our smiles  
Pretend were not sad  
Gotta be tough  
Gotta be strong  
Gotta be right  
Cant afford to be wrong  
Its hard to sing the blues  
When youre hearing bad news everyday  
  
We worry too much for one couple to bear  
Hunger so much for one person to care  
Fooling our family  
Were fooling our friends  
Pray that the pain and the frustration ends  
Hope is a chance  
Hope is a dream  
Hope is a drug  
Maybe hopes a vaccine  
  
In the race against time I get down on my knees and I pray  
Shout at the devil  
I curse the lord  
Offer them everything I can afford  
Id sell out my soul  
I lighten to see  
Tried to be righteous  
Tried to believe  
Prayed every prayer  
Kicked all of my highs  
For hours Id stare at those beautiful eyes  
All of my problems seem to be melting away  
The smile on her face says daddy everything is okay  
  
In the race against time I get down on my knees and I pray
