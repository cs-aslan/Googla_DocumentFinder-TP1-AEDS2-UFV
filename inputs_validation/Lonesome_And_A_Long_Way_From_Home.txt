Out on an open highway  
Such a lovely day but somethings wrong  
Something somethings gotta be wrong  
  
I just left home this morning  
This old road keeps rolling on and on  
Rolling rolling on and on  
  
Wont somebody help me  
Wont somebody help me  
Wont somebody help me  
  
Ive never been so lonesome and long way from home  
Never been lonesome and long way  
Never been lonesome and long way from home  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus
