Everyday in the week Im in a different city  
If I stay too long people try to pull me down  
They talk about me like a dog  
Talkin about the clothes I wear  
But they dont realize theyre the ones whos square  
  
Hey  
And thats why  
You cant hold me down  
I dont want to be down I gotta move on  
Ah  
  
Stone free to do what I please  
Stone free to ride the breeze  
Stone free I cant stay  
I got to got to got to get away right now  
  
Alright  
Listen to this baby  
A woman here a woman there try to keep me in a plastic cage  
But they dont realize its so easy to break  
But sometimes I get a ha  
Feel my heart kind of runnin hot  
Thats when Ive got to move before I get caught  
  
Hey thats why listen to me baby you cant hold me down  
I dont want to be tied down  
I gotta be free  
Owh

Stone free to do what I please  
Stone free to ride the breeze  
Stone free I cant stay  
Got to got to got to get away

Stone free to ride on the breeze  
Stone free to do what I please  
Stone free I cant stay  
Stone free I got to I got to get away  
Stone free Im gone baby right now dont try to hold me back  
Stone free go on down the highway  
Stone free I got to got to got to
