Give a little bit  
Give a little bit of your love to me  
Give a little bit  
Ill give a little bit of my love to you  
Theres so much that we need to share  
Send a smile and show you care  
  
Ill give a little bit  
Ill give a little bit of my life for you  
So give a little bit  
Give a little bit of your time to me  
See the man with the lonely eyes  
Take his hand youll be surprised  
  
Give a little bit  
Give a little bit of your love to me  
Ill give a little bit of my life for you  
Nows the time that we need to share  
So find yourself were on our way back home  
  
Going home  
Dont you need to feel at home  
Oh yeah we gotta sing
