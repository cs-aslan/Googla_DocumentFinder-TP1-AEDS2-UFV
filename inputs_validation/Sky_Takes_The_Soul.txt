It could be tomorrow or it could be today  
When the sky takes the soul  
The earth takes the clay  
I sometimes wonder why I pray  
When my spirit drives away  
  
With a faith and a bit of luck  
And a halftonne bomb in the back of a truck  
Feel the towel its wet with sorrow  
From the tears well shed tomorrow  
  
Dont bring flowers take a chance  
On some graves you should dance  
It its tomorrow or if its today  
I dont say it will be I just say it may  
  
When Im on my knees  
To the gates Ill stumble  
And plead my case  
In a style thats humble
