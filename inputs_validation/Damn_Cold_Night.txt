Im Standing on a bridge  
Im waiting in the dark  
I thought that youd be here by now  
Theres nothing but the rain  
No footsteps on the ground  
Im listening but theres no sound  
  
Isnt anyone trying to find me  
Wont somebody come take me home  
Its a damn cold night  
Trying to figure out this life  
Wont you take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I dont know who you are  
But I Im with you  
You  
Now I see keeping everything inside  
You  
Now I see  
Even when I close my eyes  
I hit you and you hit me back  
We fall to the floor the rest of the day stands still  
Fine line between this and that  
When things go wrong I pretend the past isnt real  
Now Im trapped in this memory  
And Im left in the wake of the mistake slow to react  
So even though youre close to me  
Youre still so distant  
And I cant bring you back  
Its true the way I feel  
Was promised by your face  
The sound of your voice  
Painted on my memories  
Even if youre not with me  
Im with you  
Its all I can do  
  
The citys flooding  
And our love turns to rust  
Were beaten and blown by the wind  
Trampled in dust  
Ill show you a place  
High on a desert plain  
Where the streets have no name
