Wait before you go  
So you will know what I am feeling as you leave  
I understand your need for some time  
Some solitude  
  
Wait a while before you go  
You should know by now my heart belongs to you  
  
I know that you must leave  
And I can see that its not easy for you now that Ill be here I know that
my soul  
Is always near you  
  
Wait a while before you go  
You should know by now I love you and so I will wait a while For you  
  
The sand of time is slipping through my fingers  
You and I still the memories linger on  
And on  
  
Now I know that if I can only let go  
And wait a while youll be here again with me  
The same old friends weve always been  
  
Wait a while before you go  
You should know by now I love you and so I will wait a while  
Wait a while  
Wait a while  
For you
