On the turning away  
From the pale and downtrodden  
And the words they say  
Which we wont understand  
  
Dont accept that whats happening  
Is just a case of others suffering  
Or youll find that youre joining in  
The turning away  
  
Its a sin that somehow  
Light is changing to shadow  
And casting its shroud  
Over all we have known  
  
Unaware how the ranks have grown  
Driven on by a heart of stone  
We could find that were all alone  
In the dream of the proud  
  
On the wings of the night  
As the daytime is stirring  
Where the speechless unite  
In a silent accord  
  
Using words you will find are strange  
And mesmerized as they light the flame  
Feel the new wind of change  
On the wings of the night  
  
No more turning away  
From the weak and the weary  
No more turning away  
From the coldness inside  
  
Just a world that we all must share  
Its not enough just to stand and stare  
Is it only a dream that therell be  
No more turning away
