Oh baby  
Baby I stay in love with you  
  
Dying inside cause I cant stand it  
Make or break up  
Cant take this madness  
We dont even really know why  
All I know is baby  
I try and try so hard  
To keep our love alive  
  
If you dont know me at this point  
Then I highly doubt you ever will  
I really need you to give me  
That unconditional love I used to feel  
Its no mistaking  
Were just erasing  
From our hearts and minds  
  
Chorus  
And I know we said let go  
But I kept on hanging on  
Inside I know its over  
Youre really gone  
Its killing me  
Cause there aint nothing  
That I can do  
Baby I stay in love with you  
  
And I keep on telling myself  
That youll come back around  
And I try to front like Oh well  
Each time you let me down  
See I cant get over you now  
No matter what I do  
But baby baby  
I stay in love with you  
  
Na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na  
Baby I stay in love with you  
  
It cuts so deep  
It hurts down to my soul  
My friends tell me  
I aint the same no more  
We still need each other  
When we stumble and fall  
How we gon act  
Like what we had  
Aint nothin at all now  
  
Hey what I wanna do is  
Ride shotgun next to you  
With the top down like we used to  
Hit the block  
Proud in the SUV  
We both know our heart is breaking  
Can we learn from our mistakes  
I cant last one moment alone  
Now go I know  
  
Chorus  
  
And I keep on telling myself  
That youll come back around  
And I try to front like Oh well  
Each time you let me down  
See I cant get over you  
Now no matter what I do  
Baby baby  
I stay in love with you  
  
Chorus  
  
And I keep on telling myself  
That youll come back around  
And I try to front like Oh well  
Each time you let me down  
See I cant get over you  
Now no matter what I do  
But baby baby  
I stay in love with you  
  
I stay in love  
Love  
Oh I stay in love
