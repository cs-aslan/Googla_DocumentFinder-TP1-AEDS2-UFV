Up so close I never get to see your face  
Microscope I might as well be out in space  
Up so close I never get to see the view  
Down your throat Im never sure if its still you  
  
Up your nose down to your toes  
In your mouth way down south  
Up so close it seems I only think of you  
Up so close I never see the sky so blue  
  
I only wanted to be sure  
That what it was was really pure  
I put my face down in the cake  
My feet were flailing in a lake  
  
Up so close I never get to see your face  
Microscope I might as well be out in space  
Up so close I never get to see you  
Microscope Im never sure if its still you
