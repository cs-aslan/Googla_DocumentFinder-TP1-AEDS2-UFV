Always there when I want you  
I know youll answer my call  
Weve got our own situations  
We dont get into small talk  
Let it pour  
Whoa oh let it pour  
Whoa oh  
Fate brought us together  
We knew wed both fall  
Shouldnt really have happened  
It caught us on the rebound baby  
Let it pour  
Whoa oh let it pour  
Whoa oh  
It always rains when I see you  
But we weather the storm  
We get on with the action  
So bring on the black clouds baby  
Let it pour  
Whoa oh let it pour  
Whoa oh  
You belong to somebody  
You aint mine I aint yours  
It doesnt really matter  
So lets close the door  
Its never easy to leave you  
Dont like you lockin the door  
So raise your glass to the next time  
Though my cups overflowing baby  
Baby let it pour  
Whoa oh let it pour
