I need you here I need you here  
Youre like the rain that falls  
Fall on this heart and make me new  
  
I look to you I look to you  
Youre king king above the earth  
And you have put heaven in my heart  
  
I only want to bwe where you are  
  
Holy holy is the Lord king of glory  
Forever saviour of the world  
  
Though mountains may be moved  
And fall into the raging seas  
Youll never let me fall  
You hold me in your nailscared hands
