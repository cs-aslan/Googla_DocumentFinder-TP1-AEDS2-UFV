Verse 1  
Concrete dream  hey  
Im gonna make a scene radio  
Caught burning gasoline sleeping in reverse  
And everybodys bouncing off the walls  
  
Verse 2  
Bombs away  hey  
Its just another day  
And I dont tread  
The secret of the day  
I wouldnt sweat it  
And everybodys bouncing off the walls  
Im bouncing off the walls  
Alright  
  
Verse 3  
Concrete kiss  hey  
Come on and do the twist radio  
My little exorcist were all getting pissed  
And everybodys bouncing off the walls  
  
Chorus 1  2x  
cause its all that I want  
And I want to be free  
I got Satan riding next to me  
cause were all bloody freaks  
And well give you the creeps  
Chasing fireflies and zeroes
