Hey CarrieAnne  
Hey CarrieAnne  
When we were at school our games were simple  
I played a janitor you played a monitor  
Then you played with older boys and prefects  
Whats the attraction in what theyre doing  
Hey CarrieAnne whats your game now  
Can anybody play  
Hey CarrieAnne whats your game now  
Can anybody play  
You were always something special to me  
quite independent never caring  
You lost your charm as you were aging  
Where is your magic disappearing  
  
Chorus  
Youre so so like a woman to me so lke a woman to me  
So so like a woman to me like a woman to me  
  
People live and learn but youre still learning  
You use my mind and Ill be your teacher  
When the lessons over youll be with me  
Then Ill hear the other people saying  
  
Chorus  
  
CarrieAnne CarrieAnne CarrieAnne
