You been gone  
You been gone  
You been gone one day  
one day to long  
  
Im the kind of woman who understands  
How the road can be so hard on a traveling man  
I dont mind giving you a little room to breathe  
Then you go and take advantage of my generosity  
Im home waiting  
Alone aching  
Your times run out cause  
Yesterday this love could have been saved  
Just crawl back out aint no way  
  
You been gone  
You been gone  
You been gone one day  
One day too long  
  
You know I aint a once in a while kind of thang  
You see love is being here for each other  
Even with you standing right here right now  
right in front of my face  
Youre still looking right through me  
Well let me clear something up for you honey  
  
I called you up  
Told you I was  
Missing needing  
To be soothed by you  
Keep your reasons  
Im done pleasing  
Aint it funny now  
Im leaving and your the one whos being left behind  
God sent me a man who will give me my time  
  
You been gone  
You been gone  
You been gone one day  
One day too long
