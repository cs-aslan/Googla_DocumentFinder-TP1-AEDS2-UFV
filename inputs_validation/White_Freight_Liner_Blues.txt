Im goin out on the highway  
Listen to them big trucks whine  
Im goin out on the highway  
Listen to them big trucks whine  
  
White freight liner  
Wont you steal away my mind  
Ah New Mexico aint bad Lord  
And the people there they treat you kind  
And the people there they treat you kind  
  
Well its bad news from Houston  
Half my friends are dying  
Well its bad news from Houston  
Half my friends are dying  
  
Ah Lord Im gonna ramble  
Till I get back to where I came  
Ah Lord Im gonna ramble  
Till I get back to where I came  
  
Im goin out on the highway  
Listen to them big trucks whine  
Im goin out on the highway  
Listen to them big trucks whine
