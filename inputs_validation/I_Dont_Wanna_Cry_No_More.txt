Hey brother  
I miss you so  
You knocked on heavens door  
And we wont see you anymore  
It must be crazy  
What were living for  
Cause Gods stopped keeping you  
On the ladder of your life  
I call your name with tears in my eyes  
  
I dont want to cry no more  
Past gave me happiness and pain  
Life is fleeting like a flower  
From a distance after sorrow  
I pray the Lord to keep your soul  
I dont want to cry no more  
Were still missing you  
  
Lifes like walking  
On a high wire  
You slipped away  
Ive seen you dying in a vein  
High as a mountains seem all the problems that I have  
But when I hear your voice Far away out of the dark  
You just go on and on in the back of my mind  
  
I dont wanna  
  
Skin and bone wont touch the sky  
I hop youll find passage out of the dark  
To the other side of the sea  
And I know that Ill see you again  
  
I dont wanna
