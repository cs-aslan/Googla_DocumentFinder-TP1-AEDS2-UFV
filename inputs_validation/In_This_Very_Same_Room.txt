Thats the very same door that I carried her through  
On the night we were married last June  
And right over there is the very same chair that she sat in when she said
were through  
Over here you can see where I got on my knees and I begged but her heart was a
stone  
Over heres where I cried did you know Id died right here in this very same
room  
  
To your right theres a crib and its never been used perhaps thats why were
apart  
And there sits a phone that she used on alone to make plans with her new
sweetheart  
Then she walked over here and she picked up her things then left me alone in
the gloom  
Over heres where I cried did you know Id died right here in this very same
room  
Right here in this very same room
