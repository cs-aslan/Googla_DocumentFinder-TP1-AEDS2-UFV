Hide nor hair  
Oh I was lying in the bed with fever  
And I was burning up inside  
My baby walked in my bedroom  
And I could hardly open my eyes  
She said she was going to the pawn shop  
Just across the track  
She started packing some clothes in a hurry  
And then she said she would be right back  
But I aint seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I aint seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away  
I remember so well when she slammed the door  
But the girl didnt make it back no more  
I aint seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I waited for her twenty four hours  
And I was just about to starve to death  
It didnt look like she was coming back  
So I had to look out for myself  
Well I called the police department  
To find out what they knew  
They said no by heck but we will get her yet  
Because they were looking for her too  
But I aint seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I aint seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away  
Well I dont know what happened across the track  
But I know my baby didnt make it back  
I aint seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I called my Dr Foster  
And when the girl answered the phone  
I got a funny feeling  
The way she said Dr Foster had gone  
She said he left with a lady patient  
About twenty four hours ago  
I added two and two and heres what I got  
I got Ill never see that girl no mo  
But I aint seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I aint seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away  
If Dr foster has got her then I know Im through  
Cause hes got medicine and money too  
I aint seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Whoa no
