Stars are falling from your eyes  
You dont feel what I feel inside  
Your hand is warm but your heart is cold  
If youre hurtin you dont let it show  
  
How much longer can we go on  
Actin like theres nothin wrong  
How much farther can we drift apart  
Before all the feeling is gone  
  
Chorus  
Im losing your love  
Its slippin away  
Minute by minute  
Day by day  
Losing your love  
Dont you think I know  
Its a matter of time  
Til you let go  
  
I see the moon shinin up above  
Reminded me how good it was  
Theres a chill comin over me  
Why cant it be like it used to be  
  
I feel so helpless I cant make you stay  
No matter how hard I try  
I cant deny that look in your eyes  
Tryin to tell me goodbye  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont let go  
Dont let go  
Dont let go  
Dont let go
