Every night in my dreams  
I see you I feel you  
That is how I know you go on  
Far across the distance  
And spaces between us  
You have come to show you go on  
Near far wherever you are  
I believe that the heart does go on  
Once more you opened the door  
And youre here in my heart  
And my heart will go on and on  
Love can touch us one time  
And last for a lifetime  
And never let go till were gone  
Love was when I loved you  
One true time to hold to  
In my life well always go on  
Near far wherever you are  
I believe that the heart does go on  
Once more you opened the door  
And youre here in my heart  
And my heart will go on and on  
Youre here  
Theres nothing I fear  
Cause I know that my heart  
Will go on and on  
And on and on and on  
My heart will go on and on
