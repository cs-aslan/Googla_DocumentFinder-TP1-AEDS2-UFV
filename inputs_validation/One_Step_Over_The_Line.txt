When I look into your eyes  
See the world cut down to size  
Baby dont apologize  
Takin me one step over the line  
  
When I touch your secret skin  
Babe I know it aint no sin  
I feel you startin to give in  
Now lets go one step over the line  
  
I know its just your daddys car  
Your daddy never went this far  
Baby we know who we are  
Lets go one step over the line  
  
I can be your drivin wheel  
We could make those tires squeal  
Ooo I like the way it feels  
Takin it one step over the line  
  
One step forward and two steps back  
Its for the first time baby  
Im talkin cake walkin into the black  
A crossin red line and I dont mean maybe  
  
I hear they buried lovers lane  
In a sea of tears and blame  
Its you and me go up in flames  
Baby one step over the line  
  
Theyre drawin boxes on the ground  
Just to make us look on down  
All we gotta do is look around  
And take it one step over the line  
  
A one step over the line  
Come on baby one step over the line
