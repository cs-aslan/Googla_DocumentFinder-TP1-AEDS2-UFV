hear you baby I know how you feel  
Were both hungry for something thats real  
Be honest with me or dont even try  
Cause I cant afford another goodbye  
  
Go easy on me baby not too rough  
If this is right theres no need to rush  
Oh go easy on me if you dont mind  
Cause I cant afford to lose another time  
  
Starting over isnt easy as it sounds  
When you try to make the pieces fit  
They all fall down  
And I need more than someone to hold on to  
I need a love thats tried and true  
Its what Im searching for  
Its worth waiting for  
  
Talk gently to me nice and low  
If you mean it baby my heart will know  
Oh go easy on me like walking on ice  
Cause forever happens once not twice  
  
Starting over isnt easy as it sounds  
When you try to make the pieces fit  
They all fall down  
And I need more than someone to hold on to  
I need a love thats tried and true  
Its what Im looking for  
Its worth waiting for  
  
Go easy on me baby not too rough  
If this is right well know soon enough  
Oh go easy on me not too fast  
I gotta believe that whats between us  
Can be more than just a promise  
Cause they dont last  
So all that I ask  
Go easy on me  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Easy ooh ooh ooh
