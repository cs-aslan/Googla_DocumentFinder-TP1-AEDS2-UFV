Im not gonna choke on your hard sell media dope  
Im not going out like that  
I dont want to hear about the summer of love  
Im not going back in time  
I dont want to even let love rule  
I want to break the back of brotherly love  
I dont want to go back in time  
I wanna kill jerry garcia  
  
I wanna take the past and throw it away  
I want to burn the bridge between then and now  
Im not going back in time  
I wanna kill jerry garcia  
I dont want to sew the seeds of love  
I want to punch marty balin in his eye  
I dont wanna go back in time  
I wanna kill jerry garcia  
  
man I dont have a quarter leave me alone  
  
Dont want no dead blood on my hands  
I wanna shake the flesh and bone  
I dont wanna kill the myth  
I wanna kill jerry garcia  
  
I wanna kick that skeleton in his teeth  
Id wanna kick pigpen if he were alive  
I dont want to go back in time  
I want to kill jerry garcia  
  
Kill jerry
