Hang up the phone before I cry  
Hang up the phone before I die  
  
Well I just called you up to say hello hello  
And to say that I still love you so  
Then heard a voice and asked whos there with you  
Heard you answer just my brother Louie  
  
Well hang up the phone before I cry  
Oh hang up the phone before I die  
For our love can never ever be  
And by the way your brothers here with me  
  
Theres nothing you can do to ease the pain  
Lets both forget and try to start again  
Go tell the guy thats takin you from me  
That he can have you now I set you free  
  
Well hang up the phone before I cry  
Oh hang up the phone before I die  
For our love can never ever be  
And by the way your brothers here with me  
  
Hang up the phone hang up the phone  
Hang up the phone hang up the phone  
Hang up the phone hang up the phone
