Ill see you at sundown  
You cant back out now  
The news is all over town  
Ill see you at sundown  
And they can put one of us  
In a hole in the ground  
Now its three in the afternoon  
And Im frightened to death  
When youre in the saloon  
I wonder if he feels the same  
For whoever wins theres still  
The cowboy to blame  
Sundown give me some strength  
I know I cant go it alone  
Sundown give me your strength  
Give me a chance to go home  
To go home  
Three in the afternoon  
And Im frightened to death  
When youre in the saloon  
I hear the reverend feels the sin  
For whoever wins theres still  
The cowboy to blame
