Hold me  
Long enough to tell me  
What you told me  
Long ago  
Before you got to know me  
  
Only when lovers try  
They learn to talk it out  
To keep their love alive  
Thats the only way I say  
That love survives  
Its time we try  
  
Chorus  
Loraine  
Wont you show the way  
Hearts that bend wont break  
When they learn to face the truth now  
Show me how  
  
Loraine  
I know you feel the same  
Hold me now  
I dont know what to say  
Im so in love with you  
Loraine  
  
Talk to me  
Isnt that the way it ought to be  
But whats the use if we end up a memory  
Remembering our honesty  
I always thought thats what you want of me  
But now the truth has made you turn your back on me  
Oh cant you see  
  
Chorus then Bridge  
Ive got to find a way  
I beg you babe  
I need to hear you say  
You love me  
  
If I have the chance  
I wont let you go  
Ill stay by your side  
Ill be lovin you darlin  
And for all of my life  
I will let you know  
Youre my only love  
Just believe in me darlin  
  
Look in my eyes  
I swear this is true  
I you want it  
You got it  
I promise you Loraine  
  
Repeat Chorus to fade  
  
I swear I love you  
I always will  
This kind of feeling never came to me until Loraine
