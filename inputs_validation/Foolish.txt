See my days are cold without you  
But Im hurtin while im with you  
And though my heart cant take no more  
I keep on running back to you  
See my days are cold without you  
But Im hurtin while im with you  
And though my heart cant take no more  
I keep on running back to you  
  
Baby I dont know why ya treatin me so bad  
You said you love me no one above me  
And I was all you had  
And though my heart is eating for ya  
I cant stop crying  
I dont know how  
I allow you to treat me this way and still i stay  
  
Baby I dont know why ya wanna do me wrong  
See when Im home Im all alone  
And you are always gone  
Boy you know I really love you  
I cant deny  
I cant see how you could bring me to so many tears  
after all these years  
  
See my days are cold without you  
But Im hurtin while im with you  
And though my heart cant take no more  
I keep on running back to you  
See my days are cold without you  
But Im hurtin while im with you  
And though my heart cant take no more  
I keep on running back to you  
Oohhhhh  
I trusted you I trusted you  
So sad so sad  
what love will make you do  
all the things that we accept  
be the things that we regret  
too all of my ladies ladies feel me  
cmon sing wit me  
See when I get the strength to leave  
Always tell me that you need me  
And Im weak cause I believe you  
And Im mad because I love you  
So I stop and think that maybe  
You can learn to appreciate me  
Then it all remains the same that  
You aint never gonna change  
never gonna change never gonna change  
See my days are cold without you  
But Im hurtin while im with you  
And though my heart cant take no more  
I keep on running back to you  
See my days are cold without you  
Butm hurtin while im with you  
And though my heart cant take no more  
I keep on running back to you  
  
Baby why you hurt me leave me and desert me  
Boy I gave you all my heart  
And all you do is tear it up  
Looking out my window  
Knowing that I should go  
Even when I pack my bags  
This something always hold me back
