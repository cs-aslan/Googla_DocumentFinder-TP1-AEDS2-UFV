You can look at the menu but you just cant eat  
You can feel the cushion but you cant have a seat  
You can dip your foot in the pool but you cant have a swim  
You can feel the punishment but you cant commit the sin  
  
And you want her and she wants you  
We want everyone  
And you want her and she wants you  
No one no one no one ever is to blame  
You can build a mansion but you just cant live in it  
Youre the fastest runner but youre not allowed to win  
Some break the rules and let you cut the cost  
The insecurity is the thing that wont get lost  
  
You can see the summit but you cant reach it  
Its the last piece of the puzzle but you just cant make it fit  
Doctor says youre cured but you still feel the pain  
Aspirations in the clouds but your hopes go down the drain  
  
No one ever is to blame No one ever is to blame
