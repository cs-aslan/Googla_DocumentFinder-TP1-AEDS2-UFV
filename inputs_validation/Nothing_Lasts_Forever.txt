Scene flash is on the run and he goes to belle for help  
He sings this song with belle  
  
Flash when we were young and green  
We shared our dreams together  
And you were my friend  
  
Belle we had our good times pal  
We thought theyd last forever  
But nothing lasts forever  
Nothing lasts forever  
Time goes by and people change  
Its best we go our separate ways  
And it was wrong to think our love would never end  
My friend  
Nothing lasts forever  
Nothing lasts forever  
Time goes by it takes us all  
Nations crumble and empires fall  
And who are we  
To think that we would always be  
You see nothing lasts forever  
Nothing lasts forever  
  
Flash I know that youll survive  
And youll get by whatever  
Though you say goodbye  
My love will never die  
It will last forever  
  
Your love will die but mine will last forever  
Your love will fade but mine will last forever  
Your feeling might go but mine will last forever  
And though youre gone youre in my mind forever
