It can come from out of nowhere  
Hit you when youre safe and warm  
Take it easy my star  
Your time is gonna come  
Your time is gonna come  
  
You got those crazy blue eyes  
Yeah you got those crazy blues  
All those pretty smiles  
I can see them laughing at you  
Your time is gonna come  
Your time is gonna come  
  
I dont want to be your punching bag  
Your complacent little princess  
All tragic and sad  
Im not going to let you  
Overwhelm me anymore  
No not anymore  
  
Yeah you say you got this bad thing  
Yeah you say you got it bad  
You have broken every heart  
Of every friend youve ever had  
  
Someday the time is going to come  
When all your friends just go away  
  
I wonder why I stick around  
Sometimes I wish you would leave  
Youll say youll love me forever  
Then you spit on me  
You time is going to come  
I swear your time is going to come  
  
I dont want to be your whipping boy  
Your pathetic little loser  
Someone you can ignore  
Im not going to let you overwhelm me  
Anymore aww  
  
Im not going to let you hurt me anymore  
Im not going to let you hit me anymore  
Im not going to let you kick me anymore  
  
I will not let you overwhelm me anymore anymore  
  
It can come from out of nowhere  
  
I dont want to be your simple saving grace  
Just another little victim with a happy face  
  
Oh someday someday  
Someday someday  
Somebodys gonna come  
I hope they do this to you  
  
Im not going to let you overwhelm me anymore  
  
I will not let you hurt me anymore  
  
I will not let you hit me anymore  
I will not let you twist me anymore  
  
No I will not let you turn me inside out
