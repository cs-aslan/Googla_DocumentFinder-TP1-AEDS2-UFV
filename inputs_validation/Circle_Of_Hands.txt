Circle of hands  
Cold spirits plan  
Searching my land  
For an enemy  
Came across  
Loves sweet cost  
And in the face of beauty  
Evil was lost  
  
Sky full of eyes  
Minds full of lies  
Black from their cold hearts  
Down to their graves  
Murdered the dawn  
Spreading their scorn  
Cursing the sun  
Of which love was born  
  
We must keep them away  
Or pretty soon well pay  
And count the cost in sorrow  
Sacrifice the future has its price  
And today is only  
Yesterdays tomorrow  
  
Tomorrow
