Youre in the mood for love  
Youre in the mood to dance  
Youre in the mood for a little romance  
Youre in the mood for love  
I see youve pressed those pants  
I see youve styled that hair  
There doesnt seems to be much of it there  
Youre in the mood to dance  
Can I have this chance  
To be your little romance  
Can I have the stance  
I am in the mood for love  
I am all dressed up tonight  
Ive waited all night long  
When will they finally play your song  
I am in the mood to dance  
Can I have this chance  
To be your little romance  
Can I have the stance  
I am in the mood for love  
I am in the mood for love  
If its the only chance I get  
If its the only chance then get  
Ready to throw your shoes away  
For I will sweep sweep sweep  
youre off your feet  
I will sweep sweep sweep  
Youre off your feet  
To be your little romance  
Can I have this chance  
To be your little romance  
Can I have the stance  
I am in the mood for  
You are in the mood for me  
Were in the mood for love
