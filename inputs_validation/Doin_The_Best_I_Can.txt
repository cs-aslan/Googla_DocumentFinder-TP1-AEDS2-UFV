I gave my heart  
I gave my love  
Oh ho my darling  
I am true  
Doin the best  
The best I can  
But its not good enough for you  
  
I tried so hard  
So hard to please  
Oh ho my darling  
What more can I do  
Doin the best  
The best I can  
But its not good enough for you  
  
You know I was the kind whod run  
Any time youd call  
I guess I was the only one  
Who didnt mind at all  
Ill be a dreamer  
Ill be a fool  
Oh ho my darling  
My whole life through  
Doin the best  
The best I can  
But its not good enough for you  
  
You know I was the kind whod run  
Any time youd call  
I guess I was the only one  
Who didnt mind at all  
Ill be a dreamer  
Ill be a fool  
Oh ho my darling  
My whole life through  
Doin the best  
The best I can  
But its not good enough for you  
But its not good enough for you
