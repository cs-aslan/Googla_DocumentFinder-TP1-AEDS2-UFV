Were gonna rock so hard were gonna let it go  
If ya want it loud hey let me know  
Its been a while since weve been gone  
We had it tough now the hurt is gone  
Well when the day is done when the day is through  
Listen close this is what well do  
Comin down like a ton of lead  
Like a ton of lead thats what I said  
Its been a long time comin  
Hey you can tear us up tear us down  
Before too long well be back around  
Fallin in fallin out  
Well this time around there aint no doubt  
Well walk on through the break of day  
Once again well be on our way  
Aint no time to wonder why  
Just try to keep the drive alive  
Its been a long time comin
