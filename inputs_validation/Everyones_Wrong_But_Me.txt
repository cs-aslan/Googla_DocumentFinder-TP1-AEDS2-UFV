Everyones saying youll break my heart  
But I just cant agree  
Cause I love you  
Everyones wrong but me  
  
I keep repeating well never part  
They tell me wait and see  
Still I love you  
Everyones wrong but me  
  
Till the end of time  
This much I know is true  
Till the end of time  
Ill go on loving you only you  
  
Tell them you love me right from the start  
And when they disagree  
Just you tell them  
Everyone was wrong but me  
  
Cause I love you  
Everyones wrong but me  
Oh still I love you  
Everyones wrong but me  
  
Tell them you love me right from the start  
And when they disagree  
Just you tell them  
Everyone was wrong but me  
  
And when they disagree  
And when they disagree  
Just tell them  
That everyones wrong but me
