Ah  
Well I been working up a fever trying to  
Straighten up the mess in my mind about this place  
I cant contain myself anymore  
Cant you see its written all over my face  
Why dont you get on your feet  
Its about time you got to think  
What ever happened to peace  
Well open your eyes and youll see children laughing  
Voices singin hearts abeatin ah  
  
Your always talkin right and talkin about  
The world and its corruption and moral decay  
But what you gonna do about it nothing  
Cause youre more like children then children while they play  
Why youre so clean through and through you wont shake hands  
With a negro whos maybe cleaner then you  
Well listen around and youll hear children laughin  
Voices singin hearts abeatin like they always do  
So whats wrong with you ah  
  
Youre so blown up with anger about the world  
You write the songs about  
Yet you dont even know your neighbors name  
Now you want to go the the moon and live there  
When you know itll only end up the same  
How can he give you any gratitude  
With your endless sickenin attitude  
You strive to get ahead  
But you leave each other dead  
Cant you see children laughin  
Voices singin hearts beatin like they always do  
So whats wrong with you ah  
  
Children laughin voices singin hearts beatin  
Children laughin voices singin fade
