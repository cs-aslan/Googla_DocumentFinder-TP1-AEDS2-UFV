Landing on a runway in Chicago and Im grounding all my dreams of ever really
seeing California because I know whats in between is something sensual in
such nonconventional ways  
  
Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I cant say  
Tonight Im writing you a million miles away  
Tonight is all about We miss you  
  
And I cant forget your style or your cynicism  
Somehow it was like you were the first to listen to everything we said  
My smiles an open wound without youand my hands are tied to pages inked to
bring you back  
  
These friends are new friends are golden
