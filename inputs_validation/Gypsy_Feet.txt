Gypsy feet will wander Gypsy feet will stray  
Neither love nor thunder can ever make them stay  
I cant tame a heart so wild like a jungle drum it beats  
Were you born a devil child with the restless gypsy feet  
Gypsy feet keep dancing to the tune of violin  
Just like devils prancing you dance away your sins  
If I could tame your restless heart would make my life complete  
But I cant put an anchor on your gypsy feet  
  
My pictures in your locket on that golden chain  
Moneys in your pocket and youre gone again  
Gypsy lips will promise vows that they never keep  
Hearts like mine are crumbled beneath your gypsy feet  
Gypsy feet keep dancing
