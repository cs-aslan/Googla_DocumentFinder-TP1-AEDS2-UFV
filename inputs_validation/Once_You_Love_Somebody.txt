Two young hearts lost in love they vow to stay  
Running wild they believe theyve found a way  
Filled with hope  
Shes the dream she understands you  
Now this time hell hold on shell never leave him  
Theyll never let go cause  
  
Once you love somebody once you love  
Theres no turning back turning back  
It can burn forever it can haunt you haunt you in the night  
  
How can lovers just turn and walk away  
Loneliness is an edge that cuts both ways  
So easy to fall  
So hard to get over  
  
Once you love somebody once you love  
Theres no turning back turning back  
It can burn forever it can haunt you haunt you in the night  
So easy to fall so hard to get over  
Once you love somebody once you love  
Theres no turning back turning back  
It can burn forever it can haunt you haunt you in the night  
  
Once you love somebody once you love  
they can break your heart no no no  
It can burn forever letting go thats the hardest part
