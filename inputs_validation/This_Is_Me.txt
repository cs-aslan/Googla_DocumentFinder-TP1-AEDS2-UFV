How can you just say that you love me yet to leave you alone  
You said these walls were here to protect us but its still not a home  
All these questions that are burning inside with answers Ill never know  
Cause youre the only one who knows how you feel but youre not letting me
know  
  
What is it love  
Can I help you  
I see where this has gone and what its coming to  
I look to you  
Enough  
  
Chorus  
I cant believe this is me  
Where I can touch and not feel you  
I feel Im lost in a dream  
Between what is and what seems  
Having to face not to need you  
You know you owe it to me  
How can you think we dont need you  
Im tired of running away from my fear and the day  
That our life has no meaning  
Without a word or a reason  
Like a coward youre leaving  
  
Sitting here inside an empty room that was filled with us  
Only boxes to define what was left of what we used to call love  
Its sad that after all of this time you have nothing to say  
Ooh and the only thing that you couldve done you choose to walk away  
  
Im thankful love  
I dont hate you  
Cause Id rather live and know than what you put me through  
I needed you  
Somehow  
  
I cant believe this is me  
Where I can touch and not feel you  
I feel Im lost in a dream  
Between what is and what seems  
Having to face not to need you  
How could you do this to me  
How could you think we dont need you  
Im tired of running away from the fear and the day  
That our life has no meaning  
Without a word or a reason  
Like a coward youre leaving  
  
I cant believe this is me  
I wasnt wont to believe you  
I feel Im lost in a dream  
Between what is and what seems  
Having to face not to need you  
How could you do this to me  
How could you think we dont need you  
Im tired of running away from my fear of the day  
That our life has no meaning  
Without a word or a reason  
Like a coward youre leaving
