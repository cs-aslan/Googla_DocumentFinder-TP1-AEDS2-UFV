Well the doctor comes round here with his face all bright  
And he says In a little while youll be all right  
All he gives is a humbug pill a dose of dope and a great big bill  
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live  
  
He says Me and my old school pals had some might high times round here  
And what happened to you poor black folks well it just aint fair  
He took a look around gave a little pep talk said Im with you then he
took a little walk  
  
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live  
  
Theres bodies floatin on Canal Street and the levees gone to hell  
Martha get me my sixteen gauge and some dry shells  
Them whos got got out of town  
And them who aint got left to drown  
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live  
  
I got family scattered from Texas all the way to Baltimore  
And I aint got no home in this world no more  
Gonna be a judgment thats a fact a righteous train rollin down this track  
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live
