Today I faced  
A world of compromise  
I had to fight to stand my ground  
One day Ill leave these struggles  
Far behind  
I will gladly lay them down  
  
Chorus  
When we get there  
His voice well hear  
Slowly each name Hell call  
When He calls to me  
I will fall to my knees  
And Hell see  
The last time I fall  
  
I only dream  
Of how its going to be  
But Ill keep fighting until then  
When every loss  
And every victory  
Will be offered unto Him  
  
Chorus  
  
Truth has conquered every lie  
Love demands no alibis  
Life has loved us  
Loved enough to die  
  
Chorus
