I was walkin down the street  
Concentratin on truckin right  
I heard a dark voice beside of me  
And I looked round in a state of fright  
I saw four faces one mad a brother from the gutter  
They looked me up and down a bit and turned to each other  
  
I say I dont like cricket a oh no I love it a yeah  
I dont like cricketa no no I love ita yeah  
  
Dont you walk through my words you got to show some respect  
Dont you walk through my words cause you aint heard me out yet  
  
Well he looked down at my silver chain  
He said Ill give you one dollar  
I said youve got to be joking man  
It was a present from me mother  
He said I like it I wan it Ill take it off your hands  
An youll be sorry youd crossed me  
Youd better understand that youre a long a long way from home  
  
And I say I dont like reggae a no no I love it a hey  
I dont like reggae a yeah yeah I love ita oh yeah  
  
Dont you cramp me style dont you queer me pitch  
Dont you walk through my words cause you  
Aint heard me out yet  
  
I hurried back to the swimming pool  
Sinkin pina colada  
I heard a dark voice beside me say  
would you like something hotter  
She said Ive got it you wan it my harvest is the best  
And if you try it youll like it and wallow in the  
Dreadlock holiday dreadlock holiday dreadlock holiday  
  
And I say dont like jamaica oh no I love her hey  
Dont like jamaica oh no I love her oh yeh  
  
Dont you walk through my words you got to show some respect  
Dont you walk through my words cause you aint heard me out yet  
  
I dont like cricketa oh no I love ita dreadlock holiday  
I dont like reggaea oh no I love ita dreadlock holiday  
Dont like jamaica hey I love her dreadlock holiday  
I dont like cricketa oh no I love ita dreadlock holiday
