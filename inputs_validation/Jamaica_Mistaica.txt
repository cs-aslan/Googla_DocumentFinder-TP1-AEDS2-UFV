Some folks say that Ive got the perfect life  
Three swell kids lots of toys and a lovely wife  
I fly I sail I throw caution to the wind  
Drift like a stratus cloud above the Caribbean  
  
But every now and then the dragons come to call  
Just when you least expect it youll be dodgin cannonballs  
Ive seen too much not to stay in touch  
With a world full of love and luck  
Ive got a big suspicion bout ammunition  
I never forget to duck  
  
Chorus  
Come back come back back to Jamaica  
Dont chu know we made a big mistaica  
Wed be so sad if you told us goodbye  
And we promise not to shoot you out of the sky  
  
It was a beautiful day the kind you want to toast  
We were tree top flyin movin west along the coast  
Then we landed in the water just about my favorite thrill  
When some asshole started firing as we taxied to Negril  
  
Just about to lose my temper as I endeavored to explain  
We had only come for chicken we were not a ganja plane  
Well you should have seen their faces when they finally realized  
We were not some coked up cowboy sporting guns and alibis  
  
Chorus  
  
They shot from the lighthouse they shot from highway  
They shot from the top of the cliff they had all gone haywire  
Were catchin fire and there wasnt even a spliff  
  
Well the word got out all over the island  
Friends strangers they were all apologizin  
Some thought me crazy foe being way too nice  
But its just another shitty day in paradise  
  
Chorus
