Well I dont know if I dreamed it  
I dont know might be real  
Lord its so strange how one will find another  
But I keep on searchin cause I know youre out there  
And all I gotta do is open my eyes and see her  the mystery woman  
Cause Im confused but only sometimes  
Patiently waiting baby just for you  
But Ill be leavin babe I wont go under  
All I gotta do is open my eyes and see her  a mystery woman  
  
If I have to chase her all around the country  
Well Im bound to find her somewhere and thats no lie  
Aint it strange how one will find another  
But Ill keep on searchin cause I know youre out there  
All I gotta do is open my eyes and see her  a mystery woman  
All I gotta do is open my eyes and see you  my mystery woman  
Hey yeah  my mystery woman
