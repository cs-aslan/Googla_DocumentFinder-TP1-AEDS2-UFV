Watch out for the kiss  
  
There are things you should know  
Distance between us grow  
Youre holding on strong  
Oh how easy it would be to let go  
  
Its taking you far too long  
You did not look at the fire  
Its taking you far too long  
And it has become our funeral pyre  
I spread my wings for you  
Heaven let your gate be open  
Ill bless you with venomous kisses  
And death in its own beauty  
  
Listen to my heart to my  
Listen to my heart to my  
  
Im losing my faith in you  
You dont want it to be true  
Theres nothing you can do  
Theres nothing you can do  
  
Ive lost my faith in you  
You did not look at the fire  
Ive lost my faith its true  
And it has become our funeral pyre  
  
I spread my wings for you  
Heaven let your gate be open  
Ill bless you with venomous kisses  
My love in its own cruelty  
  
Listen to my heart to hear it sing  
A song of returning to heaven  
Feel my poison sting  
  
Listen to my heart to hear it sing  
A song of returning to heaven  
Feel my poison sting  
  
Listen to my heart to hear it sing  
A song of returning to heaven  
Feel my poison sting  
  
Listen to my heart to hear it sing  
A song of returning to heaven  
Feel my poison sting  
  
Listen to my heart to hear it sing  
A song of returning to heaven  
Feel my poison sting
