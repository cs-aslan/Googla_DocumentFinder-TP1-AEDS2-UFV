Though I know its time to take you home  
Baby you and I are all alone  
We could take a moment of our own  
And look what weve got  
  
You could destroy this heart of mine  
Im only trying to get by  
Hiding in the shadows of the night  
Holding you and knowing the wrong is right  
  
Show me some mercy  
You know what youre doing is making me a happy man  
I shield you from the rain  
Ive been slow to get you but Im working as hard as I can  
  
This time its what we believe is true  
And whether you believe Im in love with you  
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean  
  
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen  
And all the years of tears and laughter  
We could go through  
Will it be happy ever after  
For me and you Ooh Ah  
  
Heaven is a place inside of me  
Living with your heart as company  
Only you can change the way I feel  
And make it feel good  
  
Where there is love there is no crime  
Im only trying to get mine  
Let me be the one to dry your eyes  
We can be the promise that never dies  
  
Light of an angel  
Blinded by the vision Im wishing we could travel on  
Stay with me baby  
Any less than an hour you be leaving me lonely too long  
  
This time its what we believe is true  
And whether you believe Im in love with you  
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean  
  
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen  
And you define the dream youre after  
Make it come true  
Will it be happy ever after  
Will it be happy ever after  
For me and you
