I cant keep this together  
And I might lose this year  
I cant get through December  
And you know all my fears  
Some place somewhere behind me  
I walked right through the truth  
The truth is that youre the one thing  
That always pulls me through  
This troubled life I choose  
  
Chorus  
You are the one that I need  
You know that I can still bleed  
Bring me back to life  
Bring me back to life  
You bring me down from my cloud  
You keep my feet on the ground  
Bring me back to life  
Bring me back to life  
  
When I thought that I might be invincible  
It wasnt long before I was invisible  
To your eyes and I swear  
Theres nothing left in here  
And the more you say you dont care  
The more I know youre there  
  
Chorus  
  
I cant keep this together  
You are the one that I need  
I cant stay sick forever  
You know that I can still bleed  
I cant stop this disaster  
You bring me down from my cloud  
I cant fall any faster  
  
You are the one that I need  
You know that I can still bleed  
Bring me back to life  
Bring me back to life  
  
Chorus  
  
You are the one that I need  
You know that I can still bleed  
You bring me down from my cloud  
You keep my feet on the ground
