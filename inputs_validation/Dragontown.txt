Well here you are lying bleeding on a grimy street  
See the broken glass sparkling darkly as it cuts your feet  
Smell the rotting stench the rancid odor of old cantonese  
Feel the toxic flames all around you you can hardly breathe  
Come with me  
  
Come on Ive got something to show you  
Come on You thought that it was over  
Come on Youre really gonna love this  
Come on Come on Come on Come on Come on  
  
We can dig you a hole deep in the ground  
Bury your soul down in Dragontown  
Well he lower than low spiralin down  
Far as you want to go down in Dragontown  
  
Open any door remember everyone you met before  
Oh Theres a wicked young man cooking slowly the frying pan  
And our family of bones are back together sleeping all alone  
Then theres Alice dear and all the little things that got him here  
Now youre here  
  
Come on Ive got something to show you  
Come on You thought that it was over  
Come on Youre really gonna love this  
Come on Come on Come on Come on Come on  
  
We can dig you a hole deep in the ground  
Bury your soul down in Dragontown  
Well be lower than low spiralin down  
Far as you want to go down in Dragontown  
  
We can dig you a hole deep in the ground  
Bury your soul down in Dragontown  
Well he lower than low spiralin down  
Far as you want to go down in Dragontown  
  
We can dig you a hole deep in the ground  
Bury your soul down in Dragontown  
Well he lower than low spiralin down  
Far as you want to go down in Dragontown
