Teddys rolling now most every night  
Skatin backwards at the speed of light  
Hes changed in a thousand little ways  
Hes changed yes indeed  
You know hes movin on metal yes hes  
Hanging tight with the Jack of Speed  
  
Sheenas party theres a case in point  
That right wing hooey sure stunk up the joint  
Hes gone he walks through the old routines  
But hes gone guaranteed  
He may be sittin in the kitchen but hes  
Steppin out with the Jack of Speed  
  
You maybe got lucky for a few good years  
But theres no way back from there to here  
Hes a one way rider  
On the shriek express  
And his new best friend is at the throttle more or less  
  
He cant hear you honey thats alright  
Pack some things and head up into the light  
Dont stop hell be callin out your name  
But dont stop when you hear him plead  
You better move now little darlin or youll be  
Trading fours with the Jack of Speed
