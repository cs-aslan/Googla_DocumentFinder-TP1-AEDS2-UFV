When the world in which you live in  
Gets a bit too much to bear  
And you need someone to lean on  
When you look theres no one there  
  
Youre gonna find me out in the country  
Yeah youre gonna find me way out in the country  
Where the air is good and the day is fine  
And the pretty girl has a hand in mine  
And the silver stream is a poor mans wine  
In the country in the country  
  
When youre walking in the city  
And youre feeling rather small  
And the people on the sidewalk  
Seem to form a solid wall  
  
Youre gonna find me out in the country  
Hey youre gonna find me way out in the country  
Where the air is good and the day is fine  
And the pretty girl has a hand in mine  
And the silver stream is a poor mans wine  
In the country in the country  
  
Hurry hurry hurry  
For the time is slipping by  
You dont need a ticket  
It belongs to you and I  
  
Come on an join me out in the country  
Where the air is good and the day is fine  
And the pretty girl has a hand in mine  
And the silver stream is a poor mans wine  
In the country in the country
