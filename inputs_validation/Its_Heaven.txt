You mean everything to me its heaven heaven  
All I want our love to be is heaven heaven  
Aah is it true that you love me  
Oh I swear by the stars above  
And if my prayers are answered you are my only love  
Ohoh you mean everything to me its heaven heaven  
All I want our love to be is heaven heaven  
Our kind is the best in anyway and it leaves us soon apart  
But absence makes me wonder of you here in my heart ohoh  
You mean everything to me its heaven heaven heaven
