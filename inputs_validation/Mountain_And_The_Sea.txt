You call me a mountain  
And I call you the sea  
Ill stand tall and certain  
And watch you swallow me  
  
You can move me if you want to  
You can move a mountain you can move a mountain  
You can move me if you want to  
You can move everything you can move everything  
  
I will grow my own trees  
While you follow the moon  
I feel you in my knees  
Say youll come in soon  
  
You can move me if you want to  
You can move a mountain you can move a mountain  
You can move me if you want to  
You can move everything you can move everything  
  
But then one day youll go away but I will too  
But until then oh my darling friend well I will hold  
Yes I will hold yes I will hold  
Yes I will hold on to you  
  
You can move me if you want to  
You can move a mountain you can move a mountain  
You can move me if you want to  
You can move everything you can move everything
