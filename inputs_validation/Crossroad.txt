Robert Johnson  
  
I went down to the crosroads  
Fell down on my knees  
Down to the crossroads  
Fell down on my knees  
I said Im beggin for mercy wont you take me  
If you please  
  
I went down to the crossroads  
Tried to beg a ride  
I went down to the crossroads  
Tried to beg a ride  
Nobody seemed to know me  
Everybody passed me by  
Take a ride  
  
Going down toward Rosedale  
Took Loretta by my side  
Going down to Rosedale  
Took Loretta by my side  
Can still buy a house there  
On the riverside  
One more time  
  
You can run you can run  
Tell all my friends Ill be by  
You can run you can run  
Tell my friends Ill be by  
And Ill be stayin in the crossroads  
I believe Im sinkin down
