Put away my black book  
Throw it on the fire  
Getting out the side door  
You are my one desire  
Baby when you hold me  
I feel see youre everything  
Baby when you touch me  
I need nothing no more  
Put away my black book  
  
Put in on the fire  
Dont give up on me Lord  
Take my spirit higher  
Nothing can behold me  
  
Dont put me on the fire  
Baby when you hold me  
I will see no fear  
Baby when you touch me  
You see it in my eyes  
Put away my black book  
  
Put it on the fire  
Ive made up my mind  
I got nothing to hide  
Ive made up my mind  
I got nothing to hide  
  
Give me my soul Repeat x7  
Give you my soul  
Give me my soul  
Give you my soul Repeat x10  
Give you  
Give you my soul Repeat x4
