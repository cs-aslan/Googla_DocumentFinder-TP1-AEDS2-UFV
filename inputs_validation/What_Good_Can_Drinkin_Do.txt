What good can drinkin do what good can drinkin do  
Lord I drink all night but the next day I still feel blue  
  
Theres a glass on the table they say its gonna ease all my pain  
And theres a glass on the table they say its gonna ease all my pain  
But I drink it down an the next day I feel the same  
  
Gimme whiskey gimme bourbon give me gin  
Oh gimme whiskey give me bourbon gimme gin  
Cause it dont matter what Im drinkin Lord as long as it drown this sorrow

Lord I start drinking Friday start drinking Friday night  
But then I wake up on Sunday child there aint nothin thats right

What good can drinkin do what good can drinkin do  
Well I drink all night but the next day I still feel blue
