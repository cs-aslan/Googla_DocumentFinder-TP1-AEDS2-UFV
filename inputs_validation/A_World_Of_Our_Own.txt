Ou kiss me darling a miracle starts  
A magic feeling comes into our hearts  
The spell of love began when were alone  
And were in a world of our own  
You say you want me and music I hear  
Touch me my darling and clouds disappear  
The sky is bright above and cares have flown  
And were in a world of our own  
Holding you close is heaven  
Only I know what its worth  
Knowing youre mine forever  
Is the greatest wonder on earth  
Nothing can change it the magics begun  
When were together our hearts become one  
I find a happiness Ive never known  
When were in a world of our own  
When were ina world of our own
