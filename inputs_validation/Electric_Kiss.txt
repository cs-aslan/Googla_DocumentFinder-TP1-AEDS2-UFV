We are a generation twisted by our myth  
Confused and ludicrous holding on to love  
Consumed by all the pleasures in our midst  
A life without the lips weve kissed  
And losing all control  
  
Were gonna start a resistance  
So we want independence  
Were gonna give the world some of this  
  
Electric kiss  
Im gonna change the world with my lips  
One voice forever  
Well live together  
Peace love solitude and happiness  
Electric kiss  
  
Fame is our felony  
Were so in love with it  
Superstars and masochists  
Who dont know where to go  
But the poets and the fathers of our time  
Put down their weapons in their arms  
And know what they must do  
  
Were gonna start a resistance  
So we want independence  
Were gonna give the world some of this  
  
Electric kiss  
Im gonna change the world with my lips  
One voice forever  
Well live together  
Peace love solitude and happiness  
  
Electric kiss  
Im gonna change the world with my lips  
One voice for ever  
Well live together  
Peace love solitude and happiness  
Electric kiss
