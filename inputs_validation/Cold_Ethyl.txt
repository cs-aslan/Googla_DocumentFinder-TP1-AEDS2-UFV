One thing I miss is Cold Ethyl and her skeleton kiss  
We met last night making love by the refrigerator light  
Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms  
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms  
  
One thing  
No lie  
Ethyls frigid as an eskimo pie  
Shes cool in bed  
Well she oughta be cause Ethyls dead  
  
Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms  
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms  
Come on Cold Ethyl  
Freeze me babe  
  
One thing  its true  
Cold Ethyl I am stuck on you  
And everything is my way  
Ethyl dont have much to say  
  
Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms  
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms  
Come here Cold Ethyl  
What makes you so cold Ooh so cold  
  
Cold Ethyl  
Cold Cold Ethyl  
If I live til ninetyseven  
Youll still be waiting in refrigerator heaven  
  
Cause youre cool  
Youre ice  
Cold Ethyl  
Youre my paradise
