Im looking at you but Im talking to myself  
Looking straight at you but Im talking to myself  
Talking to myself  
Cause I still can remember  
Words that didnt sound so well planned  
What is wrong with me  
You dont have to pretend to understand  
  
Every moment I am thinking to myself  
It seems so different I am thinking to myself  
Thinking to myself  
And I dont want to face it  
Why is everything so past tense  
What is wrong with me  
This just dont seem to make any sense  
  
And Im looking at you but Im talking to myself  
Looking straight at you but Im talking to myself  
  
It wasnt over I was hoping to myself  
Weve got forever I was hoping to myself  
Hoping to myself  
And for a shred of a second  
I thought we could still change our fate  
What is wrong with me  
I can see its already way too late  
  
Cause youre looking at me but youre talking to  
Yourself  
Looking straight at me but youre talking to yourself  
And Im looking at you but Im talking to myself  
Looking straight at you but Im talking to myself
