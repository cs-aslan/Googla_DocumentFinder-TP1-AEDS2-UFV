She plaits her hair I bite my nails  
We balance love on the scales  
I wind the clock and go to bed  
Our love is hanging on a thread  
She gets undressed I undress too  
The draft is cold in my bedroom  
We cuddle up and say goodnight  
Its all the love there is tonight  
I cant be brave enough  
She cannot say what were feeling  
Day after day  
Were going through the motions  
We find it hard to let each other go  
  
She boils the eggs I make the tea  
Outside the sun shines on the street  
Were at that point here love has gone  
The fuse is lit it wont be long  
I take a walk she cleans the house  
This is the end Im in no doubt  
But neither one of us can show  
The slightest sign of letting go
