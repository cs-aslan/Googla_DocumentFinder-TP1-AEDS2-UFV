Great King Rat died today  
Born on the twenty first of May  
Died syphilis forty four on his birthday  
Every second word he swore  
Yes he was the son of a whore  
Always wanted by the law  
  
Wouldnt you like to know   
Wouldnt you like to know people   
Great King Rat was a dirty old man  
And a dirty old man was he  
Now what did I tell you  
Would you like to see   
  
Now hear this  
Where will I be tomorrow   
Will I beg  Will I borrow   
I dont care I dont care anyway  
Come on come on the time is right  
The man is evil and that is right  
I told you ah yes I told you  
And thats no lie oh no no  
  
Wouldnt you like to know   
Wouldnt you like to know   
Wouldnt you like to know   
Great King Rat was a dirty old man  
And a dirty old man was he  
Now what did I tell you  
Would you like to see   
Show me  
  
Oooh oooh oooh oooh  
Wouldnt you like to know   
Wouldnt you like to know people people   
Great King Rat was a dirty old man  
And a dirty old man was he  
Now what did I tell you  
Would you like to see   
  
Hit it  
  
Now listen all you people  
Put out the good and keep the bad  
Dont believe all you read in the Bible  
You sinners get in line  
Saints you leave far behind  
Very soon youre gonna be his disciple  
  
Dont listen to what mama says  
Not a word  not a word mama says  
Or else youll find yourself being the rival  
Sure the great lord before he died  
Knelt sinners by his side  
And said youre going to realise tomorrow oh woh oh woh oh woh  
  
No Im not going to tell you  
What you already know  
Cause time and time again  
The old man said it all a long time ago  
Come on come on the time is right  
This evil man will fight  
I told you once before  
  
Hear it  
No  
  
Wouldnt you like to know   
Wouldnt you like to know   
Just like I said before  
Great King Rat was a dirty old man  
And a dirty old man was he  
The last time I tell you  
Would you like to see
