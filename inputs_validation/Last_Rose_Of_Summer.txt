tis the last rose of summer left blooming all alone  
All her lovely companions are faded and gone  
No flower of her kindred no rose bud is nigh  
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh  
  
Ill not leave thee thou lone one to pine on the stem  
Since the lovely are sleeping go sleep thou with them  
thus kindly I scatter thy leaves oer the bed  
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead  
  
So soon may I follow when friendships decay  
And from loves shining circle the gems drop away  
When true hearts lie witherd and fond ones are flown  
Oh who would inhabit this bleak world alone
