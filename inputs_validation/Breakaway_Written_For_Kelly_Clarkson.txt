Grew up in a small town  
And when the rain would fall down  
Id just stare out my window  
  
Dreaming of what could be  
And if Id end up happy  
I would pray  
  
Trying not to reach out  
But when I try to speakout  
Felt like no one could hear me  
  
Wanted to belong here  
But something felt so wrong here  
So I pray I could breakaway  
  
Ill spread my wings and Ill learn how to fly  
Ill do what it takes till I touch the sky  
Make a wish take a chance  
Make a change and break away  
Out of the darkness and into the sun  
But I wont forget all the ones that I love  
Ill take a risk take a chance  
Make a change and break away  
  
Wanna feel the warm breeze  
Sleep under a palm tree  
Feel the rush of the ocean  
Get onboard a fast train  
Travel on a jetplane  
Far away  
And break away  
  
Im spreadin my wings and Ill learn how to fly  
Ill do what it takes till I touch the sky  
Make a wish take a chance  
Make a change and break away  
Out of the darkness and into the sun  
But I wont forget all the ones that I love  
Ill take a risk take a chance  
Make a change and break away  
  
Buildings with a hundred floors  
Swinging with revolving doors  
Maybe I dont know where theyll take me  
Gotta keep movin on movin on  
Fly away  
Break away  
  
Im spreadin my wings and Ill learn how to fly  
Though its not easy to tell you goodbye  
Take a risk take a chance  
Make a change and break away  
Out of the darkness and into the sun  
But I wont forget the place I come from  
I gotta take a risk take a chance  
Make a change and break away  
I should Breakaway  
Break away
