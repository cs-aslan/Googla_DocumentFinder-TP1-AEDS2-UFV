Believe me when I tell you

When you told me you didnt need me anymore  
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Believe me when I beg you  
Ill never do you no harm no harm  
  
When you told me you didnt need me anymore  
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried  
When you told me you didnt need me anymore  
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried  
  
Oh Darling please believe me  
Ill never let you down  
Believe me when I tell you  
Ill never do you no harm
