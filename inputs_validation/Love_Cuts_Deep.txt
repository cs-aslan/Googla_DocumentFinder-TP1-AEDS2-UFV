Youre knockin on my door  
Say ya want me back again  
Say ya wanna try once more  
But a broken heart dont mend  
  
Wasnt all that long ago  
You swore that we were through  
Dont know what you want from me  
Dont know what I need from you  
  
First you feel the pain  
Then you start to cry  
When someone breaks your heart  
Just makes you wanna die  
  
Ya feel you cant go on  
Cant face another day  
Until the hurt is gone  
Love cuts you deep that way  
  
I remember I gave my heart completely  
I remember the lessons that you taught me  
  
Love cuts deep baby love cuts deep  
And it leaves a scar  
Right across your heart  
  
First you feel the pain  
Then you start to cry  
When someone breaks your heart  
Love cuts you deep inside  
  
I used to call your name  
But you were never there  
And now you came to me  
Expecting me to care  
  
I remember the words you once said to me  
Like a knife those words just cut right through me  
  
Love cuts deep baby love cuts deep  
And it leaves a scar  
Right across your heart  
  
You give your heart to somebody  
You give your soul to someone  
You love somebody  
You love somebody  
And theyre gone gone gone  
  
You gave your heart to somebody  
You gave your soul to someone  
You loved somebody  
You loved somebody  
And theyre gone gone  
Somebody finally taught you  
  
Love cuts deep baby love cuts deep  
And it leaves a scar  
Right across your heart
