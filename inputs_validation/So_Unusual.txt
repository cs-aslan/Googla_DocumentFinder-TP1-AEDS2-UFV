This is the most unusual story  
Of a most unusual girl  
Shes the paint in my picture  
Of a most unusual world  
  
She can crawl out a frame  
While shes hanging on the wall  
And shes calling my name  
Shes not so usual  
  
Shes most unusual  
Shes not so usual  
Shes so unusual  
  
Shes mostly a ghost  
The way she watches over me  
She complains when I smoke  
But then you do the same to me  
  
Shes controlling my brain activity  
Knowing when I go to sleep  
Shell catch me when Im falling hard  
Shes so unusual  
  
Shes not usual  
Shes not usual  
Shes so unusual  
  
Shes not so  
Hooked on the drugs like I thought she was  
And never suckin on the lime and hardly sippin on the wine  
And despite  
Of her bipolar roller coastering  
I think I can trust shell keep me singing differently  
  
And thats fine  
Cause shes with me now most all of the time  
  
Trying and savin the light  
Thinking not of her own  
And always kissing me goodnight  
When I just need to be alone  
Shes so sweet  
So discrete  
Shes exactly what I need  
Not even make believe  
  
Shes not so usual  
  
Shes so unusual  
Shes not so usual  
So unusual  
  
Oh Not so usual  
And not too practual either  
  
Whats that shes  
Not so mystical  
But not too magical neither  
  
I said shes  
Not so out of control  
And not so used to the full  
  
Shes not so usual  
  
Now shes a natural  
  
Oh shes not so  
Usual  
  
Shes most usual  
  
Shes not so usual  
  
Shes so unusual  
  
Shes gonna use me up  
  
Shes not so you  
Shes not so you  
Not so you  
Not so
