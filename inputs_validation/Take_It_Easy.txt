Well Im a runnin down the road tryn to loosen my load  
Ive got seven women on my mind  
Four that want to own me two that want to stone me  
One says shes a friend of mine  
Take it easy take it easy  
Dont let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy  
Lighten up while you still can  
Dont even try to understand  
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy  
Well Im a standin on a corner in Winslow Arizona  
Such a fine sight to see  
Its a girl my Lord in a flatbed Ford  
Slowin down to take a look at me  
Come on baby dont say maybe  
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me  
We may lose and we may win though we will never be here again  
So open up Im climbin in so take it easy  
Well Im a runnin down the road tryin to loosen my load  
Got a world of trouble on my mind  
Lookin for a lover who wont blow my cover shes so hard to find  
Take it easy take it easy  
Dont let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy  
Come on baby dont say maybe  
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
