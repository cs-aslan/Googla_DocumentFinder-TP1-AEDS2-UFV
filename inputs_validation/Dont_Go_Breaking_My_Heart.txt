Dont go breaking my heart  
I couldnt if I tried  
Oh honey if I get restless  
Baby youre not that kind  
  
Dont go breaking my heart  
You take the weight off me  
Oh honey when you knock on my door  
Ooh I gave you my key  
  
Woo ooh nobody knows it  
But when I was down  
I was your clown  
Woo ooh nobody knows it  
Right from the start  
I gave you my heart oh oh  
I gave you my heart  
  
So dont go breaking my heart  
I wont go breaking your heart  
Dont go breaking my heart  
  
And nobody told us  
Cause nobody showed us  
And now its up to us babe  
Oh I think we can make it  
  
So dont misunderstand me  
You put the light in my life  
Oh you put the spark to the flame  
Ive got your heart in my sights  
  
Woo ooh nobody knows it  
When I was down  
I was your clown  
Woo ooh nobody knows it  
Right from the start  
I gave you my heart oh oh  
I gave you my heart  
  
Dont go breaking my heart  
I wont go breaking your heart  
Dont go breaking my heart  
  
Woo ooh nobody knows it  
But when I was down  
I was your clown  
Right from the start  
I gave you my heart oh oh  
I gave you my heart  
  
Dont go breaking my heart  
I wont go breaking your heart  
Dont go breaking my heart  
I wont go breaking your heart  
Dont go breaking my heart  
I wont go breaking your heart  
Dont go breaking my heart  
I wont go breaking your heart  
Dont go breaking my heart  
I wont go breaking your heart  
Dont go breaking my heart  
I wont go breaking your heart  
Dont go breaking my heart  
I wont go breaking your heart  
Dont go breaking my heart  
I wont go breaking your heart
