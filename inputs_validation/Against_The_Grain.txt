Folks call me a maverick  
Guess I aint too diplomatic  
I just never been the kind to go along  
Just avoidin confrontation  
For the sake of conformation  
  
And Ill admit I tend to sing a different song  
But sometimes you just cant be afraid  
To wear a different hat  
If Columbus had complied  
This old world might still be flat  
  
Nothin ventured nothin gained  
Sometimes youve got to go against the grain  
Well I have been accused  
Of makin my own rules  
There must be rebel blood  
Just arunnin through my veins  
But I aint no hypocrite  
What you see is what you get  
And thats the only way I know  
To play the game  
Old Noah took much ridicule  
For building his great ark  
But after forty days and forty nights  
He was lookin pretty smart  
Sometimes its best to brave the wind and rain  
By havin strength to go against the grain  
Well theres more folks than a few  
Who share my point of view  
But theyre worried  
If theyre gonna sink or swim  
Theyd like to buck the system  
But the deck is tacked against em  
And theyre a little scared  
To go out on a limb  
But if youre gonna leave your mark  
You cant follow like a bunch of sheep  
You got to listen to your heart  
Go bustin in like old John Wayne  
Sometimes you got to go against the grain  
Nothin ventured nothin gained  
Sometimes youve got to go against the grain
