Oh mother say a prayer for me  
Jesses back in town it wont be easy  
Dont let him near me  
Dont let him touch me  
Dont let him please me  
  
Chorus  
Jesse I wont cut fresh flowers for you  
Jesse I wont make the wine cold for you  
Jesse I wont change the sheets for you  
I wont put on cologne  
I wont sit by the phone for you  
  
Annie keep reminding me  
That he cut out my heart like a paper doll  
Sally tell me once again  
How he set me up just to see me fall  
  
Chorus  
  
Jesse quick come here  
I wont tell a soul  
Not even myself  
  
Jesse that youve come back to me  
My friends will all say Shes gone again  
But how can anyone know what you are to me  
That Im in heave again because youve come back to me  Oh Jessie  
  
Jesse Ill always cut fresh flowers for you  
Jesse Ill always make the wine cold for you  
Jesse I can easily change my mind about you  
And put on cologne  
And sit by the phone for you  
  
Jesse lets open the wine  
And drink to the heart  
Which has a will of its own  
My friends lets comfort them  
Theyre feeling bad  
They think Ive sunk so low  
  
Jesse Ill always cut fresh flowers for you  
Jesse Ill always make the wine cold for you  
Jesse I will change the sheets for you  
Put on cologne  
And I will wait by the phone for you  Oh Jesse
