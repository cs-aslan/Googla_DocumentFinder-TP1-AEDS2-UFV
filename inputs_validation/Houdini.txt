I wait at the table  
And hold hands with weeping strangers  
Wait for you to join the group  
  
The tambourine jinglejangles  
The medium roams and rambles  
Not taken in I break the circle  
  
I want this man  
To go away now  
  
With a kiss  
Id pass the key  
And feel your tongue  
Teasing and receiving  
With your spit  
Still on my lip  
You hit the water  
Him and I in the room  
To prove you are with us too  
  
Hes using code that only you and I know  
This is no trick of his  
This is your magic  
  
Id catch the cues  
Watching you  
Hoping youd do something wrong  
  
Everybody thinks youll never make it  
But every time you escape  
  
Rosabel believe  
Not even eternity  
Can hold Houdini  
  
Rosabel believe  
  
Through the glass  
Id watch you breathe  
Not even eternity  
Bound and drowned  
And paler than youve ever been  
will hold Houdini  
  
With your life  
The only thing in my mind  
We pull you from the water  
  
Houdini  
  
You Houdini  
And I and Rosabel believe
