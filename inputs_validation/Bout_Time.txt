Bout time bout time we had little taste of wasted time  
Like love a deux I wasted time alone with you  
Bout time we two were livin out a lovely dream come true  
Bout you bout me bout love yes  
  
Bout time bout time we spent good time with no one near  
To watch me while I say a little somethin in your ear  
Bout how I care bout how I wanna make my feelins clear  
About you bout me bout love  
  
Were in deep water darlin clear over my head  
Bout time to either sink or swim lets swim nuff said  
  
Bout time bout time we didnt have to always steal a kiss  
Bout time bout time I had my arms around your waste like this  
My whole life through I wanna make you feel the way I do  
Bout you bout me bout love  
  
Yes were in deep water darlin clear over my head  
Bout time to either sink or swim lets swim nuff said  
  
Bout time yes time we didnt have to always steal a kiss  
Bout time time I had my arms around your waste like this  
My whole life through I wanna make you feel the way I do  
Bout you about me bout us oooeee  
About your love and mine buddleeooo bout time
