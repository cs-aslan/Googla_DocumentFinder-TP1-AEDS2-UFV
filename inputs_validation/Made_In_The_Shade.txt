Well when I was a youngun they used to teach me to play music like this
here  
  
When I look in your face baby  
When I look in your eyes  
I can tell pretty mama I been wastin time  
Cause you dont really love me  
You just love me for what I am  
But you best treat me right woman  
Gonna lose your money man  
  
Well when I first met you baby you was a red light girl  
But I tried to take you to better world  
But you would not listen  
Still you think I am a fool  
Well you had it made in the shade baby  
Dont let that tree fall down on you  
  
Well I work the railroad each and every day  
Well I work real hard tryin to make my pay  
Lord I never tell you what you supposed to say  
Girl you had it made in the shade  
Dont let that tree fall down on you
