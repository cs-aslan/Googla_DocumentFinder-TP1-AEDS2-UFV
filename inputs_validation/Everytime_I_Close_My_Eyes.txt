Listen girl I dont know where to start  
Cause every word I say is straight from the heart  
Ive been so wrong Ive never meant to hurt you  
Oh girl Im sorry of what I put you through  
Girl Id do anything for one more chance  
Cause I want you back again  
  
Chorus  
Cause every time I close my eyesI see your face and I wonder  
When you close your eyes do you think about me  
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other  
And every time I close my eyes  
Youre all that I see  
  
You and I we shared enough together  
Each other was all wed ever need  
I thought that you would stay with me forever  
But I took for granted the love you gave to me  
But Ill keep on trying till the end  
Baby I need you back with me  
I need you back  
  
Chorus  
  
And girl Im going out of my mind  
I miss ya so much I dont know what to do  
Please say its just a matter of time  
Until I feel your touch  
Until you let me come back to you  
  
I think about you girl every time at night  
Im in love and it feels so right  
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain  
I was just caught up in the lying game  
But now those days are over Ive changed my ways  
Now Im counting the minutes Im counting the days  
Until you let me come back  
Until you let me start  
To find a new way to get back into your heart  
  
Chorus
