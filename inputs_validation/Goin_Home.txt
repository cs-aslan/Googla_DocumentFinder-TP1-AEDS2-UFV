The closer I get to my home Lord the more I want to be there  
Therell be a gatherin of loved ones and friends Lord you know I want to be
there  
Therell be a mixture of teardrops and flowers crying and talking for hours  
Bout how wild that I was and if Id listened to them I wouldnt be there  
  
Well theres old Charlie Toll they threw away the mold when they made him  
And Jimmy McCline it looks like the wines finally laid him  
And Billie McRae that I could any day in a card game  
And Bessie McNeal but her tears are real I can see pain  
Theres a mixture of teardrops  
  
Lord thanks for ride I got a feeling inside that I know you  
And if you see your way youre welcome to stay cause Im gonna need you  
Theres be a mixture of teardrops
