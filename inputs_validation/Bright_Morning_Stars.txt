Traditional  
Bright morning stars are rising  
Bright morning stars are rising  
Bright morning stars are rising  
Day is abreaking in my soul  
Oh where are our dear mothers  
Day is abreaking in my soul  
They are down in the valley praying  
Day is abreaking in my soul  
Oh where are our dear fathers  
Day is abreaking in my soul  
They have gone to heaven shouting  
Day is abreaking in my soul  
Bright morning stars are rising  
Day is abreaking in my soul
