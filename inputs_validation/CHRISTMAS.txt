When I was but a youngster  
Christmas meant one thing  
That Id be getting lots of toys that day  
I learned a whole lot different  
When my Mother sat me down  
And taught me to spell Christmas this way  
  
C is for the Christ child born upon this day  
H for herald angels in the night  
R means our Redeemer  
I means Israel  
S is for the star that shone so bright  
T is for three wise men they who traveled far  
M is for the manger where he lay  
As for all He stands for  
S means shepherds came  
  
And thats why theres a Christmas day  
And thats why theres a Christmas day
