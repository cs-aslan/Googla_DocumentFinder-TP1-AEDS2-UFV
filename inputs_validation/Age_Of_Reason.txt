Do you hear the thunder  
Raging in the sky  
Premonition of a  
Shattered world thats gonna die  
  
In the Age of Reason  
how do we survive  
The protocols of evil  
Ravaging so many lives  
So many lives  
So many lives  
  
Mystifying silence  
Talking Peace on Earth  
We should judge each other  
For ourselves not what were worth  
  
Sustainable extinction  
A fractured human race  
A jaded revolution  
Disappears without a trace  
without a trace  
without a trace  
Alrigth yeah  
  
Always felt that thered be trouble  
Mass distraction hides the truth  
Prozac days and sleepless hours  
Seeds of change that dont bear fruit  
  
oh yeah  
these time are heavy  
And youre all alone  
The battles over  
But the war goes on  
  
Politics religion  
Love of money too  
Its what the world was built for  
But not for me and you oh yeah
