I dont want no aggravation  
When my train has left the station  
If youre there or not  
I may not even know  
Have a round and remember  
Things we did that werent so tender  
Let the train blow the whistle when I go  
On my guitar sell tickets  
So someone can finally pick it  
And tell the girls down at the Ritz  
I said hello  
Tell the gossipers and liars  
I will see them in the fire  
Let the train blow the whistle when I go  
Let her blow let her blow  
Long and loud and hard and happy  
Let her blow No regrets all my debts will be paid  
When I get laid Let her blow let her blow let her blow  
Youll be left without excuses  
For the evils and abuses  
Down to today from years and years ago  
And have yourself another toke  
From my basket full of smoke  
And let the train blow the whistle when I go  
Let her blow let her blow  
Long and loud and hard and happy  
Let her blow No regrets all my debts will be paid  
When I get laid Let her blow let her blow let her blow
