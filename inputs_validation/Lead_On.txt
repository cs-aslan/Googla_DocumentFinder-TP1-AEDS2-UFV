She said I dont recall  
Seeing you around here  
You must be new to this town  
Said Im just passin through  
But girl from the looks of you I  
Could see me settling down  
  
The she smiled and said the invitations open  
Cause you look just like what Ive been waiting on  
So I said why dont we take  
This matter somewhere else  
And get to know this feeling thats so strong  
Lead on  
  
She said I had a love once  
But he just up and left me  
I said I bet it broke your heart  
I had a love once to but  
I acted like a fool  
Oh what Id give to be back in her arms  
  
Then she smiled and said the invitations open  
Cause you look just like what Ive been waiting on  
So I said why dont we take  
This matter somewhere else  
And pick up right where everything went wrong  
Lead on  
  
She said I dont recall  
Seeing you around here  
You must be new to this town
