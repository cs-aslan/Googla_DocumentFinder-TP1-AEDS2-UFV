When we used  
To say goodnight  
Id always kiss  
And hold you tight  
But lately  
You dont seem  
To care  
You close the door  
And leave me  
Standing there  
Oh honey  
Thats not fair  
Thats it  
I quit  
Im movin on  
  
The other night  
We had a date  
An you showed up  
Two hours late  
And though your hair  
Was all in place  
Somebody smeared  
Their lipstick  
On your face  
Yeah she smeared it  
Every place  
Ye thats it honey  
I quit Im movin on  
  
Oooohhhh  
  
You made me want you  
You made me leave you  
You made me tumble  
And fall  
But if I  
Cant have you the way  
I want you  
I dont want you at all  
  
Baby I can take a lot  
Cause I love  
Everything you got  
Though your kisses  
Fill me  
So if you got  
Someone else  
I gotta go  
Oh that you know  
Yeah thats it honey  
I quit Im movin on  
  
Oooohhhh  
  
You made me want you  
You made me leave you  
You made me tumble  
And fall  
But if I  
Cant have you the way  
I want you  
I dont want you at all  
  
Baby  
I can take a lot  
Cause I love  
Everything you got  
Though your kisses  
Fill me  
So if you got  
Someone else  
I gotta go  
Oh that you know  
So thats it baby  
I quit Im movin on  
So thats it baby  
I quit now  
Oh Im movin on
