Ive got an unfortunate feelin Ive been beaten down  
I feel I dont believe and now the truth is coming out  
What theyve taken is more than a vow  
Theyve taken your innocence and then they throw them on a burning fire  
  
All along theyre sayin mind your manners  
  
I caught myself believin that I needed God  
And if its hard for some we sure could use it now  
  
Try my patience my patience tried  
This worlds no longer good enough that makes me wanna cry  
  
All along theyre sayin mind your manners  
  
Silence save him  
  
Selfrealized and metaphysically redeemed  
May not live another life  
May not solve a mystery  
Right around the corner  
Could be bigger than ourselves  
We could will it to the sky  
Or we could something else  
  
No longer sayin mind your manners  
Always burning  
  
Selfrealized and metaphysically redeemed  
May not live another life  
May not solve a mystery  
Right around the corner  
Could be bigger than ourselves  
We could will it to the sky  
Or we could something else  
  
Go to Heaven  
Thats swell  
How do you like it  
Livin Hell  
Go to Heaven  
Thats swell  
How do you like it  
Livin Hell  
Go to Heaven  
Thats swell  
How do you like it  
Livin Hell  
  
Livin Hell
