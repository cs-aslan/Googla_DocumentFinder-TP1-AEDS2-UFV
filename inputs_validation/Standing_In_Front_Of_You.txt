You say its easier  
Alone and undisturbed  
You said yes and danced before  
And got your feelings hurt  
You say most days your good  
Its not so bad this room  
Watching the rain today  
Even though its clear and sunny  
And you fight it so hard  
How to tell if its real or not  
  
Chorus  
Take a breath and listen listen  
Open up stop wishin wishin  
All that youve been missin missin  
Standing in front of you  
Everything youre fearin fearin  
All the walls youre buildin buildin  
Take a chance youre reason reason  
Standing in front of you  
Standing in front of you  
Standing in front of you  
Standing in front of you  
  
You start to sway again  
Feelin good in your skin  
You start to remember when  
You didnt have to try  
And then the glitter turns to dust  
The color fades enough to make out pictures of a fire  
That burns like love  
You can close your eyes dont worry  
Ill still be here in the morning  
  
Chorus  
  
And they wont break us  
And they cant get through  
Cause Im gonna be here  
Standing in front of you  
  
Chorus
