Lord whats the matter  
Am I lost  
This lifes a disaster what is the cause  
Am I a junkie what is my fate  
Or am I a flunkie who doesnt relate  
Or am I a child so full of hate  
  
Am I a doctor or even a priest  
Or am I a rapist who needs a release  
A psychotic prancer  
Times Square dancer  
The mind can see as long as youll be  
For real with yourself  
And youll forever be  
  
Lord whats the matter am I insane  
This lifes an illusion thats all it remains  
Are you listening are you boss  
Am I gonna make it up on that cross  
Believe in Your name and  
Youll forever be
