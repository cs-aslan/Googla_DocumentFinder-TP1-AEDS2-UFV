I remember thinking love was a fools game  
Break your heart youve got your own self to blame  
Ive played it smart so many times but that all changed  
From the moment you were mine  
People fall in love and swear they are so sure  
Then they turn around and say its over  
I never trusted love to come any closer  
Till the moment you were mine  
Refrain  
One moment in time  
And I knew I had waited so long  
One look in your eyes  
Meant forever from that moment on  
I used to dreamed somebodys arms were around me  
Wake up all alone and feel so empty  
No I never dreamed how real love could be  
Till the moment you were mine  
Instrumental  
Repeat Refrain  
Till the moment you were mine
