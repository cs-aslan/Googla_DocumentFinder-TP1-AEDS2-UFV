Eheh eheh yeha yeha  
Eheh eheh ahaaha  
Eheh eheh yeha yeha  
Eheh eheh ahaaha  
  
I love that lavender blond  
The way she moves the way she walks  
I touch myself cant get enough  
And in the silence of the night  
Through all the tears and all the lies  
I touch myself and its alright  
  
Just give in dont give up baby  
Open up your heart and your mind to me  
  
Just know when that glass is empty  
That the world is gonna bend  
  
Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine  
Stars in our eyes cause were having a good time eheh eheh  
  
So happy I could die be your best friend  
Yeah Ill love you forever  
Up in the clouds well be higher than ever eheh eheh  
  
So happy I could die and its alright  
Eheh eheh yeha yeha  
Eheh eheh ahaaha  
Eheh eheh yeha yeha  
Eheh eheh ahaaha  
  
I am as vain as I allow I do my hair  
I gloss my eyes I touch myself all through the night  
And when something falls out of place  
I take my time I put it back  
I touch myself til Im on track  
  
Just give in dont give up baby  
Open up your heart and your mind to me  
  
Just know when that glass is empty  
That the world is gonna bend  
  
Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine  
Stars in our eyes cause were having a good time  
  
So happy I could die be your best friend  
Yeah Ill love you forever  
Up in the clouds well be higher than ever eheh eheh  
  
So happy I could die and its alright  
So happy I could die and its alright  
So happy I could die and its alright  
  
Eheh eheh yeha yeha  
Eheh eheh ahaaha  
Eheh eheh yeha yeha  
Eheh eheh ahaaha  
  
Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine  
Stars in our eyes cause were having a good time
