Mary have you seen better days  
And will you find different ways  
And does he really mean that much to your heart  
Carry all of the weight you can find another man  
And lead him directly there to the source  
Youve got to chart his course  
  
Chorus  
Cause it is only in your heart  
This thing that makes you want  
Start it all again  
  
Wake up from an elusive dream  
Youve got to change the scene  
Its getting so hard to see the end  
Break down all of the walls you can  
You need a helping hand  
Im sure theres someone there just for you  
Hes trying to make it too  
  
Cause it is only in your heart  
This thing that makes you want  
Start it all again  
Only in your heart  
This thing that makes you want  
Start it all again  
  
You cant disregard your friends  
But life gets so hard when you reach the end  
Mary have you seen better days
