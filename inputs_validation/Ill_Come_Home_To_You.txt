If I had my way girl  
Id never leave for a minute  
But things dont always turn out  
The way we want them to  
So while Im away  
I want you to remember  
How much I love you  
I love you I love you  
  
Let this love lift you up  
When youre feelin blue  
Wherever I go I will be loving you  
Think of me when you see  
Places we once shared  
Whatever I do someday Ill need you there  
  
Wherever I go whatever I do  
Ill always come home  
Ill come home to you  
Even though we both know  
Youre not in my arms  
Wherever I go youre always in my heart  
  
Just you ask Ill come back  
Though were miles apart  
Whatever I do Ill come to where you are  
Wherever I go whatever I do  
Ill always come home  
Ill come home to you  
Wherever I go whatever I do  
Ill always come home  
Ill come home to you
