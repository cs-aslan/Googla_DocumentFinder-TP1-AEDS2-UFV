Time is a corridor that winds through my life  
Out of each door comes a day  
And when that door closes and Ive said good night  
Another door opens again  
Down in the corridor there will be a time  
When I shall run out of doors  
Ill scramble through windows and pull up the blinds  
In another room Im still not too sure  
That theres no room for me down here  
I shall be sorry  
It will be clear  
And Ill regret not seeing her more  
In todays room loves at the door  
  
I look at my wrist watch the hands ever turn  
Her face is there I can see  
Ill always regret it but Ill never learn  
Time is so precious to me  
Out in the corridor she sits in a chair  
Here I am pacing the floor  
Ive not got the courage my hand combs my hair  
In todays room Im still not too sure  
  
That theres no room for me down here  
Will I be sorry  
Well that wont be clear  
And Ill regret not seeing her more  
In todays room loves at the door  
  
In todays room strawberry jam  
No hope of blue skies holiday plans  
In todays room trips to the shops  
Shes on the doorstep carrying a box
