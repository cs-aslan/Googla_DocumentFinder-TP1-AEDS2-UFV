Take that face right off yours  
Its not yours love Its not yours love  
You keep yours in a secret cup  
Its flowing over Its flowing over  
And I gave all that I gave you  
I gave all that I dared  
And I took it that Id claim you  
And I took it that youd care  
But you love you more than I do  
And Id love you to be right  
And the wave may crash around you  
And Shipwreck you at night  
  
Im waving not drowning theres no one looking on  
Im waving not drowning on the horizon  
  
Raise an arm we won the race  
Im in your slipstream call it survival  
You wrote the words for me on every wall  
I thank the world for you were aliveo  
We made it running empty and we drove away our fears  
And we drank the life glass empty but nothing disappears  
And we swam a changing ocean  
Our friends upon the shore  
And we threw so many over  
And watched some others fall  
  
Im waving not drowning theres no one looking on  
Im waving not drowning on the horizon
