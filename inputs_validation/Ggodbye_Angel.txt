Goodbye angel  
Im going down but Im not going round the bend  
Im giving out but Im not giving in  
  
Love turned to hate  
Touch turned to pull  
What could I do  
My cup was full  
Goodbye angel  
  
Goodbye angel  
Im giving out but Im not giving in  
Cause yesterday is not like today my friend  
  
Love turned to hate  
Touch turned to pull  
What could I do  
My cup was full  
Goodbye angel  
  
Goodbye angel  
just let it go  
keeping on pulling  
just let it go  
Goodbye angel  
keeping on pulling  
just let it go
