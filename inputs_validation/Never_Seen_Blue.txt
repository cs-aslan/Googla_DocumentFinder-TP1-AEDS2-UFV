Some boy you are  
To take me by the hand  
Through an elevator  
Gotta a little red light  
That tells you boy  
Where the razors been  
  
You said girl if you think  
You can turn that violator  
Youll finally be that woman yes  
Finally be that woman  
Thats been frozen in the pretty silver girl  
Yes  
  
And Ive never seen blue  
Like the blue she drives  
In and around  
And through me again  
I said Ive never seen eyes  
Like the blue she drives  
In and around  
And through me again  
Through me again  
Through me again  
  
Some boy you are  
To wear my color red  
To wear it very proudly  
And wear it like a lady  
Knows how to cross her legs  
Where the birdys been  
  
Ive never seen blue  
Like the blue she drives  
In and around  
And though me again  
Said Ive never seen eyes  
Like the blue she drives  
In and around  
And through me again  
Through me again  
Through me again  
  
Said now that I am  
Say goodbye to those left  
Say
