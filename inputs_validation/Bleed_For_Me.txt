This grave of life I give to you  
Ignore what was you know its true  
Realms of fear they speak the truth  
What has past I hand to you  
Bleed for me Ive bled for you  
Embrace me child Ill see you through  
Bleed for me Ive bled for you  
Embrace me child Ill see you through Ill see you  
Ill dig a hole and bow my head  
To see you smile Id face my death  
Realms of fear they speak the truth  
What has past I hand to you  
Bleed for me Ive bled for you  
Embrace me child Ill see you through  
Bleed for me Ive bled for you  
Embrace me child Ill see you through Ill see you  
Bleed for me Ive bled for you  
Embrace me child Ill see you through  
Bleed for me Ive bled for you  
Embrace me child Ill see you through Ill see you
