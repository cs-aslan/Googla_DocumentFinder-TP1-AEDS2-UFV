If you were Lucy  
Id be your Ricky  
When you were juicy  
Id get real sticky  
And when youre magic  
It makes me tricky too  
  
Yeah Im a Sony  
Youre Panasonic  
Im heavy metal  
Youre philharmonic  
If you get earaches  
Id turn my volume down  
A notch or two for you  
  
Cause I will do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
Im so adaptable to you  
Was untrappable til you  
  
I will do for you  
Anything for you  
Adaptable to you  
Adaptable to you  
  
If you do that fold out  
Ill scream and holler  
But when you hold out  
Ill spend three dollars  
One way or other babe  
Ill spend the night with you  
Thats true  
  
Now you aint no Hepburn  
And I aint no Fonda  
But if you were drownin  
In Golden Ponda  
Mouth to mouth  
Id resuscitate with you  
  
Because Im so adaptable to you  
Anything you want me to  
Im so adaptable to you  
Was untrappable til you  
  
I will do for you  
Anything for you  
Adaptable to you  
Adaptable to you  
Adaptable to you  
So plug me into you  
  
Say youre Vampira  
And needed plasma  
And I was dying  
From chronic asthma  
Id leave my death bed  
To draw some blood for you  
Just for you  
  
Because I will do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
And I will do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
Yes Im so adaptable to you  
Leave a craps table for you  
On a winning streak  
  
I will do for you  
Anything for you  
Adaptable to you  
Adaptable to you
