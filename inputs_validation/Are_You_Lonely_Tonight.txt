Sometimes I can tell early in the day  
Sometimes I can sense in an uncanny way  
When things arent going right  
It looks like just another lonely night  
Wake me when its over shake me when its done  
Maybe when the sun comes up Ill find a place to run  
So dont lay there like a fool  
cause all you have to do is call me  
  
Well are you alone tonight  
Or are you lonely tonight  
Say youre lonely tonight  
travel round the world seen a million girls  
I know Ive been around nothin gets me down  
cause theres someone out there just like you  
  
Someones out there just like me too  
Well are you alone tonight  
Or are you lonely tonight  
Say youre lonely tonight  
Baby dont let it dont let it get ya  
Just say the word and Ill be your cover  
  
Im gonna try to get there today  
Call me and tell me  
You dont need another day  
Lonely night lonely tonight  
Sometimes I can tell you dont have to say  
  
Sometimes I can sense in an uncanny war  
When things arent going right  
It looks like just another lonely  
Well are you alone tonight  
Or are you lonely tonight  
Say youre lonely tonight  
Well are you alone tonight  
Or are you lonely tonight  
Say youre lonely tonight
