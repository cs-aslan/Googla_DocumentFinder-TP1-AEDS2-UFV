At last Ive awakened to see what youve done  
All I can do is pack up and run  
Now I know the rules find yourself another fool  
  
You said that you loved me I was yours to command  
Your kind of loving my heart couldnt stand  
You played me for a fool find yourself another fool  
  
And now now that were through  
You say you wished youd be true  
Oh but deep down in my heart  
I know our love could never grow  
  
And now now that were through  
You say you wished youd be true  
Oh but deep down in my heart  
I know our love will never grow  
  
At last Ive awakened to see what youve done  
All I can do is pack up and run  
Now I know the rules find yourself another fool  
  
Now I know the rules find yourself another fool
