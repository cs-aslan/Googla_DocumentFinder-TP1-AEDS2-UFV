lonely boy  
gazing on the afternoon  
people drifting cross the surface of the twilight day  
theres a little yellow man  
standing by the railway station  
painting portraits on the brickwalls  
of billie holloway  
lovely lady smile

im only operating on lassie come home  
this was authentic you she spoke  
this was authentic you who blew me cold  
she had no chance to realize  
it hit her straight between the eyes  
so ive been told  
in the park shes giving out some photographs  
on which shes giving out some photos of what she hands around  
they videoed a ghost tonite

it rode an orange paper bike  
and left without a sound  
keep on riding sir open up the door  
and shout it out  
lassie come home come home  
this was authentic you she spoke  
this was authentic you who blew who blew me cold  
i had no chance to realize  
it hit her straight between the eyes  
so ive been told  
lonely girl  
dancing in a music hall  
lightning struck her silver starship  
and turned it into stone  
and now shes falling all the time  
into that void beyond her grey eyes  
somewhere a telephone is ringing  
but nobodys at home  
hello junkie sweetheart

your captain is dead  
keep on riding sir open up the door  
and shout it out shout it out
