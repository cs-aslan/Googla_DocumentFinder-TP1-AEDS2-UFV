Ms Maggie MGill  
She lived on a hill  
Her daddy got drunk  
And left her the will  
  
So she went down  
Down to Tangie Town  
People down there  
Really like to get it on  
  
Now if youre sad  
And youre feeling blue  
  
Go out and buy a  
Brand new pair of shoes  
  
And you go down  
Dow to Tangie Town  
Cause people down there  
Really like to get it on  
Get it on  
  
Illegitimate son  
Of a Rock n Roll star  
Illegitimate son  
Of a Rock n Roll star  
  
Mom met dad in the back  
Of a Rock n Roll car  
  
Well Im an old blues man  
And I think that you understand  
Ive been singing the blues  
Ever since the world began  
  
Maggie Maggie Maggie MGill  
Roll on roll on Maggie MGill
