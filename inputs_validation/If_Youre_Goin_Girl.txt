IF YOURE GOIN GIRL  
WRITER BOBBY BOND  
If youre goin girl in the summertime  
Then youd better take the shinin sun  
And youd better take all the golden fields  
And the perfume of the clover and the corn  
If youre goin girl in the winter time  
Then youd better take all the sparkling snow  
And youd better take the fresh cut firewood  
And the smooth red wine that kept us warm  
Cause if I ever walk in the sun again  
Itd be too much for me to understand  
And if I ever drink warm red wine again  
Id find myself reaching for your hand  
And much more than this  
All those things we had  
I want you to keep all of your days  
May your memories never make me sad  
And I wish you love always
