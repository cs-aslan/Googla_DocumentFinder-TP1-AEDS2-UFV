Melody 1  
Working in a coal mine goin down down  
Working in a coal mine Whoop Somebody slipped down  
Working in a coal mine goin down down  
Working in a coal mine Whoop Somebody slipped down  
Five oclock in the morning  Im up before the sun  
And when my workday is over  No time for having fun  
No no no  
Repeat Melody 1  
Ahhh Im so tired How long can this go on  
Said if you see me comin better step aside  
A lot of men didnt and a lot of men died  
I got one fist of iron and the other of steel  
If the right one dont a get ya then the left one will  
I was born one morning when the sun didnt shine  
Picked up my shovel and walked to the line  
I hauled 16 tons of number 9 coal  
And the straw boss said Well bless my soul  
Melody 2  
Sixteen tons what do you get  
Another day older and deeper in debt  
Saint Peter dont you call me cuz I cant go  
I owe my soul to the company store  
Melody 3  
Hit the road Jack  
And dont you come back no more no more no more no more  
Hit the road Jack  
And dont you come back no more  
Melody 2 and 3  
Five oclock in the morning  
Im up before the sun  
And when my workday is over  
No time for having fun  
No No No  
Melody 1 and 2  
Ahhh Im so tired How long can this go on  
Wah wah wah How long can this go on Man thats all we ever hear from this
guy Listen you need to go out and get a job Jack  
With Melody 1 and 2  
Nobody knows the trouble Ive seen  
Nobody knows my sorrow  
Working  
Going  
Working  
Whooooop  
Somebody slipped down  
Repeat
