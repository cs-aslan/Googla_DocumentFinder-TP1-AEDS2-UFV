I need love love  
Oh ease my mind  
And I need to find time  
Someone to call mine  
  
My mama said You cant hurry love  
No youll just have to wait  
She said Love dont come easy  
But its a game of give and take  
  
You cant hurry love  
No youll just have to wait  
Just trust in a good time  
No matter how long it takes  
  
How many heartaches must I stand  
Before I find the love to let me live again  
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on  
When I feel my strength oh its almost gone  
  
I remember mama said You cant hurry love  
No youll just have to wait  
She said Love dont come easy  
Its a game of give and take  
  
How long must I wait  
How much more must I take  
Before loneliness  
Will cause my heart heart to break  
  
No I cant bear to live my life alone  
I grow impatient for a love to call my own  
But when I feel that I I cant go on  
Well these precious words keep me hanging on  
  
I remember mama said You cant hurry love  
No youll just have to wait  
She said Love dont come easy  
Well its a game of give and take  
  
You cant hurry love  
No youll just have to wait  
Just trust in a good time  
No matter how long it takes now break  
  
Now love love dont come easy  
But I keep on waiting  
Anticipating for that soft voice  
To talk to me at night  
For some tender arms  
Hold me tight  
I keep waiting  
Oh till that day  
But it aint easy  
Love dont come easy  
No you know it aint easy  
  
My mama said You cant hurry love  
No youll just have to wait  
She said Love dont come easy  
But its a game of give and take  
  
You cant hurry love  
No youll just have to wait  
She said Love dont come easy  
Its a game of give and take
