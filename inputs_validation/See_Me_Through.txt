Ah yeah  
Ah yeah yeah  
  
Before we met I was free  
I never had to worry about anyone but me  
Now that boy is gone and in his place  
Is a man who needs to hold you night and day  
So if I stumble if I fall  
Forgive me Im just learning as I go along  
  
See me through see me through  
This aching heart has come so far  
To be with you see me through  
With angel eyes just look inside  
At all this love I never want to lose  
See me through  
  
I know sometime I let you down  
But Im still getting used to having you around  
And if I ever make you cry  
Theres nothing I wont do to make things right  
Im not perfect and thats for sure  
A little time is all Im asking for  
  
See me through see me through  
This aching heart has come so far  
To be with you see me through  
With angel eyes just look inside  
At all this love I never want to lose  
See me through  
  
See me through this mask I wear  
Well Im almost there you know I care  
I am the man you always thought you knew  
  
See me through see me through  
This aching heart has come so far  
To be with you see me through  
With angel eyes just look inside  
At all this love I never want to lose  
See me through  
  
See me through yeah see me through  
Oh see me through  
Yeah yeah
