I swim the lake for I have lost my shoes  
Im holding on  
Im still awaiting you  
You cling to me but I remain composed  
Ill take the blame grow you a thornless rose  
I swim the lake for I have lost my shoes  
Im holding on  
Im still awaiting you  
Awaiting you  
Awaiting you  
I swallow deep but the distance grows  
Im struggling on to find the endless road  
You cling to me but I remain composed  
The moon is full but the darkness knows  
I swim the lake for I have lost my shoes  
Im holding on  
Im still awaiting you  
Awaiting you
