Theres a natural mystic  
Blowing through the air  
If you listen carefully now you will hear  
This could be the first trumpet  
Might as well be the last  
Many more will have to suffer  
Many more will have to die  
Dont ask me why  
Things are not the way they used to be  
I wont tell no lie  
One and all got to face reality now  
  
Though I try to find the answer  
To all the questions they ask  
Though I know its impossible  
To go living through the past  
Dont tell no lie  
Theres a natural mystic  
Blowing through the air  
Cant keep them down  
If you listen carefully now you will hear  
Such a natural mystic  
Blowing through the air  
  
This could be the first trumpet  
Might as well be the last  
Many more will have to suffer  
Many more will have to die  
Dont ask me why  
Theres a natural mystic  
Blowing through the air  
I wont tell no lie  
If you listen carefully now you will hear  
Theres a natural mystic  
Blowing through the air
