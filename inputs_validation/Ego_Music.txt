I see myself as a building  
My mind is the office where the world gets done  
Theres a nightclub in the basement when I need some fun  
And in the penthouse later thats where the magic happens

Ego music its all about me  
  
Theres a real purity to my work  
A childish innocence  
But Im also smart and sophisticated  
I mean I grow on the street  
Sometimes I think Im a simple folk  
Other times a scary witch diva  
What can I tell you Im an artist  
And of course I always had the  
Humanitarian vision  
I think everyone knows that  
My commitment is to my carrer  
And then giving something back  
  
Ego music its all about me  
Vacuum slogans  
And up your sentiments  
Ego music its all about me  
Fake humility   
Stand tall than tight garments  
Ego music its all about me  
I am my own demographic  
What does that say about me  
Ego music its all about me

I think what fastinates people about me  
And Im really grateful to my fans  
Is that Im totally fearless  
And people really get that  
In the sea of negativity  
Im statue of liberty  
Thats why people love me  
Its humbling
