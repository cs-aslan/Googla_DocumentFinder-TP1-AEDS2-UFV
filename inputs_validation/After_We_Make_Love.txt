Ive been waiting such a long time  
For a love thats real to come my way  
Gonna take some getting used to  
Now that love is here to stay  
  
Chorus  
After we make love  
Its so good to be lost in the afterglow  
All Im dreaming of  
I just cant let the feeling go  
  
After we make love  
I feel Ive been touched by  
All that heaven and earth will allow  
All that matters is right here and now  
  
Now the world is full of wonder  
Youve turned my life around in just one day  
I love the spell youve put me under  
Just one kiss can take my breath away  
  
Chorus  
  
After we make love  
I feel Ive been touched by  
All that heaven and earth will allow  
All that matters is right here and now  
  
All the lonely days and nights  
Were well worth going through  
Im so glad I didnt give my heart away  
So I could give it all to you  
  
Ive been waiting such a long time  
For a love thats real to come my way  
Gonna take some getting used to  
Now that love is here to stay  
  
Chorus  
  
After we make love  
I feel Ive been touched by  
All that heaven and earth will allow  
All that matters is right here and now
