Im a stranger here  
And I just moved into your town  
Im a stranger here  
And I just moved into your town  
  
Because Im a stranger  
Everybodys doggin me around  
Doggin me around  
  
Sometimes I wonder why they treat a stranger so  
Yes sir sometimes I wonder why they treat a stranger so  
They all should remember that theyre  
Theyre gonna reap just what they sow  
Just what they sow  
  
Sometimes I wonder do my baby know Im here  
Sometimes I wonder do my baby know Im here  
You know that she do  
My baby dont really care  
  
Well Im goin down south if I wear out 99 pair of shoes  
Well Im goin down south if I wear out 99 pair of shoes  
You know I will be welcome I wont have these stranger blues  
These stranger blues  
  
Well the train stopped here cause the tracks are out of line  
Well the train stopped here cause the tracks are out of line  
Im gonna pack my bags  
Im gonna move on down that line
