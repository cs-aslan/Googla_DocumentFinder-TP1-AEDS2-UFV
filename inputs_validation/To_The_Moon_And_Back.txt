Shes taking her time making up the reasons  
To justify all the hurt inside  
Guess she knows from the smiles and the look in their eyes  
Everyones got a theory about the bitter one  
Theyre saying mamma never loved her much  
And daddy never keeps in touch  
  
Thats why she shies away from human affection  
But somewhere in a private place  
She packs her bags for outer space  
And now shes waiting for the right kind of pilot to come  
And shell say to him  
  
I would fly to the moon and back if youll be my baby  
Got a ticket for a world where we belong  
So would you be my baby  
She cant remember a time when she felt needed  
If love was red then she was color blind  
All her friends theyve been tried for treason  
And crimes that were never defined  
Shes saying love is like a barren place  
  
And reaching out for human faith is like a journey  
I just dont have a map for  
So babys gonna take a dive and  
Push the shift to overdrive  
Send a signal that shes hanging  
All her hopes on the stars  
What a pleasant dream  
I would fly to the moon and  
Back if youll be my baby got a ticket  
For a world where we belong repeat
