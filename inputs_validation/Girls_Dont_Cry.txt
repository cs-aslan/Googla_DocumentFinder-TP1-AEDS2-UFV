Somewhere out in the heart of Suburbia  
Flinching from the words  
That could almost murder her  
Listen its the final day  
Whatever boys say  
Girls dont cry  
Whatever boys say  
Girls dont cry  
Shes wearin plaid and jeans  
Like a workman on the road  
Hitchin out west  
With a personal stereo  
Playin Lay lady lay  
Whatever boys say  
Girls dont cry  
Whatever boys say  
Girls dont cry  
In her heart shes not even a renegade  
From the start she knew  
Why she would not be saved  
All her instincts lead a different way  
In the pocket by her heart  
Is a dogeared Polaroid  
A picture of a girl with her arm round a boy  
Who went missing the final day  
Whatever boys say  
Girls dont cry  
Whatever boys say  
Girls dont cry  
Whatever boys say  
I dont care what they say  
Girls dont cry  
Whatever boys say  
I dont care what they say  
Girls dont cry
