Ive got to see you  
Wherever you are  
And Ive got to be there  
Im wishing on stars  
Ive got to reveal whats inside of my heart  
But the words escape me  
And Im paralyzed  
So helpless when I  
Look into your eyes  
  
Chorus  
And how I wish you only knew  
What I feel inside for you  
You probably havent got a clue  
But I wish you knew  
How I love you baby  
  
Honestly I know its silly of me  
To want you so badly  
But keep it concealed  
See my inferiority complex kicks in  
And the words escape me  
And Im paralyzed  
So helpless when I  
Look into your eyes  
  
Chorus
