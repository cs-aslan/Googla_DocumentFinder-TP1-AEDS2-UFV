Now we take our time  
So nonchalant  
And spend our nights  
So Bon vivant  
We dress our days  
In silken robes  
The money comes  
The money goes  
We know its all a passing phase  
  
We light our lamps  
For atmosphere  
And hang our hopes  
On chandeliers  
Were going wrong  
Were gaining weight  
Were sleeping long  
And far too late  
And so its time  
To change our ways  
But Ive loved these days  
  
Now as we indulge  
In things refined  
We hide our hearts  
From harder times  
A string of pearls  
A foreign car  
Oh we can only go so far  
On caviar and Cabernet  
  
We drown our doubts  
In dry champagne  
And soothe our souls  
With fine cocaine  
I dont know why I even care  
Well get so high  
And get nowhere  
Well have to change our jaded ways  
But Ive loved these days  
  
So before we end  
And then begin  
Well drink a toast to how its been  
A few more hours to be complete  
A few more nights on satin sheets  
A few more times that I can say  
Ive loved these days
