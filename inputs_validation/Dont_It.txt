Verse  
13 in the thick of a cornfield  
I learned to fight kick roast tied a knot shoe  
Never did change stayed strange hopped a train  
My first chance I got out of Smallville  
Life has its way of movin you on dont it  
  
Verse 2  
My first stop was a pawn shop  
Dropped a pretty penny for a cheap fender with a song in it  
I had a quick right hand and an old band  
I thought good friends would make a good band  
Life has its way of provin you wrong dont it  
  
Chorus  
Ive been right and Ive been wrong  
Somewhere in between for so long  
Live the night miss the light and Ive been shown it  
Life has its way of keepin you strong dont it  
  
Verse 2  
So there I was a long way from nowhere  
Frightened mind spare time and a blank stare  
I was just numb enough not to feel a thang  
After all we didnt share a set of rings  
Besides how bad could it be  
She never found out Id never come clean  
Life has its way of leadin you on dont it  
  
Chorus  
Ive been right and Ive been wrong  
Somewhere in between for so long  
Live the night miss the light and Ive been shown it  
Life has its way of keepin you strong dont it  
  
Verse 3  
Well now have you ever been down the old back road  
OnTime ballroom  
Its a trip its a bitch its an on and off light switch  
Nobody follows  
Everybodys got their own past  
Skeletons to stash dont look back if you do laugh  
Life has its way of movin you on dont it
