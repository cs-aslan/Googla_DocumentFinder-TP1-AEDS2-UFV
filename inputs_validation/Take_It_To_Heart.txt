Take It To Heart  
  
People are talking well thats nothing new  
And some things will never change  
Stories are turning away from the truth  
But people will stay the same  
  
Its only natural that we go on  
To meet with the days that will come  
Its only natural that we all carried forward  
So step on go on  
Get rising like the morning sun  
  
Theres no need to take it to heart  
Theres no need to take it to heart  
Only the truth can tear you apart  
Theres no need to take it to heart  
  
People are talking well thats nothing new  
And some things will never change  
Stories are turning away from the truth  
But people will stay the same  
  
Well stand tall and make em dream  
And dont let it get you down  
Make em all feel   
But for you I will stand my ground  
  
Theres no need to take it to heart  
Theres no need to take it to heart  
Only the truth can tear you apart  
Theres no need to take it to heart  
  
Theres no need to take it to heart  
Theres no need to take it to heart  
Only the truth can tear you apart  
Theres no need to take it to heart  
  
People are talking well thats nothing new  
And some things will never change  
Stories are turning away from the truth  
But people will stay the same
