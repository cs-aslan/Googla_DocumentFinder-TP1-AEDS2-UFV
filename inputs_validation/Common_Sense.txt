You cant live together you cant live alone  
Considering the weather oh my how youve grown  
From the men in the factories to the wild kangaroo  
Like those birds of a feather theyre gathering together  
And feeling exactly like you  
They got mesmerized by lullabies and limbo danced in Pairs  
Please lock that door it dont make much sense  
That common sense dont make no sense no more  
Just between you and me its like pulling  
When you ought to be shoving  
Like a nun with her head in the oven  
Please dont tell me that this really wasnt nothing  
One of these days one of these nights  
Youll take off your hat and theyll read you your rights  
Youll wanna get high every time you feel low  
Hey Queen Isabella stay away from that fella  
Hell just get you into trouble you know  
But they came here by boat and they came here by plane  
They blistered their hands and they burned out their brain  
All dreaming a dream thatll never come true  
Hey dont give me no trouble or Ill call up my double  
Well play piggyinthemiddle with you  
Youll get mesmerized by alibis and limbo dance in Pairs  
Please lock that door it dont make much sense  
That common sense dont make no sense no more  
It dont make much sense that common sense  
Dont make no sense no more
