I woke up and the world outside was dark  
All so quiet before the dawn  
Opened up the door and walked outside  
The ground was cold  
  
I walked until I couldnt walk any more  
To a place Id never been  
There was something stirring in the air  
In front of me I could see  
  
More than this  
More than this  
So much more than this  
There is something else there  
When all that you had has all gone  
And more than this  
I stand  
Feeling so connected  
And Im all there  
Right next to you  
  
It started when I saw the ship go down  
I saw them struggle in the sea  
And suddenly the picture disappears  
In front of me  
  
Now were busy making all our busy plans  
On foundations build to last  
But nothing fades as fast as the future  
And nothing clings like the past until we can see  
  
More than this  
More than this  
So much more than this  
There is something out there  
More than this  
Its coming through  
And more than this  
I stand alone and so connected  
And Im all there  
Right next to you  
  
Oh then its alright  
When with every day another bit falls away  
Oh but its still alright alright alright  
And like words together we can make some sense  
  
Much more than this  
Way beyond imagination  
Much more than this  
Beyond the stars  
With my head so full  
So full of fractured pictures  
And Im all there  
Right next to you  
  
More than this  
More than this  
More than this  
More than this
