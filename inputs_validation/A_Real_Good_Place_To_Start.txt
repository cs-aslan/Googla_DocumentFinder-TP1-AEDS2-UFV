Still reelin from a relationship  
That left me torn in two  
Tryin to find that first step  
That leads to someone new  
Gettin me back together  
Didnt know it could be so hard  
But if Im ever gonna mend this broken heart  
You look like a real good place to start  
  
I need a new beginning  
And girl you fit right in  
Sometimes a new beginning  
Is found in an old friend  
If Im ever gonna mend this broken heart  
You look like a real good place to start  
  
Thereve been times when you and him  
Just couldnt get along  
Id hear your knock and let you in  
Be your shoulder to cry on  
And now hes finally left you  
And Ive find you in my arms  
If Im ever gonna mend this broken heart  
You look like a real good place to start  
  
I need a new beginning  
And girl you fit right in  
Sometimes a new beginning  
Is found in an old friend  
If Im ever gonna mend this broken heart  
You look like a real good place to start  
  
If Im ever gonna mend this broken heart  
You look like a real good place to start
