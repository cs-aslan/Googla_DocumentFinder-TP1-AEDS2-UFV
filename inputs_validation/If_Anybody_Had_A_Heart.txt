In this world of right and wrong  
The hardest part is beginning  
By the time you find  
where you belong  
  
Youre either losing or winning  
Well I dont know how  
But people seem to know  
When you want somebody  
  
bad enough  
Well I want you now  
and wherever you go  
Im gonna love ya till  
  
youve had enough cause  
If everyone had a heart  
Yours would never be broken  
If anybody had a heart like mine  
  
People treat you like  
the clothes you wear  
They only see what you show them  
Let them talk baby I dont care  
  
They dont know where were goin  
I love you so much  
And I have for so long  
How could anybody doubt it  
  
Oh just one little touch  
This love is so strong  
Baby how can we live without it  
If everyone had a heart  
  
Yours would never be broken  
If anybody had a heart like mine  
When you love somebody  
You may stumble you may fall  
  
But if you love somebody hard enough  
Maybe you can get it all  
If everyone had a heart  
Yours would never be broken  
  
If anybody had a heart like mine  
Anybody in the world  
If everyone had a heart  
Yours would never be broken  
  
If anybody had a heart like mine  
If anybody had a heart  
If everyone had a heart  
Yours would never be broken  
  
If anybody had a heart like mine  
If anybody had a heart  
If everyone had a heart
