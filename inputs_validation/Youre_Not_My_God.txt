Its just a piece of paper  
It says In God We Trust  
A little sure felt good  
But a lot was not enough  
And everybody loved me when I was on a roll  
And I thought I had everything  
When I held the gold  
  
Chorus  
But youre not my god  
And youre not my friend  
Youre not the one  
That I will walk with in the end  
Youre not the truth  
Youre a temporary shot  
You ruin peoples lives  
And you dont give a second thought  
Youre not my god  
  
Little white lies on a mirror  
Cut neatly in a roll  
Medicine that kept me from lookin in my soul  
I thought you were the answer  
To all of my despair  
And you almost had me six feet down  
But Im still breathin air  
  
Chorus  
  
From the cradle to the grave  
Temptations all around  
But no matter how good the fix  
Its gonna take you down  
Now some call it a weakness  
Some call it a sin  
But its all the same behind each game  
I see your evil grin  
  
But youre not my god  
And youre not my friend  
Youre not the one  
That I will walk with in the end  
Youre not the truth  
Youre a temporary shot  
You ruin peoples lives  
And you dont give a second thought  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre not my god  
Oh oh oh youre not my god  
Youre not my god  
Not my god  
Not my god  
Youre not youre not youre not my god  
No youre not
