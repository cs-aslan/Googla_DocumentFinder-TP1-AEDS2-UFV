Anybody ever tell you that youre not whole  
A hollow shell of man without a soul  
Never ever felt your warmth cause youre always cold  
Only thing that makes sense is letting go  
  
Anybody ever tell you that youve got nerve  
Treatin my love like just another word  
Tired of giving love to you that you dont deserve  
So this is one way of saying its over  
  
Chorus  
Cause I got nothing left  
I got nothing left  
I got nothing left  
I gave you my best  
And you treated it worthless  
So I got nothing left  
  
Anybody ever tell you that youre gonna learn  
Trust and respect are two things you must earn  
When it came to lovin me you just werent concerned  
You never gave a damn so I guess now its my turn  
  
Chorus  
  
So done with you  
Maybe were through  
So done with you  
  
Chorus  
  
So done with you  
So done with you
