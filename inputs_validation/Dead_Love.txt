At night the corpses rise  
And leave a srench of rotten life  
Eagerly the stagger forth  
To find a friend to gripe  
Copulating in the grounds  
Of their eternal home  
Regurgitate ejaculations  
On their old tomb stones  
Dead Love  Theres love amongst the  
Dead Love  Theres love amongst the dead  
Licking at their blackened limbs  
The zombie pleasure cries  
Lucifers immortal glory  
Watch them swapping eyes  
Writhing in a mound of death  
Maggots under the flesh  
Digging fresh arrival thus  
To lovingly caress  
Dead Love  Theres love amongst the  
Dead Love  Theres love amongst the dead  
Go home you necromancers  
Find true the words Ive said  
No place for mortal magic  
Theres love amongst the dead  
The walls around the cemetery  
Built high forever strong  
Church of fools demand this  
For the dead dont die for long  
At the dawn of darkness  
The keeper takes his keys  
Locking out the living  
For the dead dont want to leave  
Dead Love  Theres love amongst the  
Dead Love  Theres love amongst the dead
