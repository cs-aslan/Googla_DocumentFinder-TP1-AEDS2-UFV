Come back darling  
Give me another try  
Ill make you satisfied  
Dont you know I need you badly  
And Ill give my poor heart gladly  
I need your love like roses need the rain  
Dont let me cry in pain  
Come back darling  
Give me another try  
Ill make you satisfied  
Cant you see the love still burning  
Please return relieve my yearning  
A day without you is like a year of emptiness  
Please return and bring me happiness  
Come back darling  
Give me another try  
Ill make you satisfied
