Across the river a good woman cried  
All because a foolish man lied  
She gave up everything  
Everything that money could buy  
But the man told so many lies  
Theres another man over there  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river she was mine  
Word got around that he had jilted her  
Men came running from near and far  
Shouldve never been so foolish  
Guess Ill never  
But the man thats got her now  
Hes a lucky so and so  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river she was mine  
I remember the other day about a week ago  
She said I dont even want to talk to you  
Cause I dont love you anymore  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river she was mine  
Across the river a good woman cried  
All because a foolish man lied  
She gave up everything tried to keep him satisfied  
But the man told so many lies  
Theres another man over there  
That woman across the river  
That woman across the river  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river she was mine
