You hold all the aces  
I never get the chance to deal  
Flick of the wrist and you cut me down  
Im spinning like a roulette wheel  
  
You say that loves a gamble  
But you play with loaded dice  
You hide behind a good girl smile  
With a heart stone cold as ice  
  
But I want it I need it  
If you dont give it Ill steal it  
Ill take it all and walk away  
Lady luck  
Youre a loser in the game of love sweet lady luck  
Who you gonna call when it all falls down on you  
Sweet lady luck  
  
You cant stop your dealing  
cause its a crying shame  
When the winner takes it all  
And never ever takes the blame  
  
But I want it I need it  
If you dont give it Ill steal it  
Ill take it all and walk away  
Lady luck  
Youre a loser in the game of love sweet lady luck  
Who you gonna call when it all falls down on you  
Uh what you gonna do  
Lady luck  
  
I need your love I need it now  
Ive got to have it anyhow  
Sweet lady luck  
  
I cant win for losing  
Its tearing me apart  
So Ill play the joker to your queen of broken hearts  
  
But I want it I need it  
If you dont give it Ill steal it  
Ill take it all and walk away  
Lady luck  
Youre a loser in the game of love sweet lady luck  
Spinning like a roulette wheel sweet lady luck  
Youre a loser in the game of love sweet lady luck  
  
I need your love I need it now  
Ive got to have it anyhow  
  
Sweet lady luck  
Sweet lady luck
