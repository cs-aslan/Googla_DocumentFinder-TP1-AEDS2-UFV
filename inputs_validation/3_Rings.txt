3 Rings  
Is this on  
Gather round my wealthy friends  
And endure the horrifying sights  
Only your worst nightmares can produce  
Actual human beings of a deformed nature  
Come at once  
And come and enduldge yourself  
In our own twisted amusement of  
Anothers misfortune  
Yes ladies and gentlemen  
Enter our three ring show of freaks  
Violent J  
Ring one a dung a dung dung  
My names Violent J and I staple my tongue  
To the desk in school then I run down the hall  
Scaring the shit out of all yall bitches  
Which is why you dont invite mine to your parties  
Just cause I dont look like everybody  
I guess theyre bunch of richboys bitchboys  
Scary bula  
And whats the big deal about my neck  
Just because now and then I like to let it stretch  
Up a couple feet to get a better sight  
Is that any reason to scream and run in fright  
No so now how ya gonna act  
So what if I got another arm growing out of my back  
I guess Im just another freak show thing  
And now they got me in the three riiiiiing  
Chorus 2x  
Three ring a ding a ding ding  
People love to point and stare  
Three ring a ding a ding ding  
Its the same as everywhere  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
Ring two how do you do  
Im Shaggy 2 Dope chickenfaced bitch who  
You dont try to front ho  
Try to play me out just cause Im running with the sideshow  
Or maybe its the leg growing out my neck  
But dont jet baby heh not yet  
Im popping in like a pound of lead  
Black n blue his next roll and drop me on my head  
Oh shit I knew I had to fuck up my circuits  
cause when I was two my momma left me at the circus  
Abandoned at the carnival with the freak shows  
Like bad boys hermaphrodites and old man crow  
But then I escaped to the ghetto zone  
Started a crew of my own motherfucker Im not alone  
So dont be stickin your finger in my face stank  
Or your stomach might receive a shank from the  
Chorus 2x  
I certainly hope your enjoy yourselves

But to be honest I really dont see  
Whats so fucking funny about it  
These fucking people are real  
Violent J

Look if you want but I wouldnt lay a hand on me  
Thats how you get fucked up  
Well squeeze your windpipe shut  
Yo Im a nerd word I drink from the bird  
Have Snake woman kick my love to the curb  
She busted into my tent now Im fucked  
Had the fat bearded lady in the buck uh  
Fuck that bitch suck that  
I was born with a wang but I never had a nut sac  
Just two balls hanging with no protection so  
I move real careful and slow  
You can call me a weirdo call me a freak  
Call me Don Knots cause Im getting on it every week uh  
So come see the carnival and threw me your change bitch

Chorus2x  
Well thats it

You fucking heartless bastards  
You saw what you wanted  
So grab your fucking kids  
And that fat flop of shit wife of yours  
And get the fuck out of our circus tent  
You coldhearted sons of bitches  
You think they look fucked up

Fucking lips in a couple times

And well laughing at your folded ass
