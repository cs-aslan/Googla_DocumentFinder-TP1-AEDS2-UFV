Ive been working on the road about fifteen years  
Been blowing my mind Ive been blasting my ears  
Dont you know babe  
Ive been sleeping all day and working all night  
I made a lot of money but it dont feel right  
Dont you know babe  
  
Well Ive seen the world and its seen me  
In a strange kind of way I guess Im free  
Dont you know babe  
Well Ive seen it bad and Ive seen it good  
But now I want to clear my blood  
Dont you know babe  
  
Ive got a feeling for home  
Somewhere that I call my own  
  
Well I tried to live the way I should  
Ive shed some tears and sweated blood  
Dont you know babe  
And I think its time I took a break  
Cause I have took all I can take  
Dont you know babe  
  
Ive got a feeling for home  
Somewhere that I call my own  
Take me home babe
