On na roundabout Im turning on to you  
Dont you love the way were turning yes you do  
Little schools of hummingbirds are streaming by  
While were merging with the color of the sky  
Big yellow sun  
Youre the one  
Heres our souls  
Heal them heal them  
Beutiful girl  
Youre the world  
Im in you bretahing  
Love me do  
At the entrance of the airport as you see  
Theres an icecreamman whos selling sweets for free  
You might watch descending rockets from the moon  
While were taking off with 99 ballons  
Bless our souls  
Big yellow sun  
Youre the one  
Heres our souls  
Heal them heal them  
Beutiful girl  
Youre the world  
Im in you bretahing  
Love me do
