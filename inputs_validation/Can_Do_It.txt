When you feel weak when you feel small  
I tell you theres a beast inside you yet unknown  
When times get rough and youre being played  
You  
Why aint gonna flinch or run away cry like a babe  
  
I say that youd be so surprised  
Seeing what is in for you  
If after all youd still deny it  
Theres nothing I can do  
Listen up come along  
  
Well you can do it  
Theres nothing to it  
When all others turn their backs on you  
There is still yourself to prove it to that  
  
You can do it  
Theres nothing to it  
If the whole damn world abandoned you  
Youre the only one worth listening to  
  
So come on come on come on  
Come on come on get on  
  
Now look at you wearing a crown  
Having achieved now all your dreams in just one go  
What did I say you got it made  
Still pondering on the spiteful things of long ago  
No  
  
I said that youd be so surprised  
Seeing what is in for you  
Now after all that has been done  
You know what you can do  
Listen up come along
