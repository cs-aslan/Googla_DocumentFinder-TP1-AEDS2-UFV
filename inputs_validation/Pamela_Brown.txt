Im the guy who didnt marry pretty pamela brown  
Educated wellintentioned good girl in our town  
I wonder where id be today if she had loved me too  
Probably be driving kids to school  
  
chorus  
I guess i owe it all to Pamela brown  
All of my good times and all my roamin around  
One of these days i might come ramblin through your town  
And i guess i owe it all to Pamela brown  
  
Ive seen the lights of cites and ive been inside their doors  
Ive sailed to foreign countries and ive walked upon their shores  
I guess the guy she married was the best part of my luck  
She dug him cause he drove a pickup truck  
  
chorus  
I dont have to tell you just how beautiful she was  
Everything it takes to get a country boy in love  
Lord i hope shes happy cause she sure deserves to be  
Especially for what she did for me  
  
chorus
