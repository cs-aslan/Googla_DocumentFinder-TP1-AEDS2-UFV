Over the hills lies a new beginning over the hills  
Over the hills there is a way I know it over the hills  
You cant bring all the gloom  
Your heart is frayed and so empty  
You glorify the future  
Living in a different world than me  
The journey ends in death  
You are giving up so easily  
You are the other half of me  
Over the hills over the hills  
Over the hills over the hills  
We are drifting apart  
Chilled to the marrow cause you dont want to go  
Cause weve got a different wish at heart  
The amulet guides us to the other side  
When I go down its you wholl bleed  
Im not scared to die as long as Im with you  
You are the other half of me  
Over the hills lies a new beginning over the hills  
Over the hills there is a way I know it over the hills
