Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans  
And miss it each night and day  
I know Im not wrong this feelings gettin stronger  
The longer I stay away  
Miss them moss covered vines the tall sugar pines  
Where mockin birds used to sing  
And Id like to see that lazy Mississippi hurryin into spring  
  
The moonlight on the bayou a creole tune that fills the air  
I dream about magnolias in bloom and Im wishin I was there  
  
Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans  
When thats where you left your heart  
And theres one thing more I miss the one I care for  
More than I miss New Orleans  
  
The moonlight on the bayou a creole tune that fills the air  
I dream about magnolias in bloom and Im wishin I was there  
  
Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans  
When thats where you left your heart  
And theres one thing more I miss the one I care for  
More more than I miss New Orleans
