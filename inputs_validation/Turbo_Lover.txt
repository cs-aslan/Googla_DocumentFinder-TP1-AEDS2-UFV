You wont hear me  
But youll feel me  
Without warning somethings dawning listen  
Then within your senses  
Youll know youre defenseless  
How your heart beats when you run for cover  
You cant retreat I spy like no other  
Then we race together  
We can ride forever  
Wrapped in horsepower driving into fury  
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me  
Im your turbo lover  
Tell me theres no other  
Im your turbo lover  
Better run for cover  
We hold each other closer as we shift to overdrive  
And everything goes rushing by with every nerve alive  
We move so fast it seems as though weve taken to the sky  
Love machines in harmony we hear the engines cry  
Im your turbo lover  
Tell me theres no other  
Im your turbo lover  
Better run for cover  
On and on were charging to the place so many seek  
In perfect synchronicity of which so many speak  
We feel so close to heaven in this roaring heavy load  
And then in sheer abandonment we shatter and explode  
Im your turbo lover  
Tell me theres no other  
Im your turbo lover  
Better run for cover  
Im your turbo lover  
Tell me theres no other  
Im your turbo lover  
Better run for cover
