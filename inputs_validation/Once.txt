Should of been much further than this by now  
A little bit more gone a little less twisted around  
Should of been much better youd think but Im not  
Im still stuck Im still here in this rut  
  
Looking back on everything that we had  
Holding on to words that we cant take back  
What am I to do with the past when its all that I have  
And I cant get you back  
  
Now I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope  
Im so lost Im so low and I just want you to know  
Everywhere that I go Im reminded of us  
Where weve been all weve done and all the love that we shared  
Once oh once  
  
I remember you sayin I was the one  
And nothing could change that but you were wrong  
Its funny how life turns on a dime now we dont even talk  
I just stare at these walls  
  
And I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope  
Im so lost Im so low and I just want you to know  
Everywhere that I go Im reminded of us  
Where weve been all weve done and all the love that we shared  
Once you made the world feel so right  
Once you were my morning noon and night  
Whyd we slip away why did it all change  
How will I ever be the same  
  
Now I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope  
Im so lost Im so low and I just want you to know  
Everywhere that I go Im reminded of us  
Where weve been all weve done and all the love that we shared  
  
Now I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope  
Im so lost Im so low and I just want you to know  
Everywhere that I go Im reminded of us  
Where weve been all weve done and all the love that we shared  
  
Should of been much further then this by now  
A little bit more gone a little less twisted around
