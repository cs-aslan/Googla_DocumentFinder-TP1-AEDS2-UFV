Love had ended  
Cant be mended  
All along the line  
Ive been true to you  
Even though for some time  
I knew we were through  
I was feeling  
That love had ended  
Cant be mended  
But I cant bear to see you cry  
The feelings gone  
Its been missing too long  
But I just dont have the heart  
I just dont have the heart to tell you  
Its such a shame  
That its ended this way  
But I just dont have the heart  
I just dont have the heart to tell you  
Therell be no goodbyes  
There are no words to say  
When you realise  
That Im far away  
Youll be hurting  
Like Ive been hurting  
The truth was burning  
But I just cant say goodbye  
The feelings gone  
Its been missing too long  
But I just dont have the heart  
I just dont have the heart to tell you  
Its such a shame  
That its ended this way  
But I just dont have the heart  
I just dont have the heart to tell you  
Ooh but I just dont have the heart  
I just dont have the heart to tell you  
If I stopped to think about  
The good times that we shared  
I could fool myself believing  
That somehow love love was still there  
Ooh love love love love love had ended  
love love love love love had ended  
I was feeling  
That love had ended  
Cant be mended  
But I cant bear to see you cry  
repeat chorus
