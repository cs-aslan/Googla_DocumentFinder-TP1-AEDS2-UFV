Mud slide slim and the blue horizon  
Oh mud slide im dependent on you  
I dont know but ive been told  
Theres a time from time to time  
I cant eat i cant sleep  
But i just might move my feet  
cause theres nothing like  
The sound of sweet soul music  
To change a young ladys mind  
And theres nothing like a  
Walk on down by the bayou  
To leave the world behind  
Mud slide im depending upon you  
Mister mud slide slim and the blue horizon  
  
Ive been letting the time go by  
Letting the time go by  
Yes im letting the time go by  
Letting the time go by  
  
Im gonna cash in my hand and  
Pick up on a piece of land  
And build myself a cabin back in the woods  
Lord its there im gonna stay  
Until there comes a day  
When this old world starts to changing for the good  
Now the reason im smiling is over on a island  
On a hillside in the woods where i belong  
I want to thank jimmy jimmy john nick and laurie  
The no jets construction for setting  
Me down a homestead on the farm  
  
Mud slide im depending upon you  
Mister mud slide slim and the blue horizon
