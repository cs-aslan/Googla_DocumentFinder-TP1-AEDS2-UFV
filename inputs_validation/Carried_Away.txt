There you are  
Shiny as a morning star  
Its a figure of speech  
But youre still out of reach  
You never told me loving you could be so wrong and right  
And its gonna be a lonely night  
I turn to you  
You turn away  
Youre looking at someone else  
And here am I  
Loving you more and more  
Weve got an open door my love  
Oh let it be just a state of mind  
And suddenly you appear  
  
Chorus  
Im carried away  
Im carried away  
To be carried away  
Im carried away  
To be carried away  
Im carried away  
  
Seeest la vie  
So you want to play another part  
Can you say goodbye  
Can you live a lie  
Shell never give you what I gave you was my breaking heart  
Better than I ever knew  
And if you can live without my love  
Youre really gonna be alone  
And here am I  
Walking against the crowd  
Calling your name out loud my love  
Oh let it be just a state of mind  
And suddenly you appear  
  
Chorus  
  
Carried away  
Baby there aint no final word  
Ill be yours again  
I got a world of tenderness  
Yours until the end  
  
Chorus Repeats
