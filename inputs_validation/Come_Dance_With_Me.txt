Hey there cutes  
Put on your dancin boots  
And come dance with me  
Come dance with me  
What an evenin for  
Some terpsichore  
  
Pretty face  
I know a swingin place  
Come on dance with me  
Romance with me on a crowded floor  
  
And while the rhythm swings what lovely things Ill be sayin  
Cause what is dancin but makin love set to music playin  
  
When the band Begins to leave the stand  
And folks start to roam  
As we walk home Cheek to cheek well be  
So come on come on come on come on  
And dance with me  
  
Hey theres sweets  
Throw on those Latin beats  
And come dance with me  
What I mean is come on and my lets chachacha  
  
And leave your sweat and do the bango beat  
Come on dance with me  
Romance with me uh la la la la la  
I dont care what it has  
Cause that jargon jazz makes me move it  
  
And we charade when the band starts to groove it  
They groove it  
Come on by cause were set to fly  
And Ill let you lead  
  
If thats agreed youll know where Ill be  
So come on come on come on  
Come on come on come on  
Come on come on come on  
Come and dance with me  
Ill do the chachacha uh the merengue  
Well grow the tango  
Come on and dance with me
