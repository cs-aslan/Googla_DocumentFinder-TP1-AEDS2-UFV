Back in 86  
February and a special number  
I just had to know is this feeling real  
I picked up the phone  
I was one step closer to the danger zone  
I knew shed steal my heart away  
But I know I couldnt live without her love  
The first time she looked at me  
Her smile stayed on my mind  
I never thought Id ever meet  
A woman of her kind  
Now Im lost in a lovers daze  
And Im not walking out  
Gonna give my heart away  
And hope that she will always stay  
  
Call for me run to me  
Whenever you are lonely  
Call for me run to me my lady love  
  
Wont you come and show me that precious smile  
And maybe stay for a little while  
Close the door Toss the key  
Say you will always be my one and only  
  
Looking back it seems to me  
The message in her eyes  
Left a lasting spell on me  
A feeling I cant hide  
  
Now Im lost in a lovers daze  
And Im not walking out  
Gonna give my heart away  
And hope she will always stay  
  
Call for me run to me  
Whenever you are lonely  
Call for me run to me my lady love  
  
Wont you come and show me that precious smile  
And maybe stay for a little while  
Treat me to your sense of taste and style  
Together we can walk the miles  
  
Close the door toss the key  
Say that you will always be my one and only
