Can I reach you  
Are you there  
Can reach you  
Do you care  
Can I reach you  
If I let down my hair  
If I sit here and stare  
  
Can I reach you  
If I try  
Can I reach you  
If I cry  
Can I reach you  
If I show you my eyes  
If I wear my disguise  
Can I reach you  
  
Whatll it be  
Longing or sorrow  
Whatll it be  
Beauty or light  
Whatll it be  
Honesty passion  
Whatll it be  
Tonight  
  
Can you hear me  
Through the dark  
Can you hear me  
Where you are  
Can you hear me  
How I give you my soul  
How I swallow you whole  
Can you hear me  
  
Whatll it be  
Frailty or anger  
Whatll it be  
Purity or pride  
Whatll it be  
Sanity madness  
Whatll it be  
  
Can I reach you  
With my voice  
Can I reach you  
With my words  
Can I reach you  
With my dreams  
  
Will I be happy  
  
Whatll it be  
Longing or sorrow  
Whatll it be  
Beauty or light  
Whatll it be  
Honesty passion  
Whatll it be  
Tonight  
  
Whatll it be  
Frailty or anger  
Whatll it be  
Purity or pride  
Whatll it be  
Sanity madness  
Whatll it be
