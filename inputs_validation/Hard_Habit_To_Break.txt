I guess I thought youd be here forever  
Another illusion I chose to create  
You dont know what you got until its gone  
And I found out a little too late  
I was acting as if you were lucky to have me  
Doin you a favor I hardly knew you were there  
But then you were gone and it all was wrong  
Had no idea how much I cared  
  
Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to  
Should learn to live with it but I dont want to  
Being without you is all a big mistake  
Instead of getting easier its the hardest thing to take  
Im addicted to you babe youre a hard habit to break  
  
You found someone else you had every reason  
You know I cant blame you for runnin to him  
Two people together but livin alone  
I was spreading my love too thin  
After all of these years Im still tryin to shake it  
Doin much better they say that it just takes time  
But deep in the night its an endless fight  
I cant get you out of my mind  
  
Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to  
Should learn to live with it but I dont want to  
Being without you is all a big mistake  
Instead of getting easier its the hardest thing to take  
Im addicted to you babe youre a hard habit to break  
  
Cant go on just cant go on on cant go on  
Just cant go on on  
Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to  
Should learn to live with it but I dont want to  
Being without you is all a big mistake  
Instead of getting easier its the hardest thing to take  
Im addicted to you babe youre a hard habit to break  
  
Such a hard habit to break Im addicted to you  
Youre a hard habit to break  
Such a hard habit to break Im addicted to you  
Youre a hard habit to break  
Such a hard habit to break Im addicted to you
