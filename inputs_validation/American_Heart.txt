It beats like a drum down in New Orleans  
Sings like a Motown melody  
It dreams like California  
Bigger than a Texas sky  
It bleeds it scorns but it shines when times get hard  
You cant break an American heart  
  
Shes up before the sun on the run  
Another dollar another day another cup of coffee  
Thank you Lord  
For giving me one more  
She still leans on her dreams but it seems  
Sometimes shes the only one who still believes that life is hard  
So she takes it on with an American heart
