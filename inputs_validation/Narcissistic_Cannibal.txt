Dont wanna be sly and defile you  
Desecrate my mind and rely on you  
I just wanna break this crown  
But its hard when Im so run down  
  
And youre so cynical Narcissistic Cannibal  
Got to bring myself back from the dead  
  
Sometimes I hate the life I made  
Everythings wrong every time  
Pushing on I cant escape  
Everything that comes my way  
Is haunting me taking its sweet time  
  
Holding on Im lost in a haze  
Fighting life to the end of my days  
  
Dont wanna be rude but I have to  
Nothings good about the hell you put me through  
I just need to look around  
See that life that has come unbound  
  
And youre so cynical Narcissistic Cannibal  
Got to bring myself back from the dead  
  
Sometimes I hate the life I made  
Everythings wrong every time  
Pushing on I cant escape  
Everything that comes my way  
Is haunting me taking its sweet time  
  
Sometimes I hate the life I made  
Everythings wrong every time  
Pushing on I cant escape  
Everything that comes my way  
Is haunting me taking its sweet time  
  
Holding on Im lost in a haze  
Fighting life to the end of my days  
  
Holding on Im lost in a haze  
Fighting life to the end of my days
