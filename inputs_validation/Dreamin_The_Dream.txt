Theres a place  
I sometimes see you there  
Its a place that I visit  
Most every night  
And I see your face  
Your eyes tell me you still care  
But its suddenly over  
With mornings first light  
As the day begins  
This feeling is going strong  
Sometimes the only thing  
That keeps me going on  
And until you find  
Your own way back to me  
Ill be forever  
Dreamin the dream  
As the day begins  
This feeling is going strong  
Sometimes the only thing  
That keeps me going on  
And until you find  
Your own way back to me  
Ill be forever  
Dreamin the dream
