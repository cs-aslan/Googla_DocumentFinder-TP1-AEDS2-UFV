Isnt it strange that a gift could be an enemy  
Isnt it weird that a privilege could feel like a chore  
Maybe its me but this line isnt going anywhere  
Maybe if we looked hard enough we could find a backdoor  
Find yourself a backdoor  
  
I see you in line dragging your feet  
You have my sympathy  
The day you were born you were born free  
That is your privilege  
  
Isnt it strange that the man standing in front of me  
Doesnt have a clue why he is waiting or what hes waiting for  
Maybe its me but Im sick of wasting energy  
Maybe if I look in my heart I could find a backdoor  
Find yourself a backdoor  
  
I see you in line dragging your feet  
You have my sympathy  
The day you were born you were born free  
That is your privilege
