Dont wanna close my eyes  
I dont wanna fall asleep  
Cause Id miss you baby  
And I dont wanna miss a thing  
Know what I was thinkin  
What  
I I really dont think that the animal cracker  
Qualifies as a cracker  
Why  
Well cause its sweet which is an in suggest cookie  
And when you put a cheese on something  
Its sorta the finer characteristic  
Of what makes a cracker  
Why I thought of that I just  
Baby you have such sweet fillup talk  
Ya got like a little animal cracker Discovery channel thing  
Watch the gazelle as he grazes through the open plains  
Now look as the cheetah approaches  
Watch as he stalks his prey  
Now the gazelle is a little spooked  
He could head north to the manless peaks above or south  
The gazelle now faces mans most parlous question  
North or south way down tune in next week  
Baby do you think its possible  
That anyone else in this world  
Is doing this very same thing at this very same moment  
I hope so  
Otherwise what the hell are we trying to save  
Dont wanna close my eyes  
I dont wanna fall asleep  
Cause Id miss you baby  
And I dont wanna miss a thing
