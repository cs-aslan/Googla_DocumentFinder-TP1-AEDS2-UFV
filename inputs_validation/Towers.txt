LeighAnne  
You turn and I learn that the wall comes falling down  
Not a word only heard what my friends could tell me now  
I feel love when I see your face  
But all these scars I cant replace  
Shocked me hard hit me hard  
And I dont know what to say  
  
Perrie  
When you knock on my door  
And tell me you dont wanna fight  
Oh baby Im sure that Im not gonna fall this time oh  
  
Jesy  
You never brought me flowers  
Never held me in my darkest hours  
And you left it so late  
That my heart feels nothing nothing in towers  
Once we were made like towers  
Everything couldve been ours  
But you left it too late  
Now my heart feels nothing nothing at all oh oh oh oh  
  
Jade  
Its a shame youre to blame  
Cause once you owned my heart  
I remember feeling so high  
But Im right back at the start  
I still feel love when I see your face  
But all these tears I cant erase  
Sorry heart Im sorry heart  
But well have to start again  
  
Perrie  
So dont knock on my door and tell me you dont wanna fight  
Cause I heard it before and Im not going back this time  
Not going back this time  
  
Jade  
Oh you never brought me flowers  
Never held me in my darkest hours  
And you left it so late  
That my heart feels nothing nothing in towers  
Once we were made like towers  
Everything couldve been ours  
But you left it too late  
Now my heart feels nothing nothing at all  
  
All  
Oh oh oh oh  
Nothing at all oh oh oh  
  
LeighAnne  
When youre close I wanna change my mind  
But I remember you and what were like  
I dont wanna let you waste my time  
  
Jesy  
And you never brought me flowers  
Never held me in my darkest hours  
And you left it so late  
That my heart feels nothing nothing at all  
  
Perrie  
Once we were made like towers  
Everything couldve been ours  
But you left it too late n  
Now my heart feels nothing nothing at all  
  
Nothing at all  
Nothing at all  
  
Jesy  
Once we were built like towers  
Nothing at all  
We were built like towers  
Now my heart feels nothing at all
