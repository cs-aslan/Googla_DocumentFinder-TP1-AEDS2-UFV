I know these roads  
Each ridge  
And narrow bridge  
Each chevron  
Enticing me on  
Each warning sign  
I take in my stride  
  
I dont need more ammunition  
Ive got more than I can spend  
I dont dwell on things Im missing  
Im just pleased  
With the things Ive found  
  
I know these roads  
An old hand understands  
Above all I know whats  
Expected of me now  
Veering cliffwards  
  
I dont need more ammunition  
Ive got more than I can spend  
I dont dwell on things Im missing  
Im just pleased  
With the things Ive found  
With the things Ive found  
With the things Ive found  
Ive found  
  
Ive been crying  
It comes back on these salient days  
And it stays  
And it says   
Weve never really been away  
  
I dont need more ammunition  
Ive got more than I can spend  
I dont think of who Im missing  
Ive got no space and no time  
In my life anymore  
No space or time  
In my life anymore  
For revenge
