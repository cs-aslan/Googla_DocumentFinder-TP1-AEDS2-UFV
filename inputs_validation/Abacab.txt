Look up on the wall there on the floor  
Under the pillow behind the door  
Theres a crack in the mirror  
Somewhere theres a hole in a window pane  
Do you think Im to blame  
Tell me do you think Im to blame  
  
When we do it youre never there  
When you show it just stop and stare  
Abacab hes in anywhere  
Abacab  
  
If youre wrappin up the world  
Cause youve taken someone elses girl  
When they turn on the pillow  
Even when they answer the telephone  
Dont you think that by now  
Tell me dont you think that by now  
  
When we do it youre never there  
When you show it just stop and stare  
Abacab hes in anywhere  
Abacab doesnt really care  
  
Do you want it You got it Now you know  
Do you want it You got it Now you know  
  
Its an illusion Its a game  
Or reflection of someone elses name  
When you wake in the morning  
Wake and find youre covered in cellophane  
Well theres a hole in there somewhere  
Yeah theres a hole in there somewhere  
Baby theres a hole in there somewhere  
Now theres a hole in there somewhere  
  
When we do it youre never there  
When you show it you stop and stare  
Abacab hes in anywhere  
Abacab
