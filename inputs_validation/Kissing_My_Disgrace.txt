Cut her into little pieces  
Move her round the plate  
Knife and Fork Ill dream youre all talk  
Im kissing my disgrace  
Kissing my disgrace  
Older fragments with no meaning  
Cloaked her smiling face  
Today I eat myself a breakfast  
Im kissing my Disgrace  
Cut her into little pieces  
Move her round the plate  
Knife and Fork Ill dream youre all talk  
Im kissing my disgrace  
Kissing my disgrace repeated
