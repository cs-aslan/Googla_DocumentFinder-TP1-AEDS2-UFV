Lord Please guide my steps  
I commit my way to You  
I wont make a move until I hear Your voice   
  
Dont wanna make a move  
  
I gotta be on guard cause  
Who knows whats in the shadows  
To try and keep me off of this road  
And lead me astray  
I want every step to be in the right place  
At the right time  
So Im searching for You Lord  
To guide me every day  
  
I dont wanna make a move with the faith  
Dont wanna make a move without the light of truth  
In the twist and turns along the way  
I dont I dont wanna make a move without You  
  
You got me when I woke up today  
I was turning through the pages  
Looking for some Wisdom that might show me  
Where You lead  
Nothing short of You will satisfy my hunger  
You can hear me crying out every night  
From down on my knees  
  
I dont wanna make a move with the faith  
Dont wanna make a move without the light of truth  
In the twist and turns along the way  
I dont I dont wanna make a move without You  
  
In the still and quiet  
I bow my heart  
Incline my ear  
Anything You whisper Lord  
I want to hear  
Lord I need to hear You  
  
I dont wanna make a move with the faith  
Dont wanna make a move without the light of truth  
In the twist and turns along the way  
I dont I dont wanna make a move without You  
  
I will follow You  
Gonna do what You tell me to  
I need You  
I will follow you Jesus
