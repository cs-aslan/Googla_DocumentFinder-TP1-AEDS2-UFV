City streets at night  
Can be so intimidating  
Im not the toughest guy  
I gotta keep my eyes open  
You came out of nowhere  
  
Chorus  
Man you really freak me out  
Im so afraid of you  
And when I lose my cool  
I dont know what to do  
I know you dont mean no harm  
Your just doing your thing  
But man you really freak me out  
  
Did I hurt you  
Are you okay  
Can I buy you a drink  
Ohhh whats the world coming to  
You came out of nowhere  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gonna try to improve my manners manners  
Everyone yes everyone is my friend  
  
City streets at night city streets at night  
City streets at night city streets at night  
Til the morning light til the morning light  
City streets at night city streets at night  
  
Chorus
