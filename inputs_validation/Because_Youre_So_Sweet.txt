Because youre so sweet  
You lift up my heart  
And I fall back again  
But I dont know  
Quite which way to turn  
  
The light in your eyes  
Touches the sky  
And Im your man again  
And you hold me  
As close as close can be  
  
And manys the time  
That youve enchanted me  
Now I want you back  
Here in my lovin arms  
For eternity  
  
You look and you smile  
Warm me inside  
Cause youre so good to me  
A beauty  
Filled with the joys of spring  
  
No love is too pure  
To give to the world  
In her naivety  
Or too tender  
To caress with a simple kiss  
  
And manys the time  
That youve enchanted me  
Now I want you back I want you back  
Here in my lovin arms  
For eternity  
  
And manys the time  
That youve enchanted me  
I want you back I want you back  
Back in my lovin arms  
For eternity
