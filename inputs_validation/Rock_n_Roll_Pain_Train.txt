15 years on this lonely road  
I paid my own way  
I carried my own load  
I never ask too much from no one  
  
I was much too proud  
All I ever wanted  
Was to play my music for a sold out crowd  
Bitches money fame  
  
They say I had it all  
6 foot 1  
I walked around like I was 10 feet tall  
Did you see me shine  
  
Where the hell were you now  
Detroit City back in 99  
Stoned out of my mind  
On that rock n roll pain train  
  
I had to slow things down  
I live out in the woods now  
It helps me keep my feet on the ground  
Lifes been good to me so far  
  
Hope its been kind to you  
Stand strong in the storms of life  
The sun will always shine on you  
Now Ive been rollin on love and lust  
  
I ride around on this million dollar bus  
But this bus is just a bus man  
I cant sleep at night  
Man I miss my babies  
  
And Id really like to fuck my wife  
But she aint here tonight  
On that rock n roll pain train  
After the lights go down  
  
I live out in the woods now  
It helps me keep my feet on the ground  
Lifes been good to me so far  
Hope its been kind to you  
  
Stand strong in the storms of life  
The sun will always shine on you  
Ive seen this train wreck  
Time and time again  
  
I felt Its pain  
Ive seen it take my friends  
Youve got to stop and take a look man  
Or life will pass you by  
  
Get you a guitar and a good song  
Thats all you really need to ride  
On that rock n roll pain train  
I cant slow it down  
  
The music and the whiskey  
Dont it make you want to get loud  
Lifes been good to me so far  
Hope Its been kind to you  
  
Stand strong in the storms of life  
The sun will always shine on you  
The sun will always shine on you
