You dont give out you dont give in  
You never seem to be attracted to the sin  
The sin of love the sin of all above  
I give you my advice it can be nice  
I know you cant solve the problems of the world  
But you dont have to be a precious little toy  
Do something do something  
Ill wait a day Ill wait a week  
And I dont just want to be dancing cheek to cheek  
Its serious this thing I need to do  
Win or lose its all up to you  
I cant believe that you could let me go this far  
It cant be natural to be the way you are  
Do something do something  
Ive got this weakness Im losing power  
I need your sweetness right here and now yeah  
Deeper and deeper hour after hour  
I should be ruling but Im not satisfied no no  
Not satisfied Im not satisfied  
When Im alone cant do it on the phone  
Wont let you go until I get just what I need  
My heart is breaking oh baby baby please  
Do something do something baby baby okay  
Come on come on come on do something  
Get down on your knees and do something  
Oh baby please do something
