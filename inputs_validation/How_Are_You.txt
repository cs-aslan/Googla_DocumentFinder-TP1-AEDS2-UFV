Its been a while I havent seen you for at least  
A year or more or is it less I cant be sure  
Well anyway you must have heard about the  
Troubles that I had but somehow I got through  
I always managed to and by the way  
How are you  
How is your life  
How is it going  
Are you still dreaming and making big plans  
How are the nights are they still lonely  
Are you still struggling the way that I am Oh  
How how are you How are you  
  
You always said that you would try to change  
Turn a new leaf and start all over again  
But I bet youre making all the same mistakes  
Youre a lot like me thats why Im still your friend  
Still no offence no more hard feelings left on silly sentiment  
No harm was ever felt or ever meant  
You go your way Im bound to see you on the street again some day  
And when I do Ill always say  
How are you How are you  
  
How is your life How is it going  
Are you still dreaming and making big plans  
How are the nights Are they still lonely  
Are you still struggling the way that I am Oh  
How how are you How are you  
  
I know youre making all the same mistakes  
Youre a lot like me thats why Im still your friend  
I bet go I gotta thousand little things I better do  
Ah but it was really good to talk to you  
Be on my way Im bound to see you on the street again someday  
And when I do Ill say  
How are you How are you  
  
How is your life How is it going  
Are you still dreaming and making big plans  
How are the nights Are they still lonely  
Are you still struggling the way that I am Oh  
How how are you How are you
