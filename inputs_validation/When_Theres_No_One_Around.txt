This is a song that nobody knows  
I couldnt begin to describe how it goes  
But it makes me cry or laugh right out loud  
Its a song that I sing when theres no one around  
This is the man that nobody sees  
He wears my old clothes and he looks just like me  
Just one of the boys who gets lost in the crowd  
Hes the man that I am when theres no one around  
Its four in the morning  
Im lyin in bed  
A tape of my failures  
Playin inside my head  
Its heartaches and hard knocks  
And things I dont know  
I listen and I wonder  
Where will it go  
This is a glimpse of the child thats within  
Hes so immature but hes still my best friend  
If he could learn how to fly hed never touch down  
Hes the kid that I am when theres no one around  
This is the dance I do every day  
I let my feet go and get carried away  
I let my soul lead and follow the sound  
Its the dance that I do when theres no one around  
Its four in the morning  
Im lyin in bed  
A tape of my failures  
Playin inside my head  
Its heartaches and hard knocks  
And things I dont know  
I listen and I wonder  
Where will it go  
Thi is a song that nobody knows  
I still cant begin to describe how it goes  
But it makes me cry our laugh right out loud  
Its a song that I sing when theres no one around  
Its a song that I sing when theres no one around
