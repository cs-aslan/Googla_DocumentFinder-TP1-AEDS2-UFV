I had it all  
But I let it slip away  
Couldnt see that I treated you wrong  
Now I wander around  
Feeling down and cold  
Trying to believe that youre gone  
  
Love takes time  
To heal when youre hurting so much  
Couldnt see that I was blind  
To let you go  
I cant escape the pain  
Inside  
Love takes time  
I dont want to be here alone  
Losing my mind  
  
From this hollow in my heart  
Suddenly Im so incomplete  
Lord Im needing you now  
Tell me how to stop the rain  
Tears are falling down endlessly  
  
Love takes time  
To heal when youre hurting so much  
Couldnt see that I was blind  
To let you go  
I cant escape the pain  
Inside  
Love takes time  
  
I dont want to be here alone  
You might say that its over  
You might say that you dont care  
You might say you dont miss me  
You dont need me  
But I know that you do and I feel that you do  
  
Inside  
Love takes time  
To heal when youre hurting so much  
Couldnt see that I was blind  
To let you go  
I cant escape the pain  
Inside  
Love takes time  
I dont want to be here alone
