You make me nervous when youre flying around  
The secret service couldnt track you down  
You tell me no then you kiss me  
You say hello then you ditch me  
You try to run when you see me  
  
I never knew what this dream was about  
You say lets go then youre lost in the crowd  
I dont know where youre going  
You wont show then youre showing  
I dont know then Im knowing  
  
Youre always busy when I call on the phone  
Stop stop  
Im broken hearted are you made out of stone  
Stop stop  
Snakes alive why you grievin  
Its six to five and Im leavin  
I cant stand no more teasin  
  
I wrote a letter letter I couldnt get her get her  
Some other fella fella was going to tell her tell her  
This kind of weather weather you need a sweater sweater  
Its geting wetter wetter drink Amaretto retto  
  
Light as a feather feather  
Aint no one better better  
You wearing leather leather  
Aint nothing better better  
  
Im going to renta a renta a  
Spiffy Lambretta bretta  
I want to wed her wed her  
The day I met her  
  
Love me hug me shove me you blow me away  
You bug me snub me club me you fill me with with praise  
You tell me this way or that way  
But take it thin way or fat way  
I say its my way or highway  
  
Youre always busy when I call on the phone  
Stop stop  
Im broken hearted are you made out of stone  
Stop stop  
Snakes alive why you grievin  
Its six to five and Im leavin  
I cant stand no more teasin
