You ask me how Im feeling  
I only wish you knew  
How hard it is for me to share  
Share that kind of thing with you  
  
Its not that I dont love you  
Its just I cant connect  
Cause I was taught from much too young  
To shine and not reflect  
  
And if you sense a smoke screen here  
A trick of the dry ice  
Just try to see theres more to me  
Than sour grapes and sugar mice  
  
Just try to understand  
I dont say all I can  
A stranger to myself I am  
An accidental man  
  
You ask me if Im happy  
I only wish I knew  
Cause happiness is not a thing  
I ever learned to do  
  
Its not that Im complaining  
Its all the same to me  
If everything that happens  
Happens accidentally  
  
Just try to understand  
I dont say all I can  
A stranger to myself I am  
An accidental man  
A stranger to myself I am  
An accidental man  
  
I was taught for every secret  
Theres a price you have to pay  
Yes I was taught for every secret  
Theres a price you have to pay  
I was taught from much too young  
To never give myself away  
  
Just try to understand  
I dont say all I can  
A stranger to myself I am  
An accidental man  
Just try to understand  
I dont do all I can  
A mystery to burnedout love  
An accidental man
