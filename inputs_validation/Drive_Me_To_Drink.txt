Tonight do me a favor  
On your way to do me wrong  
Drop me at a honky tonk  
Dont leave me here alone  
I washed and waxed the car today  
I even filled the tank  
If youre gonna drive me crazy  
Drive me to drink  
  
All the mothers and your lovers  
Will be happy I suppose  
Youll be in his arms again  
And Ill be off the road  
The highway will be safer  
And theyll have you to thank  
If youre gonna drive me crazy baby  
Drive me to drink  
  
Youre in the drivers seat  
Its all up to you  
Ill be your dedicated man  
Or your designated fool  
  
But if youre hellbent  
And bound to bolt  
I cant change the way you think  
If youre gonna drive me crazy baby  
Drive me to drink  
  
Youre in the drivers seat  
Its all up to you  
Ill be your dedicated man  
Or your designated fool  
  
But if youre hellbent  
And bound to bolt  
I cant change the way you think  
If youre gonna drive me crazy baby  
Drive me to drink  
  
Well if youre gonna drive me crazy baby  
Drive me to drink
