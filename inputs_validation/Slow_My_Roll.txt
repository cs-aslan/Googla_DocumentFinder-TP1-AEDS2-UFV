Theres a new day on the horizon  
Theres a rising in the air  
Somewhere somebodys tryin to tell me they care  
So Im a lift my head to a new day  
Plant my feet on the ground  
Look at life in a new way and whats goin down  
Cause todays the day Im gonna take things slow  
Try and change my ways forgive and let all that go  
Tell the ones I love what they need to know  
Im gonna turn around settle down  
And slow my roll  
Mixin loneliness and whiskey  
Heartache and cocaine  
Livin life like a gypsy lost and ashamed  
So Im a look to the Lord as my witness  
Rest my hat on a shelf  
Trade these boots for forgiveness and find myself  
Cause todays the day Im gonna take things slow  
Try to change my ways forgive and let all that go  
Tell the ones I love cause they need to know  
Im gonna turn around settle down  
And I cant believe sixteen has long since past  
Cause Im tired of runnin and never looking back  
And I wont survive if I live this life this fast no no  
And todays the day Im gonna take things slow  
Change my ways forgive and let all that go  
Tell the ones I love what they need to know  
Im gonna turn around settle down  
And slow my roll  
Slow my roll slow my roll
