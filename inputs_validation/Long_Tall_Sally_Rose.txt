Well tonight Im gonna wear my dancin shoes  
Cause I heard the word and I heard the news  
Theres a gal in town shes packin em in  
If youve seen her once youll see her again  
  
Shes got a red hot dynamite band  
Theyre burnin down another onenight stand  
Headlinin double shows  
Everybody go see Sally Rose  
  
She sure knows how to rock the crowd  
Rocks em slow rocks em loud  
So you better move fast cause tickets are tight  
If you want to see Sally Rose pick it tonight
