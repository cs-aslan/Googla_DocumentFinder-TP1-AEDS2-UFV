How can I ever forget you  
You dont know just what Ive been through  
The holiday we spent together  
Lives with me now and forever  
  
I tried but I cant find you  
Tell me now what do I do  
I tried but I cant find you  
Tell me now what do I do  
  
I cant find my piece of mind  
Because I need you with me all of the time  
I used to think about you night and day  
I used to feel what language cannot say  
Oh I cant find you  
No I cant find my piece of mind without you  
  
Maybe youd write me a letter  
And tell me why I never met you  
Our rendezvous just ended in sorrow  
Without you theres no tomorrow  
  
I tried but I cant find you  
Tell me now what do I do  
I tried but I cant find you  
Tell me now what do I do  
  
I cant find my piece of mind  
Because I need you with me all of the time  
I used to think about you night and day  
I didnt care what other people would say  
  
Oh I cant find you  
No I cant find my piece of mind without you  
I cant find my piece of mind  
Because I need you with me all of the time  
  
I used to think about you night and day  
I used to feel what language cannot say  
Oh I cant find you  
No I cant find my piece of mind without you  
  
Ibiza Majorca and Benidorm too  
Ive searched all these places but never found you
