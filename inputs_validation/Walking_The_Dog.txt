Walking alone cause the night is dead  
Crossed my mind when I crossed the bridge  
  
How you lost your mind and your wrist got bruised  
And you wanted better love when its sleeping in your bedroom  
Hold on stay on my side dont go  
  
If you could see me whoever I am its not like a movie but its not all skin
and bones  
So come on lovecome on come on come all and go  
  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go  
  
Now Im walking alone cause the night is dead  
My feet dont glide like they did back then  
When I would call you up so we could shoot the moon  
These days Im left to howl in toon  
  
Hearts do break and I must admit Ive got a better set of chords so I
mightve been fakin it  
Think I really cried just once so  
  
If you could see me whoever I am its not like a movie but its not all skin
and bones  
So come on lovecome on come on come all and go  
  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go  
  
After all the shows after the boys of summer will go  
Amid all the confusion  
These friends Ive been losin  
I always thought from the start  
Id be the one moving on  
I guess Ill never know  
Where all the boys of summer will go  
But Ill miss what we made  
All those days were not wasted  
There are some things I may never know  
  
How you lost your mind and your wrist got bruised  
And you wanted better love when its sleeping in your bedroom  
Hold on stay on my side dont go  
  
If you could see me whoever I am its not like a movie but its not all skin
and bones  
So come on lovecome on come on come all and go  
  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go  
  
If you could see me whoever I am its not like a movie but its not all skin
and bones  
So come on lovecome on come on come all and go  
  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go  
  
Walking alone cause the night is dead  
If you could see me whoever I am  
Crossed my mind when I crossed the bridge  
Its not like a movie but its not all skin and bones  
Walking alone cause the night is dead  
So come on lovecome on come on come all and go  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go
