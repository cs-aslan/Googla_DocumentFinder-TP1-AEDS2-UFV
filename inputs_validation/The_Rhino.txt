My head hits the pillow starts to snore  
I dont wanna talk to you no more  
I can smell a rat I dont need to see  
So dont try to pull the wool down on me  
They call me the rhino when I get this way  
You can call me again maybe some othe day  
Ohh oh yeah  
  
Im deep in a dream deep in the trees  
Im doing my thing with the chimpanzees  
Theres somebody watching you everywhere  
Except in your dreams they cant see you in there  
At least not yet though someday they will try  
And on that day theyll see the rhino can fly
