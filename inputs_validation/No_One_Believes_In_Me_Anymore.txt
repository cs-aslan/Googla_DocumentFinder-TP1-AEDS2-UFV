Oh my job keeps getting easier  
As time keeps slipping away  
  
I can imitate your brightest light  
And make your night look just like day  
I put some truth in every lie  
To tickle itching ears  
You know Im drawing people just like flies  
Cause they like what they hear  
  
Im gaining power by the hour  
Theyre falling by the score  
You know its getting very simple now  
Cause no one believe in me anymore  
  
Oh heavens just a state of mind  
My books read on your shelf  
And have you heard that God is dead  
I made that one up myself  
They dabble in magic spells  
They get their fortunes read  
You know they heard the truth  
But turned away and followed me instead  
  
I used to have to sneak around  
But now they just open their doors  
You know no ones watching for my tricks  
Because no one believes in me anymore  
  
Everyone likes a winner  
With my help youre guaranteed to win  
And hey man you aint no sinner  
Youve got the truth within  
And as your life slips by  
You believe the lie that you did it on your own  
But dont worry  
Ill be there to help you share our dark eternal home  
  
Oh my job keeps getting easier  
As day slips into day  
The magazines the newspapers  
Print every word I say  
This world is just my spinning top  
Its all like childsplay  
You know I dream that it will never stop  
But I know its not that way  
  
Still my work goes on and on  
Always stronger than before  
Im gonna make it dark before the dawn  
Since no one believes in me anymore  
Well now I used to have to sneak around  
But now they just open their doors  
You know no one watches for my tricks  
Since no one believes in me anymore  
  
Well Im gaining power by the hour  
Theyre falling by the score  
You know its getting very easy now  
Since no one believes in me anymore  
No one believes in me anymore  
No one believes in me anymore
