She feeds her face with cheddar balls  
As my brain cells start to pop  
She licks her fingers stares away  
Her IQ slowly drops  
I pry my eyes as best I can  
From that big electric stain  
She feeds her face with cheddar balls  
And crams more nonsense in her brain

Just when I thought Id seen it all  
They pull a cretin from the shelves  
And flash that filth under their nails  
To make us feel better about ourselves  
As they ooze across the screen  
Like a pustule gutter troll  
We fill our coffers full of gold  
And praise the skill of Asshole

Well that ones fit for a dad  
Well that one had more babies

And that one want to be president  
Cause shes got more eye appeal
