Cut the skin to the bone  
Fall asleep all alone  
Hear your voice in the dark  
Lose myself in your eyes  
Choke my voice Say goodnight  
As the world falls apart  
Fuck I cant let this kill me let go  
I need some more time to fix this  
  
Heres a letter for you  
But the words get confused  
And the conversation dies  
Apologize for the past  
Talk some shit take it back  
Are we cursed to this life  
  
Fuck I cant let this kill me let go  
I need some more time to fix this problem  
I need some more time to fix this problem  
I need some more time to fix this  
  
Im talking to the ceiling  
My life just lost all meaning  
Do one thing for me tonight  
Im dying in this silence  
  
The last star left in heaven  
Is falling down to earth and  
Do you still feel the same way  
Do you still feel the same way  
  
Fuck I cant let this kill me let go  
I need some more time to fix this problem  
I need some more time to fix this problem  
I need some more time to fix this
