Chorus  
Falling from grace falling from grace  
Lord you have a pretty face  
Take it away and pack it in a suitcase  
Then forget about falling from grace  
  
Dont look at me like that I never said a word  
Dont ask me where Ive been Ill pretend I never heard  
Dont put it in the paper please dont  
I never said I will I never said I wont  
  
Chorus  
  
Its looking bad I know Im an outlaw  
Dont pity me I never felt like this before  
Please tell me you believe me please say  
Ill get along without you anyway  
  
Chorus  
  
Feeling hunted Im lying low  
Dont tell me who it is I never said so  
Put yourself in my place please try  
I never told the truth I never told a lie  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Repeats  
Falling from grace  
Falling from grace falling from grace
