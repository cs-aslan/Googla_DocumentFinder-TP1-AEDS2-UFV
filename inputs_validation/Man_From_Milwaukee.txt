It started at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere  
Sitting beside me was a man with no hair  
From the look on his face and the size of his toes  
He comes from a place that nobody knows  
  
Maybe Im hallucinating hyperventilating  
Letting this bigtoed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky  
Maybe Im hallucinating hyperventilating  
If you asked me now then I couldnt tell you why  
  
Ive been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee  
Hes been talking too long on his yellow walkie talkie  
Hes been talking to Mars but I think hes wacky  
He says theyll come get him come get him some day  
  
He says where hes from is called Albertane  
There they use more than ten percent of the brain  
But you couldnt tell it from they way they behave  
They run around in underwear and they never shave  
  
Or maybe Im hallucinating hyperventilating  
Letting this bigtoed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky  
Maybe Im hallucinating hyperventilating  
If you asked me now then I couldnt tell you why  
  
This is Mother Bird calling Baby Bird  
Baby Bird come in come in Baby Bird  
  
For the love of Pete come in  
This is Baby Bird sorry I was watching Court TV  
Do you copy Do you copy  
Of course we copy twenty four hours a day in color  
  
You wouldnt believe me if I told you the rest  
The man sitting by me who was barely dressed  
Flew off to Milwaukee or perhaps Albertane  
And left me at the bus stop just barely sane  
  
Ive been sitting here too long thinkin about Milwaukee  
Ive been talking too long on my yellow walkie talkie  
Im talking to Mars you may think Im wacky  
I know theyll come get me come get me someday  
I know theyll come get me and take me away  
I know theyll come get me come get me someday  
If not tomorrow then maybe today
