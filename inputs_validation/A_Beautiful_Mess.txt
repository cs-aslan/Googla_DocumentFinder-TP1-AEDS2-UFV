Youve got the best of both worlds  
Youre the kind of girl who can take down a man  
And lift him back up again  
You are strong but youre needy  
Humble but youre greedy  
Based on your body language  
And Shoddy cursive Ive been reading  
Your style is quite selective  
Though your mind is rather reckless  
Well I guess it just suggests  
That this is just what happiness is  
  
Chorus  
And what a beautiful mess this is  
Its like picking up trash in dresses  
  
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write  
Kind of turn themselves into knives  
And dont mind my nerve you could call it fiction  
But I like being submerged in your contradictions dear  
Cause here we are here we are  
  
Although you are biased I love your advice  
Your comebacks theyre quick  
And probably have to do with your insecurities  
Theres no shame in being crazy  
Depending on how you take these  
Words Im paraphrasing this relationship were staging  
  
Chorus  
And what a beautiful mess this is  
Its like picking up trash in dresses  
  
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say  
Kind of turn themselves into blades  
Kind and courteous is the life Ive heard  
But its nice to say that we played in the dirt  
Cause here here we are Here we are  
  
X7  
Here we are  
  
Were still here  
  
Chorus  
And what a beautiful mess this is  
Its like taking a guess when the only answer is yes  
  
And through timeless words and priceless pictures  
Well fly like birds not of this earth  
And tides they turn and hearts disfigure  
But thats no concern when were wounded together  
And weve torn our dresses and stained our shirts  
But its nice today oh the wait was so worth it
