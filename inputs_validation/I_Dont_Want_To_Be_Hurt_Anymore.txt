I dont want to be hurt anymore  
By a parttime love affair  
And I dont want to cry like before  
Why pretend again you care  
Please dont coax me back into your arms  
Ive been fooled many times byy your charms  
I know if I kissed you  
I might not resist you  
I dont want to be hurt anymore  
Please dont coax me back into your arms  
Ive been fooled many times byy your charms  
I know if I kissed you  
I might not resist you  
I dont want to be hurt anymoreore
