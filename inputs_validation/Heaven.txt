If heaven aint a lot like Detroit  
I dont want to go  
If heaven aint a lot like Detroit  
Id just a soon stay home  
If they aint got no 8 mile  
Like they do in the D  
Just send me to hell or Salt Lake City  
It would be about the same to me  
  
it would be about the same to me  
Detroit city from Aretha to Aaliyah  
to Bob Segar to  
Joe Louis n his arena an now on me  
Paradime the mic of overachievers  
Smokin sewer cops bottom feeders  
and parking meters  
  
A bunch of bad dude in the mad brew and tattoos  
So think twice before you pass through  
Or get clapped through wack crews get hurt  
We can take you for a ride or take you for your shirt  
I did it in the Bronx I did it in Queens  
And you can see me do it down in New Orleans  
Fat backs n greens Im a scene of amazement  
Youll be picking all your teeth up off the fucking pavement  
Is that Kracker with a see  
Naw Kracker with a K  
  
Kracker mother fucker all god damn day  
You could take Gratiot south but thats a real rough route  
Youll get found face down with your pockets hangin out  
If heaven aint a lot like Detroit  
I dont want to go  
If heaven aint a lot like Detroit  
Id just a soon stay home  
If they aint got no 8 mile  
Like they do in the D  
Just send me to hell or Salt Lake City  
It would be about the same to me  
it would be about the same to me

Got a bullet head a dick with a 30 odd 6  
And from a thousand yards Ill hit ya right in the lipsshit

Heres four fingers kiss my fuckin diamonds

Im a whinin linin rhymin son of a bitch  
Im the song of a shotguns unsung cry  
And Im the only MC thatll never die

Or look for the dog with the fade in the chain yeah  
If heaven aint a lot like Detroit  
I dont want to go  
If heaven aint a lot like Detroit  
Id just a soon stay home  
If they aint got no 8 mile

See Ill never be touched cause Im outta reach  
Call me Kracker just be fuckin up spots like bleach  
Worst in my division I got bitches on file  
From the Mississippi river on back to Belle Isle  
  
I got style but it doesnt show  
I got more love for Detroit than youll ever know  
I I I I know cats that sling  
Crack n cats that scrap  
Cats that bust beer bottles over baseball caps  
  
Cats that get drunk and like to spark up skull  
Cats that keep sawed offs chillin up in the trunk trunk trunk  
Whores an 4 4s n scoops n blow  
  
And fuck Faygo bitch we pound cans of Strohs  
We run the mitten from the river way up to the farms  
Thats why we got these fuckin Ds tattooed on our arms  
If heaven aint a lot like Detroit  
I dont want to go  
If heaven aint a lot like Detroit  
Id just a soon stay home  
If they aint got no 8 mile  
Like they do in the D  
  
Just send me to hell or Salt Lake City  
It would be about the same to me
