Valleri I love my Valleri  
Theres a girl I know who makes me feel so good  
And I wouldnt live without her even if I could  
They call her Valleri  
I love my Valleri  
  
Shes the same little girl who used to hang around my door  
But she sure looks different than the way she looked before  
I call her Valleri  
I love my Valleri  
  
Valleri I love my Valleri  
I love my Valleri  
I need ya Valleri
