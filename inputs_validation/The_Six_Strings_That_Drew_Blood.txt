Guitar thug blew into town  
His eyes like wheels spinnin round  
Jerkinoff at every sound  
Layin all his crosses down  
O yeah  
He got Six Strings  
The Six Strings that drew blood  
The bar is full of HolyJoes  
A Holyholeawholearia  
Around the neck of our consumptive rose  
Is the root of all his sorrows  
O yeah  
He got Six Strings  
Six Strings that drew blood  
A Holyholeawholearia  
Six Strings that drew blood  
In the bathroom under cover  
He turns on one tap to discover  
Hes smashed his teeth out on the other  
Well he look in the mirror and say  
Dont fuck me brother  
Cause I got Six Strings  
Six Strings that drew blood  
Numbin the runt of reputation they call rat fame  
TopE as a tourniquet  
A low tune whistles across his grave  
Forever the master and the slave of his Six Strings  
A Holyholeawholearia  
Six Strings that drew blood
