Never been so lonesome  
Writer hank williams  
Now the day you left and went away  
The mean ole blues walked in to stay  
I feel like a child without a home  
Come back baby Im all alone  
I aint never been so lonesome in my life before  
The day you packed and went away  
I never thought that I would stay  
I miss you honey and Im lonesome too  
Never thought a soul could be so blue  
Aint been so lonesome in my life before  
I need a little lovin my heart is sick and sore  
Why you left I dont know why  
And if you stay away I know Ill die  
Aint been so lonesome in my life before
