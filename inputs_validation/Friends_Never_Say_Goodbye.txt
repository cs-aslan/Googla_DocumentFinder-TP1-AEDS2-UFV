There isnt much I havent shared  
With you along the road  
And through it all thered always be  
Tomorrows episode  
  
Suddenly that isnt true  
Theres another avenue  
Beckoning the great divide  
Ask no questions take no side  
  
Whos to say whos right or wrong  
Whose course is braver run  
Still we are have always been  
Will ever be as one  
  
What is done has been done for the best  
Though the mist in my eyes might suggest  
Just a little confusion about what Ill lose  
But if I started over I know I would choose  
  
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way  
That fought me and tought me that friends never say  
  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
  
Suddenly that isnt true  
Theres another avenue  
Beckoning the great divide  
I would choose  
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way  
That fought me and taught me that friends never say  
  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye
