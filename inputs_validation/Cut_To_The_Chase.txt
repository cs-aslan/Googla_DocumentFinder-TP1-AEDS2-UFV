It is the fire that lights itself  
But it burns with a restless flame  
The arrow on a moving target  
The archer must be sure of his aim  
  
It is the engine that drives itself  
But it chooses the uphill climb  
A bearing on magnetic north  
Growing farther away all the time  
Cant stop  moving  
Cant stop  moving  
Cant stop  
  
You may be right  
Its all a waste of time  
I guess thats just a chance  
Im prepared to take  
A danger Im prepared to face  
Cut to the chase  
  
It is the rocket that ignites itself  
And launches its way to the stars  
A driver on a busy freeway  
Racing the oblivious cars  
  
Its the motor of the western world  
Spinning off to every extreme  
Pure as a lovers desire  
Evil as a murderers dream  
  
Young enough not to care too much  
About the way things used to be  
Im young enough to remember the future  
The past has no claim on me  
  
Im old enough not to care too much  
About what you think of me  
But Im young enough to remember the future  
And the way things ought to be  
  
What kind of difference  
Can on person make  
Cut to the chase
