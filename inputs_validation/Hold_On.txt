I know theres pain  
Why do lock yourself up in these chains  
No one can change your life except for you  
Dont ever let anyone step all over you  
Just open your heart and your mind  
Is it really fair to feel this way inside  
  
Some day somebodys gonna make you want to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
Until then baby are you going to let them  
Hold you down and make you cry  
Dont you know  
Dont you know things can change  
Thingsll go your way  
If you hold on for one more day  
Can you hold on for one more day  
Thingsll go your way  
Hold on for one more day  
  
You could sustain  
Or are you comfortable with the pain  
Youve got no one to blame for your unhappiness  
You got yourself into your own mess  
Lettin your worries pass you by  
Dont you think its worth your time  
To change your mind  
  
Some day somebodys gonna make you want to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
Until then baby are you going to let them  
Hold you down and make you cry  
Dont you know  
Dont you know things can change  
Thingsll go your way  
If you hold on for one more day  
Can you hold on for one more day  
Thingsll go your way  
Hold on for one more day  
  
I know that there is pain  
But you hold on for one more day and  
Break free the chains  
Yeah I know that there is pain  
But you hold on for one more day and you  
Break free break from the chains  
  
Some day somebodys gonna make you want to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
Until then baby are you going to let them  
Hold you down and make you cry  
Dont you know  
Dont you know things can change  
Thingsll go your way  
If you hold on for one more day yeah
