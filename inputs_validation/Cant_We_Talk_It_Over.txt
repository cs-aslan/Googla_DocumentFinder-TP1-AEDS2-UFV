We were so in love the day love started  
Who would think that we would soon be parted  
I just cant believe its true  
I make this appeal to you  
  
Cant we talk it over Lets talk it over  
Before you tell me youre through  
Cant we sit together and figure whether  
This is the right thing to do  
  
I hate the thought of spending nights all alone  
Missing the thrill of nights that weve known  
Cant we talk it over before its over  
Before you whisper goodbye forever lets talk it over dear  
  
I hate the thought of spending nights all alone  
Missing the thrill of nights that weve known  
Cant we talk it over before its over  
Before you whisper goodbye forever lets talk it over dear
