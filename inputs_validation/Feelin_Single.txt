I cant believe youre playing me like this  
I thought the love we shared the good times we had remember  
Yeah  
  
Feels like its over  
My heart tells me shes in love with someone else  
Gave me the cold shoulder  
But this I lost cause I can find me somebody else  
  
If she wanna hit the town  
And party all night with her friends  
If she wanna fool around  
Then two can play that game baby  
  
You got me feeling single  
About to give up  
Find somebody  
Whos gonna love me girl  
Feeling single  
Night is young  
Hit the club  
Take somebody home with me  
  
Get it get it  
Get it get it  
We can get it baby  
Get it get it  
Now Im better single  
  
She said forever  
Turned out to be the biggest lie  
Of all time  
And she changed my weather  
Rainin all day  
No chance of sunshine  
  
If she wanna hit the town  
And party all night with her friends  
If she wanna fool around  
Then two can play that game baby  
  
You got me feeling single  
Feeling single  
About to give up  
Find somebody  
Whos gonna love me  
Feeling single  
Night is young  
Hit the club  
And take somebody home with me  
  
Get it get it  
Get it get it  
Till the morning baby  
Get it get it  
Now Im feeling single  
  
The way I see it girl not gonna do right  
About me baby girl  
And I might as well I might as well  
I might as well get out and mingle girl  
Cause you got you got you got me feeling single  
  
Yeah  
And I dont wanna do it baby  
But youre gonna make me  
Find somebody  
Whos gonna love me  
Treat me right baby  
Be in my house in my room in my bed in my arms at night baby  
And shes gonna love me baby  
And shes gonna give all lovin lovin baby
