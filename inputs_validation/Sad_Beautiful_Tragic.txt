Long handwritten note deep in your pocket  
Words how little they mean when youre a little too late  
I stood right by the tracks your face in a locket  
Good girls hopeful theyll be and lonely well wait  
  
We had a beautiful magic love affair  
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair  
  
In dreams I meet you in long conversation  
We both wake in lonely beds and different cities  
And time is ticking a sweet summer race in you  
And youve got your demons and darling they all look like me  
  
Cause we had a beautiful magic love affair  
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair  
  
Distance timing break down fighting  
Silence this train runs off its tracks  
Kiss me try to fix it would you just try to listen  
Hang up give up for the life of us we cant get it back  
  
A beautiful magic love affair  
What a sad beautiful tragic beautiful tragic beautiful  
What we had a beautiful magic love affair  
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair  
We had a beautiful magic love affair  
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
