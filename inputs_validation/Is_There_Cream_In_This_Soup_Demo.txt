Is there cream in this soup  
  
I look in the mirror I know Im not good enough to eat  
Ill tell you something my hunger has nothing to do with greed  
So I bleed  
  
This is junkie love when youve got no sugar  
You behave like a wretch when you could be the Buddha  
You say its you but I know its me  
  
Is there cream in this soup is there truth in this lie  
A promise that was made in the strangest eye  
Would you kill for love can you go the mile  
Baby dont lie  
  
Take the needle off the record its been playin such a long time  
Take the needle off the record Im so tired of hearin that line  
Same old line  
  
I look in the mirror I know Im not good enough to eat  
Ill tell you something my hunger has nothin to do with greed  
So feed me  
  
This is junkie love when youve got no sugar  
You live like a wretch when you should be the Buddha  
You say its you but I know its me  
  
Is there cream in this soup is there truth in this lie  
A promise that was made in the strangest eye  
Would you kill for love would you do or die  
Baby dont lie  
  
Take the needle off the record its been playing such a long time  
Take the needle off the record Im so tired of hearing that line  
Take the needle off the record its been playing such a long time  
Take the needle off the record Im so tired of hearing that line  
  
Lie lie lie  
Lie lie lie  
Lie lie lie  
  
I never meant to hurt you I dont know why  
You come with your lawyers and your alibi  
How can you look me straight in the eye  
When you know your truth is a lie lie lie  
  
Lie lie  
Lie lie  
Lie lie ohh  
  
Take the needle off the record its been playing such a long time  
Take the needle off the record Im so tired of hearing that line  
Take the needle off the record its been playing such a long time  
Take the needle off the record Im so tired of hearing that line line line  
  
Spill now scream now  
  
Take the needle off the record come on  
Take the needle off the record  
Take the needle off the record
