Girl this little game you play  
Dont stop till you run too far  
So whats a man like me to say  
With a bullet laying in my heart  
Damn girl we go from so hot to so cold  
What am I gonna do about this damn love  
Is that shit in sync or insane love  
I guess thats the way we play it  
  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
  
Whats that baby what you say  
You the one to light up this torch  
Cause Im burning down all the way  
Burn it down til there aint no more  
Damn love how did the sound get so amped up  
Turn off and silence this damn love  
Is that shit insane or in sync girl  
I guess thats the way we play it  
  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
  
You should see the look on your face  
Baby when I finish what you start

With a bullet laying in your heart  
Damn love how did this shit get out of my hands love
