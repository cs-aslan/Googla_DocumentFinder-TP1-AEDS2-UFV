Round my door the leaves are falling  
A cold wild wind will come  
Sweethearts walk by together  
And I still miss someone  
No I never got over those blue eyes  
I see them everywhere  
I miss those arms that held me  
When all the love was there  
I wonder if hes sorry  
For leaving what wed begun  
Theres someone for me somewhere  
But I still miss someone  
No I never got over those blue eyes  
I see them everywhere  
I miss those arms that held me  
When all the love was there
