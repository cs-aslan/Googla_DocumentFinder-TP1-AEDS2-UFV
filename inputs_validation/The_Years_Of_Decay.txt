Out on this road takes its toll  
And you pay for everything you do  
Under lights made me blind  
This place is the same as last night  
Out of control takes its toll  
But you learn to live with your dreams  
Speaking your mind to those you find  
Listening to what you have to say  
I wouldnt change the way  
I wouldnt stop the decay  
  
Promised the world as your world  
Changed before your eyes  
And the days became the weeks  
And the weeks the years  
And no one remembers that very first day  
Or how it slipped away  
Forever I wait pulling in pulling out  
As the motors whine  
To remind me Im home  
And Im here to stay  
As we decay  
Another day  
Decay away  
  
Im goin home I dont know where  
Im goin home not far from here  
  
Out on this road paint this toll  
Make me whole set the stage  
Fill it with anger fill it with rage  
No I dont know whats today  
I know it falls in the years of decay  
Self sacrifice every night  
And together we paid a price in blood  
That spilled out through the years  
And another day passes away  
Look to the black drawn farther back  
Look to each day see the decay  
Times Ive had good and bad  
Win or lose this is what I choose
