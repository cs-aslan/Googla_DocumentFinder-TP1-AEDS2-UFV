They say Im unforgiven and I have to pay  
Like Im the demon resurrection  
They say that I turn innocence to panic  
But I dont care  
  
They say that my obsession is unholy  
That I deviate from reason  
They say I make you suffer for my sins  
I hope you forgive me  
  
Do you want it Repeat x1  
My desire  
  
I sink to my knees  
Head in my hands  
So now Im just a shadow on their bleeding hearts  
This is why the righteous never learn  
Im like a dead man hiding in the dark  
  
What do you need Repeat x1  
  
What have we become  
All that we could be  
Think of this as mercy a small gift from me  
What does a confession ever do  
But take my guilt away  
  
Do you want it  
Do you want it  
My desire  
  
I Feel It Fall  
I Feel It Fall From Me  
I Feel It Fall Down  
I Feel It Fall For You  
  
What do you need  
What do you need
