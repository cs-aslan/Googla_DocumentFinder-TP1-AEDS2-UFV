So long Ive been waiting to sing this song  
Now I should if is worth it anymore  
When kin at me most  
People always ask it about you  
And people always want to talk about you  
Sometimes when I sleep  
I think about you with you were so one  
  
Didnt we have fun  
I know it hurts like air wave  
You complete with someone  
  
Try  
Never stop to wonder why  
Oh how  
I just hope youre happy now  
Hope youre happy now  
  
People always ask it about you  
And people always want to talk about you  
Sometimes when I sleep  
I think about you with you were so one  
  
Didnt we have fun  
I know it hurts like air wave  
You complete with someone  
Didnt we have fun  
Though it hurt like air yeah  
I dont want to forget  
  
Didnt we have fun  
I know it hurts like air wave  
You complete with someone  
Didnt we have fun  
Though it hurt like air yeah  
I dont want to forget  
I dont want to forget
