Dont talk to me girl you know its not nice  
Dont laugh at murder I wont pay the price  
The facts are too highpowered so sickened thrill  
Id give that mess up cos it makes you so ill  
  
Blame bad things on me whatever you do  
When I come home I will be different from you  
Youre such a chictalk youre really trussed up  
Dont wanna talk to you just left me your mum  
  
Dont be a puppet always rush you around  
One just for you photo try and tire me down  
I wont tell him I talk like this all night  
He must be worried cos youre sounding so trite  
  
Respect is only normal the way to our lives  
Ever tried to sleep around with a bed for a wife  
Well never change you if you start acting that way  
If do keep mouths all open Ill never get a say  
You know whats special its as dark as I say  
Can you see me just ourselves
