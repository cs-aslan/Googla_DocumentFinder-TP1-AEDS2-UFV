Verse 1  
Waking up midnight November  
And just still in my bed  
Its kinda rough cause since I met ya  
Theres things weve never said  
  
PreChorus  
So if I go for a little while longer  
When Im home we can talk about the big falls of the road  
If you say go I would stop everything oh  
My heart would play the role now  
And act like its never been broke  
  
Chorus  
Though my soul oh oh oh  
Lately I really need to know  
How long how long can we be touch and go  
Oh my soul oh oh oh  
How long how long can we be touch and go  
  
Verse 2  
Its not enough to say I want ya  
Cause Ill say anything  
Im holding out to feel without a doubt  
I had have just been questioning it  
  
PreChorus  
If I go for a little while longer  
When Im home we can talk about the big falls of the road  
If you say go I would stop everything oh  
My heart would play the role now  
And act like its never been broke  
  
Chorus  
Though my soul oh oh oh  
Lately I really need to know  
How long how long can we be touch and go  
Oh my soul oh oh oh  
How long how long can we be  
  
Bridge  
All of my bones they scream Im right  
If youre taking me home to stay the night  
Darling my soul would heal  
  
Outro  
If you say go I would stop everything oh  
My heart would play the wrong  
And act like its never been broke though my soul  
Lately I really need to know  
How long how long can we be touch and go  
Oh my soul how long  
How long how long can we be touch and go  
How long how long can we be touch and go  
How long how long can we be touch and go
