She can give you a reason to live if she wants to  
She can make you forget other loves that youve known  
She has two lips and two arms that thrill you as bad if you do  
And if you want her to give them to you she will  
  
Dont you believe her I did and soon shell be leaving me  
Dont you believe her I did and soon shell be leaving you  
  
She can tell you a lie youll believe if she has to  
And youll trust her till time and tie both stands still  
She can cry on your shoulder and swear to the things that she wont do  
Ah but be careful cause when youre not looking she will  
Dont you believe her  
Dont you believe her
