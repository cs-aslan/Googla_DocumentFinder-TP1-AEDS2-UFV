One two button your shoe  
Put on your coat and hat  
Ill play a game like that  
While Im waiting for you  
Three four open the door  
Hurry for heavens sake  
I count every step you take  
While Im waiting for you  
Five six my eyes are fixed  
On that picture of your charm  
Seven eight youre at the gate  
And you walk into my arms  
Nine ten kiss me again  
Tell me you get a thrill  
Just as I hope you will  
While Im waiting for you
