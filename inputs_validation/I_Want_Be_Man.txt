I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
  
I dont like living inside  
This metal plastic shell  
Its no way to treat your help  
Theyll tell you go to hell  
  
I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
  
Faster master  
Ive got better things which I can do  
Hey I dont like livin in this fleshy human shell  
As much as I abuse it its really gone to hell  
  
I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
  
Id rather be a robot  
So I dont have to think  
cause then I could be programmed  
Where I dont have to dream  
Id rather be a man  
Instead of a machine  
Flesh and blood life and death  
Its a mystery  
Nothing to be programmed  
Nothing is for sure  
And least theres a reason  
A reason for my life  
I want be man  
You want be me  
  
I want to live in your body hey
