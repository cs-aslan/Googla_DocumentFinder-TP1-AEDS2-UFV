These are dangerous times  
Nothing to care or die for  
These are dangerous times  
What you want someone will buy for you  
Dont get away  
Its so easy to wait  
Youve been wearing the green  
Ive been wearing the fall  
And you said that all was just agreed  
But dont get away  
I saw a guy out on the street  
Said I know what you need boy  
I can set you fine  
I didnt buy his line because  
These are dangerous times  
I dont want to get old  
You say that everythings fine  
Then you leave me standing in the cold  
All alone  
But dont get away  
Its so easy to fall  
Youve been trying to gain  
Ive been trying to stop  
But its catching up with me again  
But dont get away  
These are dangerous times  
Its a dangerous time
