Whos that with his arm around you  
He making eyes at you that way  
He looks in love  
He looks familiar  
Damn its me  
Never thought Id see that day  
Its like I came to sleep and there was darkness  
Well Im holding the daylight by your voice  
Not that I have any choice  
  
Something coming over me  
I know its you  
Someone that I used to be  
But he is through  
Know that its forever and its overdue  
Something coming over me  
I know its you  
  
And now were talking about our future  
Oh and our futures wide open  
Cause your love is the best place Ive ever been  
It was you to the rescue  
And I mention that Id never felt like this before  
Im powerless to fight it anymore  
  
Something coming over me  
I know its you  
Someone that I used to be  
But he is through  
Know that its forever and its overdue  
Something coming over me  
I know its you  
  
Used to watch this game from the sidelines  
Now its time to get on in and play  
Youve been waiting there for me for my whole life  
Now its all you  
Now its all you  
  
Something coming over me  
I know its you  
Someone that I used to be  
But he is through  
Know that its forever and its overdue  
Something coming over me  
I know its you  
I know  
I know its you baby  
I know its you
