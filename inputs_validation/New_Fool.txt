Sad songs and teardrops will surely mend this broken heart  
Time forgets these bitter things I feel  
But your days are numbered  
Youll learn your lesson well  
When you finally play a heart that plays for real  
Theres a new fool somewhere waiting  
For your old fashion heartbreak love affair  
Shell see through your intentions  
With each lie that you tell  
And the old ways will go out with the new some way  
Leaving was so easy  
But old hands do make fancy moves  
And I for one fell victim to your game  
But someday youll see that cold hearts can be broken too  
What goes round must come around your way  
Theres a new fool somewhere waiting  
For your old fashion heartbreak love affair  
Shell see through your intentions  
With each lie that you tell  
And the old ways will go out with the new some way
