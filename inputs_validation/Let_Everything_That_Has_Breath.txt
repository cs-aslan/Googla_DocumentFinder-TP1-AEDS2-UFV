Chorus  
Let evrything that evrything that  
Evrything that has breath praise the Lord  
Let evrything that evrything that  
Evrything that has breath praise the Lord  
  
Praise You in the morning praise You in the evening  
Praise You when Im young and when Im old  
Praise You when Im laughing praise You with Im grieving  
Praise You evry season of the soul  
  
If we could see how much Youre worth  
Your power Your might Your endless love  
Then surely we would never cease to praise  
  
Praise You in the heavens joining with the angels  
Praising You forever and a day  
Praise You on the earth now joining with creation  
Calling all the nations to Your praise  
  
If we could see how much Youre worth  
Your power Your might Your endless love  
Then surely we would never cease to praise
