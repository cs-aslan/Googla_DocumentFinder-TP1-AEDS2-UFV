Oh  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Me and Billy boy and old lady Jane  
We hitched a ride took a fast movin train  
got to the top with our heads spinnin round  
You never know just what you got until its comin back  
  
Down on the farm in the Mississippi shade  
The folks down there they told me  
Take it day by day  
  
And walk the last mile before I sleep  
Itll be awhile before I get my peace  
Last Mile I walk slowly  
The last mile I can rest my feet  
  
I got a long way to go before I reach the light of day  
Monkeys on my back I gotta find a better way  
Same ole story never get just what you want  
The more you get the more you want  
so tell me to and get picked up  
I guess Ive always been a traveling man  
Cause when Im movin I can make a stand yeah yeah  
  
And walk the last mile before I sleep  
Itll be awhile before I get my peace  
Last Mile I walk slowly  
The last mile I can rest my feet  
  
Dont know where Im going but I know where Ive been  
Look around me everybodys trying to win  
  
And walk the last mile before I sleep  
Itll be awhile before I get my peace  
Last Mile I walk slowly  
The last mile I can rest my feet
