Ive been searching and youve been gone  
Out looking for the shortest path to the one that youre on  
And Ive already seen all I want to see  
Come on lets take the long cut  
I think thats what we need  
When we were younger we were strong  
We felt a lot better than the things that wed done  
Now if its to be if you still believe  
Come on lets take the long cut  
I think thats what we need  
If you want to take the long cut  
  
Well get there eventually  
Ive been searching and youve been gone  
Out looking for the shortest path to the one youre on  
Now if its to be if you still believe  
Come on lets take the long cut  
I think thats what we need  
Weve been in a deep rut  
And its been killing me  
If you want to take the long cut  
Well get there eventually
