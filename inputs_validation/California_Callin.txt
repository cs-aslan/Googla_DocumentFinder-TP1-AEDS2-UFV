Driving through the night  
Tears are running down my face  
I start to realize all the things that I once said  
I promised you the world  
Its nothing more than you deserve  
Its killing me inside to know I put you through this hell  
  
Take away my heart  
It doesnt want to work no more  
I never meant to make you cry  
  
Chorus  
California calling 20 miles to go  
And I dont I dont know  
Should I turn around or should I leave you alone  
No I dont I don t know  
I dont know  
No I dont know  
  
Im on the road and it feels so cold outside  
Its driving me insane to know how much you hurt tonight  
Take away my heart it doesnt want to work no more  
I never meant to make you cry  
  
Chorus x2  
  
California calling 20 miles to go  
And I dont I dont know  
Shod I turn around or shod I leave you alone  
No I dont I don t know  
I dont know  
No I dont know  
  
Gotta keep on moving on Repeat x3  
California calling California calling  
Gotta keep on moving on Repeat x3  
California calling California calling
