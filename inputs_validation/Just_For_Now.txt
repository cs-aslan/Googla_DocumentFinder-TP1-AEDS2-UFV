Just for now  
Just for now  
  
Its that time of year  
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside  
If just for a little while  
Tears stop right here  
I know weve all had a bumpy ride  
Im secretly on your side  
  
Well how did you know Its what I always wanted  
Could never have had too many of these  
Will you quit kicking me under the table  
Im trying will somebody make us shut up about it  
Can we settle down please  
  
Its that time of year  
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside  
If just for a little while  
Tears stop right here  
I know weve all had a bumpy ride  
Im secretly on your side  
  
Bite tongue deep breaths  
Count to ten nod your head  
  
I think something is burning  
Now youve ruined the whole thing  
Oh muffle the smoke alarm  
Whoever put on this music  
Better quick sharp remove it  
Pour me another oh dont wag your finger at me  
  
Its that time of year  
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside  
If just for a little while  
Tears stop right here  
I know weve all had a bumpy ride  
Im secretly on your side  
  
Get get me out of here  
Get get me out of here  
Get me out of here  
  
Get get me out of here  
Get get me out of here  
Get me out of here  
  
Just for now  
Just for now  
Just for now  
  
Just for now  
Just for now  
  
Just for now  
Just for now  
  
Just for now  
Please  
Just for now
