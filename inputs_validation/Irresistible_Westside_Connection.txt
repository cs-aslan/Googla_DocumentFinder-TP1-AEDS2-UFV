Everytime I try to leave  
Something pulls me back baby  
Tried and tried to let you go  
But its just impossible  
  
Everytime we say goodbye  
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes  
Wish I didnt need you so  
But youre irresistible  
  
I dont want to lose you to somebody else  
But I cant go on contradicting myself  
I know that its pointless to keep hodling on  
But something inside tells me youre where I belong  
  
Everytime I try to leave  
Something pulls me back baby  
Tried and tried to let you go  
But its just impossible  
  
Everytime we say goodbye  
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes  
Wish I didnt need you so  
But youre irresistible  
  
I know that its unrealistic to think  
That things will get better  
Between you and me  
Cause time after time  
  
You just shatter my heart  
But when Im without you  
I feel so torn apart  
  
Everytime I try to leave  
Something pulls me back baby  
Tried and tried to let you go  
But its just impossible  
  
Everytime we say goodbye  
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes  
Wish I didnt need you so  
But youre irresistible  
  
Boy  
I wish  
That I didnt  
Love you so  
oh oo oh oo oh oh  
  
I try to tell you no  
But youre irresistible  
oh oo oh oo whoah oh  
  
See I only want it to be like it was  
When we got together and first fell in love  
Sometimes its like Im addicted to you  
This loves so consuming  
I dont know what to do  
  
Everytime I try to leave  
Something pulls me back baby  
Tried and tried to let you go  
But its just impossible  
  
Everytime we say goodbye  
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes  
Wish I didnt need you so  
  
But youre irresistible  
  
Everytime I try to leave  
Something pulls me back baby  
Tried and tried to let you go  
But its just impossible  
  
Everytime we say goodbye  
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes  
Wish I didnt need you so  
But youre irresistible  
  
Everytime I try to leave  
Something pulls me back baby  
Tried and tried to let you go  
But its just impossible  
  
Everytime we say goodbye  
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes  
Wish I didnt need you so  
But youre irresistible
