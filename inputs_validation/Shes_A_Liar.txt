Caroline is falling in and out of love  
Tryn to get those things that shes been thinkin of  
She cant be what she wants to be  
Though she never really tries  
Shes a liar  
Shes a liar  
But I might try her tonight  
And if things go right  
Caroline is calling everyone in town  
First she calls them friends and then she puts them down  
She cant be what she wants to be  
Though she never really tries  
Shes a liar  
Shes a liar  
But I might try her tonight  
And if things go right  
She cant be what she wants to be  
Though she never really tries  
Shes a liar  
Shes a liar  
But I might try her tonight  
And if things go right  
Wo shes a liar Shes a liar  
Shes a liar Shes a liar  
Shes a liar Shes a liar  
Shes a liar Shes a liar  
Shes a liar Shes a liar
