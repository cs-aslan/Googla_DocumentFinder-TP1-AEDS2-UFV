Love is everything  
Its a whole lot more than going to the store for a wedding ring  
Its kissin and a huggin but its also the kicking and the cussing thing  
Ive been told  
  
Love is everything  
Its a smile on your face on a cold winter day at the thought of spring  
Its getting up at night for the cry of a little bitty baby thing  
And its growing old  
  
Love is everything  
Its those fires that daddy stoked those nights to keep you warm  
Its the hell your mama went through the day you were born  
And its a thunderstorm  
  
Love is everything  
Oh its going off to war its the back and forth on a front porch swing  
Its the kiss that you got in the old parking lot of a Dairy Queen  
And its you and me  
  
Love is everything  
Its looking out for everybody else but number one  
And its all that really matters when alls said and done  
And the race is run  
  
Love is everything  
Its a rose on a stone its the words in a song that the choir sings  
Its the tears of goodbye and the place that you fly to to get your wings  
Yeah loves the king  
Love is everything  
Love is everything
