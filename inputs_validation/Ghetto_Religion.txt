Had the landlord at my door  
I heard him saying  
Tomorrow no more  
Pay me now or leave  
But we didnt have anything to giveah can you feel me  
  
Searching for restorationand we need restoration  
Make the church my family  
This is my story  
This is my song  
And I can sing it all night long I tell you why because  
  
Chorus  
  
The ghetto is a part of my religionthe only thing my eyes can see  
The only thing my eyes can seeand I tell you there aint no man  
There aint no man gonna stop the visionIm a part of the ghetto  
The ghetto is a part of me  
  
Children cry no morechildren cry no more  
Because heaven is upon you  
Please put down your guns  
And we shall overcome  
  
Thought your load may be heavy  
Know that the weight makes you strong  
Take my life for example  
While I sing my song  
Mr Kelly help me sing this song  
  
Chorus X2  
  
La la la la la lala laX3 fade out  
The ghetto is a part of me  
The ghetto is a part of my religion
