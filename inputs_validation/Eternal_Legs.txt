Across the space  
We fly around the world  
For years years years years  
  
Were out of control  
Inside an iron ball  
Desire  
  
Chorus  
We see the moon  
A color ball  
We wont be free again  
No choice  
  
An iron box  
Electric brain release  
Away away away away  
  
A piece of steel  
Thats all we ever feel  
No pain  
  
Chorus  
  
Desire  
We see the moon  
A color ball  
We wont be free again
