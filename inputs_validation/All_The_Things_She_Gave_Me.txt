All the things  
All the things she gave me  
All the things

Playing poker with souls  
The lots are all empty  
The last mans out  
The moons made of cheese  
And God is a boy scout  
When I go to sleep  
Ill be dreaming about  
All the things  
Then Ill dream about

Great tall spires  
Cathedrals and candles  
Chimneys and choirs  
Ill dream about  
That place  
Where I set fire  
All the things  
All the things that she
