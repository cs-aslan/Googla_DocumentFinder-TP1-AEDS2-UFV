You need a man thatll treat you like the woman you are  
Those little boys are just fooling around with your heart  
Whatcha gonna do now that youre all alone  
You need a rock not a rollin sone  
Yeah so when Im bored  
it just aint enough  
You need a man made of stronger stuff  
Get ready  
  
Rock steady all night long  
Rock steady till the light of dawn  
Slow and easy tried and true  
Rock steady  
Just me and you  
  
You need somebody who will help you with your heavy load  
Well Ive been there baby  
Lord give me a rock and roll  
Well I can bend but I wont break  
cause you aint got what I can take  
So when youre tired of those little girls  
you want a woman thatll rock your world  
Get ready  
  
Rock steady all night long  
Rock steady till the light of dawn  
Slow and easy tried and true  
Rock steady  
Just me and you  
Amateurs are clearly tought  
They cant give you what you really want  
When all the other have been untrue  
Ill give you something you can hold on to  
  
Rock steady all night long  
Rock steady till the light of dawn  
Slow and easy tried and true  
Rock steady  
Just me and you
