Did you ever get up on the wrong side of bed  
With an achin head and just fall apart  
Youre running late the boss is bitchin  
Its cold outside and the car wont start  
  
Well I dont mean to bitch I swear  
Cause we all got our cross to bear  
  
Chorus  
But when I hear the music  
All my troubles just fade away  
When I hear the music  
Let it play let it play  
When I hear the music  
Sure as darkness I can see the day  
When I hear the music  
Let it play  
Let it play  
  
Lifes just rented space getting laid to waste  
When the lines on my face say Im growing older  
Just a stitch in time gonna save my mind  
When the weight of the world lies on my shoulders  
  
Soon I wont have a place to fit  
But Ill cross that bridge when I come to it  
  
Chorus
