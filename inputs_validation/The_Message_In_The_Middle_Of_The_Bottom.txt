I never meant a single thing when you tried it  
You know it I felt it I liked it I did it  
I never meant to put it there but somewhere In despair  
It got moved into view then I liked it  
I never meant a single word when I said I could love you  
I thought it I heard it I used it  
I never meant a single beat of my heart to be yours  
Cause I knew if you knew youd abuse it  
  
Chorus  
Theres a message in the middle of the bottom  
You see em you love em you got em  
Theres a proper time to pick em when theyre fallen  
Just listen youll hear em acallin  
Theres a special way to know you got his lovin  
Cant you feel it you ought to you taught him  
Theres a special time for lovin and another time  
For huggin and a lot of time to leave him alone  
  
I have a feelin deep inside that Ive got you  
Ill keep you why not itll make me feel better  
If theres a woman on this earth who should love you  
Its me boy dont fight it admit it you love it  
If you think theres someone else who can move you  
Ill lose you no problem youre free to go get her  
I just refuse to let a lady step in on my show  
If you choose do it now or forget it  
  
Chorus  
  
I never meant a single thing when you tried it  
You know it I felt it I liked it I did it  
I never meant to put it there but somewhere In despair  
It got moved into view then I liked it  
I never meant a single word when I said I could love you  
I thought it I heard it I used it  
I never meant a single beat of my heart to be yours  
Cause I knew if you knew youd abuse it  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a special time for lovin and another time  
For huggin and a lot of time to leave him alone  
  
Message in the middle of the bottom Repeat x5
