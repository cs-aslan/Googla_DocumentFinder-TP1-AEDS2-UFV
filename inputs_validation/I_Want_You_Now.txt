I want you now  
Tomorrow wont do  
Theres a yearning inside  
And its showing through  
Reach out your hands  
And accept my love  
Weve waited for too long  
Enough is enough  
I want you now  
  
My heart is aching  
My body is burning  
My hands are shaking  
My head is turning  
You understand  
Its so easy to choose  
Weve got time to kill  
Weve got nothing to lose  
I want you now  
  
And I dont mean to sound  
Like one of the boys  
Thats now what Im trying to do  
I dont want to be  
Like one of the boys  
I just want you now  
  
Because Ive got a love  
A love that wont wait  
A love that is growing  
And its getting late  
Do you know what it means  
To be left this way  
When everyones gone  
And the feelings they stay  
I want you now
