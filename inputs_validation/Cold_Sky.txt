Walking down the street  
Memories surround me  
Im lost in a town without pity  
It brings me to my knees  
Thoughts of me in your arms  
Sends a shiver through me  
My weary heart knows better  
But I want you more than ever  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over loving you  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over loving you  
But each time I look up I think of you  
And its a cold sky its a cold sky  
Wish upon a red star to guide me  
My footsteps lead me nowhere  
I circle in the square  
People stare right through me  
As if I wasnt even there  
A sea of stars above me  
And no one here to love me  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over loving you  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over loving you  
But each time I look up I think of you  
And its a cold sky

I thought I was over  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over loving you  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over loving you  
But each time I look up I think of you  
And its a cold sky its a cold sky  
Its a cold sky  
Thought I was over loving you
