I heard your heart you held it close to me  
The wild embrace the silent sea  
A whisper of imagery for Lovers Supreme  
But now Im lost in the crowd  
No shadow of a doubt  
Its all over now  
No shadow of a doubt  
You changed the dream  
You changed the scenery  
the tender touch the urge to breathe  
There under a lovelit sun  
Whats lost could be found  
But now no trace of a sound  
no shadow of a doubt  
Im faraway bound  
No shadow of a doubt
