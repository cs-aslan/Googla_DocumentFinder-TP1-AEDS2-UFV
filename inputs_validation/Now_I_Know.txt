Took a chance rolled the dice on me and you  
Opened up let you in my world  
Like a dance started slow and then love took control  
Swept away so proud to be your girl  
But when you write a story much to fast  
Sometimes a happy ending doesnt last  
  
Chorus  
Now I know that love aint meant to be a plaything  
Now I know its not an ordinary everyday thing  
Now I know that when this ride is so amazing  
When its wrong you gotta let it go  
Now I know  
Now I know  
  
Remember when we said our love would last forever  
But then again how are we to know  
There come a time that love will change like stormy weather  
A sunny day can suddenly turn cold  
Time will teach you all you need to learn  
But therell always be a first time you get burned  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont regret a single day  
The joy and pain along the way  
A broken hearts the price we pay  
As sad as it may seem  
Baby cant you see  
Its the way its gotta be  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah  
Now I know  
I know
