Here we are  
What is left of a husband and a wife with four good kids  
Who have a way of gettin on with their lives  
And Im not old but Im getting a whole lot older every day  
Its too late to keep from goin crazy  
Ive got to get away  
  
The reasons that I cant stay dont have a thing to do with being in love  
And I understand that lovin a man shouldnt have to be this rough  
And you aint the only one who feels like this worlds left you far behind  
I dont know why you gotta be angry all the time  
  
Our boys are strong now the spittin image of you when you were young  
I hope someday they can see past what you have become  
I remember every time I said Id never leave  
But what I cant live with is memories of the way you used to be  
  
The reasons that I cant stay dont have a thing to do with being in love  
I understand that lovin a man shouldnt have to be this rough  
You aint the only one who feels like this worlds left you far behind  
I dont know why you gotta be angry all the time  
  
Twenty years have came and went since I walked out of your door  
I never quite made it back to the one I was before  
And God it hurts me to think of you  
For the light in your eyes was gone  
And sometimes I dont know why this old world cant leave well enough alone  
  
The reasons that I cant stay dont have a thing to do with being in love  
And I understand that lovin a man shouldnt have to be this rough  
You aint the only one who feels like this worlds left you far behind  
I dont know why you gotta be angry all the time Repeat x3
