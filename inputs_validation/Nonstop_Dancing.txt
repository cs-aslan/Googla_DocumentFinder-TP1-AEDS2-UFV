Nonstop dancing truly out on the floor  
Nonstop moving baby baby  
Still you scream out for more  
We dont care if it rains or shines  
Cause everythings fine inside when were dancing  
Nonstop dancing  
I said nonstop loving with my girl by my side  
Everythings just cool now baby baby  
Shes the sweetest thing I know  
I dont even mind guys trying to compete  
I know our loves as strong as the beat when were dancing  
Nonstop dancing  
People say were wasting our time  
They dont seem to understand  
Cause when youre dancing all night long  
It gives you the feeling that you belong  
Nonstop dancing Im truly out of my head  
But I aint sleepy baby baby  
You see the dance is my bed  
Things are really getting wild  
The kids are screaming for that James Brown style when were dancing  
Nonstop dancing
