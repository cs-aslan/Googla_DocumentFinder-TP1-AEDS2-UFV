It wont be long now  
The musics on loud  
Well sing this song out  
And then well lie down  
Ill hold you close then  
And let you know when  
The space and time bend  
And then well fall in  
  
Go put on your best tonight  
Its you and me and one spotlight  
One more show one last time  
We are ready  
  
Say you will be all around me  
When your body sets your heart free  
Say you will be all around me  
  
Ill look for your eyes  
To keep me inside  
When everything dies  
But one last sunrise  
And when we stand there  
Together not scared  
Ill dry your last tear  
And then well just err  
  
Go put on your best tonight  
Its you and me and not much time  
To watch the world burning bright  
We are ready  
  
Say you will be all around me  
When your body sets your heart free  
Say you will be all around me  
Say youll get me before the ending  
Take my body set my heart free  
Say youll get me before the ending  
  
Go put on your best tonight  
Its you and me and one spotlight  
One more show one last time  
It wont be long now  
  
Say you will be all around me  
When your body sets your heart free  
Say you will be all around me  
Say youll get me before the ending  
Take my body set my heart free  
Say youll get me before the ending  
Say you will be you wont be long  
All around me you wont be long now
