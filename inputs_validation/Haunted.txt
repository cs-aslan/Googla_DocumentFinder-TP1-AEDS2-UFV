You and I walk a fragile line  
I have known it all this time  
But I never thought Id live to see it break  
Its getting dark and its all too quiet  
And I cant trust anything now  
And its comin over you like its all a big mistake  
  
Holding my breath wont lose you again  
Somethings made your eyes go cold  
  
Come on come on dont leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Somethings gone terribly wrong youre all I wanted  
Come on come on dont leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Cant breathe whenever youre gone  
Cant turn back now Im haunted  
  
Stood there and watched you walk away  
From everything we had  
But I still mean every word I said to you  
He will try to take away my pain  
And he just might make me smile  
But the whole time Im wishin he was you instead  
Oh oh holding my breath wont see you again  
Something keeps me holding on to nothing  
  
Come on come on dont leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Somethings gone terribly wrong youre all I wanted  
Come on come on dont leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Cant breathe whenever youre gone  
Cant turn back now Im haunted  
  
I know I know I just know  
Youre not gone you cant be gone  
No  
  
Come on come on dont leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Somethings gone terribly wrong wont finish what you started  
Come on come on dont leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Cant breathe whenever youre gone  
Cant go back Im haunted  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
You and I walk a fragile line  
I have known it all this time  
Never ever thought Id see it break  
Never thought Id see it
