When you left the door was  
slamming  
You paused in the doorway  
slamming  
As though a thought stole you away  
slamming  
I watched the world pull you away  
Lock it  
  
So I run into the hall  
Lock it  
Into the corridor  
Lock it  
Theres a door in the house  
slamming  
I hear the lift descending  
slamming  
I hear it hit the landing  
slamming  
See the hackles on the cat  
standing  
  
With my key I  
lock it  
With my key I  
lock it up  
With my key I  
lock it  
With my key I  
lock it up

Dont you bring back the reveries  
I turn into a bird  
Carry further than the word is heard  
  
Woman let me in  
I turn into the wind  
I blow you a cold kiss  
Stronger than the songs hit  
  
I will not let you in  
I face towards the wind  
I change into the Mule  
I change into the Mule
