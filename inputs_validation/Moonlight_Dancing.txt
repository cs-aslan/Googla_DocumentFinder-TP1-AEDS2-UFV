How bout a little bit a little bit of moonlight dancin  
Underneath the starry sky  
How bout a little bit a little bit of moonlight dancin  
Just the moon and you and i  
Mmm just the moon and you and i  
Moonlight dancin mmm moonlight dancin  
  
How bout a little bit a little bit of late night romance  
Underneath the starry sky  
How bout a little bit a little bit of late night romance  
Just the moon and you and i  
Mmm just the moon and you and i  
Moonlight dancin mmm moonlight dancin  
  
Ohh nobodys gonna be there  
Ohh so dont you want to go where  
We could dance across the sky  
Leave the world behind us  
Nothin that we couldnt do  
Yeah we could dance across the sky  
Leave the world behind us  
Just the moon and me and you  
Mmm just the moon and me and you  
  
We could hide inside the rhythm  
til the morning finds us  
Share a little ecstasy  
Yeah we could hide inside the rhythm  
til the morning finds us  
If you come away with me  
Ill show you how it feels to be  
Moonlight dancin mmm moonlight dancin  
  
Oh we gonna sail on the wind  
Oh so dont you want to begin  
  
Moonlight dancing mmm moonlight dancing  
How bout a little bit a little bit  
How bout a little bit a little bit of moonlight dancin  
Just the moon and you and i  
Moonlight dancin mmm moonlight dancing  
Ooooh ahhh
