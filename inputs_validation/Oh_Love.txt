Oh love oh love  
Wont you rain on me tonight  
Oh life oh life  
Please dont pass me by  
Dont stop dont stop  
Dont stop when the red lights flash  
Oh ride free ride  
Wont you take me close to you  
  
Far away far away  
Waste away tonight  
Im wearing my heart on a noose  
  
Far away far away  
Waste away tonight  
Tonight my hearts on the loose  
  
Oh lights and action  
I just cant be satisfied  
Oh losers and choosers  
Wont you please hold on my life  
Oh hours and hours  
Like the dog years of the day  
Old story same old story  
Wont you see the light of day  
  
Far away far away  
Waste away tonight  
Im wearing my heart on a noose  
  
Far away far away  
Waste away tonight  
Tonight my hearts on the loose  
  
Talk myself out of feeling  
Talk my way out of control  
Talk myself out of falling in love  
Falling in love with you  
  
Oh love oh love  
Wont your rain on me tonight  
Oh ride free ride  
Wont you take me close to you  
  
Far away far away  
Waste away tonight  
Im wearing my heart on a noose  
  
Far away far away  
Waste away tonight  
Tonight my hearts on the loose  
  
Far away far away  
Waste away tonight  
Im wearing my heart on a noose  
  
Far away far away  
Waste away tonight  
Tonight my hearts on the loose  
  
Tonight my hearts on the loose  
Tonight my hearts on the loose
