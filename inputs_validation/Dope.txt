Corks off its on  
The partys just begun  
I promise  
This drink is my last one  
I know I fucked up again  
Because I lost my only friend  
God forgive my sins  
Dont leave me I  
Oh I will hate myself until I die  
  
My heart would break without you  
Might not awake without you  
Been hurting low from living high for so long  
Im sorry and I love you  
Sing with me Bell Bottom Blue  
Ill keep on searching for an answer cause I need you more than dope  
  
I need you more than dope  
Need you more than dope  
Need you more than dope  
I need you more than dope  
  
Toast one last puff  
And two last regrets  
Three spirits and  
Twelve lonely steps  
Up heavens stairway to gold  
Mine myself like coal  
A mountain of a soul  
Each day I cry  
Oh I feel so low from living high  
  
My heart would break without you  
Might not awake without you  
Been hurting low from living high for so long  
Im sorry and I love you  
Sing with me Bell Bottom Blue  
Ill keep searching for an answer cause I need you more than dope  
  
I need you more than dope  
I need you more than dope  
I need you more than dope  
I need you more than dope  
  
I need you more  
Need you more  
I need you more than dope
