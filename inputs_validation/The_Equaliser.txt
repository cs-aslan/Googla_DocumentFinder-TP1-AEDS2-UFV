No Gang boss no  
We dont want the whip  
  
As you get weaker  it will get harder  
So dont be like him  
Keep your bones of effort and strength  
Dont sell them to him  
  
We dont want no gang boss  
We want to equalize  
To my fathers fathers fathers father  
Work was no joy  
When his son had grown of age  
You got to work now boy  
Never ceasing for many years  
Want to follow that boy  
  
Till half and half is equalized  
Put down the tools  
See the car see the house  
See the fabulous jewels  
See the world you have built it with shoulders of iron  
See the world but it is not yours say the stealers of Zion  
  
Geneva  
Wall Street  
Who makes them so fat  
Well well me an you better think about that  
In overdrive whooo  
  
Till humanize is equalize  
Put down the tools  
Every face on every side  
Throw down the tools  
Stay at home  
Dont check with Rome paint strike on the door  
Its one to one the fight is on so dont go to war  
  
We dont need no gang boss  
We have to equalize
