All the early Roman kings  
In their sharkskin suits  
Bow ties and buttons  
High top boots  
Drivin the spikes in  
Blazin the rails  
Nailed in their coffins  
In top hats and tails  
  
Fly away little bird  
Fly away flap your wings  
Fly by night  
Like the early Roman kings  
  
All the early Roman kings  
In the early early morn  
Coming down the mountain  
Distributing the corn  
Speeding through the forest  
Racing down the track  
You try to get away  
They drag you back  
  
Tomorrow is Friday  
Well see what it brings  
Everybodys talking  
Bout the early Roman kings  
  
Theyre peddlers and theyre meddlers  
They buy and they sell  
They destroyed your city  
Theyll destroy you as well  
Theyre lecherous and treacherous  
Hellbent for leather  
Each of em bigger  
Than all men put together  
  
Sluggers and muggers  
Wearing fancy gold rings  
All the women goin crazy  
For the early Roman kings  
  
I can dress up your wounds  
With a bloodclotted rag  
I aint afraid to make love  
To a bitch or a hag  
If you see me comin  
And youre standing there  
Wave your handkerchief  
In the air  
  
I aint dead yet  
My bell still rings  
I keep my fingers crossed  
Like them early Roman kings  
  
I can strip you of life  
Strip you of breath  
Ship you down  
To the house of death  
One day  
You will ask for me  
Therell be no one else  
That youll wanna see  
  
Bring down my fiddle  
Tune up my strings  
Im gonna break it wide open  
Like the early Roman kings  
  
I was up on black mountain  
The day Detroit fell  
They killed em all off  
And they sent em to hell  
Ding dong daddy  
Youre coming up short  
Gonna put you on trial  
In a Sicilian court  
  
Ive had my fun  
Ive had my flings  
Gonna shake em all down  
Like the early Roman kings
