I get up every morning drink coffee alone  
My house its too quiet Im the only one home  
I let the newspapers pile up at the door  
I cant be bothered I dont read em no more  
The flowers are blooming that you planted last spring  
I cant make much sense out of anything  
  
If I could kidnap an angel Id clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
  
I get in the car like I do every day  
Wondering how in the world did it turn out this way  
Its just round the corner turn left and Im there  
Id do anything to be anywhere but here  
  
If I could kidnap an angel Id clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly  
Wed live forever forever wed never die  
If I could kidnap an angel  
  
Now the parking attendant knows my first name  
These long green hallways all look the same  
Theres four elevators one goes to that floor  
I brace myself when I get to the door  
I close my eyes and take a deep breath  
Then sit down beside your hospital bed  
  
If I could kidnap an angel Id clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly  
Wed live forever forever wed never die  
If I could kidnap an angel if I could kidnap an angel  
  
Hed say the word hed tear down these walls  
People laughing like children through these hospital halls  
Thered be no more tears thered be no more blood  
Thered be nothing but smiles nothing but love  
If I could kidnap an angel if I could kidnap an angel
