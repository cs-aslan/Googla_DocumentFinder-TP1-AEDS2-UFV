I never felt magic crazy as this  
I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea  
I never held emotion in the palm of my hand  
Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree  
But now youre here  
Brighten my northern sky  
  
Ive been a long time that Im waiting  
Been a long that Im blown  
Ive been a long time that Ive wandered  
Through the people I have known  
Oh if you would and you could  
Straighten my new minds eye  
  
Would you love me for my money  
Would you love me for my head  
Would you love me through the winter  
Would you love me til Im dead  
Oh if you would and you could  
Come blow your horn on high  
  
I never felt magic crazy as this  
I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea  
I never held emotion in the palm of my hand  
Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree  
But now youre here  
Brighten my northern sky
