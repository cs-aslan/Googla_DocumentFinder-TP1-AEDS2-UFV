I dont know you  
And you dont know the half of it  
I had a starring role  
I was the bad guy who walked out  
They said be careful where you aim  
Cause where you aim you just might hit  
You can hold onto something so tight  
Youve already lost it  
  
Dragging me down  
Thats not the way it used to be  
You cant even remember  
What Im trying to forget  
  
It was a dirty day  
Dirty day  
  
Youre looking for explanations  
I dont even understand  
If you need someone to blame  
Throw a rock in the air  
Youll hit someone guilty  
  
From father to son  
In one life has begun  
A work thats never done  
Father to son  
  
And loveit wont last kissin time  
And loveit wont last kissin time  
And loveit wont last kissin time  
  
Get it right  
Theres no blood thicker than ink  
Hear what I say  
Nothings simple as you think  
  
Wake up  
Some things you cant get around  
Im in you  
More so when they put me in the ground  
  
These days days days run away like horses over the hill  
These days days days run away like horses over the hill
