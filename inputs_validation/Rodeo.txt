His eyes are cold and restless  
And His wounds have almost healed  
And shed give half of Texas  
Just to change the way he feels  
Cause she knows his loves in Tulsa  
And she knows hes gonna go  
But it aint no woman flesh and blood  
Its that damned old rodeo  
  
Well its bulls and blood  
Its dust and mud  
Its the roar of a Sunday crowd  
Its the white in his knuckles  
The gold in his buckle  
Hell win the next go round  
Its boots and chaps  
Its cowboy hats  
Its spurs and latigo  
Its the ropes and the reins  
And the joy and the pain  
And they call the thing rodeo  
  
She does her best to hold him  
When his love comes to call  
But his need for it controls him  
And her backs against the wall  
And its So long girl Ill see you  
When its time for him to go  
You know the woman wants her cowboy  
Like he wants his rodeo  
  
Well its bulls and blood  
Its dust and mud  
Its the roar of a Sunday crowd  
Its the white in the knuckles  
The gold in the buckle  
Hell win the next go round  
Its boots and chaps  
Its cowboy hats  
Its spurs and latigo  
Its the ropes and the reins  
And the joy and the pain  
And they call the thing rodeo  
  
Itll drive a cowboy crazy  
Itll drive the man insane  
And hell sell off everything he owns  
Just to pay to play her game  
And a broken home and some broken bones  
Is all hell have to show  
For all the years that he spent chasin  
This dream they call rodeo  
  
Well its bulls and blood  
Its dust and mud  
Its the roar of a Sunday crowd  
Its the white in them knuckles  
The gold in the buckle  
Hell win the next go round  
Its boots and chaps  
Its cowboy hats  
Its spurs and latigo  
Its the ropes and the reins  
And the joy and the pain  
And they call the thing rodeo  
Its the broncs and the blood  
Its the steers and the mud  
And they call the thing rodeo
