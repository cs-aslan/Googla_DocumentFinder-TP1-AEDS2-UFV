I need a lover that wont drive me crazy  
I need a lover that wont drive me crazy  
I need a lover that wont drive me crazy  
Some girl that knows the meaning of ah  
Hey hit the highway  
  
Well Ive been walking the streets in the evenin  
Racin through the human jungle at night  
Im so confused my mind is indifferent  
Hey  Im so weak wont somebody shut off that light  
  
Electricity runs through the video  
And I watch it from this hole I call home  
And all them stonies are dancin to the radio  
And I got the world callin me up free tonight on the phone  
  
I need a lover that wont drive me crazy  
Some girl wholl thrill me and then go away  
I need a lover that wont drive me crazy  
Some girl that knows the meaning of ah  
Hey hit the highway  
  
Well Im not wiped out by this poolroom life Im livin  
Im gonna quit this job and go to school and head back home  
head back home  
Now Im not asking to be loved or be forgiven  
Hey  I just cant face shakin in this bedroom  
One more night alone  
  
I need a lover that wont drive me crazy  
I need a lover that wont drive me crazy  
I need a lover that wont drive me crazy  
Some girl that knows the meaning of ah  
Hey hit the highway  
  
I need a lover that wont drive me crazy  
Some girl to thrill me and then go away  
I need a lover that wont drive me crazy  
Some girl that knows the meaning of ah  
Hey hit the highway  
  
You betcha
