Hello honey I just missed the train  
My watch must have stopped I guess  
Dinner is cold and the kids are asleep  
I didnt mean to get you out of bed  
  
Always late always late  
Yes its always the same  
Procrastination is my middle name  
But the rest of the world is ahead of the game  
And thats why Im always late  
  
Wont somebody give me a ride  
Ive been out of gas for hours  
My motherinlaws flying in from the coast  
Shes probably in an ambulance by now  
  
Willie its time to get up  
Willie you get out of that bed  
Youll be late for work again  
Willie Willie  
  
Come on honey give me a chance  
I promise to mend my ways  
Lets go out for an anniversary dance  
You say our anniversarys yesterday
