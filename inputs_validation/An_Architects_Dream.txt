Watching the painter painting  
And all the time the light is changing  
And he keeps painting  
That bit there it was an accident  
But hes so pleased  
Its the best mistake he could make  
And its my favorite piece  
Its just great  
  
The flick of a wrist  
Twisting down to the hips  
So the lovers begin with a kiss  
In a tryst  
Its just a smudge  
But what it becomes  
In his hands  
Curving and sweeping  
Rising and reaching  
I could feel what he was feeling  
Lines like these have got to be  
An architects dream  
  
Its always the same  
Whenever he works on a pavement  
It starts to rain  
And all the time  
The light is changing
