Well I hold the rope  
And I hold the sail  
And I kept my papers  
To keep from land in jail  
And I fought piranhas  
And I fought the cold  
There was no one with me  
I was all alone  
  
Well its Easter morning now  
And theres no one around  
So I unroll the cement  
And walk into the town  
There was no one with me  
I was all alone  
And I fought piranhas  
And I fought the cold  
  
Well you know what its like  
I dont got to tell you  
Who puts up a fight  
Walking out of hell now  
When you fought piranhas  
And you fought the cold  
Theres nobody with you  
Yes youre all alone  
Yeah
