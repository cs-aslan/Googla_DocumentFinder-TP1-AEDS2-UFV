I dress myself in black  
In black from head to heels  
I take my promise back  
Cause you dont know how it feels  
No you dont take me as I am  
No you dont want to know at all  
Who is the face behind the mask  
Ill be the one wholl make you fall  
Beware Beware Ill be the one  
The one to take you under  
Beware  
I hate the light of day  
Im happy when it rains  
The stars shine on my way  
But the memory remains  
No you dont take me as I am  
Beware Beware Ill be the one  
I am the nights revenge  
Ive got a soul to sell  
And yet a fist to clench  
So wait for me in hell  
Beware Beware Ill be the one  
Wait for me in hell  
Ill see you in hell
