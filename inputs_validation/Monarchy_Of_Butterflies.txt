Leavin town I found a flower that I could deserve Someone moves and  
Someones bound to get their feelings hurt Im loving you youre out of  
Range Wanted you youre out of range As I walked out into the world I  
Felt a sudden chill I was bleeding pretty good unto a daffodil Im loving  
You youre out of range Wanted you youre out of range I dont want too  
Much more than to be reborn in the mornin Reborn so I can feel ya The  
Bonds of blue reveal ya I feel ya I have your number and Ive dailed it up  
A hundred times Burried there your voice is cracking up across state  
Lines Im loving you youre out of range Wanted you youre out of range  
Skies of extacy were breaking while I do believe tears of god were falling  
Down upon my swollen cheeks Im loving you youre out of range Wanted you  
Youre out of range I dont want too much more than to be reborn in the  
Mornin Reborn so I can feel ya The bonds of blue reveal ya I feel ya  
And I know it hurts when its taken away I tell ya that I could be livin  
Today with you always thought you okay Watlz by the rain and its all  
Gonna change I dont want too much more than to be reborn in the mornin  
Reborn so I can feel ya The bonds of blue reveal ya I feel ya No sir  
Not too much more than to be reborn in the mornin Reborn so I can feel  
Ya The bonds of blue reveal ya I feel ya
