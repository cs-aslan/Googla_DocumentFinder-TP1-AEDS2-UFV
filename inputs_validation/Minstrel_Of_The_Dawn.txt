The minstrel of the dawn is here  
To make you laugh and bend your ear  
Up the steps youll hear him climb  
All full of thoughts all full of rhymes  
Listen to the pictures flow  
Across the room into your mind they go  
Listen to the strings  
They jangle and dangle  
While the old guitar rings  
The minstrel of the dawn is he  
Not too wise but oh so free  
Hell talk of life out on the street  
Hell play it sad and say it sweet  
Look into his shining face  
Of lonelines youll always find a trace  
Just like me and you  
Hes tryin to get into things  
More happy than blue  
  
A minstrel of the changin tide  
Hell ask for nothing but his pride  
Just sit him down upon that chair  
Go fetch some wine and set it there  
Listen to the pictures flow  
And follow the fingers where they go  
Listen to the strings  
They jangle and dangle  
While the old guitar rings  
  
A minstrel of the dawn is near  
Just like a step n fetchit here  
Hes like an old time troubador  
Just wanting life and nothing more  
Look into his shining eyes  
And if you see a ghost dont be surprised  
Like me and you  
Hes tryin to get into things  
More happy than blue  
  
The minstrel boy will understand  
He holds a promise in his hand  
He talks of better days ahead  
And by his words your fortunes read  
Listen to the pictures flow  
Across the room into your mind they go  
Listen to the strings  
They jangle and dangle  
While the old guitar rings  
  
The minstrel of the dawn is gone  
I hope hell call before too long  
And if you meet him you must be  
The victim of his minstrelsy  
Hell sing for you a song  
The minstrel of the dawn
