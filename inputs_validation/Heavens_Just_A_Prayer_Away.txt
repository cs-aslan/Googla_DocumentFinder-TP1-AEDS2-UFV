If youre trying to reach Heaven  
You talk to Jesus you talk to Him every day  
Cause Jesus knows He knows that you are coming  
And Heavens just a prayer away  
  
If you go if you go to church on Sunday  
You get down on your knees and pray  
And give your heart and your soul to Jesus  
Heavens just a prayer away  
  
You are just one prayer from Heaven  
As you travel down lifes highway  
Just when you think that you cant make it  
Well Heavens just a prayer away  
  
Of if you go if you go to church on Sunday  
You get down on your knees and pray  
And give your heart and give your soul to Jesus  
Heavens just a prayer away  
  
Heavens just a prayer away  
  
Away
