I thought I knew all it took to bother you  
Every word I said was true that youll see  
  
How could it be Im the only one who sees your rehearsed insanity  
  
I still refuse all the methods youve abused  
Its all right if youre confused let me be  
  
Ive been around all the pawns  
Youve gagged and bound  
Theyll come back and knock you down and Ill be free  
  
Ive taken all and Ive endured  
One day it all will fade  
Im sure  
  
I dont owe you anything  
  
I had no other hand in your ever desperate plan  
It returns and when it lands words are due  
  
I shouldve known we were better off alone  
I looked in and I was shown  
You were too  
  
Ive taken all and Ive endured  
One day it all will fade  
Im sure  
  
I dont owe you anything  
  
Ill stick around and learn from all that came from it
