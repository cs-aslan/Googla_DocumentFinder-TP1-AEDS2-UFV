Son Im 30  
I only went with your mother cause shes dirty  
And I dont have a decent bone in me  
What you get is just what you see yeah  
I see it so I take it freely  
And all the bad piss ugly things I feed me  
I never help or give to the needy  
Come on and see me  
  
I had to crucify some brother today  
And I dont dig what you gotta say  
So come on and say it  
Come on and tell me twice  
  
I said dad youre shabby  
You run around and groove like a baggy  
Youre only here just out of habit  
All thats mine you might as well have it  
You take ten feet back and then stab it  
Spray it on and tag it  
So sack on me  
I cant stand the needy  
Get around here if youre asking youre feeling  
  
I had to crucify somebody today  
And I dont dig what you gotta say  
So come on and say it  
Come on and tell me twice  
  
So sack all the needy  
I cant stand to leave it  
You come around here and you put both your feet in  
  
I had to crucify somebody today  
And I dont dig what you gotta say  
So go on and say it  
  
I had to crucify some brother today  
And I dont hear what you gotta say  
So come on and say it  
Come on and tell me twice
