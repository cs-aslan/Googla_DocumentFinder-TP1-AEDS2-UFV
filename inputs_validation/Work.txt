Five days outa seven  
Eight hours of every one  
Im tryin to buy a piece of heaven  
But Ill be gone before that heaven comes  
  
Work work work  
Who needs it  
Its all I ever seem to do  
Im killin myself for a livin  
  
Livin the working mans blues  
Minute to minute  
Day after day  
Wherever I go its always the same  
  
I work a little longer  
And make up my pay  
But when the cheque comes along  
Theyve taken half of it away  
  
All this work work work work  
Who needs it  
All all I ever seem to do  
Whyknow Im killin myself for a livin  
  
I should be stayin at home with you  
City to city  
All over the world  
Wherever Ive been to  
  
Thats all I ever heard  
You work a little longer  
To double up on that pay  
Then the tax man comes along  
  
Theyve taken half of it away  
Work work work  
Who needs it  
Its all I ever seem to do  
  
Im killin killin killin time for a livin  
Livin the working mans blues  
Yeah work work work  
Oh my  
  
Thats all it is  
Killin myself for a livin  
Like drivin a nail straight into my hand  
Ive been working my life away  
  
Thats right  
Working my life away  
Im working my life  
All this work work work  
  
Working my life away  
Working my life away  
You know sometimes I get home in the evenin  
And lay in bed at night just dreamin  
  
I had enough a whole pay cheque sittin in my hand  
So we can split it between the two of us  
And buy that big mansion on the hill  
Where that rich guy lives  
  
Who says he pays me every week  
Oh I dont want to work no more  
I cant stand it
