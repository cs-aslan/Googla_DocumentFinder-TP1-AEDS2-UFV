How can I begin to  
Tell you what you do to  
Me every time I hear ya  
More willing to wanna see ya  
  
I know that theres no use in  
Tryin to explain the confusion  
But still Im not complainin  
Bout my situation  
  
Lets not talk about a  
Possible ending  
  
The very first time that I  
Was lookin to be your fellow  
I found my inspiration  
Hidin in your expression  
So I put myself on forward  
For your consideration  
  
Chorus  
Lets not talk about a  
Possible ending  
Lets not think about it  
Every day  
And I know  
Im so  
In love  
With you  
Im finding it harder and harder to breath  
Every time Im near  
My beautiful woman  
  
And so we put the top down  
To take you drivin downtown  
I guess well know just what to do  
When youre lookin to fool around  
  
Its too late to stop me  
I know were gonna get down  
  
Chorus  
  
My beautiful woman  
My beautiful woman  
My beautiful woman  
  
B is for beautiful as the sunshine  
E tells me everything is feelin alright  
A goes to  
You and me swingin it down  
T is two  
I want you  
Youve got me actin like a fool  
  
Chorus
