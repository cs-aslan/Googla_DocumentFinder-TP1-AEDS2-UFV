Times are hard  
Youre afraid to pay the fee  
So you find yourself somebody  
Who can do the job for free  
When you need a bit of lovin  
Cause your man is out of town  
Thats the time you get me runnin  
And you know Ill be around  
  
Chorus  
Im a fool to do your dirty work  
Oh yeah  
I dont want to do your dirty work  
No more  
Im a fool to do your dirty work  
Oh yeah  
  
Light the candle  
Put the lock upon the door  
You have sent the maid home early  
Like a thousand times before  
Like the castle in its corner  
In a medieval game  
I foresee terrible trouble  
And I stay here just the same  
  
Chorus
