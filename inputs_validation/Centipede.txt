Centipede  
Centipede  
  
Your love is like a raging fire  
Youre a snake thats on the loose  
The strike is your desire  
But when the centipede is hot  
Youre bound to feel the fire  
But when the centipede is hot  
Youre bound to feel the fire  
  
I feel oh yeah a longing for your touch  
Like you crawled into the bathroom window  
To give him all your love  
Like a centipede thats hot  
The fire is in your touch  
Just like a centipede youve got  
A lot of loving to touch  
  
Dont you know  
In the quiet of the night  
Is when the snake is in the crawlin  
And the moon starts to glow then disappear  
When the time is really right  
Is when the centipede is crawlin  
Youll be crying in the night  
So many tears  
And crawlin like a centipede  
Centipede  
  
You came to strike him with your love  
Like you crawled into the bathroom window  
To bite him with your love  
Like a centipede thats hot  
The fire is in your touch  
Just like a centipede youve got  
A lot of lovin to touch  
  
Dont you know  
In the quiet of the night  
Is when the snake is in the crawlin  
And the moon starts to glow then disappear  
When the time is really right  
Is when the centipede is crawlin  
Youll be crying in the night  
So many tears  
And crawlin like a centipede  
Centipede  
  
In the quiet of the night  
Is when the snake is in the crawlin  
And the moon starts to glow then disappear  
When the time is really right  
Is when the centipede is crawlin  
Youll be crying in the night  
So many tears  
  
In the quiet of the night  
Is when the snake is in the crawlin  
And the moon starts to glow then disappear  
Like a centipede  
When the time is really right  
Is when the centipede is crawlin  
Youll be crying in the night  
So many tears  
And crawlin like a centiped  
Centipede  
Centipede
