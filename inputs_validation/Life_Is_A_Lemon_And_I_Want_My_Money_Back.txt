I want my money back  
I want my money back  
Its all or nothing  
  
And nothings all I ever get  
Every time I turn it on  
I burn it up and burn it out  
  
Its always something  
Theres always something going wrong  
Thats the only guarantee  
Thats what this is all about  
  
Its a never ending attack  
Everythings a lie and thats a fact  
Life is a lemon and I want my money back  
  
And all the morons  
And all the stooges with their coins  
Theyre the ones who make the rules  
Its not a game its just a rout  
  
Theres desperation  
Theres desperation in the air  
It leaves a stain on all your clothes  
And no detergant gets it out  
  
And were always slipping through the the cracks  
Then the movies over fade to black  
Life is a lemon and I want my money back  
  
I want my money back  
I want my money back  
  
What about love  
Its defective  
Its always breaking in half  
  
What about sex  
Its defective  
Its never built to really last  
  
What about your family  
Its defective  
All the batteries are shot  
  
What about your friends  
Theyre defective  
All the parts are out of stock  
  
What about hope  
Its defective  
Its corroded and decayed  
  
What about faith  
Its defective  
Its tattered and its frayed  
  
What about your Gods  
Theyre defective  
They forgot the warranty  
  
What about your town  
Its defective  
Its a dead end street to me  
  
What about your school  
Its defective  
Its a pack of useless lies  
  
What about your work  
Its defective  
Its a crock and then you die  
  
What about your childhood  
Its defective  
Its dead and buried in the past  
  
What about your future  
Its defective  
And you can shove it up your ass  
  
I want my money back  
I want my money back  
  
Its all or nothing  
And nothings all I ever get  
Every time I turn it on  
I burn it up and burn it out  
  
Its a never ending attack  
Everythings a lie and thats a fact  
Life is a lemon and I want my money back  
  
And were always slipping through the the cracks  
Then the movies overfade to black  
Life is a lemon and I want my money back
