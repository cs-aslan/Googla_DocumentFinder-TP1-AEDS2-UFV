Baby dont you wait that long  
You told me underneath that song  
But theres somethin bout the way you move  
Yeah it gets to me like a melody  
  
I dont wanna wait all night  
Cause soon its gonna pass me by  
I only wanna make you smile  
Let me get to you like I always do  
  
Show me how you really feel  
Make it all go and disappear  
We can dance into the night  
Come together and well make it right  
Come together and well make it  
  
We got more than a lifetime  
To make it all feel right  
So dont apologize  
You gotta be wrong sometimes  
We got more than a lifetime  
To live inside these lines  
We were right all along  
You gotta be wrong  
Gotta be wrong sometimes  
  
Every little thing you say  
Got me lifted and Im on my way  
Baby come with me you dont have to stay  
You follow me like a memory  
  
Show me how you really feel  
Make it all go and disappear  
We can dance into the night  
Come together and well make this right  
Come together and well make it right  
  
We got more than a lifetime  
To make it all feel right  
So dont apologize  
You gotta be wrong sometimes  
We got more than a lifetime  
To live inside these lines  
We were right all along  
You gotta be wrong  
Gotta be wrong sometimes  
  
Maybe the world will let us stay  
Give us back what it took away  
Or maybe Im just high so high  
Somewhere out there in between  
Being wrong and being clean  
I see it all inside your eyes  
  
We got more than a lifetime  
To lose our mind  
Im ready to fall we gotta be wrong  
  
You move like a melody  
Everything theyve got youve seen  
Thats why you keep coming back to me for so long  
We got to get wrong  
You move like a melody  
Everything theyve got youve seen  
Thats why you keep holding on to me for so long  
We got to get wrong  
  
We got more than a lifetime  
To make it all feel right  
So dont apologize  
You gotta be wrong sometimes  
We got more than a lifetime  
To live inside these lines  
We were right all along  
You gotta be wrong  
Gotta be wrong sometimes
