Saw a girl that I used to know  
I was deep in thought at the time  
To recognize the face at first  
Cause I was probably looking at mine  
Well she was the only girl Ive ever loved  
But my folks didnt dig her so much  
I was young  
This is serious  
To me she was the world she was my world now  
I thought Id never live without her  
But I got by in time  
  
Well let me tell you now  
Saw a guy that I used to know  
Man hed changed so much  
I think it hurt him to say hello  
Cause he hardly opened his mouth  
Yeah well he was my best friend a few years ago  
Truly inseparable  
  
We were young  
We were full of ideals  
We were gonna pull this whole world  
But something happened  
I didnt know why  
But thats the way that it goes  
  
I suppose  
What you say  what you do  
Dont mean nothing nothing at all  
And all the bonds you make between ya  
Can be broken any time you want now  
Please tell me if my philosophys wrong  
Ive got to know the truth  
I dont mean to offend anyone but  
You know its something that I do oh  
  
So nice to see you tonight  
And Im so glad that you came  
Some of the people standing outside say  
Sure feel the same  
Yeah my point is in a round about way  
Given time hell always forget  
Cause the memories  
That  me on  
To me everything youre everything now  
And it always will be mine yeah  
And no one can take them away
