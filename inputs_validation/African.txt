Dont care where you come from  
As long as youre a black man  
Youre an African  
  
No mind your nationality  
You have got the identity of an African  
  
Cause if you come from Clarendon  
And if you come from Portland  
And if you come from Westmoreland  
Youre an African  
  
Chorus  
No mind your nationality  
Youve got the identity of an African  
  
Cause if you come Trinidad  
And if you come from Nassau  
And if you come from Cuba  
Youre an African

No mind your complexion  
There is no rejection

If your complexion low low low  
And if your plexion in between  
Youre an African  
  
Chorus  
  
No mind denomination  
That is only segregation  
Youre an African  
  
Cause if you go to the Catholic  
And if you go to the Methodist  
And if you go to the Church of Gods  
Youre an African  
  
Chorus  
  
No mind your nationality

And if you come from Weesday  
And if you come from Wingstead  
And if you come from France
