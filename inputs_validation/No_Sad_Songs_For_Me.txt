Tom Springfield  
  
The Springfields  
  
No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
Its all over  
  
I walk around imagining  
The way youll say goodbye  
And when you try to tell me  
I just hope that I wont cry  
  
No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
Its all over  
  
The glow has gone forever  
And our dreams have turned to dust  
I dont know how I can go on  
And yet I know I must  
  
No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
Its all over  
  
It breaks my heart to feel this way  
Although I try to smile  
To think Ill be alone again  
In just a little while  
  
No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
Its all over  
Its all over  
Its all over
