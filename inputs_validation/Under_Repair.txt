La La La La  
La La La La  
  
I understand you feel that I get tired of looking after you  
You even start to think that Ive been meaning  
To do this to you  
If you only knew how much of me wants to tell you  
All this passes  
  
Take your time reconsider til I find my place in you  
Take your time to let your ache go away  
  
No harm done youre under repair  
No harm done youre under repair  
No harm done youre under repair  
  
La La La La  
La La La La  
  
Sick and tired of taking the mellow beating of the  
Stupid games we play  
We run around but Im done needing this hurt  
Ive stayed too long but Im taking you with me  
Youre too beautiful to be seen here  
  
No harm done youre under repair  
No harm done youre under repair  
No harm done youre under repair  
  
La La La La  
La La La La
