Was always waiting for the crush  
The car to drive right through the shops  
To call in sick and late at work  
And take a holiday  
  
Was always tangled up in knots  
To keep myself from speaking up  
But noones listening anyway  
Just trying to bribe me  
  
And if its alright then what am I doing here  
And if its alright this place is gassed by fear  
And if its alright Ill tell you cause you never understand  
And if its alright Ill beg you cause Im a begging kind of man  
  
Today I wrote a bad cheque  
Packed a bag and took a jet  
But noones looking anyway  
I hope they miss me  
  
I just think maybe Im making a mistake
