Let me tell you bout myself  
Some say I got a bad attitude  
Let me tell you bout myself  
Some say I got a lot to prove  
  
Let me tell you bout myself  
Ill do whatever you want  
Ill do what you ask me to  
Ill do what you tell me to do  
No  
  
Strange love  
Be gone  
Be gone  
Gone  
  
Let me tell you bout myself  
Some say I got a long way to go  
Some say Im going straight down  
Some say theres no where to go  
And this is what I say  
  
Yeah yeah  
Strange love  
Be gone  
Be gone  
  
Strange love  
Be gone  
Be gone
