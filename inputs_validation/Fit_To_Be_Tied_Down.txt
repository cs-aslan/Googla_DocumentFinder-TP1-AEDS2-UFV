Ive always been the travelin kind  
Another town was on my mind  
Its not my fault that I was just  
Born with a case of wonder lust  
  
But Im changing fast  
Youll put it all in my past  
No more running around  
Feel like Im fit to be tied down  
  
Ive loved some women in my time  
So Ill leave some broken hearts behind  
I know theyll cuss me that much more  
But Ive found what Ive been searchin for  
  
Cause Im changing fast  
Youll put it all in my past  
No more running around  
Im finally fit to be tied down  
  
Feel like Im fit to be tied down
