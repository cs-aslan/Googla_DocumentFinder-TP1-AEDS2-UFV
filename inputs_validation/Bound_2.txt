Bound to fall in love  
Bound to fall in love Uhhuh honey  
  
All them other niggas lame and you know it now  
When a real nigga hold you down you supposed to drown bound  
  
Bound to fall in love  
Bound to fall in love Uhhuh honey  
  
What you doing in the club on a Thursday  
She say she only here for her girl birthday  
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty  
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty  
I know I got a bad reputation  
Walking round always mad reputation  
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation  
Start a Fight Club Brad reputation  
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement  
Ill turn the plane round your ass keep complaining  
How you gon be mad on vacation  
Dutty wining round all these Jamaicans  
Uh this that prom shit  
This that what we do dont tell your mom shit  
This that red cup all on the lawn shit  
Got a fresh cut straight out the salon bitch  
  
I know youre tired of loving of loving  
With nobody to love nobody nobody Uhhuh honey  
  
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures  
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches bound  
  
Bound to fall in love  
Bound to fall in love Uhhuh honey  
  
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink  
After that give you something to drink  
Step back cant get spunk on the mink  
I mean damn what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think  
Hey you remember where we first met  
Okay I dont remember where we first met  
But hey admitting is the first step  
And hey you know aint nobody perfect  
And I know with the hoes I got the worst rep  
But hey their backstroke Im tryna perfect  
And hey ayo we made it Thanksgiving  
So hey maybe we can make it to Christmas  
She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist  
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches  
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps  
But first you gon remember how to forget  
After all these longass verses  
Im tired you tired Jesus wept  
  
I know youre tired of loving of loving  
With nobody to love nobody nobody  
So just grab somebody no leaving this party  
With nobody to love nobody nobody Uhhuh honey  
  
Jeromes in the house watch your mouth  
Jeromes in the house watch your mouth  
  
Bound to fall in love  
Bound to fall in love Uhhuh honey
