Found on your move and the very best of america  
  
Ive been in love girl so many times before  
Theyd love me and leave me i thought i knew the score  
Id fall in love no more  
I was walking in shadows then my life a lonely road  
I was walking to nowhere with a heavy loaded heart  
To laugh i played the part

I saw you as you walked my way  
Here she comes my kinda woman

And i cant help but tell you that you are you are  
Yes you know you are
