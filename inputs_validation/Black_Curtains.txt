Hey look around you  
Everythings helterskelter  
Listen up I warn you  
Run for cover run  
Bang it happened  
Times up Armageddon  
Fire meltdown  
The sky is crumbling in  
Black curtains never ending  
Escape youre joking  
Cant find no place to run  
Hair is burning  
My flesh is bubbling up  
Blood is boiling  
Taste copper on my tongue  
Fate is coming  
Welcome it with a smile  
Black curtains never ending fall  
Somethings under my skin  
Somethings very strange  
Playing with my mind  
Tempting me to do you in  
Am I dreaming My heart pounds my chest  
Held for ransom in a spiders web  
Suffocating no one hears my calls  
Never ending till the black curtain falls  
Snakes surround me  
Offering their death kiss to me  
Down Im drowning  
How long I hold my breath  
Dogs are chasing  
My legs are paralyzed  
Pray dont find me  
My life is fading fast
