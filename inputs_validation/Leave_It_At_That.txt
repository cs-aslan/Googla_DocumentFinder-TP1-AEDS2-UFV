One two three yeah  
  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
  
Oh yea  
  
What does a walk in the park mean  
How bout a kiss when were driving  
How much for the flutter in your heart  
What does a scent of a rose say  
Cause if you look at it that way  
You know its gonna make you fall apart  
  
You squeeze so tight whenever you hold me  
Know that our hearts are right where they should be  
  
Leave it at that  
Dont look for ways to complicate and analyze it  
Leave it at that  
Or this will disappear before you realize it  
I know you want to say its love but lets just say its close enough  
Leave at that oh  
  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
  
Oh no what is it about me  
That makes you think you should doubt me  
Wonder where this song might lead  
Why do you have to explain it  
Til there is nothing remaining  
Isnt happy all you need  
  
Look in my eyes when were dancing slowly  
Know that our hearts are right where they should be  
  
So leave it at that  
Dont look for ways to complicate or analyze it  
Leave it at that  
Or this will disappear before you realize it  
I know you want to say its love but lets just say its close enough  
Leave at that oh  
  
Dont read my mind  
Dont search for signs  
Dont waste your time  
Just looking for words between the lines  
Baby dont you feel  
This loves so real  
By now all we have to do is  
  
Leave it at that  
Dont look for ways to complicate and analyze it  
Leave it at that  
Or this will disappear before you realize it  
I know you need to say its love but lets just say its close enough  
Leave at that oh  
  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Just leave it at that  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Just leave it at that
