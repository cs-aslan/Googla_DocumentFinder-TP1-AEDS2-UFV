Ive foudn a great deal of satisfaction  
Thinking that you think of me  
Ive found each day  
Bring a new sunshine  
There is no tomorrow  
For us to borrow  
Why cant you find  
What you are needing in me  
If I could only change your mind  
  
I found no effort at all  
In showing what Im feeling you  
I find it hard each day just knowing  
Theres no tomorrow for us to borrow  
Why wont you find  
What you are needing in me  
If I could only change your mind
