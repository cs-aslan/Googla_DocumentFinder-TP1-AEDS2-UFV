Roll over baby the time has come  
to make a little bit more room  
Ive hung around you its getting tough  
I think Im gonna break down soon  
  
I remember crying in the park it was getting dark  
Suddenly I looked up  
You were my sky  
So go on and  
Sleep darling  
Why dont you pretend we were just a dream  
Its cool baby  
It doesnt matter anyway  
Im so sorry  
We got to the station a little too late  
Its such a shame  
We just missed the train  
  
Be quiet angel dont make a sound  
Save it for a rainy day  
Oh cant you see me Im such a mess  
trying hard to find my way  
  
Do you remember wasting all that time we were feeling fine  
Though we couldnt walk a line  
We were alright  
  
So go on and  
Sleep darling  
Why dont you pretend we were just a dream  
Its cool baby  
It doesnt matter anyway  
Im so sorry  
We got to the station a little too late  
Its such a shame  
We just missed the train  
  
Oh whyd that train just pass us by  
Didnt anyone see  
We were stuck at the light  
Or we wouldve made it on time  
  
So sleep darling  
Why dont you pretend we were just a dream  
Its cool baby  
It doesnt matter anyway  
Im so sorry  
We got to the station a little too late  
Its such a shame  
We just missed the train
