Im gonna drive on out  
To the river tonight  
Find a quiet spot  
Turn on my parking lights  
Im gonna drink some beers  
Try to catch a buzz  
Turn my radio up  
And forget about us  
  
Im gonna lay me down  
On the hood of this car  
Make another wish  
Upon a falling star  
Im gonna think again  
About the way it was  
Im gonna close my eyes  
And forget about us  
  
Chorus  
I know it wont be easy  
But Ive got a plan  
To just let my memory let go of your hand  
Im gonna miss your touch  
But I know I must  
Forget about us  
  
When the morning sun  
Burns across my face  
Ill put my shirt back on  
Get up and walk away  
Im gonna climb my frame  
Onto a greyhound bus  
Take a little blue pill  
And forget about us  
  
Chorus  
  
By the time I get to Phoenix  
I wont know your name  
Those soft green eyes  
Warm skin  
And the way you say good morning  
And Ill be alright
