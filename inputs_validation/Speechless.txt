Your love is magical thats how I feel  
But I have not the words here to explain  
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion  
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain  
To tell you how I feel  
But I am speechless speechless  
Thats how you make me feel  
Though Im with you I am far away and nothing is for real  
When Im with you I am lost for words I dont know what to say  
My heads spinning like a carousel so silently I pray  
Helpless and hopeless thats how I feel inside  
Nothings real but all is possible if God is on my side  
When Im with you I am in the light where I cannot be found  
Its as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground  
Speechless speechless thats how you make me feel  
Though Im with you I am far away and nothing is for real  
Ill go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face  
Theres no mountain high I cannot climb  
Im humbled in your grace  
Speechless speechless thats how you make me feel  
Though Im with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real  
Speechless speechless thats how you make me feel  
Though Im with you I am far away and nothing is for real  
Speechless speechless thats how you make me feel  
Though Im with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real  
Speechless your love is magical thats how I feel  
But in your presence I am lost for words  
Words like I love you
