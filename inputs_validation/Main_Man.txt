Youre my main man  
When you call my heart goes sailin  
My feet refuse to touch the ground  
When you come around  
Youre my main man  
Thats what the neighborhoods been sayin  
Even Mother knows your name  
Ill take your love and never be the same  
  
Oh youre my main man  
I am your only woman  
Oh youre my main man  
Forever  
  
Youre my main man  
Paid the gypsy to keep prayin  
Ill keep a candle lit for love  
And watch the street  
For you from up above  
  
Oh youre my main man  
I am your only woman  
Oh youre my main man  
Forever  
  
Youre my main man  
When you call my heart goes sailin  
Ill keep a candle lit for love  
And watch the street  
For you from up above  
  
Oh youre my main man  
I am your only woman  
Oh youre my main man  
Forever
