if its my time to die today  
please God oh make it fast  
balanced on this point for a year and half  
I just dont think I can last  
  
theres a man whos laid to rest  
the man who gave me my start  
I wish I could quit but I cant and its rough  
quick is the beat of my heart  
quick is the beat of my heart  
  
so please all you people  
dont you grieve for me  
the blood in my veins is black and I cant bleed  
  
Ive suffered the pain  
and all I can face is the dark  
oh Lord quick is the beat of my heart  
quick is the beat of my heart  
  
now my bags are almost packed  
the trains about to depart  
I wish I could quit but I cant and its rough  
quick is the beat of my heart  
quick is the beat of my heart  
quick is the beat of my heart  
quick is the beat of my heart  
quick is the beat of my heart  
quick is the beat of my heart  
  
if its my time to die
