If you dont look into your mind and find out  
what youre running from  
tomorrow might just be another day to run  
If you just sit and waste your time youll be  
going where youre coming from think about that  
tomorrow might be just another day to run  
Someone must control your mind  
youre the one  
dark confusions what you find when you run  
I dont want to waste your time but Im talking  
to you like a son  
Tomorrow might be just another day to run  
Walking down the road of life looking for direction sometimes  
my mind gets so mixed up I cant tell lust from affection  
Gonna stop in to a roadside church and get my mind a rest  
and Lord Jesus help me get my soul together in the process  
Pretty ladies stand in line waiting for inspection  
ragged old men drinking wine trying to drown rejection  
Ive been wasting too much time Im going to lose my  
mind unless Lord Jesus  
You help me get my soul together in the process  
I see Tony Jr fill up his arm with dope and dream  
about a valley but he lives in an alley  
filled with papers thrown away  Lord tell me  
Hes long on dreams and short on hope and sometimes  
he goes to rallies and stops by to see Sally just  
to pass the time away  
Lord tell me Tony tell me why do you want to get high  
enough to die
