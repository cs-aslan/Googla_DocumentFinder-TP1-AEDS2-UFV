I know what youve been waiting for  
A little love and happiness  
The truth in front of you so hard to ignore  
All you need is tenderness  
So drop the Norma Jean  
I aint no James Dean  
Just let it flow no need to fake it babe  
We can make it babe if we just let it go  
Its only natural baby  
You and me dancing close  
This could be love  
You never know  
Just take my hand now baby  
We can move it out on the floor  
This could be the love that youve waited for  
Dont sit around and dream  
Lets do the natural thing  
Youre thinking maybe Im just breaking the rules  
By coming on a little strong  
But I got information you can use  
Do lighten up and play along  
Lets have a wing ding a little spring thing  
Dont tell me no  
I dont want no wedding ring aint rushing anything  
Just let the good times roll  
Its only natural baby  
You and me dancing close  
This could be love  
You never know  
Just take my hand now baby  
We can move it out on the floor  
This could be the love that youve waited for  
Dont sit around and dream  
Lets do the natural thing  
So drop the Norma Jean  
I aint no James Dean  
Just let it flow no need to fake it babe  
We can make it babe if we just let it go  
Its only natural baby  
You and me dancing close  
This could be love  
You never know  
Just take my hand now baby  
We can move it out on the floor  
This could be the love that youve waited for  
Dont sit around and dream  
Lets do the natural thing
