Nowadays  
  
Ladies and gentlemen miss Roxie Hart says goodnight  
  
Its good isnt it grand isnt it great  
Isnt it swell isnt it fun isnt it nowadays  
Theres men everywhere jazz everywhere booze  
Everywhere life everywhere joy everywhere nowadays  
  
You can like the life youre living  
You can live the life your like  
You can even marry Harry  
But mess around with Ike  
  
And thats good isnt it grand isnt it great  
Isnt it swell isnt it fun isnt it But nothings stays  
  
You can like the life youre living  
You can live the life your like  
You can even marry Harry  
But mess around with Ike  
  
And thats good isnt it grand isnt it great  
Isnt it swell isnt it  
  
thats great well be in touch
