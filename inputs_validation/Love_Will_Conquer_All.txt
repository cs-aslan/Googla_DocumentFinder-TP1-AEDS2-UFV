Here we are  
Out here me and you  
Reaching out each other  
Is all that we can do  
  
Here we stand  
Trying not to fall  
Theres no need to worry  
Love will conquer all  
  
Do you really want to know  
Just how long love will last  
Will all of the bad times pass  
How can we make things right  
  
Ooh and why  
Why is the world so unkind  
We surely can find peace of mind  
If we only see the light cant we see that  
  
Here we are  
Out here me and you  
Reaching out each other  
Is all that we can do  
  
Ooh here we stand  
Trying not to fall  
Theres no need to worry  
Love will conquer all  
  
Can somebody tell me why  
Why do our dreams go wrong  
Why cant we all belong  
Ooh where do we start  
Oh and tell me when  
When will we ever learn  
Theres nowhere else we can turn  
The truth is in our hearts here we are together  
Sometimes the road gets hard to travel  
Sometimes the pains too much to bear  
Sometimes when life seems to unravel  
Thats the time oh  to say  
Were gonna make it anyway  
Cant we see that  
  
Here we are  
Out here me and you  
Reaching out each other  
Is all that we can do  
  
Here we stand  
Trying not to fall  
Theres no need to worry  
Love will conquer all
