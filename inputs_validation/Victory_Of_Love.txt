Waiting  
For a change in the weather  
Im waiting for a shift in the air  
Could we get it together ever  
Hoping for your return hoping for your sweet sweet  
Return  
Hello  
Is this heaven calling  
Hello hello is somebody there she must be somewhere  
And then she says hello hello hello  
Shes really an angel  
She stands in the sunshine  
Shes closing her eyes she starting to dream  
Shes pulling the strings  
Shes dreaming a strange dream  
  
Where nothing is grey  
Then she takes me away and shes pulling the strings  
When shes playing with love  
Shes playing with love  
Counting  
I count every second  
And Im standing  
I stand in the rain I walk up that lane  
Which leads to the sunshine  
She stands in the sunshine  
Shes closing her eyes  
Then she takes me away and shes pulling the strings  
When shes playing with love  
Shes playing with love
