Ian hunter  
  
Well the times gettin hard for you little girl  
Im a hummin and a strummin all over gods world  
You dont remember when you got your last meal  
And you forgot just how a woman feels  
You didnt know what rock n roll was  
Until you met a drummer on a greyhound bus  
I got there in the nick of time  
Before he got his hands across your state line  
  
Well in the middle of the night  
On the open road  
And the heater dont work and its ohso cold  
Youre gettin tired baby youre lookin kinda beat  
The music of the street drive you off your feet  
You didnt know how rock n roll looked  
Until you caught your sister with a guy from the group  
Halfway home in the parking lot  
By the look in her eyes she was givin what she got  
  
Once bitten twice shy babe  
  
Woman youre a mess gonna die in your sleep  
All the blood on my hand and my les paul heat  
I cant leave you home cos youre runnin around  
My best friend told me youre the best trick in town  
  
You didnt know that rock n roll burned  
So you bought a candle and you loved and you learned  
You got the rhythm you got the speed  
Mammas little baby likes it short and sweet  
  
Once bitten twice shy babe  
  
I didnt know ya got a rock n roll record  
Until a saw your picture on another guys jacket  
You told me I was the only one  
And look at you now well its dark as its dumb  
  
Once bitten twice shy babe
