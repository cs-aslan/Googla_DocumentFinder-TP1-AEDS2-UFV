Girl dont you say  
Girl dont you make  
Girl dont you make  
Make me cry  
Make me cry  
  
You had my life  
In the palm of your hand  
Why you threw it away  
Ill never ever understand  
  
You took away the best part  
The best part of me  
You took away you  
How cruel could you be  
  
Youre just another heartache  
Ive got to learn to take  
Youre just another habit  
I have to learn to break  
  
Am I alone again  
Am I alone again  
Am I alone alone alone  
  
Dont say goodbye again  
Dont say goodbye again  
Dont make me cry cry cry  
Dont say goodbye again  
Dont say goodbye again  
Dont make me cry cry cry again  
Again again  
  
The more I try the more you hurt me  
Why  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
  
I can take an Aspirin  
For a bad headache  
But what pill for loneliness can I take  
  
I can seal to you  
Just like cellophane  
But I need you baby  
Like a star needs fame  
  
Youre not another habit  
I have to learn to break  
Lets try to patch it up  
Before its too late  
  
Im in love with you  
Im in love with you  
Im in love in love in love  
  
Dont say goodbye again  
Dont say goodbye again  
Dont make me cry cry cry  
Dont say goodbye again  
Dont say goodbye again  
Dont make me cry cry cry again  
  
The more I try the more you hurt me  
Why  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
  
The more I try the more you hurt me  
Why  
Tell me why  
Tell me why
