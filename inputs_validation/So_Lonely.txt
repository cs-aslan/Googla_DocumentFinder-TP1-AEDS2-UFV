Oh I dont get no letters  
Nobody calls  
Nobody comes round here no more  
No pretty ladies  
Nor pretty boys  
Nobody comes round my door no more  
  
Its just lonely yeah  
Mama you dont know  
Its just lonely yeah  
Mama you dont know  
  
Cops treat ya dirty  
And the children treat ya mean  
This is the lowest town Ive ever seen  
People keep draggin their bodies around  
Aint enough pride to even look around  
  
Its just lonely yeah  
Mama you dont know  
Its just lonely yeah  
Mama you dont know  
  
Now honey you got on little light  
Now you keep it burning bright  
If you keep it lit every night  
Someday a good man come and make it alright  
  
Its just so lonely yeah  
Mama you dont know  
Its just lonely yeah  
Mama you dont know
