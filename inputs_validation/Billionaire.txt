I wanna be a billionaire so freakin bad  
Buy all of the things I never had  
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine  
Smilin next to Oprah and the Queen  
  
Oh every time I close my eyes  
I see my name in shining lights  
Yeah a different city every night oh  
I swear the world better prepare for when Im a billionaire  
  
Yeah I would have a show like Oprah  
I would be the host of everyday Christmas  
Give Artie a wish list  
Id probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt  
And adopt a bunch of babies that aint never had it  
Give away a few Mercedes like here lady have this  
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish  
Its been a couple months that Ive been single so  
You can call me Artie Claus minus the Ho Ho  
Get it hehe Id probably visit where Katrina hit  
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did  
Yeah cant forget about me stupid  
Everywhere I go Ima have my own theme music  
  
Oh every time I close my eyes  
I see my name in shining lights  
A different city every night oh I  
I swear the world better prepare  
For when Im a billionaire  
Oh ooh oh ooh for when Im a billionaire  
Oh ooh oh ooh for when Im a billionaire  
  
Ill be playing basketball with the President  
Dunking on his delegates  
Then Ill compliment him on his political etiquette  
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it  
But keep the fives twentys tens and bens completely separate  
And yeah Ill be in a whole new tax bracket  
We in recession but let me take a crack at it  
Ill probably take whatevers left and just split it up  
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks  
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was  
Eating good sleeping soundly  
I know we all have a similar dream  
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet  
And put it in the air and sing  
  
I wanna be a billionaire so freakin bad
