Theres diamonds in the avenue  
As the dayshift turns to night  
In the empire dinner dreaming  
Hard rain fluorescent lights  
And the waitress fills my coffee cup  
As the working girls go by  
Drenched Irish cops are dreaming sex  
And peep show alibis  
Everything underneath the skyline  
From the east side to the west  
I see the miracles in real time  
And theres one Ive loved the best  
I see theres an angel on the D train  
And shes flying to my world  
And Im waiting for a a New York City girl  
Times Square looks like Avalon  
In a Disney Morphine dream  
Dylan Thomas rides a white horse drunk  
At the counter next to me  
I wake up in her bed sometimes  
And watch her as she sleeps  
In the silence and the sirens  
I pray her soul to keep  
Everything underneath the skyline  
From the east side to the west  
I see the miracles in real time  
And theres one Ive loved the best  
See theres an angel on the D train  
And shes flying to my world  
And Im waiting for a New York City girl  
The Catherine wheel burns bright tonight  
Down on the avenue  
But nowhere near as bright my love  
As the fire that burns for you  
Everything underneath the skyline  
From the east side to the west  
Of the lives Ive lived and those Ive known  
There is one Ive loved the best  
See theres an angel on the D train  
And shes flying to my world  
And Im waiting for a New York City girl  
Oh yeah and Im waiting for a New York City girl  
Im waiting now  
New York City girl  
Oh yeah Im waiting for  
New York City girl  
Oh yeah yeah  
New York City girl
