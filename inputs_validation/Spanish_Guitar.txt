Talking to demons that fly through the room  
When Im home late and shes gone out of tune  
No more excuses Im being locked out  
The key to her heart will never be found  
I cant get close to the one that I love  
I try to reason but thats not enough  
It was all right then love was there in a friend  
Cold nights on sofas the birds sing all night  
Their song my story which sums up my life  
The life Im losing the love Ill regret  
No sheets no pillows to make up by bed  
Upon the toilet I think very hard  
Loves in the tune of my Spanish guitar  
And were together now harmonys been found  
And the Spanish guitar can play  
Strum strum strumming away  
Shes the guitar that went out of tune  
But now shes in love with you  
In love with you in love with you
