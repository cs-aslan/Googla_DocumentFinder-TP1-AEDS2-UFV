Its my life  
Yeah I know  
Its not a perfect one but  
Its a life  
I can live with  
  
But you dont know  
If you can  
And you dont know  
If you want  
Cause you dont know  
If Im the right one  
And you dont know  
Well let me tell you  
  
Theres  
Something inside  
Thats freaking me out  
Please dont  
Leave me alone  
Something inside me  
Is wearing me out  
Please dont  
Dont do it again  
  
Just like a fly  
On a jar  
Twinkle twinkle little star  
You dont feel like you belong here  
But its your life  
Even though  
Its not perfect  
Its a life you can live with
