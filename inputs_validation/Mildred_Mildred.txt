Mildred Mildred how I love you so  
Remember the joke you told me  
While we had our midnight tea  
That was the funniest joke I ever heard in my life  
I didnt tell you then cause I was drinking the tea  
  
Alfred now Alfred you used to call me so  
And told me how it would be nice to open a plant shop  
That was the most sensible idea we had in our life  
I didnt tell you then cause I was reading the papers  
  
Mildred oh Mildred how I love you so  
Remember how you were angry when I talked to the box  
You kept trying to tell me something something about your life  
But I didnt hear you then cause I was watching the box  
  
I bought a pot of plant now  
And Im watering it evry day  
I watched the late night talk show  
And asked the man in a suit  
Why he was laughing so when my wife was dead  
  
He didnt reply  
No he didnt reply at all  
And I burnt the box the next morning  
And buried in our garden  
  
Mildred oh Mildred how I miss you so  
How I wish to tell you a lot of things about our life  
But of course you arent around you arent around no more  
And I hear the box still laughing in the next door apartment
