Live every moment  
Love every day  
Cus before you know it  
Your precious time slips away  
Live every moment  
Love every day  
Cause if you dont  
You might just throw your love away  
  
I walked for seven miles this mornin  
Footprints in the sand  
Washed away without a warnin  
When the water hit the land  
But I will walk on until I can no longer stand  
And Ill take you by the hand and well  
  
Live every moment  
Love every day  
Cus before you know it  
Your precious time slips away  
  
Theres water in the wind tonight  
Theres a chill in the air  
Its coolin down my skin tonight  
Soakin through your hair  
Theres warmth enough within tonight for both of us to share  
We can take it anywhere and well  
  
Live every moment  
Love every day  
Cus if you dont  
You might just throw your love away  
  
Sometimes I wish we could take a trip far away  
Leave all this trouble heartache and pain for another day  
I will search for that place  
But till I find it all I can say is  
  
Live every moment  
And love every day  
  
Oooh sometimes I wish we could take a trip far away  
Leave all this trouble heartache and pain for another day  
I will search for that place  
But till I find it all I can say is  
  
Live every moment  
Love every day  
Cus before you know it  
Your precious time slips away  
Live every moment  
Love every day  
Cus if you dont  
You might just throw your love away  
You might just throw your love away  
You might just throw your love away  
Live every moment  
You got to move every moment  
Dont dontthrow your love away
