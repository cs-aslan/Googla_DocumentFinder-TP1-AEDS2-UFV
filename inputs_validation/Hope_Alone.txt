Lets not drag this out  
Everythings in motion  
Though Ive only ever loved you kind  
And with devotion  
I remember when I met you  
And even from the start  
I thought one day youd probably just come home  
And break my heart  
  
Its funny what you know  
And still go on pretending  
With no good evidence  
Youll ever see that happy ending  
  
You  
Looking for your distance  
And sensing my resistance  
You had to do your will  
  
I  
Had to learn the hard way  
We were just an empty dream too big  
For hope alone to fill  
  
I know Im a dreamer  
i know that Im a  
So Ill give you that  
dreamer  
Still I hope Im more than just a place  
still I hope Im more  
You laid your hat  
than a place you laid your hat  
Youre a land of secrets  
you are its only  
Its only citizen  
citizen  
And though I paid my dues  
though I paid  
I was never allowed in  
i was never allowed in  
And so I am a stranger  
so I am a stranger  
Especially today  
especially today  
As I get sad and lonely  
And you get your way  
  
You  
Were looking for your distance  
And sensing my resistance  
You had to do your will  
  
I  
I had to learn the hard way  
That we were just an empty dream too big  
For hope alone to fill  
  
Holding on for change I know  
We never stood a chance  
no we never stood a chance  
So I could only wait  
And watch you slip right through my hands  
watch you slip right through my hands  
  
You  
Were always looking for your distance  
And sensing my resistance  
You had to do your will  
  
I  
I had to learn the hard way  
We were just an empty dream too big  
For hope alone to fill
