Do you ever walk alone  
Like a drifter in the dark  
Seeking out what isnt there  
Looking only for a spark  
  
From a girl whos all alone  
Maybe shes adriftin too  
Like a shadow in the night  
Waitin just to meet with you  
  
And then perhaps in love youll stay  
Or fall and go your separate ways  
Still searchin for a spark  
Like a drifter in the dark  
  
Repeat x8  
Doodn doo doo doodn doo da da da da da  
  
Do you ever walk alone  
Like a drifter in the dark  
Seeking out what isnt there  
Looking only for a spark  
  
Repeat x4  
Like a drifter in the dark
