Close my eyes  
My mind looks for you everywhere  
You and I intertwined  
In everything we share  
  
You watch me  
Undercover dirty lover  
1900anything  
Testing testing 1 2 3 4  
  
Are you still with me now  
Do you still care  
Have I grown complacent just  
Know youll always be there  
Just know youll always be there  
  
Staring out the blinds  
Like Im in a picture frame  
Dancing out of time  
While youre whispering my name  
  
Youve got me in the shutter  
Youve got my number  
See the writing on the wall  
Makes me feel like 1984  
  
Are you still with me now  
Do you still care  
Have I grown complacent just  
Know youll always be there  
Just know youll always be there  
  
Its just that sometimes  
I think I notice  
A certain change going by  
  
And if I  
Before I know it I turn a blind eye  
And I cant see clear anymore  
  
Are you still with me now  
Do you still care  
Have I grown complacent just  
Know youll always be there  
Just know youll always be there  
  
Are you still with me now  
Do you still care  
Have I grown complacent just  
Know youll always be there  
Just know youll always be there
