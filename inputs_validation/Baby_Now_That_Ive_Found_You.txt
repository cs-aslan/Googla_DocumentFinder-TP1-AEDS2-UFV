Baby now that Ive found you

I need you so baby even though  
You dont need me now

I need you so baby even though  
You dont need me  
You dont need me no no mm  
  
Baby baby when first we met  
I knew in this heart of mine  
That you were someone I couldnt forget  
I said right and abide my time  
  
Spent my life looking for that somebody  
To make me feel like you  
Now you tell me that you want to leave me  
But darling I just cant let you
