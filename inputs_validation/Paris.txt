Verse  
You sitting in your office dreaming of a different life  
You say you wanna make me smile and see my wild side  
If we dont leave town now  
Were never gonna get out of here alive  
Im walking home from school my thoughts aredrifting into space  
Why dont we leave tonight and take off to a different place  
Dont tell my daddy why gotta get on that place and just fly  
  
Chorus  
Take me to paris

I wanna be that fantasy that you got on your mind  
Flying across the sea to somewhere that theyll never find  
We should go out while we young  
Cause one day we will wondering why
