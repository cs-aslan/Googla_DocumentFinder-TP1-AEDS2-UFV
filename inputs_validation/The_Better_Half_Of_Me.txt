I took advantage of you a stepping stone to my pedestal  
When you had enough of it  
I said fine good luck replacing this  
Cause I seem strong and independent self sufficient confident  
And Im like mercury rising to the top so selfishly  
  
The better half of me was you  
Im like a hive without a bee without you  
I gotta find ya gotta remind ya  
That two is better than one  
  
So please accept my apology cause Im feeling  
Like a branch without its tree  
It took me a fall to really see  
That your the catch I wanna keep  
  
Cause I get weak thinking about you  
Living without you life has no value  
Baby come back to me  
Cause youre the only missing piece  
  
Cause the better half of me was you  
Im like the hive without its bee without you  
I gotta find ya gotta remind ya  
That two is better than one  
  
Ooh it took a little earthquake  
To appreciate the stability youve given me  
So consistently  
  
The better half of me was you  
Im like a bird without its wings without you  
I gotta find ya gotta remind ya  
That two is stronger than one  
  
The better half of me oh its you  
Im like a heart without its beat without you  
I gotta find ya gotta remind ya  
I promise you that Im gotta try to  
Im gonna love ya cause two is better than one
