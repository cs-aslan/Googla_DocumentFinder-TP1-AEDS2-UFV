Well we come down to the valley  
Yea were looking for the honey  
I see a rainbow  
I say thats the land of milk and honey  
  
Me and my cousin  
Me and my brother  
My little sister too  
Come looking for a rainbow  
Yea were looking for a rainbow  
  
Well we come down to the valley  
Got our babies in our arms  
Yea were Maggies little children  
And were looking for Maggies farm  
  
Me and my cousin  
Me and my brother  
My little sister too  
Come looking for a rainbow  
Yea were looking for a rainbow  
  
Well we come down to the valley  
We aint far away no more  
You cant leave us dying this time  
cause were all around your door  
  
Me and my cousin  
Me and my brother  
My little sister too  
Come looking for a rainbow  
Yea were looking for a rainbow
