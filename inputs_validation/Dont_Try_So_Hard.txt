Another Monday comes and I just wanna breathe  
Cause its a long long week for someone wired to please  
I keep taking my aim pushing it higher  
Wanna shine bright even brighter now  
Wish I would tell myself  
  
Dont try so hard  
God gives you grace and you cant earn it  
Dont think that youre not worth it  
Because you are  
He gave you His love and Hes not leaving  
Gave you His Son so youd believe it  
Youre lovely even with your scars  
Dont try so hard  
  
Do you remember how the summers felt when we were kids  
Oh we didnt think much about it we just lived  
Taking our time beautiful leisure  
When did we start trying to measure up  
And all this time love has been trying to tell us  
  
Dont try so hard  
God gives you grace and you cant earn it  
Dont think that youre not worth it  
Because you are  
He gave you His love and Hes not leaving  
Gave you His Son so youd believe it  
Youre lovely even with your scars  
Dont try so hard  
  
Dont try so hard  
  
Dont try so hard  
God gives you grace  
You cant earn it  
Stop thinking youre not worth it  
Because you are  
He gave you His love and Hes not leaving  
Gave you His Son so youd believe it  
Youre lovely even with your scars  
Lovely the way you are  
So open up your lovely heart  
Dont try so hard
