Winter is here again oh lord  
Havent been home in a year or more  
I hope she holds on a little longer  
Sent a letter on a long summer day  
Made of silver not of clay  
Ive been runnin down this dusty road  
  
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin  
I dont know where Ill be tomorrow  
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin  
  
Ive been trying to make it home  
Got to make it before too long  
I cant take this very much longer  
Im stranded in the sleet and rain  
Dont think Im ever gonna make it home again  
The mornin sun is risin  
Its kissin the day  
  
Oh the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin  
I dont know where Ill be tomorrow  
Ooo the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin
