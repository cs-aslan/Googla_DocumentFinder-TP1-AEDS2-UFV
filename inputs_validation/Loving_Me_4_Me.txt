People ask if Im in love with you  
Because Im sitting here with your picture  
And smiling to myself  
Im kinda lost in my own thoughts of you  
My heart speaks before my mind thinks through  
And I blush as I say yes  
  
What a feeling of vulnerability coming over me  
And Im feeling weak and I cant speak  
Never thought Id give in so willingly to a human being  
With abilities to set me free  
Free make me be me  
Makes me want to say  
  
Your lips your love your smile your kiss

We were meant to be
