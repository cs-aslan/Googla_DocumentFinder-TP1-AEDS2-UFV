Do You Like The Way  
Lauryn Hill  
Versions  
  
Watch the master plan the pastures span  
Through the streets move the sheep  
Flipped the beat like the shepherd  
Its a new day my crew stay forever striving  
Give thanks cause we alive and been through the gutter  
Now we see the horizon  
Its clear to me now  
  
Used to be confused took a lot of years to see how  
Now we moving planets  
Take the average mind and expand it  
You take for granted like were always gonna be disadvantaged  
But soon come it soon come ya soon done  
Ya start run you stumble we catch one  
  
In the rhythm Santana lick the guits with precision  
Not accidental intentional conscious decision  
To Zion were marching through with African Mayans  
Conquering Babylon with the heart of a lion  
And the walls of Jericho come atumbling down  
Tell me how long has it been  
Is everything everything alright my friend  
  
You see time is passing people asking how come none of this aint lasting  
Money will make people deal like they dont even have to feel  
But no it aint real it aint real  
Oh do you like the way that its going down  
Do you like the way that its going down  
Oh do you like the way  
How long how long will we wait to sit down and communicate  
See everything is relative if you want to get then give  
Cant we all just build and livecant we cant we  
  
Do you like the way that its going down  
Do you like the way that its going down  
Do you like the way that its going down  
Do you like the way that its going down
