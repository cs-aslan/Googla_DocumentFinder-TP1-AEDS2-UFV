Yo Im a dedicate this to everybody that was at Woodstock 99  
DMX Limp Bizkit Sheryl Crow amongst many  
Yo just before I got on stage this chick came on to me  
She offered me sumthin  
It looked kinda strange it was in a bag  
I said Yo girl let me talk to you real quick  
Yo  
  
I dont sniff cocaine cause it mess up my brain  
For sexual stimulation I never did no ecstasy  
I dont pop pills I never did no LSD  
but I wouldnt mind a kiss from Ms Mary  
Cause  
  
Shes homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard  
Shes homegrown and you can get a kiss in her backyard  
  
I remember when I was a young boy  
I waited for my grandad So daddy can I get a puff  
He looked at me he says Son man youre too young kid  
When you get older now and you understand that  
I let you get one kiss from Ms Mary  
Cause  
  
Shes homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard  
Shes homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard  
If she allows you to you can roll her up  
Shes homegrown and you can kiss her in her backyard  
Shes homegrown  I like to be with you Ms Mary  in your backyard  
  
Thats when she looked at me and she said  
Wyclef this what I want you to do son  
  
Come on  
Inhale  exhale  
Exhale  inhale  
Inhale  exhale  
Now hold it now

Exhale  inhale  
Now breath in my face
