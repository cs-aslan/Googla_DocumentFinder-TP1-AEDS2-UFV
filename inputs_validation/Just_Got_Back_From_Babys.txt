Now I just got back from babys  
We been rolling all night long  
I said I just got back from babys  
We been rolling all night long  
She come on likes and loves me  
But I feel like something wrong  
  
Now sometimes I go see baby  
And sometimes she come see me  
I said sometimes I go see baby  
And sometimes baby come see me  
I got a funny funny feeling  
Im not the only man she sees  
  
Now I just got back from babys  
Big white house on the hill  
I said I just got back from babys  
Big white house on the hill  
If her loving dont get me  
I know her husband will
