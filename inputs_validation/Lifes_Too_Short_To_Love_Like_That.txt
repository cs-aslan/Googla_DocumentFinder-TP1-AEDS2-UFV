Baby we had something  
Goin wrong  
Ive never seen nothin  
So right go wrong  
You used to want to  
Love me day and night  
We used to never want to  
Leave paradise  
Now we sleep  
At night back to back  
Lifes too short to love like that  
  
You never want to  
Kiss me anymore  
You run around  
And I walk the floor  
You know I used to  
Mean everyting to you  
Not Im last in line  
And that just wont do  
I feel blue you feel trapped  
Lifes too short to love like that  
  
You put me down  
Just to stand me up  
Time after time  
Well enoughs enough  
I give and give  
Without gettin back  
Lifes too short to love like that  
Lifes too short to love like that  
  
Its way too late  
For a wakeup call  
And I aint gonna wait  
For those tears to fall  
I used to think  
We could work things out  
But if you dont want to change  
Then theres no doubt  
The fire is out  
And thats so sad  
Lifes too short to love like that  
  
You put me down  
Just to stand me up  
Time after time  
Well enoughs enough  
I give and give  
Without gettin back  
Lifes too short to love like that  
Lifes too short to love like that
