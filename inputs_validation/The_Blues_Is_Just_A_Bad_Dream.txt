A tree grows in my back yard it only grows at night  
Its branches theyre all twisted its leaves are afraid of light  
They say the blues is just a bad dream they say it lives upside your head  
But when its lonely in the morning youre bound to wish that you was lying
dead  
  
Theres winds out on the ocean theyre blowing just as they choose  
But then winds aint got no emotion baby they dont know the blues  
They say the blues is just a bad dream they say it lives upside your head
mmmm  
But when its lone lonely in the morning youre bound to wish that you was
lying dead  
  
My mind is rambling and rambling just like some rolling stone no  
Since that nightmares come to stay with me baby my thoughts just dont
belong  
They say the blues is just a bad dream they say it lives upside your head  
But when they visit you around midnight youre bound to wish that you were
lying dead
