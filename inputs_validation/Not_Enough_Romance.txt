Shouldve never made eye contact  
Shouldve been a heart of stone  
When you stopped me to say hello  
Wouldve been twice as easy  
To just say no  
Cause I dont want to lose at love again  
But as a couple we were quite handsome  
And the moon was out that night  
So we let our hearts go dancing  
If that thing is missing in my life  
  
Theres not enough romance in this world  
Theres not enough romance in this world  
Theres too many people thinking only of themselves  
You gotta give love for its return  
  
Want to sing about new lovers  
Stand up against the odds  
Nothing can change a thing that strong  
And myself I know my emotions  
I got my love to share  
And when you need something so tender  
What youre looking for is so rare  
  
Theres not enough romance in this world  
Theres not enough romance in this world  
You gotta believe in what your heart tells you is right  
And Im here to say that I believe in love  
  
We take a lot of chances playing some foolish games  
But thats the only price that you gotta pay  
We gotta keep believing hungry hearts run free  
Everybody needs a good loving  
Its anything you want it to be
