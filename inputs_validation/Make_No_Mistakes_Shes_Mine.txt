Dont call her up anymore  
Cos I dont wanna hear your voice  
I dont wanna see your face answer her door  
Make no mistake shes mine shes mine  
  
She only knows how I feel  
I only know what shes like when she needs me  
Oh how she needs me deep in the night  
Make no mistake shes mine no shes mine  
  
Dont get too close when you dance  
Cos I dont wanna heart from my friends  
You were out of the town  
With her in your arms  
  
Dont include her in your dreams  
Cos I dont wanna close my eyes  
No I dont wanna know where she goes  
Each night when she leaves  
Make no mistake shes mine no shes mine   
  
Dont call her up anymore
