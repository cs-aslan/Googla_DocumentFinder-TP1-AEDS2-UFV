Stuff your pockets stuff your mouth  
Much more than feeding  
Your bloated God your bank account  
Your empathys fleeting  
Now that you own the cure you bought the truth still you want more  
Down on youre knees you bleed it out  
This type of believing  
  
Hold on wait we have had all we can take  
You can keep the money  
Cause all we need is ElOhVeeEe love  
ElOhVeeEe love  
ElOhVeeEe ElOhVeeEe love  
  
You pushed the point to no return  
Take more and repeat it  
Stockpiled possessions watch them burn  
Weve got all we needed  
Before you got to far  
We realized  
Just who you are  
Down on your knees you bleed it out  
This type of believing  
  
Hold on wait we have had all we can take  
You can keep the money  
Cause all we need is ElOhVeeEe love  
ElOhVeeEe love  
ElOhVeeEe ElOhVeeEe love  
  
Youve got your mansion  
Youve got your minions  
Protected privilege  
But weve got love  
Youve got your black gold  
Youve got your pipeline  
Capitalism  
But weve got love  
  
Youve got reserve banks with no reserves  
Youve got religion  
Control the herds  
Youve got your slave trade of prostitution  
Youve got your green God  
But we got love  
  
Yes we got love  
Yes we got love  
Yes we got love  
Yes we got love  
  
Hold on wait we have had all we can take  
You can keep the money  
Cause all we need is ElOhVeeEe love  
ElOhVeeEe love  
ElOhVeeEe ElOhVeeEe love  
  
Yes we got love  
Yes we got love  
Yes we got love  
Yes we got love  
Yes we got love  
Love love love love
