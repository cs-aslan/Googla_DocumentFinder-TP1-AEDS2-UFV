Downtown  
My darling dime store thief  
In the War of Independence  
Rock n Roll rang sweet as victory  
Under neon signs  
A girl was in bloom  
And a woman was fading  
In a suburban room  
I said Take me to the dance  
Do you want to dance  
I love to dance  
And I told him They dont take chances  
They seem so removed from romance  
Theyve been broken in churches and schools  
And molded to middle class circumstance  
And we were rolling rolling rock n rolling  
  
Downtown  
The dance halls and cafes  
Feel so wild you could break somebodys heart  
Just doing the latest dance craze  
Gail and Louise  
In those pushup brassieres  
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings  
Drinking up the bands beers  
Young love was kissing under bridges  
Kissing in cars kissing in cafes  
And we were walking down Main Street  
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays  
In France they kiss on Main Street  
Amour mama not cheap display  
And we were rolling rolling rock n rolling  
  
Downtown  
In the pinball arcade  
With his head full of pool hall pitches  
And songs from the hit parade  
Hed be singing Bye Bye Love  
While hes racking up his free play  
Let those rock n roll choir boys  
Come and carry us away  
Sometimes Chickie had the car  
Or Ron had a car  
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hotwire head  
Wed all go looking for a party  
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead  
And Id be kissing in the back seat  
Thrilling to the Brandolike things that he said  
And wed be rolling rolling rock n rolling
