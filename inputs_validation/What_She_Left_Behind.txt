She took the TV and the toaster  
She took the curtains and the car  
I guess she took for granted  
I wouldnt take it very hard  
And for someone in a hurry  
She took her own sweet time  
But its not what she took that hurt  
Its what she left behind  
  
A bedroom full of memories that time cannot erase  
Photographs of the two of us that she said throw away  
She took my heart and soul and left me here to lose my mind  
No its not what she took that hurt  
Its what she left behind  
  
She said Ive given you my best but I cant take no more  
She said Ive run out of reasons then she walked out the door  
Its gonna take a lot of doin to get over her goodbye  
Cause its not what she took that hurt  
Its what she left behind  
  
A bedroom full of memories that time cannot erase  
Photographs of the two of us that she said throw away  
She took my heart and soul and left me here to lose my mind  
No its not what she took that hurt  
Its what she left behind
