I left home with a friend of mine  
Gone two years and I dont know why  
Now Im happy all the time  
I cant think and Im feelin fine  
I got feelings but they dont show  
Dont ask me cause I dont know  
No no no no no  
All of you  
Think youve heard this all before  
Now yourre gonna hear some more  
I know a place where dreams are crushed  
Hopes are smashed but that aint much  
All you stupids anyway  
Were all gonna die some day  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
All of us  
Me leave home with booji boy  
Teeth fall out of china doll  
Poo poo man got jiffysnipped  
Bad girl launching  floppy tits  
Listen listen me no lie  
We like stuff what makes us cry  
Why why why why  
All of us
