We can share the women  
We can share the wine  
We can share what we got of yours  
Cause we done shared all of mine  
  
Keep a rolling  
Just a mile to go  
Keep on rolling my old buddy  
Youre moving much too slow  
  
I just jumped the watchman  
Right outside the fence  
Took his ring four bucks in change  
Now aint that heaven sent  
  
Hurts my ears to listen Shannon  
Burns my eyes to see  
Cut down a man in cold blood Shannon  
Might as well be me  
  
We used to play for silver  
Now we play for life  
Ones for sport and ones for blood  
At the point of a knife  
Now the die is shaken  
Now the die must fall  
There aint a winner in this game  
Who dont go home with all  
Not with all  
  
Leaving Texas  
Fourth day of July  
Sun so hot clouds so low  
The eagles filled the sky  
  
Catch the Detroit Lightning  
Out of Santa Fe  
Great Northern out of Cheyenne  
From sea to shining sea  
  
Gotta get to Tulsa  
First train we can ride  
Got to settle one old score  
And one small point of pride  
  
Aint no place a man can hide Shannon  
Keep him from the sun  
Aint no bed will give us rest man  
You keep us on the run  
  
Jack Straw from Wichita  
Cut his buddy down  
Dug for him a shallow grave  
And laid his body down  
  
Half a mile from Tucson  
By the morning light  
One man gone and another to go  
My old buddy youre moving much too slow  
  
We can share the women  
We can share the wine
