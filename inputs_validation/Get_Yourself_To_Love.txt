Isnt it time all of loves bad debts got paid  
Dont be afraid  
Isnt it true  
If you dont trust in yourself  
Youll trust noone else  
All your favorite memories  
Are not your worst enemies  
Come on give em a ride  
You gotta decide to push them aside  
Give it a try  
  
You gotta get yourself to love  
Shes not the only one  
You you gotta get yourself to love  
Why be the lonely one  
Get yourself to love  
  
Take away the things you need to start again  
Your heart will never mend  
Take away oh the chance you have to slip and fall  
You will miss it all  
  
Drop your onepart harmonies  
For the harder melodies  
Youre so aware  
Of the crosses you bear  
Dont be so scared  
Show that you care  
  
Oh you oh you gotta get yourself to love  
Shes not the only one  
Oh you yes you you gotta get yourself to love  
Why be the lonely one  
  
Oh you yeah you gotta get yourself to love  
Yes love you gotta love sometime  
You oh you  
Why be the sad and lonely one  
You know  
You can do it yes you can do it you can do it for yourself  
Yes you can oh dont bend  
You can do it you can do it you can do it  
You can do it for yourself
