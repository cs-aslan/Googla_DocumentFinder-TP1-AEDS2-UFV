Im a fool to want you  
Im a fool to want you  
To want a love that cant be true  
A love thats there for others too  
  
Im a fool to hold you  
Such a fool to hold you  
To seek a kiss not mine alone  
To share a kiss the devil has known  
  
Time and time again I said Id leave you  
Time and time again I went away  
Then would come the time when I would need you  
And once again these words Id have to say  
  
Im a fool to want you  
Pity me I need you  
I know its wrong  
It must be wrong  
  
But right or wrong  
I cant get along  
Without you  
  
Time and time again I said Id leave you  
Time and time again I went away  
Then would come the time when I would need you  
And once again these words Id have to say  
  
Im a fool to want you  
Pity me I need you  
I know its wrong  
It must be wrong  
  
But right or wrong  
I cant get along  
Without you
