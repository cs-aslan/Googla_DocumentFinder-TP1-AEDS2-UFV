I lie here tonight in the darkness  
Ive never felt so alone  
tomorrow Ill wake up still lonesome  
Cause things havent changed since youve gone  
  
You walked out with angry words spoken  
Youre leavin cut right to the bone  
Ill pick up the pieces you have broken  
Find the strength to go on  
  
I still remember  
How my love once held her  
How long do old memories last  
Why cant I forget it  
Why cant I admit it  
There aint no future in the past  
  
I still remember  
How my love once held her  
How long do old memories last  
Why cant I forget it  
Why cant I admit it  
There aint no future in the past
