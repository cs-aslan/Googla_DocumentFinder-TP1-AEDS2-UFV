Baby got into her car  
Drove all the way to New York City  
Um Hummmm  
She played her guitar there  
They made her a star in New York City  
Um Hummmm  
She went to Paris France  
Thats where she got the chance  
To be a movie star  
I got a post card from Rome  
Then she was headin home  
To America  
A superstar  
Shed come so far  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Well it wasnt very long  
Till she was back out on  
That old freeway  
Um Hummmm  
She drove across the mountains  
The prairies the deserts  
Of the USA  
Um Hummmm  
Hollywood gave her a call  
She went and lived it all  
On the silver screen  
Sometimes she laughed and she cried  
She kept it all inside  
For the magazines  
The silver screen  
The Hollywood dream  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
She lives in an ivory tower  
A tower built by fame  
Um Hummmm  
Shes got the wealth and power  
But she hasnt got a man  
Um Hummmm  
No matter how hard she tried  
She was so empty inside  
So lonely  
She hung her head and she cried  
Was it the love she denied  
Never satisfied  
Deep inside  
She said goodbye  
She paid the price for her fame  
Everyone knows her name  
America  
A superstar  
Shed come so far  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o
