Tiger eyes  
Just as wild as you make me feel  
Tantalize  
Make my designs hard to conceal  
Trying hard to hold on to you  
Waterfall in my hand youre slippin through  
Tried so hard it makes me scream  
Cant you see that youre drivin me crazy  
I dont know what to do  
All you do is youre drivin me crazy  
It makes me feel so good so good so good  
Will you stay and give me time to work it out  
Day by day  
Lose my mind without a doubt  
Dont want to hang you up this way  
Just wanna lay you down and play  
Im gonna go out of my mind  
Cant you see that youre drivin me crazy  
I dont know what to do  
All you do is youre drivin me crazy  
It makes me feel so good so good so good  
Cant you see that youre drivin me crazy youre drivin me crazy  
I dont know what to do  
All you do is youre drivin me crazy youre drivin me crazy  
It makes me feel so good  
Cant you see that youre drivin me crazy youre drivin me crazy  
I dont know what to do  
All you do is youre drivin me crazy youre drivin me crazy  
It makes me feel so good  
Cant you see that youre drivin me crazy youre drivin me crazy  
I dont know what to do
