The moment that we met  
There was something so familiar  
I felt like Id known you for a thousand years  
And there inside your eyes  
I saw a light that Id been missing  
  
Somewhere deep inside  
All of the lonely disappeared  
And baby now youre here  
I feel like I have found  
  
Chorus  
A long lost friend  
That Ive lived for all my life  
A gentle hand  
A part of me Ive been trying to find  
And now youre here  
And the search comes to an end  
Ive found my long lost friend  
  
Every move I make  
Is to the rhythm of your heartbeat  
Every single breath you take  
You take with me  
  
Oh I ask myself  
How did I ever live before you  
You came into my life  
And put all the pieces into place  
When I saw your face  
I knew that I had found  
  
Chorus  
  
Like a storm out of the blue  
Love rained down on me and you  
So complete and so unexpectedly  
Like a movie in my mind  
Ive seen a hundred times  
I feel like Ive loved you before  
Long lost friend  
  
Now youre here  
And the search comes to an end  
  
Long lost friend  
That Ive lived for all my life  
A gentle hand  
Youre a part of me I was dying to find  
And now youre here  
And the search comes to an end  
Ive found my long lost friend  
Ive found my long lost friend  
  
Oh now Ive found you  
My lost friend oh
