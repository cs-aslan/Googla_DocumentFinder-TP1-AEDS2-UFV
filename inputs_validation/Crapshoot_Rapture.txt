Consider me an object  
Free of all infliction  
Free of all conditions  
Free of ambitions  
Ive been sittin upside down  
And then I will swing  
For all eternity  
Never forward  
Yes I know it  
Oh feeling like  
Its something I never thought youd be a part of  
Bring me to a doctor  
Maybe an asylum  
Calling on decisions  
Breathing amunition  
Feeling righteous  
Yeah thats not forward  
Feeling like theres something I never thought youd be part of  
Coming forward  
Yeah forwards backwards  
Coming close yeah  
Hang on  
Sail on  
Im feeling forward  
But backing off  
Falling down  
Yeah Ive been sitting upside down  
And then I will slip  
For all eternity
