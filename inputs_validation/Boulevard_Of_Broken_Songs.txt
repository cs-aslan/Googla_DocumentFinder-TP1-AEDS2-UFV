I walk a lonely road  
The only one that I have ever known  
Dont know where it goes  
But its home to me and I walk alone  
  
Today is gonna be the day  
That theyre gonna throw it back to you  
  
I walk this empty street  
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams  
Where the city sleeps  
And Im the only one and I walk alone  
  
By now you shouldve somehow  
Realized what you gotta do I walk alone I walk alone  
I dont believe that anybody  
Feels the way I do I walk alone I walk alone about you now  
  
My shadows the only one that walks beside me  
My shallow hearts the only thing thats beating  
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me  
Til then I walk alone  
  
Ahah Ahah Ahah Aaahah  
Ahah Ahah Ahah in the background all the way to Im walking down the
line  
  
Every day I wake up and its Sunday  
Whatevers in my head wont go away  
The radio is playing all the usual  
And whats a wonderwall anyway  
  
Backbeat the word was on the street  
That the fire in your heart is out  
Im sure youve heard it all before  
But you never really had a doubt  
I dont believe that anybody feels  
The way I do about you now  
  
Im walking down the line  
That divides me somewhere in my mind  
On the border line  
Of the edge and where I walk alone  
Today is gonna be the day  
That theyre gonna throw it back to you  
  
Read between the lines  
Whats fucked up and everythings alright  
Check my vital signs  
To know Im still alive and I walk alone  
  
Today is gonna be the day  
That theyre gonna throw it back to you I walk alone I walk alone  
By now you shouldve somehow  
Realized what you gotta do I walk alone I walk alone  
  
And all the roads we have to walk along are winding  
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding  
There are many things that I would  
Like to say to you  
I dont know how  
  
I walk this empty street  
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams  
  
Today is gonna be the day  
That theyre gonna throw it back to you  
  
I walk this empty street  
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams  
  
By now you shouldve somehow  
Realized what you gotta do  
  
Where the city sleeps  
And Im the only one and I walk a  
  
Cuz maybe  
  
My shadows the only one that walks beside me Saves me  
My shallow hearts the only thing thats beating Saves me  
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me Saves me  
Til then I walk alone  
  
Sing with me Sing  
Sing for the year Sing It  
Sing for the laughter sing for the tear Cmon  
Sing it with me Just for today  
Maybe tomorrow  
The good Lord will take you away
