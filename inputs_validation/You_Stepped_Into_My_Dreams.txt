Thats it baby take one last look  
We gotta go catch a plane  
Then you wont die and I wont die  
But we wont ever be the same  
Oh I can feel a mood coming down on me  
Such a good thing disappears  
I can sense the loss creeping up on us  
And its deeper than any tears Ive known  
You stepped into my dreams  
You opened up the door  
You stepped into my dreams  
I want you back for more  
You stepped into my dreams tonight  
In the shadows of the night youre sorry  
In the morning we was gone  
Wont you blow a kiss to me baby  
We both gotta be moving on  
Sometimes you see a lover and shes made for love  
But you let that lover slip by  
You believe and yet shes so hard to get  
And you never know the reasons why  
She stepped into your dreams  
She opened up your door  
She stepped into your dreams  
You want her so much more  
She stepped into your dreams tonight yeah  
Oh when youre doing what youre doing  
What do you think of me babe  
There aint much else to say  
In another time in another place  
Things might have turned out okay  
I can feel a darkness I can never conceal  
Sometimes I get just a little insane  
I can feel emotions like the mighty oceans  
Theyre driving me again and I know  
You stepped into my dreams  
You opened up the door  
You stepped into my dreams  
I want you back for more  
You stepped into my dreams  
And I dont know what to do  
Im so scared of losing you
