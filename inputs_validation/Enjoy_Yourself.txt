Enjoy it enjoy it  
  
Never let life  
Get you down  
When your head is spinning  
Feet wont touch the ground  
For in this world  
The good time you cant plan  
Youd better take your chances while you can  
  
Chorus  
Dont wait til tomorrow  
When you should be living today  
Enjoy it enjoy it  
Before too long its too late  
Dont throw the good times away  
Enjoy it enjoy it repeat  
  
Dont break up  
Inside  
When everythings too much  
Dont run and hide  
For nothing comes to those who will not try  
You may just as well have kissed  
Your dreams goodbye  
  
Chorus  
  
For nothing comes to those who hesitate  
Grab your dreams before it gets too late  
  
Chorus until fade
