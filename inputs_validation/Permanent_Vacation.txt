I got a letter from a friend the other morning  
He say its hot down by Montego Bay  
I got the point and now I think its finally dawning  
Yeah yeah I got to get away  
I got to take myself a Permanent Vacation  
The skys the limit but my plane wont fly  
My nose is clean and Lordie dont need no sedation  
Yeah yeah and thats the reason why  
I really need it really really need St Tropez  
I want a tan where the sun it never shines  
I really need it really really need St Tropez  
You best believe it that I got to get away  
I got a sister man she really got a pin head  
She think she kinky but she cant get straight  
She say she livin but I kinda think shes brain dead  
Just excess baggage on a late night freight  
I really need it really really need St Tropez  
I want a tan where the sun it never shines  
I really need it really really need St Tropez  
You best believe it that I got to get away  
I gotta take me on a Permanent Vacation  
The girls be cummin down in Cayman Brack  
I gotta hand it to a firm situation  
Yeah yeah got to cut me some slack  
I really need it really really need St Tropez  
I want a tan where the sun it never shines  
I really need it really really need St Tropez  
I really need it really need it really really
