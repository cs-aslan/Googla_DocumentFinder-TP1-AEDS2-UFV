No matter how hard I try  
You keep pushing me aside  
And I cant break through  
Theres no talking to you  
Its so sad that youre leaving  
It takes time to believe it  
But after all is said and done  
Youre gonna be the lonely one  
  
Do you believe in life after love  
I can feel something inside me say  
I really dont think youre strong enough  
Do you believe in life after love  
I can feel something inside me say  
I really dont think youre strong enough  
  
What am I supposed to do  
Sit around and wait for you  
Well I cant do that  
And theres no turning back  
I need time to move on  
I need a love to feel strong  
Cause Ive got time to think it through  
And maybe Im too good for you  
  
Do you believe in life after love  
I can feel something inside me say  
I really dont think youre strong enough  
Do you believe in life after love  
I can feel something inside me say  
I really dont think youre strong enough  
  
Well I know that Ill get through this  
Cause I know that I am strong  
I dont need you anymore  
I dont need you anymore  
I dont need you anymore  
No I dont need you anymore  
  
Do you believe in life after love  
I can feel something inside me say  
I really dont think youre strong enough  
Do you believe in life after love  
I can feel something inside me say  
I really dont think youre strong enough  
Do you believe in life after love  
I can feel something inside me say  
I really dont think youre strong enough  
Do you believe in life after love  
I can feel something inside me say  
I really dont think youre strong enough
