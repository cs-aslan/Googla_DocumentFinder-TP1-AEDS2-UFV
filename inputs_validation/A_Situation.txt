A Situation  
  
Well I live here with you  
In in a kind of yes will do  
Oh what part of now dont you understand  
Im showing you well apparent  
Yeah I get the bluff if Ill get out  
No room for three you me and your doubts  
One of us has got to leave  
And it sure will be me  
  
And I think we could have a situation  
We could have a situation  
  
Any reason we cant just settle around now  
Yeah ok and how  
Rather than shout and praise  
Adjust with them not without friends  
Oh what part of our old tune dont you understand  
I think I made it clear that youre in the mend  
In the mend  
  
Oh we could have a situation  
Oh we could have a situation
