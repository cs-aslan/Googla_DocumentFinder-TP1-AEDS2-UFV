Ive known you for quite awhile  
Never ashamed to tell you whats on my mind  
Whether its wrong or right  
When I feel like salting the ocean  
Youre fresh water for my eyes  
  
You give me this  
You give me that  
And this kiss is getting wild  
And just maybe just maybe  
  
When I get to my room  
Im still drowning from your stare  
How could I now sleep  
When love is in my hair  
  
Set aside some time to be with you tomorrow  
Set aside some time to repeat what happened tonight  
  
Whenever I carry jars of regret  
I stumble over and over again  
The slip breaks me  
And that kills your heart  
When you feel like falling apart  
Id come running to catch you  
  
You give me this  
You give me that  
And this kiss is getting wild  
And just maybe just maybe  
  
When I get to my room  
Im still drowning from your stare  
How could I now sleep  
When love is in my hair  
  
Set aside some time to be with you tomorrow  
Set aside some time to repeat what happened tonight  
  
Oh you give me so much hope  
All the stars have agreed  
Let my dreams somersault  
Paint your rainbows here
