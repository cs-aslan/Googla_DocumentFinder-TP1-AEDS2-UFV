hook  
If I dont nothin Im a ball  
Im countin all day like a clock on the wall  
Now go and get your money little duffle bag boy  
Said go and get your money little duffle bag boy get money  
And I aint ever ran from a nigga and I  
Damn sho aint bout to pick today to start runnin  
Look honey I aint never ran from a nigga and I  
Damn sho aint bout to pick today to start runnin get money  
  
The beat so hot the flow is so ice cold  
Walkin to the Gucci store honey Im home  
I am on my shit I need a pamper on me  
Toilet paper on the side for example homie  
I get money  
I know you niggas aint heard no shit like this and  
While you wishing on that fallin star Im in a foreign car  
Smoking out with the doors ajar  
Suede sun roof hangin out the big top  
We leave the dealership head to the rim shop  
You niggas barely dressin I got thousands piling  
Thats that salad dressin Im on my thousand island  
Wildin stylin I be I get so much money its my id  
Dont try me and if I dont do nuthin Im a fuckin ball  
And I aint bout to start runnin naw nigga naw  
  
Chorus  
  
Aint nothin to a boss we ballin when you see us  
We hear them haters callin they too far off to see us  
Unless they got they glasses on get your bifocal game  
Class is now in session now try to stay focus mane  
Your boy aint good enough style aint hood enough  
Wouldve couldve shouldve wont do with us true enough  
Need a hoe break a hoe never nuthin new to us  
Turnin hoes to house wives never been cool with us  
Soon enough all these dealers are gonna catch up  
Till then fuck it Im winnin so Im a stack up  
Flows like a river the current is so rapid  
Hit with the ratchet thats how shit happens  
Next time youre yappin make sure it be about that big money talk  
Let that lil money walk call me what you want but dont call me for front  
Southside I got what you want come holla at me  
  
Chorus x2
