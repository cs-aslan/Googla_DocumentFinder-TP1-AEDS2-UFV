I dont want to  
Go on without you  
Its so bad to be alone  
Oh baby come home  
I need you  
My room is so blue  
I keep seein your face  
Oh every place  
Here in the gloom  
Of my lonely room  
I hold her memories  
And smell her sweet perfume  
I cant stand to  
Live on without you  
Oh my darlin hear my plea  
Cmon back to me  
Here in the gloom  
Of my lonely room  
I hold her memories  
And smell her sweet perfume  
I cant stand to  
Live on without you  
Oh my darlin hear my plea  
Cmon back to me  
I cant stand to  
Go on without you  
Oh my darlin hear my plea  
Go on without you  
Cant stand to no no no no  
Go on without you  
Oh my darlin hear my plea  
Go on without you  
I cant stand to
