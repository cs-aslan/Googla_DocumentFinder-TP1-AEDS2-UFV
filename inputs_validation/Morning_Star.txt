As I wake I see a morning star  
Through the window dimly shines  
Its final statement at the closing of the day  
Ive got a few more minutes of night time before I rise  
  
As the dawn is breaking through the darkness  
The morning star will fade but never die  
Morning star I cant see your face no more and thats good  
Get out now out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood  
  
As I laid down last night I felt no pain  
The day went on without a sound  
Another night to put all the business away  
I had a few more hours of night time before Id rise  
All the stars were out last night in the sky  
I slept right through as they all went by  
  
Soon the dawn was breaking up the darkness  
The morning star will fade but never die  
Morning star I cant see your face no more and thats good  
Get out now out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood  
  
You come along with a color that I cant match  
Gold chain and a crystal ball attached  
Youre coming from the wrong direction  
  
And as I sleep tonight Ill dream of you  
Sleeping somewhere far away  
You come into my head so pretty and so true  
I get a few more hours to dream of you till I rise  
As the fireworks shoot off in the sky  
I sleep right through as it all goes by  
  
Soon the darkness would suck up into the dawn  
The morning star will fade but never die  
Morning star I cant see your face no more and thats good  
Get out now out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood  
  
You come along with a code that I cant crack  
Gold chain and a crystal ball attached  
You were coming from the wrong direction  
  
You were coming from the wrong direction  
You were coming from the wrong direction
