Picked up my baby before the sun set   
Shes always ready to step inside  
I cant wait though to get started  
And her love is so bona fide  
Im in the mood for it Im in the mood for it  
Your love your love  
Yeah my serenity her intentions   
And we were rolling on down that road  
She was tuned to to perfection   
I was heading for that overload  
Im in the mood for it Im in the mood for it  
Your love your love  
It makes my engine overheat  
Puts me back into the seat  
Its just the nature just the nature  
That makes my engine overheat  
Twin barrels burning just like a rocket   
She took me faster than Ive ever been  
There was nothing I could do and I didnt ask for something  
Like sitting on a guillotine you know just what I mean  
Im in the mood for it right in the mood for it  
Your love your love your love your love  
It makes my engine overheat   
Puts me back into the seat  
Its just the nature its just the nature of the beast  
Just the nature just the nature  
Makes my engine overheat
