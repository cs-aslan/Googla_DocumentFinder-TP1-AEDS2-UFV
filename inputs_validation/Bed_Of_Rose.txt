Youre that one special woman  
I thought Id never find  
With the strength to be gentle  
And the courage to be kind  
  
Though it hasnt all been roses  
Still I know you understand  
One of these nights  
When were sharing a dream  
  
Im gonna take you by the hand  
And lay you down on a bed of roses  
In that peaceful shelter  
Only love can provide  
Ill lay you down on a bed of roses  
And then Ill lay me down  
Right by your side  
  
Theres no diamond on your finger  
Just a simple wedding band  
Since your knight in shining armor  
Is just an ordinary man  
  
Though I promised you a kingdom  
And we dont have all we planned  
One of these nights  
When were making believe  
  
Im gonna take you by the hand
