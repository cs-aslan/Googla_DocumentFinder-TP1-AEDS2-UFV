Theres ice and snow on the northern roads  
And the Jersey Pike is closed  
Have to go and do some drivin tonight  
They say Id be a fool if I would ride those icy roads  
But a little storm aint stoppin me tonight  
  
Im gonna wear out the turnpike  
Rack up those miles  
Keep this rig a rollin Im in it every mile  
Cause shes in Oklahoma and  
Im up in Maine  
So diesel sing a song that will bring me home again  
Doodle doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doodle doo doo doo  
  
Theres a red light turnin behind me  
Theres a trooper on my tail  
I can tell I wont get to New York town on time  
If he decides to pull me over  
And if he gets me on the scale  
Im gonna have to tell a tale or take a fine  
  
Im gonna wear out the turnpike  
Rack up those miles  
Keep this rig a rollin Im in it every mile  
Cause shes in Oklahoma and  
Im up in Maine  
So diesel sing a song that will bring me home again  
Doodle doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doodle doo doo doo  
  
With the snow against my windshield  
I will run on through the night  
Theres not stoppin me once I hit the road  
Cause the turnpikes like my second home  
And I know it like my hand  
So diesel sing a song thatll bring me home again  
  
Im gonna wear out the turnpike  
Rack up those miles  
Keep this rig a rollin Im in it every mile  
Cause shes in Oklahoma and  
Im up in Maine  
So diesel sing a song that will bring me home again  
Doodle doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doodle doo doo doo
