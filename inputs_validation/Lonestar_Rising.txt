Bahum bahum bahum bahum bahum  
Sun is shining so why am I feeling the cold  
Bahum bahum  
Not surprising something has fallen from the fold  
  
Bahum bahum bahum  
Lonestar rising God only knows where Ill go  
Bahum bahum  
Ohh what timing and how blue is the tone  
  
Bahum bahum  
  
Seems like I was always drunk  
I lost myself in someones song  
And when all is said and done  
I only wanna feel the sun  
  
Bahum  
  
Every others passed to remind of the time  
All the lovers living in limbo divine  
Bahum bahumbahum  
Every reason has every reason to go  
  
Bahum bahum  
All the seasons melt into one like the snow  
Bahum bahum  
  
Seems like I was always drunk  
I lost myself in someones song  
And when all is said and done  
I only wanna feel the sun  
  
Bahum  
No sensation not even tears rolling down  
Bahum  
Conversation echoes like ghosts on the town  
  
Bahum bahum  
Lonestar rising God only knows where Ill go  
Bahum  
Ohh what timing and how blue is the tone  
  
Bahum bahum  
  
Seems like I was always drunk  
I lost myself in someones song  
And when all is said and done  
I only wanna feel the sun  
  
Bahum
