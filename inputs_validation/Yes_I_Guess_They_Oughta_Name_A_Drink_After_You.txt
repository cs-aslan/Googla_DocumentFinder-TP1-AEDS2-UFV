Oh I get drunk most every night seems like all we do is fight  
The more I drink the less I feel blue  
Sometimes I feel like an awful fool  
Spendin my life on an old bar stool  
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you  
Incomprehensible  
If this date were to be our last Id never sit down this glass  
Itd take all the booze in the world to forget you  
Youve left my heart a vacant lot Ill fill it with another shot  
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you  
Incomprehensible  
Looks like I had my fill guess I better pay my bill  
When I started out I only meant to have a few  
Someone just said that you left town I better get a double round  
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you  
Yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you
