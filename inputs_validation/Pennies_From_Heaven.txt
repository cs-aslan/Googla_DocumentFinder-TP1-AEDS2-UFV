Every time it rains it rains pennies from heaven  
Dontcha know each cloud contains pennies from heaven  
Youll find your fortune fallin all over town  
Be sure that your umbrella  
Is upside down  
  
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers  
If you want the things you love you must have showers  
So when you hear it thunder Dont run under a tree  
Therell be pennies from heaven for you and me
