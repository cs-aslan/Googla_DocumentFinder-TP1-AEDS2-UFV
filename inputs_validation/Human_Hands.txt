Ive been talking to the wall and its been answering me  
Oh darling how I miss you  
Im just the mere shadow of my former selfishness  
I crave the silhouette of your kiss  
With only the blue light of the tv on  
Lip reading threats and false alarms  
Theres a boy somewhere holding hands with himself  
And a girl in a window on the Reeperbarn  
  
Chorus  
Whenever I put my foot in my mouth and you begin to doubt  
That its you that Im dreaming about  
Do I have to draw you a diagram  
All I ever want is just to fall into your human hands  
  
With the kings and queens of the dance hall craze  
Checkmate in three moves in your heyday  
But the girls dont listen to your line anymore  
Now youre part of someone else  
  
On the factory floor and you still say Wheres the action  
Now you manufacture happiness  
And get sold on the cheap for someones satisfaction  
  
Chorus  
  
All you toy soldiers and scaremongers  
Are you living in this world sometimes I wonder  
In between saying youve seen too much and saying youve seen it all before  
  
Tighter and tighter I hold you tightly  
You know I love you more than slightly  
Although Ive never said it like this before  
  
Chorus
