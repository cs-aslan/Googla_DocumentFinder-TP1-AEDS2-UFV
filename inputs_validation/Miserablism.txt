It seems to me theres something serious beginning  
A new approach found to the meaning of life  
Deny that happiness is open as an option  
And disappointment disappears over night  
  
Say that love is an impossible dream  
Face the facts thats what its always been  
Relax what you see is what youve seen  
What you get is a new philosophy  
  
Thats what you got thats what you get  
Thats what you got thats what you get  
  
Miserablism is is and isnt isnt  
Miserablism is is and isnt isnt  
  
Meanwhile your life is still directed as a drama  
With realism on the sparsest of sets  
Every performance tends to reach the same conclusion  
No happy endings but a message to depress  
Saying life is an impossible scheme  
Thats the point of this philosophy  
  
Miserablism is is and isnt isnt  
Miserablism is is and isnt isnt  
  
But if is wasnt and isnt were  
You cant be sure but you might find ecstasy  
  
Oh no  
  
Just for the sake of it make sure youre always frowning  
Get get get  
It shows the world that youve got substance and depth  
You know life is an impossible scheme  
And love an imperceptible dream  
  
Thats what you got thats what you get  
Thats what you got thats what you get  
  
Miserablism is is and isnt isnt  
Miserablism is is and isnt isnt  
Miserablism is is and isnt isnt  
Miserablism is is and isnt isnt  
Miserablism is is and isnt isnt  
Miserablism is is and isnt isnt  
Miserable
