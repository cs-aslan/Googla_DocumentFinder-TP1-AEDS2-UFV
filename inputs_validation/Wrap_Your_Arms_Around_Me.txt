Wrap your arms around me  
When youre so far away  
At the end of each day  
Counting the moments  
Till you fade away  
Inside my soul  
Under passions control  
Are feelings I cant find  
The words to explain  
Just like the first time  
Im helpless again  
Chorus  
Wrap your arms around me  
Let your love surround me  
Make love to me now like never before  
Wrap your arms around me  
From the day you found me  
Youll never be alone  
  
The nights are so cold  
With just your memory to hold  
Ive tried to be strong  
Reaching out holding on  
Alone in my bed  
I cling to each word you said  
Wanting you more everyday were apart  
And each precious moment  
Is safe in my heart  
  
Chorus  
  
Take me in your arms  
Hold me  
You are the one  
Only you I want to be with you  
We belong together  
We were so close  
The nights are so cold  
Want to be with you  
Miss you anyway  
I want to be with you  
Hold me love me love me  
Just like the first time  
Im helpless again  
  
Chorus  
  
Wrap your arms around me  
And youll never be alone  
Wrap your arms around me  
Youll never be alone  
No youll never be alone
