I only wanted to have fun  
Learning to fly learning to run  
I let my heart decide the way  
When I was young  
  
Deep down I must have always known  
That this would be inevitable  
To earn my stripes Id have to pay  
And bare my soul  
  
I know Im not the only one  
Who regrets the things theyve done  
Sometimes I just feel its only me  
Who cant stand in reflection that they see  
I wish I could live a little more  
Look up to the sky not just the floor  
I feel like my life is flashing by  
And all I can do is watch and cry  
  
I miss the air  
I miss my friends  
I miss my mother  
I miss it when  
  
Life was a party to be thrown  
But that was a million years ago  
  
When I walk around all of the streets  
Where I grew up and found my feet  
They cant look me in the eye  
Its like they scared of me  
  
I tried to think of things to say  
Like a joke or a memory  
But they dont recognize me now  
In the light of day  
  
I know Im not the only one  
Who regrets the things theyve done  
Sometimes I just feel its only me  
Who never became who they thought theyd be  
I wish I could live a little more  
Look up to the sky not just the floor  
I feel like my life is flashing by  
And all I can do is watch and cry  
  
I miss the air  
I miss my friends  
I miss my mother  
I miss it when  
  
Life was a party to be thrown  
But that was a million years ago  
  
A Million Years Ago
