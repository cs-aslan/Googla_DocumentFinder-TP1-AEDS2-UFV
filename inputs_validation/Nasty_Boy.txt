Representin on the freaky freaky  
Fuck em all day fuck em all night  
We dont love these hoes

Dont take them to the crib unless they bonin  
Easy call em on the phone and  
Platinum Chanel cologne and  
I stay dressed to impress  
Spark these bitches interest  
Sex is all I expect  
If they watch TV in the Lex they know  
They know quarter past fo  
Left the club tipsy say no mo  
Except how Im gettin home tomorrow  
Caesar drop you off when he see his PO uh  
Back of my mind I hope she swallow uhhuh  
Man She split a drink on my cream Wallows  
Reach the gate hungry just ate  
Riffin she got to be to work by eight  
This must mean she aint tryin to wait  
Conversate sex on the first date I state  
You know what you do to me  
She starts off well I dont usually  
Then I whipped it out rubber no doubt  
Step out show me what you all about  
Fingers in your mouth open up your blouse  
Pull your Gstring down South aow  
Threw that back out in the parking lot  
By a Cherokee and a green droptop  
And I dont stop until I squirt  
Jeans skirt buttnaked it all work  
  
Chorus  
  
I remember we went to Tennessee  
Then we came home mad messages was on my phone  
Bitch named Symone  
Screamin she feenin for the semen  
Me bein the man that I am  
Took it to her condo pronto  
Half Indian I called her Tonto  
Roll the chronchron in the dark pronto  
Few puffs eyes got low  
And off to the bedroom we go mm  
Sex is drama head to trauma  
Rip pajamas Ima stay til tomorrow  
Satisfyin all my needs twice  
With the whipped cream handcuffs and ice  
The bitch is nice word is bond  
Cant wait to put my niggas on what what  
  
Chorus  
  
Ladies my Mercedes  
Hold fo in the back two if your fat  
Keep a gat cause cats try to test me  
They just fans like DeNiro Wesley  
Lets see the bitch Im waitin on  
Cartier jeans look like they painted on  
Ask thee leave it up to me  
Lay her on back ever so gently  
She like the way the dough fold up Rolls roll up  
Cristal just throw up bitch grow up  
Hold up theres DeGenero  
Dripped out iceberg apparel  
Intro goes without speaking  
Call me Cease cause I keep em we can go freakin  
All weekend so roll in  
Aint it good that my Lex keeps foldin Uhh  
  
Chorus
