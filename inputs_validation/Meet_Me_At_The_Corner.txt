Please dont ask me who who you think I am  
I could live without that Im just a modest man  
Meet me at the corner and oh tell me what to do  
Cause I messed up on you and had I known all that I do now  
Im guessing were through now  
Proceeding into the forest I will lay around and wait  
And Ill wait for you  
  
Please dont ask me where where you think Ive been  
Ive been a lot of places but this could be my win  
Meet me at the corner where Ill tell me what to do  
Cause I messed up on you and had I known all that I do now  
Im guessing were through now  
Proceeding into the forest I will lay around and wait  
And Ill wait for you  
  
I feel so bad I thought youd wanna know  
I feel so bad I thought youd wanna know  
Something I wanna show I thought youd wanna know  
  
Please dont say you want to keep in touch  
I bare to see you on the corner that I just cant bare  
Meet me at the corner and oh tell me what to do  
Cause I messed up on you and had I known all that I do now  
Im guessing were through now  
Proceeding into the forest I will lay around and wait  
  
And I turn I turn my head when I thought I saw a sign from the Gods  
A sign from the gods that you were meant to be mine  
And its fine taking it all for a ride til the day when its gone  
I mystified my way and it all went wrong when its gone  
I live and I learn and I lose and I win but its better whenever  
Whenever Im here thank you girl for everywhere that weve been
