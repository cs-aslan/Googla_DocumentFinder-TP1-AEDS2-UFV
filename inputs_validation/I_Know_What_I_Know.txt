She looked me over  
And I guess she thought  
I was all right  
All right in a sort of a limited way  
For an offnight  
She said dont I know you  
From the cinematographers party  
I said who am I  
To blow against the wind  
I know what I know  
Ill sing what I said  
We come and we go  
Thats a thing that I keep  
In the back of my head  
  
She said theres something about you  
That really reminds me of money  
She is the kind of a girl  
Who could say things that  
Werent that funny  
I said what does that mean  
I really remind you of money  
She said who am I  
To blow against the wind  
  
I know what I know  
Ill sing what I said  
We come and we go  
Thats a thing that I keep  
In the back of my head  
  
She moved so easily  
All I could think of was sunlight  
I said arent you the women  
Who was recently given a Fulbright  
She said dont I know you  
From the cinematographers party  
I said who am I  
To blow against the wind  
  
I know what I know  
Ill sing what I said  
We come and we go  
Thats a thing that I keep  
In the back of my head
