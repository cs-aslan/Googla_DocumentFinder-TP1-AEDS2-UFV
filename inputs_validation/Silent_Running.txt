God only knows this isnt heaven  
The promises made we never keep them  
  
Chorus  
Were walking on air were taking our time  
But God only knows this isnt reason or rhyme  
  
Ive had this feeling I dont believe in  
Its happened before I just reject it  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
These are the feelings I know their outcome  
Its useless pretending Id like to beat them  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Were walking on air were taking our time this time  
But God only knows this isnt reason or rhyme  
  
Were walking on air
