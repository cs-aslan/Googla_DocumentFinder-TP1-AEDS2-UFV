I am a man who looks after the pigs  
Usually I get along okay  
I am man who reveals all he digs  
Should be more careful what I say  
  
Im getting put down  
Im getting pushed round  
Im being beaten every day  
My lifes fading  
But things are changing  
Im not gonna sit and weep again  
  
I am man who drives a local bus  
I take miners to work but the pits all closed today  
Its easy to see that you are one of us  
Aint it funny how we all seem to look the same  
  
Were getting put down  
My karma tells me  
Youve been screwed again  
If you let them do it to you  
Youve got yourself to blame  
Its you who feels the pain  
Its you that feels ashamed  
  
I am a young man  
I aint done very much  
You men should remember how you used to fight  
Just like a child Ive been seeing only dreams  
Im all mixed up but I know whats right  
  
Im getting put down
