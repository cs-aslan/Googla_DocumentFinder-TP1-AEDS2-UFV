It was back in 07 did a couple of tapes  
Did a couple DVDs made a couple mistakes  
Didnt know what I was doing but I put on a cape  
Now its which World Tour should I go on and take  
See you told me I would lose but I won  
I might cop a million Jimmy Choos just for fun  
Cause bitches couldnt take what was in me  
Australia Sydney  
Might run up in Disney out in LA with Lindsey  
Got the eye of the tiger the lion of Judah  
Now its me in my time its just me in my prime  
Everything I tried to teach em they gone see it in time  
Tell them bitches get a stick Im done leadin the blind  
Got two shows tonight thats Brooklyn and Dallas  
Then a private party at the Buckingham palace  
Which means I gotta fly like a movie no commercial  
Thats Young Money Cash Money yeah Im Universal  
  
Chorus  
I hear they comin for me  
Because the top is lonely  
What the fuck they gon say  
What the fuck they gon say  
Im the best bitch doin it doin it  
Im the best bitch doin it doin it  
Im the best best best best  
Im the best best best best  
Im the best  
  
I remember when I couldnt buy my mother a couch  
Now Im sittin at the closin bought my mother a house  
You could never understand why I grind like I do  
Mikiyah and Gulani while I grind like I do  
Cccause even when my daddy was on crack I was cracked  
Now the whole album crack you aint gotta skip a track  
I aint gotta get a plaque I aint gotta get awards  
I just walk up out the door all the girls will applaud  
All the girls will commend as long as they understand  
That Im fighting for the girls that never thought they could win  
Cause before they could begin you told em it was the end  
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in  
Got two bones to pick Ima only choose one  
You might get addressed on the second album  
Which means you can breath tell that motherfucker say so  
To all my bad bitches I can see your halo  
  
Chorus  
  
Ah its OK  
Its OK long as you know  
Long as you know  
Long as you motherfuckers know  
Im the best best best best  
  
Chorus
