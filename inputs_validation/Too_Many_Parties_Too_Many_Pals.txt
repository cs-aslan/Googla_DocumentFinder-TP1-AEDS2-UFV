Too many parties and too many pals will break your heart someday  
Too many boyfriends and sociable gals may drive your sweetheart away  
Gentlemen of the jury the judges speech began  
  
The scene was a crowded courtroom and the judge a stern old man  
This prisoner here before you is a social enemy  
A lady of the evening and you know the penalty  
  
Her eyes reflect the nightlife her cheeks theyre red with paint  
But I knew her mother gentlemen why her mother was a saint  
Now I know that shes not like her and yet she might have been  
If it hadnt been for pettin parties cigarettes and gin  
  
We took the night life off the streets and brought it in our own homes  
While girls beguiled with lipstick danced to saxophones  
We opened up the underworld to the ones we loved so well  
So tell me gentlemen is it right to send her to a cell  
  
If she drinks while you taught her and if she smokes you showed her how  
So gentlemen do you think its right to condemn her now  
And when youre in that jury room just remember there and then  
That for every fallen woman theres a hundred fallen men  
And before you render a verdict on what this girl has done  
  
Just remember theres a man to blame and that man might be your son  
Now gentlemen thats my story my testimony stands  
This girl is my own daughter and the case is in your hands  
Those Broadway roses and prevalent sounds at too many parties and too many
pals
