Gold lions gonna tell me where the light is  
Gold lions gonna tell me where the light is  
Take our hands out of control  
Take our hands out of control  
  
Now tell me what you saw  
Tell me what you saw  
There was a crowd of seeds  
Inside outside  
I must have done a dozen each  
  
It was the height I threw the weight  
The shell was crushing you  
Ive been around a few  
  
Tell me what you saw  
Ill tell you what to  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ohh ohh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ohh ohh  
  
Gold lions gonna tell me where the light is  
Gold lions gonna tell me where the light is  
Take our hands out of control  
Take our hands out of control  
  
Outside inside  
This is the moon without a tide  
Well build a fire in your eyes  
Well build a fire when the covers getting brighter  
Cold as I makes the moon without a tide  
  
Tell me what you saw  
Ill tell you what to  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ohh ohh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ohh ohh  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ohh ohh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ohh ohh
