Every lie will win a prize  
Love sold by a whore  
Calculated sacrifice  
Death without a war  
Aftermath and alibis  
Strawdollchess to please the poor  
  
Dont tell me of any wonders shitting gold  
Dont tell me of a hard way we have to go through  
Still we pay your warmth out of the cold  
Do you really think were that blind  
Dont spit on my mind  
Dont spit on my mind  
Dont spit on my mind  
  
Any form of government  
Has a black sheep part  
But the brave will never know  
What the black sheeps start  
In the name of countrylove  
they enrich themselves apart  
  
Dont tell me of any wonders shitting gold  
Dont tell me of a hard way we have to go through  
Still we pay your warmth out of the cold  
Do you really think were that blind  
Dont spit on my mind  
Dont spit on my mind  
Dont spit on my mind  
  
We are the people we are the masses you are for  
We give the power and our desire must be your law  
Dont think Im standing here all alone one of a kind  
Dont think because youre still there  
Means that we are all blind  
Dont spit on my mind  
Dont spit on my mind  
Dont spit on my mind
