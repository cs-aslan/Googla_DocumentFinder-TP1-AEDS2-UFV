This is the thirteenth day of waiting the second long weekend  
These liberties youve taken have got to end  
This distance youve been keeping grows wider everyday  
Time is running out theres nothing left to say  
  
Innocent child thats what I once believed  
But now I know better and I aint gonna let you play that game with me  
Im telling you mama  
Im gonna get lowdown and dirty run wild in the night  
Lowdown and dirty this time Ill do it right  
Loving every minute making up for lost time  
Ill get lowdown lowdown and dirty  
  
A little time to do something some searching of the soul  
I never knew your heart could be so cold  
Youre driven by ambition and you want the best that you can get  
Ambition leads you blindly if you let it  
And I guess you let it  
  
That innocent smile it fooled me all the way  
It drew me in but now theres gonna be some hell to pay  
Gonna be hell to pay  
  
Im gonna get lowdown and dirty and break every rule  
Lowdown and dirty nobody gonna treat me like a fool  
Running free and easy now Im out on the loose  
Ill get lowdown and dirty lowdown and dirty tonight  
  
Such an innocent child you fooled me all the way  
You drew me in but now there is going to be some hell to pay  
  
Im gonna get lowdown and dirty run wild in the night  
Lowdown and dirty do it good do it right  
You see Ive reaching for something thats been  
Missing in my life  
Ive got to get lowdown and dirty lowdown and dirty tonight  
Got to get got to get got to get lowdown and dirty  
If you could see me right now darlin youd see me flyin high  
Goin crazy
