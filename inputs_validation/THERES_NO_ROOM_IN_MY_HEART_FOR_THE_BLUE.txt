Key C  
CTheres no room in my C7heart for the Fblues  
Love is G7satisfied to either win or Close  
Darlin if our pathways part C7let there Fbe no broken hearts  
Theres no G7room in my heart for the Cblues  
Theres no room in my life for a sigh  
Well be strong enough to face our last goodbye  
Darlin if our romance ends let us part the best of friends  
Theres no room in my heart for the blues  
Theres no room in my memory for tears  
Well let bygones be forgotten souvenirs  
If your hungry heart forgets let there be no sad regrets  
Theres no room in my heart for the blues  
Theres no room in my life for a sigh  
Well be strong enough to face our last goodbye  
Darlin if our romance ends let us be the best of friends  
Theres no room in my heart for the blues
