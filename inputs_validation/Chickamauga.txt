Youd never leave on your own  
Where youre from and where youre going  
I know these things like I know you hate me now  
Catch yourself in midair thinking  
  
Your dreams can never be bought  
I couldnt help you then and I guess I cant help you now  
When jousting is for pleasure  
Pleasure is way out of hand  
  
The time is right for getting out while we still can  
Chickamaugas where Ive been  
Solitude is where Im bound  
I dont ever want to taste these tears again  
  
I dont ever want to taste these tears again  
Appalachian so patient  
The lessons weve traveled  
As soon as were out were kicking our way back in  
  
Fighting fire with unlit matches  
From our respective trenches  
No authority can clean up this mess were in  
A miracle might point the way  
  
To solutions were after  
And avert our chronic impending disaster  
Chickamaugas where Ive been  
Solitude is where Im bound  
  
I dont ever want to taste these tears again
