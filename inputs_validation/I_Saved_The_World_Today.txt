Monday finds you like a bomb  
Thats been left ticking there too long  
Youre bleeding  
Some days theres nothing left to learn  
From the point of no return  
Youre leaving  
  
Hey Hey I saved the world today  
Everybodys happy now  
The bad things gone away  
And everybodys happy now  
The good things here to stay  
Please let it stay  
  
Theres a million mouths to feed  
And Ive got everything I need  
Im breathing  
And theres a hurting thing inside  
But Ive got everything to hide  
Im grieving  
  
Hey Hey I saved the world today  
Everybodys happy now  
The bad things gone away  
And everybodys happy now  
The good things here to stay  
Please let it stay  
  
Let it stay  
Let it stay  
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo the good thing  
  
Hey Hey I saved the world today  
Everybodys happy now  
The bad things gone away  
And everybodys happy now  
The good things here to stay  
Please let it stay  
  
Hey Hey I saved the world today Everybodys happy now  
Everybodys happy now  
The bad things gone away Everybodys happy now  
And everybodys happy now  
The good things here to stay  
Please let it oh let it
