This isnt really death this isnt really life  
This isnt really anything I think I like  
  
And I will not sit up dont be playing  
Not for you or anyone  
I will not change my fucking hair  
  
We have no reasons but we still have fun  
Then I blow up and you whispered my name  
  
Wait until I rip your back to shreds  
I wave my blue suede shoes  
Thats all that remains of your spine  
  
I want excitement  
Your spinal remains  
I want to stand here  
In your spinal remains  
In chains  
  
This isnt really death this isnt really life  
This isnt really anything I think I like  
  
And I will not grin or piss on the flag  
Not for you or anyone  
I will not plug a fucking ass  
  
I want to stand in  
Baby your spinal remains  
I wont save it  
Baby your spinal remains  
Theyre making me sick
