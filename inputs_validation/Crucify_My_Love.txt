Crucify my love  
  
Chorus  
If my love is blind  
Crucify my love  
If it sets me free  
Never know never trust  
That love should see a color  
Crucify my love  
If it should be that way  
  
Bridge  
Swing the heartache  
Feel it inside out  
When the wind cries  
Ill say goodbye  
Tried to learn tried to find  
To reach out for eternity  
Wheres the answer  
Is this forever  
  
Like a river flowing to the sea  
Youll be miles away and I will know  
I know I can deal with the pain  
No reason to cry  
  
Crucify my love  
Chorus  
  
Till the loneliness shadows the sky  
Ill be sailing down and I will know  
I know I can clear clouds away  
Oh is it a crime to love  
  
Bridge  
Chorus
