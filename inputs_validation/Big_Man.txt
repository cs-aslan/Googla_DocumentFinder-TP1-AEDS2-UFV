I know where Im heading for  
I know what I wanna be  
When they asked me at school what I wanted to be  
That was all they got from me  
  
I wanna be a big man nobody putting me down  
I wanna be a big man  
  
They say love is all you need  
But everyone needs to know  
If you look a bit tough when you talk about love  
Im sure that love would grow  
  
I wanna be a big man nobody putting me down  
I wanna be a big man yeah yeah  
  
Look around see if Im wrong  
Its only a show for those who dont belong  
  
I wanna be a big man yeah yeah  
I wanna be a big man yeah yeah  
  
I know what Im living for  
But there aint no guarantee  
If I make a wrong move you could jump in my shoes  
And that aint no good to me  
  
I wanna be a big man yeah yeah  
I wanna be a big man yeah yeah
