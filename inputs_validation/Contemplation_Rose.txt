Puerto Rican nursery rhymes  
Angels in the snow and thyme  
And Im keeping my mind on that rose  
In a church in Spanish Harlem  
  
Got watchtowers and awakes for free  
In the laundromat for you and me  
But you cant take me down that way  
As Im not sinking  
  
And if we go down one time  
Next times not gonna be the last time  
And Im contemplating that rose  
In a church in Spanish Harlem  
Didnt I bring you precious gifts  
Came to kiss you on the lips  
Didnt even appear  
To beg your pardon  
  
To lay out in the morning sun  
Feel the cool breeze and the one  
Right there in in my garden  
Puerto Rican nursery rhymes  
And angels and angels and the snow and thyme  
But Im keeping my mind on that rose  
In a church in Spanish Harlem  
  
Yeah and if we go if we go down one time  
The next time will not be the last time and Im  
Keeping my mind on that contemplating that rose  
Up in a church in Spanish Harlem  
  
And if we go down one time you know  
The next time it wont be the last time  
And Im contemplating that rose  
In a church in Spanish Harlem  
  
And Im contemplating that rose  
In a church in Spanish Harlem  
And Im contemplating and Im contemplating that rose  
In a church in Spanish Harlem  
And Im contemplating that rose  
In a church in Spanish Harlem  
And Im contemplating that rose  
In a church in a church in Spanish Harlem
