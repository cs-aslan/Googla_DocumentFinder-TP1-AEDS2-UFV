You ask me how much I need you  
Must I explain  
I need you oh my darling  
Like roses need rain  
  
You ask how long Ill love you  
Ill tell you true  
Until the Twelfth of Never  
Ill still be loving you  
  
Chorus  
Hold me close  
Never let me go  
Hold me close  
Melt my heart like April snow  
  
Ill love you til the bluebells  
Forget to bloom  
Ill love you til the clover  
Has lost its perfume  
  
And Ill love you til the poets  
Run out of rhyme  
Until the Twelfth of Never  
And thats a long long time  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill love you til the bluebells  
Forget to bloom  
Ill love you til the clover  
Has lost its perfume  
  
And Ill love you til the poets  
Run out of rhyme  
Until the Twelfth of Never  
And thats a long long time  
  
Until the Twelfth of Never  
And thats a long long time  
A long long time
