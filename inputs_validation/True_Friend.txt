We sign our cards  
And letters BFF  
Youve got  
A million way  
To make me laugh  
Youre looking out  
For me  
Youve got my back  
Its So good  
To have you around  
You know the secrets  
I could never tell  
And when Im quiet you  
Break through my shell  
Dont feel the need  
To do a rebel yell  
Cuz you keep my feet  
On the ground  
  
Youre a true friend  
Youre here till the end  
You pull me aside  
When somethin aint right  
Talk with me now  
And into the night  
Till its alright again  
Youre a true friend  
  
You dont get angry  
When I change the plans  
Somehow youre never out  
Of second chances  
You Wont say I told you  
When Im wrong again  
Im so lucky  
That I found  
  
A true friend  
Youre here till the end  
You pull me aside  
When somethin aint right  
Talk with me now  
And into the night  
Till its alright again  
  
True friends will go  
To the ends of the earth  
Till they find  
The things you need  
Friends hang on  
To the ups and the downs  
Cuz they got someone  
To believe in  
  
A true friend  
Youre here til the end  
You pull me aside  
When somethin aint right  
Talk with me now  
And into the night  
No need to pretend  
Youre a true friend  
Youre here til the end  
You pull me aside  
When somethin aint right  
Talk with me now  
And into the night  
Til its alright again  
  
Youre a true friend  
Youre a true friend  
Youre a true friend
