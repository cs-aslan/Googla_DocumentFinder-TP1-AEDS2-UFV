Got a girl her names Francine  
Finest thing you ever seen  
And I love her shes all that I want  
And I need her shes all that I need  
  
Well Francine oh Francis why  
Do you love me and make me cry  
How I love her shes all that I want  
How I need her shes all that I need  
  
If I ever caught her with Stevie P  
Id throw her back in the Penitentiary now  
And if I caught her with my mothers son  
Ill call her daddy and get my gun  
  
My Francine just turned thirteen  
Shes my angelic teenage queen  
And I love her shes all that I want  
And I need her shes all that I need  
And I love her shes all that I want  
And I need her shes all that I need  
And I love her shes all that I want  
And I need her shes all that I need
