Im gonna bet you that heartaches  
And true love and feeble excuses  
For repressed desire adds fuel to the fire  
And the human condition goes on and goes on and goes on  
  
Chorus  
Everybody needs it  
Everybody needs  
Everybody needs it  
Everybody needs  
  
And I get so blue when Im stuck all day in school  
And I get so blue when Im stuck all day in school  
And I stare at the back of my old notebook  
And the teacher gives me a dirty look  
And Ive got just one thing on my mind  
No matter how hard I try and try  
I feel like someone else  
I feel like someone else  
  
Everybody needs  
  
Big boy real cool you can tell hes no ones fool  
And he tries so hard to come off like a star  
You can tell by the way he combs his hair  
By the cocky grin and that moody stare  
By the way he leans and juts out his hip  
And you think any second that he might slip  
But he feels like someone else  
And he feels like someone else  
I know whats on his mind  
I know whats on his mind  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
And Im gonna bet you that I know whats on your mind  
Pretty baby Im gonan bet you that I know whats on your mind  
  
Young girl so wild she wears a ponytail  
And she cooks inside with a passion she cant hide  
And shes got that juju in her eyes  
Makes boys and old men come alive  
And she knows the power that she possesses  
When they start to melt under her caresses  
She feels like someone else  
She feels like someone else  
I know whats on her mind  
I know whats on her mind  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
True love and virtue get put in a closet  
Like Jeckyll and Hyde when it starts you cant stop it  
No need to feel guilty cause youre not alone  
When the fire consumes you and nature takes over  
The heartache and true love and feeble excuses  
For repressed desires add fuel to the fire  
When the fire consumes you and nature takes over  
And the human condition goes on and goes on and goes on  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Everybody needs
