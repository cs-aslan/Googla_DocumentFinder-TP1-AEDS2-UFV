He wants to dream like a young man  
With the wisdom of an old man  
He wants his home and security  
He wants to live like a sailor at sea  
Beautiful loser where you gonna fall  
You realize you just dont need it all  
  
Hes your oldest and your best friend  
If you need him hell be there again  
Hes always willing to be second best  
A perfect lodger a perfect guest  
Beautiful loser read it on the wall  
And realize you just dont need it all  
Hey  you just dont need it all  
You can try but you cant have it all oh no no  
Oh oh cant have it all  
  
Hell never make any enemies  
He wont complain if hes caught in a freeze  
Hell always ask hell always say please  
Beautiful loser never take it all  
Cause its easier and faster when you fall  
You just dont need it all  
Oh oh you just dont need it all
