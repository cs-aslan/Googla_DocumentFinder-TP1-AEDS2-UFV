Hear that old train whistle  
Howling in the night  
If that flyers southbound  
Things will be all right  
  
Im leaving now leaving now leaving now  
Im gonna get back home somehow  
  
Dont nobody tell me  
Babys been untrue  
If shes been unfaithful  
I dont know what Ill do  
  
Im leaving now leaving now leaving now  
Im gonna get back home somehow  
  
Never thought that I could miss her so  
I never thought I could but now I know  
The sound of the old train whistle  
Makes me want to cry  
Reminds me of that lonely feeling  
When I said goodbye  
  
Im leaving now leaving now leaving now  
Im gonna get back home somehow  
  
Never thought that I could miss her so  
I never thought I could but now I know  
The sound of the old train whistle  
Makes me want to cry  
Reminds me of that lonely feeling  
When I said goodbye  
  
Im leaving now leaving now leaving now  
Im gonna get back home somehow
