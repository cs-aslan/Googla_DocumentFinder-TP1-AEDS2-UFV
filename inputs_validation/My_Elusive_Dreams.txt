You followed me to Texas you followed me to Utah  
We didnt find it there so we moved on  
Then you went with me to Alabam  
Things looked good in Birmingham  
We didnt find it there so we moved on  
I know youre tired of following  
My elusive dreams and schemes  
For theyre only fleeting things  
My elusive dreams  
  
You had my child in Memphis then I heard of work in Nashville  
But we didnt find it there so we moved on  
To a small farm in Nebraska to a gold mine in Alaska  
We didnt find it there so we moved on  
I know youre tired of followin  
My elusive dreams and schemes  
For theyre only fleeting things  
My elusive dreams  
  
Now weve left Alaska because there was no gold mine  
But this time only two of us moved on  
And now all we have is each other and a little memory  
To cling to and still you wont let me go on alone  
I know youre tired of following  
My elusive dreams and schemes  
For theyre only fleeting things  
My elusive dreams
