My girl everybody says shes alright  
And I know that shes more than alright  
Well shes a hard headed woman  
Got a mean attitude  
I may have bitten off more than I can chew  
I get a little light headed  
At her altitude  
But she goes one step higher  
  
If Im going to spend the rest of my life  
With a woman like that I better think twice  
  
Shes too tough  
I said shes too tough  
From the moment she wakes up  
Her mind is made up  
Shes too tough shes too tough  
  
My girl shes got a way about her  
I know I can never live without her  
Shes a hard headed woman  
So hard to please  
Shes got her own way of dealing with me  
Im out on a limb Im a cat up a tree  
But this trees on fire  
  
I want that woman for the rest of my life  
I dont know if Im up to payin the price  
  
Shes too tough  
I said that shes too tough  
From the moment she wakes up  
Her mind is made up  
Shes too tough  
  
You hear shes too tough  
Well I dont believe  
Ill ever leave her  
Shes too tough shes too tough  
  
Well if Im gonna spend the rest of my life  
With a woman like her Id better think twice  
  
Shes too tough  
I said shes too tough  
From the moment she wakes up  
Her mind is made up  
Shes too tough thats right  
  
Shes too tough  
If I do what Im told  
Shes gooder than gold to me  
Shes too tough  
  
I said shes too tough  
When push comes to shove  
This must be love  
Shes too tough  
  
Yeah shes too tough  
Well I dont believe  
Id ever leave her never leave her  
Shes too tough shes too tough
