You are the sunshine baby whenever you smile  
But I call you Stormy today  
All of a sudden that ol rain is fallin down  
And my world is cloudy and gray  
Youve gone away  
  
Old Stormy Stormy  
Old Stormy Stormy  
Old Stormy Stormy  
Old Stormy Stormy  
  
Yesterdays love was alive the warm summer breeze  
But like the weather you changed  
Now things are dreary baby windy and cold  
And I stand alone in the rain  
Callin out your name  
  
Stormy Stormy  
Stormy Stormy  
Come back to me Stormy  
Stormy Stormy  
  
Bring back that sunny day  
  
Yesterdays love was alive the warm summer breeze  
But like the weather you changed  
Now things are dreary baby windy and cold  
And I stand alone in the rain  
Callin out your name  
  
Whoa Stormy  
  
Stormy come back to me Stormy  
Stormy come back to me Stormy  
  
Come on home Stormy  
  
Bring back that sunny day
