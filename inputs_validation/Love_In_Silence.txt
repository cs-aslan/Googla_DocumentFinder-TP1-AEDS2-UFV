know yourself  
This is our world our future  
These are our times  
I believe we have to see  
In silence theres no mystery  
The world is so busy talking  
What do they know  
Theyre missing out on being alive  
Words are turning into lies  
Were looking for love to guide us  
What do we know  
The truth is never to be told  
Its waiting there inside your soul  
The innocent join  
In fighting so easily  
In a world of pain and war  
Who knows what theyre fighting for  
What theyre fighting for  
Oh what theyre fighting for  
What theyre fighting for  
Many rivers running out to sea  
One heart with a cry for love  
Many dreamers in a moonlit sky  
One sigh and they are gone  
Love is the only direction  
That leads to truth  
Knowing in your heart whats right  
Youll walk upon the sea of light  
Theres something  
In love and silence  
That you can find  
Know yourself and all around  
Listen to the only sound
