Too proud to admit that love is gone  
Too proud to admit the falling from Eden  
Too proud to admit and much too strong  
The landing was rough  
And the seat belt unfastened  
  
Now its gone away  
And you gotta let go  
Now its gone away  
Theres nothing to fear  
Now its gone away  
And you gotta let go  
Its gone away  
  
Concentrate concentrate  
Reinstate your former state of mind  
Concentrate concentrate  
Reinvent yourself with space and time  
  
Your name is kin to the winds sister  
Youre kin to the winds sister  
But youve an alabaster frame  
  
And youre too proud to admit that love is gone  
Too proud to admit the falling from Eden  
Too proud to admit and much too strong  
The landing was rough  
And the seat belt unfastened  
  
Now its gone away  
And you gotta let go  
Now its gone away  
Theres nothing to fear  
Now its gone away  
And you gotta let go  
Its gone away  
  
Concentrate concentrate  
Reinstate your former state of mind  
Concentrate concentrate  
Reinvent yourself with space and time  
  
Your name is kin to the stars sister  
Youre kin to the stars sister  
But now your perfect bodys maimed  
  
Still youre to proud to admit that love is gone  
Too proud to admit the falling from Eden  
Too proud to admit and much too strong  
The landing was rough  
And the seat belt unfastened  
  
Now its gone away  
And you gotta let go  
Now its gone away  
Theres nothing to fear  
Now its gone away  
And you gotta let go  
Its gone away  
  
Concentrate
