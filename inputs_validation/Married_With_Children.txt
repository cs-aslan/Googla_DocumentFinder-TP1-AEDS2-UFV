Theres no need for you to say youre sorry  
Goodbye Im going home  
I dont care no more so dont you worry  
Goodbye Im going home  
  
I hate the way that even though you  
Know youre wrong you say youre right  
I hate the books you read and all your friends  
Your musics shite it keeps me up all night  
  
Theres no need for you to say youre sorry  
Goodbye Im going home  
I dont care no more so dont you worry  
Goodbye Im going home  
  
I hate the way that you are so sarcastic  
And youre not very bright  
You think that everything youve dones fantastic  
Your musics shite it keeps me up all night  
  
And it will be nice to be alone  
For a week or two  
But I know that I will be  
Right back here with you  
  
Theres no need for you to say youre sorry  
Goodbye Im going home  
I dont care no more so dont you worry  
Goodbye Im going home  
  
I hate the way that even though you  
Know youre wrong you say youre right  
I hate the books you read and all your friends  
Your musics shitty it keeps me up all night
