Look me in the eye  
Then tell me that Im satisfied  
Was you satisfied  
Look me in the eye  
Then tell me that Im satisfied  
Hey are you satisfied  
And it goes so slowly on  
Everything Ive ever wanted  
Tell me whats wrong  
Look me in the eye  
And tell me that Im satisfied  
Were you satisfied  
Look me in the eye  
Then tell me Im satisfied  
And now are you satisfied  
Everything goes  
Well anything goes all of the time  
Everything you dream of  
Is right in front of you  
And every dream is a lie  
Look me in the eye  
And tell me that Im satisfed  
Look me in the eye  
Unsatisfied  
Im so Im so unsatisfied  
Im so dissatisfied  
Im so Im so unsatisfied  
Im so unsatisfied  
Well Ima

Im so dissatis dissattis
