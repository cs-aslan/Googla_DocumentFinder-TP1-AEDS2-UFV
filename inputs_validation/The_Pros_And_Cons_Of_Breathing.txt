Bury me standing under your window with the cinder block in hand  
Yeah cause no one will ever feel like this again  
And if I could move Im sure it would only be to crawl back to you  
I must have dragged my guts a blockthey were gone by the time we talked  
  
I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself  
But you know that I could crush you with my voice  
  
Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me  
Hide the details I dont want to know a thing  
  
I hate the way you say my name like its something secret  
My pen is the barrel of the gun Remind me which side you should be on  
  
I wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel
