Sue wants a barbecue  
Sam wants to boil ham  
Grace votes for bouillabaisse stew  
Jake wants a wienie bake steak and a layer cake  
Hell get a tummy ache too  
  
Well rent a tent or tepee  
Let the town crier cry  
And if its RSVP  
This is what Ill reply  
  
In the cool cool cool of the evening  
Tell em Ill be there  
In the cool cool cool of the evening  
You better save a chair  
When the partys getting a glow on  
Singing fills the air  
In the shank of the night when the doings are right  
You can tell em Ill be there  
  
We said the bumblebee lets have a jubilee  
When said the prairie hen soon  
Sure said the dinosaur  
Where said the grizzly bear  
Under the light of the moon  
How bout your brother jackass  
Everyone gave a cry  
You coming to the fracas  
Over his expected sighs  
  
In the cool cool cool of the evening  
Tell em Ill be there  
In the cool cool cool of the evening  
Slickum on my hair  
When the partys getting a glow on  
Singing fills the air  
If I aint in the clink  
And theres something to drink  
You can tell em Ill be there  
If I can find the right sock by eleven oclock  
You can tell em Ill be there  
If you need a new face or a tenor off base  
You can tell em Ill be there  
If I can climb out of bed put a hat on my head  
You can tell em Ill be there
