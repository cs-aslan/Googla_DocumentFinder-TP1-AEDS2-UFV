I cant believe what you did to me  
Down on my knees and I need to break free  
All these years you violated me  
violated me  
I dont know why I cant feel inside  
I try to hide cant make it alright its overkill  
Now Im ready to fight  
ready to fight  
I dont need nobody tryin to make me over  
I just want to live simple and free  
  
I just want to get away  
Savin all your bullshit for another day  
  
Feeling confined like Im bin force fed  
My visions blurry and Im lost in regrets  
Its overloaded and Im outta control  
outta control  
So sick and tired of bein so misused  
so misused  
Youre taking me down with all your mental abuse  
And I said I gotta get you outta my head  
Everybodys always trying to look me over  
I just want to live simple and free  
  
Chorus  
I just want to get away  
Saving all your bullshit for another day  
Im the only one that can rescue me from me  
  
Leaving the house around quarter to five  
Zipped up my boots and Im ready to ride  
And I feel so high and I feel so alice  
Let my hair down feel the wind on my skin  
Crossin the border where my new life begins  
And I close my eyes and take it all in  
I dont need nobody tryin to make me over  
Dont make me over  
I just want to live simple and free  
  
Chorus x2  
  
You want to break me down Repeat x3
