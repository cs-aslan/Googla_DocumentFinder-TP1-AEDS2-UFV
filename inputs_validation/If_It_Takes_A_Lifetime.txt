If you think my name  
What gives you the right  
Couldnt take the place  
To be with you tonight  
When I fall asleep  
And I dream all night  
No matter where I go  
Cant you see  
What youre doing to me  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime  
Ill wait for you  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime  
Ill wait for you  
Get closer  
Closer to me  
Got stories I cant speak  
Got secrets I cant keep  
Cant hide what youre doing to me  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime  
Ill wait for you  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime  
Ill wait for you  
Ive had better days  
But Id never wait so long  
When I fall asleep  
And I dream all night  
No matter where I go  
Cant you see  
What youre doing to me  
Sleep awake  
All day all night  
I dream of you  
But I cant believe its true  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime  
Ill wait for you  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime  
Ill wait for you  
Ive had better days  
But Id never wait so long
