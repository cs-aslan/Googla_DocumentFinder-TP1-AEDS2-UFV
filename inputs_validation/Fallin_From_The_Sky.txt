I dont know how to make it stop no  
  
I got a phobia when it comes to heights  
Even if its a first class flight  
And as a kid I never really liked to climb  
If you pushed me hard on a swing then Id cry  
  
If I had a dream that I was flying  
Then Id wake up in a panic screaming  
  
And now you take me up and away with you  
Push me out of the plane with no parachute  
And now Im gonna need somebody to catch me  
Its like Im falling from the sky sky sky  
Im falling from the sky sky sky  
Its like Im falling form the sky sky sky  
And I need somebody to catch me  
  
Catch me when I come down down down down  
When I come down down down down  
When I come down down down down  
Will you catch me  
When I come down down down down  
When I come down  
  
I never ever wanted to climb a ladder  
And I never wanted a house in the hills  
Im comfortable living in a big high rise  
Cause in nightmares of getting killed  
I never wanted to swim the water there was too deep  
Put me up on the roof you couldnt pay me to leave  
Even if I was bummin on the streets  
You couldnt pay me to leave  
  
And now you take me up and away with you  
Push me out of the plane with no parachute  
And now Im gonna need somebody to catch me  
Its like Im falling from the sky sky sky  
Im falling from the sky sky sky  
Its like Im falling form the sky sky sky  
And I need somebody to catch me  
  
Catch me when I come down down down down  
When I come down down down down  
When I come down down down down  
Will you catch me  
When I come down down down down  
When I come down  
  
Girl Im running out of time come back around  
Only a few seconds before I hit the ground  
How do you expect me to fly when you are my wings  
Oh I cant breathe no  
Baby its like Im dreaming got nothing to hold on to  
I cant wake up girl laying next to you  
I cant think I cant sleep I cant eat  
  
Its like Im falling from the sky sky sky  
Im falling from the sky sky sky  
Its like Im falling form the sky sky sky  
And I need somebody to catch me  
Catch me when I come down down down down  
When I come down down down down  
When I come down down down down  
Will you catch me  
When I come down down down down  
When I come down  
  
Girl its like Im falling from the sky sky sky  
Im falling from the sky sky sky  
Its like Im falling form the sky sky sky  
And I need somebody to catch me  
Catch me when I come down down down down  
When I come down down down down  
When I come down down down down  
Will you catch me  
When I come down down down down  
When I come down
