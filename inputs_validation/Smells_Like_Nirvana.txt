What is this song all about  
Cant figure any lyrics out  
How do the words to it go  
I wish youd tell me I dont know  
Dont know dont know dont know oh no  
Dnnt know dont know dont know  
  
Now Im mumblin and Im screamin  
And I dont know what Im singin  
Crank the volume ears are bleedin  
I still dont know what Im singin  
Were so loud and incoherent  
Boy this oughtta bug your parents  
Yeah  
  
Its unintelligible  
I just cant get it through my skull  
Its hard to bargle nawdle zouss  
With all these marbles in my mouth  
Dont know dont know dont know oh no  
Dont know dont know dont know  
  
Well we dont sound like Madonna  
Here we are now were Nirvana  
Sing distinctly We dont wanna  
Buy our album were Nirvana  
A garage band from Seattle  
Well it sure beats raising cattle  
Yeah  
  
And I forgot the next verse  
Oh well I guess it pays to rehearse  
The lyric sheets so hard to find  
What are the words Oh nevermind  
Dont know dont know dont know oh no  
Dont know dont know dont know  
  
Well Im yellin and were playin  
But I dont know what Im sayin  
Whats the message Im conveyin  
Can you tell me what Im sayin  
So have you got some idea  
Didnt think so well Ill see ya  
Sayonara sayonara  
Ayonawa adinawa  
Odinaya yodinaya  
Yaddayadda yaaahyaaah  
Ayaaaaah
