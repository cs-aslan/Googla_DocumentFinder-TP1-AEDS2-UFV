Keep The Peace  
  
Should you fall into my arms again  
You know Ill pray with you  
You know Ill pray with you  
In my room at night your vision shining bright  
Im waiting for you  
Ill be waiting for you  
  
Dancing in the light  
Shadows fall from you  
Learn to watch your step  You come falling  
In my arms again in my heart again  
You will break like a butterfly  
  
Keep the peace for what youre talking  
Keep the Peace Keep the Peace  
Walk of fame is where youre walking  
Keep the Peace Keep the Peace  
  
Keep a hold of what youre taking  
Even though the walls are shaking  
Keep the peace theres still tomorrow  
Keep the Peace  
  
When you break into my arms again  
You know Ill stay with you  
You know Ill stay with you  
Now youre holding on Ill be with you tonight  
Ill watch over you  
Yeah Im watching over you  
  
On the street inside see the blinding light  
Am I dreaming  you come falling  
In my arms again in my heart again  
You will break like a butterfly  
  
Keep the peace the walls are talking  
Keep the Peace Keep the Peace  
Walk of fame is where youre walking  
Keep the Peace Keep the Peace  
Keep the Peace Keep the Peace  
Keep the Peace  
Keep a hold of what youre taking  
Even though the walls are shaking  
Keep the Peace Keep the Peace
