Voices a thousand thousand voices  
Whispering the time has passed for choices  
Golden days are passing over yeah  
  
I cant seem to see you baby  
Although my eyes are open wide  
But I know Ill see you once more  
When I see you Ill see you on the other side  
Yes Ill see you Ill see you on the other side  
  
Leaving I hate to see you cry  
Grieving I hate to say goodbye  
Dust and ash forever yeah  
  
Though I know we must be parted  
As sure as stars are in the sky  
Im gonna see when it comes to glory  
And Ill see you Ill see you on the other side  
Yes Ill see you Ill see you on the other side  
  
Never thought Id feel like this  
Strange to be alone yeah  
But well be together  
Carved in stone carved in stone carved in stone  
  
Hold me hold me tight Im falling  
Far away Distant voices calling  
Im so cold I need you darling yeah  
  
I was down but now Im flying  
Straight across the great divide  
I know youre crying but Ill stop you crying  
When I see you I see you on the other side  
Yes Ill see you See you on the other side  
Im gonna see you See you on the other side  
God knows Ill see you see you on the other side yeah  
  
Ill see you See you on the other side  
Im gonna see you See you on the other side  
God knows Ill see you see you on the other side yeah  
I wanna see you yeah yeah yeah see you on the other side  
God knows Ill see you see you on the other side yeah  
Im gonna see you See you on the other side
