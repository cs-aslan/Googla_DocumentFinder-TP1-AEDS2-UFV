La da da  
I just came here to chill  
We been kickin it for quite some time  
Lots of private parties where were winding down  
Tonight Im in a different mood  
Just want to get close to you  
No RSVP necessary  
Tonight its me and you girl  
Didnt bring my diamonds  
You dont have to put a dress on  
I just came here to chill  
Therell be no other VIP  
The partys only you and me  
I just came here to chill  
Youre a special lady  
The world can see  
Nobody makes a room shine  
Like you and me  
You always know just what to wear  
Nails just right lovely hair  
No need to put your makeup on  
Im not Mr Big cause tonight Im just incomprehensible  
Didnt bring my diamonds  
You dont have to put a dress on  
I just came here to chill  
Therell be no other VIP  
The partys only you and me  
See I I just came here to chill  
I dont mind a little champagne  
But no private chefs or restaurants  
Just a little home cookin on the spot yeah  
No invitations with our names  
No shakin hands with all the youknowwhos  
My focus is on you  
Didnt bring my diamonds  
You dont have to put a dress on  
See I I just came here to chill  
Therell be no other VIP  
The partys only you and me  
See I I just came here to chill  
Didnt bring my diamonds  
You dont have to put a dress on  
See I I just came here to chill  
Therell be no other VIP  
The partys only you and me  
See I I just came here to chill  
No Escalades parked in the valet  
Parked in the valet  
No redeye flights Im stayin in LA  
No movie stars with fancy cars  
No backstage passes to the latest show  
Tell R Kelly we aint coming no  
No relatives no friends we know  
Cause I just came here to chill  
Didnt bring my diamonds  
You dont have to put a dress on  
I just came here to chill  
Therell be no other VIP  
The partys only you and me  
See I I just came here to chill
