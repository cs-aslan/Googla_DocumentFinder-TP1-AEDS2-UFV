Well Im sorry for the things that I told you  
But words only go so far  
And if I had my way  
I would reach into heaven  
And Id pull down a star for a present  
And Id make you a chain out of diamonds  
And pearls from a summer sea  
But all I can give you is a kiss in the morning  
And a sweet apology  
  
Well I know that it hasnt been easy  
And I havent always been around  
To say the right words  
Or to hold you in the mornin  
Or to help you when youre down  
I know I never showed you much of a good time  
But baby things are gonna change  
Im gonna make up for all of the hurt I brought  
Im gonna love away all your pain  
  
And tomorrows gonna be a brighter day  
Theres gonna be some changes  
Tomorrows gonna be a brighter day  
This time you can believe me  
No more cryin in your lonely room  
And no more empty nights  
Cause tomorrow mornin everything will turn out right  
  
Well theres something that Ive got to tell you  
Yes Ive got something on my mind  
But words come hard  
When your lying in my arms  
And when Im looking deep into your eyes  
But theres truth and consolation  
And what Im trying to say  
Is that nobody ever had a rainbow baby  
Until he had the rain  
  
Its gonna its gonna its gonna be a brighter day  
Its gonna its gonna its gonna be a brighter day  
Its gonna its gonna its gonna be a brighter day  
Its gonna be its gonna be its gonna be a brighter day  
Its gonna be its gonna be its gonna be a brighter day  
Come on tomorrow  
Come on tomorrow  
Its gonna be a brighter day
