Your love got me trippin  
But now that youre flippin  
With my heart  
We were flying high but were dipping  
In my heart  
Ohh I am a fool for you  
I go running home  
Everytime you walk out on me  
I thought we were going strong but now its easy to see my mama was right
youre my  
Mamas worst nightmare no doubt about that  
You are my mamas worst nightmare  
No doubt that you are  
Your love got me running  
But now that youre cunning  
Little plans  
Ohh have got me flipping  
And dipping  
Youre cunning whilst  
Im running  
Youre my youre my youre myyy  
My mamas worst nightmare no  
Mamas worst nightmare no doubt about that  
You are my mamas worst nightmare  
No doubt that you are
