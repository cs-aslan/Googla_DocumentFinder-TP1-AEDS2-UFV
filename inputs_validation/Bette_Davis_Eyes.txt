Her hair is Harlowe gold  
Her lips sweet surprise  
Her hands are never cold  
Shes got Bette Davis eyes  
Shell turn her music on you  
You wont have to think twice  
Shes pure as New York snow  
She got Bette Davis eyes  
  
And shell tease you  
Shell unease you  
All the better just to please you  
Shes precocious and she knows just  
What it takes to make a pro blush  
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs  
Shes got Bette Davis eyes  
  
Shell let you take her home  
It whets her appetite  
Shell lay you on her throne  
She got Bette Davis eyes  
Shell take a tumble on you  
Roll you like you were dice  
Until you come out blue  
Shes got Bette Davis eyes  
  
Shell expose you when she snows you  
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you  
Shes ferocious and she knows just  
What it takes to make a pro blush  
All the boys think shes a spy  
Shes got Bette Davis eyes  
  
And shell tease you  
Shell unease you  
All the better just to please ya  
Shes precocious and she knows just  
What it takes to make a pro blush  
All the boys think shes a spy  
Shes got Bette Davis eyes  
  
Shell tease you  
Shell unease you  
Just to please ya  
Shes got Bette Davis eyes  
Shell expose you when she snows you  
She knows ya  
Shes got Bette Davis eyes
