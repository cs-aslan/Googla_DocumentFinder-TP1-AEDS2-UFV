If I needed you  
Would you come to me  
Would you come to me  
And ease my pain  
If you needed me  
I would come to you  
Id swim the seas  
For to ease your pain  
  
In the night forlorn  
The mornings born  
And the morning shines  
With the lights of love  
You will miss sunrise  
If you close your eyes  
That would break  
My heart in two  
  
The ladys with me now  
Since I showed her how  
To lay her lily  
Hand in mine  
Loop and Lil agree  
Shes a sight to see  
And a treasure for  
The poor to find  
  
If I needed you  
Would you come to me  
Would you come to me  
And ease my pain  
If you needed me  
I would come to you  
Id swim the seas  
For to ease your pain
