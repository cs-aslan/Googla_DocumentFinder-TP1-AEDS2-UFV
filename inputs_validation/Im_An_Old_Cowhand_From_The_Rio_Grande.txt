Im an old cowhand from the Rio Grande  
But my legs aint bowed and my cheeks aint tan  
Im a cowboy who never saw a cow  
Never roped a steer cause I dont know how  
Sure aint a fixing to start in now  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
  
Im an old cowhand and I come down from the Rio Grande  
And I learned to ride ride ride fore I learned to stand  
Im a riding fool who is up to date  
I know every trail in the Lone Star State  
Cause I ride the range in a Ford V8  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
  
Were old cowhands from the Rio Grande  
And we come to town just to hear the band  
We know all the songs that the cowboys know  
Bout the big corral where the doggies go  
We learned them all on the radio  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
  
Im an old cowhand  
Oh yes Mr Bing  
Too hot for you Uncle Fudd  
Down from the Rio Grande  
Oh where the west is wild all around the borderland  
Where the buffalo roam around the zoo  
and the Injuns run up a rug or two  
and the old Bar X is just a barbecue yeah  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
  
Im a pioneer who began from scratch  
I dont bat an eye in a shootin match  
They dont call me Elmer they call me Satch  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
  
Get along little horsy  
Get along little horsy  
Yippie yi yo kayah oh
