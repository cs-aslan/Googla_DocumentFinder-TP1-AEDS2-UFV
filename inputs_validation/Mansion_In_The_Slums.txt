Id much rather have a cavern in the hills  
Than a mansion in the slums  
The taste of success only lasts you  
Half an hour or less  
But it loves you when it comes  
And you laugh at yourself  
While youre bleeding to death  
Id much rather have a trampoline in my front room  
Than an isolation tank  
I wish I was a million miles away  
From the managers door  
There is trouble at the bank  
You laugh at yourself  
As you go deep into debt  
Laugh at yourself  
While hes breathing down your neck  
Who can stop me  
With money in my pocket  
Sometimes I get it free  
The best of both worlds  
Id much rather have a caravan in the hills  
Id much rather have a mansionin the hills  
Than a mansion in the slums  
Yeah Id much rather  
What I mean is would you mind if I had it all  
Ill take it when it comes  
And you laugh at yourself  
While youre bleeding to death  
And somebody else is always  
Breathing down your neck  
Laugh at yourself  
While hes hanging over your head  
The best of both worlds  
Itll soon be over
