Im just a wandering gypsy  
Ill sing for you tonight  
And when the seats are empty  
Ill turn and walk into my spotlight  
And Ill be in the place where I belong  
  
For who will tell the story  
Except someone like me  
Of tragedy and glory  
Of lovers as they walk so blindly  
And try to find a place where they belong  
We all must find a place where we belong  
  
Everybody knows me  
Everone shows me  
And Ill be here when you have gone  
For the road to carry on  
We all must find a place where we belong  
  
If destiny has spoken  
If finally the dawn has broken  
We all must find a place where we belong  
  
Im just a wandering gypsy  
Ive sung for you tonight  
And now the seats are empty  
Ill turn and walk into my spotlight  
And Ill be in the place where I belong
