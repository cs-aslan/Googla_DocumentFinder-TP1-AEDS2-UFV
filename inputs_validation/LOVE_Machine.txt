Lady have you known me  
The perfect love machine ah  
Virgo my Leos rising  
Venus made me king  
That trail of broken hearts  
They all belong to me  
Magic runs through my fingers  
One touch youll see  
  
Chorus  
LOVE All I needs my love machine oh  
LOVE All I needs my love machine oh  
LOVE All I needs my love machine oh  
LOVE All I needs my love machine tonighttonight  
  
What can I do for you am I your wildest dream  
What do I move in you am I what I seem  
My eyes they lie and you cry  
Love brings you pain  
And if you try to love me  
Youll not feel the same  
  
Chorus x2
