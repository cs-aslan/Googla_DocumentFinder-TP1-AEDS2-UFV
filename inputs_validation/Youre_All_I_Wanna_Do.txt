I just want to see  
What its like to be  
Caught in your eyes  
I wish youd talk to me  
Im not cut out to be the one lonely child

One whod always be drawn to me  
Im going crazy tonight

Baby youre all I wana do  
With my time  
Baby youre all I want to do anytime

When you stay next to me  
Its not so hard to see  
Whats burning my eyes

When youre cut out be the one lonely child  
  
I look at you and your younger sister  
Theres always something that smile on you  
I know youre crazy tonight

Do you in the morning
