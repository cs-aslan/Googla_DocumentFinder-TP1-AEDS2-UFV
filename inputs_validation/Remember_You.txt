Shes about to earn some bragging rights  
Im bout to give it up like Ive been holding back all night  
Girl take pride in what you wanna do  
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you  
Baby I dont mind  
You can tell by how I roll  
Cause my clique hard and my cup cold  
My tongue slurred cause Im so throwed  
And Im wiping sweat from my last show  
And hes TG and Im XO  
Im only here for one night  
And Imma be your memory  
Sing it in my ears so I can hear what youre saying to me  
I got cups full of that Rose  
Smoke anything thats passed to me  
Dont worry bout my boys  
I wont need it for what Im about to do to you  
Bad bitch girl I think I might get used to you  
Imma have to take your number when Im through with you  
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory  
Make me remember you like you remember me  
Bad bitch girl I think I might get used to you  
Imma have to take your number when Im through with you  
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory  
Make me remember you like you remember me  
  
Old rapping ass  
Lightyears past the class  
Hit it dont have to pass  
Nigga we the new Aftermath  
Niggas after fame I just had to laugh  
Niggas after fame Im after cash  
Yous a fan of a player  
Im the man yous a hater  
And I only smoke papers  
Thats how you tell them Taylors  
Nigga listen  
Break it down rolling weed on the island of my kitchen  
And not a thing comes out without permission  
Look everything I got on I was made for  
Everything that I got I done came for  
All the shit that you see I done slaved for  
All the cars and the crib yeah thats paid for  
Need I say more  
Spend so much money on clothes  
Said fuck a store making my own  
I hope that youre rolling one up while youre singing along  
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song  
Pour out some shots  
Youre taking too long  
Young and Im rich  
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade  
  
Chorus  
Good to you  
Bad bitch girl I think I might get used to you  
Imma have to take your number when Im through with you  
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory  
Make me remember you like you remember me  
Bad bitch girl I think I might get used to you  
Imma have to take your number when Im through with you  
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory  
Make me remember you like you remember me  
  
Im on some gin you on some gin  
Im moving slow Im driving fast  
I hit the weed you take the wheel  
We lose control  
Drop the top in that 69  
Not Motor 1 not old Chevelle  
Cant say things like supposed to feel  
Stacking all of this paper dawg  
I like to call this shit old news  
It means haters jocking our old moves  
Popping champagne cause we made it  
Pack in the Phantom we faded  
All of this shit that I did I probably wont remember tomorrow  
  
Chorus
