Theres a pirate known to fame  
Black Macocco was the Pirates name  
In his day the tops was he  
Round the Caribbean or Caribbean Sea  
When he sites a clipper ship  
Mack would board her and begin to clip  
First hed grab the ladies fair  
Especially those with jewels  
Those with jewels to spare  
Especially those with jewels  
Those with jewels to spare  
Especially those with jewels  
Especially those with jewels  
Those with jewels to spare  
With his ladies and his loot  
Next Macocco from the ship would scoot  
Then hed set the ship afirewhat a pretty funeral  
Funeral pyre  
Mack the Black what a pretty funeral  
Mack the Black marvelous funeral pyre  
Though the years this black Macocco  
Lead his pirate reign  
His claim to fame was as black as his name  
All around the Spanish Maine  
When hed a make his daily rounds  
Gals would trail him like a pack of hounds  
Evry night hed have a date Ladies go to pieces  
Over pieces of eight  
Hey  
Sleep my baby baby sleep  
Time for babe to be in slumber deep  
If you wake or cry or laugh  
Mack the Black will whack ya  
And hell whack ya in half  
Mack the black will really whack  
Mack the black will whack ya  
Mack the black would really have to  
Whack ya in half  
Mack the Black will really whack ya  
Mack the Black will whack ya  
Mack the black will whack ya  
And hell whack ya  
Aaaaaah Mack was ruthless  
Mack was feared  
Perhaps its better that he disappeared  
Yet I know that he was bad  
I could fall in love with  
Fall in love with the lad  
Evening star if you see Mack  
Stop his wanderings and guide him back  
Ill be waiting patiently  
By the Caribbean or Caribbean Sea  
Is that the Caribbean Sea  
And if I met this famous pirate  
Met him face to face  
You think Id run and hide my head  
And scream around the place  
Why no Id just sashay around  
Displaying all my charms  
And soon Id have him walk the plank  
Right into my arms  
Thats what I think of Mack the Black Macocco
