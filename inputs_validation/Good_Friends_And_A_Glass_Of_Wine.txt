I need a good friend  
  
Well who died and crowned me everybodys everything  
Im even busting my butt through the weekend  
By the time I get home theres not an ounce of sanity  
Between the dogs my mamas calls is it against the law  
For me to get what I need  
  
A good friend and a glass of wine  
Someone to say its going to be alright  
A good friend and a glass of wine  
A little pick me up to get me through the night  
We talk trash and we laugh and cry  
That kind of therapy money cant buy  
Every now and then every now and then  
Every girl needs  
A good friend and a glass of wine  
  
I dont need to jet off on no vacation for a week  
Id be happy to have a happy hour  
When Im tired and Im fried  
It gets me right back on my feet  
Yeah any kind red or white a little sister time  
Its every smart girls secret  
  
A good friend and glass of wine  
Someone to say its going to be alright  
A good friend and glass of wine  
A little pick me up to get me through the night  
We talk trash and we laugh and cry  
That kind of therapy money cant buy  
Every now and then every now and then  
Every girl needs  
A good friend and a glass of wine  
  
A good friend and a glass of wine  
Someone to say its going to be alright  
A good friend and a glass of wine  
A little pick me up to get me through the night  
We talk trash and we laugh and cry  
That kind of therapy money cant buy  
Every now and then every now and then  
Every girl needs  
Every now and then every now and then  
Ever girl needs  
A good friend and glass of wine  
  
Good friend and a glass of wine  
Dont you know that every girl needs  
A good friend and glass of wine
