You keep on accusing me  
Of making your life misery  
But if thats not abusing me what isnt  
You wanna be my friend well its too late  
My love for you has turned to hate  
And I think that its a permanent condition  
You say you wanna make the peace  
Smile and turn the other cheek  
I cant put myself in such a weak position  
Now Im willing to accept this fate  
You and me just cant cohabitate  
We agree to hate and thats our fast decision  
  
Hatred hatred  
Is the only thing that keeps us together  
Hatred hatred  
Is the only thing that lasts forever  
  
Driven by hate driven by hate  
Driven by hate driven by hate  
On the surface Im a mildmannered person  
Thats until you scratch the animal inside  
Then you bring out all my animal aggression  
I gotta hatred for you that is never gonna die  
Driven to hate driven to hate  
Driven to hate driven to hate  
  
Chorus  
Hatred hatred  
Is the only thing that lasts forever  
Hatred hatred  
Is the only thing that keeps us together  
  
While races try to integrate  
Nations try to gravitate  
Towards equal rights regardless of religion  
Politicians might decree  
For the sake of humanity  
Love and peace instead of a collision  
You and me accept reality  
Theres no way that we can agree  
The world cant make us alter this position  
At least you and I know where we stand  
We cant be friends walk hand in hand  
My hostility for you defies description  
  
Hatred hatred  
Is the only thing that keeps us together  
Hatred hatred  
Is the only thing that lasts forever  
  
Driven by hate driven by hate  
Driven by hate driven by hate  
Hates the only thing we have in common  
Theres no escape well always be this way  
So we might as well just learn to live together  
Cause were gonna be this way till our dying day  
Driven by hate driven by hate  
Driven by hate driven by hate  
  
Chorus  
  
If you keep on putting me down  
Rub my name into the ground  
Ill drag the dirt all over town about you  
And if you spread the filth on me  
Ill only have one remedy  
Ill spill the beans youll see Ive got a mouth too  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
Yeah hatred  
Your attitude is downright rude  
Your jokes appall me theyre so crude  
Why dont you just drop dead and dont recover  
Im the mirror to your mood  
You hate me and I hate you  
So at least we understand each other  
Hatred hatred is the only thing that lasts what is it  
Hatred hatred  
  
Hatred hatred  
Is the only thing that lasts forever  
Hatred hatred  
Is the only thing that lasts forever
