You know it aint no use  
Banging your head  
Up against a cold stone wall  
Cause no one perfect  
Except for the Lord  
Even the bests bound to fall  
  
Remember  
He is the vine  
And you are the branch  
He loves to get you through it if you give him a chance  
You just keep doing your best  
And pray that its blessed  
And Jesus takes care of the rest  
  
Yes the Lord said Hell take care of the rest  
Hes gonna do it  
Hell take care of the rest  
Hell see you through it yeah  
Hell take care of the rest  
The devil blew it  
Old pharaoh blew it  
His neighbors blew it  
Well Hell take care of the  
Hell take care of the rest  
  
You just think about Moses  
In front of the burning bush  
Barefoot on the holy ground  
You know he mustve been thinking
