This is a story about a scarlet letter yeah  
  
It just hit me as I lay my head down  
No one around  
In the dark cold night I hear a sound  
In my head keeping track of everything youve ever said  
Must be something but its nothing so I just go back to bed  
  
Its four crack the door to the hallway of my dreams  
But it seems that my hallway keeps closing in on me  
Forcing me out  
Making me think about you and how youre gone  
I see four ofive with teary eyes and then I write this song  
  
Chorus  
And I just cant believe that it has to be this way  
You know we say it seems to me that it was just the other day  
I saw your face I saw your light you ran the race you fought the fight  
But now its all being torn down for me tonight  
  
And I know it might be a little selfish for me to say  
But I need to know if you thought of me at all today  
Cause everyday I walk past the place you left five days of the week  
And now its ten after four and I am taken by sleep  
End Chorus  
  
Spending hours on end  
Deciding what Id say to a friend  
If I ever saw em again  
  
Cause I dont know if I know and dont wanna come across the wrong way  
Cause I dont know if I know but I know I wanna see your face today  
  
Then somebody told me they saw you cry and break down  
Do you know how hard that is to get around and think about  
Its not like you to let emotions get the best of things  
Especially when everything is hanging in the air we breath  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill sing a song to you my friend  
Ill sing a song to you my friend  
Ill sing a song to you my friend  
Ill sing a song to you my Lets go  
  
Friend Yeah3x  
  
Ill sing a song to you my friend4x
