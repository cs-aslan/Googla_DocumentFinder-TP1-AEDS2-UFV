What can I say dear after I say Im sorry  
What can I do to prove it to you Im sorry  
I didnt mean to ever be mean to you  
If I didnt care I wouldnt feel like I do  
  
I was all wrong but right or wrong I dont blame you  
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you  
I know that I made you cry and Im so sorry dear  
So what can I say dear after I say Im sorry  
  
Tell me baby  
What can I say dear after I say Im sorry so so sorry  
What can I do to prove it to you Im sorry  
Oh I didnt mean to ever be mean to you  
If I didnt care I wouldnt feel like  
Oh I wouldnt feel like I do do do

Why should I take somebody like you and shame you  
I know that I made you cry and Im so sorry dear  
Sorry I made you cry boo hoo hoo hoo
