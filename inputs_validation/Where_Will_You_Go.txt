Youre too important for anyone  
Theres something wrong with everything you see  
But I I know who you really are  
Youre the one who cries when youre alone  
  
Chorus  
But where will you go  
With no one left to save you from yourself  
You cant escape  
You cant escape  
  
You think that I cant see right through your eyes  
Scared to death to face reality  
No one seems to hear your hidden cries  
Youre left to face yourself alone  
  
Chorus  
  
I realize youre afraid  
But you cant abandon everyone  
You cant escape  
You dont want to escape  
  
Im so sick of speaking words that no one understands  
Is it clear enough that you cant live your whole life all alone  
I can hear you in a whisper  
But you cant even hear me screaming  
  
Chorus  
  
I realize youre afraid  
But you cant reject the whole world  
You cant escape  
You wont escape  
You cant escape  
You dont want to escape
