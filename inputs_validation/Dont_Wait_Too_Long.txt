You are the summer and I am the autumn  
Dont wait too long  
Your songs beginning while mines nearly sung  
Dont wait too long  
  
Fall is a lovely time of the year  
When leaves turn to golden brown  
But soon fall is ending and winter is near  
And the leaves start tumblin down  
  
Why must the moments go by in such haste  
Dont wait too long  
Winter is coming Ive no time to waste  
Dont wait too long  
  
So while my hearts gay and foolish and free and still can sing its song  
Share every precious moment with me dont you wait too long
