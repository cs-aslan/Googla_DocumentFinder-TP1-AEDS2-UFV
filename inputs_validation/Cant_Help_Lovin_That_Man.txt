From Show Boat  
  
Oh listen sister  
I love my mister man  
And I cant tell you why  
There is no reason why I should love that man  
It must be somethin that de angels have planned  
Fish gotta swim birds gotta fly  
I gotta love one man till I die  
Cant help lovin that man of mine  
Tell me hes lazy tell me hes slow  
Tell me Im crazy maybe I know  
Cant help lovin that man of mine  
When he goes away thats a rainy day  
And when he comes back that day is fine  
The sun will shine  
He can come home as late as can be  
Home without him aint no home to me  
Cant help lovin that man of mine  
Cant help lovin that man of mine
