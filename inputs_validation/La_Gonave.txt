La Gonave I see your mist  
La Gonave well I know youre kissed  
By the same sea of trouble  
That stretches back home  
La Gonave  
Youve got troubles of your own  
  
Yes I got troubles  
Wont you come on and see  
I got my needs just follow me  
But they gonna ease by and by  
If you tell all the people  
That its no lie  
  
You only came for forty eight hours  
Didnt realize how useless I was  
Came to you for the nation sells lies  
Lord knows but I still feel helpless  
  
La Gonave I dont feel good  
La Gonave do you think I should  
Turn my back and walk away  
La Gonave tell me what to say  
  
If Id been at home  
Would you telephone me  
Im situated across the sea  
But its a small world from any point  
Of view  
Spare a thought  
This could have been you  
  
You shook my senses  
Took my time  
Froze my feeling  
Broke my mind  
La Gonave youve played your part  
La Gonave you sure got heart  
  
Didnt leave my heart in San Francisco  
Didnt want to stay in Omaha  
Never got fooled by New York city  
But I lost my heart to la Gonave  
  
Didnt leave my heart in San Francisco  
Didnt want to stay in Omaha  
Never got fooled by New York city  
But I lost my heart to la Gonave  
  
Didnt leave my heart in San Francisco  
Didnt want to stay in Omaha  
Never got fooled by New York city  
But I lost my heart to la Gonave
