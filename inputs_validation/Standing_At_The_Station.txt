Well Im standin at the station  
And the rain dont make a sound  
Got a Bible in my pocket  
Cause my plane was just shot down  
My mind is all confusion  
I believe Im in a play  
Throw my Bible out the window  
As the train goes on its way  
  
Gonna leave my blues behind me  
Gonna find another town  
Gonna try and find some people  
Who this time wont bring me down  
As I step out of the carriage  
The station looks the same  
As the one I left behind me  
Though it has another name
