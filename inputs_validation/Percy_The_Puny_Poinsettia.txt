Percy the puny poinsettia  
Is hanging his bloom in dismay  
If they had just kept him wetta  
Hed be a houseplant today  
Folks liked the other plants betta  
Now hes alone on the shelf  
Even a plant with no uncle or aunt  
Shouldnt spend Christmas Day by himself  
  
Holiday shoppers would stop by the counter  
And pick up a plant to take home  
Until one by one all his friends were adopted  
And Percy was left all alone  
  
Percy the puny poinsettia  
Is hanging his bloom in dismay  
If they had just kept him wetta  
Hed be a houseplant today  
Folks liked the other plants betta  
Now hes alone on the shelf  
Even a plant with no uncle or aunt  
Shouldnt spend Christmas Day by himself  
  
Then into the store on the night before Christmas  
Came a poor little girl who was cryin  
But when she saw Percy her eyes opened wide  
And she said Can I please make him mine  
  
Now Percy the puny poinsettia  
Is standing beside Mr Tree  
His leaves have never been redda  
Hes as proud as a flower can be  
  
Somebody made him feel betta  
Rescued him off of the shelf  
Even a plant with no uncle or aunt  
Shouldnt spend Christmas Day by himself
