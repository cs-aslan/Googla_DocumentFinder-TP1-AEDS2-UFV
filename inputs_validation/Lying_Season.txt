Theres no reason  
To deny  
Its the season  
Of the lie  
  
Having someone  
Grin at you  
Look at little fingers  
Pointing truth  
  
Man its a weight on my mind  
And thats fine  
But now we wade past the point of decline  
Theres no time  
  
Im a believer  
In the new  
Past receiver  
All come true  
  
Look to the east  
Filled with hate  
Neutral flashers  
While we wait  
  
Man its a weight on my mind  
And thats fine  
But now we wade past the point of decline  
Theres no time  
  
Im an old lover  
Youre so sane  
Whos the answer  
Of what I mean  
  
In this ocean  
I fell into  
Break me out of  
The shell I grew  
  
Man its a weight on my mind  
And thats fine  
But now we wade past the point of decline  
Theres no time  
  
Theres no time  
Theres no time  
Theres no time  
Theres no time  
No time  
Theres no time  
No time  
Theres no time
