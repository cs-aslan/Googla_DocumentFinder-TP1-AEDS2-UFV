I was crosswired underground  
Nothing seemed to fit  
I was fried and memory bound  
Then it came to me  
  
Devil digger  
Unforgiver  
  
I was on a different plane  
He said come to me  
Laid his hands upon my brow  
Thats the last of me  
  
Devil digger  
Unbeliever  
  
Dont be sorry  
Its no disgrace  
But never worry unless  
You have no faith  
  
See him coming  
He has no face  
You must stop running  
You must have faith  
  
Deaths not final so were told  
Words are so profound  
Who the hell wants to get old  
But ask in the final hours  
  
Devil digger unbeliever  
Devil digger unforgiver  
  
See him coming  
He has no face  
You must stop running  
You must have faith  
  
I dont want to fade away  
I dont want to fade away  
I dont want to fade away  
I dont want to fade away
