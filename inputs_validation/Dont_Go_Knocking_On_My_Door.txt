Dont go knock on my door  
Dont go knock on my door  
  
Time is up  
No more cheat n lie  
No more tears to dry  
You and I were like so byebye  
Finally  
I am over you  
Totally unblue  
And I can hear myself saying  
I am better off without you  
Stronger than ever and I  
Im tellin you now  
  
Chorus  
Dont go knockin on my door  
Gotta stay away for sure  
You say you miss me like crazy now  
But I aint buyin that  
You better get off my back  
Dont go knockin on my door  
  
I can see  
Its no mystery  
Its so clear to me  
What we had is all history  
Its ok  
I can sleep at night  
It will be alright  
I can hear myself saying  
I am better off without you Stronger than ever and I  
Im tellin you now  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Dont go knockin on my door  
Dont go knockin on my door  
Dont go knockin on my door  
Do what you want  
As long as you dont come back  
Dont go knockin on my door  
Gotta stay away for sure  
And now I aint buyin that  
You better get off my back  
  
Repeat chorus
