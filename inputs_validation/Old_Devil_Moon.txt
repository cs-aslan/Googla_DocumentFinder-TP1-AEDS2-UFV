I look at you and suddenly  
Something in your eyes I see  
Soon begins bewitching me  
Its that old devil moon  
That you stole from the skies  
Its that old devil moon in your eyes  
  
You and you glance make this romance  
Too hot to handle  
Stars in the night  
Blazing their light  
Cant hold a candle  
To your razzledazzle  
  
Youve got me flyin high and wide  
On a magic carpet ride  
Full of butterflies inside  
Wanna cry wanna croon  
Wanna laugh like a loon  
Its that old devil moon in your eyes  
  
Just when I think  
Im free as a dove  
Old devil moon  
Deep in your eyes  
Blinds me with love
