The ol log is burnin  
Yellow and red  
Small eyes are fightin  
That ol sleepy head  
Stockins are filled  
While stories of goodwill are told  
At the edge of the bed  
Its an old time Christmas  
Family and friends round the tree  
Its an old time Christmas  
Like the ones in my memory  
Now the gifts are all open  
The kids in the yard  
Granddad nods off in a chair  
And the smells from the kitchen  
Are to fine to mention  
And theres peace  
On Earth everywhere  
Its an old time Christmas  
Family and friends round the tree  
Its an old time Christmas  
Like the ones in my memory  
Church bells ringin  
Choirs singin everywhere  
Theres love in the air  
Its an old time Christmas  
Family and friends roubd the tree  
Its an old time Christmas  
Like the ones in my memory  
Its an old time Christmas  
Like the ones in my memory
