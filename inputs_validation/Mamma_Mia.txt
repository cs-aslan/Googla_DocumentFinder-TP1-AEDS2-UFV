Chorus  
Mamma mia here I go again  
My my how can I resist you  
Mamma mia does it show again  
My my just how much Ive missed you  
  
Yes Ive been brokenhearted  
Blue since the day we parted  
Why why did I ever let you go  
Mamma mia now I really know  
My my I could never let you go  
Ive been angry and sad about things that you do  
I cant count all the times that Ive told you were through  
And when you go when you slam the door  
I think you know that you wont be away too long  
You know that Im not that strong  
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring  
One more look and I forget everything  
  
Chorus  
  
Yes Ive been brokenhearted  
Blue since the day we parted  
Why why did I ever let you go  
Mamma mia even if I say  
Bye bye leave me now or never  
Mamma mia its a game we play  
Bye bye doesnt mean forever  
  
Chorus  
  
Yes Ive been brokenhearted  
Blue since the day we parted  
Why why did I ever let you go  
Mamma mia now I really know  
My my I could never let you go
