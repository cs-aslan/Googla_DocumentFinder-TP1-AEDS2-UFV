You bring me happiness then leave me loneliness  
My world is in distress yet I keep falling for you  
You look into my eyes and tell the sweetest lies  
Youre a heartbreak in disguise yet I keep falling for you  
  
Oh darling when youre near my world is happy dear  
But when you disappear I dont know what to do  
I love in misery youre so unfair to me its such a mystery why I keep falling
for you  
  
Oh darling when youre near  
Its such a mystery why I keep falling for you
