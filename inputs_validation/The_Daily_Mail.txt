The moon is high up on a mountain  
The lunatics have taken over the asylum  
Waiting on the rapture  
  
Singing Were here to keep your prices down  
Well feed you to the hounds  
To the daily mail to get up together  
  
You made a pigs ear you made a mistake  
Paid off security and got through the gate  
You got away with it but we lie in wait eh  
Eh eh  
  
Wheres the truth whats the use  
Im hanging around lost and found  
And when youre here innocent  
Fat chance no plan  
No regard for human life  
  
Youll keep time youve no right  
Youre fast to lose you will lose  
You jumped the queue youre back again  
  
President for life love of all  
The flies in the sky the beasts of the earth  
The fish in the sea have lost command
