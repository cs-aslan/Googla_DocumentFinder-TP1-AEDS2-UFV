I was young  
I was cold but not insane  
I had one good friend  
It was a voice without a name  
And so here we are  
Same need and same mistake  
But it could be yours  
You see it could be even be yours  
I said Ive done things  
That left me hurt and ashamed  
She said all I need  
Is a place to hide the pain  
She said dont trust dreams  
Because dreams will break your heart  
I said little girls play in the house of shame  
Some of us play like God  
Play like God  
Save my soul  
Play like God  
I know that God dont live here in my heart  
She said touch my soul  
Ive never touched someone so cold  
She said touch my heart  
Ive never touched something so old  
She said play like God  
And then you can play with me  
I moved underground  
And caught the isolation blues  
Sound familiar  
I said kiss my face  
Ive seen things youll never see  
She said kiss my arse  
Ive been everything I need  
She said memories  
Are only there to make you bleed  
I said little girls play in big boys games  
Some of us play but cry  
Play like God  
Save my soul  
Play like God  
I know that God dont live here in my world  
Where do we belong  
She said Ive been sick  
But then noones clean for long  
She said pray for me  
Like God Ive fucked the world  
I said little girls play with the big disease  
Some of us play with you
