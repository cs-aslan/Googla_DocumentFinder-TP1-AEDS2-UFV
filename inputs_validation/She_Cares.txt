I tried to be the perfect soldier  
I tried to be what everyone said was expected  
Somehow I was selected  
Well my hands were steady my aim was true  
But deep inside of my heart I knew  
That I lacked the will  
I just couldnt shoot to kill  
  
And still she treats me like a human  
She says shell still be there  
I may not be a hero but Ill be there  
Because I know she cares  
  
I worked hard to be the greatest lover  
I wanted to be sure that I was her only one  
Thats how I thought it was done  
But I went too far assumed too much  
The need to feel a younger ones touch  
Seemed important then  
Oh what a fool Ive been  
  
And still she treats me like a human like a human  
She says shell still be there that shell be there  
I dont quite understand it shes been too fair  
Cause somehow she cares  
  
I guess thats the way it goes the way that it goes  
And nobody knows what compels her  
Shes seen my highs and lows and never let go  
  
Oh yes she treats me like a human like a human  
She says shell still be there that shell be there  
I dont quite understand it shes been too fair  
Cause somehow she cares  
  
I guess thats the way it goes the way that it goes  
And nobody knows what compels her  
Shes seen my highs and lows and never let go  
  
And when the world has turned its back on me  
I wont have to feel alone  
Cause I know she cares
