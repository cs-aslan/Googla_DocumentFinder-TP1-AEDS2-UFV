Nothing left no regrets  
No hard feelings wish you all the best  
No blame no shame  
Just time to say its over I guess  
We both agree its the right thing  
The only thing left to do  
You win I win we lose  
  
Sometimes love dont work out  
No matter how hard you try  
Lord knows we didnt start out to say goodbye  
If its a winwin situation  
Then why am I feelin so blue  
You win I win we lose  
  
You take yours Ill take mine  
Well leave nothing but the memories behind  
Of a love and a dream  
That just somehow faded with time  
You say youre goin your way  
Im goin somewhere too  
You win I win we lose  
  
Sometimes love dont work out  
No matter how hard you try  
Lord knows we didnt start out to say goodbye  
If its a winwin situation  
Then why am I feelin so blue  
You win I win we lose  
  
If its a winwin situation  
Then why am I feelin so blue  
You win I win we lose  
  
If you win and I win we lose  
We lose
