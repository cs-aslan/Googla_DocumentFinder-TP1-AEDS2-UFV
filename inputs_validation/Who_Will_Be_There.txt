Who will be there  
Who will be there  
  
The rain is getting stronger I listen to the rain  
And I cant wait no longer oh please come back again  
If I could live forever baby I will live with you  
If we cant be together baby I will die its true  
  
Who will be there when the lights go out  
Who will be there my heart cries loud  
Baby I swear that Ill be there if you need me  
  
Who will be there when Im alone  
Who will be there where is my home  
Who will be there its so unfair stay by my said  
  
Who will be there  
Who will be there  
  
The summer was oh magic oh baby just we two  
Now times are getting tragic and lonely without you  
Oh when my heart is crying baby oh it cries for you  
And if our love is dying baby I will die its true  
  
Who will be there when the lights go out  
Who will be there my heart cries loud  
Baby I swear that Ill be there if you need me  
  
Who will be there when Im alone  
Who will be there where is my home  
Who will be there its so unfair stay by my said  
  
Who will be there when the lights go out  
And when my heart cries loud  
And if you need me  
  
Who will be there when the lights go out who will be there  
Who will be there my heart cries loud who will be there  
Baby I swear that Ill be there if you need me  
  
Who will be there when Im alone  
Who will be there where is my home  
Who will be there its so unfair stay by my said  
  
Who will be there who will be there  
Who will be there who will be there
