Therell be no moon tonight  
And the stars wont light the sky  
There are women on the streets  
But theres no loving in their eyes  
Feeling weary tired and wishing  
I was standing in your doorway now  
Therell be dancing flames  
Something special cooking slow  
Perfume heavy and all the lanterns turned down low  
Oh that lucky oh that lucky man  
Who is standing in your doorway now  
Im a wandering man  
Youll never tie me down  
Lifelong sailor but how I wish I was homeward bound  
At this moment tired and wishing  
I was standing in your doorway now
