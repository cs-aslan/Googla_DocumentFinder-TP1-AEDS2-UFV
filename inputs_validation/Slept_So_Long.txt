Walking waiting alone without a care  
Hoping and hating the things that I cant bear  
Did you think its cool to walk right up  
To take my life and fuck it up Well did you Well did you  
  
I see Hell in your eyes  
Im taken in by surprise  
And touching you makes me feel alive  
And touching you makes me die inside  
  
Walking waiting alone without a care

Did you think its cool to walk right up  
To take my life and fuck it up Well did you I hate you  
  
I see Hell in your eyes  
Im taken in by surprise  
And touching you makes me feel alive  
And touching you makes me die inside  
  
Ive slept so long without you  
Its tearing me apart too  
Howd it get this far  
Playing games with this old heart  
  
Ive killed a million petty souls  
But I couldnt kill you  
Ive slept so long without you  
  
Touching you makes me die inside  
I see hell in your eyes  
Touching you makes me die inside  
Im taken in by surprise  
  
Touching you makes me die inside  
And touching you makes me feel alive  
Touching you makes me die inside  
And touching you makes me die inside  
  
Touching you makes me die inside  
I see hell in your eyes  
Touching you makes me die inside  
Im taken in by surprise  
  
Touching you makes me die inside  
And touching you makes me feel alive  
Touching you makes me die inside  
And touching you makes me die inside  
  
Touching you makes me die inside  
I see hell in your eyes  
Touching you makes me die inside  
Im taken in by surprise  
Touching you makes me die inside
