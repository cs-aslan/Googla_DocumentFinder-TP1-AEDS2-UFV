once I built a railroad made it run  
made it race against time  
once I built a rairoad now its done  
brother can you spare a dime  
once I built a tower to the sun  
brick and rivet and lime  
once I built a tower now its done  
brother can you spare a dime  
  
once in khaki suits  
gee we looked swell  
full of that yankee Doodle De Dum  
half a million boots went slogging through hell  
I was the kid with the drum  
say dont you remember they called me Al  
It was Al all the time  
say dont you remember Im your pal  
buddy can you spare a dime
