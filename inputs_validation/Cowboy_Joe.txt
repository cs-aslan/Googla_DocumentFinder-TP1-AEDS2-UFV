instrumental  
Im not looking to change your mind  
Theres a place call it home  
Its no secret the world unwinds  
Maybe now youre not alone  
Its just another day  
In the life of cowboy joe  
Straitlaced to the bone  
this story will not play   
You take the wheel and play the chance  
Suddenly the rooms divided  
As in the way of true romance  
Its always undecided  
Its just another day  
In the life of cowboy joe  
Shipwrecked to the bay  
this story will not play   
Every time he climbs back up  
Smacked down with a dime  
Its evens or odds now  
Just ran out of time  
instrumental  
Loves a struggle theres a fight  
No bone of contention  
So unhappy well heres the bite  
Thats the mother of invention  
Its just another day  
In the life of cowboy joe  
Strange place to play  
Its just another day  
In the life of cowboy joe  
fade out
