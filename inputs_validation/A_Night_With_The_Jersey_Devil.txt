Hear me now  
I was born 13th child  
neath the 13th moon  
Spit out hungry  
And born anew  
Daddy drag me  
To the river  
Tie me in rocks  
Throw me in where  
Its deep and wide  
I go down I dont die  
Hole  
In the river bottom  
I crawl through  
Come back  
Kill six brothers  
And sisters  
Kill Papa too  
Sway down Mama  
Sway down low  
They gonna know me  
Wherever I go  
  
Into my bed  
With her kerosene  
My mama creep  
Set my flesh to burning  
Whilst I sleep  
I burn burn burn  
Till my soul burn black  
Black rains fall  
I come back I come back  
Get down Mama get down low  
They gonna know me  
Wherever I go  
  
16 witches cast 16 spells  
Make me guitar outta skin  
And human skull  
Sing you a song like the wind  
In the sandy loam  
Bring you baby  
Outcha your happy home  
  
Rams head forked tail  
Clove hoof loves my trail  
I sup on your body  
Sip on your blood like wine  
Out world theirs  
This world mine  
So kiss me baby  
Till it hurts  
God lost in heaven  
We lost on earth  
Sway down Mama  
Sway down low  
They gonna know me  
Wherever I go yeah  
Wherever I go yeah  
Wherever I go  
  
Well  
I got a brand new lover  
I love her yes I do  
Yeah shes my one and only  
And her name is Baby Blue  
Now baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby blue  
Thats right  
Whoah ha  
Well now baby baby baby  
Baby baby blue
