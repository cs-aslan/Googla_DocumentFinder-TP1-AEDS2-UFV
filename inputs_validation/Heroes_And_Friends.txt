I aint live forever but Ive lived enough  
And Ive learned to be gentle and Ive learned to be tough  
Ive found only two things that last to the end  
One is your heroes and the other your friends  
  
Your heroes will help you find good in yourself  
Your friends wont forsake you for somebody else  
Theyll both stand beside you through thick and through thin  
And thats how it goes with heroes and friends  
  
I grew up with cowboys I watched on tv  
My friends and I sometimes pretended to be  
Years have gone by but now and again  
My heart rides the range with my heroes and friends  
  
Your heroes will help you find good in yourself  
Your friends wont forsake you for somebody else  
Theyll both stand beside you through thick and through thin  
And thats how it goes with heroes and friends  
  
Your heroes will help you find good in yourself  
Your friends wont forsake you for somebody else  
Theyll both stand beside you through thick and through thin  
And thats how it goes with heroes and friends  
  
Thats how it goes with heroes and friends
