So they ask me  
Young boy  
What you gonna do the second time around  
How you goin come back

This is Tha Carter Two people  
This is Tha Carter Two people hey  
  
They call me Mr Carter I kissed the daughter  
Of the deads forehead I killed the father  
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater  
I will put them body on chill like glaciers  
Gracias Im crazy yes its obvious  
Going against me is atheist  
I got my angels on my shoulders and a quarter of that angel dust  
I aint sniffin Im just pitchin ya honor I aint snitchin ya honor  
Hate bitch niggas bitches with power  
Vacate when the kitchen get hotter  
I just sit on the counter open the cabinet close the cupboard  
Put that jar in the skillet drop a four in the bubbles  
I remember being young tryin to hustle my dough  
Tryin to tell the old junkies that my crack aint soap  
Tryin to tell you fool you chump that my mack aint broke  
You aint tryin to see how far that black back lane go  
No call me Pacman you ghosts is blue  
I got my red river rubies and my oceans blue  
Jewelry usually Im a hooligan for the money  
Yeah Im eatin but I got a tapeworm in my tummy oh  
Make harm in the bomb you in public  
Hit you with the straight arm no warning nothin  
Look its mornin no yawnin or nothin  
I aint sleepin Im up tryin to take a nigga lunch  
You gon make a nigga break a nigga fronts  
Then shake a nigga shorts and we takin what we want  
Im so 504 you got to kill me here  
If you ever lookin for me bitch I will be here  
Cash Money is an army Navy Seal me here  
Lot of niggas ran from it but Ill still be here  
No chrome on the continental Im so fundamental  
Crack the phill crack the roof and roll up the window  
And my hood love me they tell me bring it home  
Thats why I holla Hollygrove on each and every song  
You leapin at a dog a dog wit no bark  
Just a bite like an old shark  
And all you bitch niggas no paw  
Im talkin bout stunna  
He like keep ya door he got ya whole winters  
Sunshines on the king and sets on the prince  
I met the Birdman and I been shinin ever since like that that that that
