Oh my God I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee  
And I detest all my sins  
Because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell  
But most of all because I love Thee  
And I want so badly to be good  
  
Its so hypnotic  
The way he pulls on me  
Its like the force of gravity  
Right up under my feet  
Its so erotic  
This feeling cant be beat  
Its coursing through my whole body  
Feel the heat  
  
I got that burnin hot desiiire  
And no one can put out my fiiire  
Its coming right down through the wiiire  
Here it comes  
When I hear them eight o eight drums  
Its got me singing  
  
Hey ey ey ey  
Like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
Im like hey ey ey ey  
Like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
  
Girls they just wanna have some fun  
Get fired up like smokin gun  
On the floor til the daylight comes  
Girls they just wanna have some fun  
  
A girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
Im like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
  
The room is spinning  
It must be the tanqueray  
Im about to go astray  
My inhibitions gone away  
I feel like sinning  
You got me in the zone  
DJ play my favorite song  
Turn me on  
  
I got that burnin hot desiiire  
And no one can put out my fiiire  
Its coming right down through the wiiire  
Here it comes  
When I hear them 808 drums  
Its got me singing  
  
Hey ey ey ey  
Like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
Im like hey ey ey ey  
Like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
  
Girls they just wanna have some fun  
Get fired up like smokin gun  
On the floor til the daylight comes  
Girls they just wanna have some fun  
  
I know I know I know  
I shouldnt act this way  
I know I know I know  
Good girls dont misbehave  
Misbehave  
But im a bad girl anyway  
Forgive me  
  
Hey ey ey ey  
Like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
Im like hey ey ey ey  
Like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
  
Girls they just wanna have some fun  
Get fired up like smokin gun  
On the floor til the daylight comes  
Girls they just wanna have some fun  
  
A girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
Im like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild
