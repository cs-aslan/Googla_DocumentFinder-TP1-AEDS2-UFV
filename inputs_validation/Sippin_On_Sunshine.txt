Boy you get me so high  
Buzzin like a beehive  
Its just a little kiss  
But when It hits my lips  
Im sippin on sunshine  
Boy youre looking so fly  
Hotter than July  
I just wanna stay  
Forever and today  
Sippin on sunshine  
  
Down at the beach you holding my hand  
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand  
Watching the waves crash into the shore  
Baby I want some more  
  
Hey  
What a beautiful day  
All I need is a taste  
Nothin but a good time  
Sippin on sunshine  
No dont got nowhere to go  
So well go with the flow  
Yeah were living the life  
Sippin on sunshine  
  
Sippin on sunshine  
  
Boy you blow my mind  
You got me up on cloud nine  
Just a little taste  
I wouldnt wanna waste  
A sip of that sunshine  
  
We can kick it all night  
Underneath the moonlight  
But when the party ends  
Well do it all again  
Sippin on sunshine  
  
Down at the beach you holding my hand  
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand  
Watching the waves crash into the shore  
Baby I want some more

What a beautiful day  
All I need is a taste  
Nothin but a good time  
Sippin on sunshine
