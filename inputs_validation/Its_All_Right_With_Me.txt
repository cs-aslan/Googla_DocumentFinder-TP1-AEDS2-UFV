Its the wrong time  
And the wrong place  
Though your face  
Is charming  
Its the wrong face  
Its not her face  
But such  
A charming face  
That its  
All right with me  
  
Its the wrong song  
In the wrong style  
Though your smile  
Is lovely  
Its the wrong smile  
Its not her smile  
But such  
A lovely smile  
That its  
All right with me  
  
You cant know  
How happy  
I am that we met  
Im strangely  
Attracted to you  
Theres someone  
Im trying  
So hard to forget  
Dont you want  
To forget someone  
Too  
  
Its the wrong game  
With the wrong chips  
Though your lips  
Are tempting  
Theyre the wrong lips  
Theyre not her lips  
But theyre  
Such tempting lips  
That if some night  
You are free  
Then its all right  
Yes  
Its  
All right with me
