Well my babys wearin a permanent smile  
A satisfied look I aint seen for awhile  
I aint had no rings fulfilled any dreams  
But somethins come over my baby it seems  
  
Ive got a funny feeling somebodys stealin my honey  
Lord I love that child love to see her smile  
But these circumstances aint funny  
Where lies a danger is he a stranger or a pal  
Ive got a funny feeling somebodys stealing my gal  
  
If I came home early lord what would I find  
Maybe Id rather just walk around blind  
I know baby loves me lord I understand  
I love how emotions can get out of hand  
  
Ive got a funny feeling somebodys stealin my honey  
Lord I love that child love to see her smile  
But these circumstances aint funny  
Where lies a danger is he a stranger or a pal  
Ive got a funny feeling somebodys stealing my gal  
  
Wherever he is well Im callin his bluff  
Im gonna start wearin that good smellin stuff  
And Ill be the lover that I used to be  
Whatever shes missin shell get it from me  
  
Ive got a funny feeling somebodys stealin my honey  
Lord I love that child love to see her smile  
But these circumstances aint funny  
Where lies a danger is he a stranger or a pal  
Ive got a funny feeling somebodys stealing my gal  
  
Ive got a funny feeling somebodys stealin my gal
