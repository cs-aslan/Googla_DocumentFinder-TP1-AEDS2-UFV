Its wonderful to look into your eyes  
And realize you care a little bit  
Its wonderful to know that you love me babe  
  
Its glorious to feel that  
Im a part of you sweetheart  
To share your happiness  
Its marvelous how lovely love can be  
  
Who dreamed that Id be allowed  
Through the doorway of Heaven  
Im drifting high on a cloud  
Youre an angel and this is Heaven mama  
  
Its wonderful to have  
Your lips divine combined with mine  
And dream forever more  
Its wonderful to know that you love me  
Oh babe you love me too
