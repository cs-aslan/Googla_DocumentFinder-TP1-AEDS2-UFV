Theres coming a day when the world shall melt away  
And Jesus shall come to claim his own  
No more tears no pain  
No woe in this wicked world below  
Then will you be ready to go home  
Will you be ready to go ready to go home  
To live with him up there round the throne  
When he says come unto me will your soul be claim and free  
Then will you be ready to go home  
  
In this world of greed and hate will you wait till its too late  
Too late to claim the Saviour for your own  
For hes coming someday to bear your soul away  
Then will you be ready to go home  
Will you be ready to go  
Then will you be ready to go home
