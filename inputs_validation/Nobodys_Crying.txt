He jumps in a taxi hands for the sky  
Hes off to slay some demon or dragonfly  
Hes lookin at me that long last time  
Ill turn away again and I wave goodbye  
In an envelope inside his coat  
Is a chain I wore around my throat  
Along with a note I wrote  
Said I love you but I dont even know why  
  
But darling I wish you well  
On your way to the wishing well  
Swinging off those gates of hell  
And I can tell how hard youre trying  
And just have our secret hope  
Sometimes all we do is cope  
Somewhere on the steepest slope  
Therell be an endless rope  
And nobodys crying  
  
Well a couple of long nights turn into a a couple long years  
Of me walkin walkin around around this trail of tears  
Where the very loud voices of my own fears  
Is ringin and ringin in my ears  
It says that love is long gone  
Every move I make is all wrong  
Says you never gave a damn for me  
  
For anything for anyone  
  
But darling I wish you well  
On your way to the wishing well  
Swinging off those gates of hell  
And I can tell how hard youre trying  
And just have our secret hope  
Sometimes all we do is cope  
Somewhere on the steepest slope  
Therell be an endless rope  
And nobodys crying  
  
May you dream you are sleepin in a warm soft bed  
And may the voices inside you that fill you with dread  
Turn the sound of thousands of angels instead  
Tonight where you might be laying your head  
  
I wish you well  
On your way to the wishing well  
Swinging off of those gates of hell  
And I can tell how hard youre trying  
And Just have our secret hope  
Sometimes all I do is cope  
Somewhere on the steepest slope  
Therell be an endless rope  
And nobodys crying  
And nobodys crying
