Ive got a photograph  
I took a picture of you  
I took your picture in front of my favorite view  
  
You play the part so well  
You look so sure and free  
No one could ever tell that you belong to me  
  
And cause you lie so well  
Ive got to pin you down  
Under lock and key  
So you will always be in my collection  
  
If you cant speak you cant lie  
If you cant run you cant hide  
I know a place you cant die  
So no one lives inside  
My collection  
  
I want to capture you  
I want to immortalize  
The way you play with your hair  
The way you flash your eyes  
  
I taste the air you breathe  
I taste the food you eat  
I keep your nails and hair  
And some of the clothes you wear  
  
If you cant speak you cant lie  
If you cant run you cant hide  
And if youre dead you cant die  
So no one lives inside  
No one lives inside my collection  
  
Ive got some photographs  
Id like to show them to you  
Though you dont know the girls  
Youll recognize the view
