Good morning beautiful how was your night  
Mine was wonderful with you by my side  
And when I open my eyes and see your sweet face  
Its a good morning beautiful day  
  
I couldnt see the light I didnt know  
Day from night I had no reason to care  
But since you came along I can face the dawn  
Cause I know youll be there  
  
Good morning beautiful how was your night  
Mine was wonderful with you by my side  
And when I open my eyes and see your sweet face  
Its a good morning beautiful day  
  
Ill never worry if its raining outside  
Cause in here with you girl the sun always shines  
  
Good morning beautiful how was your night  
Mine was wonderful with you by my side  
And when I open my eyes and see your sweet face  
Its a good morning beautiful day yeah  
  
A good morning beautiful day  
  
Good morning beautiful a beautiful day  
Good morning beautiful good morning beautiful  
A beautiful day good morning beautiful day  
A beautiful day good morning beautiful
