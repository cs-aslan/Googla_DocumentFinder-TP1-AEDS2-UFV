Its just a theory  
Theres a possibility I am wrong  
Its just a theory  
But I would stake my life  
Lay my money down  
That you were meant for me  
And for you Im the one  
  
Its just a theory  
A particular set of assumptions  
Its just a theory  
An educated guess  
A conclusion not forgone  
That you were meant for me  
And for you Im the one  
  
Oh nothings new under the sun  
I will postulate  
Ask for your consideration  
Ask you out on a date  
Although it cant be sure  
Why not act on a hunch  
Oh why not search for proof  
Why not go out for lunch  
And in theory I could propose  
And in theory you could affirm  
Oh that you were meant for me  
And for you Im the one  
Oh that you were meant for me  
And for you Im the one  
  
Its just a theory  
A series of tests should be run  
Its just a theory although not fully assessed  
An idea whose time has come  
That you were meant for me  
And for you Im the one  
That you were meant for me  
And for you Im the one
