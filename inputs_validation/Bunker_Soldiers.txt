Trained bodies in coordination  
Is that a better way for bunker soldiers  
But its a nicer way to spend a war  
On lava beaches and sandy seaside  
The rusting bodies are surplus now then  
We never taught them how to fight like that  
The objects exercise is so compulsive  
Its not a better way but it still suits us  
Id give up rice fields to fight like you

Its not a better way  
Though we are here to stay  
Well that might seem ok  
  
Waves of people  
In strange directions  
Its no use talking  
Theres no decisions  
They gave up houses to be refugees  
The mud in ditches is over their knees  
The sand bagged trenches are over our heads  
This kind of warfares become hide and seek  
Though khaki uniforms are universal  
Your propaganda is losing appeal  
Id give up rice fields to fight like you  
Id give up rice fields to fight like you
