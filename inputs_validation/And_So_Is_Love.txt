And you ah You do ah

And in the end whats it all about  
It must be love

We used to say Ah Hell were young  
But now we see that life is sad And so is love  
Ooh baby live your life for love

We used to say Ah Hell were young  
But now we see that life is sad And so is love  
Ooh baby for the sake of love

And whatever happens what really matters  
Its all weve got isnt that enough  
Life is sad and so is love

Just for the sake of love

You set me free I set you free  
Life is sad and so is love
