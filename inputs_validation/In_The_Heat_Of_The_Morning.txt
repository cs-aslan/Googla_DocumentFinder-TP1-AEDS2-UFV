The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize  
Every man who looks your way  
I watched them sink before your gaze  
Seniorita sway  
Dance with me before their frozen eyes  
Im so much in love  
Like a little soldier catching butterflies  
No man loved like I love you  
Wouldnt you like to love me too  
In the heat of the morning  
In the shadow Ill clip your wings  
And Ill tell you I love you  
In the heat of the morning  
Ill tie a knot in rainbows end organise the breeze  
Light my candle from the sun  
Ill give you daylight for a friend  
Ill do all of these  
Ill prove that it can be done oh Im so much in love  
Like the ragged boy who races with the wind  
No man loved like I love you  
Wouldnt you like to love me too  
In the heat of the morning  
In the shadow Ill clip your wings  
And Ill tell you I love you  
In the heat of the morning  
In the heat of the morning  
In the shadow Ill clip your wings  
And Ill tell you I love you  
In the heat of the morning  
Oh yeah all day all the way  
Ooh
