By The Hourglass  
  
Waiting in the rain at the station  
Standing by the train  
Looks like youre comin home to stay  
Its been quite a while since youve seen him  
Now inside you smile against the rain  
Cause you still feel the same  
  
But youre gonna cry and search for the reason why  
Carry your pain and youll finally go insane  
Uh cause you baby  
Whoa you been gone much too long  
  
You cant believe theres no one there to greet ya now  
You cant believe that no one cares  
To take your hand you want your man  
  
But youre gonna cry and search for the reason why  
Carry your pain and youll finally go insane  
Uh cause you baby  
Whoa you been gone much too long  
Yeah baby much too long  
Whoa much too long  
You went away a long time ago
