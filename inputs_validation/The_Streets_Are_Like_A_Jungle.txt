Hey yo The Streets Are Like A Jungle  
Im countin money in the jungle  
Hey yo The Streets Are Like A jungle  
Guns go off in the jungle  
  
I tip my derby like Zorro  
Aint no such things as war heroes  
Frontline planes fly by like the sparrow BLAOW  
My face hits the dirt flashbacks of Vietnam  
Remind me of the LA riots when it was on  
Fire hits the street neon lights are bright  
My tank cuts the corner enemies take flight Thats right  
Make no mistake you cant have this cake it took too long to bake  
and you cant carry this weight so move on  
These are the words of the elders  
Babysitters got caught with cocaine in a babys diapers  
Explain that in the form of a rap  
She got caught with vals ACRACKALACKALACK  
Now Im upset I get back to the projects  
First one I blast was a usual suspect a fiend  
In the alley named Ricky  
Talked to a Det rookie gave him the info  
About the paliquo and where he gotta go  
All he want in return is a Sony stereo  
  
Hey yo The Streets Are Like A Jungle  
Im countin money in the jungle  
Hey yo The Streets Are Like A jungle  
Guns go off in the jungle  
  
Hey yo my mind is my business so Im  
Minding my own in the club til this girl said  
Let me see your telephone  
I passed her my celly  
She called her girl Mary  
And said that she just broke up with her nigga out in DC  
She needs a new honey in the city she gets lonely  
I finally figured out her mans locked up in a penatentary  
So tell me what should I do when she gets off the phone  
The devil said Clef take her ass home  
God says Repect her her mans in the pen  
This kid pushed me from behind Yo why you fuckin with my woman  
Then his girl looked at me she winked I blinked  
Now hes coming up to me with the gorilla instinct  
Aww coolnshit Im sittin here eatin shrimp  
Besides I would hate for you to be a missing link  
He said Son do you know who I am Im no man but one man  
who The son of Sam  
I said youve got this wrong I never sung your girl a love song  
He drew for his weapon theres no more conversation  
CockCockCockCockCockCock He released  
then breathe His aim went off balance  
The music got tense  
Thats when I knew I was in trouble The street is like a jungle  
I jumped behind the bar but caught two in the ankle POW Echo
