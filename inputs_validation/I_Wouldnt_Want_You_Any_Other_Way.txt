I cant put my finger on this love of ours life with you keeps changing every
day  
One minute youre all sunshine and the next you turn to showers  
But I wouldnt want you any other way  
Ive been through your crazy moods so many times  
More than once Ive been the one who pays  
Oh but nothing really matters just as long as you are mine  
Cause I wouldnt want you any other way  
When you touch me when Im sleeping I wake up at heavens door  
And I kiss you on the pillow where you lay  
With your arms around me tightly I could ask for nothing more  
And I wouldnt want you any other way  
With your arms around me tightly
