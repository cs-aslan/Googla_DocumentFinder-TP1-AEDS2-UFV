You always making promises  
Who gets the blame for your mistakes  
You made a game of politics  
Now fear and guilt on your face  
  
But I cant feel your pain  
And I wont share your shame  
All I know is what I feel  
Music sets me free  
  
I dont mind walking in the rain  
Ooh tears of heaven soothe my pain  
Love is the sound that makes me sing  
I love to play a melody  
  
But you cant hear the sound  
But you cant you cant feel the beat  
All I know is what I feel  
Music sets me free  
  
I dont mind walking in the rain  
Ooh tears of heaven soothe my pain  
Love is the sound that makes me sing  
I love to play a melody  
  
But you cant hear the sound  
But you cant you cant feel the beat  
All I know is what I feel  
Music sets me free  
  
Two points of view  
Two points of view  
Two points of view  
One for me and one for you  
  
But you cant hear the sound  
But you cant you cant feel the beat  
All I know is what I feel  
Music sets me free  
  
Two points of view  
Two points of view  
Two points of view  
One for me and one for you  
  
Two points of view  
Two points of view
