Well they call you cradle baby  
They say youre too young  
Oh that yours is not real love  
Youre just havin fun  
Cause youre only sixteen  
And your life is not free  
Well they call you cradle baby  
But youre just right for me  
So when I need alovin and all of us do  
L know that Im a cookin Well Im a lookin for you  
Right back in the cradle  
They say you should be  
Well they call you cradle baby  
But youre just right for me  
  
Well they call you cradle baby  
Why dont they leave you alone  
They say your mama will worry  
If you dont hurry home  
Just apay no attention  
Cause its all there to see  
Well they call you cradle baby  
But youre just right for me
