Where the streets are paved with blood  
With cataclysmic overtones  
Fear and hate linger in the air  
A strictly nogo deadly zone  
I dont know what Im doing here  
Cause its not my scene at all  
Theres an A bomb in Wardour Street  
Theyve called in the Army theyve called in the police to  
  
Im stranded on the vortex floor  
My heads been kicked in and bloods started to pour  
Through the haze I can see my girl  
Fifteen geezers got her pinned to the door  
I try to reach her but fall back to the floor  
A bomb in Wardour Street  
Its blown up the West End now its spreading throughout the City  
  
A bomb in Wardour Street its blown up the City  
Now its spreading through the country  
  
Law and order take a turn for the worst  
In the shape of a size 10 boot  
Rape and murder throughout the land  
And they tell you that youre still a free man  
If this is freedom I dont understand  
Cause it seems like madness to me  
A bomb in Wardour Street Hate Bomb  
Hate Bomb Hate Bomb Hate Bomb  
  
A Phillistine nation of degradation  
And hate and war There must be more  
Its Doctor Martins APOseeALwhyPSE  
Apocalypse
