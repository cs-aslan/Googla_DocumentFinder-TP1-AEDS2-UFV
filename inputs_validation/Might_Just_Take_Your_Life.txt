I got more than I asked for  
There aint nothin I need  
I took all til I had more  
Im always takin the lead  
  
Old man shakin dice down on the street  
Tryn to make a livin somehow  
But Im really sure about gettin things sorted out  
And Im gettin ready right now  
  
You cant hold me  
I have told you  
Might just take your life  
Might just take your life  
  
Ive been called by many names  
And all of them are bad  
I can take it all the same  
Its all Ive ever had  
  
Ive got somethin that you cant get  
But one thing you can see  
Gettin there aint easy  
But it sure was hard for me  
  
You cant hold me  
I have told you  
Might just take your life  
Might just take your life  
  
Every time I take a look  
Theres someone close behind  
They never used to make a pass  
The things that crossed their minds  
  
Now they tell me that its all right  
And they want to be my friend  
Theyre ridin on my back  
When is it goin to end  
  
You cant hold me  
I have told you  
Might just take your life  
Might just take your life  
Might just take your life  
  
Got more than I asked for  
Got more than I need  
Got more than I asked for  
Got more than I need  
Got more than I asked for  
Got more than I need
