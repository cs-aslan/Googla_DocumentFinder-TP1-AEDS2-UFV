People say shes only in my head  
Its gonna take time but Ill forget  
They say I need to get on with my life  
But they dont realize  
  
Is when your dialing six numbers just to hang up the phone  
Driving cross town just to see if shes home  
Waking a friend in the dead of night just to hear em say its gonna be
alright  
When your finding things to do not to fall asleep  
Cause you know shell be there in your dreams  
Thats when shes  
More than a memory  
  
Took a match to everything she ever wrote  
Watched her words go up in smoke  
Tore all the pictures off the wall  
But that aint helping me at all  
  
Cause when your talking out loud and nobodys there  
You look like hell and you just dont care  
Drinking more than youve ever drank  
Sinking down lower than youve ever sank  
When you find yourself falling down upon your knees  
Praying to God begging him please  
Thats when shes  
More than a memory  
  
Shes more  
Shes more  
  
Cause when your dialing her number just to hang up the phone  
Driving cross town just to see if shes home  
Waking a friend in the dead of night just to hear em say its gonna be
alright  
When our finding things to do not to fall asleep  
Cause you know shell be waiting in your dreams  
Thats when shes  
More than a memory  
  
People say shes only in my head  
Its gonna take time but Ill forget
