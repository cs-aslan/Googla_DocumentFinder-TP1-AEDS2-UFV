Somewhere between psychotic and iconic  
Somewhere between I want it and I got it  
Somewhere between Im sober and Im lifted  
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment  
But I stay down girl I always stay down  
Get down have her lay down  
Promise to break everybody off before I break down  
Everyone just wait now  
So much on my plate now  
People I believed in they dont even show they face now  
What they got to say now  
Nothin they can say now  
Nothin really changed but still they look at me a way now  
What more can I say now  
What more can I say now  
You might feel like nothin was the same  
  
I still been drinkin on the low  
Mobbin on the low  
Fuckin on the low  
Smokin on the low  
I still been plottin on the low  
Schemin on the low  
The furthest thing from perfect  
Like everyone I know  
  
I just been drinkin on the low  
Mobbin on the low  
Fuckin on the low  
Smokin on the low  
I just been plottin on the low  
Schemin on the low  
The furthest thing from perfect  
Like everyone I know  
  
And I hate that you dont think I belong to ya  
Just too busy runnin shit to run home to ya  
You know that paper my passion  
Bittersweet celebrations I know I cant change what happened  
I cant help it  
I cant help it  
I was young and I was selfish  
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one elses  
And now you hate me  
Stop pretendin stop that frontin  
I cant take it  
Girl dont treat me like a stranger  
Girl you know I seen ya naked  
Girl you know that I remember dont be a pretender  
Gettin high at the condo thats when it all comes together  
You know I stay remniscin  
And makeup sex is tradition  
But you been missin girl  
And you might feel like nothin was the same  
  
I still been drinkin on the low  
Mobbin on the low  
Fuckin on the low  
Smokin on the low  
I still been plottin on the low  
Schemin on the low  
The furthest thing from perfect  
Like everyone I know  
  
I just been drinkin on the low  
Mobbin on the low  
Fuckin on the low  
Smokin on the low  
I just been plottin on the low  
Schemin on the low  
The furthest thing from perfect  
Like everyone I know  
  
Drinkin smokin fuckin plottin  
Schemin plottin schemin gettin money  
Drinkin fuckin smokin plottin schemin  
Plottin schemin getting money  
  
This the life for me  
My mama told me this was right for me  
I got em worried like make sure you save a slice for me  
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me  
Your actions make us doubt you  
Your lack of effort got me rapping different  
This the shit I wanna go out to  
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin  
Naked women swimming thats just how Im living  
Donate a million to some children thats just how Im feeling  
A nigga filling up arenas who the fuck can see us  
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the reup  
Yours truly the boy  
I just build and build more  
Yall niggas build and destroy  
You niggas party too much man I just chill and record  
No filler you feel it now if you aint feel it before  
Yes Lord this the shit I wanna go out to yeah  
This the shit I wanna go out to
