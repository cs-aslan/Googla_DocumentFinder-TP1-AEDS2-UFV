Its a holiday  
Spend it with you baby  
I think that I am in love this Christmas yeah  
Just hang your stockings on the fireplace  
You know that Santas coming to town  
Im the one who wants to take you on a sleigh right now  
  
So today is all about you babe  
The mistletoe can pull us closer  
Its what Im waiting for  
It sorta feels like its Valentines Valentines  
  
So in on top of your roof  
Them sleigh bells is ringing  
Ill be up all night with you
