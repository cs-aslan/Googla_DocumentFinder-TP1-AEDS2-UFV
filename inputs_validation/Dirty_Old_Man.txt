Chorus  
Im a dirty old man  
I do what I can  
Tryin to make a livin  
Im a dirty old man  
  
I like to get hammered  
On Friday night  
Sometimes I cant wait  
So Mondays alright  
  
Its a battle with the bottle  
Ill win it alright  
But I lost another round  
In the bar last night  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah Im gonna get fired  
For drinkin on the job  
Got caught with the bosss wife  
In the parking lot  
  
Im gonna get killed  
For doin this again  
But I just cant help it  
Its under my skin  
  
Im a dirty old man  
I do what I can  
Im gonna get hammered  
And do it again  
  
Chorus  
  
Got a bag of frozen peas  
I use on my knees  
I injured from beggin  
And tryin to please  
  
If you believe that  
Im losing my fat  
Got a workout program  
And a new rubber mat  
  
Chorus  
  
Im a dirty old man
