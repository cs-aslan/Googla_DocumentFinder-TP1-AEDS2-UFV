I know its on your heart  
That a love like ours shall never fall apart  
Youre so afraid of the rain  
So Ill take your hand  
And Ill love you in the best way that I can  
And I only expect the same  
  
Chorus  
Dont promise me forever  
Dont promise me the sun and sky  
Dont pretend to know youll never make me cry  
Just hold me now  
And promise me youll try  
  
Though Im sure of what I feel  
Never though a love so true that felt so unreal  
And Im a little afraid myself  
But if you love me day by day  
With all honest heart and a little faith  
Baby time will tell the tale  
  
Chorus x2
