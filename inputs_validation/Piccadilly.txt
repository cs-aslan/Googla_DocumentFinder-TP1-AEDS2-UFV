Shes not a picture above somebodys fire  
She sits in a towel with a purple hair dryer  
She waits to get even with me  
She hooks up her cupcakes and puts on her jumper  
Explains that shell be late to a worrying mother  
She meets me in Piccadilly  
A begging folk singer stands tall by the entrance  
His song relays worlds of most good intentions  
A fiver a ten p in his hat for collection  
  
She talks about office she talks about dresses  
Shes seen one she fancies her smile is impressing  
So maybe Ill treat her someday  
We queue among strangers and strange conversation  
Loves on the lips of all forms of engagements  
All queuing to see tonights play  
  
A man behind me talks to his young lady  
Hes happy that she is expecting his baby  
His wife wont be pleased but shes not been round lately  
  
The girl was so dreadful we left in a hurry  
We escaped in the rain for an Indian curry  
At the candle lit Taj Mahal  
My lips to a napkin I called for a taxi  
The invite of eyes made it tense but relaxed me  
My mind took a devious role  
  
The cab took us home through a night Id not noticed  
The neon club lights of adult films and Trini Lopez  
My arm around love but my acting was hopeless  
  
We crept like two thieves from the kettle to the fire  
We kissed to the sound of the silence that wed hired  
Now captured your love in my arms  
A door opened slightly a voice spoke in worry  
Mum went to bed without wind of the curry  
Our secret love made its advance  
  
Like Adam and Eve we took bite on the apple  
Loose change in my pocket it started to rattle  
Heart like a gun was just half of the battle
