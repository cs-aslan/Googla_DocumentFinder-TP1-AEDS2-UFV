I been gettin lonely too much these days  
I been gettin lonely I guess I better get away  
But where can I go thats real lifes a stage on a ferris wheel  
And the actors are all fighting just to see who gets the lead in the play  
  
Oh no no  
I gotta find me a better day  
  
Talk about down I feel so lonely  
Talk about down Im startin to worry  
Dont really want to be all alone I cant get along with the chicks at home  
The world just dont seem right my head is spinnin and I hate whats goin
down  
You gotta find me a better day  
  
Oh gotta find me a better day  
Gotta find me a better day  
You gotta find me a better day  
Gotta find me a better day  
Gotta find me a better day  
Gotta find me a better day  
You gotta find me a better day  
Gotta find me a better day  
Gotta find gotta find  
Gotta find me a better day  
Gotta find gotta find  
Gotta find  
Gotta find me a better day  
Gotta find me a better day  
Gotta find me a better day  
Gotta find me a better day  
Gotta find me a better day  
repeat to fade
