Walking around with your head in the clouds  
You dont care  
Why must you walk when you know  
Youre not going anywhere  
  
Chorus  
Why dont you come out of your dream world  
Its not real  
Its not the way it seems to be  
Why dont you come into the real world  
Come with me  
Well share our thoughts forget the dreams  
Youll see  
  
Always pretending that everythings fine  
When its not  
Why must you lie when you know that  
Youll always get caught  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Youll see  
Youll see
