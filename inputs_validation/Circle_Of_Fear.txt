Heartache is knocking on her door  
Shadows dance outside her window  
Tears keep falling on the floor  
As the world around her crumbles  
  
If you want to save her  
First you have to save yourself  
If you want to free her from the hurt  
Dont do it with your pain  
If you want to see her smile again  
Dont show her youre afraid  
Because your circle of fear is the same  
  
Love can be as cold as grave  
A oneway ticket to endless sorrow  
An empire of gentle hate  
Today without tomorrow  
  
Its the circle of regret  
The circle of hate  
The circle of death  
Your circle of fear is the same
