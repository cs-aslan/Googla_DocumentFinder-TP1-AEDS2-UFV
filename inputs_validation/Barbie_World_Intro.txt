Chorus  
I wanna get to know you  
I really wanna fuck you baby  
One dose of my lovin  
Im simply going to drive you crazy  
  
I wanna be your lover  
I wanna get to know you baby  
One dose of my lovin  
Im really gonna drive you crazy  
  
Young Buc  
Im lovin how you look in my eyes  
Swingin them hips when you pass  
Im visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby  
Jump on this Harley  
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley  
Sip some Bacardi  
Then go pull up at the afterparty  
I think we make a perfect couple  
But you think Im trouble  
Maybe thats the reason you gave me the wrong number  
She got me feeling like maybe she the wrong woman  
Think Ima be chasin the chicken head you own somethin  
Your toes painted hair fixed all the time  
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine  
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you  
I betcha I have you doin what you said that you wont do  
Making decisions shorty good things dont last long  
Your girlfriend keep showin me that thong  
Before I head home  
Ima stop at your house and blow the horn  
If you come outside you know its on holla at your boy  
  
Chorus  
  
Lloyd Banks  
Bitches be frustrated with the baller  
Wonder why I dont call her  
Maybe because Im busy and she needs someone to spoil her  
It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her  
In order to let her know well be friends and nothing more  
She loves it when Im in town  
Hate it when Im not around  
I get her and wear down  
Next door neighbors hear the sound  
Pictures hittin the ground  
Just enough to hold us down  
Im stickin n moving cruising after the third round  
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy  
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady  
I admit I fell in love with her frame  
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name  
Her panties wet over fame  
Fall in love with my chain  
I wonder if I wasnt an entertainer would she remain  
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only  
Im not your boyfriend Im your homie  
  
Chorus  
  
50 Cent  
Yeah What would fuck me up more  
Watching her lick her lips  
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips yeah man  
I sweet talking her if she like  
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right  
Look Im legit now used to break laws  
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours  
Big house big Benz girl it yours  
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws  
You aint go to look like a model for me to adore you  
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal  
Dont Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you  
Cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you  
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me  
Put my tounge on you you put your tounge on me  
Let me ride on you and you can ride on  
We can do it all the night  
We can have a balla tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
I wanna get to know you  
I wanna get to know you baby  
One dose of my lovin  
Im simply gonna drive you crazy  
  
I wanna be your lover  
I wanna get to know you lady  
One dose of my lovin  
Im really gonna drive you crazy  
  
X2  
I wanna be your lover  
I really understand you baby  
I want to be your lover  
I really understand you baby baby baby baby
