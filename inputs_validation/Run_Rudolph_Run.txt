Out of all the reindeer you know youre the mastermind  
Run run Rudolph Randalphs not too far behind  
Run run Rudolph Santas got to make it to town  
Randalph he can hurry he can take the freeway down  
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a merrygoround  
Said Santa to a boy child What have you been longing for  
All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar  
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a shooting star  
Run run Rudolph Santas got to make it to town  
Cant you make him hurry tell him he can take the freeway down  
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a merrygoround  
Said Santa to a girl child What would you like most to get  
I want a little baby doll that can cry scream and wet  
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a Saber jet  
Run run Rudolph run run Rudolph a running like a sonofagun
