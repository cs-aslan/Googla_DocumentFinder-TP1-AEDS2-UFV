The bells are ringin for me and my gal  
Birds are singin for me and my gal  
Everybodys been knowin to a weddin theyre goin  
And for weeks theyve been sewin every Susie and Sal  
  
Theyre congregatin bathin waitin  
For me an my gal  
The Parsons waitin  
For me and my gal  
  
An sometime were gonna build a little home  
For two or three or four or more  
In Loveland for me and my gal
