Im a lucky son of a gun I cant believe that its true  
That this lucky son of a gun found somebody like you  
  
I think you must know the man in the moon Up in the heavens so blue  
Because I think you fell from heaven Im talking to the moon about you  
I think he must know the reason you fell Ive got an idea he knew  
And even though I know hell never tell Im just talking to the moon about
you  
  
He may be saw the angels take a rainbow from the skies and make  
A beautiful someone especially for me I felt like a Romeo too  
And thats the very reason why you see me just talking to the moon about you  
  
I want to find out if youre a good cook and various things that you do  
You got me going crazy honey lamb Im just talking to the moon about you  
Its heaven to look right into your eyes the feeling is something so new  
I think Im down to earth then realise Im just talking to the moon about
you  
  
I wish I knew if Id a chance to marry you and find romance  
Id love to find out how homely you are and if youd share a cottage for two  
Or if youre just a lovely fallen star if thats the case its right  
To go on every night just talking to the moon about you
