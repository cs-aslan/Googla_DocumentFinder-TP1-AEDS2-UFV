While Im far away from you my baby  
I know its hard for you my baby  
Because its hard for me my baby  
And the darkest hour is just before dawn  
  
Each night before you go to bed my baby  
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby  
And tell all the stars above  
This is dedicated to the one I love  
  
Love can never be exactly like we want it to be  
I could be satisfied knowing you love me  
Theres one thing I want you to do especially for me  
And its something that everybody needs  
  
While Im far away from you my baby  
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby  
Because its hard for me my baby  
And the darkest hour is just before dawn  
  
If theres one thing I want you to do especially for me  
Then its something that everybody needs  
  
Each night before you go to bed my baby  
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby  
And tell all the stars above  
This is dedicated to the one I love  
This is dedicated to the one I love  
This is dedicated to the one I love  
This is dedicated to the one I love  
This is dedicated
