Operatin under the crooked american system too long  
Outkast pronounced out cast  
Adjective meaning homeless or unaccepted in society  
But lets look deeper than that  
Are you an outkast  
If you understand and feel the basic principles and  
Fundamental truths contained within this muzik you probably are  
If you think its all about pimpin hoes and slammin cadillac dos  
You probably a cracker or a nigga that think he a cracker  
Or maybe just dont understand  
An outkast is someone who is not considered to be part of the normal world  
He is looked at differently  
He is not accepted because of his clothes his hair  
His occupation his beliefs or his skin color  
Now look at yourself are you an outkast I know I am  
As a matter of fact fuck being anything else  
Its only so much time left in this crazy world  
Wake up niggaz and realize whats goin on around you  
Poisonin of the food and water  
Tamperin of ciggarettes  
Disease engineering control over your life  
Take back your existance or die like a punk  
This is big rube sayin right on to the real and death to the fakers  
Peace out
