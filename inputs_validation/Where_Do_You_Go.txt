Where do you go when theres nowhere to go  
And you dont want to be where you are  
Where do you run when theres no run to run and youve already run too far  
What good is love when you offer your love but nobody wants to buy  
Why do I cry and why am I wondering why  
What can you say when theres so much to say but nobody listens to you  
And what good are dreams if theres no more than dreams  
That dont have a chance to come true  
And what can you do when love that you do will ease your troubled mind  
And where do you go when you come to the end of the line  
What can you say
