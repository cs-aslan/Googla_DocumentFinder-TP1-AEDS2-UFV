Tonight I waited but my heart is so cold  
Cause you never stay more than a minute so Im told  
I know youre just doing your job  
But what am I supposed to do  
When all I want for Christmas darling is to be with you  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
But when I offer you some Christmas greetings  
You just keep on walking yeah  
Im not asking for a miracle just a night  
And if you just look in my eyes you just might  
Therell be no other woman wholl treat you like I can  
Come on over here  
Ill be your loving darling youll be my loving man  
Oh I watch you shimmy down the chimney baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
But when I offer you some Christmas greetings  
You just keep on walking  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
But when I offer you some Christmas greetings  
You just keep on walking  
Keep on walking  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney baby  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney baby  
You just keep on walking  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney baby
