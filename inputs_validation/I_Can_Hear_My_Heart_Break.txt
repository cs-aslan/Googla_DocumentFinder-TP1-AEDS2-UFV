Im surrounded by silence tormented by dreams  
Tortured by sweet words that you didnt mean  
Its the stillness its the silence that I can hardly take  
For I can hear I can hear my heart break  
  
Now these arms are mighty lonesome guess theyre missing you  
And I have to admit it honey I miss you too  
I sit here in the silence half asleep half awake  
And I can hear I can hear my heart break  
  
Empty days without number lonely nights I cant bear  
That old worlds gone right on by me whos to know whos to care  
I keep listening for your footsteps little sound you used to make  
And I can hear I can hear my heart break  
  
My heart break
