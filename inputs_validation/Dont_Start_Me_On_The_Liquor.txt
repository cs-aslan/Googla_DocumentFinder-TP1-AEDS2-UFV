Dont start me on the liquor  
Ill drink it all down straight  
Ill make a toast to love  
But I drink the most  
  
When I got somebody to hate  
Im an old man  
I got an old mans pain  
Will the morning  
  
Will the morning ever come again  
Well Im likin lickin a lotta liquor  
Im drivin down the drink  
Ill take a toast to life  
  
But I drink the most  
When my devil start to think  
Im an old man  
I got an old mans pain  
  
Will the morning  
Will the morning ever come again  
Oh I could drink drink drink  
So I cant think think think  
  
I got a hope or a home  
In this life Im all alone  
On this long cold lonely night of fright  
Followed by a lonely day  
  
Til theres nothing left I can say  
Except I didnt know I was sick  
And so I got sicker  
Hes a low down lying  
  
Peckerwood cotton picker  
Dont start me on the liquor  
I got nothing more to say  
I had a little money  
  
But it all flown away  
And I said oh man  
Oh aint that a shame  
Oh I keep manin I keep manin  
  
Like I got an old mans pain  
Dont  
Dont start  
Dont start me  
  
Dont start me on  
Dont start me on the  
Dont start me on the liquor
