My fathers name was Hannibal Mama was HannaMariah  
Everything we owned got all burned up in the great depression fire  
Strip mines and one crop farming drained the green earth dry  
We lost it all only love was left and that was the one thing money cant buy  
  
Were all dust bowl children  
Singin a dust bowl song  
And the crops wont grow  
And the dust just blows  
When the green fields are gone  
When the green grass growing fields are gone  
When the green fields are gone  
When the green grass growing fields are gone  
  
Well they said in California there was work of every kind  
The only work that I got out there was waiting on a welfare line  
Once I had a dollar once I had a dream  
But now all the work is being done by a big ol machine  
  
Were all dust bowl children  
Singin the dust bowl song  
And the crops wont grow  
And the dust just blows  
When the green fields are gone  
When the green grass growing fields are gone  
When the green fields are gone  
When the green grass growing fields are gone
