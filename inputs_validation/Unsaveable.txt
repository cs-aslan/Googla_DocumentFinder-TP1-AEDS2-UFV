Love  
So cruel  
Yeah thats all that I got from you  
Tell me what in the world could I do  
But leave  
After all that youve done to me  
Now its so easy to say Im over you  
  
Chorus  
Cause Baby I cried a little too hard  
A little too long  
What I thought was right  
Was way too wrong  
And too far gone  
I cant bring back the love  
There just aint enough  
Available  
Impossible  
Unsaveable  
  
Here  
You come  
Tryin to make up for what youve done  
Its too late to say youre sorry now  
Now its your turn  
For you cant cross that bridge you burned  
Youre on you own when will you learn  
  
Chorus  
  
Love  
Theres someone out there for me  
Who thinks Im beautiful  
Ive got to go  
  
Chorus
