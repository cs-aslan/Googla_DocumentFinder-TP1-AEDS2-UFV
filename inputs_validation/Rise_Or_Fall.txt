Take action  
Gotta raise a fist in blood  
Domination  
Cant continue acting like jerks  
You show me all theres a chance  
With only words for defence  
There is no freedom to speak no  
Rise or fall  
Number one to take the stand  
Rise or fall  
Take a word from this promised land  
Yeah  
Your reaction  
Sticks and stones are no match for steel  
This rebellion  
Revolutions in your hands  
Now listen  
So its part Apache  
Do you know what that means  
Is it a segregation  
Rise or fall  
Number one to take the stand  
Rise or fall  
Take a word from this promised land  
Strength in numbers can alter your place  
Take the action before its too late  
Make a stand  
Give it up  
Rise or fall  
Number one to take the stand  
Rise or fall  
Take a word from this promised land  
Rise or fall  
Number one to take the stand  
Rise or fall  
Take a word  
Take a word from this land  
Rise or fall  
Rise or fall
