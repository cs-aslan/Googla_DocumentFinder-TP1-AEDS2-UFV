I aint got  
Nothing to be scared of  
No I aint got  
Nothing to be scared of  
No I aint got  
Anything to be scared of  
Cos I love you  
  
I was born out of love  
Its the only way to come into this world  
I know Im not all there  
But Im getting getting getting there  
If you let me live my life  
Ill stay with you to the end  
And I know lord  
Im nearly there  
I want to tell you this  
  
I aint got  
Nothing to be scared of no  
No I aint got  
Nothing to be scared of no  
No I aint got  
Anything to be scared  
Cause I love you  
  
I aint got  
Nothing to be scared of  
No aint got  
Nothing to be scared of  
  
I aint got  
Nothing to be scared of  
No I aint got  
Nothing to be scared
