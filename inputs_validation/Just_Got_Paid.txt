Thank God that its Friday night and I  
Justjustjustjustjust got paid  
Yea Oh  
  
Just got paid Friday night  
  
Chorus  
Just got paid Friday night  
Partys hoppin place is right  
Booties shaking all around  
Pump that jam while Im getting down  
  
Check the mirror Im lookin fly  
Round up the posse jump in my ride  
Radio rockin smooth jams  
Feel the rhythm pump up the sound  
Im feelin good dont you know Im grooving  
To the beat  
Im groovin yea grooving oh oh oh oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Some say my solo is impossible  
But when I get up on the mic Im unstoppable  
And its probably when you hear our voices laid down  
Youll be bopping your head to this ill tight sound  
  
Now I know you probably thought ya had me  
Played played  
But the check is in my hand and I got it mademade  
And youll notice my smile is like coolaid  
Cause I justjust gotgot paidpaid  
  
On the floor bumping to the beat  
All ways sure looks sweet  
Fine young lady standin by  
Come on baby sweet like delight
