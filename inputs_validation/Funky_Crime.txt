Why do you do what you do  
I do what I want to do  
Who said you could do what you do  
I told you who told me to  
I do what I want to do  
I do what I want to do  
  
Funky crime funky crime  
Dont you know funks colors blind  
Well Ive committed a funky crime  
Against a state of mind  
  
Hey you mister interview  
I dont have to answer you  
This is what I grew into  
Dont judge me and my soul stew  
Cause funk is my attitude  
Funk is my attitude  
  
Funky crime funky crime  
Dont you know funks colors blind  
Well Ive committed a funky crime  
Against a state of mind  
  
Barriers of race  
In the media take place  
Tellin you there is no room  
For what you do dont budge  
Theres no groove to your gloom  
Who made you the judge  
Always room for funky tunes  
And yes I funk it up  
  
Funky boy  
Meets a funky girl  
Make it funky baby  
Cause the funk is crazy  
  
Why do you do what you do  
I do what I want to do  
Who said you could do what you do  
I told you who told me to  
I do what I want to do  
I do what I want to do  
  
Funky crime funky crime  
Dont you know funks colors blind  
Well Ive committed a funky crime  
Against a state of mind  
  
Funky crime  
Funky crime  
Funky funky crime  
The crime is funky
