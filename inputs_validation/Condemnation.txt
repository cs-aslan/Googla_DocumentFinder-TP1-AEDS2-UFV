Condemnation  
Tried  
Here on the stand  
With the book in my hand  
And truth on my side  
Accusations  
Lies  
Hand me my sentence  
Ill show no repentance  
Ill suffer with pride  
If for honesty  
You want apologies  
I dont sympathize  
If for kindness  
You substitute blindness  
Please open your eyes  
Condemnation  
Why  
Because my duty  
Was always to beauty  
And that was my crime  
Feel elation  
High  
To know I can trust this  
Fix of injustice  
Time after time  
If you see purity  
As immaturity  
Well its no surprise  
If for kindness  
You substitute blindness  
Please open your eyes
