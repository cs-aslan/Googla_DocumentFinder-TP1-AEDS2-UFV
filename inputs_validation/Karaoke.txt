Things have been so crazy and hectic I should have got her back by now  
But you know how much I wanted to make it Its probably better anyhow  
So if you gotta go if theres anything I should know  
If the spotlight makes you nervous  
If youre looking for a purpose  
You put the tea in the kettle and light it  
Put your hand on the metal and feel it  
But do you even feel it anymore  
I remember when you thought I was joking  
Now Im off singing karaoke  
Farther than Ive ever been  
So if you gotta go if theres any way I can help  
  
Isnt it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner  
And tells me that my life is too much and moves to Atlanta Damn  
Of all the places you could go  
I just thought youd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know  
Im always up too late I worry about you there alone  
And that place you call your home warm nights and cold Patron  
I hope you dont get known for nothing crazy  
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories about his lady  
I know they say the first love is the sweetest  
But that first cut is the deepest  
I tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets  
You were telling everybody but me  
Dont be fooled by the money Im still just young and unlucky  
Im surprised you couldnt tell  
  
I was only trying to get ahead  
I was only trying to get ahead  
But the spotlight makes you nervous  
And youre looking for a purpose  
I was only trying to get ahead  
I was only trying to get ahead  
But the spotlight makes you nervous
