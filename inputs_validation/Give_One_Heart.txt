Love I am told is the deepest mystery  
Harder to fathom than any sea  
More precious than all the earth and sky  
But nobody can tell you why  
Give one heart  
Get back two  
Thats the paradox of I love you  
So when you give your heart  
You get one too  
Thats the paradox of I love you  
If it is love for which youve cried  
You know how it feels on moons dark side  
If your baby loves you right  
You can have skyrockets any old night  
Give one heart  
Get back two  
Thats the paradox of I love you  
So when you give your heart  
You get one too  
Thats the paradox of I love you  
And you cant stop saying it  
I love you  
Cant stop saying it  
I love you  
Keep on saying it saying it  
I wont stop until you say it too  
Love can be gentle soft and tame  
Or so rough you wouldnt know its name  
Shy and wild like a runaway child  
Storms of love always end up mild  
Give one heart  
Get back two  
Thats the paradox of I love you  
So when you give your heart  
You get one too  
Thats the paradox of I love you  
Give your heart  
Get back two  
Thats the paradox of I love you  
So when you give your heart  
Get one too  
Thats the paradox of I love you
