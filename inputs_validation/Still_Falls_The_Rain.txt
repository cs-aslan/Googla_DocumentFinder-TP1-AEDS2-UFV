the rain against the windshield endlessly  
for many years i cruised around the world  
ive finally disembarked my ship of fools  
a hero then a stranger to return  
id trade my goldrush gainst your silvernets  
to know what happened after all this time  
and in your arms im lost forevermore  
i wonder how you ever felt in mine  
isnt it strange i still can hear your call  
isnt it strange im not a ghost at all  
isnt it strange or is it just insane  
isnt it strange the glory and the fame  
still falls the rain  
do you remember how we used to play  
and how we waved our banners in the sun  
do you remember how we gave ourselves away  
for some strange kind of fun  
and how we smiled as if wed understood the writings on the walls  
and cooked our spice on silver spoons  
and if we wouldnt see the light  
we overdosed the follwing night  
isnt it strange  
ive got burnholes in my fingers that could not ease your pain  
or was it me who killed the blue inside your eyes  
when silence grew behind our shadows on the wall  
but if all was silent could we hear a bit more  
i wonder can you hear me now  isnt it strange  
ohhh  
isnt it strange i still can hear your call  
isnt it strange im not a ghost at all  
isnt it strange or is it just insane  
isnt it strange the glory and the fame  
still falls the rain
