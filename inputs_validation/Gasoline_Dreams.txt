Alright alright alright alright  
  
Dont everybody like the smell of gasoline  
Well burn motherfucker burn American Dream  
Dont everybody like the taste of Apple Pie  
Well snap for your slice of life Im tellin ya why  
I hear that mother natures now on birth control  
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to ho  
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll  
Youth full of fire aint got nowhere to go nowhere 2 go  
  
All of my heroes did dope  
Every nigga round me playin married  
Or paying child support  
I cant cope  
Never made no sense to me one day I hope it will  
And thats that sport sport  
Pray I live to see the day when Sevens happily married  
With kids woe woe  
The world is moving fast and Im losin my balance  
No time to dig low low  
To a place where aint nowhere to go but up  
Ya wit me say shit sho sho  
Now let me ask yall this  
  
Dont everybody like the smell of gasoline  
Well burn motherfucker burn American Dream  
Dont everybody like the taste of Apple Pie  
Well snap for your slice of life Im tellin ya why  
I hear that mother natures now on birth control  
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to ho  
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll  
Youth full of fire aint got nowhere to go nowhere 2 go  
  
Its shitty like Ricky Stratton got a million bucks  
My cousin Ricky Walker got ten years doing Fed time  
On a first offense drug bust fuck the Holice

Arrest me 4 this dope I didnt weight it up or cook it  
You gotta charge the world cause over a million people took it  
Look at me you outta your jurisdiction now ya lookin stupid  
Officer get off me sir  
Dont make me call LA hell have ya walking sir  
A couple of months ago they gave OutKast the key to the city  
But I still gotta pay my taxes and they give us no pity  
About the youngsters amongst us  
You think they respect the law  
They think they monsters they love us reality rappin  
And giving the youth the truth from this booth  
And when we on stage we scream  
Dont everybody everybody  
  
Dont everybody like the smell of gasoline  
Well burn motherfucker burn American Dream  
Dont everybody like the taste of Apple Pie  
Well snap for your slice of life Im tellin ya why  
I hear that mother natures now on birth control  
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to ho  
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll  
Youth full of fire aint got nowhere to go nowhere 2 go  
  
Officer of the most high  
You touch me you touch the apple of this eye  
If they kick us out where will we go  
Not to Africa cause not one of them acknowledge us as they kin folk  
Still eatin pork  
Abomination desecration for beating flesh  
Penalty for violation is death  
Woe woe to the man that strive with his maker on judgment day  
Hip Hip Hooray  
Mr Reaper Babylon the great  
The mother of heartless is falling prophecy must be fulfilled  
The liquor fire is calling  
  
Dont everybody like the smell of gasoline  
Well burn motherfucker burn American Dream  
Dont everybody like the taste of Apple Pie  
Well snap for your slice of life Im tellin ya why  
I hear that mother natures now on birth control  
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to ho  
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll  
Youth full of fire aint got nowhere to go nowhere 2 go
