Ten nine eight seven six five four three two  
One of these days Ill be back with you  
Counting the ways that I love you  
Through and through  
  
One two three four five six seven eight nine  
Tentatively you put up the signs  
Letting me know you are mine  
  
And Im counting on you  
To be here through it all  
Im counting on you  
To catch me if I fall  
Whatever you do remember  
Im always counting on you  
  
Flight six eight one gate fortytwo  
At seven fifteen Ill feel ten feet tall  
Knowing you care after all  
  
And Im counting on you  
To be here through it all  
Im counting on you  
To catch me if I fall  
Whatever you do remember  
Im always counting on you  
  
Counting on you  
To be here through it all  
Counting on you  
To catch me if I fall  
Remember Im always  
Counting on you
