Dont cry dont cry baby  
Dont cry baby  
Dry your eyes and lets be sweethearts again  
And oh cause you know  
You know I didnt mean  
To ever treat you so mean  
Cmon cmon sweetheart  
And lets try it over again  
  
And oh dont cry  
Dont cry baby  
Dont cry dont cry  
Dry your eyes and lets be sweethearts again  
And oh cause you know you know I didnt mean  
To ever treat you so mean  
Cmon cmon sweetheart  
And lets try it over again  
  
Dont cry dont cry baby  
Dont cry baby  
Dry your eyes and lets be sweethearts again  
And oh cause you know  
You know I didnt mean  
To ever treat you so mean  
Cmon cmon sweetheart  
And lets try it over again
