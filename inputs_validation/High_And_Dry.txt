Two jumps and a week  
I bet you think thats pretty clever dont you boy  
Flying on your motorcycle  
Watching all the ground beneath you drop  
  
Kill yourself for recognition  
Kill yourself to never ever stop  
You broke another mirror  
Youre turning into something you are not  
  
Dont leave me high dont leave me dry  
Dont leave me high dont leave me dry  
  
Drying up in conversation  
You will be the one who cannot talk  
All your insides fall to pieces  
You just sit there wishing you could still make love  
  
Theyre the ones wholl hate you  
When you think youve got the world all sussed out  
Theyre the ones wholl spit at you  
Youll be the one screaming out  
  
Dont leave me high dont leave me dry  
Dont leave me high dont leave me dry  
  
Its the best thing that you ever had  
The best thing you ever ever had  
Its the best thing that you ever had  
The best thing you have had is gone away  
  
Dont leave me high dont leave me dry  
Dont leave me high dont leave me dry  
Dont leave me high  
Dont leave me high dont leave me dry
