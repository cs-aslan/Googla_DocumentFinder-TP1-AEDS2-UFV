The ingots are burning red  
Im working time and a half  
Tomorrow Ill stay in bed  
What a life I lead what a life  
Laugh in my face why dont you  
Laugh with the rest I know it well  
I tripped and then I fell for  
The beauty of Wynona  
At night I toss and I turn  
And I try and dial your number  
Its changed and God only knows  
Where you been since last December  
Where you been with that twisted smile  
Laying another on the pile  
It aint easy when we go down for  
The beauty of Wynona  
Girls they skip double dutch  
I saw you there prayed my God  
But my prayers dont mean nothin much  
With a heart that cannot be won  
Rain in that wishing well  
Right here in my own bed  
It aint easy when we go down for  
The beauty of wynona
