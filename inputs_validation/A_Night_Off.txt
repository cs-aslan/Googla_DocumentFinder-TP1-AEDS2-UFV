Spending every moment in the studio  
Id never said itd be fair  
But when youre all alone I hope you truly know  
How bad I want to be there  
  
Chorus  
Come right here  
Set your bag down  
I took a night off for you  
Go ahead and turn the lights off  
But keep your heels on  
Theyre fittin for what Im about to do  
  
No you aint explainin how you want it done  
Just be quiet Ill do fine without ya help girl  
Can you work without a second for some fun  
Now you finally got a moment to yaself girl  
And I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
  
I been waitin for so long to get you all alone  
Now I finally got you right here  
So baby Im a lock my door and disconnect my phone  
Cause I wanna make one thing clear  
I want you on top  
So let ya hair down  
I took the night off for you  
Girl Im gonna turn the lights off  
But keep ya heels on  
Theyre fittin for what were about to do  
  
Chorus  
  
No you aint explainin how you want it done  
Just be quiet Ill do fine without ya help girl  
Can you work without a second for some fun  
Now you finally got a moment to yaself girl  
And I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
  
Oh oh Its 6 oclock in the morning at the studio
