They used to be rough and rowdy  
And honkytonk all night long  
When the Opry spilled out in the alley  
There wasnt nobody goin home  
When they turned out the lights at Tootsies  
To wind up at Cowboy Jacks  
Weve got to take this country back  
Weve got to take this country back  
We need a few more matchin Nudie suits  
And silver dollar Cadillacs  
Theres one too many dime store cowboys  
Muscled up in a cowboy hat  
Weve got to take this country back  
Nobody wants to be Hank Williams  
Sing about the lost highway  
Well Saturday nights at the Ryman  
Those were the good ol days  
We need to turn the twang up a little  
And bring back the Nashville Cats  
Weve got to take this country back  
Weve got to take this country back  
We need a few more pointy toed cowboy boots  
And steer horn Cadillacs  
Theres one too many dime store cowboys  
Muscled up in a cowboy hat  
Weve got to take this country back  
Weve got to take this country back  
We need a few more matchin Nudie suits  
And silver dollar Cadillacs  
When we all gather up in Heaven  
How we gonna face the man in black  
We got to take this country back  
Yeah when we all gather up in Heaven  
How we gonna face the man in black  
We got to take this country back
