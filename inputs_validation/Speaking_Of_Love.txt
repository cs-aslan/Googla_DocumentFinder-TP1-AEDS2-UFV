Ive been in love Ive walked alone  
I turned to you but you were gone  
I felt the doubt it hurt me inside  
Without your help my hands are tied  
  
You are my home my place to go  
My faith returned you told me so  
I feel you now Im standing beside you  
Do you hear me calling  
Its to remind you if you find me falling  
  
Hold me in your arms  
Tell me that you want me  
Whisper all the words  
That dreams are made of  
Hold me in your arms  
Tell me are we speaking of love  
  
Dont leave me know Ive come so far  
To hear your voice speak from your heart  
I hear you now youre standing beside me  
Do you hear me calling  
Its to remind you if you find me falling  
  
Hold me in your arms  
Tell me that you want me  
Whisper all the words  
That dreams are made of  
Hold me in your arms  
Tell me are we speaking of love
