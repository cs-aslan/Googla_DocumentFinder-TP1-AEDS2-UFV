I drove my Sarsen through your garden last night  
I kicked your front door down around at midnight  
Somethings telling me boy that your avoiding me  
And when I find you you will run for your tea  
  
Chorus  
Ive got a brand new shiny helmet and a pair of kinky boots  
Ive got a lovely new flak jacket a lovely khaki suit  
When we go on night patrol we hold each others hand  
For we are the British Army and were here to take your land  
  
My good friend Bertie hes in the udr  
To search for weapons he will go near and far  
Up around by Kappa youd never find him there  
The only gun hell get there is an Armalite in his ear  
  
Chorus  
  
My good friend Trevor hes in the ruc  
But now theyve handed him his redundancy  
Folks along the border wont be seeing him any more  
That provo sniper will be missing him for sure  
  
Chorus  
  
My good friend Nigel hes in the sas  
He says a child is just as good as the rest  
Now theyve gone and posted him way down to Crossmaglen  
He wished to blazes he was back in jail again  
  
Chorus  
  
My good friend Sammy hes in the dup  
An upstanding member as all the world can see  
I said Go up to Donegal if you want to have some fun  
He said Ill take a run there if I have nothing on  
  
Chorus
