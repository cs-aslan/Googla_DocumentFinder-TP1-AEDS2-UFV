Witches gather at black masses  
Bodies burning in red ashes  
On the hill the church in ruin  
Is the scene of evil doings  
Its a place for all bad sinners  
Watch them eating dead rats innards  
I guess its the same whereever you may go  
Oh Lord yeah  
  
Carry banners which denounce the lord  
See me rocking in my grave  
See them anoint my head with dead rats blood  
See them stick the stake through me  
Oh  
  
Dont hold me back cause Ive just gotta go  
Theyve got a hold of my soul now  
Lords got my brain instinct with blood obscene not sure about this line  
Look in my eyes Im there enough  
Yeah  
  
On the scene a priest appears  
Sinners falling at his knees  
Satan sends out funeral pyre  
Casts the priest into the fire  
Its the place for all bad sinners  
Watch them eating dead rats innards  
I guess its the same whereever you may go  
Oh lord yeah
