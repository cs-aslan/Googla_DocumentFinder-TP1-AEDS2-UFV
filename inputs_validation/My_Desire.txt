Build on a loss to injury  
Step back from a fallen dream  
I stay and wont go easy  
I stay for My Desire  
  
My arm falls and strength is fading from my veins  
I cling to a dream that once ruled my world  
Been gone for so long without a second thought  
I have misled but I wont let this wreck my world  
  
That I have left without a trace  
It takes all I have to forget  
I wanted nothing more than to have my day  
This dream still lives inside of  
  
Hold on to every emotion  
Go further with every step  
I asked for with every wish but now I find it almost gone  
Misguided another day has come and gone without the truth  
  
But this will never fade my world  
That I have left without a trace  
It takes all I have to forget  
I wanted nothing more than to have my day  
  
This dream still lives inside of me  
This will never fade  
This dream will never fade  
As each day goes on the chance for my day slips away  
  
I will not forget my home my world my home
