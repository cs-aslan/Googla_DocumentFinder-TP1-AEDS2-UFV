Intro  
Yeah this record for my baby my baby boo  
I know Im always on the road Im always gone  
And you say I never make records for you no more  
Well this record is from me to you baby  
Yeah real talk  
  
Chorus  
Been around the world  
Ive been into many places  
Seen some unfamiliar faces  
But baby none of them compare to you  
Soon as I get home Im racing to unplug my phone  
  
Verse 1  
I seen everything twice  
Been around the world Ive seen every scene twice  
Stopping down in Tokyo dipping in the rice  
Im a boss at the wind I cracked every colored dice  
I do it big fuck the rumors  
Rich and infamous with the blue and grey Pumas  
Gangstas dont die they just move to Miami  
I did all that I was voted my candy  
Im sorta like Sammy  
Smoother than Marvin I need me a Tammy  
Sippin Chardinae making deals with my hands free  
Fatherhood now the actors cant stand me  
Cause I own rap and Im coming for your day job  
Until then Im chilling at the day spa  
Relax my mind and just chill  
Cause without you none of this is real  
Baby you know I  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 2  
Yeah but now Im back across the water  
Im in Sydney with somebodys daughter  
Blowing sticky by the zips and they can tell  
By my rag hanging nigga this is Crip but Im chilling  
It feels so good to get away  
Especially when your name is DOdoubleGizzee  
Coasttocoast jetting man I been doing that  
What you do just start balling I been around the track  
Hop in Peas with the bosses  
300 for the yacht the third deck got a office  
Docking down in Manico churching with my folks  
Bad luck had me dying when I fell up out that boat  
My life is like a movie  
But the bad guy dont die at the end so sue me  
Then I relax and chill  
Cause without you none of this is real  
Baby you know I  
  
Chorus  
  
Outro  
Just for you baby  
Yeah Im on my way home right now  
Im on my way right now  
Im leaving the studio right now  
Soon as I get home tomorrow Ima go unplug it  
Matter of fact I aint even gonna bring it in the house  
See you in a minute
