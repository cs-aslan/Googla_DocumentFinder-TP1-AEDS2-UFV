Oh Ive got a few good words to lay on everybody  
Its about a man too blind to understand  
The way Ive treated my woman was a doggone pity  
But we know theres a weakness in every man  
  
Just like a fool I went and left my baby crying  
A different kind of lovin I had on my mind  
But everybody that I met was either cheatin or lying  
When I get a good thing at home all the time  
  
Its a lonely old feeling when you go from town to town  
When you cant get the woman at home off your mind  
Im so tired of livin in this new world that Ive found  
Lord I hope I didnt waste too much time  
  
I gotta put my pride aside and call my baby  
Gotta do it now cant wait another day  
I dialed a number and then I heard the voice of my lady  
It blew my mind when I heard her say  
  
And she said bring it on home to your woman  
Ive got a lot of lovin a waitin I hope you aint forgot  
And she said bring it on home to your woman  
And when you get there you better  
Give me all the love youve got  
  
And she said bring it on home to your woman  
Ive got a lot of lovin a waitin I hope you aint forgot  
And she said bring it on home to your woman  
And when you get there you better  
Give me all the love youve got
