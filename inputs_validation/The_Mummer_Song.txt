Hark whats the noise out by the porch door  
Dear Granny theres mummers theres twenty or more  
Her old weathered face lightens up with a grin  
Any mummers nice mummers lowed in  
  
Ah come in lovely mummers dont bother the snow  
Well wipe up the water sure after you go  
And sit if you can upon some mummers knee  
Well see if we knows who ye be  
  
Ah theres big ones and small ones tall ones and thin  
Theres boys dressed as women and girls dressed as men  
With humps on their backs and mitts on their feet  
My blessed well die with the heat  
  
Well theres only one here that I think that I know  
That tall fellow standing alongside the stove  
Hes shaking his fist for to make me not tell  
Must be Willy from out on the hill  
  
Ah but that ones a stranger if ever was one  
With his underwear stuffed and his trapdoor undone  
Is he wearing his mothers big fortytwo bra  
I knows but Im not going to say  
  
Well I suppose you fine mummers would turn down a drop  
Of home brew or alky whatever you got  
That one with his rubber boots on the wrong feet  
Ate enough for to do him all week  
  
Now I suppose you can dance Sure they all nod their heads  
Theyve been tapping their feet ever since they came in  
And now that the drinks have been all passed around  
Sure the mummers are plankin er down  
  
Instrumental break  Bob plays one verse of Deck the Halls on the fiddle  
  
Ah be careful the lamp Now hold on to the stove  
Dont you swing Granny hard cause you know that shes old  
And never you mind how you buckles the floor  
Cause the mummers have danced here before  
  
Oh my God how hot is it Well never know  
Allows that well all get the devils own cold  
Good night and good Christmas mummers me dears  
Please God we will see you next year  
  
Ah good night and good Christmas mummers me dears
