Well theres a light in your eyes  
Thats guiding my way to your doorstep  
And your voice called my name  
With a sound that Ive never known  
I was a kid in a comic bookworld looking for answers  
When out of the darkness she came  
  
Like a cat on a crown  
In the middle of the night  
Doesnt care if its late  
Doesnt matter if its right  
And I laugh when I think  
I may never have knocked on your door  
  
Chorus  
Last night  
You turned a frightened little boy into a man without shame  
Last night  
We tore the hands off a clock and it read just the same  
Last night  
I had a crazy little dream and you turned it all around  
Last Night  
We took a chance we shook it up and now the worlds upside down  
  
All the fire in your heart  
And the heat of your touch Ill remember  
And youre dancing like a flame  
Perfection in motion  
It was the masterpiece from the start  
Only you and I could have rendered  
And Ill never be the same  
  
Im a cat on a crown  
In the middle of the night  
Doesnt care if its late  
Doesnt matter if its right  
And I laugh when I think  
I may never have knocked on your door  
  
Chorus  
  
Like a cat on a crown  
In the middle of the night  
Doesnt matter if its late  
Doesnt matter if its right  
Cause I laugh when I think  
I may never have knocked on your door  
  
Chorus  
  
Last night
