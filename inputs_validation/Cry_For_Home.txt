Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting on that shore  
To hear the cry for home  
You wont have to worry anymore  
When you hear the cry for home  
  
When you hear hear the call  
You wont have to fake at all  
Hear the cry for home  
  
Ill be standing  
Ill be standing within reach  
When you hear hear the call  
  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting in the breach  
For you when you hear  
  
When you hear hear the call  
You wont have to fake at all  
Hear the cry for home  
  
When I listen  
When I listen to the song  
Well it feels it feels so free  
  
And you tell me  
You will come and go with me  
When you hear the cry for home  
  
When you hear the call  
You wont have to think at all  
Hear the cry for home  
Spoken one more one more time  
When you hear hear the call  
You wont have to fake at all  
Hear the cry for home  
One more open it up open it up  
When you hear hear the call  
You wont have to fake at all  
Hear the cry for home  
Hear When you hear hear the call  
Hear When you hear hear the call  
Hear When you hear hear the call  
Hear When you hear hear the call  
Hear When you hear hear the call  
Hear When you hear hear the call
