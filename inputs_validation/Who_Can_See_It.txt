Ive been held up  
Ive been run down  
I can see quite clearly now  
Through those past years  
When I played towing the line  
I only ask that what I feel  
Should not be denied me now  
As its been earned and  
I have seen my life belongs to me  
My love belongs to who can see it  
  
Ive lived in fear  
Ive been out there  
Ive been round and  
Seen my share  
Of this sad world  
And all the hate  
That its stirred  
I only ask  
That what I know  
Should not be denied me now  
As its been learned  
And I have seen my life belongs to me  
My love belongs to who can see it  
  
I only ask that what I feel  
Should not be denied me now  
As its been earned and  
I have seen my life belongs to me  
  
My love belongs to who can see it  
  
My love belongs to who
