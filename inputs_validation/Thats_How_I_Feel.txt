Well Ive been waiting so long  
Ive been waiting so patiently  
Out of the blue you call  
Youre leaving him to be with me now  
  
Now maybe Im right or maybe Im wrong  
Oh I gotta know now  
Ill take what you got so youd better hold on  
Youd better believe it  
  
Cos thats how I feel when Im in your arms  
Thats how I feel when Im with you  
You make me feel like never before  
Thats how I feel when Im with you  
  
He doesnt treat you good  
He doesnt say the things that I say  
So when he turns around  
Youre gonna stab him in the back and then walk away  
  
Now maybe Im right or maybe Im wrong  
Oh I gotta know now  
Ill take what you got so youd better hold on  
Youd better believe it  
  
Cos thats how I feel when Im in your arms  
Thats how I feel when Im with you  
You make me feel like never before  
Thats how I feel when Im with you  
  
Youve been away too long  
And now youre coming home  
But I wont believe it until  
Im holding you tight tight tight tonight  
  
Now maybe Im right or maybe Im wrong  
Oh I gotta know now  
Ill take what you got so youd better hold on  
Youd better believe it  
  
Cos thats how I feel when Im in your arms  
Thats how I feel when Im with you  
You make me feel like never before  
Thats how I feel when Im with you  
  
Thats how I feel when Im in your arms  
Thats how I feel when Im with you ooh yeah  
Thats how I feel when Im in your arms  
Thats how I feel when Im with you  
Thats how I feel when Im with you
