When you feel like it you just do it you never move around it you walk  
Through it well you dont give a damn where it comes from cause  
Everybody gonna have to chew your junk well does it feel right Mmm does  
It feel right Well lets jump lets jump to a blazing beat when you  
Close your eyes and strap into your seat you got the throttle wide open  
I head your engines scream its a terrifying scene do you know what I  
Mean well lets funk lets funk in my car lets jump to the nearest  
Star cause you wont get far with all that trash when all you do is  
Thrash Thrash Thrash Lets funk lets funk in my car lets jump to  
The nearest star cause you wont get far with all that trash when all  
You do is thrash Thrash Thrash Motivator is the name of the game and  
If you want to know youre the biggest pain You pull the plug out when  
The chips are down you stand on my face and kick me when Im down
