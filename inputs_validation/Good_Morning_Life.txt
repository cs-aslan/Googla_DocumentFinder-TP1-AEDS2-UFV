Good morning life  
Good morning sun how are your skies above  
Gee its great to be alive and in love  
Good morning life  
Good morning birds sing out your happy tunes  
Feels so good because Ill be seeing her soon  
Last night she said she loved me  
What a pity to part  
I slept with both eyes open waiting for today to start  
Good morning life  
Good morning world how are you happiness  
All at once I know what livin can be  
Its life its free its someone waiting for me  
Wholl someday be my wife good morning life  
Good morning life  
Good morning life  
Last night she said she loved me  
What a pity to part  
I slept with both eyes open waiting for today to start  
Good morning life  
Good morning world how are you happiness  
All at once I know what livin can be  
Ah its life its free its someone waiting for me  
Wholl someday be my wife good morning life
