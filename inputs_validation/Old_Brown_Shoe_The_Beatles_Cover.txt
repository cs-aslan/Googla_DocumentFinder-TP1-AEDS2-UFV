I want a love thats right  
But right is only half of whats wrong  
I want a shorthaired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long  
Now Im steppin outta this old brown shoe  
Baby Im in love with you  
So glad you came here wont be the same now  
Im telling you  
  
You know you pick me up  
From where some try to drag me down  
And when I see your smile  
Replacin every thoughtless frown  
You got me excapin from the zoo  
Baby Im in love with you  
So glad you came here  
Wont be the same now Im tellin you  
  
If I grow up Ill be a singer  
And wear rings on every finger  
Not worryin what they or you say  
Ill live an love and maybe someday  
Who knows baby  
You may comfort me  
  
I may appear to be imperfect  
My love is sumthin you cant reject  
Im changin faster than the weather  
If you and me should get together  
Who knows baby you may comfort me  
  
I want a love thats yours  
To miss is really sumthin Id hate  
Ill get an early start  
Makin sure that Im not late Hey  
For your sweet top lip Im in the queue  
Baby Im in love with you  
So glad you came here  
Wont be the same now Im tellin you  
Hey yeah yeahhhh
