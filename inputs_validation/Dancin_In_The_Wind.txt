Wont deny everything cant last  
But its closing in so fast  
Thought that Id figured it out at last  
But you cant change the past  
And its closing in so fast  
Feels just like were dancing in the wind  
Feeling just all right  
When were dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night  
Just dont walk away  
When Ive got you in my arms tonight  
And Ive got something to say  
There are still rules to break  
And this music is a place to hide  
Isnt it just a game we play  
Feels just like were dancing in the wind  
Feeling just all right  
When were dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
When were dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night  
Feels just like were dancing in the wind  
Feeling just alright  
When were dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
When were dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
When were dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night
