I wake up in the morning  
And the sun begins to shine  
The day did sneak up on the night  
I see your face and I see myself  
And I get a little taste of life  
I try to stand it for a while  
  
But Im in a trance  
Hey baby tell me cant you hear me calling  
Im in a trance  
I take too much in the Saturday night  
Hey hey  
Hey baby tell me cant you hear me calling  
Im in a trance  
I want to try to stop this life  
  
I feel so sad Im feeling down  
On the radio the music plays  
Im in love with her and I feel fine  
I close my eyes  
I think today is getting better with a sip of wine  
And I can stand it for a while  
  
When Im in a trance  
Hey baby tell me cant you hear me calling  
Im in a trance  
I take too much in the Saturday night  
Hey hey  
Hey baby tell me cant you hear me calling  
Im in a trance  
I want to try to stop this life  
  
Im in a trance  
Hey baby tell me cant you hear me calling  
Im in a trance  
I take too much in the Saturday night  
Hey hey  
Hey baby tell me cant you hear me calling  
Im in a trance  
I want to try to stop this life
