How can you say You torture me when youre already thinking about someone
else  
When he comes home youll be in his arms and Ill be gone  
But I know my day will come I know someday Ill be the only one  
So now you wait for a spark you now it will turn you on  
Hes gonna make you feel the way you want to feel  
When he starts to lie when he makes you cry youll now Ill be there  
My day will come I know someday Ill be the only one  
  
Call me selfish call it what you like I think its right  
To want someone for all your own and not to share their love  
But Ill have my way  
You dont stand a chance anyway  
Cause I got to you you dont stand a chance  
  
So now you wait for his cock you know it will turn you on  
Hes gonna make you feel the way you want to feel  
When he starts to lie when he makes you cry youll now Ill be there  
My day will come I know someday Ill be the only one  
My day will come I know someday Ill be the only one  
  
You say you want perfection thats your selfdestruction  
You dont know what you want its gonna take you a year to find out  
I am not givin up  
And when youve had enough you take your bruised little head  
And youll come running back to me  
I know that I will be the only one
