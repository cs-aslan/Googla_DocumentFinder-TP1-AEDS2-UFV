I was walking down the street today  
Just as somebody blew the doors off of the be of A  
Just then I head them call my name  
As I was thrown against the car  
I was being framed  
  
All units weve got our man  
Weve got the bank robber man  
We dont need no reason  
Youre going in the can  
You look like the bank robber man  
I think you misunderstand  
Do you think that I am the one that did it  
Just because Im tan  
Just then the officer at hand said  
I dont give a damn that you are in a rock and roll band  
  
All units weve got our man  
Weve got the bank robber man  
We dont need no reason  
Youre going in the can  
You look like the bank robber man  
  
Just tell me whats going on   
Can you tell me what I did wrong   
Does busting me make you feel strong   
Make you feel strong  
  
All units weve got our man  
Weve got the bank robber man  
We dont need no reason  
Youre going in the can  
You look like the bank robber man
