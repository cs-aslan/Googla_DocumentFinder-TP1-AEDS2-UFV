Ticking ticking ticking  
Always counting right down  
The clock strikes ten  
You still wear your old gown  
Come on come on come on  
Get the hell up and stay  
Alert and strong  
Try to find your right way  
  
People say its wrong  
People say its bad  
Others say that gods a little mad  
Secretly hed wear the black you know  
  
If god loves rock n roll  
Id better protect my soul  
Cause heaven seems to be  
The place I wanna be  
If god loves rock n roll  
Id better reset my goal  
Do everything I can  
To be a rocking man  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Leather suits you better  
Got to let your hair grow  
Take the black and enjoy the new show  
Welcome to an army spreading over the world  
Wild and proud brothers  
Havent you heard  
  
People say its wrong  
People say its bad  
Others say that gods a little mad  
Secretly hed wear the black you know  
  
If god loves rock n roll  
Id better protect my soul  
Cause heaven seems to be  
The place I wanna be  
If god loves rock n roll  
Id better reset my goal  
Do everything I can  
To be a rocking man  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
If god loves rock n roll  
Even in heaven you need a bass guitar  
A guitar and a second guitar  
Here we go  
  
If god loves rock n roll  
Id better protect my soul  
Cause heaven seems to be  
The place I wanna be  
If god loves rock n roll  
Id better reset my goal  
Do everything I can  
To be a rocking man  
  
If god loves rock n roll  
If god loves rock n roll  
If god loves rock n roll
