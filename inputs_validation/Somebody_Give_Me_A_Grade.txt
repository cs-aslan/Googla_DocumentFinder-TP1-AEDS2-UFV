Oh yeah I have got something to say  
  
I have been burned by vague lesson plans and a freefloating curriculum  
I like my rules baby etched in stone cause you know I am going to stick to
them  
Can I get a syllabus a little discipline Judge me on a scale from A to F  
You wasted all my time learning how to rhyme now let me hang it from a treble
clef  
  
Somebody give me a grade  
Somebody give me a grade somebody give me a grade  
I need the man keeping me down  
Somebody give me a grade  
Somebody give me a grade somebody give me a grade  
Is there a red pen in this town  
Somebody give me a grade  
Somebody give me a grade somebody give me a grade  
I already said it I need that extra credit today  
Somebody give me a grade somebody give me a grade  
And make it an A  
  
Oh I am so upset  
I am stone cold honor role  
I wont be told how to vent  
I wont cry or sigh Im here to testify  
Up with the establishment  
  
My parents understand me for conformity inside of me with which I can help
the system out  
I aint gonna waste my summer taking beatings from my drummer  
Put a mic in front of me and Ill shout  
  
Give me a grade  
Somebody give me a grade somebody give me a grade  
You know Im gonna wreck the curve  
Somebody give me a grade  
Somebody give me a grade somebody give me a grade  
The only letter I deserve  
Somebody give me a grade  
Somebody give me a grade somebody give me a grade  
This isnt a request I demand there be a test today  
Somebody give me a grade somebody give me a grade  
Give me a grade
