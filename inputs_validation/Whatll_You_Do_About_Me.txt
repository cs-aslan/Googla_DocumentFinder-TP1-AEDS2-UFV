All you wanted was a one night stand  
The fire of the wine and the touch of a man  
But I fell in love and ruined all of your plans  
So whatll you do about me  
  
Imagine the faces on your high class friends  
When I beat on the door and I beg to come in  
Screaming come on love me again  
Whatll you do about me  
  
You can change your number  
You can change your name  
You can ride like hell on a midnight train  
Thats all right mama thats ok  
Whatll you do about me  
  
Picture your neighbors when you try to explain  
That good old boy standing out in the rain  
With his nose on the windowpane  
Lady whatll you do about me  
  
And what in the world are you planning to do  
When a man comes over just to visit with you  
And Im on the porch with a 2 by 2  
Tell me whatll you do about me  
  
You can call your lawyer  
You can call the fuzz  
You can sound the alarm wake the neighbors up  
There aint no way to stop a man in love  
Whatll you do about me  
  
All you wanted was a one night stand  
The fire of the wine and the touch of a man  
But I fell in love and baby here I am  
Whatll you do about me  
  
You can change your number you can change your name  
You can ride like hell on a midnight train  
Thats all right mama thats ok  
But whatll you do about  
Whatll you do about me  
Whatll you do about me
