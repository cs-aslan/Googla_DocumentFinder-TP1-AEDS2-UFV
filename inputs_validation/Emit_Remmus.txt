The California animal is a bear  
Angeleno but the devil may care  
Summer time to talk and swear  
Later maybe we could share some air  
Ill take you to the movies there  
We could walk through Leicester Square  
What could be wetter than  
An English girl American man  
  
Chorus  
London in the summer time  
Call me now use the satellite  
London in the summer time  
Cuss me out and itll feel all right  
  
Hesitate but dont refuse  
The choice was yours but you said choose  
The look she used was green and sharp  
Stabbed that boy all in his heart  
Come what may the cosmos will  
Take me up and down on Primrose Hill  
What could be wetter than  
An English girl American man  
  
Chorus  
  
Cuss me out and itll feel all right  
Its all right now  
Call me now use the satellite  
Its all right  
Its all right  
  
Down and out and itll sound all right  
Its all right now  
Its all right  
  
The California flower is poppy child  
Felony sends me all the gold in your smile  
Drift away from anyone you can  
Nothing ever goes according to plan  
Though I know that every river bends  
Time to say hello to snow on the Thames  
What could be wetter than  
An English girl American man  
  
Chorus
