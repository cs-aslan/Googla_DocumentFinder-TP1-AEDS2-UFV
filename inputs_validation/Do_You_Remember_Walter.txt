Walter remember when the world was young and all the girls knew Walters  
Name  
Walter isnt it a shame the way our little world has changed  
Do you remember Walter playing cricket in the thunder and the rain  
Do you remember Walter smoking cigarettes behind your garden gate  
Yes Walter was my mate  
But Walter my old friend where are you now  
  
Walters name  
Walter isnt it a shame the way our little world has changed  
Do you remember Walter how we said wed fight the world so wed be free  
Wed save up all our money and wed buy a boat and sail away to sea  
But it was not to be  
I knew you then but do I know you now  
  
Walter you are just an echo of a world I knew so long ago  
Walter if you saw me now you wouldnt even know my name  
I bet youre fat and married  
And youre always home in bed by half past eight  
And if I talked about the old times youd get bored  
And youd have nothing more to say  
Yes people often change  
But memories of people can remain
