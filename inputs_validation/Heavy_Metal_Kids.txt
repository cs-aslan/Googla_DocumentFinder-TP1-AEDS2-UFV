Its like a normal Times Square day on 42nd Street  
I feel like trashing some windows and crunching some feet  
I watch society crumble and I just laugh hee hee  
They soon will see what its like to be the other half  
  
But Im trying  
Said Im trying to forget  
And it aint happened yet  
I must of woke up this morning with a bug up my ass  
  
I think Ill just haul off and belt the next jerk that I pass  
My old man says Im just a stoned little punk  
But he keeps himself a pistol and hes always drunk  
I know  
  
Somethings gonna give  
Pretty soon  
I know it  
Somethings gonna give  
  
I want to live  
I want to mess thing whole world around  
Go on and poison all the water use up all the air  
Blow your stupid heads off see if I could care  
  
Put me down but dont blame me for what you did  
Cause inside everyone is a heavy metal kid  
I was a sweet little kid once  
Now Im a full grown crank  
  
And when I die Ill probably come back as a Sherman tank  
I know that I could make this world so peaceful and calm  
If I could only get my hands on a hydrogen bomb
