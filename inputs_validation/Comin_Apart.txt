Baby my tears I know I can hide  
But sweet sweet baby  
Its tearing me up inside  
  
And Im comin apart breakin in pieces  
Look at my world tumblin down  
Comin apart breakin in pieces baby  
Since youre not around  
Youve won Im lost  
Nowhere to run to  
  
Baby please hear what I got to say  
Oh sweet sweet baby  
Oh dont turn me away  
  
Cause Im comin apart  
Breakin in pieces  
Look at my world tumblin down  
Comin apart breakin in pieces  
Baby since youre not around  
Youve won Im lost  
Nowhere to run to
