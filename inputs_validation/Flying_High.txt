You know I spent a little time out in Malibu  
I spent quite a bit down in Nashville too  
Cuz I like the beach and loves to honky tonk  
But the place that I call home  
Is where I never have to feel alone  
Its the place where I was raised and I was born  
  
And the grass dont get much greener  
And life cant get no sweeter  
I got a funny cigarette and a twodollar bottle of wine  
And theres no need for new beginnings  
More money or window trimmings  
And if the good Lords willin Im a keep on chillin refillin and flyin
high  
  
Flyin high  
In an old lawn chair  
Flyin high  
With an ice cold beer  
Got nowhere to go no place Id rather be  
Yeah the grass dont get much greener  
And life cant get no sweeter  
And if the good Lords willin Im a keep on chillin refillin and flyin
high  
  
You know Ive traveled on yachts thru the south of France  
Think I even got a pair of Versace pants  
But all that makes me feel is like a fool  
Cuz a pontoon boat and a bottle of Beam  
A couple good friends and some cut off jeans  
Has made us realize you cant buy cool  
  
And the grass dont get much greener  
And life cant get no sweeter  
I got a funny cigarette and a twodollar bottle of wine  
And theres no need for new beginnings  
More money or window trimmings  
And if the good Lords willin Im a keep on chillin refillin and flyin
high  
  
Flyin high  
In an old lawn chair  
Flyin high  
And my family near  
Nowhere to go no place Id rather be  
Yeah they mock me because I stand out  
But I aint never had to take a handout  
And if the good Lords willin Im a keep on chillin refillin and flyin
high
