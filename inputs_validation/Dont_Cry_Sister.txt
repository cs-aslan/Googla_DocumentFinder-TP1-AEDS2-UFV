Dont cry sister cry itll be alright in the morning  
Dont cry sister cry everythingll be just fine  
Dont cry sister cry itll be alright I tell you no lie  
Dont cry sister cry dont do it dont do it  
  
When old man trouble knocks on your door  
Dont give him no key he just wants more  
Hell turn your life to misery  
Kick you down just like me  
  
Dont cry sister cry itll be alright itll be alright  
Dont cry sister cry everythingll be just fine  
  
Woke downhearted and you feel so bad  
Somebody wants something of nothing you had  
Love dont come too easy you see  
A little bit of you and a little bit of me  
  
Dont cry sister cry itll be alright itll be alright  
Dont cry sister cry everythingll be just fine  
Everythingll be just fine  
Everythingll be just fine  
  
Dont cry sister cry dont do it dont do it  
Dont cry sister cry dont do it dont do it
