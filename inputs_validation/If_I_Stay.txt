Theres too much light in this room  
But soon the moon will be gone from view  
Theres too much fight til we bruise  
One step from saying goodbye to you  
  
And maybe its my heart thats holding out holding out  
I know that the spark is blowing out blowing out  
Maybe its the darkness all around all around  
Tore this love apart what happens now  
  
If I stay will you hold me again  
If I stay to forgive and forget  
If I lay my defenses down on the floor  
If we come to our senses and love like before  
Will you say will you say that its not too late if I stay  
  
My bags are packed in a row  
Dont think Im ready to let you go now  
This hurts me more than you know  
The sound of silence before the showdown  
  
Maybe its my heart thats holding out holding out  
I know that the spark is blowing out blowing out  
Maybe its the darkness all around all around  
Tear this love apart or stand my ground  
  
If I stay will you hold me again  
If I stay to forgive and forget  
If I lay my defenses down on the floor  
If we come to our senses and love like before  
Will you say will you say that its not too late  
  
If I stay right here hold you forever  
For a thousand years for worse or for better  
We cant stop now well make it together someway  
If I stay ooh if I stay  
  
If I stay will you hold me again  
If I stay to forgive and forget  
If I lay my defenses down on the floor  
If we come to our senses and love like before  
Will you say will you say that its not too late if I stay
