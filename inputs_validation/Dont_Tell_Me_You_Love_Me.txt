Im holding on to the past  
Im trying turn back time  
I never though I will see the day  
When you hood not be mine  
Oh Oh  
Holding on to the memories  
So clear in my minds  
Getting by on a make believe  
But I got to start baby this life  
Oh No tell me you love me  
When you dont even care  
And dont say that youll always  
Be there for me  
cause I know that you wanna be free  
  
Im thinking what were wrong  
Im trying to blame myself  
When you turn and you walked away  
Tell me you just want some else  
Ooooh loneliness is a friend of my  
Yea but I liked that way  
If you can stand the testing time  
When you know I wont ask you to stay  
  
Dont tell me you love me  
When you dont even care  
And dont say that you always  
Be there for me  
cause I know that you wanna be free  
  
Oh oh oh how can I make you believe  
This not is dying  
How can I make you believe  
I got my crying for you  
Crying for you  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Mmmm oh baby  
Oh dont tell me you love  
When you dont even care  
And dont say that youll always be there  
For me cause I know that you wanna be free
