Hello girl  
Youre good to see  
Love your face shinin down on me  
Hows it feel with the warm winds blowin  
  
Hello girl  
Youre good to know  
Love your smile I love your glow  
Hows it feel with the warm winds blowin  
  
CHORUS  
Must have touched the right part of me  
The sun in your eyes  
You came running in from the start  
Connected all the right numbers  
In the picture you were painting of me  
  
Listen girl  
I cant let go  
The time is right I have to know  
Whats it like when the fire is burning  
  
CHORUS  
  
SOLO  
  
CHORUS 2 times
