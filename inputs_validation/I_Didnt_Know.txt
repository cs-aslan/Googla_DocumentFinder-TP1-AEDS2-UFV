I didnt know  
I didnt know  
Well I didnt like cheeseburger alleycats near me  
A petrified Phish disease  
I wish somebodyd hear me  
I didnt like maple dew honey melon watercress  
I didnt like Phish shoes down by muddy watermelon  
I didnt seem to miss you when you kissd my honey water  
And even showed a picture showed her down by honeys border  
But who laid silver tooth and broke my sunny shoe shine  
And all my plastic melodreams are waiting for their new shine  
Pardon me Doug pardon me Doug  
Is this a picture of Otis Redding  
Yes Yes Taken right before he died  
Well you can give me his hide  
well you can give me his hide  
I didnt know  
  
I didnt know that I was that far gone 8x  
Well I woulda liked to seen Bess Truman come see me  
and hear all the revolutionaries come free me  
cause if it all ends up running to sneeze me  
Ill make it all here black corners come seize me  
and if you boom back got troubles in your ear  
and you cant seem to come back and make it all clear  
when eye tails and toe nails and liquid all meet me  
when mustard pies and carrot eyes and flounders come greet me  
I didnt know  
  
I didnt know that I was that far gone 8x
