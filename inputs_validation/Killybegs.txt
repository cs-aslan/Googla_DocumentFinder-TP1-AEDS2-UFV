My heart was warm with family love as I slipped into a  
Chair  
beside my uncle john my daughters cross the table there  
Id walked the docks in misty rain a pain was in my legs  
but Id seen the dream of kinsmen in the boats of Killybegs  
  
the banter of my uncle and my daughters filled the air and  
The  
gunning brothersDonegalers next to us were glad that we  
Were there  
I was kind of quiet listening at the window ledge  
for the music of the harbor the birds of Killybegs  
  
down the coast not far was Galway land of joys Joyce and  
Kinnamar  
at their after supper and asleep we would visit be  
Goin there tomorrow  
I worried if my words would eer be sung by Irishmen  
or out rot here on the docks  
like the fish of Killybegs  
  
a radio was playing though we never heard a word I dont  
Think this phrase is right  
but the rhythm of the music was familiar if absurd  
and harkning  
a heightening intensity for silence did I beg  
oh what a song was playing in the air of Killybegs  
  
I couldnt quite believe it for it sounded rather strange  
the instruments were different and the key had been changed  
I reached to turn the volume up then teetered on my legs  
A girl from Tipperary sang my song in Killybegs  
a girl from Tipperary sang my song in Killybegs
