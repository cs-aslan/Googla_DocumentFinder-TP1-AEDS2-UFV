When the moon lays his head on a pillow  
And the stars settle down for a rest  
Just do me one small favour I beg you  
Please play me my babys request  
  
Its the song that we heard when we started  
Now the birds have all flown from our nest  
But you could bring back memries departed  
By playing my babys request  
  
My baby said  
That she knows how it goes  
But youre the one who really knows  
So go ahead  
Just one more time and then well go to bed  
  
But you could bring back memries departed  
By playing my babys request  
  
My baby says  
That she knows how it goes  
But youre the one who really knows  
So go ahead  
Just one more time and then well go to bed  
  
When the moon lays his head on a pillow  
And the stars settles down for a rest  
Just do me one small favour I beg you  
Please play me babys request  
Mmmm play me babys request  
Please play me my babys request  
  
One more time
