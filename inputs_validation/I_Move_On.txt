Catherine ZetaJones While truckin down  
The road of life  
Although all hope seems gone  
I just move on  
  
Renee Zellweger When I cant find a single star  
To hang my wish upon  
I just move on  
I move on  
  
Catherine ZetaJones I run so fast  
A shotgun blast  
Can hurt me not one bit  
  
Renee Zellweger Im on my toes Cause heaven knows  
A movin targets hard to hit  
  
Both So as we play  
An exballet  
Were not the dyin swan  
We just move on  
We move on  
  
Renee Zellweger Just when it seems  
Were out of dreams  
And things have got us down  
  
Catherine ZetaJones We dont despair  
We dont go there  
We hang our bonnets out of town  
  
Both So theres no doubt  
Were well cut out  
To run lifes marathon  
We just move on  
We just move on  
  
So light of foot  
We cant stay put  
We just move on  
  
Yes we move on
