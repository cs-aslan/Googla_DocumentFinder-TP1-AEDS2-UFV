We agreed that it was over  
Now the lines have all been drawn  
The vows we made began to fade  
But now theyre gone  
Put your pictures in a shoebox  
And my gold ring in a drawer  
Im not supposed to love you anymore  
  
Now Sherri says she jealous  
Of this freedom that Ive found  
If she were me she would be  
Out on the town  
And she says she cant imagine  
What on earth Im waiting for  
Im not supposed to love you anymore  
  
Oh I shouldnt care or wonder where and how you are  
But I cant hide this hurt inside my broken heart  
Im fighting back emotions that Ive never fought before  
Cause Im not supposed to love you anymore  
  
Now Im writing you this letter  
And its killing me tonight  
That I agreed when you believed  
It wasnt right  
And I couldnt sleep up on the bed  
So Im down here on the floor  
Where Im not supposed to love you anymore  
  
Oh I shouldnt care or wonder where and how you are  
But I cant hide this hurt inside my broken heart  
Im fighting back emotions that Ive never fought before  
Cause Im not supposed to love you anymore  
  
Im fighting back emotions that Ive never fought before  
Cause Im not supposed to love you anymore
