Changing horses in the middle of a stream  
Gets you wet and sometimes cold  
Changing faces in the middle of a dream  
Gets you old  
Oh gets you old  
  
Looking farther than youll ever hope to see  
Takes you places you dont know  
Search for someone you cant ever hope to be  
And still you go  
Oh still you go  
  
Dont you think its kind of sad to say  
Dont you think its gonna change  
Makes you think youll have to stay inside  
For a while  
  
Changing horses in the middle of a stream  
Gets you wet and sometimes cold  
Changing faces in the middle of a dream  
Gets you old
