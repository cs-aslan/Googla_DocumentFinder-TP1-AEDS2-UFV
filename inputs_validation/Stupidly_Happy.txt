Im stupidly happy  
Everythings fine  
Im stupidly happy  
My heart pumping wine  
Im stupidly happy  
With idiot grin  
Im stupidly happy  
You wont catch me in  
  
All the birds of the air call your name as they land on my kitchen roof  
All the fish in the sea do the same if you need extra proof  
  
Im stupidly happy  
My vision is skewed  
Im stupidly happy  
Im coming unscrewed  
  
And if the Devil walks up dressed in any disguise  
I take him by the collars look him in the eye  
Im stupidly happy  
Now youre my defense  
Im stupidly happy  
Its all making sense  
  
Im stupidly happy  
I roll like a train  
Im stupidly happy  
With you in my brain  
  
All the lights of the cars in the town form the strings of a big guitar  
Im a giant to play you a tune for wherever you are  
Im stupidly happy  
Are the words to that song  
Im stupidly happy  
And nothing is wrong  
And should the Devil walk up with his business card out  
Ill tear it to confetti with a grin and shout  
Im stupidly happy  
All of the time  
Im stupidly happy  
Now youre mine
