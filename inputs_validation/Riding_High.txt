Youve been riding  
Youve been riding quite a while child  
Keep on riding keep on riding  
Youve been jiving  
Like a peacock thats your style  
Keep on jiving oh keep on jiving  
  
Now I remember the days in school  
There wasnt a time when you didnt treat me cruel  
Ooh wait till I get my hooks on you  
Ill show you what a fisherman can do  
  
Youre riding  
Been riding quite a while child  
keep on riding keep on riding  
Youve been jiving  
Like a peacock thats your style  
Keep on jiving oohwee keep on jiving  
  
I say now you always try to hurt me in the end  
In the presence of all our good good friends  
But the patient man always win  
Now Ill just wait till you give in  
  
Youve been riding  
Youve been riding quite a while  
keep on riding keep on ride keep on riding  
Youve been jiving  
Like a peacock thats your style  
keep on jiving ohwee alright on jiving  
  
At Christmas more like an Easter bunny  
Just like a rabbit youre always on the run  
But wait till I get my trap on you  
Ill see where you gonna run to  
Wait till I get my trap on you  
Then Ill see where you gonna run to  
  
Youve been riding  
Youve been riding quite a while  
keep on riding keep on ride keep on riding  
Youve been jiving  
Like a peacock thats your style  
keep on jiving oohwee keep on jiving  
  
So riding on my own I need your love tonight  
Riding on my own Awhen you hold me right
