La femme accidents  
Got everything you want  
You never have to know  
Shes hanging on your every word  
  
She clings to your heart  
She wont let you depart  
Oh this mine  
But shes with you all the time  
Shes crying like a fragile child  
  
But if you get to know her  
Shes not a little girl  
And if she gets to know you  
You cant escape her world  
  
La femme accident  
A woman full of want  
Her hearts on the line  
You havent go the time  
She suffers like some joan of arc  
  
She says theres just no justice  
In this world  
Shes paradise for a day  
  
La femme accident  
What reason could you want  
Just use her and turn away  
  
La femme accident  
Got everything you want  
Shes paradise for a day
