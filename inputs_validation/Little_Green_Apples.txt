Well I wake up in the morning  
With my hair down in my eyes  
And she says hi  
And I hurry to the breakfast table  
While the kids are going off to school goodbye  
And she reaches out and takes my hand  
And squeezes it and says how you feelin Hon  
And I look across at smiling lips that warm my heart  
And I see my morning sun  
And if thats not loving me  
Then all Ive got to say  
  
God didnt make little green apples  
And it dont rain in Indianapolis in the summertime  
Theres no such thing as Dr Suess  
Disneyland and Mother Goose no nursery rhyme  
God didnt make little green apples  
And it dont rain in Indianapolis in the summertime  
And when my self is feeling low  
I think about your face aglow and ease my mind  
  
Sometimes I call him up knowing hes busy  
And ask if he could get away and meet me  
And maybe grab a bite to eat  
And he drops what hes doing and hurrys down to meet me  
And Im always late  
He sits waiting patiently and smiles when he first sees me  
Because hes made that way  
And if thats not loving me  
Then all Ive got to say  
  
God didnt make little green apples  
And it dont snow in Indianapolis when the winter comes  
Theres no such thing as make believe  
Puppy dogs and autumn leaves no BB guns  
God didnt make little green apples  
And it dont rain in Indianapolis in the summer time  
And when my self is feeling low  
I think about your face aglow and ease my mind
