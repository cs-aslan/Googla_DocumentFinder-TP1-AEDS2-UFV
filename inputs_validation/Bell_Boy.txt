Keiths theme  
The beach is a place where a man can feel  
Hes the only soul in the world thats real  
Well I see a face coming through the haze  
I remember him from those crazy days  
  
Aint you the guy who used to set the paces  
Riding up in front of a hundred faces  
I dont suppose you would remember me  
But I used to follow you back in 63  
  
Ive got a good job and Im newly born  
You should see me dressed up in my uniform  
I work in hotel all gilt and flash  
Remember the place where the doors were smashed  
  
Bell Boy I got to keep running now  
Bell Boy Keep my lip buttoned down  
Bell Boy Carry this baggage out  
Bell Boy Always running at someones heel  
You know how I feel always running at someones heel  
  
Some nights I still sleep on the beach  
Remember when stars were in reach  
Then I wander in early to work  
Spend the day licking boots for my perks  
  
A beach is a place where a man can feel etc  
  
People often change  
But when I look in your eyes  
You could learn a lot from  
A job like mine  
The secret to me  
Isnt flown like a flag  
I carry it behind  
This little badge  
What says  
  
Bell Boy
