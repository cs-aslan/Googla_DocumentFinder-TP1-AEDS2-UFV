Before the tears Ive cried  
Have even dried  
Shell be with him  
Theyll look in each others eyes  
And with her lips still warm with lies  
Shell kiss him  
  
And though she knows shes wrong  
She just keeps on  
Keepin me hangin on  
Tell me  
  
Chorus  
Whats a man to do  
When the one hes promised to  
Finds somebody new  
Should I just stand by  
Watch the love Ive lived for die  
Lord I wish I knew  
Tell me whats a man to do  
  
Maybe Ill make a stand  
Or should I just wash my hands  
Of her forever  
But Ive never been alone  
Except for here at home  
When theyre together  
  
And though I know its wrong  
I let her go on  
Keepin me hangin on  
  
Chorus
