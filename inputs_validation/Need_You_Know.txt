Picture perfect memories  
Scattered all around the floor  
Reaching for the phone cause I cant fight it anymore  
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind  
For me it happens all the time  
  
Its a quarter after one Im all alone and I need you now  
Said I wouldnt call but I lost all control and I need you now  
And I dont know how I can do without I just need you now  
  
Another shot of whiskey cant stop looking at the door  
Wishing youd come sweeping in the way you did before  
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind  
For me it happens all the time  
  
Its a quarter after one Im a little drunk  
And I need you now  
Said I wouldnt call but I lost all control and I need you now  
And I dont know how I can do without I just need you now  
  
Yes Id rather hurt than feel nothing at all  
Its a quarter after one Im all alone and I need you now  
And I said I wouldnt call but Im a little drunk and I need you now  
And I dont know how I can do without I just need you now  
I just need you now  
Oh baby I need you now
