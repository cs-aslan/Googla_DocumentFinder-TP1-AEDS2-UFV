If it takes them so long  
So long to say yes  
Why dont they just say no  
They dont need anyone to be put to the test  
Why dont they let us go  
  
Livin for the right to be livin for the right  
Livin for the right to be livin for the right  
Livin for the right to be free  
  
We needed a plan we needed defenses  
We couldnt raise a smile  
As the world looked on they raided our senses  
There can be no reconcile  
  
Burning down burning down burning down burning down  
  
There was a time before life was taken for granted  
Will never come again  
Our flower is dead the seed is unplanted  
They put it all to flame  
  
Burning down burning down burning down burning down  
  
Livin for the right to be livin for the right  
Livin for the right to be livin for the right  
Livin for the right to be free  
Livin for the right to be livin for the right  
Livin for the right to be livin for the right  
Livin for the right to be free  
  
Burning down burning down  burning down  burning down
