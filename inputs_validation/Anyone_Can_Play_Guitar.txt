Destiny destiny protect me from the world  
Destiny hold my hand protect me from the world  
Here we are with our running and confusion  
And I dont see no confusion anywhere  
  
And if the world does turn  
And if London burns  
Ill be standing on the beach with my guitar  
I want to be in a band  
When I get to heaven  
Anyone can play guitar and they wont  
Be a nothing anymore  
  
Grow my hair grow my hair I am Jim Morrison  
Grow my hair I want to be want to be want to be Jim Morrison  
  
Here we are with our running and confusion  
And I dont see no confusion anywhere  
  
As the world does turn  
And if London burns  
Ill be standing on the beach with my guitar  
I want to be in a band  
When I get to heaven  
Anyone can play guitar and they wont  
Be a nothing anymore
