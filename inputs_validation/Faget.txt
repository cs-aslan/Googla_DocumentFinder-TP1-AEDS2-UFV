Here I am different in this normal world  
Why did you tease me Made me feel upset  
Fucking stereotypes feeding their heads  
I am ugly  
Please just go away  
I can see inside you fine  
This blessing in disguise  
Why you treat me this way  
Make the hate stay  
A cell locked I can never see no escape  
All the laughing all the pain  
If you were me what would you do  
Nothing probably  
Youd just go on your way  
Fagot  
  
Im just a pretty boy whatever you call it  
You wouldnt know a real man if you saw it  
It keeps going on day after day son  
You fake if you dont want none  
Im sick and tired of people treating me this way everyday  
Who gives a fuck right now I got something to say to all the people  
That think  
  
Im strange and I should be out of here locked up in a cage  
You dont know what the hell is up now anyway  
You got this prettyboy feeling like Im enslaved to a world that  
Never appreciated shit  
You can suck my dick and fucking like it  
Hear my gun but he has a body mighty  
  
Any say anyway going to say anyway any say  
Going away going to say anyway  
Im just a pretty boy Im not supposed to fuck a girl  
Im just a pretty boy living in this fucked up world  
All my life who am I  
  
Im just a fagot  
Fagot  
Im a fagot  
Fagot  
Im not a fagot  
Or am I  
Fagot  
You motherfucking queers
