They open my window In comes the light  
I froze in the corner I pray for the night  
But if its you my dear who turns on the light  
Ill eat from your hands as a bird with no fear no no  
Fear  
Because I adore you  
I adore you  
I adore you  
I adore you  
Rise up my dark star Face into the night  
Come out of your corner Shine for the night  
If its you my love who turns on the light  
Ill eat from your hands as a bird with no fear no no  
Fear  
Because I adore you  
I adore you  
I adore you  
I adore you  
I adore you  
I adore you  
Climb out of the shadows Crawl into the night  
Fall out of the window Die to the night  
If its you my love who turns on the light  
Ill eat from your hands as a bird with no fear no no  
Fear  
Because I adore you
