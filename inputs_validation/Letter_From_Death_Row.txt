Sitting here in my cell writing a letter  
Thanking all the people who made my living conditions better  
  
And thanks to the justice system  
Im making a million  
My lawyer got me a book deal  
Now Im making a killing just from making a killing  
  
I got an agent for the publicity  
An accountant to count my royalties  
The talk shows want me sorry I cant go  
Im stuck here on death row  
  
You call me hannibal lechter if I was smarter  
If I was charlie manson youd make me a martyr wouldnt ya  
Youd call me a handsome man if I was bundy  
But if I looked like john wayne gasey youd just say Im funny not ha ha
funny  
  
Chorus  
Tried to act my career just flopped  
Killed my neighbor got on cops  
Problem is I only made one show now  
Im stuck here on death row  
  
The poor victims families never make a dime  
Networks say Im not prime time  
All my cell mates on my cell block  
Say Im the hottest topic at the coffee shops  
  
Waitress cries god how they should free me  
Send me her love letters says someday shed really love to meet me  
Tells her customers people should forgive me for the things I do  
I wonder if I kill her would her family forgive me too  
  
Chorus  
Thanks for the attention and the publicity  
The taxpayers dollars that you spend on me  
Thanks for the good meal dry bed and these warm clothes  
Im alive and well on death row
