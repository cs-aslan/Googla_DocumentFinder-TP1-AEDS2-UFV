When the day falls where do you go  
Six thirty city windows dirty  
Office nightclubs drinks dates and movie stubs  
Be wary all secretaries  
And eyes roam for who takes who home  
As the rains coming down to Friday night  
Dont let me down again  
  
Passport pictures with charts and figures  
Daily nightly Oh like me tightly  
When the day falls where do you go  
Ten thirty like me tightly  
  
And eyes roam for who takes who home  
As the rains coming down to Friday night  
Dont let me down again  
  
Dont let me down again
