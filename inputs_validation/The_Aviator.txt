Riding on the moonpath  
In the silver of the night  
The fragrance on the air  
Was of another time  
I cried in all my innocence  
You were dressed in white  
And even if Id had the strength  
I couldnt move to save my life  
  
The fear and the thrill  
Of the beast at the window  
The shivers and the chills  
On the hottest of nights  
He walked right through  
My open door  
As I began to run he threw  
Some gold upon the floor and said  
Theres plenty more  
Where that came from  
  
Im tired of the bombs  
Im tired of the bullets  
Im tired of the crazies on TV  
Im the aviator  
A dreams a dream whatever it seems  
  
I flew along the lighted street  
I flew above the town  
I flew in ever rising circles  
Ever further from the ground  
As I begin to lose my breath  
Printed faxes turn a spin  
A distant corner of the room  
Will open up and let me in  
  
Im tired of the news  
Im tired of the weather  
Im tired of the same thing every day  
Im the aviator  
A dreams a dream whatever they say
