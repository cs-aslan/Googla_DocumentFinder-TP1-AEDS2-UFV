I aint livin here no more I aint even keepin score  
Its too late to change its over Im drownin in a sea of tears  
Nothin I can say to you makes any difference  
There aint nothin I can do none of its makin sense  
  
Chorus  
  
Standing on the outside Im lookin in at you standing on the outside  
Standing on the outside Im running out of time standing on the outside  
  
Im so tired of bein alone in a world that feels so cold  
Theres got to be a light that I can find  
Theres got to be a soul somewhere that shines for me  
  
Now I dont want to live without love anymore I just want to live my life  
Loves gonna open up the door show me its light again  
  
Chorus  
  
Nothin I can say to you makes any difference  
There aint nothin I can do none of its makin sense  
  
Standing on the outside Im lookin in at you standing on the outside  
Standing on the outside what can I do standing on the outside  
Standing on the outside Im lookin in at you  
Standing on the outside yes Im lookin in at you  
Standing on the outside Im lookin in at you
