Coffer cafes dizzy with city lights concrete sidewalks busy with friendly
fights  
But thats alright baby its alright come go with me and you will see city
life city life  
Loud paper boys yelling yesterdays news a pedlar man selling what you cant
use  
Thats alright baby its alright come go with me you will see city life
city life  
  
I need you when the sun goes down you pick me up when youre around  
Come on come on now we can have a good time this town aint much unless
youre here with me  
Its like a woman crazy just like a puppy lazy  
Just like a pretty jealous wife I cant get free from city life  
  
Secluded bars humming behind the scenes hot wild guitars strumming promising
dreams  
Thats alright baby its alright come go with me and you will see city life
city life  
I dont want to be alone stay with me now dont go home  
Its a date well stay out late and party city lifes okay when youre with
me  
  
Its like a lion sleeping just like a willow weeping  
A melting pot for fun and strife cant get away from city life  
City life baby city life its alright baby its alright city life city
life
