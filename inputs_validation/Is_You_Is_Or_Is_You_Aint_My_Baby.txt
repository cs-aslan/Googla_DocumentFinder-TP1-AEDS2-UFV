I got a gal whos always late  
Anytime we have a date  
But I love her yes I love her  
  
Mmm hes gonna walk up to my gate  
And see if he can get it straight  
Cause he wants her hes gonna ask her  
  
Is you is or is you aint my baby  
The way youre actin lately makes me doubt  
Yous is still my baby baby  
Seems my flame in your hearts done gone out  
  
A woman is a creature that has always been strange  
Just when youre sure of one you find shes gone and made a change  
  
Is you is or is you aint my baby  
Maybe babys found somebody new  
Or is my baby still my baby true  
  
Is you or is you aint my baby baby  
Baby boy the way youre actin lately makes me doubt  
See here whos been cuttin me  
Yous is still my baby baby  
Baby boy it seems my flame in your hearts done gone out  
Oh blackout  
  
A woman is a creature that has always been strange  
Just when youre sure of one you find shes gone and made a change  
And took my change  
  
Is you is or is you aint my baby  
Maybe babys found somebody new  
Maybe babys found somebody  
Is my baby still my baby true
