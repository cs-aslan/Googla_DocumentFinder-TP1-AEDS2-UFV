Come stumble my mirth beaten worker  
Im Jezmund the family berzerker  
Im bought for the price of a flagon of rice  
The wind buffs the cabin  
You speak of your life  
Or more willingly Locust the Lurker  
  
Confuse what you can of the ending  
And revise your despise so impending  
Cause I soak on the wrath  
That you didnt quite mask  
Im getting it clearly through alternate paths  
Or mixed in with the signal youre sending  
  
But who can unlearn all the facts that Ive learned  
As I sat in their chairs and my synapses burned  
And the torture of chalk dust collects on my tongue  
Thoughts follow my vision and dance in the sun  
All my vasoconstrictors they come slowly undone  
Cant this wait till Im old  
Cant I live while Im young  
  
But no peace for Jezmund tonight  
I plug the distress tube up tight  
And watch what I say as it flutters away  
And all this emotion is kept harmless at bay  
Not to educate somebodys fright
