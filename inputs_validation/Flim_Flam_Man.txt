Hands off the man  
Flim flam man  
His mind is up his sleeve  
And his talk is make believe  
  
Oh Lord the mans a fraud  
Hes a flim flam man  
Hes so cagey  
Hes a flim flam man  
  
Hands off the man  
Flim flam man  
Hes the one in the Trojan Horse  
Making out like hes Santa Claus  
  
Oh Lord the mans a fraud  
Hes a flim flam man  
Hes a fox  
Hes a flim flam man  
  
Everybody wants him  
The people and the police  
And all the pretty ladies disarmed  
  
Oh oh yeah the beautiful gent  
You know he has hardly a cent  
He pays his monthly rent  
With the daily charm  
  
Hands off the man  
Flim flam man  
His mind is up his sleeve  
And his talk is make believe  
  
Oh Lord the mans a fraud  
Hes a flim flam man  
Hes an artist  
Hes a flim flam man  
  
Hes so cagey  
Hes a flim flam men  
Hes a fox  
Shes a fool  
Flim flam man  
  
Oh dont worry  
Hes dishonest  
So dont believe him  
Hes a flim flam man  
  
Oh hes so cagey  
Hes a flim flam man
