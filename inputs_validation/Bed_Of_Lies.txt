Do you ever think of me when you lie  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies  
And I knew better than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend you will be mine  
And you know how you made me believe  
You had me caught in every web that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me when you lie  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies  
  
Verse 1 Nicki Minaj  
You could never make eye contact  
Everything you got was based off of my contacts  
You a fraud but Imma remain iconstat  
Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap  
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it  
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil in it  
Put you in the crib and you aint never pay a bill in it  
I was killin it man you got me poppin pills in it  
I told Baby hit you I said this nigga buggin  
Cause I was doing it for us I told em fuck the public  
Couldnt believe that I was home alone contemplating  
Overdosin no more coastin no more toastin over oceans  
They say you dont know what you got til its gone  
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn  
But there was something that I shouldve asked all along  
Imma ask on the song

Verse 2 Nicki Minaj  
I just figured if you saw me if you looked in my eyes  
Youd remember our connection and be freed from the lies  
I just figured I was something that you couldnt replace  
But there was just a blank stare and I couldnt relate  
I just couldnt understand and I couldnt defend  
What we had what we shared and I couldnt pretend  
When the tears roll down its like you aint even notice em  
If you had a heart I was hoping you wouldve showed it some  
What the fuck you really telling me what you telling me  
I could tell you lying get the fuck out dont yell at me  
I aint mean to cut you I aint wanna catch a felony  
This aint How To Be A Player you aint Bill Bellamy  
They say you dont know what you got til its gone  
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn  
But there was something that I shouldve asked all along  
Imma ask on the song  
  
Bridge Skylar  
So does she know Ive been in that bed before  
A thousand count and not a single threaded truth  
If I was just another girl  
Then Im ashamed to say that Im not over you  
Theres one thing I need to know  
So call me when youre not so busy just thinking of yourself  
  
Outro Skylar  
Do you ever think of me when you lie  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies  
And I knew better than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend you will be mine  
And you know how you made me believe  
You had me caught in every web that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me when you lie  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies
