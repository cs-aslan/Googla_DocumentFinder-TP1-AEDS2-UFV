ZRo  
My life is like a mercy game ducking and dodging crooked cops  
On a mission fishing for feddy ready to make a knot  
Im use to having less and I just cant deal with the stress  
And it seems like everywhere I go another nigga want to test  
Brother dont disrespect yourself and get yourself up in a vine  
Cause Im a maniac with a mac and a black backpack  
Smoking up on the urban fat sack Im trying to keep from going off  
But niggas be trying to make me starve when I need groceries in my house  
Wicked niggas say they be friends but end up trying to kill your friends  
Always turn to foes thats saying its over millions  
Dealing with dirty niggas on a daily basis  
Dont really want to fuck with em but see they baby faces  
I gotta survive  
Chorus  2x  
Let me live my life nigga dont fuck with me  
To deal out these deeds then you die  
And when its my time hope I dont cry  
ZRo  
Living in the ghetto day by day  
Im bumping trying to make a profit cause I gotta get my pay  
You better keep watching me and  
Pretty soon youll see man  
That Im a real rich nigga from the Houston streets  
Fried out licking looking for something to eat  
Im on a mission whipping birds like they stole something  
Pain it make me want to roll something  
Im a soldier and Im outta my mind  
Voice mail beeping for days cause Im out on the grind  
Guess my daddy didnt love me cause he turned his back  
Therefor the streets is my people a nigga learned like that  
And I haaaad to get up and bleed the block  
And it dont stop  
Chorus  2x  
ZRo  
My nigga Herman Fisher doing fed time  
I remember like it was yesterday it made the headlines damn  
I had to start all over but it didnt matter cause I was a soldier  
Walking around with a king size chip on my shoulder  
Missing my mama while I Iay down on benches to sleep  
Snatching purses and hopping fences just to eat  
Still I maintain Im still in the same game chasing paper  
Bitch niggas be up in my business like oops Im erasing haters  
Im SUC for life KMJ until Im finished  
Like Popeye from the ghetto but a nigga dont need no spinach  
All I need is my Nina when I be flipping birds  
Cause all I have in this world is my balls and my word  
Chorus 4x
