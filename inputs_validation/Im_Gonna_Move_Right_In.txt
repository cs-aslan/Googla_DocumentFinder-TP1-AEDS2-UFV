Well shes straight and look like a lot of fun  
The bars open Im gonna go have a drink with everyone  
Walking downtown skies cant get any greater  
Havent got no money and I havent got a prayer  
Im gonna move right in x3  
After we hang a little were gonna have a little fun  
Gonna go shoot and kill and go knife everyone  
The bar looks like haven gonna have myself a drink  
Hey man dont you know I fell right in to the swing  
Im Gonna move right in x3 Yeah  
Gonna go uptown so I can get myself straight  
Gonna go see my mama see if I got myself a date  
Time is runnin out Im comin right down to the wire  
Gotta go do something to get myself higher  
Im gonna move right in x3 Hey
