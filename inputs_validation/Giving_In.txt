Will you walk me to the edge again  
Shaking lonely and I am drinking again  
Woke up tonight and no ones here with me  
Im giving in to you  
  
Take me under  
Im giving in to you  
Im dying tonight  
Im giving in to you  
Watch me crumble  
Im giving in to you  
Im crying tonight  
Im giving in to you  
  
Caught up in life  
Losing all my friends  
Family has tried to heal all my addictions  
Tragic it seems to be alone again  
Im giving in To you  
  
Take me under  
Im giving in to you  
Im dying tonight  
Im giving in to you  
Watch me crumble  
Im giving in to you  
Im crying tonight  
Im giving in to you  
  
I look forward to dying tonight  
Drink till Im myself lifes harder every day  
The stress has got me  
Im giving in  
Giving in  
Giving in now  
  
Take me under  
Im killing all the pain  
Im dying tonight  
Im sick of all this faith  
Watch me crumble  
Im killing all the pain  
Im crying tonight  
  
Im giving in to you  
Take me under  
Im giving in to you  
Im dying tonight  
Im giving in to you  
Take me under  
Im giving in to you  
Im dying tonight  
Im giving in to you
