When youre feeling low  
Hypodermics where you go  
When youre with yourself  
You wish you could be someone else  
  
Chorus  
Cant you see like you saw anymore  
Cant you feel like you felt before  
Cant you face anything anymore  
When lifes a waste  
Run away  
Your lifes a waste  
Run away  
  
Once you get a ride  
Doesnt matter where you lied  
Once you shoot it in  
Doesnt matter who youve been  
Youre reaching in but you dont know where to begin  
All your dance and song wont matter when youre gone
