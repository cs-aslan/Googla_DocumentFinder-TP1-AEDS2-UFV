Done the things I said I would  
Some of them were pretty good  
Suddenly they changed the game  
I only know its not the same no more  
I dont know what to do the rules I knew  
  
Aint it sad  
Aint it sad  
Aint it true  
Aint it true  
Aint it blue  
Aint it blue  
  
The life I live is pretty nice  
Of course I had to pay a price  
Lots of folks depend on me  
Crazy kind of slavery what for  
I dont know what to do the rules I knew  
  
Aint it sad  
Aint it sad  
Aint it true  
Aint it true  
Aint it blue  
Aint it blue  
Aint it blue  
  
Sometimes I want to walk away  
I felt like that just yesterday  
But then this song is in my head  
I try my best till Im dead and gone  
I dont know what to do the rules I knew  
  
Aint it sad  
Aint it sad  
Aint it true  
Aint it true  
Aint it blue  
Aint it blue  
Aint it blue
