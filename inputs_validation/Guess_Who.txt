Guess who  
Wheres the girl who hurt herself last night  
Guess who  
Didnt kiss you and thought she was right  
Everyone had told me  
Be careful when he holds me  
And I was  
  
Guess who  
Had to listen to all that she hears  
Guess who  
Has a pillow thats all wet with tears  
You were ohso tender  
But I wouldnt surrender  
Now youre gone  
  
I told my friends Hell never get my heart  
And when I kissed you  
Had to resist you  
Said Better go  
I hurt you so  
  
Wished you had stayed  
But I made you go away  
Guess who  
Tried to be much too cool yesterday  
Guess who  
Let the boy that she loves get away  
I never should have listened  
Cause now your love Im missin  
Its too late  
Woah its too late ahh ha  
  
I never should have listened  
Cause now your love Im missin  
Its too late  
Oh its too late  
Ah oh ah ah oh  
Its too late mmm
