Gotta black breast Chinese eyes  
Got an English brain thats gonna make me wise  
Got a long story that I wanna tell  
To a rhythm that I know so well  
Really got a lot of lovin that I wanna give  
Baby Im a mystery but you know I gotta live  
I tried another but she didnt want to know  
  
Take a hold now if you can  
Take a lesson from a hard lovin man  
Im a long way from where I wanna go  
Guess Ill stay awhile I really love you so  
Hows about another sip of all the wine you got  
Take a tip from me and give it here Ill drink the lot  
Im not a winey Im a puttin on a show  
  
You really really grab me but Ive gotta move  
Before they know Im here and spread the news  
Maybe in while when Ive moved around  
I can find a way to pay you back your twenty pounds  
Really got a lot of lovin that I wanna give  
Baby Im a mystery but you know I gotta live  
I tried another but she didnt want to know
