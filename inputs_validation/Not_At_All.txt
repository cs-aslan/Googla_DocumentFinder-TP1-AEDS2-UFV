Might say yes might say no  
Its like watching the river flow  
Might be shallow may be deep  
I wont lose any sleep no oh no  
Not at all will I take a fall for you  
Not at all cause you want it all  
And you try it on like a sad old song  
Dont you think its wrong  
How you carry on and on  
I wont worry I wont fret  
Are you really that lonely yet  
If you listen what you hear  
Is it somebody saying so oh no  
Not at all will I take a fall for you  
Not at all cause you want it all  
And you try it on like a sad old song  
Dont you think its wrong  
How you carry on and on  
Not at all will I take a fall for you  
Not at all cause you want it all  
And you try it on like a sad old song  
Dont you think its wrong  
How you carry on  
Not at all will I take a fall for you  
Not at all cause you want it all  
And you try it on like a sad old song  
Dont you think its wrong  
How you carry on  
Not at all
