Listen to the voice of Buddha  
Saying stop your sericulture  
Little people like your offspring  
Boiled alive for some gods stocking  
Buddhas watching Buddhas waiting  
  
Just because the kids an orphan  
Is no excuse for thoughtless slaying  
People dont forget this torture  
Just because you call her mother  
Doesnt mean that shes your better  
  
Once more with the voice of Buddha  
Hell say carry on your slaughter  
Who cares for the little children  
You may slice with no conviction  
Blind revenge on a blameless victim  
  
Listen to the voice of Buddha  
Saying stop your sericulture  
Hell say carry on your slaughter  
Who cares for the little children  
You may slice with no conviction  
Blind revenge on a blameless victim
