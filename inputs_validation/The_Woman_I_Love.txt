Maybe I annoy you with my choices  
Well you annoy me sometimes too with your voice  
But that aint enough for me  
To move out and move on  
Im just gonna love you like the woman I love  
  
We dont have to hurry  
You can take as long as you want  
Im holdin steady  
My hearts at home  
With my hand behind you  
I will catch you if you fall  
Im just gonna love you like the woman I love  
  
Sometimes the world can make you feel  
Youre not welcome anymore  
And you beat yourself up  
You let yourself get mad  
And in those times when you stop lovin  
That woman I adore  
You could relax  
Because babe I got your back  
I got you  
  
No I dont wish to change you  
You got it under control  
You wake up each day different  
Another reason for me to keep holdin on  
Im not attached to any way youre showing up  
Im just gonna love you like the woman I love  
Yeah Im gonna love you oh yeah  
Im gonna love you  
Youre the woman I love
