When I say I dont give a fuck  
I mean that yeah  
When them niggas brains is getting bust  
I done seen that yeah  
If a shipment was coming in  
I need a lot of that wodie  
I need a sixtyforty nigga  
And no chargin that wodie  
You done heard about Michael Jackson  
And shiggidy shit  
But you aint never heard about me  
When Im flissin a bitch  
Niggas shoulders gettin knocked  
Clean off of they head  
See that red dot comin from  
Me and my girlfriend  
Cause I wants mine  
I needs mine  
And Im about to get mine  
At these times  
Look lil daddy  
You aint got to worry about none of these other niggas  
You needs to be worried about when Juvi comin to get ya  
Look I make a phone call to the big dog  
Yall bitches better handle yall business before I hit yall  
Even though a nigga rich and I rock ice  
I still bust a nigga head on the block aright  
  
Chorus x2  
Its enemy turf that Im on  
So Ima play it how it go  
Cock the hollow points  
And tote my black calicoe  
My lil brother Weezy  
My big brother Juvi  
Four hit the blocks  
Strapped up with the Uzis  
  
What What La  
Gun for gun  
Eye for eye  
Better move yo wife and son  
Cause I ride or die  
Cash money Hot Boy  
Bless me when Im gone  
But until then load up the chrome cause its on  
I been bout it  
Put a four up in my lip and put my dirty up in the clip  
I drop the top and then I flip I hit his cock and make em flip  
And I be full of that trash  
I be the first one to jump out the jag bust at em fast  
Watch the bullets chop off the head  
And make em fall in the grass  
One move they all die  
Lil Weezy small frie  
Gorilla when its war time  
Yall better learn  
When this nigga shoot itll be all hell  
Well then let em burn  
Hold him for ransom hear him this morning  
Seven churn and I be damn if I let em go  
If I dont get my dough  
Then hell will be all blowin  
Till I RIP CMR I be  
I put it down for all my peeps  
Nigga Im HB for real  
  
Chorus x2  
  
All I know is the streets  
And how to strap up  
When its time shoot it  
Cock yo heaters  
Tie up yo bags  
Its time to do it  
Blaze the blunt  
Shut off the lights  
And cut down the music  
Roll down the windows  
Turn the corner  
And let loose with the  
If ya dont know now  
Then ya never will learn  
You ca play with Lil Wayne  
And yo block get burned  
You must love to go swimming  
Cause the water gets deeper  
See I bust you wide open  
And take ya daughter with me  
Here come the beat boy  
Shoot out the street lights  
Time to bring on the heat boy  
If you aint really wit it  
Then you better get back  
I open yo chest  
And make it look just like a wet cat  
This is a death trap  
Im a guerrilla and I mean it  
Leave ya head still in a beanin  
Not on the cement  
Calicoe steamin  
Red dot beamin  
Dressed up suspicious  
Play with Lil Weezy youll be dinner for the fishes  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Enemy Turf  
Time to strap up
