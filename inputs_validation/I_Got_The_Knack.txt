You got it  
You you you you got it  
You got it  
You got it  
You you you got it  
You got it  
Get up everybody and listen to this rhyme  
My name is Everlast and yo Im always on time  
I got what it takes to make this groove complete  
And when my DJ is cuttin hes never missin a beat  
Im down with the Syndicate and theyre down with me  
Im also down with Divine Bilal and Quincy D  
Tairrie B DJ Lethal and my brother cool Nick  
Kid Jazz Scratch Bango and Cutmaster Quick  
Ive worked hard and long to master this trade  
And to quote my other song yo Im just out to get paid  
So sleep on me now for my time will come  
Everlast lasts forever thats why Im number one  
I got the knack  
You got it  
You know I feel alright  
I got the knack  
You got it  
You know I feel alright  
I got the knack  
You got it  
You know I feel alright  
I got the knack  
You got it  
You know I feel alright  
Everlast is in effect  
Gettin big respect  
Then I collect big checks  
1s 5s 10s 20s  
100 gs and Im pullin honeys  
Left and right day and night  
You gotta see it to believe it its quite a sight  
Theyre all on my tip to get a sip  
Of this poetical performer thats fully equipped  
But Im out to get paid not to get laid  
All across the country my records gettin played  
On radio stations clubs and on tours  
And after every show I make three encores  
Sleep on me now for my time will come  
Everlast last forever thats why Im number one  
I got the knack  
You got it  
You know I feel alright  
I got the knack  
You got it  
You know I feel alright  
I got the knack  
You got it  
You know I feel alright  
I got the knack  
Ah yeah  
Hit me  
Alright  
Check this out  
Step up place your bet and Ill serve you fortune  
But first I must issue just one word of caution  
Dope lyric presentations are my sole notoriety  
Everlast is on the rise movin through society  
My voice is moist recitin choice vocals  
Respected worldwide and feared by locals  
Poppin junk out your punk mouth makin bets  
Its too late for regrets its time to pay your debts  
Evearelast is the name that I bear  
A poetic demigod with skin thats fair  
So sleep on me now for my time will come  
Everlast lasts forever thats why Im number one  
I got the knack  
You got it  
You know I feel alright  
I got the knack  
You got it  
You know I feel alright  
I got the knack  
You got it  
You know I feel alright  
I got the knack  
You got it  
You know I feel alright  
Now theres too many people in this world tryin to play me  
Like Im some kind of sucker constantly they disobey me  
Tellin me whats sellin what kinda records get charted  
Sound like him sound like her  but they all sound retarded  
Takin very little time to write down a rhyme  
Its confusing to see so many people so blind  
Some think that its a sellout rhymin to this beat  
But Everlast can take any groove and make it sound complete  
I got the knack
