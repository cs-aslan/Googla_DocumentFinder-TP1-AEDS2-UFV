Verse 1  
He was only 25  
Had an open heart and tender mind  
He sang through all the hymns he knew  
He was searching for a higher sign  
When his water was turned to wine  
All the darkness became light  
Babies and a patient wife  
They just werent enough to keep him high  
So he gave them up  
Just to fill his cup  
Every sip would make him feel alive  
No bones in his body were dry  
  
Chorus  
Its a tragedy  
Its a tragedy  
Its a tragedy  
Its a tragedy  
  
Verse 2  
Now hes finally coming around  
Hes got wrinkles and a crooked frown  
He holds back tears thinking of the years  
That the bottle had a long time down  
So hed sit and have another round  
Singing Hallelujah till he drowns  
  
Chorus  
Its a tragedy  
Its a tragedy  
Its a tragedy  
Its a tragedy  
Its a tragedy  
Its a tragedy
