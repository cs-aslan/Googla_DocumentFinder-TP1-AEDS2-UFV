No keyboards just Pearly Gates and a lot of sound pedals  
  
I have to go to my paroleboy  
To remember just who I am  
One thing else I dont enjoy is  
Forgetting her monogram  
She electrifies my physical mass  
She really turns me on  
  
Chorus  
My mind is gone  
My mind is gone  
  
She quite simply wrecks me  
She just tears me apart  
She screws me up and skewers me  
She made it quite an art  
She guts me like a hollowpoint  
She really turns me on  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah Billy  
I know what you mean  
  
Its the smell of the dress  
That made my mind a mess  
Its her chokin throat  
Really gets my goattee and amen  
Yes indeed  
She makes my head and heart bleed  
Been so long since I knocked some off  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Tell me about it
