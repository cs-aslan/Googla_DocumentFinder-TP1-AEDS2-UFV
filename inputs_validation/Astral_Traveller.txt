And in the ruins of the balloon  
Stood a man with glasses held high  
Wondering when to do it again  
Have another fly into the sky  
Somewhere flying high  
  
Astral travller leaving without her  
Wandering where lights go  
Leave out the body load  
  
Once in the air people who dare  
Get a great respect in being  
Astral travller  
Heavenly flight wondrous night  
And all the sights worth seeing  
Just believe in  
  
Astral travller leaving without her  
Wandering where lights go  
Leave out the body load
