Why should it matter how i feel  
This old romantic down at hill  
Then again if Id known the outcome sure youd win  
  
Illusion shattered made them real  
A night of magic fate is sealed  
Ran amok and you knocked my tiny world for six  
  
It wouldnt have made the slightest  blindest bit of difference  
  
Chorus  
All together now lets hear us pray  
Make it better now and savor the day  
Im all over save me darling  
  
I feel it deep down deep inside  
Can not believe were still alive  
That is good cause i did not mean you harm my love  
  
We took a shot at masquerade  
Came crashing down on loves parade  
We were young were so full of teen emotion then  
  
We couldnt have made the slightest blindest bit of difference  
  
Chorus x2  
  
We couldnt have made the slightest blindest bit of difference  
All together  
  
Chorus
