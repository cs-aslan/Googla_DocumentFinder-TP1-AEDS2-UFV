Oh I will be yours  
  
I dont know what to do  
I cant believe its true that  
You can make me feel this way  
I see it in your eyes  
It made me realize  
Theres something that Ive got to say  
  
Refrain  
I just wanna tell you that Im sorry  
For all the things Ive done to make you worry  
And all the time I cared for you from the bottom of my heart  
  
Chorus  
I will be yours if youll be mine  
I will be there til the end of time  
I will be with you until the day that I die  
Ill be yours I will be yours  
  
Ive been around the world  
And seen a lot of girls  
But no one can compare to you  
Its really plain to see  
That you belong to me  
Cause youre the only one I need  
  
Refrain  
  
Chorus  
  
I will be yours 2x  
  
Oh I will be yours  
  
Chorus  
  
I will be yours 2x
