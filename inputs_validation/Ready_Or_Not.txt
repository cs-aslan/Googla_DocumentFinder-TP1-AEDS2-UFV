Someones going to have to explain it to me  
Im not sure what it means  
My babys feeling funny in the morning  
Shes having trouble getting into her jeans  
Her waistline seems to be expanding  
Although she never feels like eating a thing  
I guess well reach some understanding  
When we see what the future will bring  
  
I met her in a crowded barroom  
One of those typical Hollywood scenes  
I was doing my very best Bogart  
But I was having trouble getting into her jeans  
I punched an unemployed actor  
Defending her dignity  
He stood up and knocked me through that barroom door  
And that girl came home with me  
  
Now babys feeling funny in the morning  
She says shes got a lot on her mind  
Nature didnt give her any warning  
Now shes going to have to leave her wild ways behind  
She says she doesnt care if she never spends  
Another night running loose on the town  
Shes gonna be a mother  
Take a look in my eyes and tell me brother  
If I look like Im ready  
  
I told her I had always lived alone  
And I probably always would  
And all I wanted was my freedom  
And she told me that she understood  
But I let her do some of my laundry  
And she slipped a few meals in between  
And the next thing I remember she was all moved in  
And I was buying her a washing machine  
  
My babys feeling funny in the morning  
She says shes got a lot on her mind  
Nature didnt give her any warning  
But shes feeling better about it all the time  
She says shes ready for some meaning  
After all of her running around  
Well bless my soul shes got a rockandroll band man  
Thinking bout settling down
