Well I asked an old truck driver  
About life out on the road  
If he does a lotta singing  
When hes bringing in his load  
If theres a pretty waitress crying for him  
Every hundred miles  
If he gets a lotta loving  
If he has a lot of smiles  
And I asked him if those trucking songs  
Tell about a life like his  
He said if you want to know the truth about it  
Heres the way it is  
All I do is drive drive drive  
Try to stay alive  
And keep my mind on my load  
Keep my eye upon the road  
I got nothin in common with any man  
Whos home every day at five  
All I do is drive drive drive drive drive drive drive  
Well we shared a cup of coffee  
Then I had to warm it up  
And his greasy fingers trembled  
As he held onto the cup  
And I said dont you hear a lot of music  
See a lot of sights  
But if youll tune into the Grand Ole Opry  
Saturday night  
I will dedicate you a trucking song  
To which you can relate  
He said you just do the singing  
And Ill do the driving mate  
All I do is drive drive drive  
Try to stay alive  
And keep my mind on my load  
Keep my eye upon the road  
I got nothin in common with any man  
Whos home every day at five  
All I do is drive drive drive drive drive drive drive  
If I can get the fuel  
Fuel
