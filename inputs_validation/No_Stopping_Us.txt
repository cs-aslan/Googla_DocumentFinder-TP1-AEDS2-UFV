Would it take a bakers dozen to get my point to you  
Would it take a half a pound to roll a joint for you  
Would it take some hailing marys so full of grace to get my sound to you  
Will you help me break it down and get on through  
  
Down to the other side  
Its easy of you only try  
Dont lie down on the job  
Because once we hit the top theres no stopping us  
  
Should I address all my letters to the well to be  
Should I say return to sender is just a well be done  
Should I better not it so personally if all the good loving is never received  
Baby if it was me well I wouldnt think twice  
  
No not I  
See its easy if you only try  
So dont lie down on the job  
Because once we hit the top theres no stopping us  
  
I will drive a thousand miles or Ill meet you at the station  
If only you would take a vacation from this thing you have created  
I promise to make it worth your while  
  
So cmon try Baby wont you try  
Its easy if you do not run  
I promise you youll have your fun  
Because once we hit the top weve just begun  
  
Theres no stopping us
