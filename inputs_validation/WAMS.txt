Im a young one  
Stuck in the box  
Of an old ones head  
When all the others were just stirring awake  
Im trying to trick myself to fall asleep again  
  
Whoa  
My heads in heaven  
My soles are in hell  
Lets meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well  
  
Chorus  
Hurry hurry  
You put my head in such a flurry flurry  
What makes you so special  
What makes you so special  
Im gonna leave you  
Im gonna teach you  
How were all alone  
How were all alone how were all alone  
  
Give me build me  
Its your club so let me in let me in oh  
Knowing how heartwarming  
It is inside your skin  
  
My heads in heaven  
My soles are in hell  
Lets meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh oh  
Hmm hmm  
  
Baby if you dont take your medication  
We wont sleep for days  
We wont sleep for days  
  
And Mama when we pray to the Lord  
Doesnt sit or stay  
Doesnt sit or stay  
  
We waste it all in the back of a long dark car  
And Im sunshine machine  
  
Uh I want to get stuck uh  
I want to get stuck  
And be  
In your memories  
Hmm oh
