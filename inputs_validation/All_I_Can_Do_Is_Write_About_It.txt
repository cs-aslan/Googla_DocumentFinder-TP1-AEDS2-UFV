Well this life that Ive lead has took me everywhere  
There aint no place I aint never gone  
But its kind of like the saying that you heard so many times  
Well there just aint no place like home  
Did you ever see a shegator protect her young  
Or a fish in a river swimming free  
Did you ever see the beauty of the hills of Carolina  
Or the sweetness of the grass in Tennessee  
And lord I cant make any changes  
All I can do is write em in a song  
I can see the concrete slowly creepin  
Lord take me and mine before that comes  
  
Do you like to see a mountain stream aflowin  
Do you like to see a young gun with his dog  
Did you ever stop to think about well the air your breathin  
Well you better listen to my song  
And lord I cant make any changes  
All I can do is write em in a song  
I can see the concrete slowly creepin  
Lord take me and mine before that comes  
  
Im not tryin to put down no big cities  
But the things they write about us is just a bore  
Well you can take a boy out of ol dixieland  
But youll never take ol Dixie from a boy  
And lord I cant make any changes  
All I can do is write em in a song  
I can see the concrete slowly creepin  
Lord take me and mine before that comes  
Cause I can see the concrete slowly creepin  
Lord take me and mine before that comes
