Look what I found in my beer  
A couple of dancing ladies and a ticket out of here  
Look what I found in my beer  
A start to being lonely and an end to my career  
  
Look what he found in his gin  
Lights looking lively when loves looking dim  
Look what he found in his gin  
Souls look heavy when personalitys thin  
  
Look what I found in the drum  
A lifelong beat and a replacement to the rum  
Look what I found in the guitar  
Another fellow thinker and a chauffeur to my heart  
  
Look what I found in the mic  
An end to screwedup drinking and a Paul I actually like  
Look what I found in my beer  
A free test drive for a heart I cannot steer  
Look what I found in my beer  
  
Look what I found in my drink  
A brain without a plughole and a sink without a think  
Look what I found in my drink  
A love you to the barmaid and a toofamiliar wink  
  
Look what we found in his booze  
The reflection of him and his children without shoes  
Look what we found in his booze  
This mornings jigsaw in a hill of last nights clues  
  
Look what I found in the drum  
A lifelong beat and a replacement to the rum  
Look what I found in the guitar  
Another fellow thinker and a chauffeur to my heart  
  
Look what I found in the mic  
An end to screwedup drinking and a Paul I actually like  
Look what I found in my beer  
A free test drive for a heart I cannot steer  
Look what I found in my beer  
  
Look what we found in the dance  
Look what Ive found in the song  
Low expectations in a large pile of cans  
It makes the drink seem weak  
The friendship strong
