Some people say that the fate of a man  
Is written down in the palm of his hand  
Others say they can see it all in the cards and how they fall  
I dont need my fortune told  
As long as Ive got you to hold  
I can live with the mystery as long as youre loving me  
  
Looking up at the stars tonight  
I cant read em but I love the light  
Heaven knows Im right where I want to be  
As long as youre loving me  
  
I dont need a crystal ball  
Wouldnt even want to know at all  
Ive got everything I need  
As long as youre loving me  
  
Who knows what tomorrow brings  
One day changes everything  
Im willing to wait and see  
As long as youre loving me  
  
Looking up at the stars tonight  
I cant read em but I love the light  
Heaven knows Im right where I want to be  
As long as youre loving me  
  
I dont need my fortune told  
As long as Ive got you to hold  
I can live with the mystery as long as youre loving me  
  
Ive got everything I need as long as youre loving me  
As long as youre loving me  
Oh as long as youre loving me
