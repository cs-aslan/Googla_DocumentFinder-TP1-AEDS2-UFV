Livin way up now in a penthouse high  
Our steaks are rare and our martinis dry  
Folks below they say it aint fair  
Hell with them I really dont care  
Joie de vivre mon amie  
Aint this the life  
Having a party on a big jet plane  
I got so drunk that I could feel no pain  
Hangin out in acapulco  
Drinkin rum and sniffin coco  
Pretty senorita look this way  
Dancing through the night  
Everythings alright  
Girlfriend and a wife  
Aint this the life aint this the life  
Aint this the life baby baby baby     
Tropical island in the deep blue sea  
The natives are friendly and the lobsters free  
Sipping cognac like a french king  
Plenty of room I own the whole thing  
Joie de vivre mon amie  
Aint this the life  
Think Ill go out now on a shopping spree  
Breakfast in new york dinner in parie  
Hangin out with lynn and suzie  
Have a massage and a jacausezi  
Climb into bed and see whats on tv  
Dancing through the night  
Everythings alright  
Girlfriend and a wife     
Aint this the life aint this the life  
Aint this the life tell me tell me tell me
