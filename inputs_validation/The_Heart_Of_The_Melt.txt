Theres me then theres you  
And I could dance with the puck  
In a telephone booth  
You said I dont give a fuck  
Besides enough about you  
And your Evils Banal  
Cause as soon as Joni says Blue  
Youre somewhere else somewhere else  
Theres me then theres you  
And I could not hear it yet  
From a telephone booth  
I do my hungover best  
And say enough about you  
And your representative hell  
I jump in when you do  
Like theres nowhere else  
And then of course theres the dorsal fin  
Closing in that you cannot outswim  
Its not him that I gotta outswim you said  
Just you you said just you  
And theres the heart of the melt  
Theres the narrowest flume  
Theres the somewhere else  
When Im with you  
Theres nowhere else  
Theres me then theres you  
Theres me then theres you  
You could not say enough  
If there were several yous  
That would not be enough  
Theres me then theres you  
Youre a beautiful you  
A beautiful you a beautiful you  
You could not say enough  
If there were several yous  
It would not be enough  
Were a beautiful two
