Cant breathe cant sleep crazy what you do to me  
Head is smokin feeling my heart is open  
So hazy but its alright you take me to the dark side  
Dangerous but Im fearless  
  
My eyes are blue but Im seeing red  
And I just cant shake you outta my head  
Maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe  
  
Im a little bit love drunk  
Ever get the feeling where youre miles away  
Everybodys looking at me walking stumbling  
Hardly talking mumbling going red in the face  
Promise Ive been drinkin only lemonade its all I take  
My hearts just on one about someone  
And Im a little bit love drunk  
  
Feelin so hot Im taking your clothes off  
Glasses steamed up Im dreaming that no one can see us  
  
Lying underneath the stars Jupiter hits on mars  
And it hits me so hard  
  
My eyes are blue but Im seeing red  
And I just cant shake you outta my head  
Maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe  
  
Im a little bit love drunk  
Ever get the feeling where youre miles away  
Everybodys looking at me walking stumbling  
Hardly talking mumbling going red in the face  
Promise Ive been drinkin only lemonade its all I take  
My hearts just on one about someone  
And Im a little bit love drunk  
  
Trippin on the floor  
Freaky love for sure  
Still I need you more  
You knock me down with those eyes  
And do it every time  
Cant shake you out of my mind  
  
Just a little bit love drunk heading the crowd  
And that will never be a hater that can bring us down  
Ive been slurring my words and I dont know what to say  
But its a feeling that I believe in never felt this way  
  
And I swear I dont even like anything  
They call me love drunk cuz Im far from tipsy  
They call me love drunk what are you doing to me  
They call me love drunk cuz Im far from tipsy  
  
My eyes are blue but Im seeing red  
And I just cant shake you outta my head  
Maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe  
  
Im a little bit love drunk  
Ever get the feeling where youre miles away  
Everybodys looking at me walking stumbling  
Hardly talking mumbling going red in the face  
Promise Ive been drinkin only lemonade its all I take  
My hearts just on one about someone  
And Im a little bit love drunk  
  
Im a little bit love drunk  
Im a little bit love drunk  
  
Im a little bit love drunk  
My eyes are blue but Im seeing red  
Im a little bit love drunk
