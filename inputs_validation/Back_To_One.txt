I see you there  
But you dont look right  
You got a ten mile stare  
In your eyes tonight  
Time aint fair  
Like it used to be  
  
Were all dressed up  
Nowhere to go  
We lost our way  
About halfway home  
And we hurt the ones  
Who get too close  
  
Dont look back  
Youll never find your way  
Theres a million different people  
Who break the same way  
When everything has come undone  
We got to bring it back to one  
Back to one  
Were all caught up  
In what used to be  
A grounded love  
And some memories  
Why do I hurt the ones  
Who get close to me  
Darling are you listening  
  
Dont look back  
Youll never find your way  
Theres a million different people  
Who break the same way  
Forget about the things weve done  
And bring it back to one  
More night  
Anothers on the way  
Were all a little different  
But break the same way  
When everything becomes undone  
Bring it back to one  
Bring it back to one more night  
Bring it back to one  
Lets bring it back to one  
Bring it back to one  
Its just beyond my reach  
So bring me back to one  
  
I know forever always asks so much  
Dont you let it scare you  
Dont you lose your touch  
And when your still waters start to run  
Bring it back to one  
  
One more night  
Anothers on the way  
Were all a little different  
But break the same way  
When everything becomes un  
Everything becomes un  
Dont look back  
Well never find the way  
A million different people will break  
The same way  
When everything becomes undone  
Bring it back to one
