Easy driver shes a wicked rider  
Shes smooth and shes skinny and shes probably mean  
Easy driver pull up beside her roll down the window on this fine machine  
Chorus  
Ooh ooh ooh dont turn away ooh ooh ooh just give me a sign  
Ooh ooh ooh dont be afraid ooh ooh love is so hard to find  
Easy driver get on up beside her she dont drive like she knows the way  
Easy driver roads getting wider  
Theres room to run and she might skate away  
Come on back baby what you say  
chorus  
One lane away from love the story of my life  
Could I be good enough for your lonely avenue tonight  
Its a lonely avenue tonight  
chorus  
Easy driver shes a wicked rider  
Shes smooth and shes skinny and shes probably mean  
Easy driver get on up beside her roll down the window on this fine machine  
Easy driver oh oh oh oh easy driver easy driver easy driver easy driver  
Easy driver easy driver easy driver easy driver
