I got a solid silver reason  
I got something youll never buy  
Ive spent my life playing rock n roll  
I wouldnt tell a lie  
  
Well if you want to taste the freedom  
Just let the music take a hold  
Im possessed by rock n roll  
Theres a thunder see it and wonder  
How to play the game its easy  
  
You know were gonna live forever  
You know were never gonna die  
You see its written across the sky tonight  
Im gonna tell you why  
  
Because theyve covered up the exits  
We got a spotlight just for you  
Im possessed by rock n roll  
Hear me calling stars are falling  
Taking me away  
  
Stand up shout it out  
Im possessed by rock n roll  
Stand up shout it out  
Sell your soul  
  
Stand up shout it out  
Let the music take a hold  
Stand up shout it out  
Rock n roll  
  
Cant you feel were gettin stronger  
gettin stronger every day  
There aint nothing gonna stop us  
Oh there aint no way  
  
Its like a rolling ball of thunder  
You know its never gonna stop  
You know its gonna drag you under  
See me soaring thunders roaring  
Things afraid again  
  
Stand up shout it out  
Im possessed by rock n roll  
Stand up shout it out  
Sell your soul  
  
Stand up shout it out  
Let the music take a hold  
Stand up shout it out  
Rock n roll  
  
I got a solid silver reason  
I got something youll never buy  
Ive spent my life with rock n roll  
Oh no would I lie  
  
But if you want to taste the freedom  
Just let the music take a hold  
Im possessed by rock n roll  
Theres a thunder see it and wonder  
How to play the game its easy  
  
Its gonna drag you under  
Gonna take your heart and soul  
You gotta stand up  
You gotta shout shout shout shout shout it out
