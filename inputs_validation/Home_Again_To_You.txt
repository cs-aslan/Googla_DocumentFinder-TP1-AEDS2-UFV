Dont throw it all away  
Hear what Ive gotta say  
Because youre always on my mind  
Ive got an eye on you  
And only you will do  
And I dont want to waste my time  
So wont you hear my out  
Because its all about when  
I come home again to you  
Youre such a little child  
Youre gonna drive me wild  
As I just dont know what to say  
I got an eye on you  
And only you will do  
And I dont want to get in your play  
Hesitate because I cannot wait  
Till I come home again to you  
You make me feel so old  
Just like I have been told  
Because its always up to you  
Oh baby hear me out  
Ive done all my time  
And I dont want to be misused  
So please dont hesitate  
Because I cannot wait  
Till I come home again to you  
Cant waste all my time  
Give me all today  
Well its on my mind  
You cant own me  
When all I want to be  
But I dont want to waste all my time  
Hear me out  
Because Ill scream and out  
When I come home again to you  
Home to you
