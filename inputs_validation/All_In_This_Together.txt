All In This Together  
  
Let me tell you what I see through my eyes  
Apathy is all around and on the rise  
We channel so much energy through our greed  
Which leads us to become absolved of those in need  
Lemme tell you  
  
Money cant buy lives  
Sunny days for you  
Living is more than profits accrued  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together  
  
Its funny how we took a prayer out of schools  
After the 911 scare thats all we do  
We compromise our liberties for security  
We can become so self in dosed that we cant see  
Lemme tell you  
  
Money cant buy lives  
Sunny days for you  
Living is more than profits accrued  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together  
  
Dont throw in the towel  
Lets overcome the test for now  
Together together we last divided we fall  
Love will conquer all  
  
Money cant buy lives  
Sunny days for you Sunny days for you  
Living is more than profits accrued  
We gotta change we gotta change right now  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together  
  
Money cant buy lives  
Sunny days for you  
Living is more than profits accrued  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together
