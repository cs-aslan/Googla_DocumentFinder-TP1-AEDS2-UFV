She came in like a hurricane  
Wearing boots and diamond rings  
With a fox fur on her shoulder  
She set wondering  
And I could tell she was feeling abandoned  
Because she flashed a look across my way  
She said hop for a ride  
Youll never ask me but Ill tell you anyway  
  
She took me out on the blackboard jungle  
Put me straight in a hurricane  
She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways  
If I could sing like Paul McCartney or get funky like Etta James  
Id never change Id never change Id never change silver heeled ways  
  
She came in and her flags were flying  
She was a sailboat of sweet perfume  
And I could see that her eyes were smiling  
From across the room  
Well I couldnt think of conversation  
I was busy looking at her furs  
She said hey youll never ask me  
So I guess Ill say the word  
  
She took me out on the blackboard jungle  
Put me straight in a hurricane  
She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways  
If I could sing like Paul McCartney and funky like Etta James  
Id never change Id never change No Id never change silver heeled ways  
  
silver silver heels thats what I mean  
silver whoo talking bout silver silver heels  
silver alright silver heels  
Im talkin bout silver silver silver heels silver  
She took me out on the blackboard jungle  
Put me straight in a hurricane  
She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways  
If I could sing like Paul McCartney and funky like Etta James  
Id never change No Id never change her Id never change silver heeled ways
