The Zombies  
  
The warmth of your loves  
Like the warmth from the sun  
And this will be our year  
Took a long time to come  
  
Dont let go of my hand  
Now the darkness has gone  
This will be our year  
Took a long time to come  
  
And I wont forget  
The way you helped me up when I was down  
And I wont forget  
The way you said darling I love you  
You gave me faith to go on  
Now were there  
And weve only just begun  
This will be our year  
Took a long time to come  
  
The warmth of your smile  
Smile for me little one  
And this will be our year  
Took a long time to come  
  
You dont have to worry  
All your worried days are gone  
This will be our year  
Took a long time to come  
  
And I wont forget  
The way you helped me up when I was down  
And I wont forget  
The way you said darling I love you  
You gave me faith to go on  
Now were there  
Weve only just begun  
This will be our year  
Took a long time to come  
  
And this will be our year  
Took a long time to come
