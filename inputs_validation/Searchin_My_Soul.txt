Ive been down this road walkin the line  
Thats painted by pride  
And I have made mistakes in my life  
That I just cant hide  
Oh I believe I am ready for what love has to bring  
Got myself together now Im ready to sing  
Ive been searchin my soul tonight  
I know theres so much more to life  
Now I know I can shine a light  
To find my way back home  
One by one the chains around me unwind  
Every day now I feel that I can leave those years behind  
Oh Ive been thinking of you for a long time  
Theres a side of my life where Ive been blind and so  
Ive been searchin my soul tonight  
I know theres so much more to life  
Now I know I can shine a light  
Everything gonna be alright  
Ive been searchin my soul tonight  
Dont want to be alone in life  
Now I know I can shine a light  
To find my way back home  
Baby I been holding back now my whole life  
Ive decided to move on now  
Gonna leave all my worries behind  
Oh I belive I am ready for what love has to give  
Got myself together now Im ready to live  
Ive been searchin my soul tonight  
I know theres so much more to life  
Now I know I can shine a light  
Everything gonna be alright  
Ive been searchin my soul tonight  
Dont want to be alone in my life  
Now I know I can shine a light  
To find my way back home  
Repeat Chorus
