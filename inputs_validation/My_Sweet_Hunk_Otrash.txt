You dont act up too much  
Aint got that glamour touch  
Youre trifling lazy  
Aint worth a cigarette ash  
Look out here mamma  
Look out here  
You carry me too fast  
Youre just my good for nothin  
My sweet hunk o trash  
My my how you sound  
Youre very short on looks  
Dumb when it comes to books  
Look out baby  
Watch it honey  
And you stay full of corn  
Just like a succotash  
What you want me to do in my idle moments  
  
Youre just a goodfornothin  
But my sweet hunk o trash  
Let me get a word in there honey you running your mouth  
You said Ive worried you for years  
Im just a barfly moochin beers  
While you sweat over a hot stove slinging hash  
Work my fingers right down to the elbows  
Yes I may be goodfornothin  
But Im still your sweet hunk o trash  
First to admit it baby  
You said I spread my love all around  
And with the chicks all over town  
But how can I when you keep me broke  
So I cant spend no cash  
Yes I may be goodfornothin  
But Im still your sweet hunk o trash  
Listen hear Pops  
You know you lie about your youth  
I dont lie baby  
Im just careless with the truth thats all  
How careless can you be  
Oh no  
With all your chicks  
You try to make a flash  
Now baby  
It aint like that no  
But youre still my goodfornothin  
My sweet hunk o trash  
Now when you stay out very late  
It sure makes me mad to wait how come baby  
Cause you come home too tired  
To raise just one eyelash  
Watch it baby  
Watch it  
Youre just goodfornothin  
But youre my sweet hunk o trash  
Yes indeed
