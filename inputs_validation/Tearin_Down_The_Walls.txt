Youre my fatal attraction  
Oh no I cant stop  
Youre my midnight fantasy  
Youre my cream of the crop  
  
Im comin home girl  
Im comin home  
  
Youre my soaking wet ecstasy  
Like sex on the beach  
I want to take you home now girl  
Gonna practice what I preach dig  
  
Im comin home girl  
Im comin home now  
  
I can taste your sweet emotion  
I can feel it runnin hot  
Our veins of passion pumping so strong  
Were like gas and fire  
got a burnin desire  
Them sparks are gonna fly and well be  
  
Chorus  
Shakin shakin  
Tearin down the walls  
Little by little inch by inch  
Tearin down the walls  
Screamin scratchin  
Tearin down the walls  
Little by little inch by inch  
Tearin down the walls  
  
I just want to eat you up  
Like a lion in a cage  
Just get a little bit closer girl  
And thats all Ill need to say  
  
Im comin home girl  
Im comin home now  
  
Youre like a slave to the rhythm  
Im gonna put you to the test  
You turn up the heat turn on the light  
And Ill do the rest  
  
Im comin home girl  
Im comin home now  
  
I can taste your sweet emotion  
I can feel it runnin hot  
Our veins of passion pumping so strong  
Were like gas and fire  
got a burnin desire  
Them sparks are gonna fly and well be  
  
Chorus
