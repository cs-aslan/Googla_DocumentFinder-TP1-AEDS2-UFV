Maybe light a candle  
Dont say a prayer for me  
Feel alone  
cause Im gone  
I left you  
Make Christmas your own  
  
You throw the thought of us away  
Youll be alone this holiday  
  
Said Its cold in this town  
And theres snow on the ground  
Far from home  
Not alone  
I left you with nothing  
And thats what you own  
  
You throw the thought of us away  
Youll be alone this holiday  
  
Maybe light a candle  
Dont say a prayer for me  
Feel alone  
cause Im gone  
I left you the best time  
Make Christmas your own  
  
You throw the thought of us away  
Youll be alone this holiday
