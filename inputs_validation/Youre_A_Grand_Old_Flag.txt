Youre a grand old flag  
Youre a high flying flag  
And forever in peace may you wave  
Youre the emblem of  
The land I love  
The home of the free and the brave  
Evry heart beats true  
Neath the Red White and Blue  
Where theres never a boast or brag  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot  
Keep your eye on the grand old flag
