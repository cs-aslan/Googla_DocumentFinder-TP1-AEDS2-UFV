Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
  
I keep looking for something I cant get  
Broken hearts lie all around me  
And I dont see an easy way to get out of this  
  
Her diary it sits by the bedside table  
The curtains are closed the cats in the cradle  
Who wouldve thought that a boy like me could come to this  
  
Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It mustve been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
  
Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It mustve been some kind of kiss  
I shouldve walked away  
  
Is there any just cause for feeling like this  
On the surface Im a name on a list  
I try to be discreet but then blow it again  
  
Ive lost and found its my final mistake  
Shes loving by proxy no give and all take  
Cause Ive been thrilled to fantasy one too many times  
  
Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It mustve been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
  
Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It mustve been some kind of kiss  
I shouldve walked away  
  
It was a long hot night  
She made it easy she made it feel right  
But now its over the moment has gone  
I followed my hands not my head I know I was wrong  
  
Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It mustve been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
  
Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It mustve been some kind of kiss  
I shouldve walked away
