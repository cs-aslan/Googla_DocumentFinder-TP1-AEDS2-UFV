To kiss and tell its just not my style  
But the night is young and its been awhile and she broke my heart  
Broke it right in two and it took some time but Im feelin like  
Im finally ready to find find somebody new  
  
Chorus  
I wanna kiss a girl  
I wanna hold her tight  
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight  
Dont wanna go too far just to take it slow  
But I shouldnt be lonely in this big old world  
I wanna kiss a girl  
  
Its that moment when you start closin in  
First youre holding back then surrenderin  
It can start a fire light up the sky such a simple thing  
Do you wanna try  
Are you ready to say goodbye to all these blues  
  
Chorus  
  
cause maybe tonight it could turn into the rest of our lives oh yeah  
Are you ready Are you ready to cross that line put your lips on mine  
  
Put your lips on mine baby  
  
Do you wanna try  
Are you ready to say goodbye to all these blues  
  
I wanna kiss a girl  
I wanna hold her tight  
Maybe make a little magic baby  
Dont wanna go too far just to take it slow  
But no one should be lonely I shouldnt be lonely  
  
Chorus
