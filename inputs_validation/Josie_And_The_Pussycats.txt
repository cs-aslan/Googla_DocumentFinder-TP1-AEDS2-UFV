Josie and the Pussycats  
Long tails and ears for hats  
Guitars and Marshall stacks  
Hot sweet super cool  
Dont ya know these kitties rule  
  
Hurry hurry  
Weve been going over the master plan  
Driving in our custom printed van  
Practicing for hours  
Dont you know that  
Soon no matter where you go  
Well be on your radio  
  
Josie and the Pussyats  
Hot licks well give ya that  
Stone foxes thats a fact  
Josie and the Pussycats  
  
Even though were playin in our garage  
Soon well have a massive entourage  
Goin triple platinum  
Youll just watch us climbin up the Bilboard Charts  
Breakin records breakin hearts  
Lets go  
  
Josie and the Pussycats  
Long tails and ears for hats  
We know just where its at  
East west north or south  
Guaranteed to rock the house  
Josie and the Pussycats
