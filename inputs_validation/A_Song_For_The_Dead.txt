Its late enough to go drivin  
And see whats mine  
Thats a study of dying  
How to do it right  
Youre a holy roller  
Get your bed in the loose  
If youre hanging around  
Im holdin the noose  
  
Come a little bit closer  
And get on tight  
In a horse rollin over  
Just a track in the line  
Fuck it  
  
Come on lets go drivin  
Come on lets take a little ride  
Thats the study of dying  
How to do it right
