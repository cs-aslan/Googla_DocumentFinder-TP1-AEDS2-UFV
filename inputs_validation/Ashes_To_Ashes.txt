I want them to know its me  
Its on my head  
Ill point the finger at me  
Its on my head  
  
Give it all to you then Ill be closer  
  
Smilin with the mouth of the ocean  
And Ill wave to you with the arms of the mountain  
Ill see you  
  
I will let you shout no more  
Its on my head  
Ill pick you up from the floor  
Its on my head  
Ill let you even the score  
Its on my head  
  
Give it all to you then Ill be closer  
  
Smilin with the mouth of the ocean  
And Ill wave to you with the arms of the mountain  
Ill see you  
  
Give the same to me then Ill be closer closer  
Give the same to me then Ill be closer closer  
  
Smiling with the mouth of the ocean  
And Ill wave to you with the arms of the mountain  
  
Give the same to me then Ill be closer closer  
Give the same to me then Ill be closer
