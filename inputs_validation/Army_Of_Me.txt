Ive been standing where you left me  
Praying that youd come and get me  
But now Ive found my second wind  
Now I found my second skin  
Well I know what you were thinking  
You thought youd watch me fade away  
When you broke me into pieces  
But I gave each piece a name  
  
One of me is wiser  
One of me is stronger one of me is a fighter  
And theres a thousand faces of me  
And were gonna rise up  
And were gonna rise up  
For every time you broke me  
Well youre gonna face an army army of me  
  
Welcome to my revolution  
All your walls are breaking down  
Its time you had a taste of losing  
Time the tables turned around  
I see a glimpse of recognition  
But its too late ugh its too late  
And what you though was your best decision  
Just became your worst mistake  
  
One of me is wiser  
One of me is stronger  
One of me is a fighter  
And theres a thousand faces of me  
And were gonna rise up  
And were gonna rise up  
For every time you broke me  
Well youre gonna face an army army of me  
  
So how does it feel  
To know that I beat ya  
That I can defeat ya  
Oh how does it feel  
Cause it sure feels sweeter  
It should be sweeter to me  
Now that Im wiser  
Now that Im stronger  
Now that Im a fighter  
Theres a thousand faces of me  
And Im gonna rise up  
Im gonna rise up  
For every time you broke me  
Theres a thousand faces of me  
And Im gonna rise up  
Yeah Im gonna rise up  
For every time you broke me  
Youre gonna face an army  
Army of me
