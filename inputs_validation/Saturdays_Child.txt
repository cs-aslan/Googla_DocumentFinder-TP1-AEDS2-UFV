Monday had a sad child  
Always feeling low down  
Tuesday had a dream child  
Shes always on the go  
Now Im in love with Saturdays child  
She drives me wild  
Gonna spend my time  
Makin sure that Saturdays child is mine  
  
If you love a Wednesday  
Youll live your life apart now  
And if you love a Thursday  
Shes gonna break your heart  
So Im in love with Saturdays child  
She drives me wild  
Gonna spend my time  
Makin sure that Saturdays child is mine  
  
Seven days of the week made to choose from  
But only one is right for me  
I know that Saturdays got what it takes babe  
I can tell by the way she looks at me  
  
Friday likes the good life  
Shell take you for a ride now  
And Sunday makes a good wife  
But she wants to be a bride  
So Im in love with Saturdays child  
She drives me wild  
Gonna spend my time  
Makin sure that Saturdays child is mine
