Time is the enemy of a young mans dreams  
Im stranded in the heartland or so it seems  
  
Im hitching a ride for a chance at the good life  
Ill have my own place out on fifth avenue  
Im leavin this time gonna walk on that fine line  
Ill be the first one who finally breaks through  
  
One road to the promised land  
I have to get there any way I can  
One road to the promised land  
Gonna find out just who I am  
  
Freedom do you know what I mean  
Flatlands are all Ive ever seen  
  
Stuck in a small town where you live then you die  
Aint nothin but fools workin nine until five  
Ill sleep in the subways till I get what I need  
Im not gonna stay here just lie here and bleed  
  
One road to the promised land  
Im gonna get there any way I can  
One road to the promised land  
Show the world just who I am  
  
One road to the promised land  
I thought by now Id be a different man  
One road to the promised land  
Guess I found out just who I am
