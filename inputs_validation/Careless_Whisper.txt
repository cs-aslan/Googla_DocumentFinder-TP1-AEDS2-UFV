I feel so unsure  
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor  
As the music dies something in your eyes  
Calls to mind the silver screen  
And all its sad goodbyes  
  
Im never gonna dance again  
Guilty feet have got no rhythm  
Though its easy to pretend  
I know your not a fool  
  
Shouldve known better than to cheat a friend  
And waste the chance that Ive been given  
So Im never gonna dance again  
The way I danced with you  
  
Time can never mend  
The careless whispers of a good friend  
To the heart and mind  
Ignorance is kind  
Theres no comfort in the truth  
Pain is all youll find  
  
Im never gonna dance again  
Guilty feet have got no rhythm  
Though its easy to pretend  
I know your not a fool  
  
I shouldve known better than to cheat a friend  
And waste the chance that Ive been given  
So Im never gonna dance again  
The way I danced with you  
  
Never without your love  
  
Tonight the music seems so loud  
I wish that we could lose this crowd  
Maybe its better this way  
Wed hurt each other with the things wed want to say  
  
We could have been so good together  
We could have lived this dance forever  
But no ones gonna dance with me  
Please stay  
  
And Im never gonna dance again  
Guilty feet have got no rhythm  
Though its easy to pretend  
I know your not a fool  
  
Shouldve known better than to cheat a friend  
And waste the chance that Ive been given  
So Im never gonna dance again  
The way I danced with you  
  
Now that youre gone Now that youre gone  
Now that youre gone What I dids so wrong so wrong  
That you had to leave me alone
