Verse  
There was a call at 3 A M At jfk  
Guess you stayed cuz you wanted to stay  
And we went from zero everything all in a day  
And then Kennedy took you away  
I thought of a short robe that was keeping you warm  
And the moments that make up your life till you wake up  
You sit on a swing in the dark with a girl  
She tells you she wanted to kiss you  
  
Chorus  
And you know  
The worst part of a good day  
Is hearing yourself say goodbye  
To one more possibility day goes on and on  
  
Verse 2  
I go west but your weather has changed  
But youre scared and mistaken for strange  
You want me to leave then you start to believe  
I should stay I gotta get out of la  
It seems that the short days are over  
Cause you dont just dont sleep in the daylight  
So I dont sit up nights  
I lay on my back on top of the hill  
And your body is breaking the sky cuz youre shakin  
  
Chorus  
And you know  
The worst part of a good day  
Is hearing yourself say goodbye  
To one more possibility day yeah its gone  
  
Verse 3  
We were waiting for winter this year but you came and it never appeared  
Me and you we know too many reasons for people  
And season that pass like they werent even here  
Now living in smiles is better you say  
We carry the burdens of all of our days  
So scared that youll leave youre scarred that Ill stay  
Its an impossibility day we only saw half of the ballet  
I said good night goodbye seems like a good thing  
So you know its a good lie  
You can run outta choices and still hear  
A voice in your head when youre lying in bed  
And it says that the best part of a bad day is knowing its okey  
The color of everything changes the sky rearranges its shade  
And the smile doesnt fade into the phone call and one bad decision weve made  
  
Chorus  
And the worst part of a good day  
Is the one thing you dont say  
And you dont know how but you  
Wish there was some way so  
  
Verse 4  
And you pull down the shades and you shut out the light  
Because somehow you mixed up goodbye and good night  
And you one thing you wont say is everyone  
Knows possibility days are impossible  
It just feels wrong so wrong still youre gone long gone
