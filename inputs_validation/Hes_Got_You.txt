I got your picture that you gave to me  
And its signed with love just like it used to be  
The only thing different the only thing new  
I got your picture hes got you  
I got your records that we used to share  
And they still sound the same as when you lived here  
The only thing different the only thing new  
I got the records hes got you  
Ive got your memory or has it got me  
I really dont know but I know it wont let me be  
Ive got your class ring that proved you care  
And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear  
The only thing different the only thing new  
Ive got these little thing hes got you  
Ive got your memory or has it got me  
I really dont know but I know it wont let me be  
Ive got your class ring that proved your care  
And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear  
The only thing different the only thing new  
Ive got the little thing hes got you
