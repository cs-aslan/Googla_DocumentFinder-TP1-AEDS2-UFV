Im long gone from verticalSomewhere South is stopping meIm long gone
from the American Dreamyou may decide its not for meim long gone but Ill
let you throughyou may decide its not for youim long gone but Ill let you
throughyou may decide theres nothing theree  
Born in a junkyard x8  
Gone  
Im long gone but Ill let you throughyou may decide that its not that
goodim long gone but Ill let you leaveyou may decide on stopping me
