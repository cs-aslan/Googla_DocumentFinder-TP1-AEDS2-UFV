Think I got your dial tone  
Think I got billy baxters bone  
Think I got a bubblesac  
Think I got a big mac attack  
Hold the pickles hold the lettuce  
Special orders dont upset us  
All we ask is that you let us  
Server it your way  
Too much paranoias  
My mommas afraid to tell me  
The things shes afraid of  
I been dipped in double meaning  
I been stuck with static cling  
Think I got a ruptopac  
Think I got a big mac attack
