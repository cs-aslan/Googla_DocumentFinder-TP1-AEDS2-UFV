I dont know how Ill get her ioff my mind  
But give me time and Ill think of something  
I cant say today that Im alright  
But by tonight Ill think of Something  
  
Ill find so many things to do  
That I wont have the time to think of her  
And then if shes still on my mind  
Ill try to drink enough to drown the hurt  
And if that dont work Ill think of something  
  
Where do I go for love that I still need  
Now that Im free Ill think of something  
And if someday by accident we meet  
And I cant speak Ill think of something  
  
If I cant say a word to her  
Ill blame it on this lump thats in my throat  
And standing there what will I do  
To hide my love enough that it wont show  
I dont know Ill think of something  
Well I dont know Ill think of something
