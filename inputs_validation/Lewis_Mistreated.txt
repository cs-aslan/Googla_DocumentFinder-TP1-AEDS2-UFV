Bummed out again  
Buy early business friend  
The smell of fear is bigger than you think  
  
Hey dont do it  
Do it  
  
Change seem to fit  
In the end you just feel sick  
And then you choke on an anesthetic  
  
Hey dont do it  
Lewis  
Lewis  
Save yourself the pain  
Youll never get there  
Lewis  
Save yourself the pain  
It never really matters here  
  
We never noticed  
We never understood  
He just get crushed to fit  
He never even smile  
  
At the best its the best  
Its the best day I know  
  
Lewis  
Save yourself the pain  
Youll never get there  
Lewis  
Save yourself the pain  
It never really matters here  
  
Lewis  
Mistreated  
I call you blue  
Lewis  
Mistreated  
I call you blue  
  
I dont want to talk about it  
I dont want to talk about it  
I dont want to talk about Lewis Lewis Lewis  
I dont want to talk about it  
Lewis Lewis Lewis
