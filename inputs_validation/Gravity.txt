Last time I talked to you  
You were lonely and out of place  
You were looking down on me  
Lost out in space  
We laid underneath the stars  
Strung out and feeling brave  
I watched the red orange glow  
I watched you float away  
  
Down here in the atmosphere  
Garbage and city lights  
Youve gone to save your tired soul  
Youve gone to save our lives  
I turned on the radio  
To find you on satellite  
Im waiting for this sky to fall  
Im waiting for a sign  
And all we are  
Is all so far  
  
Youre falling back to me  
The star that I can see yeah  
I know youre out there  
Somewhere out there  
Youre falling out of reach  
Defying gravity yeah  
I know youre out there  
Somewhere out there  
  
Hope you remember me  
When youre homesick and need a change  
I miss your purple hair  
I miss the way you taste  
I know youll come back someday  
On a bed of nails Ill wait  
Im praying that you dont burn out  
Or fade away  
And all we are  
Is all so far  
  
Youre falling back to me  
The star that I can see yeah  
I know youre out there  
Somewhere out there  
Youre falling out of reach  
Defying gravity yeah  
I know youre out there  
Somewhere out there  
  
Youre falling back to me  
The star that I can see  
I know youre out there  
Oh  
Youre falling out of reach  
Defying gravity  
I know youre out there  
Somewhere out there  
  
Youre falling back to me  
The star that I can see yeah  
I know youre out there  
Somewhere out there  
Youre falling out of reach  
Defying gravity yeah  
I know youre out there  
Somewhere out there  
  
Youre falling back to me  
I know  I know  
Youre falling out of reach  
I know
