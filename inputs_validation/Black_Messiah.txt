Everybody got the right to speak their mind  
So dont shoot me for saying mine  
Everybody talking about racial equality  
Cause everybodys equal in the good Lords eyes  
But if I told you that God was black  
What would you think of that  
I bet you wouldnt believe it  
  
Theres a self made prophet living right next to me  
He said the Black Messiahs gonna come and set the whole world free  
He looked at me with his evil eye and prophesied  
And he really believed it  
  
He said a Black Messiah is gonna set the world on fire  
And hes no liar cause he has truly heard the word  
Everybody talking about racial equality  
But Im the only honky living on an all black street  
They knock me down cause they brown and I white  
  
Everybody got the right to speak their mind  
So dont shoot me for saying mine  
Everybody talking about racial equality  
You hear everybody talking about equal rights  
But whites white blacks black and thats that  
And thats the way you should leave it  
  
Dont want no Black Messiah to come and set the world on fire  
A Black Messiah is gonna come and rule the world  
Everybody got to show a little give and take  
Everybody got to live with a little less hate  
Everybody gotta work it out we gotta sort it out  
Everybody got the right to speak their mind  
So dont shoot me for saying mine
