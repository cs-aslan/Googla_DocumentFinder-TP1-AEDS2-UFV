It cant be love  
For there is no true love  
It cant be love  
For there is no true love  
  
Sure Im CFK  
But you gotta love me  
The cost no man can say  
But you gotta love me  
  
Well Im sorry but Im not  
Interested in gold mines  
Oil wells shipping or real estate  
What would I liked to have been  
Everything you hate  
  
Cause it cant be love  
For there is no true love  
It cant be love  
For there is no true love  
  
There is a man  
A certain man  
And for the poor you may be sure  
That hell do all he can  
Who is this one  
Whose favorite son  
Just by his action has the traction  
Magnets on the run  
Who likes to smoke  
Enjoys a joke  
And wouldnt get a bit  
Upset if he were really broke  
With wealth and fame  
Hes still the same  
Ill bet you five youre not alive  
If you dont know his name  
  
You said the union forever  
You said the union forever  
You cried the union forever  
But that was untrue girl  
  
Cause it cant be love  
For there is no true love  
It cant be love  
For there is no true love
