All I can be is a sweet memory  
That drifts through your mind from time to time  
I could never be more than a knock on your door  
Just a shadow thats gone with the sunshine  
  
For you know Im not free and I never can be  
And youre bound to get restless in time  
All I can be is a sweet memory  
That drifts through your mind  
  
Tonight Ill shed a silent tear while lying here with you  
The sands of time have trickled down to just a precious few  
Youre young and so beautiful and Im so glad Im here  
But the ending painfully clear  
  
All I can be is a sweet memory  
Of someone you had to leave behind  
Who loves you and needs you but never could give you  
A ring for your finger so fine  
  
So tonight lets just borrow one memory for tomorrow  
Til we find weve run out of time  
All I can be is a sweet memory  
That drifts through your mind  
  
All I can be is a sweet memory  
That drifts through your mind
