Church bells were ringing and I heard angels singing  
On the day that I said I do  
He gave me a kiss and I thought wedded bliss  
Was a motherto bes dream come true  
The he carried me across the threshold and I heard the front door slam  
Cabin fever had just began  
Pack his lunch at sixthirty but do not disturb him  
Cause he wants to sleep in till eight  
If I dont remind him its time to get up  
He tells me its my fault hes late  
Now I clean up the kitchen till noontime  
And then I vacuum till a quarter to three  
Cabin fever is killing me  
  
At seven he calls up and says dont cook supper  
When he knows that its already done  
My kids climb the curtains and I climb the walls  
Hes with the boys having fun  
Let me try to get a breath of fresh air  
And all I ever gets the third degree I got to leave here  
Cabin fevers killing me  
Cabin fevers killing me  
I gotta leave here  
Cabin fevers killing me
