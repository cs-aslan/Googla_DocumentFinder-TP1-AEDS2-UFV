Black is the night metal we fight  
Power amps set to explode  
Energy screams magic and dreams  
Satan records the first note  
We chime the bell chaos and hell  
Metal for maniacs pure  
Faster than steel fortune on wheels  
Brain haemorrhage is the cure  
  
Black metal  
Black metal  
Black metal  
Black metal  
Black metal  
Lay down your souls to the gods rock n roll  
  
Freaking so wild nobodys mild  
Giving it all that you got  
Wild is so right metal tonight  
Faster than over the top  
Open the door enter hells core  
Black is the code for tonight  
Atomic force feel no remorse  
Crank up the amps now its night  
  
Black metal  
Black metal  
Black metal  
Black metal  
Black metal  
  
Lay down your souls to the gods rock n roll  
Metal ten fold through the deadly black hole  
Riding hells stallions bareback and free  
Taking our chances with raw energy  
  
Come ride the night with us  
Rock hard and fight  
United my legions we stand  
Freak hard and wild for us  
Give up your soul  
Live for the quest satans band  
  
Oh  
  
Black Metal  
  
Against the odds black metal gods  
Fight to achieve our goal  
Casting a spell leather and hell  
Black metal gods rock n roll  
Building up steam nuclear screams  
Warheads are ready to fight  
Black leather hounds faster than sound  
Metal our purpose in life  
  
Black metal  
Black metal  
Black metal  
Black metal  
Black metal  
  
Lay down your souls to the gods rock n roll  
Oh Black Metal
