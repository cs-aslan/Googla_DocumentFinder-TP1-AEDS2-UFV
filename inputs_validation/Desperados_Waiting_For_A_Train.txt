Id sing the Red River Valley  
And hed sit in the kitchen and cry  
Run his fingers through seventy years of livin  
Wonder Lord has every well I drilled ran dry  
We were friends me and that old man  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
Hes a drifter and a driller of oil wells  
And an old school man of the world  
Taught me how to drive his car when hes too drunk to  
And hed wink and give me money for the girls  
And our lives was like some old western movie  
Like desperados waiting for the train like desperados waiting for the train  
  
From the time that I could walk he take me with him  
To a place called the Green Frog Cafe  
There was old men with beer guts and dominos  
Lyin bout their lives while theyd play  
And I was just a kid that they all called his sidekick  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
Now I looked up and he was pushin eighty  
And theres brown tobacco stains all down his chin  
To me hes one of the heroes of this country  
So whys he all dressed up like some old men  
Drinking beer and playing moon and 42  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
Then just before he died I went to see him  
I was grown and he was almost gone  
We just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen  
And sang another verse to that old song  
Dont cry Jack its only Jesus comin  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train
