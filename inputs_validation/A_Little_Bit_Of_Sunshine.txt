MARY SUNSHINE  
When I was a tiny tot  
Of maybe two or three  
I can still remember what  
My mother said to me  
  
Place rose colored glasses on your nose  
And you will see the robins  
Not the crows  
  
for in this tense and tangled web  
Our weary lives may weave  
youre so much better off  
if you believe  
  
That theres a little bit of good  
In everyone  
In everyone youll ever know  
  
Yes theres a little bit of good  
In everyone  
Though many times it doesnt show  
  
It only takes the taking time  
With one another  
For under every mean veneer  
Is someone warm and dear  
Keep looking  
  
for that bit of good in everyone  
The ones we call bad  
Are never all bad  
So try to find that little bit of good  
  
Just a little little bit of good  
  
Is someone warm and dear  
Keep looking  
  
For that little good in everyone  
Although you meet rats  
Theyre not complete rats  
So try to find that little bit of good
