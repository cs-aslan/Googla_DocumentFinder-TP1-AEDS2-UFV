I hopped off the plane at LAX  
With a dream and my cardigan  
Welcome to the land of fame excess  
Whoa am I gonna fit in  
  
Jumped in the cab  
Here I am for the first time  
Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign  
This is all so crazy  
Everybody seems so famous  
  
My tummys turnin and Im feelin kinda home sick  
Too much pressure and Im nervous  
Thats when the taxi man turned on the radio  
And the Jay Z song was on  
And the Jay Z song was on  
And the Jay Z song was on  
  
Chorus  
So I put my hands up  
Theyre playing my song  
And the butterflies fly away  
Noddin my head like yeah  
Movin my hips like yeah  
I got my hands up  
Theyre playin my song  
You know Im gonna be okay  
Yeah its a party in the USA  
Yeah its a party in the USA  
  
Get to the club in a taxi cab  
Everybodys looking at me now  
Like whos that chick thats rockin kicks  
Shes gotta be from out of town  
  
So hard with my girls not around me  
Its definitely not a Nashville party  
Cause all I see are stilettos  
I guess I never got the memo  
  
My tummys turnin and Im feelin kinda home sick  
Too much pressure and Im nervous  
Thats when the DJ dropped my favorite tune  
And a Britney song was on  
And a Britney song was on  
And a Britney song was on  
  
Chorus  
  
Feel like hoppin on a flight on a flight  
Back to my hometown tonight town tonight  
But something stops me every time every time  
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright  
  
Chorus x2
