Another passenger  
your baggage thank you sir  
I dont wanna go  
What am I doing here  
I feel so sick with fear  
God dont let it show  
  
I must control myself  
You must control me too  
  
Cover my eyes cause Im so high  
I cant look down  
Im scared to fly and Im so high  
I cant look down  
  
They say theyll care for me  
But I would rather be  
Both feet on the ground  
What if the engine dies  
These are no friendly skies  
My heads spining round  
  
Its all a twist of fate  
But its myself I hate  
  
Cover my eyes cause Im so high  
I cant look down  
Afraid to fly and Im so high  
I cant look down  
  
I must control myself  
You must control me too  
  
Cover my eyes cause Im so high  
I cant look down  
Afraid to fly and Im so high  
I cant look down  
I cant look down
