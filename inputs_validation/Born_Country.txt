Clear creeks and cool mountain mornins  
Honest work out in the fields  
Cornbread in my mommas kitchen  
Daddy saying grace before the meal  
Family ties run deep in this land  
And Im never very far from what I am  
  
Chorus  
I was born country and thats what Ill always be  
Like the rivers and the woodlands wild and free  
I got a hundred years of down home running through my blood  
I was born country and this countrys what I love  
  
Moonlight and you here beside me  
Crickets serenadin in the yard  
What more could two people ask for  
Laying here in love beneath the stars  
Now this is where I want to raise my kids  
Just the way my mom and daddy did  
  
Chorus x2  
I was born country
