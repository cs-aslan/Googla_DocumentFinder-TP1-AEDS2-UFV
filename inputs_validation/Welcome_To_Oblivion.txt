Youre the chemical Im in trouble Ive lost all control  
Cmon 12 oclock in the savon parking lot a 30 day supply

Welcome to oblivion here I come Here I come  
Burning bridges just for fun one by one damage done  
Can you feel me here I come and my darling remedy oh please please please

2 oclock now weve been around the block  
Weve closed the bar and lost the car weve come too far to stop tonight my

Burning bridges just for fun one by one damage done  
Can you feel me here I come yes it tastes like  
You might might be laced but Im not sure cause I cant feel you anymore  
Welcome to oblivion destruction here I come  
Burning bridges just for fun yeah the damage has been done  
Im torn to pieces small enough to pick me up so pick me up
