When I was a kid the things I did were hidden under the grid  
Young and naive I never believed that love could be so well hid  
dWith regret Im willing to bet and say the older you get  
It gets harder to forgive and harder to forget  
It gets under your shirt like a dagger at work  
The first cut is the deepest but the rest still flipping hurt  
You build your heart of plastic  
Get cynical and sarcastic  
And end up in the corner on your own  
  
Cause Id love to feel love but I cant stand the rejection  
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection  
I thought I was close but under further inspection  
It seems Ive been running in the wrong direction oh no  
  
So whats the point in getting your hopes up  
When all youre ever getting is choked up  
When youre coked up  
And cant remember the reason why you broke up  
You call her in the morning  
When youre coming down and falling like an old man on the side of the road  
Cause when youre apart you dont want to mingle  
When youre together you want to be single  
Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss  
That made your heart tingle  
How much greener the grass is  
With those rose tinted glasses  
But the butterflies they flutter by and leave us on our arses  
  
Cause Id love to feel love but I cant stand the rejection  
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection  
I thought I was close but under further inspection  
It seems Ive been running in the wrong direction  
Theres fish in the sea for me to make a selection  
Id jump in if it wasnt for my ear infection  
Cause all I want to do is try to make a connection  
It seems Ive been running in the wrong direction oh oh  
  
Oh Id love to feel love but I cant stand the rejection  
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection  
I thought I was close but under further inspection  
It seems Ive been running in the wrong direction  
Id love to feel love but I cant stand the rejection  
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection  
I thought I was close but under further inspection  
It seems Ive been running in the wrong direction oh  
It seems like Im running in the wrong direction oh  
Seems like Im running in the wrong direction oh  
Well it seems Ive been running in the wrong direction oh no  
Seems Ive been running in the wrong direction
