Well a twister tore the roof off a grocery store  
Blew an Idaho potato through the hardwood floor  
Twirled grannys apron up around her head  
The cats still missin and the dog is dead  
  
Well aint love a lot lot that  
Aint love a lot like that  
Unconditional unpredictable  
Aint love a lot like that  
  
Just like Moses and the Red Sea water  
A little bit of faith and the ring I bought her  
I hit my knees and she took my hand  
And she lead my heart to the promised land  
  
Aint love a lot lot that  
Aint love a lot like that  
Unconditional unpredictable  
Aint love a lot like that  
  
Well the honeymoons over and the work begun  
My baby say Im gettin on her nerves again  
One false move and an angry shout  
Im sleepin all alone on the fold out couch  
  
Aint love a lot lot that  
Aint love a lot like that  
Unconditional unpredictable  
Aint love a lot like that  
  
Aint love a lot that  
Now aint love a lot like that  
Unconditional unpredictable  
Aint love a lot like that  
  
Unconditional unpredictable  
Aint love a lot like that  
  
Aint love a lot like that
