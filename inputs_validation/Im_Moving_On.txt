Ive dealt with my ghosts  
And Ive faced all my demons  
Finally content with the past I regret  
Ive found you find strength in your moments of weakness  
For once Im at peace with myself  
Ive been burdened with blame  
Trapped in the past for too long  
Im moving on  
  
Ive lived in this place  
And I know all the faces  
Each one is different  
But theyre always the same  
They mean me no harm  
But its time that I face it  
Theyll never allow me to change  
But I never dreamed home would end up where I dont belong  
Im moving on  
  
Im moving on  
At last I can see  
Last I can see  
Life has been patiently waiting for me  
And I know theres no guarentees  
But Im not alone  
There comes a time in everyones life  
When all you can see are the years passing by  
The years passing by  
And I have made up my mind  
That those days are gone  
  
I sold what I could  
And packed what I couldnt  
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town  
Ive loved like I should  
But lived like I shouldnt  
I had to lose everything to find out  
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road  
Im moving on  
Im moving on  
Im moving on
