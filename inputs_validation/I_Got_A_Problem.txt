I got a problem I cant explain  
Its hard to solve it I cant lose face  
They all try to help me but I cant see the light  
  
Me and my shadow are so in despair  
Cause we keep hurtin someone who cares  
Every time we talk about it I break out in a cold sweat  
There must be some way outta here but I cant find it yet  
  
I got a problem thats so intense  
I try to fight it but theres no defense  
  
Every time we talk about it I break out in a cold sweat  
There must be some way outta here but I cant find it yet  
  
I got a problem I got a problem  
I got a problem I got a problem  
Every time we talk about it I break out in a cold sweat
