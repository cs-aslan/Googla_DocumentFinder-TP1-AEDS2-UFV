Dont tell me what you cant do  
Never had a hold on you  
And dont tell me where youd rather be  
Just say the word Ill set you free  
  
You wont believe what you wont see  
The only one youll lose is me  
Dont tell me what you cant do oh no  
  
Give a little I need a lot  
You never think about what weve got  
Maybe our breakup is long overdue  
If its over me its up to you  
  
Dont make it harder than you need to  
Youre old enough to hear the truth  
Dont tell me what you cant do  
  
Id do anything to make you stay  
Id be a fool to let you get away  
They say true love never runs smooth  
But when its gone what can you do  
  
You wont believe what you wont see  
The only one youll lose is me  
Do what you like you know that you can mmm  
  
Dont let her go  
Maybe I should let her know  
Ill try to be strong  
But its wrong  
Im gonna have to let her go  
If you walk out on me  
Id be lonely as a man could be  
  
You wont believe what you wont see  
The only one youll lose is me  
Do what you like you know that you can  
But girl if youre wrong please understand  
Do what you like you know that you can  
But girl if youre wrong please understand  
  
Do what you like you know that you can  
Dont tell me what you cant do  
But girl if youre wrong please understand  
Never had a hold on you  
Tell me you like you know that you can  
And dont tell me where youd rather be  
But girl if youre wrong please understand  
Just say the word Ill set you free  
  
You wont believe what you wont see  
The only one youll lose is me  
Girl youre losing me  
Youre losing me  
Just do what you like  
Do what you like girl  
  
Walk out of me walk out of me  
Girl you walk out of me  
Say the word Ill set you free  
  
You wont believe what you wont see  
The only one youll lose is me
