You tell me summers here  
And the time is wrong  
You tell me winters here and your days  
Are getting long  
  
Tears are in your eyes tonight  
You tell me that you havent  
Slept in days  
You tell me sleeping only makes you tired  
Anyway  
  
Tears are in your eyes tonight  
Tears are in your eyes every night  
  
Although you dont believe me youre strong  
Darkness always turns into the dawn  
And you wont even remember this for long  
When it ends alright  
  
Please tell me howyou know tomorrowstaring at your shoes  
Tears are in your eyesevery night  
Tears are in your eyesevery night  
Tears are in your eyestonight
