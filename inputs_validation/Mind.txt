Time wont change you  
Money wont change you  
I havent got the faintest idea  
Everything seems to be up in the air at this time  
  
I need something you change your mind  
  
Drugs wont change you  
Religion wont change you  
  
Science wont change you  
Looks like I cant change you  
I try to talk to you to make things clear  
But youre not even listening to me  
And it comes directly from my heart to you  
  
I need something to change your mind
