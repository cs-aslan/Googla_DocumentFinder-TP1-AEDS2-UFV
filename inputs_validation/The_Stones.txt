We dont really know much about her  
We dont really know her name  
But the way she was treated  
Was a shame  
She heard the angry voices  
There was nothing  
That she could say  
It wouldnt have mattered anyway  
All she saw were the stones  
All she saw were the stones  
She felt so helpless  
So all alone  
How she longed  
For the face of a friend  
But oh  
All she saw were the stones  
They pulled her from her lovers arms  
Out into the street  
They drug her to the synagogue  
And threw her at Christs feet  
This woman is an adulteress  
And our law is very clear  
The Master saw her looking down  
Her eyes were filled with tears  
Cause all she saw were the stones  
All she saw were the stones  
She felt so helpless  
So all alone  
How she longed  
For the face of a friend  
But oh  
All she saw were the stones  
Jesus looked up from the crowd  
And then He said to them  
You be the first to cast a stone  
If you have never sinned  
One by one they walked away  
They left the stones behind  
I wish I could have seen her face  
When she opened up her eyes  
Cause all she saw were the stones  
All she saw were the stones  
Jesus said I forgive you go and sin no more  
She knew shed never be the same  
Oh no all she saw were the stones  
All she saw were the stones  
Jesus said I forgive you go and sin no more  
She knew shed never be the same  
Oh no all she saw were the stones
