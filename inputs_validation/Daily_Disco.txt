Your dancing drives me crazy  
I want to see it all night long  
DJ could be playing  
Always this one song  
Your dancing drives me crazy  
Your dancing drives me mad  
Please Sue dont be so lazy  
If you dont dance Im sad  
  
I want to see you moving  
And dancing all the night  
  
The way that Sue is moving  
Is nothing but divine  
And only in the disco  
I know she can be mine  
And when the night is over  
The club is closing down  
I want to give her anything I got  
I give her just a crown  
  
I want to see you moving  
And dancing all the night  
  
Im not here for the music  
Or for your eyes so blue  
I got to see you dancing  
To be in love with you  
I want to get my Daily Disco  
Watch you all the night  
I want to get my Daily Disco  
Did you get that Sue all right  
  
I want to see you moving  
And dancing all the night  
  
Hey you  
I want to see your dance  
Cause youre the only one  
And when you dance  
I know youre mine  
I want to see your dance  
I want it all night long  
Oh Sue youre so divine  
  
Hey you  
Another night is gone  
Another day is back  
I am walking home and feel all right  
Sun in my eyes  
One thing in my mind  
I hope to see you Sue tonight  
  
My name is Clinch Dedee  
Youre the only one I want to see  
Youre the only one I want to dance  
Im one of your fans  
Im one of your fans  
  
I want to see you moving  
Dancing all the night  
Dont come any closer  
Its damaging my sight  
Its damaging my sight
