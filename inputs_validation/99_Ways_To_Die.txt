If I see the morning hours  
Ill have one more yesterday  
Take life from tomorrow  
Cause Ive burned out my today  
  
If I get up to the top I know  
Ill just go back downhill  
Gotta terminal future  
And its time to write my will  
  
Down another glass of courage  
And a shot of Thorazine  
  
Chorus  
Were not ready to see you yet  
99 ways to die  
Were not ready to see you yet  
  
Gotta short between the earphones  
Wringing my hands in dismay  
A more efficient maniac  
With two feet in the grave  
  
Aint got no last words to say  
Yellow streak right up my spine  
The gun in my mouth was real  
And the taste blew my mind  
  
In a black tie and straight jacket  
Man Im gonna try again  
  
Chorus  
  
Demitasse of arsenic  
Try on this tie  
Never mind the tree  
  
There is only death and danger  
In the sockets of my eyes  
A playground of illusion  
No one plays they only die  
  
Theres a prison in my mind  
And the bars are gonna break  
Im as mad as a hatter  
And strung out just the same  
  
Taunting rigor mortis  
I feel it draw me in
