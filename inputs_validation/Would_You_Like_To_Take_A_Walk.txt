I saw you strolling by your solitary  
Am I nosy Very very  
Id like to be a juicy huckleberry  
What youre after is a gal  
Were both in luck for introductions  
Are not necessary  
  
Mmm would you like to take walk  
Mmm do you think its gonna rain  
Mmm how about a sarsaparilla  
Gee the moon is yeller  
Sumpn goodll come from that  
  
Mmm have you heard the latest song  
Mmm its a very pretty strain  
Mmm dont you feel a little thrilly  
Gee its getting chilly  
Sumpn goodll come from that  
  
When youre strolling though the wheresies  
You need a whosies to lean upon  
But when you have no whosies  
To hug and whatsies gosh darn  
  
Mmm would you like to take walk  
Mmm do you think its gonna rain  
Mmm aint you tired of the talkies  
I prefer the walkies  
Sumpn goodll come from that  
  
My little heart is full of palpitation  
What I need is consolation  
Id like to stage a little celebration  
In the moonlight right away  
Ill feel all pepped if youll accept  
My friendly invitation  
  
Mmm would you like to take walk  
Mmm do you think its gonna rain  
Mmm how about a sarsaparilla  
Gee the moon is yeller  
Sumpn goodll come from that  
  
Mmm have you heard the latest song  
Mmm its a very pretty strain  
Mmm dont you feel a little thrilly  
Gee its getting chilly  
Sumpn goodll come from that  
  
When youre strolling though the wheresies  
You need a whosies to lean upon  
But when you have no whosies  
To hug and whatsies gosh darn  
  
Mmm would you like to take walk  
Mmm do you think its gonna rain  
Mmm aint you tired of the talkies  
I prefer the walkies  
Sumpn goodll come from that
