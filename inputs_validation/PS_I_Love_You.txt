Dear I thought I drop a line  
The weather is cool the folks are fine  
Im in bed each night at nine  
PS I love you  
Yesterday we had some rain  
But all in all I cant complain  
Was it dusty on the train  
PS I love you  
Write to the Browns just as soon as youre able  
They came around to call  
I burned a hole in the dining room table  
And let me see I guess thats all  
Nothing else for me to say  
And so Ill close but by the way  
Everybodys thinking of you
