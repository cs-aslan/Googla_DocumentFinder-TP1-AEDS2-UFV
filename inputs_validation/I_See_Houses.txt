I see houses  
Rows and rows  
Of red bricks  
I see black cars  
Some  
Bloodstained exit  
You got  
A feeling that you  
Youve been  
In here before  
How many lives  
Will you waste  
How many tears  
Must you taste  
  
Before your freedom  
Ahahah  
Before your freedom  
Ahahah  
  
I see mountains  
Bloodred sunsets  
I see  
A billion stars  
Love deafened  
And betrayed  
You got  
A feeling that you  
Youve been  
In here before  
How many lives  
Will you waste  
How many tears  
Must you taste  
  
Before your freedom  
Ahahah  
Before your freedom  
Ahahah  
  
Dont be late  
  
You got  
A feeling that you  
Youve been  
In here before  
How many lives  
Will you waste  
How many tears  
Must you taste  
  
Before your freedom  
Ahah  
  
You got a feeling  
That you  
Youve been  
Here before  
How many lives  
Will you waste  
How many blood  
Must you taste  
  
Before your freedom  
Oh  
  
Its just  
This murder  
Trouble and strife  
Turning me  
Into another guy  
Its just murder  
Trouble and strife  
Turning me  
Into another guy  
  
Oh  
  
Dont be late  
Dont be late  
Dont be late  
When I call you up  
  
Ooohooohoohooh  
Ooohooohoohooh  
Ooohooohoohooh  
Ooohooohoohooh  
  
Ooh
