Of all the love I have won or have lost  
There is one love I should never have crossed  
He was a boy in a million my friend  
I should have known he would win in the end  
  
Chorus  
Im a loser  
And I lost someone whos near to me  
Im a loser  
And Im not what I appear to be  
  
Although I laugh and I act like a clown  
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown  
My tears are falling like rain from the sky  
Is it for him or myself that I cry   
  
Chorus x2  
  
What have I done to deserve such a fate   
I realize I have left it too late  
And so its true pride comes before a fall  
Im telling you so that you wont lose all  
  
Chorus  
  
Im a loser
