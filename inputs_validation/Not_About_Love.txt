The early cars  
Already are  
Drawing deep breaths past my door  
And last nights phrases  
Sick with lack of basis  
Are still writhing on my floor  
  
And it doesnt seem fair  
That your wicked words should work  
In holding me down  
No it doesnt seem right  
  
To take information  
Given at close range  
For the gag  
And the bind  
And the ammunition round  
  
Conversation once colored by esteem  
Became dialogue as a diagram of a play for pun  
Took a vacation my palate got clean  
Now I could taste your agenda  
While youre spitting your cud  
  
And it doesnt make sense  
I should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown  
No it doesnt seem right  
To take information  
  
Given at close range  
For the gag  
And the bind  
And the ammunition round  
  
This is not about love  
Cause I am not in love  
In fact I cant stop falling out  
  
This is not about love  
Cause I am not in love  
In fact I cant stop falling out  
I miss that stupid ache  
  
What is this posture  
I have to stare at  
Thats what he said when Im sittin up straight  
Change the name of the game cause he lost  
  
And he knew he was wrong but he knew it too late  
But Im not being fair  
Cause I chose to listen to that filthy mouth  
But Id like to choose right  
  
Take all the things that Ive said that he stole  
Put em in a sack  
Swing em over my shoulder  
Turn on my heels  
  
Step out of this sight  
Try to live in a lovelier life lie  
  
This is not about love  
Cause I am not in love  
In fact I cant stop falling out  
  
This is not about love  
Cause I am not in love  
In fact i cant stop falling out  
I miss that stupid ache
