I watch you go to church on Sunday  
But you forget all you learned on Monday  
You see your smiling face cant hide  
How you hate your brother inside  
  
So Ima telling you  
Run Charlie run  
Look the niggers are coming  
The niggers are coming  
Run Charlie run  
Look the niggers are coming  
The niggers are coming  
  
You built this great big beautiful city  
But you ran away and left it to die what a pity  
You could have made friends with your neighbor  
But you are much too prejudiced to try tell me why  
  
So Ima telling you  
Run Charlie run  
Look the niggers are coming  
The niggers are coming  
Run Charlie run  
Look the niggers are coming  
The niggers are coming  
  
But the greatest wrong you know youve done  
Is you passed this sickness onto your son  
Your one and only boy  
He came into this world with a mind so clean  
You took it molded it and made it mean  
  
So Ima telling you  
Run Charlie run  
Look the niggers are coming  
The niggers are coming  
Run Charlie run  
Look the niggers are coming  
The niggers are coming
