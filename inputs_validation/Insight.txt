Guess you dreams always end  
They dont rise up just descend  
But I dont care anymore  
Ive lost the will to want more  
Im not afraid not at all  
I watch them all as they fall  
But I remember when we were young  
  
Those with habits of waste  
Their sense of style and good taste  
Of making sure you were right  
Hey dont you know you were right  
Im not afraid anymore  
I keep my eyes on the door  
But I remember  
  
Tears of sadness for you  
More upheaval for you  
Reflects a moment in time  
A special moment in time  
Yeah we wasted our time  
We didnt really have time  
But we remember when we were young  
  
And all Gods angels beware  
And all you judges beware  
Sons of chance take good care  
For all the people not there  
Im not afraid anymore  
Im not afraid anymore  
Im not afraid anymore  
Oh Im not afraid anymore
