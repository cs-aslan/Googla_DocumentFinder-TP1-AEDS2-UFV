Caught up against the wall again  
Tied and chained to the ball again  
Never seems to amaze my mind  
So I just sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleepplease dont  
  
Wake me till the morning after  
Wake me till the morning after  
  
Cut and bruised by the fall again  
Lick my wounds like a dog again  
Is that a light at the end of the tunnel  
That I see I see please let it be but dont  
  
Wake me till the morning after  
Wake me till the morning after  
Wake me till the morning after  
  
Oh Im so tired there has got to be an end  
To the pain I feel when Im  
Awake and alive alive alive  
Alive and not dreamin
