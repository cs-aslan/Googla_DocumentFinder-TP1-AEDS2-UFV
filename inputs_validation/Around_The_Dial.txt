Radios of the world are tuning in tonight  
Are you on the dial are you tuned in right  
One of our DJs is missing  
Are you listening  
Are you listening to me  
Can you hear me  
Can you hear me clearly  
Around the dial  
  
Ive been around the dial so many times  
But youre not there  
Somebody tells me that youve been taken off the air  
Well you were my favorite DJ  
Since I cant remember when  
You always played the best records  
You never followed any trend  
FM AM where are you  
You gotta be out there somewhere on the dial  
On the dial  
  
Are you ready Were going round the dial  
Are you listening Around the dial  
Are you tuned in Around the dial  
Are you searchin Around the dial  
FM AM where are you  
You gotta be out there somewhere on the dial  
On the dial  
  
Where did you go Mr DJ  
Did they take you off the air  
Was it something that you said to the corporation guys upstairs  
It wasnt the pressure  
You never sounded down  
It couldnt be the ratings  
You had the best in town  
Somehow Im gonna find ya track you down  
Gonna keep on searchin

Poor DJ Who never let us down  
While the critics kept on knocking you  
You just kept on rocking around the dial  
Around the dial  
  
Ive been searchin for you on my radio  
This time your station really must have gone underground  
Somebody said you had a minor nervous breakdown  
Was it something that you
