I hear the sound of distant drums  
Far away far away  
And if they call for me to come  
Then I must go and you must stay  
  
So Mary marry me lets not wait  
Lets share all the time we can before its too late  
And love me now for now is all the time there may be  
And if you love me Mary Mary marry me  
  
I hear the sound of bugles blow  
Far away far away  
And if they call then I must go  
Who knows where or who can say  
  
So Mary marry me lets not wait  
For those distant drums might change our wedding day  
And love me now for now is all the time there may be  
And if you love me Mary Mary marry me  
Yes if you love me Mary Mary marry me
