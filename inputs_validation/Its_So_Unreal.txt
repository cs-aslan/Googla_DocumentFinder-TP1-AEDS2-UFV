Its not hard to know when your body is aching  
Im alone at night and I dont seem to be patient now  
And I dont know the rules to win  
Believe in my dreams that Im gonna have  
But before I even met the other ones that long obsessed  
Have you been lost Im looking for  
The songs I need before I go  
My house my town cause I said so  
And I will go  
Its so unreal and I will love  
The things I feel are not a joke  
Its so unreal and I will love  
The things I feel  
Its not hard to know when your body is aching  
Im alone at night and I dont seem to be patient now  
And I dont know the rules to win  
Believe in my dreams that Im gonna have  
But before I even met the other ones that long obsessed  
Have you been lost Im looking for  
The songs I need before I go  
My house my town cause I said so  
And I will go  
Its so unreal and I will love  
The things I feel are not a joke  
Its so unreal and I will love  
The things I feel
