That blonde shes a bomb shes an atom bomb  
Rigged up and ready to drop  
The bad news Im a fuse and Ive met my match  
So stand back its about to go off  
  
That vixen shes a master of disguise  
I see danger when I look in her eyes  
Shes so foxy she could lead to my demise  
So Im running cause Ive run out of time  
  
Shes a bombshell blonde wired up to detonate  
Im James Bond live to die another day  
Bombshell blonde high explosive dynamite  
Shes all I want so I Im on a mission tonight  
  
I Im on a mission tonight  
  
Her love is a drug laced with ecstasy  
And her charm is spiked with a spell  
A hot mess in a dress gets the best of me  
Shes ice cold but shes making me melt  
  
That vixen shes a master of disguise  
I see danger when I look in her eyes  
Shes so foxy she could lead to my demise  
So Im running cause Ive run out of time  
  
Shes a bombshell blonde wired up to detonate  
Im James Bond live to die another day  
Bombshell blonde high explosive dynamite  
Shes all I want so I Im on a mission tonight
