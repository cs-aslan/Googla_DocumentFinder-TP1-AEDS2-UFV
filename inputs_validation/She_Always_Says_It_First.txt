Not a day goes by that I dont tell her  
How beautiful she is  
How kind and caring Im always swearing  
Shes the reason that I live  
  
I make it a point to point out every good thing that she does  
How she has everything I need  
And I cant get enough  
  
Well I always tell her I love her  
And how lost Id be without her  
And God knows I mean every word  
I always tell her I love her  
But she always says it first  
  
Not a night goes by that I dont tell her  
Im a lucky man  
Pull her close and let her know  
How proud of her I am  
And Im so into her I swear  
It tears me inside out  
And I make sure she sees that shes what  
This old boys about  
  
Well I always tell her I love her  
And how lost Id be without her  
And God knows I mean every word  
I always tell her I love her  
But she always says it first  
  
She always says it first
