Mama wheres your pretty little girl tonight  
Trying to run before she can walk thats right  
Shes growing up she has a young man waiting  
Shes growing up she has a young man waiting  
Wide eyes shell be streetwise  
To the lies and the jive talk  
But shell find true love  
And tenderness on the block  
Daddy dont you ask her when shes coming in  
And when shes home dont ask her where shes been  
Shes going out she has a young man waiting  
Shes going out cant keep her young man waiting  
Shell be okay let her have her day  
Cause its a long way its a long walk  
But shell find true love  
And tenderness on the block  
I know how much it hurts to see her go  
She has a mind of her own you know  
Shes all grown up she has a young man waiting  
Shes all grown up she has a young man waiting  
She was wideeyed now shes streetwise  
To the lies and the jive talk  
But shell find true love  
And tenderness on the block  
Shell find true love  
And tenderness on the block
