Surprise youre dead  
Ha ha open your eyes  
See the world as it used to be when you used to be in it  
When you were alive and wen you were in love  
And when I took it from you  
Its not over yet  
You dont remember  
I wont let you forget  
The hatred I bestowed  
Upon your neck with a fatal blow  
From my teeth and my tongue  
Ive drank and swallowed but its just begun  
Now you are mine  
Ill keep killing you until the end of time  
Surprise youre dead  
Guess what  
It never ends  
The pain the torment and torture profanity  
Nausea suffering perversion calamity  
You cant get away
