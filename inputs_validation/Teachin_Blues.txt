Yeah hell yeah now I can hear the gypsy wind a howlin  
Aint got time to lean against your wall  
I gotta hit the road and keep on movin  
Im gonna roll and smoke and boogie and ball now  
Been abused got my shoes paid my dues teachin blues  
Yeah Im goin ridin to the gates of freedom  
Cruisin till the sun she falls  
Im gonna follow my god into Eden  
While I roll and smoke and boogie and ball  
Light my fuse get to choose teachin blues
