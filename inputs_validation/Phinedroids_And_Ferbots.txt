Phinedroids and Ferbots  
Phinedroids and Ferbots  
Were Phinedroids and Ferbots  
And were stomping our feet  
To the electric magnetic mechanical beat  
Weve got light bulbs for eyes  
And aluminum noses  
Were busting chillin moves with our robot poses  
Busting chillin moves with our robot poses

Phinedroids and Ferbots  
Were Phinedroids and Ferbots  
And were here to stay  
Now our work is done  
Were shutting down for the day  
Weve Learned our lesson were switching to decaf all day  
  
 Our imaginations  
Were Phinedroids and Ferbots  
And were here to stay  
Now our work is done  
Were shutting down for the day
