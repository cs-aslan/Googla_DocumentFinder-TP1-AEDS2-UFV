You know what this is  
Still The Carter 2 people  
Still The Carter 2 people  
Yeah you still in the carter 2 people  
  
Hey yeah  
All I have in this world is a pistol and a promise  
A fist full of dollars a list full of problems  
Ill address them like PO Boxes  
Yeah Im from New Orleans the Creole cockpit  
We so out of it zero tolerance  
Gangster gumbo Ill serve em a pot of it  
Im wealthy still fuckin with that block shit  
Wet your ass up head to feet till your sock a drip  
Dont slip you might fall and bust your ass  
No snakes at the carter tell the gardener to cut the grass  
I hear em but they talking under mass  
Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass  
Thats Cash Money honey pie  
We aint runnin we dont hide screamin fuck the other side  
Dont get caught on it this the dailiest grind  
Ill put your heart on it and walk on it  
The chalks only for the art homie  
How they trace ya after I erase ya  
Look around we at war and you still in preparation  
Im riding for them reparations no patience  
Slow paper is better than no paper  
Fast money dont last too long you gotta pace it  
You gotta know that paper  
If you got it from a caper you gotta blow that paper  
Gotta know that photofobia no Kodak moments  
Feds walls with my pictures on em  
Nah I aint even in the school yearbook  
I dont do too much posin got a cool killer look  
Career crook get your career took  
Im back like a brassiere hook  
Bitch cheer camouflage gear the hunters here  
Better play it by ear you aint nothing but a deer  
Around here and this here is The Carter  
Serve it while its hot out the pot to your mama  
And Slim tell me aint nobody hotter  
But get your boys some different sauce I want the whole enchilada  
I got em by the collar watch me drop em  
On the head at the bottom  
You aint gotta shoot em cause I already shot em  
And I aint gotta get em cause I already got em
