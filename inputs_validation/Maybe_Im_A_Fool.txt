rap intro by derick johnson  
Dangerous lover  
With the bluegreen eyes  
Slides into the room  
Hes got trouble on his mind  
Maybe youre misunderstood  
So come and lie here by my side  
cause your love it hurts so good  
Every time every time  
Maybe Im a fool for loving you  
Maybe Im a fool  
Maybe Im a fool for wanting you  
Maybe Im a fool  
But loves so hard to find  
I keep searching every time  
Foolish words spoken  
Forgotten in the night  
When the sun meets the ocean  
I wanna be here by your side  
Let me give you all those things  
That money just cant buy  
cause your love it hurts so good  
Dont ask me why dont ask me why  
Maybe Im a fool for loving you  
Maybe Im a fool  
Maybe Im a fool for wanting you  
Maybe Im a fool  
Maybe Im a fool but I love you baby baby
