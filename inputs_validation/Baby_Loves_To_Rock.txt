More and more I been thinkin bout love  
Love aint all I been thinkin of  
Some people do and some people dont  
Some people will and say they wont  
  
But my baby loves to rock  
And my baby loves to roll  
My baby loves to all night long  
My baby loves to rock  
  
More and more Im thinkin bout sssex  
The more I think the better it gets  
More and more Im thinkin bout sssex  
The more I think the worse it gets  
  
But my baby loves to rock  
And my baby loves to roll  
My baby loves to all night long  
My baby loves to rock  
  
She loves to rock  
She loves to rock  
She loves to rock  
  
But my baby loves to rock  
And my baby loves to roll  
My baby loves to all night long  
My baby loves to rock  
  
She loves to rock  
She loves to rock  
She loves to rock  
  
In the morning in the evening  
In the summer in the winter  
In my car in the night in an airplane  
Not in russia  
  
She loves to rock she loves to rock  
She loves to rock she loves to rock  
She loves to rock  
  
More and more I been thinkin bout love  
Love aint all I been thinkin of
