Got out really early from the factory driving like a nut in the rain  
Dont think I was acting so hysterically  
But I didnt see a thing until it came  
Man the drunks were verbal in the takeaway  
Beating up the Chinese at the counter  
I put a few inside me at the end of the day  
I took out my revenge on the revolution counter  
Crawling from the wreckage crawling from the wreckage  
Youd think by now at least that half my brain would get the message  
Crawling from the wreckage crawling from the wreckage  
Into a brand new car  
In walks Bud with his exploding nose  
Hed been giving it maximum today  
He shouted how the devil you in trouble I suppose  
But all you ever do is run away  
Turned up the motor into hyperdrive  
I wasnt gonna take any of that  
Dont get bright ideas about a suicide  
Cause all I ever hear is zoom wam bam past me  
Crawling from the wreckage crawling from the wreckage  
Youd think by now at least that half my brain would get the message  
Crawling from the wreckage crawling from the wreckage  
Into a brand new car  
Crawling crawling crawling from the wreckage  
Crawling crawling crawling from the wreckage  
Crawling crawling crawling from the wreckage  
Crawling from the wreckage crawling from the wreckage  
Bits of me are scattered in the trees and in the hedges  
Crawling from the wreckage crawling from the wreckage  
Into a brand new car  
Nothing seem to happen that aint happened before  
I see it all through flashes of depression  
I dry up my drink and people running for the door  
God I make some kind of impression  
Cause when Im disconnected from the driving wheel  
Im only half the man I should be  
But metal hitting metal isnt all I feel  
And everything is good as it possibly could be  
Crawling from the wreckage crawling from the wreckage  
Youd think by now at least that half my brain would get the message  
Crawling from the wreckage crawling from the wreckage  
Into a brand new car  
Crawling from the wreckage crawling from the wreckage  
Bits of me are scattered in the trees and in the hedges  
Crawling from the wreckage crawling from the wreckage  
Into a brand new car  
Crawling from the wreckage crawling from the wreckage  
Crawling crawling crawling from the wreckage
