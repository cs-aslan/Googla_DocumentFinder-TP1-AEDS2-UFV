There you go  
Youre like fireworks and its the fourth of July  
I cant turn away look what youve done to me  
One more dance and Im taking over  
I need your touch  
One more dance when youre lickin your lips  
Im gonna have to rush this night  
We should get outta here  
Might have to party for two  
Then you say you love me  
That talk is dangerous  
I want you like I know you want me  
Am I saying too much  
Right now say what you want to  
You cant make me blush  
  
Step through the door  
Like you know youre fine  
Step on my floor  
Like you know youre fine  
Youre on fire  
But you play it cool  
Every eye on you  
  
So dont blame me  
For wanting you just too much  
Youre sexy  
And what you needs a sexy love  
All I see  
Every time I look at you

You look so sexy so sexy in my bed  
You look so sexy so sexy in my head  
You look so sexy so sexy in my bed

And just focus on us  
I want you to feel like youre having the time of your life  
And I cant wait to start like youre waiting accept my invite  
  
Step through the door
