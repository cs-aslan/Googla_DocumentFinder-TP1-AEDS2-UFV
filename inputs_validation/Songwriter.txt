He sits with the guitar on his knee thinking of love that hes had  
If it makes a sound he writes it down hes a songwriter  
Hes trying to paint little pictures of mountains  
Turn little teardrops into mighty fountains hes a songwriter  
He smiles at the good lines frown at the bad lines  
Cries with the sad parts rewrites the bad parts hes a songwriter  
He looks through the window of life some people think hes a joke  
But who can tell the thing might sell hes a songwriter  
Hes trying to paint  
Thank you for hearing my tune now Ill get out of your room  
Its late you know Ive got to go Im a songwriter mhm mhm
