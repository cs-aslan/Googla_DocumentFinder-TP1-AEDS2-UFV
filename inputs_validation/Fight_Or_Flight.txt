Were ready to go  
Ticking like a bomb thats about to blow  
Its taking control  
Pulling at your feet like an undertow  
You dont really know  
If youre all that capable  
But youve been told  
  
Figure it out  
Dont pretend youre stupid  
Sort it out  
Go make yourself useful  
  
Youre better than dead  
You really made a mess with the words you said  
So easily fed  
The flames of the fire rise above your head  
They want to be led  
Youve joined the ranks instead  
Theres a voice in your head  
  
I cant figure it out  
Any more than the generation before me  
I cant figure it out  
How we got where we are today  
I cant figure it out  
Any more than the generation before me  
I cant figure it out  
Weve got to fight not to fade away
