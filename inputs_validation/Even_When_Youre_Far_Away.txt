I wonder why  
I could never hate you  
Even when you look away  
I always love you in my soul  
Its just the way we happen to be  
Its just the way it happens to be  
We dont know how to love love without fear  
  
I tell you why  
I could never hate you  
Even when youre far away  
I know you love me in your soul  
Its just the way we happen to be  
Its just the way it happens to be  
We dont know how to love love without fear  
  
Part of me will always be with you  
Part of you is growing in me  
Its just the way we happen to be  
Its just the way it happens to be  
We dont know how to love love without fear  
  
We dont know how  
How to tell each other  
Theres nothing we can do  
I saw your soul and you saw mine  
Its just the way we happen to be  
Its just the way it happens to be  
We always know inside our soul that love is there
