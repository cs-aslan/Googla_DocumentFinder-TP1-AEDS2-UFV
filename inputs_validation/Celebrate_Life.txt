Were living in the world  
With a lot of crazy people  
Were living in the world  
With psychopaths  
Everyone of them wants to rule  
The world  
Some people have the front row seat  
At the top of the world  
Some people have nothing but just a life  
Problems are there left and right  
Liars cheaters politicians and black stabbers  
Making life a little bit more unbearable  
It is a give or take world  
So you got to take what you can when you can  
Make the best of it Wo  
Chorus  
Say yeah Celebrate life  
Say year Life is good  
Were living in the world  
With demented people  
Theres a man standing on the edge of the bridge  
Ready to end it all  
Some people dont know what life is worth  
Some people have the front row seat at the gates of hell  
You could be having problems right now  
But theres no problem worth your life  
People fight to stay alive every day  
Cause they know life is worth more than worries  
So you got to take what you can when can  
Make the best of it Wo Ho Wo Ho  
Chorus  
Say Yeahyeah celebrate life  
Say Yeah yeah life is good  
Till fade
