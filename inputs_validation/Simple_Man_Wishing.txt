I get up to get a real bite of life  
A slice of love no goodbyes  
Still keeps me satisfied  
I wanna hold on to that feeling  
When youre not sure if your dreaming  
I love to fall asleep next to you  
  
Im just a simple man wishing  
My queen stays by my side  
And if she wants me Ill promise to fight  
Im just a simple man wishing  
My nightmares stays untrue  
And if they do  Ill give my life to you  
  
I get up to see the sun set again  
Wishing that it never ends  
Watching lovers turn to friends  
I wanna feel like believing  
Knowing you gave me a meaning  
I love to fall asleep next to you  
  
Im just a simple man  
My queen stays by my side  
And if she wants me Ill promise to fight  
Im just a simple man wishing  
My nightmares stays untrue  
And if they do  Ill give my life to you  
  
In a world where everything remains in shadows  
The only ray of light is knowing that  
Youll be by my side  
  
Im just a simple man  
My queen stays by my side  
And if she wants me Ill promise to fight  
Im just a simple man wishing  
My nightmares stays untrue  
And if they do  Ill give my life to you
