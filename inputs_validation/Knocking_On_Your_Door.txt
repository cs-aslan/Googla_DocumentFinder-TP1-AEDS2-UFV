Send me cross the river  
Take me cross the ocean  
I just need to be somewhere  
To sort out my emotions  
You know its up to you  
You know exactly what to do  
I cant take it anymore  
I dont want to come back  
  
Chorus  
Knocking on your door  
Down there on the floor  
I dont want to come back  
Knocking on your door  
Breaking every law  
I dont want to come back  
Knocking on your door  
  
Love to see me shiver  
Youd like to see me break down break down  
Ive just got to hide my face  
Wont see your satisfaction  
You know its down to you  
You know this thing im going through  
I cant take it anymore  
I dont want to come back  
  
Chorus  
  
You know its up to you  
You know exactly what to do  
I cant take it anymore  
I dont want to come back  
  
Chorus until fade
