How does one decide  
That the methods hes using  
They just dont jive  
To truly believe and keep trying  
Over and over again  
Living in hopes  
That someday youll be in with the winners  
  
When will one change his mind  
And jump the fence  
For the dial a sign  
Its a sad thing its a bad thing  
But so necessary  
Living in hopes  
That someday youll be in with the winners  
  
Now what what i dont know can you tell me what  
What is success  
Is it do your own thing  
Or to join the rest  
And if you truly believe it  
And try over and over again  
Living in hopes  
That someday youll be in with the winners  
  
Oh tell me what it is  
Sweet success  
  
Oh tell me what it is  
Sweet success
