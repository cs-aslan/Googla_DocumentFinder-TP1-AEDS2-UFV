Walls are closing  
Anxiously  
Channel surfing  
Frantically  
  
Burning City  
Smoke and fire  
Planes were certain  
Faith inspired  
  
No clues  
A complete surprise  
Wholl be  
Coming home tonight  
  
Heads all turning  
Towards the sky  
Towers crumble  
Heroes die  
  
Who would wish this  
On our people  
And proclaim  
That His will be done  
Scriptures they heed have misled them  
All praise their sacrificed sons  
All praise their sacrificed sons  
  
Teach them  
What to think and feel  
Your ways  
So enlightening  
  
Words they preach  
I cant relate  
If Gods true Love  
Are acts of Hate  
  
Who would wish this  
On our people  
And proclaim  
That His will be done  
Scriptures they heed have misled them  
All praise their sacrificed sons  
All praise their sacrificed sons  
  
God on high  
Our mistake  
Will mankind be extinct  
Theres no time to waste  
Who serves the truth  
For Heavens sake
