Baby all Ive got is this beatup leather bag  
And everything I own dont fill up half  
But dont you worry bout the way I pack  
All I care about is getting back real soon  
A goodbye kiss is all I need from you  
  
Chorus  
Cause Im carrying your love with me  
West Virginia down to Tennessee  
Ill be moving with the good Lords speed  
Carrying your love with me  
Its my strength for holding on  
Every minute that I have to be gone  
Ill have everything Ill ever need  
Carrying your love with me  
  
On a lonely highway stuck out in the rain  
Darling all I have to do is speak your name  
The clouds rollback and the waters part  
The sun starts shining in my heart for you  
Youre right there in everything I do  
  
Chorus x2
