Its curtain call  
Guess you cant outrun  
All the truth  
  
Weve staggered on  
With broken parts  
Like you do  
  
But its alright thrills will fade  
Weve had some good laughs on the way  
Thank you for coming along  
To bring it all home  
  
Well Id take them back  
Those early years  
Oh anytime  
  
As we make our beds  
We get to shine  
Once in a while  
  
But its alright thrills will fade  
Weve had some good laughs on the way  
Thank you for coming along  
To bring it all home  
  
Its alright thrills will fade  
Weve had some good laughs along the way  
Thank you for coming along  
Bring it all home  
Thank you for coming along  
Lets bring it all home
