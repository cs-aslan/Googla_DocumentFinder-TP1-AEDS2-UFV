Id rather be rich it sounds a little funny  
If diggin a ditch would earn me lots of money  
Id dig like a fool in the land of milk and honey  
Where everythings cool provided you have money yeah yeah yeah  
Id rather be rich just short of being greedy  
Im eager to switch to hell with being needy  
Id rather be rich the truth of cash is tragic  
The systems a bitch but money works like magic yeah yeah yeah  
Money makes the world go round  
Buy and sell it by the pound  
Bitter truth that I have found  
Food to eat shoes on your feet  
Maybe some heat you live with defeat  
  
Money gets you justice money sets you free  
Money makes it possible to be or not to be  
Money is the power money is the key  
Sad and so unfortunate but real as it can be yeah yeah yeah  
Id rather be rich than what the other choice is  
My thumb out to hitch or riding in Rolls Royces  
Cause I aint no fool in the land of milk and honey  
Where everythings cool until you lose your money
