She looks so beautiful with the top down  
Lets jump inside and take a trip to town  
  
Lets hit the road Lets make some miles and spend a little time  
And go to town And when we get there well stop our only dime  
  
Lets hit the road And go to town  
Lets hit the road And go to town  
  
On the freeway in the middle of the commute  
Bumper to bumper in a giant cloud of fumes  
  
Lets hit the road From city to city everyone is on the move  
And go to town Try to find the energy to stay in the groove  
  
Lets hit the road And go to town  
Lets hit the road And go to town  
  
When Im rolling on those big round wheels  
Puts me in heaven thats exactly how I feel  
  
Just jump inside and turn the key  
Your satisfaction is guaranteed  
  
Lets hit the road And go to town  
Lets hit the road And go to town  
  
Someones tryin to find the peoples fuel  
No fear of failure for that crazy fool  
  
Lets hit the road And go to town  
Lets hit the road And go to town  
  
Lets hit the road And go to town
