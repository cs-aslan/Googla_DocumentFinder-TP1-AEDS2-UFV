Get Off Me Dog  
Yo 2 Dope man check this out man  
You know what the word on the streets is dawg  
The word on the streets is that you a bitch  
Whats up with that man  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
Motherfuckers tweek gotta tweek while ya tweek  
Golley guys rhythm cause me on mic my on meek  
Get off me dog before I sting your chin  
I let my nutsac flap in the wind  
cause Im 2 Dope clown loco G  
And its one chop two boing boom chop three  
In the melon in the back of the melon  
One black two black eyeballs swelling  
Always back with stickin taking back whats more to lordy  
Sippin on the blunt puffing on the 40  
Or the OZ muthafuck me  
Fuck Stuart Frankie they call me  
Jelly jello boy cause my nutsac jiggles  
And when its cold out my nutsac shrivles  
And crawls at my booty all warm and snug  
And gets chased out by the booty ho bug  
Goddamn I aint who I am  
Im always fucking fat bitches named Pam  
Nineteen years of breathing smog  
Has got me mental  
So get off me dog  
Chorus 14x  
Get Off Me Dog
