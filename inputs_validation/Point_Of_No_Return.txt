The gentle taste of orange  
A garden of fruit and flowers is what I embrace  
In ocean blue eyes in each ones an island  
Im stranded within your love  
And as I fall deeper than ever  
And as we kiss were each others guide into the unknown  
Where men do not return where men do not forget  
The sweetest suicide as if we dont exist but live  
The presence of angels the inscense of Indochine  
The quietness of movements the slowness of Africa  
A Point of know return no way out of here  
Nothing compares to you  
Anything goes  
And as I breathe deeper than ever  
Im coming home Im coming home to the unknown  
Where men do not return
