With his fools gold stacked up all around him  
From a killing in the market on the war  
The children left King Midas there as they found him  
In his counting house where nothing counts but more  
  
Chorus  
And he thought he heard the echo of a penny whistle band  
And the laughter from a distant caravan  
And the brightly painted line of circus wagons in the sand  
Fading through the door into summer  
  
Well its travel onto maybe next year s places  
As a tradein for a name upon the door  
And he pays for every year he cannot buy back with his tears  
As he finds out theres been no one keeping score  
  
Chorus
