How could I see you when I was so blind  
How could I grasp you when I was far behind  
How could I hear you when I was so deaf  
How could I get up when I had been left  
  
But You said dont worry  
For Ive healed the blind man  
And Ive set the captives free  
And You said dont worry  
For all youve gotta do  
Is put your trust in Me  
  
How could I be clean  
When I was so dirty  
How could I be made whole  
When I was torn apart  
Make me whole make me whole  
Make me whole again
