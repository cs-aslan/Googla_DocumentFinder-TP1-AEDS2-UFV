Do do do do do do do do what a surprise  
Do do do do do do do do what a surprise  
Ooh Ooh Ooh what a surprise  
  
She stood there looking like she didnt care  
Looking right through me like I wasnt there  
Couldve bowled me over when I realized  
She was cooking me breakfast what a surprise  
  
What a surprise baby oh what a night  
Looking real good she was moving just right  
I cant begin to describe all the charms  
I held in my arms what a surprise  
  
Oohh oohh she didnt say nothing not a word  
Oohh oohh I knew she was telling me something  
Had to go back for a second helping  
  
Out of the blue and right into my heart  
Im telling you you cant keep us apart  
Lights up the sky like the stars in the night  
Who would have thunk it what a surprise  
  
Bridge  
  
What a surprise baby oh what a night  
Looking real good she was moving just right  
Lights up the sky like the stars in the sky  
Who would have thunk it what a surprise  
  
Ad lib first line and fade
