You gotta believe we can change the world  
Dont turn a blind eye to tomorrows world  
But on the good side looking out  
Dont take for granted the silent shout  
The hands of time are rolling past  
To turn the tide we must move fast  
Lets share the hope and pull some strings  
We hold the answer this vision sings  
Theyre holding on  
But for how long  
Lets set them free  
Put your helping hands together rockin on for survival  
Gotta take a stand time to make a plan dont sit idle  
We are the key to the dreams  
Its not as hard as it seems  
No  
Get up and put your hands together  
All your helping hands  
Oh yeah  
Were three steps down youre two steps back  
No more widgin and thats a fact  
A call to arms lets take a stand  
Its up to you to lend a helping hand  
Theyre holding on  
But for how long  
Lets set them free  
Put your helping hands together rockin on for survival  
Gotta take a stand time to make a plan dont sit idle  
We are the key to the dreams  
Its not as hard as it seems  
No  
Get up and put your hands together  
All your helping hands yeah  
Were the thunder in the storm  
That brings the winds of change  
Together we can overcome  
And start a brand new day  
Put your helping hands together rockin on for survival Yeah yeah  
Gotta take a stand its time to make a plan dont sit idle No no no no  
Put your helping hands together rockin on for survival
