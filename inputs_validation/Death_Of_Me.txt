Weve got to stop this crazy carrying on  
Its gonna be the death of you stop this crazy  
Carrying on its gonna be the death of me  
Its gonna be the end you see its gonna be the death of we  
  
If we dont stop this crazy carrying on  
Its gonna be the death of you stop this crazy  
Carrying on its gonna be the death of me  
Its gonna be the end you see its gonna be the death of me  
  
And I feel like Im gonna die I dont feel so  
Good inside why babywhy why why  
But I had a good time you know I had a good night  
  
Weve got to stop this crazy carrying on  
Its gonna be the death of you stop this crazy  
Carrying on its gonna be the death of me  
Its gonna be the end you see  
Its gonna be the death of me
