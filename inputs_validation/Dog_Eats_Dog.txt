Thenardier  
Heres a hint of gold  
Stuck into a tooth  
Pardon me mieseur  
You wont be needing it no more  
  
Shouldnt be too hard to sell  
Add it to the pile  
Add it to the stack  
Here among the sewer rats  
A breath away from hell  
You get accustomed to the smell  
  
Well someones got to clean them up my friends  
Bodies on the highway  
Law and order upside down  
Someones got to collect their odds and ends  
As a service to the town  
  
Heres a tasty ring  
Pretty little thing  
Wouldnt want to waste it  
That would really be a crime  
Thank you sir Im in your debt  
  
Heres a little toy  
Take it off the boy  
His hearts no longer going  
And hes lived his little time  
But his watch is ticking yet  
  
Well someones got to clean them up my friends  
Before the little harvest disappears into the mud  
Someones got to collect their odds and ends  
When the gutters run with blood  
  
Its a world where the dog eats dog  
And they kill for the bones in the street  
And God in his heaven  
He dont interfere  
Cause hes dead as the stiffs at my feet  
  
I raise my eyes to see the heavens  
And only the moon looks down  
The harvest moon shines down
