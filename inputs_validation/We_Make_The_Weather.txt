Heaven is a somewhere locked inside and I must find the key  
Wish Id never locked the door  
Ordinary things in life are where this heaven likes to be  
Hold the sky feet on the floor  
Hold the sky feet on the floor  
We make our sun to shine  
We make our space and time  
We make the weather  
We make it change  
Hell is not somewhere but a state of mind I choose to be  
When my faith in life has gone  
Cruelty rebounds to hurt itself puts shackles on the free  
Vicious circle carries on  
Hold the sky feet on the floor  
We make our sun to shine  
We make our space and time  
We make the weather  
We make it change  
We make the weather  
We make it change  
Time to judge the act dont judge the actor of the circumstance  
Time to free compassions world  
Life is not the end were passing through like bubbles on the sea  
Time to learn and time to mend  
Hold the sky feet on the floor  
We make our sun to shine  
We make our space and time  
We make the weather  
We made a change  
We make the weather  
We make a change
