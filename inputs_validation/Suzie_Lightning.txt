Written by Warren Zevon1991 Zevon Music  
She only sleeps on planes  
Shes tired of going nowhere  
Shes in Yugoslavia  
Working in a miniseries  
Suzie Lightning  
I built a world for her  
Suzie lightning  
I need a girl from earth  
Shes in Hungary  
She sends post cards home  
Does she think of me  
Im in Hollywood  
Suzie Lightning  
Takes no prisoners  
Suzie Lightning  
No use crying about it  
No use trying to hold on  
She lights up the sky  
Then shes gone  
She dont have time for love  
She dont need me now  
Cant she see Im burning up  
Burning down burning out  
Suzie Lightning  
I built a world for her  
Suzie Lightning  
I need a girl from earth
