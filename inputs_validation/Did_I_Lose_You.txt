The tables set for 2 but Im the only one  
Thats how you left me here with a smoking gun  
Thought we were solid wood but we are plastic trees  
I swear I hear you laughing cause the jokes on me  
  
Oh oh oh  
Can you lose what you never did have  
Its hard to hold there in your hands  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you did I lose you  
Letting go is the hardest part  
Like holding on to a shooting star  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you did I lose you  
  
But I saw your colors in a shining light  
But it was just a sketch of you in black and white  
What kind of crazy spell did you leave me on  
It takes some kiss and tell and then you were gone  
  
Oh oh oh  
Can you lose what you never did have  
Its hard to hold there in your hands  
Was my assumpation running too fast  
Did I lose you did I lose you  
Letting go is the hardest part  
Like holding on to a shooting star  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you did I lose  
  
Oh oh oh  
Can you lose what you never did have  
Its hard to hold there in your hands  
Was my assumpation running too fast  
Did I lose you did I lose you  
  
Oh oh oh  
Can you lose what you never did have  
Its hard to hold there in your hands  
Was my assumpation running too fast  
Did I lose you did I lose you  
Letting go is the hardest part  
Like holding on to a shooting star  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you did I lose  
  
Can you lose what you never did have  
Its hard to hold there in your hands  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you
