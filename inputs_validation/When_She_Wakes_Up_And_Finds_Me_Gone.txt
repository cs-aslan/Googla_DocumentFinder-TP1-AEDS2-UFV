With a trembling pen in hand I try the best I can  
To write all the reasons I cant stay  
And I hope shell understand I cant leave her like a man  
Cause a man would never leave her this way  
  
A note of things I shouldve said  
Lays beside her sleeping head  
As I turn and make my way off in the night  
By the time the mornings breaking  
My heart will still be aching  
Every time I think of what Ive left behind  
  
Cause I dont want to see me leaving in her eyes  
And I cant stand to watch her watch me make her cry  
And I dont know a right way I can do her wrong  
So I dont want to be here in the morning  
When she wakes up and finds me gone  
  
It hurts to know how much shell hurt Ive told myself things could be worse  
And Ive convinced myself shes better off this way  
By the time she finds Im gone  
Ill be a long long way from home  
When she reads a note of things I couldnt say  
  
Cause I dont want to see me leaving in her eyes  
And I cant stand to watch her watch me make her cry  
And I dont know a right way I can do her wrong  
So I dont want to be here in the morning  
When she wakes up and finds me gone  
  
Lord I dont want to be here in the morning  
When she wakes up and finds me gone
