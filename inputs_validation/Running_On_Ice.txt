Theres a lot of tension in this town  
I know its building up inside of me  
Ive got all the symptoms and the side effects  
Of city life anxiety  
I could never understand why the urban attitude  
Is so superior  
In a world of high rise ambition  
Most peoples motives are ulterior  
Sometimes I feel as though Im running on ice  
Paying the price too long  
Kind of get the feeling that Im running on ice  
Where did my life go wrong  
Im a cosmopolitan sophisticate  
Of culture and intelligence  
The culmination of technology  
And civilized experience  
But Im carrying the weight of all the useless junk  
A modern man accumulates  
Im a statistic in a system  
That a civil servant dominates  
And all that means is that Im running on ice  
Caught in the vise so strong  
Im slipping and sliding cause Im running on ice  
Where did my life go wrong  
Youve got to run  
Youve got to run  
As fast as I can climb  
A new disaster every time I turn around  
As soon as I get one fire put out  
Theres another building burning down  
They say this highways going my way  
But I dont know where its taking me  
Its a bad waste a sad case a rat race  
Its breaking me  
I get no traction cause Im running on ice  
Its taking me twice as long  
I get a bad reaction cause Im running on ice  
Where did my life go wrong  
Youve got to run  
Youve got to run  
Running on ice  
Running on ice  
Running on ice  
Running on ice
