I got a booking with the airlines  
Pack up and going to go  
Im gonna leave here by plane darling  
Because railway is much too slow  
Im goin back to my hometown  
Where Im better known  
Cause you havent done nothing darling  
But ruin a happy home  
Now when the sun sinks in the hillside  
The one you love will be gone  
And I know I will be blue darling  
But somehow Ill just travel on  
Now would you rather care to kiss me  
Or would you prefer to just say goodbye  
Cause I will turn and leave you darling  
I dont want to see you cry
