Can you hear the song moving on the wind  
Calling us home drawing us in  
Its a wave of love thats melting all resistance  
Can you feel it when it starts  
Its within the reach of our hearts  
Itll change the world around us if we listen  
Its the living breathing message  
Of the mercy of our god  
  
chorus  
The song is alive  
Stirring hope in the soul dont you know  
Its the heartbeat of life  
Moving us with a love  
Thats never ever ever gonna die  
The song is alive  
  
Its pushing down walls driving out doubt  
No power on earths gonna drown it out  
And in the middle of the night his voice will lead us  
And the music plays on  
When we start to sing the song  
No nothings gonna stop the faithful love of jesus  
Its the living breathing message  
Of the mercy of our god  
  
repeat chorus  
  
Welling up in us a love beyond compare  
Spilling from the lips of the believers everywhere  
  
Dont you know dont you know dont you know  
The song is alive  
Dont you know dont you know dont you know  
  
repeat chorus  
  
Its pushing down walls its driving out doubt  
Dont you know
