Once upon a time not so very long ago  
There wasnt such a thing as a rockn roll show  
You had to sit at home and listen to the radio  
  
Then came a man with a rockinguitar  
Found himself a beat and he played it near and far  
Everybody danced and sang and let the good times roll  
  
Again again again again again again again again  
Why dont you do it why dont you do it again  
Again again again again again again again again  
Why dont you do it why dont you do it again  
  
He travelled round the world in a rocknroll band  
He stood there like a giant with a guitar in his hand  
Everybody danced and sang and let the good times roll  
  
Nobody cared about the clothes he would wear  
Nobody cared about the colour of his hair  
Everybody came to see and let the good times roll  
  
Again again again again again again again again  
Why dont you do it why dont you do it again  
Again again again again again again again again  
Why dont you do it why dont you do it again  
  
Now weve got the rhythm in us now weve got the rock  
Time didnt matter never living by the clock  
Everybody came to hear him playing his rocknroll  
  
Then came a line when the music didnt rhyme  
He couldnt find the rhythm cause he couldnt find the time  
But still the people came to listen to the good times roll  
  
Again again again again again again again again  
Why dont you do it why dont you do it again  
Again again again again again again again again  
Why dont you do it why dont you do it again  
  
Again again again again again again again again  
Why dont you do it why dont you do it again  
Again again again again again again again again  
Why dont you do it why dont you do it again  
Why dont you do it why dont you do it again
