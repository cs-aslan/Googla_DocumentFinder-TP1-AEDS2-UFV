Soft breeze whispering trees  
The summer winds are sighing  
The leaves are lullabying  
Violins are all around you  
I can hear the chords resound  
Of sounding brass  
That seems to say Ive found  
Ive found you Ive found you  
  
Strange music in my ears  
Only now as you spoke did it start  
Strange music of the sphere  
Could its lovely hum be coming from my heart  
You appear and I hear song sublime  
Song that Im incapable of  
So Dear let me hold you near  
While we treasure evry measure  
So that time can never change  
The strange new music of love  
  
So Dear let me hold you near  
While we treasure evry measure  
So that time can never change  
The strange new music of love
