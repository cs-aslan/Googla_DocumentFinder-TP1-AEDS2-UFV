That old Bilbao moon I wont forget it soon  
That old Bilbao moon just like a big balloon  
That old Bilbao moon would rise above the dune  
While Tonys Beach Saloon rocked with an oldtime tune  
Wed sing a song the whole night long and I can still recall  
Those were the greatest those were the greatest  
Those were the greatest those were the greatest  
Those were the greatest nights of them all  
No paint was on the door no paint was on the door  
The grass grew through the floor the grass grew through the floor  
Of Tonys Two By Four of Tonys Two By Four  
On the Bilbao shore on the Bilbao shore  
But there were friends galore howdy do howdy do  
And there was beer to pour chugalug chugalug  
And moonlight on the shore and the moon shines above  
That old Bilbao shore on the shore not the floor  
Wed sing all night with all our might and I can still recall  
Those were the greatest those were the greatest  
Those were the greatest those were the greatest  
Those were the greatest nights of them all  
That old Bilbao moon I wont forget it soon  
That old Bilbao moon just like a big balloon  
That old Bilbao moon would rise above the dune  
While Tonys Beach Saloon rocked with an oldtime tune  
Wed sing all night with all our might and I can still recall  
Those were the greatest those were the greatest  
Those were the greatest those were the greatest  
Those were the greatest nights of them all
