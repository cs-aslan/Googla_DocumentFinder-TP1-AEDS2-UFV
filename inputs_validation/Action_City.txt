Suddenly theres a shadow on a nation  
Suddenly its a changing situation  
Fear is on the face of every tiger as the jungle grows  
Suddenly people running never walking  
Nobody wants to know nobodys talking  
But rushing through the air  
I feel the wind of change about to blow  
  
Chorus  
Watch out tonight the dogs are down in action city  
There out tonight theres trouble down in action city  
  
Watching the police running from the station  
Suddenly flashing lights and confrotation  
The devil walks the streets  
Just as the flames of hell begin to grow  
  
Chorus  
  
Its a brave new world Its a brave new world  
Such a brave new world  
Well I dont know where its going  
But its heading for some changes I know  
  
People are wondering why theres such confusion  
There is a face of youth with disillusion  
Dont look for the reasons  
They were sprayed on every wall I know  
  
Chorus  
  
Its a brave new world Its a brave new world  
Such a brave new world  
Well I dont know where its going  
But its heading for some changes I know
