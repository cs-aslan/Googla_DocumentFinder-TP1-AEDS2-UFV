The way you looked at me tonight  
Ive never seen that look  
In your eyes before  
But then again  
I dont think Ive ever looked  
Had the time to spare  
The will to share with you  
What have I missed  
What have I done  
Im gonna turn back the tide  
Like its just begun  
Time changes time changes  
Time changes for the better  
After all weve been through  
Love dont come easy for me  
The way you looked into my eyes  
I could see the hurt  
I saw through your disguise  
Just give me time  
I can make it up to you  
Let me heal the pain  
Im scared of losing you  
What have I missed  
Where have I gone wrong  
If I could turn back the time  
So weve just begun  
Time changes  
Time changes  
Time changes for the better  
After all weve been through  
Love dont come easy for me  
For me  
What have I missed  
What have I done  
Im gonna turn back the tide  
So weve just begun  
Time changes  
Time changes  
Time changes for the better  
After all weve been through  
Love dont come easy for me  
Love dont come easy  
After all weve been through  
Love dont come easy for me  
Love dont come easy
