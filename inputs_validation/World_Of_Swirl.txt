I hit the street running had an angle in mind  
Looking for a shelter doing double overtime  
I get a little crazy but I wont be denied  
Gotta find the time that takes the inside outside  
  
Tumbling in a world of swirl  
Rumbling in a world of swirl  
In a world of swirl  
Everythings hazy everythings a blur  
  
Isnt it amazing checking outta where we were  
Its so unpredictable at the end of my rope  
Gotta skate the ledge outta this kaleidoscope  
Tumbling in a world of swirl  
  
Rumbling in a world of swirl  
In a world of swirl  
In this cloud of dust youve got to keep steady  
Hang on you must you better get ready  
  
Over the ledge ripping the curl  
Riding the edge off into to twirl  
Tumbling in a world of swirl  
Rumbling in a world of swirl  
  
In a world of swirl
