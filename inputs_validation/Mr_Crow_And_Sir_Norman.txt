Ventrilloquist was he little boy sat on his knee  
The people knew that the show was but the best one in the land  
Until the night before the act  
The dummys clothes had all been packed away  hed gone  
And hed left poor mr crow right in the lurch  
  
You know hes gone far away  
I hear his voice go laughing  
What of all the years we shared  
  
Hello mr crow has your little boy left home  did he run away  
Well i hope hell soon be back to do the show  
Im sorry you must feel quite sad when your dummy runs away without a word  
That is all old mr crow had heard  
  
You know hes gone far away  
I hear his voice go laughing  
What of all the years we shared  
  
Now come on mr crow my dear  
Wed better have this gottle o geer  
  
Then one fateful night into the dressing room so bright  
Walked our friend tabledoll  
Mr crow cried tears of joy all in his tea  
The bad doll said kindly address me as sir norman little man i am a star  
And if you werent so old maybe id let you be my doll  
  
You know ive been far away  
Ive heard the people laugh  
Now im a great big star
