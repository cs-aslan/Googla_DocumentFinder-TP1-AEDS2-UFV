Stagger Lee met Billy and they go down to gambling  
  
Stagger Lee throwed seven  
Billy said that he throwed eight  
So Billy said hey Stagger Im gonna make my big attack  
Im gonna have to leave my knife in your back  
  
Why do you try to cheat  
And trample people under your feet  
Dont you know it is wrong  
To cheat the trying man  
So you better stop it is the wrong em boyo  
  
You lie steal cheat and deceit  
In such a small small game  
Dont you know it is wrong  
  
Billy Boy has been shot  
And Stagger Lees come out on top  
Dont you know it is wrong  
To cheat the trying man  
To cheat Stagger man  
Youd better stop  
So you must start all over againall over again  
You got to play it Billy play you got to play it Billy play  
And you will find it is the right em boyo  
  
But if you must lie and deceit  
And trample people under your feet  
Dont you know it is wrong  
It is the wrong em boyo
