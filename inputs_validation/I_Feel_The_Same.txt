Say goodbye  
Well I know its true  
I know youre leaving me but i  
Im leaving too  
You wont forget me  
Or the sound of my name  
Please believe me  
I feel the same  
  
It seems so empty now  
Close the door  
Aint it hard to believe that you ever  
Lived this way before  
All that nothing  
Causes all that pain  
Please believe me  
I feel the same  
  
Well this broken soul  
That I know a a heart thats breakin  
You cant make it whole  
Until you know what has been taken  
And all those pieces  
Uh that you find them all your own  
  
I said goodbye  
Now you know its true  
You said youre leaving me but honey i  
Im leaving too  
You wont forget me  
Or the sound of my name  
Please believe me  
I feel the same  
Please believe me  
I feel the same
