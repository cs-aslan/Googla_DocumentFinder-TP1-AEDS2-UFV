And it happens every time  
Give my love she leaves me behind  
Yes it happens every time  
The sorrow makes me lose my mind  
If shed only be as true as I am  
And listen to my love thats sayin  
Oh baby wont you stay mine  
Your lovin makes me feel so fine  
And someday baby youll find  
My love was gentle and kind  
Someday youll know that leaving me was wrong  
But dont bother all that time is gone  
And it happens every time  
Now I know its not worth the tryin  
So baby dont turn around  
Let my tears fall to the ground  
If shed only be as true as I am  
And listen to my love thats sayin
