Now I rest my head from  
Such an endless dreary time  
A time of hopes and happiness  
That had you on my mind  
Those days are gone and now it seems  
As if Ill get some rest  
But now and then Ill see you again  
And it puts my heart to the test  
  
Chorus  
So when are all my problems going to end  
Im understanding now that  
We are only friends  
To this day Im asking why  
I still think about you  
  
As the days go on I wonder  
Will this ever end  
I find it hard to keep control  
When youre with your boyfriend  
I do not mind if all I am is  
Just a friend to you  
But all I want to know right now  
Is if you think about me too  
  
Chorus x2
