Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
So I can take your hand and stroll about  
  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
So we can go on the streets and see the people smile  
  
Give me your hand  
So I could tell you that things will be alright  
The rooms still dark  
But it wont be so long  
And I can take you outside  
  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
So we can go to the park and roll about  
  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
So we can go to the docks and watch the boats go by  
  
Come on love give me your hand  
And things will be alright  
The rooms still cold  
But it wont be so long  
That we can go outside  
  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
So I could see your hair shining in the air  
  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
So I can see the sky reflected in your eyes  
  
Come on love dont be depressed  
Things will be alright  
The rooms too low  
But it wont be so long  
That we can be outside  
  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise  
Waiting for the sunrise
