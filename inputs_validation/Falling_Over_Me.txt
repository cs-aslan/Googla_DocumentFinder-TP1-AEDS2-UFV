Im standing in the center of the room  
Im watching boys follow girls perfume  
All is as it should be I assume  
Except for the distance between me and you  
  
Youre standing as a flower on the wall  
The room is still but were about to fall  
And all the names that brought us here  
Simply fade away  
  
Chorus  
Who you are is falling over me  
Who you are is falling over me  
Who you are is everything I need  
Who you are is everything I need  
Im hoping  
Im waiting  
Im praying you are the one  
Im hoping  
Im waiting  
Im praying you are the one  
  
I cant believe that night turned into today  
I used the line you were supposed to say  
And all the names that brought us here  
And now we have to thank  
  
Chorus  
  
If you are I will wait I will follow  
Im here to stay  
As long as were promised tomorrow  
I promise you today Ill wait  
Ill wait  
  
Chorus  
  
You are the one
