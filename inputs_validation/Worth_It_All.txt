Sometimes I wonder what its like  
To be living life on the other side  
Please dont make me feel like I dont know  
Whats out there  
Proof is written in the sky  
Hey wont you listen to me now  
It makes no difference if I wish upon a star  
The only absolute is that the Word of Life  
Is written on my heart  
Oh I believe  
Yes I believe  
  
Hey look at me living life for you  
When its good when its hard  
You know me you know my heart  
Yea yea yea I give up anything at all  
When you call  
All I know its worth it all  
  
I know youre scared to let me know you  
I know you got a heavy kind of soul  
And I know its harder to believe in love when youre  
Feeling all alone  
Theyre taking bets on who the lover of your soul  
And your heart is gonna be  
Theyre taking on all the things that get you down and out  
The moment you believe  
I believe in you  
Yes I believe in you
