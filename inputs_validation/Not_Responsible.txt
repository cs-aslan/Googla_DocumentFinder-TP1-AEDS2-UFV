Now let me ask you something  
Have you ever felt that you werent responsible for the things that you do  
When the girl that you are with is just too much  
She is so out of sight baby that all you can say is  
Well all right  
  
Im not responsible not responsible  
For anything I do when Im with you  
Im not responsible its impossible  
To be so very near and not feel part of you  
Youve got such a hold on me  
You make it seem so easy but its true oh yeah  
I get such a happy feeling  
Knowing that you feel the same way too

When you can make a man do what you want him to  
Im not responsible its impossible  
To be so very near and not know what to do  
You got such a hold on me  
You make it seem so easy but its true oh yeah  
I get such a happy feeling  
Knowing that you feel the same way too  
I get such a happy feeling  
Knowing that you feel the same way too
