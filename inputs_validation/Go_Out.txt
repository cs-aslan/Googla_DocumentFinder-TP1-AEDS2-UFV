Im gettin sad alone dancing with myself  
Greedy gogetter goal the luxury of stealth  
Im seedy and the whole dancing with myself  
I get into my bed I do it to myself

To the local by myself  
To the local

Verse 3  
To many western men its a problem left undone  
Imperious the sign the papers of luxury  
A greedy gogetter in the skybox she run alone  
She get ready to go she does it with herself  
  
She does it with herself  
She does it with herself  
She does it on her own  
She does it on her own
