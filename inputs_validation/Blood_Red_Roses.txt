Heavens above  
What on earth has this come to  
What have I done  
What can I do now to show you  
Theres still a chance  
If youre ready to make up  
Its not too late  
Cause Im not ready to break up  
I try to call  
But you dont hear at all  
  
Im sending roses  
Im sending blood red roses  
This burning in my heart  
Is tearing me apart  
Im sending roses  
Im sending blood red roses  
  
Youve got to understand  
Thats my heart in your hand  
  
Dont walk away  
We can get this heart mended  
Or am I the fool  
And has this love just ended  
I tried to call  
But you dont hear at all  
  
I gotta keep on trying  
To stop this love from dying  
  
Youve got to understand  
That my heart is in your hand  
  
Roses  
Im sending blood red roses  
This burning in my heart  
Is tearing me apart  
Im sending roses  
Im sending blood red roses  
  
Roses  
Im sending blood red roses  
This burning in my heart  
Tears me apart  
Roses  blood red roses  
Youve got to understand  
Thats my heart in your hand  
Roses  
Im sending blood red roses  
Cause this burning in my heart  
Tears me apart
