Lucky me  
I guessed the kind of man  
That you would turn out to be  
Now I wish that Id been wrong and then  
I could remember to breathe  
And all along the watchtower  
The night horses and the black mares  
Ready themselves for the outcome  
For the strange times upon us  
  
But what you didnt count on  
Was another mother of  
A mother revolution  
But what you didnt count on  
Was another mother of  
A mother revolution  
You couldve have me  
You couldve have me  
You couldve have me  
Right there beside you  
You couldve have me boy  
You couldve have me yeah  
You couldve have me  
Right there beside you  
  
A wife on loan in a cafe  
In old El Paso  
Next I go to  
Seven Gates and my sisters Bass Bonanza  
And all along her watchtower  
The night horses and the black mares  
Steady themselves for the outcome  
For the strange days upon us  
  
What you didnt count on  
Was another mother of  
A mother revolution
