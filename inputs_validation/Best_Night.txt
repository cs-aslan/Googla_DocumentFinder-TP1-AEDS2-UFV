Madonna Best Night lyrics  
  
You can call me M tonight  
You can be my man tonight  
Its gonna be like this thats right  
Give you love that youll never forget  
  
The city is our playground tonight  
Were gonna be like gangsters tonight  
We dont give a damn if its wrong or right  
Lighten up we wont have no regrets  
  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Lose your selfcontrol we can go wild  
Show you what it means to feel alive  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
  
We dont have to speak that much  
I hear you when I feel your touch  
Whisper in my ears make me blush  
Feel the chill as we kiss dont forget  
  
All you had as dreams dont hold back  
All the fantasies you ever had  
Just do what you like go ahead  
Close your eyes make a wish no regrets  
  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
  
Lose your selfcontrol we can go wild  
Show you what it means to feel alive  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
  
Surrender to the pleasure wanting  
When we breath in together waiting  
Its either now or never for you  
This feeling will take over  
  
No sex tapes no camera wanting  
Just you and me together waiting  
Repeat it like a mantra for you  
Im in love Im in love  
  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
  
Lose your selfcontrol we can go wild  
Show you what it means to feel alive  
Ill make this the best night of your life  
Ill make this the best night of your life
