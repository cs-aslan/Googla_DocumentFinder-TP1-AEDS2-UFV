I dont mean to be so insolent  
But you know its cause I love you  
The foundation of my malevolence  
You know Id never hurt you babe  
  
Sometimes I might get edgy  
But a man can sometimes be that way  
And nobodys perfect baby  
And Ill always love you anyway  
  
Oh Gabrielle  
The sun is shinning in your eyes  
Oh Gabrielle  
I didnt mean to make you cry  
Oh my sweet baby doll  
I put you above everything  
Oh Gabrielle  
I love you til the day I die  
  
Sometimes I feel like my old man  
You know thats hard for me to say  
And sometimes I just lose my head  
Dont know why I get that way  
I want to keep you happy darling  
It could only work out that way  
Nobodys perfect baby  
And Ill always love you anyway  
  
Oh Gabrielle  
The sun is shinning in your eyes  
Oh Gabrielle  
I didnt mean to make you cry  
Oh my sweet baby doll  
I put you above everything  
Oh Gabrielle  
I love you til the day I die  
  
Gabrielle

But you know I got to love you anyway  
Oh Gabrielle youre so nice  
You know I I love you baby  
Oh my my my my my my my

The sun is shinning in your eyes  
Oh Gabrielle
