Im writing you this song  
Cause Ive always wanted to let you know  
That no matter where you go  
My love is with you  
Long after the curtain falls  
Its you I hear  
Breaking down the walls  
To let me know youre there  
So sincerely  
Youve stood beside me  
All through the years  
Together we have grown  
My friends unknown  
Down on your knees you pray for me  
Deep in my heart youll stay  
Eternally  
You can turn my gray skies blue  
Theres just no me without you  
For all the love youve shown  
My friends unknown  
This road may be long and winding  
But no matter where it takes me to  
I will always find my way  
Back to you  
And you should know that no matter  
where you go  
Im always there for you  
I say a prayer for you  
And I love you  
Eternally  
And if we never never ever meet again  
Youll always know where I stand  
Ill never be alone  
My friends unknown  
For all the love youve shown  
I wanna thank you  
My friends unknown
