We had an apartment in the city  
Me and Loretta liked living there  
Well itd been years since the kids had grown  
A life of their own left us alone  
John and Linda live in Omaha  
And Joe is somewhere on the road  
We lost Davy in the Korean war  
And I still dont know what for dont matter anymore  
  
Chorus  
Ya know that old trees just grow stronger  
And old rivers grow wilder evry day  
Old people just grow lonesome  
Waiting for someone to say Hello in there hello  
  
Me and Loretta we dont talk much more  
She sits and stares through the back door screen  
And all the news just repeats itself  
Like some forgotten dream that weve both seen  
Someday Ill go and call up Rudy  
We worked together at the factory  
But what could I say if asks Whats new  
Nothing whats with you Nothing much to do  
  
Chorus  
  
So if youre walking down the street sometime  
And spot some hollow ancient eyes  
Please dont just pass em by and stare  
As if you didnt care say Hello in there hello
