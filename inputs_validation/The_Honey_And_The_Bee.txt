Dont remind me  
That some days Im the windshield  
And other days Im just a lucky bug  
These cold iron rails  
Leave old mossy trails  
Through the countryside  
The crow and the beanfield  
Are my best friends but boy I need a hug  
  
Boy I need a hug  
  
Cause my heart stops without you  
Theres something about you  
That makes me feel alive  
  
If the green left the grass on the other side  
I would make like a tree and leave  
But if I reached for your hand would your eyes get wide  
Who knew the other side could be so green  
  
Dont remind me  
Im a chickadee in love with the sky  
But thats clearly not a lot to crow about  
Cause when the stars silhouette me  
Im scared theyll forget me and flicker out  
I taste honey but I havent seen the hive  
Yeah I didnt look I didnt even try  
  
But still my heart stops without you  
Cause theres something about you  
That makes me feel alive  
  
If the green left the grass on the other side  
I would make like a tree and leave  
But if I reached for your hand would your eyes get wide  
Who knew the other side could be so green  
  
We are honey and the bee  
  
Backyard of butterflies surrounded me  
I fell in love with you like bees to honey  
Lets up and leave the weeping to the willow tree  
And pour our tears in the sea  
  
I swear  
Theres a lot of vegetables out there  
That crop up for air  
Yeah I never thought  
We were two peas in a pod  
To be suddenly bloomed  
And I knew that Id always love you  
  
Oh Ill always love you too  
  
If the green left the grass on the other side  
I would make like a tree and leave  
But if I reached for your hand would your eyes get wide  
Who knew the other side could be so green  
  
If the green left the grass on the other side  
I would make like a tree and leave  
But if I reached for your hand would your eyes get wide  
Who knew the other side could be so green  
  
If I reached for your hand for the rest of my life  
Who knew the other side could be so green
