Do I look like a loser  
Do I stand in your way  
A threat to your future  
You planned yesterday  
Well I fought for my freedom  
Some called it a crime  
Convicted of running  
On rock and roll time  
  
Chorus  
I said rock and roll time  
Please take me away  
To the whiskey and wine  
Of some better day  
And if sometimes it seems  
Im falling behind  
Remember Im running  
On rock and roll time  
  
Im judged in your airports  
Each time that I fly  
Ive been locked in your jailhouse  
Oh but Im getting by  
Just hoping that heaven  
Is happy and high  
And everyones running  
On rock and roll time  
  
Chorus
