Straight from the hall of fame  
One of the worlds great lovers  
Darling youre not to blame  
Im just sorry that youve been discovered  
When I look in you eyes  
I know hundreds of girls have been there  
I tried to be civilized  
And pretend I dont care  
  
Take me away burn out the past  
And hold me  
To calm my jealousy  
Hold me  
Forget your history  
I need you to show me  
Well be like Adam and Eve  
That you love me  
I wish you had never loved anyone but me  
  
Breathless and overcome  
Knowin my desire is showing  
Passion can make you dumb  
But does so much to keep you going  
Turn off the songs of the past romance and  
  
Hold me  
To calm my jealousy  
Hold me  
Forget your history  
I need you to show me  
Well be like Adam and Eve  
that you love me  
I wish you had never loved anyone but me  
  
With too many options  
You spin like a top  
you spin like a top  until you drop  
But now that youve dropped Im gonna pick you up  
And love you until we just cant stop  
And love you until we just cant stop
