All my friends packing up  
Loading up their Volvos  
And their pick up trucks  
Going down the road  
To try their luck  
So spin that dream  
Go heading for the city  
Roll that dice  
Say a prayer  
Light a candle for me  
When you get there  
Win or lose  
Were heading for the city  
  
Well I got a problem hear what I say  
Theyre telling me I got to move away  
I was happy here  
They tell me I cant stay  
Now whats screaming rain is heading this way  
For those who sleep and choose to stay  
The game they didnt know  
They had to play  
So win or lose  
Were heading for the city  
So roll that dice  
Say a prayer  
Light a candle for me  
When you get there  
Win or lose  
Were heading for the city
