Well you are  
Such an easy evil  
Youre such a sensuous sin  
Sometimes I dont know where Im goin  
Til I been taken in  
  
Youre such an easy evil  
Such a promise of fun  
Sometimes I dont know what Im doin  
Til Im done youre a sneaky one  
  
Here he comes now touchin me  
Callin my name  
Again  
Here I go now  
Like a moth to a flame  
Im a puppet for you baby  
  
Such an easy evil  
Youre such a sensuous sin  
Sometimes I dont know where Im goin  
Til I been taken in yeah  
  
Ooh ooh yeah ooh oh  
Here he comes now touchin me  
Callin my name  
Again  
Here I go now  
Like a moth to a flame  
Im a puppet for you baby  
  
Such an easy evil  
Youre such a sensuous sin  
Sometimes I dont know where Im goin  
Til I been taken in  
  
Well no no no no no no

Til I been taken in
