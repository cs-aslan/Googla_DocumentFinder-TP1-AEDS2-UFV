Hey I can see all your dreams  
Lying scattered in your fragile heart  
You think your worlds come apart  
But hey I believe theres gonna be  
  
A brighter day that shines for you my friend  
Its waiting around the bend  
Youve been dancing on the wire  
Walking through the fire  
  
Thinking youre all alone  
But youre not on your owe  
Theres a faithful hand to guide you  
God always be beside you  
  
All because he is love  
And love wont leave you now  
So fly on the wings of your dreams  
To the place he is taking you  
  
Youre gonna make it through  
And if you doubt Just think about  
All the promises that he has made  
You dont have to be afraid  
  
Through the smiles through the sorrow  
He was faithful yesterday and hell be faithful tomorrow
