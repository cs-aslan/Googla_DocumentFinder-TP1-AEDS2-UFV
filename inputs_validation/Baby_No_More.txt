Dont want to be your baby no more  
Dont want to be your baby no more  
Cause I work so hard to get this far  
Then one day I hear you say hey  
Dont want to be your baby no more  
  
You buy a nickel you drop a dime  
Too much of nothin every single time  
Its no surprise Ive heard it all before  
I dont want to be your baby no more  
  
Dont want to be your slave no more  
Ill be last dog at your door  
Cause I work so hard to get this far  
Dont want to be your baby no more no more no more  
  
Hidin in the corner shoot whats goin on  
Trouble down on Main Street cant get to a phone  
Problem after problem dont know whats the score  
I dont want to be your baby no more  
  
Dont want to be your baby no more  
Dont want to be your baby no more  
Dont want to be your baby no more  
Dont want to be your baby no more  
No more no more no more no more no more no more
