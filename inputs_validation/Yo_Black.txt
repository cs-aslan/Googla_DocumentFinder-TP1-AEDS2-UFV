Bobbitos in the house  
I gotta say one thing yall been great playin the real shit

All this lalala and this TLC condoms on your eyes and all that shit

Ima show you how to get wreck  
The right way not the wrong way

Check it out  
Shut up Step back That pickypackywacky rap  
Your old flow is over and your rhyme style is over with  
In fact big head yo take it as a bigger diss  
I come walk in your show like David Berkowitz  
Make you think you swimmin like that homey Mark Spitz  
How can you put up a fox against an ALLIGATOR  
I chew your crew one by one like a Now or Later  
I make a heavy man light turn a black kid white  
Bust a rhyme in they rectum squeeze it tight
