Longing is the animal inside you when you bleed  
Suffering is critical in finding what you need  
Deliverance is evidence theres more than what you say  
Pain is there the moment that you wake up from your dreams  
  
Oh I know you cant tithe  
Oh when you look inside yourself  
Youve got to cross that line  
Yeah youre running out of time  
  
Loneliness is beautiful it leads you home again  
Happiness is overrated joy is infinite  
Liberate the hate you feel before its permanent  
Smile when it hurts it works like mothers medicine  
  
Oh I know you cant tithe  
Oh when you look inside yourself  
Youve got to cross that line  
Yeah youre running out of time  
  
Youve got to learn your lesson  
To see what youve been missing  
Youve got to cross that line  
  
Yeah youve got to look inside  
Yeah its time that you decide  
Yeah youve got to cross that line  
Yeah youre running out of time
