What a life what a day Im in love all the way  
Im in good with lady luck ah hah baby Ive a been lovestruck  
Im in love ah hah Im in love oh yeah  
Well I feel like I was hit by a truck ah hah baby Ive a been lovestruck  
  
Well true love came just in time in time to save this heart of mine  
Cupid came and I forgot to duck ah hah baby Ive a been lovestruck  
Im in love ah hah Im in love oh yeah  
Well look at me grin and watch me strut ah hah baby Ive a been lovestruck  
  
Well Its a great life everythings OK

And Im glad that Ive been lovestruck
