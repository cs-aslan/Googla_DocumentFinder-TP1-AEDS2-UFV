Does she love me with all her heart  
Should I worry when were apart  
Its a lovers question Id like to know  
Does she need me as she pretends  
Is this a game well then will I win  
Its a lovers question Id like to know  
Id like to know when shes not with me  
If shes still true to me  
Id like to know when were kissing  
Does she feel just what I feel  
And how am I to know its really real  
Oh tell me where the answer lies  
Is it in her kiss or in her eyes  
Its a lovers question Id like to know  
Id like to know when shes not with me  
If shes still true to me  
Id like to know when were kissing  
Does she feel just what I feel  
And how am I to know its really real  
Oh tell me where the answer lies  
Is it in her kiss or in her eyes  
Its a lovers question Id like to know
