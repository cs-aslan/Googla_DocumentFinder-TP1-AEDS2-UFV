There are people who dont know me  
Who must think Ive got it made  
From all outward appearances  
I guess it looks that way  
Ive got good friends and family  
They let me know they care  
I got a job to keep me going  
And a car to get me there  
  
Im holding my own  
But Id rather be holding you  
I can make it alone  
But not like I made it with you  
Without you here  
This house just aint no home  
How long can I go on holding my own  
  
Theres brand new show thats playing  
At the movies down the street  
Ill probably go there after work  
Then stop somewhere to eat  
Ive got cable on my TV  
And Ill leave her on all night  
While I dose off to sleep  
And dream that Im alright  
  
Im holding my own  
But Id rather be holding you  
I can make it alone  
But not like I made it with you  
Without you here  
This house just aint no home  
How long can I go on holding my own  
  
How long can I go on holding my own
