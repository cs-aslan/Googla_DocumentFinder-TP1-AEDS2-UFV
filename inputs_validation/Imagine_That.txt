Close your eyes  
Now relax your mind  
Now I want you to picture yourself far far away  
Prepare yourself girl cause we bout to take a ride  
And I dont want you to have a care in the world right now  
Its just you and me  
In this moment quiet  
Listen  
  
Baby take your mind into a zone  
Imagine that we all alone  
Two ways are off and our friends are gone  
Now its just you and me getting it on  
Take my hand and come with me  
Lets indulge in fantasies  
Cast your cares and worries  
While we fall into this ecstasy  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna rub your body so baby just relax  
Youve been pouring out your loving so now its time to pour it back  
Imagine that  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that  
Me stroking your body  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that  
Whip cream and strawberries know what I mean  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that  
Candles and oils surrounding the bed  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that  
Me kissing your body from feet to head  
  
Imagine that  
We dont have to talk  
Lay your body here and watch my fingers walk  
Take a second and imagine the opportunity  
You and me sharing sexual energy  
Now girl just mediate on you being in this chair  
Then close your eyes and act like we not even here  
Girl  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah  
Baby  
Imagine  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that Baby imagine imagine that  
  
That Im stroking your body  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that  
Strawberries and whip cream imagine that  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that  
Oh baby candles and oil surrounding the bed  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that  
Imagine Im taking off my clothes baby  
Hey  
Do it baby  
Take off all your clothes baby  
Imagine that  
Hey  
Cause you owe me baby  
And I want you baby  
So let it take control  
Hey  
Baby let it take control  
Oh  
Imagine that Im kissing you  
From feet to head  
Its your and me in the bed  
Screaming baby  
Say my name say my name say my name say my name say my name  
Oh
