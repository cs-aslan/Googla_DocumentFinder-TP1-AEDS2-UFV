I believe that theres something deep inside  
That shouldnt be from time to time  
I sure found out for love was such a crime  
The more you care the more you fall  
  
No need to worry no need to turn away  
Cause it dont matter anyway baby  
  
Chorus  
Oooh I miss you in a heartbeat  
Oooh I miss you right away  
Oooh I miss you in a heartbeat  
It aint love if it dont feel that way  
Oh no  
  
When we touch I just lose my self control  
A sad sensation I cant hide  
To love is easy it aint easy to walk away  
I keep the faith and theres a reason why  
Yeah  
  
No need to worry no need to turn away  
Cause it dont matter anyway baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Now I aint big on promises Ill be true to you  
Ill do bout anything yeah  
For some one like baby for you  
  
Oooh  
I miss you in a heartbeat  
Oooh  
Yeah Id miss you right away  
Oooh  
Oh miss you in a heartbeat  
I miss you in a heartbeat  
Cause it aint love if it dont feel that way
