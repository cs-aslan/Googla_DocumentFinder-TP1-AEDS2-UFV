Yesterday as I talked with a friend in town  
I forgot to remember that youd gone  
For a moment I found myself smiling  
But a moment isnt very long  
  
An last night as I danced with a stranger  
An she held her cheek close to my own  
For a moment I almost forgot you  
But a moment isnt very long  
  
Every now an then I get a chance to smile  
But those every now an thens just last a little while  
An tonight Ive got a date with a new love  
But I know Id do just as well at home  
For a moment maybe I could forget you  
But a moment isnt very long
