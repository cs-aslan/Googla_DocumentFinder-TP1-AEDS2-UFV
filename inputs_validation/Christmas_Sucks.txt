One year I got a dog for Christmas  
And I gave it to the boy next door  
Then I gave him my bike and my moms bank card  
cause thats what Christmas is for  
I used to give a lot at Christmas  
You might say I gave to much  
Until my family was broke and we had no place to live  
Thats why Christmas Sucks  
I went down to the mall each Christmas  
Had to the Santa what to bring  
A train a bike a pony and a great big pile of cash  
And please dont get my sister anything  
But the shopping mall Santa has been drinking  
His nose is red from years of drinking scotch  
He probably wont remember whats on my Christmas list  
This Father Christmas sucks  
Chorus  
Christmas Sucks Christmas Sucks  
Getting stuff is much for fun you gotta look out for number one  
Christmas Sucks  
Christmas became worse as years went by  
It was the most dreaded time of year  
My parents got me clothes that just werent cool  
When all I want is money to buy beer  
There was a girl at church who I was sweet on  
So in the Christmas play I was the ox  
I really think she liked me til I stepped on Baby Jesus  
Even for our savious Christmas Sucks  
Chorus  
Now that I am thirtywight years old  
The only things I get are ties and socks  
My kids are never happy with whats under the tree  
Soon theyll understand Christmas Sucks  
Every freakin year Christmas Sucks  
Christmas Sucks Christmas Sucks Christmas Sucks
