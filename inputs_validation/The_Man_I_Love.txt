All thats real to me  
Is Marilyn and Jesus  
Jumping offa bridges  
Sparklers and streamers  
  
Honey I wanna fly  
I wanna fly I wanna fly  
  
All thats real to me  
Is Halloween and Jesus  
Coney Island beaches  
Chandeliers and seizures  
  
Honey I wanna fly  
I wanna fly I wanna fly  
  
I cant be with the man I love  
I cant be if he treats me rough  
I cant see him I cant call him up  
  
All thats real to me  
Is trailer parks and beaches  
Alabama freezes  
Platinum impeaches  
  
Honey I wanna fly  
I wanna fly I wanna fly  
  
All thats real to me  
Is Halloween and Jesus  
Coney Island beaches  
Chandeliers and seizures  
  
Honey I wanna fly  
I wanna fly I wanna fly  
  
I cant be with the man I love  
I cant be if he treats me rough  
I cant see him I cant call him up  
  
All thats real to me  
Is Marilyn and Jesus  
Jumping offa bridges  
Sparklers and streamers  
  
I cant be with the man I love  
I cant be if he treats me rough  
I cant see him I cant call him up
