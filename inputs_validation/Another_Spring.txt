Old people talk to themselves  
When they sit all round all day  
This old woman I knew  
I used to go over there and sit with her  
And shed be sitting around  
In a rocking chair talking to herself  
  
And she used to say she used to say  
Sometimes the cold gets in my bones so bad  
Till I just dont think I can go  
Yeah and for a little while well I dont care  
If my days are coming to an end  
And just as soon be gone sometimes  
  
Sometimes the night comes down on me  
And I know whats ahead  
An evening in this cold old house  
With no one to say goodnight to me when I go to bed  
An evening in this cold old house  
With no one to say goodnight to me when I go to bed  
  
Sometimes  
I wonder why I stay  
What am I waiting for  
My children are grown and gone away  
They got children of their own now  
Dont need me anymore  
  
In winter when the streets are bare  
There aint nothing much to see  
I just cant help missing and thinking  
About that kindly man  
That one old winter time came  
And took away from me  
  
And then one morning  
Another spring is there outside my door  
Things are blooming  
Birds are singing  
And suddenly yes well I aint sad  
Aint sad no more aint sad no more  
  
When its warm and the sun is out  
Its like my hearts restored  
Ive had my love Ive had my children  
And I have so many memories  
So dont mind me complaining  
What the years may bring  
  
Cos this old world has been fine with me really  
And Im thankful for seeing another spring  
Its gonna be better this time another spring  
Its gonna be groovier this time another spring  
Its whats happening this time  
So Im thankful for letting me see another spring
