Thats life thats lifethats what all the people say  
Youre ridin high in April shot down in May  
But I know Im gonna change that tune  
When Im back on top back on top in June  
  
I said thats life thats life and as funny as it may seem  
Some people get their kicks stompin on a dream  
But I dont let it let it get me down  
Cause this fine old world it keeps spinnin around  
  
Ive been a puppet a pauper a pirate a poet a pawn and a king  
Ive been up and down and over and out and I know one thing  
Each time I find myself flat on my face  
I pick myself up and get back in the race  
  
Thats life thats lifeI tell you I cant deny it  
I thought of quitting baby but my heart just aint gonna buy it  
And if I didnt think it was worth one single try  
Id jump right on a big bird and then Id fly  
  
Ive been a puppet a pauper a pirate a poet a pawn and a king  
Ive been up and down and over and out and I know one thing  
Each time I find myself layin flat on my face  
I just pick myself up and get back in the race  
  
Thats life thats life thats life and I cant deny it  
Many times I thought of cuttin out but my heart wont buy it  
But if theres nothin shakin come this here July  
Im gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die  
  
My my
