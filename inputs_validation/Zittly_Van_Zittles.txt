Well I had myself a girlfriend  
For almost two whole years  
We had no secrets  
We had no fears  
There was nothing we wouldnt do  
When we were in the sack  
Shed even pop the zit on my back  
  
But one night I was out cheating  
After I drank a few  
She caught me red handed  
And said were through  
Now shes got a new boyfriend  
It nearly gave me a heart attack  
  
Cause whos gonna pop this zit on my back  
Well I got a pimple and I dont know why  
It keeps growing in the same place  
I cant reach it with my left or right hand  
I wish it was on my face  
Its four days old  
And it hurts so bad  
But its ready for a squeeze  
Wont somebody pop it for me please  
Ill give you ten dollars  
  
If youre a girl in this lonely world  
And youre looking for a guy  
Ill never cheat again I promise  
Thats no lie  
Theres only one thing I ask of you  
Could we name our first child Zak  
Oh one more thing  
Please pop this zit on my back  
  
Im dying here  
A pimple ayhee  
A popadoodlydoo  
Squirt heedlyhoo  
  
Well Im sitting alone by the phone  
And no one seems to call  
I try to scrape my zit off on the kitchen wall  
Well that dont work so I look around  
And find a big shiny thumbtack  
Put it on the floor lay down  
Pop the zit on my back
