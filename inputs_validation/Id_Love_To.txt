Again  
I lay awake  
And I cried because of waste  
  
Id love to  
But only with you  
Only with you  
  
Oh time is gonna wipe us out  
There Ive said it loud and clear  
So that you will hear  
Theres no one in view  
Just you  
Just you  
And time will never wipe you out  
  
Now Ive had enough  
Ive had more than could be  
My rightful share  
Of nights I cant bear  
How can it be fair   
Time must wipe them out  
  
So again I lay awake  
In a trance  
Oh I just want my chance  
But only with you  
Only with you  
Thats all  
Thats all  
Aah
