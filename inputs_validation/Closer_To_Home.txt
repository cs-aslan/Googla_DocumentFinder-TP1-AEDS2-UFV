Everybody listen to me  
And return me my ship  
Im your captain  
Im your captain  
Though Im feeling mighty sick  
  
Ive been lost now for days uncounted  
And its months since Ive seen home  
Can you hear me Can you hear me  
Or am I all alone  
  
If you return me to my home port  
I will kiss you Mother Earth  
Take me back now  
Take me back now  
To the port of my birth  
  
Am I in my cabin dreaming  
Or are you really scheming  
To take my ship away from me  
Youd better think about it  
I just cant live without it  
So please dont take my ship from me  
  
I can feel the hand of a stranger  
And its tightening around my throat  
Heaven help me  
Heaven help me  
Take this stranger from my boat  
Im your captain  
Im your captain  
Though Im feeling mighty sick  
Everybody listen to me  
And return me my ship  
Im your captain  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Im your captain  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Im your captain  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Im your captain  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Im getting closer to my home  
Im getting closer to my home  
Im getting closer to my home
