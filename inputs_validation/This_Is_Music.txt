I stand accused just like you  
For being born without a silver spoon  
Stood at the top of a hill  
Over my town I was found  
Ive been on the shelf too long  
Sitting at home in my bed too long  
Got my things and now Im gone  
Hows the world gonna from take me  
Finding myself used to be hard  
But now I see the light  
If love is a drug  
Then I dont need it  
Ive been on the shelf too long  
Sitting at home in my bed too long  
Now its time to hear my song  
How are you gonna take it  
Ive been on the shelf too long  
Think the words without the song  
Never had a way to go  
Tell me now Im taking it  
Ive been on the shelf too long  
Ive been on the shelf too long  
Ive been on the shelf too long  
Weve got a lot of living to do  
Theres a door in my mind thats open wide  
Come inside come inside  
Jesus never saved me  
Hell never save you too and you know  
Ive got a little sticker on the back of my boot  
This is music  
And now I see the light shining bright in my eyes  
If love is the drug then it aint for me  
Well music is my life  
And loved by me  
Im gonna move on the floor with my sweet young thing  
Down down down we go till we reach the bottom  
Of our soul with this is music
