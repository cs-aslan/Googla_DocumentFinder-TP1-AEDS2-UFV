In the daylight comes darkness on the verge of  
Night a fear is born  
Sweeter than the dream the reality of you  
Immaculate deception  
  
From the spirit runs poison and the wheel of  
Fortune is ever still  
Sweeter than the light the darkness of your soul  
Immaculate deception  
  
Something has touched the spirit inside  
Once there was love now theres a void  
Nights of deception ghosts in my mind  
Am I bewitched slave to desire  
  
Its knowing that times keeps rolling on night after  
Day day after night  
Its knowing that feeling of coming home to where  
My spirit lies  
  
Its knowing that feeling of coming home to where  
My spirit lies
