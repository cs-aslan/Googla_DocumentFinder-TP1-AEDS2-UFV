She wakes and takes her place in line  
And never bothers to ask why the mirror sheds no light at all  
The days turn into lesser days until theres only night  
The light it wouldnt help shes too far gone  
  
Her time is up its five oclock  
It never stops  
  
And she says please and she says please  
And she says please watch over me  
  
I watch her slowly make her way  
Down on a road she shouldnt take  
She always ends where she began  
  
The years go by theyre adding up  
She clicks her heels but shes still stuck  
Shes giving in but wont give up shell never stop  
  
And she says please and she says please  
And she says please watch over me  
And she says please and she is  
On her knees and she begs and she pleads  
  
Na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na  
  
She counts the time til her heart breaks  
Just waiting for her next mistake  
  
And I said please and she says please  
And she says please watch over me  
  
On her knees and she begs and she pleads she says  
Please and she says please and she says please watch over me  
  
She counts the time til her heart breaks  
Just waiting for her next mistake  
Dont give up I know youve stopped believing  
And youre down and youre begging youre pleading  
Dont give up cause youre not too far gone
