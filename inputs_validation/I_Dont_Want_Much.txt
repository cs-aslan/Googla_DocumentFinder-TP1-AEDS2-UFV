Mose Allison  
  
I dont want much in this world  
Its th simple things I treasure  
Till I die I would get by on fame riches and sensual pleasure  
  
I dont ask much in this life  
No special consideration  
Just treat me like His Majesty  
Of a friendly OPEC nation  
  
Some people  
Just dont know when to stop  
Some people  
Just wont quit until they reach the top  
  
But Im so easy going  
Id make my way through life  
On love and understanding  
From a rich and beautiful life  
  
Some people  
Just never seem to get enough  
Some people  
Want salvation paradise and all that stuff  
  
But Im so easy going  
Dont even keep the score  
All I want is plenty but I will take more  
If you ask me  
I will take more  
Say please  
I will  
Take more
