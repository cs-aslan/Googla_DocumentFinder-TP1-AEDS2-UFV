Someone tell me that Im wrong  
Someone tell me that Im right  
Someone tell me where Im going  
  
I guess its safe to say  
I dont know what I want  
But I cant wait forever  
It isnt difficult at all  
I dont know what I want  
But I cant wait forever  
It isnt difficult at all  
  
It makes no sense to me  
  
Someone tell me that its black  
Someone tell me that its white  
Someone tell me that its going to make a difference  
  
I dont know what I want  
But I cant wait forever  
It isnt difficult at all  
It makes no sense to me
