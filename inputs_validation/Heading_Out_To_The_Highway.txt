Hit em boys  
Well Ive said it before and Ill say it again  
You get nothing for nothing expect it when  
Youre backseat driving and your hands aint on the wheel  
Its easy to go along with the crowd  
And find later on that your say aint allowed  
Oh thats the way to find what youve been missing  
So Im heading out to the highway  
I got nothing to lose at all  
Im gonna do it my way  
Take a chance before I fall  
A chance before I fall  
You can hang in a left or hang in a right  
The choice it is yours to do as you might  
The road is open wide to place your bidding  
Now wherever you turn wherever you go  
If you get it wrong at least you can know  
Theres miles and miles to put it back together  
And Im heading out to the highway  
I got nothing to lose at all  
Im gonna do it my way  
Take a chance before I fall  
A chance before I fall  
On the highway  
On the highway  
Making a curve or taking the strain  
On the decline or out on the wain  
Oh everybody breaks down sooner or later  
Well put it to rights well square up and mend  
Back on your feet to take the next bend  
You weather every storm thats coming atcha  
And Im heading out to the highway  
I got nothin to lose at all  
Im gonna do it my way  
Take a chance before I fall  
Yes Im heading out to the highway  
I got nothing to lose at allI got nothing to lose at all
