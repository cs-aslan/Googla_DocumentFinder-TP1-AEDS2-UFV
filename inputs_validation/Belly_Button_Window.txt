Well Im up here in this womb  
Im lookin all around  
Hmm mm mm  
Well Im lookin out my belly button window  
And I see a whole lot of frowns  
And Im wonderin if they dont want me around  
  
What seems to be the fuss out there  
Just what seems to be the hang  
Cause you know if you dont want me this time around  
Yeah Ill be glad to go back to spirit land  
And even take a longer rest  
Before a comin down the shoot again  
Man I sure remember the last time baby  
They were still talkin about me then  
So if you dont want me now  
Make up your mind  
Where or when  
Make up your mind  
If you dont want me now  
Give or take  
You only got twohundred days  
Cause I aint comin down this way too much more again  
  
You know they got pills for ills and thrills and even spills  
But I think your just a little too late  
So Im comin down into this world daddy  
Regardless of love and hate  
Im gonna sit up in your bed mamma  
And just a grin right in your face  
And then Im gonna eat up all your chocolates  
Ha and say I hope Im not too late  
  
If theres any questions make up your mind  
Give or take  
If theres any questions make up your mind  
Give or take  
You got only twohundred days  
  
And Im lookin out my belly button window  
And I swear I see nothing but a lot of frowns  
And I wont live if they dont want me around
