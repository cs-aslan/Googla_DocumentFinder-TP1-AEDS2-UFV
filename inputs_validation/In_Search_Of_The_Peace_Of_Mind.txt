When Im alone Im feeling blue  
Dreaming a dream of a world thats lovely and true  
  
Faintly the dream of a true and wonderful world  
And no one will care as long as the world will turn  
  
Faintly the dream of a true and wonderful world  
And no one will care as long as the world will turn  
  
And I know a place to find my peace of mind  
And I know a place to find my peace of mind  
  
And I try  
And I try  
And I try  
And I try
