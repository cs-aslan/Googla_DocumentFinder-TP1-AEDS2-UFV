Some people laugh in the dark  
Some people cry alone  
Some people talk without sayin a thing  
And everything turns out gloomy  
  
Some people count your money  
Someone is countin your days  
And somebody got to keep track of your mind  
  
When everything turns out gloomy  
  
Brothersll make you look sideways  
Fathersll make you look back  
And when youre done talking you still got to shoot  
Cause everything turns out gloomy  
  
Oh oh
