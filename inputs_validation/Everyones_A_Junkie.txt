Im not waiting for the answers  
On a Sunday afternoon  
Im just too drunk to remember  
Why I always slip through  
  
The drugs and fake ambition  
Have been helping me to hide  
But its the endless television  
That has kept me inside  
  
Where does it stop  
Where does it end  
Where do we go  
Why am I always complaining  
  
I can be good  
I can be bad  
I can be loved  
  
But everythings gone black  
Youre looking for that sun  
Youre looking for that light  
Lonely youre not the only one to feel this way  
  
Black youre looking for that sun  
Youre looking for that light  
Lonely youre not the only one to feel this way  
  
Big green monkey everyones a junkie  
  
Im not asking for forgiveness  
For the things that I dont know  
But Im really not that different  
You just made me think so  
  
Where does it stop  
Where does it end  
Where do we go  
Why am I always complaining  
  
I can be good  
I can be bad  
I can be loved  
  
But everythings gone black  
Youre looking for that sun  
Youre looking for that light  
Lonely youre not the only one to feel this way  
  
Black youre looking for that sun  
Youre looking for that light  
Lonely youre not the only one to feel this way  
  
Big green monkey everyones a junkie  
  
Big green monkey everyones a junkie  
Big green monkey everyones a junkie  
Big green monkey everyones a junkie  
Big green monkey everyones a junkie  
Youre the big green monkey everyones a junkie  
  
Black  
Youre looking for that sun  
Youre looking for that light  
Lonely youre not the only one to feel this way  
  
Black youre looking for that sun  
Youre looking for that light  
Lonely youre not the only one to feel this way  
And Ill remember this someday  
  
Black youre looking for that sun  
Youre looking for that light  
Lonely youre not the only one to feel this way  
  
Black youre looking for that sun  
Youre looking for that light  
Lonely youre not the only one to feel this way  
  
Big green monkey everyones a junkie
