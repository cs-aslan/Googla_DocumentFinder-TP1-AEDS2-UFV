Niggaz are in a state of emergency  
The death side mirror damage of where we are today  
The life side a vision of where we need to go  
So sign your death certificate  
Fuck all yall  
Lisa got him  
Alright on three one two three  
Get all folks together walk this way  
Cant believe it though  
The homeboy hey open that door  
Open it alright right  
Weve come together by Gods demand  
Whether it be for life or death  
Well this morning its over the mourning  
Of one of our little brothers  
This brother was a good brother  
He didnt get into an excessive amount of trouble  
But its one thing its one thing its one thing  
He was the wrong nigga to fuck with
