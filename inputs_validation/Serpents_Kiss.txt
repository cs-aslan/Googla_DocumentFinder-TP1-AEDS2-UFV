The Serpent to Adam and Eve  
If Heaven is higher and death is a dream  
Cast away virtue its not what it seems  
In whiteness descending the souls steals a star  
Creates a new Heaven in sin where you are  
The Serpent to Cain  
Sons of Cain agonize bring forth then die  
Your children will multiply tear Heaven down  
With a Serpents kiss with a Serpents kiss  
The Serpent to Eve in turn Eve to Adam  
Black superstition denied by your sire  
The golden elixir Promethean fire  
Quick is unguarded delight in its taste  
Indulge in your passion be quick make haste  
The Serpent to Mankind  
Sons of pain agonize bring forth then die  
Your sorrows will multiply and you shall share my fall  
Voice of Adam  
Eve we were mistaken to listen to his words  
Black heart and false fatal guile  
Now judgement is swift his wrath is profound  
Eden is lost to us now  
Driven to wander in sorrow and shame  
Immortal no longer we blame you  
The Serpents reply  
Bastards forsaken cast from his grace  
Bask in the light of my fall  
Now suffer and weep my hatred runs deep  
The jaws of regret smite you all  
From out of the mire the filth and the fire  
My legions my furies unbound  
Im no longer waiting my eyes are not blind  
My arrows streaming carve a path through the light  
Voice of God  
Now you listen now you learn of fathomless night  
Cast down in wrath cast down in flame olympian might  
Chained to Earth my kongdom comes first  
Down with you into the fire  
The Serpents reply  
Wailing screaming roaring loud my reign begins  
Tis better to rule than merely to serve  
My hate will bring down Elysian stones Taste the Serpents Kiss  
The Serpents Kiss  
The Serpents to himself  
If Heaven is higher and death is a dream  
Cast away virtue its not what it seems  
In whiteness descending the soul steals a star  
Creates a new Heaven in sin where you are  
The Serpent to Cain  
Sons of Cain agonize bring forth then die  
Scale the walls of heaven now and bring God to his knees  
With a Serpents kiss Serpents kiss Serpents kiss  
God shall share my fall
