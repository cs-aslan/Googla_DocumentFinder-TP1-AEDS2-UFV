Delia oh Delia  
Delia all my life  
If I hadnt shot poor Delia  
Id have had her for my wife  
Delias gone one more round  
Delias gone  
  
I went up to Memphis  
And I met Delia there  
Found her in her parlor  
And I tied to her chair  
Delias gone one more round  
Delias gone  
  
She was low and trifling  
And she was cold and mean  
Kind of evil make me want to  
Grab my sub machine  
Delias gone one more round  
Delias gone  
  
First time I shot her  
I shot her in the side  
Hard to watch her suffer  
But with the second shot she died  
Delias gone one more round  
Delias gone  
  
But jailer oh jailer  
Jailer I cant sleep  
Cause all around my bedside  
I hear the patter of Delias feet  
Delias gone one more round  
Delias gone  
  
So if your womans devilish  
You can let her run  
Or you can bring her down and do her  
Like Delia got done  
Delias gone one more round  
Delias gone
