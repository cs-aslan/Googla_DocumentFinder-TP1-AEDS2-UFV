Its a heartache  
Nothing but a heartache  
Hits you when its too late  
Hits you when youre down  
  
Its a fools game  
Nothing but a fools game  
Standing in the cold rain  
Feeling like a clown  
  
Its a heartache  
Nothing but a heartache  
Love him till your arms break  
Then he lets you down  
  
It aint right with love to share  
When you find he doesnt care for you  
It aint wise to need someone  
As much as I depended on you  
  
Its a heartache  
Nothing but a heartache  
Hits you when its too late  
Hits you when youre down  
  
Its a fools game  
Nothing but a fools game  
Standing in the cold rain  
Feeling like a clown  
  
It aint right with love to share  
When you find he doesnt care for you  
It aint wise to need someone  
As much as I depended on you  
  
Oh its a heartache  
Nothing but a heartache  
Love him till your arms break  
Then he lets you down  
  
Its a fools game  
Standing in the cold rain  
Feeling like a clown  
Its a heartache  
Love him till your arms break  
Then he lets you down  
Its a fools game  
Standing in the cold rain
