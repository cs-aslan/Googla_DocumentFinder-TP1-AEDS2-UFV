Now the partys over  
And the moneys all gone  
You remember feeling like  
Jesus son  
Your girl has left your side  
And now youre gonna get crucified  
  
Theyre gonna crucify you  
Crucify you  
Crucify you  
Crucify you  
In those old cotton fields back home  
  
Too late to joke or crack a smile  
You gotta carry  
That shit up that drunken mile  
When they put the electrodes  
In your brain  
Even your Mother wont know youre sane  
First Lord Nelsons sunken ships  
Now Steve Lillywhites drunken mix
