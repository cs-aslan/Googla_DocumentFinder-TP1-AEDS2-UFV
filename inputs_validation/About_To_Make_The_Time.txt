Well youre walking on the moon  
But theres nothing  
No theres nothing left to do deep inside  
And you cant believe its real  
Got ya thinking boy  
You may be better off to stay than to slide  
Lucky boy  
But now shes falling close to you  
And there are things that just cannot last forever  
And there is nothing I can say that is possibly kind  
But Im about to make the time  
Cause Im about to lose my mind  
And you think youre on the move  
But theres nothing  
No theres nothing left to breathe deep inside  
And you say its in the wheels  
God its stinkin boy  
Well you know that all you said was a lie  
Lucky boy  
But now shes falling close to you  
And there are things that just cannot last forever  
And there is nothing I can say that is possibly kind  
But Im about to make the time  
Cause Im about to lose my mind  
And Im about to make the time  
Cause Im about to lose my mind  
Yes Im about to make the time  
Oohhhh  
I do it  
Were gonna do it  
Gotta stop and take it slow  
You blew it  
Theyre gonna screw it  
Gotta stop and steal the show  
You count the ways  
You stop it  
And you say youre on the move  
But theres nothing  
No theres nothing left to do deep inside  
And you cant believe its real  
Got ya thinkin boy  
Maybe better off to stay than to die  
Thinkin boy  
But now shes falling close to you  
And there are things that just cannot last forever  
And there is nothing I can say that is possibly kind  
But Im about to make the time  
Cause Im about to lose my mind  
And Im about to make the time  
Cause Im about to lose my mind  
But Im about to make the time  
Oohhhh
