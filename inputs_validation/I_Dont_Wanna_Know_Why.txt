I dont wanna know why  
  
I took your love as desperate measure  
Seeking shelter from another lonely night  
You took my love seeking only pleasure  
But the feeling passes and the passion doesnt last  
  
And I dont wanna know why I dont want no reasons  
I just feel the seasons as they touch another year  
And I dont wanna know why I dont want no reasons  
I just know what is now and what could never be  
  
Will the memories fade or will they linger  
Will we live forever for a moment we can keep  
Now we stand alone  
why dont you do what you told me  
Where we stood together  
I only wanted you to hold me  
How did we ever let this dream slip through our hand  
how did we ever let this dream slip through our hand  
  
And I dont wanna know
