Aint she got fun  
Shes the luckiest one  
  
Satin on my shoulder and a smile on my lips  
How lucky can you get  
Money in my pocket right at my fingertips  
How lucky can you get  
Every night a party where the fun never ends  
You can circle the globe with my circle of friends  
Someone I am crazy for is crazy for me  
Im his personal pet  
Wow how lucky can you get  
See her diamonds are gleam her life is a dream  
Wrap it up and charge it thats my is my favorite phrase  
How lucky can you get  
When I see the chauffeur think Ill give him a raise  
How lucky can you get  
Weekends in the country with the baron of course  
And a wardrobe to shock Mrs Asters pet horse  
Making merry music with the one that I love  
Were a perfect duet  
Gee how lucky can you  
Wee how lucky can you  
Wow how lucky can you get

Shes the luck the luck the luck the luck the luck  
The luck the luck the luck the luck the luck

Money in my pocket how lucky can you get  
Every nights a party where the fun never ends  
You can circle the globe with my circle of friends  
Someone I am crazy for is crazy for me

Wow how lucky can you get  
He there gorgeous

Fantastic  
Satin on my shoulder and a smile on my lips  
Money in my pocket right at my fingertips  
Wrap it up and charge it thats my favorite phrase  
How lucky  
When I see the chauffeur think Ill give him a raise  
How lucky  
Lifes a bed of roses whirling perfume on me  
You can spare me the blues I dont sing in that key  
And if theres a man whod leave me I am happy to say  
I havent run into him yet  
  
Gee wee wow  
How lucky how lucky can you get
