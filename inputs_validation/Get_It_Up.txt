A little thing you sure will know  
Why you came here tonight  
And not to those other places  
I could imagine theres PCs and DVDs  
And TV shows  
And sex in cars what else you like  
Now right here is the place I got to be  
Tomorrow Ill be far away  
If you got time and nothing else to do now  
Together we can change the world  
  
Lets get it up  
Rocks here to stay  
With the best years of our lives we paid our share  
Yeah yeah  
Now tell me what is in our way  
To push this right in the face every day  
  
We spread it further on the town  
Now what dya know were good  
To incite a few more disciples  
No tie to waste makin haste were movin on  
Where well suspend another night  
  
Do I see grinning faces all round here  
And is this due to my words  
Come treat me nice whyknow I wasnt raised here  
But I mean everything I say  
  
Lets get it up  
Rocks here to stay  
With the best years of our lives  
We paid our share yeah yeah  
Now tell me what is in our way  
To push this right in the face everyday
