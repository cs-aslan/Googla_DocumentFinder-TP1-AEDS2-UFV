We fell in love  
On the first night that we met  
Together  
Weve been happy  
I have very few regrets  
The ordinary problems  
Have not been hard to face  
But lately little changes  
Have been slowly taking place  
Youre always finding something  
Is wrong in what I do  
But you cant rearrange my life  
Because it pleases you  
  
Youve got love me  
For what I am  
For simply being me  
Dont love me  
if what you intend  
Or hope that I will be  
And if youre only using me  
To feed your fantasy  
Youre really not in love  
So let me go  
I must be free  
  
If what you want  
Isnt natural for me  
I wont pretend to keep you  
What I am I have to be  
The picture of perfection  
Is only in your mind  
For all your expectations  
Love can never be designed  
We either take each other  
For evrything we are  
Or leave the life  
Weve made behind  
And make another start  
  
Youve got love me  
For what I am  
For simply being me  
Dont love me  
if what you intend  
Or hope that I will be  
And if youre only using me  
To feed your fantasy  
Youre really not in love  
So let me go  
I must be free  
  
And if youre only using me  
To feed your fantasy  
Youre really not in love  
So let me go  
I must be free  
  
Youre really not in love  
So let me go  
I must be free
