Im thinking of taking  
The easy way out  
Open the window  
Ill fall to the ground  
I could do it  wouldnt be much too it  
I gotta little place here in the city  
Its kind of small and dirty its a bedsitter  
And theres a lot of us living here  
Wall to wall in one big house  
And when the night comes round  
I can see a lot of lonely lights  
There are people in there breathing  
But it dont seem right  
In the streets way down below me  
Im listening for just a sound  
But nobody comes around  
In bedsitter land  
And theres a man below me on the balcony  
Crying to be heard  
Screaming to be heard  
Im haunted by his words  
And the people in the street just shrug their shoulders  
Saying hes disturbed  
Hes in another world  
Screaming at the birds  
Crying to be heard  
I hear his every word  
Ive slept in the gutter on a summers day  
Oh Ive bummed cigarettes in the night cafes  
Ive joined the breadline  
Believe I got a deadline  
I gotta little place here in the city  
Its kind of small and dirty its a bedsitter  
And theres a lot of us living here  
Wall to wall in one big house  
And when the night comes round  
I can see a lot of lonely lights  
There are people in there breathing  
But it dont seem right  
In the streets way down below me  
Im listening for just a sound  
But nobody comes around  
The lights are going down  
Nobody comes around  
In bedsitterland
