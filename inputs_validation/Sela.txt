You know sometimes I sit and wonder  
Just how this world would be  
If we had all the people laughing  
And everybody living in harmony  
Wed have to say sela sela  
Talking to the people sela sela  
  
There would be no more living in desperation  
And no more hatred and deceit  
Tell me can you imagine  
All the children playing  
And everyone dancing in the street  
We say sela sela  
Talking to yourself sela sela  
  
You play it for the people  
Yeah for the people  
Its time for everyone  
To come together  
I know its hard  
But this dream must come to light on  
Because tonight should be  
One big celebration  
Im talking to you now  
Only we can make things right  
  
We say sela sela sela sela baby  
Talk about sing about talk about sela  
Talk about sela  
Oh the children  
Tell me about the children  
Weve got to help them now to survive  
Well one world  
One heart is our salvation  
Let us keep the dream alive  
  
We say sela sela sela  
I know sela I know sela sela sela
