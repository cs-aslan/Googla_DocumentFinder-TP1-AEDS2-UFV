Empty spaces fill me up with hopes  
Distant faces with no place left to go  
Without you within me I cant find no rest  
Where Im going is anybodys guess  
  
Chorus  
I tried to go on like I never knew you  
Im awake but my world is half asleep  
I pray for this heart to be unbroken  
But without you all Im going to be is incomplete  
  
Voices tell me I should carry on  
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone  
Baby my baby its written on your face  
You still wonder if we made a big mistake  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont mean to drag it on  
But I cant seem to let you go  
I dont want to make you face this world alone  
I want to let you go  
  
Chorus  
  
Incomplete
