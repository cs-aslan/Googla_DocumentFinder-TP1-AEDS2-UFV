Now woman dont you feel sad when you see your life go round  
And you realise youve been drinking all of your years like wine  
Youre gambling with time and you know you just cant win  
But still you feel that somehow youve just got to keep on trying  
And woman its your heart I hear crying  
Now the young man by your side is your husband or so you say  
In reality hes a link with a past you just cant replace  
You tell the world youre happy when youre lying in his arms  
Oh but his youth has made you hate to see his face  
And woman its your heart I see crying  
Now youre standing like some tree oh and the blossom has blown away  
And the last leaf has gone crumbling tumbling towards the ground  
You have nothing to teach me just have nothing at all to say  
Except to keep on telling me about all the happiness that you do think you
have found
