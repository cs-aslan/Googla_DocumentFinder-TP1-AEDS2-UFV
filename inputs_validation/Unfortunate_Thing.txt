Breaking out of school  
Aint really fooling no one  
I was sure Id get my reward in time  
Backing on the street  
With the smell of sweet sensation  
Didnt want to be another dime  
Hidden in the pocket  
Of some unfortunate nation  
Didnt have no money sure didnt have the time  
  
Chorus  
Unfortunate thing such an unfortunate thing  
Unfortunate thing such an unfortunate thing  
But I fought with nothing  
But I fought with nothing  
  
Laughing at the rumor  
That youve been screwing someone  
Laugh better cry  
It could be your turn next time  
Brother what a lover beyond the fourth dimension  
Hes got an ego  
Thats bigger than yours and mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont call me Bwana  
Let it settle in your heart  
We move from children  
Into a business counterpart  
Your head was shaking as I walked into the room  
A spirit breaking  
Thats why I feel this way  
  
Breaking out of school  
Aint really fooling no one  
I was sure Id get my reward in time  
Backing up a street  
With a smell of sweet sensation  
Didnt want to be another dime  
  
Chorus  
  
Unfortunate thing
