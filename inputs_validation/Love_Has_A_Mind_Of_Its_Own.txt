Think about me and you  
Think of all the changes weve been through  
The laughter an the tears  
The years together  
Little did we both know  
When we fell we gave up all control  
Though times get hard  
Were strong enough to carry on  
Cause love has a mind of its own  
It moves in its own circles  
And it roams where it will roam  
Love has a mind of its own  
It holds our lives together  
Youre my heart and youre my home  
Stayed awake last night  
Told myself that this time we were through  
That passion wasnt pain  
My heart had changed  
But then in the morning light  
The feeling cut me like a knife  
And then I knew  
I couldnt walk away from you cause  
Love has a mind of its own  
It moves in its own circles  
And it roams where it will roam  
Love has a mind of its own  
It holds our lives together  
Youre my heart and youre my home  
Oh we can drive ourselves so far apart  
Till the world gets in between  
Before you know the distance grows  
Till never we lose sight of the dream  
But the wonder of it all  
Is our love will survive  
It never fails to keep us going  
It never fails to keep us alive  
Love has a mind of its own  
It moves in its own circles  
And it roams where it will roam  
Love has a mind of its own  
It holds our lives together  
Youre my heart and youre my home  
Love has a mind of its own  
It moves in its own circles  
And it roams where it will roam  
Love has a mind of its own  
It holds our lives together  
Youre my heart and youre my home
