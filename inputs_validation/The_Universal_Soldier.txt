Hes five foot two and hes six feet four  
He fights with missiles and with spears  
Hes all of thirtyone  
And hes only seventeen  
  
Hes been a soldier for a thousand years  
Hes a Catholic a Hindu an atheist a Jain  
A Buddhist and a Baptist and a Jew  
He knows he shouldnt kill  
  
But he knows he always will  
Kill you my friend for me and me for you  
Hes fighting for Canada hes fighting for France  
Hes fighting for the USA  
Hes fighting for the Russians  
  
And hes fighting for Japan  
And he thinks hell put an end to war that way  
Hes fighting for democracy hes fighting for the Reds  
He says its for the peace of all  
Hes the one who must decide  
  
Whos to live and whos to die  
But he never sees the writing on the wall  
But without him how would Hitler have condemned them at Dachau  
Without him Caesar would have stood alone  
Hes the one who gives his body  
  
As the weapon of the war  
And without him all this killing cant go on  
Hes the universal soldier and he really is to blame  
His orders come from far away no more  
  
They come from him and you and me  
And brother cant you see  
This is not the way to put an end to war
