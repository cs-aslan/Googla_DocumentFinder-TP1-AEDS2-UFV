I want to jump but Im afraid Ill fall  
I want to holler but the jones too small  
Young man really got the hold to it too  
I got the Rockin Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu  
  
Want some lovin baby that aint all  
I want to kiss her but the girls too tall  
Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the Rockin Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu  
  
I want to scream I want you all to know  
I would be runnin but my feets are too slow  
Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the Rockin Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu

Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the rockin pneumonia and Joe Perry too oh  
  
Want some lovin baby that aint all  
I want to kiss her but the girls too tall  
Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the Rockin Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu  
  
I want to scream I want to scream  
Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the Rockin Pneumonia whats the matter with you
