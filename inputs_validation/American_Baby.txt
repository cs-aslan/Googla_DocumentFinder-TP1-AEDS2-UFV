If these walls came crumbling down  
And fell so hard to make us lose our faith  
From whats left youd figure it out  
Still make lemonade taste like a sunny day  
Stay beautiful baby  
I hope you stay American baby  
American baby  
Nobodys laughing now  
Gods grace lost and the devil is proud  
But Ive been walking for a thousand miles  
One last time I could see you smile  
I I hold hold on to you  
You bring me hope Ill see you soon  
And if I dont see you  
Oh Im afraid weve lost the way  
Stay beautiful baby  
I hope you stay American baby  
American baby  
American baby  
I hold on to you  
You lift me up  
And always will  
I see you in light  
Hope I dont get left behind  
I I hold hold on to you  
You bring me hope Ill see you soon  
And if I dont see you  
Oh Im afraid weve lost the way  
Stay beautiful baby  
I hope you stay American baby  
I hope you stay beautiful baby  
I hope you stay American baby  
American baby  
American baby
