What you wanna do baby  
Where you wanna go  
Ill take you to the moon baby  
Ill take you to the floor  
Ill treat you like a real lady  
No matter where you go  
Just give me some time baby  
Cos you know  
Even when were apart I know my heart is still there with you  
Five more hours till the night is ours and Im in bed with you  
  
This right here is my type of party  
Five more hours were just getting started  
This right here is my type of party  
Five more hours were just getting started  
  
Five more hours were just getting started  
  
How you wanna feel baby What you wanna know  
Just pour another drink baby come on pour a little more  
Ill treat you like a real lady Ill keep you out the cold  
Ill give you all my time baby you know even when were apart  
I know my heart is still there with you  
Five more hours till the night is ours and Im in bed with you  
  
This right here is my type of party  
Five more hours were just getting started  
This right here is my type of party  
Five more hours were just getting started  
  
I follow the sound of your heartbeat  
How it always calls me finding my way back to you  
Im feeling it more now than ever  
Ill do this forever just to spend a night with you  
  
This right here is my type of party  
Five more hours were just getting started  
This right here is my type of party  
Five more hours were just getting started
