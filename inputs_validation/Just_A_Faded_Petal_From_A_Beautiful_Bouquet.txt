Darling I received your last long letter  
And enclosed I found a petal from the rose  
That I picked and placed within your hair  
Dear when we strolled beneath the moonbeams long ago  
  
You say that you can understand today dear  
Why in tears I told you when you went away  
Now youre leaving and Ill be so lonely  
Like a faded petal from a beautiful bouquet  
  
You tell me that tonight youre broken hearted  
Your happiness in life sweetheart you say is through  
And that you regret the day you left me  
And broken my heart to change an old love for the new  
  
With aching heart in tears I write this letter  
Old memries I could never never cast away  
I forgive you and youll find me waiting  
Like a faded petal from a beautiful bouquet
