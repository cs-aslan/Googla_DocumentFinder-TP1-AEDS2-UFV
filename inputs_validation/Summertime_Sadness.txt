Kiss me hard before you go  
Summertime sadness  
I just wanted you to know  
That baby you the best  
  
I got my red dress on tonight  
Dancin in the dark in the pale moonlight  
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style  
High heels off Im feelin alive  
  
Oh my God I feel it in the air  
Telephone wires above  
Are sizzlin like a snare  
Honey Im on fire I feel it everywhere  
Nothin scares me anymore  
1 2 3 4  
  
Kiss me hard before you go  
Summertime sadness  
I just wanted you to know  
That baby you the best  
  
I got that summertime summertime sadness  
Sususummertime summertime sadness  
Got that summertime summertime sadness  
  
Im feelin electric tonight  
Cruisin down the coast goin about 99  
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side  
I know if I go Ill die happy tonight  
  
Oh my God I feel it in the air  
Telephone wires above  
Are sizzlin like a snare  
Honey Im on fire I feel it everywhere  
Nothin scares me anymore  
1 2 3 4  
  
Kiss me hard before you go  
Summertime sadness  
I just wanted you to know  
That baby you the best  
  
I got that summertime summertime sadness  
Sususummertime summertime sadness  
Got that summertime summertime sadness  
  
Think Ill miss you forever  
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky  
Laters better than never  
Even if youre gone Im gonna drive  
  
I got that summertime summertime sadness  
Sususummertime summertime sadness  
Got that summertime summertime sadness  
  
Kiss me hard before you go  
Summertime sadness  
I just wanted you to know  
That baby you the best  
  
I got that summertime summertime sadness  
Sususummertime summertime sadness  
Got that summertime summertime sadness
