CHORUS  
Mama Africa  
How are you doing Mama  
Mama Africa  
Long time me no see you Mama  
They took me away from you Mama  
Long before I was born  
They took me away from you Mama  
Long before I came on in  
CHORUS  
Theres so many things about you  
Wondering where you are  
They try their best to hide you Mama  
But I search and I find you  
CHORUS  
In you theres so much beauty  
In you theres so much life  
In you theres so many kingdoms  
To me its out of sight  
CHORUS  
Youre the maker of gold Mama  
Youre the maker of diamond  
Youre the maker of pearls  
And the maker of all precious goals  
CHORUS  
Ive been waiting yearning looking  
Searching to find you  
Ive been crying praying hoping  
That I may find you Mama  
CHORUS  
Youre my mother Africa  
Youre my father Africa  
CHORUS Im proud of you Mama  
I love you Mama  
Im proud of you Mama  
I love you heavenly  
CHORUS
