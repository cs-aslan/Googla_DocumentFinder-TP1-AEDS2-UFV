Hello to you my sweet young friends  
Have you got money perhaps you could lend  
I wash my leather face in the afternoon sun  
My shirts turn my times near done  
  
Touching the untouchables but they dont know  
Respect the disrespectables but in the end you know  
You turn away what can I say  
  
Spend my nights in the telephone booth  
I make sure I leave the phone off the hook  
There are no Jones and I pay no rent  
I have to stand straight because my backs so bent  
Tell my secretary I aint takin any calls  
And if you want to find me just ask the boys  
Down at the wall thats where Ill be  
  
Oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Park bench and cigarettes  
Can you help me get off this fence  
Cant you see Im just an old man  
Tryin hard do what I can  
  
Touching the untouchables but they dont know  
Respect the disrespectables but in the end you know  
You turn away what can I say  
Youll never never know  
Youll never know
