Lived my life and walked it alone  
All my time and my heart was my own for so long  
I held the key to everything Id need  
Every dream so sure that Id succeed  
Cause I was strong so strong  
I swear that it was true till the day that I found you  
Come to me breakin me showin me no mercy  
What have ya done to me baby  
  
Chorus  
Look where you are here in my arms  
Filling my heart with your love  
But I cant get close enough to you  
Ive got no control  
You shake my soul when we touch  
Still I cant get close enough to you  
  
Time goes by and it grows stronger still  
With a smile I surrender my will Im on my knees  
Passions taken me so far across the line  
All power of reason is no longer mine  
Im just waitin to please  
What else can I do Im forever wantin you  
Time goes by and it grows stronger still  
With a smile I surrender my will Im on my knees  
Come to me breakin me showin me no mercy  
What have you done to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby youre the last thing that I had planned  
Got me livin in the palm of your hand  
The more I have of you the less I understand  
How ya give me so much  
And I just never get enough  
Cant get close enough baby  
  
Look where you are here in my arms  
Filling my heart with your love  
But I cant get close enough to you  
God only knows  
You shake my soul when we touch  
Still I cant get close enough to you  
  
Come to me breakin me showin me no mercy  
Filling my heart with your love  
Still I cant get close enough to you  
God only knows  
You shake my soul when we touch  
Cant get close enough to you  
Cant get close enough to you baby  
Here in my arms
