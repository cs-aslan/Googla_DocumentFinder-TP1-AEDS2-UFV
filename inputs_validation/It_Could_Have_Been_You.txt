We were so close yet so far away  
Id reach out youd be gone  
Moments that still talk my breath away  
Theres so much more to life than loving you  
You dont need me no  
  
Icant wait all my life on a street of broken dreams  
It could have been you my love where are you now  
Oh Istill wonder if you remember the night  
It could have been you  
  
Time washes over memories  
I cant look back no more  
Change has forsaken our promises  
Theres someone else for you to hold again  
So please stop your crying  
  
Icant wait all my life on a street of broken dreams  
It could have been you my love where are you now  
Oh Istill wonder if you remember the night  
It could have been you  
  
Remember remember girl I remember  
Icant wait all my life on a street of broken dreams  
It could have been you my love where are you now  
Oh Istill wonder if you remember the night  
It could have been you where are you now  
Should have been you my love where are you now  
It could have been you my love where are you now
