She started a blaze from one tiny spark  
I didnt even detect  
She loved the light was dismayed by the dark  
The stars though she seemed to respect  
  
The faint light that flutters at night to the  
earth  
Would land in her eyes and collect  
Luminous creatures shed find in the surf  
I never thought to inspect  
  
Pebbles and marbles like things on my mind  
Seem to get lost and harder to find  
When I am alone I am inclined  
If I find a pebble in sand  
To think that it fell from my hand  
  
She gave me ideas  
Planted the seed  
But she never stopped to reflect  
The course that shes on wherever it leads  
I never would redirect  
  
Pebbles and marbles like words from a friend  
Make us hold tight but are lost in the end  
When were alone we all seem to tend  
If we find a marble in dust  
To wish someone left it for us
