Verse 1  
Frank out on the street Working late again  
You know you see much better at night  
They call you Cats Eye Down on the corner they call you Mr Flash  
The godsome ladies who never see the light  
Chrous  
And theyll work you when the day is through  on the Night Shift  
And theyll comfort you and theyll love you too  on the Night Shift  
You wont ever want to see the sun when Im done with you  You wont ever
want to see the sun when Im done with you done with you  
Sax Solo  
Verse 2  
Hot shot out on the street Playing one on one  
You know you shoot much better at night  
You gotta Joker down on the corner and you can not be shamed  
You got some new tricks  you never show them the light  
Chorus
