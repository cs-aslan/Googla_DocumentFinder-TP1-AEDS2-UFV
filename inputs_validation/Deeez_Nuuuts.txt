Check game from the notorious Compton G  
Back with some shit that gots to bump  
As a pull up in the park you pops the trunk  
Just to floss you like a motherfucker clownin their shit  
Gots the Danas on your hootie and your fly ass bitch  
Throw off go off show off I take that hoe  
If she proper Ima pop her the hole hopper  
Its back on the track  
With big money big nuts and a big fat chronic sack  
So Daz step up on the ass  
And give these motherfuckers a blast from the past  
Diggidy Daz out of the cut with some shit that I wrote  
With my nigga DareE so you know I must be dope  
But uh rattattattat that ass  
Startin static with Dre make way for the AK  
That I bring as I slang like cavy  
Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy  
Had he not known about the city Im from  
Long Beach tic tac grab your gat watch your back  
Here I come stompin in my khaki suit  
BG from the hood can fuck Eastwood  
God damn I ripped up flipped up and skipped up  
On top of things as they swing towards my dingaling  
But did you raise up all this nuts  
Cause Dr Drizzays about to rizzip shit up
