Well it seems to me  
That Ive been cheated  
And it would appear  
That Ive been lied to  
All the promises  
That you repeated  
Were never destined  
To come true  
  
When I stop to think  
How I once trusted you  
Its harder still  
To bear this doubt  
Im a innocent victim of  
Heartbreaking circumstance  
And I still cant get it figured out  
  
cause all you did was cheat and lie  
Now youre gone and  
Made me cry  
When my heart is heavy and  
I just cant get it straight  
Just the way you made me feel  
A wound that only time can heal  
Wont you take a little time  
To show me my mistake  
  
cause all you did was cheat and lie  
Now youre gone and  
Made me cry  
When my heart is heavy and  
I just cant get it straight  
Just the way you made me feel  
A wound that only time can heal  
Wont you take a little time  
You know you gotta  
Show me my mistake
