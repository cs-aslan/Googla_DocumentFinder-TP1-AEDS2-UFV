Now you see me now you dont  
Dont ask me where Im at  
Cause Im a million miles away  
Treated like a forbidden heel  
Dont say my thoughts are not for real  
Or you wont see me again  
  
Am I here or am I there  
Or am I playing on the stairs  
Am I in my room with my toys  
I am the disappearing boy  
  
When I walk in crowded rooms  
I feel as if it is my doom  
I know that I dont belong  
In that room I see her  
I see her and shes with him  
I turn and then Im gone  
  
Dont call me up cause Im not home  
My whereabouts are now unknown  
I vanished from all your joy  
Im the disappearing boy  
  
I have my doubts  
Of where I belong  
Its something to think about  
  
Dont call me up cause Im not home  
My whereabouts are now unknown  
I vanished from all your joy  
Im the disappearing boy
