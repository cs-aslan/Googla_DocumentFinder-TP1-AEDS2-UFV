Well Im tore down  
Im almost level with the ground  
Well Im tore down  
Im almost level with the ground  
Well I feel like this  
When my baby cant be found  
  
Well I went to the river  
To jump in  
My baby showed up and said  
I will tell you when  
  
Well Im tore down  
Im almost level with the ground  
Well I feel like this  
When my baby cant be found  
  
I love you baby  
With all my heart an soul  
A love like mine will never grow old  
I love you in the mornin  
And in the evenin too  
But evrytime you leave me  
I get mad with you  
  
Well Im tore down  
Im almost level with the ground  
Well I feel like this  
When my baby cant be found  
  
I love you baby with all my might  
A love like mine is out of sight  
Ill lie for you if you want me to  
I really dont believe your love is true  
  
Well Im tore down  
Im almost level with the ground  
Well I feel like this  
When my baby cant be found  
  
Awell Im tore down  
Im almost level with the ground  
Well Im tore down  
Im almost level with the ground  
Well I feel like this  
When my baby cant be found
