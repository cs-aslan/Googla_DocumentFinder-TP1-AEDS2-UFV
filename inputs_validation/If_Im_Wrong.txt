Just the other day I heard my friend say  
Life was oh so bad love was all he had  
You know all day long I sing sad songs  
Got the blues feel  
Things no doctor can heal  
  
You know thats ok I never change my ways  
Maybe i am wrong but Ill soon be gone  
  
If i fail  no one can ever tell  
if im wrong i soon be gone  
  
Guitar solo  
  
If i fail  no one can ever tell  
if im wrong i soon be gone  
  
i dont need no friends i dont play no games  
i need lots of room to roam before i go home  
you know someday lord if things go my way  
ill have a son of my own left here to carry on  
  
if i fail  no one can ever tell  
if im wrong i soon be gone
