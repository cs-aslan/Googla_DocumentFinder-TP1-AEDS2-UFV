feat Mariah Carey  
  
John Legend  
Come bring me your softness  
Comfort me through all this madness  
Woman dont you know with you Im born again  
  
Mariah Carey  
Come give me your sweetness  
Now theres you there is no weakness  
Lying safe within your arms  
Im born again  
  
John Legend  
I was half not whole  
In step with none  
  
Mariah Carey  
Reaching through this world  
And need of one  
  
Both  
Come show me your kindness  
In your arms I know Ill find it

Come show me your kindess  
In your arms I know Ill find it
