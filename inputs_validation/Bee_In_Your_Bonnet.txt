I keep on churning away but pay no mind  
You dont know nothing bout me but thats alright  
  
I tell you true that Ill be there and thats for sure  
You got to let me go everywhere let me through that door  
Let me through that door  
  
You say you got a bee in your bonnet  
You know for every sting theres a cure  
But dont you put your finger right on it  
Youll only make it hurt all the more  
  
I doubt if youll be liable to read it in the bible  
But I aint going to say any more  
  
You cant build enough in a row but dont kid yourself  
You gotta know theyre all insane  
They goin ridin on the range  
Dont need no hifly strutter  
Go babe youre driving me crazy  
  
You got a new shining beau  
It dont pay to love  
It dont pay to love  
  
You say you got a bee in your bonnet  
You know for every sting theres a cure  
But dont you put your finger right on it  
Youll only make it hurt all the more  
  
I doubt if you be liable  
To read it in the bible  
I aint going to say any more  
  
Well there you go blaming yourself  
There you go hiding so deep in your shell  
You better not cry when your baby comes home  
Yeah you know shes going to find out somehow  
  
Youre having a breakdown right here and now  
I guess you dont know where youre headed for now  
Its OK youre going to live to see another day  
  
Lie cheat and beg borrow steal  
Gotta find a way to be real  
Show me something I aint seen before  
Were gonna make it through that door  
  
You may be in love and love its true  
But its a romance that you cant use  
Give me something and take it away  
Gonna get it right some day  
You gonna get it right some day  
  
You say you got a bee in your bonnet  
You know for every sting theres a cure  
But dont you put your finger right on it  
Youll only make it hurt all the more  
  
I doubt if you be liable  
To read it in the bible  
I aint going to say any more  
  
But there you go blaming yourself  
And there you go hiding  
So deep in your shell  
You better not cry when your baby comes home  
  
And you know shes going to find out somehow  
Youre having a breakdown right here and now  
I guess you dont know where youre heading for now  
Its OK youre going to live to see another day  
  
Well there you go blaming yourself  
There you go hiding so deep in your shell  
You better not cry when your baby comes home  
Yeah you know shes going to find out somehow  
  
Youre having a breakdown right here and now  
I guess you dont know where youre headed for now  
Its OK youre going to live to see another day
