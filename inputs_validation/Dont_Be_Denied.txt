Verse 1  
When I was a young girl  
My mama said to me  
Your daddys leaving home today  
I think hes gone to stay  
We packed up all our bags  
And drove out to Winnipeg  
When we got to Winnipeg  
I checked in to school  
I wore white bucks on my feet  
When I learned the golden rule  
The punches came fast and hard  
Lying on my back in the school yard  
  
Chorus  
Dont be denied dont be denied  
Dont be denied dont be denied  
Dont be denied dont be denied  
Verse 2  
Well pretty soon I met a friend  
He played guitar  
We used to sit on the steps at school  
And dream of being stars  
We started a band  
We played all night  
  
Chorus  
Dont be denied dont be denied  
Dont be denied dont be denied  
Dont be denied dont be denied  
  
Verse 3  
Oh Canada  
We played all night  
I really hate to leave you now  
But to stay just wouldnt be right  
Down in Hollywood  
We played so good  
The businessmen crowded around  
They came to hear the golden sound  
There we were on the Sunset Strip  
Playing our songs for the highest bid  
We played all night  
The price was right  
  
Chorus  
Dont be denied dont be denied  
Dont be denied dont be denied  
Dont be denied dont be denied  
  
Verse 4  
Well all that glitters isnt gold  
I know youve heard that story told  
And Im a pauper in a naked disguise  
A millionaire through a business mans eyes  
Oh friend of mine  
Dont be denied
