Theres something sexy bout the way youre dressed  
I can see youre lookin your best tonight thats right  
Youre walkin with a new attitude  
Theres something different bout the way youre movin tonight thats right  
But before we walk out the door let me say one thing more  
  
Save one last dance for our bedroom  
Baby Im in that kind of mood  
There aint no tellin what we might do  
When its all over and the night is through  
Baby how bout you Im in that kind of mood  
  
Its been a while since weve been out  
Its overdue baby aint no doubt you know aint it so  
Its feelin like our first date  
To tell the truth now honey I cant wait to go  
And I think you know  
Well tonight its just us two and baby I want you  
  
But before we walk out the door let me say one thing more  
Save one last dance for our bedroom  
Baby Im in that kind of mood  
There aint no tellin what we might do  
When its all over and the night is through  
Baby how bout you Im in that kind of mood  
  
But before we walk out the door let me say one thing more  
Save one last dance for our bedroom  
Baby Im in that kind of mood  
There aint no tellin what we might do  
When its all over and the night is through  
Baby how bout you Im in that kind of mood  
  
Im in that kind of mood  
Im in that kind of mood  
Im in that kind of mood
