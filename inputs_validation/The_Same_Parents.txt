Chorus  
We all had the same parents  
Many million years ago  
Why cant we live in freedom  
Without hunger with no war  
  
At the beginning we all had  
One mother and one father  
Thats where were descending from attention  
I dont I dont understand why so much hate attention  
  
Between races and religions  
Its mad insane  
I dont understand amazing  
Why it has to be like that incredible experience  
  
Chorus  
  
Attention I dont I dont understand  
Why so much hate amazing  
Between races and religions incredible experience
