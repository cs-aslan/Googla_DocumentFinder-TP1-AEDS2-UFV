Woman oh woman have you got cheating on your mind on your mind  
Theres something wrong between us that your laughter cannot hide  
And youre afraid to let your eyes meet mine  
And lately when I love you I know youre not satisfied  
Woman oh tell me woman have you got cheating on your mind on your mind  
Ive seen the way men look at you when they think I dont see  
And it hurts to have them think that youre that kind  
But its knowing that youre looking back thats really killing me  
Oh woman oh tell me woman have you got cheating on your mind on your mind  
  
A woman wears a certain look when she is on the move  
And a man can always tell whats on her mind  
I hate to have to say it but that looks all over you  
Oh woman oh tell me woman have you got cheating on your mind  
Oh woman oh tell me woman have you got cheating on your mind
