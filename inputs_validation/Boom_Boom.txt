Boom boom boom boom  
Im gonna shoot you right down  
Knock you off of your feet  
And take you home with me  
Put you in my house  
Boom boom boom boom  
  
Boom boom boom boom

I love to see you strut  
When youre walking to me  
When youre talking to me  
That knocks me out  
  
Boom boom boom boom  
You know I like it like that  
With your babytalk  
Oh and the way that you walk  
You know it knocks me right down  
Knocks me off of my feet  
  
Boom boom boom boom
