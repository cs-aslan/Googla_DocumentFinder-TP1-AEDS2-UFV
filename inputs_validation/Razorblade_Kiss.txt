I taste death in every kiss we share  
Every sundown seems to be the last we have  
Your breath on my skin has the scent of our end  
Im drunk on your tears Baby cant you see its hurting  
Every time we touch we get closer to heaven  
And at every sunrise our sins are forgiven  
Uh uh  
You on my skin this must be the end  
The only way you can love me ist to hurt me again  
And again  
  
Your love is a razor blade kiss  
Sweetest is the taste from your lips  
Your love is a razor blade kiss  
Sweetest is the taste from your lips  
Oh the taste from your lips my Darling  
Taste from your lips oh my Love  
  
Only inside Im free  
Im tired of waiting  
Youve got to let me dream  
Inside Baby  
Im not afraid to feel  
I want your to love me  
Cause you are the one  
Cause you are the one  
Cause you are the one  
  
Your love is a razor blade kiss  
Sweetest is the taste from your lips  
Your love is a razor blade kiss  
Sweetest is the taste from your lips  
Your love is a razor blade kiss  
Sweetest is the taste from your lips  
Your love is a razor blade kiss  
Sweetest is the taste from your lips
