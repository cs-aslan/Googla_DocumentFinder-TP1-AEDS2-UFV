Breeze sing a happy song  
This heart of mine is singing right along  
Dont know where Im going  
Dont know where it ends  
Till the grass is greener beyond the bend  
  
I havent got a care  
Im just on my way to anywhere  
Pocketful of nothing nothing I can spend  
Hope the grass is greener beyond the bend  
  
Beyond the bend  
Perhaps therell be somebody waiting whos right for me  
So I got to move around  
And I know Ive got to cover ground  
Oh the trip is shorter when you got a friend  
Gotta find that rainbow beyond the bend  
  
Beyond the bend beyond the bend
