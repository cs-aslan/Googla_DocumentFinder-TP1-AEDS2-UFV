Here we are  
Once more in a world full of fantasy  
Dream again  
You need to believe in a future  
Thats bright as the sun  
Shining there for you  
Shining there for me  
I am the mountain high I am the sea  
In the moment you take possession  
Itll all disappear and theres the lesson  
And the minute you think its over  
Say the word and your dream  
Is coming back  
All the way  
I followed the road that was real to me  
And suddenly  
You take it for granted  
And things dont turn out  
Like you planned  
When you think youve found  
What is good and true  
Through the open door  
It can really turn on you  
So here we are  
We look for the light in so many eyes  
And in our life  
When hope starts to fade  
Theres a strength that  
We give to each other  
Walking in the sky over everyone  
Head above the coulds  
As were touching the sun
