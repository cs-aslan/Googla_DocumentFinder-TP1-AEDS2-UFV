Looking around me  
Theres not so much in life I miss  
Things that I cant see  
Ill touch and Ill feel then Ill kiss  
Then I saw you standing there  
With a smile I couldnt share  
Just looking around evrywhere  
  
All the things Ive wanted to do  
Take so much time to get around to you  
Just reach out and catch and hold on  
Leaving trails of dust and lust  
Never even lyng or tryng keep on moving never dying  
  
Tunes that I cant hear  
Would take me for a while my smile  
Fares that are too dear  
Id rather walk out another mile  
Then I heard a tune so right  
It was in the dark of night  
Just listning around evrywhere  
  
All the things Ive wanted to do  
Take so much time to get around to you  
Just reach out and catch and hold on  
Leaving trails of dust and lust  
Never even lyng or tryng keep on moving never dying  
  
Smiles that I dont see  
Ill make them up as I go on  
Laughs that just cant be  
Ill make and laugh at evry one  
Then I saw you in your place  
With a laugh upon your face  
Just looking around evrywhere  
  
All the things Ive wanted to do  
Take so much time to get around to you  
Just reach out and catch and hold on  
Leaving trails of dust and lust  
Never even lyng or tryng keep on moving never dying  
  
Looking around with my feet on the ground  
Full of words and of sound bringing smiles all around  
  
Satisfy me with your words that can be  
Full of sound and Ill see Im just looking around
