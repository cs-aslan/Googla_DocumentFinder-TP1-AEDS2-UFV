Singing carols  
Stringing popcorn  
Making footprint in the snow  
Memries  
  
Christmas Memries  
Theyre the sweetest ones I know  
Cookies baking  
In the kitchen  
  
Cards and ribbons  
Everywhere  
Frosty Christmas Memries  
Float like snowflakes in the air  
  
And oh the joy of waking Xmas morning  
The famly round the tree  
We had a way of making Xmas morning  
As merry as can be  
  
I close my eyes and see  
Shiny faces  
Of all the children  
Who now have children of their own  
  
Funny  
But come December  
I remember every Xmas Ive known  
We had a way of making Xmas morning  
  
As merry as can be  
I close my eyes and see  
Those shiny faces  
Of all the children who now have children  
  
Of their own  
Its funny  
But come December  
When I remember  
  
Every Xmas Ive ever known  
Singing carols  
Stringing popcorn  
Shiny faces of all the children  
  
Precious memries  
Of every Christmas  
Ive known
