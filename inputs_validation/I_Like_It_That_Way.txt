robert jason  
Ive got someone in my life  
Who loves me wrong or right  
And I like it that way  
He gives me room to breathe  
But hes there for me  
And I like it that way  
I like it that way  
I like the way he says me name  
And how hes not afraid  
To open up and let his feelings show  
Hes exactly what I need  
He loves me honestly  
One look in his eyes  
Tells me all I need to me know  
When hes on overtime  
I get that little ache inside  
And I like it that way  
Were as close as two can be  
But hes still him and Im still me  
And I like it that way  
Yeah I like it that way
