Its irregular and it sure wont pay  
but say naught til you got something to say  
So I live for forty minutes a day  
Can I have that  
The biggest kick you ever got  
was paying out on dinosaur rock  
and said with every prehistoric thought  
you can stain  
For every door thats been closed  
theres another of your friends you can dose  
While your brains seem to speak through your clothes  
And for every handshake thatll pay  
theres another motherfuck wholl complain  
that to keep a legal dose is so lame  
Are you stray  
Those born with gold with weary souls  
Should eat their young and die  
Are you stray
