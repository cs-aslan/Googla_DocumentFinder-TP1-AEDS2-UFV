From the first breath of her life  
She flew straight into my arms  
I used to catch her from the swings  
When she was five  
And now she dances on the wind  
In a world as hard as stone  
Shes so anxious to begin  
And ready to fly  
  
And she walks with me  
And she talks with me  
And I hold her hand in mine  
I know shell find her way  
Like the light of day  
Cause its love that makes her strong  
  
Though I cannot stop the rain  
And I cannot turn the tide  
And I am sure there will be things  
That break her heart  
I can only let her know  
I am always on her side  
And even as I let her go  
Ill never be far  
  
And she walks with me  
And she talks with me  
In her eyes I see her truth  
Born of her fire and grace  
As she finds her place  
Cause its love that makes her strong  
  
And she walks with me  
And she talks with me  
In my eyes shell see my prayer  
As she turns each page  
Through this tender age  
It is love that makes her strong  
Its her love that makes her strong
