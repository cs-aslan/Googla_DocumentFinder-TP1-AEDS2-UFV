Ive been thinking about you  
And the pain you cant break through  
I cant give you the answers  
But I believe in you  
  
Dont tell me you given up  
No dont tell me your truth  
  
Every vision and dream  
All the lives youve seen  
Its all its all inside  
Like the light in the sky  
Shines through your eyes  
Its all its all inside  
  
You could wait for an angel  
You could wait for the stars to fall  
All you want is a miracle  
But you dont need it at all
