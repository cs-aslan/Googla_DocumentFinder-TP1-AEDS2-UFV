Well here we are smack in the middle of the 90s high tech age

Well thats all fine but I got a mind thats changing to fast for me  
Cause what I thought was new last month this month is history  
I got a brand new vcr its got 29 000 functions  
And I cant make the damn thing work so there goes Petticoat Junction  
Thats when I got the best idea I think I had in years  
I think Ill be cool and invent the tool thatll fax me a beer  
  
Would you all please fax me a beer  
This invention is gonna set the whole world on its ear  
Yeah makin old whiskey that was riskey but this is all in the clear  
Sit back relax and punch ol fax and Ill fax you a beer  
  
Japan and Germany they got nothing on us you see  
Why this is the latest and good ol American high technology  
And when this hits the marketplace Uncle Sam will rule the world  
Well hold on cause Im working on a machine thatll faxa real live girl  
  
Would you all please fax me a beer  
This invention is gonna set the whole world on its ear  
The old office code will never quite bet the same  
When it come cold and clear  
Sit back relax and punch ol fax and Ill fax you a beer  
  
Would you like me to fax me a beer  
This invention is gonna set the whole world on its ear  
The old office code will never be the same  
When it comes out cold and clear
