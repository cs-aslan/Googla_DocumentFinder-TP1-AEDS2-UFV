Dont rescue me  
I dont want to be  
Let you and me be  
Out of control  
Just because I cant sleep at night  
Just because I hear your voice  
Just because I see your face  
Just because I want you  
You youre the one  
Turn me inside out  
You youre the one  
Make me scream and shout  
You youre the one  
Derailroaded me  
You youre the one  
Dont rescue me  
You make me move  
Where I never been  
Lost in orbit  
All over you  
Just because I cant sleep at night  
Just because I hear your voice  
Just because I see your face  
Just because I want you  
Dont bring me back  
I beg to differ in fact  
You can question why  
But what good is that  
Dont rescue me I wont go back no I  
Dont rescue me  
I dont want to be  
Let you and me be  
Out of control  
You youre the one  
Turn me inside out  
You youre the one  
Make me scream and shout  
You youre the one  
Derailroaded me  
You youre the one  
Dont rescue me  
Just because I cant sleep at night  
Just because I hear your voice  
Just because I see your face  
Just because I want you  
You youre the one  
Turn me inside out  
You youre the one  
Make me scream and shout  
You youre the one  
Derailroaded me  
You youre the one  
Dont rescue me
