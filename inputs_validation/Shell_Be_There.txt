When your dreams have died around you shell be there  
When you need a hand to guide you shell be there  
And when you feel rejected cause life is not what you expected  
I know that shell be there  
If I hadnt lied and cheated shed be here  
If she wasnt so mistreated shed be here  
And if you dont abuse her I know youll never ever lose her  
And she will always be there  
I was too late to discover  
How much I really did love her  
But now her place is with you  
And I must face it its over with you  
Shell be there shell be there  
And if you dont abuse her I know youll never ever lose her  
And she will always be there shell be there  
Shell be there shell be there
