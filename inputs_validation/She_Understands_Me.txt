She understands me and she cares how I feel  
Cause shes always there to hold my hand  
Somehow she knows it when this old worlds got me down  
Yes she understands her man  
Weve seen the rain and the sunshine together  
Many times shes watched me stumble and fall  
And shes always there by my side when I need her  
Through the good through the bad through it all  
And though how it hurts me when her dreams dont come true  
When I cant give her all the things I planned  
But Lord it aint easy and she knows thats light  
Thank God for my woman she understands
