Right outside the window somethings happening  
A man he stares into a TV screen  
From the next apartment we hear music  
Bleeding through the scene  
  
TV pans the bedroom womans sleeping  
Hands are sprawled out loosely across the bed  
She must be pretty rich  
Cause I can see all the diamonds on her neck  
  
Chorus  
And theres always someone watching  
Eyes  
TVs and someones watching  
Eyes  
In the kitchen someones watching  
Eyes  
And the maid and butlers watching  
Eyes  
  
Silent sunbeams falling across the window  
Suddenly she awakens with surprise  
Day and night they always go so quickly  
In TV time  
  
Her husband rushes in and in the meantime  
She just slightly smiles and turns her head  
He just whispers something to her softly  
God knows what he said  
  
You know it wasnt very long  
Before the two of them were kissing  
She was his wife he was her man  
But they knew what they were missing  
  
Chorus  
  
TVs on and someones watching  
Eyes  
Theyre getting in through your eyes  
Dont let them poison your mind
