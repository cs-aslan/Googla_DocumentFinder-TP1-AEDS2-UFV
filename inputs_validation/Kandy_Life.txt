Weve got nothing left to lose but limousines and attitudes  
Yeah were banking on us baby its crazy  
Weve got nothing left to make but icing on this little cake  
Fashion sense and vanity consume us cause we  
  
We want that Kandy Life  
For me Id like that Kandy Life  
Could we get a taste of that Kandy Life  
I know our style might be abridged  
But we are the ones bitch  
  
We got sour grapes to fry to limit this credit card life  
Were banking on hits baby its crazy  
Weve got nothing left to lose but reservations and good booze  
Copy me celebrities consume us cause we  
  
We want that Kandy Life  
For me Id like that Kandy Life  
Could we get a taste of that Kandy Life  
I know our style might be abridged  
But we are the ones bitch  
  
I say change your pants and meet me in the  
Bathroom for a private tour and dance  
Well share our candy Im not your buddy  
Baby vanitys for me copy me cause we  
  
We want that Kandy Life  
For me Id like that Kandy Life  
Could we get a taste of that Kandy Life  
I know our style might be abridged  
But we are the ones bitch
