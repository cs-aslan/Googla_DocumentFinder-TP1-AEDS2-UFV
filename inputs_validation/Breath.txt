Chorus Nelly Furtado  
Im alive I can feel the blood rushing thru my veins an thats all I need  
Know cause Im not looking for a change cause I got friends and enemies  
But it just dont bother me cause as long as I believe I can breath  
Prevail  
Metamorphis battleaxe Fortress Four hundred horsepower full  
Moon the Sorceress Swollen Members an my girl nf the predators  
And the terminators the tribe cold breath why we hurt em later we  
Do so much damage now Theyll truck em when I hit them so much  
Garbage around yells bells and whistles like carnival sounds  
Phenominal adrenaline from words of my mouth  
Mad Child  
How did shayne manage to rap With brain damage Im phat remained  
Famished and stacked your playin with the praying mantis infact you  
Gigantic you sink like titanic panic attack act up and Im a Crash into  
Disaster smash like masterplaster punker ranglemonster wants  
To stomp ya crushin cause Im Crushin Will tomorrow be the same blood  
Rushin thru my veins  
Chorus  
Im alive I can feel the blood rushing thru my veins an thats all I need  
Know cause Im not looking for a change cause I got friends and enemies  
But it just dont bother me cause as long as I believe I can breath
