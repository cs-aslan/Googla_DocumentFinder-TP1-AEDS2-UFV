My Jesus is better  
Than anything in this world  
He loves me I love Him  
So I give Him everything  
  
He gave His life for me  
  
My Saviour  
Is living in me  
Redeemer  
Jesus He set me free  
  
Hes living in my heart  
He gave me a new start  
I asked Him He came in  
And washed away all my sin  
  
He gave His life for me  
He died to set me free  
  
If You can use anything  
Wont You use me  
Take me and break me and  
Mould me and make me  
You died for me  
So Im living for You  
Im living for You  
Im living for You  
  
Whoa  
Jesus He set me free
