I Think I See Gold  
Words by Ray Boltz Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
I see you struggling every day  
You think How long  
Can I go on this way  
On and on  
Again and again  
Oh when will it end  
You think I just cant go on  
Much longer  
But inside my friend  
Your faith is growing stronger  
You feel the fire burning  
Deep in your soul  
But I want you to know  
Chorus  
I think I see gold  
I think I see gold in the fire  
Right there in the ashes  
Is all youve desired  
Oh its hard  
As you press toward the goal  
Dont give up  
Dont give in  
Dont stop now  
I think I see gold  
Until this moment  
Youve always believed  
When life grew darkest  
By faith you could see  
Open your eyes  
Look for the light  
You see you were right  
These lonely hours  
Like a fire refining  
Something thats precious  
Something thats shining  
There in the darkness  
Surrounded by coals  
Is starting to glow  
Chorus
