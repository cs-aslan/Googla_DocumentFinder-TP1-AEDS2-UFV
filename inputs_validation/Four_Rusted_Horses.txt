Wholl ride this dying carousel  
Four rusting horses strangled by their own rope  
What children love a singing wheel  
Now that their tight hearts it broke  
That their tight hearts it broke  
  
Everyone will come everyone will come to my funeral  
To make sure that I stay dead  
Everyone will come everyone will come to my funeral  
To make sure that I stay dead  
  
I can see the coffin shining through my tinted window  
Mustve missed the sign that said it was a fire sale  
I can see the coffin shining through my tinted window  
Mustve missed the sign that said it was a fire sale  
  
Everyone will come everyone will come to my funeral  
To make sure that I stay dead  
Everyone will come everyone will come to my funeral  
To make sure that I stay dead  
  
You cant take this from me  
forbidden in Heaven and useless in Hell  
You cant take this from me  
forbidden in Heaven and useless in Hell  
Useless in Hell  
  
I can see the coffin shining through my tinted window  
Mustve missed the sign that said it was a fire sale  
I can see the coffin shining through my tinted window

To make sure that I stay dead  
  
You cant take this from me  
forbidden in Heaven and useless in Hell  
You cant take this from me  
forbidden in Heaven and useless in Hell
