Im addicted to feeling  
Stealing love isnt stealing  
Cant you see that I understand your mind  
  
Im a walking believer  
Im a ghost and a healer  
Im the shape of the home inside your heart  
  
Not looking for a brighter side  
Crooked steps will take me higher  
I dont care if you want to cry  
Im a soldier for hire  
Killing all you admire  
And you live in the cloud but that will change  
  
Not looking for a brighter side  
Crooked steps will take me higher  
I dont care if you want to cry  
  
Blood raining down  
Cuts a deep deep river  
And were diving  
And were diving  
  
By crooked steps  
Right behind you  
  
By crooked steps  
Right behind you  
  
Im a walking believer  
Im a ghost and a healer  
Cant you see that I understand your mind  
  
By crooked steps  
Right behind you
